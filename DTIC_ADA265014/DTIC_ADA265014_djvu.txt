3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 
1.3) was taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The 
contents of the magnetic tape were loaded onto VAX 6000 Model 350 
and transferred to the host/target computer by Ethernet. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host/targev computer, the 
full set of tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 

The tests were compiled, linked, and executed on the host/target 
computer system, as appropriate. The results were captured on the 
host/target computer system. The test results were transferred 
from the host/target computer to the VAX 6000 Model 350 where a 
magnetic was written capturing the test results. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the 
customer and reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for 
a complete listing of the processing options for this 
implementation. It also indicates the default options. The 
options invoked explicitly for validation testing during this test 
were: 

ADA/COPY_SOURCE/NODEBUG/NODIAG/ERROR_LIMIT=1000/LIST/NOSHOW 

Test output, compiler and linker listings, and job logs were 
captured on magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings 
examined on-site by the validation team were also archived.

CHAPTER 1 


INTRODUCTION 


The Ada implementation described above was tested according to the 
Ada Validation Procedures [Pro90] against the Ada Standard [Ada83] 
using the current Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC). This 
Validation Summary Report (VSR) gives an account of the testing of 
this Ada implementation. For any technical terms used in this 
report, the reader is referred to [Pro90]. A detailed description 
of the ACVC may be found in tne current ACVC User's Guide [UG89].

1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. 
The ACVC contains a collection of test programs structured into six 
test classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test 
name identifies the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and 
E tests are executable. Class B and class L tests are expected to 
produce errors at compile time and lin)c time, respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and 
produce a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result when they are executed. Three Ada library units, the 
packages REPORT and SPPRT13, and the procedure CHECK_FILE are used 
for this purpose. The package REPORT also provides a set of 
identity functions used to defeat some compiler optimizations 
allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test objective. 
The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the Ada 
Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents 
of text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 
of the Ada Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. If these units are not 
operating correctly, validation testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. 
Class B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is 
compiled and the resulting compilation listing is examined to 
verify that all violations of the Ada Standard are detected. Some 
of the class B tests contain legal Ada code which must not be 
flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects 
violation of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately 
compiled units. Errors are expected at link time, and execution is 
attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be 
replaced by implementation-specific values — for example, the 
largest integer. A list of the values used for this implementation 
is provided in Appendix A. In addition to these anticipated test 
modifications, additional changes may be required to remove 
unforeseen conflicts between the tests and implementation-dependent 
characteristics. The modifications required for this 
implementation are described in section 2.3. 


1-2 




For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by 
the AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications 
described in the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see 
section 2.1) and, possibly some inapplicable tests (see Section 3.2 
and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each 
test of the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


2.1 WITHDRAWN TESTS 

Some tests are withdrawn by the AVO from the ACVC because they do 
not conform to the Ada Standard. The following 95 tests had been 
withdrawn by the Ada Validation Organization (AVO) at the time of 
validation testing. The rationale for withdrawing each test is 
available from either the AVO or the AVF. The publication date for 
this list of withdrawn tests is 91-08-02.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are 
irrelevant for a given Ada implementation. The inapplicability 
criteria for some tests are explained in documents issued by ISO 
and the AJPO known as Ada Commentaries and commonly referenced in 
the format Al-ddddd. For this implementation, the following tests 
were determined to be inapplicable for the reasons indicated; 
references to Ada Commentaries are included as appropriate. 

C24113W..Y (3 tests) use a line length in the input file which 
exceeds 255 characters. 

C35713B, C45423B, B86001T, and C86006H check for the predefined 

type SHORT_FLOAT; for this implementation, there is no such type. 


2-1 



C45531M..P and C45532M..P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations 
for types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or greater; for 
this implementation, MAX_MANTISSA is less than 47. 

C45624A..B (2 tests) check that the proper exception is raised if 
MACHINE_OVERFLOWS is FALSE for floating point types and the results 
of various floating-point operations lie outside the range of the 
base type; for this implementation, MACHINE_0VERFLOWS is TRUE. 

B86001Y uses the name of a predefined fixed-point type other than 
type DURATION; for this implementation, there is no such type. 

B91001H checks that an address clause may not precede an entry 
declaration; this implementation does not support address clauses 
for entries. (See section 2.3.) 

C96005B uses values of type DURATION'S base type that are outside 
the range of type DURATION; for this implementation, the ranges are 
the same. 

CD1009C checks whether a length clause can specify a non-default 
size for a floating-point type; this implementation does not 
support such sizes. 

CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use length 
clauses to specify non-default sizes for access types; this 
implementation does notsupport such size's^ 

CD2B15B checks that STORAGE_ERROR is raised when the storage size 
specified for a collection is too small to hold a single value of 
the designated type; this implementation allocates more space than 
was specified by the length clause, as allowed by AI-00558. ' • ~ 

BD8001A, BD8003A, BD8004A..B (2 te*'ts), and AD8011A use machine 
code insertions; this implement ation provides no package 
MACHINE_CODE. 

The 18 tests listed in the following table check that USE_ERROR is 
raised if the given file operations are not supported for the given 
combination of mode and access method; this implementation supports 
these operations.

CE2105A CREATE IN FILE SEQUENTIAL_IO 

CE2105B CREATE INJFILE DIRECT_IO 

CE3109A CREATE INJFILE TEXT_IO 

The following 12 tests check operations on sequential, direct, and 
text files when multiple internal files are associated with the 
same external file and one or more are open for writing; USE_ERROR 
is raised when this association is attempted. 

CE2107B CE2107E CE2107G CE2110B CE2110D 

CE2111D CE2111H CE3111B CE3111D..E CE3114B 

CE3115A 

CE2107C..D (2 tests), CE2107H, and CE2107L apply function NAME to 
temporary sequential, direct, and text files in an attempt to 
associate multiple internal files with the same external file; 
USE_ERROR is raised because temporary files have no name. 

CE2108B, CE2108D, and CE3112B use the names of temporary 

sequential, direct, and text files that were created in other tests 
in order to check that the temporary files are not accessible after 
the completion of those tests; for this implementation, temporary 
files have no name. 

CE2111C checks that a supplied mode parameter can be RESET from 
INJFILE to OUT_FILE (An amplification in accessing privileges while 
the external file is being accessed). The proper exception is 
raised. 

CE2203A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of an 
external sequential file is exceeded; this implementation cannot 
restrict file capacity. 


2-3 







CE2401H, EE2401D, and EE2401G use instantiations of DIRECT_IO with 
unconstrained array and record types; this implementation raises 
USE_ERROR on the attempt to create a file of such types. 

CE2403A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of an 
external direct file is exceeded; this implementation cannot 
restrict file capacity. 

CE3413B checks that PAGE raises LAYOUT^ERROR when the value of the 
page number exceeds COUNT'LAST; for this implementation, the value 
of COUNT'LAST is greater than 150000, making the checking of this 
objective impractical. 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 1 test. 

B91001H was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as 
directed by the AVO. This test expects an error to be cited for an 
entry declaration that follows an address clause for a preceding 
entry; but this implementation does not support address clauses for 
entries (rather, it provides a package that allows a task to wait 
for the delivery of one or more signals) , and so rejects the 
address clause.

3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes 
each test of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada 
Programming Language Standard, whether the test is applicable or 
inapplicable; otherwise, the Ada Implementation fails the ACVC 
[Pro90]. 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard. 

The list of items below gives the number of ACVC tests in various 
categories. All tests were processed, except those that were 
withdrawn because of test errors (item b; see section 2.1), those 
that require a floating-point precision that exceeds the 
implementation's maximum precision (item e; see section 2.2), and 
those that depend on the support of a file system — if none is 
supported (item d) . All tests passed, except those that are listed 
in sections 2.1 and 2.2 (counted in items b and f, below). 

a) Total Number of Applicable Tests 3996 

b) Total Number of Withdrawn Tests 95 

c) Processed Inapplicable Tests 79 

d) Non-Processed I/O Tests 0

f) Total Number of Inapplicable Tests 79 (c+d+e) 

g) Total Number of Tests for ACVC 1.11 4170 (a+b+f) 

When this implementation was tested, the tests listed in section 
2.1 had been withdrawn because of test errors. 

3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 
1.3) was taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The 
contents of the magnetic tape were loaded onto VAX 6000 Model 350 
and tranfered to the host/target computer by Ethernet. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host/target computer, the 
full set of tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 

The tests were compiled, linked, and executed on the host/target 
computer system, as appropriate. The results were captured on the 
host/target computer system. The test results were transferred 
from the host/target computer to the VAX 6000 Model 350 where a 
magnetic was written capturing the test results. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the 
customer and reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for 
a complete listing of the processing options for this 
implementation. It also indicates the default options. The 
options invoked explicitly for validation testing during this test 
were: 

ADA/C0PY_S0URCE/N0DEBUG/N0DIAG/ERR0R_LIMIT=1000/LIST/NOSHOW 

Test output, compiler and linker listings, and job logs were 
captured on magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings 
examined on-site by the validation team were also archived.

MACRO PARAMETERS 


This appendix contains the macro parameters used for customizing 
the ACVC. The meaning and purpose of these parameters are 
explained in [UG89]. The parameter values are presented in two 
tables. The first table lists the values that are defined in terms 
of the maximum input-line length, which is the value for 
$MAX_IN LEN—also listed here. These values are expressed here as 
Ada string aggregates, where "V" represents the maximum input-line 
length.

COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


The compiler options of this Ada implementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to compiler documentation and 
not to this report. 


B-l 





Compiler options for DEC Ada hosted on OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP 
systems 

The default compiler options were used except as follows: 

1. /LIST was used to produce compiler listings. 

2. /NODEBUG was used to inhibit the generation of debugging 
information in the object file since such information is not 
relevant to validation. 

3. /ERROR_LIMIT-1000 was used since more than 30 errors are 
diagnosed for some validation tests. 

4. /NOSHOW was used to exclude portability information from the 
compiler listings 


The DEC Ada compiler options and defaults for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS 
AXP systems are summarized as follows: 

o /ANALYSIS_DATA or /NOANALYSIS_DATA 

Controls whether a data analysis file containing source code 
cross-referencing and static analysis information is created. 
The default is /NOANALYSISJDATA. 

o /CHECK or /NOCHECK 

Controls whether run-time error checking is suppressed. (Use 
of /NOCHECK is equivalent to giving all possible suppress 
pragmas in the source program.) The default is /CHECK (error 
checking is not suppressed except by pragma). 

o /COPY_SOURCE or /NOCOPY_SOURCE 

Controls whether the source being compiled is copied into the 
compilation library for a successful compilation. The 
default is /COPY_SOURCE. 

o /DEBUG or /NODEBUG or /DEBUG-option 

where option is one of 

ALL, SYMBOLS or NOSYMBOLS, TRACEBACK or NOTRACEBACK, or NONE 

Controls the inclusion of debugging symbol table information 
in the compiled object module. The default is /DEBUG or, 
equivalently, /DEBUG-ALL. 

o /DESIGN or /NODESIGN 

Controls whether the input file is processed as a design or 
compiled as an Ada source. The default is /NODESIGN, in 






which case the file is compiled. 


o /DIAGNOSTICS /DIAGNOSTICS-file-name, or /NODIAGNOSTICS 

Controls whether a special diagnostics file is produced for 
use with the VAX Language-Sensitive Editor (a separate 
DIGITAL product). The default is /NODIAGNOSTICS. 

o /ERROR__LIMIT-n 

Controls the number of error level diagnostics that are 
allowed within a single compilation unit before the 
compilation is aborted. The default is /ERROR_LIMIT-30. 

o /LIBRARY-directory-name 

Specifies the name of the Ada compilation library to be used 
as the context for the compilation. The default is the 
library last established by the ACS SET LIBRARY command. 

o /LIST, /LIST-file-name, or /NOLIST 

Controls whether a listing file is produced. /LIST without a 
file-name uses a default file-name of the form 
sourcename.LIS, where sourcename is the name of the source 
file being compiled. The default is /NOLIST (for both 
interactive and batch mode). 

o /LOAD or /NOLOAD 

Controls whether the current program library is updated with 
successfully processed units contained in the source file. 
The default is /LOAD, 

o /MACHINE_CODE or /NOMACHINE_CODE 

Controls whether generated machine code (approximating 
assembler notation) is included in the listing file, if 
produced. The default is /NOMACHINE_CODE. 

o /NOTE_SOURCE or /NONOTE_SOURCE 

Controls whether the file specification of the current source 
file is noted in the compilation library. (This copy is used 
for certain automated (re)compilation features.) The default 
is /NOTE_SOURCE. 

o /OPTIMIZE or /NOOPTIMIZE 

Controls whether full or minimal optimization is applied in 
producing the compiled code. The default is /OPTIMIZE. 
(/NOOPTIMIZE is primarily of use in combination with /DEBUG.) 



o /SYNTAX_ONLY or /NOSYNTAX_ONLY 

Controls whether a syntax check only is performed. The 
default is /NOSYNTAX_ONLY , which indicates that full 
processing is done. 

o /SHOW-PORTABILITY or /NOSHOW 

Controls whether a portability summary is included in the 
listing. The default is /SHOW-PORTABILITY. 

o /WARNINGS-(category:destination,...) 

Specifies which categories of informational and warning level 
messages are displayed for which destinations. The 
categories can be WARNINGS, WEAK_WARNINGS, SUPPLEMENTAL, 

COMPILATION_NOTES and STATUS. The destinations can be ALL, 

NONE or combinations of TERMINAL, LISTING or DIAGNOSTICS. 
The default is 

/WARNINGS-(WARN:ALL,WEAK:ALL,SUPP:ALL,COMP:NONE,STAT:LIST) 





LINKER OPTIONS 


The linker options of this Ada implementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to linker documentation and 
not to this report. 


B-2 





Linker options for DEC Ada hosted on OpenVMS VAX and 

systems 


OpenVMS AXP 


DEC Ada programs are linked using the "ACS LINK" command. The default 
ACS LINK options were used except as follows: 

1. /COMMAND was used. ACS LINK checks that all units in a 

program are current and writes a command file to create the 
executable image using the VMS linker. By default, this 

command file is invoked in a subprocess and the image is 
linked. If /COMMAND is specified, the command file is 
written but not invoked. For validation, /COMMAND was used, 
and the generated command file was invoked after the ACS LINK 
command to do the actual link. This approach saves the 
overhead of spawning a subprocess for each executable 
validation test. 

2. /NOTRACE was specified to exclude traceback symbol 

information from the image file since this information is 
only relevant when debugging programsr 

3. /EXECUTABLE was used to specify the name of the executable 
image file. 

4. For VAXELN targets only, /SYSTEM_NAME-VAXELN was used-;—.~ > 

The options and defaults for linking Ada programs are summarized 
below. 

o /COMMAND-file-name 

Write a command file create the executable image using the 
VMS linker but do not invoke this commmand file. 

o /DEBUG or /NODEBUG 

Controls whether a debugger symbol table is included in the 
executable image. The default is /NODEBUG. 

o /EXECUTABLE, /EXECUTABLE-file-name, or /NOEXECUTABLE 

Controls whether the linker creates an executable image file 
and optionally provides the name of the file. The default is 
/EXECUTABLE. 

o /LOG or /NOLOG 

Controls wheter a list of all units in the image is 
displayed. The default is /NOLOG. 

o /MAIN or /NOMAIN 

Specifies whether the main Ada unit is the main program. The 





default is /MAIN which indicates that the main Ada unit is 
the main program. 

o /MAP, /MAP-file-name, or /NOMAP 

Controls whether the linker creates an image map listing 
file. The default is /NOMAP. If /MAP is specified, some 
other options can be specified to control the level of detail 
in the map listing file. 

o /OUTPUT-file-name 

If specified, requests that output be written to a file other 
than to the standard output device. 

o /SYSLIB or /NOSYSLIB 

Controls whether the linker automatically searches the 

default system library for unresolved references. By 

default, it is automatically searched. 

o /SYSSHR or /NOSYSSHR 

Controls whether the linker automatically searches the 

default system shareable image library for unresolved 

references. By default, it is automatically searched. 

o / SYSTEM__NAME-system 

Directs the program library manager to produce an image for 
execution on a particular operating system. On VAX systems, 
the possible values are VAX_VMS or VAXELN. On AXP systems, 
the only value supported is OpenVMS_AXP. 

If /SYSTEM_NAME is not specified, the setting of the pragma 
SYSTEM_NAME determines the target environment. 

o /TRACEBACK or /NOTRACEBACK 

Controls whether subprogram traceback information is included 
in the executable image for run-time error reporting. The 
default is /TRACEBACK. 

O /USERLIBRARY-(table,...) or /NOUSERLIBRARY 

Controls whether the linker searches any user-defined default 
libraries for unresolved external symbols. By default, the 
linker searches process, group, and system logical name 
tables for user-defined library definitions. 

Additional options are provided that control whether the link is done 
while the user waits or is done in a background mode. Using one 
option or the other has no effect on the executable image that is 
generated.

The only allowed implementation dependencies correspond to 
implementation-dependent pragmas, to certain machine-dependent 
conventions as mentioned in Chapter 13 of the Ada Standard, and to 
certain allowed restrictions on representation clauses. The

Predefined Language Pragmas 


i This annex defines the pragmas LIST, PAGE, and OPTIMIZE, and summarizes 
the definitions given elsewhere of the remaining language-defined pragmas. 

The DEC Ada pragmas IDENT and TITLE are also defined in this annex. 


Pragma Meaning 

AST_ENTRY On VMS systems only. 

Takes the simple name of a single 
entry as the single argument; at most 
one AST_ENTRY pragma is allowed 
for any given entry. This pragma 
must be used in combination with the 
AST_ENTRY attribute, and is only 
allowed after the entry declaration and 
in the same task type specification or 
single task as the entry to which it 
applies. This pragma specifies that the 
given entry may be used to handle a 
VMS asynchronous system trap (AST) 
resulting from a VMS system service 
call. The pragma does not affect 
normal use of the entry (see 9.12a). 

COMMON_OBJECT Takes an internal name denoting 

an object, and optionally takes an 
external designator (the name of a 
linker storage area) and a size as 
arguments. This pragma is only 
allowed at the place of a declarative 
item, and must apply to a variable 
declared by an earlier declarative 
item of the same declarative part or 






package specification. The variable 
must have a size that is known at 
compile time, and it must not require 
implicit initialization. This pragma is 
not allowed for objects declared with 
a renaming declaration. This pragma 
enables the shared use of objects that 
are stored in overlaid storage areas 
(see 13.9a.2.3). 

COMPONENT_ALIGNMENT Takes an alignment choice and 

optionally the simple name of an array 
or record type as arguments. When no 
simple name is specified, the pragma 
must occur within a declarative part or 
package specification, and the effect of 
the pragma extends to types declared 
from the place of the pragma to the 
end of the innermost declarative part 
or package specification in which 
the pragma was declared. When a 
simple name is specified, the pragma 
and the type declaration must both 
occur immediately within the same 
declarative part, package specification, 
or task specification; the declaration 
must occur before the pragma. The 
position of the pragma and the 
restrictions on the named type are 
governed by the same rules as those for 
a representation clause. This pragma 
specifies the kind of alignment used for 
the components of the array or record 
types to which it applies (see 13.1a). 

CONTROLLED Takes the simple name of an access 

type as the single argument. This 
pragma is only allowed immediately 
within the declarative part or package 
specification that contains the 
declaration of the access type; the 
declaration must occur before the 
pragma. This pragma is not allowed for 
a derived type. This pragma specifies 


B-2 






ELABORATE 


EXPORT_EXCEPTION 


that automatic storage reclamation 
must not be performed for objects 
designated by values of the access type, 
except upon leaving the innermost 
block statement, subprogram body, or 
task body that encloses the access type 
declaration, or after leaving the main 
program (see 4.8). 

Takes one or more simple names 
denoting library units as arguments. 
This pragma is only allowed 
immediately after the context clause 
of a compilation unit (before the 
subsequent library unit or secondary 
unit). Each argument must be 
the simple name of a library unit 
mentioned by the context clause. 

This pragma specifies that the 
corresponding library unit body 
must be elaborated before the 
given compilation unit. If the given 
compilation unit is a subunit, the 
library unit body must be elaborated 
before the body of the ancestor library 
unit of the subunit (see 10.5). 

On VMS systems only. 

Takes an internal name denoting an 
exception, and optionally takes an 
external designator (the name of a 
linker global symbol), a form (ADA 
or VMS), and a code (a static integer 
expression that is interpreted as a 
condition code) as arguments. A code 
value must be specified when the 
form is VMS (the default if the form 
is not specified). This pragma is only 
allowed at the place of a declarative 
item, and must apply to an exception 
declared by an earlier declarative 
item of the same declarative part 
or package specification; it is not 


B-3 







allowed for an exception declared 
with a renaming declaration or for an 
exception declared in a generic unit. 
This pragma permits an Ada exception 
to be handled by programs written in 
another programming language (see 
13.9a.3.2). 

EXPORT_FUNCTION Takes an internal name denoting 

a function, and optionally takes an 
external designator (the name of a 
linker global symbol), parameter types, 
result type, parameter mechanisms, 
and result mechanism as arguments. 
This pragma is only allowed at the 
place of a declarative item, and 
must apply to a function declared 
by an earlier declarative item of the 
same declarative part or package 
specification. In the case of a function 
declared as a compilation unit, the 
pragma is only allowed after the 
function declaration and before 
any subsequent compilation unit. 

This pragma is not allowed for a 
function declared with a renaming 
declaration, and it is not allowed for a 
generic function (it may be given for 
a generic instantiation). This pragma 
permits an Ada function to be called 
from a program written in another 
programming language (see 13.9a. 1.3). 

EXPORT_OBJECT Takes an internal name denoting an 

object, and optionally takes an external 
designator (the name of a linker global 
symbol) and size option (a linker 
absolute global symbol that will be 
defined in the object module—useful 
on VMS systems only) as arguments. 
This pragma is only allowed at the 
place of a declarative item, and must 
apply to a constant or a variable 
declared by an earlier declarative 


B—4 








item of the same declarative part or 
package specification; the declaration 
must occur at the outermost level of a 
library package specification or body. 
The object to be exported must have 
a size that is known at compile time. 
This pragma is not allowed for objects 
declared with a renaming declaration, 
and is not allowed in a generic unit. 
This pragma permits an Ada object to 
be referred to by a routine written in 
another programming language (see 
13.9a.2.2). 

EXPORT_PROCEDURE Takes an internal name denoting 

a procedure, and optionally takes 
an external designator (the name of 
a linker global symbol), parameter 
types, and parameter mechanisms 
as arguments. This pragma is only 
allowed at the place of a declarative 
item, and must apply to a procedure 
declared by an earlier declarative 
item of the same declarative part or 
package specification. In the case of a 
procedure declared as a compilation 
unit, the pragma is only allowed 
after the procedure declaration and 
before any subsequent compilation 
unit. This pragma is not allowed for 
a procedure declared with a renaming 
declaration, and is not allowed for a 
generic procedure (it may be given for 
a generic instantiation). This pragma 
permits an Ada routine to be called 
from a program written in another 
programming language (see 13.9a. 1.3). 

EXPORT_VALUED_PROCEDURE Takes an internal name denoting 

a procedure, and optionally takes 
an external designator (the name of 
a linker global symbol), parameter 
types, and parameter mechanisms 
as arguments. This pragma is only 


B-5 








FLOAT. 


I DENT 


allowed at the place of a declarative 
item, and must apply to a procedure 
declared by an earlier declarative item 
of the same declarative part or package 
specification. In the case of a procedure 
declared as a compilation unit, the 
pragma is only allowed after the 
procedure declaration and before any 
subsequent compilation.unit. The first 
(or only) parameter of the procedure 
must be of mode out. This pragma is 
not allowed for a procedure declared 
with a renaming declaration and is not 
allowed for a generic procedure (it may 
be given for a generic instantiation). 
This pragma permits an Ada procedure 
to behave as a function that both 
returns a value and causes side effects 
on its parameters when it is called 
from a routine written in another 
programming language (see 13.9a.1.3). 

REPRESENTATION On VMS systems only. 

On VMS VAX systems, takes VAX_ 
FLOAT as the single argument. On 
VMS AXP systems, takes either 
VAX.FLOAT or IEEE_FLOAT as 
the single argument; the default is 
VAX_FLOAT. This pragma is only 
allowed at the start of a compilation, 
before the first compilation unit (if 
any) of the compilation. It specifies 
the choice of representation to be 
used for the predefined floating point 
types in the packages SYSTEM and 
STANDARD, (see 3.5.7a). 

Takes a string literal of 31 or fewer 
characters as the single argument. The 
pragma IDENT has the following form: 

pragma IDENT (string_literal); 


B-6 



This pragma is allowed only in 
the outermost declarative part or 
declarative items of a compilation unit. 
The given string is used to identify 
the object module associated with the 
compilation unit in which the pragma 
IDENT occurs. 

On VMS systems only. 

Takes an internal name denoting an 
exception, and optionally takes an 
external designator (the name of a 
linker global symbol), a form (ADA 
or VMS), and a code (a static integer 
expression that is interpreted as a 
condition code) as arguments. A code 
value is allowed only when the form 
is VMS (the default if the form is 
not specified). This pragma is only 
allowed at the place of a declarative 
item, and must apply to an exception 
declared by an earlier declarative item 
of the same declarative part or package 
specification; it is not allowed for an 
exception declared with a renaming 
declaration. This pragma permits a 
non-Ada exception (most notably, a 
VMS condition) to be handled by an 
Ada program (see 13.9a.3.1). 

Takes an internal name denoting 
a function, and optionally takes an 
external designator (the name of a 
linker global symbol), parameter types, 
result type, parameter mechanisms, 
and result mechanism as arguments. 
On VMS systems, a first optional 
parameter is also available as an 
argument. The pragma INTERFACE 
must be used with this pragma 
(see 13.9). This pragma is only allowed 
at the place of a declarative item, and 
must apply to a function declared 



by an earlier declarative item of the 
same declarative part or package 
specification. In the case of a function 
declared as a compilation unit, the 
pragma is only allowed after the 
function declaration and before any 
subsequent compilation unit. This 
pragma is allowed for a function 
declared with a renaming declaration; 
it is not allowed for a generic function 
or a generic function instantiation. 

This pragma permits a non-Ada 
routine to be used as an Ada function 
(see 13.9a.1.1). 

IMPORT_OBJECT Takes an internal name denoting 

an object, and optionally takes an 
external designator (the name of a 
linker global symbol) and size (a linker 
absolute global symbol that will be 
defined in the object module—useful 
on VMS systems only) as arguments. 
This pragma is only allowed at the 
place of a declarative item, and 
must apply to a variable declared 
by an earlier declarative item of the 
same declarative part or package 
specification. The variable must have 
a size that is known at compile time, 
and it cannot have an initial value. 
This pragma is not allowed for objects 
declared with a renaming declaration. 
This pragma permits storage declared 
in a non-Ada routine to be referred to 
by an Ada program (see 13.9a.2.1). 

IMPORT_PROCEDURE Takes an internal name denoting 

a procedure, and optionally takes 
an external designator (the name of 
a linker global symbol), parameter 
types, and parameter mechanisms 
as arguments. On VMS systems, 
a first optional parameter is also 
available as an argument The pragma 


B-8 





INTERFACE must be used with this 
pragma (see 13.9). This pragma is only 
allowed at the place of a declarative 
item, and must apply to a procedure 
declared by an earlier declarative 
item of the same declarative part or 
package specification. In the case of a 
procedure declared as a compilation 
unit, the pragma is only allowed after 
the procedure declaration and before 
any subsequent compilation unit. This 
pragma is allowed for a procedure 
declared with a renaming declaration; 
it is not allowed for a generic procedure 
or a generic procedure instantiation. 
This pragma permits a non-Ada routine 
to be used as an Ada procedure 
(see 13.9a.1.1). 

Takes an internal name denoting 
a procedure, and optionally takes 
an external designator (the name of 
a linker global symbol), parameter 
types, and parameter mechanisms 
as arguments. On VMS systems, 
a first optional parameter is also 
available as an argument. The pragma 
INTERFACE must be used with this 
pragma (see 13.9). This pragma is only 
allowed at the place of a declarative 
item, and must apply to a procedure 
declared by an earlier declarative item 
of the same declarative part or package 
specification. In the case of a procedure 
declared as a compilation unit, the 
pragma is only allowed after the 
procedure declaration and before any 
subsequent compilation unit. The first 
(or only) parameter of the procedure 
must be of mode out. This pragma 
is allowed for a procedure declared 
with a renaming declaration; it is not 
allowed for a generic procedure. This 






INLINE 


INLINE 


pragma permits a non-Ada routine that 
returns a value and causes side effects 
on its parameters to be used as an Ada 
procedure (see 13.9a.l.l). 

Takes one or more names as 
arguments; each name is either the 
name of a subprogram or the name of 
a generic subprogram. This pragma 
is only allowed at the place of a 
declarative item in a declarative part 
or package specification, or after a 
library unit in a compilation, but before 
any subsequent compilation unit. This 
pragma specifies that the subprogram 
bodies should be expanded inline at 
each call whenever possible; in the case 
of a generic subprogram, the pragma 
applies to calls of its instantiations 
(see 6.3.2). 

GENERIC Takes one or more names as 

arguments; tach name is either the 
name of a generic declaration or the 
name of an instance of a generic 
declaration. This pragma is only 
allowed at the place of a declarative 
item in a declarative part or package 
specification, or after a library unit 
•n a compilation, but before any 
subsequent compilation unit. Each 
argument must be the simple name 
of a generic subprogram or package, 
or a (nongeneric) subprogram or 
package that is an instance of a generic 
subprogram or package declared by 
an earlier declarative item of the 
same declarative part or package 
specification. This pragma specifies 
that inline expansion of the generic 
body is desired for each instantiation 
of the named generic declarations or 
of the particular named instances; 
the pragma does not apply to calls of 


B-10 




instances of generic subprograms 
(see 12.1a). 


INTERFACE 


INTERFACE 


Takes a language name and a 
subprogram name as arguments. This 
pragma is allowed at the place of a 
declarative item, a id must apply in 
this case to a sub’ rogram declared 
by an earlier declarative item of the 
same declarative part or package 
specification. This pragma is also 
allowed for a library unit; in this case 
the pragma must appear after the 
subprogram declaration, and before 
any subsequent compilation unit. This 
pragma specifies the other language 
(and thereby the calling conventions) 
and informs the compiler that an 
object module will be supplied for the 
corresponding subprogram (see 13.9). 

In DEC Ada, the pragma IN T ERFACE 
is required in combination with the 
pragmas IMPORT.FUNCTION, 
IMPORT_PROCEDURE, and 
IMPORT_VALUED_PROCEDURE 
when any of those pragmas are used 
(see 13.9a.1). 

NAME Takes an internal name and an 

external name as arguments. The 
internal name may be an Ada simple 
name that denotes a subprogram or 
an object. If the declared entity is a 
function, the internal name may be a 
string literal that denotes an operator 
symbol. The external name may be any 
string literal; the literal is used as a 
linker global symbol that is associated 
with the external subprogram or 
object. This pragma is only allowed 
at the place of a declarative item, 
and must apply to an entity declared 
by an earlier declarative item of the 


B-11 



same declarative part or package 
specification. 

If this pragma applies to a subprogram, 
then the pragma INTERFACE must 
also apply (see 13.9). If a subprogram 
has been declared as a compilation 
unit, the pragma is only allowed after 
the subprogram declaration and before 
any subsequent compilation unit. This 
pragma is allowed for subprograms 
declared with a renaming declaration. 
This pragma is not allowed for a 
generic subprogram or a generic 
subprogram instantiation. 

If this pragma applies to an object, 
then the size of the object must be 
known at compile time. This pragma is 
not allowed for an the object declared 
with a renaming declaration. 

This pragma associates an external 
symbol with the internal Ada name for 
a subprogram or object (see 13.9b). 

s LIST Takes one of the identifiers ON or 

OFF as the single argument. This 
pragma is allowed anywhere a pragma 
is allowed. It specifies that listing of 
the compilation is to be continued or 
suspended until a LIST pragma with 
the opposite argument is given within 
the same compilation. The pragma 
itself is always listed if the compiler is 
producing a listing. 

LONG_FLOAT On VMS systems only. Also, the 

value of the pragma FLOAT_ 
REPRESENTATION must be VAX_ 
FLOAT. 


B—12 





MAIN_STORAGE 


MEMORY_SIZE 


Takes either D.FLOAT or G.FLOAT 
as the single argument. The default 
is G_FLOAT. This pragma is only 
allowed at the start of a compilation, 
before the first compilation unit 
(if any) of the compilation. It specifies 
the choice of representation to be used 
for the predefined type LONG_FLOAT 
in the package STANDARP, and for 
floating point type declarations with 
digits specified in the range 7 .. 15 
(see 3.5.7b). 

On VMS VAX systems only. 

Takes one or two nonnegative static 
simple expressions of some integer type 
as arguments. This pragma is only 
allowed in the outermost declarative 
part of a library subprogram; at most 
one such pragma is allowed in a library 
subprogram. It has an effect only when 
the subprogram to which it applies is 
used as a main program. This pragma 
causes a fixed-size stack to be created 
for a main task (the task associated 
with a main program), and determines 
the number of storage units (bytes) 
to be allocated for the stack working 
storage area or guard pages or both. 
The value specified for either or both 
the working storage area and guard 
pages is rounded up to an integral 
number of pages. A value of zero for 
the working storage area results in the 
use of a default size; a value of zero for 
the guard pages results in no guard 
storage. A negative value for either 
working storage or guard pages causes 
the pragma to be ignored (see 13.2b). 

Takes a numeric literal as the single 
argument. This pragma is only allowed 
at the start of a compilation, before the 


8-13 





first compilation unit (if any) of the 
compilation. The effect of this pragma 
is to use the value of the specified 
numeric literal for the definition of the 
named number MEMORYJ3IZE 
(see 13.7). 

Takes one of the identifiers TIME 
or SPACE as the single argument. 

This pragma is only allowed within a 
declarative part and it applies to the 
block or body enclosing the declarative 
part. It specifies whether time or space 
is the primary optimization criterion. 

In DEC Ada, this pragma is only 
allowed immediately within a 
declarative part of a body declaration. 

Takes the simple name of a record or 
array type as the single argument. The 
allowed positions for this pragma, and 
the restrictions on the named type, 
are governed by the same rules as for 
a representation clause. The pragma 
specifies that storage minimization 
should be the main criterion when 
selecting the representation of the 
given type (see 13.1). 

This pragma has no argument, and is 
allowed any%vhere a pragma is allowed. 
It specifies that the program text which 
follows the pragma should start on a 
new page (if the compiler is currently 
producing a listing). 

Takes a static expression of the 
predefined integer subtype PRIORITY 
as the single argument. This pragma is. 
only allowed within the specification of 
a task unit or immediately within the 
outermost declarative part of a main 
program. It specifies the priority of the 






task (or tasks of the task type) or the 
priority of the main program (see 9.8). 

PSECTOBJECT On VMS systems only. 

Has the same syntax and the same 
effect as the pragma COMMON_ 
OBJECT (see 13.9a.2.3). 

12 SHARED Takes the simple name of a variable as 

the single argument. This pragma is 
allowed only for a variable declared by 
an object declaration and whose type 
is a scalar or access type; the variable 
declaration and the pragma must 
both occur (in this order) immediately 
within the same declarative part or 
package specification. This pragma 
specifies that every read or update of 
the variable is a synchronization point 
for that variable. An implementation 
must restrict the objects for which 
this pragma is allowed to objects 
for which each of direct reading and 
direct updating is implemented as an 
indivisible operation (see 9.11). 

SHARE.GENERIC On VMS systems only. 

Takes one or more names as 
arguments; each name is either the 
name of a generic declaration or the 
name of an instance of a generic 
declaration. This pragma is only 
allow'd at the place of a declarative 
item in a declarative part or package 
specification, or after a library unit in a 
compilation, but before any subsequent 
compilation unit. Each argument 
either must be the simple name of a 
generic subprogram or package, or it 
must be a (nongeneric) subprogram 
or package that is an instance of a 
generic subprogram or package. If the 
argument is an instance of a generic 


B-15 







subprogram or package, then it must 
be declared by an earlier declarative 
item of the same declarative part or 
package specification. This pragma 
specifies that generic code sharing is 
desired for each instantiation of the 
named generic declarations or of the 
particular named instances (see 12.1b). 

Takes a numeric literal as the single 
argument. This pragma is only allowed 
at the start of a compilation, before the 
first compilation unit (if any) of the 
compilation. The effect of this pragma 
is to use the value of the specified 
numeric literal for the definition of the 
named number STORAGE_UNIT 
(see 13.7). 

In DEC Ada, the only argument 
allowed for this pragma is 8 (bits). 

Takes as arguments the identifier 
of a check and optionally also the 
name of either an object, a type or 
subtype, a subprogram, a task unit, or 
a generic unit. This pragma is only 
allowed either immediately within a 
declarative part or immediately within 
a package specification. In the latter 
case, the only allowed form is with a 
name that denotes an entity (or several 
overloaded subprograms) declared 
immediately within the package 
specification. The permission to omit 
the given check extends from the 
place of the pragma to the end of the 
declarative region associated with the 
innermost enclosing block statement or • 
program unit. For a pragma given in a 
package specification, the permission 
extends to the end of the scope of the 
named entity. 






SUPPRESS, ALL 


SYSTEM_NAME 


TAS K_STO RAGE 


If the pragma includes a name, the 
permission to omit the given check 
is further restricted: it is given only 
for operations on the named object 
or on all objects of the base type of a 
named type or subtype; for calls of a 
named subprogram; for activations of 
tasks of the named task type; or for 
instantiations of the given generic unit 
(see 11.7). 

This pragma has no argument and is 
only allowed following a compilation 
unit. This pragma specifies that 
all run-time checks in the unit are 
suppressed (see 11.7). 

Takes an enumeration literal as the 
single argument. This pragma is only 
allowed at the start of a compilation, 
before the first compilation unit 
(if any) of the compilation. The effect of 
this pragma is to use the enumeration 
literal with the specified identifier 
for the definition of the constant 
SYSTEM_NAME. This pragma is 
only allowed if the specified identifier 
corresponds to one of the literals of the 
type NAME declared in the package 
SYSTEM (see 13.7). 

Takes the simple name of a task 
type and a static expression of some 
integer type as arguments. This 
pragma is allowed anywhere that a 
task storage specification is allowed; 
that is, the declaration of the task 
type to which the pragma applies and 
the pragma must both occur (in this 
order) immediately within the same 
declarative part, package specification, 
or task specification. The effect of 
this pragma is to use the value of the 
expression as the number of storage 


B-'.7 






units (bytes) to be allocated as guard 
storage. The value is rounded up to 
an appropriate boundary. A negative 
value causes the pragma to be ignored. 

A zero value has system-specific 
results: on VMS VAX systems, a value 
of zero results in no guard storage; 
on VMS AXP and ULTRIX systems, 
a value of zero results in a minimal 
guard area (see 13.2a). 

TIME_SLICE On VMS systems only. 

Takes a static expression of the 
predefined fixed point type DURATION 
(in the package STANDARD) as the 
single argument. This pragma is only 
allowed in the outermost declarative 
part of a library subprogram, and at 
most one such pragma is allowed in a 
library subprogram. It has an effect 
only when the subprogram to which 
it applies is used as a main program. 
This pragma causes the task scheduler 
to turn time slicing on or off and, on 
some systems, to limit the amount of 
continuous execution time given to a 
task 

(see 9.8a; see also the appropriate 
run-time reference manual for 
implementation differences across 
systems). 

TITLE Takes a title or a subtitle string, or 

both, as arguments. The pragma 
TITLE has the following form: 

pragma TITLE (titling-option 
I,titling-option]); 

titling-option := 

[TITLE =>] string_literal 
I (SUBTITLE =>) stringliteral 


B-18 





This pragma is allowed anywhere a 
pragma is allowed; the given strings 
supersede the default title and/or 
subtitle portions of a compilation 
listing. 

VOLATILE Takes the simple name of a variable 

as the single argument. This pragma 
is only allowed for a variable declared 
by an object declaration. The variable 
declaration and the pragma must 
both occur (in this order) immediately 
within the same declarative part or 
package specification. The pragma 
must appear before any occurrence of 
the name of the variable other than 
in an address clause or in one of the 
DEC Ada pragmas IMPORT_OBJECT, 
EXPORT_OB JECT, COMMON, 
OBJECT, or PS ECT_0 B J ECT. The 
variable cannot be declared by a 
renaming declaration. The pragma 
VOLATILE specifies that the variable 
may be modified asynchronously. This 
pragma instructs the compiler to obtain 
the value of a variable from memory 
each time it is used (see 9.11).

F.4 Restrictions on Representation Clauses 

The representation clauses allowed in DEC Ada are length, enumeration, 
record representation, and address clauses. 

In DEC Ada, a representation clause for a generic formal type or a type that 
depends on a generic formal type is not allowed. In addition, a representation 
clause for a composite type that has a component or subcomponent of a generic 
formal type or a type derived from a generic formal type is not allowed. 

F.5 Restrictions on Unchecked Type Conversions 

DEC Ada supports the generic function UNCHECKED_CONVERSION with 
the following restrictions on the class of types involved; 

• The actual subtype corresponding to the formal type TARGET must not be 
an unconstrained array type. 

• The actual subtype corresponding to the formal type TARGET must not be 
an unconstrained type with discriminants. 

Further, when the target type is a type with discriminants, the value resulting 
from a call of the conversion function resulting from an instantiation of 
UNCHECKED_CONVERSION is checked to ensure that the discriminants 
satisfy the constraints of the actual subtype. 


r r r>„.. 




r * r 




If the size of the source value is greater than the size of the target subtype, 
then the high order bits of the value are ignored (truncated); if the size of 
the source value is less than the size of the target subtype, then the value is 
extended with zero bits to form the result value. 

Conventions for Implementation-Generated Names 
Denoting Implementation-Dependent Components in 
Record Representation Clauses 

DEC Ada does not allocate implementation-dependent components in records. 

Interpretation of Expressions Appearing in Address 
Clauses 

Expressions appearing in address clauses must be of the type ADDRESS 
defined in the package SYSTEM (see 13.7a. 1 and F.3). In DEC Ada, values of 
type SYSTEM.ADDRESS are interpreted as virtual addresses in the machine’s 
address space. 

DEC Ada allows address clauses for objects and imported subprograms (see 
13.5). 

DEC Ada does not support interrupts as defined in section 13.5.1. 

On Open VMS systems, DEC Ada provides the pragma AST_ENTRY and the 
ASTJ3NTRY attribute as alternative mechanisms for handling asynchronous 
interrupts from the Open VMS operating system (see 9.12a). 

For information on handling ULTRIX signals, see the DEC Ada Run-Time 
Reference Manual for ULTRIX Systems. 

Implementation-Dependent Characteristics of 
Input-Output Packages 

In addition to the standard predefined input-output packages 
(SEQUENTIAL^, DIRECTJO, TEXTJO, and IO_EXCEPTIONS), DEC Ada 
provides packages for handling sequential and direct files with mixed-type 
elements: 

• SEQUENTIAL_MIXED_IO (see 14.2b.4). 

• DIRECT_MIXED_IO (see 14.2b.6). 


DEC Ada does not provide the low level input-output package described in this 
section. 




As specified in section 14.4, DEC Ada raises the following language-defined 
exceptions for error conditions that occur during input-output operations: 
STATUS.ERROR, MODE.ERROR, NAME.ERROR, USE.ERROR, END_ 
ERROR, DATA_ERROR, and LAYOUT_ERROR. DEC Ada does not raise the 
language-defined exception DEVICE_ERROR; device-related errors cause the 
exception USE_ERROR to be raised. 

The exception USEJERROR is raised under the following conditions: 

• If the capacity of the external file has been exceeded. 

• In all CREATE operations if the mode specified is IN_FILE. 

• In all CREATE operations if the file attributes specified by the FORM 
parameter are not supported by the package. 

• In all CREATE, OPEN, DELETE, and RESET operations if, for the 
specified mode, the environment does not support the operation for an 
external file. 

• In all NAME operations if the file has no name. 

• In the SET_LINE_LENGTH and SET_PAGE_LENGTH operations on text 
files if the lengths specified are inappropriate for the external file. 

• In text files if an operation is attempted that is not possible for reasons 
that depend on characteristics of the external file. 

DEC Ada provides other input-output packages that are available on specific 
systems. The following sections outline those packages. The following sections 
also give system-specific information about the overall set of DEC Ada 
input-output packages and input-output exceptions. 

F.8.1 DEC Ada Input-Output Packages on OpenVMS Systems 

On OpenVMS systems, the DEC Ada predefined packages and their operations 
are implemented using OpenVMS Record Management Services (RMS) 
file organizations and facilities. To give users the maximum benefit of the 
underlying RMS input-output facilities, DEC Ada provides the following 
Open VMS-specific packages; 

• RELATIVEJO (see 14.2a.3). 

• INDEXEDJO (see 14.2a.5). 

• RELATIVE_MIXED_IO (see 14.2b.8). 

• INDEXED_MIXED_IO (see 14.2b. 10). 

• AUX_IO_EXCEPTIONS (see 14.5a). 






The following sections summarize the implementation-dependent characteris¬ 
tics of the DEC Ada input-output packages. The DEC Ada Run-Time Reference 
Manual for OpenVMS Systems discusses these characteristics in more detail. 

F.8.1.1 Interpretation of the FORM Parameter on OpenVMS Systems 

On OpenVMS systems, the value of the FORM parameter may be a string 
of statements of the OpenVMS Record Management Services (RMS) File 
Definition Language (FDL), or it may be a string referring to a text file of FDL 
statements (called an FDL file). 

FDL is a special-purpose OpenVMS language for writing file specifications. 
These specifications are then used by DEC Ada run-time routines to create 
or open files. See the DEC Ada Run-Time Reference Manual for OpenVMS 
Systems for the rules governing the FORM parameter and for a general 
description of FDL. See the Guide to OpenVMS File Applications and the 
OpenVMS Record Management Utilities Reference Manual for complete 
information on FDL. 

On OpenVMS systems, each input-output package has a default string of FDL 
statements that is used to open or create a file. Thus, in general, specification 
of a FORM parameter is not necessary: it is never necessary in an OPEN 
procedure; it may be necessary in a CREATE procedure. The packages for 
which a value for the FORM parameter must be specified in a CREATE 
procedure are as follows: 

• The packages DIRECT_IO and RELATIVE_IO require that a maximum 
element (record) size be specified in the FORM parameter if the item with 
which the package is instantiated is unconstrained. 

• The packages DIRECT_MIXED_IO and RELATLVE.MIXED.IO require 
that a maximum element (record) size be specified in the FORM parameter. 

• The packages INDEXED_IO and INDEXED_MIXED_IO require that 
information about keys be specified in the FORM parameter. 

Any explicit FORM specification supersedes the default attributes of the 
governing input-output package. The DEC Ada Run-Time Reference Manual 
for OpenVMS Systems describes the default external file attributes of each 
input-output package. 

The use of the FORM parameter is described for each input-output package 
in chapter 14. For information on the default FORM parameters for each 
DEC Ada input-output package and for information on using the FORM 
parameter to specify external file attributes, see the DEC Ada Run-Time 
Reference Manual for OpenVMS Systems. For information on FDL, see the 
Guide to OpenVMS File Applications and the OpenVMS Record Management 
Utilities Reference Manual. 





F.8.1,2 Input-Output Exceptions on OpenVMS Systems 

In addition to the DEC Ada exceptions that apply on all systems, the following 
also apply on OpenVMS systems: 

• The DEC Ada exceptions LOCK_ERROR, EXISTENCE_ERROR, and KEY_ 
ERROR are raised for relative and indexed input-output operations. 

• The exception USE_ERROR is raised as follows in relative and indexed 
files: 

- In the WRITE operations on relative or indexed files if the element in 
the position indicated has already been written. 

- In the DELETE_ELEMENT operations on relative and indexed files if 
the current element is undefined at the start of the operation. 

- In the UPDATE operations on indexed files if the current element is 
undefined or if the specified key violates the external file attributes. 

• The exception NAME_ERROR is raised as specified in section 14.4: 
by a call of a CREATE or OPEN procedure if the string given fo; the 
NAME parameter does not allow the identification of an external file. On 
OpenVMS systems, the value of a NAME parameter can be a string that 
denotes a OpenVMS file specification or a OpenVMS logical name (in either 
case, the string names an external file). For a CREATE procedure, the 
value of a NAME parameter can also be a null string, in which case it 
names a temporary external file that is deleted when the main program 
exits. The DEC Ada Run-Time Reference Manual for OpenVMS Systems 
explains the naming of external files in more detail. 

• The exception LAYOUT_ERROR is raised as specified in section 14.4: in 
text input-output by COL, LINE, or PAGE if the value returned exceeds 
COUNT' LAST. The exception LAYOUT_ERROR is also raised on output by 
an attempt to set column or line numbers in excess of specified maximum 
line or page lengths, and by attempts to PUT too many characters to 

a string. In the DEC Ada mixed input-output packages, the exception 
LAYOUT_ERROR is raised by GET_ITEM if no more items can be read 
from the file buffer; it is raised by PUT_ITEM if the current position 
exceeds the file buffer size. 






F.8.2 Input-Output Packages on ULTRIX Systems 

On ULTRIX systems, the DEC Ada predefined packages and their operations 
are implemented using ULTRIX file facilities. DEC Ada provides no additional 
input-output packages specifically related to ULTRIX systems. 

The following sections summarize the ULTRIX-specific characteristics of the 
DEC Ada input-output packages. The DEC Ada Run-Time Reference Manual 
for ULTRIX Systems discusses these characteristics in more detail. 

F.8.2.1 Interpretation of the FORM Parameter on ULTRIX Systems 

On ULTRIX systems, the value of the FORM parameter must be a character 
string, defined as follows: 

string :"(field {,field}]" 

field ::=■> field_id => field_vaxue 

field_id : ■ BUFFER_SI7.E | ELEMENT_SIZE | FILE_DESCRIPTOR 

field_value : : ==> digit (digit) 

Depending on the fields specified, the value of the FORM parameter may 
represent one or more of the following: 

• The size of the buffer used during file operations. The field value specifies 
the number of bytes in the buffer. 

• The maximum element size for a direct file. The field value specifies the 
maximum number of bytes in the element. 

• An ULTRIX file descriptor for the Ada file being opened. The ULTRIX file 
descriptor must be open. 

If the file descriptor is not open, or if it refers to an Ada file that is 
already open, then the exception USEJERROR is raised. Note (hat the 
file descriptor option can be used only in the FORM parameter of an OPEN 
procedure. 

Each input-output package has an implementation-defined value form string 
that is used to open or create a file. Thus, in general, specification of a FORM 
parameter is not necessary. The packages for which a value for the FORM 
parameter must be specified in a CREATE procedure are as follows: 

• The package DIRECT_IO requires that a maximum element size be 
specified in the FORM parameter if the item with which the package is 
instantiated is unconstrained. 

• The package DIRECT_MIXED_IO requires that a maximum element size 
be specified in the FORM parameter. 






The use of the FORM parameter is described for each input-output package in 
chapter 14. For information on using the FORM parameter to specify external 
file attributes, see the DEC Ada Run-Time Reference Manual for ULTRIX 
Systems. 

F.8.2.2 Input-Output Exceptions on ULTRIX Systems 

In addition to the DEC Ada exceptions that apply on all systems, the following 
also apply on ULTRIX systems: 

• The exception NAME_ERROR is raised as specified in section 14.4: by a 
call of a CREATE or OPEN procedure if the string given for the NAME 
parameter does not allow the identification of an external file. On ULTRIX 
systems, the value of a NAME parameter can be a string that denotes an 
ULTRIX file specification. For a CREATE procedure, the value of a NAME 
parameter can also be a null string, in which case it names a temporary 
external file that is deleted when the main program exits. The DEC Ada 
Run-Time Reference Manual for ULTRIX Systems explains the naming of 
external files in more detail. 

• The exception LAYOUT_ERROR is raised as specified in section 14.4: in 
text input-output by COL, LINE, or PAGE if the value returned exceeds 
COUNT* LAST. The exception LAYOUT_ERROR is also raised on output by 
an attempt to set column or line numbers in excess of specified maximum 
line or page lengths, and by attempts to PUT too many characters to 

a string. In the DEC Ada mixed input-output packages, the exception 
LAYOUT_ERROR is raised by GETJTEM if no more items can be read 
from the file buffer; it is raised by PUT_ITEM if the current position 
exceeds the file buffer size. 

F.9 Other Implementation Characteristics 

Implementation characteristics relating to the definition of a main program, 
various numeric ranges, and implementation limits are summarized in the 
following sections. 

F.9.1 Definition of a Main Program 

DEC Ada permits a library unit to be used as a main program under the 
following conditions: 

• If it is a procedure with no formal parameters. 

On Open VMS systems, the status returned to the Open VMS environment 
upon normal completion of the procedure is the value 1. 

On ULTRIX systems, the status returned to the ULTRIX environment 
upon normal completion of the procedure is the value 0. 


CfH 




r no 




• If it is a function with no formal parameters whose returned value is of 
a discrete type. In this case, the status returned to the operating-system 
environment upon normal completion of the function is the function value. 

• If it is a procedure declared with the pragma EXPORT_VALUED_ 
PROCEDURE, and it has one formal out parameter that is of a discn ‘e 
type. In this case, the status returned to the operating-system environment 
upon normal completion of the procedure is the value of the first (and only) 
parameter. 

Note that when a main function or a main procedure declared with the pragma 
EXPORT_VALUED_PROCEDURE returns a discrete value whose size is less 
than 32 bits, the value is zero- or sign-extended as appropriate. 

F.9.2 Values of Integer Attributes 

The ranges of values for integer types declared in the package STANDARD are 
as follows: 


Integer type

Open VMS 





For the applicable input-output packages, the ranges of values for the types 
COUNT and POSITIVE.COUNT are as follows: 

COUNT 0 .. INTEGER' LAST 

POSITIVE_COUNT 1 .. INTEGER' LAST 

For the package TEXT_IO, the range of values for the type FIELD is as follows: 
FIELD 0 .. INTEGER' LAST
