Abstract 


ShipMo3D is an object-oriented library with associated user applications for predict¬ 
ing ship motions in calm water and in waves. This report serves as a user manual 
for creating ship models using ShipMo3D Version 3.0. A companion report serves 
as a user manual for predicting ship motions in the time and frequency domains. 
Version 3 of ShipMo3D introduces modelling of sloshing tanks and U-tube tanks. 
Several ShipMo3D applications are used for creating a ship. SM3DPanelHull creates 
a panelled representation of the wet and dry portions of the ship hull. SM3DRadDif 
computes radiation and diffraction forces acting on the wet hull using a bound¬ 
ary element method. SM3DPanelSloshTank creates a panelled representation of a 
sloshing tank, such as a tank containing liquid cargo or a roll stabilization tank. 
SM3DRadSloshTank computes sloshing forces arising from motions in the frequency 
domain. SM3DBuildShip creates a model of the ship that can be used for ship motion 
predictions in either the frequency domain or time domain.

Introduction: Ship motions influence the performance and safety of naval personnel 
and systems. Consequently, ship motion predictions are often used to support ship 
design and operation. Frequency domain predictions are computationally efficient 
and suitable for ships travelling with steady speed and heading in moderate seaways. 
Time domain analysis is required to model motions if a ship is freely maneuvering or 
in a heavy seaway. 

Principal Results: ShipMo3D is an object-oriented library with associated user ap¬ 
plications for predicting ship motions in calm water and in waves. Motion predictions 
are available in both the frequency domain and the time domain. For predictions in 
the time domain, the ship can be freely maneuvering in either calm water or in 
waves. This report serves as a user manual for creating ship models using Version 3. 
A companion report provides a user manual for predicting ship motions in the time 
and frequency domains using created ship models. ShipMo3D Version 3 introduces 
capabilities for modelling U-tube tanks and sloshing tanks. 

Significance of Results: ShipMo3D continues to be suitable for providing predic¬ 
tions of ship motions in waves. These simulations can be used for various applications, 
including engineering analysis, operations analysis, and training. 

Future Plans: ShipMo3D Version 3 will be incorporated into simulations modelling 
naval platform systems using the High Level Architecture.

Introduction : Les mouvements de navires ont une influence sur le rendement et la 
securite du personnel et des systemes navals. Par consequent, les previsions des mou¬ 
vements de navires sont souvent utilisees en appui a la conception et a Sexploitation 
des navires. Les previsions du domaine frequentiel sont efficaces pour revaluation 
et conviennent aux navires qui naviguent a vitesse continue et font cap dans des 
voies maritimes moyennement occupees. L’analyse du domaine temporel est requise 
pour modeliser les mouvements si un navire manoeuvre librement ou dans une voie 
maritime tres occupee. 

Resultats principaux : ShipMo3D est une bibliotheque objet avec applications 
utilisateur connexes permettant de prevoir les mouvements de navires en eau calme 
et dans les vagues. Les previsions des mouvements sont disponibles dans le domaine 
frequentiel et dans le domaine temporel. Pour les previsions dans le domaine temporel, 
le navire peut manoeuvrer librement en eau calme ou dans les vagues. Le present 
rapport sert de manuel de Lutilisateur pour la creation de modeles de navires en 
utilisant la version 3. Un rapport d’accompagnement fournit un manuel de Lutilisateur 
pour les previsions des mouvements de navires dans le domaine temporel et dans le 
domaine frequentiel, en utilisant des modeles de navires deja crees. La version 3 du 
logiciel ShipMo3D introduit des capacites permettant de modeliser des citernes a tube 
en U et des citernes a ballottement. 

Importance des resultats : ShipMo3D convient toujours pour la prevision des 
mouvements de navires dans les vagues. Les simulations peuvent etre utilisees pour 
differentes applications, y compris l’analyse technique, l’analyse des operations et la 
formation. 

Travaux ulterieurs prevus : La version 3 du logiciel ShipMo3D sera integree a des 
simulations modelisant des systemes de plate formes navales a l’aide de 1’architecture 
de haut niveau.

1 Introduction 


This report describes the creation of ship models for ShipMo3D Version 3.0, an object- 
oriented library with associated applications for simulation of a ship in waves. A com¬ 
panion report [1] is the user manual for predicting motions in the time and frequency 
domains using ShipMo3D Version 3.0. For each ShipMo3D application, user input 
is read from an ASCII input hie. Each application produces an ASCII output hie, 
and many applications also produce graphical output. The ShipMo3D graphical user 
interface (GUI), ShipMo3D30.exe, can be used to interactively prepare input data, 
launch applications, and view output results. 

Several reports describe the theory behind ShipMo3D, and also give verification and 
validation of ShipMo3D results. References 2 and 3 describe the prediction of hull hy¬ 
drodynamic forces. The modelling of seaways is described in Reference 4. Reference 5 
covers appendage and viscous forces, which are important for predicting lateral plane 
motions. The extension of ShipMo3D to freely maneuvering ships is described in 
Reference 6, with refinements to maneuvering forces given in Reference 7. ShipMo3D 
Version 3.0 introduces modelling of U-tube tanks [8] and sloshing in tanks with free 
surfaces [9]. Reference 10 gives validation results for Version 3.0 of ShipMo3D. 

Section 2 of this report describes features that are new for Version 3 of ShipMo3D. 
Section 3 gives an overview of creating ship models that can subsequently be used 
for motion predictions. Section 4 describes coordinate systems used for motions 
and ship geometry. Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 describe the ShipMo3D applica¬ 
tions SM3DPanclHull, SM3DRadDif, SM3DPanelSloshTank, SM3DRadSloshTank, 
and SM3DBuildShip, which are used to build models of the ship hull geometry, hull 
radiation and diffraction properties, sloshing tank geometry, sloshing tank radiation 
properties, and ship including appendages. Final conclusions are given in Section 10. 
Annexes at the end of the report give input hie descriptions and sample input and 
output hies for the ShipMo3D applications. 

2 New Features for ShipMo3D Version 3 


ShipMo3D Version 3 supercedes Version 2 [11, 12], Version 3 includes several major 
enhancements, and also has many minor code improvements.

2.1 High Frequency Approximation for Evaluating 
Retardation Functions 

When computing wave radiation damping forces in the time domain, retardation 
functions are used [3]. The retardation functions are computed from wave radiation 
damping coefficients evaluated in the frequency domain. ShipMo3D Version 3 uses 
the following high frequency approximation for damping coefficients when computing 
retardation functions within SM3DBuildShip: 

B i:j (uj e ) = Bijiuj*) exp {—2uj e /uj* e + 2) for uj e > uj* e (1) 

where Bij is frequency domain damping for motion modes i and j, u) e is wave en¬ 
counter frequency, and cu* is the highest encounter frequency for damping coefficients 
used for computing retardation functions. The above approximation helps to elimi¬ 
nate oscillatory behaviour of retardation functions at the maximum frequency c u*. 

The following high frequency approximation from Nam et al. [13] was originally con¬ 
sidered for implementation in ShipMo3D: 

Bij(uj e ) = Bijiuj*) (^pj for uj e > u* e (2) 

Equation (1) provides faster decay of damping coefficients at higher frequencies, and 
appears to give better modelling of actual behaviour. Note that Equations (1) and 
(2) give similar behaviour of the variation of damping coefficients with encounter 
frequency when encounter frequency uj e is approximately equal to the maximum fre¬ 
quency cu*. 

2.2 Modelling of U-tube Tanks for Roll Stabilization 

ShipMo3D can now model U-tube tanks for roll stabilization. Hydrodynamic forces 
are evaluated using the method of Lloyd [14], with ShipMo3D implementation de¬ 
scribed in Reference 8. Dimensions for U-tube tanks are given as input to SM3D- 
BuildShip. 

2.3 Modelling of Sloshing in Tanks with Free Surfaces 

ShipMo3D can now model sloshing in tanks with free surfaces. Examples of such 
tanks are cargo tanks and flume tanks for roll stabilization. SM3DPanelSloshTank 
builds a panelled representation of a sloshing tank. SM3DRadSloshTank computes 
sloshing hydrodynamic forces in the frequency domain based on the approaches of 
Malenica et al. [15] and Newman [16], with the ShipMo3D implementation described 
in Reference 9. Output sloshing tank data from SM3DRadSloshTank can be used as 
input to SM3DBuildShip when building ship models.

2.4 Application SM3DSeakeepSeawayFromRaos for 
Predicting Motions in a Seaway Using Input 
Response Amplitude Operators 

The new application SM3DSeakeepSeawayFromRaos [1] can predict motions in the 
frequency domain for a ship travelling in a seaway defined in earth-fixed axes. SM3D- 
SeakeepSeawayFromRaos reads pre-computed motion response amplitude operators 
(RAOs) which can be computed by SM3DSeakeepRandom. SM3DSeakeepSeaway- 
FromRaos runs faster than SM3DSeakeepSeaway [1], and is suitable for applications 
such as real-time operator guidance. 

2.5 Prediction of Motion Sickness Incidence in the 
Frequency Domain 

When predicting ship motions in the frequency domain, the applications SM3D- 
SeakeepRandom, SM3DSeakeepSeaway, and SM3DSeakeepSeawayFromRaos can now 
predict motion sickness incidence. Colwell [17] describes the approaches used for 
evaluating motion sickness incidence. 

2.6 Output of Motion Response Amplitude Operators 
for Operability Analysis Using SHIPOP2 

The frequency domain application SM3DSeakeepRandom [1] can now write motion 
response amplitude operators in SHIPM07 ASCII post-processing format, which can 
be used as input for operability analysis using SHIPOP2 [18].

3 Overview of Using ShipMo3D for Creating 
a Model of a Ship for Predicting Motions 


The following applications can be used when creating a ShipMo3D model of a ship: 

SM3DPanelHull: Develops a model of the hull surface represented using triangular 
and quadrilateral panels. Also computes hydrostatic properties for submerged 
portion of hull. 

SM3DRadDif: Computes hydrodynamic added mass and radiation damping for 
ship hull. Also computes forces due to incident and diffracted waves. 

SM3DPanelSloshTank: Develops a model of the the surface of a sloshing tank 
represented using triangular and quadrilateral panels. 

SM3DRadSloshTank: Computes sloshing tank hydrodynamic added mass and ra¬ 
diation damping. 

SM3DBuildShip: Builds a model of the ship including all components relevant to 
predicting ship motions. 

ShipMo3D: The ShipMo3D graphical user interface (ShipMo3D30.exe for Version 
3.0) can be used to prepare input data, launch the above applications, and view 
results. 

SM3DPanelHull creates a panel representation of the wetted hull surface based on in¬ 
put hull surface coordinates and load condition data. SM3DPanelHull can optionally 
produce a panel representation of the dry hull surface, which is required for non¬ 
linear simulations that consider the variation of the ship wetted surface with time. 
Ship hydrostatics and parameters for panel checking are included in output from 
SM3DPanelHull. Section 5 describes SM3DPanclHull in greater detail. 

The wet panelled hull produced by SM3DPanelHull is used as input for radiation 
and diffraction computations in SM3DRadDif. SM3DRadDif produces a database 
Hie that can be used for subsequent ship motion computations. The output from 
SM3DRadDif should ideally encompass all combinations of ship speed, wave head¬ 
ing, and wave frequency that a ship will encounter. Typical computations encompass¬ 
ing all relevant combinations can require 2-3 hours; however, once a radiation and 
diffraction database has been produced it can be used for simulations in a variety of 
conditions. Section 6 describes SM3DRadDif in greater detail. 

SM3DPanelSloshTank creates a panel representation of the wetted surface of the 
interior of a tank containing fluid. Output from SM3DPanelSloshTank can be used 


4 


DRDC Atlantic TM 2011-307 



for subsequent sloshing force computations. Section 8 describes SM3DRadSloshTank 
in greater detail. 

The wet panelled tank interior produced by SM3DPanelSloshTank is used as input 
for sloshing radiation computations in SM3DRadSloshTank. SM3DRadSloshTank 
produces a database hie that can be used for subsequent ship motion computations. 
The output from SM3DRadSloshTank should ideally encompass the full range of 
encounter frequencies that will influence ship motions. SM3DRadSloshTank typically 
requires less than one hour to run. Section 8 describes SM3DRadSloshTank in greater 
detail. 

SM3DBuildShip builds a model of a ship for ship motion computations. The radiation 
and diffraction database hie produced by SM3DRadDif is a key input component 
to SM3DBuildShip. if the ship includes sloshing tanks, then one or more sloshing 
radiation database hies produced by SM3DRadSloshTank can be given as inputs. 
Other program inputs include descriptions of appendages (bilge keels, rudders, foils, 
and skegs), propellers, U-tube tanks, and hull resistance. SM3DBuildShip can build a 
ship model for either simulation in the time domain or for predictions in the frequency 
domain using the applications described in Reference 1. 

The above ShipMo3D applications use 3 main types of hies. User input data are 
read from input hies with names ending with “.inp”. Application output data for re¬ 
view by the user are written to output hies with names ending with “.out”. Transfer 
of data between applications is typically done using hies in .NET binary serializa¬ 
tion format, with names ending with “.bin”. For hies representing a seaway, .NET 
XML serialization format is used to facilitate utilization by other applications such 
as visualizers. 

Each ShipMo3D application has default hie names for input and output. Prehxes can 
be added to default hie names by typing “-p PREFIX” as a command line option, 
where PREFIX is the specihed hie name prehx (e.g., the ship name). Alternatively, 
full input and output hie names can be specifed on the command line. Input hie 
names can be specihed by typing “-i INFILE” as a command line option, where 
INFILE is the specihed input hie name. Similarly, output hie names can be specihed 
by typing “-o OLITFILE” as a command line option, where OLITFILE is the specihed 
output hie name. The command line option “-h” shows any command line arguments 
associated with a ShipMo3D application. The command line option “-e” specihes that 
exceptions that occur during program execution should be fully written to the console. 
Table 1 summarizes command line options. 

ShipMo3D user input hies are in ASCII format. Each input line typically begins with 
a tag denoting the contents of the input line. Comments can be inserted into a hie 
using the character “ 7 ^” to denote a comment line or the beginning of a comment 
after other input on a line. An exclamation mark “!” denotes that an input line is

4 Coordinate Systems 


ShipMo3D uses both earth-fixed and translating earth coordinate systems. Figure 1 
shows a ship in an earth-fixed coordinate system. The location of the ship centre of 
gravity in the horizontal plane is given by x* . The direction v of incident waves 
is given using a “from” convention, with 0° representing waves from north and 90° 
representing waves from east. Ship heading \ is given using a “to” convention, with 
0° representing the ship heading north and 90° representing the ship heading east. 

A translating earth coordinate system, shown in Figure 2 , is used for representing 
ship motions in heave, roll, and pitch, and also for frequency domain applications. 
Heave rj 3 is the vertical displacement (+ upward) of the ship centre of gravity relative 
to its position when the ship is in calm water; thus, the mean heave is typically near 
zero. Ship pitch y 5 of a freely maneuvering ship is given relative to its position at 
heading y, and ship roll y 4 is given relative to the instantaneous heading angle x and 
pitch angle y 5 of the moving ship. 

Wave diffraction computations using SM3DRadDif are based on relative sea direction 
/3 S as shown in Figure 3 (180° for head seas, 90° for seas from port). Relative sea 
direction is related to ship heading and wave heading by: 

Ps = V + 180° - x (3) 


For deflections of rudders, ShipMo3D uses a convention of positive deflection when 
counter-clockwise as viewed from inside the hull. Consequently, positive deflection of 
a typical ship rudder pointing downward will cause a ship to turn starboard.

Tabic 2 gives a summary of the application SM3DPanclHull. Figure 4 shows an 
example wet panel hull created by SM3DPanelHull. The panel colours indicate the 
elevation of the centroid of each panel relative to the waterline.

Like all ShipMo3D applications, SM3DPanelHull reads user input from a hie. The 
format of the main SM3DPanelHull input hie is given in Annex A.l. SM3DPanelHull 
also reads data from a patch hull hie, which has hull coordinate data. Annex A. 2 
describes the format of the patch hull hie. The patch hull hie is a reference description 
of the hull geometry, while the main input hie is used to control how panels are 
generated to model the hull geometry. Ideally, the patch hull hie only has to be 
developed once, and then can be left as a permanent representation of the hull. In 


10 


DRDC Atlantic TM 2011-307 




contrast, the main input file can vary depending on the ship loading condition and 
how the user wants the hull to be panelled. 


5.1 Hull Description Using a Patch Hull File 

The patch hull hie models the hull as a series of patches, with a patch being a 
continuous surface. For example, an ellipsoid could be modelled by a single patch. 
As a more complex example, Figures 5 and 6 show the hull lines and fitted surfaces 
for the generic frigate used as an example for this report. The main portion of the 
hull is red, the deck is green, and the transom consists of blue and cyan portions. 

Each patch is represented by a series of successive hull lines. A hull patch must have 
at least 2 hull lines. Each hull line must have at least 1 point. For example, a patch 
representing a bulbous bow could have a hull line with a single point at the front, 
followed by additional hull lines each having several points. 

Figure 7 shows an example of a hull line on the main portion of the hull. The ship is 
assumed to be symmetric about the centreline; thus, offset points are only given for 
the port side of the hull. For a hull line intersecting the waterline, successive points 
should generally have increasing elevation. The hull line in Figure 7 can be described 
as follows in the patch hull hie:

The input record “stations” gives the station of each point on the hull line. Station 
0 represents the fore perpendicular, and station 20 (or sometimes 10) typically rep¬ 
resents the aft perpendicular. Note that the offsets on a hull line do not need to all 
have the same station. The input record “yOffsets” gives lateral offsets, which should 
all be >= 0.0 because only the port side of the hull is modelled. The input record 
“zOffsets” gives vertical offsets relative to the baseline. The baseline is a straight 
line, and typically represents the elevation of the keel for a substantial portion of a 
ship. 

Figure 8 shows a profile of a hull patch representing the main portion of a ship 
hull. The patch consists of 6 hull lines, with the first hull line (index 0) representing 
the foremost point on the ship. For correct evaluation of hull surface normals, it is 
essential that hull lines be arranged in the direction indicated by Figure 9. To assist 
with correct panelling of the hull surface from patch data, user input for a patch

Figure 7: Hull Line within Patch Hull File, View from Aft 

includes valid ranges of normal components. ShipMo3D uses a convention of hull 
normals pointing outward from the hull. 

In summary, the following should be observed when creating a patch hull hie: 

• For non-horizontal hull lines, the order of offset points should go from lower to 
higher elevation. 

• The order of successive hull lines must be given to satisfy the hull normal 
convention of Figure 9. 

Table 3 gives guidelines for patch representations of different parts of a hull.

Main hull surface Offsets on a hull line go from keel to port deck edge. 

Successive hull lines go from bow to stern. 

Deck Offsets on a hull line go from port deck edge to centreline.

If the patch hull is going to be used to build both wet and dry panelled hulls, then 
the patch hull should represent a closed volume. If only a wet panelled hull will be 
built, then it is not necessary to enclose the dry portion of the hull. 

Each input patch includes an optional input parameter to limit the maximum size of 
panels representing the patch. This parameter can be useful for portions of the hull 
surface with smaller curvature radii (e.g., bulbous bows) that require smaller panels 
than the remainder of the hull surface. 

5.2 Control of Panelling of the Hull 

The main input hie for SM3DPanelHull controls panelling of the hull described by 
the patch hull hie. SM3DPanelHull panels the wet hull, and optionally panels the 
dry hull. Figure 10 shows the ship vertical coordinates. When giving the input load 
condition, the user can provide one of the following sets of input data: 

• draft of baseline at midships (draftBIMid) and trim of the baseline by the stern 
(trimBIStern), 

• displacement of the ship (dispTonnesInput) and the longitudinal distance from 
the fore perpendicular to the the centre of gravity (distanceFPCGInput). 

If the displacement and LCG are provided as input, then an iterative procedure is 
used to determine the combination of draft and trim that produces a wet panelled 
hull with the correct displacement and LCG. 



Figure 10: Ship Vertical Coordinates, View from Starboard 

SM3DPanelHull fits smooth B-spline surfaces [19] to hull patches described by input 
hull lines. If difficulties are encountered with a fitted surface (e.g., a normal vector 
has unexpected direction or a y coordinate is less than zero) then these can often be 


DRDC Atlantic TM 2011-307 


15 








resolved by dividing the patch in the vicinity of a hull line where the difficulties are 
encountered. 

The panel area limit areaPanelLimit is one of the most important input parameters for 
SM3DPanelHull. For typical ship geometries, it is recommended that areaPanelLimit 
be selected such that the wet portion of the hull surface is represented by 200-500 
panels on the port side. 

SM3DPanelHull can produce plots such as those given in Figures 4, 5, and 6. These 
plots are very useful for checking the quality of a hull model. For the plots of the 
patch hull surfaces and hull panels, the interior of the hull is black, which can be 
useful for checking that hull normals are oriented correctly. 

The SM3DPanelHull output hie gives values for checking the quality of the panelled 
hull mesh, such as normal ranges for hull patches. The output hie also gives closure 
errors for the hull in the x and z directions, such as the following from the sample 
output hie: 


**** CHECK OF CLOSURE FOR COMBINED WET AND DRY HULL **** 

Calculated properties for checking combined mesh of wet and dry hull 
Closure error sum of area*nx : 0.183245 m2 

Closure error/approx front area : 0.001146 

Closure error sum of area*nz : 0.100498 m2 

Closure error/approx top area : 0.000110 

The non-dimensional closure errors should typically be less than 0.01.

6 Radiation and Diffraction Computations - 
SM3DRadDif 


Tabic 4 gives a summary of the application SM3DRadDif, which computes hydrody¬ 
namic forces due to added mass, wave radiation damping, and wave excitation from 
incident and diffracted waves. Computations are performed in the frequency domain; 
however, results can be transformed to the time domain for subsequent computa¬ 
tions. Due to the complexities of ship hydrodynamic computations, SM3DRadDif 
is considered to be the most computationally intensive of ShipMo3D applications. 
The approach used for computing hull hydrodynamic forces is described in detail in 
References 2 and 3. 


Table 4: SM3DRadDif Summary 


Purpose: 


Run time: 


Default input hie: 


Creates a database of added mass, radiation 
damping, and wave excitation forces for the ship in 
all conditions to be encountered in subsequent 
motion computations. 

Several minutes without wave diffraction 
computations. 

Up to several hours with full wave diffraction 
computations. 

radDif3.inp 


Default output hie: radDif3.out 

Sample hies and hie format: Annex B 


Other required input: Wet panelled hull created by SM3DPanclHull. 


SM3DRadDif computes hull added mass and radiation damping for a range of en¬ 
counter frequencies specihed by user input. Figure 11 shows computed added mass 
and damping for a naval frigate. The input encounter frequencies should be selected 
such that the variation of added mass and damping with encounter frequency is 
captured for all 6 degrees of freedom. The main output hie from SM3DRadDif and 
optional plot hies of hydrodynamic coefficients can be examined to determine whether 
a suitable range of encounter frequencies has been used. Both the output hie and 
plot hies give non-dimensional coefficients with magnitude relative to the ship inertia 
force amplitude during sinusoidal motion. At the highest encounter frequency, added 
mass should approach its inhnite frequency value and damping should approach zero. 
For naval frigates, an encounter frequency range of 0.1, 0.2, ..., 6.0 rad/s is suitable. 
Froude scaling can be applied to determine suitable encounter frequency ranges for 


DRDC Atlantic TM 2011-307 


17 




ships of other sizes. 


Like most hydrodynamic panel codes, SM3DRadDif will have irregular frequencies 
associated with each wet panel hull. An irregular frequency is a frequency at which the 
solution of hull source strengths and hull associated velocity potentials gives unreliable 
results. To better understand irregular frequencies, note that source strengths on the 
hull are solved by satisfying the following: 


[D] M 



( 4 ) 


where [D\ is the influence matrix giving hull normal velocity from source strengths, 
{a} is the vector of source strengths to be solved, and {d(p/dn} is the vector of known 
normal velocities on the hull surface. At irregular frequencies, the solution of source 
strengths {a} is highly sensitive to variations in elements of the influence matrix 
[D]. Variations in computed source strengths {a} will lead to variations in computed 
velocity potentials {(/>}, which are evaluated using the following: 


M = [E\ {a} 


( 5 ) 


where [ E] is the influence matrix giving velocity potential from source strength. 


SM3DRadDif uses lateral symmetry when solving for hydrodynamic coefficients; thus, 
longitudinal modes have one set of irregular frequencies and lateral modes have an¬ 
other set of irregular frequencies. When examining plots of added mass and/or damp¬ 
ing versus encounter frequency, large local variations occur at irregular frequencies. 


18 


DRDC Atlantic TM 2011-307 






Similarly, an irregular frequency will usually have a large local increase in the con¬ 
dition number of matrix [£)] from Equation (4). To prevent SM3DRadDif from us¬ 
ing computations at irregular frequencies, user input can include threshold matrix 
condition numbers indicating the presence of irregular frequencies. The threshold 
matrix condition numbers can be determined by examining the results of an initial 
SM3DRadDif run. 

The most time consuming part of running SM3DRadDif is usually the evaluation 
of wave diffraction forces. Note that wave diffraction forces should be evaluated for 
all combinations of ship speed, heading, and wave frequency that a ship is likely to 
encounter. For a naval frigate, an input ship speed range of 0, 5, 10, ..., 40 knots 
can be used. Note that the upper speed should include the influence of wave-induced 
surge motion for a freely maneuvering ship. An input relative sea direction range of 
0, 15, 30, ..., 180 degrees is suitable for any ship. An input wave frequency range of 
0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 2.0 rad/s usually is sufficient for the range of seaways encountered 
by full-scale ships. 

SM3DRadDif includes an option for suppressing diffraction computations. The pri¬ 
mary purpose of this option is to permit checking for irregular frequencies before 
proceeding with time-consuming diffraction computations. It is suggested that the 
following sequence be used when using SM3DRadDif for a new wet panel hull: 

1. Run SM3DRadDif with diffraction computations suppressed. 

2. Check output for irregular frequencies and re-run SM3DRadDif with appropri¬ 
ate thresholds on matrix condition numbers. 

3. Check revised output for irregular frequencies. If irregular frequencies still exist, 
repeat step 2 with revised matrix condition numbers. If no irregular frequencies 
remain, then run SM3DRadDif including diffraction computations. 

As indicated above, SM3DRadDif can produce plots of non-dimensional hydrody¬ 
namic coefficients and matrix condition numbers. These plots are very useful when 
checking for irregular frequencies.

7 Panelling of a Sloshing Tank -

Purpose: 


Run time: 

Default input file: 

Default output file: 

Sample files and file format: 


Creates a panel representation of the interior of wet 
sloshing tank, and optionally of the dry sloshing 
tank. 

Several seconds. 
panelSloshTank3.inp 
panelSloshTank3.out 
Annex C 


Other required input: Patch sloshing tank exterior hie developed by user. 

This hie is only required if the sloshing tank has a 
complex shape. 


Like all ShipMo3D applications, SM3DPanelSlosliTank reads user input from a hie. 
The format of the main SM3DPanelSloshTank input hie is given in Annex C.l. Fig¬ 
ure 12 shows dimensions for a simple sloshing tank with a rectangular cross-section. 
SM3DPanelSloshTank can easily model a box-shaped sloshing tank or a tank with a 
narrow middle (see Figure 13) using minimal input. 

For modelling of more complex tank geometries, SM3DPanclSloshTank can read data 
for a patch representation of the tank, which is similar to the patch representation 
of a hull read by SM3DPanelHull. Annex C.2 describes the format of the patch 
sloshing tank hie. To simplify creation of the patch sloshing tank input hie, the hie 
uses a geometric convention to specify the exterior of the sloshing tank (i.e., normal 
vectors point outward from the sloshing tank, which is the same convention as used 
for a patch hull hie). SM3DPanelSloshTank then performs the required conversion 
to obtain the geometries of panels representing the interior of the tank. 

Guidelines for panelling and the ship hull (see Section 5) are applicable to panelling 
of a sloshing tank. It is recommended that a minimum of 200 panels be used to model 
the wetted port side of a sloshing tank.

8 Radiation Computations for a Sloshing 
Tank - SM3DRadSloshTank 


Tabic 6 gives a summary of the application SM3DRadSloshTank, which computes 
hydrodynamic forces acting on a sloshing tank due to added mass and wave radiation 
damping. Computations are performed in the frequency domain; however, results can 


be transformed to the time domain for subsequent computations. The approach used 


for computing sloshing hydrodynamic forces is described in detail in Reference 9.

Other required input: Wet panelled sloshing tank created by 


SM3DPanelSloshTank. 


SM3DRadSloshTank computes sloshing tank added mass and radiation damping for 
a range of encounter frequencies specihed by user input. Figure 14 shows computed 
added mass and damping for a box with length of 4 m, width of 4 m, and fluid height 
of 2 m. The input encounter frequencies should be selected such that the variation 
of added mass and damping with encounter frequency is captured for sloshing modes 
that will influence the motions of the ship. When selecting the range of encounter 
frequencies, it can be useful to consider the following analytical solution for sloshing 
natural frequencies of a box of width w tan k subject to sway motion [20]: 



( 6 )

\ slosh

Wtank 


where n is the sloshing mode number. The sway sloshing added mass and damping 
coefficients for a box-shaped tank will typically vary significantly in the vicinity of 
sloshing frequencies for odd-numbered modes (n = 1, 3, 5,...). Computations suggest 
that 0.02 uif osh j g a su itable value for both the minimum encounter frequency and 
encounter frequency increment, and that 4 uj^ osh is a suitable value for the maximum 
encounter frequency. 


DRDC Atlantic TM 2011-307 


23 






Figure 14: Sway Sloshing Added Mass and Damping for Box with Length of 4 m, 
Width of 4 m, and Fluid Height of 2 m 


The main output file from SM3DRadSloshTank and optional plot files of hydrody¬ 
namic coefficients can be examined to determine whether a suitable range of encounter 
frequencies has been used. Both the output file and plot hies give non-dimensional 
coefficients with magnitude relative to the static mass inertia force amplitude during 
sinusoidal motion. 


An approach similar to that developed by Malenica et al. [15] is used to model viscous 
effects within a sloshing tank. The normal how boundary condition on the wetted 
tank walls is modified to include an empirical damping factor et an k as follows: 


d(pf osh 

dn

l UJ e Uj +

( 8 ) 


where <j)d osh is sloshing potential in the frequency domain for ship motion mode j, 
n~j l is the normal vector pointing into the tank fluid, Vfi U id is the volume of fluid in 
the tank, and St is the wetted interior tank surface. Viscous effects are likely to be 
insignificant at zero and infinite frequency limits; thus, the empirical damping factor 
is modelled to be dependent on frequency as follows:

where e ta nk is the peak value of the damping factor, which is applicable at frequen¬ 
cies ranging from c o e lower to w e upper - It is suggested that uJ f lower and uj e upper be selected 
such that they encompass the main sloshing frequencies of the tank, which can be 
determined by examining the variation of added mass with frequency. For example, 
ca lower can b e se t f° half °f the first sloshing mode frequency and 0J e upper can be set to 
the maximum frequency used for sloshing computations. 

Like SM3DRadDif, SM3DRadSloshTank can remove irregular frequencies caused by 
ill-conditioned solutions for sloshing velocity potentials; however, work to date sug¬ 
gests that irregular frequencies will typically not occur when solving sloshing velocity 
potentials. 

Input for SM3DRadSloshTank includes the delay time increment Ar and delay time 
maximum T max for sloshing retardation functions, which are used for ship motion 
computations in the frequency domain. Recommended values are At = 0.25 /ujf osh 
and r max = 120/ujf osh . SM3DRadSloshTank includes an option for correcting slosh¬ 
ing retardation functions to account for the finite maximum delay time T max . It is 
recommended that this option be used, with care being taken to specify a sufficiently 
large number of T max to capture the essential behaviour of the retardation function. 

The location of a sloshing tank on a ship is not specified as input for SM3DPanel- 
SloshTank or SM3DRadSloshTank. Instead, the tank location is specified as input to 
SM3DBuildShip. This approach allows the tank location on the ship to be changed 
without re-running SM3DPanelSloshTank or SM3DRadSloshTank.

9 Building of Ship Model - SM3DBuildShip 


Table 7 gives a summary of application SM3DBuildShip, which creates a database of 
all relevant ship properties used for computation of ship motions. Figure 15 shows 
a sample view of a hull and appendages produced by SM3DBuildShip. SM3DBuild- 
Ship can build ship models for simulation in the time domain or for predictions in 
the frequency domain.

Sample hies and hie format: Annex E 


Other required input: Hull radiation and diffraction database created by 

SM3DRadDif. 

Dry panel hull hie if nonlinear buoyancy and incident 
wave forces will be used for ship motion predictions. 


A dry panel hull hie is among the optional input parameters for SM3DBuildShip. 
Note that this option must be used if ship motion predictions with SM3DFreeMo will 
include nonlinear buoyancy and incident wave forces. 

SM3DBuildShip includes optional input for adjusting the metacentric height of the 
ship. This parameter can be set to a negative value to model the influence of partially 
filled tanks on roll stiffness. Note that such a correction for partially filled tanks is 
only required if they have not been explicitly modelled as U-tube tanks or sloshing 
tanks within ShipMo3D. 

Input radii of gyration for roll, pitch, and yaw are given as values for the dry ship, 
and do not include the influence of ship added mass. Estimates of radii of gyration 
are as follows: 


r 44 

~ 0.4 B max

r 5 5 

» 0.25 L

r 6 6

Figure 15: Panelled Hull Appendages, and Propellers of Generic Frigate from 
SM3DB uildShip 


where r 44 is roll radius of gyration, r 55 is pitch radius of gyration, and r 66 is yaw 
radius of gyration. If the ship natural roll period is known but the ship roll gyradius 
is unknown, it is recommended that SM3DBuildShip be run with several different 
input gyradius values to determine which value produces the correct natural roll 
period. 

For time domain predictions of ship motions, wave radiation forces are evaluated using 
retardation functions. The retardation functions are determined using transforms 
of wave radiation forces in the frequency domain. SM3DBuildShip reads input for 
the time interval and maximum value of retardation functions. The time interval 
should be sufficiently fine to capture the variation of retardation functions, and the 
maximum value should encompass the time when retardation functions approach 
zero. For a naval frigate, a time interval of 0.2 s and maximum time of 20 s provide 
good representation of retardation functions. Suitable values for other ships can be 
estimated using Froude scaling as follows: 



where At is the time interval and r max is the maximum time for retardation functions.

9.1 Hull Viscous Forces 


Viscous hull force input is given in the form of hull resistance coefficients for various 
speeds, an eddy-making roll damping coefficient, and a lateral drag coefficient. Ref¬ 
erences 5, 6 and 7 give further discussion of hull viscous forces. The hull resistance 
force is evaluated as follows: 

Fr ist = — l -pU\U\A w C Dx {U) (16) 

where U is the ship speed, A w is the wetted surface area, and C^x is the hull resistance 
coefficient. 

Hull eddy-making damping at zero speed is evaluated by: 

F .= -\p M >74 C3‘ l [ n\ vV + z 2 dS (17) 

2 Z JShM 

where C^ y is the hull eddy-making coefficient for roll, Shull is the wetted hull surface, 
and n 4 is the roll normal. At non-zero speed, a speed correction factor is applied. 
The hull eddy-making coefficient has a default value of 1.17, the drag coefficient for 
a flat plate moving perpendicular to flow. Note that hull eddy-making damping is 
typically a small fraction of roll damping; thus, roll motion predictions are usually 
not very sensitive to the value of the hull eddy-making coefficient. 

ShipMo3D can model hull cross-flow drag as follows: 

Nseg 

K°” = £ «'”“(**-,) \v m “(XAy-i)\ Ay^C'D, (18) 

2—1 

where N seg is the number of longitudinal segments along the hull for evaluating cross- 
flow drag, v cross is cross-flow velocity, XA y ~i is the x centroid of the profile area of 
segment i, A y _ t is the profile area of segment i, and Cr> y is the hull cross-flow drag 
coefficient. Within ShipMo3D, the hull cross-flow drag coefficient is often set to 
zero because cross-flow drag forces are instead modelled using nonlinear maneuvering 
coefficients. If nonlinear maneuvering coefficients are not used to model cross-flow 
drag, then the cross-flow drag coefficient can be set to a value of approximately 1.0. 

9.2 Hull Maneuvering Forces 

References 6 and 7 provide background information for prediction of hull maneuver¬ 
ing forces. The user can provide input hull maneuvering coefficients or can use values 
predicted based on the method of Inoue et ah [21], As discussed in Reference 6, there 
is significant uncertainty associated with hull maneuvering coefficients and resulting 


28 


DRDC Atlantic TM 2011-307 



hull maneuvering predictions. Most notably, the uncertainty in the linear yaw-yaw 
coefficient N r can lead to significant uncertainty in predicted ship turning circle char¬ 
acteristics. Consequently, it is recommended that the best possible estimates of hull 
maneuvering force coefficients be provided as input. If maneuvering force coefficients 
are unavailable but maneuvering trial data exist, then one can consider modifying 
the yaw-yaw coefficient N r to obtain good agreement between observed and predicted 
turning circles. 

9.3 Ship Appendages - Bilge Keels, Static Foils, 
Skegs, and Rudders 

Ship appendages significantly influence ship motions in sway, roll, and yaw. SM3D- 
BuildShip currently models bilge keels, static foils (e.g., propeller shaft brackets), 
skegs, and rudders. If modelling of roll stabilizer fins is required, then these can 
be input as additional rudders. References 5 and 6 discuss treatment of appendage 
forces. 

Bilge keels and skegs are considered to have long chord lengths, with input dimensions 
provided at several longitudinal locations along the hull. Static foils and rudders are 
considered to have short chord lengths, with input dimensions provided at only a 
single longitudinal location. Figure 16 shows an appendage attached to a hull. The 
convention for dihedral angle is 0° for the appendage pointing to port and 90° for the 
appendage point upward. Rudders and skegs typically have dihedral angles of —90°. 
Port bilge keels typically have dihedral angles of approximately —45°, and starboard 
bilge keels typically have dihedral angles of approximately —135°. Figure 17 shows 
dimensions for a static foil or rudder, where c root is the root chord length, Cu p is the 
tip chord length, and s is the span. 

When predicting lateral plane ship motions, one of the greatest challenges is accurate 
prediction of viscous roll damping from bilge keels. It is recommended that Ikeda’s 
method [5] be used for predicting viscous bilge keel damping. 

To simplify input and reduce the possibility of input errors, the user can specify that 
input is being given for a pair of appendages. The user then provides input data for 
only the port appendage. SM3DBuildShip then generates a port appendage first, and 
a starboard appendage second. 

For rudders, SM3DBuildShip requires input autopilot data. The rudder response 
characteristics are modelled as follows: 

o + 2 Q UJ S d + o = UJ S d c (19) 

where S rudder is rudder acceleration, (s is the nondimensional damping response con¬ 
stant, c os is the rudder response natural frequency, § rudder is rudder velocity, and

^rudder £] ie command rudder angle. Rudder deflections have a convention of pos¬ 
itive for counter-clockwise deflection viewed from inside the hull. If the rudder is 
operating in autopilot mode, then the rudder command angle is determined by input 
autopilot gains and ship motions in earth-fixed axes: 



where is the proportional gain for mode j, r/- is the motion displacement in earth- 
fixed axes for mode j , Tj C] is the command motion displacement for mode j , k^ is 
the integral gain for mode j, r”^ £ der is the integration duration, t is the current time, 
r is the time delay for integration, kgj is the derivative gain for mode j, and f)- is 
the motion velocity in earth-fixed axes for mode j. Within SM3DBuildShip, input 
autopilot gains should always be given in terms of earth-fixed axes. 


The simulation of a rudder control system including autopilot requires selection of 
suitable input values. For a US Coast Guard cutter representative of modern frigate 
design, Smith [22] indicates a maximum rudder deflection of 35 degrees and maximum 
rudder rate of 3 degrees per second. For modelling of a conventional downward 
rudder using ShipMo3D, the autopilot yaw gain and yaw velocity gain for a freely 
maneuvering ship will typically have values less than or equal to zero. 


The natural frequency of rudder control systems is often significantly greater than 
the natural frequencies for ship motion modes; thus, a smaller time step is often 
required for rudder motions than for ship motions during time domain simulations. 
The user can specify a maximum allowable time step for rudder motions to ensure 
reliable prediction of rudder motions. 


9.4 Propellers (Non-azimuthing) 

SM3DBuildShip can model fixed pitch propellers as described in Reference 6. The 
thrust created by the propeller is modelled as: 

= (1 - Vop) P n lrop K T (Jprop) (21) 

where t prop is the propeller thrust deduction coefficient, n prop is the propeller speed 
in revolutions per second, and D prop is the propeller diameter. The propeller thrust 
coefficient Kt is a function of the advance coefficient J pr 0 p, which is given by: 

t _ U (1 — w prop ) 

J prop — n 

flj prop Uprop 

where w prop is the propeller wake fraction. The following quadratic function is used to 
model the relationship between propeller thrust coefficient K T and advance coefficient 


DRDC Atlantic TM 2011-307 


31 





Jprop • 

K T = K° T + K j t J prop + K j t j J 2 prop (23) 

where Kj>, K and K^ J are specified coefficients. The user can provide K^, K^, and 
Kj, J as input values, or these values can be computed based on 3 input pairs of J pr0 p 
and K r ( Jprop ) • 

To simplify input and reduce the possibility of input errors, the user can specify that 
input is being given for a pair of propellers. The user then provides input data for 
only the port propeller. SM3DBuildShip then generates a port propeller first, and a 
starboard propeller second. 

The propeller control system is modelled very similarly to the rudder control system, 
with the rate of change of propeller RPM being modelled as follows: 

RPM pr ° P = c4 pm {RPM p c rop - RPM prop )~ 2 ( RPM u RPM RPM pr ° P (24) 

where RPM is the second derivative with respect to time of propeller RPM, 
ojrpm is the RPM response natural frequency, RPMf! op is command propeller RPM, 
RPM prop is propeller RPM, Crpm is RPM response damping, and RPM P '° P is the first 
derivative with respect to time of propeller RPM. The user can specify a maximum 
allowable time step for simulation of propeller RPM in a manner similar to that used 
for rudder deflection. 

9.5 Rudder-Propeller Interaction Coefficients 

For rudders placed aft of propellers, flow from propellers can significantly increase the 
effectiveness of the rudders. This effect is modelled using rudder-propeller interaction 
coefficients, as described in Reference 7, which supercedes the treatment presented 
in Reference 6. The rudder-propeller interaction coefficient represents the effective 
fraction of the rudder area that lies within the propeller slipstream. For a rudder 
immediately behind a propeller with the rudder locating entirely within the propeller 
slipstream, the rudder-propeller interaction coefficient will approach its limiting value 
of 1.0. If a rudder is located away from the propeller slipstream, then the rudder- 
propeller interaction coefficient will approach zero. 

9.6 Azimuthing Propellers 

ShipMo3D can model azimuthing propellers, which were introduced in Version 2. 
The treatment of azimuthing propellers is described in Reference 23. It should be 
noted ShipMo3D motion predictions for ships with azimuthing propellers haven’t 
been validated yet with experimental ship motion data. 


32 


DRDC Atlantic TM 2011-307 


ShipMo3D uses the approach of Stettler, Hover, and Triantafyllou [24] for modelling 
the forces on an azimuthing propeller. Figure 18 shows the forces acting on a repre¬ 
sentative azimuthing propeller. The propeller has an azimuthal deflection of S. The 
effective incident flow velocity relative to the propeller is V az i prop , which includes con¬ 
tributions from the ship speed, the wave-induced ship motions, and incident waves. 
The total flow attack angle is a az i prop , which includes the effect of both the incident 
flow direction and the azimuthal deflection of the propeller. The azimuthing propeller 
produces a thrust force F T along the axial direction of the propeller, and a normal 
force F N . Experimental data published by Brandner and Renilson [25], Stettler et al. 
[24], and Islam et al. [26] indicate that the normal force component can be surprisingly 
large.

where F T is the thrust force, n aziprop is the rotations per second, D aziprop is the 
diameter, Kt is thrust force coefficient, and is normal force coefficient. The 
advance coefficient is given by:

DRDC Atlantic TM 2011-307

Once the thrust and normal forces have been evaluated, the forces in ship-based 
axes are evaluated. For example, the ship-based forces from a standard azimuthing 
propeller with vertical orientation T of —90° are: 

paziprop _ ^ _ taz . prop ) (> T COS (5 - F N sillh) (28) 

F aziprop = pT gin5 + pN ^ g ( 29 ) 

where F® ziprop i s the surge force and p^ ziprop j s the sway force acting on the ship. 

The influence of the hull on the incident flow velocity V aziprop is modelled using a 
wake fraction w aziprop which is applied to flow along the ship longitudinal axis and a 
flow straightening coefficient 'jaziprop which is applied to flow along the ship transverse 
axis. 

Figures 19 and 20 show representative thrust and normal force coefficients for an 
azimuthing propeller. The data in these figures are based primarily on experimental 
data presented by Islam et al. [26]. 

9.7 U-tube Tanks and Sloshing Tanks 

ShipMo3D Version 3 introduces capabilities for modelling U-tube tanks and sloshing 
tanks. The treatment of sloshing tanks is described in Sections 7 and 8. The modelling 
of U-tube tanks within ShipMo3D is described in detail in Reference 8. Figure 21 
shows an aft view of a U-tube tank, including the fluid displacement angle r, which is 
introduced as an additional degree of freedom when solving ship motions. Figure 22 
shows ShipMo3D input dimensions for a U-tube tank. 

If a ship includes a U-tube tank or sloshing tank, then the tank fluid mass should 
be included when specifying location of the ship centre of gravity. The influence of a 
tank on effective metacentric height does not need to be considered when specifying 
the metacentric height correction for a ship if the tank is explicitly described using 
input for a U-tube tank or sloshing tank. 

9.8 Computation of Ship Propeller RPM for Specified 
Ship Speeds 

SM3DBuildShip includes a capability for determining ship propeller RPM for specified 
ship speeds. This capability is available for both azimuthing and non-azimuthing 
propellers. An iterative process is used to determine the actual RPM (within a 
specified tolerance) for ship speeds. This feature is very useful for determining what 
RPM should be used for subsequent simulations with SM3DFreeMo.

10 Conclusions 


ShipMo3D applications can be used to build a ship model that can be used for 
predicting ship motions in waves. A separate user manual [1] describes applications 
for predicting ship motions in the time and frequency domains.

13. ABSTRACT (A brief and factual summary of the document. It may also appear elsewhere in the body of the document itself. It is highly 
desirable that the abstract of classified documents be unclassified. Each paragraph of the abstract shall begin with an indication of the 
security classification of the information in the paragraph (unless the document itself is unclassified) represented as (S), (C), or (U). It is 
not necessary to include here abstracts in both official languages unless the text is bilingual.) 

ShipMo3D is an object-oriented library with associated user applications for predicting ship mo¬ 
tions in calm water and in waves. This report serves as a user manual for creating ship models 
using ShipMo3D Version 3.0. A companion report serves as a user manual for predicting ship 
motions in the time and frequency domains. Version 3 of ShipMo3D introduces modelling of 
sloshing tanks and U-tube tanks. Several ShipMo3D applications are used for creating a ship. 
SM3DPanelHull creates a panelled representation of the wet and dry portions of the ship hull. 
SM3DRadDif computes radiation and diffraction forces acting on the wet hull using a boundary 
element method. SM3DPanelSloshTank creates a panelled representation of a sloshing tank, 
such as a tank containing liquid cargo or a roll stabilization tank. SM3DRadSloshTank computes 
sloshing forces arising from motions in the frequency domain. SM3DBuildShip creates a model 
of the ship that can be used for ship motion predictions in either the frequency domain or time 
domain. 


14. KEYWORDS, DESCRIPTORS or IDENTIFIERS (Technically meaningful terms or short phrases that characterize a document and could 
be helpful in cataloguing the document. They should be selected so that no security classification is required. Identifiers, such as 
equipment model designation, trade name, military project code name, geographic location may also be included. If possible keywords 
should be selected from a published thesaurus, e.g. Thesaurus of Engineering and Scientific Terms (TEST) and that thesaurus identified. 
If it is not possible to select indexing terms which are Unclassified, the classification of each should be indicated as with the title.)
