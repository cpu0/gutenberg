GridTool is an interactive program for grid! geometry applications . Most grid generation programs represent geometry by a set 
of structured points which is not consistent with the Computer Aided Design (CAD) representation. The purpose of GridTool 
is to bridge the gap between the CAD and the grid generation systems. 


Introduction 

GridTool is designed around the concept that the surface grids are generated on a set of bi-linear patches. This type of 
grid generation is quite easy to implement, and it avoids the problems associated with complex CAD surface 
representations and associated surface parameterizations. However, the resulting surface grids are close to but not on the 
original CAD surfaces. This problem can be alleviated by projecting the resulting surface grids onto the original CAD 
surfaces. GridTool is designed primary for unstructured grid generation systems. Currently, GridTool supports VGRID 
fll and FEUSA T21 systems, and it can be easily extended to support other unstructured grid generation systems. 

The data in GridTool is stored parametrically so that once the problem is set up, one can modify the surfaces and the 
entire set of points, curves and patches will be updated automatically. This is very useful in a multidisciplinary design and 
optimization process. 

GridTool is written entirely in ANSI "C", the interface is based on the FORMS library [31 . and the graphics is based on 
the GL library. The code has been tested successfully on IRIS workstations running IRIX4.0 and above. The memory is 
allocated dynamically, therefore, memory size will depend on the complexity of geometry/grid. 

GridTool data structure is based on a link-list structure which allows the required memory to expand and contract 
dynamically according to the user’s data size and action. Data structure contains several types of objects such as points, 
curves, patches, sources and surfaces. At any given dme, there is always an active object which is drawn in magenta, or 
in their highlighted colors as defined by the resource file which will be discussed later. 

Surface Representation and Grid Projection 

References [41-[61 contain detailed descriptions of Surface Representation and Grid Projection. For completeness sake, a 
short summary will be provided here. In CAD systems, curves and surfaces are represented typically by NonUniform 
Rational B-Splines (NURBS) which is the most general mathematical representation for curves and surfaces. Most 
parametric curves and surfaces can be converted to an equivalent NURBS 171-181 representation without any loss of 
accuracy. 

The surface-grid can be generated either in a parameter space or on approximated/simplified NURBS surfaces. Grids 
generated in a parameter space have two serious restrictions. The first restriction is that the choice of surface 
parameterization affects the CFD surface-grid. As shown in Refs. Ref. 6 and Ref. 9. a poor parameterization may cause 
the CFD surface-grid to be highly skewed. The second limitation is that a CFD surface-grid can not be generated over 
several overlapping NURBS surfaces which is the most serious restriction. 

In the second method , the NURBS surfaces are approximated by a few bi-linear patches, then, the surface grids are 
generated based on these bi-linear patches. The resulting surface grids are close but they are not on the original NURBS 
surfaces. This problem can be alleviated by projecting the resulting grid points onto the original NURBS surfaces. This 
method is easy to implement, and it avoids the problems associated with surface parameterization. This method of grid 
generation will require a very robust and fast grid point projection. 

Advancing Front Applications (VGRID System) 

In this section, using GridTool for VGRID system is described. VGRID system is a robust and fast unstructured grid 
generator developed by VIGYAN Inc. for NASA Langley Research Center. The VGRID code is fully functional and 
supported and can be obtained from NASA Langley Research Center (contact: Dr. Neal Frink, 
NT.FRINK@LaRC.NASA.GOV). The VGRID system is based on an advancing front technique, and readers are 
referred to an excellent and detailed report by Parikh, Pirzadeh and LO hner VGRID! 11 . A short description of advancing 
front technique will be given here for the sake of completeness. 

The advancing front method is an unstructured grid generation method similar to parabolic and hyperbolic methods for

structured grid generation. Grids are generated by marching from boundaries (front) towards the interior. First, the 
domain of interest is subdivided into a set of patches which cover the entire domain. Next, these patches are triangulated 
to form the "initial front". Finally, tetrahedral elements are generated based on the initial front. As tetrahedral elements 
are generated, the "initial front" is updated until the entire domain is covered with tetrahedral elements, and the front is 
emptied. The above process can be summarized in the following steps: 

1. subdivide the domain of interest using GridTool, 

2. specify grid spacings using GridTool, 

3. generate the "initial front" using VGRID, 

4. update the GridTool restart File to reflect the changes from VGRID using GridTool, 

5. project the front onto the CAD surfaces using GridTool, 

6. generate the volume grid using VGRID, 

7. post-process the volume grid using VGRID. 

The first step is to define the boundaries for the domain of interest. These boundaries are then subdivided into smaller 
patches using GridTool. In this paper, a patch is synonymous with a three-dimensional polygon. In the VGRID system, 
three types of patches are allowed: triangular Barnhill -Gregory- Niels on patches (three arbitrary sides), bilinear 
transfinite Coon’s patch (four arbitrary sides), and planar patches (defined by an arbitrary number of sides, all lying in 
one plane). Each patch consists of several sides, and each side consists of several curves. In step 2, the grid spacing is 
defined by nodal and linear sources. An excellent description of these sources can be found in Ref. 1101 . In step 3, all 
patches are triangulated to form the "initial front" using the VGRID system. In this step, VGRID may change the patch 
orientation. If so, in step 4, the GridTool restart file must be updated to reflect the changes. In step 5, the "initial front" is 
projected back onto the original surfaces using GridTool. In step 6, the volume grid is generated in one run or several 
restart runs using VGRID. In step 7, the volume grid can be post-processed to enhance grid quality. The details for steps 
3, 5 and 6 can be found in Ref. 1 . 

GridTool Interface 


The interface consists of a main panel and several sub-panels. The panels consist of a set of buttons, input-fields, sliders, 
dials, positioners, browsers and message boxes. This section describes the user interaction with the GridTool interface. 
The user interacts with GridTool program by pointing/clicking the mouse buttons and the keyboard while the cursor is 
over a panel or the display window. Panels can be activated by pressing their buttons from the main window. They can be 
stowed away either from the panel itself by pressing the "S'/ow" button or by pressing the panel’s button in the main 
panel. Whenever a panel is activated, the color of its button in the main panel will be changed from blue to green. Here is 
a list of actions and how they can be accomplished in the panels. 


• To press a button, place the the cursor over the button and click with any of the three mouse buttons. 

• To change the value in an input-field, place the the cursor over the input-field, click with any of the three mouse 
buttons, enter the value in the input-field, and complete the input by entering the "Return" key. The "ESC" key 
can be used to delete the entire field, or the "Backspace" key can be used to delete a portion of it. 

• To change the position of a slider, dial or a positioner, hold and drag the right mouse while the cursor is over the 
object. 

• To select an object from a browse, place the the cursor over the object in the browser and click the right mouse. 
The background color of the selected object in the browser will change from black to green when they are selected.

Hot Keys 

A series of hot kevs are available in the display window which allow the user to accomplish some tasks without use of the 
panels. These keys can be activated by placing the cursor over the display window and clicking the hot key. The hot keys 
can be used to translate/rotate/zoom the object, to pick or to create an object.

When GridTool starts, it looks for the resource file, ".GridTool". This file could be at either the user’s root, the current 
directory or defined by "setenv" unix command as "setenv GridTooLresources my _resource_f ilename" . Users may 
change the resource file by customizing it to their needs. If the resource file does not exist, GridTool will use the defaults 
values which are listed in the A ppendix A . The resource file may contain the preferred colors for displaying objects and 
the boundary conditions. A comment line can start either with a space or "#" in the first column. The default boundary 
conditions are based on the USM3D fill code developed by Neal Frink at NASA/Langley Research Center. In the 
following sections, the application of GridTool for setting up data files for an advancing front technique (VGRID system)

is described. One important feature of GridTool is that each operation is accomplished in one step only. Therefore users 
can create and manipulate objects randomly. 

There is some limited on-line help which can be activated by pressing the "Help" button in the main panel which in turn 
will open a browser. As the user moves the cursor over any object in the panels, a description of that button will be given 
in the browser.

The IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange Standard) files are based on the industry standard as described in IGES manual 
£121- GridTool is only capable of accepting the following entities: copious data (entity 106), lines (entity 110), parametric 
splines (entity 112), parametric surface spline (entity 1 14), NURBS curves (entity 126) and NURBS surfaces (entity 
128). Surfaces defined by points can be read/written in GRIDGEN IT31 . PLOT3D 1141 . LaWGS f!51 or VGRID-NET [ 11 
formats. 

The surface triangulation, "the initial front", can be read/written in a front format defined by the VGRID system \ 1 1 or 
FELISA system [21 . The necessary information for advancing front methods can be read/written either in a "d3m" 
input- file format for VGRID system (11 or in a "dat" input- file format FELISA system \2\ . An ASCII "restart" file can 
be read/written at any time, which contains all created/modified/read objects. It is possible to combine several restart files 
to form one. This allows several people to work on the same configuration and combine all pieces at a later time. Before 
reading/writing a "d3m", "front" or a "dat" file, a "project name" must be selected. This name is used as the file name 
suffix for all necessary files (e.g. project. front). Once the file is read/written, the "Files" browser will be updated. To 
update the list displayed in "Files" browser, press the "Update" button.

Display and Viewing Controls 

The display can be controlled either from the display window using the mouse and the keyboard, or from the " Viewing 
Controls " panel. The mouse can be used either in a default mode or in a PLQT3D \ 141 mode. The mode can be changed 
by pressing the "PLOT3D" button which is located in the "Viewing Controls " panel. The default mouse mode is similar to 
the GRIDGEN system 1131 . In the default mode, while pressing the left mouse button, left, right, up, and down mouse 
movements will cause the object to translate in the corresponding directions. By holding the middle mouse down, up and 
down mouse movements will cause the object to zoom out and in. The object can be rotated using the numeric keypad, 
and this will be explained later. In the PLOT3D mode, by holding the left mouse down, left/right and up/down mouse 
movements will cause the object to rotate about the x and y screen coordinates, respectively. By holding the middle mouse 
down, left/right mouse movements will cause the object to rotate about the z screen coordinate, up/down mouse 
movements will cause the object to zoom out and in, respectively. By holding the right mouse down, left, right, up, and 
down mouse movements will cause the object to translate in the corresponding directions.

In either modes, the object can be rotated using the numeric keypad. The object can be rotated about two sets of axes: 
screen coordinates and body coordinates (world). The top row of the numeric keypad, the "Num Lock", "/" and keys 
control the rotation about the x, y and z world coordinates, respectively. The second row, the "7", "8" and "9" keys control 
the rotation about the x, y and z screen coordinates, respectively. The rotation continues as long as the keys are pressed 
down. The object can be rotated ninety degrees by holding the "PageUp" or "PageDown" key while pressing the 
appropriate key on the numeric keypad. The object can be rotated in the reverse direction by holding down the key 
from numeric keypad and the appropriate rotation keys. The object orientation can be reinitialized by pressing the V key 
which is the hot kevs for resetting the object. All object manipulations can be accomplished from the "Viewing Controls " 
panel as well.

Center of Rotation 

This panel is designed to allow the user to move the center of rotation to an arbitrary point in space. The center of 
rotation can be moved to: an exiting point by using the three sliders, "x", " y", "z" to centers of the active 
surface/curve/patch/point by pressing the appropriate buttons. The center of rotation can be reset by pressing the "Reset 
CR " button. The hot keys . P, C, F, S can be used in the display window to move the center of rotation to the active point, 
active curve, active patch and active surface.

Surface Attributes 

This panel is designed to allow the user to manipulate the surface properties. In order to change the background color of 
the display window, the ” Background " button in the "Attributes” panel should be pressed. Then, the color can be changed 
by moving three sliders for the colors or by inputing the RGB color number (Red, Green, Blue) in the input-fields. 



Fig. 5 Surface Attributes Panel 

The surface properties such as color, direction and number of display paths can be changed in this panel. First, the " 
Surfaces" button in this panel should be pressed, and then " On/Off ’ browser will appear. In order to change the properties 
of some of the surfaces, first they must be turned on. This can be done either from the display window or from the ” 
OnlOff' browser by placing the cursor over the surface number and clicking with the left mouse. In order to turn a 
surface on/off from the display window, first the surface must become an active surface by placing the cursor over the 
surface and hitting the hot key "s". Then, the active surface can be turned on/off by hitting the hot kev "w". Once the 
appropriate surfaces are turned on, then the properties can be changed. Surface colors can be changed by using the three 
sliders for colors or by inputing the RGB color number in the input-fields. The direction of surfaces can be changed by 
pressing the 11 Directions " button. The number of display paths can be changed by inputing the desired numbers of display 
paths in u and v coordinates in the input- field for "number of display path" and then pressing " Change DP" button. 

Projection Properties 

This panel is designed for modifying the projection parameters, and it displays the projection parameters for the active 
surface. For detail description of these properties, readers are referred to Refs. f4~|— f6] . In this panel, it is also possible to 
change the parameters such that part of a surface is displayed and projected to. This can be done by changing the limits 


826 


of the surface parameters, us (minimum u), ue (maximum u), vs (minimum v), and ve (maximum v). The ''Itmax" is the 
number of iteration for the projection to converge. The "EPS" is the residual limit for the projection to converge. The "du" 
and "dv" are the step size in u and v directions, respectively. The "magn" are parameters used to pull grid points to 
boundaries, and their values range from 0-1. 


1. "magi" for minimum v 

2. "magT for maximum u 

3. "mag3" for maximum v 

4. "mag4" for minimum u 



Fig. 6 Projection Propertie* Panel 


Points/Curves 

This panel contains several buttons, input-fields and a positioner, and they are used to create/modify/delete points and 
curves. In GridTool, a curve is represented by a link-list of points. These points are either on a surface (surface points) or 
somewhere in space (XYZ points). For surface points, in addition to the x, y, z, the surface number and its parametric 
coordinates, u and v are stored in the data base. Curves can be created together as a family. For example, all curves 
associated with a wing could be created together as a "wing" family. The family name for curves is selected from the H 
Patches" panel which will be discussed later. To start a new curve, press the "Next Curve " button. To create a new point 
for a curve, the "Next Point" button should be pressed, and this newly created point becomes the active point. Since every 
operation is done in one step, the new point will be placed where the last point was, and then the user can move the new 
point, (the active point), to any location. The active point can be moved to an existing point on a curve by placing the 
cursor over the desired curve point and hitting the hot kev M m". Similarly, the active point can be moved to an existing 
point on the active surface by placing the cursor over the surface point and hitting the hot kev "t". Also, the active point 
can be moved to any location on the active surface by either: (1) typing the parametric coordinates in the "U & V ' input 
box, (2) moving the "U <& V 11 positioner, (3) moving the 11 U & V” sliders. In order to move the active point in space, first 
the point should be converted to an "XYZ M point by pressing "On Surface " button. Once the active point is an XYZ point, 
the V, "y", and "z" sliders can be used to move the point to anywhere in the space. It is also possible to change the 
coordinate by typing the values in the input field boxes. A point can be inserted ahead of the active point on a curve by 
pressing the "Insert Point" button. The new point becomes the active, and if the two neighboring points are on the same 
surface, then the inserted point will also be on the same surface. The point or the active curve can be deleted by pressing 
the "Delete Point" or the "Delete Curve " buttons, respectively. A point or a curve can become active by placing the cursor 
over it and hitting the hot kev "p" or "c", respectively. 


827 



Fig. 7 Points/Curves Panel 


Patches 

A patch is a closed three-dimensional polygon which is defined by a set of curves. Nonplanar patches should be 3- or 
4-sided* and planar patches could be n-sided. Each side of a patch could consist of several curves. Each patch is stored as 
a link-list of curves. To create a patch, the "Next Patch " button should be pressed. Then, the first curve for the patch 
must be activated by the user, and then it can be accepted as the first curve by pressing "Accept Edge " button. The 
subsequent curves can be added by letting GridTool find them. This can be done by pressing " Find Edge " button until the 
correct curve is found. GridTool will find the next curve within the tolerance define in the M tol" input-field box. Once the 
correct curve is found, it should be accepted by pressing the " Accept Edge" button. Once a patch is created, its direction 
can be reversed by pressing the "Reverse Patch " button. 



Fig. 9 Patches Panel 


BOX 

This panel is designed to allow the user to create/delete a box. To create a box, press "Create Box " button which will 
create a box bounded by minmax in x, y, z coordinates defined in the six input-fields in the panel. The resulting curves 


828 



and patches are grouped together as the "Box" family. To delete the box, press the "Delete Box " button which will delete 
all patches and curves in the "Box" family. 



Fig. 10 BOX Panel 


Bg Grid 

This panel contains several buttons and input-fields, and they are used to create/modify/delete nodal and linear sources. 

In order to define grid spacing, nodal and linear sources must be created and placed in the right locations. In order to 
create a source, the "Bg Grid' and "Points/ Curves" panels must be activated. To create a source, press the " Next Source" 
button. This will create a source similar to the last source. If this is the first source, it will create a nodal source and place 
it in the middle of the domain. The location of a source can be moved by using the same techniques as described for 
moving points. The value spacings, "SI" and "S2", are the sizes of ideal tetrahedrals for the source locations. An excellent 
description of parameters "a_n, b_n, alpha" can be found in Ref. 10 . 



Fig. 11 Background Grid Panel 


Unstructured Grid 

This panel is designed to manipulate the unstructured surface grid. The "Front" button is used to activate the "Front" 
from which a surface triangulation can be projected onto a set of surfaces. 

Front 

This panel is used to project the surface triangulation (front) onto a set of surfaces, and this process can be divided into 
five steps: (1) read the front using the "10" panel, (2) turn the appropriate patches on, (3) turn associated surfaces on, (4) 
project the front onto the surfaces, and (5) check for the validity of the new triangulation. In order to have a successful 
projection, users are required to insure that: (1) the surface triangulation is close enough to the associated surfaces, and 
(2) the associated surfaces have sufficient display paths. 


829 



Fig. 12 Unstructured Grid Panel 


Structured Grid 

This panel is used to project the entire or portion of a structured surface grid onto a set of surfaces, and this process can 
be divided into five steps: (1) read the surface definition and the surface grid using the 70" panel, (2) turn on associated 
surfaces, (3) make the surface to be projected active, (4) project the surface grid onto the surfaces, and (5) check for the 
validity of the new surface grid. In order to have a successful projection, users are required to insure that: (1) the surface 
grid is close enough to the associated surfaces, and (2) the associated surfaces have sufficient display paths. User may 
undo the projection or reinterpolate a protion of the surface grid.
