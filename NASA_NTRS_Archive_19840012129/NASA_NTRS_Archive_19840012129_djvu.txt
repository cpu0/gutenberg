PRESEHT SYSTEM HARDWARE 


The INTERDATA 8/32 is a 32-bit word length nini-conputer manufactured by 
the Perkio-Elmer (PE) Corporation. This computer though, in widespread 
operation in the U. S., including a number of research organizations, does not 
have the recognition of the PAX series, with which it is comparable, insofar 
•s both are 32-bit minis. With the 32-bit word length (and double precision 
capability), large mainframe addressing is possible. The mainframe memory 
contains 1024 Kbytes supplemented by a special on-line microprocessor for 
special functions. The disc drives comprise two 80-Kbyte (CDC 9762) units. 
User languages include FORTRAN VII and BASIC. The present software operating 
system (INTERDATA OS/3), though not the most current version, has been 
extensively adapted for auto-priority and accounting purposes. Presently, 
there are 28 utility (physical) and/or terminal (logical) ports. Twenty-two 
are terminal ports and six are utility ports. In addition, we have a Houston 
plotter, Tektronix graphics terminal, Chromatics color graphics terminal, 
2000-, 1200-, and 300/1200-baud auto answer modems, as well as 7- and 9-track 
tape drives, a 300-line/minute printer, and QUKE high-speed text printer. A 
block diagram of the present system is shown in Figure 1. It is possible to 
operate from home through the communciation system during off hours as the 
computer is on continuously. The computer is operated on an "open shop" 
basis; this decreases the cost substantially and speeds up processing 
measurably. It also has the effect of bringing the computational process 
close to the investigator. 

Some idea of the throughput speed of our 8/32 can be seen from the 
benchmark test tabulated in Table I. The WCS (word control store) is a 
special small memory programmed in assembler code with specific routines, in 
our case standard vector operations. Inspection of the table discloses that 
the 8/32, as we have it configured and with our software modifications, is 
comparable to the VAX 11/780 and even exceeds the latter by about 30Z for the 
vector test. The modifications proposed herein will increase the machine 
speed, especially for I/O-laden jobs by a substantial margin, keeping the 
computer current with needs. 

The computer is currently housed in an air-conditioned room adjacent to a 
large working area containing most of the I/O devices (see Figure 2). The 
modems are used extensively for communication between the 8/32 and 
investigator homes for after-hour work including job submission and monitoring 
(batch mode processing), editing (word processing), and some actual system 
control from one link. Off campus, the principal PI (Sonettt) uses an Otrona 
"Attache" on a Vadic 1200-baud dedicated line, a 300/1200 baud line is used by 
Hubbard and Jokipii with APPLE II's, a fourth user (0. E. Gault, Murphys, CA) 
with a TRS terminal, while various other users employ a TI SILEM 700 
terminal, a Radio Shack VIDEOTEX terminal, an Ohio Scientific micro, and a 
Netronics ELF (used for remote system control). Other ligbt-to-beav> usage 
includes links to TYMESHARE (Pioneer Venus/Hunten) and to USGS (Flagstaff /B. 
Smith) also on an as-needed basis. Further use of this type of communication 
is anticipated.

CURRENT SYSTEM SOFTWARE 

It is now widely recognized that the software complement of a computer 
system is a major factor in effective utilization. The manufacturer-supplied 
operating system for the 8/32 has been extensively modified so that some 
characteristics are essential ly unreognizable from the original. We have 
found that a priority allocation system was an essential feature for effective 
operation. This current system for allocation of time is shown in Table II. 

Data nrocessin^i 

Large scale processing of data tapes from spacecraft, complemented by 
various geophysical data sets, is implemented by fast access via magnetic tape 
drives at 800 and 1600 6PI rates. Codes are available for reading most tape 
formats; direct access makes rapid plotting of a variety of outputs onto 
either screen (black/wbite or color) or hardcopy possible. Data reduction 
usually takes place on a batch basis, plotting via special plot routines 
called from console. Current data reduction is somewhat limited in scope due 
to disc load limits so that very long data files must be bandied as separate 
jobs, or reduced in length by filtering and decimation. Much data analysis 
involves coordinate rotations, decimation, computation of auto- and cross- 
power spectral densities, and auto- and cross-correlation functions. Current 
work also includes large programs for formal solution to geophysical 
inversions. 

Batch mode 

For large scale computations, subission is generally in batch mode, which 
is active concurrently with interactive operations such as compiling, word 
processing, and small computations. Job submission, bresks, and tracking of 
jobs can all be done either from LPL or from remote terminals, e.g., home 
installations. The status of all jobs can be monitored from any terminal in 
the system.

Conpilatioo can be dose via several aysteo routines. The soainal 
procedure is to call "FOR filesaBe." This requires of order 35 Kbytes of 
core. For faster coopilisg (if core is available) using "QFOR f ilationnane" 
-can result in a faster coopilatioa, but uses some 100 Kbytes. A FORTRAN 
optiaiser, also available, is restricted to very large codes which are 
intended for long runs as its use involves very large core dedication. 

Word nrocessine 

Word processing is an outgrowth of the original editing software, 
supplied primarily as an adjunct to program editing. However, the 
requirements for widespread document editing and processing, together with 
department library multi'-card production and accession listing required 
extensive modification to the original editor. The current system is not 
optimum for a word processor, but has been modified insofar as feasible in 
view of the widespread types of terminals in LPL. The modifications to the 
manuf acturer^supplied system have all been made without availability of a 
source code. Modifications to the system software are based on the Ql'ME 
printer requirements. They include essentially all standard word processing 
calls such as uper/lower case, underline, backup, centering, sub- and 
superscript, lines advance, page advance, page numbering options, font 
selection, line numbering option, margin adjustments, etc. 

Accounting 

Although the operation of the computer is maintained as an open shop 
facility, we have found that an accounting system is a vital factor in 
effective usage for several reasons. It is designed to provide a minimum of 
information compatible with orderly operation, allocation of priorities, 
improvement of the operating system, and planning for system growth, without 
administrative software overloading. Accounting readout is made once per 
week. The cumulative log is kept on a permanent disc file which can be made 
into hardcopy at any time. An example of the weekly log output is shown in 
Table III. Usage of the computer is given in condensed form in the next 
section. 

Priority allocation 

Auto allocation of the CPU is done on a tiae/job size basis, with the 
longest running jobs progressively retreating on the priority scale, 
eventually ending in background. Editing has the highest priority (128), with 
other interactive jobs such as word processing one down (129) and FORTRAN 
entry at 130. The general order of priority allocation is shown in Table IV. 

Ufeim rou^,ij>£A 

In addition to the operating system, we maintain a large library of 
special programs for computation purposes. In the interest of economy these 
are not listed in the proposal.

CURRENT COMPUTER USAGE 


The computer ic curreotly utiliced for e large variety of jobs, ranging 
from interactive data reduction and interpretation through computational batch 
mode extensively for manuscript preparation via word processing, and for a 
number of office routines involving bibliographic search and retrieval and 
business problems auch as budget accounting and completion of atandard fores 
required for travel, purchasing, etc. Indication of typical atate of current 
traffic levels is given by Table III as noted earlier, shoving jobs at one 
time by name, account number, core sire, priority, status, and core seconds 
run to the time of tabulation. 

Research 

A summary of the research programs nov carried out on the INTERDATA 
computer is given by the following descriptions of the activities of the 
primary user groups as follows: 

Prof. C. P. Sonett for reduction and interpretation of solar wind data 
from various NASA spacecraft aimed at understanding of the hydromagnetic 
structure of the solar wind including the kinetmatic properties of the small 
scale wave structure; analysis of various geophysical record compilations such 
as containing a record of aolar-terrestrial processes; simulation of large 
bolide impacts into the Earth's oceans leading to information on megaocean 
waves in the fossil record; a study of the possible role of magnetic fields in 
the early solar system from the avaialable record in meteorites supplemented 
by conceptual models; electromagentic induction and the physical structure of 
the Moon's interior; and thermal energy sources in the early solar system, 
especially those based upon electromagnetic interaction of the nebula and the 
protoplanets. Associated research (L. L. Hood) is on the permanent magnetic 
field of the Moon, the interaction of the magnetospheric plasma of the giant 
planets and their satellites, and (F. Herbert) on the interaction of the solar 
wind and comets, electromagnetic sounding on the Moon, and the physical 
structure of the Moon according to models of the physio-chemical 
differentiation of the lunar interior. 

(b) Prof. W. B. Hubbard for computing interior models of the Jovian 
planets with allowance for interior differential rotation; the planetary 
structure is calculated via a self-consistent field approach involving 
evaluation of the equation of state, iterative solution of the equation of 
hydrostatic equilibrium, and propagation of the solution into higher spatial 
harmonics; in addition, it has been used with a scheme to numerically solve 
the Thomas-Fermi-Dir ac equation in three dimensions which is to be used to 
generate more accurate results for the problem of phase separation of liquids 
and solids at high pressure in addressing the problem of hydrogen-helium 
separation, separation of hydrogen and high-Z materials, and separation of 
different kinds of high/Z material; finally, soon it will be used for reducing 
astronomical data from observational projects. 

(c) Prof. £1^ Hunten for research on planetary atmospheres and 
problems of the Jovian magnetosphere; specifically, during the first two years 
of the Pioneer Venus mission, it was used to access the unifited data base 
(UADS) maintained by TYMESHARE for Ames Research Center while, in a similar 
effort, it has been used to process Voyager tapes from the infrared 



spectroneter (IBIS); ptber studies include those in theoretical aerooooy (S. 
Kassie) for solutions to large systeas of coupled lov-order differential 
equations to get the distribution of various compounds and radicals, a study 
of eddy diffusion of the Earth's stratosphere, and a study of ortho-para U2 
conversion in the Jovian planets; a visitor (J. P. Parisot) pursued studies of 
the chemistry of the Venus mesosphere; I. De Pater (a planetary radio 
astronomer interested in both atmospheres and magnetosphere of Jovian planets) 
works on problems ranging from analysis of data from the Very Large Array to 
synthesis of synchrotron amission from electrons in the Jovian magnetosphere. 

(d) Prof. J. R. Jokinii for modelling studies of the propagation of 
cosmic rays in the inteplanetary medium; his group has developed a set of 
codes which have permitted the most comprehensive modelling of the solar 
modulation of cosmic rays yet attempted. The codes make possible full three- 
dimensional simulations in a frame co-rotating with the sun, and incorporate 
all known propagation effects. In addition, detailed studies of the transport 
of fast charged particles in various magnetic field configurations have been 
carried out (with E. H. Levy), shedding light on the basic transport and 
scattering mechanisms for cosmic rays. 

(e) Prof. E. H. Lew for a research program that involves the 
construction of computational models to explore the character of magnetic 
fields in natural objects, including planets, the sun, stars, etc., generated 
under a variety of circumstances, leading to conclusions, for example, about 
dynamical influences of the field stresses on the behavior of evolving 
objects; current projects include calculations aimed at understanding the 
possible generation of dynamo magnetic field in the protoplanetary nebula from 
which the aolar system formed, calculations aimed at determining the influence 
on the solar magnetic cycle of a possible fossil magnetic field frozen into 
the sun from the time of its formation, and a program of research (with J. R. 
Jokipii) aimed at the physics of the interp lanetay medium and cosmic-ray 
transport theory, concentrating on elucidating the role of particle drifts on 
the modulation of galactic cosmic rays in the heliosphere though construction 
of detailed computer solutions of the cosmic-ray transport equations 
incorporating the drift terms. 

Additional use is made of the communcations and word processing by other 
faculty and staff, and also the department office and library. 

Accounting 

The accounting record is dumped weekly for planning purposes and for 
tracking of the priority optimizer sub-routine of the operating system. The 
accounting stores weekly average of usage by major groups. This permanent 
record is available on demand in tabular or graphical form. The items stored 
by major group are disc sector totals. CPU utilization in units of CPUmin . and 
core (memory) in units of Kbyte hrs. The disc total is for the previous week; 
the other two parameters are instantaneous readouts. The maximum computer 
totals are (a) 134 Mbytes (523 Ksectors) of utilizable disc, and (b) 1024 
Kbytes of core of which about 225 Kbytes is devoted to the full operating 
aystem. (Kote that for dedicated single-user computation, it is posible to 
disable a major fraction of the operating system yielding ateut 900 Kbytes of 
usable core.) 



Disc 


12 


Figure 3 provides the accouoting sumioary for the past year, (February 
1981-February 1982) for the three major user groups. The total generally 
hovers at about 400 Ksectors vs. the available total of 523 Rsectors. The 
major characteristics are the near saturation condition most of the time, and 
the intrinsic partitioning between heavy data processing (Sonett) and 
theoretical modelling (Jokipii and Hunten). 


Core utilization, given in Figure 5, is more irregular, shoving many 
heavy traffic periods during the year. The major user is Jokipii; this is 
expected because of the computational emphasis of his work. Of the three 
major areas whose traffic is defined by the accounting, core utilization is 
perhaps the least well defined. At the same time, it is the least critical of 
the hardware areas requiring attention. 

Usage vs. original system design goals 

These graphs provide compelling evidence that our original philosophy 
with respect to computer requirements and implementation has been successful, 
thus providing a strong basis for confidence that the projections of this 
proposal are soundly based. That philosophy was based upon four principal 
axioms: (a) the need for a hands-on (open shop) computer for data analysis 
with large core and disc capability, but used intermittently, (b) the 
expected requirements of the NASA data network, (c) the need for intermittent 
large core capacity for theoretical modelling, and (d) the ability to access 
data rapidly either directly from tape or from core onto "hard" copy. Item 
(c) has turned out to generally exceed the possibilities afforded by use of 
the University computer, which has restricted core access. 

Finally, Figure 6 gives the time distribution of jobs over the year by 
weekly sums. This graph gives an approximation to computer usage since it 
indicates jobs only by SIGNON time together with execution of at least one 
operation. Recognizing this restriction on accuracy, note that the number 
ranges from a yearly low of about 1000/week upwards to a peak of nearly 
5000/ week in the spring.
