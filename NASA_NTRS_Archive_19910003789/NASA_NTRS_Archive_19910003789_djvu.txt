TECHNICAL REPORT 



The 

RICIS 

Concept 


*r 



y- 




W 








The University of Houston-Clear Lake established the Research Institute for 
Computing and Information sys tems in 1986 to encourag e NASA Johnson Space 
Center and local industry to actively support research in the computing and 
information sciences. As part of this endeavor, UH-CIear Lake proposed a 
partnership with JSC to jointly define and manage an integrated program of research 
in advanced dat a processing tech nology needed for JSC's main mission s, including 
administrative, engineering and science responsibilities. JSC ag reed and e ntered into 
a three-year cooperative agreement with UH-Clear Lake beginning in May, 1986, to 
jointly plan and execute such research through RICIS. Additionally, under 
Cooperative Agreement NCC 9-16, computing and educational facilities are shared 
by the two institutions to conduc t the research _ r 

The mission of RICIS is to conduct, coordinate and disseminate research on 
computing and information systems among researchers, sponsors and users from 
UH-Clear Lake, NASA/JSC,_and other research organizations. Within UH-Clear 
Lake, the mission is being Implemented through interdisciplinary involvement of 
faculty and students from each of the four schools: Business, Education, Human 
Sciences and Humanities, and Natural and Applied Sciences. 

Other research organizations are involved via the “gateway” concept. UH-Clear 
Lake establishes reTatTonships with other universities andTesearch organizations, 
having common research interests, to provide additional sources of expertise to 
conduct needed research. 

A major role of RICIS is to find the best match of sponsors, researchers and 
research objectives to advance knowledge in the computing and information 
sciences. Working Jointly with NASA/JSC, RICIS advises on research needs, 
recommends principals for conducting the research, provides technical and 
administrative support to coordinate the research, and integra tes te chnical results 
into the cooperative goals of UH-Clear Lake and^AS^®£i

STATEMENT OF OPERATION - ADA SOFTWARE REPOSITORY 

(OPERATE.DOC, Version 1.0) 

The Ada Software Repository is a public -domain collection of Ada software and 
information. The Ada Software Repository is one of several repositories located on the 
SIMTEL20 Defense Data Network host computer at White Sands Missile Range in New 
Mexico. SIMTEL20 is owned and operated by the Operations and Systems Integration 
Division of the Information Systems Command of the US Army. 

The Ada Software Repository is sponsored by the Operations and Systems Integration 
Division at White Sands Missile Range with additional funding provided by the STARS 
(Software Technology for Adaptable, Reliable Systems) Joint Program Office at the 
Pentagon.

THE ADA SOFTWARE REPOSITORY (ASR) ON SIMTEL20 

(AD AREPOS .DOC, Version 1.0) 

A repository of Ada programs, software components and educational material has been 
established on the SEMTEL20 host computer on the Defense Data Network. This 
repository has been accessible to any host computer on the network since November 26, 
1984. 

This repository provides a free source for Ada programs and information. By employing 
the File Transfer Protocol (FIT) program, users of DDN hosts are able to scan the 
directories of the repository and transfer files to their hosts. If the files are Ada programs, 
they may then compile these programs and use them as they desire. Modifying these 
programs may be within their rights, and they may freely distribute these programs within 
and without the DoD as they desire, subject to the restrictions specified for each piece of 
software in its prologue. 


Catalog of Reusable Software Components, Page i 


The Ada Software Repository is divided into several subdirectories. These directories are 
organized by topic, and their names and a brief overview of their topics are contained in the 
file DIRLIST.DOC in PD2:<ADA.GENERAL>. 

The Ada Software Repository on SIMTEL20 serves two basic roles: to promote the 
exchange and use (reusability) of Ada programs and tools (including components) and to 
promote Ada education (especially by providing several working examples of programs in 
source form for people to study and modify). 

All members of the Ada community are encouraged to freely extract information and 
programs from the repository as well as make contributions to it. The only restrictions 
which apply to the access and use of this software are presented in the "Distribution and 
Copyright" section of the prologue associated with each piece of software.

Catalog of Reusable Software Components, Page 1 


Machine/System Compiled/Run on: ROLM/DG / AOS 
Abstract: 

The HQ USAF Assistant Chief of Staff for Information Systems anticipates the adoption 
of SQL as the Air Force standard Relational data base query language. The Air Force 
will probably adopt the American National Standard (ANS) Database Language SQL 
as its Relational query language. A draft proposed American National Standard 
(dpANS)/Intemational Standard Database Language SQL is in the public review 
process. Given the above Air Force position, the WIS JPMO began a project with the 
Institute for Defense Analysis and RACOM Computer Professionals to develop a 
standard Ada DBMS interface (Ada/SQL) based on the dpANS Database Language SQL. 

A "Proposed Binding Ada to Database Language SQL" has been presented to the 
responsible American National Standards Committee(X3H2). We anticipate its 
adoption as the DoD and ANS/ISO standard Ada relational DBMS interface and it will be 
the WIS Standard Ada DBMS interface. As such, we recommend the Ada/SQL interface 
be used for any development of an Ada DBMS interface. 

The RAPPORT and DAMES DBMS Ada interfaces were among the R&D precursors 
developed to define an Ada DBMS interface. They are provided for information only 
and their syntax should not be used as a basis to build an Ada interface for any other 
DBMS.

EXPERT 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: VAX 1 1/785, VMS 4.1, DEC Ada 
Abstract: 

EXPERT is a backward chaining or goal driven expert system. It is based on two 
articles, first Sept 1981 BYTE (Duda and Gaschnig) published the expert system in 
BASIC skirting the use of recursion, second Jan/Feb 85 issue of JOURNAL OF 
PASCAL, ADA, & MODULA-2 (Darrell 

Morgeson) published in Modula-2 with recursion implemented. The listing had one 
logic error which caused pointer explosion on the last hypothesis in the GETRULE 
routine. This implementation follows the MODULA-2 design completely and was not 
designed from the ground up in Ada.

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: DEC Ada, VAX/VMS 
Abstract: 

A suite of timing and sizing benchmark programs written in "C", Ada, Fortran and 
Pascal. The first program in the suite is the Whetstone benchmark, which measures 
processor speed. This benchmark suite is available in "C", Ada, Fortran and Pascal. The 
other program in the suite is the Dhrystone benchmark. The Dhrystone benchmark 
measures statement execution per unit time. Dhrystone is available only for Ada.

JPMO Benchmarks 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: Telesoft 1.3 (unvalidated), WICAT/ROS 
Abstract: 

This tool is a series of very simple benchmarks which are used to test the validity of 
various assumptions that one might make about the behavior of a compiler. Probably all 
the implicit assumptions are valid, these tests just check that something has not been 
overlooked that could severely distort detailed quantitative tests. There should be no 
significance given to the numerical results of these tests, they just provide a framework for 
other tests. There is not even a pressing need to make sure of the status (or emptiness) 
of the machine on which they are run, since the desired comparison is one to another, not 
to some absolute.

PIWG Benchmarks 

Unit name : PIWG Benchmarks 
Version : TAPE_8_31_86 

Author : ACM SIGAda Performance Issues Working Group (PIWG) 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: Numerous 

PIWG is a suite of tests/benchmarks prepared by the Performance Issues Working Group 
of ACM SIGAda. The purpose of PIWG is to develop the benchmarks and collect and 
disseminate results. 


The PIWG tests have been under development for many years and have been run against 
many Ada compilers. The PIWG test suite contains over 190 files which include 
Whetstone (to measure processor speed), Dhrystone (to measure statement execution per 
unit time), and other benchmarks which test various attributes of the Ada language and their 
implementations under specific compilers. The PIWG tests must be customized for a 
particular compiler, and instructions are included to do this. 

Some of the items measured by PIWG include: 

* task creation-related timing 

* dynamic elaboration-related timing 

* exception-related timing 

* coding style-related timing 

* TEXT_IO-related timing 

* loop overhead-related timing 


Catalog of Reusable Software Components, Page 9 


* procedure call-related timing 

* task-related timing 

* compilation, link, and execution times 

NOTE: the directory PD:<ADA.PIWG> contains each of the individual files of the PIWG 
Benchmark Suite, while the directory PD:<ADA.BENCHMARKS> contains the same files 
grouped as just a few large PAGER files.

TaskingJBenchmarks 



Machine/System Compiled/Run on: DEC Ada (Version 1.2) on a VAX 8600 

Keywords: tasking, tasking benchmarks, tasking overhead 

Abstract: 

Catalog of Reusable Software Components, Page 10 


A set of tasking benchmarks were developed in conjunction with the paper "An Assessment 
of the Overhead Associated with Tasking Facilities and Task Paradigms in Ada" which 
appeared in the January, February 1987 Ada Letters. These benchmarks were developed to 
measure the efficiency of the implementation of the Ada tasking model, and evaluate the 
additional cost of introducing intermediaries for the various tasking paradigms.

Mitre_CAIS 


Machine/System Compiled/Run 

on: Vax 8600 
UNIX 


Verdix Ada Development Sys 

Abstract: 


This CAIS package provides a robust subset of the inter- faces defined in the proposed 
Military Standard Common Apse Interface Set(CAIS). The goal of MIL-STO-CAIS is 
to promote tool portability by providing a standardized set of calls for operating system 
services. It is also hoped that definition of a generalized node model will increase the 
interoperability of tool sets. 


This subset includes: 


5.1.1,2,3,5 -- Node_Definitions, Node_Management, Attributes, and 
Structural-Nodes 

5.3.1,1-4,10 - Io_Definitions, Directjo, Sequential_Io, Text_Io, and 
File_Import_Export (also a few procedures from 
ScroU_Terminal) 


Catalog of Reusable Software Components, Page 11 



5.4.1-20,21 — List_Utilities, Identifier_Items, and String_Items 


The interfaces not included are Access_Control, Process_Control, Io_Control, the Io 
device packages, FIoat_Item, and Integer_Item. 

It is intended that this CAIS subset be used to investigate the extent to which CAIS 
supports the needs of software development tools. Only by rehosting tools and their 
data to CAIS can the viability of CAIS be determined.

Tests for Mitre CAIS 


Machine/System Compiled/Run on: Vax 8600 

UNIX 

Verdix Ada Development Sys 
Abstract: - 


This set of tests exercises a wide range of the implemented CAIS interfaces. In general 
the results of the tests are self- documenting. However they are programmer-developed 
tests and are not as rigorous as might be expected for acceptance testing. They also vary in 
style. In some instances dependencies upon the state of the node model remain in these 
tests and thus may require modification. 


The tests are: 


attribute_ex.a 

cais_commandos.a 

copytree_test.a 

existree_ex.a 

io_ex_create_testa 

io_ex_open_testa

The tests should be run when the CAIS is installed and users have been added. They can 
also be run as regression tests, if the CAIS code is modified. They may be helpful as 
supplementary (though rudimentary) examples to MIL- STD-CAIS .

Editor 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: VAX 8600 ULTRIX, Sun2 UNIX 4.2 
Abstract: 

ALED is designed to edit text files. Upon invocation, ALED prompts the user for a file 
name. If the file exists, its contents (lines) are read in and prepared for editing; if the 
file does not exist, the file is created and the empty buffer is prepared for editing. 
ALED is an interactive editor, accepting single-char commands, filling in a command 
prompt (for more info as needed), and performing its functions in real-time while the 
user watches. The functions provided include (but are not limited to) the following: 


Catalog of Reusable Software Components, Page 13 


* List Lines 

* Insert a Group of Lines into the Edit Buffer 

* Delete Lines 

* String Search and String S ubstitutio n 

* Movement Within the Edit Buffer 

* Reading in a File After a Specified Line 

* Writing out a Range of Lines to a File 

* Built-in, online Documentation (Summary) 

ALED's design includes an input line editor, which allows the user to edit text as he types 
it.

CAS2 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: DEC Ada, VAX/VMS 
Abstract: 

This procedure calculates the "STATEMENTS" of a valid Ada fragment specified by a 
FDLE_NAME string parameter. It need not be a complete compilation unit, but it should 
have closed all open parens and strings. 


Catalog of Reusable Software Components, Page 17 


The Ada statement is defined by a semicolon terminator outside of comments, parentheses, 
or string or character literals. This definition is insensitive to formatting or layout of the 
source. 

There are exotic cases for which this will misestimate the count but we have never 
encountered one in real code. 

This procedure is derived from Bill Whitaker's original 
COUNT_OF_ADA_STATEMENTS, and it does not change his original algorithm. 
It adds a line count and a character-checksum hash (sum of POS values of all non-space 
characters in the file mod 256).

Machine/System Compiled On: VAX 8600 / Ultrix / VERDIX 
Abstract: 

This is a package of several string manipulation functions based on a built-in dynamic 
string type DYN_STRING. It is an adaptation and extension of the package proposed 
by Sylvan Rubin of Ford Aerospace and Communications Corporation in the Nov/Dec 
1984 issue of the Journal of Pascal, Ada and Modula-2. Some new functions have been 
added, and much of the body code has been rewritten.

FGET 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: DG MV 10000, ROLM ADE 
DEC VAX 11/785, DEC Ada 


Abstract: 

Package FGET manipulates an object which is a text file. Its main purpose is to return 
characters from this file, allowing one-character look-ahead. A character which has been 
obtained from the file via GETC can be returned to the file by an UNGETC, in which case 
the next GETC will return the same character again. Additionally, GETC returns 
ASCII.CR if the end of a text line is reached and ASCH.ETX if the end of the file is 
reached.

I/O Support 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: DG MV 10000, ROLM ADE 


Catalog of Reusable Software Components, Page 23 


Abstract: 


IO_SUPPORT is a companion package for SYSDEP, a system dependencies package 
that provides console input and console output without echo on the input and 
without control character interpretation. IO_SUPPORT, which employs SYSDEP, 
provides an input line editor and interfaces to the routines in SYSDEP which provide a 
greater degree of functionality than S Y SDEP itself provides. 

For applications which are embedded and do not require features of TEXT_IO other 
than simple character or string I/O, IO_SUPPORT with SYSDEP offer an alternative to 
withingin the entire TEXT_IO package. 

The philosophy behind creating SYSDEP is to provide low-level I/O routines which can 
be built upon to implement applications which require raw I/O, such as communications 
servers and character-oriented tools. IO_SUPPORT goes one step further by 
providing a set of commonly-used routines around SYSDEP, preventing the need for 
constantly reinventing the basic wheel.

Parser 


Machine/System Compiled/Run on: DG MV 10000 (ROLM ADE) and 

DEC VAX 1 1/785 (DEC Ada) 

Abstract: 

PARSER is a generic parser that functions in a manner similar to the ARGC/ARGV 
parser of UNIX. It contains one procedure, PARSE, which accepts a string as input and 
returns ARGC, a count of the number of tokens in the string, and ARGV, a vector of 
strings, each string containing a token. 

PARSER is instantiated with two strings (DEL for DELIMITER and DEL_TOKEN for 
DELIMITER_TOKEN). The DEL string is composed of characters which delimit each 
token (and are not a part of the token). All characters less than space are automatically 
delimiters, and the DEL string should contain at least one character (such as a space). 
D EL _TOKEN is a string composed of characters which delimit tokens an which are 
tokens themselves. If "=" is a DEL_TOKEN, for example, then "CAT= DOG" is 
composed of three tokens, "CAT", "=", and "DOG", where if "=" is a DEL, then "CAT= 
DOG" is composed of two tokens, "CAT" and "DOG". This assumes that the space 
character is a DEL. 

PARSER may also be instantiated with ARGCJJMTT, which indicates the maximum 
number of tokens allowed. If this limit is exceeded, then the last ARGV token 
contains the remainder of the string. The default value of ARGCJJMTT is 20. 


Catalog of Reusable Software Components, Page 26 


ARG_STRING_LENGTH is the last instantiation option for PARSER. It indicates the 
maximum length of an ARGV string, and it defaults to 80.

Permutations Class 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: DG MV/10000 ADE 2.2 
Abstract: 

This is a generic package which, given an array of items, forms all possible 
permutations using these items. The package does so by providing a generic 
permutation class, within which is an iterator. The iterator has a generic formal 
subprogram to which it passes each permutation. 

The package may make a nice example of the following Ada features: nested generics, 
recursion, generic formal subprograms as a method of implementing an iterator.

Ada Reserved Word Identification 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: DEC Ada, DEC 8600 
Abstract: 

This package contains the single function ' ' is_Ada_re served_ word' ' . It returns with either a 
"true" or "false" to the statement "the input character string is a reserved word in the Ada 
language". 

The contribution of the function is that it executes very quickly, being an implemen tati on 
of the algorithm defined by David Wolverton in "A Perfect Hash Function for Ada 
Reserved Words", as published in Ada Letter, July-August 1984. It is much faster than 
either linear or binary searches of all the Ada reserved words. 

A test driver is included, as is sample test data.

I j | 


ai: i 


Abstract: 


This generic package allows the user to input data types from the keyboard while checking 
the input for errors. (Proper Type: syntax and ranges.) 

A procedure for checking input of characters for a proper subrange of the character set is 
provided. 

When an error is encountered, an error message is displayed and the user is allowed to 
reenter. Output routines are provided to allow the user to do I/O with only one 
instantiation. Screen manipulation (i.e. NEW_LINE) should be done with TEXT_IO 
directly. 

Instantiations require a FIELD_WIDTH which specifies the maximum field width for 
the input of the corresponding type.

SYSDEP DG 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: DG MV 10000, ROLM ADE 
Abstract: 


Catalog of Reusable Software Components, Page 29 



SYSDEP provides GET, PUT, and IS_VALID_CHARACTER as basic I/O routines 
which are defined as follows: 

GET - return the next character from the console without any interpretation (all 128 ASCII 
characters may be input with exceptions as noted by IS_VALID_CHARACTER) and 
without echo (echo must be supplied by the user) 

PUT - output the indicated character without interpretation (any valid character, noted by 
IS_VALID_CHARACTER, may be output by PUT 

This simple pair of defined functions permits a more flexible and constant I/O 
configuration than that provided by TEXT_IO and opens up the door to future tools written 
in Ada, such as communications servers. Adaption of SYSDEP to interface thru CAIS 
definitions, when such definitions are established and placed in use, can be done at a later 
time. OPEN_CONSOLE and CLOSE_CONSOLE must be called before the first use of 
PUT or GET and after the last use of PUT or GET, resp.

TBD 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: Vax 11/785 VMS 4.1 Dec- Ada 
Abstract: 

TBD stands for "To Be Determined". This package is intended to be used during design 
to aid in producing partial designs that are expressed in valid Ada. It also may be used 
advantageously in development while the implementation is incomplete or in rapid 
prototyping. 

In particular, it supplies type definitions, range limits, and default values which may be 
used to assist in describing unknown or partially defined types, objects, and values. 
In addition, it supplies a place-holding procedure call. 

If this TBD_PACKAGE is used, simple searches for the string "TBD" may be used to 
find many places where the design is incomplete. 

N.B.: The types defined here should be used to derive 
those used in the design, rather than being used 
directly (see the usage given below for examles of 
the style).

Variable>Length Direct I/O 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: VAX 1 1/785 VMS 4.1 

DEC Ada 


Abstract: 

This is a package similar to DIRECTJ that operates on records of variable length. The 
body of this package may use CAIS utilities in the future. 

This package allows the user to write elements of differing lengths to a single direct access 
file. This package can be used to write data of all types to a single file (with the aid of 
UNCHECKED_CONVERSION). The DATA_FILE_IO package in the Ada repository 
serves as an example of how this can be accomplished. 

This package also reduces the time-per-byte-of-data-transfered by reducing the number 
of calls to the run time libraray routines associated with the predefined generic package 
DIRECTJX). This is accomplished by placing many incoming records into a large buffer 
and then writng the entire buffer to an external file as a single element (vice versa for 
reading). Bytes_Per_Block, the only generic parameter for this package, determines the 
size (in bytes) of this buffer.

SMTP/FTP 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: Telesoft 1.5 (unvalidated), WICAT/ROS 
Abstract: 

These tools provide the ability to transfer files and to send and receive mail among users 
on diverse hosts. File transfer will use Ada SEQUENTLAL_IO calls to read and write files 
and will interface to TCP(CDRL 0001) to send data across communication lines and 
will interface to Telnet to send and receive all commands and replies. The Simple Mail 
Transfer Protocol to be implemented is RFC821.

Ada_Form 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: UNIX using LEX & CC 
Abstract: 

NOTE: This is a UNIX lex input file. You need a lex 
processor (and C compiler) for this tool!! This 
tool is NOT in Ada. 

Adaform takes a legal Ada program as input and adds Scribe commands. The output is 
then run through Scribe, The form of the output follows die typesetting conventions 
in the Ada LRM, with reserved words in lower-case/boldface. Additionally, comments 
are in italics. Adaform uses the Scribe indexing capability to produce an index of types, 
packages, procedures, etc, indexed by both name and 'class'. For instance, package 


Catalog of Reusable Software Components, Page 46 


Text_IO would be entered as "Text_IO, package" and "Package, Text_IO". Adaform is 
based on the lex input from H. Fisher's Ada grammar.

Ada Grammar 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: UNIX 
Abstract: 

This grammar is organized in the same order as the syntax summary in appendix E of 
the ANSI Ada Reference Manual. All reserved words are written in upper case letters. 
The lexical categories numeric_literal, string_literal, etc, are viewed as terminals. The 
rules for pragmas as stated in chapter 2, section 8, have been incorporated in the 
grammar. Comments are included wherever we had to deviate from the syntax given in 
appendix E. Different symbols used here (to comply with yacc requirements) are of note: 

{.something} is denoted ...something.. 

{something} is denoted ..something.. 

[something] is denoted .something. 


Constructs involving meta brackets, e.g., ...identifier., are represented by a nonterminal 
formed by concatenating the construct symbols ( as ...identifier., in die example) for 
which the rules are given at the end. When reading this grammar, it is important to note 
that all symbols appearing in the rules are separated by one or more blanks. A string 
such as 'identifier_type_mark is actually a single nonterminal symbol defined at the end of 
the rules. The " symbol is used to indicate that the rest of the line is a comment, just as 
in yacc programs. 

This grammar is presented here in a form suitable for input to a yacc parser generator. It 
has been processed by the Bell System HI lex/yacc combination, and tested against over 
400 ACVC tests.

Forms_Generator 

PD:<ADA.FORMGEN> 


Catalog of Reusable Software Components, Page 47 




This subdirectory contains tools for the generation of forms for use by Ada programs. 
The forms generator will display and accept input into a form (in a screen-oriented 
fashion via the virtual terminal) in such a way that this mechanism is transparent to the Ada 
program using it. Instead, the program simply reads fields from the form via procedure 
interfaces.

Forms Generator 2 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: DEC Ada, VAX/VMS 
Abstract: 

This tool is used to seperate an application's procedural code from the code required to 
drive a terminal. The system will provide both an interactive and batch interface that 
enables an application programmer to design a screen format and save the representation 
in a machine readable form. The Form Executor package will provide procedural and 
functional interfaces that enable a program to access the output of the system and present it 
to a terminal. This toolset will support asynchronous ASCII terminals with single 
character transmission capabilities.

KERMIT 


These file contain information on the KERMIT file transfer protocol. KERMIT is a very 
robust protocol which has been recommended by the Network Information Center (NIC) 
of the Defense Data Network (DDN) for file transfers from DDN host computers to 
personal computers through the DDN. Designed by Columbia University, KERMIT is 
useful in moving files from your DDN host computer into your local computing 
environment for use at your facility (if, of course, your DDN host computer is not your 
local computing environment).

Graphic Kernel System 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: ROLM Ada, DG 
Abstract: 


The Graphic Kernel System (GKS) is a device independent software package which 
implements the draft GKS bindin to ANSI Ada for GKS levels Ma, Oa, la, 2a, Mb, Ob, 
lb. Me, and lc. GKS/Ada will support selective visibility, independent VDI and VDM 
interfaces, the configuration of multiple graphic device drivers, and independent packaging 
of the various GKS levels. 

The complete GKS will include a prototype metafile generator/driver, and a metafile 
interpreter. Device-dependent software must be included to drive the Lexidata color rastor 
device and the Summagraphics graphics tablet. Ada software to support contour 
processing requirements, includinggrid generation, mathematical interpolation and contour 
map generation needs to be developed. Also, the GKS and provides for the delivery of 
WIS -compatible equipment capable of high quality 35mm color slides directly from 
graphics displays.

Cost Estimation 

Machine/Compiler: Data General, ROLM ADE 
Abstact : 

The cost estimation tool uses the COCOMO model. It produces manpower and schedule 
estimates. The project scheduler is based on SIMPERT which is a Monte Carlo simulation 
and review technique. It is useful in assessing the effects of requirement changes and 
schedule delays, and in risk analysis. It produces critical path and schedule, the 
probability of completing on schedule, and Gantt chart graphics. The Input File generator 
allows the user to build input files for COCOMO or SIMPERT, and then to modify such 
files.

Requirements_Tracker 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: Dec Ada / VMS 

Abstract: 

This tool is used to trace routines and declarations in the source code back to specific 
paragraphs in a requirements document. For each requirement referenced in a source 
file, the output listing shows what program units reference that requirement. An 
intermediate file containing the pairs (location in code, reference cited) can be saved for 
use in subsequent invocations. When used in this way, the output report can show 
requirements traced to more than one source file.

Date 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: DEC VAX 1 1/750, DEC Ada vl.3 


Abstract: 

This generic package provides arithmetic and logical operations for dates. It strongly 
parallels the required CALENDAR package, but differs primarily in the range of dates 
handled. Like CALENDAR, routines such as SPLIT, MONTH, DAY, and YEAR are 
available. 

The differences between this package and CALENDAR are reflected in the range of dates, 
the inclusion of a DAY_NAME function, and the ability to specify a date with a year and an 
annual Julian day number *. A day is the smallest unit of time in this package. 


An important feature is the ability to subtract dates over the full range of years. Thus, you 
can for example, calculate the number of days between 10/15/1986 and 1/1/1988. Another 
important feature is the ability to add (or subtract) x number of days from a date and obtain 
a (fete x days in the future (or past).

Machine Arithmetic 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: VAX/VMS TeleSoft 
Abstract: 

The purpose of this package is to emulate 36 bit machine host arithmetic on a 32 bit 
host machine. This package will provide support for 36 bit integer, real, and double 
precision real numbers in the form of the standard predefined arithmetic operations. The 
ranges of the supported types are as follows: 

Integer 

range of -2**35 to 2**35- 1 
Real 

range of 10**-38 to 10**38 and 0 
mantissa => 27 bit binary fraction 
exponent => -128 to 127 
Double Precision Real 
range of 10**-38 to 10**38 and 0 
mantissa => 63 bit binary fraction 
exponent => -128 to 127 

Any errors which occur during use of the arithmetic exception declaration in the 
package specification can be changed to a rename of the predefined exception 
"NUMERICLERROR" for programs needing to handle arithmetic errors in a general 
fashion. Conversion functions are provided to assist in programming mixed operand 
(32 and 36 bit) arithmetic, and to facilitate 10. These functions should be renamed if they 


Catalog of Reusable Software Components, Page 62 


will be used extensively so that the impact of the readability of a program's arithmetic 
expressions is minimized. The underlying arithmetic will be performed in twos 
complement arithmetic.

Math Library 2 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: Telesoft and DEC Ada, VAX/VMS 
Abstract: 


Catalog of Reusable Software Components, Page 64 


This package is a floating mantissa definition of a binary FLOAT. It was first used on 
the DEC- 10 and the VAX but should work for any since the parameters are obtained 
by initial sizing on the actual hardware. Otherwise the parameters could be set in the spec if 
known. This is a preliminary package that defines the properties of the particular floating 
point type for which we generate the math routines. 

The constants are those required by the routines described in "Software Manual for the 
Elementary Functions" W. Cody and W. Waite, Prentice-Hall 1980. Actually most are 
needed only for the test programs rather than the functions themselves. Most of these 
could be in the form of attributes if all the floating types to be considered were those built 
into the compiler, but we also want to be able to support user defined types such as 
software floating types of greater precision than the hardware affords, or types defined 
on one machine to simulate another.

Automatic Path Analyzer 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: DEC Ada, VAX/VMS 
Abstract: 

This tool consists of four modules. The Source Instrumenter inserts breakpoints 
(software probes) into Ada source programs to transfer control to execution monitor. 
The Execution Monitor traces paths executed and records information on execution 
frequency of each Ada program unit, code block and statement. The Control Program 
controls execution of the Ada program, allows users to execute Ada programs 
repetitively, and permits user input. The Report Generator provides comprehensive 
analysis of data collected from probes and outputs this information for each set of test 
parameters on frequency of path execution for each Ada program and each program unit.

Calculator Functions 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: WICAT/ROS TeleSoft 
Abstract: 

This tool provides an on-line calculator function. It is set up to handle only integers at the 
present time. One-letter variables may be defined and used. The parser for expressions 
was generated by LR on the VAX. Expressions are terminated by a semi-colon. The 
program normally terminates with a CTRL-B. Error handling is non-existent at this 
time, so syntactic errors will also cause the program to exit.

CAS 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: DEC Ada, VAX/VMS 
Abstract: 

This function calculates the "STATEMENTS" of a valid Ada fragment specified by a 
FILE_NAME string parameter. It need not be a complete compilation unit but it 
should have closed all open parentheses and string brackets. The number of 
STATEMENTS of code is returned as an INTEGER. 

The Ada statement is defined by a semicolon terminator outside of comments, 
parentheses, or string or character literals. This definition is insensitive to formatting or 
layout of the source. 

There are exotic cases for which this will misestimate the count but we have never 
encountered one in real code. 

This copy of the function is embedded in a test and driver program. Running the 
program on its own source file should give The driver has an additional feature of 
correcting for the common error of leaving out the extension on a file name. The 
nature of this extension is system dependent and a ".TXT" is used.

Combine and Break 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: WTCAT/ROS TeleSoft 
Abstract: 

These tools are user to combine separate files into a single file, and to break single files 
into separate files. The code works on file banners which immediately precede each 
file. These tools normally are used to "break" a single source code file into the 
compilable subunits of the file. "Combine" is used to append all of the subunits into one 
file.

CONSTRUCT and CREATE_CO 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: Intellimac 7000M 

UNIX 

Telesoft unvalidated 


Abstract: 

The function of Construct is to perform the minimal number of system commands to bring 
a project up to date given that changes to project files have occurred. If a project is 
already up to date, Construct will indicate this and no commands will be performed. 
Construct can also be used to supply descriptive information in the form of dependency 
graphs and name lists of project files. 

Create_CO reads a set of Ada source code files and creates a configuration object which 
describes the dependencies that exist among the files. The configuration object is formatted 
so that it may be read by Construct. In determining dependencies, Create_CO observes 
the filenaming conventions of the TeleSoft Ada compiler (Le., filename extensions of .text, 
.sym, .code) and the compiler's language restriction that specifications and bodies of Ada 
packages reside in the same file.

Abstract: 

CREATE_TB scans text files and creates a table by selecting specified line entries. The text 
files are assumed to contain standardized entries which are repeated in each file. 
CREATE_TB extracts a subset of these entries compressing their text into a specified 
column width for printing in a tabular form. The entries to be extracted and the width of 
each column may be specified by the user for each table. CREATE_TB will scan a group 
of files identified by a UNIX file pattem(including *, ?, or selectors [aeiou]) and it also 
recognizes PAGE headers of the form:

HELP System 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: VAX 11/785 (VMS 4.2), DEC Ada 
Abstract: 

The HELP System is a collection of programs which provide an interactive online 
documentation facility. Data for the facility is prepared as a conventional text file which is 
formatted in an outline form, as follows: 

0 Topic-Name 

ctext of topic> 

1 Ist-Level-Subtopic 

ctext of subtopio 

9 9th-Level-Subtopic 
<text> 

1 2nd- lst-Level-Subtopic 
<text> 

1 3rd- 1 st-Level- S ubtopic 


Catalog of Reusable Software Components, Page 81 


0 Next-Topic 

The level numbers do not have to be consecutive, and the lower the level number is, the 
higher its entry appears in the hierarchy (level 4 elements appear before level 6). There 
may be as many topics at each level as desired. A line containing only a dot (.) character 
causes a break between screens when the help file is displayed to the user 

this line appears on one screen 

this line appears on the next screen (at the top) 

The HELP System consists of three programs: HELP, HELP_BUILD, and 

HELP.ANALYZE. 

The HELP program is used to display information contained in a help file. This 
information is in the form of a direct-access file created by the HELP_BUILD program. 
Briefly: 


text of help file 

V 

HELP.BUILD 

V 

direct-access help file 

V 

HELP displays info to user 

The HELP_ANALYZE program displays the structure hierarchy of a direct access file 
which is created by HELP_BUILD.

Page 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: DG MV 10000, ROLM ADE 
Abstract: 

PAGE creates a text file containing several other text files separated by the lines: 


filename 


where 'filename' is the name of the file which follows. It accepts as input the name of an 
output file (file to be generated) and the names of the input files, where striking a RETURN 
to the input file name prompt terminates the input of die list of names. 

UNPAGE is the complement of PAGE, which extracts the component files from the 
combined file.

Pager 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: DG MV 1 0000, ROLM ADE 

DEC VAX 11/785, DEC Ada 


Abstract: 

PAGER is a tool which creates, extracts from, and scans paged files, where a paged file is 
a file composed of one or more files prefixed by banners. PAGER is based in 
concept on the UNPAGE tool submitted to the Ada Repository on SIMTEL20 by Mitre 
Corporation. 

Paged files are convenient mechanisms for storing related files. They reduce cluttering 
in the directories and simplify the file transfer process (to and from the Ada Repository, 
for example) by requiring the user to transfer only one file in order to obtain all files 
pertinent to a particular project or tool. Additionally, paged files are text files which can be 
handled more readily than the 8-bit binary images associated with other file grouping 
mechanisms. Paged files may be manipulated by a text editor if necessary.

Abstract: 

UNPAGE is a program which complements the UNIX page command. 
The UNIX page command can be used to combine several source files, 
interspersing file headers of the form: 


FILENAME 


UNPAGE reads such a file breaking the subfiles into separate 

files as indicated by the filename headers. UNPAGE has been enhanced 

to also recognize file headers which have the format of an Ada 

comment:

Documentation Manager 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: VAX/VMS/DEC Ada 
Abstract: 

The document manager maintains a catalog of configuration items stored in the system. 
Configuration items may be obtained from the catalog for read-only use, or for 
modification. Only one modifiable copy can be checked out at a time. When a 
modified configuration item is returned to the library, a new version number is assigned to 
it, so that all versions of an item can be obtained from the catalog. Items in the catalog 
have attributes associated with them and items can be selected by attribute as well as by 
name and version number. For example, an attribute can be the name of the person 
who created the configuration item. One can then easily find all configuration items 
created by a certain person.

Graphics to PDL Aid 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: DEC Ada / VMS 
Abstract: 

The Graphic Ada Designer is a specialized tool for creating graphical Object Oriented 
Design Diagrams (OODDs) for Ada programs and the Program Design Language (PDL) 
representations associated with each OODD. The Graphic Ada Designer is principally 
targeted towards the interactive development of these block-like diagrams in supp ort o f the 
development of Ada software. In particular it is designed to support a varian t of the Ada 
Graphic Notation developed by SYSCON from the Object Oriented Design work of 


Catalog of Reusable Software Components, Page 86 


Grady Booch and a presentation on graphical techniques for analysis given by Dr. R. 
Buhr of Carleton University (see "Software Engineering with Ada" by Grady Booch, and 
"System Design with Ada" by R.J.A. Buhr). 

The Graphic Ada Designer requires a bit- mapped graphics terminal supporting at least a 
minimal display list capability. The implementation will use GKS interfaces when 
possible. Significant emphasis will be placed on the transportability of the applications 
software, with execution efficiency being a secondary consideration (i.e., when due to its 
device and system dependent nature).

PIWG Benchmarks 

PIWG is a suite of tests/benchmarks prepared by the Performance Issues Working Group 
of ACM SIGAda. The purpose of PIWG is to develop the benchmarks and collect and 
disseminate results. The PIWG tests have been under development for many years and 
have been run against many Ada compilers. The PIWG test suite contains over 190 files 
which include Whetstone (to measure processor speed), Dhrystone (to measure statement 
execution per unit time), and other benchmarks which test various attributes of the Ada 
language and their implementations under specific compilers. The PIWG tests must be 
customized for a particular compiler, and instructions are included to do this.

PIWG Benchmarks 

Unit name : PIWG Benchmarks 
Version : TAPE_8_31_86 

Author : ACM SIGAda Performance Issues Working Group (PIWG) 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: Numerous 

PIWG is a suite of tests/benchmarks prepared by the Performance Issues Working Group 
of ACM SIGAda. The purpose of PIWG is to develop the benchmarks and collect and 
disseminate results. 

The PIWG tests have been under development for many years and have been run against 
man y Ada compilers. The PIWG test suit contains over 190 files which include Whetstone 
(to measure processor speed), Dhrystone (to measure statement execution per unit time), 
and other benchmarks which test various attributes of the Ada language and their 
implementations under specific compilers. The PIWG tests must be customized for a 
particular compiler, and instructions are included to do this. 

Some of the items measured by PIWG include: 

* task creation-related timing 

* dynamic elaboration-related timing 

* exception-related timing 

* coding style-related timing 

* TEXT_IO-related timing 

* loop overhead-related timing 

* procedure call-related timing 

* task-related timing 

* compilation, link, and execution tunes

Ada Pretty Printing Program 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: DEC VAX 1 1/785, DEC Pascal 
Abstract: 

This program takes as input an Ada program and reformats the program according to a 
standard set of pretty printing rules. No effort is made to detect or correct syntactic 
errors. See the comments at the front of the program for credits, revision history, and 
details on the pretty printing rules and operation. 

ADAFMT is the original program, extracted from NOSC-TECR with permission of Col 
Bill Whitaker. ADAFMT 1 is a modified version which contains one minor problem: 
"package ... is new" constructs cause the indentation level to increase. Provided files 
include a short documentation file (ADAFMT.DOC) and command files 
(ADAFMT.COM and 
ADAFMT1.COM).

Source Formatter 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: Telesoft 1.3 (unvalidated), WICAT/ROS 
Abstract: 

Package FORMATTER follows a top-down recursive decent algorithm whose 
theory can be found in most compiler theory books. This formatter is designed to work 
for only those programs that are syntactically perfect Due to the size of the sys tem 
that these programs were written on, this package had to be split in two at the last minute. 
Now, in package FORMAT_2, one can find the few procedures that did not call any 
other procedure - those being the ones that could be moved because the compiler did 
not implement bodystubs or any type of "separate" capability. The package was written 
with a Telesoft_Ada compiler, which followed nonANSI standard Ada.

Body Stubber 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: Telesoft 1.3 (unvalidated), WICAT/ROS 
Abstract: 

This program reads an Ada specification and generates a corresponding Body with stubs 
for all subprograms. The compiler used to write these programs was a 1982 (non ANSI 
Standard) Ada compiler, so these packages will need to be updated before they will run 
on a Mil Std 18 15A Ada compiler. All of the compiler peculiarities, editor dependencies, 
and filer dependencies have been moved to the ROS_DEFENDENCIES package, with the 
exception of any peculiarities that might occur due to using 1982 nonANSI standard Ada.

Queuing Simulation 

Machine Compiled/Run on: Data General, ROLM ADE 
Abstract: 

■This tool will simulate the statistical behavior of networks and queues, such as in 
communication systems, transportation and logistics. It will provide a stand-alone, 
single performance prediction function. It will provide useful performance prediction 
information to a user sizing, reconfiguring, or upgrading a system configuration. Data is 
provided interactively and describes a n etwork to be modelled This tool includes complex 
computational algorithms and thus is unusual among the precursors. It is predicted that 
3000 FORTRAN lines will convert to 3750 Ada lines. The coordination of the Ada PDL 
design and the conversion of existing FORTRAN code may present difficulties.

Statement Profiler 

Machine/System Compiled/Run on: AIE Ada, VM-UTS 
Abstract: 

The Statement Profiler counts every instance of each of the various types of Ada statements 
in the given program unit bodies, including comments, distinguishing whole-line 
comments from comments on a line of code. From these raw counts, a series of ratios and 
percentages can then be computed and shown in a table. The raw counts or the profile table 
is written to the default output file. This information can then be used to determine when 
program are inadequately commented or overly complex.
