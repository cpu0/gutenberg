INTRODUCTION 


CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 


This Validation Summary Report (VSR) describes the extent to which a 
specific Ada compiler conforms to the Ada Standard, ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A. 
This report explains all technical terms used within it and thoroughly 
reports the results of testing this compiler using the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability (ACVC). An Ada compiler must be implemented 
according to the Ada Standard, and any implementation-dependent features 
must conform to the requirements of the Ada Standard. The Ada Standard 
must be implemented in its entirety, and nothing can be implemented that is 
not in the Standard.^ 

Even though all validated Ada compilers conform to the Ada Standard, it 
must be understood that some differences do exist between implementations. 
The Ada Standard permits some implementation dependencies—for example, the 
maximum length of identifiers or the maximum values of integer types. 
Other differences between compilers result from the characteristics of 
particular operating systems, hardware, or implementation strategies. All 
the dependencies observed during the process of testing this compiler are 
give n in this repo rt.' 


The information in this report is derived from the test results produced 
during validation testing. The validation process includes submitting a 
suite of standardized tests, the ACVC, as inputs to an Ada compiler and 
evaluating the results."NThe purpose of validating is to ensure conformity 
of the compiler to the Ada\Standard by testing that the compiler properly 
implements legal language constructs and that it identifies and rejects 
illegal language constructs. The testing also identifies behavior that is 
implementation dependent, but is permitted by the Ada Standard. Six 
classes of tests are used. These tests are designed to perform checks at 
compile time, at link time, and during execution. ^ 




1.1 PURPOSE OF THIS VALIDATION SUNNARY REPORT 


This VSR documents the results of the validation testing performed on an 
Ada compiler. Testing was carried out for the following purposes; 






INTRODnCTIOM 


To attempt to identify any language constructs supported by the 
compiler that do not conform to the Ada Standard 

To attempt to identify any language constructs not supported by 
the compiler but required by the Ada Standard 

To determine that the implementation-dependent behavior is allowed 
by the Ada Standard 


Testing of this compiler was conducted by the AVF according to 
procedures established by the Ada Joint Program Office and administered by 
the Ada Validation Organization (AVO).

designate a single test, which may comprise one or more 
files. 


Withdrawn 

test 


An ACVC test found to be incorrect and not used to check 
conformity to the Ada Standard. A test may be incorrect 
because it has an invalid test objective, fails to meet its 
test objective, or contains illegal or erroneous use of the 
language. 


1.5 ACVC TEST CLASSES 


Conformity to the Ada Standard is measured using the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains both legal and illegal Ada programs structured into six test 
classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies 
the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable, 
and special program units are used to report their results during 
execution. Class B tests are expected to produce compilation errors. 
Class L tests are expected to produce errors because of the way in which a 
program library is used at link time. 

Class A tests ensure the successful compilation and execution of legal Ada 
programs with certain language constructs which cannot be verified at run 
time. Thera are no explicit program components in a Class A test to check 
semantics. For example, a Class A test checks that reserved words of 
another language (other than those already reserved in the Ada language) 
are not treated as reserved words by an Ada compiler. A Class A test is 
passed if no errors are detected at compile time and the program executes 
to produce a PASSED message. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. 
Class B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is conipiled and 
the resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that every syntax 
or semantic error in the test is detected. A Class B test is passed if 
every illegal construct that it contains is detected by the compiler. 




INTRODUCTION 


Class C tests check the run time system to ensure that legal Ada programs 
can be correctly compiled and executed. Each Class C test is self-checking 
and produces a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result when it is executed. 

Class D tests check the compilation and execution capacities of a compiler. 
Since there are no capacity requirements placed on a compiler by the Ada 
Standard for some parameters—for example, the number of identifiers 
permitted in a compilation or the number of units in a library—a compiler 
may refuse to compile a Class D test and still be a conforming compiler. 
Therefore, if a Class D test fails to compile because the capacity of the 
compiler is exceeded, the test is classified as inapplicable. If a Class D 
test compiles successfully, it is self-checking and produces a PASSED or 
FAILED message during execution. 

Class E tests are expected to execute successfully and check 
implementation-dependent options and resolutions of ambiguities in the Ada 
Standard. Each Class E test is self-checking and produces a NOT 
APPLICABLE, PASSED, or FAILED message when it is compiled and executed. 
However, the Ada Standard permits an implementation to reject programs 
containing some features addressed by Class E tests during compilation. 
Therefore, a Class E test is passed by a compiler if it is compiled 
successfully and executes to produce a PASSED message, or if it is rejected 
by the compiler for an allowable reason. 

Class L tests check that incomplete or illegal Ada programs involving 
multiple, separately compiled units are detected and not allowed to 
execute. Class L tests are compiled separately and execution is attempted. 
A Class L test passes if it is rejected at link time—that is. an attempt 
to execute the main program must generate an error message before any 
declarations in the main program or any units referenced by the main 
program are elaborated. In some cases, an implementation may legitimately 
detect errors during compilation of the test. 

Two library units, the package REPORT and the procedure CHECK_FILE, support 
the self-checking features of the executable tests. The package REPORT 
provides the mechanism by which executable tests report PASSED, FAILED, or 
NOT APPLICABLE results. It also provides a set of identity functions used 
to defeat some compiler optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that 
would circumvent a test objective. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to 
check the contents of text files written by some of the Class C tests for 
Chapter 14 of the Ada Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECX_FTLE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. These tests produce messages that 
are examined to verify that the units are operating correctly. If these 
units are not operating correctly, then the validation is not attempted. 

The text of each test in the ACVC follows conventions that are intended to 
ensure that the tests are reasonably portable without modification. For 
example, the tests make use of only the basic set of 55 characters, contain 
lines with a maximum length of 72 characters, use small numeric values, and 
tests. However, some tests contain values that require the test to be 





TTITPGDUC-IOi; 


customized according to implementation-specific ••alues — for example, an 
illegal file name. A list of the values used for this validation is 
provided in Appendix C. 

A compiler must correctly process each of the tests in the suite and 
demonstrate conformity to the Ada Standard by either meeting the pass 
criteria given for the test or by showing that the test is inapplicable to 
the implementation. The applicability of a test to an implementation is 
considered each time the implementation is validated. A test that is 
inapplicable for one validation is not necessarily inapplicable for a 
subsequent validation. Any test that was determined to contain an illegal 
language construct or an erroneous language construct is withdrawn from the 
ACVC and, therefore, is not used in testing a compiler. The tests 
withdrawn at the time of this validation are given in Appendix D.

2'. 2 IHFLENEN7ATI0N CHARACTERISTICS 

One of the purposes of ’validating compilers is to determine the behavior of 
a compiler in those areas of the Ada Standard that permit implementations 
to differ. Class D and E tests specifically check for such imple.mentation 
differences. However, tests in other classes also characterize an 
implementation. The tests demonstrate the following characteristics; 

a. Capacities. 

1) The compiler correctly processes a compilation 
containing 723 variables in the same declarative part. (See 
i.est D2S002K.) 

21 The compiler correctly processes tests containing 

loop statements nested to 6? levels. (See tests D55A03A..H 
(3 tests) .) 

3) The compiler correctly processes tests containing 

block statements nested to 65 levels. (See test D56001B.) 

4) The compiler correctly processes tests containing 

recursive procedures separately compiled as subunits nested to 
17 levels. (See tests D54005E..G (3 tests).) 

b. Predefined types. 

1) This implementation supports the additional predefined types 
SHORT_INTEGER, SHORT_SHORT_INTEGER and LCNG_FLOAT in the 
package STANDARD. (See tests B86001T..Z (7 tests).) 

c. Expression evaluation. 

The order in which expressions are evaluated and the time at which 

constraints are checked are not defined by the language. While 

the ACVC tests do not specifically attempt to determine the order 

of evaluation of expressions, test results indicate the following: 

1) Some of the default initialization expressions 
for record components are evaluated before any value is 
checked for membership in a component's subtype. (See test 
C32117A.) 

2) Assignments for subtypes are performed with the same 
precision as the base type. (See test C35712B.) 

3) This implementation uses no extra bits for extra precision 
and uses no extra bits for extra range. (See test C35903A.) 

4) NUNERIC_ERROR is raised for predefined and largest integer 





CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


comparison tests, and NUMERIC_ERROR is raised for predefined 
and largest integer membership tests, nad no exception is 
raised for smallest integer membership tests when an integer 
literal operand in a comparison or membership test is outside 
the range of the base type. (See test C45232A.) 

5) NUHERIC_ERROR is raised when a literal operand in a 
fixed-point comparison or membership test is outside the range 
of the base type. (See test C45252A.) 

6) Underflow is not gradual. (See tests C45524A..Z (26 

tests).) 


d. Rounding. 

The method by which values are rounded in type conversions is not 
defined by the language. While the ACVC tests do not specifically 
attempt to determine the method of rounding, the test results 
indicate the following: 

1) The method used for rounding to integer is round to even. 
(See tests C46012A..Z (26 tests).) 

2) The method used for rounding to longest integer is round 
to even. (See tests C46012A..Z (26 tests).) 

3) The method used for rounding to integer in static universal 
real expressions is round away from zero. (See test C4A014A.) 


e. Array types. 

An implementation is allowed to raise NTTMERIC_ERROR. or 

CONSTRAINT_ERROR for an array having a 'LENGTH that exceeds 

STANDARD.INTEGER'LAST and/or SYSTEM.MAX_INT. For this 

implementation: 

1) Declaration of an array type or subtype declaration with more 
than SYSTEM.MAX_INT components raises no exception under the 
specific circumstances test C36003A. 

2) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when 'LENGTH is applied to an array 
type with INTEGER'LAST + 2 components. (See test C36202A.' 

3) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when an array type with 

SYSTEM.HAX_INT + 2 components is declared. (See test 

C36202B.) 

4) A paclted BCOLEAN array having a 'LENGTH exceeding INTEGER'LAST 









CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


raises NUMERIC_ERROR. (See test C52103X.) 

5) A packed two-dimensional BOOLEAN array with more than 
INTEGER'LAST components raises NUHERIC_ERROR when the length 
of a dimension is calculated and exceeds INTEGER'LAST. (See 
test C52104Y.) 

6) In assigning one-dimensional array types, the expression is 

evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is 
raised when checking whether the expression's subtype is 

compatible with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

7) In assigning two-dimensional array types, the expression 

is not evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is 
raised when checking whether the expression's subtype is 

compatible with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

8) A null array with one dimension of length greater than 
INTEGER'LAST may raise NUMERTC_ERROR or CONSTRAINT_ERROR 
either when declared or assigned. Alternatively, an 
implementation may accept the declaration. However, lengths 
must match in array slice assignments. This implementation 
raises NUMERIC_ERROR. (See test E52103Y.) 


f. Discriminated types. 

1) In assigning record types with discriminants, the expression 
is evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT^ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


g. Aggregates. 

1) In the evaluation of a multi-dimensional aggregate, the test 
results indicate that index subtype checks are 
made as choices are evaluated. (See tests C43207A and 
C43207B.) 

2) In the evaluation of an aggregate containing subaggregates, 
not all choices are evaluated before being checked for 
identical bounds. (See test E43212B.) 

3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised after all choices are 

evaluated when a bound in a non-null range of a non-null 
aggregate does not belong to an index subtype. (See test 

E43211B.) 



CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


h. Pragmas. 

1) The pragma INLINE is not supported for procedures or func¬ 
tions. (See tests LA3004A..B (2 tests), EA3004C..D (2 tests), 
and CA3004E..F (2 tests).) 


i. Generics. 

This implementation creates a dependence between a generic body 

and those units which instantiate it. As allowed by IA-408/11, if 

the body is compiled after a unit that instantiates it, then that 

unit becomes obsolete. 

1) Generic specifications and bodies can be compiled 

in separate compilations. (See tests CA1012A, CA2009C, 

CA2009F, BC3204C, and BC3205D.) 

2) Generic subprogram declarations and bodies can be 

compiled in separate compilations. (See tests CA1012A and 
CA2009F.) 

3) Generic library subprogram specifications and bodies can 
be compiled in separate compilations. (See test 
CA1012A.) 

4) Generic non-library pacltage bodies as subunits can 

be compiled in separate compilations. (See test CA2009C.} 

5) Generic non-library subprogram bodies can be 
compiled in separate compilations from their stubs. (See test 
CA2009F.) 

6) Generic unit bodies and their subunits can be 
compiled in separate compilations. (See test CA3011A.) 

7) Generic package declarations and bodies can be 
compiled in separate compilations. (See tests CA2009C, 
BC3204C, and BC3205D.) 









CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


3) Generic library package specifications and bodies can 

be compiled in separate compilations. (See tests 
BC3204C and BC3205D.) 

9) Generic unit bodies and their subunits can be 

compiled in separate compilations. (See test CA3011A.) 


j. Input and output. 

1) The package SEQUENTIAL_IO can be instantiated with uncon¬ 

strained array types or record types with discriminants with¬ 
out defaults. (See tests AE2101C, EE2201D, and EE2201E.) 

2) The package DIRECT_TO cannot be instantiated with uncon¬ 

strained array types or record types with discriminants with¬ 
out defaults. (See tests AE2101H, EE2401D, and EE2401G.) 

3) Modes IN_FTLE and OUT_FTLE are supported for SEOUENTTAL_IO. 
(See tests CE2102D..E, CE2102N, and CE2102P.) 

4) Modes IN_FTLE, OUT_FILE, and INOUT_FIIjE are supported for 
DIRECT_IO. (See tests CE2102F, CE2102I..J (2 tests), CE2102R, 
CE2102T, and CE2102V.) 

5) Modes IN_FILE and OUT_FILE are supported for text files. 
(See tests CE3102E and~CE3102I..K (3 tests).) 

6) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for 
SEQUENTIAL^IO. (See tests CE2102G and CE2102X.) 

7) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for DIRECT_IO. 
(See tests CE2102K and CE2102Y.) 

8) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for text 
files. (See tests CE3io2F..G (2 tests), CE3104C, CE3110A, and 
CE3114A.) 

9) Overwriting to a sequential file does not truncate the file. 
(See test CE2208B.) 

10) Temporary sequential files are given names and not 
deleted when closed. (See test CE2108A.) 

11) Temporary direct files are not given names and not 
deleted when closed. (See test CE2108C.) 

12) Temporary text files are not given names and not deleted 
when closed. (See test CE3112A.) 





COtiFIGURATION INFORMATinn 


13) More than one internal file can be associated w-i.t-h 

each external file for sequential files when reading 

only. (See tests CE2107A..E (5 tests), CE2102L, CE2110B, and 
CE2111D.) 

14) More than one internal file can be associated with 

each external file for direct files when reading only. (See 
tests CE2107F..H (3 tests), CE2110D and CE2111H.)

TEST INFORMATION' 


CHAPTER 3 
TEST INFORMATION 


3.1 TEST RESULTS 

Version 1.10 of the ACVC comprises 3717 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, 44 tests had been withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF 
determined that 312 tests were inapplicable to this implementation. 
All inapplicable tests were processed during validation testing except for 
201 executable tests that use floating-point precision exceeding 
that supported by the implementation. Modifications to the code, 
processing, or grading for 12 tests were required to successfully 
demonstrate the test objective. (See section 3.6.) 

The AVF concludes that the testing results demonstrate acceptable 
conformity to the Ada Standard.

3.5 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

Some tests do not apply to all compilers because they make use of features 
that a compiler is not required by the Ada Standard to support. Others may 
depend on the result of another test that is either inapplicable or 
withdrawn. The applicability of a test to an implementation is considered 
each time a validation is attempted. A test that is inapplicable for one 
validation attempt is not necessarily inapplicable for a subsequent 
attempt. For this validation attempt, 312 tests were inapplicable for 

a. The following 201 tests are not applicable because they have 
floating-point type declarations requiring more digits than 
SYSTEM.MAX_DIGITS: 

C24113L..Y {14 tests) C35705L..Y (14 tests) 

C35706L..Y (14 tests) C35707L..Y (14 tests) 

C35708L..Y (14 tests) C35802L..Z (15 tests) 

C45241L..Y (14 tests) C45321L..Y (14 tests)

b. C35508I, C35508J, C35508H, and C35508W are not applicable because 

they include enumeration representation clauses for BOOLEAN types 
in which the representation values are other than (FALSE => 0, 

TRUE => 1). Under the terms of AI-00325, this implementation is 

not required to support such representation clauses. 

c. C35702A and B86001T are not applicable because this implementation 
supports no predefined type SHORT_FLOAT. 

d. C45531M..P (4 tests) and C45532M..P (4 tests) are not applicable 

because they acquire a value of SYSTEM.MAX MANTISSA greater than 
32. 

e. C52008B is not applicable because this implementation generates 
code to calculate the maximum object size for type REC2 at run 
time which yields a number exceeding INTEGER'LAST and raises 
MUMERIC_ERROR. 

f. C86001F is not applicable because, for this implementation, the 
pac)cage TEXT_I0 is dependent upon package SYSTEM. These tests 
recompile package SYSTEM, making package TEXT_I0, and 
hence package REPORT, obsolete. 

g. B86001Y is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined fixed-point type other than DURATION. 

h. B86001Z is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined floating-point type with a name other than FLOAT, 
LONG_FLOAT, or SHORT^FLOAT. 

i. The following 16 tests are not applicable because this 
implementation does not support a predefined type LONG_INTEGER: 


C45231C 

C45304C

B55B09C 

B86001V 

CA20C'C, CA2009F, BC3204C 

and BC3205D 

are not applicable because 


this implementation creates a dependence between a generic body 
and those units which instantiate it (See Section 2.2.i and 
Appendix F of the Ada Standard) . 

k. LA3004A, EA3004C, and CA3004E are not applicable because this 

implementation does not support pragma INLINE for procedures. 

l. LA3004B, EA3004D, and CA3004F are not applicable because this

implementation does not support pragma INLINE for functions. 

m. CD1009C, CD2A41A..B (2 tests), CD2A41E and CD2A42A..J (10 tests) 
are not applicable because of restrictions on ’SIZE length clauses 
for floating point types. 

n. CD1C04E is not applicable because this implementation does not 
support component clauses specifying more than 8 bits for boolean 
components of a record. 

o. CD2A61I..J (2 tests) are not applicable because of restrictions on 
'SIZE length clauses for array types. 

p. CD2A84B..I (8 tests) and CD2A84K..L (2 tests) are not applicable 
because of restrictions on 'SIZE length clauses for access types. 

g. AE2101H, EE2401D, and EE2401G use instantiations of package 

DIRECT_I0 with unconstrained array types and record types with 
discriminants without defaults. These instantiations are rejected 
by this compiler.

text files. The proper exception is raised when multiple access 
is attempted. 




T"ST INFORMATION 


3.6 TEST, PROCESSING, AND EVALUATION MODIFICATIONS 

It is expected that some tests will require modifications of code, 
processing, or evaluation in order to compensate for legitimate 
implementation behavior. Modifications are made by the AVF in cases where 
legitimate implementation behavior prevents the successful completion of an 
(otherwise) applicable test. Examples of such modifications include: 
adding a length clause to alter the default size of a collection; splitting 
a Class B test into subtests so that all errors are detected; and 
confirming that messages produced by an executable test demonstrate 
conforming behavior that was not anticipated by the test (such as raising 
one exception instead of another). 

Modifications were required for 12 tests. 

The following tests were split because syntax errors at one point resulted 
in the compiler not detecting other errors in the test: 

B71001E B71001K B71001O B71001U BA2001C 

3A2001E BA3006A BA3006B BA3007B 3A3003A 

3A3008B BA3013A (6 and 7 h) 


3.7 ADDITIONAL TESTING INFORMATION 
3.7.1 Prevalidation 

Prior to validation, a set of test results for ACVC Version 1.10 produced 
by the TeleGen2 Ada Development System for a computing system based on 
the same instruction set architecture was submitted to the AVF by the 
applicant for review. Analysis of these results demonstrated that the 
TeleGen2 System successfully passed all applicable tests, and it 
exhibited the expected behavior on all inapplicable tests. The applicant 
certified that testing results for the computing system of this validation 
would be identical to the ones submitted for review prior to validation. 


3.7.2 Test Method 

Testing of the TeleGen2 Ada Development System for using ACVC Version 1.10 
was conducted on-site by a validation team from the Avr. The configuration 
in which the testing was performed is described by the following 
designations of hardware and software components: 

Host computer: v^x 3800 under VAX/VMS 5.2 

Target computer ; Motorola MVHE181 (MC88100) 

bare machine 


A tape containing the customized test suite was loaded onto the host 
computer. Results were evaluated and archived on tape using the host 





computer. 


The compiler was tested using command scripts provided by TeleSoft 
and reviewed by the validation team. The tests were compiled using the 
command 

TSADA/E38/ADA/VTRTUAL=3000/EIIABLt <test file> 

and bound and linked with the commands 

TSADA/E38/BIND/VTRTUAL=3000/ENABLE <main unit> 
TSADA/E88/LrNK/OPTIOMS=<optionsfile> '^main unit> 

where <optionsfile> contained the lines 

TARGET MC88100 
Input/OFi'!/Phantom RTL_V!-!E181 
LOCATE/AT 16#08A0000#“ 

Map/Local 

The linked executable images were downloaded to the specified target via an 
RS232 serial 8-bit link using the Telesoft Downloader and Receiver 
utilities. Test results were logged and accumulated by the host system. 

The /List qualifier was added to the compiler call for class B and E tests. 
See Appendix E for explanation of compiler and linker switches. 

Tests were compiled, linked, and executed (as appropriate) using a single 
computer. Test output, compilation listings, and job logs were 
captured on magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined 
on-site by the validation team were also archived. 


3.7,3 Test Site 

Testing was conducted at TeleSoft, San Diego, USA, and was completed on 
27 November 1989.

Appendix F 


1. Implementation Dependent Pragmas 

pragma COMMENT(<3tring_literal>); 

It may only appear within a compilation unit. 

The pragma comment has the effect of embedding the given 
sequence of characters in the object code of the compilation unit. 

pragma LINKNAME(<3ubprogram_name>, <3tring_literal>); 

It may appear in any declaration section of a unit. 

This pragma must also appear directly after an interface pragma 
for the same <subprogram_name>. The pragma linkname has the 
effect of making string_literal apparent to the linker. 

pragma INTERRUPT(Function_Mapping); 

It may only appear immediately before a simple accept statement, 
a while loop directly enclosing only a single accept statement, 
or a select statement that includes an interrupt accept alternative. 
The pragma interrupt has the effect that entry calls to the 
associated entry, on behalf of an interrupt, are made with a 
reduced call overhead. 

pragma IMAGES(<enumeration_type>,Deferred) or 
pragma IMAG ES (< enumeration_type>,Immediate); 

It may only appear within a compilation unit. 

The pragma images controls the creation and allocation of 
the image table for a specified enumeration type. The 
default is Deferred, which saves space in the literal pool 
by not creating an image table for an enumeration type 
unless the ’Image, ’Value, or ’Width attribute for the type 
is used. If one of these attributes is used, an image table 
is generated in the literal pool of the compilation unit in 
which- the attribute appears. If the attributes are used in 
more than one compilation unit, more than one image table is 
generated, eliminating the benefits of deferring the table. 

pragma SUPPRESS_ALL; 

It may appear anywhere that a Suppress pragma may appear as 
defined by the Language Reference Manual. The pragma 
Suppress_All has the effect of turning off all checks 
defined in section 11.7 of the Language Reference Manual. 

The scope of applicablility of this pragma is the same as 
that of the pre-defined pragma Suppress.

2. Implementation Dependent Attributes 


’Offset Attribute 

’Offset along with the attribute ’Address, facilitates machine code 
insertions. For a prefix P that denotes a declared parameter 
object, P’Offset yields the statically known portion of the 
address of the first of the storage units allocated to P. The 
value is the object’s offset relative to a base register and is 
of type Long_Integer. 


INTEGER ATTRIBUTES 


’Extended Image Attribute 


Usage: X’Extended_Image(Item,Width,Base,Based,Space_IF_Positive) 

Returns the image associated with Item as per the Text_Io definition. 
The Text_Io definition states that the value of Item is an integer 
literal with no underlines, no exponent, no leading zeros 
(but a single zero for the zero value) and a minus sign if negative. 

If the resulting sequence of characters to be output has fewer than 
Width characters then leading spaces are first output to make up 
the difference. (LRM 14.3.7:10,14.3.7:11) 

For a prefix X that is a discrete type or subtype; this attribute 
is a function that may have more than one parameter. The parameter 
Item must be an integer value. The resulting string is 
without underlines, leading zeros, or trailing spaces.

Appendix F, Cont. 


Parameter Descriptions: 

Item — The user specifies the item that he wants the 

image of and passes it into the function. This 
parameter is required. 

Width — The user may specify the minimum number.of 

characters to be in the string that is returned. 

If no width is specified then the default (0) is 
assumed. 

Base — The user may specify the base that the image is 

to be displayed in. If no base is specified then 
the default (10) is assumed. 

Based — The user may specify whether he wants the string 

returned to be in base notation or not. If no 
preference is specified then the default (false) 
is assumed. 

Space_If_Positive — The user may specify whether or not the sign bit 
of a positive integer is included in the string 
returned. If no preference is specified then 
the default (false) is assumed. 

Examples: 

Suppose the following subtype was declared: 

Subtype X is Integer Range -10.. 16; 

Then the following would be true: 

X’Extended_Image(5) = ”5” 

X’Extended_Image(5,0) = "5" 

X’Extended_Image(5,2) = " 5” 

X’Extended_Image(5,0,2) = "101" 

X’Extended_Image(5,4,2) = " 101" 

X’Extended_Image(5,0,2,True) = "2#101#" 

X’Extended_Image(5,0,10,False) = "5" 

X’Extended_Image(5,0,10,False,True) = " 5" 
X’Extended_Image(-l,0,10,False,False) = "-1" 
X’Extended_Image(-l,0,10,False,True) = "-1" 
X’Extended_Image(-l,l,10,False,True) "-1" 
X’Extended_Image(-l,0,2,True,True) = "-2#1#" 
X’Extended_Image(-l,10,2,True,True) = " -2#1#"

Appendix F, Cont. 


’Extended Vaiue Attribute 


Usage; X’Extended_ValuefItem) 

Returns the value associated with Item as per the Text_Io definition. 
The Text_Io definition states that given a string, it reads an 
integer value from the beginning of the string. The value returned 
corresponds to the sequence input. (LRM 14.3.7:14) 

For a prefix X that is a discrete type or subtype; this attribute 
is a function with a single parameter. The actual parameter Item 
must be of predefined type string. Any leading or trailing 
spaces in the string X are ignored. In the case where an illegal 
string is passed, a CONSTRAlNT_ERROR is raised. 

Pju-ameter Descriptions: 

Item — The user passes to the function a parameter of the 
predefined type string. The type of the returned 
value is the base type X. 

Examples: 

Suppose the following subtype was declared: 

Subtype X is Integer Range -10..16; 

Then the following would be true: 


X’Extended_VaIue("5”) = 5 

X’Extended_VaIue(" 5") = 5 

X’Extended_Value("2#101#”) =5 

X’Extended_Value("-l") =-1 

X’Extended_Value("-1") =-1

Appendix F, Cont. 

’Extended_Width Attribute 

Usage: X’Extended_Width(Base,Based,Space_If_Positive) 

Returns the width for subtype of X. 

For a prefix X that is a discrete subtype; this attribute 
is a function that may have multiple parameters. This attribute 
yields the maximum image length over all values of the type 
or subtype X. 

Parameter Descriptions: 

Base — The user specifies the base for which the width 

will be calculated. If no base is specified 
‘ then the default (10) is assumed. 

Based — The user specifies whether the subtype is stated 

in based notation. If no vatlue for based is 
specified then the default (false) is assumed. 
Space_If_Positive — The user may specify whether or not the sign bit 
of a positive integer is included in the string 
returned. If no preference is specified then the 
default (false) is assumed. 

Examples: 

Suppose the following subtype was declared: 

Subtype X is Integer Range -10..16; 

Then the following would be true: 

X’Extended_Width *3 -"-10" 

X’Extended_Width( 10) 

X’Extended_Width(2) 

X’Extended_Width( 10,True) 

X'Extended _Width(2,T rue)

ENUMERATION ATTRIBUTES 


’Extended_Lnage Attribute 

Usage: X’Extended_Image(Item,Width,Uppercase) 

Returns the image associated with Item as per the Text_Io definition. 
The Text_Io definition states that given an enumeration literal, 
it will output the value of the enumeration literal (either an 
identifier or a character literal). The character case parameter 
is ignored for character literals. (LRM 14.3.9:9) 

For a prefix X that is a discrete type or subtype; this attribute 
is a function that may have more that one parameter. The parameter 
Item must be an enumeration value. The image of an enumeration 
value is the corresponding identifier which may have character case 
and return string width specified. 


Parameter Descriptions: 

Item — The user specifies the item that he wants the image of and 
passes it into the function. This parameter is required. 

Width — The user may specify the minimum number of characters to 
be in the string that is returned. If no width is 
specified then the default (0) b assumed. If the Width 
specified is larger than the image of Item, then the 
return string is padded with trailing spetces; if the 
Width specified is smaller than the image of Item then 
the default is assumed and the image of the enumeration 
value is output completely. 

Uppercase — The user may specify whether the returned string is in 
uppercase characters. In the case of an enumeration

Returns the image associated with Item as per the Text_Io definition. 
The Text_Io definition states that it outputs the value of the 
parameter Item as a decimal literal with the format defined by the 
other parameters. If the value is negative then a minus sign 
is included in the integer part of the value of Item. If Exp 
is 0 then the integer part of the output has as many digits as 
are needed to represent the integer part of the vdue of Item or 
is zero if the value of Item has no integer part. (LRM 14.3.8:13, 
14.3.8:15) 

For a prefix X that is a discrete type or subtype; this attribute 
is a function that may have more than one parameter. The pareimeter 
Item must be a Real value. The resulting string is 
without underlines or trailing spaces. 


Parameter Descriptions: 

Item — The user specifies the item that he wants the image of and 
passes it into the function. This parameter is required. 

Fore — The user may specify the minimum number of charewrters for 
the integer part of the decimal representation in the 
return string. This includes a minus sign if the 
value is negative 2 uid the base with the if based 
notation is specified. If the integer part to be output 
has fewer characters than specified by Fore, then leading 
spaces are output first to make up the difference. If no 
Fore is specified then the default (2) value is eissumed. 

Aft — The user may specify the minimum number of decimal digits 
after the decimal point to accommodate the precision desired. 
If the delta of the type or subtype is greater than 
0.1 then Aft is one. If no Aft is specified then the 
default (X'Digits-1) is assumed. If based notation is 
specified the trailing is included in aft. 

Exp — The user may specify the minimum number of digits in the 
exponent; the exponent consists of a sign and the exponent, 
possibly with leading zeros. If no Exp is specified then 
the default (3 ) is assumed. If Exp is 0 then no exponent 
is used.

4. Restrictions on Representation Clauses 

The hardware needs a minimum of 32 bits to represent floating point 
and access types. Therefore, specifying a size of less than 32 bits cannot 
be handled simply by the underlying hardware (LRM 13.1 (10)). 

The Compiler supports the following representation clauses: 

Length Clauses: for enumeration and derived integer types ’SIZE 
attribute (LRM 13.2(a)) 

Length Clauses: for composite types ’SIZE attribute (LRM 13.2(a) 

Size clauses for composite types are rejected when the 
specified size implies compression of composite components. 

Length Clauses: for access types ’STORAGE_SIZE attribute (LRM 13.2(b)) 

Length Clauses: for tasks types ’STORAGE_SIZE attribute (LRM 13.2(c)) 

Length Clauses: for fixed point types ’SMALL attribute (LRM 13.2(d)) 

Enumeration Clauses: for character and enumeration types other than 
boolean (LRM 13.3) 

Record representation Clauses (LRM 13.4) with following constraints: 

- Each component of the record must be specified with 
a component clause. 

- The alignment of the record is restricted to mod 2, 
word (16 bit)aligned. 

- Bits are ordered right to left within a byte. 

Address Clauses: for objects, entries and external subprograms 
(pragma INTERFACE used) (LRM 13.5(a)(c)) 

This compiler does NOT support the following representation clauses: 

Enumeration Clauses: for boolean (LRM 13.3) 

Address Clauses: for packages, task units, and non-external Ada 
subprograms (LRM 13.5(b))

Appendix F, Cont. 

5. Impiementation dependent naming conventions 

There are no implementation-generated names denoting implementation 
dependent components. 

6. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clause 

Expressions that appear in address specifications are interpreted as the 
first storage unit of the object. 

7. Restrictions on Unchecked Conversions 

Unchecked conversions are allowed between any types or subtypes unless 
the target type is an unconstrained record or array type. 


8. I/O Package Characteristics 

Sequential_IO can be instantiated for unconstrained array 

types or unconstrained types with discriminants without default values, 

but not Direct_IO. 

In TEXT 10 the type COUNT is defined as follows: 

type COUNT is range 0 .. 2_147_483_646; 

In TEXT_IO the subtype FIELD is defined as follows: 

subtype FIELD is INTEGER range 0..1000; 

In TEXT_IO, the Form parameter of procedures Create and Open is not 
supported. (If you supply a Form parameter with either procedure, it 
is ignored.)

VTTHDRA'JN TESTS 


Some tests are withdrawn from the AC^C because they do not conform to the 
Ada Standard. The following 44 tests had been withdrawn at the ti'^e of 
validation testing for the reasons indicated. A reference of the for-^ 
Al-ddddd is to an Ada Commentary. 


a. S23005C This test expects that the string "— TO? OF PAGE. 

63" of line 204 will appear at the top of the listing page due 
to a pragma PAGE in line 203; bit line 203 contains text that 
follows the pragma, and it is this that mu.st appear at the top 
of the page. 

b. A39005G This test unreasonably expects a component clause to 

pack an array component into a minimum, size (line 30) . 

c. B97102E This test contains an unitended illegality: a select 

statement contains a null statement at the place of a selective 
wait alternative (line 31) . 

d. C97116A This test contains race conditi'^ns, and it assumes that 
guards are evaluated indivisibly. A conforming implementation 
may use interleaved execution in such a way that the evaluation 
of the guards at lines 50 & 54 and the execution of task CHANGING- 
_OF_THE_GUARD results in a call to REPORT.FAILED at one of 
lines 52 or 56. 

e. 3C3009B This test wrongly expects that circular instantiations 
will be detected in several compilation units e^en though none of 
the units is illegal with respect to the units it depends on; by 
AI-00256, the illegality need not be detected until execution is 
attempted (line 95) . 

f. CD2A62D This test wrongly requires that an array object's size 
be no greater than 10 although its subtype's size was specified 
to be 40 (line 137) . 





'JTTwriRAy'i tests 


g. CD2A53rt..D, CD2A66A..D, CD2A73A..D, CD2A76A..D [16 tests] These 
tests wrongly attempt to check the size of objects of a derived 
type (for which a 'SIZE length clause is given) by passing them 
to a derived subprogram (which implicitly converts them to the 
parent type (Ada standard 3.4:14)). Additionally, they use the 
'SIZE length clause and attribute, whose interpretation is 
considered problematic by the UG9 ARG. 

h. CD2A81G, CD2A83G, CD2A84M & M, i CD50110 [5 tests] These tests 

assume that dependent tasks will terminate while the main pro¬ 
gram executes a loop that simply tests for task termination; this 
is not the case, and the main program may loop indefinitely 
flines 74, 35, 86 4 96, 86 & 96, and 58, resp.). 

i. CD2B15C 4 CD7205C These tests expect that a 'STORAGE_SIZE 
length clause provides precise control over the number of 
designated objects in a collection; the Ada standard 13.2:15 
allows that such control must not be expected. 

j. CD2D11B This test gives a SMALL representation clause for a 

derived fixed-point type (at line 30) that defines a set of 
model numbers that are not necessarily represented in the 
parent type; by Commentary AI-00099, all model numbers of a 
derived fixed-point type must be representable values of the 
parent type. 

k. CD5007B This test wrongly expects an implicitly declared sub¬ 

program to be at the the address that is specified for an un¬ 
related subprogram (line 303) . 

l. ED7004B, ED7005C & D, ED7006C & D [5 tests] These tests check 

various aspects of the use of the three SYSTEM pragmas; the AVO 
withdraws these tests as being inappropriate for validation. 

m. CD7105A This test requires that successive calls to CALENDAR.- 

CLOCK change by at least St’STEM.TICK; however, by Commentary 

AI-00201, it is only the expected frequency of change that must 
be at least SYSTEM.TICK—particular instances of change may be 
less (line 29) . 

n. CD7203B, 4 CD7204B These tests use the 'SIZE length clause and 
attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic by 
the VG9 ARG. 

o. CD7205D This test checks an invalid test objective: it treats 

the specification of storage to be reserved for a task's 
activation as though it were like the specification of storage 
for a collection. 

p. CE2107T This test requires that objects of two similar scalar 
types be distinguished when read from a file—DATA_ERROR is 



"TTHDS.VJh TiSTS 


» expected to be raised by an atteippt to read one object as of 

the other type. However, it is not clear exactly how the Ada 
standard 14.2.4:4 is to be interpreted; thus, this test objective 
is not considered valid. (line 90) 

q. CE3111C This test requires certain beha''ior, when two files are 

associated with the same external file, that is not required by 
the Ada standard. 

r. CE3301A This test contains several calls to END_OF_LINE & 
END_OF_PAGE that have no parameter: these calls were intended 
to specify a file, not to r'efer to STA1TDARD_INPUT (lines 103, 
107, 113, 132, & 136). 

s. CE3411B This test requires that a text file's column number be 

set to COUNT'LAST in order to chec)c that LAV0UT_EPR0R is raised 
by a subsequent PUT operation. But the former operation will 
generally raise an exception due to a laclt of available disl< 

space, and the test would thus encumber validation testing.
