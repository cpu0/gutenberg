ABSTRACT 

Remote sensing technology can satisfy or make significant contributions 
toward satisfying many of the information needs of governmental natural re- 
source planners and policy makers. Recognizing this potential, the South 
Dakota State Planning Bureau and the EROS Data Center together formulated 
the framework for an ongoing Land Use and Natural Resource Inventory and 
Information System Program. Statewide land use/land cover information is 
currently being generated from LANDSAT digital data and high altitude pho- 
tography. Many applications of the system are anticipated as it evolves 
and data is added from more conventional sources. This paper primarily 
deals with the conceptualization, design, and implementation of the program. 

INTRODUCTION 

All levels of government share the need for natural resource informa- 
tion. Intelligent planning, policy formulation, and decision making often 
require a great deal of qualitative and quantitative information. Without 
a solid information base, the planning process can be reduced to guesswork, 
a regrettable situation at best. 

The cost of acquiring most types of resource data is relatively high, 
especially at finer levels of detail. Remote sensing technology, while not 
a panacea, can provide demonstrable reductions in the costs of data acqui- 
sition for some types of natural resource information.! .2' ^'"^ It must, 
however, be used in an appropriate context with realistic expectations. 

One of the principal areas where the potential application of remotely 
sensed data is being developed is in the generation of land use, or more 
precisely, land cover information. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Traditional data gathering 
methods, ranging from "windshield surveys" to low altitude photography, are 
generally too expensive and time consuming to perform more than once, if at 
all. The NASA Earth Resources Program, however, has significantly changed 
this situation. The synoptic, repetitive coverage of high resolution sen- 
sors on satellite platforms has made the collection, analysis, and dissemi- 
nation of comprehensive regional land use data practical and cost-effective 
for the first time. Recognizing this potential, the South Dakota State 
Planning Bureau and the EROS Data Center undertook a cooperative land use 
demonstration project. Together they formulated the framework for the South 
Dakota Land Use and Natural Resource Inventory and Information System. Ob- 
jectives were developed, and a three phase program- designed. 

Initially, three information sources are being tapped for this project. 
LANDSAT data, in digital and photographic formats, is being used to provide 
statewide land cover information at several levels of detail. High altitude 

1499 



photography will be used for more detailed large area analyses, and for ver- 
ification of the results produced using smaller scale imagery. Conventional 
low altitude photography will be used for detailed small area analyses in 
selected urban and critical areas. Each sensor will be used at the most ap- 
propriate and cost effective scale, so that the intrinsic advantages of each 
may be fully exploited. 

OBJECTIVES 

During the formulation of the program, an attempt was made to develop 

a realistic set of goals and objectives. The result is shown in Figure 1. 

The emphasis of the objectives was to address natural resource information 

needs with what were felt to be practical applications of remotely sensed 

data. To date, this has been borne out. 

The overall goal of the program has been to provide detailed, accurate 
land cover and natural resource information to improve and support govern- 
mental decision making, the comprehensive planning process, and state and 
local land use planning and policy formulation. Conventional data sources 
were inadequate to meet these needs. Where information existed at all, it 
was often dated, inaccurate, of insufficient detail, or a combination of the 
three. It was necessary, therefore, to develop new data sources. Remote 
sensing technology provided the only viable alternative in a sparsely set- 
tled state such as South Dakota. 

PROGRAM 

A three phase program was designed to operationalize the South Dakota 
Land Use and Natural Resource Inventory and Information System. Phase I 
has essentially been completed. Phases II and III are scheduled to run con- 
currently with fiscal years 1976 and 1977, respectively. 

Phase I 

Two major tasks were completed in Phase I. A statewide Level I -inven- 
tory was visually interpreted from LANDSAT imagery. Level II and partial 
Level III informa,tion was digitally interpreted from LANDSAT computer com- 
patible tapes for selected priority jireas. The generalized information 
flows for this phase are depicted in Figure 2. -=? 

Visual interpretation .- Visual interpretation was done on color en- 
hanced LANDSAT imagery at a scale of 1:250,000. A diazo process was used 
for the color enhancement, with MSS5 in positive red and MSS7 in negative 
blue being sandwiched to create a false color composite. These composites, 
produced from 1:1,000,000 positive transparencies, were then copied onto 
35MM slides, one per quadrant, or four per scene. The actual interpretation 
was done using a rear projection technique, (see Figure 3) The slide 
image was then projected onto special composite chronaflex .1:250,000 USGS 
base maps, with the land use data interpreted in quarter section cells 
(160 acres) and drafted onto a mylar overlay. The overlays were then 
color coded, generalized, redrafted, and mosaicked at 1:500,000 using a 
cartographic projector. This was sent to the printer for final map re- 
production at a scale of 1:1,000,000.

Digital interpretation .- Within the land use inventory program, the 
LANDSAT Imagery Analysis Package (LIMAP) was used for the analysis and 
display of LAlSfDSAT CCTs. This system was developed by the principal 
author, with the exception of the clustering and discriminant function al- 
gorithms which were adapted from LARSYS . The generalized analysis procedure 
used is shown in Figure 4. Selected priority areas were categorized on a 
pixel by pixel basis, with display scales ranging from 1:24,000 (1.1 acre 
cells) to 1:500,000 (40 acre cells). 

Analysis procedure: The first' step in the analysis procedure consists 
of joining and reformatting the raw multispectral data. This is essential- 
ly a housekeeping function, making the data easier to store, access, and use-. 
If coverage of the study area (usually a county or multicounty area) re- 
quires the use of consecutive images, the scenes are merged and the overlap 
discarded. Fortunately, all but one of South Dakota's counties are entirely 
within consecutive images. The problem of joining side-by-side images was . 
safely avoided. 

The next step consists of removing the spatial distortion present in 
the data. The distortion present can -be attributed, for the most part, to 
three factors: the motion orC the spacecraft, the rotation of the earth, 
and the angle of the satellite '"s-prbit .-'•-'• The algorithm performs a linear 
rectification on a nearest neighbor basis, with the output being properly 
north-south and east-west oriented. This reorientation would be a trivial 
matter, were it not for the large amount of information in each scene. Even 
though a simplified geometric correction procedure is used, the rectifica- 
tion of 3 million pixels takes well over an hour of computer time on a 
moderate sized- computer with limited main storage;. Once the data is recti- 
fied, greyscale line printer maps are generated for MSS5 and MSS7, usually 
at 1:24,000 (all pixels) and/or 1:48,000 (25% sample). 

The next step is the most crucial of the entire process. This is where 
the statistical definitions of the land use categories are developed. Grey- 
scale maps of the study area for MSS5 and MSS7 are examined spectrally and 
associated with ground truth information, often high altitude aerial photo- 
graphy. Small windows, called training fields, are located on the map and 
are submitted to a clustering algorithm. Through a man-machine interactive 
procedure, an optimal set of spectral classes is obtained which is repre- 
sentative of the ground cover types to be identified. Finally, the spectral 
characteristics (statistics) of the selected categories are used to classify 
all .of the data points in the study area using a Gaussian maximum likeli- 
hood classifier. 

Display options: Once the study area is categorized, two display op- 
tions are available: grey tone line printer maps, or color coded land use 
plots. Individual categories, all categories, or selected categories can 
be displayed in either mode. These displays and supporting statistics can 
be generated for the entire area, or selected portions of it, either rectan- 
gular or polygonal. The scale of line printer maps can be varied from 
approximately 1:24,000 to l.:144,000. The scale of the color plots can be 
varied from 1:24,000 to 1:500,000. The resolution for both output media can 
be varied between 1.1 and 40 acres. An aggregation algorithm creates multi- 
pixel cells as required. This program allows user specification of decision 
rules, automatic creation of combination categories when ties occur, or a 
combination of the two approaches, as requested at the time of execution. 
Examples of several types of hard copy are presented in the Initial Results 
section.

Phase II 

Figure 5 illustrates the information flows of Phase II. During this 
phase, land uses in the remainder of the state will be analysed digitally 
to Level II and partial Level III, except in large homogenous areas, such as 
arid grasslands, where computer processing is deemed superfluous. NASA high 
altitude imagery will be systematically utilized to verify digitally pro- 
duced information. Where LANDSAT digital processing is found to be inade- 
quate, one of two courses will be followed. Where the classification is 
satisfactory, with limited areas of confusion, high altitude imagery will be 
used to resolve any discrepancies present. Current budget and work program 
plans include the acquisition of hardware which will permit data refinement 
in an interactive mode. If the digital classification is unacceptable, high 
altitude imagery will be visually interpreted, classified, digitized and 
prepared for entry into the information system. 

An inventory of existing resource data will be undertaken during this 
phase. This is primarily in preparation for Phase III, when much of this 
data will be digitized and entered into the system. In addition, a land 
capability/suitability study will be done for a metropolitan area in the 
state. Appropriate natural resource data for the county will be selected 
and entered into the system. An overlay technique will be employed to re- 
veal the intrinsic suitabilities and limitations for both urban and rural 
development. Alternative land development plans, and a package of appropri- 
ate policies to guide in the implementation of the selected alternatives 
will be presented to district, county, and municipal planning agencies. 

The final major activity in this phase will be the visual interpreta- 
tion of high altitude photography. Selected urban and critical areas will 
be categorized on the basis of quarter acre cells (approximately 30 x 30 
meters). The basic interpretation technique will be the same as used on the 
LANDSAT imagery, with 1:24,000 quad maps replacing the 1:250,000 base maps. 
Upon completion of the interpretation, the land use and other resource data 
will be entered into the information system. 

^ Phase III 

During the final implementation phase, the breadth and depth of infor- 
mation available within the system will be great ly. enhanced. The anticipa- 
ted information flows are shown in Figure 6. 

Level III land use information will be completed for the entire state. 
LANDSAT digital data interpreted in earlier phases will be adequate for most 
rural- areas. Data for urban and critical areas will be interpreted from 
high altitude photography. Low altitude missions will be flown as required 
to meet special data needs. Once the land use data base is completed, a two 
to five year update cycle is projected. The actual frequency will depend on 
two factors: the amount of change since the last update, and the anticipated 
development pressure. 

Several types of natural resource data will be added during this phase. 
These include, but are not limited to, soils data, topographic data, geo- 
logic data, hydrologic data, climatic data, surface and subsurface resource 
data, air and water quality data, and ownership type data. The presence of 
this data within the information system will allow a wide variety of detail- 
ed analyses to be performed as required for state and local planning and 
policy formulation. 



1502 



The final major task performed in this phase will be the creation of 
linkages to the State Planning Bureau' s Policy Information System. .This 
system will contain comprehensive statewide social, economic, fiscal and- 
demographic data. These linkages should greatly enhance the analytical cap- 
abilities of both systems, providing a basis for social, economic, and en- 
vironmental impact assessment of alternative policy decisions. 



INITIAL RESULTS 

Central South Dakota 

Analysis of a multi-county area in central South Dakota was recently 
completed. A single scene was selected for this analysis — May 15, 1973 
(scene ID 1296-17014). All processing and display generation for this study 
area was performed by the LANDSAT Imagery Analysis Package. 

Figures 7 and 8 show grey tone 25% sample line printer maps for Cow 
Creek Township in Sully County. The rectified data for MSS5 and MSS7 are 
displayed. The raw data was sliced on the basis of a visual examination of 
one dimensional histograms, and assigned to one of the five grey levels 
present. 

Figure 9 is a single category map of bare soil in Cow Creek Township. 
For this display, the data has been aggregated into 4.4 acre cells (2x2 
pixels). The scale of the original on this map, as in the previous two, is 
approximately 1:48,000. Figure 10 is an all category all pixel land 
use plot for the same township, (original scale = 1:62,500) and Figure 11 
contains the legend for this plot. 

Figure 12 consists of an all category plot of a major portion of 
Sully County at an original scale of 1:250,000, and Figure 13 contains the 
legend for this plot. Pixels have been aggregated into 10 acre cells (3x3 
pixels) for this display. Cow Creek Township has been outlined for compari- 
tive purposes. 

Figure 14 is a listing of the land use categories which are being in- 
terpreted from LANDSAT CCTs with limited supplemental information. Higher 
resolution data sources would be required for the interpretation of more de- 
tailed information. This classification system is adapted from the Anderson 
system. 12

. Sioux Falls Analysis 

As a comparison to the work being done at the State Planning Bureau, it 
was decided to run a comparison analysis using LARSYS 3.1 on the terminal at 
the EROS Data Center. 

The area chosen for processing at EROS is located in the eastern por- 
tion of the state. Two LANDSAT-1 scenes were chosen for the analysis — Aug- 
ust 15, 1972 (scene ID 1023-16433) and May 30, 1973 (scene ID 1311-16441). 

Preprocessing . - The four bands of digital data from each scene were 
temporally overlayed, e.g., the data points were spatially registered to 
create a combined data set. The data were then geometrically corrected — 
skew removed, oriented north-south, and"scaled to 1:24,000 for line printer 
character maps. 

Ground control/ground truth .- Important for the selection of training 
and test fields and overall assessment of classification accuracy was the 
assembly of a ground control aggregate and subsequent transfer of necessary 
ground truth information to the ground control. Nine U.S. Geological Survey 
7.5 minute topographic guadrangles were trimmed and mosaicked to form a 
1:24,000 scale ground control aggregate, the same scale as line printer 
character maps generated from the LANDSAT analysis. Ground truth available 
for the analysis included high altitude, color infrared aerial photography 
flown by NASA in 1970. Certain land use information, including location of 
industrial/commercial areas, newer housing, and older housing, were extract- 
ed from the aerial photography and indicated on the quadrangle-mosaic. 

Training field selection .- Greyscale lineprinter character maps of the 
study area were generated for bands 5 and 7 for both August and May. Train- 
ing fields were located for each of the land uses to be identified. Precise 
location of the training fields was possible by overlaying the greyscale 
maps with the ground control/ground truth aggregate on a light table. Train- 
ing fields for commercial/industrial areas, newer housing, and older housing 
(divided into two distinct spectral classes because of differing tree canopy 
cover) were located on the band 5 greyscales, while the agriculture and for- 
est s'amples were selected from band 7 maps. Because the May data included 
several^ small , cumulus clouds, training fields were located for two addi- 
tional spectral classes, cloud and cloud shadow. Water bodies in the study 
area were not large enough to be spectrally identified. 

- A special problem arose in the selection of training fields to use for 
bi-temporal, agricultural land cover classification. The agricultural areas 
included a wide range of infrared reflectivity for both the August and May 
data sets. It was necessary, therefore, to create Gaussian subclasses of 
agricultural land cover types. Unfortunately, crop type information was not 
available to the analyst. Thus, the subclasses needed to be created solely 
on the basis of infrared reflectance. By careful and systematic scanning of 
both greyscale maps , agricultural field patterns were seen to be closely re- 
lated to certain levels of reflectivity. The complete range of agricultural 
reflectivity in band' 7 was ultimately divided into four levels for each date. 
The observation was made, moreover, that a given "level" (spectral class) of 
one date could be either of the other levels of the other date. For example, 
if crop type information had been available to the analyst, one of the six- 
teen possible combinations of agricultural bi-temporal land cover (16 comb- 
inations are possible, because of the 4 x 4 level matrix) might have been 
corn in August 1972, and dark bare soil in May 1973. One of the bi-temporal 
combinations, lowest reflectivity in August and highest in May, was not found 
to be a significant . class for the analysis. 

1504 



Location of training fields for the resultant fifteen agricultural clas- 
ses completed the task of choosing representative areas to "train the com- 
puter" to identify the desired land uses — commercial/industrial, older hous- 
ing (2 spectral classes)', newer housing, forested, agriculture (15 spectral 
classes), cloud, and cloud shadow. The aggregate ofr training fields totaled 
72, which included 1492 data points (1.0% of the 13.8,224 data points in the 
study area) . 

Statistics/Feature Selection .- Quantitative characterization of the land 
uses (spectral classes) was achieved by calculation of means for each class 
and covariance matrices for all pairs of classes. Using the spectral statis- 
tics, a feature selection processor was used to calculate separability coef- 
ficients for class pairs for 4-band combinations. The objective was to de- 
termine which 4-band set of pairs of spectral classes would be most 
separable (spectrally distinguishable). Selection of the "best 4" of the 
eight was largely arbitrary. Indeed, all eight channels might result in the 
most accurate maximum likelihood classification, but excessive computer time 
would have to be used. Previous studies have shown that four or five chan- 
nels give acceptable classification results; use of more channels yields 
insignificant (small) gains in classification accuracy in consideration of 
the additional computer time used. Bands 5 and 7 from each date were chosen 
by the processor as the best four wavelengths. Divergence values (separabil- 
ity coefficients) for the 231 pairs of the 22 spectral classes were all sat- 
isfactory — 213 pairs had values of 2000 (maximum separability; range is from 
to 2000); 17 pairs had values from 1900 to 1999; and one pair (agricultural 
areas with very bright infrared reflectance in August and medium dark in May 
and medium-bright red in August and medium-dark red' in xMay) had a value 
of 1750. The mean interclass divergence was 1997. 

Maximum likelihood classification .- Because the classes were spectrally 
separable, as indicated by the feature selection processor, a Gaussian maxi- 
mum likelihood classifier was used to categorize (classify) each of the data 
points in the study area into one of the twenty-two spectral classes. Class 
me'ans and covariance matrices were used to create the decision boundaries. 
A common form of output of the classification results is a lineprinter alpha- 
numeric character map, which displays the different land uses with different 
letters/symbols (Figure 15). A medium altitude aerial photograph of approx- 
imately the same area is included as Figure 16. Other possible output for- 
mats include lineprinter character maps with overprinting, color or black- 
and-white computer-driven plotter maps, color-coded photos from cathode ray 
tube (CRT) devices, and color-coded maps (film or print) from film recorders. 

Classification Verification .- Quantitative assessment of classification 
accuracy was achieved by selection of rectangular areas, termed "test 
fields," for each of the land use classes. Two townships, Sioux Falls, and 
Mapleton, were chosen for the verification. The former is primarily urban 
while the latter is mostly rural. The townships contain 40,386 LANDSAT pix- 
els, which represented 29 percent of the study area originally classified. 
Within the townships, 136 test fields were selected, containing 20,391 pixels 
or 51 percent of the two-township area. 

Four generalized land use classes — commercial/ industrial , forested, res- 
idential (3 spectral classes), and agricultural (15 spectral classes) — were 
tested for classification accuracy. Of the commercial/industrial pixels, 80 
percent were correctly classified; 81 percent of the residential pixels were 
correct; forested was 69 percent; and agriculture 85 percent. The overall 
classification accuracy of test fields was 84 percent. 

Classification results: Discussion .- Although a classification accuracy 
of 85 percent is satisfactory for regional resource inventories, it is appro- 
priate to discuss sources of classification error. One problem is largely a 

1505 



matter of definition of land uses versus spectral reflectance. New 'industri- 
al parks, for example, typically have extensive landscaping, resulting in 
large expanses of green vegetation. In such areas, the buildings and parking 
lots will be accurately classified, but the surrounding lawns and shrubbery 
are usually classified as parks or agriculture. Another problem of defini- 
tion arises in agricultural areas. A number of earth surface features-- 
country road right-of-ways, narrow shelterbelts , homesteads, stock ponds, 
weedy areas in fields, and small alluvial depressions--are usually too small 
to be spectrally identifiable at LANDSAT resolution, yet are large enough to 
influence the reflectance values of LANDSAT pixels and will often result in 
classification error. 

Another problem in LANDSAT classification is border pixels. Data points 
which are collected on boundaries between two land uses often have reflec- 
tance values characteristic of neither land use. Erroneous , classifi- 
cations sometimes result. 

Within residential areas, a particular classification problem arises in 
transitional areas between distinct regions of older housing, characterized 
by mature tree canopy, and distinct areas of newer housing, characterized by 
large lawns and brightly reflecting rooftops and streets. Between these two 
land uses there is often an area with "medium" sized trees. Such areas are 
often misclassif ied as agricultural land cover. 

Additional classification iterations .- Attempts were made to refine the 
classification results, by redefinition of the statistical characterization 
of the land use (spectral) classes. This was accomplished by altering the set 
of training fields for certain classes. 

Initially, the training fields for three of the fifteen agricultural 
classes were changed. Overall classification accuracy was increased one 
percent to 85 percent, but class accuracy for two land uses — commercial/ 
industrial and residential — decreased, from 80 to 65 percent and from 81 to 
80 percent, respectively. Agricultural areas were more accurately identified 
increasing from 85 to 86 percent, while forested accuracy remained stable 'at 
69 percent. 

Training fields were altered for industrial/commercial areas for the 
third iteration, resulting in no change in overall classification accuracy. 
Industrial'/ commercial identification was increased to 69 percent accuracy, 
while percentages for the other three land uses were unchanged. 

The results of this comparative analysis will be included in the Phase 
I report generated by the Bureau. 

CONCLUSION 

The Land Use and Natural Resource Inventory and Information System will 
substantially increase the amount and extent of resource information readily 
available to all levels of government in South Dakota. The natural resource 
management process will proceed on a stronger informational base. The speed 
with which information can be generated and the depth to which it can be 
analysed will be greatly improved. 

Such an information system has many potential applications. Some of 
those projected for this demonstration include: 

--All the county land use inventories completed so far are to be includ- 
ed as integral parts of the land use component of the respective counties' 

1506 



comprehensive plans. 

— During Phase II of the program, LANDSAT data from 1972 and 1975 is go- 
ing to be used to determine how much rangeland has been broken in an arid 
country, mainly due to the skyrocketing price of small grains. If current 
drought conditions persist, a report detailing recently plowed areas with ex- 
cessive slopes will be prepared and submitted to the Soil Conservation Ser- 
vice for further action. 

— During the latter part of Phase II of the program, when a wider range 
of data is available within the system, a land suitability study will be 
undertaken for a large, predominantly urban county. 

— During Phase III, formal linkages will be developed between the Land 
Use and Natural Resource Information System, and the state's Policy Informa- 
tion System. The latter system is composed primarily of social, economic, 
fiscal, and demographic data. These linkages should greatly enhance the an- 
alytical capabilities of both systems. 

Other applications which may be worthy of investigation include: 

— The Commission of School and Public Lands, responsible for the manage- 
ment of over one million acres of grassland, has expressed interest in range- 
land condition evaluations. 

— A Planning District Director has suggested using drainage basin data 
in conjunction with delineations of bare soil areas from early spring imagery 
to detect soil erosion areas in order to enhance lake preservation efforts. 

A generalized summary of projected applications appears in Figure 17. 

It is the authors' hope that this effort, and others like it, will lead 
to an increased recognition of the role of remotely sensed data, as well as 
other types of quantitative resource information, in federal, state, and 
local governmental planning and policy formulation. If governmental natural 
resources planning is to "proceed on a firm informational foundation, "plan- 
ners intuition" must be replaced by more quantitative data sources. The 
overriding concern of this demonstration project is to make a significant 
contribution to that end. 

ACKITOWLEDGEMENTS 

As in any interagency cooperative effort, a variety of people have made 
contributions to this project. The entire program probably would never have 
gotten off the ground were it not for the foresight and cooperation of Dan R. 
Bucks, Commissioner of the South Dakota State Planning Bureau, and Allan 
Watkins, Director of "the EROS Data Center. Significant contributions were 
also made by Gene Thorley, Chief of the Applications Assistance Branch, EDC, 
and Oscar Lund and Jeff Eidenshink of the Natural Resources Section, SPB. 
Enhanced imagery and technical visual interpretation assistance were provid- 
ed by J. Ron Eyton, Department of Geography, University of Illinois. The 
principal author wishes to thank Robert Ray and other staff members of the 
Center for Advanced Computation, University of Illinois, who provided in- 
spiration for the author's early efforts; and Carl "V. Patton, who was instru- 
mental in awakening the principal author's interest in quantitative planning 
techniques and methodologies.
