COMPUIERIZED DATA COLLECTION AND REDUCTION 
FROM AN X-RAY DIFFRACIOMEIER 


INTRODUCTION 


A scries of computer pro^^rams has been written for use with a Philips X-ray 
Diffractometer and u Hewlett Packard 9825A Desk Top Computer. These programs 
permit the coiiection and storage on disk of tl\e number of X-ray counts and the 
associated 2 theta angles across line profiles. Automatic background subtraction, 
integrated intensity, correction for the angular dependence of the lorent*, polarisation, 
and atomic scaittering factors, peak location. K alpha 2 removal, and calculation of 
I'uuricr coefficients are performed. This technical note is documentation for these 
pi\)grams aiul should provide a guide to tlieir use. The programs are written in HPL 
which is a Hewlett Packard variation of BASIC. The programs are written for a 
ctjmputor configured with a disk drive, but they can be easily modified to run from 
the cassette tape drive that is integral to the 9825A Computer. 

Copies of these programs arc available on cassette from tlie author. 


HARDWARE 


With the exception of the Angle Mode Programmer (AMP) and tlie Output Inter- 
face. tlu' Philips Electronics ciiuipment used is stmidard X-ray diffraction hardware. 

'1 he opcratioti of the AMP and Output Interface is as follows: data initiation is 

started by pushing "run" on the AMP and the diffractometer advances to the first 
angle that has been programmed into the AMP. This angle is sent to the Output 
Interface. Control is turned over to the Scaler/Timer. After a preset length of 
time the Si'aler /'rimer stops data act|uisltion . sends the number of counts that it has 
collected and the length of time that it collected data to the Output Interface, and 
sends a signal to th.e A^lP that it has completed data acquisition. The AMP causes 
the diffractometer to advance Viy the step size set on the Motor Conti’oller and com- 
pares tlie new angle of the diffractometer with the scan stop angle that has been 
prep rt> gram med into t!ie AMP. If the new angle of the diffractometer exceeds the 
scan stop angle, data acquisition is haltetl, and the measurement is completed. If 
the new angle dues not exceed the scan stop angle, the data atxiuisition cycle is 
repeated . 

During this cycle the Output Interface has received the number of counts 
collected during tlu' preset time, the length of the preset time, and the angle of the 
diffractometer. This data is alivady digitizeil going into the interface. The Output 
Interface appmpriatel y formats tlus string of data for the kind of output device that 
is used. The formatting controls sliould be .set as follows: 


M ode — repeat

Parity - - odd 

Format — normal 

Output --- TTY. 

With this formatting a typical output appearing' on ttie DEC writer is shown in 
Figure 1. Column A is the number of counts <»Hectf;<i. Column B is 100 times the 
number of seconds in which the counts were collect e • Coliunn C is 100 times the 
diffractometer 2-theta angle. Column D has no signifiiArce here. 

To interface the Hewlett Packard 9825A Computer to the Philips equipment a 
Hewlett Packard 983036A Option 001 Serial Input/Output (I/O) Interface is required. 

Pin 1 is connected to instrument ground, and pin 3 is connected to the output sign'll 
of the Philips Output Interface. Since the Philips data output is BNC and the Serial 
I/O interface is a 25 pin connector, these connectkms must be made carefully to avoid 
bending or shorting pins. Certain switches internal to the I/O interface must be set 
for proper operation. The switches must be set to: "Current Loop," 2 stop bits. 

Odd Parity, and 8 bits/character. The device select code is 11 and can be set on the 
outside of the I/O interface. 

The basic 9825A computer accepts Read Only Memory (ROM) chips that extend 
the software capabilities. The programs described in this report assume that the 
Advanced Programming, Advanced I/O, String Variable, and Disk Control ROMs are 
in place. The Hewlett Packard 988^ Flexible Disk Drive must also be connected to 
the computer. The 9825A has an integral cassette tape drive that can be used in 
place of the disk drive. During line by line documentation of the programs, some of 
the program modifications that are required to operate this cassette drive will be 
mentioned. Generally, disk operation is preferable because of more flexible addressing, 
greater capacity and speed, and a lower error rate. 


SOFTWARE 


"datrd" 

This program is stored on track 0, file 1 of the cassette and reads pairs of 
X-ray counts and the diffractometer 2 theta angle, prints out this data, and stores 
the counts and angles on disk for future use. A listing of the program is in Figure 
2. The following discussion of the program should help the user to understand how 
the program works and suggests possible modifications that may be useful for par- 
ticular applications. The numbers refer to lines in the program. 

1. The user is asked by the computer how many data points are to be collected. 
The number of points, of course, depends on how wide the line is and the 
step size between angles. 

4. D is a dummy variable and is not used except as a storage for serially 
output data. 

5. C is the vector containing the X-ray counts.

ORIGINAL PAGE IS

7. B is 100 times the number of seconds in which data is collected. If opera- 
tion with variable time increments *s desired, the counts vector can be 
normalized by dividing by B to give counts per second instead of just 
counts. 

8. A is the vector containing 100 times the 2-theta angle of the diffractometer. 

10. The correct 2- theta angle is printed. 

14. The names of the files under which the data are stored are listed. The 
first word after "files" is the name of the file under which the angles are 
stored, and the second word after "files" is the name of the file under 
which counts are stored. These names must be entered before the program 
is run and space must be reserved on the disk for them using an "open" 
command. Any previous information in these files will be lost. 


"Xfoure" 

This program reads data off the disk, performs a background subtraction, 
computes tha integrated intensity of the line, corrects the line for the angle depend- 
ence of the polarization factor and the atomic scattering factor, calcxilates the peak by 
a three point parabolic fit, subtracts the K-alpha 2 component, again calculates the 
peak, and finally calculates the Fourier coe^'ficdents normalized to the area of the peak. 

Except for the Fourier coefficients all these data are standard information that 
the X-ray diffract ionist often wants to know about a given line. The Fourier coeffi- 
cients are used to deconvolute a given profile from the line profile of a well annealed 
specimen that contains no stress and has grains large enough to cause no particle 
size line broadening [1,2]. If the asymmetric coefficients are small compared to the 
symmetric coefficients (as they usually are), the trtie line profile (that is not includ- 
ing instrumental broadening) can be calculated by dividing the observed coefficients 
by the same coefficients of a well annealed specimen. The quotients are the Fourier 
coefficients of the line due only to various X-ray active defects such as inhomogeneous 
stress, small particle size, dislocations, vacancies, and stacking faults. More details 
can be found in Warren [3]. 

"Xfoure" is located on track 0, file 0, and the listing is shown in Figure 3. 
Important lines will be commented on inaividually. 

4 & 5. The computer asks which disk files to use for the angle data and the count 
data. Tliis data must have been previously stored on the disk under the 
appropriate file name. If operation of the tape cassette is desired, lines 4 
through 9 should be replaced by commands to load tine angle data into 
vector A and the counts into vector C. File names cannot be used so the 
program changes must be made before the program is run. 

10 to 16. The data is formatted and output for the operator to verify. 

18. The computer asks the operator to examine the output data and determine 
where the line begins and ends. It assumes that the angles are entered in 
increasing 2 theta values; "L" is the lefthand value where the line begins, 
and "R" is the right hand value as though one were looking at a strip chart.

22. A linear fit is made to the background. 

23. Any negative count values resulting from statistical fluctuations in the line 
tails are set equal to zero. This is the only explicit smoothing in the pro- 
gram. A standard multipoint smooth was not used because it reduces 
angular resolution, causes periodicities that may appear in the Fourier 
coefficients, and some smoothing occurs during deconvolution in any case. 

25. If this line is removed, the background subtracted line will be printed out. 

28. The correction for the Lorentz and polarization factors starts here. The 
Lorentz factor is a geometric factor caused by the size of the diffracted 
cone of X-rays, and the polarization factor exists because electrons scatter 
X-rays preferentially in the forward direction so parts of a line profile on 
the low angle side are less than on the high angle side. 

32. This line is only correct for a copper X-ray tube and a graphite mono- 
chromator. If some other conditions are used, ".75 cos Afl]" should be 
replaced by "cos 2 2a cos AH]" where 2a is 180 degrees minus the diffraction 
angle of the monochromator. If no monochromator at all is used this line 
should be replaced by 


(1 + cos A[l] 

Mli A[I]

Q 


35. If this line is removed, the Ixjrentz- polarization factor corrected line will be 
printed out. In this program the LP correction is made before the Fourier 
coefficients are calculated. At large values of theta the main cause of 
broadening in the line of an anneated specimen is spectral breadth ot the 
X-ray source, while at small theta values the main cause of broadening is 
due to instrumental misalignments. If the broadening caused by misalign- 
ments is dominant, the LP correction should be made after the Fourier 
coefficients are calculated [4]. In any case the differences are small. 

40. The Atomic Scattering factor correction subroutine is called. 

47. Q is the corrected sum of all the counts in the line. This is the integrated 
intensity. When comparing the integrated intensities of different lines, the 
angular interval between points must be corrected for. This interval is 
pi'inted out by line 48. 

51. The numbers of three equally spaced points that span the peak are asked 
for and must be entered. 

53 to 55. The corrected number of counts that occur at these points are printed out. 
For best accuracy these points should be 85 percent of the peak above 
background (51. 

59. A parabola is fit through these three {x>ints and the peak of the parabola is 
calculated [6], Kxperience has shown that the peak position is not very 
.sensitive to which three points are chosen. Typically, the peak can be 
repeated to ±0.002 degrees if the 85 percent rule is observed. Naturally, the

statistically uncertainty of the data must be very small for such accuracy. 
This can be assured by long counting times and Is not usually a problem 
near the peak where the count rate should be high. Another source of 
statistical inaccuracy comes from using samples with tco larg^ a grain size 
to give a truly random distribution of particle orientations. Usually the 
particles should be less than 15 ym for cubic crystals and smaller for 
materials with a lower degree of symmetry [7]. 

The K-alpha 2 component of the X-ray line will now be removed. 

rl and r2 are the wavelengths in angstroms of the K-alpha 1 and K-alpha 2 
radiation. The numbers entered in the progiam are for copper radiation. 

If another tube is used the appropriate values must be entered. 

The angular separation of the components of the doublet is calculated at the 
low angle side of the line and for a weighted average of the wavelengths 
from the tube. 


Tliis angular separation is printed out. 

The data occurs in discrete step intervals which are not likely to be even 
submultiples of the angular separation so some interpolation between steps 
will be necessary. This line calculates the whole number of steps in the 
angular separation and outputs this number in line 68. 

The angular separation is calculated for each angle across the line. This 
gives slightly higher accuracy than the standard Rachinger correction 
which usually calculates the separation once for the peak and asstames that 
this separation is constant across the line [8]. To obtain three decimal 
place accuracy from data taken at intervals of 0.01 degrees, this higher 
precision method is necessary. The assumption is still being made, however, 
that the K-alpha 1 and K-alpha 2 peaks have the same shape, which is not 
strictly true. 

Here is the actual Rachinger correction to the number of counts. For inter- 
polation purposes the line is assumed to be linear between data points, and 
the K-alpha 1 line is assumed to be twice the size of the K-alpha 2 line. 

The linearity assumption is quite good for the small step sizes (0.01 degree) 
usually used. The assumption about the ratio of the peaks is also good if 
a low resolution /high reflectivity monochromating crystal such as the Philips 
graphite crystal is used. A sharper monochromating crystal may alter this 
ratio. If it is desired to use a different ratio, the factor ”0.5" which 
occurs twice in this line should be replaced by the correct ratio. 

If this line is removed, the K-alpha 1 line will be printed out. 

The K-alpha 1 peak is printed out using a three point parabolic fit. 

N is the number of Fourier coefficients that will be calculated. Here it is 
set to 12 but can be easily changed. 

The line is moved so that the peak occurs at the origin. This is not 
strictly necessary for the Fourier analysis but it simplifies writing the 
Fourier analysis subroutine.

102. The Fourier analysis subroutine requires an odd number of equally spaced 
points in the line. This line determines if there is an odd number of points in the 
line and adds a point with 0 counts on the hig^h angle of the line if needed. 


104. The vector Y now contains the count information for the K-alpha 1 line. 

106. If this line is removed the vector Y is printed out. 

114. The constant term in the Fourier analysis is printed ouc as A (0). 

115 to Formatting for the Fourier coefficients. In line 117 the coefficients are 

118. normalized by the constant term. The constant term, A (0), is the area 

under the curve which is not relevant for line broadening analysis. By 
normalizing the coefficients the shapes of lines collected at different X-ray 
beam currents and for different time intervals can be compared. The sin 
and cos coefficients are output with a prime (') to indicate this normaliza- 
tion. A' is the cosine coefficient and B' is the sine coefficient. X-ray 
lines are nearly symmetric so B' is much smaller than A’ coefficient. The 
B' coefficients are not very accurate because these coefficients are sensitive 
to changes in the peak position as small as 0.002 degree. This is not 
surprising since the line asymmetry is small to start with and any change 
in asymmetry is likely to have a large effect . 

120. The calculation of Fourier coefficients iising Simpson's rule to evaluate the 
integrals begins here. 

123. X and Y are the current value of the angle and the count. 

124. Except at the end points of the evaluation, M alternates between 2 and 4 in 
Simpson's rule. 


127. The values that go into the summation in Simpson's rule are calculated here. 


129 to 
132. 


The constant term A (0) is calculated. 


135. The atomic scattering factor correction is started here. This correction 

arises because atoms scatter X-rays most efficiently in the direction of the 
X ray lx?am. The scattering cross section varies inversely with the sine 
of the scattering angle. Since this factor is angle dependent, the shape 
of the line is changed and must be corrected for. The atomic scattering 
factor depends in a rather complicated way on the wavelength of the radia- 
tion and on the atomic number of the atom tliat is doing the scattering. 
Values of the atomic scattering factor are available and can be used for an 
alloy assuming an average atomic number for the alloy. If the components 
in the alloy are close in atomic number, tliis averaging is a good approxima- 
tion. If the components of the alloy are widely separated in the periodic 
table, the various atomic scattering factors of the individual elements must 
be averaged rather than the atomic number. This program was written for 
copper nickel alloys where the atomic number averaging is a good approxi- 
mation. If the atomic numbers of the constituents of the alloy are not close 
together, the correction to the program is not simple and it may be best to 
skip this correction. The correction is never large for narrow lines and 
usually only makes minor changes in the line shape. The correction can be 
skipped by removing line 40.

There are two other line shape corrections that are sotnetiines mentioned in the 
literature. If the path length of the X-rays in the sample depends on theta, differ- 
ential absorption of X-rays takes place as a line is scanned. For the Bragg focusing 
geometry used in a diffractometer, absorption in the specimen attenuates all lines 
uniformly so no absorption correction is needed. A'.x>ther correction is the tempera- 
ture factor which chants line shape because planes with narrower spacing (that is 
greater Bragg angles) are more affected by thermal vibrations than are widely spaced 
planes where the spacing is largie compared to the thermal vibrations. This correction 
is usually the smallest and its calculation is difficult for alloys. It has not yet been 
incorporated into this program. 


137 to These are the atomic scattering factors [9] of pure copper for one-tenth 

143. integer values of sin 9/X. 

145. The atomic scattering factor is calculated for an alloy of copper and nickel 
by averaging the atomic number of the alloy. 

149. The one-tenth integer value of sin 9/ A is calculated for the alloy. This 
value is needed because the table of atomic scattering factors in lines 137 
to 143 gives the factors for discrete values of sin 9/X. If some other 
radiation than copper is used, the factor 1.5417 should be replaced by the 
wavelength of the radiation in angstroms. 

150. This is a linear interpolation between entries in the values in the atomic 

scattering list. is the final correction factor. 

152. If this line is removed, the corrected value of the line will be printed out. 


"pkfd" 

This progfram is located on track 0, file 2 and fits a parabola to three pairs of 
angles and counts that are manually entered. The peak of the parabola is calculated 
and output as the peak value of the line. The three angles must be equally spaced. 
The program is shown in ring 4. 

8 to 13. The I^orentz Polarization Correction is made in exactly the same way that it 
is made in the program "Xfoure '. See the documentation for that program 
for details. 

14 to 35. The values for the atomic scattering factor of both copper and nickel are 
entered for discrete values of sin 0/X. 

36. The atomic scattering factor of the alloy corresponding to the nearest 
discrete value of sin 9/X is calculated. This calculation is slightly more 
accurate than the calculation made in "Xfoure" because the assumption of 
a constant value of the copper to nickel atomic absorption factor ratio is 
not made. 

37, 40. The final values of the etomic scattering factor corrections are calculated 
and 43. using linear interpolation between the discrete values calculated in line 36. 
These factors are for each of the three entered angles. 


7 


44 to 46. The values of the corrected counts arc printed out so that the operator can 
verify that they are sufficiently close to the peak that the parabola is a 
good approximation. 


”mpkf" 

This program is located on track 0, file 3 and reads pairs of anglM and oounta 
directly from the diffractometer and chooses several sets of three equally spaced 
points to calculate and output the peak from each of these three sets of values. The 
listing is shown in Figure 5. 

1 to 14. The data are read in exactly tire same way that it is read in the program 
"datrd". Angles are stored in the vector A, and counts are stored in the 
vector C. 

15. T is the loop counter which determines the number of sets of points that 
will be used to calculate parabolas. As the program is written, four seta 
will be chosen but any number less than L/2 can be chosen, where L is 
the number of data points entered. 

16. The center point of the parabola is chosen to be which is the largest 
value of the count vector. 

The remainder of the program proceeds exactly the same as *'pkfd”. 


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 


These programs greatly simplify the collection and analysis of data taken from 
the X-ray diffractometer. In addition, a versatile instrument system has been estab- 
lished that an engineer can program to his/her specific needs. 

A number of additional features can be incorporated into the present data 
analysis programs such as: 

1) An automatic decision making program that locates the start and finish of 
the peak. 

2) Calculation of the peak centroid. 

3) A peak location algorithm based on minimization of the asymmetric Fourier 
ooeffleients. 

4) A quick measure of the peak breadth such as calculation of the peak breadth, 
at half height.
