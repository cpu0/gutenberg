The impact of total liber.\lization of 

domestic air transport on the social welfare 

and on the dynamic of competition: 

comparison between united states and the 

European Union 



By Karim. Zbidi ^ 



Abstract 

Since the l^ofAprill997 date of the implementation of the third package of the 
liberalization, air transport within the european Union has become totally liber- 
alized. In the United States the deregulation of domestic air traffic was earher 
and faster since it took place in October 1978 after the adoption of the only act of 
deregulation. This paper, in its first part, deals with the hberalization of the indus- 
tr}^ of air trafl5c in the european union. After a comparison with US system based 
on market demand, fare poUcy and network restrictions, we present our descriptif 
results coming fi:om treatments on the OAG data. These results present several 
aspects such as the evolution of the competitive structure of the intra-european 
routes, the level of airport dominance and the growth of hub structure. 
The second part of the paper presents models of entry in the airline industrj^ As 
profitabiUty of route flown explains correctly decisions taken bj^ airlines to serv^e 
or not a route, the paper focuses on the specification and the estimation of the 
determinants of city pair profitabihty in the european union. Treatments done on 
the OAG data show a rapid development of leasing space agreement (partial and 
total) and code sharing practices between 1995 and 2000 in Europe that's why 
we differentiate first between the two tj'pe of competitive strategy of entr>^ (direct

entry and leasing space agreement) and second between the competitive strateg}^ 
of entry and the alliance strateg}^ of code sharing. So the estimation of model will 
be able to answer the question if the european air transport market is contestable 
and in case not to see if the decision of entry is more directed by the level of 
airport dominance (as in the domestic United States market) or essentially by the 
competitive structure of the routes. We try to explain the nature of entry(direct 
leasing or code sharing) by the different levels of these two determinants.

The deregulation of domestic air transport in the united states took part consid- 
erably in the reduction of plane tickets real fares, a fall which involved a social 
welfare profit estimated on average at 4.04 dollars of 1977 per passenger (over the 
period 1978-1983) according to S.A.Morrisson and C.Winston [13]. Fares \'ariation 
was done in such a way that tariffs suggested become more adequate with costs 
supported by the airlines to offer their service on different markets. The prolifer- 
ation of tariflfe is another consequence of the deregulation which is explained by 
the polic}'^ of price discrimination practised by companies to discriminate between 
passengers according to their willingness to pay. 

The adoption of hub and spokes networks is another principal consequence of 
the deregulation. The number of real competitors (inverse of herfindhal index) 
have been reduced on a national scale gi\dng place to a greater concentration but 
this didn't pre\^ent the intensification of competition on the route level. This new 
structure of network also led to a stronger concentration of the airports which 
became dominated b}^ one or two airlines. 

The travellers saw the qualitj^ of certain aspects of service worsening. The flights 
duration and the average load £actor increased so it becomes more difficult to find a 
place in time preferred flights. However, these losses have been widely compensated 
by the improvement of other quahtj^ aspects of service, in particular the increase 
in flights frequencies and the reduction of interconnected flights (connected flight 
between two different airline) (M.Gaudr>^ et R.Mayes[15]). 

1 The experiment of the liberalization of the air 
transport in Europe 

1.1 Comparison with domestic air transport in the United 
States 

Compared to american domestic air transport market, the intra-european market 
presents different characteristics. In the demand side, the competing potential of 
the other means of transport is more significant in Europe than in the United 
States. Indeed, although the population of Europe is more significant than that 
of the United States (380 million against 280 million in 2001), Europe presents 



Karim. Zbidi 



a smaller geographical space . This difference of surface results on an average 
distance per flight less significant into Europe than with the United states. In 
2000 the average distance traversed by the intra-european flights was estimated 
(balanced by the annual frequency of the flights) at 869 km whereas mth the 
United states it was established to 1665 km (Air Transport Association ATA). 
This relativelj^ short stage length explains the stronger competition of the other 
means of transport in Europe. Moreover, the technological projection of high-speed 
trains allows a more significant competition of railroads transport in Europe. 
The aggregate size of the european airlines is less significant than that of the 
american air companies. In 2000, the joined production of all the americ£tn airlines 
rose to 1114 billion passenger kilometers whereas the european airlines (members 
of the AEA) generated 613 bilhon passenger kilometers during the current of the 
same year. Moreover the traffic of the european companies is much more directed 
towards the international. Indeed, only 26.6% of the total passenger traffic of the 
American airlines in 2000 (measured as a passenger kilometers) (corresponds to 
8% of passengers)was international whereas more than 91.1% of the european 
airlines traffic was international (55% of passengers). This international orientation 
is partially explained by the small size of countries composing Europe, but if 
Europe is seen as a one geographical entity, the percentage of the international 
traffic (towards countr}^ except european geographical space) remains relatively 
high with 77.5% (45% of the passengers') (Source ATA and AEA). 
The charter traffic (low-cost included), much more present in Europe than in the 
United States, is an additional side of divergence. Indeed in 2000 25% (50% of the 
passengers) of the european airlines traffic was served in charter mode, a mode 
which transports a broad part of the leisure traffic at a very competing tariffs. 
This same figure does not exceed the 1.3% (0.8% passengers) for the american 
airhnes. All these characteristics of the air transport industry in Europe imply 
that the demand side benefit from liberalization will be less significant in Europe 
than from deregulation in the United States. 

In the side of pricing pohcy, the european process of liberalization, in its first 
package, offer airlines the possibility to propose reductions until 55% less expen- 
sive than the coach fare. The second package had more flexibility by authorizing 
reductions until 70% and by weakening the constraint of double approval, hence- 
forth a tariff will be implemented if the two respective governments do not notify 



Karim. Zhidi 



their refusal at the end of 30 days after the fare demand , The third package came 
into ejffect in January 1993 and introduced the complete hberalization of the tarife 
from Januarj^ 1996. Although these measurements of hberalization allowed a fare's 
drop of 20% on average, the jdeld in Europe remained relatively high. Indeed in 
2000 the jield from american airlines domestic traffic was only of 0.09$ per passen- 
ger kilometers transported (PKT) whereas the europcan airlines ones related to 
the intra-european traffic was established at 0.37$. The average distance, relatively 
more important, in the United States can explain a part of this jield's diflFerence 
but this eflFect remains partial. In fact, following the deregulation, the }ield of the 
domestic traffic in the United States drop{>ed much more quickly than the one of 
intra-european traffic following the hberalization process. 

One of the most popular explanation of the relatively high >delds in Europe is 
that the european airlines would profit from a significant market power which rise 
from the practices of collusive pricing strategy. Indeed, the system of bilateral 
agreements which existed between the states members of the european union is 
suspected of having implemented then reinforced such collusive practice between 
airlines. 

However measmrements which were made concerning market power in the industry'' 
of air transport in Europe do not plead for a cooperative pricing system. Indeed 
the estimate of the standard conjectural \*ariations model(see Good, Roller and R.c 
sickles [3]) leads to a parameter of behavior which suggests a pricing in conformity 
with coiunot model. It is true that the studies made on Europe are based on 
aggregate data and thus a heterogeneous behavior of the airlines with respect to 
different routes remains possible. 

Brander and Zhang [17] studied the question of market power in the industry of 
the american airlines and thej'^ concluded that the data are much more compatible 
with the model of coumot competition than the Bertrand one or the model of 
collusive behavior. Another branch of the literature suggests the existence of a 
significant market power in the industry of air transport in the United States. 
Hurdle [16] and ^\Tiinston and Collins[23] studied the assumption of contestability 
of air transport market in the United States. They found that the market isn't 
contestable and that on some routes, airlines are able to increase excessively their 
profit . This joins the remarks made by Borenstein [2] and Berr>^(20][21] which 
specify that the airlines axe able to increase their yields on a given route through 



Karim. Zbidi 



a strong presence on the two extreme airports and the domination of a hub. 
Neven, Roller and Zhang[5] conclude the market power in the air transport euro- 
pean market is not appreciabty more significant relative to the market of domestic 
transport in the United States. Moreover the available aggregate data suggests 
that the european airlines do not exert any collusive prsictice of pricing. Indeed 
they estimate that the profit margins observed are coherent with a non cooperative 
nash equilibrium. 

Given these results, it appears obvious that it is necessary to seek elsewhere for the 
explanations of the relative rise of the yield in Europe. There were several expla- 
nations presented in the literature. All these explanations put forward a relatively 
high unit cost in Europe. This high unit cost can be explained either by a higher 
prices of factors or productive inefficiencies. 

Neven, Roller and Zhang[5] estimated a model that endogenizes costs and the 
dynamics of competition on the market of transport in Europe. They concluded in 
addition to the fact that the prices observed are not in conformity with a colluding 
practices, that the relative rise of prices of the factors cannot explain the level of 
unit cost of the airline in Europe and that the most reasonable explanation would 
be the technical lack of efficiency. 

Indeed when the firms are technically inefficient, the weak profit margins can be 
associated high unit costs that the firms can allow themselves because of the lack 
of competing pressure. In this case the fares will be high because the costs are so 
and the margin fare-unit cost will be small. Encaoua [9] and Good[4]were leaning 
on the question of productive efficiency of the european airlines. They highlighted 
that, compared with the american airUnes, the european airlines are of 50% to 70% 
less productive. 

1.2 Descriptive results of intra-european air transport 

The liberalization process of the airline industr}^ was set up with the aim of ending 

with the situation of monopoly from which profits several airhnes, and of dropping 

fares through the intensification of the level of competition within the european 

union. 

In what will follow we will present our results from treatments on OAG data. These 

data were available for the years 1995, 1999 and 2000 i.e for the period of partial 



Karim. Zbidi 



liberalization (1995) and that of total liberalization {after 1997). These results are 
articulated around three axes: the competing structure within the intra-european 
routes, growth of hub structure and the level of domination of european airports. 
It's important to mention that all results concern onl}^ intra-european flights for 
which traffic is totally liberalized. This is done to find the mcst credible comparison 
with domestic air traffic in the united states. 

Concerning the domestic air traffic mdustr}^ in the united states, JAN K.Brueckner 
and Pablo T.Spiller [14] mentioned that after an initial decline, industry concen- 
tration has increased at the national level over the post-deregulation period. They 
also remarque that despite this rising national concentration of the industry, com- 
petition in the average cit>^-pair market has grown over the period.

Tab. 1 - The Evolution of airline's number operating within the european union 

The evolution of the number of airlines operating regular routes within european 
union gives an oveniew of hberalization incidences. Indeed, as shown in table 
1 this number rose on average by 16% between 1995 and 2000 with differences 
over quarters. This rising number of operating airlines doesn't necessarily mean a 
concentration's decline in the european union because the level of concentration 
depends on the distribution of market shares between airlines companies. 
Table2 show the level of concentration within the european union based on ASK 
(Available seat kilometers) shares. 

The level of concentration doesn't appear to be sensitive to seasonahty phenomenon, 
so the level of concentration is globail}^ the same for high and low season. The main 
information showTi in table 2 is a marked decrease in market concentration between 
1995 and 2000. Indeed, the real number of competitors increased by more than 41% 
from 18 to 26. Thus the real number of airlines increased much more rapidly than 
the number of airline operating which imphes an intensification of competition in

Tab. 2 - Level of traffic^s concentration within the European union 

the city-pair market level. 

So, the intra-european concentration decreased at the aggregate and city-pair levels 
between 1995 and 2000 allowing more route competition. 

It is interesting to see how this competition growth had affected flight distribution 
between different airports. To do this, we proceeded by classifying intra-european 
airport into four categories: large hub, medium hub, small hub and nonhub. Thus 
an individual airport falls into one of four hub classifications based on that air- 
port's percentage of total ASK at intra-european airports. Those airports treating 
1 percent or more of the total are classified as large hubs, airports treating between 
0.25 and 0.99 of the total are classified as medium hubs, airports treating between 
0.05 and 0.24 percent of the total are classified as small hubs, and those treating 
less than 0.05 percent of the total are classified as nonhubs. For example, in 2000, 
there were 29 large hubs, 41 medium hubs, 68 small hubs and 131 nonhubs.

Table ?? insists on the fact that the number of large hubs remained stable between

1995 and 2000 whereas the one of medium hubs grew from 37 to 41. This means 
that the companies were developing their traffic around the mediimi hubs probably 
because of the saturation of large hubs.

Tab. 4 - Distribution of scheduled flights per pairs of classified hubs within the 
European union (expressed as a percentage ) 

This observation is widely consolidated by results from table4 on the distribution 
of scheduled flights within the European union. Indeed, this table shows that more 
than 80% of total flights, come from or go to a large hub which emphasis the 
preponderance of hub structure networks in sending intra-european traffic demand. 
The number of scheduled flights grew^ rapidly between 1995 and 2000, more than 
50% in five years. This growth had been mainly absorbed by flows of traffic between 
large and medium hubs. Indeed the share of flights between large hubs decreased 
between 1995 and 1999 whereas the one between large and medium hubs increased

much more easily obtained and the delays are less significant.

Tab. 5 - Number of cities within the european union connected to large hubs 



Table 5 and 6 show the evolution of the number of endpoints served by large and 
medium hubs within the european union. We note that globally the number of 
city connected for large hubs doesn't grow as faster as the number of endpoints 
connected to medium hubs. This can be explained by the fact that for large hubs 
the jump in number of connected cities have been already done before 1995 whereas 
medium hubs are now in full extension.

The different type of operations are defined as follows: 

1. Leased space flight: A flight where the operating airline leases some seats/space 
to one or more other airline and all participants to such an agreement sell 
their seats/space on that flight under their own designator(s) 

2. Joint operation flight a flight on which more than one airline operates one 
or more of its legs. 

3. Code shared flight: A flight where the operating airline allows seats/space 
to be sold by one or more than one airline and all participants to such 
an agreement sell their seats/space on that flight under their own FUght 
Designator. Operating airline pays monetary compensation to other airlines. 

4. FVanchised flight: A flight where the operating airline operate only under the 
designator of an other airline and pays much more monetar}'^ compensation.
