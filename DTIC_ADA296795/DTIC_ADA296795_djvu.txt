1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conpliance of Ada inplementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes; A, 
B, c, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class to 
vdiich it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executcible. Class B and 
class L tests are expected to produce errors at conpile time and link time, 
respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result when they are 
executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, and the 
procedure CHECK_FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT also 
provides a set of identity functions used to defeat some conpiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Staiidard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of text 
files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a conpiler detects illegal language usage. Class B 
tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting conpilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the conpiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada inplementation correctly detects violation of 
the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately conpiled units. Errors are 
expected at link time, and execution is attenpted. 

In scatie tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
inplementation-specific values — for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this inplementation is provided in Appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and 
inple^ntation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this inplementation are described in section 2.3. 


1-2 



INTRODUCnCN 


For each Ada inplementation, a customized test suite is produced 1^ the AVF. 
This customization consists of making the modifications described in the 
preceding paragraph, removing withdravm tests (see section 2.1), and possibly 
removing some inapplicable tests (see section 2.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each test of the 
customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 


A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives vdiich are irrelevant 
for a given Ada implementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may be 
supported by documents issued by the ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and commonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
inplementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Commentaries are included as 
appropriate. 


2-1 





IMPLENENTATIOT DEPENDENCIES 


The following 201 tests have floating-point type declarations requiring 
more digits than SYSTEM.MAX_DIGITS: 


C24113L..Y (14 tests) 
C35706L..Y (14 tests) 
C35708L..Y (14 tests) 
C45241L..Y (14 tests) 
C45421L..Y (14 tests) 
C45524L..Z (15 tests) 
C45641L..Y (14 tests) 


C35705L..Y (14 tests) 
C35707L..Y (14 tests) 
C35802L..Z (15 tests) 
C45321L..Y (14 tests) 
C45521L..Z (15 tests) 
C45621L..Z (15 tests) 
C46012L..Z (15 tests) 


C35713B, C45423B, B86001T, and C86006H check for the predefined type 

SHORT_FliQAT; for this implementation, there is no such type. 


C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with a 
name other than FLOAT, LC»IG_FLQAT, or SHORT_FLClAT; for this 
inplementation, there is no such type. 

C45423A, C45523A, and C45622A check that the proper exception is raised 
if MACHINEjDVERFLCWS is TRUE and the results of various floating-point 
operations lie outside the range of the base type; for this 
inplementation, MACHlNEjOVERFLCWS is FALSE. 

C45531M..P and C45532M..P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations for 
types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or greater; for this 
inplementation, MAX_MANTISSA is less than 47. 

D64005G uses 17 levels of recursive procedure calls nesting; this level 
of nesting for procedure calls exceeds the capacity of the compiler. 

B86001Y uses the name of a predefined fixed-point type other than type 
DURATIC*!; for this inplementation, there is no such type. 


CA2009C and CA2009F check vdiether a generic unit can be instantiated 
before its body (and any of its subunits) is compiled; this 
inplementation creates a dependence on generic units as allowed by 
AI-00408 and Al-00506 such that the conpilation of the generic unit 
bodies makes the instantiating units obsolete. (See section 2.3.) 

CD1009C checks v^ether a length clause can specify a non-defa\alt size 
for a floating-point type; this inplementation does not support such 
sizes. 


CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use length clauses 
to specify non-default sizes for access types; this inplementation does 
not support such sizes. 

AE2101C and EE2201D..E (2 tests) use instantiations of package 
SEQUENTIAL_IO with unconstrained array types and record types with 
discrimineuits without defaults; these instantiations are rejected by 
this conpiler. 


2-2 



IMPLEMENTATiai DEPENDENCIES 


AE2101H, EE2401D, and EE2401G use instantiations of ^ckage DIRECT_IO 
with unconstrained array types and record types with discriminants 
without defaults; these instantiations are rejected by this coitpiler. 

The tests listed in the following table check that USE ERROR is raised 
if the given file operations are not supported for the gTven combination 
of mode eind access method; this inqplementation supports these 
operations.

The following 16 tests check operations on sequential, direct, and text 
files vdien multiple internal files are associated with the same external 
file and one or more are open for writing; USE_ERROR is raised when this 
association is atten^ted.

CE2203A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of an 
external sequential file is exceeded; this inplementation cannot 
restrict file capacity. 

CE2403A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of an 
external direct file is exceeded; this inplementation cannot restrict 
file capacity. 



IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


CE3304A checks that SET_LINE LENGTH and SET_EAGE_LENGTH raise USE_ERHOR 
if they specify an inappropriate value for the external file; there are 
no inappropriate values for this inplementation. 

CE3413B checks that PAGE raises LAYOl]T_ERROR \dien the value of the page 
number exceeds COUNT'LAST; for this inplementation, the value of 
COUNT'LAST is greater them 150000, making the checking of this objective 
inpractical. 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 7 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
inplementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the way 
expected by the original tests. 

B22003A B83033B B85013D 

CA2009C and CA2009F were graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as 
directed by the AVO. These tests contain instantiations of a generic unit 
prior to the conpilation of that unit's bocty; as allowed by AI-00408 and 
AI-00506, the compilation of the generic unit bodies meJces the compilation 
unit that contains the instantiations obsolete. 

BC3204C and BC3205D were graded passed by Processing Modification as directed 
by the AVO. These tests check that instantiations of generic units with 
unconstrained types as generic actual parameters are illegal if the generic 
bodies contain uses of the types that require a constraint. However, the 
generic bodies are compiled after the units that contain the instantiations, 
and this implementation creates a dependence of the instantiating imits on 
the generic units as allowed by AI-00408 and AI-00506 such that the 
compilation of the generic bodies makes the instantiating units obsolete—^no 
errors are detected. The processing of these tests was modified by 
re-compiling the obsolete mits; all intended errors were then detected by 
the compiler.

All tests were processed, except those that were withdrawn because of test 
errors (item b; see section 2.1), those that require a floating-point 
precision that exceeds the inplementation's maximum precision (item e; see 
section 2.2), and those that depend on the support of a file system — if 
none is supported (item d). All tests passed, except those that are listed 
in sections 2.1 and 2.2 (counted in items b and f, below). 


a) Total Number of i^plicable Tests 3791 

b) Total Number of Withdrawn Tests 104 

c) Processed Inapplicable Tests 74 

d) Non-Processed I/O Tests 0 

e) Non-Processed Floating-Point 

Precision Tests 201 

f) Total Number of Inapplicable Tests 275 (c+d+e) 


g) Total Number of Tests for ACVC 1.11 4170 (a+bff) 


3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were loaded directly onto the host conputer. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host conpiter, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada inplementation. 

The tests were conpiled and linked on the host computer system, as 
appropriate. The executable images were transferred to the target conputer 
system by the Ethernet, and run. The results were captured on the host 
conpater system. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the customer and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a conplete listing of 
the processing options for this inplementation. No explicit options were 
used for testing this inplementation. 


Test output, conpiler and linker listings, and job logs were captured on 
magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site by the 
validation team were also archived.

.^pendix F Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


This appendix lists inplementation-dependent characteristics 
of Green Hills Ada. Note that there are no preceding appendices. 

This l^pendix is called i^pendix F in order to conply with the 
Reference Maniial for the Ada Programming Language* (LRH) 
ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A vAiich states that this appendix be named 
^jpendix F. 

Implemented Chapter 13 features include length clauses, enxmneration 
representation clauses, record representation clauses, address clauses, 
interrupts, package system, machine code insertions, pragma 
interface, euid unchecked programming. 


F.l Pragmas 

The implemented pre-defined pragmas are; 


elaborate 

interface 

list 

pack 

page 

priority 

suppress 

inline 


See the LRM section 10.5. 
See section F.1.1. 

See the LRM ^pendix B. 

See section F.l.2. 

See the LRM ^pendix B. 

See the LRM J^pendix B. 

See section F.l.3. 

See the LRM section 6.3.2. 


The remaining pre-defined pragmas are accepted, but presently ignored;

memory_size 


Named parameter notation for pragmas is not supported. 


When illegal parameter forms are encountered at compile time, the compiler 
issues a warning message rather than an error, as required by the Ada 
language definition. Refer to the ARM Appendix B for additional 
information about the pre-defined pragmas. 

F.1.1 Pragma Interface 


The form of pragma interface in Green Hills Ada is; 

pragma interface (language, sx±)progrogram [, "link-name"] ); 

v^ere; 


C-2 



APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


language This is the interface language, one of the names assembly, 
builtin, c or internal, ^e names builtin and internal 
are reserved for use by Green Hills conpiler maintainers 
in njn-time support packages. 

subprogram This is the name of a subprogram to which the pragma 

interface applies. If link-name is omitted, then the Ada 
subprogram name is also used as the object code symbol 
name. Depending on the language specified, some 
automatic modifications may be made to the object code 
symbol name. 

link-name This is an optional string literal specifying the name 
of the non-AidUi subprogram corresponding to the Ada 
subprogram named in the second parameter. If link-name 
is omitted, then link-name defaults to the value of 
sxjbprogram translated to lowercase. Depending on the 
language specified, some automatic modifications may 
be made to the link-name to produce the actual object 
code symbol name that is generated whenever references 
are made to the corresponding Ada subprogram. 

It is appropriate to use the optional link-name parameter 
to pragma interface only vhen the interface subprogram 
has a name that does not correspond at all to its Ada 
identifier or vhen the interface subprogram name cannot 
be given using rules for constructing identifiers 
(e.g. if the name contains a character). 

The characteristics of object code symbols generated for each interface 

language are: 

assembly The object code symbol is the same as link-name. If no 
link-name string is specified, then the subprogram name 
is translated to lowercase. 

builtin The object code symbol is the same as link-name, but 

prefixed with the string, "_mss_". 

This language interface is reserved for special 
interfaces defined by Green Hills Software, Inc. The 
builtin interface is presently used to declare certain 
low-level run-time operations vhose names must not 
conflict with programmer-defined or language system 
defined names. 

c The object code symbol is the same as link-name, but with 

one underscore character () prepended. This is the 
convention used by the C compiler. If no link-name string 
is specified, then the subprogram name is translated to 
lowercase. 

internal No object code symbol is generated for an internal language 


C-3 



APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


interface; this language interface is reserved for special 
interfaces defined by Green Hills Software, Inc. The 
internal interface is presently used to declare certain 
machine-level bit operations. 

No automatic data conversions are performed on parameters of any interface 
s\abprograms. It is up to the programmer to ensure that calling conventions 
match eund that any necessary data conversions take place when calling 
interface subprograms. 

A pragma interface may appear within the same declarative part as the 
subprogr^ to vdiich the pragma interface applies, following the subprogram 
declaration, and prior to the first use of the subprogram. A pragma 
interface that applies to a subprogram declared in a package specification 
must occur within the package body in this case. A pragma interface 
declaration may appear in the private part of a package specification. 
Pragma interface for library units is not supported. 

Refer to the LRM section 13.9 for additional information about pragma 
interface. 

F.1.2 Pragma Pack 

Pragma pack is inplemented for conposite types (records and arrays). 

Pragma pack is permitted following the conpasite type declaration to 
vAiich it ajplies, provided that the pragma occurs within the same 
declarative part as the composite type declaration, before any objects 
or conponents of the conposite type are declared. 

Note that the declarative part restriction means that the type declaration 
and acconpanying pragma pack cannot be split across a package specification 
and body. 

The effect of pragma pack is to minimize storage consumption by discrete 
component types whose ranges permit packing. Use of pragma pack does not 
affect the representations of real types, pre-defined integer types, and 
access types. 


F.1.3 Pragma Suppress 

Pragma suppress is implemented as described int eh LRM section 11.7, with 
these differences: 

* Presently, division_check and overflow_check must be suppressed 
via a compiler flag, -fN; pragma suppress is ignored for these 
two numeric checks. 

* The optional "ON =>" parameter name notation for pragma suppress 

is ignored. 

* The optional second parameter to pragma suppress is ignored; the 
pragma always applies to the entire scope in \^ich it appears. 


C-4 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


F.1.4 Pragma Inline 

Pragma inline is supported for procedures and functions. 

F.2 Attributes 

All attributes described in the LRM ^^pendix A are supported. 

F.3 Standard Types 

Additional standard types are defined in Green Hills Ada: 

* byte_integer 

* short_integer 

* long_integer 

* long_float 

The standard numeric types are defined as: 

type byte_integer is range -128 .. 127; 

type short_integer is range -32768 .. 32767; 

type integer is range -2147483648 .. 2147483647;

F.5 Restrictions on Representation Clauses 


C-6 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


Green Hills Ada supports representation clauses including length clauses, 
enumeration representation clauses, record representation clauses and 
address clauses. 

F.5.1 Length Clauses 

A size specification(t'size) is rejected if fewer bits are specified 
than can accommodate the type. The minimum size of a com^site type 
may be sxjbject to application of pragma pack, it is permitted to specify 
precise sizes for msigned integer ranges, e.g. 8 for the range 0..255. 
However, because of requirements imposed by the Ada language definition, 
a full 32-bit range of unsigned values, i.e. 0..(2**32)-l, cannot be 
defined, even using a size specification. 

Ihe specification of collection size (t'storage_size) is evaluated at 
nin-time vdien the scope of the type to v^ich the length clause applies 
is entered, and is therefore subject to rejection (via storage_error) 
based on available storage at the time the allocation is made. A 
collection may include storage used for run-time administration of the 
collection, and therefore should not be expected to accommodate a 
specific nxjmber of objects. Furthermore, certain classes of objects 
such as unconstrained discriminant array components of records may be 
allocated outside a given collection, so a collection may accommodate 
more objects than might be expected. 

The specification of storage for a task activation (t^storage_size) is 
evaluated at run-time vdien a task to vdiich the length clause applies 
is activated, and is therefore subject to rejection (via storage_error) 
based on available storage at the time the allocation is made. Storage 
reserved for a task activation is separate from storage needed for any 
collections defined within a task body. 

The specification of small for a fixed point type(t'small) is subject 
only to restrictions defined in the LRM section 13.2. 

F.5.2 Enumeration Representation Clauses 

The internal code for the literal of an enumeration type named in an 
enumeration representation clause must be in the range of standard.integer. 

The value of an internal code may be obtained by applying an appropriate 
instantiation of unchecked_conversion to an integer type. 

F.5.3 Record Representation Clauses 

The storage unit offset (the at static_simple_expression part) is given 
in terms of 8-bit storage units and must be even. 

A bit position (the range part) applied to a discrete type coitponent may 
be in the range 0..31, with 0 being the least significant bit of a 
component. A range specification may not specify a size smaller than can 
accommodate the component. A range specification for a conponent not 


C-7 




APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


accominodating bit packing may have a higher upper bound as appropriate 
(e.g. 0..63 for a 64-bit float ccanponent). Refer to the internal 
data representation of a given component in determining the component 
size ai^ assigning offsets. 

The value of an alignment clause (the optional at mod part) must evaluate 
to 1,2,4, or 8 and may not be smaller than the highest alignment required 
by any conponent of the record. 

F.5.4 Address Clauses 

An address clause may be supplied for an object (vdiether constant or variable) 
or a task entry, but not for a svibprogram, package, or task unit. The 
meaning of an address clause supplied for a task entry is given in section 

F.5.5. 

An address expression for an object is a 32-bit linear segmented memory 
address of type system.address. 

F.5.5 Interrupts 

A task entry's address clause can be used to associate the entry with a UNIX 
signal. Values in the reinge 0..31 are meaningful, and represent the signals 
corresponding to those values. 

An interrupt entry may not have any parameters. 

F.5.6 Change of Representation 

There are no restrictions for changes of representation effected by means 
of type conversion. 

F.6 Implementation-Dependent Components 

No names are generated by the implementation to denote implementation- 
dependent components. 

F.7 Machine Code Insertions 

Machine code insertions, described in the LRM section 13.8, are supported in 
Green Hills Ada. Exactly one form of machine code insertion can be used in 
Green Hills Ada: 

insertion of a string into the code stream. 

There are additional restrictions on machine code insertions, as 
described in the LRM: 

A compilation unit that contains machine code insertions must 
name package machine_code in a context (with) clause. 

The body of a procedure containing machine code insertions 

cannot contain declarations other than use, cannot contain statements 

other than code statements, and cannot contain exception handlers. 


C-8 




APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


Refer to the LRM for more specific details. 

The definition of package machine_code is: 

package machine_code is 
type asm is 
record 

inst: stringd. .256); 
end record; 

end; 

The asm record is used for creating assembly instructions much the same 
as the asm function in C. 

Following is an exanple of a procedure that uses machine code insertions: 

with system; 
with machine_code; 
procedure mach is 
use machine_code; 
begin 

— This machine_code procedure adds its two arguments and 

— calls the integer i/o package put routine on the sum. 
asm'(inst => "add %iO,%il,%oO"); 

asm'(inst => "mov 0,%ol"); 
asm'(inst => "call lioPutOOS"); 
asm'(inst => "mov lT5‘,%o2"); 
end; 


F.8 Unchecked Programming 

The Green Hills Ada conpiler supports the unchecked programming generic 
library subprograms unchecked deallocation and unchecked_conversion. 

There are no restrictions on the use of unchecked_conversion. Conversions 
between objects vrtiose sizes do not conform may result in storage areas 
with undefined values. 

F.9 Input-Output Packages 

A sxmimary of the inplementation-dependent input-output characteristics is: 

* In calls to open and create, the form parameter must be the 
enpty string (the default value). 

* More than one internal file can be associated with a single 
external file for reading only. For writing, only one internal 
file may be associated with an external file; Do not use 
reset to get around this rule. 

* Tenparary sequential and direct files are given names. 

Tenpjrary files are deleted when they are closed. 


C-9 




APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


* File I/O is buffered; text files associated with terminal devices 
are line-buffered. 

* The packages sequential_io and direct_io cannot be instantiated 
with xinconstrained conposite types or record types with 
discriminants without defaults. 


F.IO Separate Compilation with Generics 

A generic non-library package body can be compiled as a st±unit in a 
separate file from its specification vdiether or not the instantiations 
precede the sul^rogram body. However, a generic non-library subprogram 
bod^ cannot be compiled as a subunit in a separate file from its 
specification v^en the instantiations precede the subprogram body. 

Also, a generic library package body cannot be compiled in a separate 
file from its specification v^en the instantiations precede the subprogram 
body. 


C-10
