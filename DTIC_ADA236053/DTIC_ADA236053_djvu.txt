CHAPTER 1 


INTRODUCTION 


The Ada implementation described above was tested according to the Ada 
Validation Procedures [Pro90] against the Ada Standard [Ada83] using the 
current Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC). This Validation Summary 
Report (VSR) gives an account o£ the testing of this Ada implementation. 

For any technical terms used in this report, the reader is referred to 
[Pro90]. A detailed description of the ACVC may be found in the current 
ACVC User's Guide [UG89].

1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: 

A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class 
to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B 
and class L tests are expected to produce errors at compile time and link 
time, respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result when they 
are executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, 
and the procedure CHECK FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT 
also provides a set of Identity functions used to defeat some compiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately compiled units. Errors 
are expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values — for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in Appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and 
implementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this implementation are described in section 2-3. 


1-2 




INTRODUCTION 


For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by the 
AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications described in 
the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see section 2.1) and, 
possibly some inapplicable tests (see section 2.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each test of 
the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are irrelevant 
for a given Ada implementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may 
be supported by documents issued by ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and commonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Approved Ada Commentaries are included 
as appropriate. 


2-1 




IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


The following 201 tests have floating-point type declarations 
requiring more digits than SYSTEM.MAX_DIGITS: 


C24113L..Y (14 tests) 
C35706L..Y (14 tests) 
C35708L..Y (14 tests) 
C45241L..Y (14 tests) 
C45421L..Y (14 tests) 
C45524L..Z (15 tests) 
C45641L..Y (14 tests) 


C35705L..Y (14 tests) 
C35707L..Y (14 tests) 
C35802L..Z (15 tests) 
C45321L..Y (14 tests) 
C45521L..Z (15 tests) 
C45621L..Z (15 tests) 
C46012L..Z (15 tests) 


C35702A, C35713B, C45423B, B86001T, and C86006H check for the 
predefined type SH0RT_FL0AT. 

C35702B, C35713C, B86001U, and C86006G check for the predefined 
type LONG_FLOAT. 

C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type 
with a name other than FLOAT, L0NG_FL0AT, or SH0RT_FL0AT. 

A35801E checks that FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST may be used as a range 
constraint in a floating-point type declaration; for this 
implementation that range exceeds the safe numbers and must be 
rejected. (See section 2.3) 

C45423A, C45523A, and C45622A check that the proper exception is 
raised when operations results lie outside of the range of the 
base type if MACHINE_0VERFL0WS is TRUE for various floating-point 
types; for this implementation, MACHINE_0VERFL0WS is FALSE. 

C45531M..P (4 tests) and C45532M..P (4 tests) check fixed-point 
operations for types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or 
greater. 

C86001F recompiles package SYSTEM, making package TEXTIO, and 
hence package REPORT, obsolete. For this implementation, the 
package TEXT_I0 is dependent upon package SYSTEM. 

B86001Y checks for a predefined fixed-point type other than 
DURATION. 


CA2009C, CA2009F, BC3204C and BC3205D instantiate generic units 
before their bodies are compiled. This implementation creates a 
dependence on generic units as alleged by AI-00408 and AI-00530 
such that the compilation of the generic unit bodies makes the 
instantiating units obsolete, (see section 2.3) 

LA3004A..B (2 tests), EA3004C..D (2 tests), and CA3004E..F (2 
tests) check for pragma INLINE for procedures and functions. 

CD1009C uses a representation clause specifying a non-default size 
for a floating-point type. 


2-2 




IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use 
representation clauses specifying non-default sizes for access 
types. 

AE2101C and EE2201D..E (2 tests) use instantiations of package 
SEQUENTIALIO with unconstrained array types and record types with 
discriminants without defaults. These instantiations are rejected 
by this compiler. 

AE2101H, EE2401D, and EE2401G use instantiations of package 
DIRECT_IO with unconstrained array types and record types with 
discriminants without defaults. These instantiations are rejected 
by this compiler. 

The tests listed in the following table are not applicable because 
the given file operations are supported for the given combination 
of mode and file access method.

CE2107B..E (4 tests), CE2107L, CE2110B, and CE2111D attempt to

one or more files is writing for sequential files. 

CE2107G..H (2 tests), CE2110D. and CE2111H attempt to associate 
multiple internal files with the same external file when one or 
more files is writing for direct files. The proper exception is 
raised when multiple access is attempted. 


2-3 







IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


CE2203A checks that VRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of the 
external file is exceeded for SEQUENTIAL_IO. This implementation 
does not restrict file capacity. 

CE2403A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of the 
external file is exceeded for DIRECT_IO. This implementation does 
not restrict file capacity. 

CE3111B, CE3111D..E (2 tests), CE3114B, and CE3115A attempt to 
associate multiple internal files with the same external file when 
one or more files is writing for text files. The proper exception 
is raised when multiple access is attempted. 

CE3304A checks that USE_ERR0R is raised if a call to 
SET_LINE_LENGTH or SET_PAGE_LENGTH specifies a value that is 
inappropriate for the external file. This implementation does not 
have inappropriate values for either line length or page length. 

CE3413B checks that PAGE raises LAYOUT ERROR when the value of the 
page number exceeds COUNT'LAST. For tEis implementation, the 
value of COUNT'LAST is greater than 150000 making the checking of 
this objective impractical. 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 9 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
implementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the 
way expected by the original tests. 

B22003A B83033B B85013D 


A35801E was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by 
the AVO; the compiler rejects the use of the range FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST 
as the range constraint of a floating-point type declaration because the 
bounds lie outside of the range of safe numbers (cf. ARM 3.5.7 (12)). 

CA2009C, CA2009F, BC3204C, and BC3205D were graded inapplicable by 
Evaluation Modification as directed by the AVO. Because this 
implementation makes the units with instantiations obsolete (see section 
2.2), the Class C tests were rejected at link time and the Class B tests 
were compiled without error. 

EA1003B was processed with the option "-fl" so that code would be 
generated for all of the legal units of this test file. Without this 
option, the entire compilation would have been rejected due to errors 
within only some of the units (which is also an acceptable result).

Total Number of Inapplicable Tests 289 


Total Number of Tests for ACVC 1.11 4170 


All I/O tests of the test suite were processed because this implementation 
supports a file system. The above number of floating-point tests were not 
processed because they used floating-point precision exceeding that 
supported by the implementation. When this compiler was tested, the tests 
listed in section 2.1 had been withdrawn because of test errors. 


3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

Version 1.11 of the ACVC comprises 4170 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, the tests listed in section 2.1 had been withdrawn because of test 
errors. The AVF determined that 289 tests were inapplicable to this 
implementation. All inapplicable tests were processed during validation 
testing except for 201 executable tests that use floating-point precision 
exceeding that supported by the implementation. In addition, the modified 
tests mentioned in section 2.3 were also processed. 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape was loaded directly onto the host computer. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host computer, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the customer and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a complete listing of 
the processing options for this implementation. It also indicates the 
default options. The options invoked explicitly for validation testing 
during this test were:

MACRO PARAMETERS 


This appendix contains the macro parameters used for customizing the ACVC. 
The meaning and purpose of these parameters are explained in [UG89]. The 
parameter values are presented in two tables. The first table lists the 
values that are defined in terms of the maximum input-line length, which is 
the value for $MAX_IN_LEN—also listed here. These values are expressed 
here as Ada string aggregates, where "V" represents the maximum input-line 
length.

APPENDIX B 

COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


The compiler options of this Ada implementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to compiler documentation and 
not to this report. 


MERIDIAN ADA COMPILER OPTIONS 


-fD Generate debugging output. The -fD option causes the 
compiler to generate the appropriate code and data for 
operation with the Meridian Ada Debugger. 

-fe Annotate assembly language listing. The -fe option 
causes the compiler to annotate an assembly language 
output file. The output is supplemented by comments 
containing the Ada source statements corresponding to the 
assembly language code sections written by the code 
generator. To use this option, the -S option must also 
be specified, otherwise the annotated file is not emitted. 

-fE Generate error log file. The -fE option causes the 

compiler to generate a log file containing all the error 
messages and warning messages produced during compilation. 
The error log file has the same name as the source file, 
with the extension .err. For example, the error log file 
for simple.ada is simple.err. The error log file is 
placed in the current working directory. In the absence 
of the -fE option, the error log information is sent to 
the standard output stream. 

-fl Ignore compilation errors and continue generating code 
for legal units within the same compilation file. 

-fL Generate exception location information. The -fL option 
causes location information (source file names and line 
numbers) to be maintained for internal checks. This 


B-l 






COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


information is useful for debugging in the event that an 
"Exception never handled" message appears when an 
exception propagates out of the main program. This flag 
causes the code to be somewhat larger. If -fL is not 
used, exceptions that propagate out of the main program 
will behave in the same way, but no location information 
will be printed with the "Exception never handled” 
message. 

-fN Suppress numeric checking. The -fN flag suppresses two 
kinds of numeric checks for the entire compilation: 
division check and overflow check. These checks are 
describe? in section 11.7 o? the LRM. This flag reduces 
the size of the code. 

-fQ Suppress "added to library" and "Generating code for" 
information messages normally output by the compiler. 

-fs Suppress all checks. The -fs flag suppresses all 

automatic checking, including numeric checking. This 
flag is equivalent to using pragma suppress on all checks. 
This flag reduces the size of the code, and is good for 
producing "production quality" code or for benchmarking 
the compiler. Note that there is a related ada option, 

-fN to suppress only certain kinds of numeric checks. 

-fU Inhibit library update. The -fU option inhibits library 
updates. This is of use in conjunction with the -S 
option. Certain restrictions apply to use of this option. 

-fv Compile verbosely. The compiler prints the name of each 
subprogram, package, or generic as it is compiled. 
Information about the symbol table space remaining 
following compilation of the named entity is also printed 
in the form "[nKJ". 

-fw Suppress warning messages. With this option, the 

compiler does not print warning messages about ignored 
pragmas, exceptions that are certain to be raised at 
run-time, or other potential problems that the compiler 
is otherwise forbidden to deem as errors by the LRM. 

-g The -g option instructs the compiler to run an additional 

optimization pass. The optimizer removes common 
sub-expressions, dead code and unnecessary jumps. It 
also does loop optimizations. 

-K Keep internal form file. This option is used in 

conjunction with the Optimizer. Without this option, the 
compiler deletes internal form files following code 
generation. 


B-2 









COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-lmodifiers 

Generate listing file. The -1 option causes the compiler 
to create a listing. Optional modifiers can be given to 
affect the listing format. You can use none or any 
combination of the following modifiers: 

c Use continuous listing format. The listing by 

default contains a header on each page. Specifying 
-lc suppresses both pagination and header output, 
producing a continuous listing. 

p Obey pragma page directives. Specifying -lp is only 
meaningful if -lc has also been given. Normally -lc 
suppresses all pagination, whereas -lcp suppresses 
all pagination except where explicitly called for 
within the source file with a pragma page directive. 

s Use standard output. The listing by default is 
written to a file with the same name as the source 
file and the extension .1st, as in simple.1st from 
simple.ada. Specifying -Is causes the listing file 
to be written to the standard output stream instead. 

t Generate relevant text output only. The listing by 
default contains the entire source program as well 
as interspersed error messages and warning messages. 
Specifying -It causes the compiler to list only the 
source lines to which error messages or warning 
messages apply, followed by the messages themselves. 

The default listing file generated has the same name as 
the source file, with the extension .1st. For example, 
the default listing file produced for simple.ada has the 
name simple.1st. The listing file is placed in the 
current working directory. Note: -1 also causes an 
error log file to be produced, as with the -fE option. 

-L library-name 

Default: ada.lib 

Use alternate library. The -L option specifies an 
alternative name for the program library. 

-N No compile. This option causes the ada command to do a 

"dry run" of the compilation process. The command 
invoked for each processing step is printed. This is 
similar to the -P option, but no actual processing is 
performed. 


B-3 



COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-P Print compile. This option causes the ada command to 

print out the command invoked for each processing step 
as it is performed. 

-S Produce assembly code. This option causes the code 

generator to produce an assembly language source file 
and to halt further processing. 


LINKER OPTIONS 

The linker options of this Ada implementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to linker documentation and not 
to this report. 


MERIDIAN ADA LINKER OPTIONS 


-A Aggressively inline. This option instructs the optimizer 

to aggressively inline subprograms when used in addition 
to the -G option. Typically, this means that subprograms 
that are only called once are inlined. If only the -G 
option is used, only subprograms for which pragma inline 
has been specified are inlined. 

-c compiler-program-name 

Default: (as stored in program library) 

Use alternate compiler. The -c option specifies the 
complete (non relative) directory path to the Meridian 
Ada compiler. This option overrides the compiler 
program name stored in the program library. The -c 
option is intended for use in cross-compiler 
configurations, although under such circumstances, an 
appropriate library configuration is normally used 
instead. 

-f Suppress main program generation step. The -f option 

suppresses the creation and additional code generation 
steps for the temporary main program file. The -f option 
can be used when a simple change has been made to the 
body of a compilation unit. If unit elaboration order 
is changed, if the specification of a unit is changed, 
or if new units are added, then this option should not be 
used. 

-F Use library routines with on line (MC68881) code. If 


B-4 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


you use this option, the MC68881 or MC68882 co-processor 
must reside on the machine no which you run the program. 

g Perform global optimization only. The -g option causes 

bamp to invoke the global optimizer on your program. 
Compilation units to be optimized globally must have been 
compiled with the ada -K option. 

G Perform global and local optimization. The -G option 

causes bamp to perform both global and local optimization 
on your program. This includes performing pragma inline. 
As with the -g option, compilation units to be optimized 
must have been compiled with the ada -K option. 

I Link the program with a version of the tasking run-time 

which supports pre-emptive task scheduling. This option 
produces code which handles interrupts more quickly, but 
has a slight negative impact on performance in general. 

L library-name 

Default: ada.lib 

Use alternate library. The -L option specifies the name 
of the program library to be consulted by the bamp 
program. This option overrides the default library name. 

n No link. The -n option suppresses actual object file 

linkage, but creates and performs code generation on the 
main program file. 

N No operations. The -N option causes the bamp command to 

do a "dry run"; it prints out the actions it takes to 
generate the executable program, but does not actually 
perform those actions. The same kind of information is 
printed by the -P option. 

o output-file-name 

Default: file 

Use alternate executable file output name. The -o option 
specifies the name of the executable program file written 
by the bamp command. This option overrides the default 
output file name. 

P Print operations. The -P option causes the bamp command 

to print out the actions it takes to generate the 
executable program as the actions are performed. 

S Use switchable library routines. Use this option if you 

don't know if you have a co-processor or a co-processor 



COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


is not needed. 

-v Link verbosely. The -v option causes the bamp command to 

print out information about what actions it takes in 
building the main program. 

-W Suppress warnings. This option allows you to suppress 

warnings from the optimizer.

APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


The only allowed implementation dependencies correspond to 
implementation-dependent pragmas, to certain machine-dependent conventions 
as mentioned in Chapter 13 of the Ada Standard, and to certain allowed 
restrictions on representation clauses. The implementation-dependent 
characteristics of this Ada implementation, as described in this Appendix, 
are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted otherwise, 
references in this Appendix are to compiler documentation and not to this 
report. Implementation-specific portions of the package STANDARD, which 
are not a part of Appendix F, are:

Appendix F Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


This appendix lists implementation-dependent characteristics of Meridian Ada. Note that there are no pre¬ 
ceding appendices. This appendix is called Appendix F in order to comply with the Reference Manual for 
the Ada Programming Language* (LRM) ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A which states that this appendix be named 
Appendix F. 

Implemented Chapter 13 features include length clauses, enumeration representation clauses, record repre¬ 
sentation clauses, address clauses, interrupts, package system, machine code insertions, pragma inter¬ 
face, and unchecked programming. 

F.l Pragmas 

The implemented pre-defined pragmas are: 

elaborate See the LRM section 10.S. 
interface See section F.l. 1. 
list See the LRM Appendix B. 

pack See section F. 1.2. 

page See the LRM Appendix B. 

priority See the LRM Appendix B. 
suppres s See section F. 1.3. 

inline See the LRM section 6.3.2. This pragma is not actually effective unless you compile/link 
your program using the global optimizer. 

The remaining pre-defined pragmas are accepted, but presently ignored: 

controlled optimize systean_name 

shared storage_unit 

memory_size 

Named parameter notation for pragmas is not supported. 

When illegal parameter forms are encountered at compile time, the compiler issues a warning message rather 
than an error, as required by the Ada language definition. Refer to the LRM Appendix B for additional infor¬ 
mation about the pre-defined pragmas. 

F.1.1 Pragma Interface 

The form of pragma interface in Meridian Ada is: 

pragma interface ( language, subprogram [, " link-name"] ); 
where: 

language is the interface language, one of the names assembly, builtin, c, or internal. The names 
builtin and internal are reserved for use by Meridian compiler maintained in run-time sup¬ 
port packages. 

subprogram is the name of a subprogram to which the pragma interface applies. 

link-name is an optional string literal speci fying the name of the non-Ada subprogram corresponding to 

the Ada subprogram named in the second parameter. If link-name is omitted, then link- 

*A11 future references to the Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language appear as the LRM.

Meridian Ada Compiler User’s Guide 







Appendix F 


name defaults to the value of subprogram translated to lowercase. Depending on the lan¬ 
guage specified, some automatic modifications may be made to the link-name to produce the 
actual object code symbol name that is generated whenever references are made to the corre¬ 
sponding Ada subprogram. 

It is appropriate to use the optional link-name parameter to pragma interface only when 
the interface subprogram has a name that does not correspond at all to its Ada identifier or 
when the interface subprogram name cannot be given using rules for constructing Ada identi¬ 
fiers (e.g. if the name contains a ‘S’ character). 

The characteristics of object code symbols generated for each interface language are: 
assembly The object code symbol is the same as link-name. 

builtin The object code symbol is the same as link-name, but prefixed with two underscore charac¬ 
ters (“_,”). This language interface is reserved for special interfaces defined by Meridian 

Software Systems, Inc. The builtin interface is presently used to declare certain low-level 
run-time operations whose names must not conflict with programmer-defined or language 
system defined names. 

c The object code symbol is the same as link-name, but with one underscore character (*_’) 

prepended. This is the convention used by the C compiler. 

internal No object code symbol is generated for an internal language interface; this language inter¬ 
face is reserved for special interfaces defined by Meridian Software Systems, Inc. The inter¬ 
nal interface is presently used to declare certain machine-level bit operations. 

No automatic data conversions are performed on parameters of any interface subprograms. It is up to the pro¬ 
grammer to ensure that calling conventions match and that any necessary data conversions take place when 
calling interface subprograms. 

A pragma interf ace may appear within the same declarative part as the subprogram to which the pragma 
interface applies, following the subprogram declaration, and prior to the first use of the subprogram. A 
pragma interface that applies to a subprogram declared in a package specification must occur within the 
same package specification as the subprogram declaration; the pragma interface may not appear in the 
package body in this case. A pragma interface declaration for either a private or nonprivate subprogram 
declaration may appear in the private part of a package specification. 

Pragma interface for library units is not supported. 

Refer to the LRM section 13.9 for additional information about pragma interface. 

F.1.2 Pragma Pack 

Pragma pack is implemented for composite types (records and arrays). 

Pragma pack is permitted following the composite type declaration to which it applies, provided that the 
pragma occurs within the same declarative part as the composite type declaration, before any objects or com¬ 
ponents of the composite type are declared. 

Note that the declarative part restriction means that the type declaration and accompanying pragma pack 
cannot be split across a package specification and body. 

The effect of pragma pack is to minimize storage consumption by discrete component types whose ranges 
permit packing. Use of pragma pack does not defeat allocations of alignment storage gaps for some record 
types. Pragma pack does not affect the representations of real types, pre-defmed integer types, and access 
types. 

F.1.3 Pragma Suppress 

Pragma suppress is implemented as described in the LRM section 11.7, with these differences:

F.5 Restrictions on Representation Clauses 
F.5.1 Length Clauses 

A size specification (t ' size) is rejected if fewer bits are specified than can accommodate the type. The 
minimum size of a composite type may be subject to application of pragma pack. It is permitted to specify 
precise sizes for unsigned integer ranges, e.g. 8 for the range 0.. 255. However, because of requirements 
imposed by the Ada language definition, a full 32-bit range of unsigned values, i.e. 0.. (2**32) -1, cannot 
be defined, even using a size specification. 

The specification of collection size (t ' st orage_s ize) is evaluated at run-time when the scope of the type 
to which the length clause applies is entered, and is therefore subject to rejection (via storage_error) 
based on available storage at the time the allocation is made. A collection may include storage used for run¬ 
time administration of the collection, and therefore should not be expected to accommodate a specific number 
of objects. Furthermore, certain classes of objects such as unconstrained discriminant array components of 
records may be.allocated outside a given collection, so a collection may accommodate more objects than 
might be expected. 

The specification of storage for a task activation (t ' storage_aize) is evaluated at run-time when 
a task to which the length clause applies is activated, and is therefore subject to rejection (via st or age_er- 
ror) based on available storage at the time the allocation is made. Storage reserved for a task activation is 
separate from storage needed for any collections defined within a task body. 

The specification of small for a fixed point type (t' small) is subject only to restrictions defined in the LRM 
section 13.2. 

F.5.2 Enumeration Representation Clauses 

The internal code for the literal of an enumeration type named in an enumeration representation clause must 
be in the range of standard. Integer. 

The value of an internal code may be obtained by applying an appropriate instantiation of un- 
checked_conversion to an integer type. 

F.5.3 Record Representation Clauses 

The storage unit offset (the at static_simple_expression part) is given in terms of 8-bit storage units and must 
be even. 

A bit position (the range part) applied to a discrete type component may be in the range 0. .15, with 0 being 
the least significant bit of a component. A range speci fication may not specify a size smaller than can accom¬ 
modate the component A range specification for a component not accommodating bit packing may have 
a higher upper bound as appropriate (e.g. 0. .31 for a discriminant string component). Refer to the inter¬ 
nal data representation of a given component in determining the component size and assigning offsets. 

Components of discrete types for which bit positions are specified may not straddle 16-bit word boundaries. 

The value of an alignment clause (the optional at mod part) must evaluate to 1,2,4, or 8, and may not be 
smaller than the highest alignment required by any component of the record. 

F.5.4 Address Clauses 

An address clause may be supplied for an object (whether constant or variable) or a task entry, but not for a 
subprogram, package, or task unit. The meaning of an address clause supplied for a task entry is given in sec¬ 
tion F.5 J.

Appendix F 


An address expression for an object is a 32-bit segmented memory address of type system, address. 

F.5.5 Interrupts 

A task entry’s address clause can be used to associate the entry with a UNIX signal. Values in the range 0.. 31 
are meaningful, and represent the signals corresponding to those values. 

An interrupt entry may not have any parameters. 

F.5.6 Change of Representation 

There are no restrictions for changes of representation effected by means of type conversion. 

F.6 Implementation-Dependent Components 

No names are generated by the implementation to denote implementation-dependent components. 

F.7 Unchecked Conversions 

There are no restrictions on the use of unchecked_conversion. Conversions between objects whose 
sizes do not conform may result in storage areas with undefined values. 

F.8 Input-Output Packages 

A summary of the implementation-dependent input-output characteristics is: 

• In calls to open and create, the/orm parameter must be the empty string (the de¬ 
fault value). 

• More than one internal file can be associated with a single external file for reading 
only. For writing, only one internal file may be associated with an external file; Do 
not use reset to get around this rule. 

• Temporary sequential and direct files are given names. Temporary files are deleted 
when they are closed. 

• File I/O is buffered; text files associated with terminal devices are line-buffered. 

• The packages sequential_io and direct_io cannot be instantiated with un¬ 
constrained composite types or record types with discriminants without defaults. 

F.9 Source Line and Identifier Lengths 

Source lines and identifiers in Ada source programs are presently limited to 200 characters in length.
