Introducing ATARI Logo, 
a complete computer 
curriculum that offers 
you an exciting new way 
to teach—at a great low 
price. 


Reinforce Learning Skills 
Through Discovery 

With ATARI Logo, students quickly 
evolve from passive to active learn¬ 
ers as they set up problems to solve, 
experiment with different solutions, 
and try to make appropriate choices. 
As a teacher, you’ll have more free¬ 
dom to help expand students’ ideas 
and to develop a deeper under¬ 
standing of the learning process. 
ATARI Logo reinforces the learning 
skills you work so hard to teach. 

Effective Teaching 
ThafsEasy to Use 

ATARI Logo is the computer lan¬ 
guage that speaks your language. It 
lets you “talk” with a computer as 
you would to a friend. In the very 
first session, students can start cre¬ 
ating graphics and designs, editing 
text, and getting comfortable with 
mathematical and logical thinking. 
You and your students progress to 
more advanced levels at your own 
pace. 


Shrinking Computer 
Costs For Shrinking 
School Budgets 

In addition to being a versatile and 
easy-to-use teaching tool, ATARI 
Logo is an excellent value. All you 
need to use it is an ATARI Computer 
with as little as 16K RAM memory 
and a TV set or monitor. A full com¬ 
plement of ATARI printers and pro¬ 
gram recorders is available if you 
want to print or save your students’ 
work. 

The Roots of a Language 

The Logo language is the result of 
over 10 years of research led by 
M.I.T. professor Seymour Papert. 
Papert and other educators have 
written many studies, books, and 
guides to support your classwork. 
ATARI Logo is a special version 
developed by Logo Computer Sys¬ 
tems, Inc., of Montreal.

Experience the Power 
of ATARI Logo 

The power of ATARI Logo lies in its 
ability to demonstrate profound 
concepts in a few simple proce¬ 
dures. It is a dynamic, versatile tool 
for controlling and changing words, 
sentences, and shapes on the TV 
screen. By using ATARI Logo, stu¬ 
dents learn about geometry, math, 
scientific method, language, and 
learning itself. 

How ATARI Logo Works 

Programming is simply telling the 
computer 
what you want 
it to do, using 
words it under¬ 
stands. With 
ATARI Logo, 
those words 
are the same 
you use everyday in the classroom. 
Logo programs consist of indepen¬ 
dent parts (procedures) which link 
together. Your students can solve 
large, complex problems by creat¬ 
ing procedures to deal with individ¬ 
ual parts of the whole. Pupils tailor 
ATARI Logo to suit their needs, be¬ 
cause each procedure they write 
becomes part of the language. They 
can even use the procedures they’ve 
already created to build other pro¬ 
cedures. Like explorers in a new 
world, students begin anew to name 
and organize experience on their 
own—the essence of learning. 



Let a “TUrtle” Be Your 
Guide 

ATARI Logo visual designs are cre¬ 
ated by manipulating one or more 
“turtles” which draw paths as they 
move across the TV screen. While 
creating geometric figures in this 
way, the student learns how to think 
logically and develop problem¬ 
solving strategies. And ATARI Logo 
is enhanced by the already impres¬ 
sive graphics and color capabilities 
of ATARI Computers. 

The ATARI Logo Package 

What you get: a durable, easy-to-use 
program cartridge; reference card; 
with start-up instructions and ATARI 
Logo vocabulary; highly readable 
boCks, including Introduction 
to Programming Through Turtle 
Graphics and ATARI Logo Reference 
Manual.

teaching tool you need in your class¬ 
room, talk to your school’s computer 
specialist. If you would like more
