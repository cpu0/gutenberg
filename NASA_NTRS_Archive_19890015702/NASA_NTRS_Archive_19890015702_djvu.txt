ABSTRACT 


A new method is presented for handling data resulting from Mobile 
Satellite propagation experiments such as the Pilot Field 
Experiment (PiFEx) conducted by JPL. This method uses the UNIX 
operating system and C programming language. The data management 
system is implemented on a VAX minicomputer. The system 
automatically divides the large data file housing data from 
various experiments under a predetermined format into various 
individual files containing data from each experiment. The 
system also has a number of programs written in C and FORTRAN 
languages to allow the researcher to obtain meaningful quantities 
from the data at hand.

SECTION 1 


INTRODUCTION 


The Pilot Field Experiment (PiFEx) was an attempt to mimic the 
proposed Mobile Satellite (MSAT) scenario. Conducted at the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 1000-foot 
tower located at Denver, Colorado, PiFEx consisted of a fixed 
transmitting station that transmitted a known data pattern under 
the 8-phase modulation scheme. The transmitted signal was 
received by a transponder located at the top of the NOAA tower 
and, after frequency translation, was retransmitted to a receiver 
located in a van. The van containing the receiver was driven 
around the tower in a predetermined fashion so as to simulate the 
mobile receiver in the MSAT project. While being driven around 
the tower, the van received the signal, appropriately processed 
it, and finally stored it in a mass storage device for post- 
experiment processing. 

The major aims in the PiFEx propagation experiment were to define 
the mobile communications channels and to test the workability of 
a number of new concepts used to design various components of the 
receiver system. These components included subsystems like the 
JPL-designed and -developed mechanically steered antenna for 
tracking and locking onto the incoming information-bearing 
signal, and the data acquisition and collection subsystem. The 
result of such an experiment is usually large amounts of data 
stored in either magnetic tapes or microcomputer floppy 
diskettes. In general, because there are such large amounts of 


1 


data, they usually reside on a minicomputer rather than a 
microcomputer . 

One of the researcher's main tasks thus becomes accessing the 

data according to his needs but with a minimum of effort. Even 

though most minicomputer and mainframe computer systems have 

their own data base management systems, most of these systems 

have been created for commercial (e.g., banking) data and either 

are unsuitable for scientific computational efforts or entail a 

substantial investment that may not be justifiable. In general, 

tailoring such a commercial data -handling system to handle 

* 

scientific data such as the data from the PiFEx propagation 
experiment would require many hours of effort and result only in 
extremely inefficient use of the data base management system's 
capabilities. 

The PiFEx data are currently stored on a VAX 780 minicomputer 
running on the UNIX operating system. The system also has C and 
FORTRAN compilers. What follows in this report is a method to 
provide a system to manage the PiFEx data on the VAX in an 
interactive way. The system provides not only the file handling 
necessary to retrieve the desired data, but also several FORTRAN 
programs to generate some standard results pertaining to 
propagation data.

SECTION 2 


DATA FORMAT 

As was described before, the PiFEx experiment used a fixed 
transmitter to transmit a known data pattern to the transponder 
located at the top of the NOAA tower. The receiver was housed in 
a mobile van which was driven around the tower in a predetermined 
fashion to generate the data the researchers needed. The received 
signal was appropriately sampled and stored into a mass storage 
device by the data collection system. PiFEx hosted quite a few 
experiments, but the data can be categorized into four distinct 
classes of data: 

1) Antenna pointing experiment data: The purpose of this 
experiment was to quantify effects of electronic warmup, 
ambient temperature change, vehicle turn 
rate/acceleration, vehicle vibrations, and details of 
the tracking algorithm on the pointing performance of 
the antenna. 

2) Radio experiment data: This experiment was useful in 
measuring the radio's performance in tracking the 
received pilot signal with or without Doppler. It was 
also used to measure the radio's performance in 
acquiring the signal with or without Doppler, and in 
conjunction with the antenna pointing system acquisition 
mode or tracking mode.

3) 


Modem experiment data: This experiment helped to 

determine the bit and packet error performance of the 
modem in the fading channel characteristic of the mobile 
satellite service. This experiment also measured the 
performance of the modem's unique word detection system. 

4) Propagation channel characterization data: The data from 
this experiment is useful to characterize the 
communications channel in terms of fading and multipath 
losses. 

The Data Acquisition System (DAS) consisted of an IBM AT- 
compatible microcomputer system, data acquisition boards, a 
keyboard, a color monitor, and finally a mass storage device. 
Figure 1 shows the DAS and all its interfaces with the 
experiments. The DAS operated on a continuous, real-time basis, 
gathering various data generated by the experiments described 
above. Each experiment produced different data to be recorded for 
post-analysis. Some of the data were analog in nature, while 
others were digital. The DAS was charged with the responsibility 
of converting the analog data into digital data by the usual 
methods of sampling and performing analog-to-digital (A/D) 
conversion. The output of the entire experiment was stored in a 
Bernoulli box (the mass storage device). Table 1 shows inputs 
from various data sources, analog as well as digital, along with 
the sample size required for the desired accuracy.

The DAS sampled the various data and stored them in a binary 
offset format. This particular format is the result of the DAS 
software and is not common in computers. However, the DAS has the 
capability for converting the numbers from binary offset format 
to the more generally used ASCII format numbers. The data were 
divided into four different subsets according to their data rates 
and data-producing sources. The first set contains the reference 
and pilot channel in-phase and quadrature voltages. This set 
provides the experimenter with the amplitude and phase of the 
incoming reference and pilot channel signals. The sampling rates 
of the in-phase and quadrature channels were selected to be 1000 
samples per second for the pilot as well as reference channels. 
This data set was named the "Propagation Data Set" for obvious 
reasons. The second data set consisted of data from the dynamic 
and static phase lock loop error of the receiver system, and this 
data set was termed the "Loop Data Set." The third set of data 
was termed the "Antenna Data Set" and it contained the normalized 
difference, log sum, and temperature. These data were from the 
mechanically steered antenna system designed by JPL. Each source 
in this data set was sampled at a rate of 100 samples per second. 
All the three sets of data described above contained analog data, 
i.e., the DAS sampled the output at the proper rates, performed 
an A/D operation on them, and finally stored the data in an 
appropriate data set. The fourth data set was termed the "Digital 
Data Set" because it stored data resulting from digital sources 
in the experiment. This set contained an azimuth position data 
file, a gyro data file, a van speed data file and, finally, a 
file termed "spare data." The spare data file was included to 


8 


make room for future expansion in digital sources. The digital 
data are sampled at relatively low rates. 

The DAS was designed to accumulate 2.5 minutes of data from all 
four sets of data in its random access memory while 
simultaneously performing the A/D conversion for the analog 
sources. At the end of 2.5 minutes, the data were dumped into the 
mass storage device (the Bernoulli box). This action took some 
finite amount of time (much smaller than 2.5 minutes), during 
which the DAS did not gather any new data. After the data were 
dumped into the Bernoulli box, the 2.5 minutes of data 
accumulation started again. Using the data rates given in Table 
1, one can compute that the 2.5 minutes of data accumulation from 
each set of data mean that there are 600,000 samples from the 
first set, 20,000 samples from the second set, 30,000 samples 
from the third set, and 50,000 samples from the fourth set. Thus, 
in all, there are 700,000 samples (numbers) in each 2.5 minutes' 
accumulation. This 2.5 minutes of data accumulation formed a file 
in the mass storage device. At the end of the experiment all the 
data were resident in numerous 2.5-minute files. Figure 2 shows 
the details of a typical 2.5-minute file from the mass storage 
device . 

One thing to note here is that the DAS is a 16-bit machine, so 
when the sample needed only 12 bits to get the desired accuracy, 
the machine stored it as a 16-bit number with the four most 
significant bits turned to 0.

This section has described the data that were gathered as a 
result of the PiFEx experimentation; the following sections 
provide a possible data management system for the gathered data.

SECTION 3 


TRANSFER OF DATA FROM THE MASS STORAGE DEVICE TO THE MINICOMPUTER 

The DAS only sampled and accumulated the data into the mass 
storage device (Bernoulli box); it will not be used to analyze 
the data. This will be done by the VAX minicomputer. For this 
reason the data from the Bernoulli box will have to be 
transmitted to the VAX in some way. As was mentioned before, the 
data stored in the Bernoulli box is in a binary offset format; 
ordinarily a program would have to be written to convert this 
binary offset format to the ASCII format. However, to avoid this 
situation, the capability of the DAS to read and convert the 
numbers written in the binary offset format to the ASCII format 
will be used, and then the data will be sent to the VAX 
minicomputer via a hardwire connection. The DAS is equipped to do 
this easily. 

As a result, we will assume in what follows that all the 2.5- 
minutes files have been duly converted to ASCII format and 
transported to the VAX by the process described above. We will 
also assume that the order in which the data were stored in the 
Bernoulli box did not change during the transportation from the 
microcomputer to the minicomputer. Consequently, Figure 2, which 
shows the 2.5-minute data file structure in the Bernoulli box, 
also shows the file structure in the VAX.

SECTION 4 


DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 


The data base management system consists of several programs 
residing in the VAX minicomputer. These programs can be divided 
into two categories: one consisting of programs that handle the 
files and the other consisting of programs that handle the 
number-crunching aspects connected with the data. To use these 
files the user needs to log on to the VAX under his account code 
and then copy all the programs in the /U/KANTAK/PIFEX directory 
into his own directory. This is necessary to preserve the 
original files in case of a mishap with the user files. Once the 
data are transferred to the VAX minicomputer in the form of 
numerous 2.5-minute ASCII files, the above mentioned set of 
programs will be used to handle the data. These programs are 
listed below:

levels and least square fits to the proper 
Rician density function.

Computes the Fourier transform of 1024 
samples. 


The executable versions of the above files are included in the 
package so that the user does not have to compile anything. If 
the FORTRAN file is PIFEX##.F, then the corresponding executable 
file is called PIFEX##EX.

SECTION 5 


CALIBRATION 


The data that were sampled from the reference and pilot I and Q 
channels were essentially voltages, and these values depended 
upon the power supplied to the instruments. This implied that 
calibration of the instruments was necessary before data 
recording began. The following steps were followed to generate 
the calibration table to be used to scale the data: 

1. Connect the directional coupler (or the switch located at 
the antenna terminal) of the reference receiver to the 
calibration signal source. 

2. Vary the calibration signal power from -100 dBm to -70 dBm 
in steps of 2 dBm. The Data Acquisition System will sample 
the I and Q channels of the reference receiver once per step 
of the calibration signal, and the voltage levels wil] be 
stored in the Bernoulli box. 

3. Connect the directional coupler (or the switch located at 
the antenna terminal) of the pilot receiver to the 
calibration signal source. 

4. Follow the same step as for the reference receiver 
calibration. 

5. Turn the switches on the reference and pilot receivers to 
their respective antennas. 


15 


At this point the van was ready to travel and take the readings 
for all the planned experiments. At the end of the experiments 
the calibration steps described were executed again to ensure 
that the parameters of the system had remained essentially 
constant. As a result of the calibration the following table 
(Table 2) was generated for both the reference and pilot 
channels. These two tables were stored in the Bernoulli box 
during the PiFEx test, and then they were transferred to the VAX 
minicomputer along with the rest of the data. 

NOTE: The computer file storing this data will be a sequential 
file and each line of the above table will be stored as: 

In-phase channel volts:

5.1 CALIBRATION OF FILES 


Calibration is needed only for the propagation data, i.e., for 
the first set of data in the 2. 5-minute file (see Figure 2). 
There are 600,000 samples to be calibrated, and the remaining 
data in the 2.5-minute files (i.e., set #2, set #3 and set #4) 
should not be changed. The calibration tables for both the 
reference and pilot receivers were transmitted to the VAX 
computer and will be available to the user of the propagation 
data (the data of set #1).

FILE HANDLING 


At this point the user has the 2. 5-minute data files he is 
interested in calibrated and under the desired names. As was 
mentioned before, each calibrated 2.5-minute file has calibrated 
data set #1, data set# 2, data set #3, and data set #4. The user 
may be interested in any one or more of these data sets. The 
program PIFEX3 is supplied towards this end.

6.1 PIFEX3 


PURPOSE 


USAGE 


PIFEX3 OUTPUT 


: This program takes the calibrated or 
uncalibrated 2.5-minute file and segments it 
into eight different output files containing 
data set #1, data set #2, data set #3, and all 
the separate files of data set #4, respectively. 
The names of these eight files are : PROPDATA, 
LOOPDATA, ANTDATA, AZIDATA, GYRODATA, 
EXPTMODE, SPEEDATA, and SPARDATA. 

: PIFEX3 is not a FORTRAN file; it is written in 
the UNIX system language. The program is an 
executable file, and to use it the user has to 
enter 

PIFEX3 2.5-MINUTE FILE NAME 
and press return. 


: The output of PIFEX3 will be the eight different 
files named above. The output file named 
"PROPDATA" will contain only the calibrated or 
uncalibrated propagation data (i.e., data set 
#1). "LOOPDATA" will contain only the dynamic 
loop error and the static loop error (i.e., data 
set #2). The "ANTDATA" will contain the 
normalized difference, the log sum, and 
temperature. Basically, "ANTDATA" has data set 


26 


#3. Finally, the data set #4 files are as 
follows: "AZIDATA", which contains the antenna 
azimuth position; "GYRODATA" , which contains the 
vehicle turn rate; "EXPTMODE", which contains 
the information, valid or not; "SPEEDATA", which 
contains the van speed; and "SPARDATA" , which 
will be the empty file provided for future 
expansion.

SECTION 7 


PROGRAMS FOR PROPAGATION DATA ANALYSIS 


Every 2. 5-minute file has the propagation data in data set #1. 
The programs described in Section 6 will separate the propagation 
data set into its own file. Once the propagation data are 
isolated, the researcher may like to perform the usual operations 
on these data, such as computing the probability of the signal 
level's being greater than or equal to the given level, computing 
the probability density of the signal levels, computing the 
frequency of the fade duration, and generating the Fourier 
transform of the signal levels. Towards that end, a few programs 
are provided as noted in Section 4. 

Most operations on data described in this section generate the 
data for presentation in a plot form and hence make it necessary 
to have a plotter routine either on the VAX or on the 
researcher's microcomputer. A new plotter routine called AKPLOT 
goes a long way towards meeting these plotting needs. AKPLOT is 
both completely interactive and user-friendly. At the beginning 
of every plot there is an interactive session through which 
AKPLOT gathers the parameters necessary for the plot. The plot is 
produced on the screen, and the user is given the ability to 
change the plot to the desired form and finally perform a screen 
dump to a printer to produce a hard copy. AKPLOT was used to 
produce all the graphs in this manual.

The following 
PIFEX10 

USER RESPONSE 


: This program is useful in producing data for 
computing the probability of the signal level's 
being greater than or equal to the specified 
signal level. 

: The program specifies the signal level, starting 
at -130 dBw and going to -80 dBw in steps of 0.5 
dBw. For every step the probability of the 
signal level in the given file exceeding the 
specified level is computed and stored. 

: The symbolic file of the program is called 
PIFEX10.F. The extension "F" signifies that it 
is a FORTRAN file. The executable file for this 
program is also provided and is named PIFEX10EX. 
To run this program the user should type 
PIFEX10EX 
and press return. 

question and answer session will then follow: 

: Enter the input signal levels file name: 

: The user is required to input the name of the 
signal levels file for either the reference 
receiver or the pilot receiver. These files were 


35 


made by use of the PIFEX4 program. 

PIFEX10 : Enter the output file name: 

USER RESPONSE : The user is required to enter the name of the 

output file. 

PIFEX10 OUTPUT : The input to this program is the signal levels 

file, while the output will be two vectors. The 
first vector will contain the signal levels, 
while the second one will contain the 
corresponding probability of the incoming signal 
level's being greater than or equal to the level 
stored in the first vector. The levels in vector 

one will start at -130.0 dBw and reach up to 

-80.0 dBw in steps of 0.5 dBw. Thus there will 
be 100 entries in each vector. Figure 3 shows a 
representative output of this program.

function of the proper K factor to the data 
points via least squares fitting. 

: The symbolic file is PIFEX11.F. As before, the 
extension "F" indicates that the file is a 
FORTRAN file. The compiled (executable) version 
is supplied in the file PIFEX11EX. To use this 
program the user is required to input 
PIFEX11EX 
and press return. 

question and answer session will then begin: 

: Enter the input signal levels file name: 

: The user is required to input the name of the 
file storing the signal levels. This file should 
be generated by using the PIFEX4 program. 

: Enter the output file name: 

: The user is required to input the name of the 
file in which the output will be stored. If the 
entered name is a new name, then this file will 


38 



be created, but if the name is already in use, 
then PIFEX11 will use this file, i.e., the 
original data of the file will be erased. 

PIFEX11 OUTPUT : The input to this program is the signal level 

file. The output file, under the user-supplied 
name, will contain 100 entries of x(i),y(i) 
pairs where x(i) will contain the signal level 
starting from -130.0 dBw and reaching -80.0 dBw 
in steps of 0.5 dBw, while y(i) will contain the 
corresponding probability density value. The 
next 100 entries in this file will contain the 
pair x(i),y(i) where the x(i) value is the same 
as described above, but the y(i) value will be 
the corresponding Rician density value. Thus 
there will be in all 200 rows of entries into 
this file. This information will be needed by 
the plotter routine to be used to plot the 
curves. Figure 4 shows a representative output.
