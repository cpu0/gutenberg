ABSTRACT 


The application of a stroboscopic light within a certain frequency range may 
cause a subject’s brain waves to follow or become entrained to the same frequency as the 
flashing light. This phenomenon is known as photic driving. The objective of this study 
is to determine if computer monitors can be used as the presentation medium for photic 
driving, and to investigate whether any measurable cognitive changes can be caused 
through this photic driving. 

In the software design, two Java applets were written which caused the flashing of 
the screen in both a regular, set frequency and at a random frequency. A webpage was 
developed as a container for a subset of the Kit of Factor-Referenced Cognitive Tests. 
An empirical study was performed utilizing a light/sound machine, the Java applets as 
well as the cognitive tests. Twenty-five subjects were divided into three sample groups 
and their performance during all phases of the study were recorded and analyzed. 
Analyses of the results indicate that no direct correlation between photic driving and test 
score can be proved. Subjects’ comments following their participation indicate however 
that there were some significant effects caused by the photic driving that were not 
reflected in the test scores.

I. INTRODUCTION 


A. MOTIVATION 

In the latter part of the 1960’s and early 1970’s, the Bioengineering Project at the 
Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) was analyzing the frequencies of the 
electroencephalogram (EEG). This research focused primarily on the application of 
pattern recognition to detect changes EEG in response to specific stimuli [PARS76]. 

Since 1976, little to no research involving EEGs was pursued at NPS. 

B. OBJECTIVE 

It has been known to military organizations since at least the early 1960s that 
computers generate electromagnetic radiation that not only interferes with radio 
reception, but also leaks information about the data being processed [KUHN98]. This 
undesirable electromagnetic emanation is controlled via expensive protective shielding of 
electrical equipment so that equally expensive monitoring of the emanations, collectively 
known as TEMPEST, is not possible. In 1985 Wim van Eck published a paper in which 
he discovered that eavesdropping on a video display unit is possible at several hundreds 
of meters in range using inexpensive and readily available items such as a black-and- 
white TV receiver, a directional antenna and an antenna amplifier [ECK85]. What once 
required sophisticated detection and decoding equipment was now accessible to the 
masses, terrorists included. 

Ever since Berger (1929) demonstrated that it is possible to record the electrical 
activity of the brain by placing electrodes on the surface of the scalp, there has been 
considerable interest in the relationship between these recordings and psychological 
processes [COLE90]. If the brain emanations, or signal, can be detected much like 


1 



TEMPEST radiation, can we also decode it as we do TEMPEST radiation? Keim and 
Aunon described a procedure in which it is possible to distinguish various mental tasks, 
using only the EEG, to a high degree of accuracy [KEIR90]. Although this is a 
promising beginning, neurophysiology, computer science and biomedical engineering 
have not yet advanced to the point where scientists can actually “read minds”. 

It is the intent of this thesis to become the foundation for a new area of research at 
the Naval Postgraduate School in the Human Computer Interface (HCI). Specifically this 
research will deal with the potential for exploiting the human computer interface by 
altering EEGs via photic driving (PD). By using PD, the author will attempt to alter the 
brain’s functions and elicit a general change in cognitive functioning. To measure the 
effect of changing the overall EEG of the brain through PD, the experimental procedure 
measured the changes in performance and alertness. This requires a knowledge base 
including a thorough study of neocortical cells, EEG physiology, unfiltered wide band 
EEG spectral analysis, and computerized EEG analysis. 

C. APPROACH 

This thesis is unique in that the intent of the research alters the subject’s EEG 
without the subject’s knowledge through the use of PD, and explores the possible 
presentation of the computer code through remote computer network insertion. Other 
research is based on active and knowing participation by the subject and biofeedback 
techniques. 

The most obvious method of interfacing with a subject at a computer without their 
knowledge is to attempt to influence them through the CPU or video monitor emanations. 
Due to previous research results in photo-stimulation, the author chose to attempt 

modification of the subjects’ EEG through the CRT emanations.

D. THESIS QUESTIONS 

This thesis will attempt to answer the following questions: 

■ Can photo-stimulation be used to alter a subject’s cognitive functioning? 
Researchers have shown that changes can be detected in an EEG pattern when 
a subject is exposed to photic driving stimuli [GIZY93, MANG93], and 
SAKA93]. By changing the EEG of a subject, other researchers have shown 
that a subject’s mood can be affected [GIZY97]. Other researchers have 
shown that the brain can heal itself from alcoholism, learning disorders and 
increase an IQ [HUTC94]. By changing the cognitive functioning or mood of 
a subject, their ability to remain alert and increase their productivity may be 
affected. 

■ By what procedure can this be shown empirically? 

It is only through direct observation of the subject while they are being 
exposed to photo-stimulation can we determine if driving of the brain waves 
or that alteration of the cognitive functioning has actually occurred. The need 
to observe the subjects, record feedback from the subjects and evaluate subject 
performance during the exposure to photo-stimulation to insure that any 
alteration is detected reinforces the need for an empirical study. Not only will 
an empirical study provide data from which conclusions can be made, but it 
could also provide data that generates further questions and areas of follow on 
research.

■ Can the photo-stimulation be “hidden” from the subject? 

The use of placebos in medical experiments is commonplace. If a patient 
believes that they are being treated with a drug, even if they are only getting a 
sugar tablet, they may show improvement in their condition. By hiding the 
existence of photic driving stimuli, any placebo-like effects can be avoided. 

■ What cost-effective mechanisms can provide hidden photo-stimulation? 

A cost-effective mechanism would contribute to the potential use of this form 
of photo-stimulation. Dissemination of the photo-stimulation process would 
be significantly enhanced if the cost to the provider and the user were small. 

■ Is it possible to produce a desired change in cognitive functioning in the 
subject? 

As noted earlier, it has been shown that a subject’s mood can be affected by 
exposure to photo-stimulation. The ability to target a specific cognitive 
function for change would allow a subject to be exposed to photo-stimulation 
in different situations with different desired results. If a desired change could 
be produce, situation dependant application of photo-stimulation could be 
used to stimulate alertness in one environment, promote relaxation in another 
environment, and even increase creativity in another environment. 

■ By what methods can the desired changes be observ ed? 

A method that accurately evaluates and reflects changes in cognitive 
functioning is desired. The method must be incorporated into the overall 
empirical design in order to eliminate variables and to limit the scope of 
observations required. Without a properly evaluated and observable change in 


4 



the cognitive functioning of a subject, no definitive conclusions can be drawn 
regarding the effects of photo-stimulation.

II. BACKGROUND 


A. THE NERVE CELL 

The nervous system is organized assemblies of nerve cells as well as nonnervous 
cells. Nerve cells, or neurons, are specialized in the generation, integration, and 
conduction of incoming signals from the outside world or from other neurons [MICH95], 
Like all cells within the human body, the neuron has a semipermeable membrane that has 
holes or “gates” that allow certain molecules to pass in and out. The neuron membrane 
differs from other cells’ membranes in that it has extraordinary electrochemical 
properties [MATS90]. These extraordinary properties will be discussed later in the 
thesis. Besides the membrane, the main characteristics of the neuron are the cell body, or 
soma, the dendrites, the axon and the axon hillock (Figure 1). Besides containing the 
nucleus, which regulates the general functions of the cell, the soma produces secretory 
products called neurotransmitters and generates energy for the cell. The dendrites extend 
from the cell body and make contact with and receive signals in the form of graded 
potentials from other neurons [MATS90]. These signals serve as the incoming 
information to the cell. The information from all of the dendrites is integrated in the cell 
body and may generate an action potential (voltage spike) at the axon hillock [MICH95]. 
The axon is the conducting path of outgoing information (action potentials) and it 
eventually attaches to other neurons via a synaptic terminal. A synaptic potential is 
generated when the action potential reaches the synaptic terminal and electrically charged 
atoms (ions) of sodium (NA + ) and potassium (K + ) are allowed to pass through the cell 
membrane’s “gates”. These ions cause neurotransmitters to be released into the synaptic 
cleft (space between synaptic terminal and another neuron) where they then bind to the 


7 


adjacent neuron, or postsynaptic cell, to produce a graded potential. This graded 
potential starts the cycle in the postsynaptic cell. Another form of communication is via 
electrical ephaptic or tight junctions. These electrical ephaptics are significant in relation 
to pathological states, such as epileptic discharges [BARL93]. Within this framework it 
can be seen that in groupings or clusters, neuronal networks can be established that allow 
for communication chemically or electrically. 



The adult human brain can be divided into five basic structures based on their 
embryonic precursors. One of these structures, the telencephalon, contains the cerebral 
cortex. The cerebral cortex itself can be grossly subdivided into the frontal, parietal, 
temporal and occipital lobes (Figure 2). Currently available research indicates that parts 
of the frontal lobes are involved in the generation of certain emotional states, motor 
functions, oculomotor control, speech production and foresight. The temporal lobes are 
associated with audition, auditory and visual recognition and some of the perceptual 


8 



aspects of language. The parietal cortex contains the somatosensory projection field 
(cortical representation of the skin senses and kinesthesia) as well as some areas related 
to visual processing and convergence of visual with somesthetic information. The 
occipital lobes contain the primary visual cortex [MATS90]. The functions of these 
structures dictate that this portion of the brain is a likely candidate for exploitation. 
Within the cortex there are approximately 10 10 neurons [BARL93]. It is the combined 
synaptic potentials, membrane permeability changes, and the ion currents of these 10 10 


neurons that give rise to EEGs [BARL93, MATS90].

B. THE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM 


In 1929, Hans Berger connected two electrodes (small, round, metal disks) to a 
patient’s scalp and detected a feeble current by using a very delicate galvanometer. As 
electrical amplifiers and recording equipment came into common use, the EEG became a 
major clinical tool of the neurologist [DEUT93]. 

Although there have been a few advances in sensor technology, the general 
method of recording EEGs has changed little for since its introduction. The electrical 


9 







activity of the brain as recorded from the scalp is modified by the thickness of the scalp, 
muscles, skull bone and membranes surrounding the brain [DEUT93], Additionally, the 
infolding of the cortex complicates reception of the signal [BARL93]. 

The EEGs that can be recorded from a normal human brain are classified by 
wavelength and activity state (Table 1). The alpha waves (8-13 HZ) are visible during 
relaxed, closed eye state. Delta waves (0.5-4 HZ) are associated with deeper stages of 
sleep. Beta waves (12-22 HZ) are associated with alert states. Theta waves (4-7 HZ) are 
associated with some sleep states, and with anxiety. Gamma waves (>30 HZ) are 
believed to be associated with the mechanism of consciousness [BARL93].

Scalp electrodes that are used to record EEGs are placed on certain points on the 
scalp in accordance with the “10-20 System” of electrode placement. This system is 
based on the relationship between the location of an electrode and the underlying area of 
cerebral cortex (Figure 3). The positions are lettered F, T, P, and O for frontal, temporal, 
parietal, occipital and C for center (Note that there is no central lobe, but this is used for 
identification purposes). The left hemisphere has odd numbers and the right hemisphere 
has even numbers associated with it [CHUD98].

Figure 3. The “10-20 System” of electrode placement. [CHUD98] 

The EEG is recorded by attaching electrodes to the scalp using a paste that acts as 
a conductor. The Electrodes collect the signal, which is then sent to an amplifier, which 
increases the amplitude up 10 4 . The resulting signal is then displayed on a computer 
screen or written to a paper via a galvanometer. 

The EEG, as well as more sophisticated tools such as functional Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging (fMRI), are the preferred methods of studying cognitive 
neuroscience and brain functions. While these tools would be most useful in this thesis, 
their costs and associated expertise in reading data from the devices is prohibitive. 
Instead, an indirect method of measuring how the brain was responding was needed. The 
Kit of Factor-Referenced Cognitive Tests, published by Educational Testing Service, was 
selected due to its applicability to measuring cognitive behavior, and because there is a 
large database of results from previous testing.

C. CURRENT RESEARCH 


Dr. F. Terry Hambrecht, head of the Neural Prosthesis Program at the National 
Institute of Health, was quoted as saying that “DARPA [Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency] has come to us every few years to see if there are ways to incapacitate 
the central nervous system remotely.. .but nothing has ever come of it” [PAST97], The 
invention of the so-called “death-ray” that would either destroy or incapacitate an 
individual using only electromagnetic radiation is still only a science fiction dream. 
Timothy L. Thomas likens the human body to a computer in that they both contain 
myriad data processors, include chemical electrical activity of the brain, heart and 
peripheral nervous system, the signals from the cortex and the light sensitive retina and 
cornea of the eye [THOM98]. Thomas cites a Russian Source Dr. Victor Solntsev, who 
believes that a computer may be modified to become a weapon by using its energy output 
to emit acoustics that debilitate the operator [THOM98]. The use of computers as 
weapons is not supported by any published research, but the possibility of computer- 
based human effects begun here opens up an entire new realm of information operations. 

Douglas Pasternak wrote that a Mr. Eldon Byrd conducted experiments to see if 
brain waves would move into synchronization with waves impinging on them from the 
outside. Supposedly he was able to induce the brain to release behavior-regulating 
chemicals [PAST97], Again, published work is not available to support these claims. 

Within the “mainstream” community, Gloria Calhoun and Grant McMillan of the 
Armstrong Laboratory, Wright Patterson Air Force Base have published reports of using 
EEGs as a basis for controlling machines. The system they have used involves the self¬ 
regulation of an EEG response. Using biofeedback, subjects learn to increase or decrease 
the magnitude of the steady-state-visual-evoked-potential (SSVER) in response to an 


12 



evoking stimulus. These responses are translated via control algorithms into commands 
that control the operation of a physical device [CALH]. The use of EEGs-based control 
systems is in its infancy and is not yet utilizable for complex, normal workload, 
environments. With increasing computing power, application of neural networks, and 
new discoveries in neuroscience, EEG -based controls in complex systems is a 
possibility. 

Wolpaw, et al, are also involved in research based on voluntary control of the 
EEG. A user is tasked with moving a cursor on a computer monitor so that it contacts 
targets that appear randomly at the top, bottom and comers of the monitor. By 
voluntarily controlling their mu waves, users correctly select the target on 80-95% of the 
trials [WOLP91]. Again, this method of EEG-based control is in its rudimentary stages 
at best and will require significant human advances in human factors, bioengineering and 
computer science prior to real world applications being developed. In its present form 
might be used only by persons requiring physical assistance. 

Training an operator to exert voluntary control over their EEG response is not the 
only method of utilizing EEGs for control communications. Keim and Aunon, as 
previously mentioned, have shown that it is possible to distinguish between various 
mental tasks using only the EEG, to a high degree of accuracy. In the study, each subject 
was required to perform five distinct tasks: baseline measurement, complex problem 
solving, geometric figure rotation, mental letter composing and visual counting. The 
resulting EEG signal was amplified, and muscle signals were removed. After analysis of 
the 300 total test cases, it was determined that task pairs were classified 91.8% [KEIR90]. 
This study suggests that EEGs content can be analyzed, classified and translated into 
control signals. 


13 



In the medical community various devices that alter brain waves are used. D. J. 
Anderson used Variable Frequency Photo-stimulation (VFP) goggles in the treatment of 
patients with migraine headaches. The VFP goggles use red Light Emitting Diodes 
(LED’s) to alternatively illuminate the right and left eyes, at rate of 0.5 to 5.0 Hz per eye. 
The patients used the goggles at the onset of their symptoms and were able to adjust the 
frequency and intensity of illumination for comfort. Out of the fifty migraines reported, 
forty-nine were “helped” by the use of the VFP goggles and thirty-six were rated as 
“stopped” by the goggles. The duration of goggles ranged from 5 to 60 minutes. The 
mechanism of action of the VFP goggles on the migraine headaches remains unknown, 
but red stroboscopic lights are known to produce rapid and powerful alpha waves in the 
occipital cortex [ANDR89]. Although the study used goggles as the delivery method for 
the stroboscopic light signal, a computer monitor might also be used to transfer the light 
signal. 

The use of lights to cause changes in the brain is known as photic driving (PD). 
Photic driving is a physiologic response characterized by rhythmic EEG activity elicited 
by intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) with repetitive flashes mainly over the posterior 
regions of the head at frequencies of 5-30 Hz [SAKA93]. As the subject is exposed to a 
train of photic stimuli at a certain frequency, the brain waves become synchronized. This 
phenomenon has allowed photic stimulation of the EEG to be used as a sensitive tool for 
the detection of neurological changes. For example, it has been reported that 
Alzheimer’s patients produce a different harmonic response to photic stimulation than 
normal individuals. In children, the harmonic response to photic stimulation was shown 
to be a discriminating factor between people who suffer from migraine headaches and 
those who do not [GIZY97], 


14 



Not only is PD useful as a neurophysiological measurement, but some interest has 
been shown in the dynamics of PD per se, and in PD as a research tool for examining the 
relationship of rhythmic brain activity to .mental content and processes [MANG93]. It is 
this aspect of PD’s usage that will be explored in this thesis. If PD can be induced, does 
the frequency of entrainment correlate to the cognitive states associated with that 
frequency? 

It is interesting to note that the according to the Epilepsy Foundation of America, 
some epileptics have their seizures triggered by sensory stimuli, including flashing lights. 
Flash rates of 10 to 20 flashes per second are the threshold for causing seizures in 
photosensitive patients [EFA]. This has been dramatically evidenced by recent events in 
Japan where almost 700 children were taken to hospitals with seizures after watching a 
popular television cartoon. The cartoon scene that triggered the neurological episodes 
involved a bright-white explosion followed by brilliant red, white and blue lights that 
flashed like a strobe for about five seconds [SULL97], The phenomena of television 
induced seizures might be applicable to computer monitors as well. 

The amount of research dealing with the cognitive neuroscience that is being 
performed today is substantial. The human mind is one of the “last frontiers” and the 
desire to fathom its depths is strong. As the seat of our emotions, thoughts, bodily 
function controls and self- consciousness, the brain holds the keys to many aspects of our 
lives. The research that is being conducted in studying the EEG is an attempt to decipher 
the functions of the mind via its signals. These signals are being used to attempt the 
control aircraft, as in Calhoun and McMillan’s research, providing assistance to disabled 
persons as in Wolpaw’s research, and in a myriad of “alternative medicine” devices as 
entertainment through biofeedback and photo-stimulation. As of yet there is no Rosetta 


15 


Stone to unlock all of the language of the EEGs. Through increased computing power, 
better algorithms, and a deeper understanding of neurophysiology, the EEGs signal will 
eventually be deciphered in its entirety. 

In general, certain frequencies in the brain correlate to certain states of mind. 
Table 1 lists the predominant brain waves and mental states associated with them. As 
seen from Mangan’s research, PD can cause synchronization of brain waves in the alpha 
band, which is associated with relaxation and meditation. Researchers have produced PD 
in the theta, beta and gamma bands [GIZY93, MANG93, and SAKA93], Some research 
has been done in linking PD and on relationships to memory functioning and to “state” 
and mood factors [GIZY93]. Shealy and Cox found that photic stimulation in the theta 
band produced relaxation states in 50-100% of subjects, and others achieved relaxation 
after stimulation in the alpha band [SHEA90]. Anderson’s work showed that photo 
stimulation could be used to treat migraine headaches in some patients [ANDR89]. 

With the knowledge that brain waves can be altered using photic stimulation, 
means of measuring the results of this altering are needed. The EEG has long been an 
excellent tool in studying the brain, but it does not give an adequate description of the 
subject’s mental state or mood. As an indirect measurement of the overall state of brain 
function, cognitive evaluation exams might allow us a means of deciphering brain 
activity without measurement of the EEG. By applying photic stimulation while 
administering a cognitive exam to the subject, possible effects of PD might be 
discovered. 

D. POSSIBLE SOLUTION 

After a careful review of available literature, the most likely method of affecting a 

computer user’s cognitive behavior is through the application of photo-stimulation via a 

16 




computer monitor. A program that causes the computer hardware to create a specific 
photo-stimulation signal must be written, and this computer code must be delivered to the 
user’s computer with minimal interference to the user. It is desired that the signal be 
inconspicuous or subliminal so as not to distract the user. 

Two methods can be used to achieve this end. The first is by writing a virus that 
targets the video card and driver so as to cause the screen colors and refresh rates to be 
altered to a desired frequency and color. The second method is to write a small Java 
applet that runs in the background of any current application. This applet would cause 
the screen to change to a desired color at a specific frequency. For the scope of this 
thesis as a pilot study, the latter method is more applicable. 

The question of whether PD can cause changes to the EEG of a subject has been 
answered [GIZY93, SHEA90]. Their research has shown that a subject’s mood and level 
of relaxation can be altered. Cognitive changes in patients with Alzheimer’s have been 
detected using PD, and Anderson’s research shows that migraines can be eliminated 
using PD. With this research as a basis, the author can conclude that if photo stimulation 
is applied via a monitor, there is potential for photic driving and possible changes in the 
subject’s cognitive functioning. The research however deals primarily with the use of 
stroboscopic lights in the form of white flashing lights or LED’s as the method of photo 
stimulation. There has been no reported work on the use of computer monitors as the 
transmission media for photo stimulation. This thesis will attempt to contribute to the 
photic driving body of knowledge as a whole and to the use of computer monitors as a 
transmission media in particular.

III. METHODOLOGY 


A. PROBLEM ANALYSIS 

The goal of using a computer monitor to cause photic driving in a user was 
broken down into two aspects. The first aspect was that a program or application needed 
to be developed that could not only cause the screen to flash in a desired frequency range 
and format, but that would also allow for some type of evaluation method to co-exist on 
the display during the light flashes. Also, having an application that could run within the 
context of a web browser for potential information operations use was desired. The 
second aspect of the goal was that the author needed some method of determining 
whether there was an effect on the user. The cost of a machine that records EEGs as well 
as the costs of fMRI, etc. were prohibitive. Also, the author did not posses the required 
expertise to operate and interpret the data from these machines. A low cost, practical and 
acceptable alternative that measured cognitive behavior needed to be developed. 

Java was selected as the computer programming language for this thesis. The 
language supports the creation of small programs, or applets, that are web based and 
more importantly, the language also supports threads. Threads were especially important 
for this study when using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) because the screen flashing 
must be given priority for the CPU so that a smooth, regular flash rate is achieved. The 
Java programming consisted of writing an applet that was initialized and set to run in the 
background when the web page containing the evaluation test was in the foreground. 

This applet filled the display, and caused a transition from white to red at various 
frequencies. This applet came in two forms. The first form, called Flash.java, contained 
code that caused the screen to flash at a regular frequency of 20 Hz (see Appendix A). 


19 




The second form of the applet called Random Flash.java caused the screen to 
flash in a random pattern (see Appendix A). A webpage, called Cognitive HTML, was 
written in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and JavaScript. This webpage was 
contained the online evaluation tests and support functions such as tracking subject 
control numbers, submit and reset. The Cognitve.html webpage filled a small portion of 
the display with the text and images used in the cognitive function evaluation process. 
These images and text objects ran at a lower priority than the applet responsible for the 
flashing. The Cognitive HTML webpage used the JavaScript to check for completeness 
and performed and submission of the responses to the evaluation test as e-mail. This 
output stream was delayed until the subject had completed the exam in order to decrease 
any load on the CPU (see Appendix A). 

As noted, EEG recording equipment, fMRI, and other tools for measuring brain 
activity were not considered for use due to numerous reasons. Instead we needed a 
method that indirectly measured the subjects brain activity. The Kit of Factor- 
Referenced Cognitive Tests was selected as an indirect measurement tool of cognitive 
behavior. The Kit is a tool for studying reasoning, verbal ability, spatial ability, memory, 
and other cognitive processes. It contains 72 tests that have been demonstrated to be 
consistent markers in studies of 23 cognitive factors [EKST76], Out of these 23 
cognitive factors the author selected two categories of exams which could be used as 
measurements of specific aspects of cognitive behavior. The additional requirement of 
an online testing process as well as subject’s grasp of the English language, restricted us 
to a subset of the desirable exams. 


20 



B. EXPERIMENT DESIGN 


A number of factors have affected the design decisions of the experiment and the 
classification of this thesis as a pilot study. One of the most significant is the unique 
method of delivery for the photo stimulation. As mentioned earlier, no published work 
documents the use of computer monitors as the transmission media. Also, the use of 
cognitive evaluation tests to determine if photic driving (PD) has occurred, and has 
caused changes in the cognitive functioning of the subjects, is untested. As already 
mentioned, the use of an EEG or fMRI is the most common method of determining the 
presence of PD but such a machine is not a cost-effective method of evaluation. 

Although Shealy and Cox used tests to document changes in levels of relaxation caused 
by PD, this thesis is concerned with changes in cognitive functioning in terms of 
creativity, alertness, and productivity. Due to the number of unique goals and the 
methodology used to determine the achievement of these goals, we must consider this a 
pilot study that will act as a basis for work that will build on the goals achieved, and 
which will modify the methodology as needed. 

The subjects were drawn from a list of volunteers who were all students pursuing 
graduate degrees at NPS. The subjects were divided into three groups to correspond to 
the three treatments selected for the experiment. The three treatments chosen for the 
experimental process were as follows: 

Control Treatment - Relaxation period treatment of music and darkened glasses 
for 10 minutes followed by cognitive function evaluation exam with random 
sequence of flashing in background. 


21 




Light/Sound Treatment - L/S machine for 10 minutes as part of relaxation 
period followed by cognitive evaluation exam with random sequence of flashing 
lights. 

Driving Treatment - Relaxation period treatment of music and darkened glasses 
for 10 minutes followed by cognitive function evaluation exam with regular, fixed 
frequency of flashing in background. 

The students were divided into groups of three based solely on the availability of 
machines/computers. Each group was brought into a small conference room for a brief 
prior to beginning the experiment. The brief was read with particular emphasis on 
insuring that no volunteers were epileptics and that none were photosensitive (see 
Appendix B). After all questions were answered and a final warning concerning epilepsy 
and photosensitivity, consent forms were read and signed (see Appendix B). 

The subjects were then assigned a Control Number to ensure that results were 
anonymous. They were then given a short Pre-Evaluation questionnaire concerned with 
their general state of mind and level of wellness (see Appendix B). The subjects’ 
responses on this questionnaire were later compared to the responses on a similar 
questionnaire given at the completion of the experiment (see Appendix B). The subjects 
were given a brief on the lab and computer setup and were instructed on how to 
manipulate the computer pointing device (mouse) in order to answer the exam questions. 
Further instructions on computer window placement and sizing, how to terminate the 
background process, maintaining sitting distance from the screen, and the presence of 
video recording devices were reviewed. 

The Relaxation period began with the subjects being instructed to turn their seats 
around so as to limit their view of the other subjects. Subjects in the Control and Driving 


22 



groups were instructed to put on headphones and darkened glasses and wait for the signal 
to start their tape players. The Light/Sound group subjects were given assistance in 
donning the light sound machine goggles and headphones. The light sound machine 
provided a countdown timer prior to starting its program that was used to signal the other 
subjects to start their tape machines. During this ten-minute relaxation period, 
observations were recorded concerning subjects’ movements, expression, and general 
appearance of relaxation. 

Following the relaxation period, the subjects were led into the semi-darkened 
computer lab and instructed to sit in front of a computer and monitor based on their 
Control Number. The monitor in front of them had two windows open. A small window 
containing the cognitive evaluation test was centered in the foreground. A large window 
started by the Java applet filled the remaining space on the screen (Figure 4). According 
to their treatment group type (Control, Light/Sound, Driving) the Java applet was flashing 
randomly or at a specific frequency. 


23 






Figure 4. Appearance of monitor screen with both windows. 

The cognitive test was presented on the screen as a repeating series of images or 


as text followed by selection buttons. The following cognitive exams were selected from 
the Kit of Factor-Referenced Cognitive: 

Closure, Flexibility of (CF) Part 1 - CF is described in the Manual for the Kit as 
the ability to hold a given visual percept or configuration in mind so as to dis-embed 
it from other well defined perceptual material. It involves a process occurring in 
short-term memory whereby a figure is imaged in relation to a surrounding visual- 
representational field [EKST76]. CF requires a subject to search a distracting set of 
figures in order to find a given “hidden” figure. The CF test was selected since it 
requires intense visual concentration directed towards the screen and involves speed 
in selecting and eliminating figures. Other factors considered were the ability to be 


adapted to a computer-based test, and that no requirement existed to be proficient in 

24 


the English language. This test was utilized as Part 1 of the cognitive evaluation 
period of the study. 

Induction (I) Part 1 - Induction is described in the Manual for the Kit as the 
factor that identifies the kinds of reasoning abilities involved in forming and trying 
out hypotheses that will fit a set of data. It appears to be a two-step process requiring 
both concept formation and hypothesis testing [EKST76]. Induction was selected for 
this thesis due to the visual nature of the test, its ability to be modified to a computer 
based test, and its involvement of distinct cognitive reasoning. This test was utilized 
as Part 2 of the cognitive evaluation period of the study. 

The subjects were instructed to fill in their Control Number at the top of the 
cognitive evaluation test, read the instructions and begin the exam. A timer was 
started and after 12 minutes, the subjects were instructed to stop the first part of the 
test and continue with part two. The timer was restarted for an additional twelve 
minutes. After this time segment was over, the subjects were instructed to press the 
“submit” button followed by the “reset” button. If the subjects had not yet entered 
their Control Number, they were prompted to do so again before they could complete 
the submission. The subjects were then asked to leave the computer lab with the last 
instruction not to discuss the experiment process with others so as not to taint the 
volunteer pool. The subjects’ answers were emailed to the author for grading and at 
the completion of the thesis were made available to the subject if they desired them.

C. SUMMARY 


The chosen experiment methodology satisfies a number of the desired goals of the 
thesis. A careful design of the experiment protocol eliminated many variables and 
allowed the author to capture as much significant data as possible for the pilot study. The 
volunteers selected for the study were experienced computer users and although English 
was not a first language for a few, they were all proficient with the language. Although 
the entire group of volunteers could not be put through the experiment process at one 
time, the environment was kept consistent over the course of the study. The choice to 
include all the subjects in the Relaxation period, and not simply the Light/Sound group, 
was made to ensure consistency of treatment across the groups. 

Through the utilization of inexpensive and commonplace computers with 
monitors, the author was able to limit the need for funds in carrying out this thesis, and 
for any practical application that may follow from its results. 

The presence of two windows on the monitors was possibly a distraction for the 
subjects and might have caused them to focus their attention more on the flashing 
window vice the evaluation test window. The two-window system was utilized in order 
to ensure that the flashing screen occupied as much of the subjects’ field of view as 
possible, and that the thread controlling the flashing had priority of execution. Other 
methods considered included embedding the screen flashing into the background of the 
webpage containing the evaluation tests. This method was rejected because the screen 
flashing thread needed to take precedence over any other running thread which could not 
be assured if the code responsible for the flashing was embedded in the evaluation test 
webpage. Operationally the best screen presentation may be the Java applet with the 


26 



screen flashing embedded in applet due to the virtual universality of the JVM in web 
browsers. 

The selection of the Kit of Factor-Referenced Cognitive Tests as the evaluation 
tool assisted in meeting the goal of empirically showing the presence of the effects of 
photo stimulation on the subjects’ cognitive performance. While taking the cognitive 
evaluation tests, the subjects were video taped and their performance on each part of the 
test was associated with their body position, attitude, and degree of comfort. The scores 
for the groups can be compared to each other to determine the presence of any significant 
alteration in performance. 

Careful analysis of the observations made during the relaxation period, the 
observations made from the video taped cognitive evaluation test period, test scores, and 
subjects’ responses on the Pre- and Post-Evaluation questionnaires is imperative in order 
to have reliable results. Inclusion of the video tape recording was significant in that any 
direct physical effects of the flashing could be observed, and if necessary, reviewed. 
Controlling the conditions between and within the groups was accomplished through the 
homogeneity of the different phases. These factors and conditions allowed us to test the 
hypothesis of the pilot study which, simply stated, was to determine if changes could be 
made to the cognitive functioning of a subject via PD.

IV. RESULTS 


A. TREATMENT #1 

Treatment #1 consisted of a ten minutes session with the Light/Sound machine 
(20Hz), followed by the cognitive evaluation period with a randomly flashing 
background. The results for this group can be found in Appendix C and are summarized 
as follows: 

Pre-Questionnaire Summary 

On a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being the lowest and 5 the highest) this group rated 
themselves on average as a 4 in Computer abilities, 4.3 in overall cognitive abilities, 4 in 
current state of mind, and 4.1 in current physical state. These self-ratings, except the 
computer ability rating, were the highest out of all the groups. The majority, 71%, of the 
subjects in this group participated in the experiment during the afternoon. 

Relaxation Results 

Objective observations during the relaxation period were that 72% of the subjects 
remained quiet, 42% were still, and 57% appeared to be relaxed. These subjects tended 
to display more movement than the others, and were more likely to appear tense. The 
overall impression was that movement was higher and feelings of relaxation were lower. 

Subjective observations from the Post-Evaluation Questionnaire covering the 
relaxation period spanned from “relaxed” to “on-edge” and “lethargic”. One of the 
subjects also stated that vision in his right eye was out of focus for some time after 
exposure to the L/S machine. This loss of vision was unexpected and review of the light 
sound machine documentation does not suggest this as a side effect to use of the machine. 


29 



The overall subjective comments on the effects of the relaxation period were too mixed to 
categorize. 

Cognitive Evaluation Results 

Videotaping the subjects as they took the online evaluation was the method 
utilized to collect the cognitive evaluation observations for all groups. The video camera 
was placed so that the view recorded was from the subjects’ side and included the subject 
from the waist up, including the subjects’ hands, and the computer terminal. See Figure 5 
for photograph of a typical cognitive evaluation period setup. Due to a technical problem 
data for three of the seven subjects in this group was not usable. This group had the same 
number of subjects displaying movement as those remaining still. 



Figure 5. Laboratory setup for cognitive evaluation period. 


30 









Objective observations of the data available indicate that this group of subjects 
appeared the least comfortable of all the groups at 50%. The group also appeared to be 
about 50% still, and 75% maintained the proper distance from the terminal screen. The 
average number of times these subjects moved their bodies as well as their heads was 
lower than that of the other groups. The overall impression was that these subjects were 
concentrating, with little extraneous movement. 

This group answered an average of 8.4 questions on Part 1 with an average of 4.3 
correct answers (standard deviation of 5.47,2.05 respectively). On Part 2, this group 
answered an average of 14 questions and averaged 11.7 correct with standard deviations 
of 0.81 and 1.97 respectively. 

Post-Questionnaire Summary 

During the relaxation period, 71% of the subjects in this group reported that both 
their mental and physical states were affected by the Light/Sound machine exposure. Of 
the group, 2 indicated that the Light/Sound machine treatment left them relaxed and 1 
reported that they were alert and on edge. One subject reported out of focus vision in the 
right eye that lasted for a few minutes after the Light/Sound machine treatment. Their 
average state of mind and average physical state were 3 and 3.3 (out of 5). 

For the evaluation period, 100% reported that their state of mind was affected and 
57% reported that their physical state was affected. Tired eyes and frustration were the 
main comments for this group. Reported physical states improved from an average of 3.3 
after the relaxation period to an average of 3.6 after the cognitive evaluation period. 
During the period 3-24 hours after their participation in the experiment, 29% reported 
some sort of residual effects. Two members of this group reported headaches, and as 
previously mentioned one complained of vision problems. 


31 


B. TREATMENT #2 


Treatment #2 consisted of a ten-minute relaxation period with darkened glasses 
and soft music, followed by the cognitive evaluation with the driving background (20Hz). 
The results for this group can be found in Appendix C and are summarized as follows: 

Pre-Questionnaire Summary 

This group rated themselves the highest of the three groups in computer abilities 
at 4.2. They rated themselves at an average of 3.6 for cognitive abilities, 3.9 for current 
mood and state of mind, and 3.8 for physical state. This group had half its members 
participating in the study during the afternoon and half in the morning. 

Relaxation Results 

Objective observations for this group indicated that 80% remained quiet, 70% 
remained still and 90% appeared relaxed. This group had at least one subject that fell 
asleep with another that was possibly asleep as well. For most subjects, there were small 
to no movements observed and one subject appeared to be bored by the proceedings. 
Overall this group was observed to be relaxed and quiet. 

Subjective comments recorded on the Post-evaluation Questionnaire included 
“more at ease, lower heart rate”, “drowsy and tired” and one comment that the relaxation 
period put them in a “good frame of mind”. No subjects complained of tenseness, 
lethargy, or altered physical state due to this phase. Overall impression of the subjective 
comments are that the subjects were very relaxed and quiet. 

Cognitive Evaluation Results 

The observation covering the cognitive evaluation phase showed that 90% of the 
subjects in this group were comfortable and 50% remained still. This group had the 
highest average head and body movements at an average of 38.8 head movements and an 


32 



average 11 body movements. This group had the lowest percentage, 30%, of subjects 
who maintained the correct distance from the monitor. 

On Part 1 of the cognitive evaluation, this group averaged 4.8 questions 
answered with an average of 5.1 of these question answered correctly, which was the 
highest average of the three groups. The standard deviations for Part 1 were 4.83 and 
3.17. Out of the average 13.7 questions answered on Part 2 of the cognitive evaluation, 
an average 11.4 were answered correctly with standard deviations of 2.36 and 2.84 
respectively. 

Post-Questionnaire Summary 

This group had the lowest subjective ratings of the groups for effects of the 
relaxation period on their state of mind and physical states. They reported that 70% of 
the subjects’ states of mind were affected and only 50% of the subjects were physically 
affected. Out of the group, 3 reported that they felt relaxed after the relaxation phase. 
Their reported average mental and physical states were 3 and 3.2 respectively. 

Only 50% of this group reported effects on their state of mind due to the cognitive 
evaluation period, which was the lowest percentage of the groups. During the cognitive 
evaluation period, 2 subjects reported feelings of frustration and 1 subject reported an 
increased heart rate due to a nervous physical state. Effects on their physical state were 
reported by 40% and included a comment concerning “residual effects” felt 3-24 hours 
after participation in the study. There was no reported change in their state of mind from 
the relaxation period to the post-evaluation period and only a change from an average of 
3 to an average of 3.2 in their physical state over the same time frame. No members of 
this group reported any headaches and only 1 reported feeling “queasy and unable to 
focus”. 


33 



C. TREATMENT #3 


Treatment #3 consisted of a ten-minute relaxation period with darkened glasses 
and soft music, followed by the cognitive evaluation with a randomly flashing 
background. The results for this group can be found in Appendix C and are summarized 
as follows: 

Pre-Questionnaire Summary 

This group reported themselves as the lowest average of all the groups for 
computer abilities with an average of 3.9. Their reported overall cognitive abilities 
average of 3.6, mood average of 3.6, state of mind average of 3 and physical state 
average of 3.1 were also the lowest self-evaluations of all the groups. Sixty-two percent 
of this group participated in the study during the afternoon hours. 

Relaxation Results 

Objective observations for this group during the relaxation period indicated that 
88% remained quiet and 88% remained still both of which were the highest percentages 
of the groups. Seventy-five percent appeared relaxed. This group displayed similar signs 
that Treatment group #2 displayed. They were quiet, relatively motionless, and a few 
subjects were possibly asleep. One of the subjects appeared tense and uncomfortable 
during this phase. The overall observation for this group is that they were relaxed and 
quiet. 

Subjective comments for the relaxation period sustain the objective observations 
in that the subjects reported that they were “relaxed”, “less tense”, “tired”, and 
“refreshed”. There were no complaints of altered physical states or tenseness for this 
phase. 


34 



Cognitive Evaluation Results 

The objective observations made during the cognitive evaluation period show that 
all the subjects in this group appeared comfortable but only 25% of them remained still. 
Body and head movement averages were 10.5 and 33.9 respectively. Half of the subjects 
maintained the correct distance from the monitor. One subject did not appear 
comfortable at first but this was attributed to the fact that he had momentarily sat in front 
of the wrong computer. 

This group answered the fewest average questions on Part 1 of cognitive 
evaluation at only 7, with a standard deviation of 4.84. They were correct on average 
about 4.3 times with a 3.69 standard deviation. On Part 2 of cognitive evaluation, this 
group had the highest average of questions answered, 14.1, and the highest average of 
correct answers, 12.5. 

Post-Evaluation Summary 

Percentages of 88% and 75%, which were the highs among the groups, were 
reported by this group for effects on their state of mind and physical state due to the 
relaxation period. Four subjects reported feelings of relaxation and of being refreshed 
and 1 subject reported that they felt tired. Their average physical state and state of mind 
were 3 and 2.75, respectively. 

During the cognitive evaluation period, effects on their state of mind were 
reported by 88% of the subjects. This group had the lowest percentage, 25%, of reports 
that their physical state was effected by the cognitive evaluation period. Their reported 
state of mind following the cognitive evaluation period was the same as that reported 
following the relaxation period, but their average physical state over the same period 


35 




improved from 2.75 to 3.25. A high of 38% reported that they felt effects of headaches 
or queasiness 3-24 hours after participation in the study. 

D. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS 
Analysis Within This Experiment 

During the relaxation period, the Light/Sound group was the least relaxed of the 
three groups. This may be attributed in part to the fact that this was a first time exposure 
to a Light/Sound machine. Due to the quiet nature of the music played to the other 
groups and the lack of visual stimuli, they reported a greater level of relaxation. 

The cognitive evaluation period observations indicate that the screen flashing, in 
particular the random pattern flashing, caused physical problems for some of the subjects. 
No headaches were reported by the group exposed to the steady, 20Hz driving flashing, 
but a full one third of the subjects in the other groups reported mild to severe headaches 
after exposure to the randomly flashing screen. 

The questions in Part 1 of the cognitive evaluation, which evaluated Flexibility of 
Closure, were labeled the most difficult in the online evaluation period. Overall the 
groups answered an average of only 7.9 of the 16 questions and were correct on an 
average of only 4.5 of these. The Flexibility of Closure test is very visually intensive in 
nature. It required intense concentration directed toward images on the screen for long 
periods of time. It is believed that the presence of the screen flashing directly distracted 
the subject, thus causing the low numbered answered and low number correct. 

On Part 2 of the cognitive evaluation, which evaluated Induction, the subjects 
performed better. The groups answered an average of 13.9 questions out of 16, and were 
correct on 11.9 of these. The Induction test, unlike the previous test, did not require 


36 



intensely staring at the images. Subjects were likely to have moved a little further away 
from the monitor at this time since they did not have to concentrate as intently on the 
screen images and some subjects were observed counting on their fingers to assist them 
in determining the correct answer. 

Difference of Means Significance Test 

The Difference of Means Significance Test was performed on each part of the 
online evaluation. For the calculations, there were two degrees of freedom in the 
numerator and 22 degrees of freedom in the denominator. Table 2 depicts the calculations 
performed for this test. 

The calculated F is in each of the 4 cases, less than the critical values of the F 
distribution for a = . 10, a = .05, or a = .01. These results show that there was no 
significant difference between the performance of the groups on the two cognitive 
evaluation tests. These results were supported by Chi- Square test for k independent 
samples over the same data. 

Although these calculations show that the cognitive evaluation performances were 
not significantly different due to the photo-stimulation, they do not prove that there was 
no effects produced by the photo-stimulation. The observation data that was gathered as 
well the subjects’ own responses on the questionnaires indicate that the photo-stimulation 
did have some effects.

V. CONCLUSIONS 


A. SUMMARY OF WORK 

The Difference of Means Significance test and the Chi-Square test for k 
independent samples indicate that the author cannot prove that significant effects were 
reflected in the cognitive evaluation due to the photo stimulation. These same tests do 
not disprove that the photo-stimulation treatment caused some effects. Objective and 
subjective reports indicate that treatment with the light sound machine produced more 
observable expressions of tenseness and discomfort during the relaxation period. 

Subjects in the Light/Sound treatment group were the only ones to report headaches 
during the relaxation period. One of these subjects repeatedly adjusted the volume and 
intensity of the light due to the discomfort it produced. Since the Light/Sound machine is 
a device that is used exclusively for photo stimulation, it is apparent that some effects on 
the cognitive functioning of the subjects in this group did occur. 

Observations during the evaluation period indicated that the majority of the 
subjects gradually increased their distance from the monitor during the online evaluation 
period. Since all of the subjects were exposed to some form of a flashing background, 
this phenomenon can probably be attributed to the discomfort caused by the flashing. 

The notion that the movement away from the monitor was a sign of relaxation was 
rejected based on the subjects’ responses on the Post-Evaluation Questionnaire. 

Subjects’ responses and observations made during the cognitive evaluation period 
indicate that the random screen flashing did adversely affect a number of the subjects in 
the Light/Sound machine and Control groups. A number of these subjects reported that 
they experienced headaches caused by the cognitive evaluation period. These 


39 



occurrences are even more significant when compared to the experiences of those 
subjects in the Driving group. The Driving group subjects, who received a constant rate 
of flashing, did not report any headaches either during or after the cognitive evaluation 
period. This data suggests that the random flashing did cause a change in the cognitive 
functioning of the subjects. This conjecture may have implications for those who design 
virtual environments in some instances where computing power, distributed systems and 
protocols may not permit adequate refresh rates for an application. Another area where 
this conjecture might be applicable is in the development of applications where monitors 
are filled with constantly changing windows. These constantly changing windows may 
cause unintended effects in a user. 

Through careful design of an experimental protocol the author eliminated many 
undesirable variables. Careful observation, recording and evaluation at each phase were 
critical to insure a quality study. Measurement of alterations in cognitive functioning 
while exposed to photo stimulation must occur in a tightly controlled environment. 
Consistency between and amongst the samples was guaranteed through a careful 
empirical design and vigilant attention to detail. One of the more significant issues 
encountered was determining the method of evaluating any change in cognitive 
functioning. This issue was partly overcome by using selected portions of the Kit of 
Factor-Referenced Cognitive Tests. The selected tests were applicable to the cognitive 
factors that would most likely be affected by PD, and they were easily transformed into 
usable web-based evaluations. The use of the Pre- and Post-Evaluation Questionnaires 
was also necessary to insure that any changes in cognitive functioning not detected by the 
cognitive evaluation tests would be properly recorded and evaluated. The subjects’ 
responses to the questions and their comments enabled some data that may have been 


40 




missed by simply the cognitive testing procedure to in fact be captured and analyzed. It is 
surmised that in this instance, the cognitive evaluation data, while being correct, was 
insufficient to properly evaluate all of the possible effects of the photo-stimulation. 

Hiding the photo stimulation from the subject was only partially successful. A 
number of the subjects reported that they observed the flashing pattern in the background. 
It is surmised that most, if not all, of the subjects were to a certain extent aware that there 
was indeed some event occurring in the background. The level of luminance may 
possibly need to be adjusted so that the flashing might be completely hidden from the 
subject. Such a reduction in luminance of the flashing may not be adequate to elicit PD 
and so any change would have to be thoroughly studied prior to implementation. Since 
this thesis did not directly test for the presence of PD in the subjects, there is the 
possibility that the photo stimulation provided to the Driving group was not adequate to 
elicit the driving response. If the photo-stimulation proved inadequate in eliciting the PD 
response, possible reasons might include the level of luminance, field of view covered 
and duration of photo stimulation treatment. 

Through the necessity of fiscal constraint, and to insure widespread utilization if 
the results of the thesis proved usable, finding an inexpensive method of delivering 
photo-stimulation is needed. Since the author was attempting to affect changes in 
computer users, limiting the selection of delivery methods to a desktop computer and its 
peripherals was considered a straightforward approach to solving the problem. The 
presence of computers and the associated monitor is commonplace throughout the 
Department of Defense and even most of the civilian sector. The small size and the 
machine independence of the Java programming language insures that the applet could be 
sent virtually to any computer and run correctly once executed by the user. Costs 


41 


incurred during the development and subsequent utilization of the thesis were minimal. 
Potential costs that would be passed on to a user, through retrieval, installation and 
execution of the code would also be minimal. 

As noted earlier, it has been shown that a subject’s mood can be affected by 
exposure to photo-stimulation [GIZY97], These changes in mood occur at specific 
frequencies of photo-stimulation. By selecting a target frequency of brain waves that is 
associated with high levels of alertness and active thinking, this thesis attempted to cause 
PD at that frequency. Although the cognitive evaluation results did not prove that 
changes did occur, they also did not disprove that change occurred. The small sample 
size was probably the most significant factor that limited full assessment of the actual 
presence or absence of changes in the subjects’ cognitive functioning. The small sample 
size and utilization of only specific parts of the tests form the Kit of Factor-Referenced 
Cognitive Tests combined with the unique, computer based presentation of the tests 
prevent the author from comparing the results from this thesis to results from other 
applications of the Kit’s tests. This will hopefully be addressed by follow on research by 
increasing the sample size and by expanding the time allotted for the subjects to 
participate. 

B. FURTHER RESEARCH APPLICATIONS 

The potential for use of PD is immense if it can be induced via desktop computer 
monitors. Different aspects of the brain wave patterns could potentially be affected by 
goal-specific PD frequencies in virtually any setting whether shipboard or ashore. In 
situations where high levels of stress and fatigue are commonplace, such as a Combat 
Information Center, PD could be utilized to increase alertness and stress. Other 


42 



applications of goal-specific PD frequencies include increasing student or general user 
creativity and productivity. 

The Department of Defense is committed to research that explores the use of 
simulations and virtual environments as cost cutting measures to replace real world 
training. Total immersion environments and those virtual worlds that are experienced 
through head mounted displays or goggles are situations where PD may be utilized. The 
field of view of these devices that are covered by the virtual images is higher than what 
can be accomplished using a single monitor and as such PD effects may be more likely to 
occur. One potential drawback is the present state of the art in head mounted display 
fidelity. 

For situations where PD is not warranted or would cause damage, disabling Java 
would be a sufficient method to prevent transmission of PD containing applets. Filtering 
of the contents of webpages, and specifically attached Java applets or mobile code, at the 
firewall might also be a potential method to prevent undesirable PD transmissions. Since 
the flashing could be caused by alterations to the video card and/or video drive, the 
flashing code could also be encoded as part of a virus that targets this card or drive. 
Depending on the size and structure of the virus produced, virus protection software 
would probably be an adequate defense in this case. 

C. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH 

To determine if PD is actually occurring, rather than simply looking for potential 
changes caused by it, further studies should include the use of an EEG or if possible an 
fMRI. These devices could be used to prove that PD via a specific transmission media 
was present. As noted previously the cost, availability and technical expertise required in 


43 




utilizing these devices precluded their use in this study, and may limit their use in future 
studies. 

A full factorial design should be implemented as the next logical step in a future 
study. By adding a treatment consisting of Light/Sound machine followed by the driving 
frequency application, more variables could be eliminated. Also, in order to increase the 
number of scores on the cognitive evaluation for comparison purposes, a large number of 
subjects should take the online evaluation without any relaxation treatment or flashing in 
the background. These scores could then be directly compared to those scores achieved 
by the study subjects. Also, any increase in sample size would significantly benefit 
follow on research. By utilizing full sets of test from the Kit of Factor-Referenced 
Cognitive Tests, comparisons could potentially be made with other studies as long as the 
effects of the online presentation of this thesis’ tests could be statistically eliminated. 

The use of larger monitors, or even as mentioned earlier, virtual reality goggles, to 
increase the field of view coverage might be useful. Current methods of inducing PD 
practically fill the field of view of the subject. The online evaluation period utilized 21” 
monitors but even this size did not fill the subjects’ field of view. The use of a semi- 
darkened room in which the cognitive evaluation period was conducted is an artificial 
environment, but for the purposes of this thesis as a pilot study, decreasing the ambient 
lighting in the room were considered necessary to increase potential for effects of the 
photo-stimulation. 

This study explored the use of a 20Hz driving frequency in both the Light/Sound 
machine treatment applied during the relaxation period and as the background flashing 
rate for the Driving group applied during the cognitive evaluation period. This frequency 
was intended to promote alertness and “faster thinking” in the subjects. Other 


44 



frequencies, such as the alpha (8 - 13Hz) or theta (4 - 8Hz) frequencies might be studied 
as potential frequencies in hopes of causing relaxation or creativity. 

In this study, all of the subjects in. the volunteer pool were graduate students at 
NPS. Broadening the pool, to include more international students, non-students and 
perhaps the general public, would significantly increase the sample size and would give a 
more diverse group to the empirical study. The time required for a subject to complete 
the entire experiment was approximately 1 hour. Many students were interested in 
participating in the study, but could not due to conflicting class and lab schedules. 
Extending the time required to participate would allow for more thorough testing to be 
performed, but might potentially limit the number of volunteer subjects. 

Associated with the time required to participate in the study is the number of 
cognitive factors that were tested. Increasing the number of factors in question increases 
the amount of time to participate which unfortunately my preclude participation by some 
volunteers. In this thesis, 2 cognitive factors were explored. Flexibility of Closure and 
Induction. In follow on work, selection of a single factor for which to test, might allow 
for a more intensive and revealing exploration of that cognitive factor. The chaining of 
tests for the single cognitive factor might contribute to a “learning” of the test, but this 
phenomenon could be accounted for in the analysis. 

As noted earlier, the Driving group did not experience headaches caused by the 
flashing background. Subjects from both the Light/Sound machine and Control groups 
reported headaches due to the cognitive evaluation period. The differences reported by 
the subjects exposed to the different forms of the flashing suggest that further research is 
required to fully understand and possibly utilize this phenomenon. The adopting of a full 
factorial design might be useful in exploration of this phenomenon.

APPENDIX B. SUPPORT DOCUMENTS AND FORMS 


This appendix contains the forms and documents that were required for tracking, 
briefing and evaluating the subjects. The following forms are included: Brief Sheet, 
Consent Form, Pre-Evaluation Questionnaire and Post-Evaluation Questionnaire. 


73 



BRIEF SHEET 


1. The experiment you are about to participate in is very simple in nature. You will start 
out by answering a short questionnaire and filling out a consent form. After the 
paperwork is out of the way and your questions are answered, you will asked to relax 
for approximately 10 minutes prior to beginning the online evaluation. 

2. During the relaxation period you will asked to put on headphones and then arrange 
yourself comfortably in a chair. You will then press the “ON” button on the device, 
put on a pair of darkened glasses and relax. During this period you may either keep 
your eyes open or closed. Please try to remain as quiet as possible during this period. 

3. An assistant will notify you when the 10 minutes is up. You will then take off the 
darkened glasses and headphones and will proceed to the computer lab. You will 
take your assigned seat in front of a computer and monitor. For the purpose of this 
experiment please sit so that your eyes are within 18” of the monitor. Do not adjust 
the size of the application windows. Use the horizontal and vertical scroll bars to 
bring objects into the window. 

4. Once seated type your Control Number into the space provided. The assistant will 
give you a few minutes to read the directions and then will announce how much time 
you have to complete the evaluation. Please follow the assistant’s directions. If you 
have questions or problems that cannot be answered by the online directions, ask the 
assistant. Although we ask that you do not close any processes, if you feel that you 
must close one, you may. Once you have completed the evaluation, simply press the 
“Submit” button. If you have not yet entered your Control Number you will 
prompted to do so. At this time you are free to exit the lab 

5. You will be sent a questionnaire via e-mail within 24 hours. Please take the time to 
fill out and respond to this last portion of the testing process. 

6. Once again, this experiment is voluntary and it is not expected that any ill effects will 
be induced. Remember if you are an epileptic or are photosensitive, you must not 
participate in this study. If you have any questions please ask them now.

CONSENT FORM 


Human Computer Interaction Experiment 

Contact Information: This study is being conducted by Major Robert Peterman (CS73, 
656-2509, petennan@cs.nns.navv.mil) . 

Risks of being in the study: If you are an epileptic or are photosensitive, you should not 
participate in this study. Research indicates that adults are not susceptible to seizures 
triggered by photo stimulation. Also, the photo stimulation that you might be exposed to 
is not in the triggering frequency range. This study has no other unordinary risks beyond 
those encountered in your everyday workplace. 

Confidentiality: The records of this study will be kept private. We will not make any 
information publicly accessible that might make it possible to identify you as a 
participant. 

Voluntary nature of the study: If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw at 
any time without prejudice. 

If desired, you will be given a copy of this form for your records. 

Statement of consent: I have read the above information. I have asked questions and 
have had my questions answered. I consent to participate in the study.

Light sound machine treatment caused all day headache. Adjusted volume/intensi 


3) Relaxed after relaxation period (had been sitting at computer for 3 hrs prior to 
participation). 9) After exam was physically tired, but more focused. Helped later in the day 
with other projects 


3) Vision in right eye out of focus. This lasted only for first few minutes of evaluation period. 
9) # hours after participation, developed a headache. 


3) More alert, possibly on edge. 8) Alert but did not want any more visual activity at that 
time. Eyes were tired, but not mental state. Past thinking, but leave my eyes alone. 9) After 
eyes rested, was fine remainder of the day. 


Relaxation period was spent trying to "figure out" what L/S were for. Online portion spent 
looking for "subliminals" in flashing background. Shapes exam very difficult. 


3) Felt very relaxed and lethargic ("heavy" muscles). 6) Not necessarily fast thinking, but 
alert and frustrated. 7) Muscles no longer lethargic._ _ _ 


5) Frustrated with not being able to distinguish shapes in the patterns. Some anxiety because I 
wanted to see the patterns at the same time without scrolling. 7)Eyes felt tired and strained 


2 headaches, 1 out of focus vision in one eye, 2 relaxed, 1 alert/on edge,

7) Felt frustrated and a little more agitated after completing the online evaluation. Believe 
this made me physically more active (in a nervous way) and my heart rate increase.

I began to feel nervous soon after the evaluation began, and continued to feel queasy for 2-3 
hours afterwards (much like motion sickness) Also had a slight headache for the rest of the 
day.
