1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by meeuis of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: A, 
B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class to 
which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B and 
class L tests are expected to produce errors at conpile time and link time, 
respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking mamner amd produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result vdien they 
are executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, 
and the procedure CHECK FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT 
also provides a set of Tdentity functions used to defeat some cMnpiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by scxne of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a conpiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is conpiled and the 
resulting conpilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada inplementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Stemdard involving multiple, separately conpiled units. Errors 
are expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
inplementation-specific values — for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in Appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and 
inplementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this implementation are described in section 2.3. 


1-2 



INTRCOUCTION 


For each Ada iiqpleinentation, a customized test suite is produced by the 
AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications described in 
the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see section 2.1), and 
possibly removing some inapplicable tests (see section 2.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each test of 
the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives v^ich are irrelevant 
for a given Ada implementation. Reasons for a test's inaf^licability may 
be supported by documents issued by the ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Ccminentaries and ccxnroonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Conmentaries are included as 
appropriate.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIOaS 

McxJifications (see section 1.3) were required for 21 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
inpleinentation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the 
way expected by the original tests. 

B24009A B33301B B38003A B38003B B38009A 

B38009B B85008G B85008H BC1303F BC3005B 

BD2B03A BD2D03A BD4003A 


A35801E was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by 
the AVO. The compiler rejects the use of the remge 

FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST as the reinge constraint of a floating-point type 
declaration because the bounds lie outside of the range of safe numbers 
(cf. LRM 3.5.7:12). 

CD1009A, CD1009I, CD1C03A, and CD2A31A..C (3 tests) were graded passed by 
Evaluation Modification as directed by the AVO. These tests use 
instantiations of the support procedure LENGTH_CHECK, which uses 
Unchecked_Conversion according to the interpretation given in Al-00590. 
Ihe AVO ruled that this interpretation is not binding under ACVC 1.11; th 
tests are ruled to be passed if they produce Failed messages only from th 
instances of LENGTH_CHECK—i.e, the allowed Report.Failed messages have 
the general form: 

" * CHECK ON REPRESENTATION FOR <TYPE_ID> FAILED." 

AD9001B was graded passed by Test Modification as directed by the AVO. 
This test checks that no bodies are required for interfaced subprograms; 
among the procedures that it uses is one with a parameter of mode OUT 
(line 36). This inplementation does not support pragma INTERFACE for 
procedures with parameters of mode OUT. The test was modified by 
commenting out line 36 and 40; the modified test was passed.

Testing of this Ada implementation was conducted at the custOTier's site by 
a validation team from the AVF. 


3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming 
Language Standard, whether the test is applicable or inapplicable; 
otherwise, the Ada Implementation fails the ACVC [Pro90]. 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard. 

The list of items below gives the number of ACVC tests in various 
categories. All tests were processed, except those that were withdrawn 
because of test errors (item b; see section 2.1), those that require a 
floating-point precision that exceeds the implementation's maximum 
precision (item e; see section 2.2), and those that depend on the support 
of a file system — if none is supported (item d). All tests passed, 
except those that are listed in sections 2.1 and 2.2 (counted in items b 
and f, below).

3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were loaded onto a RDI Britelite ITX laptop and copied over 
Ethernet to the host computer. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host computer, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada in^lementation. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the customer and 
review^ by the validation team. See Appendix B for a complete listing of 
the processing options for this implementation. It also indicates the 
default options. The options invoked explicitly for validation testing 
during this test were: 


Option/Switch Effect

Test output, compiler and linker listings, and job logs were captured on 
magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site by 
the validation team were also archived.

CXJMPIIATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


The conpiler options of this Ada iiqplementation, as described in this 
/^ppendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to ccxnpiler documentation and 
not to this report. 


ada - invoke the Ada conpiler 
SYNTAX 

ada (options] (source_file]... (object_file.o}... 

DESCRIPTION 

Ihe coRinand ada executes the Ada compiler and compiles the 
named Ada source file, ending with the .a suffix. The file 
must reside in a VADS library directory. The ada.lib file in 
this directory is modified after each Ada unit is compiled. 

By default, ada produces only object and net files. If the 
-N option is used, the compiler automatically invokes a.Id 
and builds a complete program with the named library unit as 
the main program. 

NOn-Ada object files (.o files produced by a compiler for 
another language) may be given as arguments to ada. These 
files will be passed on to the linker and will be linked 
with the specified Ada object files. 

Command line options may be specified in any order, but the 
order of compilation Btnd the order of the files to be passed 
to the linker can be significant. 

Several VADS compilers may be simultaneously available on a 
single system. Because the ada command in any 
VADS location/bin on a system will execute the correct 
compiler components based upon visible library directives, 

B-1 





C0MPIIAT1C3N SYSTEM OPTIONS 


the option -sh is provided to print the name of the 
components actually executed. 

Program listings with a disassembly of machine code 
instructions are generated by a.db or a.das. 

OPTIONS 

-# identifier type value (define) Define an identifier of a 
specified type and value. See VADS ADA PREPBOCESSOR REFERENCE. 

-A (disassemble) disassemble the ijnits in the source file after compiling 
them. -A can be followed by arguments that further define the 
disassembly display (e.g. -Aa, -Ab, -Ad^ -Af, -Al/ -As): 

a add hexadecimal display of instruction bytes to disassembly 
listing 

b disassemble the vinit body [default] 
d print the data section (if present) as well 
f use the alternative format for output 

1 put the disassembly output in file "file_name.das" 

s disassemble the unit spec 

-a file_name (archive) Treat file_name as an object 
archive file created by ar. Since some archive files end 
with .a, -a is used to distinguish archive files from Ada 
source files. 

-DG (debug flag) Force frong end to write out the gnrx.lib 
file in ASCII format. To use this option, you must 
conpile a file that changes the gnrx.lib file. 

-d (dependencies) Analyze for dependencies only. Do not do 
semantic analysis or code generation. Update the library, 
mar)(ing any defined units as uncorapiled. The -d option is 
used by a.make to establish dependencies amcmg new files. 

-e (error) Process compilation error messages using a.error 
and send it to standard output. Only the source lines 
containing errors are listed. Only one -e or -E option 
should be used. 

-E 

-E file 

-E directory (error output) Without a file or directory 
argument, ada processes error messages using a.error and 
directs a brief output to standard output; the raw error 
messages are left in ada_source.err. If a file pathname is 
given, the raw error messages are placed in that file. If a 
directory argument is sujplied, the raw error output is 
placed in dir/source.err. The file of raw error messages can 
be used as input to a.error 

-el (error listing) Intersperse error messages among source 








COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


lines and direct to standard output. 


-El 

-El file 

-El directory (error listing) Same as the -E option, except 
that source listing with errors is produced. 

-ev (error vi(l)) Process syntax error messages using 
a.error, embed them in the source file, and call the 
environment editor EFROR_EDITOR. (If ERRQR_EDITQR is 
defined, the environment variable ERROR_PATTEBN should also 
be defined. ERROR_PATTEBN is an editor search command that 
locates the first occurrence of ’###' in the error file.) If 
no editor is specified, vi(l) is invoked. 

-K (keep) Keep the intermediate language (IL) file 
produced by the conpiler front end. The IL file will be 
placed in the .objects directory, with the file name 
Ada_source.i 

-L library_name (library) Operate in VADS library 
library_name [Default; current working directory) 

-lfile_abbreviation (library search) This is an option 
passed to the UNIX linker, ld(l) telling it to search the 
specified library file. (No space between the -1 aix3 the 
file abbreviation.) 

For a description of the file abbreviations, see also 
Operating system documentation, ld(l). 

-M unit_name (main) Produce an executable program by 
linking the named unit as the main program. unit_name must 
already be conpiled. It must be either a parameterless 
procedure or a parameterless function returning an integer. 

The executable program will be named a.out unless overridden 
with the -o option. 

-M source_file (main) Produce an executable program by 
compiling and linking source_file. The main unit of the 
program is assxnned to be the root name of the .a file (for 
foo.a the unit is foo). Only one .a file may be preceded by 
-N. The executable program will be named a.out (self-hosted) or 
a.vox (cross-development) unless overridden with the -o option. 

-o executable file (output) This option is to be used in 
conjunction with the -M option. executable_file is the name 
of the executable rather than the default a.out. 

-O[0-91 (optimize) Invoke the code optimizer. An optional digit 
(there is no space before the digit) provides the level of 
optimization. The default is -04. 

-O full optimization 

B-3 





CXJMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-OO prevents optimization 

-01 no hoisting 

-02 no hoisting but more passes 

-03 no hoisting but even more passes 

-04 hoisting from loops 

-05 hoisting fron loops but more passes (and instruction 
scheduling, if available) 

-06 hoisting from loops with maximum passes (and instruction 
scheduling, if available) 

-07 hoisting from loops and branches (and instruction) 
scheduling, if available) 

-08 hoisting frcnn loops and branches, more passes (and 
instruction scheduling, if available) 

-09 hoisting from loops and branches, maximum passes (and 
instruction scheduling, if available) 

Hoisting from bramches (and cases alternatives) can be slow 
euid does not always provide significant performeuice gains so 
it can be suppressed. 

For more information about optimization, see CC^ILING 
PROGRAMS, Con^iler Optimizations. See also pragma 
OPTIMIZE_CODE(OFF). 

-P Invoke the Ada Preprocessor. See VADS ADA PREPROCESSOR 
REFERENCE. 

-R VADS_library (recompile instantiation) Force analysis 
of all generic instantiations, causing reinstantiation of 
any that are out of date. 

-S (suppress) -^)ply pragma SUPPRESS to the entire 
compilation for all suppressible checks. (See also pragma 
SUPPRESS(ALL_CHECKS). 

-sh (show) Display the name of the tool executable tnit do 
not execute it. 

-T (timing) Print timing information for the coiqpilation. 

-V (verbose) Print conpiler version number, date and time 
of compilation, name of file conpiled, connand input line, 
total compilation time, and error sunanary line. Storage 
usage information about the object file is provided. 

-w (warnings) Suppress warning diagnostics. 

DIAGNOSTICS 

The diagnostics produced by the VADS compiler are intended 
to be self-explanatory. Most refer to the RM. Each RH 
reference includes a section number and optionally, a paragraph 
number enclosed in parentheses.

COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


LINKEM OPTIONS 

The linker options of this Ada iirplementation, as described in this 
;^pendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to linker documentation and not 
to this report. 


a.Id - prelinker 
SYNTAX 

a.Id [options] unit_name [ld_options) 

OPTIONS 

-DX (debug) Debug memory overflow (use in cases where 
linking a large nxjunber of tinits causes the error message 
local symbol overflow" to occur). 

-E unit name (elziborate) Elaborate unit_name as early in 
the elaEoration order as possible. 

-F (files) Print a list of dependent files in order and 
suppress linking. 

-L library_name (library) Operate in VADS library 
library_name (the current working directory is the default). 

-o executaible file (output) Use the specified file name as 
the name of tHe output rather than the default, a.out. 

-sh (show) Display the name of the tool executable but do 
not execute it. 

-U (units) Print a list of dependent units in order and 
suppress linking. 

-V (verbose) Print the linker command before executing it. 

-V (verify) Print the linker commemd but suppress 
execution. 

DESCRIPTION 

a.Id collects the object files needed to make unitjname a main 
program and calls the UNIX linker ld(l) to link together all Ada 
auid other lauiguage objects required to produce eui executcdDle image 
in a.out (self-hosted) or a.vox (cross- development). unit_naroe is 
the main program and must name a non-generic subprogram. If unit_naroe 
is a fiinction, it must return a value of the type STANDARD.INTEGER. 


B-5 






CX3MPILATI0N SYSTEM OPTIONS 


Hiis integer result will be passed back to the UNIX shell as the status 
code of the execution. The utility uses the net files produced by the Ada 
compiler to check dependency information, a.Id produces an exception 
mapping table and a unit elaboration table and passes this information 
to the linker. The elaboration list generated by a.Id does not include 
library level packages that do not need elaboration. In addition, 
packages that contain no code that can raise an exception will no longer 
have exception tables. 

a.Id reads instructions for generating executables from the ada.lib file 
in the VADS libraries on the search list. Besides information generated 
by the compiler, these directives also include WiTHn directives that 
allow the automatic linking of object modules compiled from other 
languages or Ada object monies not named in context clauses in the Ada 
source. Any number of WITHn directives may be placed into a library, but 
they must be numbered contiguously beginning at WITHl. The directives 
are recorded in the library's ada.lib file and have the following form. 

WITHl:LINK:object_file: 

WITH2:LINK:archive_f ile: 

WiTHn directives may be placed in the local Ada libraries or in any 
VADS library on the search list. 

A WiTHn directive in a local VADS library or earlier on the library 
search list will hide the same numbered WiTHn directive in a library 
later in the library search list. 

Use the tool a.info to change or report library directives in the 
current library. 

All arguments after unit_name are passed on to the linker. These may 
be options for it, archive libraries, library abbreviations, or 
object files. 

VADS_location/bin/a.ld is a wrapper program that executes the correct 
executable based upon directives visible in the ada.lib file. This 
permits multiple VADS compilers to exist on the same host. The -sh 
option prints the name of the actual executable file. 

DIAGNOSTICS 

Self-explanatory diagnostics are produced for missing files, 
etc. Additional messages are produced by the UNIX linker Id.

characteristics of this Ada implementation, as described in this Appendix, 
are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted otherwise, 
references in this Appendix are to compiler documentation e»nd not to this 
report. Inplementation-specific portions of the package STANDARD, which

end STANDARD; 


C-1 






APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


APPENDIX F. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


1. Inplementation-Dependent Pragmas 

1.1. lNLlNE_QNLy Pragma 

The INLINE_0NLY pragma, when used in the same way as pragma 
INLINE, indicates to the coitpiler that the s\ibprogram must 
always be inlined. Ihis pragma also suppresses the genera¬ 
tion of a calledsle version of the routine which saves code 
space. If a user erroneously makes an INLINE_0NLY subpro¬ 
gram recursive a warning message will be emitted emd an 
PROGRAM_ERROR will be raised at run time. 

1.2. BUILT_IN Pragma 

The BUILT IN pragma is used in the inplementation of some 
predefined Ada packages, but provides no user access. It is 
used only to implement code bodies for which no actual Ada 
body can be provided, for exanple the MACHINE_C0DE package. 

1.3. SHARE_CODE Pragma 

The SHABE_CODE pragma takes the name of a generic instantia¬ 
tion or a generic unit as the first argument and one of the 
identifiers TRUE or FALSE as the second argument. This 
pragma is only allowed immediately at the place of a 
declarative item in a declarative part or package specifica¬ 
tion, or after a library unit in a compilation, but before 
any subsequent compilation unit. 

When the first argument is a generic \jnit the pragma applies 
to all instantiations of that generic. When the first argu¬ 
ment is the name of a generic instantiation the pragma 
applies only to the specified instantiation, or overloaded 
insteuatiations. 

If the second argument is TRUE the conpiler will try to 
share code generated for a generic instantiation with code 
generated for other instantiations of the same generic. 
When the second argument is FALSE each instantiation will 
get a unique copy of the generated code. The extent to 
vdiich code is shared between instantiations depends on this 
pragma and the kind of generic formal parameters declared 
for the generic unit. 

The name pragma SHARE_BODY is also recognized by the imple¬ 
mentation and has the same effect as SHARE_CX)DE. It is 
included for compatability with earlier versions of VADS. 


C-2 







APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


1.4. N0_IMAGE Pragma 

The pragma suppresses the generation of the image array used 
for the IMAGE attribute of enumeration types. This elim¬ 
inates the overhead required to store the array in the exe¬ 
cutable image. An attempt to use the IMAGE attribute on a 
type whose image array has been suppressed will result in a 
compilation warning euid PROGRAM_ERROR raised at run time. 

1.5. EXTERNAL_NAME Pragma 

The EXTERNAL NAME pragma takes the name of a subprogram or 
variable defined in Ada and allows the user to specify a 
different external neune that may be used to reference the 
entity from other languages. The pragma is allowed at the 
place of a declarative item in a package specification and 
must apply to an object declared earlier in the same package 
specification. 

1.6. INTERFACE_NAME Pragma 

The INTERFACE_NAME pragma takes the name of a a varizdale or 
sxibprogram defined in another language and allows it to be 
referenced directly in Ada. The pragma will replace all 
occurrences of the variable or sudDprogram name with an 
external reference to the second, link_argument. The pragma 
is allowed at the place of a declarative item in a package 
specification and must apply to an object or subprogram 
declared earlier in the same package specification. The 
object must be declared as a scalar or an access type. The 
object cannot be any of the following: 
a loop variable, 
a constant, 

an initialized variable, 
an array, or 
a record. 

1.7. IMPLICIT_CODE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies that inplicit code generated by the 
compiler be allowed or disallowed. A warning is issued if 
OFF is used and any implicit code needs to be generated. 
The default is ON. 


1.8. OPTIMIZE_CODE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies whether the code should be optim- 


C-3 




APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


ized by the conpiler. The default is ON. When OFF is 
specified, the compiler will generate the code as specified. 

2. Inplementation of Predefined Pragmas 

2.1. CCKTROLLED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 

2.2. ELABORATE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RN. 

2.3. INLINE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.4. INTERFACE 

This pragma supports calls to 'C' and FORTRAN functions. The 
Ada sv±>programs Cein be either functions or procedures. The 
types of parameters and the result type for functions must 
be scalar, access or the predefined type ADDRESS in SYSTEM. 
All parameters must have mode IN. Record and array objects 
can be passed by reference using the ADDRESS attribute. 

2.5. LIST 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.6. MEMORY_SIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the inplementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.7. N(»I_REENTRANT 

This pragma takes one argument which can be the name of 
either a library subprogram or a subprogram declared immedi¬ 
ately within a library package spec or body. It indicates 
to the compiler that the subprogram will not be called 
recursively allowing the conpiler to perform specific optim¬ 
izations. The pragma can be applied to a subprogram or a 
set of overloaded subprograsm within a package spec or pack¬ 
age body. 

2.8. NOT ELABORATED 


C-4 






APPE^IX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


This pragma can only appear in a library package specifica¬ 
tion. It indicates that the package will not be elaborated 
because it is either part of the RTS, a configuration pack¬ 
age or cui Ada package that is referenced from a leuiguage 
other than Ada. The presence of this pragma suppresses the 
generation of elaboration code and issues warnings if ela¬ 
boration code is required. 

2.9. OPTIMIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the inplementation but has no 
effect. 

2.10. PACK 

This pragma will cause the compiler to choose a non-aligned 
representation for composite types. It will not causes 
objects to be packed at the bit level. 

2.11. PAGE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 


2.12. PASSIVE 

The pragma has three forms ; 

PRAOIA PASSIVE; 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(SEMAPHORE); 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(INTERRUPT, <number>); 


This pragma Pragma passive can be applied to a task or task 
type declared immediately within a library package spec or 
bo^. The pragma directs the compiler to optimiize certain 
tasking operations. It is possible that the statements in a 
task body will prevent the intended optimdzation, in these 
cases a warning will be generated at ccanpile time and will 
raise TASKING_ERROR at runtime. 

2.13. PRIORITY 

This pragma is implemented as described in /ppendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.14. SHARED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 


2,15. STORAGE UNIT 


C-5 







APPEM)IX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


This pragma is recognized by the inplementation. The inple- 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.16. SUPPRESS 

This pragma is iiq>lemented as described, except that 
DlVISlca^ CHECK and in some cases OVERFLOW_CHECK cannot be 
supressed.

pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be reconciled. 

3. Implementation-Dependent Attributes 

3.1. P'REF 

For a prefix that denotes an object, a program unit, a 
label, or an entry: 

This attribute denotes the effective address of the first of 
the storage units allocated to P. For a sxabprogram, pack¬ 
age, task unit, or label, it refers to the address of the 
machine code associated with the corresponding body or 
statement. For an entry for v^ich an address clause has 
been given, it refers to the corresponding hardware inter¬ 
rupt. The attribute is of the type OPERAND defined in the 
package MACHINE_CODE. The attribute is only allowed within 
a machine code procedure. 

See section F.4.8 for more information on the use of this 
attribute. 

(For a package, task unit, or entry, the 'REF attribute is 
not supported.) 


3.2. T'TASKID 

For a task object or a value T, T'TASK_ID yields the unique 
task id associated with a task. The value of this attribute 
is of the type ADDRESS in the package SYSTEM.

5. Restrictions On Representation Clauses 
5.1. Pragma PACK 

In the absence of pragma PACK record conponents are padded 
so as to provide for efficient access by the target

APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


hardware, pragpma PACK applied to a record eliminate the pad¬ 
ding where possible. Pragma PACK has no other effect on the 
storage allocated for record components a record representa¬ 
tion is required. 

5.2. Size Clauses 

For scalar types a representation clause will pack co the 
number of bits required to represent the range of the siib- 
type. A size clause applied to a record type will not cause 
packing of components; an explicit record representation 
clause must be given to specify the packing of the com¬ 
ponents. A size clause applied to a record type will cause 
packing of components only vrtien the component type is a 
discrete type. An error will be issued if there is insuffi¬ 
cient space allocated. The SIZE attribute is not supported 
for task, access, or floating point types. 


5.3. Address Clauses 

Address clauses are only supported for variedsles. Since 
default initialization of a variadale requires evaluation of 
the variable address el 2 ±K}ration ordering requirements 
prohibit inititalization of a variadsles which have address 
clauses. The specified address indicates the physical 
address associated with the variable. 

5.4. Interrupts 

Interupt entries are not supported. 

5.5. Representation Attributes 

The ADDRESS attribute is not supported for the following 
entities; 

Packages 

Tasks 

Labels 

Entries 


5.6. Machine Code Insertions 
Machine code insertions are supported. 

The general definition of the package MACHINE_CC»E provides 
an assembly language interface for the target machine. It 
provides the necessary record type(s) needed in the code 
statement, an enumeration type of all the opcode mneumonics, 
a set of register definitions, and a set of addressing mode 
functions. 


C-9 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


The general syntax of a machine code statement is as fol¬ 
lows: 


CODE_n'( opcode, operand {, operand) ); 

where n indicates the number of operands in the aggregate. 

A special case arises for a variable number of operands. 
The operands are listed within a sxibaggregate. The format 
is as follows: 

C(X>E_N'( opcode, (operand {, operand}) ); 

For those opcodes that require no operemds, named notation 
must be used (cf. RM 4.3(4)). 

CODE_0'( op “> opcode ); 

The opcode must be ein enumeration literal (i.e. it czuinot be 
an object, attribute, or a rename). 

An operand can only be cin entity defined in MACHINE_C(X>E or 
the 'REF attribute. 

The arguments to any of the functions defined in 
MAC3IINE_C0DE must be static expressions, string literals, or 
the functions defined in MACHINE_CX)DE. The 'REF attribute 
may not be used as an argument in any of these functions. 

Inline expansion of machine code procedures is supported. 

6. Conventions for Implementation-generated Names 
There are no implementation-generated names. 

7. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clauses 

Address expressions in an address clause are interpreted as 
physical addresses. 

8. Restrictions on Unchecked Conversions 
None. 

9. Restrictions on Unchecked Deallocations 
None. 


10. inplementation Characteristics of I/O Packages 

Instantiations of DIRECT_IO use the value MAX REC_SIZE as 
the record size (expressed in STORAGE_UNITS) ^en the size 


C-10 







APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


of ELEMENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For example for uncon¬ 
strained arrays such as string vAiere ELEMENT_TYPE'SIZE is 
very large, MAX_REC_SI2E is used instead. MAX_RECORD_SIZE 
is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a program before 
instantiating DIRECT_IO to provide an upper limit on the 
record size. In any case the maximum size supported is 1024 
X 1024 X STORAGE_UNIT bits. D1RECT_I0 will raise USE_ERFOR 
if NAX_REC_SIZE exceeds this absolute limit. 

Insteuitiations of SEQUENTIAL_I0 use the value MAX_REC_SIZE 
as the record size (expressed in STORAGE_UNITS) v^en the 
size of ELEMENT_TyPE exceeds that value. For example for 
unconstrained arrays such as string where ELEMENT_TYPE'SIZE 
is very large, MAX REC_SIZE is used instead. 
MAX_RECORD SIZE is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a 
program beTore instantiating INTEGER_IO to provide an upper 
limit on the record size. SEC3UE3^IAL_IO imposes no limit on 
MAX_REC_SIZE. 

11. Implementation Limits 

The following limits are actually enforced by the implemen¬ 
tation. It is not intended to in 5 )ly that resources up to or 
even near these limits are availeible to every program. 

11.1. Line Length 

The implementation supports a maximum line length of 500 
characters including the end of line character. 

11.2. Record and Array Sizes 

The meucimum size of a statically sized array type is 
4,000,000 X STORAGE_UNITS. Ihe maximum size of a statically 
sized record type is 4,000,000 x STORAGE_UNITS. A record 
type or array type declaration that exceeds these limits 
will generate a warning message. 

11.3. Default Stack Size for Tasks 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGE_SIZE length specifica¬ 
tion every task except the main program is allocated a fixed 
size stack of 10,240 STORAGEJUNITS. This is the value 
returned by T'STORAGE_SIZE for a task type T. 

11.4. Default Collection Size 

In the absence of an explicit ST0RAGE_SI2E length attribute 
the default collection size for an access type is 100 times 
the size of the designated type. This is the value returned 
by T'STORAGE_SIZE for an access type T. 

11.5. Limit on Declared Objects 


C-11 






\ 

APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


There is an absolute limit of 6,000,000 x STORAGE_UNITS for 
objects declared statically within a compilation unit. If 
this value is exceeded the compiler will terminate the com¬ 
pilation of the unit with a FATAL error message.
