User Guide for MINT ACS SeeTrack Exchange 

(MINSTE) 


Executive Summary 


The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) currently uses the Mine Warfare Tactical Command 
Software (MINTACS) Release 12 for Mine Countermeasures (MCM) mission planning and 
assessment. Recent MCM exercises are investigating the deployment of underwater 
unmanned vehicles (UUV) for route surveys. The route survey process has a post-processing 
stage in which the unmanned system's side scan sonar records are reviewed for contacts of 
interest. SeeTrack is one software application currently used for this post-processing stage. 
SeeTrack is a 'generic' UUV mission planning and battle space visualisation tool that acts as a 
viewer and software analysis tool for side scan sonar imagery. Mine-like contacts detected 
during post-mission analysis conducted with SeeTrack or similar applications can be 
imported into MINTACS for force-level mission assessments and battle-space visualisation. 
However, the current release of MINTACS only allows manual entry of contact data by the 
operator, much of which must first be converted into compatible dimensional units, chart 
datum and date/time formats. This tedious, time-consuming process is prone to error, and 
can ultimately prove unworkable in light of current concepts of operation for unmanned 
systems, which dictate the reporting of all suspicious contacts; in previous exercises, these 
reports are known to be in the hundreds. Clearly, in this circumstance, operator overheads can 
be substantially reduced by automating some aspects of contact reporting. 

The software program MINTACS SeeTrack Exchange (MINSTE) was developed as a concept 
demonstrator to test and evaluate requirements for automation of data exchange between 
MCM mission planners. 

MINSTE is designed to transfer contact data from SeeTrack to MINTACS in a sequence of 
three steps: 

• Step 1: Selected mission and associated contact data from the SeeTrack database is 
converted to an XML document. 

• Step 2: Contact data from the XML document is then imported into the MINTACS Route 
Survey Database (RSDB) and displayed as an Unclassified Sonar Contact (USC 1 ) type in 
the MINTACS Operational Area Manager. 


1 USC classification is assigned as contact type so to align with MINTACS R13 Additional Military 
Layer (AML) import procedure. MINTACS R13 imports AML Small Bottom Object products and 
assigns these contacts with USC contact classification. 



• Step 3: Contacts stored in the RSDB may be promoted to actual or suspected mines - 
features that are stored as mine objects in the MINTACS Tactical Display Manager. 
MINTACS Release 12 requires tactical features to be entered manually. MINSTE 
automates transfer between the RSDB and tactical database, and provides data filtering 
functionality to assist with proper selection of contacts. 

This report is the operator's guide for MINSTE. It is intended that the MINSTE application 
and this guide should be used together. The guide provides detailed descriptions of all the 
features of MINSTE, including description of how the data is used within MINTACS once it 
has been imported. 

An accompanying CDROM is attached to end of this report containing the described software 
and DSTO-GD-0574: Design and Evaluation of the MINTACS SeeTrack Exchange (MINSTE) 
Concept Demonstrator.

1. Introduction 


The MIN T ACS SeeTrack Exchange (MINSTE) assists in the automatic transfer of contact data 
between software used for post mission analysis (PMA) of side scan imagery and the tactical 
decision aid MINTACS. This release of MINSTE supports data transfer between SeeByte's 
SeeTrack software and MINTACS only. 

The data transfer is conducted in two steps. The software exports a selected mission and its 
contacts from the SeeTrack database and saves this data to an XML file. This XML file can then 
be imported into the MINTACS Route Survey Database (RSDB) and so appear as a contact 
feature in the MINTACS Operational Area Manager. 

In addition, the MINSTE tool also supports the selection of a contact from the MINTACS 
RSDB and its promotion to a mine object in the MINTACS Tactical Display (and therefore, 
importation into the MINTACS database). 

Developer notes for the MINSTE application are attached as Appendix B.

DSTO-TN-0887 


2. Context 


2.1 MINTACS 

MINSTE is compatible with Release 12 of the Mine Warfare Tactical Command Software 
(MINTACS) 2 , developed under Project SEA 1297 - The Mine Warfare Command Support 
System (MWCSS) for Mine Countermeasures mission planning and assessment. MINTACS 
Release 12 is currently in use by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The next release of 
MINTACS will provide some support for the automatic transfer of contact data by the 
importation of Additional Military Layer (AML) 3 files. It is anticipated that MINTACS Release 
13 will be rolled out on the Defence Secret Network (DSN) during the first quarter of 2009. 

2.2 SeeTrack Military 

SeeTrack 4 is a "generic" Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) mission planning and battle 
space visualisation tool. It acts as a viewer and analysis software for side scan sonar imagery 
(*.mst, *jsf and *.xtf files) and allows data to be exported in HTML, AML and ESRI shapefiles. 

2.3 XML 

The Extensible Markup Language (XML) 5 is a general-purpose specification for creating a 
custom markup language. It is classified as an extensible language because it allows users to 
define their own elements. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the sharing of structured data 
across different information systems. It is a fee-free open standard.

3. MINSTE Overview 


3.1 MINSTE Concept 

The MINSTE application is a means of moving data from the SeeTrack database to and 
between the MINT ACS databases. MINSTE only communicates with the SeeTrack application 
database and / or the MINTACS application databases. 



Figure 1: A high-level view of the MINSTE application and the databases with which it communicates 


3.2 Functionality 

MINSTE Release 1 provides functionality to: 

1. Export contact data from the SeeTrack database to a XML file. 

2. Import the XML file into the MINTACS Route Survey Database. 

3. Promote a contact in MINTACS to a tactical mine object. 


3 





















































DSTO-TN-0887 


Figures 2 and 3 detail how MINSTE interacts with the databases to provide its current 
functionality. 



Figure 2: Diagram detailing MINSTE functionality. MINSTE communicates with the SeeTrack 
database to export Mission and Contact data to an XML file. MINSTE reads the XML file 
and creates the appropriate data format to then import into the MINTACS Route Survey 
Database (RSDB), named MINTACS_MWDS. The contact data imported into 
MINTACS_MWDS will then be displayed in the MINTACS Operation Area Manager. 



Figure 3: Diagram detailing MINSTE functionality. MINSTE communicates with the MINTACS 
RSDB, named MINTACS_MWDS, to retrieve contact data to display to the user. The user 
is then able to select the contact to promote to be a Tactical Mine Object. MINSTE will 
format contact data into the correct data format to be imported into the MINTACS 
database, and be displayed as a mine object in the MINTACS Tactical Display.

DSTO-TN-0887 


3.3 Graphical User Interface (GUI) 

MINSTE was designed with a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) with each function and 
database configuration available from a main window. The GUI provides self-explanatory 
directions and requirements. This is achieved by controlling user input or selection by 
enabling/ disabling functionality as the user proceeds with its use. Each function is managed 
through a series of windows displayed to the user as they proceed through the selected task. 



Figure 4: The main window of the MINSTE application. This window controls access to the program's 
functionality. Each function is only enabled when the database configuration has been 
established correctly. To set-up the database configuration the user selects the 'Configure 
SeeTrack Database' or 'Configure MINTACS Database' button (refer to Section 6.6: 
Configure Database Connection). In this window only the SeeTrack database has been 
configured, thus enabling the SeeTrack Interface function. 


Once the databases are configured correctly the functionality will be enabled.

DSTO-TN-0887 


3.4 Data 

3.4.1 MINT ACS Databases 

MINT ACS uses Microsoft (MS) SQL Server 2000 / MS SQL Server 7 to store its persistent data. 

The SQL Server used by MINTACS contains four databases for its persistent data : : 

• MINTACS: - primary database and stores the elements relating to the main functions of 
the MINTACS Tactical Display Manager. 

• MINTACS_MWDS: - is the information repository for all route survey related data and 
supports capabilities within the MINTACS Operation Area Manager. 

• MCD_GAMING:- contains the information about the games generated by the Mine 
Warfare and Clearance Diving (MCD) Gaming components of MINTACS. 

• MHCDATA: - the Mine Hunter Coastal (MHC) Data database contains the raw 
information coming from the Australian Huon-class Tactical Data System (TDS) 6 . 

The MINTACS databases are separated into four databases for the following reasons: 7 

• A separate MINTACS_RSDB provides the capability to install a potentially large database 
of environment and contact data on a separate database disk and / or server. As well, it 
provides the ability to build a separate environmental data management application 
without the need for the associated MINTACS operational capability. 

• A separate MHCDATA database allows for configuration capability and maintenance of a 
potentially large database. 

• A separate MCD_GAMING database was a user requirement to enable the building of 
other applications using the gaming capability without the need for a full installation of 
MINTACS databases. 

MINSTE uses only the MINTACS and MINTACS_MWDS databases. 

3.4.2 SeeTrack Database 

SeeTrack uses a Microsoft Access database to store its persistent data. 


6 The TDS name is NAUTIS.

DSTO-TN-0887 


3.4.3 XML Schema 

The XML schema used for this version of MINSTE is provided as Appendix A. The schema 
elements are in the following format: 

Mission 

o Mission Name (string) 
o Mission Description (string) 

■ Contact (object list) 

• Contact Id (integer) 

• Latitude (double) 

• Longitude (double) 

• Width (double) 

• Length (double) 

• Height (double) 

• Data/Time Find Time (date/time) 


3.4.4 Properties File 

Database settings are stored in a properties file (MINSTE.properties). This properties file is 
stored in the same directory as the MINSTE application (MINSTE.jar). Program run-time 
errors will occur if the properties file location and content are changed. 

3.4.5 Hard-coded Data 

The following data is currently hard-coded into the source code. Future release of MINSTE 
will allow for the values to be entered by the user. 

Contact Label: - the label format for a contact that is imported into MINTACS is: 

Unique generated sequence number_SeeTrack Contact Id_SeeTrack Mission Name 

Mine Reference Number: - when promoting a contact to a mine object the user defined reference 
number is appended with the selected asset call sign. 

Error Ellipse: - the default values of the error ellipse assigned to each contact when imported 
into MINTACS are as follows: 

Bearing = 350 
Major Axis = 10 
Minor Axis = 10 

Contact Classification: - the default value of the contact classification is Unclassified Sonar 
Contact (USC). 

Once the data has been imported into the MINTACS databases some values for the hard¬ 
coded data may be changed within the MINTACS application. All the contacts are displayed 
by the Operational Area Manager: Manage Environmental Data functionality (accessed by 


7 




DSTO-TN-0887 


MWDCM -> Manage Environmental Data). Each contact's property can be accessed by 
selecting the contact and clicking Modify. 

The following contact data can be changed: 

• Contact Classification: - this value can be modified in MINTACS through the Contact 
Feature Properties dialog box and selecting contact classification from the values available 
in the drop-down box. 

• Error Ellipse: - select the Error Ellipse tab in the Contact Feature Properties dialog box and 
change the values for the error ellipse as required. 

The Contact Label and Mine Reference Number cannot be changed.

DSTO-TN-0887 


4. MINSTE Development 8 

MINSTE is a Java 9 based software tool that writes out and reads in data in XML format. The 
interface was developed using the Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) and so allows 
for highly portable XML data to be joined to a highly portable Java application resulting in a 
lightweight flexible application. 

The XML schema used in a JAXB 10 implementation uses XML syntax to describe the 
relationships that must be adhered to, a set of structural rules and data constraints. The XML 
schema used by MINSTE defines a 'Mission' with its attributes and a collection of 'Contacts'. 

The MINSTE application is a concept demonstrator application developed only to enable the 
transfer of data, using XML, between the MINTACS database and SeeTrack database. The 
purpose of its development is not to duplicate any functionality of MINTACS and SeeTrack, 
rather, it is a way of moving data between the databases that these applications use. 

Provided as attached appendices are the following software developer notes: 

• Appendix A contains the XML schema used by MINSTE, 

• Appendix B provides supporting software developer notes, 

• Appendix C includes a schematic class diagram for the MINSTE application. 


8 Refer to Irwin, A. (2009) Design and Evaluation of the MINTACS SeeTrack Exchange (MINSTE) Concept 
Demonstrator, DSTO-GD-0574, for more information on the operational context and drivers for MINSTE 
development.

6. Installing and Running MINSTE 

6.1 Security Considerations 

MINSTE is unclassified, however, it is important to realise that the data used or the XML files 
handled by the MINSTE application may have a security classification associated with it. 

6.2 System Requirements 

MINSTE can be installed on any desktop computer that is capable of supporting the Java run¬ 
time environment (JRE). The application was developed for use on MS Windows platforms. 

MINSTE does not need to be installed where the SeeTrack application is installed. It only 
requires access to the SeeTrack MS Access database. 

MINSTE does not need to be installed where the MINTACS application is installed. It only 
requires access to the MS SQL Server 2000 used by the MINTACS R12 application. 

Installing and running MINTSE requires: 

a. The installation of the JRE by running jre-6u5-windows-j586-p.exe 

b. The installation of MINSTE by running MINSTEsetup.exe 

c. Configure the database connection for MS SQL Server 2000 and / or MS Access. 

6.3 Installing Java Run-time Environment 

As for all Java based applications, MINSTE requires the JRE to run. In particular, it requires 
version 6 to execute. 

If version 6 of the JRE is not installed runjre-6u5-windows-j586-p.exe, this is included with the 
MINSTE installation CD-ROM. It is also possible to download JRE version 6 from 
http://www.iava.com/en/download/manual.isp . 

Installation of the JRE is as follows: 

1. Insert the MINTACS_interface installation CD into the CD ROM drive. 

2. Locate the file jre\jre-6u5-windows-j586-p.exe. 

3. Open the file jre-6u5-windows-j586-p.exe. 

4. Follow the prompts. 

a. Accept the license agreement 

b. Installation will be conducted automatically. A message dialog appears to inform 
when the installation is complete. 

6.4 Installing MINSTE 

The MINSTE application needs to be installed so that it can access the SeeTrack MS Access 
database and / or the MINTACS databases. Installation configurations can be as follows:

7. Using MINSTE 

This section provides an overview of using MINSTE. 

MINSTE is divided up into two sections. One section is the SeeTrack INTERFACE. This 
provides the functionality to interface with the SeeTrack database. The second section, 
MINTACS INTERFACE, provides the functionality available to interface with MINTACS R12. 

MINSTE is used to interface with the SeeTrack MS Access database and the MINTACS R12 
MS SQL Server 2000 databases. Elowever, a user may need to use only one part of the 
interface, to either use the SeeTrack Interface functionality or the MINTACS Interface 
functionality. It is therefore possible to set-up the main window to filter out unnecessary 
functionality. 



To display all the functionality, select Display both interfaces. 


17 




















DSTO-TN-0887 


By selecting Display MINTACS INTERFACE only, the user can set up the main display with 
the MINTACS Interface functions. 



By selecting Display SEETRACK INTERFACE only, the user can set up the main display with 
the SeeTrack Interface functions. 



On start-up of a newly installed MINSTE application both interfaces will be displayed. The 
user can set up the display of the main window to their preferred setting and this setting will 
then be saved.

DSTO-TN-0887 


To enable MINSTE functionality to be available each database used by MINSTE must be 
configured correctly. The settings are saved so this configuration needs only to be done once. 
Refer to 6.6 Configure Database Connections. 

The most likely situation for the use of this software is that it will be run on two computers 
and used for two differing functions. 

PMA will be conducted by the SeeTrack software and so MINSTE will need to be installed on 
the computer which is running SeeTrack. To transfer the contact data identified and stored in 
the SeeTrack database the user will select Export XML from SeeTrack Database to export the 
required data to an XML file. 

Another instance of MINSTE will also need to be installed on the computer running 
MINTACS R12. To continue the data exchange the XML file exported from the SeeTrack 
database (or one previously exported from the SeeTrack database by MINSTE) will then be 
imported into the MINTACS RSDB by selecting Import XML Contact Data to MINTACS. The 
contacts will then be displayed by the MINTACS Operational Area Manager (OAM). 

To further assist in the management of the data being stored in MINTACS an additional 
feature was developed to promote a contact currently stored in the MINTACS RSDB and 
displayed in the OAM to being a mine object in the Tactical Display and stored as a new entity 
in the MINTACS database. This function is activated by selecting Promote Contact to Tactical 
Mine Object.

Appendix B: Developer Notes 


B.l. Workaround for MINSTE and MS SQL Server 7 Connection 

If MINSTE is required to connect to an instance of MINTACS using MS SQL Server 7 then 
changes to the source code are needed and a connection to the database established by 
creating an ODBC Bridge to a MS Access database where the tables from the MS SQL 
Server 7 databases have been imported into. 

B.1.1 Source Code Changes 

The following source code changes are required: 

• Change MINTacsRSDataHandler to extend MSAccessDataHandler 

• Change MINTacsDataHandler to extend MSAcessDataHandler 

• Remove local initConnection () method in MINTacsRSDataHandler and 
MINTacsDataHandler and invoke the parent initConnection () method in 
MSAccessDataHandler. 

• Add new constructors: 

public MINTacsRSDataHandler(Properties properties) { 
super (); 

dbq = properties.getProperty("MINTACS RSDB.filePath"); 

URL = URL1 + dbq + URL2; 

} 

public MINTacsDataHandler(Properties properties) { 
super (); 

dbq = properties.getProperty("MINTACS DB.filePath"); 

URL = URL1 + dbq + URL2; 

} 

• Change all the table names in the SQL queries from TABLENAME to dbo TABLENAME. This 
change needs to be implemented in: 

o MINSTE.datahandler.mintacsDB.MINTacsDataHandler 
o MINSTE.function,mintacs_xml xt.MINTacsRSD_XML Import 
o MINSTE.function.mintacs_contact promote.MINTacsDBContact E 
xport 

• Ensure the following property file configuration is implemented in the 

MINTACS .properties file: 

o MINTACS_DB.filepath= 
o MINTACS_DB.configured=false 
o MINTACS_RSDB.filepath= 
o MINTACS_RSDB.configure=false 


38 



DSTO-TN-0887 


• In MINSTE . function. control. FunctionSelectionPanel remove the following 
source code: 

public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { 


else if 

(e.getActionCommand().equalsIgnoreCase(configureMINTACSAction)) 
{ 

new ConfigureSQLServerSettings(this,properties); 

} 


And implement the source code below: 

public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { 


else if 

(e.getActionCommand().equalsIgnoreCase(configureMINTACSAction)) 
{ 

new ConfigureMINTACSDatabasePanel(this,properties); 

} 


B.1.2 Create ODBC Bridge to Connect MINSTE and MINTACS using MS SQL 
Server 7. 

For MINSTE to connect to the MINTACS database MS SQL Server 7 an ODBC bridge needs to 
be established between MS Access database and MS SQL Server 7. 

The user must establish two bridges one for MINTACS Tactical database, named MINTACS, 
and the other to the MINTACS Route Survey database, named MINTAC_MWDS. Once the 
bridge is established a new MS Access database must be created for the database MINTACS 
and MINTACS_MWDS. The MS Access database can then import the tables; any changes then 
made to the data in MS Access is automatically updated to the databases stored in MS SQL 
Server 7. 


39 



DSTO-TN-0887 


The instructions are as follows 11 : 

Create an ODBC 

1. Go to the system's Control Panel 

2. Select Administrative Tools 

3. Select Data Sources (ODBC) 

4. Select tab System DSN 

5. Select Add 

6. Select SQL Server as the driver in which a data source is required 

7. Select Finish 

This will generate a wizard for creating a new data source to SQL Server. 

Create a New Data Source to SQL Server (to MINTACS database) 

8. Enter MINTACS in the Name text field 

9. Enter Bridge to MINTACS database in the Description text field 

10. Enter in the Server text field 

11. Select Next 

12. SQL Server should verify the authenticity of the login ID; select 'With Windows NT 
authentication using the network login ID'. 

13. Select Connect to SQL Server to obtain default settings for the additional 
configuration options. 

14. Select Next 

15. Select Change the default database to: 

16. Select MINTACS 

17. Select Use ANSI quoted identifiers 

18. Select use ANSI nulls, paddings and warnings 

19. Select Next 

20. Accept default setting for this panel. 

21. Select Finish 

22. A window with the SQL Server configuration will be displayed. Select Test Data 
Source to ensure configuration is correct. If test is completed successfully select OK. If 
test is not successful revisit configuration setup by selecting Back. 

Follow step 5 through to step 7 to create a new data source to SQL Server. 

Create a New Data Source to SQL Server (to MINTACS_MWDS database) 

23. Enter MINTACS RSDB in the Name text field 

24. Enter Bridge to MINTACS RSDB in the Description text field 

25. Enter '.'in the Server text field 

26. Select Next 


11 The instructions are based on the operator using a MS Windows XP Professional operating system 
and MS Access 2003. While it is not anticipated for the operator to have any difficulty implementing the 
given procedure if using other MS versions there is instruction on the internet to create ODBC bridges 
and MS Access functionality. 


40 



DSTO-TN-0887 


27. SQL Server should verify the authenticity of the login ID; select 'With Windows NT 
authentication using the network login ID'. 

28. Select Connect to SQL Server to obtain default settings for the additional 
configuration options. 

29. Select Next 

30. Select Change the default database to: 

31. Select MINTACS_MWDS 

32. Select Use ANSI quoted identifiers 

33. Select use ANSI nulls, paddings and warnings 

34. Select Next 

35. Accept default setting for this panel. 

36. Select Finish 

37. A window with the SQL Server configuration will be displayed. Select Test Data 
Source to ensure configuration is correct. If test is completed successfully select OK. If 
test is not successful revisit configuration setup by selecting Back. 

For the ODBC Data Source Administrator; create a new MS Access database for each 

database an ODBC bridge was created for. 

38. Open MS Access 

39. Select File and New Blank Database 

40. Name the database and save to user defined directory. It is suggested that the 
databases should be named after the databases stored on MS SQL Server. That is, the 
new databases saved as MINTACS.mdb and MINTAC_MWDS.mdb. 

Import MINTACS tables into MS Access database: 

41. Select File 

42. Select Get External Data 

43. Select Link Tables 

44. Scroll down Files of type and select ODBC Databases () 

45. Select Machine Data Source

49. Select OK 

50. A table's unique record identifier may be requested. Select the first column name in the 
list (would usually be identified with ID in the column name) OR ignore by selecting 
OK. 

51. The tables in MS Access need to be labelled dbo_TABLENAME, for example, 
dbo_WAYPTLEG or dbo_CONTACT. This should be done automatically as part of this 
procedure. 

Import MINTACS_MWDS tables into MS Access database: 

52. Select File 

53. Select Get External Data 

54. Select Link Tables 


41

list (would usually be identified with ID in the column name) OR ignore by selecting 
OK. 

62. The tables in MS Access need to be labelled dbo_TABLENAME, for example, 
dbo_CONTACT. This should be done automatically as part of this procedure. 

If any of the MS Access databases created are deleted the ODBC bridge does not need to be re¬ 
established. 

When configuring the MINTACS databases within MINSTE select the two MS Access 

databases created during this process.

19. ABSTRACT 

The computer program MINTACS SeeTrack Exchange (MINSTE) interface was developed to support the 
automated data transfer to the RAN Mine Warfare Tactical Decision Aid MINTACS from SeeTrack, a post¬ 
mission analysis tool for data collected by towed or self-propelled (unmanned) side-scan sonar systems in 
support of military operations such as reconnaissance of sea routes for detection of mine-like objects. This 
document is a detailed technical user manual for the MINSTE software program. For a general overview of 
MINSTE design principles and objectives, the reader is referred to DSTO-GD-0574, "Design and Evaluation of 
the MINTACS SeeTrack Exchange (MINSTE) Concept Demonstrator".
