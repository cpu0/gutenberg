Contemporary astronomy is characterized by increasingly complex instruments and observa- 
tional techniques, higher data collection rates, and large data archives, placing severe stress 
on software analysis systems. The object-oriented paradigm represents a significant new ap- 
proach to software design and implementation that holds great promise for dealing with this 
increased complexity. The basic concepts of this approach will be characterized in contrast to 
more traditional procedure-oriented approaches. The fundamental features of objected-oriented 
programming will be discussed from a C++ programming language perspective, using examples 
familiar to astronomers. This discussion will focus on objects, classes and their relevance to the 
data type system; the principle of information hiding; and the use of inheritance to implement 
generalization/specialization relationships. Drawing on the object-oriented approach, features 
of a new database model to support astronomical data analysis will be presented.
