1. Description of Tasks 


The tasks of the contract were as follows: 

Problem I: Extraction and Representation of Semantic Information based on Word 
Associations 

Recent results in the literature indicate that synonyms and associative maps amongst 
words form scale-free small world (SSW) structure. Traditional graph representations 
seem to be inefficient to visualize scale free structures. Efficient representation is to be 
developed by using coordination numbers (the number of incoming and/or outgoing 
connections) at different scales. The program will be written in C++, visualization map 
editor and map viewer software will be provided in JAVA. 

Problem II: Semantic relations amongst medical documents 

Clustering of different medical sites, like American Heart Organization will be 
analyzed using SSW similarity measures. These studies will focus on the different 
parameterization and the optimal representation for humans. It is assumed - according 
to psychological results - that the optimal representation has 7 ± 2 nodes on each 
“screen” of the map. Additional maps will be developed by traditional factorization 
methods. Medical experts will judge - without knowing the algorithm - which type of 
information is better. These studies will be conducted by asking the expert to use the 
maps and measuring the time they need to find the information. 

Problem I is a technology development. It was fully accomplished. The goal of Problem II 
was to measure the usefulness of the technology. During the course of the study, it was found 
that yes, the navigation on the maps is much easier. These maps can be studied at the 
following site: http://www.coraler.com/ (username: coraler, password: qwerty) 

There are different maps to demonstrate the principle. For example, one map is about the 
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), another one is about American Heart 
Association (AHA). 

During the course of this SSW study, we found that the synonyms and the hypemyms barely 
help in grouping/clustering the information. Given that this direction is a crucial point in our 
future plans, I have added extra manpower to this work and we have executed additional 
research - not supported by the USAF project. This modification was necessary to have 
confidence in our IRI project. This additional project is referred as a pre-study below. In this 
pre-study automated keyword and key-phrase extraction methods were implemented. That 
allowed us to better characterize the maps. Now, there are two types maps that can be viewed 
on the site www.coraler.com : Some maps are without keywords, others have keywords. The 
AHA site has keywords and key-phrases. The WIPO site does not. The WIPO map, which has 
keywords and key-phrases was developed using the knowledge gained on the AHA site. One 
can view this as a description of the WIPO site using the knowledge gained on the AHA site. 

Problem II was modified to a pre-study. 

The question of this pre-study was, 

• which clustering 

• which key-phrase extraction 


4 







is the best on the different databases to select pages of interest. Is there a winning algorithm, 
or combination of algorithms are needed for fusing human and robotic intelligence. 

Two basic methods were tried: 

• FAQ and Answer 

Words of frequently asked questions and their hypernyms were chosen by 
known techniques getting rid of frequent words such as 'the' 'a', etc. Searches 
for pages with similar words were executed. It was studied, how well the words 
of the found pages matched the words of the answers belonging to the 
respective FAQs. 

■ evaluations were executed with and without hypernyms 

■ different databases were studied 

This was a brute-force study to establish ‘expert - non-expert dictionary’ (EnE 
dictionary). The overall result is that hypernyms by themselves might help. In 
most cases, however, our methodology can be questioned because both FAQs 
and answers were written in similar style. The set of hypernyms provided by 
Word Association is for general use and does not have the appropriate 
synonyms on novel technical — medical fields. Different approach is needed to 
develop ‘expert - non-expert dictionary’ dictionaries. There are novel 
algorithms making use of Internet documents, which can be used to replace 
hand made collections of hypernyms and which are up-to-date. Such methods 
need to be investigated. 

• Clustering and Keywords 

Different clustering and different key phrase extraction methods were used to 
find words in each database, which are representative for the clusters. In other 
words, different clustering methods were evaluated on the basis if the 
clustering was - up to some extent - topic dependent. It was found that by all 
means, Page Rank is not appropriate for such clustering; directed clustering 
methods produced much better results. 

First, a short summary is given. This summary is followed by detailed description of the 
motivations. Overview of the results is provided in the Section 4. Details of the algorithms, 
software codes, results are provided in the Appendices:

(A) Literature in html fonn 

(B) Manuscript of a parallel project on link-highlighting, a direct human-computer 
interaction.

reinforcement based human-computer interaction and scale-free representations 
together can be very efficient. Moreover, it demonstrates that work-sharing amongst 
reinforcement learning agents can be achieved without direct communications, a major 
advantage.

algorithm - which type of information is better. Such studies seemed too much uncertain 
and were replaced. The new test is as follows: 

(a) Take non-experts as Frequently Asked Questions

by Word Associations

2 Summary 


Methods 

All the methods are detailed in Appendix 2. Algorithmic details and pseudo codes are 
provided in that part of this Final Report. 

Main algorithmic components 


Top-down clustering method: _ 

The SSW structure is used to provide the hierarchical graph representation of the original 
graph with the smallest possible diameter and with the best match to the original network. 
Methods include 

o PageRank™ (method used by Google) clustering 
o Clustering based on incoming links 
o Clustering based on outgoing links 
o A ‘greedy’ version of clustering using outgoing links 
It was found that all clustering methods have their merits but, interestingly, PageRank™ 
was the worst amongst the different clustering algorithms. _ 


FAQ and answer based evaluation using hypernyms _ 

The study compares if words of FAQs or if words of FAQs extended by their hypernyms 
are better for finding html pages which match the words provided in the answers to those 
FAQs. 

It was found that this brute force EnE dictionary has minor advantages if applied alone 


Keyword and key-phrase extraction method _ 

Different keyword and key-phrase extraction methods were tried: 
o The KEA algorithm 
o Words of the ‘keyphrase’ metatag 
o KEA extension of key-phrases 


Medical sites studied 


Clustering, keyword and key-phrase extractions were executed on the following sites 
American Heart Association (AHA): http://www.americanheart.org 
Center for devices and radiological health (General): http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/index.html 
Collaborative Hypertext of Radiology (Radiology): http://chorus.rad.mcw.edu 
Details can be found in Appendix 2 


The main conclusion of this pre-study: 

All of these state-of-the-are algorithms have their own promises, none of them is satisfactory 
by itself, and that user specific fusing requires goal-oriented combination of these (and 
similar) methods. That is, alike to the link-highlighting solution (Appendix l.C) 
reinforcement learning has its promises here.

3 Motivation of the work 


There is a need for finding information efficiently. There are several problems here: 

1. The information is growing at an enormous rate 

2. Today, not the information but the refreshment of the information is the key 

3. Information is many faceted. Sometimes obvious things can not be understood 
without an appropriate dictionary 

4. Dictionary could mean glossary or thesauri. These are complementary tools, 

a. the basic element being the glossary, i.e., the explanation of the terms 

b. the advanced element being the thesaurus 

The desired object is the conceptual graphs, whose building blocks are concepts and 
conceptual relations. 

No wonder that different efforts have been initiated, including 

1. semantic networks and 

2. topic maps. 

Topic maps, for example, put the emphasis on topics, associations, and occurrences. XML 
forms of topic maps, HyTM and XTM, have been developed recently. However, although 
these technology components could be of importance, there is doubt that they will be able to 
conquer the world. In fact, the impression is that such technology components develop at a 
rate that nobody can become familiar with any of them before it becomes obsolete. 

Let us see what they say about topic maps 1 : 

„... The genesis of topic maps is to be found back in the early 1990's when what later became 
known as the Davenport Group was discussing ways of enabling the interchange of computer 
documentation. The group went on to develop DocBook (TDocBook 19991) , one of the most 
widely used DTDs for authoring SGML and XML documents. One of the problems the 
Davenport Group faced was that of merging the indexes of different sets of documentation, 
and the insight they arrived at was that: 

Indexes, if they have any self-consistency at all, conform to models of the structure of 
the knowledge available in the materials that they index. But the models are implicit, 
and they are nowhere to be found! If such models could be captured formally, then 
they could guide and greatly facilitate the process of merging modeled indexes 
together.” 

It is our firm belief that this note is very true. Yes, topic map is a useful tool for a well 
established subject: when we know what we are after and when we can find that material. In 
this case, a good topic map allows us to glance through the material quickly and efficiently. 

By the same token, however, it is our firm belief that 

there is no reason to expect that constructs like topic maps for novel and for not yet 
found information could be of use by any means. 

This pre-study is intended to be a forerunner of our three year project to be financed by 
USAF. 


i 


S. Pepper. The TAO of Topic Maps: Finding the Way in the Age of Infoglut, http://www.ontonia.net/ 


8 





The goals of that three year projects are: 

• to make robots to search for information, 

• allow for interaction between robotic and human intelligence in order to 

o improve searching and filtering capabilities of the robots 
o make robotic information amenable for human intelligence 
o adjust this collaborative work to the topic at hand, to the infonnation 
available and to the intelligence and knowledge of the human 
In other words, the goal of the research is to develop topic maps 

• given the actual and not yet known topics, 

• making use of the associations of the human and discovering the associations in the 
materials found by the robot 

• fusing these associations to meet each other, and 

• finding the novel occurrences given the fused knowledge. 

This process could be seen as a topic map jointly developed by robots and human(s). The goal 
of this interplay is to make novel information amenable for human intelligence. 

The underlying assumptions are as follows. It is assumed that 

1. The connectivity structure (associations, links on the Internet) is not random, it 
represents some semantic overlap. 

2. The connectivity structure is rational : it is the results of a selective process. 

3. Selective processes give rise to scale-free small world structures. 

Assumptions 1 and 2 are reasonable. Assumption 3 has many supporting evidences on all type 
of networks found in biology, neurobiology, social relations, relations in thesauri, etc. The 
abundance of the examples and the rare occurrence of counterexamples make Assumption 3 
attractive. 

The last fonnulation of our goals is as follows: 

Given the connectivity structure our goal is 

• to cluster the structure and 

• to find indices describing how or why are the clusters related. 

In our pre-study, we aim to find indexing words, which are representative to the clusters.

(For algorithmic details see Appendix 2.) 


The darker the color, the better the match is. It can be seen the hypemyms barely make any 
improvement. There are three notes to be made here: 

1. Differences depend on the clustering method 

2. Other figures (not shown here) indicate that the FAQ-answer method is not efficient 
for representing (indexing) the clusters. 

3. Point 2. may be spoiled by 

a. the small number of FAQs 

b. the hypernyms of the Word Associations, which does not reflect properly the 
relevant words and the relevant hypernyms for the “General” database (i.e., 
for database “Center for devices and radiological health”)

Again, the darker the color, the better the match is. It can be seen the hypernyms make in 
improvement in few cases. The same notes apply as for Figure 1. We shall investigate the 
effect for the General database and for the “outdeg” (outgoing links) clustering method in the 
next Figure.

(For algorithmic details see Appendix 2.) 


According to Figure 3, the improvement noted in Figure 2 is mostly due to a single FAQ: 
FAQ number 9. In turn, the improvement using the hypemyms is limited. Notes concerning 
the quality of hypemyms are, however, valid. In particular, a few FAQs indicate that FAQs 
could be representative to clusters. This brute-force method alone, however, is not sufficient 
to index the clusters.

Results on keyword and key-phrase extraction methods 



Figure 4. Keywords and key-phrases: Methods and thresholds 
Left: keyword based on metatag, OR relation between keywords 
Right: keywords from KEA, AND relation between keywords 

Database: All three databases. First letters of the horizontal axis: a=AHA, g=General, r=Radiology 
Clustering method: All clustering methods: Second letters of the horizontal axis: 
g=greedy_outdeg, i=indeg, o=outdeg, p=PageRank 
Vertical axis: threshold values 

Numbers within areas: number of keywords extracted at that threshold (horizontal), in that database 
(vertical first letter) and with that method (vertical second letter) 

Color denotes averaged cluster values 
(For algorithmic details see Appendix 2.) 

*Keyword from metatags and method KEA provide similar results. Only one example for each are shown here. 


Figure 4 shows that metatag and KEA based keywords and key-phrases are too many in 
number. Although in the OR 2 subfigure, values are high, in the AND 3 subfigure the values are 
low. That is, there is no (or very few) cluster(s), where the all the keywords or key-phrases of 
that cluster would appear in a single document. On the other hand, almost all documents 
contain at least one of the keywords or the key-phrases. 

Four notes are due here: 

1. Both KEA and the metatag methods are useful 

2. They are not useful for the indexing of a large body of documents with simple AND or 
OR operations 

3. They could be useful by using better AND, OR, XOR, etc. combinations of keywords 
and key-phrases. However, such indexing may give rise to a combinatorial blow-up. 

4. Considerable differences can be seen between the different clustering methods. 


2 Keyphrase evaluation is based on disjunction of key-phrases: A document is ‘good’ if it contains one of the 
keyphrases. 

3 Keyphrase evaluation is based on conjunction of key-phrases: A document is ‘good’ if it contains all of the 
keyphrases

Figure 5. Keywords and key-phrases from Mutual Information: Methods and thresholds 

Left: OR relation between keywords 
Right: AND relation between keywords 

Database: All three databases. First letters of the horizontal axis: a=AHA, g=General, r=Radiology 
Clustering method: All clustering methods: Second letters of the horizontal axis: 
g=greedy_outdeg, i=indeg, o=outdeg, p=PageRank 
Vertical axis: threshold values 

Numbers within areas: number of keywords extracted at that threshold (horizontal), in that database 
(vertical first letter) and with that method (vertical second letter) 

Color denotes averaged cluster values 
(For algorithmic details see Appendix 2.) 


Figure 5 shows that mutual information has very good chances to choose numbers, which can 
represent clusters. The task is to choose the appropriate threshold. The mutual information 
based keyword selection is somewhat better than the keyword selection based on the 
categories of the central pages of the databases (not shown here). This is promising, given that 
these databases are well established ones and the real task will concern not yet categorized 
clusters. In this respect, the keywords found be mutual information characterize (separate) the 
clusters somewhat better than the keywords chosen by the designers of the databases. 

Notes are due here: 

1. PageRank (4 th , 8 th and 12 th columns) is less characteristic than the other clustering 
methods 

2. On database Radiology the AND relation is meaningless for all types of clustering 
methods. This is in accord with the observation that the OR relation on database 
Radiology is superior to all of the other databases. That is, database Radiology is 
(possibly) constructed by different principles.

Figure 6. Keywords and key-phrases from Mutual Information: Individual clusters 

Left: OR relation between keywords 
Right: AND relation between keywords 

Database: All three databases. First letters of the horizontal axis: a=AHA, g=General, r=Radiology 
Clustering method: All clustering methods: Second letters of the horizontal axis: 
g=greedy_outdeg, i=indeg, o=outdeg, p=PageRank 
Value of threshold: 0.3 

Vertical axis: Cluster number. The smaller the number, the smaller the cluster is. (N/A denotes that 
some clustering methods produced less than 9 clusters.) 

Numbers within areas: number of keywords extracted in that cluster (horizontal), in that database 
(vertical first letter) and with that method (vertical second letter). 

Color denotes averaged cluster values 
(For algorithmic details see Appendix 2.) 


Figure 6 demonstrates that results of Figure 5 are relevant. Recall that in the FAQ-answer 
method, improvement was due to an improvement in a single cluster. Words extracted by the 
mutual infonnation method is capable to represent and separate several clusters either in ‘OR’ 
or in ‘AND’ combinations. In turn, there are methods, which can produce indices, the first 
step for making robotic intelligence amenable for humans.
