BACKGROUND 


AIR-4.1.2 

AV-8B HARRIER CLASS DESK 


GENERAL PROBLEM: 

• Use of COTS is growing in military 
embedded applications 

• Ada 95 is language of choice where 
COTS/GOTS can’t be applied 

• Mixed language situations may 
arise as a result 

• Risk reduction demonstrations are 
called for, employing Ada 95 in 
COTS RT environment (POSIX, C) 


SOLUTION: 

McDonnell Douglas Aerospace will: 

• Develop an air-to-ground ballistics 
algorithm using Ada 95 

• Link this algorithm into the AV-8B 
demonstration OFP (C, C++) 

• Perform a flight demonstration on an 
AV-8B equipped with COTS MC, 
POSIX-compliant RTOS 

• Apply/evaluate Wright Lab DFIP 


BENEFICIARIES: 

• AV-8B OSCAR 

• F-15 MPDP Upgrade 

• F/A-18Blk18E 

• C-17CIP 

• Joint Strike Fighter
