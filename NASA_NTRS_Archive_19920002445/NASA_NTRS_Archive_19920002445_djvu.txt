TECHNICAL REPORT 


The 

RICIS 

Concept 


The University of Houston-Clear Lake established the Research Institute for 
Computing and Information systems in 1986 to encourage NASA Johnson Space 
Center and local industry to actively support research in the computing and 
information sciences. As part of this endeavor, UH-Clear Lake proposed a 
partnership with JSC to jointly define and manage an integrated program of research 
in advanced data processing technology needed for JSCs main missions, including 
administrative, engineering and science responsibilities. JSC agreed and entered into 
a three-year cooperative agreement with UH-Clear Lake beginning in May, 1 986, to 
jointly plan and execute such research through RICIS. Additionally, under 
Cooperative Agreement NCC 9-16, computing and educational facilities are shared 
by the two institutions to conduct the research. 

The mission of RICIS is to conduct, coordinate and disseminate research on 
computing and information systems among researchers, sponsors and users from 
UH-Clear Lake, NASA/JSC, and other research organizations. Within UH-Clear 
Lake, the mission is being implemented through interdisciplinary involvement of 
faculty and students from each of the four schools: Business, Education, Human 
Sciences and Humanities, and Natural and Applied Sciences. 

Other research organizations are involved via the “gateway” concept. UH-Clear 
Lake establishes relationships with other universities and research organizations, 
having common research interests, to provide additional sources of expertise to 
conduct needed research. 

A major role of RICIS is to find the best match of sponsors, researchers and 
research objectives to advance knowledge in the computing and information 
sciences. Working jointly with NASA/JSC, RICIS advises on research needs, 
recommends principals for conducting the research, provides technical and 
administrative support to coordinate the research, and integrates technical results 
into the cooperative goals of UH-Clear Lake and NASA/JSC.

Preface 


This research was conducted under auspices of the Research Institute for 
Computing and Information Systems by Inference Corporation. Dr. Charles McKay 
served as RICIS research coordinator. 

Funding has been provided by the Information Systems Directorate, NASA/JSC 
through Cooperative Agreement NCC 9-16 between the NASA Johnson Space Center and 
the University of Houston-Clear Lake. The NASA technical monitor for this activity was 
Robert T. Savely, of the Software Technology Branch, Information Technology Division, 
Information Systems Directorate, NASA/JSC.

ART/ADA DESIGN PROJECT - PHASE I 


PROJECT PLAN 


1. Project Plan and Schedule 

1.1 Introduction 

This chapter describes the plan and schedule for Phase I of the Ada-Based ESBT Design Research 
Project. 

1.2 Platform 

The main platform for the project is a DEC Ada compiler on VAX mini-computers and VAXstations 
running the VMS operating system. 


1.3 Resource Requirement 

The project requires the following resources: 

• One principal investigator: Bradley P. Allen (BP A) 

• Two researchers: James T. Badura (JTB) and S. Daniel Lee (SDL) 

• Hardware: one VAXstation II, one Sun 3/260, and one IBM PS/2 Model 50 or 70. 

• Ada compilers: one copy of the DEC Ada compiler for a VAXstation, one copy of the Verdix 
Ada compiler for a Sun, and one copy of the Alsys Ada compiler for an IBM PS/2 

• C compiler: one copy of the VAX C compiler for a VAXstation, and one copy of the Microsoft 
C compiler for an IBM PS/2 

• ART-IM Version 1.5 

• ART/Ada Test cases: an extensive test suite similar to the ART-IM test suit, a benchmark 
program, and other small test cases. 


1.4 Effort 

The individual effort and the lines of code (LOC) for the project is shown in the following table. If the 
status is marked as "DONE", the effort and LOC are the actual numbers. Otherwise, they are estimated.
