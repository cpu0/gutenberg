INTRODUCTION 


This Validation Summary Report (VSR) describes the extent to which a 
specific Ada compiler conforms to the Ada Standard, ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A. 
This report explains all technical terms used within it and thoroughly 
reports the results of testing this compiler using the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability; (ACVC).- An Ada compiler must be implemented 
according to the Ada Standard, and any implementation-dependent features 
must conform to the requirements of the Ada Standard. The Ada Standard 
must be implemented in its entirety, and nothing can be implemented that is 
not_in_the Standard. 

Even though all validated Ada compilers conform to the Ada Standard, it 
must be understood that some differences do exist between implementations. 
The Ada Standard permits some implementation dependencies—for example, the 
maximum length of identifiers or the maximum values of integer types. 
Other differences between compilers result from the characteristics of 
particular operating systems, hardware, or implementation strategies. All 
the dependencies observed during the process of testing this compiler are 
given in this report. 

The information in this report is derived from the test results produced 
during validation testing. The validation process includes submitting a 
suite of standardized tests, the ACVC, as inputs to an Ada compiler and 
evaluating the results. The purpose of validating is to ensure conformity 
of the compiler to the Ada Standard by testing that the compiler properly 
implements legal language constructs and that it identifies and rejects 
illegal language constructs. The testing also identifier behavior that is 
implementation-dependent but is permitted by the Ada Standard. Six classes 
of tests are used. These tests are designed to perform checks at compile 
time, at link time, and during execution.

INTRODUCTION 


1.1 PURPOSE OF THIS VALIDATION SUMMARY REPORT 

This VSR documents the results of the validation testing performed on an 
Ada compiler. Testing was carried out for the following purposes: 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs supported by the 
compiler that do not conform to the Ada Standard 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs not supported by 
the compiler but required by the Ada Standard 

. To determine that the implementation-dependent behavior is allowed 
by the Ada Standard 

Testing of this compiler was conducted by SofTech, Inc. under the 
direction of the AVF according to procedures established by the Ada Joint 
Program Office and administered by the Ada Validation Organization (AVO). 
On-site testing was completed June 27, 1989 at Ft. Lauderdale, FL.

Failed test An ACVC test for which the compiler generates a result that 
demonstrates nonconformity to the Ada Standard. 

Host The computer on which the compiler resides. 

Inapplicable An ACVC test that uses features of the language that a 

test compiler is not required to support or may legitimately 

support in a way other than the one expected by the test. 

Passed test An ACVC test for which a compiler generates the expected 
result. 

Target The computer for which a compiler generates code. 

Test A program that checks a compiler's conformity regarding a 

particular feature or a combination of features to the Ada 
Standard. In the context of this report, the term is used to 
designate a single test, which may comprise one or more 
files. 

An ACVC test found to be incorrect and not used to check 
conformity to the Ada Standard. A test may be incorrect 
because it has an invalid test objective, fails to meet its 
test objective, or contains illegal or erroneous use of the 
language. 


1.5 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conformity to the Ada Standard is measured using the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains both legal and illegal Ada programs structured into six test 
classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies 
the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable, 
and special program units are used to report their results during 
execution. Class B tests are expected to produce compilation errors. 
Class L tests are expected to produce compilation or link errors because of 
the way in which a program library is used at link time. 

Class A tests ensure the successful compilation of legal Ada programs with 
certain language constructs which cannot be verified at compile time. 
There are no explicit program components in a Class A test to check 
semantics. For example, a Class A test checks that reserved words of 
another language (other than those already reserved in the Ada language) 
are not treated as reserved words by an Ada compiler. A Class A test is 
passed if no errors are detected at compile time and the program executes 
to produce a PASSED message. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that every syntax or 
semantic error in the test is detected. A Class B test is passed if every

INTRODUCTION 


illegal construct that it contains is detected by the compiler. 

Class C tests check the run time system to ensure that legal Ada programs 
can be correctly compiled and executed. Each Class C test is self-checking 
and produces a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result when it is executed. 


Class D tests check the compilation and execution capacities of a compiler. 
Since there are no capacity requirements placed on a compiler by the Ada 
Standard for some parameters—for example, the number of identifiers 
permitted in a compilation or the number of units in a library—a compiler 
may refuse to compile a Class D test and still be a conforming compiler. 
Therefore, if a Class D test fails to compile because the capacity of the 
compiler is exceeded, the test is classified as inapplicable. If a Class D 
test compiles successfully, it is self-checking and produces a PASSED or 
FAILED message during execution. 


Class E tests are expected to execute successfully and check 
implementation-dependent options and resolutions of ambiguities in the Ada 
Standard. Each Class E test is self-checking and produces a NOT 
APPLICABLE, PASSED, or FAILED message when it is compiled and executed. 
However, the Ada Standard permits an implementation to reject programs 
containing some features addressed by Class E tests during compilation. 
Therefore, a Class E test is passed by a compiler if it is compiled 
successfully and executes to produce a PASSED message, or if it is rejected 
by the compiler for an allowable reason. 


Class L tests check that incomplete or illegal Ada programs involving 
multiple, separately compiled units are detected and not allowed to 
execute. Class L tests are compiled separately and execution is attempted. 
A Class L test passes if it is rejected at link time—that is, an attempt 
to execute the main program must generate an error message before any 
declarations in the main program or any units referenced by the main 
program are elaborated. In some cases, an implementation may legitimately 
detect errors during compilation of the test. 

Two library units, the package REPORT and the procedure CHECK_FILE, support 
the self-checking features of the executable tests. The package REPORT 
provides the mechanism by which executable tests report PASSED, FAILED, or 
NOT APPLICABLE results. It also provides a set of identity functions used 
to defeat some compiler optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that 
would circumvent a test objective. The procedure CHECK FILE is used to 
check the contents of text files written by some of the Class C tests for 
chapter 14 of the Ada Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. These tests produce messages that 
are examined to verify that the units are operating correctly. If these 
units are not operating correctly, then the validation is not attempted. 

The text of each test in the ACVC follows conventions that are intended to 
ensure that the tests are reasonably portable without modification. For 
example, the tests make use of only the basic set of 55 characters, contain 
lines with a maximum length of 72 characters, use small numeric values, and 
place features that may not be supported by all implementations in separate

INTRODUCTION 


tests. However, some tests contain values that require the test to be 
customized according to implementation-specific values — for example, an 
illegal file name. A list of the values used for this validation is 
provided in Appendix C. 

A compiler must correctly process each of the tests in the suite and 
demonstrate conformity to the Ada Standard by either meeting the pass 
criteria given for the test or by shoving that the test is inapplicable to 
the implementation. The applicability of a test to an implementation is 
considered each time the implementation is validated. A test that is 
inapplicable for one validation is not necessarily inapplicable for a 
subsequent validation. Any test that vas determined to contain an illegal 
language construct or an erroneous language construct is withdrawn from the 
ACVC and, therefore, is not used in testing a compiler. The tests 
withdrawn at the time of this validation are given in Appendix D.

CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


2.2 IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS 

One of the purposes of validating compilers is to determine the behavior of 
a compiler in those areas of the Ada Standard that permit implementations 
to differ. Class D and E tests specifically check for such implementation 
differences. However, tests in other classes also characterize an 
implementation. The tests demonstrate the following characteristics: 


a. Capacities. 


(1) The compiler correctly processes a compilation containing 723 
variables in the same declarative part. (See test D29002K.) 

(2) The compiler correctly processes tests containing loop 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See tests D55A03A..H (8 
tests).) 

(3) The compiler correctly processes tests containing block 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See test D56001B.) 

(4) The compiler correctly processes tests containing recursive 
procedures separately compiled as subunits nested to 17 
levels. (See tests D64005E..G (3 tests).) 


b. Predefined types. 

(1) This implementation supports the additional predefined types 
TINYINTEGER, SHORT_INTEGER and LONG_FLOAT in package 
STANDARD. (See tests B86001T..Z (7 tests).) 


c. Expression evaluation. 

The order in which expressions are evaluated and the time at which 
constraints are checked are not defined by the language. While 
the ACVC tests do not specifically attempt to determine the order 
of evaluation of expressions, test results indicate the following: 

(1) None of ^he default initialization expressions for record 
components are evaluated before any value is checked for 
membership in a component's subtype. (See test C32117A.) 

(2) Assignments for subtypes are performed with the same precision 
as the base type. (See test C35712B.) 

(3) This implementation uses no extra bits for extra precision and 
uses all extra bits for extra range. (See test C35903A.) 


2-2 









CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(4) Sometimes NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when an integer literal 
operand in a comparison or membership test is outside the 
range of the base type. (See test C45232A.) 

(5) Sometimes NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when a literal operand in a 
fixed-point comparison or membership test is outside the range 
of the base type. (See test C45252A.) 

(6) Underflow is not gradual. (See tests C45524A..Z.) 


d. Rounding. 

The method by which values are rounded in type conversions is not 
defined by the language. While the ACVC tests do not specifically 
attempt to determine the method of rounding, the test results 
indicate the following: 

(1) The method used for rounding to integer is round away from 
zero. (See tests C46012A..Z.) 

(2) The method used for rounding to longest integer is round away 
from zero. (See tests C46012A..Z.) 

(3) The method used for rounding to integer in static universal 
real expressions is round away from zero. (See test C4A014A.) 


e. Array types. 

An implementation is allowed to raise NUMERIC_ERROR or 

CONSTRAINT_ERROR for an array having a 'LENGTH that exceeds 

STANDARD.INTEGER'LAST and/or SYSTEM.MAXINT. 

For this implementation: 

(1) Declaration of an array type or subtype declaration with more 
than SYSTEM.MAX_INT components raises no exception. (See test 
C36003A.) 

(2) K* , "RIC_ERROR is raised when a null array type with 

I> c’GER'LAST + 2 components is declared. (See test C36202A.) 

(3) NUKE°TC_ERROR is raised when a null array type with 

cy<-"T” MAX_INT + 2 components is declared. (See test 

C3G/j2B.) 

(4) A packed BOOLEAN array having a 'LENGTH exceeding INTEGER'LAST 
raises NUMERIC ERROR when the array type is declared. (See 
test C52103X.) 


2-3 









CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(5) A packed two-dimensional BOOLEAN array with more than 
INTEGER'LAST components raises NUMERIC_ERROR when the array 
type is declared. (See test C52104Y.) 

(6) A null array with one dimension of length greater than 

INTEGER'LAST may raise NUMERIC_ERROR or CONSTRAINT_ERROR 
either when declared or assigned. Alternatively, an 

implementation may accept the declaration. However, lengths 
must match in array slice assignments. This implementation 
raises NUMERIC ERROR when the array type is declared. (See 
test E52103Y.) “ 

(7) In assigning one-dimensional array types, the expression is 
evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

(8) In assigning two-dimensional array types, the expression is 
not evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is 
raised when checking whether the expression's subtype is 
compatible with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


f. Discriminated types. 

(1) In assigning record types with discriminants, the expression 
is evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINTERROR is raised 
when checking whether tue expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


g. Aggregates. 

(1) In the evaluation of a multi-dimensional aggregate, all 
choices are evaluated before checking against the index type. 
(See tests C43207A and C43207B.) 

(2) In the evaluation of an aggregate containing subaggregates, 
all choices are evaluated before being checked for identical 
bounds. (See test E43212B.) 

(3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised after all choices are evaluated 
when a bound in a non-null range of a non-null aggregate does 
not belong to an index subtype. (See test E43211B.) 


h. Pragmas. 

(1) The pragma INLINE is supported for functions and procedures. 
(See tests LA3004A..B, EA3004C..D, and CA3004E..F.) 


2-4 







CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


i. Generics 

(1) Generic specifications and bodies can be compiled in separate 
compilations. (See tests CA1012A, CA2009C, CA2009F, BC3204C, 
and BC3205D.) 

(2) Generic unit bodies and their subunits can be compiled in 
separate compilations. (See test CA3011A.) 


j. Input and output 

(1) The package SEQUENTIAL_IO can be instantiated with 
unconstrained array types and record types with discriminants 
without defaults. (See tests AE2101C, EE2201D, and EE2201E.) 

(2) The package DIRECT_I0 can be instantiated with unconstrained 
array types and record types with discriminants without 
defaults. (See tests AE2101H, EE2401D, and EE2401G.) 

(3) CREATE with modes IN_FILE and 0UT_FILE is supported for 

SEQUENTIALIO. Open with mode IN_FILE and OUT_FILE is 

supported for SEQUENTIAL_IO. (See tests CE2102D..E, CE2102N, 
and CE2102P.) 

(4) CREATE with modes INFILE, OUTFILE, and INOUT_FILE is 
supported for DIRECT_IO. Open with modes IN_FILE, OUT_FILE, 
and INOUT_FILE is supported for DIRECT_IO. ^See tests 
CE2102F, CE2102I..J, CE2102R, CE2102T, and CE2102V.) 

(5) CREATE with modes IN_FILE and OUT FILE is supported for text 
files. OPEN with modes IN_FILE an3 OUT FILE is supported for 
text files. (See tests CE3102E and CE31U2I..K.) 

(6) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for SEQUENTIAL_IO. 
(See tests CE2102G and CE2102X.) 

(7) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for DIRECT_IO. (See 
tests CE2102K and CE2102Y.) 

(8) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for text files. 
(See tests CE3102F..G, CE3104C, CE3110A, and CE3114A.) 

(9) Overwriting to a sequential file truncates to the last element 
written. (See test CE2208B.) 

(10) Temporary sequential files are given names and deleted when 
closed. (See test CE2108A.) 

(11) Temporary direct files are given names and deleted when

(14) More than one internal file can be associated with each 

external file for direct files when writing or reading. (See 
tests CE2107F..H (3 tests), CE2110D, and CE2111H.) 

(15) More than one internal file can be associated with each 

external file for text files when writing or reading. (See 
tests CE3111A,B,D,E, CE3114B, and CE3115A.)

CHAPTER 3 


TEST INFORMATION 


3.1 TEST RESULTS 

Version 1.10 of the ACVC comprises 3717 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, 44 tests had been withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF 
determined that 465 tests were inapplicable to this implementation. All 
inapplicable tests were processed during validation testing except for 285 
executable tests that use floating-point precision exceeding that supported 
by the implementation . Modifications to the code, processing, or grading 
for 11 tests were required to successfully demonstrate the test objective. 
(See section 3.6.) 

The AVF concludes that the testing results demonstrate acceptable 
conformity to the Ada Standard.

3.5 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

Some tests do not apply to all compilers because they make use of features 
that a compiler is not required by the Ada Standard to support. Others may 
depend on the result of another test that is either inapplicable or 
withdrawn. The applicability of a test to an implementation is considered 
each time a validation is attempted. A test that is inapplicable for one 
validation attempt is not necessarily inapplicable for a subsequent 
attempt. For this validation attempt, 465 tests were inapplicable for the 
reasons indicated: 


a. The following 285 tests are not applicable because they have 
floating-point type declarations requiring more digits than 
SYSTEM.MAX DIGITS:

supports no predefined type SHORT_FLOAT. 

c. The following 16 tests are not applicable because this 
implementation does not support a predefined type LONG_INTEGER: 

C45231C C45304C C45502C C45503C C45504C

CD7101F 

d. C45531I..P (8 tests) and C45532I..P (8 tests) are not applicable 

because the value of SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA is less than 31. 

e. C86001F is not applicable because, for this implementation, the 
package TEXT_IO is dependent upon package System. This test 
recompiles package System, making package TEXT_IO, and hence 
package Report, obsolete. 

f. B86001Y is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined fixed-point type other than DURATION. 

g. B86001Z is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined floating-point type with a name other than FLOAT, 
LONG_FLOAT, or SHORT_FLOAT. 

h. C96005B is not applicable because there are no values of type 
DURATION'BASE that are outside the range of DURATION. 

i. CD1009C, CD2A41A..B (2 tests), CD2A41E, and CD2A42A..J (10 tests) 
are not applicable because this implementation does not support 
size clauses for floating point types. 

j. CD2A61I and CD2A61J are not applicable because this implementation 
does not support size clauses for array types, which imply 
compression, with component types of composite or floating point 
types. This implementation requires an explicit size clause on 
the component type.

implementation does not support size clauses for tasks or task 
types. 

m. The following 76 tests are not applicable because this 

implementation does not support addresses for variables or

3.6 TEST, PROCESSING, AND EVALUATION MODIFICATIONS 

It is expected that some tests will require modifications of code, 
processing, or evaluation in order to compensate for legitimate 
implementation behavior. Modifications are made by the AVF in cases where 
legitimate implementation behavior prevents the successful completion of an 
(otherwise) applicable test. Examples of such modifications include: 
adding a length clause to alter the default size of a collection; splitting 
a Class B test into subtests so that all errors are detected; and 
confirming that messages produced by an executable test demonstrate 
conforming behavior that wasn't anticipated by the test (such as raising 
one exception instead of another). 

Modifications were required for 13 tests. 


The following tests were split because syntax errors at one point resulted 
in the compiler not detecting other errors in the test: 

B24009A B25002A B33301B B36002A B38003A B38003B 

B38009A B38009B B41202A BC1303F BC3005B 

The following tests were graded using a modified evaluation criterion: 

In test CE3804G, the string, "-3.525", is written to a text file, and a 
later attempt is made to read these characters as the value of a floating 
point variable. That variable is then compared to the real literal -3.525; 
this implementation finds the values not equal and reports failed. Since 
the real literal, -3.525, is not a model number, the AVO has ruled this 
test as passed for this implementation. 

In test CE3804H, the string, "-3.525", is written to a text file, and a 
later attempt is made to read these characters as the value of a 
fixed-point variable. That variable is then compared to the real literal

TEST INFORMATION 


-3.525; this implementation finds the values not equal and reports failed. 
Since the real literal, -3.525, is not a model number, the AVO has ruled 
this test as passed for this implementation. 


3.7 ADDITIONAL TESTING INFORMATION 


3.7.1 Prevalidation 

Prior to validation, a set of test results for ACVC Version 1.10 produced 
by the Harris Ada was submitted to the AVF by the applicant for review. 
Analysis of these results demonstrated that the compiler successfully 
passed all applicable tests, and the compiler exhibited the expected 
behavior on all inapplicable tests. 


3.7.2 Test Method 


Testing of the Harris Ada using ACVC Version 1.10 was conducted on-site by 
a validation team from the AVF. The configuration in which the testing was 
performed is described by the following designations of hardware and 
software components: 


Host computer: 

Host operating system: 
Target computer: 

Target operating system: 
Compiler: 


Harris HCX-2900 
CX/UX, 4.1 
Harris HCX-2900 
CX/UX, 4.1 

Harris Ada, Version 5.0 


A magnetic tape containing all tests except for withdrawn tests and tests 
requiring unsupported floating-point precisions was taken on-site by the 
validation team for processing. Tests that make use of 
implementation-specific values were customized before being written to the 
magnetic tape. Tests requiring modifications during the prevalidation 
testing were included in their modified form on the magnetic tape. 


The contents of the magnetic tape were loaded directly onto the host 
computer. 


After the test files were loaded to disk, the full set of tests was 
compiled, linked, and all executable tests were run on the Harris HCX-2900. 
Results were printed from the host computer. 

The compiler was tested using command scripts provided by Harris 
Corporation, Computer Systems Division and reviewed by the validation team. 
The compiler was tested using all default option settings except for the 
following:

Tests were compiled, linked, and executed (as appropriate) using a single 
computer. Test output, compilation listings, and job logs were captured on 
magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site by 
the validation team were also archived.

APPENDIX F 

IMPLEMENTATION-DEPENDENT CHARACTERISTICS 


F.l PROGRAM STRUCTURE AND COMPILATION 

A “main” program must be a non-generic subprogram that is either a procedure or a function returning 
an Ada STANDARD.INTEGER (the predefined type). A “main” program cannot be a generic subpro¬ 
gram or an instantiation of a generic subprogram. 


F.2 PRAGMAS 

F.2.1 Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 

Pragma CONTROLLED is recognized by the implementation but has no effect in this release. 

Pragma INLINE is implemented as described in section 6.3.2 and Appendix B of the Ada RM. This 
implementation expands recursive subprograms marked with the pragma up to a maximum nesting 
depth of 4. Warnings are produced for nesting depths greater than this or for bodies that are not avail¬ 
able for inline expansion. 

Pragma INTERFACE is recognized by the implementation and support calls to C and FORTRAN 
language functions. The Ada specifications can be either functions or procedures. All parameters must 
have mode IN. 

For C, the types of parameters and the result type for functions must be scalar, access, or the 
predefined type ADDRESS defined in the package SYSTEM. Record and array objects can be passed by 
reference using the ADDRESS attribute. The default link name is the symbolic representation of the 
simple name converted to lowercase. The link name of interface routines can be changed via the 
implementation-defined pragma external_name. 

For FORTRAN, all parameters are passed by reference. The parameter types must have the type 
.ADDRESS defined in the package SYSTEM. The result type for a FORTRAN function must be a scalar 
type. Care should be taken when using tasking and FORTRAN functions. Since FORTRAN is not 
reentrant, it is recommended that an Ada controller task be used to access FORTRAN functions. The 
default link name is the symbolic representation of the simple name converted to lowercase, with a lead¬ 
ing and trailing underscore character. The link name of interface routines can be changed via the 
implementation-defined pragma extemal_name. 

For FORTRAN, the implementation also detects usage of this pragma at link time see (a.ld) and 
includes a call to the system supplied FORTRAN initialization routine as part of the elaboration of the 
Ada program. Additionally, the default system FORTRAN libraries are included in the linking of the 
Ada program. 

Pragma LIST is implemented as described in Appendix B of the Ada RM. 

Pragma MEMORY_SIZE is recognized by the implementation but lias no visible effect. The 


0890288-000

CX/UX HAPSE Programmer s 


implementation restricts the argument to the predefined value in the package system. 

Pragma OPTIMIZE is recognized by the implementation but has no effect in this release. See the -O 
option for ada for code optimization options, or the implementation defined pragma. OPT_LEVEL. 

Pragma PACK causes the compiler to choose a non-aligned representation for elements of composite 
types. Application of the pragma will cause objects to be packed to the bit level. 

Pragma PAGE is implemented as described in Appendix B of the Ada RM. 

Pragma PRIORITY is implemented as described in Appendix B of the Ada RM. Priorities on HCX 
range from 0 to 9, with 9 being the most urgent. 

Pragma SHARED is recognized by the implementation but has no effect. 

Pragma STORAGE.UNIT is recognized by the implementation but has no visible effect. The imple¬ 
mentation restricts the argument to the predefined value in the package system. 

Pragma SUPPRESS in the single parameter form is supported and applies from the point of 
occurrence to the end of the innermost enclosing block. DIVISION_CHECK and OVERFLOW_CHECK 
for floating point types will reduce the amount of overhead associated with checking, but is not fully 
repressible. The double parameter form of the pragma, with a name of an object, type, or subtype is 
recognized, but has no effect. 

Pragma SYSTEM_NAME is recognized by the implementation but has no visible effect. The imple¬ 
mentation provides only one enumeration value for SYSTEM_NAME in the package SYSTEM. 


F.2.2 Implementation-Defined Pragmas 

Pragma EXTERNAL_NAME provides a method for specifying an alternative link name for vari¬ 
ables, functions and procedures. The required parameters are the simple name of the object and a 
string constant representing the link r ime. An underscore is automatically prepended to the specified 
name, unless the first character of the name is an underscore. Note that this pragma is useful for 
referencing functions and procedures that have had pragma INTERFACE applied to them, in such 
cases where the functions or procedures have link names that do not conform to Ada identifiers. The 
pragma must occur after any such applications of pragma INTERFACE and within the same declara¬ 
tive part or package specification that contains the object. 

Pragma INTERFACE_OBJECT provides an interface to objects defined externally from the Ada 
compilation model, or an object defined in a foreign language. For example, a variable defined in the 
run-time system may be accessed via the pragma. This pragma has two required parameters, the first 
being the simple name of an Ada variable to be associated with the foreign object. The second parame¬ 
ter is a string constant that defines the link name of the object. The variable declaration must occur 
before the pragma and both must occur within the same declarative part or package specification. 

Pragma INTERFACE_SHARED_OBJECT provides an interface to objects defined in foreign 
languages which exist in CX/UX shared memory segments. Specifically, this allows for the sharing of 
data between Ada objects and FORTRAN or C objects defined within the same process or in a separate 
process. 

Pragma INTERFACE_SHARED_OBJECT associates an Ada variable with a CV/T'X shared 

memory segment. It lias two required parameters. The first parameter is the simple .. of the Ada 

variable to be associated with the foreign object. The second parameter is a sinn. Mist, ant that 
defines the external link name of the object as defined in the foreign language. The vat ■ declaration 


B-3 


(1890288-000 












Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


must occur before the pragma and both must occur within the same declarative part or package 
specification. 

Variables marked with the pragma must have a static sue. It is recommended that an explicit length 
clause be specified for composite objects to ensure conformance with the size as defined by the foreign 
language. Additionally, record representation clauses may be used to define the layout of records to 
match the foreign language definitions. 

The association of the shared memory segment to the Ada variable is effected at program startup time, 
by the HAPSE run-time system. However, specific control over the configuration of the shared memory 
is defined externally from the Ada compilation model and requires user intervention. The CX/UX 
shmdefine utility has been provided to aid the user in defining the configuration of shared memory seg¬ 
ments. The utility produces a link-ready file and a loader command file which must be included in the 
link of any Ada program using pragma INTERFACE_SHARED_OBJECT. To include these files in 
the link process, the user should invoke the HAPSE prelinker, a.ld , adding the names of these files to 
the end of the command line. See section 11.2.2 for an example application of the pragma. Refer to the 
CX/UX User’s Reference Manual tor details on the shmdefine utility. 

Pragma SHARED_PACKAGE provides for the sharing and communication of library level packages. 
All variables declared in a package marked pragma SHARED_PACKAGE (henceforth referred to as 
a shared package) are allocated in shared memory that is created and maintained by the implementa¬ 
tion. The pragma can only be applied to library level package specifications. Each package 
specification nested in a shared package will also be shared and all objects declared in the nested pack¬ 
ages reside in the same shared memory as the outer package. 

The implementation restricts the kinds of objects that can be declared in a shared package. No uncon¬ 
strained or dynamically sized objects can be declared in a shared package. No access type objects can 
be declared in a shared package. No explicit initialization of objects can occur in a shared package. If 
any of these restrictions are violated, a warning message is issued and the package is not shared. These 
restrictions apply to nested packages as well. Note that if a nested package violates one of the above 
restrictions, it prevents the sharing of all enclosing packages as well. 

Task objects are allowed within shared packages, however, the tasks as well as the data defined within 
those tasks are not shared. 

Pragma SHARED_PACKAGE accepts as an optional argument, "params”, that, if specified, must 
be a string constant containing a comma separated list of CX/UX shared segment configuration param¬ 
eters, as defined by the following: 

• key= name, which identifies the CX/UX shared segment key to be used in subsequent shmget 
system calls, which are done automatically by the implementation in configuring the 
shared segment, name is considered to be a CX/UX filename which will be translated to a 
shared segment key using the CX/UX ftok(SC) service. By default. HAPSE applies ”key= 
{absolute HAPSE library path}/.shmem/package-name to the shared package. Note that relative 
path names may be specified and would cause key translation to be dependent on the user's 
current working directory when program execution is initiated. If name is a decimal integer 
literal, HAPSE interprets this as the actual CX/UX key, and does not translate it using the 
ftok service. 

• ipc= (IPC_CREAT, IPC_EXCL, IPC_PRIVATE), which allows the user to specify details 
about the initialization of the shared segment. By default. HAPSE applies ipc= 
(IPC_CREAT) t.o the shared package, thereby creating the shared segment if it did not pre- 


0890288-000 


B-4 











CX/ UX HAPSE Programmer s 


viously exist. If any ipc parameters are given, they entirely replace the default ipc 
specification. 

• SHMJR.DONLY, which specifies that the segment is only available for READ operations. 
HAPSE defaults shared package segments to READ/WRITE. 

• mode n, where n is assumed to be a 3 digit octal number defining the access to the shared 
segment. By default, HAPSE applies modesQ44 to the shared package, (owner read/write, 
group read, other read). 


A detailed explanation of the IPC and SHM Sags, and access modes may be found in the CX/UX 
Programmer's Reference Manual, Chapter 2. 

The pragma must appear within the specification of the library level package. The pragma may also be 
repeated in the package body to allow the user to override the shared memory configuration parameters 
that were associated with the pragma in the specification. Additionally, these configuration parameters, 
as defined above, may also be specified at link time to add, via the -shmem “p&rams" option, where 
"p&rams” is defined as above with the addition that the first item in the list must be the name of a 
shared package. If this option is used, then it replaces all previous information that may have been pro¬ 
vided with all pragmas for that package. 

With the valid application of pragma SHARED_PACKAGE to a library level package, the following 
assumptions can be made about the objects declared in the package: 

• The lifetime of such objects is greater than the lifetime defined by the complete execution of a 
single program. 

• The lifetime of such objects is guaranteed to extend from the elaboration of the shared pack¬ 
age by the first concurrent program until the termination of execution of the last concurrent pro¬ 
gram. 


In the assumptions above, a concurrent program is defined to be any Ada program which elaborates the 
body of a shared package, whose span of execution, from elaboration of such a package to termination, 
overlaps that of another such program. 

In actuality, the shared memory segments created by these programs remain even after the last con¬ 
current program has exited. The values of objects within these segments remains valid until the segment 
is destroyed, or until the system is rebooted. Segments may be explicitly removed through the shared 
memory service shmctl, to which an interface is provided in the HAPSE package 
sharcd„mcmory_support. Alternatively, the user may obtain information about active shared memory 
segments through the CX/UX utility ipcs(S). These segments may be removed via the CX/UX utility 
iprm(l). 

Programs that attempt to reference the contents of objects declared in shared packages that have not 
been implicitly or explicitly initialized are technically erroneous as defined by the RM (3.2.1(18)). This 
implementation, however, does not prevent such references and, in fact expects them. 

The above discussion describes the intent that several Ada programs may begin, continue, and complete 
their execution simultaneously, with the contents of the variables in the shared packages consistent with 
the execution of those programs. 

Since packages that contain objects that are initialized are not candidates for pragma 
SHAREDJPACKAGE, the implementation suggests that programs be created for the sole purpose of 


B-5 


0890288-000 












Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


initializing objects in the shared package. 

The association of a CX/UX shared memory segment with the shared package is effected during the ela- 
ooration of the package body If this association should fail due to system shared memory constraints, 
access, or improper use of shared memory configuration parameters, one of several predefined exceptions 
will be raised. The exceptions are of the form: 

shared_package_error.{name of package}.{service}.{code} 

where .{code} is a CX/UX error code mnemonic. 

For example, shared_package_error.package .shmat.EMFILE would be raised to indicate that the shared 
package attachment failed because it would exceed the system imposed limit on active shared segments. 
These exceptions are not available to the user since exceptions generated from the elaboration of library 
level package bodies have no enclosing scope from which to supply a handler. Refer to the CX/UX 
Programmer’s Reference Manual for a detailed list of the error conditions for shmget(2) and shmop(2). 

So that programs can define critical sections to reference and update variables within the shared pack¬ 
ages, HAPSE has provided semaphore operations. See the description of the implementation-defined 
attributes PTOCK and PTJNLOCK. 

Pragma SHAREJBODY is used to indicate whether or not an instantiation is to be shared. The 
pragma may reference the generic unit or the instantiated unit. When it references a generic unit, it 
sets sharing on/off for all instantiations of the generic, unless overridden by specific SHAREJBODY 
pragmas for individual instantiations. When it references an instantiated unit, sharing is on/off only for 
that unit. The default is to share all generics that can be shared, unless the unit uses pragma INLINE. 

+K. 

Pragma SHaRE_BODY is only allowed in the following places: immediately within a declarative 
part, immediately within a package specification, or after a library unit in a compilation, but before 
any subsequent compilation unit. The form of this pragma is 

pragma SHAREJBODY (generic_name, booleanjiteral) 

Note that a parent instantiation is independent of any individual instantiation, therefore recompilation 
of a generic with different parameters has no effect on other compilations that reference it. The unit 
that caused compilation of a parent instantiation need not be referenced in any way by subsequent 
units that share the parent instantiation. 

Sharing generics causes a slight execution time penalty because all type attributes must be indirectly 
referenced (as if an extra calling argument were added). However, it substantially reduces compilation 
time in most circumstances and reduces program size. 

Pragma OPT_LEVEL controls the level of optimization performed by the compiler. This pragma 
takes one of the following as an argument: NONE, MINIMAL, GLOBAL, or MAXIMAL. The default is 
MINIMAL. NONE produces inefficient code but allows for faster compilation time. MINIMAL produces 
more efficient code with the compilation time slightly degraded. GLOBAL produces highly optimized 
code but the compilation time is significantly impacted. MAXIMAL is an extension of GLOBAL that 
can produce even better code but may change the meaning of the program. MAXIMAL attempts 
strength reduction optimizations that may raise OVERFLOW exceptions when dealing with values that 
approach the limits of the architecture of the machine. The pragma is allowed within any declarative 
part. The specified optimization level will apply to all code generated for the specifications and bodies 
associated with the immediately enclosing declarative part. 

In general, programs should be developed and debugged using OPT_LEVEL (MINIMAL), reserving 
GLOBAL and MAXIMAL for a thoroughly tested product.

F.3 IMPLEMENTATION-DEPENDENT ATTRIBUTES 

HAPSE has defined the following attributes for use in conjunction with the implementation-defined 
pragma SHAREDJPACKAGE. 

PTvEY 

PLOCK 

PTJNLOCK 

Where the prefix P denotes a package marked with pragma SHARED .PACKAGE. 

The KEY attribute is an overloaded parameterless function which returns the key used to identify the 
CX/UX shared segment associated with the package. One specification of the function returns the 
predefined type ■•string, and returns a value specifying the filename used in the key translation (ftok(SC)l. 
If an integer literal key was specified in the pragma shared.package parameters, this function returns 
a null string. The other specification of the function returns the predefined type nnircrsal_inte.ger. and 


B-7 


0890288-000 




Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


returns a value specifying the translated integer key. The latter form of the function will raise the 
predefined exception PROGRAM^ERROR if the shared package body has not yet been elaborated. 

The ’LOCK and UNLOCK attributes are parameterless procedures which manipulate the “state” of a 
shared package. HAPSE defines all shared packages to have two states: LOCKed and UNLOCKed. 
Upon return from the UOCK procedure, the state of the package will be LOCKed. If upon invocation. 
UOCK finds the state already LOCKed, it will wait until it becomes UNLOCKed before altering the 
state and returning. UNLOCK sets the state of the package to UNLOCKed and then returns. At the 
point of unlocking the package, if another process waiting in the UOCK procedure has a more favorable 
CX/UX priority, the system will immediately schedule its execution. 

Note that if UOCK is waiting, it may be interrupted by the HAPSE run-time system’s time slice for 
tasks which may cause another task within the process to become active. Eventually, HAPSE will again 
transfer control to the UOCK procedure in the original task, and it will continue waiting or return to 
the task. 

The state of the package is only meaningful to the UOCK and UNLOCK attribute procedures that set 
and query the state. A LOCK state does not prevent concurrent access to objects in the shared 
package. These attributes only provide indivisible operations for the setting and testing of implicit 
semaphores that could be used to control access to shared package objects. 

HAPSE provides the package, shared_znemory.support. This package contains Ada type, subpro¬ 
gram definitions, and interfaces to aid the user in manually interfacing to the CX/UX shared memory 
services. 

This includes: 

• System defines and records layouts as defined by the CX/UX C Programming Language 
include files, <sys/shm.h> and <sys/ipc.h>. 

• Interface specifications to shared memory system calls: shmbind, shmget shmat, shmctl, 
shmit. 

• Interface specifications to the CX/UX binary semaphore operators: binsemget, lockbin- 
sem, vnlockbinsem.

F.5 RESTRICTIONS ON REPRESENTATION CLAUSES 
F.5.1 Pragma PACK 

Pragma PACK is fully supported. Objects and components are packed to the nearest and smallest hi; 

boundary when pragma PACK is applied. 


F.5.2 Length Clauses 

The specification T’SIZE is fully supported for all scalar and composite types, except for floating point. 
The specification T’SIZE is not supported for access and task types. 

T’SIZE applied to a composite type will cause compression of scalar component types and the gaps 
between the components. T’SIZE applied to a composite type whose components are composite types 
does not imply compression of the inner composite objects. To achieve such compression, the implemen¬ 
tation requires explicit application of T’SIZE or pragma PACK to the inner composite type. 

Composite types which contain components that have had T’SIZE applied to them, will adhere to the 
specified component size, even if it causes alignment of components on non STORAGEJIJNIT boun¬ 
daries. 

The size of a non-component object of a type whose size has been adjusted, via T’SIZE or pragma 
PACK, will be exactly the specified size; however, the implementation will choose an alignment for such 
objects that provides optimal performance. 

F.5.3 Record Representation Clauses 

The simple expression following the keywords “at mod” in an alignment clause specifies the 
STORAGE_UNIT alignment restrictions for the record, and must be one of the following values: 1.2 or 
4. 

The simple expression following the keyword “at” in a component clause specifies the STORAGE_UNIT 
(relative to the beginning of the record) at which the following range is applicable. Tiie static range fol¬ 
lowing the keyword range specifies the bit range of the component. Components may overlap word 
boundaries (4 STORAGE_UNITs). Components that are themselves composite types must be aligned o; 
a STORAGE_UNIT boundary. 

A component clause applied to a component that is a composite type does not imply compression of 
that component. For such component types, the implementation requires that T’SIZE or pragma PACK 
be applied, if compression beyond the default size is desired.

F.5.4 Address Clauses 

Address clauses are only supported for the task entries. 

The function PHYSICAL_ADDRESS is defined in the package SYSTEM to provide conversion from 
INTEGER values to .ADDRESS values. 


F.5.5 Interrupts 

Interrupt entries (UNIX signals) are supported. This feature allows Ada programs to bind a UNIX sig¬ 
nal to an interrupt entry by using a for clause with a signal number. There is no protection against 
two tasks binding the same signal. The result is undefined. Interrupt entries should have no parameters 
and can be called explicitly by the program. See SIGVEC(2). 

The HAPSE runtime uses SIGALRM (14) to perform time slicing and delays. The result of establishing 
a signal handler for SIGALRM is undefined. 

The following example program uses an interrupt entry that prints a message when the process receives 
SIGINT. 

with TEXT JO, SYSTEM; 
use TEXT JO; 
procedure INTR is 

-This program waits for the user to generate SIGINT (<CONTROL>C)

task body SIGINT JLANDLER is 
begin 

accept SIGINT; 

PUT_LINE(“Control-C received”); 
end SIGINT JLANDLER; 

begin 

null; 

end INTR; 


F.6 OTHER REPRESENTATION IMPLEMENTATION-DEPENDENCIES 


The ADDRESS attribute is not supported for the following entities: static constants, packages, tasks, 
labels, and entries. Application of the attribute to these entities generated a compile time warning and 
a value of 0 at runtime.

Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


F.7 CONVENTIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION-GENERATED NAMES 


There are no implementation generated names. 


F.8 UNCHECKED CONVERSIONS 
F.8.1 Restrictions 

The predefined generic function UNCHECKED conversion cannot be instantiated with a target type 
that is an unconstrained array type or an unconstrained record type with discriminants. 


F.9 IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS OF I/O PACKAGES 

F.9.1 Implementation-Dependent Characteristics Of DIRECT I/O 

Instantiations of DIRECT_IO use the value MAXJRECJSIZE as the record size (expressed in 
STORAGE_UNITs) when the size of ELEMENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For example, for uncon¬ 
strained arrays such as a string where ELEMENT_TYPE’SIZE is very large, MAX_REC_SIZE is used 
instead. MAX_RECORD_SIZE is defined in SYSTEM as 4_000_000 storage units. 


F.9.2 Implementation-Dependent Characteristics Of SEQUENTIAL I/O 

Instantiations of SEQUENTLAL-IO use the value MAX_REC_SIZE as the record size (expressed in 
STORAGE_UNITs) when the size of ELEMENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For example, for uncon¬ 
strained arrays such as a string where ELEMENT_TYPE’SIZE is very large, MAX_REC_SIZE is used 
instead. MAX_RECORD_SIZE is defined in SYSTEM as 4_000_000 storage units. 


F.10 MACHINE CODE INSERTIONS 


The general definition of package MACHINE_CODE provides an assembly language interface for the 
target machine including the necessary record types needed in the code statement, an enumeration type 
containing all the opcode mnemonics, a set of register definitions, and a set of addressing mode func¬ 
tions. Also supplied (for use only in units that WITH MACHINE_CODE) is implementation-defined 
attribute REF. 

Machine code statements take operands of type OPERAND, a private type that forms the basis of all 
machine code address formats for the target. 

The general syntax of a machine code statement is 

CODE_ n’(opcode, operand {, operand}); 

In the example shown below, C0DE_2 is a record 'format’ whose first argument is an enumeration value 
of type OPCODE followed by two operands of type OPERAND. 

CODE_2’(MOVL. a ref. b'ref): 

The opcode must be an enumeration literal (i.e., it can not be an object, attribute, or a rename) An 


0890288-000 


B-12 









CXjUX HAPSE Programmer 's 


operand can only be an entity defined in MACHINE_CODE or the ’REF attribute. 

For an object, arguments to any of the functions defined in MACHINE_CODE must be static expres¬ 
sions. string literals, or the functions defined in MACHINE_CODE. The ’REF attribute may not be 
used as an argument in any of these functions. 

The REF attribute denotes the effective address of the first of the storage units allocated to the object 
For a label, it refers to the address of the machine code associated with the corresponding body or 
statement. The attribute is of type OPERAND defined in package MACHINE_CODE anc is allowed 
only within a machine code procedure. REF is only supported for simple objects and labels.. 

Registers - The supported register operands are RO, Rl, ...., R15, FP (which is Rl3), SP (which is R14) 
and PC (which is R15). 


Addressing Modes - All of the HCDCs addressing modes are supported by the compiler, except for some 
PC relative modes. They are accessed through the following functions provided in MACHINE_CODE.

APPENDIX D 


VITHDRAVN TESTS 


Some tests are withdrawn from the ACVC because they do not conform to the 
Ada Standard. The following 44 tests had been withdrawn at the time of 
validation testing for the reasons indicated. A reference of the form 
Al-ddddd is to an Ada Commentary. 


a. E28005C: This test expects that the string "— TOP OF PAGE. —63" of 
line 204 will appear at the top of the listing page due to a pragma 
PAGE in line 203; but line 203 contains text that follows the pragma, 
and it is this text that must appear at the top of the page. 

b. A39005G: This test unreasonably expects a component clause to pack an 
array component into a minimum size (line 30). 

c. B97102E: This test contains an unintended illegality: a select 
statement contains a null statement at the place of a selective wait 
alternative (line 31). 

d. C97116A: This test contains race conditions, and it assumes that 

guards are evaluated indivisibly. A conforming implementation may use 
interleaved execution in such a way that the evaluation of the guards 
at lines 50 & 54 and the execution of task CHANGING 0F_THE_GUARD 

results in a call to REPORT.FAILED at one of lines 52 or 56. 

e. BC3009B: This test wrongly expects that circular instantiations will 
be detected in several compilation units even though none of the units 
is illegal with respect to the units it depends on; by AI-00256, the 
illegality need not be detected until execution is attempted (line 
95). 

f. CD2A62D: This test wrongly requires that an array object's size be no 
greater than 10 although its subtype's size was specified to be 40 
(line 137).

derived subprogram (which implicitly converts them to the parent type 
(Ada standard 3.4:14)). Additionally, they use the 'SIZE length 
clause and attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic 
by the WG9 ARG. 

h. CD2A81G, CD2A83G, CD2A84M..N, and CD50110 (5 tests): These tests 

assume that dependent tasks will terminate while the main program 
executes a loop that simply tests ior task termination; this is not 
the case, and the main program may loop indefinitely (lines 7^, 85, 
86, 96, and 58, respectively). 

i. CD2B15C and CD7205C: These tests expect that a 'STORAGE_SIZE length 
clause provides precise control over the number of designated objects 
in a collection; the Ada standard 13.2:15 allows that such control 
must not be expected. 

j. CD2D11B: This test gives a SMALL representation clause for a derived 
fixed-point type (at line 30) that defines a set of model numbers that 
are not necessarily represented in the parent type; by Commentary 
AI-00099, all model numbers of a derived fixed-point type must be 
representable values of the parent type. 

k. CD5007B: This test wrongly expects an implicitly declared subprogram 
to be at the address that is specified for an unrelated subprogram 
(line 303). 

l. ED7004B, ED7005C..D, and ED7006C..D (5 tests): These tests check 
various aspects of the use of the three SYSTEM pragmas; the AVO 
withdraws these tests as being inappropriate for validation. 

m. CD7105A: This test requires that successive calls to CALENDAR.CLOCK 
change by at least SYSTEM.TICK; however, by Commentary AI-00201, it is 
only the expected frequency of change that must be at least 
SYSTEM.TICK—particular instances of change may be less (line 29). 

n. CD7203B and CD7204B: These tests use the 'SIZE length clause and 
attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic by the WG9 
ARG. 

o. CD7205D: This test checks an invalid test objective: it treats the 
specification of storage to be reserved for a task's activation as 
though it were like the specification of storage for a collection. 

p. CE2107I: This test requires that objects of two similar scalar types 
be distinguished when read from a file—DATA_ERR0R is expected to be 
raised by an attempt to read one object as of the other type. 
However, it is not clear exactly hov the Ada standard 14.2.4:4 is to 
be interpreted; thus, this test objective is not considered valid 
(line 90). 


D-2 







WITHDRAWN TESTS 


q. CE3111C: This test requires certain behavior, when two files are 
associated with the same external file, that is not required by the 
Ada standard. 

r. CE3301A: This test contains several calls to END_OF_LINE and 

END_OF_PAGE that have no parameter: these calls were intended to 
specify a file, not to refer to STANDARD_INPUT (lines 103, 107, 118, 
132, and 136). 

s. CE3411B: This test requires that a text file's column number be set to 
COUNT'LAST in order to check that LAY0UT_ERR0R is raised by a 
subsequent PUT operation. But the former operation will generally 
raise an exception due to a lack of available disk space, and the test 
would thus encumber validation testing.
