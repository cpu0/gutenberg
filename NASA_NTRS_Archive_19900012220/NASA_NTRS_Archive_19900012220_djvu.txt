FOREWORD 


The Software Engineering Laboratory (SEL) is an organization 
sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administra- 
tion/Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA/GSFC) and created for 
the purpose of investigating the effectiveness of software 
engineering technologies when applied to the development of 
applications software. The SEL was created in 1977 and has 
three primary organizational members: 

NASA/GSFC (Systems Development Branch) 

The University of Maryland (Computer Sciences Department) 

Computer Sciences Corporation (Systems Development 
Operation) 

The goals of the SEL are (1) to understand the software de- 
velopment process in the GSFC environment; (2) to measure 
the effect of various methodologies, tools, and models on 
this process; and (3) to identify and then to apply success- 
ful development practices. The activities, findings, and 
recommendations of the SEL are recorded in the Software En- 
gineering Laboratory Series, a continuing series of reports 
that includes this document. 

The primary contributors to this document are 

Melanie Buhler (Computer Sciences Corporation) 

Jon Valett (Goddard Space Flight Center)

SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION 


This document is an annotated bibliography of technical 
papers, documents, articles, and memoranda produced by or 
related to the Software Engineering Laboratory (SEL) . It is 
intended to provide a quick reference to the published re- 
sults of SEL research and development activities. 

More than 100 publications are summarized in this document. 
Each summary includes the size of the publication (number of 
pages), a description (abstract) of its contents, and its 
original citation. Previous versions and subsequent re- 
printings are also identified where appropriate. 

The publications described here cover many aspects of soft- 
ware engineering and range from research reports to software 
documentation. They are divided into eight general subject 
areas : 

• The Software Engineering Laboratory 

• The Software Engineering Laboratory: Software De- 

velopment Document 

• Software Tools 

• Software Models 

• Software Measurement 

• Technology Evaluations 

• Ada Technology 

• Data Collection 

Two indexes are included at the end of this document to as- 
sist in identifying materials by subject, and author. In 
the subject index, a list of the abstract numbers of related 
publications follows each subject heading. For the author 
index, publications with their corresponding abstract num- 
bers, are ordered by individual authors.

5.1 APPLICABILITY OF THE RAYLEIGH CURVE TO THE SEL ENVIRON- 
MENT . SEL-78-007 , T. E. MAPP, DECEMBER 1978, 27 PAGES 


This document reviews the resource utilization model for 
software development, which is based on the Rayleigh curve 
developed by Norden and Putnam. A Rayleigh curve is fit to 
data provided by the SEL. Parabolas, trapezoids, and 
straight lines are also fit to the same data. The parabola 
and trapezoid give about as good a fit as the Rayleigh 
curve. Therefore, this document concludes that while the 
Rayleigh curve may be an appropriate model for resource 
expenditures, it is not necessarily the best model for 
small- to medium-size projects. NSTF

This technical paper describes the analysis of resource es- 
timation techniques that is being performed by the SEL . The 
data used in the analysis is collected from medium-scale 
flight dynamics software development projects at GSFC. A 
procedure to forecast accurately the cost and development 
time of these projects would be a valuable management tool 
in this environment. This paper documents a specific at- 
tempt to verify the resource estimation model based on the 
Rayleigh curve that was developed by Norden and Putnam. JAO

5.3 THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING LABORATORY: RELATIONSHIP 

EQUATIONS , SEL-79-002 , K. FREBURGER AND V. R. BASILI, 
MAY 1979, 67 PAGES 

This document presents the results of an analysis of several 
factors affecting software development. The analysis was 
based on data collected by the SEL. Relationships among the 
following measures were studied: 

• Total effort (staff-months) 

• Lines of delivered code (thousands) 

• Lines of developed code (thousands) 

• Percentage of developed code 

• Number of modules 

• Number of developed modules 

• Percentage of developed modules 

• Project duration (months) 

• Pages of documentation 

• Productivity 

• Average staff size 

Estimating equations were derived from the measures by sta- 
tistical analysis and were then compared with results ob- 
tained by Walston and Felix in a similar study. This 
document was also issued as University of Maryland Technical

TUTORIAL ON MODELS AND METRICS FOR SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT 
AND ENGINEERING . SEL-80-008, V. R. BASILI, 1980, 

349 PAGES 

This document is a tutorial on quantitative methods of soft- 
ware management and engineering. A quantitative methodology 
is needed to evaluate, control, and predict software devel- 
opment and maintenance costs. This quantitative approach 
allows cost, time, and quality tradeoffs to be made in a 
systematic manner. The tutorial focuses on numerical 
product-oriented measures such as size, complexity, and 
reliability and on resource-oriented measures such as cost, 
schedules, and resources. Twenty articles from software 
engineering literature are reprinted in this document. The 
articles are organized into the following sections: 

• Resource models 

• Changes and errors 

• Product metrics 

• Data collection 

Successful application of these techniques, however, re- 
quires a thorough knowledge of the project under development 
and any assumptions made. Only then can these techniques 
augment good managerial and engineering judgment. JAO

This technical paper attempts to characterize several quan- 
titative models and measures of the software development 
process. These models and measures deal with various as- 
pects of the software process and product, including re- 
source estimation, complexity, reliability, and size. The 
relationship of these models and measures to the software 
development life cycle is also discussed. Finally, the ex- 
tent to which the various models have been applied in pro- 
duction environments and the success they have achieved is 
indicated.* JAO

5.6 A STUDY OF THE MUSA RELIABILITY MODEL . SEL-80-005, 
A. M. MILLER, NOVEMBER 1980, 94 PAGES 


This document describes a study in which the Musa reliabil- 
ity model was applied to three software projects developed 
for GSFC, with the goal of determining whether the model 
could be used in the flight dynamics environment as a soft- 
ware management tool. One purpose of the model is to pre- 
dict the total number of errors in a piece of software 
undergoing testing. Actual times between failures and thei 
associated run times were fitted to the Musa equation in an 
iterative procedure. Of the three projects studied, the 
results for one converged to a value 25 percent higher than 
the actual number of errors; the other two did not converge 
at all. 


The document discusses the assumptions underlying the model 
and evaluates the characteristics of the environment that 
could affect these assumptions. Suggestions are offered 
about changes that could be made in the environment to 
better meet the assumptions. This document was originally

SEL data. The following models were considered: 

• Doty 

• Walston/Felix 

• Tecolote 

• GRC 

• SLIM 

• PRICE S3 

• SEL Meta-Model 

The validity of the theoretical bases of these models was

EXPENDITURES," J. W. BAILEY AND V. R. BASILI, 
PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON 
SOFTWARE ENGINEERING . NEW YORK: IEEE COMPUTER 

SOCIETY PRESS, 1981, 10 PAGES 

This technical paper describes an effort to produce a model 
of software development resource expenditures that can be 
generalized to a number of situations. Many models have 
been proposed over the last several years. However, experi- 
ence has shown that differences in the data collected, types 
of projects developed, and environmental factors limit the 
transportability of these models from one organization to 
another. This conclusion is reasonable because a model de- 
veloped in any given environment will reflect only the im- 
pact of factors that have a variable effect in that 
environment. Factors that are constant in that environment 
(and therefore do not affect productivity) may have differ- 
ent or variable effects in another environment. 

This paper describes a model-generation process that permits 
the development of a resource estimation model for any par- 
ticular organization. The process provides the capability 
to produce a model that is tailored to the organization and 
can be expected to be more effective than any model orig- 
inally developed for another environment. The model is 
demonstrated here using data collected by the SEL at GSFC.

5.9 "CAN THE PARR CURVE HELP WITH MANPOWER DISTRIBUTION AND 
RESOURCE ESTIMATION PROBLEMS?", V. R. BASILI AND 
J. BEANE, JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE . 

FEBRUARY 1981, VOL. 2, NO. 1, 11 PAGES 

This technical paper analyzes the resource utilization model 
developed by Parr. The curve predicted by the model is com- 
pared with several other curves, including the Rayleigh 
curve, a parabola, and a trapezoid, with respect to how well 
they fit manpower utilization. The evaluation is performed 
for several flight dynamics projects of the 6- to 12-man-year 
effort range that were studied by the SEL. 

The conclusion drawn is that the Parr curve can be made to 
fit the data better than the other curves. However, because 
of the noise in the data, it is difficult to confirm the 
shape of the manpower distribution from the data alone and 
therefore difficult to validate any particular model. More- 
over, since the parameters used in the curve are not easily 
calculable or estimable from known data, the curve is not 
effective for resource estimation. JAO

5.10 THE RAYLEIGH CURVE AS A MODEL FOR EFFORT DISTRIBUTION 
OVER THE LIFE OF MEDIUM SCALE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS. 


SEL-81-012, G. O. PICASSO, DECEMBER 1981, 153 PAGES 

This document discusses some of the factors affecting the 
accuracy of resource models applied to medium-scale software 
systems. Putnam has shown that the Rayleigh curve is an 
adequate model for the life-cycle effort distribution of 
large-scale systems. Previous investigations of the appli- 
cability of this model to medium-scale software development 
efforts have met with mixed results. The results of the 
earlier investigations are confirmed in this analysis. The 
reasons for the failure of the models are found in the sub- 
cycle (phase) effort data. There are four contributing fac- 
tors: uniqueness of the environment studied, the influence 

of holidays, varying management techniques, and differences 
in the data studied. This document was also issued as

several FORTRAN projects with similar profiles, was to iden- 
tify project-independent measures. The projects developed 
serve similar functions, and because the projects are simi- 
lar, some underlying relationships exist that are invariant 
between the projects. These relationships, once well de- 
fined, may be used to compare the development of different 
projects to determine whether they are evolving in the same 
way previous projects in this environment evolved. JAO

This document describes the general procedures for software 
cost estimation in any environment. First, the basic con- 
cepts of work and effort estimation are explained, some pop- 
ular resource estimation models are reviewed, and the 
accuracy of resource estimates is investigated. Next, gen-

the software life cycle. The sources of information and 
relevant parameters available during each phase cycle are 
identified. Finally, a comprehensive software cost predic- 
tion procedure based on the experiences of the SEL in the

those that can be determined in the early stages of project 
development and may therefore be useful in a baseline equa-

that can be used mainly to characterize or evaluate effort 
requirements and thus enhance our understanding of the soft-

of the analyses are presented in this paper. jao

are 

• Definition — Motivation, object, purpose, 
perspective, domain, and scope 

• Planning — Design, criteria, and measurement 

• Operation — Preparation, execution, and analysis 

• Interpretation — Interpretation context, 
extrapolation, and impact 

The paper describes a variety of experiments in the frame- 
work and discusses their contribution to the software engi- 
neering discipline. Some useful recommendations for the

ENVIRONMENTS", V. R. BASILI AND H. D. ROMBACH, PROCEED- 
INGS OF THE 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE 
ENGINEERING . MARCH 1987, 12 PAGES 

This paper presents a methodology for improving the software 
process by tailoring it to the specific project goals and 
environment. This improvement process is aimed at the 
global software process model as well as methods and tools 
supporting that model. The basic idea is to use defect pro- 
files to help characterize the environment and evaluate the 
project goals and the effectiveness of methods and tools in 
a quantitative way. The improvement process is implemented 
iteratively by setting project improvement goals, character- 
izing those goals and the environment, in part, via defect 
profiles in a quantitative way, choosing methods and tools 
fitting those characteristics, evaluating the actual be- 
havior of the chosen set of methods and tools, and refining 
the project goals based on the evaluation results. All 
these activities require analysis of large amounts of data 
and, therefore, support by an automated tool. Such a tool — 
TAME (Tailoring A Measurement Environment) — is currently 
being developed. JAO

5.21 "A META INFORMATION BASE FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERING," 

L. MARK AND H. D. ROMBACH, TR-1765, UNIVERSITY OF 
MARYLAND, TECHNICAL REPORT, JULY 1987, 34 PAGES 

This paper proposes a meta model and a graphical notation 
for specifying software engineering processes and products. 
This meta model leads to the view that a software engineer- 
ing information base needs to support the storage and re- 
trieval of process and product descriptions as well as all 
data related to the executions of process descriptions and 
the actual instances of product descriptions generated dur- 
ing the course of a software engineering project. A meta 
schema for information bases is presented that allows the 
authors to deal with this type of information in a natural 
way. In addition, software engineering information bases 
need to be adaptable to changing process and product de- 
scriptions based on changing project goals and character- 
istics of the project environment and the organization. The 
meta schema of an information base allows for the generation 
of a customized information base for a given set of processes 
and products specified according to the software engineering 
meta model. The idea for this research originated in the 
TAME project at the University of Maryland aiming at the 
development of a measurement, feed-back, and planning envi- 
ronment. Currently, the authors have implemented a first 
prototype information base as part of the prototype TAME 
system customized to the specific needs of the NASA/SEL en- 
vironment. The schema of this first prototype was defined 
by hand and is implemented on a relational data base system. 
Developing the idealized information base for software engi- 
neering requires more research in the areas of software 
engineering and data bases. In the area of software engi- 
neering, the authors need to improve their understanding of 
the software process and product in order to be able to

construct more formal specifications; in the area of data 
bases, they need to develop a data base technology for prop- 
erly mirroring the specific engineering concepts, including 
self-adaptability. SDB

TION BASES FROM SOFTWARE PROCESS AND PRODUCT SPECI-

THE 22ND ANNUAL HAWAII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON 
SYSTEM SCIENCES . JANUARY 1989, 9 PAGES 

This paper presents the information base oriented part of 
the "Meta Information Base for Software Engineering" project 
at the University of Maryland. The idea of this project is 
to generate customized software engineering information 
bases from formal specif ications of software engineering 
processes and products. The generator approach acknowledges 
the fact that software engineering changes not only from 
environment to environment, but also from project to project. 
If an information base is expected to truly mirror and sup- 
port a given software engineering project, it needs to be 
tailorable to the changing characteristics of the software 
project itself. The generator bases approach suggested by 
this project seems to be the natural approach to satisfy 
this important need. This paper discusses how to represent 
a set of software process and product type specifications in 
a database and how to use these to automatically generate 
database support for process executions and product in- 
stances. JAQ

engineering approaches and reusing software engineering 
related experience, cannot be achieved without having a 
specification of the objects to be improved. This paper 
discusses general requirements for software process speci- 
fication languages, presents. a first prototype software 
process specification language, demonstrates the application 
of this language and derives software engineering related 
requirements for a supporting information base. The actual 
efforts aimed at implementing these information base re-

process model is presented showing the use of the data 
model, and instances of the goal, question, metric paradigm 
are presented to show the applicability of the models to the 
measurement task. The model is validated by reference to 
published literature on resource data bases, and the impli- 
cations of the model in these data base environments is dis- 
cussed. SDB

5.26 MAINTENANCE = REUSE-ORIENTED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT . 

V. BASILI , TR-2244, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, TECHNICAL 

REPORT, MAY 1989, 12 PAGES 

This paper views maintenance as a reuse process and, in this 
context, discusses a set of models that can be used to sup- 
port the maintenance process. It presents a high-level re- 
use framework that characterizes the object of reuse, the 
process for adapting that object for its target application, 
and the reuse object within its target application. Based 
on this framework, a qualitative comparison is presented of 
the three maintenance process models, with regard to their 
strengths and weaknesses, and the circumstances in which 
they are appropriate. Providing a more systematic, quanti- 
tative approach for evaluating the appropriateness of the 
particular maintenance model, a measurement scheme, based on 
the reuse framework, is presented in the form of an orga- 
nized set of questions that need to be answered. A set of 
reuse enablers are discussed to support the reuse perspec- 
tive. SDB

5.27 SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT: A PARADIGM FOR THE FUTURE . 

V. BASILI, TR-2263 , UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, TECHNICAL 

REPORT, JUNE 1989, 29 PAGES 

This paper offers a new paradigm for software development 
that treats software development as an experimental activity. 
The paradigm provides built-in mechanisms for learning how 
to better develop software and for reusing experience in the 
forms of knowledge, processes, and products. Models and 
measures are used to aid in characterization, evaluation, 
and motivation. An organization scheme is proposed for se- 
parating the project-specific focus from the organization's 
learning and reuse focuses of software development. The 
paper discusses the implications of this approach for cor- 
porations, research, and education and presents some re- 
search activities currently underway at the University of 
Maryland that support this approach. SDB

both learning during the experiment and an awareness of the 
experimental process itself are examined in detail. Fully 
controlled experiments are especially -difficult to implement

WORKSHOP ON QUANTITATIVE SOFTWARE MODELS FOR RELI- 
ABILITY. COMPLEXITY. AND COST . NEW YORK: IEEE COM- 

PUTER SOCIETY PRESS, 1979, 10 PAGES 

This technical paper describes an approach to developing and 
evaluating automatable software measures. The experience of 
the SEL has shown that software data collection is an expen- 
sive activity that can significantly affect the software 
development process. Costs and effects can be minimized and 
data quality can be improved by automating the collection of 
measures wherever possible. 

This paper presents a set of automatable measures that were 
implemented and evaluated in a controlled experiment. The 
measures include computer job steps, program changes, pro- 
gram size, and software complexity. The results of the ex- 
periment indicate that the automated collection of these 
measures can be implemented effectively in production envi- 
ronments. JAO

This technical paper presents an examination of a set of 
basic relationships among various software development meas- 
ures, including size, effort, project duration, staff size, 
and productivity. Correlations among these measures are 
computed. The data used comes from 15 flight dynamics soft- 
ware development projects studied by the SEL. Certain rela- 
tionships are derived in the form of equations, and these 
equations are compared with a set derived by Walston and 
Felix for IBM Federal Systems Division project data. Loga- 
rithmic transformations were performed on the data for some 
analyses. Although the equations do not have the same coef- 
ficients, they are seen to have similar exponents. In fact, 
the SEL-derived equations tend to be within one standard 
error of the estimates provided in the IBM equations. JAO

This technical paper describes an effort to identify the 
best measures of software development effort and software 
complexity. Four software projects studied by the SEL pro- 
vide the data for the analysis. The data is screened to 
ensure its validity. Next, estimating equations are derived 
for effort and errors using the various measures studied in 
the analysis. Correlations are shown to increase as the 
reliability of the data increases due to screening. Thus, a 
procedure is demonstrated for removing noise from the data 
and making possible meaningful comparisons of software 
metrics. JAO

F. E. Me GARRY, SEPTEMBER 1982, VOL. 1: 143 PAGES, 

VOL. 2: 379 PAGES 

This two-volume document reports the results of an evalua- 
tion of a large set of software development measures rele- 
vant to the GSFC environment. The purposes of the analysis 
were to characterize the current software development proc- 
ess in one environment by identifying important qualities 
and corresponding measures and to evaluate the effectiveness 
of specific tools and techniques in this environment. The 
measures studied were counts, ratios, and management- 
supplied ratings of various elements of the software devel- 
opment process. The measures are high level in that each 
describes some aspect of an entire software project (or a 
large part of it) rather than individual components of the 
project . 

Volume 1 explains a conceptual model of software develop- 
ment, the data classification scheme, and the analytic pro- 
cedures. Factor analysis, cluster analysis, and a test of 
normality were used. This volume summarizes the results of 
those analyses and recommends specific software measures for 
collection and monitoring. Volume 1 also reproduces in full 
the results of the computer analyses. 

Volume 2 presents a detailed description of the data ana- 
lyzed, including definitions of measures, lists of values, 
and summary statistics. Although the information contained 
in Volume 2 was essential to the development of the explana- 
tion and summary presented in Volume 1, it is not essential 
to the understanding of that explanation and summary. How- 
ever, Volume 2 is useful in its own right as a source of 
data and a reference for future research. This document was

"METRIC ANALYSIS AND DATA VALIDATION ACROSS FORTRAN

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING . NOVEMBER 
1983 

This technical paper reports the results of an analysis of 
the relationship of Halstead measures, McCabe complexity 
measures, and other software measures to software develop- 
ment effort and errors. Effort is defined in terms of 
staff-hours from the establishing of functional specifica- 
tions through acceptance testing. Errors are counted dis- 
cretely and weighed according to effort to correct. The 
data studied was collected by the SEL in a production en- 
vironment. Cross-checks of the data indicated a need for 
large-scale data validation. The strongest correlations 
were obtained when the modules of individual programmers 
were considered independently. However, neither Halstead's 
effort measure, McCabe’s cyclomatic complexity measure, nor 
lines of source code was convincingly more accurate as an 
estimator than the others. This document was also issued as

This study analyzes the characteristics of a large sample of 
FORTRAN modules produced by professional programmers. The 
proper organization and content of a software module are 
basic concerns of software developers. Although many strat- 
egies and standards for software development are in use, few 
are based on any empirical evidence. The data studied was 
collected by the SEL. It includes error reports, staff 
charges, and source code measures. This study attempts to 
determine whether or not structural and quality differences 
exist among different classes of software and how knowledge 
of structural characteristics can be used to maximize soft- 
ware quality. JAO

6.14 STRUCTURAL COVERAGE OF FUNCTIONAL TESTING . TR-1442, 

V. R. BASILI AND J. RAMSEY, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, 
TECHNICAL REPORT, SEPTEMBER 1984 

This technical report describes a study directed at under- 
standing and improving the acceptance test process in the 
NASA/GSFC SEL environment. A large, commercially developed 
FORTRAN program was modified to produce structural coverage 
metrics. The modified program was executed on a set of 
functionally generated acceptance tests and a large sample 
of operational usage cases. The resulting structural cov- 
erage metrics are combined with fault and error data to 
evaluate structural coverage in the SEL environment. 

It is shown that, in this environment, the functionally gen- 
erated tests seem to be a good approximation of operational 
use. The relative proportions of the exercised statement 
subclasses (executable, assignment, CALL, DO, IF, READ, 
WRITE) change as the structural coverage of the program in- 
creases. A method is proposed for determining whether two 
sets of input data exercise a program in a similar manner. 

Evidence is also provided implying that, in this environ- 
ment, faults revealed in a procedure are independent of the 
number of times the procedure is executed and that it may be 
reasonable to use procedure coverage in software models that 
use statement coverage. Finally, the evidence suggests that 
it may be possible to use structural coverage to aid the 
management of the acceptance test process. SDB

NEW YORK: IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY PRESS, 1985, 6 PAGES 

This paper reports an attempt to determine the effectiveness 
of two widely used criteria for software modularization, 
strength and size, in reducing fault rate and development 
cost. The study was prompted by a central issue in prog- 
ramming practice that involves determining the appropriate 
size and information content of a software module. Data 
from 453 FORTRAN modules developed by professional program- 
mers were analyzed. The results indicated that module 
strength is a good criterion with respect to fault rate, 
whereas arbitrary module size limitations inhibit programmer 
productivity. This analysis is a first step toward defining 
empirically based standards for software modularization. JAO

This paper presents an approach for customizing a character-

cost/quality goals and production environments differ. The 
approach is applied in the SEL to 49 candidate process and 
product metrics of 652 modules from six projects (of 51,000 
to 112,000 lines). For this particular environment, the 
method yielded the characteristic metric set (source lines, 
fault correction effort per executable statement, design 
effort, code effort, number of I/O parameters, number of 
versions) . The uses examined for a characteristic metric 
set include forecasting the effort for development, modifi- 
cation, and fault correction of modules based on historical 
data. JAO

11 PAGES 

This paper describes a study on the impact of software 
structure on maintainability aspects such as comprehensibil- 
ity, locality, modifiability, and reusability in a distrib- 
uted system environment. The study was part of a project at 
the University of Kaiserslautern, West Germany, to design 
and implement LADY, a LAnguage for Distributed sYstems. The 
study addressed the impact of software structure from two 
perspectives : 

• The language designer’s perspective was to evaluate 
the general impact of the set of structural con- 
cepts chosen for LADY on the maintainability of 
software systems implemented in LADY. 

• The language user’s perspective was to derive 
structural criteria (metrics), measurable from LADY 
systems, that allow the explanation or prediction 
of the software maintenance behavior. 

A controlled maintenance experiment was conducted involving 
12 medium-sized distributed software systems; 6 of these 
systems were implemented in LADY, the other 6 systems in an 
extended version of seguential Pascal. The benefits of the 
structural LADY concepts were judged based on a comparison 
of the average maintenance behavior of the LADY systems and 
the Pascal systems; the maintenance metrics were derived by 
analyzing the interdependence between structure and mainte- 
nance behavior of each individual LADY system. JAO

6.21 TAME: INTEGRATING MEASUREMENT INTO SOFTWARE ENVIRON- 

MENTS , V. R. BASILI AND H. D. ROMBACH, TR-1764, 
UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, TECHNICAL REPORT, JUNE 1987, 

33 PAGES 

This paper describes the TAME project. Based upon a dozen 
years of analyzing software engineering processes and prod- 
ucts, we propose a set of software engineering process and 
measurement principles. These principles lead to the view 
that an integrated Software Engineering Environment (ISEE) 
should support multiple process models across the full soft- 
ware life cycle, the technical and management aspects of 
software engineering, and the planning, construction, and 
feedback and learning activities. These activities need to 
be tailored to the specific project under development, and 
they must be tractable for management control. The tailor- 
ability and tractability attributes require the support of a 
measurement process. The measurement process needs to be 
top-down, based upon operationally defined goals. 

The TAME project uses the goal/question/metric paradigm to 
support this type of measurement paradigm. It provides for 
the establishment of project-specific goals and corporate 
goals for planning software provides for the tracing of 
these goals throughout the life cycle via feedback and post 
mortem analysis, and offers a mechanism for long-range im- 
provement of all aspects of software development. 

The TAME system automates as much of this process as pos- 
sible by supporting goal development into measurement via 
models and templates, providing evaluation and analysis of 
the development and maintenance processes, and creating and 
using data bases of historical data and knowledge bases that 
incorporate experience from prior projects. SDB

that the waterfall model is not very realistic in practice, 
and that as technology introduces further perturbations to 
this model with concepts like executable specifications, 
rapid prototyping, and wide-spectrum languages, we need to 
modify our model of this process. JAO

This paper presents a conceptual model of software develop-

the published literature on necessary resource data for

presented here was developed using a top-down strategy. A 
resource data model is a prerequisite to the development of 
integrated project support environments that aim to assist 
in the processes of resource estimation, evaluation, and 
control. The model proposed is a four-dimensional view of 
resources that can be used for resource estimation, utiliza- 
tion, and review. This model is validated by reference to 
three publications on resource databases, and the implica- 
tions of the model arising out of these comparisons is dis- 
cussed. JAO

This paper presents and discusses the improvement-oriented 
software engineering process model underlying the TAME 
(Tailoring A Measurement Environment) project, its automated 
support by the TAME system, and the first TAME system proto- 
type. The TAME project at the University of Maryland 
involves the development of an improvement-oriented software 
engineering process model that uses the goal/question/metric 
paradigm to integrate the constructive and analytic aspects 
of software development. The model provides a mechanism for 
formalizing the characterization and planning tasks, con- 
trolling and improving projects based on quantitative analy- 
sis, learning in a deeper and more systematic way about the 
software process and product, and feeding the appropriate 
experience back into the current and future projects. 

The TAME system is an instantiation of the TAME software 
engineering process model as an ISEE (Integrated Software 
Engineering Environment) . The first in a series of TAME 
system prototypes has been developed. An assessment of 
experience with this first limited prototype is presented 
including a reassessment of its initial architecture. The 
long-term goal of this building effort is to develop a 
better understanding of appropriate ISEE architectures that 
optimally support the improvement-oriented TAME software 
engineering process model. JAO

6.25 "MEASURING SOFTWARE DESIGN COMPLEXITY," D. N. CARD AND 

W. W. AGRESTI, THE JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE . 

JUNE 1988, 13 PAGES 

This paper explains a new approach to measuring software 
design complexity that considers the structure of the over- 
all system as well as the Complexity incorporated in individ- 
ual components. Architectural design complexity derives from 
two sources: structural (or intermodule) complexity and 

local (or intramodule) complexity. These complexity attrib- 
utes can be defined in terms of functions of the number of 
input/output variables and fanout of the modules comprising 
the design. A complexity indicator based on these measures 
showed good agreement with a subjective assessment of design 
quality but even better agreement with an objective measure 
of software error rate. Although based on a study of only 
eight medium-scale scientific projects, the data strongly 
support the value of the proposed complexity measure in this 
context. Furthermore, graphic representations of the soft- 
ware designs demonstrate structural differences corresponding 
to the results of the numerical complexity analysis. The 
proposed complexity indicator seems likely to be a useful 
tool for evaluating design quality before committing the 
design to code. JAO

environments differed somewhat in their objectives and ap- 
proach to software development, the software produced by 
both groups was similar with respect to changes and errors. 
The results presented in this document include: (1) dis-

MENT CYCLE INTO THE TAME SYSTEM . V. BASILI AND 
T. SUNAZUKA, TR-2289, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, TECHNICAL 
REPORT, JULY 1989, 18 PAGES 

This paper discusses a metric setting procedure based on the 
Goal/Question/Metric (GQM) paradigm, a management system 
called the Software Management Cycle (SMC), and its applica- 
tion to a case study based on NASA/SEL data. The Tailoring 
A Measurement Environment (TAME) methodology, developed at 
the University of Maryland, is based on the improvement 
paradigm and the GQM paradigm. The Software Quality Mea- 
surement and Assurance Technology (SQMAT), developed at NEC 
Corporation, is a software quality metric system and meth- 
odology applied to the development processes. TAME and SQMAT 
methodologies are integrated to realize goal-oriented mea- 
surement, process control, and visual management. The SMC 
is a substantiation of these concepts. The paper also de- 
scribes a method for evaluating the SMC process. The ex- 
pected effects of SMC are quality improvement, managerial 
cost reduction, accumulation and reuse of experience, and a 
highly visual management reporting system. SDB

7.1 A DEMONSTRATION OF AXES FOR NAVPAK . SEL-77-004 , 

M. HAMILTON AND S. ZELDIN, SEPTEMBER 1977, 84 PAGES 

This document describes the results of a demonstration proj- 
ect employing a system specification language tool to 
respond to a flight dynamics software development require- 
ment. The tool, AXES, was developed by Higher Order 
Software, Inc. Specific areas were selected for the demon- 
stration from the NAVPAK software requirements. The com- 
plexity of these requirements and the effort required to 
obtain a full understanding of them prevented the develop- 
ment of a complete design within the demonstration period. 
This document describes the following aspects of the demon- 
stration project: 

• Principles of HOS/AXES 

• Description of NAVPAK 

• HOS/AXES representation of NAVPAK specifications

This document reports the results of an analysis of the ap- 
plicability of software specification and design languages 
to the development of flight dynamics software at GSFC. Two 
language systems were studied: HOS/AXES and PSL/PSA. The 

approach was to develop software designs, using each of 
these language systems, from the requirements of an already- 
implemented system. The results of the two methodologies 
were then compared with each other and with the actual de- 
sign implemented. This document was also issued as a Martin

This report presents the results of an assessment, from the 
software engineering point of view, of the Flight Dynamics 
Analysis System (FDAS) at one step in the requirements def- 
inition process— a prototype support environment. FDAS is 
intended to provide an integrated software development sup- 
port environment for research applications in the areas of 
orbit, attitude, and mission analysis, and it was conceived 
to assist users in the preparation, execution, and interpre- 
tation of software experiments. A prototype FDAS was con- 
structed to aid in clarifying the requirements for such a 
system and to test some concepts of language, software 
structure, and user interface designs. Part I of the report 
discusses the general approaches to FDAS adapted by the de- 
velopment team. Part II presents a detailed examination of 
some high-level FDAS design issues and summarizes some simi- 
lar systems from other environments. SDB

COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS CONFERENCE . 

NEW YORK: IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY PRESS, 1984, 5 PAGES 

This paper describes an attempt to assess the benefits and 
limitations of the application of independent verification 
and validation (IV&V) in the flight dynamics area at NASA/ 
GSFC. The SEL applied the IV&V methodology to two medium- 
sized flight dynamics software development projects. Then, 
to measure the effectiveness of the IV&V approach, the SEL 
compared these two projects with two similar past projects, 
using measures like productivity, reliability, and maintain- 
ability. Results indicated that the use of the IV&V method- 
ology did not help the overall process nor improve the 
product in these cases. JAO

7.11 "ANALYZING THE TEST PROCESS USING STRUCTURAL COVERAGE," 
J. RAMSEY and V. R. BASILI, PROCEEDINGS OF THE EIGHTH 
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING . 

NEW YORK: IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY PRESS, 1985, 7 PAGES 

This paper reports the results of a study to understand and 
improve the acceptance test process in the SEL environment. 

An SEL program, the MAL language preprocessor (a subset of a 
satellite attitude maintenance system), has been modified to 
produce structural coverage metrics. It was modified to 
measure both procedure coverage and statement coverage. 
Coverage is also computed for several statement subclasses. 
The modified program was executed on a set of functionally 
generated acceptance tests and a large sample of operational 
usage cases. The resulting structural coverage metrics are 
combined with fault and error data to evaluate structural 
coverage in the SEL environment. 

It is shown that, in this environment, the functionally gen- 
erated tests seem to be a good approximation of operational 
use. The relative proportions of the exercised statement 
subclasses change as the structural coverage of the program 
increases. A method is proposed for evaluating whether two 
sets of input data exercise a program in a similar manner. 
Evidence also shows that (1) faults revealed in a procedure 
are independent of the number of times the procedure is 
executed and (2) it may be reasonable to use procedure cov- 
erage in software models that use statement coverage. Fi- 
nally, the evidence suggests that it may be possible to use 
structural coverage to aid in managing the acceptance test 
process. JAO

THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND PRODUCT, " 

F. E. Me GARRY, J. VALETT, AND D. HALL, PROCEEDINGS 
OF THE HAWAII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM 
SCIENCES . JANUARY 1985, 9 PAGES 

This study examined the relationship between computer re- 
sources and the software development process and product as 
exemplified by NASA/GSFC data. Data have been extracted and 
examined from nearly 50 software development projects vary- 
ing in size from 3,000 to 130,000 lines of code. All have 
been related to the support of satellite flight dynamics 
ground-based computations. As a result of changing situa- 
tions and technology, the computer support environment has 
varied widely. Some projects enjoyed fast response time, 
excess memory, and state-of-the-art tools, whereas others 
endured slow computer response time, archaic tool support, 
and limited terminal access to the development machine. 

Based on the results of this study, a number of computer- 
resource-related implications are provided. JAO

7.13 COMPARISON OF SOFTWARE VERIFICATION TECHNIQUES . 

SEL-85-001, D. N. CARD, R. W. SELBY, F. E. Me GARRY, 

ET AL., APRIL 1985, 90 PAGES 

This document describes a controlled experiment performed by 
the SEL to compare the effectiveness of code reading, func- 
tional testing, and structural testing as software verifica- 
tion techniques. It is one of a series of three experiments 
organized by R. W. Selby as part of his doctoral disserta- 
tion. The experiment results indicate that code reading 
provides the greatest error detection capability at the 
lowest cost, whereas structural testing is the least effec- 
tive technique. This document explains the experiment plan, 
describes the experiment results, and discusses related re- 
sults from other studies. It also considers the application 
of these results to the development of software in the flight 
dynamics environment. Appendixes summarize the experiment 
data and list the test programs. A separate Data Supplement 
contains original materials collected from the participants.

This document describes a seven-step approach for quanti- 
tatively evaluating software technologies, coupling software 
methodology evaluation with software measurement. The 
approach is applied in depth in the following three areas: 

• Software Testing Strategies — A 74-subject study, 
including 32 professional programmers and 42 advanced uni- 
versity students, compared code reading, functional testing, 
and structural testing in a fractional factorial design. 

• Cleanroom Software Development — Fifteen 3-person 
teams separately built a 1200-line message system to compare 
Cleanroom software development (in which software is devel- 
oped completely off line) with a more traditional approach. 

• Characteristic Software Metric Sets — : In the SEL 
production environment, a study of 65 candidate product and 
process measures of 652 modules from 6 projects of 51,000 to 
112,000 lines yielded a characteristic set of software 
cost/quality metrics. SDB

TION (IV&V) METHODOLOGY FOR FLIGHT DYNAMICS . 

SEL-81-110 , G. PAGE, F. E. Me GARRY, AND D. N. CARD, 
JUNE 1985, 53 PAGES 

This document describes an experiment in the application of 
an independent verification and validation (IV&V) methodol- 
ogy to the development of flight dynamics software at GSFC. 
IV&V is the systematic evaluation of computer software by an 
organization that is independent of the development organi- 
zation. IV&V is expected to provide earlier error detection 
and better quality control over the development process. 

This document describes the environment, staffing, and re- 
sults of the experiment. Costs and error rates are compared 
with those of similar projects developed without IV&V. An 
IV&V methodology is found to be appropriate for very large 
projects and for those with high reliability requirements.

This paper presents a paradigm for evaluating software de- 
velopment methods and tools. The basic idea is to generate 
a set of goals that are refined into quantifiable questions. 
These questions specify the metrics to be collected on the 
software development and maintenance process and product. 

The metrics can be used to characterize, evaluate, predict, 
and motivate. They can be used in an active as well as pas- 
sive way by learning from analyzing the data and applying 
what is learned to improving the methods and tools employed 
in practice. Several examples were given representing each 
of the different approaches to evaluation. JAO

OCTOBER 1985, 6 PAGES 

This paper describes an ongoing technology evaluation pro- 
gram conducted by the SEL that is intended to resolve cer- 
tain issues in the application of tools, practices, and 
techniques by software developers. A wealth of potentially 
beneficial software engineering tools, practices, and tech- 
niques has emerged in the past several years. Simulta- 
neously, realization has grown that all software engineering 
technologies are not equally effective for all software de- 
velopment problems and environments. The steps to tech- 
nology improvement include measurement, evaluation, and 
transference. The SEL collects measures on the production 
of FORTRAN software for spacecraft navigation systems. Re- 
cent SEL investigations demonstrated that the use of struc- 
tured programming and quality assurance improves software 
reliability. Also, intensive computer use appears to be 
associated with low productivity. However, the major factor 
in both productivity and reliability continues to be per- 
sonnel capability. Such technology evaluation programs pro- 
vide an empirical basis for defining software development 
standards and selecting tools. JAO

This paper reports the results of an empirical study of 
software design practices in one specific environment. The 
practices examined affect module size, module strength, data 
coupling, descendant span, unreferenced variables, and soft- 
ware reuse. Measures characteristic of these practices were 
extracted from 887 FORTRAN modules developed for five flight 
dynamics software projects monitored by the Software Engi- 
neering Laboratory. The relationship of these measures to 
cost and fault rate was analyzed using a contingency table 
procedure. The results show that some recommended design 
practices , despite their intuitive appeal, are ineffective 
in this environment, whereas others are very effective. JAO

JULY 1986, 12 PAGES 

This paper presents a procedure for evaluating a software 
prototype. The need to assess the prototype itself arises 
from the use of prototyping to demonstrate the feasibility 
of a design or development strategy. The assessment proce- 
dure can also be of use in deciding whether to evolve a pro- 
totype into a complete system. The procedure consists of 
identifying evaluation criteria, defining alternative design 
approaches, and ranking the alternatives according to the 
criteria. JAO

12 PAGES 

This report provides an evaluation of the use of expert sys- 
tems for software engineering management. Although the 
field of software engineering is relatively new, it can 
benefit from the use of expert systems. Four prototype ex- 
pert systems have been developed to aid in software engi- 
neering management. Given the values for certain metrics, 
these systems will provide interpretations that explain any 
abnormal patterns of these values during the development of 
a software project. The four expert systems, which solve 
the same problem, were built using two different approaches 
to knowledge acquisition, a bottom-up approach and a top- 
down approach, and two different expert system methods, 
rule-based deduction and frame-based abduction. A compari- 
son was performed to see which methods best suit the needs 
of this field. It was found that the bottom-up approach led 
to better results than did the top-down approach, and the 
rule-based deduction systems using simple rules provided 
more complete and correct solutions than did the frame-based 
abduction systems. JAO

STUDY, " M. V. ZELKOWITZ, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 26TH ANNUAL 
TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM OF THE WASHINGTON. D.C.. CHAPTER OF 
THE ACM . JUNE 1987, 9 PAGES 

This paper discusses resource utilization over the life 
cycle of software development, and discusses the role that 
the current "waterfall model" plays in the actual software 
life cycle. The effects of prototyping are measured with 
respect to the life cycle model. Software production in the 
NASA environment was analyzed to measure these differences. 
The data collected from 13 different projects and 1 proto- 
type development were collected by the Software Engineering 
Laboratory and analyzed for similarities and differences. 

The results indicate that the waterfall model is not very 
realistic in practice and that a prototype development fol- 
lows a similar life cycle as a production system. JAO

evaluating the effectiveness of technologies, and evaluate 
the effects of some specific technologies on productivity 
and reliability. A carefully matched sample of 22 projects 
from the SEL data base was studied using an analysis-of- 
covariance procedure. Limited use of the technologies con- 
sidered in the analysis produced approximately a 30-percent 
increase in software reliability. These technologies did 
not demonstrate any direct effect on development produc- 
tion. JAO

SEPTEMBER 1987, 11 PAGES 

This paper discusses a study aimed at the improvement of 
measurement and evaluation procedures used in an industrial 
maintenance environment. The following topics are discussed: 

• General measurement, evaluation, and improvement 
goals important to this environment 

• A set of metrics derived for quantifying those goals 

• Suggested changes to the current data collection 
procedures 

• Preliminary analysis results based on a limited set 
of already available data 

• Ideas for automating the proposed quantitative 
assessment approach 

This paper emphasizes the steps of introducing such a quan- 
titative maintenance approach into an industrial setting 
rather than the environment-specific analysis results. The 
analysis results are intended to demonstrate the practical 
applicability and feasibility of the proposed methodology 
for evaluating and improving maintenance aspects in an 
industrial environment. JAO

7.25 "COMPARING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SOFTWARE TESTING 
STRATEGIES," V. R. BASILI AND R. W. SELBY, IEEE 
TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING . DECEMBER 1987, 

60 PAGES 

This study applies an experimentation methodology to compare 
three state-of-the-practice software testing techniques: 

(1) code reading by stepwise abstraction, (2) functional 
testing using equivalence partitioning and boundary value 
analysis, and (3) structural testing using 100-percent 
statement coverage criteria. The study compares the strat- 
egies in three aspects of software testing: fault detection 

effectiveness, fault detection cost, and classes of faults 
detected. Thirty-two professional programmers and 42 ad- 
vanced students applied the 3 techniques to 4 unit-sized 
programs in a fractional factorial experimental design. The 
major results of this study are the following. 

• With the professional programmers, code reading 
detected more software faults and had a higher fault detec- 
tion rate than functional or structural testing did, while 
functional testing detected more faults than structural 
testing did, but functional and structural testing were not 
different in fault detection rate. 

• In one advanced student subject group, code reading 
and functional testing were not different in faults found 
but were both superior to structural testing, while in the 
other advanced student subject group there was no difference 
among the techniques. 

• With the advanced student subjects, the three 
techniques were not different in fault detection rate. 

• Number of faults observed, fault detection rate, 
and total effort in detection depended on the type of 
software tested.

• Functional testing detected more control faults 
than the other methods did. 

• When asked to estimate the percentage of faults 
detected, code readers gave the most accurate estimates whil 
functional testers gave the least accurate estimates. SDB

tively named ARROWSMITH-P. ARROWSMITH-P is intended to aid 
the manager of a software development project in an auto- 
mated manner. The systems work as follows. First, it is 
determined whether a software project is following normal 
development patterns by comparing measures such as pro- 
grammer hours per line of source code against historical, 
environment-specific baselines of such measures. The 
"manifestations" detected by this comparison, such as an 
abnormally high rate of programmer hours per line of source 
code, then serve as input to each expert system. Finally, 
each system attempts to determine the reasons, such as low 
productivity, for any abnormal software development pat- 
terns. These systems can be updated as the environment 
changes and as more is learned in the field of software 
engineering . 

The two systems, which solve the same problem, were built 
using different methods: rule-based deduction and frame- 

based abduction. A comparison was performed to determine 
which method better suits the needs of this field. It was 
found that both systems performed moderately well, but the 
rule-based deduction system using simple rules provided more 
complete solutions than did the frame-based abduction sys- 
tem. JAO

SYMPOSIUM ON ADA FOR THE NASA SPACE STATION . JUNE 1986,

This paper compares a FORTRAN-or iented and an Ada-oriented 
design for the same system to learn whether an essentially 
different design was produced using Ada. The designs were 
produced by an experiment that involves the parallel devel- 
opment of software for a spacecraft dynamics simulator. 
Design differences are identified in the use of abstrac- 
tions, system structure, and simulator operations. Although 
the designs were significantly different, this result may be 
influenced by some special characteristics discussed in the 
paper. JAO

METHODOLOGY," E. SEIDEWITZ AND M. STARK, PROCEEDINGS

NASA SPACE STATION . JUNE 1986, 14 PAGES 

This paper presents an overview of a general approach that 
allows a designer to apply powerful, object-oriented prin- 
ciples to a wide range of applications at all stages of 
design. Object-oriented design is the technique of using 
objects (abstract software models of problem domain enti- 
ties) as the basic units of modularity in system design. 

This method is discussed in terms of the identification of 
objects, object diagrams, the principles of abstractions and 
information hiding, and hierarchies (parent-child, and 
seniority). This paper also considers how object-oriented 
designs fits into the overall software life-cycle. JAO

The effective use of Ada™ requires the adoption of modern 
software-engineering techniques such as object-oriented 
methodologies. A Goddard Space Flight Center Software Engi- 
neering Laboratory Ada pilot project has provided an oppor- 
tunity for studying object-oriented design in Ada. The 
project involves the development of a simulation system in 
Ada in parallel with a similar FORTRAN development. As part 
of the project, the Ada development team trained and eval- 
uated object-oriented and process-oriented design method- 
ologies for Ada. Finding these methodologies limited in 
various ways, the team created a general object-oriented 
development methodology which they applied to the project. 
This paper discusses some background on the development of 
the methodology, describes the main principles of the ap- 
proach and presents some experiences with using the method- 
ology, including a general comparison of the Ada and FORTRAN 
simulator designs. JAO

Ada to develop flight dynamics software and to assess the 
effect of Ada on the flight dynamics environment. This ex- 
periment consists of nea r— pa r a 1 le 1 developments of a dynamics 
simulator in both FORTRAN and Ada. A study team consisting 
of members from the SEL has monitored development progress

NOVEMBER 1988, 26 PAGES 

This paper discusses the impact that the Ada language and 
design methodologies that utilize its features have on the 
system test phase of the software development project life 
cycle. It is one of a series of lessons-learned reports 
examining each development phase. It evaluates the impact 
of the use of Ada when compared to FORTRAN in the system 
test phases of two projects. The paper concludes that 
although planning for system testing and conducting system 
tests were not generally affected by the use of Ada, the 
solving of problems found in system testing was generally 
facilitated by Ada constructs and design methodology. Most 
problems found in system testing were not due to difficulty 
with the language or methodology but rather due to lack of 
experience with the application. NSTF

The SEL performs studies and measurement related to evolving 
software technologies. The studies are aimed at understand-

that evolving software practices may have on the software 
process and product. The SEL has conducted over 65 experi- 
ments by applying selected techniques to specific develop- 
ment efforts and measuring the resulting process and product. 

This paper analyzes the findings of an effort the SEL ini- 
tiated in early 1985 to study the characteristics, applica- 
tions, and impacts of Ada. Beginning with a relatively 
small practice problem (6,000 source lines of Ada), the SEL 
has collected detailed development data from a total of 
eight Ada projects (some of which are ongoing). The proj- 
ects range in size from 6,000 lines to approximately 
160,000 lines of code. JAO

8.23 "USING ADA TO MAXIMIZE VERBATIM SOFTWARE REUSE, " 

M. STARK AND E. BOOTH, PROCEEDINGS OF TRI-ADA 1989. 

OCTOBER 1989, 13 PAGES 

This paper presents the lessons learned on several simulator 
projects in the Flight Dynamics Division (FDD) environment 
that exploit features of the Ada language, such as packages 
and generics, to achieve verbatim reuse. Verbatim reuse 
means that no changes are made to the component. These 
simulators are divided into two separate, but related, prob- 
lem domains, dynamics simulators, and telemetry simulators. 
FDD began using Ada in 1985 with the development of the 
Gamma Ray Observatory attitude dynamics simulator (GRODY) . 
Since that time, six additional simulator projects have been 
started. With each successive project, a concentrated ef- 
fort is made to use the lessons learned from previous Ada 
simulator development projects. 

This paper focuses on the concepts used in the projects that 
have had the most impact on verbatim software reuse in the 
FDD environment: GRODY, the Upper Atmosphere Research 

Satellite Telemetry Simulator (UARSTELS) , and the Generic 
Dynamics and Telemetry Simulator (GENSIM) . This paper de- 
fines underlying design principles, discusses how Ada fea- 
tures support these principles for reuse in the small, and 
shows how these principles are used to achieve reuse in the 
large. Finally, this paper presents supporting data from 
current reusability results. JAO

This document describes a case study performed at GSFC, in 
which two dynamics satellite simulators were developed from 
the same requirements, one in Ada and the other in FORTRAN. 
The purpose of the research was to find out how well the 
prescriptive Ada development model worked to develop the Ada 
simulator. The FORTRAN simulator development, as well as 
past FORTRAN developments, provided a baseline for compari- 
son. Since this was the first simulator developed here, the 
prescriptive Ada development model had many similarities to 
the usual FORTRAN development model. However, it was modi- 
fied to include longer design and shorter testing phases, 
which is generally expected with Ada developments. This

9.7 A METHODOLOGY FOR COLLECTING VALID SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 
DATA . V. R. BASILI AND D. M. WEISS, UNIVERSITY OF 
MARYLAND, TECHNICAL REPORT, DECEMBER 1982, 22 PAGES 

This technical report describes an effective data collection 
method for evaluating software methodologies and for study- 
ing the software development process. The purpose of the 
report is to show how to obtain valid data that may be used 
both to learn more about the software development process 
and to evaluate software development methodologies in a pro- 
duction environment. The data collected during the study 
describes changes made to the software during development 
and is obtained when the changes are made. To ensure ac- 
curacy of the data, validation is performed concurrently 
with software development as part of the data collection 
process. Validation is based on interviews with the pro- 
grammers supplying the data. The feasibility of the data

"A METHODOLOGY FOR COLLECTING VALID SOFTWARE ENGINEER- 
ING DATA, " V. R. BASILI AND D. M. WEISS, IEEE TRANS- 
ACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING . NOVEMBER 1984, 

11 PAGES 

This paper describes an effective data collection method for 
evaluating software development methodologies and studying 
the software development process. The method uses goal- 
directed data collection to evaluate methodologies with 
respect to the claims made for them. Such claims are used 
as a basis for defining the goals of the data collection, 
establishing a list of questions of interest to be answered 
by data analysis, defining a set of data categorization 
schemes, and designing a data collection form. 


The data to be collected are based on the changes made to 
the software during development and are obtained when the 
changes are made. To ensure accuracy of the data, valida- 
tion is performed concurrently with software development and 
data collection. Validation is based on interviews with 
those people supplying the data. Results from using the 
methodology show that data validation is a necessary part of 
change data collection. Without it, as much as 50 percent 
of the data may be erroneous. 


Feasibility of the data collection methodology was demon- 
strated by applying it to five different projects in two 
different environments. The application showed that the 
methodology was both feasible and useful. JAO
