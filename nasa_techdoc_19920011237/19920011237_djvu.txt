Abstract 



A laboratory experiment was conducted to quantify the annoyance 
response of people on the ground to en route noise generated by aircraft 
at cruise conditions. The en route noises were ground-level recordings of 
eight advanced turboprop aircraft flyovers and six conventional turbofan 
flyovers. The eight advanced turboprop en route noises represented 
the NASA Propfan Test Assessment aircraft operating at different 
combinations of altitude, aircraft Mach number, and propeller tip speed. 
The conventional turbofan en route noises represented six different 
commercial airliners. The overall durations of the en route noises 
varied froTH approximately 40 to 160 sec. In the experiment, 32 subjects 
judged the annoyance of the en route noises as well as recordings of 
both the takeoff and landing noises of each of 5 conventional turboprop 
and 5 conventional turbofan aircraft. Each of the noises was presented 
at three sound pressure levels to the subjects in an anechoic listening 
room. Analyses of the judgments found small differences in annoyance 
between three combinations of aircraft type and operation. Current tone 
and duration corrections did not significantly improve en route noise 
annoyance prediction. The optimum duration- correction magnitude 
for en route noise was approximately 1 dB per doubling of effective 
duration. 



Introduction 



Concerns about the impact of aircraft noise on 
people have traditionally centered around the take- 
off and landing operations of aircraft in the vicinity 
of airport terminals. The development of advanceid 
turboprop (propfan) propulsion systems, modifica- 
tions to air corridors, and the desire to maintain 
a natural environment in national parks and recre- 
ation area-s have now focused attention on the im- 
pact at ground level of the en route noise produced 
by aircraft at cruise conditions and altitudes (ref. 1). 
Compared with terminal-area noise (i.e., takeoff and 
landing noise), en route noise is characterized by rel- 
atively low noise levels, a lack of high-frequency spec- 
tral content, and long durations. Much research has 
been directed towards understanding and quantifying 
the amioyance caused by terminal-area aircraft noise, 
but relatively little research has been conducted for 
en route noise. 

To address this need, a laboratory experiment was 
conducted to quantify the annoyance response of peo- 
ple on the ground to en route noise generated by 
aircraft at cruise conditions. The specific objectives 
were: (1) to compare the annoyance responses to en 
route noise with the annoyance responses to takeoff 
and landing noise; (2) to compare the annoyance re- 
sponses to en route noise of advanced turboprop air- 
craft with the annoyance responses to en route noise 
of conventional turbofan aircraft; (3) to determine 
the ability of current aircraft noise measurement 



procedures and corrections to predict armoyance to 
en route noise; and (4) to determine whether modifi- 
cations to the duration-correction method would im- 
prove the prediction of annoyance to en route noise.

Experimental Method 

Test Facility 

Th(> anechoic listening room in the Langley 
Acoustics Research Laboratory (fig. 1) was used ius 
the test facility in the experiment. This room, which 
has a vohune of 20 nr' and an A- weighted ambient 
noise k;vel of 15 dB, provides an essentially echo-free 
environment. This environment minimizes the i)os- 
sibility of standing waves affecting the data. The 
monophonic recordings of the aircraft noise stinuili 
were played on a studio-quality tape recorder using 



a noise reduction system to reduce tape hiss. The 
commercially available noise reduction system, which 
provided a nominal 30-dB increase in signal-to-noise 
ratio, reduced tape hiss to inaudible levels. The stim- 
uli were presented to the subjects using a special 
speaker system consisting of one high-frequency unit 
and one low-frequency unit. The higli-frec}uency imit 
had a frequency range of 100 Hz to 10 000 Hz, and the 
low-frequency unit had a frecjuency range of 30 Hz to 
100 Hz. 

Test Subjects 

Thirty-two subjects were randomly selected from 
a pool of local residents with a widt; range of socio- 
economic backgrounds and were paid to participate; 
in the experiment. All test subjects were given 
audiograms prior to the experiment to verify normal 
hearing. Table I gives the sex and age data for the 
subjects in each experiment. 

Noise Stimuli 

The noise stimuli us(;d in the experiment consisted 
of loudspeaker-reproduc(;d recordings of actual flight 
operations. Thirty-four noises were pr(;sented to the 
test subjects at three nominal Lf) levels of GO, 70, 
and 80 dB. Six additional presentations of a reference 
noise were included for a total of 108 noise stimuli. 
The 34 noises consisted of 8 advanced turboprop 
en route noises, 6 conventional turbofan en route 
noises, 10 (â€¢onv(!ntional turboprop take<jff and landing 
noises, and 10 conventional turbofan takeoff and 
landing noises. 

Advanced turboprop en route noises. The 

eight advanced turboprop en route noises were 
recordings of the NASA Propfan Tt-st Assessment 
(PTA) aircraft shown in figure 2. The PTA air- 
craft is a modified Gulfstream Aerospace Gil with 
an advanced turboprop engine installed on the port 
wing. The advanc(;d turboprop (;onsisted of a single- 
rotating, 8-l)la(le, 9-ft-diameter propfan driven by 
a modified indiistrial gas turbine^ engine through a 
modified reduction gearbox (ref. 4). The recordings 
were obtained by using gromid-l<>vel microphones 
during lev(;l fiyover at cruise^ conditions with the air- 
craft's original c;ngin(>s operating at fiight idle. The 
eight noises used in the experinu-nt repr(;sent the dif- 
f(;rent combinations of altitude, aircraft Mac;h num- 
ber, and propeller tip speed shown in table U. The 
overall durations of the 8 noises used in the exj)eri- 
ment varied from approximately 40 to 160 sec. The 
variations in duration resulted from the variations in 
altitude and Mach number and from the truncation 
of the beginning and ending of some nois(>s neces- 
sitated by extraneous transient ba(;kground noises. 



The Lj[ time histories and the 1/3-octave-batul spec- 
tra at peak Lj[ of the highest level presentations of 
the udvanced turboprop en route noises are given in 
fig\ire 3. 



Conventional turbofan en route noises. The 

six c(jnventioiial turbofan en route noises were record- 
ings of commercial airliners made with groinid-lcvel 
microphones. Table III provides the type of aircraft, 
altitude, and speed for each noise;. The overall du- 
rations of the six noises varied from approximately 
40 to 160 sec. As with the advanced turboprop 
en route noises, the begimiing and ending of some 
noises were trun(-ated because of extraneous tran- 
sient background noise. The L,^ time histori(>s and 
the 1/3-octave-band spcc:tra at i)eak L4 of the high- 
est level pres(!ntation (jf the conventional turbofan 
en route noises are giv(>n in figure 4. 

Takeoff and landing noises. Recordings of 
both the takeoff and landing of each of five conven- 
tional turboprop and five conventional turbofan air- 
craft were inchided in the experinunit for comi)arison 
with the en route noise stimuli. The types of air- 
craft used and .some specihcations of each are given 
in table IV. The recordings of the conventional tur- 
bofan aircraft were made on the centerline of the ex- 
tended runway approximately 5000 m from the brake 
release point. The conventional turboprop aircraft 
recordings were made at several different airports, 
and the distances from the brake rek-ase point var- 
ied. At each location, the turboprop aircraft record- 
ings were mad<> on or near the centerline of the ex- 
tended runway. Because of the higher Hight profiles 
and lower source noise levels of the turboprop air- 
craft, the recording sites for the turboprop aircraft 
were located clos(!r to the brake release point than 
those for the turbofan aircraft. Microphones were lo- 
cated approximately 1.2 m above ground level over 
dirt or grass. The overall durations of the 20 noises 
varied from approximately 10 to 50 sec. The L^ 
tim(> histories and the 1/3-octave-band spectra at 
peak L^ of the highest levt;! presentations of the take- 
off and landing of each conventional turboprop and 
conventional turbofan are given in figures 5 and 6, 
respectively. 

Reference noise. In addition to the three pre- 
.sentations made as part of the conventional turbofan 
takeoff stimuli, the Boeing 727 takeoff recording was 
presented at six other Lp levels of 50, 55, 65, 75, 
85, and 90 dB. As a result of these additional pre- 
sentations, a total of nine Boeing 727 takeoff stimuli. 



ranging in Lp levels from 50 to 90 dB in 5-dB incre- 
ments, were presented to th(> test subjects. These 
nine stimuli were used as r(>fen-nc(- stinmli in the 
analyses to convert subjective responses to subjec- 
tive decibel levels. 

Experiment Design 

Numerical category scaling was chosen as the p.sy- 
chopfiysical method for the experiment. The choice 
was made to maximize the number of stimuli that 
could be judged in the fixed amount of time available. 
The scale selected was a unipolar, 11-point scale from 
to 10. The end points of the scale were labeled "EX- 
TRP:MELY ANNOYING" and "NOT ANNOYING 
AT ALL." The term "ANNOYING" was defined in 
the subject instructions as "UNWANTED, OBJEC- 
TIONABLE, DISTURBING, OR UNPLEASANT." 

The stinmli wer(> divided into two .sets of four 
tapes. The first set of tapes <-ontained all the stim- 
uli in the experiment. The second set contained the 
same stimuli as the first but in reverse order. There 
were 27 stinmli per tape. The stimuli were divid(-d 
between tap(>s so that each aircraft type, aircraft oj)- 
eration, and soimd level were about equally rcjire- 
sented on each tai)(\ The order of tlu- stimuli on 
the tai)e was then randomly selected. Tlu- ord(Ts for 
each tape are given in table V, as indicated by the 
arrows. A period of approximately 10 sec was pro- 
vided after earti stimulus for the subjects to make 
and record their judgments. Each tajjc served as one 
of four test sessions for the subjects and recjuired ap- 
proximately -10 nun for playback. 

The 32 test su})jects in the (>xi)erim<>nt were di- 
vid(>d into 16 groups of 2 subjects. The first four 
tapes were presented to eight groups of subjects, and 
the second four tapes were i)resented to the other 
eight groups of subjects. T(j prevent subject fatigue 
and other temporal effects from unduly influencing 
the results, the order in which the tapes were pn>- 
sented was varied to provide a balanced presentation. 
Table VI gives the order of prest-ntation us(xl for the 
tapes in the experiment. 

Procedure 

Upon arrival at the laboratory, the subjects were 
seated in the test facility and each was given a set 
of instructions and a consent form. Copies of these 
items are given in the appendix. After reading the 
instructions and completing the consent forin.s, the 
subjects were given a brief verbal explanation of the 
cards used for recording judgments and were asked 
if they had any questions. Four practice stimuli 
were then presented to the subjects while the test 



conductor remained in the test facility. In order for 
the subjects to gain experience in scoring the sounds, 
they were instructed to make and record judgments 
of tht> practice stinuih. After asking again for any 
questions about the test, the test conductor issued 
scoring cards for the first session and left the facility. 
Then, the first of four test sessions began. After 
the conclusion of each session, the test conductor 
reentered the test facility, collected the scoring cards, 
and issued new scoring cards for the next session. 
Between the second and third sessions, the subjects 
were given a 15-min rest period outside the test 
facility. 

Results and Discussion 

Acoustic Data Analyses 

Each noise stimulus was analyzed to provide 
1/3-octave-baiid sound pressure levels from 20 Hz 
to 20 kHz for use in computing a selected grouj) of 
noise metrics. The measurements were made with a 
1.27-cm-diamcter condenser microphone and a real- 
time. 1/3-octave analysis system that used digital fil- 
tering. The microphone was located at car level mid- 
way between the two seats. No subjects were present 
during the measurements. A total of five noise met- 
rics were computed in the analyses. They included 
the simple weighting procedures L4 and Lp and the 
more complex calculation procedures LL^, PL, and 
PNL. 

Twelve variatitjiis of each of the five noise metrics 
were calculated. The first was the peak or maximum 
level that occurred during the flyover noise. Two 
oth(-r variations were calculated by applying two dif- 
ferent tone corrections. Nine more variations were 
attained by applying duration corrections ba^sed on 
three different integration periods to the non-tone- 
corrected level and the two tone-corrected levels. The 
first duration-correction integration period Dio and 
the first tone correction Ti are identical to those used 
in the eflcctive perceived noise level procedure de- 
fined in the Federal Aviation Administration FAR 36 
regulation (ref. 2). The second tone correction T2 is 
identical to the first except that no corrections are 
applied for tones identified in bands with center fre- 
quencies less than 500 Hz. The second and third 
duration-correction integration periods 1^15 and D20 
are identical to the first except that the duration cor- 
rection is based on an integration of the energy be- 
tween the 15- and 20-dB down points of the noise 
instead of the 10-dB down points. 

Subjective Data Analyses 

The means (across subjects) of the judgments 
were calculated for each stimulus in the experiment. 



To obtain a subjective scale with meaningful Tuiits 
of measure, these mean annoyance scores were con- 
verted to subjective noise levels L5 with decibel-like 
properties by the following process. Included in the 
experiment for the purpose of converting the mean 
annoyance scores to Lg values were nine presenta- 
tions of a Boeing 727 takeoff recording. The Lp lev- 
els of the nine presentations were 50, 55, 60, 65, 70. 
75, 80, 85, and 90 dB. Third-order polynonnal re- 
gression analyses were performed on data obtained 
for these nine reference stimuli. The dependent vari- 
able waa the calculated PNL, and the independent 
variable was the mean annoyance score for each of the 
inne reference stinmli. Figure 7 presents the data and 
the resTilting best-fit curve. The regression equation 
was then used to predict the level of the Boeing 727 
takeoff noise that would produce the same mean an- 
noyance score as each of the other noise stinmli in 
the experiment. These levels were then considered 
as the subjective noise level for each stimulus. 

Comparison of Aircraft Types and 
Operations 

Figure 8 compares the annoyance responses to 
PTA aircraft at cruise, conventional turbofan aircraft 
at cruise, and conventional turboprop and turbofan 
aircraft takeoffs and landings. The figure plots sub- 
jective noise level versus L 4 for each of the three com- 
binations of aircraft type and operation. Simple lin- 
ear regression lines for each of the three combinations 
are also shown. For a given value of L.4. the conven- 
tional turbofan cruise noises were slightly more an- 
noying than the PTA cruise noises. Although the dif- 
ferences in annoyance arc small, indicator (dummy) 
variable analyses for L^ show significant differences 
in slope and intercept between the appropriate re- 
gressions for the three sets of noises. Figure 9 uses 
diiration-corrected L 4 to compare the annoyance re- 
sponses to PTA aircraft at cruise, conventional tur- 
bofan aircraft at cruise, and conventional turboprop 
and turbofan aircraft takeoff's and landings. When 
duration corrections are added to L,4, the conven- 
tional turbofan cruise noises are slightly less annoy- 
ing than the PTA cruise noises. This is the reverse of 
the results shown in figure 8 for L 4 without duration 
corrections. As in the previous figure, indicator vari- 
able analyses indicate significant differences in slope 
and intercept between the appropriate regressions for 
the three types of noises. Figure 10 uses EPNL to 
compare the annoyance responses to PTA aircraft at 
cruise, conventional turbofan aircraft at cruise, and 
conventional turboprop and turbofan aircraft take- 
offs and landings. Results are similar to those for 
duration-corrected L 4 in figure 9. 



Figures 8 to 10 compare the tlir(>e ronihinatioiis 
of aircraft tyjx' and oi)eration in tcriiiK of tlircjc 
(XHiirrioiily used noise iiieasur(>ni(!nts L4, duration- 
corr<x'tcd L^. and EPNL. Comparisons using the 
other combinations of noise measurement proeedur(!s 
and corrections yielded similar results. Small, but 
significant, difl^erences in annoyance resj)onse were 
found b(;twc!en the PTA advanced turbojirop en route 
noises, the conventional turbofan en ro\ite noises, 
and the conventional turboprop and turbofan take- 
off and landing noises. However, the difference in 
annoyanc(> r(>sponse between the PTA advanced tur- 
l)0]>rop en route noises and the conventional turbo- 
fan en route noises varied depcuidiug on the com- 
bination of measurement proc(-dure and corrections 
considered. 

Comparison of Noise Metrics for En Route 
Noise 

Wh(;n d(>termining how to most ac(nn'ately \nv- 
dict the annoyance caused by aircraft noise, the 
(juestious that imist be aiisw<Ted are which noise 
meiistirement procedure should be used and which 
corrections, if any, should hv applied to the mea- 
surement proc(!dure. The answers to these (jues- 
tions can vary d(!peiidiiig upon what ty])es of air- 
craft and operations are under consideration. To 
investigate the prediction ability of the noise mea- 
sureni(!nt proc(>dures and corrections, the correla- 
tion c'oefficient b(^tween the subjtu-tive noise lev(>l 
L5 and the calculated n(Mse level was determined 
for each combination of measurenK>nt procedure and 
corrections. The c-orrtilation coefficitnits were corii- 
I)ared by using a twotailed ^test for the signif- 
icance of difference (p < O.Of)) b(>twe(>n corn^la- 
tion c-oefficients when samj)](\s are not independent 
(ref. 5). The high(>r the correlation coefficient, 
the better the predictif^n accuracy. The corr(>la- 
tion coefficients for tin; en route noise stimuli are 
given in table Vfl. Tlie following results are based 
on the statistical comparisons of the correlation 
coefficients. 

Comparisons of the results in table VII indicate 
that, in all but a few cases, basing the duration 
corr(!ction on the 15- or 20-dB down points instead of 
i\\Q 10-dB down points did not significantly improve 
annoyance prediction. In most cases, the addition of 
duration corrections based on the 10-dB down points 
did not improve annoyance prediction. In all but 
one of the cases where the addition of the duration 
correction improved the correlation coefficient, the 
improvement was not significant. The one exc(;ption 
was L4 with T\ tone corrections. In this case, the 
improvement in annoyance prediction that resulted 



from the addition of the duration correction was 
statistically significant. 

Tlie efi'ect of the addition of tone corrcK'tions on 
armoyancc prediction differed, depending on whether 
a duration correction was added. For th(> cases with 
duration corrections, annoyance prediction improved 
when either of the tone corrections, 7'i or T2, was 
added. The improvements in correlation coefficient 
that result from the 7\ tone corn-ction w(Te signif- 
icant, except for the case of L^i with duration cor- 
rections. The improvements i)rovided by the T2 tone 
correction were significant in all cases. Except for 
duration-corr(;cted L4, the T\ tone corrections re- 
sulted in higher corr(>lation coefficients than the T2 
tone corrections. However, the difference was not 
significant, except in the case of dm-ation-correctcd 
LL2. For the cases with no duration corrections, the 
T\ tone correction improved the correlation coeffi- 
cient only for LL2. and the improvenu-nt was not 
significant. The addition of the- T-) tone correction 
resulted in improved correlation coefficients in four 
of five cases, but these improvements were not signif- 
icant eitficr. 

These results indicate that the addition of tone 
corrections and/or duration corrections does not 
significantly improv(\ in a consist(-nt niami(>r, the 
prediction of annoyanc(> tcj n\ route noise. Com- 
parison of the peak levels (i.e., the levels without 
corrections) of thc> different m(>asurement procedures 
indicates that PNL has the highest correlation co(>f- 
ficient and L4 has the lowest correlation coeflicient. 
The only significant, diffcTcnces b(>tween tlu- five peak 
levels wen- that the correlation co(>ffici(>nts for PNL 
and L/;) were both siginficantly greater than the cor- 
relation coefficient for L4. 

Tli(> L,4 with D]() duration corrections and T2 
tone corrections had the highest correlation coeffi- 
cient of the metrics considered and was therefore-, 
strictly speaking, the best predictor of annoyance to 
en route noise. Howf-ver, as indicated in the preced- 
ing paragraphs, statistical comparisons of the cor- 
relation coefficients indicate that duration and tone 
corrections do not significantly improve annoyance 
prediction. Comparison of flu- correlation coefficients 
for peak L^ and duration-corrected L 4 with T2 tone 
corrections indicates no significant difference. Of the 
peak levels considered, PNL had the highest correla- 
tion coefficient. Direct comparison of the correlation 
coefficient for peak PNL and duration-corrected L4 
with the 72 tone correction also indicates no .signifi- 
cant diff'erence. These analyses indicate that, of the 
noi.sc metrics considered, PNL without tone and du- 
ration corrections is the most appropriate metric for 
predicting annoyance to en route noi.se. 



Optimum Duration-Correction 
Magnitudes 

The duration corrections disenssed in the preced- 
ing section were based on the duration-correction 
magnitude used in the Federal Aviation Administra- 
tion's EPNL calculation procedure for aircraft certifi- 
cation (ref. 2). This method assumes that a doubling 
of effective duration has the same effect on annoyance 
as a 3-dB increase in level. (Effective duration is de- 
termined from an integration of the (>nergy between 
the 10-dB down points of a noise (refs. 2 and 3).) 
This 3-dB duration-correction magnitude has been 
shown to be the optimum (i.e., correct) value for the 
noise durations of aircraft takeoff and landing oper- 
ations (ref. 6). However, 3 dB may not be the oi)ti- 
nmm duration-correction magnitude for the very long 
durations associated with en route noise. In other 
words, for very long durations, a doubling of effec- 
tive duration may have an effect on annoyance equiv- 
alent to an increase in level of some value other than 
3 dB. To determine the optimum duration-correction 
magnitude for en route noise, the analysis described 
in this section was performed on the data from this 
experiment. 

If the magnitude on which a duration correction is 
ba.s(Kl is the optimum magnitude, then a unit change 
in the din-ation correction represents the same change 
in annoyance as a unit change in the maxinnun l<>vel 
of a noise. Therefore, the subjective noise levels can 
be represented by the linear equation 



flO 



+ ai (iinax + D') 



(1) 



where L5 is the subjective noise level, L,nax iÂ« the 
maxinmm level, and D' is the duration correction 
based on the optinnnn magnitude. This equation can 
be expanded to the form 



Ls = Â«() + aii'inax + aiD 



(2) 



However, if the magnitude on which a duration cor- 
rection is l)ased is not the optimum magnitude, then 
a unit change in the duration correction does not rep- 
resent the same change in annoyance as a unit change 
in the maximum level of a noise. Therefore, for du- 
ration corrections calculated Iw using a nonoptiinum 
magnitude (and if the maximmn levels and durations 
are not correlated), the equation best fitting the data 
would l:>e of the form 



Ls = (H) + aiLmn 



(1-2 



D* 



(3) 



where a\ is not equal to (12 and D* is the dura- 
tion correction based on the nonoptimum magnitude. 



Combining equations (2) and (3) yields 
aiD' = a2Â£'* 



which gives 



D' 






(5) 



Duration corrections based on 3 dB per doubling 
of effective duration (i.e., the difference between the 
duration-corrected level and the respective maxinuun 
level for each noise metric) were used in nuiltiple re- 
gression analyses of the form of equation (3). The op- 
tinmm duration-correction magnitudes D' were then 
calculated from eciuation (5) with D* set equal to 
3 dB per doubling of effective duration. These cal- 
culations were made for each of the noise metrics 
for the PTA en route noise stinuili. the conventional 
turbofan en route noise stimuli, the combined set of 
en route noise stimuli, and the conventional turbo- 
prop and turbofan takeoff and landing noise stim- 
uli. The resulting ontimum magnitudes, in terms of 
equivalent decibels per doubling of effective duration, 
are given in table VIII for duration corrections based 
on the lO-dB down points. Tables IX and X give the 
optimum magnitudes for duration corrections based 
on the 15- and 20-dB down points. 

The optimum magnitudes for the takeoff and 
landing noises agree very well with the 3-dB magni- 
tude used in the EPNL duration correction. How- 
ever, the optinnnn duration-correction magnitudes 
for the en route noises are considerably less than 
3 dB. Based on these results, a duration-correction 
magnitude on the order of 1 dB per doubling of effec- 
tive duration appears to be a more appropriate value 
for en route noise. Further analyses will determine 
whether this modification significantly improves an- 
noyance prediction. 

Comparison of Noise Metrics With 
Different Duration-Correction Magnitudes 

To investigate whether a duration correction 
based on 1 dB per doubling of effective duration 
would improve the i)rediction ability of the noise 
measurement procedures and corrections, the corre- 
lation coefficient between the subjective noise level 
Ls and the calculated noise level was deternnned 
for each combination of measurement procedure, 
tone correction, and modified duration correction. 
As done previously, the correlation coefficients were 
compared by using a two-tailed f-test for the signifi- 
cance of difference {p < 0.05) between correlation co- 
efficients when samples are not independent (ref. 5). 
The higher the correlation coefficient, the better the 
prediction accuracy. The correlation coefficients of 



the modified noise iiietricH for tlie en route noise stim- 
uli are given in tahl(> XI. Tfie eocfficients in table XI 
that are significantly greater than the corrtisponding 
coefficients in table VII for the standard duration- 
correction magnitude of 3 dB are marked with an as- 
terisk. Comparison of tables Vlf and XI shows that 
tlu; duration-correction magnitiuk^ of I dB yielded 
a higher correlation c:oefhcient than the 3-dB mag- 
nitude for every noise metric variation except the 
tone-corrected L4 cases. However, only about half 
the increases represented significant increases in an- 
noyance prediction. 

Since this result for a magnitude of 1 dB is not 
completely conclusive, tlu; analysis was repeated by 
using the optinnun duration-correction magnitudes 
for each noise metric variation for the combined set 
of en route noises as given in taf)les VIII to X. 
The resulting corrtdation coefficients are given in ta- 
h\e XII. None of the coefficients in table XII are sig- 
nificantly greater than the corresponding coefficients 
in table XI for the modified duration-correction mag- 
nitude of 1 (IB. The coefficients marked with an 
asterisk in table XII are significantly greater than 
the corrtjspoiifling coefficients in table VII for the 
standard duration-correction magnitude of 3 dB. 
Comparisons cjf tables VII and XII show that tfie 
optimum duration-correction magnitudes yielded a 
higher correlation coefficient than tlu^ 3-dB mag- 
inlude for (;very noise metric variation, including 
the tone-corrected L^ cases. However, as with the 
1-dB magnitu<le cotjfficients, only about half tlie in- 
creases representcKl significant increa.s(-s in annoyance 
prediction. 

Comi)arisons within tables XI and XII indicate 
that basing tlu; duration corrections on the 15- or 
20-dB down points instead of the 10-dB down points 
did not improve annoyance prediction. This result is 
similar to the 3-dB magnitude case. However, unlike 
the 3-dB magnitudt; results, tfie addition of duration 
corrections based on the 1-dB and optimum mag- 
nitudes did improve annoyance prediction in almost 
every instance. The increa,se, however, was not sig- 
nificant in most cases. The increase was significant 
for L4, Zv4 with Ti tone corrections, and L^ with T2 
tone corrections for both the 1-dB and the optimum 
magnitude cases. The PNL with Ti tone corrections 
and Pi with T] tone corrections also had significant 
increases in the 1-dB magnitude case. 

The effect on annoyance prediction of the addi- 
ti(m of tone corrections to the metrics with reduced 
duration-correction magnitudes was to improve pre- 
diction in almost every case. The T2 tone corn^ction 
did better than the Tj tone correction in all but one 
case. However, tlie improvement provided f)y Ti and 



T2 tone corrections was significant in only about half 
the cases. 

Comparisons of the peak levels (i.e., the levels 
without corrections) and the duration-corrected lev- 
els with T2 tone corrections for each measurenuuit 
procedure in tables XI and XII yielded similar incon- 
clusive results. The addition of corrections improved 
annoyance prediction, but the differ(>ric(^ was signif- 
icant in only aboxit half the cases. Comparing the 
noise metric variation that had the highest correla- 
tion {D\r^ and D20 values not considered) from each 
of tables XI and XII duration-corrected PL with T2 
tone corrections and duration-corrected L4 with T2 
tone corrections â€” with peak PNL showed no signif- 
icant difference in the correlation coefficients at the 
0.05 probability level. However, the coefficient for 
PNL with T2 tone corrections and duration correc- 
tions based on a 1-dB magnitude wa,s significantly 
greater than the coefficient for peak PNL. 

Tfiese results indicate that when duration cor- 
rections are based on magnitudes of approximately 
1 dB per doubling of effective duration, the addi- 
tion of tone corrections and duration corrections im- 
proves the prediction of annoyance to en route noise, 
at least in terms of increasing the correlation coef- 
ficient. However, since the resulting improvements 
arc not consistently statistically significant, it is dif- 
ficult to conclude with certainty that the corrections 
should be used. Most of tfie improvements that were 
not statistically significant at the 0.05 level would 
have been significant at the 0.10 level. A definitive 
answer would best be obtained by conducting an- 
other test, in which the (hirations and tonal content 
of the stimuli were mor(> systematically chosen and 
controlled. 

Influence of Other Variables 

In addition to the noise metrics, several quanti- 
tative physical parameters were considered as pos- 
sible predictors of annoyance response tcj en route 
noise. They were overall duration, aircraft crTiise al- 
titude, aircraft cruise Mach muiiber, and propeller 
tip speed at cruise for the PTA en route noise stim- 
uli; and overall duration, aircraft cruise altitude, and 
aircraft cruise speed for the conventional turbofan 
en route noise stimuli. Overall duration was studied 
separately from the other parameters for the com- 
bined set of en route noise stirrmli. Overall duration 
is the time from the start of the noise stimulus to the 
end of the noise stimulus (i.e., the total time tiiat 
the stimulus is audible). The other parameters were 
studied within the PTA and conventional turbofan 
subsets of stimuli, because the parameters, or the 



way they wer(> iiu-asurcd, differed f)etwecri the sub- 
sets. The effects of tlie parameters in conjuuctioii 
with various conibinatious of PNL, with and witii- 
out duration (based on 3 dB per doubling of effective 
(hu'ation and fO-dB down points) and tone {T\ and 
72) corrections, were studied by using multiple I'e- 
gression analyses with L5 as the dependent variable. 
Regression models, including the noise metric and 
each combination of one or more of the parameters, 
were determined and compared by using the mod- 
els comparison approach detailed in rcjference 7. The 
addition of the parameters did not improve the re- 
gression models. Therefore, no effect on annoyance 
of any of the parameters is indicated. 

Conclusions 

A laboratory experiment was conducted to quan- 
tify the aimoyance response of people on the ground 
to en route noise generated by aircraft at cruise con- 
ditions. Thirty-two test subjects judged the annoy- 
ance of 24 Propfan Test Assessment (PTA) advanc(K] 
turboprop en route noise stimuli, f8 conventional 
turbofan en route noise stimuli, and 60 conventional 
turboproj) and tin'bofan takeoff and landing noise 
stimuli. Analyses of the resulting data conipar(!d 
aimoyance responses to different aircraft types and 
operations, examined the ability of current noise 
measurement and correction procedures to predict 
annoyance to en route noise, and calculated optiimmi 
duration-correction magnitudes for en route noise. 

Based on the results presented in this paper, the 
following conclusions were noted: 

1. Small, but significant, differences in aimoyance 
response w<Te found between the PTA advanced 
turboprop en route noises, the conventional tur- 
bofan (-11 route noises, and the conventional tur- 
boprop and turbofan takeoff and landing noises. 
However, the difft^'ence in annoyance response 
between the PTA advanced turboprop en route 
noises and the conventional turbofan en route 
noises varied dei)eiiding upon the noise metric 
considered. 



2. Basing the duration correction on the noise be- 
tween the 15- or 20-dB down points inst(!ad of 
the noise between the 10-dB down points did not 
imj)rove the prediction of annoyance to en route 
noise. 

3. The prediction of annoyance to en route nois(> wa.s 
not significantly improved by the additi(jn of a 
duration correction based on the magnitude of 
3 dB per doubling of effective duration used in 
effective perceived noise level (EPNL). 

4. In most cases, tone corrections did lujt sig- 
nificantly improve prediction of annoyance to 
en route noise. 

5. Of the noise metrics cc^nsidered, PNL without 
tone and duration corre(;tions was the most ap- 
propriate noise metric for predicting aimoyance 
to en route noise. 

6. The optimmn duration-correction magnitude for 
en route noise is approximately 1 dB per doubling 
of effective duration instead of the 3 dB per 
doufjling of effective duration used for takeoff and 
landing noise. 

7. The addition of duration c-orr(>ctions f)ased on the 
reduced correction magnitude in conjunction with 
tone corrections tended to improve j)rediction of 
annoyance to en route noise. Whetlier or not 
the improvement was statistically significant de- 
pended on which noise measurement pro<'edure 
was used and the exact magnitude of the reduced 
duration correction. 

8. No effects of overall duration, aircraft cruise alti- 
tude, aircraft cruis(> Mach number, aircraft cruise 
speed, or cruise propeller tip speed on aimoyance 
to m route noise were found.

After each sound there will be a few seconds of silence. Curing this inter- 
val, please indicate how annoying you judge the sound to bt by marking the 
appropriate numbered circle on the computer card. The numbei of each sound is 
indicated across the bottom of the card. If you judge a sound to be only 
slightly annoying, mark one of the numbered circles close to the NOT ANNOYING 
AT ALL end of the scale, that is a low numbered circle near the bottom of the 
card. Similarly, if you judge a sound to be very annoying, then mark one 



of the numbered circles close to the EXTREMELY ANNOYING end of the scale, that 
is a high numbered circle near the top of the card. A moderately annoying 
judgment should be marked in the middle portion of the scale. In any case, 
make your mark so that the circle that most closely indicates your annoyance 
to the sound is completely filled in. There are no right or wrong answers; we 
are only interested in your judgment of each sound. 

Before the first session begins you will be given a practice computer 
card and four sounds will be presented to familiarize you with making and 
recording judgments. I will remain in the testing room with you during the 
practice time to answer any questions you may have. 

Thank you for your help in conducting the experiment.

13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words) 

A laboratory experiment was conducted to quantify the annoyancf! response of people on the ground to en route 
noise generated by aircraft at cruise conditions. The en route nois(>s were ground-level recordings of eight 
advanced turboprop aircraft flyovers and six conventional turbofan flyovers. The eight advanced turboprop 
en route noises represented the NASA Propfan Test Assessment aircraft operating at different combinations of 
altitude, aircraft Mach number, and propeller tip speed. The conventional turbofan en route noises represented 
six different commercial airliners. The overall durations of the en route noises varied from approximately 
40 to 160 sec. In the experiment, 32 subjects judged the annoyance of the en route noises as well as recordings 
of both the takeoff and landing noises of each of 5 conventional turboprop and 5 conventional turbofan 
aircraft. Each of the noises was presented at three sound pressure levels to the subjects in an anechoic 
listening room. Analyses of the judgments found small differences in annoyance between three combinations of 
aircraft type and operation. Current tone and duration corrections did not significantly improve en route noise 
annoyance prediction. The optimum duration-correction magnitude for en route noise was approximately 1 dB 
per doubling of effective duration.
