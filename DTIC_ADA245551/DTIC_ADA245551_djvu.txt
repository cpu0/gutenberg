CHAPTER 1 


INTRODUCTIOJ 


The Ada inplementation described above was tested according to the Ada 
Validation Procedures [Pro90] against the Ada Stcindard [Ada83] using the 
current Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC). This validation Summary 
Report (VSR) gives an account of the testing of this Ada implementation. 

For any technical terms used in this report, the reader is referred to 
(Pro90]. A detailed description of the ACVC may be found in the current 
ACVC User's Guide [UG89].

1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada inplementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: 

A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class 
to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B 
cuid class L tests are expected to produce errors at compile time and link 
time, respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result when they 
are executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, 
and the procedure CHECK FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT 
also provides a set of Tdentity functions used to defeat some compiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a conpiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executeible. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code vdiich must not be flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Stcindard involving multiple, separately compiled units. Errors 
are expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values — for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in i^pendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and 
implementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this implementation are described in section 2.3.

INTRODUCTION 


For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by the 
AVF, Ihis customization consists of making the modifications described in 
the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see section 2.1) eund, 
possibly some inapplicable tests (see Section 2.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each test of 
the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are irreleveint 
for a given Ada implementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may 
be supported by documents issued by the ISO euid the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and commonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicedale for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Commentaries are included as 
appropriate.

C96005B checks for values of type DURATICW'BASE that are outside the 
range of DURATION. There are no such values for this implementation. 

CD1009C uses a representation clause specifying a non-default size for a 
floating-point type. 

CD2A53A checks operations of a fixed-point type for which a length 
clause specifies a power-of-ten type'small. (See section 2.3.) 

CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use representation 
clauses specifying non-default sizes for access types.

CE2103A, CE2103B, and CE3107A expect that NAME_ERROR is raised when an 
attempt is made to create a file with an illegal name; this 
implementation does not support the creation of external files and so 
raises USE E3®0R. (See section 2.3.) 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 23 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
implementation did not report the violations of the Ada Stcindard in the way 
expected by the original tests: 


B23004A 

B24007A 

B24009A 

B28003A 

B32202A 

B32202B 

B32202C 

B37004A 

B61012A 

B91004A 

B95069A 

B95069B 

B97103E

BC2001D 

BC3009A 

BC3009C

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


BA2001E was graded passed by Evaluation Modification as directed by the 
AVO. The test expects that duplicate names of subunits with a common 
ancestor will be detected as compilation errors; this inplementation 
detects the errors at link time, and the AVO ruled that this behavior is 
acceptable. 

EA3004D was graded passed by Evaluation and Processing Modification as 
directed by the AVO. The test requires that either pragma INLINE is obeyed 
for a function call in each of three contexts and that thus three library 
units are made obsolete by the re-compilation of the inlined function's 
body, or else the pragma is ignored completely. This inplementation obeys 
the pragma except vdien the call is within the package specification. When 
the test's files are processed in the given order, only two units are made 
obsolete; thus, the expected error at line 27 of file EA3004D6M is not 
valid and is not flagged. To confirm that indeed the pragma is not obeyed 
in this one case, the test was also processed with the files re-ordered so 
that the re-compilation follows only the package declaration (and thus the 
other library units will not be made obsolete, as they are coitpiled later); 
a "NOT APPLICABLE" result was produced, as expected. The revised order of 
files was 0-1-4-5-2-3-6. 

CD2A53A was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by 
the AVO. The test contains a specification of a power-of-10 value as small 
for a fixed-point type. The AVO ruled that, under ACVC 1.11, support of 
decimal smalls may be omitted. 

CE2103A, CE2103B, and CE3107A were graded inapplicable by Evaluation 
Modification as directed by the AVO. The tests abort with an unhandled 
exception when USE_ERROR is raised on the attempt to create an external 
file. This is acceptable behavior because this implementation does not 
support external files (cf. AI-00332).

PROCESSING INFORMATION 


3.1 TESTING ENVIRCWMENT 

The Ada implementation tested in this validation effort is described 
adequately by the information given in the initial pages of this report. 

For a point of contact for technical information about this Ada 
inpleraentation system, see: 

Jim O'Leary 
Alsys, Inc 

67 South Bedford Street 
Burlington MA 01803-5152 

For a point of contact for sales information about this Ada implementation 
system, see: 


Ed Falis 
Alsys, Inc 

67 South Bedford Street 
Burlington MA 01803-5152 


Testing of this Ada inplementation was conducted at the customer's site by 
a validation team from the AVF. 


3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming 
Lcinguage Steindard, whether the test is applicable or inapplicable; 
otherwise, the Ada Implementation fails the ACVC [Pro90]. 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard.

PROCESSING INFORMATION 


a) Total Number of ;^plicable Tests 3559 

b) Total Number of Withdrawn Tests 92 

c) Processed Inapplicable Tests 54 

d) Non-Processed 1/0 Tests 264 

e) Non-Processed Floating-Point 

Precision Tests 201 

f) Total Number of Inapplicable Tests 519 


g) Total Number of Tests for ACVC 1.11 4170 


The aJxjve number of I/O tests were not processed because this 
inplementation does not support a file system. The above number of 
floating-point tests were not processed because they used floating-point 
precision exceeding that supported by the iitplementation. When this 
compiler was tested, the tests listed in section 2.1 had been withdrawn 
because of test errors. 


3.3 TEST EXECUTIC^I 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were loaded onto a VAX/VMS system and then transferred to the 
host conputer via an FTP LAN network. 


After the test files were loaded onto the host computer, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada inplementation. 


The tests were conpiled and linked on the host computer system, as 
appropriate. The executcJale images were transferred to the target coirputer 
system by serial communications link, and non. The results were captured 
on the host computer system aund treuisferred to a VAX/VMS system using an 
FTP LAN network for printing.

PRCXJESSING INFORMATION 


Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the customer auid 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a complete listing of 
the processing options for this inplementation. It also indicates the 
default options. The options invoked explicitly for validation testing 
during this test were: 

OPTTC»I/SWITCH EFFECT 


SHOW -> NO 

WARNING »> YES 
GENERIC -> STUB 

ERROR -> 999 

CALLS => INLINED 


Do not show header nor error 
summary in listing. 

Include warning messages. 

Place code of generic instantiation 
in separate subunits. 

Mcucimum number of compilation errors 
permitted before terminating the 
compilation. 

This option allows insertion of code for 
subprograms inline and must be set for 
the pragma INLINE to be operative. 


MODULE «> "\Walkyrie\diskl\build_386\alsyscomp_033\hw.obj"

APPENDIX F 


Implementation - Dependent Characteristics 


This appendix summarizes the implementation-dependent characteristics of the Alsys 
386 DOS Compiler (32-bit mode). 

Appendix F is a required part of the Reference Manual for the Ada Programming 
Language (called the RM in this appendix). 

The seaions of this appendix are as follows: 

1. The form, allowed places, and effect of every implcmeniaiion-dependeni pragma. 

2. The name and the type of every implementation-dependent attribute. 

3. The specification of the package SYSTEM. 

4. The description of the representation clauses. 

5. The conventions used for any implementation-generated name denoting im¬ 
plementation-dependent components. 

6. The interpretation of expressions that appear in address clauses, including those 
for interrupts. 

7. Any restriaions on unchecked conversions. 

8. Any implementation-dependent characteristics of the input-output packages. 

9. Charaaeristics of numeric types. 

10. Other implementation-dependent characteristics. 

11. Compiler limiutions. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics

The muicAlsys Runtime Executive Programs or simply Runtime Executive refers to the 
nintim a library routines provided for all Ada programs. These routines implement the 
Ada heap, exceptions, tasking control, and other utility functions. 

General systems programming notes are given in another document, Mit Application 
Developer's Guide (for example, parameter passing conventions needed for interface with 
assembly routines).

Appendix F, Version 5 




Section 1 


Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 


1.1 INLINE 

Pragma INLINE is fully supported; however, it is not possible to inline a subprogram in a 
declarative part. 


1.2 INTERFACE 

Ada programs can interlace with subprograms written in Assembler and other languages 
through the use of the predefined pragma INTERFACE and the implementation-defined 
pragma INTERFACE^NAME. 

Pragma INTERFACE specifies the name of an interfaced subprogram and the name of 
the programming language for which parameter passing conventions will be generated. 
Pragma INTERFACE takes the form specified in the RM: 

pragma INTERFACE {language jiame, subprogram jiame)\ 

where, 

■ languagejiame is ASSEMBLER, ADA or C 

■ subprogram jiame is the name used within the Ada program to refer to the 
interfaced subprogram. 

The only language names accepted by pragma INTERFACE are ASSEMBLER, ADA and 
C The full implementation requirements for writing pragma INTERFACE subprograms 
are described in tbe Application Developer’s Guide. 

The language name used in the pragma INTERFACE does not have to have any 
relationship to the language aaually used to write the interfaced subprogram. It is used 
only to tell the Compiler how to generate subprogram calls; that is, what kind of 
parameter passing techniques to use. The programmer can interface Ada programs with 
subroutines written in any other (compiled) language by understanding the mechanisms 


Apperuiix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


3 





used for parameter passing by the Alsys DOS Ada Compiler and the corresponding 
mechanisms of the chosen external language. 


13 INTERFACE_NAME 

Pragma INTERFACE.NAME associates the name of the interfaced subprogram with the 
external name of the interfaced subprogram. If pragma INTERFACE.NAME is not used, 
then the two names are assumed to be identical. This pragma takes the form: 

pragma INTERFACE_NAME {subpropamjuune, stringjiteraf); 

where, 

■ subprogram jiame is the name used within the Ada program to refer to the 
interfaced subprogram. 

■ srringjiteral is the name by which the interfaced subprogram is referred to at link 
time. 

The pragma INTERFACE^NAME is used to identil^ routines in other languages that arc 
not named with legal Ada identifters. Ada identifiers can only contain letters, digits, or 
underscores, whereas the DOS Linker allows external names to contain other characters, 
for example, the dollar sign (S) or commercial at sign (@). These charaaers can be 
specified in the stringJiteral argument of the pragma 1NTERFACE_NAME. 

The pragma INTERFACE.NAME is allowed at the same places of an Ada program as the 
pragma INTERFACE (Location restrictions can be found in section 13.9 of the RM.) 
However, the pragma INTERFACE.NAME must always occur after the pragma 
INTERFACE declaration for the interfaced subprogram. 

The string Jiteral of the pragma INTERFACE^NAME is passed through unchanged to the 
DOS objea file. The maximum length of xbe. string Jiteral is 40 characters. This limit is 
not checked by the Compiler, but the string is truncated by the Binder to meet the Intel 
objea module format standard. 

The user must be aware however, that some tools from other vendors do not fully 
support the sundard object file format and may restria the length of symbols. For 
example, the IBM and Miaosoft assemblers silently truncate symbols at 31 characters. 

The Runtime Executive contains several external identifiers. All such identifiers begin 
with either the string ’ADA@' or the string 'ADAS@*. Accordingly, names prefixed by 
'AOA@* or 'ADAS®' should be avoided by the user.

private 

pragma INTERFACE (ASSEMBLER. SAMPLE.DEVICE); 
pragma INTERFACE (ADA, PROCESS_SAMPLE); 

pragma INTERFACE_NAME (SAMPLE_DEVICE, ■DEV10SGET_SAMPLE*); 
end SAMPLE_DATA; 


1.4 INDENT 

Pragma INDENT is only used with AdaReformat. AdaReformat is the Alsys reformatter 
which offers the functionalities of a pretty-printer in an Ada environment. 

The pragma is placed in the source flie and interpreted by the Reformatter. The line 

pragma INDENT(OFF); 

auses AdaReformat not to modify the source lines after this pragma, while 
pragma INDENT(ON); 

czvsei AdaReformat to resume its action after this pragma. 


1.5 Other Pragmas 

Pragmas IMPROVE and PACK are discussed in detail in the seaion on representation 
clauses and records (Chapter 4). 

Pragma PRIORITY is accepted with the range of priorities running from 1 to 10 (see the 
definition of the predefined package SYSTEM in Section 3). Undefined priority (no

Section 4 


Support for Representation Clauses 


This seaion explains how objects are represented and allocated by the Alsys DOS Ada 
compiler and how it is possible to control this using representation clauses. Applicable 
restriaions on representation clauses are also describ^. 

The representation of an object is closely connected with its type. For this reason this 
seaion addresses successively the representation of enumeration, integer, floating point, 
fixed point, access, task, array and record types. For each class of type the representation 
of the corresponding objects is described. 

Except in the case of array and record types, the description for each class of type is 
independent of the others. To understand the representation of array and record types it 
is necessary to understand first the representation of their components. 

Apart from implementation defined pragmas, Ada provides three means to control the 
size of objects: 

■ a (predefined) pragma PACK, applicable to array types 

■ a record representation clause 

■ a size speafication 

For each class of types the effea of a size specification is described. Interactions among 
size specifications, packing and record representation clauses is described under the 
discussion of array and record types. 

Representation clauses on derived record types or derived tasks types are not supported. 

Size represenution clauses on types derived from private types are not supported when 
the derived type is declared outside the private part of the defining package. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics

4.1 Enumeration Types 


4.1.1 Enumeration Literal Encoding 

When no enumeration representation clause applies to an enumeration type, the 
internal code associated with an enumeration literal is the position number of the 
enumeration literal. Then, for an enumeration type with n elements, the internal codes 
are the integers 0,1,2, >, n-1. 

An enumeration representation clause can be provided to specify the value of each 
internal code as described in RM 13.3. The Alsys compiler fully implements enumeration 
representation clauses. 

As internal codes must be machine integers the internal codes provided by an 
enumeration representation clause must be in the range -2^^.. 2^^-l. 

An enumeration value is always represented by its internal code in the program 
generated by the compiler. 


4.1 J Eflumeration Types and Object Sizes 

Minimum sizt of an enumenuion subtype 

The minimum possible size of an enumeration subtype is the minimum number of bits 
that is necessary for representing the internal codes of the subtype values in normal 
binary form. 

A static subtype, with a null range has a minimum size of 1. Otherwise, if m and M are 
the values of the internal codes associated with the first and last enumeration values of 
the subtype, then its minimum size L is determined as follows. For m >s o, L is the 
smallest positive inteier such that M < = 2^*1. For m < 0, L is the smallest positive 
integer such that -2^*‘ < * m and M < * 2^'^>1. For example: 

type COLOR is (GREEN, BLACK, WHITE, RED, BLUE, YELLOW); 

~ The minimum size of COLOR is 3 bits. 

subtype BLACK_AND_WHITE is COLOR range BLACK.. WHITE; 

- The minimum size of BLACK_AND_WHITE is 2 bits. 


14 


Appendix F, Version 5 



■nbtype BIACaC_OR_WHITE is BLACK.AND.WHITC range X.. X; 

- Auuming that X is not static, the minimum size of BLACK_OR_WHITE is 

- 2 bits (the same as the minimum size of its type mark BL\CK_AND_WHrrE). 


Siu cf m mumerahon subtype 

When no size specification is applied to an enumeration type or first named subtype, the 
objects of that type or first named subtype are represented as signed machine integers. 
The machine provides 8,16 and 32 bit integers, and the compiler selects automatically 
the smallest signed machine integer which can hold each of the internal codes of the 
enumeration type (or subtype). The size of the enumeration type and of any of its 
subtypes is thus 8,16 or 32 bits. 

When a size specification is applied to an enumeration type, this enumeration type and 
each of its subtypes has the size specified by the length clause. The same rule applies to a 
first named subtype. The size specification must of course specify a value greater than or 
equal to the minimum size of the type or subtype to which it applies: 

type EXTENDED Is 

(.. The usual ASCII character set. 

NUL, SOH, STX, ETX, EOT, ENQ, ACK, BEL, 

V, y. ’z’, ’{*, T. del. 

~ Extended charaaers 

C_CEDILL\_CAP, U_UMIAUT, E.ACUTE, ...); 
for EXTENDED'SIZE use 8; 

- The size of type EXTENDED will be one byte. Its objects will be represented 

- as unsigned 8 bit integers. 

The Alsys compiler fully implements size specifications. Nevertheless, as enumeration 
values are coded using integers, the specified length cannot be greater than 32 bits. 


Sag ef the objects an enumeration subtype 

Provided its size is not constrained by a record component clause or a pragma PACK, an 
objea of an enumeration subtype has the same size as its subtype. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Choraaerisrics

4.2 Integer Types 

There are three predefined integer types in the Alsys implementation for I80386 
machines; 

type SHORT_SHORT_INTEGER ts range -2* *07.. 2* *07-1; 
type SHORT_INTEGER U range-2**15..2**15-1; 

type INTEGER te range-2**31.. 2**3M; 

4.2.1 Integer T^pe Representation 
An integer type declared by a declaration of the form: 
type T is range L.. R; 

is implicitly derived from a predefined integer type. The compiler automatically selects 
the predefined integer type whose range is the smallest that contains the values L to R 
inclusive. 

Binary code is used to represent integer values. Negative numbers are represented using 
two’s complement. 


4.2.2 Integer l^pe and Object Size 

Minimum size of an integer subtype 

The minimum possible size of an integer subtype is the minimum number of bits that is 
necessary for representing the internal codes of the subtype values in normal binary 
form. 

For a static subtype, if it has a null range its minimum size is 1. Otherwise, if m and M are 
the lower and upper bounds of the subtype, then its minimum size L is determined as 
follows. For m > > 0, L is the smallest positive integer such that M < = 2^'^ For m < 
0, L is the smallest positive integer that *2^'’ < « m and M < * 2^**-l. For example: 

subtype S is INTEGER range 0.. 7; 

~ The minimum size of S is 3 bits. 


16 


Appendix F, Version 5 






tnbtype D Is S ranee X ~ Y; 

•• Assuming that X and Y are not static, the minimum size of 
- D is 3 bits (the same as the minimum size of its type mark S). 


Siu tf an integer subtype 

The sizes of the predefined integer types SHORT_SHORT_INTEGER, SHORT_INTEGER 
and INTEGER are respectively 8,16 and 32 bits. 

When no size specification is applied to an integer type or to its first named subtype (if 
any), its size and the size of any of its subtypes is the size of the predefined type from 
which it derives, directly or indirealy. For example: 

type S is range 80.. 100; 

- S is derived from SHORT_SHORT_INTEGER, its size is 
-8 bits. 

type J is range 0.. 2SS; 

- J is derived from SHORTJNTEGER, its size is 16 bits, 
type N is new J range 80.. 100; 

~ N is indirectly derived from SHORTJNTEGER, its size is 
--16 bits. 

When a size specification is applied to an integer type, this integer type and each of its 
subtypes has the size specified by the length clause. The same rule applies to a first 
named subtype. The size specification must of course specify a value greater than or 
equal to the minimum size of the type or subtype to which it applies: 

type S is range 80.. 100; 
forS'SIZE use 32; 

-- S is derived from SHORT_SHORTJNTEGER, but its size is 

- 32 bits because of the size specification. 

type J is range 0.. 255; 
rorJ’SIZEoseS; 

- J is derived from SHORT.INTEGER, but its size is 8 bits 
~ because of the size specification. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


17 






type N is new J range 80.. 100; 

- N is indirectly derived from SHORT.INTEGER, but its 

- size is 8 bits because N inherits the size specification 
-ofj. 


Sat of tht objects of OH itOeger subtype 

Provided its size is not constrained by a record component clause or a pragma PACK, an 
object of an integer subtype has the same size as its subtype. 


4J Floating Point Types 

There are two predefined floating point types in the Alsys implementation for I80386 
machines: 

type SHORT_FLOAT is 

digits 6 range -(2.0 -10"(-23))*10**127.. (2.0 - 2.0**(.23))*10**127; 
type FLOAT Is 

digiU 6 range -(2.0 -10**(-23))*2.0**127.. (2.0 - 2.0**(-23))*2.0**127; 
typeLONG.FLOATis 

digiU IS range -(10 - 10**(-5I))*10**J023.. (10 -10**(-51))*10**1023; 
Note that SHORT_FLOAT has the same range as FLOAT. 


4J.1 Floating Point Type Representation 
A floating point type declared by a declaration of the form: 
type T is digits D (range L ~ R]; 

is implicitly derived from a predefined floating point type. The compiler automatically 
selects the smallest predefined floating point type whose number of digits is greater than 
or equal to D and which conuins the values L to R inclusive. 

In the program generated by the compiler, floating point values are represented using 
the TF.F.E standard formats for single and double floats. 


18 


Appendix F, Version 5 







The values of the predefined types SHORT_FLOAT and FLOAT are represented using the 
single float format The values of the predefined type LONG_FLOAT are represented 
using the double float format The values of any other floating point type are represented 
in the same way as the values of the predefined type from which it derives, directly or 
indirectly. 


432 Floating Point l^pe and Object Size 

The minimum possible size of a floating point subtype is 32 bits if its base type is 
SHORT_FLOAT or FLOAT or a type derived from SHORT_FLOAT or FLOAT; it is 64 bits 
if its base tyj)e is LONG_FLOAT or a type derived from LONG_FLOAT. 

The sizes of the predefined floating point types SHORT_FLOAT and FLOAT is 32 bits and 
LONG_FLOAT is 64 bits. 

The size of a floating point type and the size of any of its subtypes is the size of the 
predefined typw from which it derives directly or indirealy. 

The only size that can be specified for a floating point type or first named subtype using a 
size specification is its usual size (32 or 64 bits). 

An object of a floating point subtype has the same size as its subtype. 


4.4 Fixed Point Types 

4.4.1 Fixed Point Type Representation 

If no specification of small applies to a fixed point type, then the value of small is 
determined by the value of delta as defined RM 3.S.9. 

A specification of small can be used to impose a value of small. The value of small is 
required to be a power of two. 

To implement fixed point types, the Alsys compiler for I80386 machines uses a set of 
anonymous predefined types of the form: 

type SH0RT_F1XED is delU D range (-2.0**7.1)«S.. 2.0**7*S; 
for SHORT.FDCED’SMALL use S; 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


19 







type FIXED is delu D range (-10**15-1)*S „ 10**15*S; 
for FIXED’SMALL iisc S; 

type LONG_FTXED is deits D range (-Z0**31-1)*S.. 10**31*S; 
for LONG.FIXED’SMALL use S; 

where D is any real value and S any power of two less than or equal to D. 

A fixed point type declared by a declaration of the form: 

type T is delta D range L.. R; 
possibly with a small specification: 
for TSMALL use S; 

is implicitly derived fiom a predefined fixed point type. The compiler automatically 
selects the predefined fixed point type whose small and delta are the same as the small 
and delta of T and whose range is the shortest that includes the values L to R inclusive. 

In the program generated by the compiler, a safe value v of a fixed point subr^pe F is 
represented as the integer: 

V/FBASE'SMALL 


4.4Jl Fixed Point I^pe and Object Size 

Minimum size of a fixed poiiu subtype 

The minimum possible size of a fixed point subtype is the minimum number of binaiy 
digits that is necessary for representing the values of the range of the subtype using the 
small of the base type. 

For a static subtype, if it has a null range its minimum size is 1. Otherwise, s and S being 
the bounds of the subtype, if i and I are the integer representations of m and M, the 
smallest and the greatest model numbers of the base type such that s < m and M < S, 
then the minimum size L determined as follows. For i > « 0, L is the smallest positive 
integer sirn that I < * For i < 0, L is the smallest positive integer such that - 
^dI<-2^'*-l.

- Aunming that X and Y are not static, the minimum size of D is 7 bits 

- (the same as the minimum size of its type mark S). 


Sizt qf a fixtd point subtype 

The sizes of the predefined fixed point types SHORT_FIXED, FIXED and LONG_FlXED 
are respeaively 8,16 and 32 bits. 

When no size specification is applied to a fixed point type or to its first named subtype, 
its size and the size of any of its subtypes is the size of the predefined type from which it 
derives direaly or indirectly. For example: 

type S is delta 0.01 range 0.8.. 1.0; 

- S is derived from an 8 bit predefined fixed type, its size is 8 bits, 
type F is delta 0.01 range 0.0.. 2.0; 

- F is derived from a 16 bit predefined fixed type, its size is 16 bits, 
type N is new F range 0.8.. 1.0; 

~ N is indirealy derived from a 16 bit predefined fixed type, its size is 16 bits. 

When a size specification is applied to a fixed point type, this fixed point type and each of 
its subtypes has the size specified by the length clause. The same rule applies to a first 
named subtype. The size specification must of course specify a value greater than or 
equal to the minimum size of the type or subtype to which it applies: 

type S U delta 0.01 range 0.8.. 1.0; 
forS’SIZE use 32; 

~ S is derived from an 8 bit predefined fixed type, but its size is 32 bits 

- because of the size specification. 

type F is delta 0.01 range 0.0.. ZO; 
fbr FSIZE use 8; 

~ F is derived from a 16 bit predefined fixed type, but its size is 8 bits 
~ because of the size specification. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


21 







type N is new F range 0.8.. 1.0; 

- N is indirectly derived from a 16 bit predefined fixed type, but its size is 

- 8 bits because N inherits the size specification of F. 

The Alsys compiler fully implements size specifications. Nevertheless, as fixed point 
objects are represented using machine integers, the specified length cannot be greater 
than 32 bits. 


Size o/ the objects of a fixed point subtype 

Provided its size is not constrained by a record component clause or a pragma PACK, an 
objea of a fixed point type has the same size as its subtype. 


4.5 Access Types and Collections 

Access Types and Objects of Access Types 

The only size that can be specified for an access type using a size specification is its usual 
size (32 bits). 

An objea of an access subtype has the same size as its subtype, thus an object of an 
access subtype is always 32 bits long. 


Collection Size 

As described in RM 13.2, a specification of colleaion size can be provided in order to 
reserve storage space for the colleaion of an access type. 

When no STORAGE_SIZE specification applies to an access type, no storage space is 
reserved for its collection, and the value of the attribute STOR,\GE_SlZ£ is then 0. 

The maximum size is limited by the amount of memory available. 


22 


Appendix F, Version 5 







4.6 Taskl^es 

Storate for a task activation 

As desaibed in RM 13.2, a length clause can be used to specify the storage space (that is, 
the suck size) for the activation of each of the tasks of a given type. Al^ also allows the 
task suck size, for all tasks, to be esublished using a Binder option. If a length clause is 
given for a task type, the value indicated at bind time is ignored for this task type, and the 
length clause is obeyed. When no length clause is used to specify the storage space to be 
reserved for a task aaivation, the storage space indicated at bind time is used for this 
aaivation. 

A length clause may not be applied to a derived task type. The same storage space is 
reserved for the aaivation of a task of a derived type as for the aaivation of a task of the 
parent type. 

The minimum size of a task subtype is 32 bits. 

A size specification has no effea on a task type. The only size that can be specified using 
such a length clause is its usual size (32 bits). 

An objea of a task subtype has the same size as its subtype. Thus an object of a task 
subtype is always 32 bits long. 


4.7 Array Types 

Each array is allocated in a contiguous area of storage units. All the components have 
the same size. A gap may exist between two consecutive components (and after the last 
one). All the gaps have the same size.

- The size of the type DECIMAL_DIGIT is 4 bits. Thus in an array of 

- type BINARY_CODED_DECIMAL each component will b.: represented on 
~ 4 bits as in the usual BCD representation. 

If pragma PACK is specified for an array and its components are neither records nor 
arrays, the size of the components is the minimum size of the subtype of the components: 

type A is array (1.. 8) of BOOLEAN; 
pragma PACK(A); 

- The size of the components of A is the minimum size of the type BOOLEAN:

-- The size of the type DECIMAL_DIGrr is 32 bits, but, as 
-- BINARY_CODED_DECIMAL is packed, each component of an array of this 

- type will be represented on 4 bits as in the usual BCD representation. 

Packing the array has no effect on the size of the components when the components are 
records or arrays, since records and anays may be assigned addresses consistent with the 
alignment of their subtypes. 


24 


Appendix F, Version 5 






Caps 

If the components are records or arrays, no size specification applies to the subtype of 
the components and the array is not packed, then the compiler may choose a 
representation with a gap after each component; the aim of the insertion of such gaps is 
to optimize access to the array components and to their subcomponents. The size of the 
gap is chosen so that the relative displacement of consecutive components is a multiple 
of the alignment of the subtype of the components. This strategy allows each component 
and subcomponent to have an address consistent with the alignment of its subtype: 

type R is 
record 

K: SHORT.INTEGER; 

B: BOOLE^;

for R use 
record

type A is array (1.. 10) of R; 

- A gap of 7 bits is inserted after each component in order to respect the 

- alignment of type R. The size of an array of type A will be 400 bits.

A.12 Array Subtype aod Object Size 
Size of an array subtype 

The size of an array subtype is obtained by multiplying the number of its components by 
the sum of the size of the components and the size of the gaps (if any). If the subtype is 
unconstrained, the maximum number of components is considered. 


26 


Appendix F, Version 5 







The size of an array subtype cannot be computed at compile time 

■ if it has non-static constraints or is an unconstrained array type with non-static 
index subtypes (because the number of components can then only be determined at 
runtime). 

■ if the components are records or arrays and their constraints or the constraints of 
their subcomponents (if any) are not static (because the size of the components and 
the size of the gaps can then only be determined at run time). 

As has been indicated above, the effect of a pragma PACK on an array type is to suppress 
the gaps. The consequence of packing an array type is thus to reduce its size. 

If the components of an array are records or arrays and their constraints or the 
constraints of their subcomponents (if any) are not static, the compiler ignores any 
pragma PACK applied to the array type but issues a warning message. Apart from this 
Umiution, array packing is fully implemented by the Alsys compiler. 

A size specification applied to an array type or first named subtype has no effect. The 
only size that can be specifled using such a length clause is its usual size. Nevertheless, 
such a length clause can be useful to verify that the layout of an array is as expected by 
the application. 


Sizt the objects of an array subtype 

The size of an objea of an array subtype is always equal to the size of the subtype of the 
object 


4.8 Record Types 

4.8.1 Basic Record Structure 
Layout of a record 

Each record is allocated in a contiguous area of storage units. The size of a record 
component dep>ends on its type. 

The positions and the sizes of the components of a record type objea can be controlled 
using a record representation clause as described in RM 13.4. In the Alsys 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


27 





implemenution for I80386 machines there is no restriction on the position that can be 
specified for a component of a record. If a component is not a record or an array, its size 
can be any size from the minimum size to the size of its subtype. If a component is a 
record or an array, its size must be the size of its subtype.

Pragma PACK has no effect on records. It is unnecessary because record represenution 
clauses provide full control over record layout. 

A record representation clause need not specify the position and the size for every 
component. If no component clause applies to a compone'^t of a record, its size is the 
size of its subtype. 


4.8.2 Indirect Components 
VFFSET 

If the o^t of a component cannot be computed at compile time, this oflset is stored in 
the record objects at run time and used to access the component Such a component is 
said to be indirect while other components are said to be direa;

A direct and an indirect component 

If a record component is a record or an array, the size of its subty 7 >e may be evaluated at 
run time and may even depend on the discriminants of the record. We will call these 
components dynamic components: 

type DEVICE is (SCREEN, PRINTER); 

type COLOR is (GREEN, RED, BLUE); 

type SERIES is array (POSITIVE range <>) of INTEGER; 

type GRAPH (L : NATURAL) is 
record 

X : SERIES(I _ L); -- The size of X depends on L 
Y: SERIES(l.. L); -- The size of Y depends on L 
end record; 

Q: POSITIVE;

S: GRAPH(Q); - The size of S depends on Q 

caseDU 

when SCREEN-> 

C: COLOR; 
when PRINTER «> 
null; 
end case; 
end record; 

Any component placed after a dynamic component has an offset which cannot be 
evaluated at compile time and is thus indirect. In order to minimize the number of 
indirea components, the compiler groups the dynamic components together and places 
them at the end of the record: 


0 > SCREEN D « PRINTER 

N ■ 2 H > 1 



The record type PICTURE: F and 5 are placed at the end of the record 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


31 





Note that Ada does not allow representation clauses for record components with non- 
sutic bounds [RM 13.4.7], so the compiler’s grouping of dynamic components does not 
conflict with the use of represenution clauses. 

Because of this approach, the only indirect components are dynamic components. But 
not all dynamic components are necessarily indirect: if there are dynamic components in 
a component list which is not followed by a variant part, then exat^y one dynamic 
component of this list is a direa component because its ofBet can be computed at 
compilation time (the only dynamic components that are direct components are in this 
situation):

The record type GRAPH: the dynamic component X is a direct component. 


The offset of an indirect component is always expressed in storage units. 

The space reserved for the offset of an indirect component must be large enough to store 
the size of any value of the record type (the maximum potential offset). The compiler 
evaluates an upper bound MS of this size and treats an off^t as a component having an 
anonymous integer type whose range is 0.. MS. 

If C is the name of an indirect component, then the offset of this component can be 
denoted in a component clause by the implementation generated name C’OFFSET.

Appendix F, Version 5 









4.8J Implicit Components 

In some drcumsunoes, access to an object of a record type or to its components involves 
computing information which only depends on the discriminant values. To avoid 
reoomputation (which would degrade performance) the compiler stores this information 
in the record objects, updates it when the values of the discriminants are modified and 
uses it when the objects or its components are accessed. This information is stored in 
special components called implicit components. 

An implicit component may contain information which is used when the record object or 
several of its components are accessed. In this case the component will be included in any 
record object (the implicit component is considered to be declared before any variant 
part in the record type declaration). There can be two components of this kind; one is 
called RECX)RD_SIZE and the other VARIANTJNDEX. 

On the other hand an implicit component may be used to access a given record 
component. In that case the implicit component exists whenever the record component 
exists (the implicit component is considered to be declared at the same place as the 
record component). Components of this kind are called ARRAY_DESCRIPTORs or 
RF.CORD_DESCRII»TORs. 


•RECORDJIZE 

This implicit component is aeated by the compiler when the record type has a variant 
part and its discriminants are defaulted. It contains the size of the storage space 
necessary to store the current value of the record object (note that the storage effectively 
allocated for the record objea may be more than this). 

The value of a RECORD_SIZ£ component may denote a number of bits or a number of 
storage units. In general it denotes a number of storage units, but if any component 
clause specifies that a component of the record type has an oflset or a size which cannot 
be expressed using storage units, then the value designates a number of bits. 

The implicit component RECORD.SIZE must be large enough to store the maximum 
size of any value of the record type. The compiler evaluates an upper bound MS of this 
size and then considen the implicit component as having an anonymous integer type 
whose range is 0 _ MS. 

If R is the name of the record type, this implicit component can be denoted in a 
component clause by the implementation generated name R'RECORD.SIZE. This 
allows user control over the position of the implicit component in the record. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Charaaeristics 


33 





YARIASTJSDEX 

This implicit component is aeated by the compiler when the record type has a variant 
part. It indicates the set of components that are present in a record value. It is used when 
a discriminant check is to be done. 

Component lists in variant parts that themselves do not contain a variant part are 
numbered. These numbers are the possible values of the implicit component 
VARIANT.INDEX. 

type VEHICLE Is (AIRCRAFT. ROCKET. BOAT. CAR); 

type DESCRIPTION (KIND: VEHICLE :* CAR) is

SPEED: INTEGER; 
case KIND to

null; 
end case; 

when BOAT * > ~ 3 
STEAM : BOOLEAN; 
when ROCKET « > - 4 

STAGES: INTEGER; 

end case; 
end record; 

The vaiue of the variant index indicates the set of components that are present in a 
record value: 


Variant Indax

1 

CKIMO, SPEED, WHEELS. WINGSPAN} 

2 

{KIND, SPEED. WHEELS} 

3 

<KINO. SPEED. STEAM} 

4 

<KIHD, SPEED. STAGES} 


34 


Appendix F, Version 5 





A comparison between the variant index of a record value and the bounds of an interval 
is enough to check that a given component is present in the value: 


Coapantnt 

Intarval 




•• 


1 .. 2 

WIMCSPAN 

HtH 

STEAM 


STAGES 



The implicit component VARIANT_INDEX must be large enough to store the number V 
of component lists that don’t contain variant parts. The compiler treats this implicit 
component as having an anonymous integer type whose range is 1.. V. 

If R is the name of the record type, this implicit component can be denoted in a 
component clause by the implementation generated name R’VARIANTJNDEX. This 
allows user control over the position of the implicit component in the record. 


^ARRAYJ)ESCRJPTOR 

An implicit component of this kind is associated by the compiler with each record 
component whose subtype is an anonymous array subtype that depends on a discriminant 
of the record. It contains information about the component subtype. 

The struaure of an implicit component of kind ARRAY_DESCRiPTOR is not described 
in this documentation. Nevertheless, if a programmer is interested in specifying the 
location of a component of this kind using a component clause, size of the component 
may be obuined using the ASSEMBLY parameter in the COMPILE command. 

The compiler treats an implicit component of the kind ARRAY_DESCRIPTOR as having 
an anonymous array type. If C is the name of the record component whose subtype is 
described by the array descriptor, then this implicit component can be denoted in a 
component clause by the implementation generated name CARRAY.DESCRIPTOR. 

This allows user control over the position of the implicit component in the record. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


35 









•RECORDJ)ESaUFTOR 


An implicit component of this kind is associated by the compiler with each record 
component whose subtype is an anonymous record subtype that depends on a 
discriminant of the record. It contains information about the component subtype. 

The struaure of an implicit component of kind R£CORD_DESCRIPTOR is not described 
in this documentation. Nevertheless, if a programmer is interested in specifying the 
location of a component of this kind using a component clause, the size of the 
component may be obuined using the ASSEMBLY parameter in the COMPILE 
command. 

The compiler treats an implicit component of the kind RECORD_DESCRIPTOR as 
having an anonymous array type-. If C is the name of the record component whose 
subtype is described by the record descriptor, then this implicit component can be 
denoted in a component clause by the implementation generated name 
CRECORD^DESCRIPTOR. This allows user control over the position of the implicit 
component in the record. 


Suppression of Implicit Components 

The Alsys implementation provides the capability of suppressing the implicit 
components record^SIZE and/orVARIANTJNDEX from a record type. This can be 
done using an implementation defined pragma called IMPROVE. The syntax of this 
pragma is as follows; 

pragma IMPROVE (TIME | SPACE, (ON = >) simple_name); 

The first argument specifies whether TIME or SPACE is the primary criterion for the 
choice of the representation of the record type that is denoted by the second argument. 

If TIME is specified, the compiler inserts implicit components as described above. If on 
the other hand SPACE is specified, the compiler only insens a VARIANTJNDEX or a 
REC0RD_SIZ£ component if this component appears in a record representation clause 
that applies to the record type. A record represenution clause can thus be used to keep 
one implicit component while suppressing the other. 

A pragma IMPROVE that applies to a given record type can occur anywhere that a 
representation clause is allowed for this type.

Appendix F, Version 5 





4.8.4 Size of Record T^pes and Objects 

Size qf a ncord sub^pe 

Unless a component clause specifies that a component of a record type has an oCEset or a 
size which cannot be expressed using storage units, the size of a record subtype is 
rounded up to a whole number of storage units. 

The size of a constrained record subtype is obtained by adding the sizes of its 
components and the sizes of its gaps (if any). This size is not computed at compile time 

■ when the record subtype has non-static constraints, 

• when a component is an array or a record and its size is not computed at compile 
time. 

The size of an unconstrained record subtype is obtained by adding the sizes of the 
components and the sizes of the gaps (if any) of its largest variant. If the size of a 
component or of a gap cannot be evaluated exactly at compile time an upper bound of 
this size is used by the compiler to compute the subtype size. 

A size specification applied to a record type or first named subtype has no effect. The 
only size that can be specified using such a length clause is its usual size. Nevertheless, 
such a length clause can be useful to verify that the layout of a record is as expected by 
the application. 


Size ef an object cf a record subtype 

An objea of a constrained record subtype has the same size as its subtype. 

An objea of an unconstrained record subtype has the same size as its subtype if this size 
is less than or equal to 8K bytes. If the size of the subtype is greater than this, the object 
has the size necessary to store its current value; storage space is allocated and released as 
the discriminants of the record change.

Section 6 


Address Clauses 


6.1 Address Clauses for Objects 

An address clause can be used to specify an address for an objea as cribed in RM 13.5. 
When such a clause applies to an objea, the compiler does not allocate storage for the 
objea. The program accesses the objea using the address specified in the clause. It is 
the responsibility of the user therefore to make sure that a valid allocation of storage has 
been done at the specified address. 

An address clause is not allowed for task objects, for unconstrained records whose size is 
greater than 8k bytes or for a constant. 

There are a number of ways to compose a legal address expression for use in an address 
clause. The most direa ways are: 

■ For the case where the memory is defined in Ada as another objea, use the 
’ADDRESS attribute to obtain the argument for the address clause for the second 
object. 

■ For the case where the desired location is memoiy defined in assembly or another 
non-Ada language (is relocatable), an interfaced routine may be used to obtain the 
appropriate address from referencing information known to the other language. 

■ For the case where an address of an objea is known by its physical address, it must 
be mapped to the PharLap data segment before it can be accessed via an address 
clause. The reason being that SYSTEMADDRESS is a 32 bit offset in the standard 

• PharLap data segment 

Three Ada callable assembler routines are included in the Alsys Runtime to perform 
physical address mapping. These routines are ADA@MAP_PHYSICA1., 
ADA@MAP_PHYS_ADDR, and ADA@GET_PHYS_ADDR.~ ADA@MAP_PHYSICAL 
maps physical pages into the Ada address space. ADA@MAP_PHYS_aDDR maps pages 
that contain spedfied physical address and size into the Ada address space. 
ADA@GET_PHYS_ADDR returns the physical address that corresponds to a given Ada 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


41 







SYSTBMADDRESS. To call these routines from an Ada program, use the following 
spedlications: 


fmctlon NAP.PHTSICAL (PMTSICAL.MM : INTEGCt; — physical address 
PAGE.SIZE : INTEGEt) •• size in pages 
return SYSTEM.ADDRESS; ■■ virtual address 
pragea INTERFACE (ASSEmiER, NAP.PHYSICAL); 
pragM IHTERFACE.NAME (NAP.PHTSICAL, "ADAaNAP.PHYSICAL”); 

where: 

PHYSICAL.ADDR is the physical address of memory pages to map and must be a 
multiple of 4K. 

PAGE_SIZE is the number of physical 4K byte memory pages to map. 


fwKtion MAP_PHYS.ADOR (PHYSICAL.ADOR : INTEGER; -- Physical address 
nEMORT_slZE : INTEGER) •• size in bytes 
return SYSTEM.ADDRESS; ■* virtual address 
pragma INTERFACE (ASSEMBLER, MAP.PNYS^AODR); 
pragM INTERFACE.NAME (NAP_PHYSICAL, oADAaMAP.PHYS.ADDR"); 

where: 

PHYSICAL_ADDR is the physical address of memory to map. 

MEMORY_SIZE is the number of bytes of physical memory to map. 

Note: The entire page or pages that contain the physical address are mapped. If there 
are other objects on the same page, there is no need to call MAP_PHYS_ADDR for those 
objects as that page is already mapped. Use the address arithmetic routines in package 
SYSTEM to create the virtual addresses for those other objects. 


42 


Appendix F, Version 5 



function GET_ms_A0m (STSTEM_AOM : STSTEM.ADORESS) •• virtual oddrcst 
rttum INTEGER; ** phyticol oddroos 
proflM INTERFACE (ASSEMSLER, GETMAP_RNTS_ADDR>; 
pragM INTERFACE.NAME (NAP.PHTSICAL, •AOAaGET_PHrS_ADDR”); 

where: 

SYSTEM.ADDR is the Ada system address of an object 


With these specifications visible from your Ada program, the funaions MAP_PHYSICAL 
and MAP_PHYS_ADDR can be called to convert a known physical address to a virtual 
address of type SYSTEMADDRESS, which can be used in address clauses. 

For example, if there is a memory mapped device whose control register is 10 bytes long, 
with two 32 bit fields and one 16 bit field, located at physical address 8001S0 (hex). 
Assuming the above MAP_PHYS_ADDR funaion is visible, this control register can be 
accessed with the following declaration: 

type CONTROt_REG_TYPE it 
record 

Ft: INTEGER; 

F2: INTEGER; 

F3: SHORTJNTEGER; 
end record; 

for C0«TR0t_REG_TYPE use 
record 

Ft et 0 range 0..31; 

F2 at 0 range 31..63; 

F3 at 0 range 6A..79; 
end record; 

CONTROt_REG : CONTRa._REG_TYPE; 

for CtWTROL.REG use at MAP_PNYS_A00R (t6«800150«, 10); 

Note that very call to MAP_PHYSICAL or MAP_PHYS_ADDR causes a new entry to be 
created in the PharLap piage table, even if every call is for the same physical page. Make 
sure that for every physical page, MAP_PHYSICAL and MAP_PHYS_ADDR is executed 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


43 







only once during your program’s execution. If declaration such as the one above for 
CONTROL_REG is placed within the declarative part of a procedure, and the procedure 
is called repeatedly, one page table entry will be created for CONTROL.REG on every 
procedure call. Thus memory is wasted and you can eventually get a STORAGE.ERROR 
or CX}NSTRAINT_ERROR if the procedure is called continuously and memory does run 
out The proper place to put CONTROL_R£G, for this case, is within the declarative part 
of a package where MAP_PHYSICAL or MAP_PHYS_ADDR will be executed only once 
during program execution. 


6.2 Address Clauses for Program Units 

Address clauses for program units are not implemented in the current version of the 
compiler. 


63 Address Clauses for Interrupt Entries 

Address clauses for interrupt entries are supported. (See Chapter 7 of the Application 
Developer’s Guide for details.) 


44 


Appendix F, Version 5 





Section 7 


Unchecked Conversions 


Unchecked type conversions are described in [13.10.2]. The following restrictions apply 
to their use: 

■ Unconstrained arrays are not allowed as target types. Unconstrained record types 
without defaulted discriminants are not allowed as target types. Access types to 
unconstrained arrays are not allowed as target or source types. Notes also that 
UNCHECK£0_C0NVERSI0N cannot be used for an access to an unconstrained 
string. 

■ If the target type has a smaller size than the source type then the target is made of 
the least significant bits of the source. 

If the source and the target types are each of scalar or access type or if they are both of 
composite type, the effect of the funaion is to return the operand. 

In other cases the effea of unchecked conversion can be considered as a copy: 

■ If an unchecked conversion of a scalar or access source type to a composite target 
type is performed, the result is a copy of the source operand. The result has the size 
of the source. 

■ If an unchecked conversion of a composite source type to a scalar or access target 
type is performed, the result is a copy of the source operand. The result has the size 
of the urget.

Section 8 


Input-Output Packages 


The RM defines the predefined input-output packages SEQUENTIAL JO, DIRECT JO, 
and TEXTJO, and describes how to use the facilities available within these packages. 
The RM also defines the package lO.LXCEPTIONS, which specifies the exceptions that 
can be raised by the predefined input-output packages. 

In addition the RM outlines the package LOW_LEVELJO, which is concerned with low- 
level machine-dependent input-output, such as would possibly be used to write device 
drivers or access device registers. LOW_LEVEL_IO has not been implemented. The use 
of interfaced subprograms is recommended as an alternative. 


8.1 Correspondence between External Files and DOS Files 

Ada input-output is defined in terms of external files. Dau is read from and written to 
external files. Each external file is implemented as a sundard DOS file, including the use 
of STANDARDJNPUT and STANDARD.OUTPUT. 

The name of an external file can be either 

■ the null string 

■ a DOS filename 

■ a DOS special file or .i.Devioe name;device name (for example, CON and PRN) 

If the name is a null string, the associated external file is a temporary file and will cease 
to exist when the program is terminated. The file will be placed in the current directory 
and its name will be chosen by DOS. 

If the name is a DOS filename, the filename will be interpreted according to standard 
DOS conventions (that is, relative to the current directory). The exception 
NAME_ERROR is raised if the name part of the filename has more than 8 charaaers or 
if the extension part has more than 3 charaaers. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


47 







If an existing DOS file is specified to the CREATE procedure, the contents of the file will 
be deleted before writing to the file. 

If a non<xisting directory is specified in a file path name to CREATE, the direaory will 
not be created, and the exception NAME_ERROR is raised. 


8.2 Error Handling 

DOS errors are translated into Ada exceptions, as defined in the RM by package 
IO_EXC£PTIONS. In particular, DEVlCE_ERROR is raised in cases of drive not teady, 
unknown media, disk full or hardware errors on the disk (such as read or write fault). 


8J The FORM Parameter 

The form parameter is a string, formed from a list of attributes, with attributes separated 
by commas. The string is not case sensitive. The attributes specify: 

• Buffering 

BUFFER_SIZE = > sizejnjrytes 
m Appending 

APPEND => YES I NO 

■ Truncation of the name by DOS 

TRUNCATE « > YES | NO 

■ DIRECTJO on UNCONSTRAINED objects 

RECORD_SIZE = > sizejnjrytes 


where: 

BUFFER.SIZE: Controls thv ze of the internal buffer. This option is not sup¬ 
ported for DIF ECTJO. The default value is 1024. This option has no effea when 
used by TEXT.IO with an external file that is a charaaer device, in which case the 
size of the buffer will be 0. 


48 


Appendix F, Version 5 





ATPEND: If YES output is appended to the end of the existing file. If NO output 
overwrites the existing file. This option is not supported for DIRECTJO. The 
deCiultitNO. 

TRUNCATE: If YES the file name will be automatically truncated if it is bigger than 
8 characters. The default value is NO, meaning that the exception NAME_ERROR 
will be raised if the name is too long. 

RECORD_SIZE: This option is supported only for DIRECTJO. This attribute 
controls the logical record length of the external file. 

• When DIRECTJO is instantiated with an unconstrained type the user is 
required to specify the RECORD_SIZE attribute (otherwise USE_ERROR 
will be raised). The value given must be larger or equal to the largest record 
which is going to written. If a larger record is procebed the exception 
USE.ERROR will be raised. 

- When DIRECTJO is instantiated with a constrained type the user is not 
required to specify the RECORD^SIZE but if the RECORD JIZE is specified 
the only possible value would be the element size in bytes. Any other values 
will raise USE.ERROR. 

The exception USE_ERROR is raised if the form STRING in not correct or if a non 
supported attribute for a given package is used. 


Example: 

FORM ■> TRUNCATE => YES, APPEND ■> YES, BUFFER_SIZE => 20480" 

8.4 Sequential Files 

For sequential access the file is viewed as a sequence of values that are transferred in the 
order of their appearance (as produced by the program or run-time environment). This 
is sometimes called a stream file in other operating systems. Each object in a sequential 
file has the same binary representation as the Ada object in the executable program. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


49 



8.5 Direct Files 


For direct access the file is viewed as a set of elements occupying consecutive positions in 
a linear order. The position of an element in a direct file is specified by its index, which is 
an integer of subtype POSmVE.COUNT. 

DIRECTJO only allows input-output for constrained ^pes. If DIRECT^IO is instantiated 
for an unconstrained type, all calls to CREATE or OPEN will raise USE.ERROR. Each 
object in a direa file have the same binary representation as the Ada object in the 
executable program. All elements within the file will have the same length. 


8.6 Text Files 

Text files are used for the input and output of information in ASCII character form. 

Each text file is a sequence of charaaers grouped into lines, and lines are grouped into a 
sequence of pages. 

All text file column numbers, line numbers, and page numbers are values of the subtype 

posrnvE_couNT. 

Note that due to the definitions of line terminator, page terminator, and file terminator 
in the RM, and the method used to mark the end of file under DOS, some ASCII files do 
not represent well-formed TEXTJO files. 

A text file is buffered by the Runtime Executive unless 

a it names a device (for example, CON or PRN). 

a it is STANDARD_INPUT or STANDARD^OUTPUT band has not been redirected. 

If not redireaed, prompts written to STANDARD_OUTPUTwith the procedure PUT will 
appear before (or when) a GET (or GET_L1NE) occurs. 

The functions END_OF_PAGE and END_OF_FlLE always return FALSE when the file is a 
device, which includes the use of the file^ON, and STANDARD_INPUT when it is not 
redireaed. Programs which would like to check for end of file when the file may be a 
device should handle the exception END_ERROR instead, as in the following example;

END_ERROR is raised for STANDARDJNPUT when ^ Z (ASCILSUB) is entered at the 
keyboard. 

8.7 Access Protection of External Files 

All DOS access protections exist when using files under DOS. If a file is open for read 
only access by one process it can not be opened by another process for readAvrite access. 


8.8 The Need to Close a File Explicitly 

The Ruruime Executive will flush all buffers and close all open files when the program is 
terminated, either normally or through some exception. 

However, the RM does not define what happens when a program terminates without 
closing all the opened Tiles. Thus a program which depends on this feature of the 
Ruruime Executive might have problems when ported to another system. 


8.9 Limitation on the Procedure RESET 

An internal Gle opened for input cannot be RESET for output However, an internal Tile 
opened for output can be RESET for input, and can subsequently be RESET back to 
output

8.10 Sharing of External Files and Tasking Issues 

Several internal files can be associated with the same external file only if all the internal 
files are opened with mode IN.MODE. However, if a file is opened with mode 
OUT.MODE and then changed to IN_MODE with the RESET procedure, it cannot be 
shared. 

Care should be taken when performing multiple input-output operation:; on an external 
file during tasking because the order of calls to the I/O primitives is unpredictable. For 
example, two strings output by TEXTJO.PUT_LINE in two differeni tasks may appear in 
the output file with interleaved characters. Synchronization of I/O in cases such as this is 
the users responsibility. 

The TEXTJO files STANDARDJNPUT and STANDARD_OUTPUT arc shared by all 
tasks of an Ada program. 

If TEXT_10.STANDARD_INPUT is not redirected, it will not block a program on input. 
All tasks not wailing for input will continue running.

Other Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


10.1 Use of the Floating-Point Coprocessor 

Floating point coprocessor instructions are used in programs that perform arithmetic on 
floating point values in some fixed point operations and when the FLOATJO or 
FIXEDJO packages of TEXTJO are used. The mantissa of a fixed point value may be 
obtained through a conversion to an appropriate integer type. This conversion does not 
use floating point operations. Object code running on the 80386 using floating point 
instruaions can still execute without the coprocessor if the software floating point 
emulation is linked with the object code (see Binder option FLOAT in User’s Guide, 
Section S.2). See Appendix D of iiit Application Developer’s Guide for more details. 

If a program requiring floating point operation is not linked with the floating point 
emulator, the Runtime Executive will detect the absence of the floating point coprocessor 
by raising CONSTRAlNT_ERROR. 


10.2 Characteristics of the Heap 

All objects CTeated by allocators go into the heap. Also, portions of the Runtime Execu¬ 
tive representation of task objects, including the task sucks, are allocated in the heap. 

UNCH£CKED_DEALLOCATION is implemented for all Ada access objects except access 
objects to tasks. Use of UNCHECKED_DEALLOCATION on a task objca will lead to 
unpredicuble results. 

All objects whose visibility is linked to a subprogram, task body, or block have their 
storage reclaimed at exit, whether the exit is normal or due to an exception. Effectively 
pragma CONTROLLED is automatically applied to all access types. Moreover, all 
compiler temporaries on the heap (generated by such operations as funaion calls 
returning unconstrained arrays, or many concatenations) allocated in a scope are 
deallocated upon leaving the scope. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


55 





Note that the programmer may force heap redamation of temporaries associated with 
any statements by enclosing the statement in a begin.. end block. This is especially 
useful when complex concatenations or other heap-intensive operations are performed 
in loops, and can reduce or eliminate STORAGE.ERRORs that might otherwise occur. 

The maximum size of the heap is limited only by available memory. This includes the 
amount of physical memory (RAM) and the amount of virtual memory (hard disk swap 
space). 

103 Characteristics of Tasks 

The default task stack size is IK bytes (32K bytes for the environment task), but by using 
the Binder option STACK.TASK the size for all task stacks in a program may be set to a 
size from IK bytes to 64K bytes. 

Normal priority rules are followed for preemption, where PRIORITY values are in the 
range 1.. 10. A task with undefined priority (no pragma PRIORITY) is considered to be 
lower than priority 1. 

The maximum number of active tasks is restricted only by memory usage. 

The accepter of a rendezvous executes the accept body code in its own stack. 

Rendezvous with an empty accept body (for synchronization) does not cause a context 
switch. 

The main program waits for completion of ail tasks dependent upon library packages 
before terminating. 

Abnormal completion of an aborted task takes place immediately, except when the ab¬ 
normal task is the caller of an entry that is engaged in a rendezvous, or if it is in the 
process of aaivating some tasks. Any such task becomes abnormally completed as soon 
as the state in question is exited. 

The message 

GLOBAL BLOCKING SITUATION DETECTED 

is printed to STANDARD_OLJTPUT when the Runtime Executive detects that no further 
progress is possible for any task in the program. The execution of the program is then 
abandoned.

Appendix F, Version 5 


10.4 DeHnition of a Main Subprogram 

A libraiy anit can be used as a main subprogram if and only if it is a procedure that is not 
generic and that has no formal parameters. 

The Alsys DOS Ada Compiler imposes no additional ordering constraints on 
compilations beyond those required by the language.
