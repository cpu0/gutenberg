A Neptune Aerocapture Systems vnal« as is completed to determine Ihc fcasibilit) . hene- 
Tit . 1 1 ■ ■ I risk of an aeroshcll aerocapture system for Neptune and to identifv technology gaps 
and technology performance goals. The !iii-li fidelity systems analysis is completed by a five 
center NASA team and includes the following disciplines and analyses: science: mission de- 
sign: acroshell configuration screening and definition: interplanetary navigation analyses; 
atmosphere modeling: computational fluid dynamics for aerodynamic performance and da- 
tabase definition; initial stability analyses; guidance development: atmospheric flight sjmula- 
tiitn; computational fluid dynamics and radiation analyses for aerohcating environment 
definition; thermal protection system design, concepts and sizing; mass properties; struc- 
tures; spacecraft design and packaging; and mass sensitivities. 

Results show that aerocapture can deliver 1.4 times more mass to Neptune orbit than an 
all- propulsive system for the same launch vehicle. In addition aerocapture results in a 3-4 
year reduction in trip lime compared to all-propulsive systems. Aerocapture is feasible and 
performance is adequate for the Neptune aerocapture mission. Monte Carlo simulation re- 
sults show Ml"' . successful capture for all cases including conservative assumptions on at- 
mosphere and njiigation. Knabling technologies for this mission include TI'S manufactur- 
ing; and aero thermodynamic methods and validation for determining coupled 3-D convec- 
tion, radiation and ablation aerobeating rates and loads, and the effects on surface recession.

pherc compared to an all-propulsive vehicle at the same des- 
tination with the some launch vehicle. Aerocapture utilizes 
aerodynamic forces on a vehicle during a single pass through 
a destinations atmosphere to capture into orbit about that 
destination, instead of a large propulsive delta V maneuver. 
An aerocapture flight profile schematic showing the primary 
aerocapture event sequence is shown in Fig. I. 

Aerocapture at Neptune is characterized by high entry 
velocities (28-30 knvsec incttial) into a H He atmosphere, 
and capture into a high energy science otbit enabling Tni.ni 
fly by*. Table 1 provides a comparison of the Neptune aero- 
capture reference mission, described in this paper, to a repre-

APPROACH 

A multi-center aerocaplurc systems analysis team, including NASA engineers and scientists from Ames Re- 
search Center (ARC), the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Johnson Space Center (JSC). Langlcy Research Center 
(LaRC). and Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). led by Langlcy Research Center, was kicked off in October 
2002 and completed in October 2003. The effort was funded through the Code S In Space program. 

The mission objectives and initial spacecraft design for the reference concepts arc based on JPL's TcamX study*

arc completed to provide understanding of the vehicle requirements and selection of the reference concept and mis- 
sion. Higher fidelity analyses arc completed on the reference concept including mission design; acroshcll configura- 
tion screening and definition; interplanetary navigation analyses for determination of approach navigation delivery 
dispersions; atmosphere modeling; computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for aerodynamic performance and database 
definition, initial stability analyses: guidance development: atmospheric flight simulation: CFD and radiation analy- 
ses for acrohcating environments: TPS design, concepts and sizing: mass properties: acroshcll and spacecraft struc- 
tural design and sizing: spacecraft design and packaging: and mass sensitivities. 

SCIENCE 

The Neptune mission includes a Neptune orbiter and two probes. The orbitcr science mission includes two years 
in Neptune orbit. The science orbit is selected to enable Triton llybys. The Neptune Orbitcr science instruments 
were selected to be representative, and include visible imager. IR imaging spectrometer. IV imaging spectrometer. 
thcrmal-IR imaging spectrometer, ion and neutral mass spectrometer, magnetometer, chargcd-particlc detector, 
snia wave spectrometer, microwave radiometer. USO (radio occultations) and two identical probes.* 



MISSION DESIGN AND REFERENCE 
CONCEPT SELECTION 

Many alternate mission designs uic considered.* 
Including launch on Delta IVH and Alios 551: grav- 
ity assists utilizing various combinations of Venus, 
Eaitli and Jupiter. SEP m various power levels or 
chemical stages; and acrocapturc versus chemical 
insertion. Launch dates alter 2015 arc considered, to 
provide time for technology development. An SEP. 
acrocapturc system is basclincd for the reference 
architecture. 

The reference mission selected is a compromise 
between trip time, net delivered mass, menial entry 
velocity, theoretical corridor width and acrohcating. 
Fig, 2 and 3 illustrate the net delivered moss and 
entry velocity vs. flight time for a range of 
SE Pi 1 acrocapturc concepts. In general, as flight lime 
decreases the net delivered mass decreases and entry 
velocity increases- The Delta IVH VJGA trajectories 
are selected for the reference mission concept based 
on delivered mass capability. Trip limes less than 10 
years are eliminated due to Uic rapid decrease in de- 
livered mass capability and rapid increase in entry 
velocity (and corresponding acrohcating) with 
shorter trip times. 

To further select a trip time, entry velocity, and 
required vehicle LI), an initial trade in available 
corridor width as a function of vehicle I. I> and en- 
try velocity is completed. Fig. 4 shows the theoreti- 
cal corridor width vs. entry velocity and L D for 
acrocapturc into a 350.000 km apoapsis orhit at 
Neptune. The results in Fig. 4 illustrate several 
points. Theoretical corridor increases with both I I ' 
and entry velocity. An L'D = 0.8 vehicle at 28 
km'scc provides approximately the same Uicorctical 
corridor width as an L'D = 0.6 vehicle at slightly 
greater than 30 knvscc. In addition, to achieve rea- 
sonable theoretical corridor widths for acrocapturc 
into the high energy elliptic orbit requires vehicles 
with significantly greater L'D than the high heritage 
blunt body configurations. (Ex.. The theoretical 
corridor width is only approximately 0.8 degrees for 
an LD = 025 for a 70" sphere cone.) 

To provide an initial estimated theoretical corri- 
dor required for comparison to the available corri- 
dor width, a quick corridor margin analysis is com- 
pleted for combinations of '..'.> = 0.6, 0.8 and 28 
and 30 km'scc entry velocity. The theoretical corri- 
dor must be adequate to accommodate dispersions, 
uncertainties, and variability in approach navigated 
slates at atmospheric interface, aerodynamics, at- 
mosphere, and guidance robustness. Initial estimates 
for navigated errors show ±.5° 3a errors in entry 
flight path angle at 28 km'scc and ±.6° 3rt errors in 
entry flight path angle at 30 km'scc. Aerodynamic 
uncertainties can be conservatively estimated to

and 30 kmscc, L/D = 0.8 and 28

I.I) = 0.6 and 28 km'scc case show 
the estimated corridor loss due to ap- 
proach navigated errors, aerodynamics 
uncertainty, and total mean atmos- 
phere variability and uncertainty. If 
these losses are RSS'd a required theo- 
retical corridor width can be estimated 
for use in comparison to the total 
available theoretical corridor width. 

For this case, the required and available theoretical corridor widths ore approximately the same, well within the ac- 
curacy of die estimate, and again, high frequency atmosphere perturbations are not included. Because of the early 
phase of design, the objective for selection of the reference concept is to select a concept with margin greater dian 
the RSS required corridor w idth. As a result, an L'D = 0.8 vehicle with a 29 km'scc entry velocity is selected for the 
reference concept, with an L/D .'■ vehicle kept as on option. 

The reference concept is dicrcforc described as follows. The mission launches February 17,2017, on a Delia IV 
II The launch vehicle fairing is 5 m in diameter with a 4.572 m static payload diameter. The total launch capability 
is 5964 kg, with a launch C3 of 18.44 kntf/scc 1 . The SEP system is a 30 kW EOL, 6 engine SEP system, that oper- 
ates in 3 AU. A Venus. Jupiter gravity assist is utilized. The total trip time is 10.25 years, with Neptune arrival in 
2027. Two probes are released at l-l monUis(l week apart). The probes cuter at E-4 hours and E-2 hours. Aerocap- 
turc inertial entry velocity at Neptune is 29 kmscc. atmospheric interface is 1000 km above I bar The orbit is 157° 
retrograde, 430,000 km by 3986km. The science mission includes two years in Neptune orbit for a total 1225 year 
Neptune Oibitcr mission. 



AKROSHKU. CONFIGURATION 

Acrostic) I configuration screening is completed to develop shap 
while maximizing volumetric efficiency and minimizing M/CDA. 
including cllipsleds. flattened cllipsleds, high fineness sphere cones 
The vehicle mass and volume are fixed, the shapes within each 
vehicle configuration class arc varied paramctrically. Newtonian 
aerodynamics, varilicd with CFD. is utilized to screen the con- 
figurations for L'D and M'CDA over a range of angle of attack. 
Packaging efficiency is also screened through determination of 
vehicle volumetric efficiency. Based on these analyses, the flat- 
tened cllipslcd is selected for the reference aeroshcll configura- 
tion. Details of die configuration screening and vehicle selection 
arc contained in Rcf. 5. 

DESIGN CYCLES 

Two design cycles arc completed for the Neptune Orbitcr. 
The original objectives were to package 3 probes within the 
aeroshcll of the orbitcr. As a result the design cycle one vehicle is 
5.5 m in length with M'CDA estimated at 273 kg'm . and an 
acrohcating design trajectory developed at 400 kg m2 to provide 
mass growth margin. With this design, the system mass margin 
on the Delta IVH SEP VJGA was estimated to be less than the 
desired 351V In addition, further analysis shows that the science 
objectives can be met with the probes carried externally and ic- 



es with L'D = 0.8, and I.I) = 0.6 as an option. 
Several aeroshcll shape classes arc considered 
biconics and bent biconics. as shown in Fig. 6.

photographically scaled I'ram a 5.5 m 
length vehicle to a 2.88 ni length, shown 
in Fig. 7. The entry allocation is 2200 
kg. resulting in a ballistic coefficient of 
895 kgm ; . This M'CDA is used for both 
the performance analyses and the design 
trajectories for the acroheating and struc- 
ture design. 

NAVIGATION 

Navigation analyses are completed at 
28 and 30 km/sec with the Mars Recon- 
naissance Orbitcr camera and an Entry - 
3 day data cut-off- In addition, results arc 
completed with an MRO camera wldi 
two limes die pictures and with an ad- 
vanced MRO camera. As a comparison 
results ore also completed for an Entry - 
2 day data cut-off Results arc shown in 
Fig. X. See Rcf. 6 for detailed discussion 
on the navigation analysis and results. 

Monte Carlo simulations arc com- 
pleted for the reference vehicle using 
1.51° 3a entry flight path angle disper- 
sions. This is approximately equivalent 
to an MRO camera with 2x pictures or to 
an advanced MRO camera, each with a 
more conservative Entry* -3 day data cut- 
off. A change to Entry -2 day cut-off 
significantly reduces the delivery entry 
dispersions as shown in Fig. 8.

ATMOSPHERIC MODFXING 

A NcpluneCRAM atmosphere model is developed 
based on Voyager and other data. Variability includes all 
measurement uncertainty, residual uncertainty due to tur- 
bulence and waves, and die expected variability due to 
latitude, altitude, seasonal and time of day variation*. The 
atmosphere composition is 80% Hi -19% He. -1% CH4. 
Fig. 9 illustrates the total moon density variability as a 
function of altitude. Note that the range of aerocapture 
altitudes is between approximately 100 and 300 km. The 
parameter Fminmax is utilized to define the range of den- 
sity profiles. The mean density profile is represented by 
Fminmax = 0. the minimum density profile is represented 
by Fminmax = -I, and the maximum density profile is 
represented by Fminmax = +1. 

Fig. 10 illustrates the latitudinal variation of density for 
the particular arrival season of the reference concept. This 
variation of Fminmax with latitude is represented by

with rpscalc = I representing the greatest expected variability for Neplunc. The rpscalc = 1 results in Fig. 9. show a 
sample of how the high frequency enment can alter the mean variability. Note that the high frequency content can 
act to increase or decrease die mean density with altitude, in addition lo adding die high frequency content- Rpscalc

The reference concept performance, as shown below, is based on the latitudinal variation of Fminmax and 
rpscalc = I . Acrohcating and structure design trajectories are based on the full range of Fminmax and rpscalc = I. 

AERODYNAMICS 

The aerodynamic database is developed from viscous LAURA CFD analysis of the reference configuration. The 
vehicle trims at 40" angle of attack with an axial eg location relative to the vehicle length of 0.5 1 all of the nose, and 
a vertical eg relative to the vehicle length of .0166 below 
the vehicle water! inc. For the trimmed vehicle 
L/D = 0.1*06. CD = 1.405, CL = 1.133. Initial stability 
analysis shows that the llat-bottnm cllipslcd is longitudi- 
nally and laterally stable. 

The aerodynamic uncertainties arc based on die JSC cl- 
lipslcd analysis for Mars, consistent with the X-33 aerody- 
namic database uncertainty model in Rcf. 9. As shown In 
Fig. 12. CA: ±0.048 and CN: ±0.12. each using base urea 
as the reference. The trim angle of attack uncertainty is 
assumed to be ±4". dclincd in this initial analysis to be 
double that for a typical blunt body, such as a 70" sphere 
cone Cg uncertainties arc ±0.5% for axial eg relative to 
the vehicle length and ±0. 1 25% for radial cc relative to the 
vehicle length. Based on stacked aerodynamic uncertain- 
ties, the LI) uncertainty is *26.4% and -22%. Based on an 
RSS of die aerodynamic uncertainties, the L D uncertainty 
is -I3.5 1 "" and -14.3%. The Monte Carlo variability for 
2001 case* is between the RSS and stacked uncertainties." Figure 12. Aerodynamic uncertainties/ 

Note that the cITccts of large IPS recession and resul- 
tant shape change on the vehicle aerodynamics and cg location have not been quantified. This analysis was outside

GUIDANCE 

HYPAS guidance (ref I0| was chosen Ibf the Titan acrocapturc systems analysis. HYPAS utilizes vehicle lift 
and bank angle control (htough ihe atmosphere lo target the desired exit nrbil apoapsis and inclination. Il is un ana- 
lytically derived algorithm based on deceleration due lo drag and altitude rate error feedback. This analytic, non- 
iterative, nn-the-fly approach leads to efficient code (~320 source lines in Fortran), minimal storage requirements, 
and fast and consistent execution limes. 

HYPAS consists of two phases: h Capture Phase: Establishes pseudo-equilibrium glide conditions: 2) Exit 
Phase: Eiil conditions arc predicted analytically assuming a constant altitude rate followed by constant acceleration 
Tbc lift vector is adjusted to null the error between predicted and target apoapsis, and bank reversals arc used to 
keep inclination errors within the desired limits. Results show excellent performance and an ability to capture 93V .. 
of the theoretical corridor. 

PERFORMANCE/SIMULATION 

The reference concept performance is simulated in a Monte Carlo simulation" and includes each of the uncertain- 
ties and dispersions as described above. Fig. I3a-d show the reference concept Monte Carlo results. The reference 
concept is an L.D = 0.8 vehicle, with M'CDA = 895 kg'nr. The target orbit, to enable Triton tlybys. is retrograde 
with un upoopsis of 430,000 km. and a penapsis of 3986 km. Uncertainties included in the Monte Carlo include 
navigation, with 10.51° 3a entry (light path angle at atmospheric interface, atmosphere variability as a function of 
latitude and high frequency perturbations corresponding to rpscalc = I. and aerodynamic uncertainties described 
above.

All 2001 Monte Carlo trajectories successfully capture. Approximately 6<<";. of the cases achieve apoapsis within 
ihc apoapsis target range uf 355,000 kni and 5(10,000 km In each of the Monte Carlo cases an apoapsis correction 
delta V, along with the pcriapsis raise delta V, is utilized to corrccl the orhil to ihe largcl of 430.000 hy 39S6 kni. 
The total delta V, as shown in Fig. 13b, is 141 msec for the mean for the combined pcriapsis raise and apoapsis 
cotteclion and ,'M) msec 99.87 percentile. Figures c and d illusiraic ihc entry g loading and the peak heal rate vs. 
total heat load based on a stagnation point convcctivc indicator for a Im nose radius. The 3a high g's are 17.6 g's. 
which arc less than the 22. 1 g's used to design ihc vehicle structure. The 3o high beat rate and heat load stagnation 
point convcctivc indicators arc 2957 Worn' and 295 U'cm', rcspeciively, compared lo ihc 3250 W v m and 290 
kJcnr stagnation point convcctivc rale and load indicators of the reference actohcating design trajectory. 

The apoapsis error (prior to delta V correction) for Nep- 
tune is greater than that seen in previous studies. Before any 
apoapsis correction, and a 430.000 km apoapsis target, the 
3a range in Neptune apoapsis is 371*300 to 832.700 km Fur 
comnarisun die range in apoapsis at Titan, prior to any delta 
V to adjust apoapsis. and a 1700 km apoapsis target, is 1499 
km to ISX3 km. The larger apoapsis errors at Neptune com- 
pared to Titan result from the high energy Neptune target 
orbit. At Neptune, ihc acrocaplure exit velocity is very close 
lo ihc Neptune escape velocity, resulting in a high sensitivity 
of apoapsis lo acrocaplure exit velocity. For example ihc 
ratio of the acrocaplure exit velocity lo escape velocity al 
Neptune is 0.97. The acrocaplure to escape velocity at Tilan 
is0.69. lu 

The updated range of dispersions and uncertainties in 
navigation, aerodynamics, and atmosphere, arc utilized in 
Fig. 13c. to assess die corridor margin for comparison to ihc 
original estimates in Fig. 5. Tbc slacked aerodynamic uncer- 
tainties arc used, and are similar lo ihc assumptions earlier. 
Note that die atmosphere uncertainties are significantly less 

than the initial estimates. This results from the reduced range of Fminmax, by incorporating ihc variation of density 
with latitude as opposed to utilizing a global range, and also due lo Ihe higher vehicle ballistic coefficient and re- 
duced atmosphere variability at lower alutudes. The revised estimates show significant margin above the KSS value 
The effects of high frequency density pcrturbalions and additional aerodynamic uncertainties due to surface reces- 
sion arc not represented in ihc estimate, however. Results suggest dial (here may be margin in ihc performance de- 
sign that could be utilized lo reduce die vehicle L'D requirement, reduce die entry velocity or to accommodate in- 
creased atmosphere variability resulting from an increase vcliicle size (and lower M CDA) in an effort to reduce 
aero healing.

AN<;i.K OF ATTACK MODULATION OPTION 

Utilizing angle of attack control as an option to augment 
ihc bank angle modulation is considered to assess any poten- 
tial benefits lo performance and robustness. Angle of at- 
tack modulation provides increased responsiveness to high 
frequency density perturbations and may assist with uncer- 
tainties in trim angle of attack. Angle of attack control could 
be provided with movement of an internal ballast or possibly 
with an aerodynamic control surface. Fig. 14a, b and c show 
results from the same Monte Carlo, one case without angle of 
attack control, and one case with ±5" angle of attack modula- 
tion. As shown, alpha modulation results in a significant re- 
duction in apoapsis dispersions, delta V and g's.

namic uncertainties deseribed earlier. Fig. 15a illus- 
trates the range of heat rate vs. heat load for the 
Monte Carlo compared to ihc lift up lift down range. 
The Monte Carlo heat rate range is 2050-3250 
W'cm ; . and heat load range is 195-290 U'enV. The 
lili up. lift down peak heat range is 3155-1122 
W tin . respectively. The lift up lift down heat load 
range is I85-W2 VJ-'cm". respectively. Typically the 
vehicle is designed to fly significanily closer to the 
center of the lift up lift down heat rate and load 
range dian shown for these results. In litis case, the 
guidance is designed to fly lift down early in the 
entry trajcclory to allow successful targeting of the 
high-energy orbu apoapsis with the high ballistic 
coefficient vehicle. Fig. 15b illustrates the time 
variation of the stagnation point heating indicator 
for trajectory #1647 compared to dial for die mini- 
mum atmosphere lift up and maximum atmosphere 
lift down trajectories. This further illustrates that the 
design and corresponding Monte Carlo results are 
skewed toward die lift up high heal rate pmfilcs. 

Because of diesc results, die peak heat load tra- 
jcclory from the Manic Carlo. "I647, which also 
has -98 percentile peak heal rate of 2O01 trajecto- 
ries, is selected as the reference trajectory for the

down trajectory for TPS siting.

analyses, including analysis of Galileo, die "high" esti- 
mate is well outside the expected range of acrohcating 
environ men is. These anohcating environments arc util- 
ized io complete TPS selection and sizing. 

TPS materials considered for the hcatshield include 
carbon phenolic, reduced density carbon phenolic, and 
the Genesis carbon fiber form with carbon-carbon face 
sheet concept. Results of TPS sizing for the "Low" and 
"Medium" acrohcating ore completed and shown in Fig. 
18a and b. for the nose and wind side, respectively. ' 
"Medium" levels arc utilized tor the Reference. The nose 
region is characterized by significant recession. Fabrica- 
tion of the tape-wrapped carbon phenolic or Genesis con- 
cept may not be possible for these environments. As a 
result a hilly dense carbon phenolic is selected for the 
nose region of the reference concept. However. TPS 
thickness in die nose region is beyond current TPS manu- 
facturing experience for this shape and acreage. If the 
acrohcaiing rates and loads remain at the levels esti- 
mated. TPS manufacturing approaches will be enabling 
for die Neptune acrocapture mission. For the wind side, 
the reduced density carbon phenolic is selected, bui addi- 
tional work is needed to design and assess the ability of 
this type of concept to accommodate die heat rales esti- 
mated.

COMPARISON TO AU.-PKOPI I-SIY K MISSION 

Several alternate mission concepts are shown in Table 4 lor comparison to the reference concept labeled "Op- 
tion B2". Each option shows the mass that can be delivered to Neptune prior to Insertion, labeled "Prc-NOI Net 
Delivered Mass..*' and the mass required to capture into Neptune orbit. For the chemical insertion the chemical pro- 
pcllant and chemical dry mass arc calculated based on the "Prc-NOI Net Delivered Mass". For the acrocapturc sys- 
tem, the "Acrocapturc System" mass is based on the reference concept and is fixed at 1119 kg. The "Payload in 
Neptune Orbit" is defined based on the reference concept and is 792 kg. "System Margin" represents either a sur- 
plus or deficit in the capability of the system to deliver the 792 kg into orbit. The System Margin should be between 
15-20% for adequate margin. 

To determine the benefit of acrocapturc compared loan all-propulsive system, the acrocapturc system that deliv- 
ers the maximum mass to Neptune orbit (Delta I VII. EJGA, SEP, Aero) can he compared to the all-propulsive sys- 
tem that delivers the maximum mass to Neptune orbit (Delta IVII. EJGA. SEP. Chcm). each for the same launch 
vehicle. For the all-propulsive option, a maximum of 1 167 kg can be delivered into Neptune orbit (zero margin). 
For the acrocapturc option, assuming a fixed acrocapturc mass fraction of 5914 (includes acrocapturc dcllaV). 1614 
kg can be delivered into Neptune orbit (zero margin). Therefore acrocapturc results in approximately 1 .4 times 
more mass in Neptune orbit as compared to an all-propulsive system. 

In addition. Table 4 shows significant trip time savings for the acrocapturc systems as compared to the all- 
propulsive systems.

SrMMARY AND TE('HNOLO(;Y 

Acrucapiurocanilclivcf 1.4 times more moss to Neptune than an all-propulsive system fur the same launch vehi- 
cle. Acfocopture is feasible and performance is adequate for the Neptune acrocapturc mission. Monte Carlo simula- 
tion results show 100% success for all cases including conservative assumptions on atmosphere and navigation. Ad- 
ditional analyses are required tu assess the amount of surface recession from coupled 3-D convec- 
uvc-radiu live, ablation analyses, determine the aerodynamics and uncertainties resulting from lime and path depend- 
ent shape change, and evaluate the clYcct on guidance and control algorithm design, and performance. The Neptune 
spacecraft can be successfully packaged in an acrushcll and result In -S'\. unallocated mass while meeting the re- 
quired mass margins. 

Technologies identified in the study as requiring development are grouped into three categories: enabling tech- 
nologies, strongly enhancing technologies and enhancing technologies. Technologies annotated with an asterisk arc 
catcgorl/cd based on current understanding. Additional assessment could change the categories. 



The cnahhng technologies identified include 

• TPS Manufacturing. TPS thicknesses arc beyond current manufacturing experience for carbon phenolic for 
this shape and acreage. 

• AcrothcrmodynamK methods and validation 



. i 



o Acrothcrmodynamics arc characterized by high radiative and convcelivc acrohcating. coupled convee- 

l ion 'radial ion 'ablati on. and significant surface recession with effects on vehicle aerodynamics on a more 

complex shape. 
o Coupled convection tadi at ion 1 ablation capability for three-dimensional llowliclds is needed for definition 

of acrohcating environments. TPS requirements, and vehicle shape change. 
o Ait approach is needed to determine and represent the aerodynamics 1 uncertainties on the time varying path 

dependent shapes and corresponding masses in an acrodatabasc and simulation. 

The strongly enhancing technologies identified include 

• Guidance Algorithm* - Existing guidance algorithms have been demonstrated to provide adequate perform- 
ance. However, improvements are possible to improve performance, to determine the ability to reduce heat 
loads and to accommodate lime varying, path dependent shape and ballistic coefficient change 

• Flight Control Algorithm* - Algorithms must be able to accommodate shape change uncertainties 

• Atmosphere Modeling - Neptune General Circulation Model output is needed to represent the dynamic (.in- 
ability of the atmosphere. 

• Reduced Mass TPS concepts, ex.. reduced density carbon phenolic, could be utilized to decrease aemshcll 
mass. 

• Utilizing the TPS as a structural clement may reduce the combined structure plus TPS mass. 

• Alpha Modulation* reduces the dispersions in apoapsis, provides additional and more rapid response to density 
perturbations, and provides additional margin for trim angle of attack uncertainties. 

• Dual Stage MMRTGs 

• Dcployable Ka-Band HGA 

The enhancing technologies identified include 

• Automated navigation, improved optical navigation camera. 

• Miniaturized ACS components. 

• Lower Mass. Power Science Instruments 



FUTVRE WORK 

Several areas are recommended for future systems analysis in addition to the specific technology items listed 
above. Recommendations are as follows. 

Complete partial design cycles for one or more intermediate (between 2.88 m-5.5 in length scale) vehicle sizes. 
There may be a minimum mass vehicle between the 2.88 m and 5.5 m length vehicle. The trade is surface area vs. 
arcal density of the combined TPS and structure. 

The current design has 460 kg unallocated mass. In addition, interplanetary trajectory designs have resulted in 
increased delivered mass capability. Several design changes can be considered within the increased mass capability. 
For example, an increased vehicle scale may reduce acrohcating rates and loads and the corresponding surface re- 
cession and TPS thickness required. 

Additional trades that can be completed include a further assessment of chemical vs. SEP cruise: additional sys- 
tems analysis considering angle of attack modulation: revisiting the L/D=.6 vehicle; consideration of a symmetric 
version of the flattened cllipsled i.e. an elliptic upper section, in addition to elliptic lower and section: utilization of 
the TPS as a structural element: and consideration of variable thickness TPS for TPS mass reduc-

R. W. Bailey. J. L Hall. T. R. Spilkcr. N. O'Kongo

A detailed Neptune aerocapture systems analysis and spacecraft design study was 
performed as part of NASA's In-Space Propulsion Program. The primary objective mi to 
assess the feasibility of a spacecraft point design for a Ncplune/rriton science mission that 
use& aerocapture as the Neptune orbit insertion mechanism. Id.- paper provides an 
overview of the science, mission and spacecraft design resulting from that study. The 
estimated delivered wet mass allocation to Neptune orhit was -928 kg. The aerocapture 
entry system, comprised of aeroshell and post-aerocaplure orbit correction propellant, was 
-1252 kg. for a total atmospheric entry mass allocation of -2239 kg. The aeroshell used was a 
2.88 in long flattened ellipsled with a lift to drag ratio of 0.8. A Delta-IV Heavy launch 
vehicle combined with a JOkW solar electric propulsion iSKPl stage and a Venus/Jupiter 
gravity assist were used to get the spacecraft to Neptune in 10.25 years. The SEP stage and 
Drhitcr both have 55% dry mass margins ((allocation - CBK k/allocation l and the overall 
launch slack has an additional -S' i unallocated reserve. The feasibility of the mission 
requires the solution of two key technical challenges: improvement in aerothermodynamic 
computational tools for Neptune; and development of thermal protection material 
manufacturing processes for the increased thickness needed for aerocapture. Several other 
component technologies were identified as being able to provide significant performance 
improvements including: radioiostopic power generation, solar cells and array structure, 
low mass/power science instruments, and small stowed volume/large aperture deployable 
Ka-lfand antennas.

INTRODUCTION 

Acrocapturc is being investigated as a means tor interplanetary orbit insertion by NASA's In Space Propulsion 
Program. A sysicms analysis and spacecraft point design study was performed in Fiscal Year 2003 based on a 
reference mission to Neptune. The purpose of this study was to quantity* the feasibility and performance of an 
acrocapturc system to insert a spacecraft into a scientifically useful orbit about Neptune that includes regular flybys 
of Neptune's moon Triton. This paper is one of eleven papers (Rcf I- 10) associated with this Neptune acrocapturc 
study: sec Rcf I for an overview of the entire Neptune acrocapturc study. The multi-center Neptune Acrocapturc 
team is largely the same learn that performed a similar mission study for a Titan Acrocapturc in 2002 ' . 

Of the twelve study papers, this paper discusses the science objectives and the resulting spacecralt configuration. 
Disciplines addressed in the other papers (Rcf 2-10) include: trajectory design*, deep space navigation . Neptune 
atmospheric models', aerodynamics and stability analysis', acrocapturc guidance" and performance analysis . 
Neptune radiative and convcctivc heating environments'. TPS '. and structural design 1 analysis ' . 

SCIENCE 

Science objectives for a Neptune .'Triton mission were selected to yield a payload that representatively stressed 
spacecraft accommodation issues. The payload used for the study docs not constitute a fully vetted recommendation 
for a Neptune Triton mission, but instead represents a typical range of requirements such a mission might expect. 

SCIENCE OBJECTIVES & MEASUREMENTS 

Science objectives were composed from various sources including: 

• 2002 Solar System Exploration Decadal Survey 

• Science community White Papers that contributed to the SSEDS and Individual scientists that were on 
the SSEDS Panels 

• NASA SSE and SEC Roadmaps. 2003 

The science objectives used for this study were (listed in no particular order): 

1. Global imaging spectrometry of Neptune. Triton, other satellites, and the rings, at UV, visible, and IR 
wavelengths: repeated as needed for time variability 

2. Global microwave radiomciry at Neptune to infer temperature and pressure as a function of altitude 

3. Measure the low-order gravity fields of Neptune satellites: at Triton, measure higher-order harmonics to 
infer gross interior structure 

4. Measure Neptune's magnetic field at low altitudes, with sufficient accuracy and spatial and temporal 
coverage to map its generation region and determine its temporal variability 

5. Measure abundances of key atmospheric constituents as a function of depth (Neptune) 

6. Measure atmospheric temperature and pressure as a function of depth (Neptune) 

7. Measure winds as a function of depth f Neptune) 

8. Microwave radiomctry to infer temperature and pressure as a function of depth (Neptune) 

9. Measure the energetic charged particle environment 

10. Measure the plasma wave environment 



SCIENCE INSTRUMENTS 

Tabic I presents I) ihc instrument suite selected to achieve the science objectives, and 2) the spacecraft 
accommodation considerations for the instruments. The mass and power lor many of these instruments would be 
considered aggressive for a mission in formulation today. Instrument development would be required to achieve the 
payload capability for the total masspowcr allocation presented.

MISSION OVERVIEW 

Certain aspects of the mission were assumed as ground rules. Other aspects of the mission were open to system 
trades and 'or inherited from other outer planet mission studies performed at JPL. 

GROUND RULES 

Several ground rules and assumptions were set to bound the study. These items were not subject to any system 
trades analysis. 

• The TRL 6 cutoff date shall be no later than 2010. 

• The Neptune atmospheric probe will be a "black box" with a 124 kg launch mass allocation (each). 

• The orbitcr shall perform an acrocapturc for Neptune orbit insertion. 

• The Earth to Neptune propulsion system shall be SEP. 

• The orbitcr shall accommodate the instruments in Table I for their intended science purpose. 

EARTH TO NEPTUNE TRAJECTORY 

The Earth to Neptune SEP trajectory selected for this study, shown in Figure I. was the result of an extensive 
analysis of Chemical / SEP cruise and chemical acrocapture Neptune insertion options (Rcf 2). This trajectory 
provides a Neptune atmospheric entry velocity of 29 km's-

The probes arc released 90 minutes apart to allow die first probe to reach its end of mission before the second 
probe enters the atmosphere. 

The Neptune approach trajectory and subsequent acrocapturc flight is retrograde to Neptune (157 deg 
inclination) to mutch Triton's orbit plane and motion. The primary deceleration pulse of acrocapturc lasts less than 
10 minutes, during which the Orbiter is modulating its trajectory with bank angle using bi-propcllant thrustcTH. The 
acroshcll Is jettisoned soon alter atmospheric exit to limit thermal soak back from the hcatshicld to the orbiter. The 
orbiter dicn performs a TCM at the first post-acrocapturc apoapsis (-430000km) to raise the pcriapsis. out of the 
atmosphere and up to the desired science altitude (-4000 km). The final desired science orbit is 4000x488000km 
altitude w 157 deg inclination (Triton's orbit is -circular at 330000km altitude). The science orbit provides a Triton 
flyby every 3 orbits i~l 1.75 days). 

MISSION SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 

The Neptune Orbiter Flight System was the primary focus of this study: Ground Data and Mission Operations 
Systems were out of scope of this study. The launch configuration is shown in Figure 2. The stack fits easily inside 
the Delta IV fairing and looks slightly off-center geometrically because of the center of mass alignment within the 
acroshcll for proper acroshcll angle of attack and stability. The launch system mass summary* is shown in Table 2. 
The SEP cruise. post-SEP cruise, and probe communications relay configurations arc shown in Figures 3-5 
respectively.

KEY MISSION SYSTEM TRADES 

Several trades associated with how the orbiter interacts with the rest of mission system are worth mentioning. 
These trades do not represent a complete trade space lor the Neptune mission. 

1. Number of Probes and Pnil>e Delivery 

The Probes could be delivered before or after acrocapture. The volume constraints of the acroshcll led to the 
probes being carried outside the acroshcll. thus delivery' prior to acrocapture. Three probes were desired at the start 
of the study. Although three probes could probably be accommodated on the launch vehicle, the relay telecom 
solution could not converge because the first probe would be too tar away to provide a meaningful data rate. Three 
probes at one hour each versus two probes at I.S hours each could be a reasonable solution, but the probes would 
require higher ballistic coefficients which could complicate packaging. 

2. Probe Lifetime 

Because the probes arc released prior to acrocapture. and the orbiter reaches Neptune with a speed of 29 km s. 
probe lifetime equates directly to tclccomm relay distance for the probe. 90 minutes was selected, along with the 
largest non-deploy able L-Band antenna configuration, to achieve relay for two probes relayed in sequence. 

3. Neptune/Triton Science Orbit 

The desire to insert into an orbit that resonates with Triton's led to an acrocapture exit apoapsis that was so high 
(488.000 km) that the margin between acrocapture to that apoapsis and escape from the Neptune gravity well was 
too close to the performance capability of the acrocapture system. To achieve a comfortable acrocapture 
performance margin, the acrocapture exit apoapsis altitude was lowered to 430.000 km and propcllant was added to 
the orbiter to allow the orbilcr to raise the apoapsis to the desired science orbit. 



SEP STAGE DESIGN 

The SEP stage is designed to provide mission functionality from launch through Probe 2 EOL. The SEP stage 
relics on the orbiter for its flight computer and attitude control (reaction wheels). Structural mass was paramctrically 
scaled against the orbilcr acroshcll mass (payload). Xenon mass, and other primary components. The SEP stage dry 
mass summary is shown in Table 3. 

The "Fit" column of Tabic 3 specifics the number of 
line items in the detailed mass list for the respective 
subsystem. Articulation and An Control includes 
gimbals and actuators for SEP thrustcrs. cameras, and 
antennas. Attitude control for the system is provided by 
the reaction wheels in the orbiter. The hydrazine 
propulsion system provides TCM capability and 
momentum dc-saturation. For Tclccomm. pre- 
acrocapture antennas and L-Band Probe relay radios are 
included: all X'Ka band radio equipment resides in the 
orbiter. The Power system is mostly solar arrays. For 
Thermal, all the SEP PPU radiators have louvers.

The Orbilcr Flight System (OFS) is a single fault tolerant system, except for structure, dual stage RT( is. and 
antennas, with dual string block redundant avionics and selective cross strapping. The OFS is a 3-axis stabilized 
spacecraft. The OFS has two primary configurations: acrocapture and orbital science. Figures 6. 7 and 8 illustrate 
the different configurations. Although all mechanism mass was include in the mass lists. Figures 6. 7. and 8 do not 
include some mechanism detail such as the HGA two axis gimbal assembly and the instrument platform two axis 
gimbal assembly. Table 4 summarizes the acrocapture system mass, defined for this paper to include the acroshcll 
structure. TPS. and propcllani required for hank angle control and post acrocapture orbit adjust to reach the initial

adjust maneuvers nost-acrocapturc to achieve the desired science orbit of (altitude) 4.000 x 488,000 km. Twenty- 
four MA SCAT Bi-Prop engines arc used to provide up to 7.5 deg'sec 2 acceleration for bank angle control. The bi- 
prop engines arc positioned and balanced to provide spacecraft torques about the velocity vector (40 deg angle of 
attack) even with one jet failed.

AE/tOSHELL SHAPE AND SIZE 

A discussion of the various acroshcll shapes and sizes analyzed lite litis study is extensive out of scope for tills 
paper, but are discussed in detail in Rcf 5. The desired acroshcll I.D. ballistic coefficient, and stability effect shape, 
sue, and center of mass placement for die acroshcll; all of which affect volumetric and mass packaging efficiency of 
the internal components. For litis study, a 0.8 L D flattened ellipslcd was selected. 

AlUiough the llattcncd ellipslcd has ihc best volumetric efficiency (volume/surface area), ihc center of mass 
(CM) consirainls associated with ihc desired angle of ailack (40 dcg. lends to wani CM close to mid point between 
nose and tail) and stability (lends 10 want CM to be lower Uian the widest part of acroshcll) yield a large volume in 
ihc upper back region of ihc acroshcll lhat cannot be effectively utilized because of the need to offset any mass ai the 
back of ihc acroshcll with mass In ihc nose. Although ihc 0.8 LD flattened ellipslcd works for ihis study, there may 
be opportunity to reduce overall vehicle mass by using some of ihc other alternative shapes examined. 



24 



PROBE RELAY 

The communications frequency (L-Band chosen), probe lifetime (loial venical descent as function of ballistic 
coefficient), and probe latitude >' longitude placement (concurrent vs separate relay, antenna pointing error) all drive 
the relay antcnna(s) design. The current L-Band design is a compromise between UHF (good visibility through 
atmosphere, but antenna too large) and X-Band (terrible visibility through atmosphere, but reasonable antenna size). 
Because the probes are not tracked after release, the communications link has to accommodate the expected pointing 
error over the duration of the probe lifetime I* 1 - 3 dcg). 

Deploy able UHF or L-Band antennas could be used to increase useable surface area on the SEP stage and overall 
data capability. 

ORBITER STRUCTURE 

The primary structure of the orbitcr had to accommodate launch modes and stresses, acrocapture stresses, and 
mechanical constraints associated with separating from the LV, the SEP stage, and aeroshell. It is possible that a 
scries of smaller decks oriented in the horizontal plane with respect to the bunch configuration might provide a 
better foundation for efficient spacccrall packaging. 

SUBSYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS 

Orbitcr subsystems will be discussed in order of overall system impact. In general, subsystems discussed first 
drive the system design more than those discussed last 

AEROCAPTURE SYSTEM 

The acrocapture system is defined as the TPS. the underlying aeroshell structure, and the propellant required to 
achieve the desired science orbit. The acrocapture system structure. TPS and their associated aero-thermal design 
basis arc described in more detail in Ref 8-10. In summary, the acrothcrmal. aerodynamic, guidance, control 
analysis, and structural mass converged on a 2.88m flattened ellipslcd with a III of 0.8. 

The TPS was separated into 4 constant thickness zones to save mass: nose, windward side, forward Iceside. and 
aft Iceside (which includes the baseplate). For aeroshell jettison after acrocapture. the nose and windward zones 
were considered a single unit. The base plate would be jettisoned first, and the Iceside and windward sides would be 
jettisoned concurrently. 

24 bi-prop engines were used tor bank angle control. This large number of engines allows discrete levels of 
torque to provide a range of small impulse corrections to large accelerations (7.S dcg/scc2). The engine 
configuration also provides redundancy for one engine out capability. These engines remain with the Orbitcr alter 
the aeroshell is jettisoned to eliminate the need for a separate acrocapture propulsion system 

Approximately 161 kg of propellant is required for bank angle control during acrocapture. pcriapsis raise 
maneuver at the lirsl apoapsis after acrocapture. and an apoapsis raise maneuver to place the orbitcr in an orbit 
properly phased for a Triton flyby resonance. 

TELECOM 

The Orbitcr telecom system includes X. Ka. and L-Band components. The L-Band components arc required for 
atmospheric probe relay: L-Band is capable of penetrating Neptune's atmosphere at the desired science altitudes. 
The X and Ka bands arc used for Earth Communication. X for safe mode and Ka for science data return. Table 7 
summarizes the driving data return links. The L-Band antenna is approximately 1 .6 m x 1 .6 m with a mass of about 
8 kg. This antenna is attached to the SEP stage with a single axis gimbal to point to the probes during probe entry. 

The Ka link uses a 35 YV TWTA in combination with a dcployablc 4.16m HOA (59.6 dB) and is capable of 
returning -270 Obits of data assuming 4 hours of comm. per day to a 70m DSN station. This provides ample margin 
to the 151 Obits of planned science data. X-Band link uses a 15 W SSPA with a small dish antenna (32.2 dB) to

provide Earth communication up to SEP stage separation. The L-Band probe relay link uses a 20W SSPA with a 
25. 1 dB antenna up to 524 Kbits total data return from the first probe and up to MS Kbits total from the second 
probe. 

POWER 

Two dual stage Mutli- Mission Radioisotopic Thermal Generator iMMRTCii units, generating 3000W thermal, 
were selected for the Oibitcr power source. The single stage MMRTG is planned for TRL 6 by 20O6. laboratory 
tests currently have the dual stage technology at TRL 2-3 and funding profiles plan TRL 6 by 2010. The expected 
pcrfonnancc of the dual stage MMRTG is approximately 14% efficiency with 1.5% degradation per year providing 
420W at beginning of life and 344W at end of life. 

Secondary batteries arc included to help during peak periods with a typical assortment of battery charge 
controllers, power switching, and power conversion electronics. 

ACS 

The Orbitcr is a 3-axis controlled spacecraft that uses reaction wheels for attitude pointing and hydrazine 
thrustcrs for attitude maneuvers and reaction wheel de-saturation. The primary optical instrument deck is on a two 
axis gimbal as is the deployed HGA. Sun sensors arc not utilized because of there no lime critical sun point 
requirement (MMRTG power source). Star trackers arc utilized in an orthogonal mount configuration to provide 
better attitude knowledge. Both the star trackers and the IMU have aggressive mass and powered consistent with 
low TRL units that arc funded for achieving TRL 6 in the next decade. The current configuration could easily handle 
the mass of conventional units. 

PROPULSION 

The propulsion system is dual mode bi-prop system with a rc-prcssurization system. Hydrazine thrustcrs arc used 
for short and infrequent pulse ACS duties: bi-prop engines arc used for longer duration impulses such as acrocapturc 
bank angle control and orbit adjust maneuvers. Thruster configurations arc designed to accommodate a single 
thruster failure by removing an entire thruster string from the system. 

C&DH 

The C&DH system is based on a RAD750. 3V Compact PCI implementation that is currently offered in various 
forms by multiple vendors. Although some of the cards required may not yet exist in 3U format, it is assumed that 
they will by time of mission implementation, or can be developed with little difficulty. 

THERMAL 

The mission design presents several challenges for the thermal design: 

1. The MMRTGs together generate -260OW of waste heat. 

2. The MMRTGs arc enclosed in an acroshcll designed to keep heal from gelling in (making il harder to get 
heat out). 

3. The radiator system has to be designed to work before, during, and alter acrocapturc 

4. Inside the acroshcll. the system will experience solar distance of 0.7 AU (Venus) to 31 AU. 

Titanium and water loop heat pipes (LHP) running to hot radiators mounted on ihc SEP stage were chosen to 
solve the problem of getting the heal out of the acroshcll. Aluminum and ammonia loop heal pipes were also added 
lo transport Orbitcr electronics heal out of ihc acroshcll. A second set of titanium >' water LHP carries MMRTG heat 
directly to ihc hydrazine tank. 

From the previous year's Titan acrocapturc study (Ref 12). a -30 node lumped mass model of a spacecraft in an 
acroshcll using these LHP concepts was constructed lo compute temperature distributions during the key mission 
phases for various design options. The computational model results confirmed that all of the key avionics and 
propulsion components were maintained well within prescribed operating temperatures during both the cruise to 
Satum and after orbit insertion when the acroshcll was jettisoned and the orbitcr exposed to ihc cold space 
environment at Titan. Although this analysis was not updated for die Neptune spacecraft, ihc results of die Titan 
study provide confidence that a similar design can do ihc job.

1 . L V frequencies and loads. 

2. Acrocapturc loads. 

3. Acroshcll separation planes. 

4. Desired acroshcll center of mass. 

NEW TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT 

Other than aerothcrmal analysis tools and TPS manufacturing techniques, there were no enabling technologies 
identified to implement the High) system. The In Space Propulsion Program is continuing funding to improve the 
aerothcrmal analysis tools. The dual stage MMRTGs. deployablc Ka band HGA. and dcployablc square rigger solar 
arrays arc strongly enhancing technologies, but these technologies are already independently funded for 
development and there arc other options to implement the mission if these technologies do not become a reality. 

RECOMMENDED ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS 

Many questions and trades consistent with continued Phase A'B efforts were identified by the study team. A 
summary of these issues is presented below along with a general classification of the issue as a lien, or opportunity, 
or cither. 

• Launch Vehicle There is so much unallocated margin on the Delta-lV Heavy that an Atlas V 551 could be 
feasible, especially if an Earth gravity assist is considered (opportunity). 

• Science Instruments: 1) Develop conceptual designs for instruments and verify TRL. mass, power, volume 
estimates (Lien). 2) Verify optical, and radiative fields of view for all instrument (especially thermal 
radiative for instrument on gimbalcd deck, and RF for microwave radiometer antennas). 

• Power: I) Develop detailed power modes and profiles (cither). 2) Verify 2 MMRTGs arc adequate for full 
mission (Lcin). 3) Verify EMI/EMC compatibility for component configuration (cither). 

• Thermal Verify MMRTG heat can be effectively routed to other spacecraft components to eliminate need 
for heaters (Lcin). 

• Telecom: I ) Add LGAMGA for Earth acquisition prior to high bandwidth links (Lien). 

• Acroshcll: I) Re- investigate best shape for volumetric efficiency including center of mass location 
(opportunity). 2) Verify heating and TPS for new ballistic coefficient (cither). 

• Cost: Generate cost estimate for complete (light system (lien). 

CONCLUSIONS 

The study demonstrates general technical feasibility for a Neptune Orbitcr flight system designed to use 
acrocapturc as the orbit insertion mechanism. Many liens exist against the conceptual design presented, but 
opportunities and large launch mass margins balance the liens. Technology readiness for the (light system is good 
with all major components currently being funded to achieve TRL 6 in the next decade.

A detailed Neptune aerocapture systems analysis and spacecraft design study was 
performed lo improve our understanding of the techonology requirement for such a hard 
mission. The primary objective was to engineer a point design based on blunt body acroshell 
technology and quantitatively assess feasibility and performance. This paper reviews the 

launch vehicle, propulsion, and trajectory options to reach Neptune in the 2015-2020 time 
frame using aerocapture and all-propulsive vehicles. It establishes the range of entry 
conditions that would be consistent with delivering a - 1900 kg total entry vehicle maximum 
expected mass to Neptune including a - 790 kg orbitcr maximum expected mass to the 
science orhit. Two Neptune probes would he also be delivered prior to the aerocapture 
maneuver. Results show that inerlial entry velocities in the range of 28 to 50 km/s are to be 
expected for chemical and solar electric propulsion options with several gravity assists 
(combinations of Venus, Karth and Jupiter gravity assists). Trip times range from 
approximately 10-11 years for aerocapture arbiters to 15 years for all -propulsive vehicles. 

This paper shows that the use of aerocapture enables this mission given the payload to 
deliver around Neptune compared to an all-propulsive orbit insertion approach. However, 
an all-propulshe chemical insertion option is possible for lower payload masses than the one 
needed for this science mission. Both approaches require a Delta IV heavy class launch 

vehicle. 



INTRODUCTION 

As part of the NASA In-Spacc Propulsion Program, aerocapture was investigated as an option for orbit insertion 
around Neptune. This study involved several NASA centers and had for objective to conceptually design an 
aerocapture system for a generic orbitcr with atmospheric probes mission. This paper provides an overview of the 
mission trades performed during this study. The main objectives of the mission trades were to: 

1) Identify potential mission architecture and trajectories for a launch circa 2015-2020. which meant to identify 

launch vehicle options, launch opportunities and sensitivities, and potential trajectories using chemical 
ballistic propulsion and solar electric propulsion (SEP): 

2) Understand the sensitivities in flight time and Neptune atmosphere's inertia! entry velocities: 

3) Provide a baseline trajectory. 

The level of analysis for the mission trades varied from relatively detailed, in the case of the aerocapture system 
and trajectory optimization, to more parametric in the ease of the chemical system design. The approach was to 
survey as much as possible the trajectory trade space, both for chemical with multiple gravity assists and for SEP 
with a wide range of flight times and various gravity assist options. Once the trajectories were compiled, the 
delivered mass at Neptune was calculated given the maximum performances of representative launch vehicles. This 
delivered mass was then compared to the actual mass needed for an aerocapture vehicle and for a chemical insertion 
vehicle, thus quantifying the benefits of aerocapture. 

This paper first summarizes the transportation architectures considered. It then describes the launch and transit 
options for ballistic chemical trajectories and SEP trajectories. These trajectories provide the range of inertia! entry 
velocities to expect. Both aerocapture and chemical insertion arc then discussed, including details about the systems 
and trajectories. Based on the systems and orbitcr designs. Earth-Neptune trajectories can be picked and traded 
against. This paper finally shows the overall architecture trade results. 

These trades do not represent all possible options for mission design or mission architecture, but they do span the 
range of likely options.

TRANSPORTATION ARCHITECTURES 

The science objectives and basic spacecraft concept for this Neptune mission were based on previous studies 
performed inicmally at the Jcl Propulsion Laboratory. The mission includes two Neptune atmospheric probes and a 
Ncpiunc Orbiter." The atmospheric probes were considered here as black boxes (207 kg maximum expected value 
total), and only the navigation aspects of carrying these probes were taken into account. The probes perform a 
direct entry a few hours before the Orbitcr's insertion. The desired science orbit around Neptune is a 4.000 x 
48R.O00 km altitude at 157 degree inclination to match Triton's orbit plane and motion (Triton's orbit is almost 
circular at 330.000 km radius from Ncpiunc). The science orbit provides a fly-by of Triton every 3 orbits (*■ 1 2 days). 

To understand the sensitivities in acrocapture entry conditions into Neptune's atmosphere and understand the 
benefits of acrocapture. it was necessary to perform a trade study of the various and most probable transportation 
options to Neptune in the 2015-20 launch time frame. The transportation architectures considered from Earth to the 
final science orbit were the following: 

1. Option 1A: Chemical ballistic transit trajectory to Neptune with a chemical insertion at Neptune. 

2. Option IB: Chemical ballistic transit trajectory to Neptune with acrocapture. 

3. Option 2A: SEP transit trajectory to Neptune with a chemical insertion at Neptune. 

4. Option 2B: SEP transit trajectory to Neptune with acrocapture. 

The Orbiter was designed to perform acrocapture and modilicd in the trades when a chemical insertion was 
performed instead. As will be discussed, the baseline concept uses SEP to reach Neptune. To make the comparison 
between acrocapture and chemical insertion easier, and as the orbiter was designed to accommodate the AV for 
apoapsis raise, the targeted apoapsis altitude for the chemical insertion was 430,000 km (consistent with the target 
acrocapture altitude). The acrocapture entry is assumed to start at 1000 km altitude (25,766 km radius). The 
acrocapture pass is retrograde to match Triton's orbit. The chemical insertion burn is assumed to be performed at 
4000 km altitude (28.766 km radius). 

All four combinations of transportation were evaluated and will be described. The technique of aerobraking was 
not included in this trade study because the need for a highly elliptical science orbit precludes the multi-pass orbit 
circulahzation strategy that makes aerobraking useful. The next two sections will describe the transit trajectories, 
followed by a description of the orbit insertions. 



EARTH TO NEPTUNE CHEMICAL BALLISTIC TRAJECTORIES 

Ballistic direct trajectories as well as gravity assist trajectories were computed tor a launch period between 2012 
and 2019. The gravity assists (OA) include several combinations of Venus (V). Earth (E). Jupiter (J) and Saturn (S) 
fly-bys. Figure I shows the launch C3 for each of the trajectories surveyed. This list of trajectories docs not 
represent all possible options of gravity assist nor launch date, and a more thorough survey should be done to 
complement this analysis. 

As can be seen in Figure t . the direct trajectories require a very high launch C3. which implies a relatively small 
launch mass. The Jupiter gravity assist (JOA) and Jupiter Saturn gravity assist also require a large launch C3 and 
thus offer poor performances. For all practical purposes, these trajectory options were deleted Irani the trade space. 

Note that some of gravity assist trajectories require a deep space maneuver, which AV can be significant. Figure 
2 shows the corresponding deep space maneuver AV required for each of the trajectories.

Although ilic Venus only gravity assists offer a low launch C3. ihc post launch -\V required for these options is 
quite high. The best performing options are ihe Venus or Eanh combined with a Jupiiet gravity assi-t. The launch 
date availability lor these is restrained to 2014 -201 6. The use of a Jupiter gravity assist requires proper positioning 
of the planets, which only happens every - 10 years for Jupiter. Again, gravity assist with different launch dates and 
lower post launch AV may exist with launch C3 close to or lower than the ones presented here. 

The maximum launch injected mass was derived from Figure I given the launch C3 for a Delta 4450. Alios 55 1 
and a Delta IV Heavy. These launch vehicles were picked as representative of a range of launch vehicle 
performance. The launch vehicle data was provided by the NASA KS( Launch Support Group'. Out of the mieetcd 
moss provided by the launch vehicle, one needs to subtract the moss of propcllant and chemical propulsion system 
needed In perform lite post-launch AV. To do that we assumed a chemical Isp of 325 see and a propulsion system 
dry moss equal to 20% of lite propcllant mass (approximately equivalent to a propulsion dry mass fraction of I n% of 
the chemical stage). Figure 3 then shows the net delivered mass (injected mass minus chemical propcllant and 
propulsion dry mass to perform the post-launch AVI at Neptune's arrival (not inserted into Neptune's orbit).

Figure 3 shows that the EJGAs have the best potential for delivering significant masses around Neptune. The 
VEFJSOA is unique and very dependent on launch date, but shows that there could be trajectories performing even 
better than ihe FJGAs for a longer flight time. 

The corresponding menial entry velocities at a 1000 km altitude arc provided in Figure 4. Willi both Figures 3

KARTH TO NEPTUNE SOLAR ELECTRIC PROPULSION TRAJECTORIES 

As for ihc chemical ballistic trajectories, an extensive database of gravity assists Solar Electric Propulsion ISEP) 
trajectories on various launch vehicles was built, as they clearly provided bctlcr delivered mass for equivalent (light 
times compared to direct (no gravity assist) SEP trajectories. These trajectories served the purpose of evaluating the 
sensitivities in launch date, number of thrusicrs, power levels and inertial entry velocities. 

The SEP low •thrust trajectory optimization were run with a code named SEPTOP for Solar Electric Pmpulsion 
Trajectory Optimization Program, which is based on the calculus of variations. This code optimizes two body 
interplanetary trajectories and can model discrete numbers of operating Xenon thrusters throughout the trajectory. The 
trajectories allowed for u coast time duty cycle of 5% to simulate times when the spacecraft is not thrusting due to 
housekeeping activities, and assumed a constant 250 W from the solar arrays for the spacecraft A 10% launch vehicle 
margin was assumed. 



-SOLAR ELECTRIC PROPULSION SYSTEM ASSUMPTIONS 

The ion thrustcr used to calculate the SEP trajectories is the NEXT engine. The characteristics of the NEXT 
engine technology can be found in many references."' Table I shows the projected performances of the NEXT 
engine. The high-Isp profile of the engine was used to calculate the trajectories. 

The ion propulsion system UPS) was designed more as a propulsion module than just thrusters and power 
processing units. Figure 5 shows a simplified block diagram of a typical single suing ion propulsion system (IPS). 
To that basic configuration was added redundancy, structural and thermal considerations. Figure 5 also shows an 
example of what the IPS module designed here could look like. 

The number of thrusters and PPUs was calculated on the basis of power requirements and thrustcr propellant 
throughput. The system architecture followed a conventional approach with parallel strings of PPUs and thrusters. 
Each PPU drives one thrustcr but is cross-strapped to two engines. One spare ion engine, one spare PPU and DCTL" 



33 



were also included for single-fault utterance. Each ihrusicr «j» gimbalcd separately. The PPUs were assumed In be 
95% efficient. 

The solar arrays were sized based on a projection of the AEC-Ablc Square Rigger array capability. Since this 
array technology scales with power from - I kW up to - 30 kW. it was used us a representative potential technology 
for SEP applications. The specific mass was assumed 10 be I'll W'kg. A 14% degradation factor was applied (o the 
array Bcginning-of-Lifc (BOL) power to account for various degradation phenomena. Also, in order lo support 
power demand during launch, a primary battery was used prinr to snlar array deployment. 

The tank mass fraction was assumed lo be 2.5°< for Xenon when stored as a supercritical gas (-2000 psial 
Funhcmiorc, a 10% propcllant contingency was added lo ihc deterministic propcllant mass to account for now rale 
charactcri nation, residuals, attitude control and margin. 

Since die system masses are function of mainly power level, launch mass and propcllant mass, each trajcclory was 
uniquely considered and liad a system mass associated widi it The component and subsystem sizing assumptions are 
given in Table 2. To be consistent widi the JPL Team X conceptual design guidelines at die lime of the study. 30% 
mass contingency was applied to all spacecraft subsystems. These masses represent the Maximum Expected Value 
mass (MEVJ. 

For the purpose of the trade studies, the mass model of Table 2 was used. However, the final baseline design and 
the final table comparing all options (section VII) included a bctlcr definition of die system. This system was about 
35 kg heavier dian the model used here. Most of the difference resides in a larger thermal and structural mass.

SEP TRAJECTORY PERFORMANCES AND INERTIAL ENTRY VELOCITY CHARACTERIZATION 

As previously mentioned, the SEP trajectories considered use one to several gravity assist, because the mass 
needed for the orbitcr and orbiter insertion system was beyond what a direct SEP trajectory could provide. With the 
appropriate thrustcr model, trajectories were run for several power levels, launch vehicle types and launch years. 
Results are in terms of net delivered mass. The net delivered mass is defined as the spacecraft mass minus the dry 
moss of the ion propulsion system and minus the propcllani mass used for the SEP transfer. Therefore the net 
delivered mass is everything on the spacecraft thai isn't SEP propcllani or part of the ion propulsion module. Each 
trajectories were optimized for maximum delivered dry mass at destination (the launch C3 and thrusting profile were 
optimized). The gravity assist opportunities were also optimized for a given launch year. Figure 6 shows results of 
net delivered mass us u function of flight time to Neptune (arrival at Neptune's vicinity, not the final science orbit

As can be seen in Figure 6. ihc net delivered hum is a strung lunci ion nf launch year, gravity assist combination 
and power level- However, It Is believed thai the cases shown here are quite representative of the range of 
performance that can be expected from an SEP system. Not all of the trajectories run arc shown in this figure as 
some provided performances bcluw 1900 kg. and thus were judged insufficient. 

Figure 7, X and 9 show the corresponding launch C3, radius of Jupiter Ily-by and incrtial entry velocities at 10011 
km altitude at Neptune, respectively. The radius of the Jupiter fly-by was unconstrained and thus optimized in this 
study. For the VJGAs and EJGAs of particular interest, the Ily-by occurs typically between the nrbits of lo and 
Europa, so significant radiation can be expected. 

As Figure 9 show s. the incrtial entry velocity increases is very dependent on llight time, launch date, and gravity 
assist However, the incrtial entry velocity is only weakly dependent on SEP power for a given launch dale and 
thrust ii technology- Thus choosing a llight lime range will determine a range of incrtial entry velocities. Flight limes 
between 10 to 12 years offer the most "net delivered mass" benefit and result in entry velocities less than 30 km s 
for most launch opportunities. 

The weak sensitrvity lo the SEP pnwer level in Incrtial entry velocity Is mostly due to the fact thai aver the range 
of power looked at, the trajectory optimization code is trying to fallow the same optimum acceleration path. Thus 
for high power level. It will optimize Ihc trajectory at lower launch C3. thus injecting more mass. The acceleration, 
which is proportional lo the power level to mass ratio will be roughly the same as a low power, large C3, low launch 
mass ease. Since it will follow almost the same trajectory profile, the arrival hyperbolic velocity will only vary 
slightly. This is ibe ease for a fixed flight lime and launch date. 

The launch window to perform a given gravity assist is about one month. The sensitivity In propcllant moss for 
that window Is included in the 10% propcllant margin.

SELECTION OF THK INKRTIAL ENTRY VELOCITY 

The selection of Ihc chemical ballisiic or SEP trajectory Earth to Neptune transit trajectory depends mostly on 
the performance (net delivered mass) provided by the trajectory and is an iterative process since the mass desired at 
Neptune's arrival depends on the design of the acrocapturc system. In both chemical ballisiic and SEP cases, an 
entry velocity of 29 km's represents the best compromise between short flight limes and high net delivered masses. 
Although somewhat arbitrary, it was felt that the acrocapturc design would not change significantly for inertia! entry 
velocities between 2H and 30, km/s. 



BASELINE TRAJECTORY 

The baseline trajectory for the design of the acroshcll and other components of the acrocapturc system was 
selected based on the following criteria: 

1. The mission architecture should use the smallest launch vehicle possible to reduce cost; 

2. The trajectory performance should provide adequate system mass margin (30%) for maximum expected 
mass, and adequate system reserves <> 10%); 

3. The trajectory should provide a Neptune inertia) entry velocity close to 29 km's. 

At the time of selection, the SEP trajectories were providing better performance than chemical ballistic option. It 
was also felt that a Venus Jupiter gravity assist would be sufficient performance wise. Thus the trajectory selected 
featured (sec Figure 10):

AEROCAPTURE SYSTEM AND NEPTUNE ORBITER DESCRIPTION 

The acrocapturc system and the orbitcr arc described in detail in reference |2] and 1 7|. The)* have been designed 
for ihc baseline trajectory, which was chosen lo match on inertia! entry velocity of 2° km's. The acrocapturc system 
and the acroshcll shape were subject to an intensive trade related to the acrothcrmal and aerodynamic properties, 
control authority issues and volumetric efficiency. The design converged on a 2.88 m ellipsled with a LD of 0.8. 
Figures 1 1 and 1 2 show the SEP cruise configuration and the post-SEP and acrocapturc configuration respectively. 

The thermal protection system was optimized lo reduce mass. Thcacroshcll is jettisoned after acrocapturc. and a 
dual mode bi-propellani system Has used to raise the poriapsis. A A V of 438 m's was used to size the propcllani tank 
and loading. This AV includes the maneuvers to be performed during the acrocapturc pass, a pcriapsis raise 
maneuver at fust apoapsis and and apoapsis raise maneuver lo place die orbiter in phase for Triton lly-bys. 

Table 3 summarizes the mass breakdown for the acrocapturc system As can be seen, the total dry mass of the 
acroshcll system is It 19 kg (maximum expected mass) for a total entry maximum expected dry mass of 191 1 kg l~ 
58.6% aciiicapturc system entry dry mass traction). Other acrocapturc-tclatcd hardware was ejected before enlry. 
This hardware is also summarized in Table 3.

CHEMICAL SYSTEM AND INSERTION (OPTIONS IA AND 2A| 



SELECTION OF THE TRANSIT TRAJECTORY AND CHEMICAL INSERTION 

The selection of the chemical ballistic or SEP trajectory Earth to Neptune transit trajectory depends on the 
performance (net delivered mass) pmvided by the trajectory but also very strongly on the Neptune Orbit Insertion 
(NOI) bum. Unlike acrocapturc, the chemical insertion will be very dependent on Uic arrival velocity i Vinlimiv i 
For the chemical ballistic transfer trajectories, a balance between the post-launch AV and the NOI AV needs to be 
taken into account to minimize the sum of both AVs. 

Given the chemical ballistic gravity assist trajectories provided in Figures I and 2 and their arrival velocity at 
Neptune, one can calculate the NOI AV at 4000 km altitude. Figure 13 provides such AV. A similar plot could be 
done fur the SEP transit trajectories.

Since die NOI AV arc large | which motivates ihc development of acrocapturc). we assumed a dedicated 
chemical stage for that maneuver. In the case of chemical transit trajectories, we combined both AVs in a single 
stage (might provide conservative results). 



CHEMICAL PROPCLSION SYSTEM 



To perform the chemical deep space maneuvers or insertion bums, a generic bi-propcllant s>stcm was assumed, 
staged as necessary to accommodate for the large AVs. The dry mass for this system is summarized in Table 4. The 
specific impulse of the chemical system was assumed at 325 sec. In addition. 5% of die deterministic propellant 
mass was held as propellant contingency for maneuver clean-ups. Some of the structural mass depends on die dry 
mass at the beginning of the AV phase I Mil

Given dicsc assumptions, die net delivered mass in a 4000 x 430,000 km altitude science orhit cuuld be 
calculated. Figure 14 shows the net delivered mass Tor the various chemical ballistic trajectories. This figure 
represents option I A, an all chemical propulsion to the science orbit. The "best" ease for an all propulsive option is a 
Venus- Earth- Jupiter gravity assist that can deliver around 500 kg in 1 5 years. The Earth-Jupiter gravity assists may 
offer better performances but no data was generated dial would confirm the slope for longer llighl times.

CONCLUSIONS 

This paper summarizes the transit trajectory options for a Ncpluno ntbilcr mission and der ives iho range of cnuy 
conditions liir iho aerocapture maneuver Inside Neptune's atmosphere. This survey shows that inenial entry 
velocities in ihe range of 28 -30knvsare lobe expected. This range offers the best combinaiion of highest delivered 
mass to Neptune's orbit and lowest entry heating. The study chose lo baseline an menial entry velocity of 29 km s 
for the detailed design of the aerocapture system, and the corresponding SEP trajectory is provided. 

This paper also summarizes the mission transportation trades performed during the study to show the benefits of 
aerocapture. The study shows that aerocapture as an orbit insertion option provides more delivered mass in every 
launch vclUelc and gravity assist case looked at than chemical insertion, and shorter flight time (typically by 4-5 
years). However, all chemical or SEP with chemical insertion cases exist that would deliver about 450 kg in 
Neptune's orbit with a Delta IV Heavy with flight times around 1 5 years. The baseline trajectory case for this study 
is an SEP aerocapture case on a Delta IV heavy wnli a (light lime of 10.2 years delivering a 790 kg nrbitcr.

A mull i-iink i NASA learn conducted a systems analysis study of a Neptune aerocapturc 
orbiter mission in order to demonstrate feasibility and identity technology gaps. The 
aerncapture maneuver utilizes aerodynamic drag to decelerate the vehicle, rather than 
chemical propulsion, for orbit insertion around Neptune and allows a fly by of the Triton 
moon. This paper presents the analysis used to select an orhiter shape, and the aerodynamics 
and stability characteristics of the reference vehicle. Several shape classes » ere screened for 
aerodynamic performance using modified Newtonian theory. A lift-to-drag ratio 
requirement of 0.6 to 0.8 was derived from an estimate of the theoretical corridor width to 
give margin beyond 3- a dispersions. A flat-bottomed ellipsled was selected as the reference 
orbiter shape based on variant metrics, including lift-to-drag ratio. halUslic coefficient, and 
effective volume. High-fidelity computational solutions for the reference orbiter shape 
predict a lift-to-drag ratio of 0,806 and ballistic coefficient of 895 kg/m* at a trim angle-of- 
attack of 40 deg. Stable pitch behavior is predicted with a 6.2^< static margin for an axial 
center of gravity at 51^* of the vehicle length from the nose. Both the longitudinal short- 
period and lateral Dutch-roll frequencies arc shown to he within acceptable limits based on 
piloted vehicle specifications. Aerodynamics uncertainties were estimated to result in a lift- 
to-drag ratio uncertainly of +l5.4Ttf-US r i using KSS values and +26A"i/-22.2% using 
stacked « orst-ca.se values.

INTRODUCTION 

multi-center NASA team conducted a systems analysis study of a Neptune acrocaplurc orbitcr mission 1 '* under 
ifunding from the In-Spacc Propulsion program. The study was conducted to demonstrate ihc benefits and 
feasibility of acrocaplurc, and identify technology gaps and requirements that must be addressed. Detailed analyses 
were performed in the areas of mission design, configuration, aerodynamics, propulsion, mass properties, structural 
dynamics, acrothcrmodynamics. thermal protection, atmospheric modeling, trajectory simulations, guidance, and 
navigation. This paper covers the trade study that resulted in the reference orbitcr shape, as well as the static 
aerodynamics and a preliminary stability analysis of the vehicle. 

Figure I shows the reference orbitcr in its acrocaplurc configuration. The orbitcr is designed to release two 
probes before atmospheric entry. The science orbit is designed to observe both Neptune and a nearby moon. Triton. 
An elliptical orbit with an apoapsis of 430.000 km was selected to achieve the science goals. Aerocapiure is 
proposed as an alternative to chemical propulsion to insert the aeroshcll into an elliptical orbit around Neptune. 
Acrocaplurc is a maneuver performed at the target planet in which the vehicle enters the atmosphere in order to 
remove kinetic energy via aerodynamic drag. The maneuver must be performed so thai the vehicle reaches deep 
enough into the atmosphere to remove sufficient energy to allow capture and shallow enough lo avoid hitting the 
planet. A small amount of chemical propulsion is needed to raise the pcriapsis and place the spacecraft into the final 
science orbit. Figure 2 shows a schematic of acrocaplurc at Neptune with a science orbit that intercepts Triton's 
orbit.

uncertainty estimates lor navigated entry 
slates. atmospheric density. and 
aerodynamics showed Uuil an L/D of 0.6 
is just sufficient to capture the i-a entry 
corridor'. In order lo have margin above 
3-<r, an L/D of 0.8 was selected as the 
baseline requirement. The current analysis 
presents arbiter shapes with L/D = 0.6 - 
0.8.

SELECTION 

A L/D between 0.6 and OK requires 
vehicle shape dial Is more slender than 

typical 70tleg sphere-cone planetary entry vehicles, which give a maximum practical L/D near 0.25. The urhltcr 
shone affects several other aspects of the mission, including aerodynamics, acmheating, structures, packaging, mass 
properties, and thermal protection. Thus, considerable time was speni on an arbiter shape trade study before 
additional system analyses were performed. The shape trade study was undertaken in order to rapidly assess the 
performance capabilities of candidate mid-UD shapes. The shapes were defined paramctrically and aerodynamic 
performance was screened using modified Nnciontau Theory, which is known to give reasonable predictions for 
blunt shapes at hypersonic speeds. In this fashion, many shapes were defined and analysed in a short amount of 
time. 



The goals of the shape study were to: 

I. Achieve M> = 0.6 - 0.8 

2 Minimize ballistic coefficient, ft. 

3. Maximize effective volume 1 '. V,„

surface area for a given volume, which can help reduce the ueroshcll structure and thermal protection system iTPSi

Goal I lends u> produce shapes that are long and slender, 
whereas guals 2 and 3 favor shorter, more compact shapes. Thus, a 
balance between ihcsc opposing characteristics is desired for the 
Neptune orbitcr. 

The candidate shape classes, examples of which arc shown in 
Figure 3, were screened for the desired metrics. Variations on all 
dupes were performed paramcincally. Sphere times have simple 
geometries and provide the UD necessary' for Neptune acrocapture. 
Biwnits have previously been studied lor acrocapture at Neptune 
and Mars, and have been shown to give good performance 
Etlipileds lhal have been considered for a Mars lander application . 
Bent biconics and modified cllipslcds were studied in order lo 
increase Wui O.K. 

Comparisons between the various shapes were performed for a 
fixed volume and mass. The allocated system entry mass was 
specified to be 2200 kg . The shapes were screened using the 
following process: 

1. Fix die acroshcll mass and volume 

2. Vary ihc gcomcinc parameters depending on the shape class: 
a. Sphere-cone - total length, nose radius and cone angle 
It Ellipslcd - total length, nose length, and diameter 

c. Biconic - vary parameters manually 

4. Calculate the aerodynamic coctlicicnls using modified 
New Ionian Theory for a = 40 - fiO deg 

5. Identify shapes with the best combination of UD. /'„. and l'„, 

6. Estimate shape clfccts on acrohcating. structures, packaging, etc

<L//J-0.6-».K> 



Qualitative considerations were token into account during the shape selection process. A small nose radius is 
undesirable from an acrohcating and packaging standpoint. A long slender shape is also not desirable because 
additional structural mass is needed to give sufficient stiffness for launch loads. Engineering judgment was used to 
account for these cfTects before additional high- fidelity analyses were performed. 

MODIFIED NEWTONIAN THEORY 

Modified Newtonian Theory was used in order to rapidly screen aerodynamic performance of the candidate 
orbitcr shapes with reasonable accuracy. The theory produces good aerodynamics data for bodies at hypersonic 
speeds and is simple lo implement. The theory expresses pressure coefficient lO as a function of the angle between 
the local surface normal and the frcestream velocity vector {(?):

neglected, but they arc small at hypersonic speeds. Given a discrete mesh of the surface distribution, aerodynamic 
coefficients can be cslunatcd in a matter of seconds using a personal computer. 

VKKOCAPTliRE DESIGN TRAJECTORY 

Alter selection of the reference orbitcr shape, lugh-fidclity computational lluid dynamics (C'FD) solutions were 
used to predict detailed aerodynamic characteristics. Frcestream conditions (density, velocity, and icmpcrulurel were 
needed from a design trajectory in order to run these solutions. For the current study, the minimum dentin 
aimiisphere. Hfi-up trajectory with //„ = 400 kg/in' was selected for CFD analysis (Figure 4). The trajectory was 
calculated for an incnial entry velocity of29 hn/s and was obtained using the steepest entry flight path angle and the 
lowest atmospheric density expected based on the NcpiuneORAM model'. These conditions result in the highest 
convectivc heating rates experienced by the orbitcr. Table I shows ihc frcestream conditions used for the CFD 
solution!.

STATIC AERODYNAMICS 

High-fidelity aerodynamics tl.ua were Deeded fu 
ihc Mimic -Carlo trajectory analysis and far a 
preliminary stabilily assessment of die reference 
orblicr. Viscous CFD solutions were obtained using 
ihc Lang-Icy Acroihcrmodynantic Upwind Relaxation 
Algorithm (LAURAl". LAURA was developed at 
NASA Langlcy Research Center and has been used 
previously to predict the aerodynamic characteristics 
Tor various planetary" and space transportation 
vehicles. The code uses a finite-volume approach to 
solve the viscous Navicr-Slokcs flowTield equations. A 
3-spccics dissociating Neptune atmosphere model (II;, 
H. He) was used to capture die high-temperature 
effects on hypersonic aerodynamics. The frccsircam 
composition was specified to be 68.2% II: and 31.8% 
He by mass. The entire aerocapturc pass is hypersonic, 
su CFD solutions for a range of a at a high Mach 
number is considered suflieicnt for the current study. 
LAURA solutions at zero yaw angle were used in the 
longitudinal stability analysis. 

Additional solutions at /' = 0. 2. and 5 deg were run 
with the FELISA 1 " CFD code for the lateral stability 
analysis. The FELISA software is a set of computer 
codes for the generation of unstructured grids around 
arbitrary bodies, simulation of three-dimensional 
steady inviscid flows, and post-processing of the 
results. The software has been extensively used for 
aerodynamic studies of the X-43. Mors landers, and 
similar configurations . An equilibrium Neptune 
atmospheric gas was used In the present computations.

STABILITY ANALYSIS 

The aerodynamic data for the Neptune orbiter were used in a simplified vehicle stability analysis. The analysis 
involved static stability, which determines whether a vehicle con tly in u trimmed equilibrium condition, and 
dynamic stability, which evaluates how a vehicle responds to aerodynamic disturbances. LAURA viscous data were 
used for the longitudinal static and dynamic stability analyses, and FELISA inviscid solutions at non-zero yaw were 
used for the lateral dynamic stability assessment. 

The estimate of static longitudinal stability* is determined by the pitching moment coefficient i (',.> about the 
vehicle's center of gravity |CG). If C„ for a particular High) condition (ir and Mach number) is zero and its 
derivative with respect to ct is negative it", < 0). then the vehicle tends to trim at that o when flying at that speed. 

The degree of longitudinal static stability about a trim paint is measured by the sialit margin, which can be defined 
in several ways. For this study, the static margin was taken to be the distance along the vehicle's longitudinal axis 
from the CG to the neutral stahilii\ paint (.Y,„„). which is the axial CG location dial gives C m = 0:

vehicle's longitudinal and lateral-directional responses were assumed to be decoupled. Also, the damping terms 
were neglected at hypersonic Mach numbers. These assumptions reduced the analysis to the computation of two 
parameters: the short-period t *•» and the Dutch-roll i/J) frequencies. The former is a measure of the vehicle's

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

ORBITER AEROSHELL SHAPE SELECTION 

A rcrcfcncc arbiter shape was selected by paramctrically screening candidate shapes using modified KcwUinian 
aerodynamics and ranking the shapes according to ihc goals of L/D = 0.6 - 0.8, minimum /»-. and maximum \ ", , . 
Figure 5 and Table 2 summarize the L/D = 0.6 shapes resulting from the study. In general, cllipslcds gave the best 
combination of the desired aerodynamic and geometric characteristics. Sphere-cones and biconics gave similar 
aerodynamic performance as the cllipslcd but they are generally longer and have less effective volume. The sphere- 
cone must Ily at a lower a in order to achieve the same I/O as die cllipslcd and biconic shapes. An cllipslcd 
modified lo have a flattened bottom is ihc shortest ol'all shapes, and has ihc lowest /(, and highest l',„.

A I/O of 0.8 would give entry corridor margin above 3-tr dispersions. The UD = 0.6 shapes could be flown at 
angles lower Uian 40 den "' order to improve performance. However, there is a corresponding increase in /.<, 
Instead, tiicL/O = 0.6 shapes can be lengthened or modified to have a non-circular cross-section. Lengthening of Uic 
vehicle would be expected to increase structural requirements and TPS mass. Therefore, modifications to the 
cllipslcd and biconic shapes were studied in order to keep the lolal nrbiter length down while improving I/O to 0.8. 
Figure 6 and Table 3 summarize ihosc results. The modifications to the cllipslcd and biconic bolh result in L/D - 
0.8. The hingest cllipslcd achieves I/O = 0.8, hut ai the expense of large fl„- The cllipslcd with an elliptic cross

Figure 10 compares the surface pressure coefficient as prcdicicd by the Newtonian method and LAURA CFD on 
the bottom surface of the oibitcr. The excellent agreement between the two meUiods is reflected in a comparison of 
the aerodynamic characteristics shown in Figure 1 1 . The Newtonian drag coefficient is within S% of the LAURA 
results for tlie i> range between 30 and 50 deg. The difference in predicted L/D is less dian 3%. The Newtonian 
pitching moment coefficient also predicts a trim aof40dcgond is almost identical to the CFD C„ results for all a. 

The Newtonian method provided remarkably good estimates of hypersonic aerodynamics. This is a reflection of the 
fact that hypersonic aerodynamics arc dominated by die inviscid surface pressure distribution and shear stresses 
have minimal effect.

STABILITY ANALYSIS 

The reference urbilcr C. shun n previous I) in Figure S indicates ilui die vehicle has a statically stable irim poini 
(C, < 0) for a = AQJeg. The .sialic margin, shown in Figure 12. is 6.2% of the vehicle's reference length. Typical 

static margin values fur conventional aircraft range from 5",. to 45%. This indicates that the reference iirnilcr has 
sufficient longitudinal stability and docs not compromise die vehicle's longitudinal controllability. 

The effect of CO movement on trim can be assessed by specifying the desired trim a and determining the 
required CG locations to achieve that angle. This analysis results in a line of CG points (the irimliiie} that give zero 
pitching moment. The trimlincs for the reference orbiter at u : 35, 40. and 45 deg are shown in Figure 1 3. This plot 
shows the geometrical relationship between CG placement, trim a, and static margin. The angle of each inmlinc 
relative to the body axis is determined by mil < < ', I (". i for a given a. Also, each trimlinc passes through the neutral 
stability point, at which ("„ = 0. Figure 13 shows that there is a small region near .V,/£,_ = 0.5 1 where the CG can 

be realistically placed within the aeroshcll- As the CG moves forward or rearward, ihc required lateral CG 
eventually moves beyond the outer mold line of the orbiter. and thus is physically impossible.

uncertainties arc intended to account for computational 
llin it j i ton., shape change due to ablation and 
deformation, and CO uncertainties. Estimates for 
aerodynamic uncertainties were based on an ellipslcd 
sliapc designed for direct entry at Mars'' and arc shown 
in Table H along with CO uncertainties. The 
aerodynamics uncertainties are consistent with the X-33 
uncertainty model , which provides a good guideline 
for mid-W shapes. An anglc-nf-atlack uncertainty of 4 
den reflects the uncertainty in the pitching moment 
coefficient and is larger than the uncertainty for typical 
blunt body entry vehicles. The extreme acroihcrmal 
environments could cause significant shape change and 
alter aerodynamic performance. The effects of large TPS 
recession on aerodynamic and CO uncertainties have nut 
been quantified. 

Figure 17 shows the effects of aerodynamic and CO 
uncertainties on L/D uncertainty. The largest contributor 
is die uncertainty in a, followed by the uncertainties in 
the basic aerodynamic coefficients, C, and C % . If ihc 
uncertainties are stacked on top of one another, ihc 
resulting L/D uncertainty is -*26.1%'-22_2%. If die 
square root of the sum of the squares of the uncertainties 
is used, the resulting L/D uncertainty is *-l3.4%M4.5%. 
The i-irUD range in a Monte-Carlo analysis would be 
expected to lie between the stacked and RSS ranges'.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

Acroshcll configuration, aerodynamics, and stability analyses were conducted as port of a systems analysis study 
for a Neptune orbitcr mission. Acrocapture is proposed as die method for delivering the spacecraft to the desired 
science orbit. Modified Newtonian theory was used to screen candidate mid-rVD shapes for aerodynamic 
performance {UD = 0.6 - 0.8. minimum />,,) and effective volume (maximum f„,>. A flat-bottomed ellipslcd with 
UD = 0.8 and ballistic coefficient of 895 kgfivr was selected as the reference orbitcr shape. The L/D of 0.8 gives 
margin to handle cases above 3-a caused by dispersions In aerodynamics, atmosphere, and navigation. A 
preliminary assessment was made for static longitudinal and dynamic lateral-directional stability. The orbitcr was 
shown to be longitudinally stable with a 6.2% static margin. It was also determined that ihc reference orbitcr "s short- 
period and Dulch-roll frequencies ore acceptable based on piloted- vehicle spccificaDons. Aerodynamics 
uncertainties were estimated to result in a L/D uncertainty of -1 3.4%.'- 14.5% using RSS values and +26. l%'-22.2% 
using stacked worst-case values.

INTRODUCTION 

An orbltcr mission is described combining solar electric propulsion for an inter-planetary transfer 
to Neptune and acrocapiurc technology* lor orbn insertion upon reaching Neptune. This paper evaluates the 
leas ibi lily of navigating a direct-entry acrocapturc at Neptune. The work is part of a NASA intcr-ccnicr 
study IRcf I]. 

Acrocapturc is an orbit insertion flight maneuver within a planetary atmosphere using drag to 
decelerate the spacecraft to orbital velocities with a single pass through the atmosphere. It requires zero or 
minimal propcllant to effect the orbit insertion. Acrocapturing into a closed elliptical orbit around Neptune 
has the advantage of allowing higher entry velocities than would otherwise be possible, thus reducing the 
interplanetary transfer time. It also reduces arrival mass for a given pay load mass. 

An established accuracy* requirement for the navigation sub-system did not exist at the time of this 
study. One of the purposes of this work then, was to set limits on the navigation error and. in collaboration 
with acrocapturc colleagues |Rcf I J. determine acrocapturc accuracy requirements for navigation. 

An error analysis requires detailed inputs in order to build the navigation model, so first a 
representative spacecraft proposed by the acrocapturc study group is described [Ref 2 & 3|, followed by a 
description of the target selection and mission design. Several systcin trades arc subsequently performed, 
including a trade on entry velocity at Neptune. 

REPRESENTATIVE SPACECRAFT CONFIGURATION 

The orbitcr is enclosed by an acroshell. The mass of the entire entry flight system is I BOO kg 
(including propcllant load). The lift-to-drag ratio 1 1. 1)i of the vehicle equals 0.6 and its ballistic coefficient 
(M'CpA) is approximately 1 30 kg<'m'. 

The spacecraft is modeled as a 3-axis- fixed spacecraft with momenium-whccl ACS stabilization. 
The momcnium wheels maintain spacecraft pointing, and balanced thrustcrs perform periodic momentum 
de-saturation burns. 

Solar electric propulsion (SEP) boosts the package after launch. SEP thrusts within the inner solar 
system, but all engines and solar arrays arc discarded beyond -3 a.u. A mono-propcllant hydrazine 
propulsion system remains after jettisoning the SEP. This subsystem performs the momcnium wheel dc- 
saturations and trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs) during the approach to Neptune. 



5" 



The telecommunications sub-system during the interplanetary transfer employs a Kj (or possibly 
X) -band high gain antenna (HGA) mounted on the back of the acroshcll for telemetry and navigation The 
HGA is a 1 m diameter dish antenna, with a 5 watt transmitter and a gain of 36dBi. At 30 a.u. the data rate 
to a 70 m ground antenna is -100 bps. Also mounted on the acroshcll arc forward-looking cameras for 
optical navigation. 

The tracking and telemetry sub-system will use a Small Deep Space Transponder, which supports 
phase coherent two-way dopplcr and ranging, command signal demodulation and detection, telemetry 
coding and modulation, and differential one- way range (DOR) tone generation (for AVLB1 measurements). 

TARGET SELECTION 

The Neptune target is determined by the post-insertion orbit, atmosphere characteristics, and the 
aerodynamic performance of the entry vehicle. 



The entry interface (El) target at the top of the atmosphere consists of three parameters: incrtial 
flight path angle (FPA). clock angle, and radius. The flight path angle is the angle subtended by the vehicle 
trajectory with the local horizontal at the entry interface radius (sec Appendix 1). The FPA used for this 
study is -ll.6°|Rcl" I]. The clock angle, as its name suggests, is a clockwise angular measure of the 
position of the target point on the projected face of Neptune's disk, measured from the T axis (sec 
Appendix 2). The entry interface radius is defined to be 25.757.0 km (an altitude IO00 km above the I bar 
ambient pressure level) (Rcf l|. 



The entry interface target and desired orbit characteristics arc provided in Table I .

TRAJECTORY OVERVIEW 

A pair of Neptune trajectories was chosen to perform trades. The pair is representative of a single 
interplanetary trajectory found by Saucr and Noca |Rcf 4]. The two trajectories arc equivalent except for 
their hyperbolic excess velocity. The v„*sarc 15.9 km's and IS.Skms.

Earth at entry is 29.8 a.u. (one-way light time equals 4 hours). 



journey of 10 or more years. The range to 



The approach trajectory is ballistic. The entry is retrograde, making the atmosphere-relative 
velocity at the El significantly higher than for a prograde entry. A retrograde entry imposes rigorous 
requirements on the flight system (high decelerations and heat loadings) but the subsequent capture orbit is 
preferable because it facilitates rendezvous with Triton (inclination equal to 157 1 and orbit period of 5.9 
days). Alicmativcly. as shown in Reference 5. a prograde entry is less demanding on the (light system but 
penalizes the mission with long period orbits (on the order of months) and expensive inclination changes (to 
align the spacecraft with Triton's orbit). The retrograde option was chosen for this study.

Reference 5 recommends an entry velocity near 29 km's. Trades are performed here on entry 
velocities of 28 km's and 30 km a, corresponding to v„= 15.9 kms and 18.5 km s respectively. 

The entry* vehicle enters the atmosphere at on altitude of 1000 km above the I bar level and 
descends to -200 km before climbing and exiting the atmosphere. Near apocentcr. a pcnccntcr-raise 
maneuver is performed to raise periccntcr out of the atmosphere. Sec Figure I . The Av needed to raise 
peril oiler to un altitude of 4000 km is 90 nvs. A 4000 km periccnlcr lies well above the atmosphere and 
satisfies Neptune- science measurement objectives |Ref 6|.

An entry velocity of 28 km's decelerates die orbitcr with a unit force of-5±3g's and slaws ihc 
vehicle -6 kni/s by die time of egress. At 30 km's the mean deceleration is ~Kg*s|Rcf3|. 

Short period orbits around Neptune (days, rather than months) arc desirable for science objectives. 
In addition to yielding more science i)uantitativcly. short period orbits have relatively low hyperbolic 
velocities •• an advantage for tour design and for observing Triton (assuming apocentcr is greater than 
Tnion's orbit |. Tour design benefits because gravity assist swing-bys are more efficient at low velocities 
I inverse-square relationship between trajectory-bending and v.). Triton observations benefit because 
longer exposure limes arc possible. Therefore Triton approach velocities should be kept us law as 
practical. 

The orbit radius of Triton is 354.000 km. Using the previous considerations as guidance, an 
apocentcr equal to 430.000 km was selected to satisfy science requirements and orbit commcnsurahibty 
This distance defines an orbit period of 80 hours and a 7:4 resonance with Triton [Rcf 7J.

Entry flight ruih angle is constrained by the physical limitations ol'ihc (light system (the vehicle 
must withstand aerodynamic, structural, and heat loads), and by the need to accumulate sufficient drag 
forces to slow the spacecraft (to avoid skipping-out). Error bars on the entry trajectory define a corridor

The diameter of the corridor through the atmosphere represents the maximum total uncertainty 
that can be accumulated by the vehicle — with contributions from the atmosphere, vehicle aerodynamics, 
and navigation. Corridor diameter defines the maximum tolerable limits along the acrocapturc flight path. 

Reaching the desired apocenter then, is a function of adjusting entry velocity. L'D. and ballistic 
coefficient. In Figure 2 entry corridor width is plotted versus entry velocity for a range of ballistic 
coefficients bounding representative vehicle sizes. (Note that this figure applies to an apocenter radius of 
400.000 km and not 430.000 km.) For the vehicle used here and an entry velocity' of 28 knVs. Figure 2 
indicates a theoretical corridor width of -1.4° (i.e. ±0.70°) while an entry velocity of 30 km's specifies a 
theoretical width of -2.0° (i.e. ±1.0"). Higher entry velocities provide additional margin but subject the 
vehicle to greater stress. 

The errors contributing to a corridor width corresponding to an entry velocity of 28 knvs and a 
vehicle L'D of 0.6 arc shown in Figure 3. The abscissa represents atmosphere variability, where the

NAVIGATION DATA 

The navigation accuracy achievable at the destination, or target, is established at the final control 
point along a trajectory {i.e. the last maneuver before reaching say. Neptune) and is usually termed the 
delivery accuracy, or simply the delivery. Since there is a limit on the accuracy with which an initial state 
and subsequent dynamics are known, the future state cannot be computed with complete certainty from an 
initial one. So a delivery at time T includes the future uncertainty expected in the spacecraft slate (at its 
time of arrival* I computed at time T. where T is before the time of arrival. That is. an E-2 day delivery 
represents the prediction of the location of the spacecraft at Neptune, when still 2 days away from Neptune. 

The error analysis undertaken here begins at Ncptunc-90 days. 

El'HEMERIS DETERMINATION

The second line in Table 2 represents the error in Neptune's position in 202 1 as currently projected 
by JPL's DE405 planetary ephemcris lie. a mapping of 2 1 years). (In an absolute sense these errors arc 
large, but the total error is only about one-third the planet's diameter.) Significant improvements to the 
ephemcris between now and 202 1 can be expected. As more observations arc acquired between now and 
arrival, a priori errors will decrease. For example, the Neptune a priori ephemcris error for Voyager II was 
-5000 km RSS (3a). For this analysis the assumed a priori error arc one-third the DE405 errors. Those 
errors arc shown on the third line in Table 2. 

OPTICAL DATA 

Target-relative iinaging is important in this mission because of the uncertainty in the location of 
Neptune. Optical navigation data arc used to reduce Neptune's errors. These data consist of digital images 
of Neptune and its satellites, set in front of a stellar background. The background stars, combined with 
Neptune's ephemcris. establish the spacecraft-Neptune relative position by astromctry. 

The optical navigation campaign begins at E-75 days. Ground-based facilities will process the 
transmitted pictures to extract the optical obscrvablcs. and the data will be combined with radiometric 
measurements. Data processing and observable-extraction require approximately eight hours to complete 
(as of 2003). 

Transmissions will be constrained by the down-link data rate (~100 bps). A schedule of one 
image per every four hours (6 pictures per day) satisfies this constraint. 

Early in the approach phase, one picture every other day is shuttered, alternating between Neptune 
and Triton. The picture frequency increases to six per day within 16 days of Neptune. This yields 
approximately 1 70 images in the complete optical data set. 

The imaging system envisioned here follows a design similar to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbitcr 
optical navigation camera. Relevant technical specifications of the MRO camera are: aperture = 6 cm, focal 
length = 50 cm. ficld-of-vicw = 1.4" per side, detector = 1024x1024 CCD array, pixel resolution = 50 urad. 
mass = 2.7 kg, peak power = 4 W |Rcf8). Higher performance cameras will yield better results. Therefore 
an advanced camera ("MRO plus") with a pixel resolution of 40 urad is also parameterized to show relative 
performance. 

For comparison with an operating mission, the Cassini wide-angle navigation camera has these 
specifications: aperture = 6 cm. focal length = 20 cm. ficld-of-vicw = 3.5" per side, detector = 1024x1024 
CCD array, pixel resolution = 60 urad. mass = 27 kg. peak power = 35 W [Rcf °|. The MRO camera offers 
higher resolution than Cassini. yet weighs less and operates with less energy (but has a smaller ficld-of- 
vicw).

Sec Appendix 3 for other camera parameters. 

TRACKING DATA 

Navigation tracking data consists of two-way and three-way coherent Ka-band dopplcr and range 
hum sure merits. (X-band data were found to perform equally as well.) These data arc augmented during 
approach with optical observations and intcrfcromciry. 

Intcrfcromctry enhances the solution relative to that achievable with dopplcr. range and optical data 
(although optical data dominates in a ranking of the relative importance of the four data types). In general 
though, intcrfcromctric data i.e. Delta Differenced One-way Range (ADOR). has limited effectiveness at the 
range of Neptune, although it can be used to some advantage in combination with the other data types. That 
is. while optical data determines planc-of-sky information for Neptune ( from which the planc-of-sky 
position of the spacecraft can be inferred). ADOR measurements can determine planc-of-sky spacecraft 
components directly. 

ADOR measurements are not constrained by the down-link, but require 24 hours to extract the 
observable from the data (conservatively). 

Data schedules used in this analysis for dopplcr. range and ADOR arc provided in Tabic 3. Data 
measurement accuracies arc listed in Appendix 3.

NAVIGATION MODEL 

Significant error sources in the navigation model are noted in the sub-sections below. Appendix 3 
lists all error sources and a priori uncertainties. 

MANEUVER PLACEMENT 

Maneuvers during the approach phase were placed as shown in Table 4 below. This is a 
representative schedule put together for the purposes of the error analysis. The last targeting maneuver 
during approach is the most sensitive to placement, for it defines the delivery accuracy. For this reason two 
opportunities arc shown in Table 4 for the final targeting maneuver E-2 days and E-l day. For the 
baseline strategy (E-2 days) the data cutoff is 3 days from Neptune, whereas the alternative strategy 
proposes a data cuto(T2 days from Neptune. The alternative strategy delivers smaller uncertainties but 
leaves less time to correct those errors before entry.

All maneuvers in Tabic 4 except TCM5 arc statistical maneuvers. The statistical analysis necessary 
lo size the statistical maneuvers has not been performed, but the mean Av lor TCM I and TCM2 probably 
will not exceed I m's (based on the ephemcris errors). The expected Av lor cither TCM3 or TCM V will be 
greater (but it is not expected to be more than an order of magnitude greater). The deterministic component 
of the TCM5 magnitude is °0 m>'s. 

ORBIT DETERMINATION 

The dominant orbit determination uncertainties consist of ephemcris errors. TCM execution 
uncertainties, and data errors. The uncertainties contributing to orbit determination errors arc listed in 
Appendix 3. 

RESULTS 

Delivery errors arc a combination of orbit determination errors and maneuver execution errors, 
mapped to the entry interface. Sensitivity trades in this sub-section look at optical navigation and or ADOR 
observations, delivery time, ephemcris errors, and entry velocity. 

Delivery uncertainties arc plotted in Figure 4 below. Neptune's ephemcris uncertainty is the 
predominant reason for the large uncertainties at the lelt edge of the figure. 

Figure 4 illustrates six options, or strategies. Option I is the baseline case: i.e. MRO-like camera 
with 6 pictures per day maximum, plus dopplcr. range and ADOR. 

Option 2 doubles the number of pictures acquired by the camera during the last two weeks of 
approach (an unlikely scenario given the assumed down-link rate). This option shows appreciable 
improvement with respect to Option I. Option 3 suggests the benefits that an advanced camera (MRO- 
plus) may offer, lis performance (with 6 pictures per day) is equivalent to Option 2 (with 1 2 pictures per 
day). Option 4 lacks ADOR measurements. Some degradation occurs with this loss but the degradation is 
not significant. The loss of ADOR can be balanced by substituting the advanced camera. Option 5 
illustrates the performance of the Cassini wide-angle camera. It docs not perform as well as the baseline 
case. Option 6 illustrates the inappropriatcness of performing this mission with only dopplcr and range 
data.

Entry Velocity = 28 km/s 

The geometry of this trajectory lacks bright background stars suitable for optical navigation (i.e. 
feu are visible behind Neptune}. The navigation information content per image is enhanced with multiple 
background stars, but a narrow field of view reduces the probability of capturing more than a single bright 
star. (Multiple stars determine the center point of Neptune more accurately because of the additional 
dcgrccs-of-constraint introduced.) The camera performances shown in Figure 4 arc not optimum because 
only a single star is visible per image until E-3.5 days. At that time a second star enters the licld-of-vicw. 
and the improvement in the delivery is significant. 

Sensitivities arc shown in Tables 5-8. The entries in Tables 5 and 6 reproduce Figure 4 in greater 
detail at selected times. Note that IPA entries in these tables don't mirror values Irom Figure 4 ut those 
selected times. The processing time for computing optical and ADOR obscrvahlcs introduces a lag during 
flight operations. That lag has been accounted for in Tables 5 and 6. but is not computed in Figure 4. That 
is. Figure 4 represents instantaneous processing ofoptical and ADOR measurements. For Tables 5 - 8, 
processing delays of 1 hours for optical data and 24 hours for ADOR are assuntcd. 

Toblcs 5 and (< show thai die proposed delivery requirement is satisfied at the time of Delivery B 
(E-3 days) for all of the tracking options with cameras. | Except for the Cassini option which narrowly 
misses.)

DISCUSSION 

optical navigation DATA 

This mission cannot be pcrfomicd without optical navigation, and even optical navigation offers 
little margin. For the nominal case under consideration (MRO-likc camera, picture frequency = 6 per day), 
the delivery requirement is satisfied at about E-3. 2 days. An additional day can be purchased, i.e. delivery 
at about E-l days, by employing a camera more advanced than the MRO version (MRO-plus) or by 
increasing the downlink rate to support a higher picture frequency. This strategy yields modest 
improvements, and the sensitivity to further camera development is evident. 

A more likely source to find immediate additional paper margin is from a well-designed picture 
sequence command file. The picture sequence file used in this analysis captured multiple stars only for the 
last 3.5 days, and the effect (the difference between a single and multiple stars) is significant and self- 
evident (sec Figure 4 again). With detailed optical navigation planning the delivery requirement could be 
satisfied by -E-I.5 days tor the nominal case, or as early as -E-5 days for the advanced camera (by 
extrapolation in Figure 4). 

Navigation images of Neptune, because of its atmosphere, have relatively large uncertainty 
(especially during the two weeks preceding entry). This uncertainly was mitigated by incorporating 
pictures of Triton because airless bodies do not degrade optical data in a way that an atmosphere does. (A 
ratio of 2 Triton pictures lor every I Neptune picture was used.) 

The (i pi7i>j*i ephemcris of Neptune is not important to the delivery. The mission can be 
undertaken with the current DE405 ephemcris and the current Triton a priori ephemens. 



68 



TRACKING DATA 

AI )ORs and optical daia arc orthogonally complementary and combine lo yield plots 1.2.3 and 5 in 
Figure 4. Plot 3 assumes an advanced camera (MRO-plus) and represents the best delivery in the current 
study (but <7% improvement over the baseline). Note that plot 2 is similar to plot 3. but represents a less 
advanced camera shuttering at twice the frequency. 

ADOR measurements improve delivery accuracy <5% alter accounting for the data processing lag 
(instantaneously the improvement is -10%). Improvement is possible because ADOR observations arc 
sensitive to state errors along components insensitive to dopplcr and range. 

There is no advantage to using Ka-band dopplcr tracking in place of X-band. Small benefits were 
seen with Ka-band ADOR observations {vts-a-vts X-band observations), but the overall improvement to the 
delivery was insignificant. 

PROPKI.LANT BUDGET 

As a rough estimate of propcllant loading, at least 105 m's of velocity change is required to get 
into orbit (i.e. not including on-orbit maintenance propcllant nor the allocation necessary to perform a 
Neptune-Triton orbital tour). The 105 m's total is composed of -12 m's of prc-inscrtion statistical Avand a 
deterministic Av =90 m's for TCM5 (the pcricentcr-raise maneuver - note: the statistical component of this 
maneuver is still TBD). An additional statistical maneuver (TCV14) is needed between egress and 
apoccntcr (before TCM5) to correct residual acrocapturc errors and achieve the apoccntcr target. The size 
of this maneuver is TBD. The 105 m's total is expected to grow significantly with these TBD additions. 

TCM4 and TCM5 arc scheduled with only one day separating them and both maneuvers must be 
designed and burned within -40 hours of egress. This is a difficult, but not impossible task to accomplish 
using traditional maneuver template procedures (/.*. no autonomy).

The MP L miwion was characterized by unbalanced and mis-modeled thrusting activities The 
level of thrusting required by ihc ACS system to maintain attitude significantly exceeded prc-launch 
expectations, and this mis-modeling contributed to ihc entry flight path angle uncertainty shown in Table 9. 

Huygcns (the Cassini probe) anticipates a delivery uncertainty of ±3.0". One reason for the large 
deliver)' error is the Titan cpheincris uncertainty. Another reason is the tour re-design Cassini has 
undergone recently | Ref 1 1 ]. 

The MER delivery, on the other hand, is significantly smaller than the Neptune Orbitcr delivery. 
Mars' well-known ephemcris and MER's lower hyperbolic excess velocity are contributors to this 
improvement. 

SUMMARY 

This preliminary study has basclincd the use of optical observations and ADOR measurements for 
delivering an acrocaplurc orbitcr to Neptune. The study has also proposed a conservative entry FPA 
requirement of ±0.55° (3a) based on delivery results that accommodate the acrocapture. The proposed 
delivery requirement is satisfied at E-3.2 days. This date can be pushed earlier in all likelihood (further 
from Neptune) with subsequent follow-up optimization of (i) the picture sequence file and (ii) camera 
design. 

This study makes two recommendations to enhance performance at Neptune: 

■ Development of a targctablc. advanced optical navigation camera. The MRO navigation camera 
currently under development represents a satisfactory technological readiness level, but an 
advanced version will buy margin. 

* Second, incorporation of on-board autonomous maneuver capability. 

ADOR measurements oiler negligible benefit. This analysis does not support a navigation strategy 
incorporating ADOR measurements. 

Proposed entry requirements can be met using the equivalent of a future DE405«/>riori Neptune 
ephemcris such as that described in Table 2. 

This work represents a first-cut effort at determining concept feasibility. Many simplifying 
assumptions were made, especially with respect to the optical data, in order to accomplish this study in a 
timely manner.

APPENDIX 2: B-PI.ANE DESCRIPTION 

Plancl or satellite approach trajectories ate typically described in alining plane coordinates 
referred lo as "B plane" coordinates (sec Figure). The B-planc is a plane passing through the body center 
and perpendicular to the asymptote of the incoming trajectory (assuming two body conic motion). The "B- 
vector" is a vector in that plane, from the body center to the piercing-point of the trajectory asymptote. The 
B* vector specifics where the point of closest approach would be if the target body had no mass and did not 
deflect the flight path. Coordinate axes arc defined by three orthogonal unit vectors, S. T, and R. with the 
system origin at the center of the target body. S is parallel lo the spacecraft v, vector (approximately the 
velocity vector at the time of entry into the target body's gravitational sphere of influence). T is arbitrary, 
but typically specified to lie in the ecliptic plane (the mean plane of the Earth's orbit), or in the body 
equatorial plane. Finally. R completes an orthogonal triad with S and T. 




Arning Plane Coordinate System Definition 

Orbit determination errors can be characterized by a statistical dispersion ellipse in the aiming plane 
i B plane) and a statistical uncertainty along the S (down-track) direction. In the Figure. SMI A and SMAA 
denote the semi-minor and semi-major axes of the dispersion ellipse (he. 50% of the distance across the 
ellipse along the respective coordinate). The angle II is measured clockwise from T to SMAA.

There arc eight destinations in the Solar System with sufficient atmosphere for 
aerocapture to he a viahlc aero assist option: Venus. I ai lb. Mars. Jupiter, Saturn and its 
moon Titan. Uranus, and Neptune. Engineering-level atmospheric models for four of these 
targets - Earth. Mars. Titan, and Neptune • have been developed for NASA to support 
systems analysis studies of potential future aerocapture missions. Development of a similar 
atmospheric model for Venus has recently commenced. An important capability of all of 
these models is their ability to simulate quasi-random density perturbalioas for Monte Carlo 
analysis in developing guidance, navigation and control algorithms, and for thermal systems 
design Similarities and differences among these atmospheric models arc presented. with 
emphasis on the recently developed Neptune model and on planned characteristics of the 
Venus model. Example applications for aerocapture are also presented and illustrated. 
Recent updates (o the Titan atmospheric model are discussed, in anticipation of application 
to trajectory and atmospheric reconstruct for the Huygens Probe entry at Titan.

INTRODUCTION 

ENGINEERING-LEVEL atmospheric models have been developed, or are under development, for live of the 
eight possible Solar System destinations where aerocapture could be used. These include Global Reference 
Atmospheric Models (GRAMs) for Earth (GRAM-99)'-, Mars (Mars-GRAM 2001)'*. Titan (Titan-GRAM) 1 . 
Neptune (Ncptunc-GRAM)' 1 . and Vcnus-GRAM (under development). Physical characteristics of the various 
planetary atmospheres vary significantly. Likewise, significant variation is found in the amount of available data on 
which to base the respective engineering-level atmospheric models. The detailed characteristics of these models 
differ accordingly. 

Earth-GRAM is based on climatology assembled from extensive observations by balloon, aircraft, ground-based 
remote sensing, sounding rockets, and satellite remote sensing. Details arc provided in the GRAM User's Guide 1 . 
Mars-GRAM is based on climatologies of General Circulation Model (GCM) output, with details given in the Mars- 
GRAM User's Guide*. Mars-GRAM has been validated'" by comparisons against observations made by Mars 
Global Surveyor, and against output from a separate Mars GCM. In contrast, data used to build Titan-GRAM and 
Ncptunc-GRAM arc more limited, deriving primarily from Voyager observations and limited ground-based stellar 
occultation measurements. Titan-GRAM is based on data summarized in Ref. 9, while Ncptunc-GRAM was built 
from summaries of data contained in Ref. 10. For Venus, a substantial amount of data has been collected from 
orbiter and entry probe observations. These have been summarized in the Venus International Reference 
Atmosphere (VIRA)". which fomis the basis for Vcnus-GRAM (under development).

Atmospheric Density Comparison 



Figure I shows the wide variety of 
temperature profiles encountered among the 
planets and Titan. For Earth. Venus. Mars, and 
Titan, height is measured from a reference 
surface mican sea level on Earth). On 
Neptune, height is measured above die level at 
which pressure is one bar (Earth normal sea- 
level pressure). All of the planets exhibit a 
troposphere region, where temperature 
decreases with altitude, indicative of heat flow 
upward from die surface |on average). All of 
die p lands exhibil a thcrmosphere region, 
where ion average) temperature increases with 
altitude, because of absorption of heat flux 
from the Sun as n penetrates into the 
atmosphere. All of the planets have 
stratospheres, where temperature decrease 
above the surface diminishes, and remains 
relatively constant until the base of the 
thcrmosphere (Earth being the exception to 
this, where the presence of ozone and resullanl 
atmospheric beating produces a local 
temperature maximum in Earth's stratosphere- 
mesospherc region). 

For interest in acrocapturc or acrohrakmg, 
atmospheric density is the most important 
parameter. Fig. 2 compares density profiles on 
the planets and Titan. Vertical dashed lines in 
Fig. 2 indicate typical density values at which 
acrocapturc or acrobraking operations would 
occur. Intersections of the acrocapturc dashed 
line with various density* curves shows that 
acrocapturc would occur at a wide range of 
altitudes at the various destinations, varying 
from about 50 km at Mars to about 300 km at 
Titan. Acrobraking at Earth. Mars, and Venus 
would take place near, and just above, the 100 
km level. At Neptune and Titan, acrobraking 
would be implemented near 550 km and 750 
km. respectively. 

Figure 2 shows that density decreases fairly 
rapidly with altitude for the terrestrial planets I Venus. Earth. Mars), while it decreases rather slowly for Neptune and 
Titan. This effect is explained by differences in density scale height. //. for the various planets and Titan. Density 
decreases rapidly with altitude if H is small, while it decreases slowly if H is large. // is proportional to pressure 
scale height | R T / i M e l |. For the terrestrial planets, molecular mass M is large [M = 2 u -44), so W is small. On 
Neptune. H is large because .1/ is small for Neptune's hydrogcn-hclium atmosphere (A/ = 2). For Titan. H is large 
despite the high molecular mass of its atmosphere (M e 29), because its gravity is low.

BASIS FOR THF: ATMOSPHERIC MODELS 

In Earth-ORAM. Mars-GRAM. and Vcnus-GRAM. input values for date. time, latitude, longitude, etc. are used 
to calculate planetary position and solar position. In this manner, effects of latitude variation and seasonal and time- 
of-day variations con be computed explicitly. A simplified approach is adopted in Tiun-GRAM and Neptune- 
GRAM, whereby these effects, as well as effects of relatively large measurement uncertainties for these planets, are 
represented within a prescribed envelope of mimmum-avcragc-maximum density versus altitude. Figure 3 shows 



75 



this envelope fn i Titan. Engineering atmospheric model data developed fur Die Huygcns entry probe' arc used bi 
define the Titan envelope. For Neptune, data from Ref. 10 arc employed lo generate a comparable minimum- 
maximum envelope, as shown in Fig. 4.

A single model input parameter (Fminmax) allows the user of Tilan-tiRAM or Ncptunc-GRAM lo select where 
wilhin the min-max envelope a particular simulation will fall. Fminmax = -I, 0, or I selects minimum, average, or 
maximum conditions, respectively, with intermediate values determined by interpolation (i.e., Fminmax between II 
and I produces values between average and maximum). Effects such as variation with latitude along a given 
trajectory path can be computed using the appropriate representation of Fminmax variation with latitude. 

Since drag is proportional to density, density is 



the most important atmospheric parameter for 
acrocapture. Next most important Is height 
variation of density, as characterized by density 
scale height. Density scale height is Important In 
determining acrocapture corridor width, or entry 
angle range that allows the vehicle to achieve 
capture orbit without "skipping out" or "burning 
in". As discussed above, small density scale height 
means rapid change of density with altitude, which 
results in low corridor width. Large density scale 
height implies slow density change with altitude, 
and large corridor width. 

Figure 5 compares height profiles of density 
scale height among the planets and Titan. 
Acrocapture altitude |c.f. discussion of Fig 2) is 
indicated by letter A in Fig. 5. This figure shows 
low density scale heights (4-8 km) at acrocapture 
altitudes for the terrestrial planets. Larger scale 
heights i = 30-50 km) occur at acrocapture altitudes 
on Neptune and Titan.

TITAN-CRAM CM OPTION 

An option has recently been added for using Titan General Circulation Model (GCM) data as input for Titan- 
GRAM. These Titan GCM data are derived from graph* in Ref 1 2. Upper altitudes for the Tilan GCM option are 
computed using a parameterized fit to Titan exosphcrte temperatures, taken from graphs in Ref 13. Figure 6 shows a 
height-latitude cross section of density, expressed as percent deviation from the mean, for Voyager encounter date

Based on the Venus International Reference 
Atmosphere (VlltA)". Vcnus-GRAM is being 
developed and applied in ongoing Venus 
acrocapiurc performance analyses. Figure 8 shows 
a plot of density (percent deviation from the mean) 
versus height and latitude from Vcnus-GRAM. 
Conditions in Fig. 8 arc for Ls = "(V and local solar 
time= 12 Venus hours. 

Below about 100 km altitude on Venus, we find 
that temperature, density, and density scale height 
conditions are very uniform with both latitude and 
time of day. VIRA data below 100 km altitude vary 
only slightly with latitude and have no dependence 
on local solar time. Between 100 km and 150 km. 
VIRA data depend on local solar time, but not 
latitude. From 150 km to its top at 250 km. VIRA 
depends on solar /cniih angle, which is affected by 
both latitude and local solar time.

PERTl RBATION MODELS 

An Imponant feature of all the GRAM atmospheric models is their ability to simulate "high frequency*' 
pcrturbatioas in density and winds, due to such phenomena as turbulence and various kinds of atmospheric waves. 
Ah illustrated in Fig. 9. Earth-GRAM altitude, latitude, and monthly variations of perturbation standard deviations 
arc based on a large climatology of observations. For Titan-GRAM and Ncptunc-GRAM. perturbation standard 
deviations arc computed from an analytical expression for gravity wave saturation conditions, explained more fully 
in Rcf 7. As shown in Fig. °. the resulting vertical profiles of standard deviations for Titan and Neptune are not 
dissimilar to Earth observations, when expressed as percent of mean density. For Mars-GRAM. a similar gravity 
wave saturation relation is used to estimate density perturbation standard deviations, except that effects of 



77 



-i gn nk jut topographic variation on Mars arc also taken inlo account. Up to about 75 km altitude, the Mars model 
density standard deviations arc also fairly consistent with Earth observations. By about I Oil km to 130 km altitude. 
Mars model density standard deviations increase to about 20% to 35% ol" mean value, consistent with observed 
orbit-to-orbit density variations observed by Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey.

percent deviation from Neptune mean value. 



A typical application of the Ncptunc-GRAM perturbation model is shown in Figure 10. Neplunc-GRAM was 
recently utilized in Neptune acrocapturc systems studies for trajectory analysis. The chosen acrocapturc design 
reference mission included simulations which involved capture into a highly eccentric orbit, to allow the otbiler In 
periodically visit Triton for scientific observations. The ability to successfully acrocapturc into such an eccentric 
orbit depends very significantly on details of Monte Carlo trajectory simulations, particularly on atmospheric density 
variations such as illustrated in Fig 10. For such an eccentric oibit. there is relatively little margin for error between 
a captured orbit and one which exceeds escape velocity upon atmospheric exit, a result which could ultimately lead 
to mission failure. Ncptunc-GRAM was used lo define an acrocapturc corridor width consistent with mission 
success. 



CONCLUSIONS 

The engineering-level atmospheric models presented hero ore suitable for a wide range of mission design, 
systems analysis, and operations tasks. For orbitcr missions, applications include analysis for aerucapturo or 
acrobntking operations, analysis of station-keeping issues for science orbits, analysis of orbital lifetimes forend-of- 
mission planetary protection orbits, and atmospheric entry issues for accidental break-up and bum-up scenarios. For 
lander missions to Venus. Mors and Titan, and for Eanh-rcturn. applications Include analysis for entry, descent and 
landing |EDL). and guidance, navigation and control analysis for precision landing and hazard avoidance 
Perturbation simulation capabilities of Uicse models moke them especially useful In Monte Carlo analyses for design 
and testing of guidance, navigation, and control algorithms, and for heal loads analysis of thermal protection

Aerocapture uses atmospheric drag to decelerate into captured orbit from interplanetary 
transfer orbit. This includes capture into Karth orhii from, for example. I.unar-return or 
Mars-return orbit. 1 i^hl Solar System destinations have sufficient atmosphere for 
aerocaplure to be applicable -three of the rocky planets (Venus, Karth, and Mars), four gas 
giants < Jupiter. Saturn, I'ranus, and Neptune), and Saturn's moon Titan. These destinations 
fall into two. general groups: (I) The rocky planets, which have warm surface temperatures 
lahout 200 K to 750 K) and rapid decrease of density with altitude, and (2) the gas giants and 
Titan, which have cold temperatures (about 70 K to 170 Kl at the surface or 1-bar pressure 
level, and slow rate of decrease of density with altitude. Aerocapture altitudes at the gas 
giants topically range from about 150 km to 300 km above the l-har pressure reference. 
Aerocapture at the rocky planets would occur at altitudes of about 50 km to 100 km. In 
contrast, aerohraking (circularizing a highly elliptical capture orbit, using multiple 
atmospheric passes) would occur at widely varying altitudes ranging from about 125 km out 
to 700 km for Titan. In addition to aerocapture altitude, aerocapture corridor width is also 
determined hj details of the atmospheric densih profile. Corridor width is the range of 
atmospheric entry angles allowable for successful aerocapture, i.e., achieving capture orbit 
without "skip-out" or "burn-up". Corridor width is significant!) affected by rale of change 
of density, as measured by the density scale height, at aerocapture pcriapsis altitude. 
Density scale height is the vertical distance over w hich density changes by a factor of e. (i.e., 
logarithmically). Larger scale height values mean slower density variation with height and 
larger corridor width; smaller scale height leads to smaller corridor width. For the rocky 
planets, the overall rapid fall-off of density with height leads to relatively low density scale 
heights at aerocapture altitudes and small aerocapture corridor widths for these 
destinations, larger density scale heights, with consequently larger corridor widths, result 
from the slower density fall-of with height for Titan and the gas giant planets. Density scale 
height values al periapsis for the rocky planets van from about -I km to 8 km: for the gas 
giant planets and Titan this range is about 25 km to 50 km. Kngineering-level atmospheric 
models for Karth, Mars. Titan, and Neptune have been developed for NASA systems analysis 
studies of potential future aerocapture missioas. Development of a similar atmospheric 
model for Venus has recently commenced. These models are collectively referred to as 
Global Reference Atmosphere Models, or GRAMs. An important capability of all of the 
GRAM models is their ability to simulate quasi-random density perturbations for Monte 
('arlo analyses in developing guidance, navigation, and control algorithms, and for thermal 
systems design. Small-scale rool-mcan-square trmsl density perturbatioas observed for 
Karth may be compared with those modeled for Mars. Titan, and Neptune. Monte-Carlo 
simulations of density variations for Neptune atmospheric conditions yield minimum, 
average, and maximum density profiles due to expected variations wilh season, latitude. 
time-of-dav, etc. Details of Ihese comparisons and simulations are discussed.

INTRODUCTION 

ENGINEERING-LEVEL atmospheric models have been developed, or arc under development, for five of the 
eight possible Solar System destinations where acrocapture could be used. These include Global Reference 
Atmospheric Models (GRAMs) for Earth (GRAM-99}' 1 . Mats (Mars-GRAM 2001)'*, Titan <Tiian-GRAM)'. 
Neptune (Neptunc-GRAM)*. and Vcnus-GRAM (under development I. Physical characteristics of the various 
planetary atmosphctcs vary significantly. Likewise, significant variation is found in the amount of available data on 
which to base the respective engineering-level atmospheric models. The detailed characteristics of these models 
differ accordingly. 

Earth-GRAM is based on climatology assembled from extensive observations by balloon, aircrall. ground-based 
remote sensing, sounding rockets, and satellite remote scasing. Details arc provided in the GRAM User's Guide* 
Mars-GRAM is based on climatologies of General Circulation Model (GCM) output widi details given in the Mars- 
GRAM User's Guide*. Mars-GRAM has been validated 1 * 11 by comparisons against observations made by Mars 
Global Surveyor, and against output from a separate Mars GCM. In contrast, data used to build Titan-GRAM and 
Neptunc-GRAM arc more limited, deriving primarily from Voyager observations and limited ground-based stellar 
occultalion measurements. Tilan-GRAM is based on data summarized in Rcf. ■>. while Neptunc-GRAM was built 
from summaries of data contained in Rcf. 10. For Venus, a substantial amount of data has been collccled from 
orbiter and entry probe observations. These have been summarized in the Venus International Reference 
Atmosphere (VJRA)", which forms the basis for Vcnus-GRAM I under development). 

Figure I shows the wide variety of 
temperature profiles encountered among the 
planets and Titan. For Earth. Venus. Mors, and 
Titan, height is measured from a reference 
surface (mean sea level on Earth). On 
Neptune, height is measured above the level at 
which pressure is one bar (Earth normal sea- 
level pressure). All of the planets exhibit a 
troposphere region, where temperature 
decreases with altitude, indicative a( heat lluw 
upward from die surface |on average). All of 
the planets exhibit a thcrmosphcrc region, 
where |on average) temperature increases with 
altitude, because of absorption of heat flux 
from the Sun as it penetrates into the 
atmosphere. All of the planets have 
stratospheres, where temperature decrease 
above the surface diminishes, and remains 
relatively constant until the base of the 
thcrmosphcrc (Eardi being the exception to 
this, where the presence of ozone and resultant 
atmospheric beating produces a local 
temperature maximum in Earth's stratosphere- 
mesospherc region). 

For inicrest in acrocapture or aerobmking, atmospheric density is the most important parameter. Figures 2 and 3 
compare density profiles for the gas giants and the rocky planets. Vertical dashed lines in the figures indicate l>pical 
density values at which acrocapture or aerobmking operations would occur. Intersections of the acrocapture dashed 
line with various density curves shows (hat acrocapture would occur at a wide range of altitudes at the various 
destinations, varying from about 50 km at Mars to about 300 km at Titan. Aerobraking at Earth. Mors, and Venus

Next most important is height variation of density, as characterized by density scale height. Density scale height 
is important in determining aerocapturc corridor width, or entry angle range dial allows Uic vehicle to achieve 
capture orbit without "skipping out" or "burning in". As discussed above, small density scale height means rapid 
change of density widi altitude, which results in low corridor width. Large density scale height implies slow density 
change wiUi altitude, and large corridor widUi. 

Figures 6 and 7 compare height profiles of density scale height among Uic gas giants and the rocky planets. 
Aerocapturc altitude |c.f. discussion of Fig 2) is indicated by letter A in Figs. 6 and 7. These figures show low 
density scale heights (4-K km) at aerocapturc altitudes for Uic terrestrial planets. Larger scale heights (>= .'0-50 km) 
occur at aerocapturc altitudes on Neptune and Titan.

Below about 100 km altitude on Venus, wc 
find that temperature, density, and density

both latitude and time of day. VIRA data 
below 100 km altitude vary only slightly with 
latitude and have no dependence on local solar 
time. Between 100 km and 150 km. VIRA data 
depend on local solar time, but not latitude. 
From 150 km to Us top al 250 km, VIRA 
depends nn solar zenith angle, which is 
affected by hoth latitude and local solar time.

PERTURBATION MODELS 

An imponant feature of all the ORAM atmospheric models Is their ability to simulate "high frequency" 
perturbations in density and winds, due to such phenomena as turbulence and various kinds of atmospheric waves. 
As illustrated in Fig. II. Earth-GRAM altitude, latitude, and monthly variations of perturbation standard deviations 
are based on a large climatology of observations. For Titan-GRAM and Ncptunc-GRAM, pcrtuibaUon standard 
deviations are computed from an analytical expression for gravity wave saturation conditions, explained more fully 
in Ref. 7. As shown in Fig. II, the resulting vertical proliles of standard deviations for Titan and Neptune arc not 
dissimilar to Earth observations, when expressed as percent of mean density . For Mars-GRAM. a similar gravity 
wave saturation relation Is used to estimate density perturbation standard deviations, except dial effects of 
significant topographic variation on Mars arc also lokcn into account. Up to about 75 km altitude, the Mars model 



84 



density standard deviations arc aUo fairly consistent with Earth observations. By about 100 km to 130 km altitude. 
Mars model density standard deviations increase to about 20% to 35% ol" mean value, consistent with observed 
orbit-lo-orbit density variations observed by Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey.

A typical application of the Ncptunc-GRAM perturbation model is shown in Fig. 12. Ncptunc-GRAM was 
recently utilized in Neptune acrocapturc systems studies for trajectory analysis. The chosen acrocapturc design 
reference mission included simulations which involved capture into a highly eccentric orbit, to allow the orbitcr to 
periodically visit Triton for scientific observations. The ability to successfully acrocapturc into such an eccentric 
orbit depends very significantly on details of Monte Carlo trajectory simulations, particularly on aunosphcric density 
variations such as illustrated in Fig. 12. Far such an eccentric orbit, there is relatively little margin for error between 
a captured orbit and one which exceeds escape velocity upon atmospheric exit, a result which could ultimately lead 
to mission failure. Ncptunc-GRAM was used to define an acrocapturc corridor width consistent with mission 
success. 

CONCLUSIONS 

The engineering-level atmospheric models presented here ore suitable for a wide range of mission design, 
systems analysis, and operations tasks. For orbitcr missions, applications include analysis for aciocapture or 
aerobrak i ng operations, analysis of station-keeping issues for science orbits, analysis of orbital lifetimes forend-of- 
mission planetary protection orbits, and atmospheric entry issues for accidental break-up and bum-up scenarios. For 
lander missions to Venus. Mors and Titan, and for Earth-return, applications include analysis for entry, descent and 
landing iIDI.i. and guidance, navigation and control analysis for precision landing and hazard avoidance 
Pcrturbation simulation capabilities of diesc models moke them especially useful in Monte Carlo analyses for design 
and testing of guidance, navigation, and control algorithms, and for heal loads analysis of ilieim.il protection 
systems.

■.hull aerocaplurc is used lo capture a spacecraft at Neptune. Aerocaplurc uses aerody- 
namic drag instead of propulsion to decelerate from the interplanetary approach trajectory 
lo a captured orbit during a single pass through the atmosphere. After capture, propulsion is 
used to move the spacecraft from the initial captured orbit to the desired science orbit. A 
preliminary assessment identified that a spacecraft with a lift to drag ratio of 0.8 was re- 
quired for aerocaplurc. Performance analyses of the 0.8 1./I) vehicle Here performed using a 
high fidelity flight simulation within a Monte Carlo executive to determine mission success

modified to include Neptune specific atmospheric and planet models, spacecraft aerody- 
namic characteristics, and intcrplandary trajectory models. To these were added autono- 
mous guidance and pseudo (light controller models. The Monte Carlo analyses incorporated 
approach trajectory delivery errors, aerodynamic characteristics uncertainties, and atmos- 
pheric density variations. Monte Carlo analyses were performed for a reference set of uncer- 
tainties and sets of uncertainties modified to produce increased and reduced atmospheric 
variability. For the reference uncertainties, the 0.8 IJI) flatbottom dtipslcd vehicle achieves

NEPTUNE-TRITON EXPLORATION REFERENCE MISSION 

The reference Neptune-Triton exploration mission was designed to provide Cassini and Galileo level explora- 
tion of the Neptune system. 1 The reference mission has a science orbiter to explore the Neptune-Triton system and 
two probes that enter Neptune's atmosphere 60 degrees apart in latitude. The science orbiter is placed in orbit about 
Neptune using an acrocapturc maneuver described below. The science orbit can range between 3896 x 355000 km 
and 3896 x 500000 km. The acrocapturc maneuver would be followed by propulsive maneuvers to place the space- 
craft in a phasing orbit such that subsequent maneuvers would establish an orbit that would encounter Triton at regu- 
lar intervals. Triton is then used as a tour engine to vary the orbit's inclination and line of apsides similar to Cas- 
sini's use of Titan. The reference orbiter would measure atmospheric, magnetic, and gravity characteristics and per- 
form global imaging of both Triton and Neptune. 

Launch dates studied for the Ncptune-Tnton Exploration mission range from 2016 to 2019. A February 21,2017 
launch date was chosen for this study with launch on a Delta IV 4050 Heavy launch vehicle inside a 5m fairing and a 
transit time of 10.25 years .The launch spacecraft configuration consists of the orbiter. two entry probes, and a solar 
electric propulsion module. Five months prior to reaching Neptune, the two probes are released sequentially such 
that both probes* missions are completed before the orbiter reaches Neptune. Four and a half months prior to reach- 
ing Neptune, a trajectory dellcction maneuver is performed to target the entry interface point for acrocapturc. Thirty 
minutes prior to entry interlace the SEP is jettisoned. After atmospheric entry, the spacecraft executes the acrocap- 
turc maneuver described below to place the orbiter in the exploration orbit and begin a two or more year science 
mission. 

/. Atfotapturt Overview 

Acrocapturc is a form of acroassist used to insert a spacecraft into a desired orbit at targets with an atmosphere. 
Acrocapturc uses aerodynamic forces to dissipate the hyperbolic approach energy to an energy level needed to reach 
a target apoapsis after making a single pass through the atmosphere. An active guidance system must be used during 
the acropass to compensate for uncertainties in entry flight path angles, atmospheric density profiles, and aerody- 
namics. After exiting the atmosphere, propulsive maneuvers arc required to change the spacecraft's exit orbital ele- 
ments to that of the desired phasing orbit. These maneuvers include a pcriapsis raise and any needed adjustments in 
apoapsis. inclination, and longitude of ascending node. The acrocapturc maneuver is illustrated in Fig. I. After the 
proper phasing with Triton is achieved, additional propulsive maneuvers arc performed to provide the desired Triton 
encounter strategy. The AV required for the initial pcriapsis raise and assumed apoapsis for phasing was used as a 
pcrfonnancc metric in this study.

A high fidelity 3 DOF simulation 
of the acrocapturc maneuver used to 
inseri the spacecraft into its phasing 
otbit was developed in the program to 
optimize simulated trajectories. 
POST . The acrocapturc trajectory was 
simulated from the navigation delivery 
point, nominally 60 seconds prior to 
atmospheric interlace, to atmospheric 
exit. The simulation determined the 
spacecraft's trajectory through Nep- 
tune's atmosphere and tracked key de- 
sign parameters such as heat loads, 
deceleration loads, and AV required 
for the pcriapsis raise and apoapsis ad- 
justments. The simulation was run in a Monte Carlo using 
uncertainties in the delivery point, spacecraft aerodynam- 
ics, and atmospheric density profiles to provide statistical 
data for the design parameters. 

The simulation incorporated delivered states, aerody- 
namics, guidance, and control models specifically devel- 
oped for the acroshcll and a model of Neptune's atmos- 
phere as shown in Fig. 2. A brief description of each 
model follows. 

ATMOSPHERE 

An engineering type model of Neptune's atmosphere 
developed at Marshall Space Flight Center provided at- 
mospheric state properties and composition-'' The model, 
named Ncptunc-CiRAM. is a global reference atmospheric 
model- Ncptunc-GRAM's state and composition properties 
were based on data from Uic Voyager flyby and stellar oc- 
culiaiions.' Refer to reference 6 for a complete description 
ofNcptunc-ORAM. 

Neptune's state property versus altitude relationships 
vary with latitude, season and time of day. These varia- 
tions are represented in Neptune-<iRAM by a parameter 
termed Fminmax. Fminmax ranges from -I to *J and is 
used to select a state property versus altitude profile tin- a 
particular latitude, season and time of day. Figure 3 shows 
the maximum range of density versus altitude profiles. 

In the acrocapturc simulation, the density versus alti- 
tude relationship was made to vary with latitude by mak- 
ing Fminmax a cosine function of latitude and was made to 
vary with season by adding a constant bias term. Fbias. to 
the latitudinal variation as shown in Eq. I.

AERODYNAMICS 

A high fidelity aerodynamics model of the Hat bottom cl- 
lipsled oeroshcll was developed and incorporated into the 
simulation as an aerodynamic coefficient database. The data- 
base supplied axial and normal force coefficients as a func- 
tion of angle of attack in the hypersonic flight regime. 7 The 
aerodynamic force coefficients were considered constant 
throughout the acropass- Refer to reference 7 for more infor- 
mation regarding aerodynamics. The acroshell geometry is 
shown in Fig. 6. 



NAVIGATION 

The Neptune-Triton Exploration Mission navigation 
model was provided by JPL. The navigation model deter- 
mined vehicle entry states about a nominal -12.82° entry 
(light path angle and 29.0 kms entry velocity. The modeled 
navigation system delivered the spacecraft to atmospheric in- 
terface with a 3o~ dispersion of 10.51" about the nominal entry 
flight path angle . Refer to reference S for a complete descrip- 
tion of the navigation model. Table t summarues the naviga- 
tion data used in the simulation.

GUIDANCE 

The Hybrid Predictor-corrector Aerocapturc Scheme 
(HYPAS) aerocapturc guidance algorithm developed at John- 
son Space Center provided autonomous guidance for the 
simulation.* The HYPAS algorithm is an analytical control 
algorithm based on drag acceleration and altitude rate error 
for an aeropuu through an exponential atmosphere. 

In this study, two attitude control schemes were used by 
HYPAS. In the first, attitude control was limited to bank an- 
gle modulation. Bank angle controlled the rate of dc- 
scent/ascent and effected drag through changes in atmos- 
pheric density. In this study, bank angle modulation was de- 
fined as the baseline guidance model. In the second attitude 
control scheme, altitude control included bolh angle of attack 
and bank angle modulation. Angle of attack modulation was 

used first to modulate the L D and ballistic coefficient to meet the desired vertical L'D or exit velocity. If changes in 
ballistic coefficient were not sufficient to meet the targets then bonk angle modulation was used to further effect

TO 



drag. As the requited LI) and drag changed due to high frequency density perturbations, angle of attack modulation 
»ji used lo drive ihc bank angle lo 90". In this study, the combined bank and angle of attack modulation was de- 
fined as die alpha modulated guidance model. Botii the baseline and advanced guidance models used roll reversals 
lo maintain the wedge angle between the exit orbit and Triton's oihit to wiUun 1". Refer lo reference X fur complete 
descriptions of the bank modulated and alpha modulated guidance models. 



CONTROL 

A 3-DOF Pscudo controller developed at Langlcy 
Research Center was used to approximate the attitude 
dynamics of a fi DOF system The controller analyti- 
cally calculated the time and angular travel required to 
reach die guidance commanded attitude. Once calcu- 
lated, die controller ramped bank angle and or angle of 
attack lo the commanded value at a user specified 
maximum acceleration until the altitude rate reached a 
user specilicd maximum. The maximum acceleration 
and rates arc defined such dial die 3-DOF response is 
a good approximation of ihc 6-DOF system. This ap- 
proach has provided good agreement with 6-DOF sys- 
tems in previous simulations. Figure 7 shows the bank 
response to a bonk command for the 3-DOF controller.

MONTE CARLO ANALYSIS 

The vehicle performance was quantified by statistical data from Monte Carlo Analyses. The analyses consisted 
of 2000 individual Neptune acrocapturc simulations with random perturbations in arrival states, vehicle aerodynam- 
ics and Neptune's atmosphere. A Monte Carlo executive script created simulation input files with generated pertur- 
bations and coordinated simultaneous execution of the simulations on multiple processors across multiple com- 
puters. Various post processing scripts were used to determine the statistical parameters for the 2000 simulations in 
each Monte Carlo analysis and to generate plots. 

The Monte Carlo analyses consisted of a reference case and three sensitivity cose studies. In the reference case, 
delivery, atmospheric and aerodynamic uncertainties were based on state of the an navigation, current knowledge of 
Neptune atmosphere and computational fluid dynamics analyses respectively. Table 2 lists the uncertainties and dis- 
tribution types used in the Monte Carlo reference case. In the lust sensitivity case study, the magnitudes of the high 
frequency random density perturbations were reduced by 50' . In the second sensitivity study, the latitudinal varia- 
tion of Fminmax was removed and the uncertainty in mean density Increased. In the third sensitivity study, alpha 
modulation was added lo the reference bank modulation approach. The Monte Carlo analyses performed are summa- 
rized in Table 3.

RESULTS 



REFERENCE CASE 

In ihc reference cose, the reference set of uncertain- 
lies were used in ihc Monte Carlo analyses. Figure 8 
shows the reference case atmospheric density variation 
in the acrocapture altitudes .is a ratio of perturbed den- 
sity ta nominal density. The reference case density var- 
ies up to a factor of 2.25. 

The guidance compensates for these variations as 
well as delivery, aerodynamic, and C.G. variations by 
using the spacecraft's available control authority. Dis- 
persions in apoapsis altitude at atmospheric exit result 
when the spacecraft's control authority is insufficient to 
compensate for the variations. Figure 9 shows the refer- 
ence case dispersion in apoapsis and periapsis altitude 
and Fig. 10 shows a histogram of exit apoapsis altitude. 

For ihc reference uncertainties. 100% of the cases 
successfully captured and 66.1% of ihc cases were 
within the desired science arhil apoapsis bounds. The 
dispersion in apoapsis altitude between the 0.13 percen- 
tile and 99.87 percentile was 46 1 .4E-03 km The apoap- 
sis percentiles ore summarized in Table 4.

performance and robustness metrics. The 99.87 percen- 
tile AV was used rather than a 3r> value since the AV dis- 
trihuhon was skewed. The skewing is a result of AV be- 
ing required for pcriapsis raise in all cases regardless of 
whether or not the target apoapsis is met. Any crrur In 
apoapsis only results in increased AV. Table 5 summa-

RKDCCED ATMOSPHERIC HIGH FREQUENCY 
DENSITY PERTURBATIONS 

In the reduced high frequency density perturbation 
sensitivity study, the magnitude of atmospheric high fre- 
quency perturbations were reduced 50% using the 
GRAM perturbation multiplier rpscalc. The reduction 
may be possible with improved knowledge of Neptune's 
atmosphere. A half scale density perturbation near the 
penapsis of a selected aeropass is shown relative to full 
scale In Fig. 12. Note that a random perturbation is 
equally likely to be below the mean density as above It.

produces ihc maximum uncertainly in moan density I'rom

max is 33% larger ihan ihc Fminmax range of the refer-

eapiure altitudes. In the altitude range of 125 km to 300 
km where the majority of hyperbolic approach velocity 
is dissipated, ihc density variations above the nominal 
are approximately 25% larger lhan the reference atmos- 
phere while density variations below Ihc nominal are ap- 
proximately 50% larger reductions. 

The larger reduction in atmospheric density impacts 
ihc guidance's ability to target ihc apoapsis. For cases in 
which ihc density decreases, the spacecraft docs not have 
ihc control authority to overcome die ccniripcdal accel- 
eration and descend into more dense atmospheric re- 
gions. As a result it cxils with on apoapsis above ihc 
bounds. The dispersion in apoapsis and pcriapsis altitude 
is shown in Fig. 1 7. Figure I R shows a histogram of exit 
apoapsis altitude. 

For an atmosphere with increased uncertainties in 
mean density, 100% of the coses successfully captured 
and 76.3% of the coses were within the apoapsis bounds. 
The dispersion in apoapsis altitude increased 4°8.7E-H)3

ALPHA MODULATED GUIDANCE 

In the alpha modulated guidance sensitivity study, a 
guidance algorithm with angle of attack modulation in 
addition to bank modulation was used. The reference 
atmospheric uncertainty assumptions were used with the 
alpha modulated guidance case. The alpha modulated

CONCLUSION 

The performance analysis has shown that for the current Neptune atmospheric model, the 0.806 L'D flaibottom 
cllipslcd spacecraft is a viable design that captures 100% of the cases and has a 99.87 probability of successfully in- 
serting the orbitcr into its science orbit with a 360 nv's W budget for pcriapsis raise and apoapsis adjustment. 

The analysis has also shown that the design is viable for atmospheric models with different variability assump- 
tions. For an atmosphere with Fminmax uncertainties 33% larger than that of the reference atmospheric model, the 
spacceralt can attain the science orbit with a 99.87 probability given a 456 m's AV budget for pcriapsis and apoapsis 
adjustment. If a better understanding of Neptune's atmosphere leads to a 50% reduction in high frequency density 
perturbation magnitude, the science obit can be attained with a 99.87 probability given a 271 m's AV budget for 
pcriapsis and apoapsis adjustment. The analysis has also shown that with a combined angle of attack and bank angle 
modulation the spacecraft can attain the science orbit with a 99.87 probability given a 1 86 nv's AV budget for pcri- 
apsis and apoapsis adjustment.

INTRODUCTION 

The objective of the Neptune mission is to explore Neptune and one of its moons. Triton, In similar fashion In the 
Cass ini-Huy gens Mission. In addition to performing atmospheric observations and detailed gravity and 
magnetic Held determination via two atmospheric entry probes and one orbiting vehicle, ihc final orbit of the vcliiclc 
is placed In a nominal 3.8% x 430,(100 km oibit about die planet In order lo allow observations of Triton, one of the 
moons of Neptune. Acrncapiure Is an cflicicnt way to provide die energy dissipation from a high energy approach 
trajectory needed to enter into a law energy orbit about a planet during one pass through a planet's atmosphere. 
After die pass tiirough ihc atmosphere, only a relatively small propulsive maneuver is required lo place the 
spacecraft into the desired final orbit. 

Aerocapture is considered enabling for this Neptune mission and provides significant reduction in mass or trip 
time for odicr planclary destinations" . This technique allows a spacecraft lo capture into a desired orbit about a 
given body at significantly lower AV cost and thus provides an overall mass and cost savings to the mission. The 
Hybrid Predictor-corrector Aerocapture Scheme (HYPAS)' is a candidate for ihc aerocapture guidance algorithm 
This algorithm has been analyzed extensively for aerocapture missions at Earth, Mars, and Titan, however 
aerocapture for this Neptune mission has challenges 



not encountered in previous aerocapture assessments. 
This paper addresses the challenges associated with 
the aerocapture mission at Neptune and defines the 
performance of the algorithm, including its sensitivity 
to perturbations In aerodynamics, atmospheric density, 
and the arrival stale vector. 

In die reference mission, the vehicle enters ihc 
atmosphere at an altitude of 1.000 km with on menial 
velocity of 29.0 km s. The vehicle uses a blunt body 
flat bottom clllpslcd acroshcll . sec Figure I , with a 
ballistic number (nVC ( ,A> of 895 kg in*, and a hfi-lo- 
drag ratio (L/Dl of 0.8. The aerocapture guidance 
algorithm targets the vehicle lo a desirable 
atmospheric cxll state vector that allows ll lo reach ihc 
targeted 430.000 km apoapsis.

NEPTUNE AEROl.U'H RE CHALLENGES 

The nature of die Neptune mission presents a set of 
new challenges to the guidance system. The low-thrust 
Solar Electric Power (SEP) trajectory brings die vehicle 
after a 10.25 year transit time lo an entry velocity of 29.0 
kin s: compared lo typical missions to inner planets that 
present an entry velocity of approximately 1 1 .0 kin's or 
lower, and earth return from planetary missions titat may 
reach 13 kni's for a return from Mars. This high entry 
velocity associated with the Neptune mission causes the 
vehicle to experience large aerodynamic and 
thermodynamic loads that constrain the entry corridor. 

The second challenge results from the high value of 
M/ClA for die given vehicle design. Previous 
aerocapture missions used vehicles with M.'CiA of 400 
kgi'm' to 700 kg'm*. Mass and packaging considerations 
far die Neptune mission result in a M ( . A of more dian 
I. IO0 kg'm" M/ClA is an inverse measure of control 
authority for altitude acceleration that is essential for 
efficient control of die drag acceleration profile. .As can

as the counterpart with a lower ballistic number. This 
lack of control authority, will thus force the guidance 
system tit seek a higher dynamic pressure, and thus 
force the vehicle into a sleeper trajectory. While the 
sleeper trajectory aids the guidance control, it also 
increases the thermodynamic loads on the vehicle, and 
is ill lis undesirable.

Figures 4-7. Sensitivity to Atmospheric Exit Conditions

The third new challenge results from the high energy final target orbit of 3.896 x 430.000 km that requires an 
exit velocity near 22.5 kms or about 97% of the Neptune escape speed. Figure 3 shows typical cxit-lo-cscapc 
velocity ratios for missions using acrocapturc at other destinations with atmospheric exit at near orbital speed or 
about 71% of escape speed. The very high exit speed for this Neptune mission results in a large sensitivity of the 
post acrocapturc orbit to the atmospheric exit conditions. This is illustrated in Figures 4-7, which show the effects of 
exit velocity error and exit (light path angle on apoapsis altitude as a function of the target apoapsis altitude for two 
different ranges of apoapsis altitudes that correspond to low and high energy planetary orbits. While the sensitivity 
to exit flight path angle is slightly larger for the 2.000 km target apoapsis altitude, a I iiv's error in exit velocity 
yields a 745 km error in apoapsis altitude for the 430.000 km target versus a 4 km error for the 2000 km target, 
about two orders of magnitude larger. 

DESCRIPTION OF TRAJECTORY SIMULATION 

The Simulation and Optimization of Rocket Trajectories (SORT)" program was used to perform the numerical 
trajectory simulation. SORT is a multi-purpose computer program that uses three dcgrccs-of-frccdom to simulate the 
translation flight dynamics of an arbitrary aerospace vehicle about a given central body with phase plane logic to 
simulate the bank dynamics. The vehicle is assumed to be in an acrodynainically trimmed attitude. The simulation 
interface allows the user to easily adjust vehicle parameters, planet geometry, gravity model, and atmospheric 
model. 

For the Neptune acrocapturc trajectory simulation, the planet and gravity model used arc based on a spherical 
body of radius 24,764 km with an inverse square gravity field with a gravitational parameter of 6.87 1 3x 10* krnVs 2 . 
The atmosphere model used for the trajectory simulation is the Neptune Global Reference Atmosphere Model 
(ORAM) 1 . Atmospheric density is computed as a function of altitude, and the engineering model allows a variation 
of the density profile between a minimum and maximum expected value that is includes the effects of latitude, 
seasonal, and diurnal effects. The parameter in the model that allows for this control (FMINMAXi can be varied 
continuously between -1.0 and -1.0. corresponding to the minimum and maximum expected mean density, 
respectively. A value of 0.0 produces a nominal density profile. The Neptune ORAM also has the capability to 
superimpose random density perturbations on the selected profile to model the relatively high frequency density 
gradients resulting from gravity waves. The simulation tool uses a Sutton-Graves stagnation point convective heat 
rate equation, 

<2) 



where q is the heating rate. V is the atmospheric relative velocity, p is the atmospheric density. Rs is the 

vehicle's nose radius, and t is the Sutton-Graves constant, which for Neptune is 6.96x10 kg m. 

The atmospheric entry conditions were taken from the proposed Nepiunc Tnton Exploration Mission 1 . This 
mission results in an incrtial entry velocity of 29 law's at 1000 km altitude. 

The Neptune entry vehicle uses bank angle to control the in-plane dynamics and bank reversal to control the 
trajectory inclination. This Neptune acrocapturc assessment used the Hybrid Predictor-corrector Acrocapturc 
Scheme (HYPAS) algorithm to develop the bank angle magnitude and bank reversal commands. This guidance 
algorithm was originally developed at the Johnson Space Center in mid I ''SO', as the guidance algorithm for the 
Acroassist Flight Experiment I Aim This analytically derived guidance algorithm uses drag based deceleration and 
altitude rate errors as feedback terms in the closed loop guidance operation. The algorithm has been extensively used 
in various different simulation studies of acrocapturc into low energy planetary orbits, with a range of different 
initial state vectors, vehicle ballistic numbers, and lirl-to-drag ratios, as well as multiple destinations, such as Earth. 
Mars, and Titan''. Guidance initialization constants and the feedback gains arc used to control the profile shape and 
responsiveness to perturbations to achieve the desired dynamic pressure, heat rate, deceleration, and the total 
theoretical corridor capture. 

The HYPAS guidance algorithm is divided into two flight phases, an equilibrium glide, and an exit phase. In the 
first phase, the algorithm generates bank angle commands to drive the vehicle towards a balance of lift, gravity, and 
centripetal forces, or equilibrium glide conditions to assure capture and control levels of loads. Once the vehicle has 
decelerated to a specified velocity, the exit phase is initiated. In this phase, the guidance computes a predicted 
velocity vector at atmospheric exit altitude, based on analytically derived equations. The bank angle Is commanded 
to adjust the exit state so that the vehicle can achieve the desired target apoapsis. The robustness of the algorithm 




101 



stems from the ability to individually tunc the initialization parameters for both phases, allowing tor a controlled and 
stable capture, and inaxiinum performance during exit 

PERFORMANCE FOR NEPTUNE AEROCAPTURE 

The first step in the performance analysis of the guidance system involves determination of the theoretical entry 
■light path angle corridor. This corridor is used to define the limits on the arrival flight path angle as well as to 
define the nominal, or target, entry flight path angle. An optimum acrocapture (light profile is developed tor this 
entry corridor. Development of this profile is a multi-step process of defining the acrocapture guidance initialization 
parameters and testing the effect on variations to entry (light path angle, aerodynamic coefficients, and atmospheric 
density throughout the entry corridor. The final step in the analysis is a Monte Carlo simulation: to assess the overall 
performance of the guidance algorithm under expected random flight conditions. 

THEORETICAL ENTRY CORRIDOR 

Defining the theoretical entry corridor allows for a definition of the desired nominal entry (light path angle as 
well as the limitations on navigation errors of delivery. The steep side of the corridor is defined as the steepest entry 
flight path angle which allows the vehicle to just reach the target apoapsis while flying lilt vector up over the entire 
duration of the flight. The shallow side of the corridor is defined as the shallowest entry flight path angle which 
allows the vehicle to just reach the target apoapsis while flying lit) vector down over the entire duration of the flight. 

For this assessment, the theoretical entry flight path 
angle corridor was determined by using the Neptune 
GRAM with the nominal, minimum, and maximum 
atmospheric density profiles to account tor the 
uncertainty in the density profile (see Table I). A 
combined corridor was developed that includes the 
effects of atmospheric density variations and this results 
in an entry corridor of 1.78 dcg. This corridor is 
sufficiently large enough to accommodate the expected 
dclivcr>' errors. The nominal entry flight path angle was 
chosen to be -12.77 dcg. the middle of this combined 
theoretical corridor.

Table 1. Theoretical Entry Flight Path Angle 



AEROCAPTURE PLIGHT PROFILE 

Once the theoretical entry corridor is defined, an optimum performance tor the guidance algorithm can be 
determined. By having the vehicle fly full lift up as it enters the atmosphere and then command the vehicle to bank 
to a full lift down attitude at the correct instant in order to achieve the precise target apoapsis altitude, a maximum 
pcriapsis altitude is achieved. Maximizing the pcriapsis altitude thus minimizes the post-acrocapture AV required to 
place the vehicle into the desired target orbit. For each given entry flight path angle, an exact point to switch from 
lift up to lit) down can be identified. The closer the vehicle is to the shallow side of the corridor, the closer the 
switch time is to the entry condition. For an entry at the opposite (steep) side of the corridor, no switch is performed, 
allowing the vehicle to fly full lift up through the entire flight. The theoretical optimum performance is not a 
practical method of guiding the vehicle through the flight, however it provides valuable information on how the 
actual flight algorithm compares to a theoretical optimum performance. 

The nominal guidance performance was achieved by adjusting the algorithm initialization parameters for the 
reference mission. Trajectory simulations with HYPAS show that the algorithm performs well under the given 
conditions. Important to note however is that for the nominal entry flight path angle (center of corridor) there arc 
periods during the flight in which the bank angle is saturated, full lift up or down. This is attributed to the high 
ballistic number and high M.'ClA of the vehicle. The lack of control authority of the vehicle drives the guidance to 
initially fly a very steep profile in order to achieve a high dynamic pressure and thus attain the desired control. Then 
the vehicle must fly full lift up to maintain an equilibrium glide condition and initiate the exit. When the algorithm 
was tuned in such a manner to minimize this saturation period, the large random density perturbations overwhelmed 
the system and causes larger then desired error in apoapsis targeting because the system would not respond 
aggressively enough. The nominal profile can be seen in Figures 8-13.

AEROCAPTliRE GUIDANCE PERFORMANCE 

The aciucaplurc guidance performance was ci aluatcd througliout Uic entry corridor for nominal and dispersed 
atmospheres and aerodynamic characteristics. This performance is illustrated in Figure 14 for nominal flight 
conditions and in figures 15 and 16 for dispersed atmospheres and aerodynamic characteristics. Figure 14 shows 
apoapsis altitude ihroughoul ihc entry corridor and snows that the guidance performs well and captures Q-3% of the 
corridor, as defined by the 390,000 and 490,000 km apoapsis altitude band. It is important to note that 100% of the 
eases remained captured into oihit. The results were generated using the nominal mean atmospheric profile 
(FMJNMAX of 0.0), and no random density perturbations were used. 

The sensitivity of the HYP AS algorithm to uncertainties 
in atmospheric conditions and aerodynamic coefficients is 
illustrated in Figures 15 and 16. Tbc algorithm was 
subjected to ihc limits of the expected atmospheric model, 
the minimum and maximum profile. Figure 15 shows that ihc 
guidance handles the maximum profile in a good fashion, 
only losing slight corridor width on the steep side. 
Conversely under the minimum atmospheric profile ihc 
system the guidance is unable to accommodate the shallower 
angles. Since the atmosphere has a lower density, it 
effectively shifis the corridor towards steeper entry angles. 
Note that in this figure, the shallowest angle, corresponding 
10-11.9 deg, results In an atmospheric skip, or a negative 
apoapsis alutude. due to the hyperbolic nature of the orbil 

To simulate possible aerodynamic errors, a ±10 percent 
variation in lift and drag coefficient was implemented and 
individually evaluated to assess the extreme response of ihc

AN(.LE OF ATTACK MODULATION 

Anglc-of-attack modulation is used by die Space Shuttle Orbitct entry guidance " lo impruvc the performance 
compared lo control with only bank angle modulation. This results in a rapid response to trajectory perturbations by 
directly changing the area exposed to die flow and thus the drag. The original derivation of IOTAS includes only 
hank angle modulation, which by moving the llfl vector afTecls die altitude rate of die vehicle and controls the 
density environment of flight. This then can be translated to drag deceleration modulation. The new set of 
difficulties encountered in the Neptune mission, lead to a desire for unproved control In order to improve the final 
orbit upoopsis targeting. 

The HYPAS algorithm was modified, as shown In equations (3) through |6) to incorporate anglc-of attack 
modulation. The approach taken here is derived from that used for angle of attack modulation on the Space Shuttle. 
The Aii formulation is used to command a change In anglc-of-attack relative lo the current anglc-of-attack The 
variation in anglc-of-attack from die nominal profile is limited to a specific value, here tested at 3, S, and 10 deg to 
limit die effects on aerodynamic heating.

Various ranges nl* angle of attack modulation limit were initially investigated as an option to improving the 
performan.v In die Monte Carlo performance analysis iFigurcs 17-24). it tan be seen that an angle modulation of 
±5 degree can provide significant improvements in the precision of the algorithm. The in-plane AV to maneuver ihe 
vehicle into the target orbit is also shown. This analysis was conducted as a preliminary assessment. The actual 
implementation method for angle of attack modulation, such as body flaps, jets, or CO shift, was not investigated, 
and should be included in further analysis. The addition of angle attack modulation, though increasing the 
complexity of the system has potential propcllant mass savings. Using the 3a AV value for no angle of attack 
modulation of 37R.7 m.. an initial vehicle mass of 2200. kg, and assuming a typical bipropcllant Isp of 320 sec, 
yields a propcllant mass of approximately 250 kg. In contrast, using the 3a AV value for 1 10 deg angle of attack 
modulation of 176.5 ms, yields a propcllant mass of approximately 120 kg, more Uicn 50% savings in mass.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

The HYP AS guidance algorithm performance for a Neptune aerucapture mission has been investigated- The 
investigation included development of a nominal guided flight pmlilc. determination of the amount of the Uieoretical 
entry corridor captured with die algorithm, and algorithm performance under pcrtuibations in aerodynamics, 
atmosphere density, and entry state vector using Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that the algorithm 
performance meets the given propulsive AV allotment and satisfies the reference mission requirements. Detailed 
aerocapiurc orbit insertion performance for die Neptune Triton Exploration mission can be found in Reference 1 1 . 

It was found that mission parameter values unique lo die Neptune aerucapture mission investigated here, 
specifically, the combination of high vehicle ballistic coefficient, high entry velocity, and high energy target orbit, 
posed dilticullics that have not been experienced in previous assessments of aerocapture guidance algorithm 
performance. The net effect of the extreme values of dicsc parameters is a decrease in the accuracy of achieving the 



105 



largci apoapsis with actocapiurc using bank angle control only, iluis icsuliing in a larger than expected post- 
acrocapturc propulsive maneuver. Angle of attack modulation has been incorporated into the HYPAS algorithm to 
address this issue. Monte Carlo trajectory simulations show that with angle of attack modulation, the accuracy for 
the given Neptune mission is significantly improved, resulting in a decrease in the propulsive AV requirements and 
reduction in risk of the actocapiurc maneuver. 

The difficulties encountered in the guidance design for the stressful conditions of the Neptune mission highlights 
the need to further investigate future changes to the algorithm for this application. This includes an improved 
reference drag profile to more closely match the llight profile and further investigation of angle of attack control. 
Further iterations of tuning can also yield an improved bank angle profile, with less control saturation.

Connective and radiative heating environments have been computed for a three-dimensional 
cllipsled configuration which would perform an acrocapturc maneuver at Neptune. This work was 
performed as part of a one-year Neptune acrocapturc spacecraft systems studv that also included 
analyses of trajectories, atmospheric modeling, aerodynamics, structural design, and other 
disciplines. Complementary heating analyses were conducted by separate teams using independent 
sets of aerothcrmodv namic modeling tools (i.e. Navicr-Stokes and radiation transport codes). 
Environments were generated for a large 5.50 m length cllipsled and a small 2.88 m length cllipsled. 
Radiative heating was found to contribute up to 80Ci of the total heating rate at the cllipsled nose 
depending on the trajectory point. Good agreement between convectivc heating predictions from the 
two Navier-Stokes solvers was obtained. However, the radiation analysis revealed several 
uncertainties in the computational models employed in both sets of codes, as well as large differences 
between the predicted radiative heating rates.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 

A one year, multi-disciplinary study of 
a mission to Neptune in which acrocapturc 
would be used to decelerate into orbit has been 
conducted. Computational analyses of the 
convectivc and radiative acrohcating 
environments which the vehicle would 
experience arc detailed herein, and results from 
other disciplines arc presented in several 
companion papers'

NEPTUNE AEROCAPTURE MISSION 
CONCEPT 

In an acrocapturc mission, atmospheric drag 
is employed in place of a conventional 
propulsion system to decelerate the vehicle into 
orbit (Fig. I). Acrocapturc can result in large 
mass savings in comparison to propulsive 
deceleration. For this study a reference mission 
concept 1 was developed Ibra 2017 launch with j 
10 year transit to Neptune of an orbitcr designed 
tor a scientific investigation of Neptune and its 
moon Triton. For the reference mission 
guidelines, it was determined that the mass

cross-section of ihc vehicle. 
The dimensions shown in Fig. 2 define die 
geometry of a 5 JO m long vehicle which was ihc 
focus of ihc first phase of this study. Results 
from this phase of ihc study were used to 
conduct a design iteration, which resulted in a 
new. smaller vehicle. This second geometry was 
a scaling of 52.36% from die original design 
winch produced a 2.88 m long vehicle. 



VEHICLE TRAJECTORIES 

Atmospheric trajectories for both vehicles 
were genera led' using die Program for 
Optimization of Simulated Trajectories'' with a 
Neptune atmospheric model'. For the large 
vehicle, a ballistic coefficient ((SI of 400 kg'm* 
was used, while for the smaller vehicle a ballistic 
coefficient of 895 kg'm' was used. Reference 
convcctivc heating rales were computed along 
these trajectories for a 1.00 m hemisphere using 
a Sutton -Graves ' formulation. Several thousand 
trajectories were simulated, from which worst- 
cases for convcciivc heat loads and heat rales 
were identified. These trajectories arc shown in 
Figs. 3 and 4. For the original large vehicle, 
acrohcaling predictions were generated at live 
noinis (Including peak heating) along ihc max 
hcat-i.jt- trajectory, while for the final smaller 
vehicle heating rates were computed at the peak 
heating point along the max heat-rate trajectory 
and at seven points along the max heat-load 
trajectory. These heating predictions were then 
used to develop die acrohcaling environments 
required lo design a Thermal Protection System 
tTPS i for ihc vehicle. Free stream conditions for 
ihesc points arc given in Tables I and

VEHICLE CONFIGURATION

conducted to define the shape of the vehicle's 
aeroshell. The design objectives were to achieve

COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS 

Conveciivc-radiativc healing 

environments were generated by I wo 
independent teams using separate How field and 
radiation transport codes. Comparisons of 
results from the two analyses were performed for 
each set of trajectory computations In order to 
verify the results and identify sources of 
uncertainly. 

Within the context of this one-year study, the 
focus of the work was on the generation of 
environments for the system study rather than 
computational tool development However, 
computation of the Neptune ocrocapturc 
environment posed several challenges which will 
be discussed in later sections, and further 
research into computational tools and models for 
the Neptune missions will be required to address 
these issues. 

FLOW HELD SOLVERS 

Flow* field solutions were generated using 
the LAURA (Langlcy Acrothcrmodynamic 
Upwind Relaxation Algorithm)*'' and DPLR 1 " 
(Data Parallel Line Relaxation) codes. Both 
codes arc three-dimensional, structured, finite- 
volume Navicr-Stokcs solvers and support 
multiple-block computations on distributed 



nudes using the Message Passing IntafiOE 
(MPII- Inviscid fluxes are computed in LAURA 
using the Roc flux splitting' method with 
Hartcn's entropy fix'" and Ycc's symmetric 
total -variation diminishing limiting , while a 
modified Stcgct- Warming flux vector splitting 
with MUSCL extrapolation to third order with a 
minniod limitcr is Implemented in DPLR. Pre- 
vious studies have shown that both codes 
produce similar results when the same kinetic 
and transport properties models arc implemented 
in each code I e.g. Rcfs. 16-17). 
A 13-spccics (H ; , H, H+. He, He* CtL, CH-, 
CH>, CH, d, C, C+, e-> Neptune atmospheric 
model was employed for flow field computations 
with default free stream mass fractions of 0.6246 
for Hj. 0.2909 for He. and 0.0S46 for CH,. A 
simpler S-spcclcs model (H;. H, H-, He. c-> with 
irccstrcam mass fractions of 0.66X for !!• and 
0.332 for He was also employed for some 
numerical studies. Two reaction sets were used: 
die first was taken (rum Nelson (with the 
addition of certain reactions from Park and 
Lcibovvh? \, in the second set, hydrogen and 
helium dissociation and ionization reactions were 
replaced with those from Lcibowu/" Equations 
for the forward reaction rates for both sets arc 
listed in Tables 3 and A. Reverse rates were 
computed from the definition of the equilibrium 
constant, which was determined by evaluating 
the Oibbs free energy* from thermodynamic data 
supplied by McBndc 11 . 

A radiative wall equilibrium temperature 
boundary condition with a surface cmissivity of 
0.90 was imposed at the surface. "Super- 
catalytic" behavior (recombination to free stream 
ma-- fractions) was imposed to provide 
conservative heating estimates. 



RADIATION TRANSPORT CODES 

Uncoupled radiative transport 

computations were performed using the Dow 
field solutions as input data. An updated version 
of the RADEQU1L code""' was used to process 
LAURA inputs and the NEQAIR96"" 1 code was 
used to process DPLR inputs. 
RADEQUIL and NEQAIR96 arc both used to 
calculate radiative emission and absorption from 
input flow field properties with the one- 
dimensional tan u cm- slab approximation in 
which it is assumed that radiation transport takes 
place only in the direction perpendicular to the 
surface. The populations of the excited states of 
the various species arc assumed to follow 
Bolttmann distributions. In RADEQUIL. a line 
group approximation is used to model atomic 



101 



line transitions and a smeared barn! 
approximation U used to model molecular 
transitions, whereas in KEQAIRW. line-by-line 
compulations arc performed for all atomic and 
molecular transitions. In this study, transitions 
in hydrogen atoms due to excitation, bound-froc 
photo- ionization, and tree-free transition were 
considered In both codes. Molecular transitions 
of H; were also included in the RADEQUIL 
analysis. The transitions occurring in C, C+, and 
C> were modeled, but were found to have 
negligible contributions due to the low 
concentrations of these species.

UNCERTAINTIES IN FLOW FIELD AND 
RADIATION TRANSPORT METHODS 

Analysis of heating results and comparisons 
between the different flow field and radiation 
transport codes revealed several areas in which 
large uncertainties exist in the modeling of the 
higb-encrgy acrocopturc pass through Neptune's 
atmosphere. Each of Uicse areas will be 
discussed in tin- following subsections. In some 
cases differences were explored using a 0.3 m 
radius hemisphere geometry (the approximate 
nose radius of the large cllipsled) in place of the 
complex, llirec-dimcnsional cllipsled geometry - , 
along with the simpler 1 1 -He atmosphere. 
Fli w Field Cnde-io Code Comimiitoits 

Code-to-codc comparisons between 
LAURA and DPLR of connective healing rates 
resulted in agreement to within ±10% or less, as 
shown by sample comparisons in Fig. 8 for the 
large cllipsled and Fig. 9 for the small cllipsled. 
As a result, where couvcctivc heating rates for 
the cllipsled arc shown throughout this paper, 
they arc usually not identified as resulting from 
cither code because the differences were 
generally very small- However, as will be shown 
subsequently, differences in kinetic models 
initially implemented in the two codes which had 
little influence on convcctivc heating rates had 
large effects on radiation computations. 
Vlbtutiimat Nonequilb'mtmt 

Stability problems were encountered using 
both LAURA and DPLR to compute the 
cllipsled How fields in the H:-Hc-CH. Neptune 
atmosphere. These problems were traced back to 
■lie modeling of vibrational non-equilibrium. 
For the trajectories under consideration, 
dissociation of the molecular species |Hj. CHj. 
CHi. CH.>. CH. C : ) behind the shock was very 
rapid. This dissociation left very small 
concentrations of molecules for which 
vibrational equilibrium could be defined except 
in narrow regions at the shock and wall, which 
made the computational problem very stiff. 
Examples of this rapid dissociation arc given by 
stagnation -line temperatures and H; mole 
fractions plotted in Fig. 10 for the l)J m 
hemisphere geometry at the peak heating points 
on the max heat load aivd max heal rale, fl = 845

An additional unccitainty in vibrational non- 
equilibrium compulations is the use of Park's 
two-tempcrature (TT V | model" 1 . This model was 
developed for use in air, where the primary 
diatomic species. N; and (>.. have similar 
vibrational characteristics. The applicability of 
tins model to the Neptune environment is 
unpruven. 

Tbe How field was found to be very nearly 
in vibrational equilibrium for points along the 
lower-altitude, max heat-rales trajectories, while 
vibrational non-equilibrium was preseni lot 
points along the higher-altitude, max heat-load 
trajectories. In order to avoid the stability 
problems which occurred wben vibrational non- 
equilibrium was allowed, all small ellipslcd 
cases were computed wilh vibrational equilib- 
rium. This approximation had no appreciable 
affect on con vec live heating rates, but was 
recognized as a conservative assumption in the 
compulation of radiative healing rates. The 
conservatism results from the fact ihc 
equilibrium temperatures used tu evaluate 
radiation transport were considerably higher near 
the shock than the vibrational temperatures 
which would have been used if vibrational non- 
equilibrium was allowed. These leniperaturc 
differences arc illustrated for Ihc 03 m 
hemisphere geometry (Hj-Hc mixture! in Fig. 
II. 

As on example of the differences resulting 
from the vibrational equilibrium assumption, the 
stagnation-point radiative heating levels 
computed using RADEQU1L wilh inputs from 
LAURA for the four coses shown in Fig. 1 1 
were:

Peak convcclivc heat-rate trajectory II - IH4 *). 
q^ - SI 92 W.'enT, vibraUunal non -equilibrium 
i±._ : - 7433 V ,in". vibrational equilibrium 
As shown by ihc above values, ihc 
vibrational equilibrium assumption docs 
reasonably well (for radiation calculations) at 
approximating the radiative heating rates for 
cases near equilibrium, but for cases in non- 
equilibrium. this assumption produces extremely 
conservative results. 

The dilfcrenccs in radiative heating levels 
fur the peak heat- load cases were clearly 
unacceptable: however, the numerical stability 
problems discussed previously prevented non- 
equilibrium solutions from being computed on 



the ellipslcd geometry in a timely manner. 
There fure. an approximate correction in ihc 
equilibrium radiative heating results was made to 
obtain nrdcr-of- magnitude estimates for non- 
equilibrium levels. It was found that radiative 
heating levels approximaling those obtained 
Irom non-equilibrium flow field computations 
could be obtained from equilibrium flow field 
computations if the H. molecular transition 
contributions were neglected. The rationale for 
tills approximation was dial H; produced ihc 
majority of the total radiation In the peak-load 
trajectory cases with equilibrium modeling, but 
with non-equilibrium modeling, the H> would 
have been radiating at a much lower temperature. 
Thus, subtracting the H? contribution from the 
equilibrium total radiative beating rate resulted 
In radiative heating estimates of the same older 
of magnitude as non-equilibrium predictions.

As How field codc-tn-codc comparisons 
revealed only minor difference* (when the same 
kinetic models were employed I. the differences 
in radiative heating levels were attributed almost 
entirely to the radiation transport salvers. These 
differences remained unresolved within the time- 
frame of this study, but several different 
assumptions in the radiation transport models uf 
the two codes were noted: RADLQUIL includes 
more H atomic line transitions (Lyman-ri,[ky,d.£

NEQAIR% (Lyman-o.|t.v Balmcr-a.|t.yl; 
NEQA1R9K includes linc-by-linc calculations nf

RADEQUIL includes more hound- free photo- 
ionizalion transitions (Lyman. Balmcr. Paschcn. 
Bracket! and approximate integration thereafter 
to 'I than NEQAIR96lLyman and Balmcr). 

CHEMICAL KINETICS 

Comparisons of compulations for the large 
ellipslcd showed that the two How field solvers 
produced different results for shock stand-off 
distances and post-shock temperatures. While 
these differences had very little eft'ect on the 
convcctivc healing levels, they did lead to 
different predictions far radiative healing levels. 
Il was determined that ihc differences were due 
to ihc use of ihc Nelson kinetics in the LAURA 
compulations and the Lei bo wit? kinetics in 
DPLR. These differences arc illustrated in Figs. 
12-13. The results shown arc for ihc 0.3 m 
hemisphere using LAURA with both the Nelson 
or Lcibowitz kinetics and an H;-Hc mixture. In 
Fig. 12, the stagnation line temperatures urc 
shown along with the mole fraction of ionized 
hydrogen, ihc ionization rate of which was ihc 
main reason for ihc different temperatures 



predicted using the iwo kinetic models. As 
shown in Fig. 13. the different models led to 
only about a HOVn difference in cunvcctivc 
heating. While the accuracy of both models for 
Neptune Dow fields needs to be further explored, 
the Lcibowitz kinetics led to much higher 
radiative heating predictions. Therefore, this 
more conservative model was employed in both 
codes for subsequent compulations on the small 
ellipslcd

In this study, radiation and How Held 
computations were uncoupled. However, 
previous studies (e.g. 26) have shown thai 
coupling of compulations Heeding the radiation 
transport results back into the flow field code} 
can result in significant reductions to the 
predicted radiative healing levels through non- 
adiabatic radiative cooling of the flow field. The 
current uncoupled approach is thus recognized to 
yield conservative results.

IPS DEVELOPMENT 
Approximate healing rale and integrated 
heal- load environment* were generated from 
these results for use in TPS material selection 
and thickness sizing. The con vec live and 
radiative rates from the computations were used 
as anchor points from which to scale the heating 
time-history outputs from POST for a l-m 
hemisphere to the clhpslcd geometry. Three 
environments were generated: a "Low" 
environment based on the convcctivc heating 
plus one-half of the radiative heating rate to 
account for radiative cooling effects, a 
"Reference" environment based on the total 
(convcctivc plus radiative) heating rates 
generated herein, and a "High - environment 
based on twice the total heating rates to account 
for turbulent heating augmentation. TI'S 
development based on these environments is dis- 
cussed in the companion paper by Laub . 

SUMMARY 

Preliminary convcctivc and radiative heating 
environments for a Neptune aerocapturc mission 
have been computed. Environments were 
generated both for a large 5.50 in cllipslcd and a 
small 2.88 m cllipslcd. Radiative heating 
constituted up to SO", of the total heating along 
the trajectories studied. 

Because of the expected computational 
difficulties for this high -velocity aerocapturc 
mission in Neptune's H-IU-1H. atmosphere, 
heating environments were generated in tandem 
using LAURA with RADEQUIL and DPLR with 
NEQAIR96 to compute the flow field and 
radiation transport properties. This approach 
was designed to reduce uncertainties and to 
identity areas in which further research and 
development of numerical models and tools will 
be required in order to provide higher confidence 
in analyses for this class of mission. 

The computations were found to agree well 
for llow field properties and convcctivc heating 
distributions (when the same kinetic models 
were employed), but several sources of large 
uncertainty were identified in the computation of 
radiative heating. 

Kinetic modeling of reactions in the H.-Hc- 
CH, Neptune atmosphere was one of the 
problem areas identified. The use of different 
reaction sets cited in the literature produced large 
differences in post-shock stand-off distance and 



temperatures, which led to large differences in 
predicted radiative heating rates. 

Vibrational non-equilibrium modeling also 
presented difficulties. Numerical stability could 
not be achieved for several cases when a two- 
temperature, vibrational non-equilibrium model 
was employed. In order to resolve this issue, 
vibrational equilibrium was imposed, which was 
shown to lead to over-prediction of radiative 
heating levels. Furthermore, even if stability had 
been achieved, the use of a two-temperature 
model developed for Earth's N;-0; atmosphere 
is un proven in Neptune's Hj-Hc-Cl-U 
atmosphere. 

It was also found that large differences 
existed in radiative heating rates produced by the 
two radiation transport codes. While several 
differences in the physical models incorporated 
in these codes were identified, the specific 
reasons for these differences were not identified. 

Within the limits of this short-term study, 
preliminary convectivc-radiativc heating 
environments for thermal protection system 
sizing were generated which were sufficient to 
support a moderate- fidelity vehicle design for a 
Neptune aerocapturc mission. However, in order 
to complete a high-fidelity design, further devel- 
opment of computational tools and methods for 
the Neptune environment will be required.

TPS CHALLENGES FOR NEPTUNE AEROCAPMKE 



B. Laub & Y.K. Chen 
NASA Aincs Research Center. Moffctt Field, CA 94035 

A study to develop a conceptual design for an aerocapturc mission at Neptune was 
conducted by a NANA systems analysis team comprised of technical experts from several 
NASA centers. Multidiseiplinary analyses demonstrated that acrocapturc could he 
accomplished at Neptune with a rigid aeroshell with a flattened clllpsled geometry flying at a 
nominal anglc-of-allack of Ml degrees entering the Neptune atmosphere at an inertia! entry 
velocity of « Vi km/s. Acrolhcrmal analyses demonstrated that both the peak conveetive and 
radiative healing rates in the stagnation region are very severe. Furthermore, due to the 
duration of the acrocapturc trajectory, the total integrated heal loads are extremely large. 
TPS siring analyses were conducted for a limited range of candidate TPS materials since 
such high peak heal fluxes limit candidate materials to dense, carbonaceous ablators. On the 
windward side, in rcgioas away from the stagnation region, lower density ablators may 
suffice. Lou-density ablators also are viable candidates on the lee side. However, there arc 
significant uncertainties associated with the turbulent and radiative healing rates. TPS mass 
requirements for this mission are very large, and the ablator thickness requirements may be 
beyond current manufacturing capabilities.

accomplished with a rigid acrosticl! configured as a llattcncd cllipslcd mill a lill-lo-drag(L'D) rabo of = 0.80 and a 
ballistic coefficient (MCuA) of* 815 kg/m". The configuration is illustrated in Figure I.

A mission analysis study evaluated options to deliver an orhiicr and two probes to Neptune. It was concluded 
that chemical trajectories exist that can deliver the required mass for an orbitcr and two probes (- 2000 kg) using 
acroeapiure at Neptune but would require an Earth-Jupiter gravity-assist lEJGAl and Uic Delta IV H booster. EiGAs 
would necessitate an auxiliary chemical propulsion "stage" providing 0.5*5 Knv's post launch deep space maneuvers. 
This study also concluded that trajectories also exist that can deliver the required mass for an oibiler and two probes 
using solar electric propulsion (SEP) and aerocapturc. These options would use a Vcnus-Jupilcr gravity-assist 
(VJGA) and the Delta IV H. The incrtial entry velocity for these trajectories is around 28-30 kin's for 10*1 1 years 
flight lime. It was concluded that a reasonable mission design (in terms of maximizing delivered mass while 
minimuung trip time) could be accomplished with a launch on February 17. 2017 on a Delta IV II with a loud 
launch mass of 3298 kg dry (4735 kg wet). The mission would use a h-cnginc SEP system (30 kW. EOL) and a 
VJGA. This would be a 12.25 year Neptune Orbitcr Mission widi a IO_2S-ycar trip lime and 2 (or more) years in 
Neptune OtbiL The payload would include two identical probes and would use aerocapturc to establish a target orbit 
of 430,000 km x 3.986 km | which would enable Triton observations), with a 157.3 degree inclination, retrograde 



Thc atmosphere around Ncplunc is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium with small concentrations of 
methane and nitrogen. The nominal atmospheric composition is approximately 80% H-. 19% He. and 1% CH,. 
Justus ct al developed a model for the Neptune atmosphere iKcptunc-GRAM) based on data from Voyager and 
elsewhere. Allowing for measurement uncertainties and the expected latitudinal, allitudinal, seasonal and diurnal 
variations, the model accounts for a significant variation in atmospheric density with altitude, as shown in Figure 2.

Relatively large measurement uncertainties arc represented within a prescribed envelope af minimum-average- 
maximum density versus altitude. A single model Input parameter (Fminmax) allows users of Ncptunc-GRAM In 
select where within the muvmax envelope a particular simulation will fall- Fminmax = -1. 0. or I selects minimum, 
average, or maximum conditions, respectively, with intermediate values determined hy interpolation. The 
percentages shown at selected altitudes in Figure 2 indicate die range of density uncertainty between the minimum 
density model and the maximum density model In comparison to the average. 

An evaluation of the aerodynamic stability of the flattened ellipslcd was conducted- The aerodynamic database 
was developed from viscous LAURA CFD solutions. A preliminary stability analysis showed that die Hat-botlnm 
ellipslcd is longitudinally and laterally stable. An assessment of die aerodynamic uncertainties was based on a JSC 
ellipslcd analysis for Mors, consistent with the X-33 aerodynamic database uncertainty model (Ref. NASA II 1 - 
199K-206544). 



Using these results for vehicle aerodynamics, a Neptune acrocapturc simulation and Monte Carlo analysis 
approach' was developed. Three sets of uncertainties were Included in the Monte Carlo analysis: delivery errors in 
initial slates, atmospheric variability (mean range and perturbations) and several aerodynamic factors - C,\. C*. trim 
angle of attack (pitching momeni I, eg. uncertainty. Trie parameters are each randomly varied over a specified range 
and distribution. More than 2000 trajectory simulations are completed In one Monte Carlo analysis and the results 
are used for acrocapturc performance statistics to determine robustness, margin and risk, guidance development,

AV would be required to raise the penapsis to 3986 km and correct the apoapsls to 430.000 km. The results were 
used to select a design trajectory for the evaluation of aerodynamic heating and associated TPS performance. For 
this purpose the result- for heat load vs. heat rate were evaluated, as shown in Figure 4. Monte Carlo trajectory 
,! 1 647 was selected for the reference concept TPS design since it provides the highest heat load trajectory of the all 
the considered cases and the heat rate Ih In the 9K' percentile.

CANDIDATE TPS MATERIALS 

Early in the study. NASA Ames did preliminary analysis 10 estimate Uic anticipated heating environment for 
Neptune acrocapture. For that purpose. Ames evaluated the flattened cllipslcd geometry on the limiting lit) up 
(undershoot) trajectory with a minimum density atmosphere model. At the time, the preliminary vehicle design had 
a ballistic coefficient of 400 kg hi' in contrast to 895 kc in" for the final design. 

Convective heating was calculated through three-dimensional CFD solutions with the DPLR code and radiative 
healing was calculated with the NEQAIR'" code using an 1 1 species model. Figure 5 illustrates healing rates at 
selected locations on the body at a time in the trajectory when peak hcaung is experienced. The first numbers are 
radiative healing rates and the adjoining numbers arc convective heating rates. On the basis of these values 
candidate TPS materials were defined for various regions on the body.

In die windsidc stagnation region of the vehicle, where heating rales arc the highest, candidate materials and 
their characteristics are summarized in Table I. Fully dense carbon phenolic is a robust, mature, and wcll- 
characterized material that is capable of handling high heat fluxes and pressures. It was used by NASA as the 
forcbody TPS on the Pioneer Venus and Galileo probes and as rocket nozzles for solid ptopcllant boosters. It is well 
suited for severe heating environments where significant ablation would be anticipated. Its density and composition 
prevent it being a very good thermal insulator and, as a result, it would be a heavy TPS solution for more modest 
environments. Reduced density carbon phenolic is a notional material based on retaining the good ablation 
performance associated with a carbon reinforced phenolic composite but improving its thermal insulation 
performance by reducing the composite density. Such materials were briefly studied in the 1980s and a lew 
composites were fabricated and tested with encouraging results. The Genesis TPS is comprised of a thin carbon- 
carbon faceshcet attached (through co-processing) to low-density carbon libcrform insulation. It was manufactured 
as a single-piece hcatshicld for the 60 : cone-shaped forcbody of the 1.5 m diameter Genesis probe. The material was 
qualified through arc jet testing to heat fluxes as high as 700 W.enr for the Genesis mission. Because of its all- 
carbon construction, it is not the best thermal insulator. The modified Genesis TPS is also a iiuUiiml material, in 
which part of the carbon fibcrform insulation is replaced with a low-density ceramic tile to improve its thermal 
insulation performance. 

For the windsidc expansion region, where heating rates arc somewhat lower, candidate materials arc summarized 
in Table 2. Many of the same materials that are candidates for the windsidc stagnation region are also viable 
candidates for the windsidc expansion region. The exception is fully dense carbon phenolic, which has been 
replaced with PICA (Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator), in which a low-density carbon fibcrform is 
impregnated with phenolic resin. PICA is being used as die forcbody TPS on die 60° cone-shaped forcbody of the 
Q.K3 in diameter Stardust probe. It has been tested to heat fluxes in excess of 1500 W'em" with good ablation 
performance, but begins to exhibit char spall al pressures in excess of 0.6

Finally, for the leesidc region, where heating rates arc much lower and radiative heating is estimated to be 
negligible, candidate materials are summarized in Table 3. SLA-561 V is a silicone-bascd ablative in honeycomb 
developed by Lockheed-Martin (LMA) and is a llight-provcn material that was used as the forcbody hcatshicld on 
the Mars Viking. Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rover entry probes. The SRAM 1 7 and SRAM20 materials 
arc also silicone-bascd and were developed by Applied Research Associates (ARA). They arc manufactured by a 
different technique, called the Strip Collar Bonding Approach (SCBA). PhcnCarb20 is another ARA material 
manufactured by the SCBA technique, which uses a phenolic resin rather than silicone. It is capable of handling 
higher heat fluxes than the silicone-bascd materials, at the sacrifice of insulation efficiency.

conducted independent How field and radiative transport compulations did the aerothcrmal environment definition 
of the flattened cllipslcd geometry for Neptune aerocapturc. ' The acrohcaiing team held regular meetings to 
compare results and identify differences in thcnnochcmical and radiation modeling, assumptions, boundary 
conditions, cic. Very good agreement was attained for laminar convectivc healing between LaRC's LAURA ' ' code 
and ARC's DPLR* code. That was not true for turbulent heating where the LAURA code predicted significantly 
higher turbulent heating rates in comparison to DPLR. 

Radiative heating was calculated by LaRC using Ihc RADEQU1L 1 '" code and by ARC using the NEQAIR'" code. 
Again, there were significant differences, as discussed in Rcf 1 1. Based on these results, eilimules of the healing

candidate TPS materials were selected and sized, with the FIAT" code, for the maximum heating point in each

4. Post-acrocapturc acroshcll separation occurs between the hcatshicld and backshcll. 

For the hcatshicld (Zones I and 2). the material models employed with FIAT were extrapolated to heating 
conditions beyond the range for which they have been validated. The exception is fully dense carbon phenolic that 
has exhibited excellent performance at even more severe ground and flight conditions in development of the 
hcatshicld for the Galileo entry probe. In principle, the other material candidates should perform adequately at these 
conditions as similar materials have been tested with high-energy lasers at such conditions with good performance.

for ihc reference i"Med"i condition, only fully dense carbon phenolic (p = 1.45 g'cm'l and die Genesis concept 
(carbon -carbon faceshcci over carbon fiberform insulator) were considered. As shown in Figure R. fully dense 
carbon phenolic (CP) is very heavy (= 18.6 c mv > and very thick (= 12.9 cm). Furthermore, predicted surface 
recession is very large (~ 9.6 cm). It is doubtful lhat tape-wrapped CP could be fabricated to these thicknesses wilh 
adequate quality. Such thicknesses were achieved for ihc nosccap on ihc Galileo probe, but thai was a chopped 
molded construction of a relatively small nosccap. To fabricate a one-piece chopped molded hcatshield for this large 
Neptune uerocapnirc vehicle would require presses of a size that do not currently exist. The option is a buildup of

In comparison, the Genesis concept has marginally loner arcal weight (= 17.9 g cm ), but is even thicker i 14.9

fibcrform. Fabricating a cloth-reinforced carbon-carbon to Utat Uiickncss with good uniformity and quality is a 
challenge. The predicted surface recession is also large (= 7.6 cm), but less than CP. The TPS requirements at 
"Low - condition healing arc about 2'3ids those at the reference condition. It should be noted that for the evaluation 
of the "Low" condition, a reduced density carbon phenolic <p = 0.96 y an ) was included in the evaluation. Such 
materials were fabricated and evaluated for other TPS applications in the 70s and 80s. but never used. The reduced 
density CP looks rclativclv competitive at the "Low" condition, but it is doubtful it could withstand peak heat (luxe* 
in the range of 10 kW'cm" without spalling. Given these results, it was decided to select fully dense carbon phenolic 
as the reference TPS in the nose region. 

WINDSIDE CENTERLLNE (ZONE 21 

The "Low" and "Med" acroheating rates and loads along Monte Carlo trajectory #1647 arc shown in Figure 9. 
As was the cose with the nose region, alter further acroheating analyses, it was concluded thai the "High" values

vehicle. The peak heat (luxes arc in the range 3-6 kW.'cm 1 . eliminating lower density candidate materials. The total 
heal loads arc still very large - 300-700 kJ/cnr. TPS sizing in this region was done for fully dense carbon phenolic, 
the Genesis concept and reduced density carbon phenolic. As seen in Figure 10. the reduced density carbon phenolic 
has ihc lowest area! weight |~ 6.5 g'cnr at the reference condition), but is very thick (~ 6.2 cm). The surface 
recession is the largest among the materials considered I ~ 3.9 cm). The Genesis concept's arcal weight is marginally 
greater (6.9 g'cm'l and the ihickness is very large (~ 8.7 cm). The sizing analysis determined that the C-C laccsbcct 
needed lobo = 3.1 cm thick backed by ~ 5.6 cm of carbon libcrform. However, the surface recession is the smallest 
among lite materials considered (ft 2.0 cm). In comparison, fully dense carbon phenolic is the heaviest solution |8.9 
g/cnr at the reference condition). Moreover, the TPS requirements at the low condition arc marc than half those at 
the reference condition Given these results, the reduced density carbon phenolic was selected as the reference TPS 
in Zone 2 The major uncertainty is whether reduced density carbon phenolic can handle Uicsc peak heal fluxes 
reliably.

Unfortunately, there arc not many low-density TPS materials that can handle heat fluxes of dial magnitude 
effkiendy. The lack of low-mid density materials with such a capability is a serious deficiency in the TPS arsenal. 
Consequently, the only candidate TPS material evaluated for Zone 3 applications was PICA (Phenolic Impregnated 
Carbon Ablator), with a density of = 0.240 rj/cm'. 

The PICA sizing results, shown in Figure 12. illustrate that ihcareal weight is moderate {= 1.29 g/cm'). It is still 
rather thick (~ 5.36 cm) but within manufacturing capabilities. Surface recession is predicted to be comparatively 
small (= 1.17 cm). 

The low heat llux heating solutions were applied to Zone 4. where the peak heat flux is only 272 W.'cnr and the 
total heat load is "a 30 kJ'cm\ In this region TPS sizing calculations were done for PICA. SLA-56IV. SRAM 17. 
SRAM20. and PhcnCarb20. As seen. PICA would be a heavy and thick TPS solution for this relatively modest 
heating environment, although no surface recession is predicted. The difference in areal weight and thickness 
requirements among SLA-56IV. SRAMI7 and SRAM20 is noi negligible, but sllll relatively small. Predicted 
surface recession is greatest for SLA-56IV. In comparison, no recession is predicted for PhcnCarb20 and its areal 
weight and thickness requirements arc similar to the siliconc-bascd low-density ablators. The selection of SLA- 
561V for the reference design was due solely to lis (light heritage. 

SUMMARY 

This study of a Neptune acrocapturc mission has demonstrated that for the geometry* and mission design 
parameters selected, it is a very challenging mission from the TPS standpoint The windside heating rates are so high 
< particularly in the stagnation region) that only fully dense carbonaceous TPS materials can handle them with 
reliable performance. Furthermore, the windside heat loads arc enormous. These long duration acrocapturc 



128 



trajectories require extremely thick TPS. particularly on the wind side. Such carbonaceous materials arc not good 
insulators, but arc good ablators, and the results demonstrate that, on the windsidc. ablation is the dominant 
mechanism. Since carbon is the best ablator we currently have, whether improvement could be attained with 
development of new TPS materials is debatable. However, the required thickness ol'a tape-wrapped carbon phenolic 
andor a cloth-reinforced carbon-carbon cannot be manufactured as a high quality product. It may be possible to 
manufacture as a stackup of 2.5-5.0 cm thick sheets, mechanically joined. However, that would require some 
manufacturing development It is also important to appreciate that the effects of ablation and shape change on 
vehicle aerodynamics were not considered and should be investigated, as they may be very important. 

ACKNOW LEW ;M ENTS 

The authors wish to express their appreciation to William M. Congdon of Applied Research Associated who did 
the TPS sizing analyses for SLA-S6 1 V. SRAM 1 7. SRAM20 and PhcnCarb20 on the Ice side (Zone 4). The SRAM 
and PhcnCarb materials arc proprietary products of ARA and. consequently. ARA has the only analysis models for 
these materials. In addition. ARA has an analysis model for SLA-56IV (developed from arc jet test data obtained 
during the Mars Pathfinder project) that addresses surface recession, whereas the current ARC model docs not 
Interestingly, the thickness requirements for SLA defined by ARA (with consideration of recession) and those 
defined by ARC (without consideration of surface recession) were essentially identical.

A mulli -center -huh was conducted in 2003 to assess the feasibility of and technology 
requirements for using aerocaplure to insert a .scientific platform into orbit around Neptune. 
The aerocaplure technique offers a potential method of greatly reducing orhitcr mass and 
thus total spacecraft launch mass by minimizing the required propulsion system mass. This 
study involved the collaborative efforts of personnel from (.angle) Research (.enter lI.aRC>, 
Johnson Space (light Center iJSFCt. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFCl. Ames Research 
Center (ARC), and the Jet Propulsion laboratory ll'I ■ One aspect of this effort was the 
structural design of the full spacecraft configuration, including the ellipsled acrocapturc 
orbiter and the in-spacc solar electric propulsion <SF.Pi module/cruise stage. This paper will 
discuss the functional and structural requirements for each of these components, some of the 
design trades leading to the final configuration, the loading environments, and the analysis 
methods used to ensure structural integrity. It will also highlight the design and structural 
challenges faced while trying to integrate all the mission requirements. Component sues. 
materials, coastruction methods and analytical results, including masses and natural 
frequencies, will be presented, showing the feasibility of the resulting design for use in a 
Neptune aerocaplure mission. Lastly, results of a post-study structural mass optimization 
effort on the ellipsled will be discussed, showing potential mass savings and their influence

INTRODUCTION 

Structural sizing for a conceptual acrocapiurc spacecraft 10 Ncpiunc was requited to establish concept feasibility 
and to obtain preliminary component mass estimates. The full spacecraft launch stackup consisted of an 
cllipslcd acrocapiurc 'arbiter vehicle sitting atop a propulsion module iPM ^cruise stage, all designed to fit within the 
5 meter fairing of a Delta IV Heavy launch vehicle'. The PM'cruisc stage contained the solar arrays ISA's). Xenon 
(Xc) lank and other subsystems for the 30 kW. 6-enginc solar electric propulsion (SEP) system to be used out to 3 
AU. It also held a small hydrazine fuel tank, telecommunication antennae, navigation equipment, thermal radiators, 
and two Neptune direct entry atmospheric probes which were considered simple lumped masses for this study. 

There were four basic objectives for the structural analysis: I) Support all science payload and subsystem 
components in the required volume. 2) Meet minimum stackup natural frequencies at launch. 3) Sustain structural 
stresses at launch and during acrocapturc with acceptable margins of safety (MS), and 4) meet the above three 
objectives with minimal structural mass. Objective 1) above was accomplished by multiple packaging/analysis 
iterations between J PI. and LaRC personnel, producing several cllipslcd orbitcr configurations and overall size 
changes before an acceptable design was found. Launch loading criteria from the Boeing Payload Planners Guide' 
and acrocapturc loading criteria from NASA Langlcy Monte Carlo simulations were used in conjunction with the 
commercially available finite clement analysis (FEA) software 1-1)1- AS to size structure with acceptable strength 
and stifiiicss to meet objectives 2) and 3 1 above. 1-DEAS FEA and hand calculations were used to size the cllipslcd 
orbitcr and the PM'cruisc stage during the scheduled design/analysis cycle. Due to challenges in packaging all of 
the required payload instruments and subsystem components to meet design functionality* and overall center of 
gravity (i'tii requirements, and to the ensuing shortened time available for analysis, mass optimization was 
performed after the scheduled design analysis cycle. The commercially available software HypcrSizcr* M was used 
to help reduce mass on the cllipslcd orbitcr. No similar mass optimization eftbrt was done on the PM'cruisc stage. 

The resulting structure consists of a composite material honeycomb sandwich construction cllipslcd orbitcr 
acroshcll surrounding a deep-rib stiffened honeycomb sandwich payload deck. The cllipslcd otbitci acroshcll is 
separate forcbody (F'B) and backshcll |BS) pieces integrally stiffened with longitudinal and circumferential blades 
The I II and IIS separate from the payload deck after acrocapturc via several pyrotechnic separation fittings. The 
resulting PM 'cruise stage is a stiffened Al skin with Al rings and trusses to support the hydrazine and Xc tanks and 
the iwo direct entry* probes and an Al frame lo support the SEP engines. 

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 

ORBITER SHAPE SELECTION 

Neplunc atmosphere profiles developed by Justus, Duvall. and Keller" at MSFC and Neptune atmosphere entry 
parameters developed by JPL and LaRC personnel were used to determine the required acrocapiurc vehicle sliapc 
and aerodynamic characteristics to meet ihc stringent entry corridor needed for acrocapturc at Neptune . Edquisl* 
(LaRC) evaluated the aerodynamics of several entry vehicle shape classes, including sphere-cone, biconic. bent 
blconic. and cllipslcd. to find an appropriate shape giving the necessary volume and aerodynamic lift to drag ratio 
(L'D). The resulting vehicle, as shown in Fig. I. was an cllipslcd shape with a flaucncd bottom. The general 
cllipslcd shape is a body of revolution with an ellipsoid nose and circular cylinder aft end. The flaucncd cllipslcd 
has an upper portion that is half a body of revolution and a lower portion that is a general ellipsoid nose and 
elliptical aft cylinder.

ORBITER AND PM/CRUISE STAGE REQUIREMENTS 

The primary functions of the cllipslcd orbiicr were to provide ihc aerodynamic shape necessary 10 facilitate 
orbiter acrocapturc using the Neptunian atmosphere, to provide the volume necessary to package the scientific 
payload and other subsystems, to provide sufficient structural MS for natural frequency, buckling, and static stress 
for launch and acrocapturc loading, and to do all of the above with minimal structural mass and complexity. There 
were several challenges to overcome in fulfilling these functions. The cllipslcd acroshcll structure had to support a 
high thermal protection system (TPS) mass'' due to the high acrohcating during acrocapturc" 1 . The numerous 
payload and other subsystem components had to be packaged to allow their proper functions but also to provide 
proper overall mass CO to maintain the required cllipslcd angle of attack for aerodynamic control and stability 
during the lull acrocapturc phase " . There were also large variations in acrocapturc g loads during the course of 
the conceptual design phase. These challenges required multiple cllipslcd sizing iterations as detailed in a later 
section. 

The primary functions of the PM/cruisc stage were to support the cllipslcd during launch and cruise: to provide 
attachments for the two direct entry Neptune probes, telecom antennae, thermal control radiators, and SEP system 
components; to provide sufficient structural MS for natural frequency, buckling, and static stress for launch loading; 
and to do all of the above with minimal structural mass and complexity. The primary challenge for the PM/cruisc 
stage structure was providing for the numerous component attachments in a compact design without compromising 
their proper functions. The two direct entry probes required specific alignment to allow separation independent of 
each other and the cllipslcd and to allow separation along a vector going through (or as close as possible to) the 
vehicle CG. The large cllipslcd mass sitting on top during launch also required extra PM/cruisc stage stillness 10 
meet the stackup launch natural frequency requirements. 

.STRUCTURAL ANALYSES REQUIREMENTS 



DESIGN LOADS 

Design launch loads were taken from the Boeing Payload Planners Guide for the Delta IV Heavy, and arc 
summarized in Table I below. For the static analysis and natural frequency calculations, the full stackup was 
assumed restrained at the payload adapter fitting (PAF). Acrncaplure design g loads were taken from the 3-sigma g 
loads from the Monte Carlo entry analysis , and were balanced with acroprcssurc loads on the cllipslcd acrnshcll 
using an unpublished coarse pressure distribution from N. Takashima (AMA'LaRC) dated September 12. 2003. 
Component level loads from mass acceleration curves (MAC's), and sine, random, and acoustic loading were not 
analyzed as part of this study.

ANALYSIS METHODS 

Standard "stick and panel"* finite element model |FEM| construction with 2-D inon-solid) elements was used for 
all structural analyses. Components such as the two direct entry probes, radiators, science instruments, fuel 
tanks-fuel, etc.. were modeled as lumped masses and connected to the vehicle structure using rigid-type clement 
connectors or beam elements as appropriate. All FEM's were constructed with I-DEAS. and solved with 1-DEAS 
(2.RKm cliipslcd) or NASTRAN (5.5m ellipslcdl as described below. 

The structural analysis was done in two phases. First, the cliipslcd was analyzed using the acroeapture pressure 
loads with an inertia relief solution method that balances the pressures with entry g loads. The TPS was modeled as 
non-structural mass (NSM) on the acroshcll elements using arcal densities provided by B. Laub |ARC) with . : »i",i 
growth factors applied. For the structural analysis, the F I* TPS arcal density (55.4 kg'nv) and IIS and base TPS 
arcal density (5.54 kgnr) were each assumed constant, making two TPS zones. Later TPS analysis modified this to 
four TPS zones'* in an effort to help reduce TPS mass, hut was not available in time for this structural analysis. 
Instruments and other subsystem components were modeled as lumped masses with 30% growth factors applied 
Non-point masses such as thermal blankets, cabling, etc., were added to the payload deck as NSM with 30% growth 
factors applied. The cliipslcd acroshcll and payload deck structure Here then sized and the resulting structure 
masses were considered current best estimate iCBEl. 

For the full stackup at launch, the cliipslcd structure mass was adjusted to include die 30% growth factor, with 
the growth portion being applied as NSM to the existing structure plate elements. The Si; p. cruise stage payload 
components (radiators, probes, fuel tanks, etc.) were modeled as lumped masses with die 30% growth factors 
applied Non-point masses such as cabling, etc.. Here added as NSM to the cruise stage cylinder and thrust tube 
The stackup structure was then sized for the launch loads, and die resulting structure masses for the PM 'cruise stage 
were considered CBE. Alter the preliminary structure sizing for static loads, the cliipslcd was evaluated for 
buckling under acroeapture loads. The full stackup was evaluated for natural frequency and buckling in the launch 
configuration under launch loads. 



ORB ITER SIZE ITERATIONS 

5,5 M ELLIPSLED DESIGN 

The cliipslcd acroshcll was initially 5.5m lone, maximized to lit in a Delta IV Heavy 5m fairing*. The length 
was determined by ratioing the maximum acroshcll width that could lit inside the Delta IV fairing. This provided 
the largest orbitcr volume for science payloads and greatest width for mounting a rigid high gain antenna (1 IGAI. 
Different internal structures to support the rigid aeroshcll and mount payloads were tried. Figure 2 shows an early 
concept using a space truss to maintain the outer mold line (OML) of the acroshcll. 



t+CA 





Figure 3. Internal Payload Deck 

This configuration relied on the trusses for all equipment mounting and did not require large stiffening of the 
shell. The load path from all payload and acroshcll mass continued through die space truss into a cruise stage 
adapter. The purpose of using the space truss was to minimize acroshcll mass with an efficient, highly stiff internal 
support system. As the design study proceeded, the payload requirements and their configurations inside the 



133 



cllipslcd were constantly being revised. As j result ihe internal truss design became difficult to alter while trying Ui 
package ihe rigid HCiA within ihe trusses. A second method was tried that used a Hat. stiffened deck far mounting 
the pay load. The Hat payload platform nffcrcd a convenient surface for securing equipment and also allowed for 
quick component configuration changes. Figure 3 shows the flat payload deck and major components of die oibiter. 
A single hydrazine tank was located near die cllipslcd CG with a rigid IKiA mounted as shown The ngul 
antenna was oriented to fit inside die acroshcll and mounted to ihe payload deck. The load path for this concept had 
the acroshcll supporting the payload deck during launch. All loads would then be taken into an elliptic thrust 
adaptor and continue dirough to the cruise stage. The cruise stage configuration during this time of die design study 
«as unknown so a cruise stage from an earlier design study was used. Figure 4 shows the FEM of the cllipslcd 
with its adapter and cruise stage.

5.5M ELUPSLED STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS 

The 5.5m cllipslcd acroshcll structure was analyzed using standard FEA combined with a non-deterministic 
structural sizing program called KypcrSizcr™ which allows many trial composite sections and materials to be 
analyzed very efficiently using only one coarsely meshed FEM. The HyperSIzcr™ analysis started with a coarse 

N ASTR.W FEM of the full stack shown in Fig. 4. subjected to launch loads. That FEM. containing only 
CQUAD4. CTRIAJ. CONM2. and CBAR NASTRAN elements, was solved with NASTRAN and the mesh and 
resulting element internal loads were imported to HypcrSizcr™. Figures 5 and 6 show* how the FEM was divided 

into major components reflecting the mission of the orbitcr. HypcrStzcr ,u did not require structure rcmcshing to 
reflect structural changes necessary to support changing payload components from the master equipment list (MEL). 

Detailed funic clement modeling of panel stiffening methods was not necessary. Within HypcrSbcr™. a user

Groups of finite elements Here created for optimising in HypcrSi/cr IU and arc shown as different colors in Figs. 4- 
6 Stiffening of the paylnad deck and acroshell became necessary as die analysis proceeded. Figure 6 shows a major 
bulkhead required to support the Hydrazine tank and axial stiffeners to help transfer loads during launch. IPS mass 
was input into HypcrSizcr* u as KSM and could easily be altered to suit different i hernial material trade studies- 
Launch and aerocapture loading and structure stiffness requirements from Table 1 in die Design Loads section were 
used. An older cruise stage FEM from a previous design study 1 ' Has used to obtain estimated full stack stillness to 
check launch -eon figuration natural frequencies. Subsystem pay load component masses from the latest MEL Here 
lumped on the stiffened payload deck based on the latest design. Components were constantly being moved during 
the design, causing many modifications to ihc analysis. Later in the study the HGA antenna was replaced widt a 
deploy able antenna. This decision drastically affected ihc acroshell design since die maximum geometry to fit the 
rigid HGA Has no longer required- The acroshell volume could be shrunk to minimize structural mass. This led to 
a final design concept requiring a 2.8Xm long cllipslcd dial also represented die most current MEL. The design 
study was dicn divided into two paths: one using a 5.5m long cllipslcd and die other using a 2.8Km cllipslcd that 
also represented ihc most current design and MEL. The purpose for having two design concepts was to provide 
maximum and minimum structural mass estimates for die systems study. The 5.5m cllipslcd design was finished tn 
give mission planners a maximum structural mass and internal volume ifa larger cllipslcd is required. 



5.5M ELLIPSLED STRLCTLRAL ANALYSIS RESULTS 

The final structural member masses for the 5.5m cllipslcd are shown in Tabic 3 below", fallowed by mure

Honeycomb core with faccshccts was used for the overall acroshcll design. It provided the lowest mass dial met 
all stress and dynamic modes criteria for the acroshcll. The isogird design shown in Fig. K was selected for the

typical FEA- HypcrSizcr™ was able to quickly show a payload deck isogrid design that is well suited for mounting 
components with ample openings for running cables and piping. The isogird design mass was roughly me same as 
that required for a blade stiffened payload deck using honeycomb.

leaving the payload deck on orbit. During acrocapiure. the component inertia loads from the orbitcr's high-g 
deceleration are transmitted across the payload deck panels, into the ribs. Uicn into the acroshcll (primarily the F <B I. 
where they arc balanced by die acroprcssurc loads on the acroshcll exterior. 

Figures 14" and 15 show the PM'cruisc stage design with functional componcnis. and its FEM representation 
wilh major simciural components, respectively. Both the SEP cylinder and cruise stage thrust lube are stiffened skin 
construction. The 0.254 cm Al skin is stiffened by a scries of Al longerons and rings, as shown in Fig 16, which 
transmit launch loads into the PAF and provide liard points for component attachments such as die hydrazine and Xe 
tanks. SA's. radiators, etc. An Al ring frame at the bottom of the SEP cylinder, stiffened by 5.0S cm Al lube struts, 
provides attach points for the six SEP engines. The two entry probes are supported by 5. OH cm Al channel- section 
with 5.0X cm Al tube trusses. The Xc tank is supported by a 5. OS cm Al channel-section ring and 5.08 cm Al

lube struts tit the bottom, and 2.54 cm Al tube struts ul the top. The hydrazine tank is supported by a single Al ring 
wiili stiffening struts. During launch, the ellipslcd inertia loads enter the PM'eruise stage via the eight separation 
fillings. The inertia loads from the individual PM. cruise stage components enter the stiffened skin structure thiuugh 
their respective support structure. All of these loads are then transmitted down the stiffened skin, eventually being

ZJ8M Kl.MPSI.ED STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS RESULTS 

The FEM modal analysis showed that both the ellipslcd and PM'cniisc stage structures were largely stiffness 
critical, and were thus primarily sized to maintain the minimum design natural frequencies during launch. The full 
depth ribs on the ellipslcd payload deck and their attachment to the aeroshcll III kept the local deck natural 
frequency above 32 Hz. The minimum natural frequencies for the full stackup at launch were 1 1.08 Hz lateral and 
32.01 Hz axiaL above the 8 and 3D Hz requirements', respectively. The lateral mode involved the full stack bending 
in ihc "wcakwisc" direction, normal to the payload deck, while the a\ial mode involved the SEP engines and their 
support structure "bouncing" in the direction of the stackup longitudinal axis. 

Since the structure was largely stiffness critical, the FEM static analyses showed generally high structural 
margins of safety, with only a few local high stress areas. On ihe ellipslcd. the areas of lowest MS were the I II 
longeron strength at the BS separation fitung interface during aerocapturc, and the propcllant tank support strut 
buckling at aerocapturc. On the PM'cniisc stage, the lowest MS was against bending of the SA base support during 
launch. The maximum static dcllcction of 0.66 cm occurred at the ellipslcd nose during launch for the maximum 
lateral g condition. An l-DEAS eigenvalue buckling solution ofthc full stackup showed a buckling margin of safety 
of 2.47. with the critical location being the upper Al skin panel on the cruise stage. 

Summaries ofthc ellipslcd alone and full stackup masses arc shown in Tables 4 and 5 below. Table 4 shows the 
ellipslcd alone evaluated for aerocapturc loading. The total mass of 1412 kg includes 474.2 kg of TPS mass and 
1 36.5 kg of CBE structure mass.

POST-STUDY EVALUATION WITH HYPER.SI7.ER"" 

Due to the numerous iterations involved in integrating the required system 1 pay load components and associated 
support structure into the available volume allowed by the 2.88m flattened ellipslcd shape, structural mass 
optimization was not performed within the original design schedule. Shortly after the systems review for the 
Neptune Acroeapturc study (October 28, 29, 2003). further analysis was performed on the 2.88m ellipslcd using 
HypcrSizcr™ 1 in an effort to realize sonic gains by optimizing the ellipslcd structure mass. As discussed earlier. 
HypcrSizcr™ reads in the FEM mesh and internal loads from an outside FEA (in this case 1-DEAS). then steps 
through a user-defined design space, applying the internal loads to local model regions called panels. While not a 
true optimizer. HypcrSizcr™ uses closed form solutions to step through all user-specified material, size, and 
construction method permutations for each model panel to find the lightest structure to pass all strength and stability 
requirements. This can result in adjacent panels having totally different sizing or construction techniques. While 
the result may yield the lightest possible structure, it is often not a manutacturablc one. The user may then need to 
adjust the design space or link certain panels for the sake of manufacturability and rerun HypcrSizcr"*. Lastly, 
since HypcrSizcr™ only checks local panel buckling modes and natural frequencies, the full FEM must be re- 
evaluated in the FEA code for global stability and natural frequencies. 

For the mass optimization on the ellipslcd structure, only the sandwich construction family of panels was looked 
at. This was primarily due to previous experience with this type of structure* and due to time limitations. As a 
result of the HypcrSizcr™ analysis, the ellipslcd structure mass was reduced by 39.1 kg. from 134.4 kg (the upper 
thrustcr frame and propulsion tank supports were not evaluated) to 95.3 kg. The mass reduction was realized by 
sandwich thickness and/or face sheet reduction in some locations, and in blade stiffener thickness reductions. The 
first pass through HypcrSizcr" 1 showed a 56.2 kg mass reduction, but all of this could not be realized when 
adjustments were made for structure manufacturability. The resulting structure was rc-cvaluatcd in 1-DEAS to 
cheek global stability and natural frequencies. As a result of reducing mass without significant stillness reduction, 
the overall stackup natural frequency climbed slightly from 11.08 Hz to 11.84 Hz. For the ellipslcd only at 



140 



acrocapturc, ihc global buckling margin of safety increased from 1.97 10 2.51. For the full stackup. the 
buckling margin increased from 2.47 to 3. IS. 

CONCLUSIONS 

A successful acrocapturc mission at Neptune depends on success of many subsystems, including structure that 
will house and support the required payload. sustain launch loads, sustain acrocapturc inertia loads and heating, and 
provide all of the above with a minimum mass. The structural analysis portion of the Neptune acrocapturc systems 
design study showed that the chosen stackup design of a stiffencd-skin construction PM/cruise stage supporting a 
2.88m cllipslcd acrocapturc vehicle is a feasible approach when using a Delta IV Heavy launch vehicle, and that the 
stitfened sandwich cllipslcd structure design is a feasible approach for acrocapturc at Neptune. The resulting 
structure masses were within system allocations and allowed a total spacecraft mass that would meet the mission 
requirements. The results of this study may serve as a starting point lor more rclincd analyses of a Neptune 
acrocapturc cllipslcd and cruise stage. In addition, several observations were made from the study results: 

1. The flattened cllipslcd shape was volumctrically inefficient in that CG requirements pushed components 
towards the bottom of the cllipslcd. leaving the upper portion largely unused. 

2. The MEL was under constant revision and was not connected to a 3D model that could be imported into I- 
DEAS. Analysis and MEL should be completely integrated to allow the analysts the most updated design 
information. 

3. The acroshcll sizing and payload support structure sizing were strongly linked, and required numerous 
separation fittings to provide load paths from the payload deck to the acroshcll. Further analysis and optimization is 
warranted to help reduce this separation system complexity. 

4. The use of HypcrSizcr" 1 sizing software in this study demonstrated its capabilities to the design study team 
and displayed how it may be applied to cllipslcd geometry. The software greatly reduced analysis time by using the 
same finite clement mesh for many trial configurations. Typical FEA modeling of bladcd stiffened panels would 
have the analysts modeling separate stiffeners and requiring a remesh after each solution of the model. 
HypcrSizcr™ avoids this and allows many trial iterations in one solution. Further mass reduction may be possible 
by applying HypcrSizcr™ to the cruise stage structure.
