Abstract. As observations and models of the planets become increasingly more accurate and sophis- 
ticated. the need for highly accurate laboratory measurements of the microwave properties of the 
component gases present in their atmospheres become ever more critical. This paper describes the 
system that has been developed at Georgia Tech to make these measurements at wavelengths ranging 
rom 13.3 cm to 1.38 cm with a sensitivity of 0.05 dB/km at the longest wavelength and 0.6 dB/km 
at the shortest wavelength. 


1. Introduction 

One of the greatest hindrances in modeling and fitting synthetic spectra of the 
planets is the lack of realistic models of the absorption profiles of the atmospheric 
components under planetary conditions (see e.g., de Pater and Mitchell, 1994). A 
program has been underway at the Georgia Institute of Technology to measure 
the absorptive and refractive properties of these components as a function of 
temperature, pressure, composition and frequency under conditions similar to those 
on Venus (Steffes, 1985; Fahd and Steffes, 1991; Fahd and Steffes, 1992) and 
the outer planets (Steffes and Jenkins, 1987; Jenkins and Steffes, 1988; Joiner 
et al., 1989; DeBoer and Steffes, 1994). As the thermochemical and radiative 
transfer models of the planets become more sensitive and sophisticated the need 
for increasingly accurate measurements is apparent. This paper reviews the process 
of determining the refractive index and absorption coefficients of low-loss gases 
and describes the high sensitivity microwave measurement system used at Georgia 
Tech to measure these values, including a full discussion of the new computer 
interface and analysis system which greatly enhances the sensitivity and reliability 
of the results. 


2. System Overview 


2. 1 . Data analysis 

The Georgia Tech system (see Figure 1) uses the changes in the quality factor ( Q ) 
and center frequency of a resonator with a test gas present to measure absorptivity 
and refractivity. These changes are monitored using a swept signal source and a

spectrum analyzer whose output is read into a personal computer for display and 
analysis. The refractivity of the test gas is measured by noting the change in the 
center frequency of the resonance with the test gas present relative to the center 
frequency in the presence of a vacuum. The refractivity of the gas (defined as 
Nfi — 1 0 6 (?i - 1 ), where n is the refractive index of the gas) is given by 

ATr=10 (I) 

jg 


where f v and f g are the center frequencies of the resonance with a vacuum and test 
gas present, respectively (see e.g., Tyler and Howard, 1969). 

To determine the absorptivity of the test gas, the quality factor (Q) of the 
resonance is then measured a number of times with the test gas present to develop 
statistics of the measurement. The expression for the quality factor is given by 



( 2 ) 


where, again, f q is the center frequency and A/ is the full-width half maximum 
power (FWHM) bandwidth of the resonance. The test gas is then vented and a 
reference, lossless gas is added such that the change in center frequency from 
a vacuum is the same for this reference gas as it was for the test gas. This is 
to compensate for the effects of dielectric loading; that is, when Equation 3 (to 
be introduced shortly) is not strictly valid due to changes in the real part of the 
refractive index (see e.g., DeBoer and Steffes, 1994 for a brief mathematical 
explanation and Spilker ( 1 990) for a physical discussion of dielectric loading). The 
quality factor of the resonance is then measured with the reference gas and the 
absorptivity of the test gas is computed via 


(3) 


where A is the wavelength in meters at the center of the resonance with the test 
gas present and Q and t refer to the measured quality factor and transmissivity 
(the portion of the power that is transmitted through the resonator at the resonance 
center) of the resonator with the test gas (subscript g) and reference gas (subscript 
r) present. 

Errors in this calculation are due to the finite sensitivity and accuracy of the 
spectrum analyzer (which are minimized by proper selections of the spectrum ana- 
lyzer parameters such as resolution bandwidth and analyzer span) and by electrical, 
stochastic noise (which is minimized by maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio and 
by taking and collecting many samples). For a more complete discussion of the 
techniques for data analysis, as well as a complete description of the measurement 
error and error determination, see DeBoer and Steffes (1994). 

Errors in measuring the properties of the environment in which the absorptivity 
measurements took place (e.g., temperature, pressure . . . ) do not affect the appli- 
cation or analysis of the above equation, i.e., the measured absorptivity is the value

for that environment. The environmental measurement errors manifest themselves 
when the measured absorption is fit to some sort of formalism to mathematically 
model the absorption. 

Absorption is typically calculated by summing over the contributions from that 
molecule’s set of absorption lines, unless the frequency of interest lies in the so- 
called continuum and a power law formalism can be fit. For a set of absorption 
lines, the absorption may be calculated via 

a = Y, n< < P ' T)Si(T)Fi(v , v u P,T,.. .) (4) 

l 

where n(P,T) is the number density of the absorber, Si(T) is the line intensity, 
and F x {v,v x , P,T, . . .) is the lineshape function as a function of frequency, line 
center, pressure, temperature, etc. See, for example, Townes and Schawlow ( 1 955). 
Obviously, the temperature and pressure of the sample must be known to apply this 
equation. To first order (and assuming an ideal gas), variation in one term of this 
sum can be written 

6a = X J(T)P^6v + X J(T) F + P^ SP (5) 

+XJ(T)P [jgf F - |F + |£] 6T + J(T)PF6x 

where 

J(r| = 5 (?)’ r “'“ <6) 

and A is a constant and \ is the mixing ratio of the absorbing gas. (Note, this 
equation also assumes that dFjd\ « 0; i.e., the linear dependence of a on \ 
dominates). 

The coefficients of the various terms show the magnitudes of the effects resulting 
from the uncertainty in measuring that term. Figure 2 plots those coefficients for 
a Van Vleck-Weisskopf lineshape assuming parameters similar to the 168 GHz 
absorption line of H 2 S and an H 2 S mixing ratio (x) of 10%. 

2.2. Laboratory configuration 

The general characteristics of this type of measurement system have been described 
previously (DeBoer and StefTes, 1994). The objective of this laboratory system is 
to simulate the atmosphere of a given planet and measure the microwave properties 
of gases under these conditions. It consists of three sub-systems: (1) the planetary 
atmospheric simulator, (2) the microwave measurement sub-system and (3) the 
data collection and analysis sub-system. Figure 1 shows a block diagram of the 
laboratory configuration.

The planetary atmospheric simulator consists of a hermetically sealed stainless 
steel pressure vessel which in turn is placed inside a temperature chamber capable 
of reaching temperatures as low as 1 50 K or as high as 600 K. The pressure vessel 
is connected to three gas cylinders via stainless steel tubing with sufficient stop 
valves such that every piece of the network may be isolated to aid in the detection 
of leaks, as well as for safety considerations. A combustible gas detector and a 
water bubble technique were used to detect and locate leaks within the system. 
When properly sealed, the system can safely contain pressures exceeding 7 bars 
and sustain this pressure with no discernible leaks over a period of many hours. A 
roughing vacuum pump was also connected to the vessel to evacuate the chamber 
and is capable of producing a vacuum of 3 torn For pressure measurements between 
1 and 800 torr, a digital thermocouple vacuum gauge was used, while for higher 
pressures an analog gauge was used with an accuracy of 0.2 atm throughout its 
usable range. 

The microwave sub-system consists of two cylindrical silver-plated cavity res- 
onators which both reside within the pressure vessel. The larger of the two res- 
onators has been used for S band (2.25 GHz or 13.3 cm) and X band (8.5 GHz or 
3.5 cm) measurements which correspond to TEon and TEm 7 modes respectively. 
The small resonator has been used for K band (21 .7 GHz or 1 .38 cm) measurements 
which corresponds to the TE 034 mode. Many other resonances are available for use 
at other wavelengths (see Figure 3). The three bands discussed above were used due 
to their relatively large quality factors. Mode suppression slots are incorporated in 
each resonator to block the degenerate TM modes which have lower quality factors 
as well as to let the gas flow freely into the resonators. Two HP (Hewlett-Packard) 
8690 microwave sweep oscillators are used to generate the input signal in the three 
bands and a high resolution HP 8562B spectrum analyzer is used to measure the 
output signal. Initially a 10 dB attenuator was used on the output of the sweepers 
to provide 20 dB of return-loss isolation for the sweeper as it swept through the 
resonance. Later, a 40 dB return-loss ferrite isolator was used at S and X bands 
which greatly improved the isolation allowing the use of greater output power from 
the microwave sweeper as well as providing 10 dB extra throughout. This results 
in an approximate 15 dB increase in the signal-to-noise ratio for these bands. At K 
band, the 10 dB attenuator is still used. 

The final sub-system (the data collection and analysis sub-system) consists of 
a personal computer and software package which reads the data in and allows 
data processing and resonance line-fitting to be performed (see appendix). This 
interface greatly improves the sensitivity and reliability of the experimental system 
from previous configurations, when the operator was required to eye-fit the half- 
power and center frequency points on the spectrum analyzer display. Full control 
of the spectrum analyzer is possible and batch file input gives speed and flexibility 
to this control. The following section describes in more detail this sub-system and 
other issues of the data processing.

the vertical lines. 


3. The Data Collection and Analysis Subsystem 

As mentioned previously, in the past, data collection of the resonance parameters 
(i.e., bandwidth, center frequency and level) were eye-fit and read from the spec- 
trum analyzer display. The disadvantages of this technique are manifold, not the 
least of which is operator fatigue near the ned of a long series of data collection 
which degrades the quality of the results. The obvious solution is to read the data 
into a personal computer for analysis. A General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB) 
was used to interface the spectrum analyzer and computer. 

Data is read from the spectrum analyzer into a data buffer on the computer A 
user-selectable Hamming window (typically a 50-point window) is convolved with 
the 600 data points read from the Hewlett-Packard 8562B spectrum analyzer to 
smooth the data and a simple peak searching routine then finds the center frequency 
and amplitude. The half power points are then found and the bandwidth computed. 
The spectrum, along with the smoothed fit, are displayed and the operator is queried 
as to whether this data point is to be used or not. (Occasionally, incomplete spectra 
are recorded which must be discarded.) If complete, the resonator measurement 
values are written to a data file. These values are: 

• center frequency 

• amplitude at the resonance center 

• half power bandwidth 

• quality factor 

• an asymmetry figure of merit.

where / r , /; and f c are the higher frequency half-power (-3 dB) point, lower 
frequency half-powr (-3 dB) point and center of the resonance, respectively. It 
varies from ±100%, with 0% being perfectly symmetrical. Typical asymmetry 
factors range between ±10%. (Excessive asymmetry may suggest contamination 
of the data from the effects of adjacent resonances, and the results may be unreliable. 
If it persists for more than one scan, the system must be dismantled and thoroughly 
checked.) When all data have been taken and recorded, the program computes 
the averages and variance of all quantities, including the absolute value of the 
asymmetry as well as the asymmetry itself. These values are written to a data file 
and used in the computation of the absorptivity and its associated error. Typically,

six individual measurements at X band (8.5 GHz). Figure 5 shows representative 
spectra at the three bands, as well as the associated parameter fits for the smoothed 
data. 

One problem encountered in fitting the spectrum is the presence of sweep-on- 
scan nulls. These occur when a sweeping source is used along with a sweeping 
bandpass filter on a spectrum analyzer so that at a given time energy from the signal 
may not be present in the given small frequency range received instantaneously by 
the spectrum analyzer. One solution is to slow the sweep time on the spectrum ana- 
lyzer. In some cases, however, totally eliminating these nulls requires unacceptably 
long sweep times. Another is to utilize a feature of the data processing software 
called “FIX”. FIX is a multi-pass averaging scheme whereby “null” data points are 
set to an average of its ten nearest neighbors until the change of all points to be 
FIXed is less than a one percent threshold. 

Figure 6 is the same spectrum as the K-band spectrum in the previous figure 
with artificially generated sweep-on-scan nulls. The spectrum was then FIXed and 
new fits were computed. Note that the values of the original and manipulated data 
agree very well, as summarized below in percent differences: 

• center frequency: 0.00005%

system at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Calculating the standard deviation 
for 10 measurements of the FWHM bandwidth before and after the inclusion of the 
computer interface shows marked improvement. For example, the standard devia- 
tion of 1 0 measurements of H 2 S opacity at 6 bars in an H 2 /He atmosphere at 2 1 3 K 
showed improvements of 34%, 41% and 16% at S, X and K bands respectively. It 
is probable that the improvement in reliability is greater than represented by this 
since an inherent viewer bias is present whenever eye-fit measurements are made 
on a noisy display. Another factor added by the computer-aided system is that more 
sample points can be easily taken to further increase the sensitivity. Table I shows 
the square root of the mean measurement variance of the system (the “standard 
deviation”) at the three bands for all temperatures and pressures before and after 
the inclusion of the computer interface. For comparison, a resonator-based system 
similar to the K band resonator but operating between the frequencies 9.18 and 
17 44 GHz (Spilker, 1990) had root mean variances of 1.02 and 2.46 dB/km, at 
frequencies corresponding to the two end-points.
