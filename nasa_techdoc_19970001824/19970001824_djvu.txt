Gaseous, ionized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are thought to be responsible for a very common 
family of interstellar infrared emission bands. Here the near- and mid-infrared spectra of the cations of the 
five most thermodynamically favored PAHs up to coronene:phenanthrene, pyrene, benzo[e] pyrene, benzo- 
[g/u']perylene, and coronene, are presented to test this hypothesis. For those molecules that have been studied 
previously (pyrene, pyrene-dio, and coronene), band positions and relative intensities are in agreement. In all 
of these cases we report additional features. Absolute integrated absorbance values are given for the 
phenanthrene, perdeuteriophenanthrene, pyrene, benzo[g/t/]perylene, and coronene cations. With the exception 
of coronene, the cation bands corresponding to the CC modes are typically 2—5 times more intense than 
those of the CH out-of-plane bending vibrations. For the cations, the CC stretching and CH in-plane bending 
modes give rise to bands that are an order of magnitude stronger than those of the neutral species, and the 
CH out-of-plane bends produce bands that are 5-20 times weaker than those of the neutral species. This 
behavior is similar to that found in most other PAH cations studied to date. The astronomical implications 
of these PAH cation spectra are also discussed. 



I. Introduction 

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) form an important 
class of organic molecules, having long been known to play 
prominent roles as environmental toxins, 1 and in soot formation. 2 
During the past decade, evidence has been mounting that they 
are important components of the interstellar medium as well. 3 
Under the harsh conditions of many interstellar environments, 
PAHs are expected to be predominandy ionized. For this reason 
we have undertaken a study of the infrared spectroscopic 
properties of matrix-isolated PAH cations. While the primary 
goal of this research is to investigate the role of PAHs in the 
interstellar medium, the results are of general interest. PAH 
cations are considered to be important intermediates in combus- 
tion, 2 and PAH intermediates and primary reaction products are 
directly related to the carcinogenicity of some members of this 
hydrocarbon family. 1 

Ionized 4 and neutral 5 PAH molecules have been proposed as 
the carriers of a very common family of interstellar infrared 
fluorescence bands at 3050, 1615, 1310, 1150, and 885 cm -1 
(3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.7, and 1 1 .3 /mi). The ubiquity of this spectrum 
suggests that free molecular PAHs are common throughout 
interstellar space, and the intensity of the bands indicates that 
they are as abundant as the most abundant polyatomic interstellar 
molecules known. As much as 30—40% of the radiant energy 
from some of these sources is emitted in this family of bands. 
Reviews of this field can be found in ref 3. 

While the interstellar PAH hypothesis rests on the general 
resemblance of the interstellar emission spectra to the absorption 
spectra of aromatic hydrocarbons, the available data are mainly 
for neutral PAHs suspended in salt pellets 6 or organic solvents. 7 
Under such conditions, interactions with the surrounding 
medium and with other PAH molecules (clusters) strongly 
perturb the transitions. 8 While this body of information has

been invaluable in establishing the interstellar PAH hypothesis, 
there are important differences in details between the laboratory 
and interstellar spectra. Differences in band position and relative 
band intensities, as well as the fact that most interstellar PAHs 
are expected to be isolated and ionized in the regions where 
they emit, have hindered the verification of the hypothesis and 
the exploitation of PAHs as probes of the interstellar medium. 
Thus, the infrared spectra of neutral, isolated PAHs and of 
ionized, isolated PAHs are of fundamental importance to further 
progress in this field. 

There has been substantial progress recendy in experimentally 
measuring the emission spectra of vibrationally excited, gas 
phase aromatic molecules. Elegant UV-pumped ER emission 
experiments on gas phase neutral PAHs have been carried 
out. 9-13 The results of these experiments, in conjunction with 
absorption studies of PAHs in the gaseous state at various 
temperatures, 14-18 show that (i) the emission peak frequency 
of the aromatic CH stretch in gas phase PAHs shifts as a 
function of internal energy content and matches that of the 
interstellar band at 3050 cm -1 at reasonable levels of excitation; 
(ii) the bandwidth increases with energy and matches that of 
the interstellar band at similarly appropriate internal energies; 
and (iii) the plateau that underlies the interstellar feature, and 
extends out to about 2740 cm -1 , is reproduced as well. 
Schlemmer et al., 12 in reporting the gas phase emission from 
naphthalene and pyrene, show that the relative intensities of 
the emission bands differ in absorption from those for the same 
species and from the relative intensities of the interstellar 
emission features. Thus, they conclude that small neutral PAHs 
cannot be the carriers of the interstellar bands. This is, of course, 
consistent with PAHs being ionized in the emission zones. These 
emission experiments on neutral PAHs are inherently very 
difficult, and it will likely be some time before this type of 
measurement will be carried out on ionized PAHs. These results 
raise important, fundamental questions regarding the molecular 
physics of the infrared emission process from vibrationally 
excited molecules.

Successive members of this series are formed by adding two or four 
carbon atoms at a time, the number required to complete an additional 
fused aromatic ring. Note that the C 2 and C4H2 groups needed to go 
from one species to the next refer only to the number and type of atoms 
added in each step and do not refer to specific chemical species or 
mechanisms. Similarly, the circles here indicate planarity and overall 
electron delocalization, not superaromaticity. 

There is also a need for reliable, quantitative infrared 
absorption data on neutral and ionized PAHs at the low 
temperatures characteristic of the interstellar medium. We have 
initiated a systematic program to obtain this information. In 
the first paper in this series, we reported our experimental 
approach to the problem and presented results from 4000 to 
200 cm -1 on the smallest PAH, naphthalene (CioHg), and its 
fully deuterated analog, (CioDs). 19 We now have the infrared 
spectra for a number of neutral PAHs and their cations. Here 
the spectroscopic properties of the members of the thermody- 
namically most favored PAH species containing between 6 and 
24 carbon atoms are presented. Stein and co-workers 20 have 
extensively investigated the thermodynamic properties of aro- 
matic species, showing that, of the hundreds of PAH isomers 
possible in this size range, those in Figure 1 are thermodynami- 
cally most favored under high-temperature PAH growth condi- 
tions. Thus, these are likely to be important in the circumstellar 
environments in which PAHs are produced and able to survive 
the harsh conditions of many of the interstellar emission regions. 
In subsequent papers in this series, different aspects of PAH 
cation structure, including tetracyclic PAHs, polyacenes, and 
PAHs incorporating 5-membered rings, will be explored. The 
neutral spectra of these PAHs will be presented elsewhere. 21,22 
Our motivation is to understand how structure and size influence 
the infrared spectra of small PAHs in their neutral and cationic 
forms. 

Efforts to provide this type of information are also underway 
at several other institutions. Defrees and Miller carried out 
theoretical calculations on the expected infrared spectral proper- 
ties of the naphthalene and anthracene cations and predicted 
surprising relative band strength differences between the neutral 
and ionized forms of these PAHs. 23 * Subsequently, Defrees et 
al. 13b and Pauzat et al. 24 have greatly expanded this work. 
Professor Vala and co-workers at the University of Florida have 
published the infrared spectroscopic properties for cations of 
the PAHs naphthalene, anthracene, pyrene, perylene, and 
coronene, 25-28 and d'Hendecourt et al. have reported the 
spectrum of the coronene cation. 29 

This paper is laid out as follows. The experimental tech- 
niques are summarized in section II. In section m are presented 
the near- and mid-infrared spectra of the phenanthrene, phenan- 
threne-dio, pyrene, pyrene-rfio, benzo[e]pyrene, benzo[g/ii]- 
perylene, and coronene cations. These results are discussed in

H. Experimental Section 

The matrix isolation technique is employed to isolate 
individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules 
in an argon matrix, where they are photoionized and probed 
spectroscopically. Argon matrices are known to be suitable for 
vibrational studies, typically causing small shifts in the 0—15 
cm -1 range. For electronic transitions, a neon matrix is required 
to avoid serious perturbations. With the exception of the sample 
deposition procedure, our experimental procedure has been 
described in detail previously. 19 A schematic cross section of 
the sample chamber is shown in Figure 2. Briefly, an infrared- 
transmitting substrate (Csl) is suspended inside an ultra-high 
vacuum chamber and cooled by a closed-cycle helium refrigera- 
tor. The ultra-high vacuum chamber (p ~ 10~ 8 mTorr) is 
equipped with multiple inlet ports, and the cooler is mounted 
in such a way that the infrared window can be rotated to face 
any of these ports without breaking the vacuum. Typically, 
the Csl window was cooled to 10 K and positioned to face the 
sample deposition inlets. Samples were prepared by co- 
deposition of a gaseous PAH with a large overabundance of 
argon to a thickness appropriate for generation of the cation 
and measurement of its infrared spectrum. After sample 
deposition was complete, the cold head was rotated to face the 
beam of an infrared spectrometer so that a prephotolysis 
spectrum could be recorded. The sample was then rotated to 
face a vacuum ultraviolet lamp for photolysis. The sample was 
finally returned to the scanning position where the postphotolysis 
spectrum was recorded. Comparison of this spectrum with the 
neutral spectrum permitted identification of the ion features that 
appeared upon photolysis. 

A. Sample Preparation. PAHs containing three or more 
rings do not have sufficient vapor pressure at room temperature 
to permit their preparation as a gaseous mixture with argon, as 



Infrared Spectroscopy of PAH Cations

was the case in our previous study involving naphthalene. This 
necessitated the vaporization of the PAH of interest and 
subsequent co-deposition of the gaseous PAH molecules with 
excess argon. To this end, PAH samples were placed in 
resistively heated Pyrex tubes ( l h in. diameter) and mounted 
on the sample chamber through a stainless steel Cajon Ultra- 
torr fitting. The temperature of the PAH was monitored using 
a chromel/alumel thermocouple mounted on the exterior of the 
tube with aluminum tape. Such an arrangement should poten- 
tially be useful at temperatures as high as 316 °C (the failure 
temperature of the Viton O-ring) and with samples as small as 
a few milligrams. Argon was admitted through a second port 
at a position 45° from the first in such a way that the two streams 
coalesced before the surface of the cold window. The deposition 
tubes ended between 2 and 4 cm from the cold window. During 
deposition, this window was maintained at a position intermedi- 
ate between the two deposition ports (Figure 2). The argon 
deposition line was liquid nitrogen trapped to minimize con- 
tamination. 

Sample quality was found to be optimal for PAH vapor 
pressures in the range 10-30 mTorr. Higher vapor pressures 
required higher argon deposition rates that exceeded the thermal 
conductivity of the Csl window, warming the matrix. The 
annealing that resulted produced a matrix that was highly 
scattering at short wavelengths, crippling the Lyman-a photo- 
ionization efficiency and the signal-to-noise ratio of the near- 
ER spectrum. Conversely, lower vapor pressures required longer 
deposition times, which necessarily increased the contaminants 
in the matrix and, in turn, reduced the ionization efficiency. 
Thermochemical data 30 were used to establish the approximate 
temperature necessary for each PAH investigated. Optimum 
tube temperatures were as follows: phenanthrene, 10 °C, pyrene, 
60 °C; benzo[«]pyrene, 97 °C; benzo[£/u]perylene, 137 °C; and 
coronene, 158 °C. The optimal argon flow rate was estimated 
to be between 0.5 and 1 .0 mmol/h. 

As was the case in our earlier study of the naphthalene 
cation, 19 photoionization of PAH/Ar matrices was accomplished 
using the Lyman-a emission from a microwave-powered 
discharge lamp optimized by the use of a 10% H2 in He gas 
mixture at ~75 mTorr. A MgF2 vacuum window allowed 
transmission of this radiation to the sample. For those experi- 
ments incorporating the electron acceptor CCI4 in the matrix, 
lower energy photolysis was necessary. Lyman-a photons 
(10.35 eV) are sufficiendy energetic to ionize matrix-isolated 
CCU (IEgas =11.28 eV) 31 molecules, negating their usefulness 
as electron acceptors. For those experiments, UV radiation was 
generated by a discharge in pure H2 gas at ~ 150 mTorr. This 
optimized the broad molecular hydrogen emission band centered 
around 160 nm (7.77 eV) with respect to the Lyman-a line. A 
CaF 2 vacuum window (cutoff A « 150 nm) served as a filter to 
exclude the residual Lyman-a radiation. 

This technique results in ion yields ranging from 5 to 10%. 
Specifically, the yields for the spectra presented here were as 
follows: phenanthrene, 9 ± 4%; phenanthrene-^io, 7 ± 4%; 
pyrene, 10 ± 5%; benzo[e-Jpyrene, 6 ± 3%; benzo[g fa'lperylene, 
10 ± 5%; and coronene, 11 ± 6%. These yields were 
determined as previously described. 19 

Pure argon samples having pressures in the range 75—225 
Torr were prepared as described previously. 19 

The PAHs used in this investigation include phenanthrene 
(Aldrich Chemical Co., 98+% purity), phenanthrene-dio (Al- 
drich, 97% purity), pyrene (Aldrich, 99% purity), pyrene-Jio 
(Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, 98% purity), benzo[e]pyrene 
(Aldrich, 99% purity), benzo[g/jflperylene (Aldrich, 98% purity), 
and coronene (Pfaltz and Bauer, Inc., 97% purity). All samples

were used without further purification. Matheson prepurified 
argon (99.998% minimum) was used in these studies. 

B. Spectroscopy. The sample chamber, now equipped with 
Csl vacuum windows, is suspended in the sample compartment 
of an FTER spectrometer (Nicolet Analytical Instruments, Model 
740). All spectra reported here were measured at 0.5 cm" 1 
resolution. This resolution is critical in detecting ion bands that 
fall near the position of a neutral band. Spectra typically were 
generated through the coaddition of five blocks of 200 scans, a 
number that optimized both the signal-to-noise ratio and the 
time requirements of each experiment. 

Mid-infrared spectra (7000-500 cm -1 ) were collected using 
an MCT-B detector/KBr beam splitter combination. Near- 
infrared spectra (15100-8800 cm -1 ) were collected using a 
silicon detector/quartz beam splitter combination. Conversion 
between the two spectral regions allowed the measurement of 
both electronic and vibrational band intensities from a single 
matrix. 

C. Cation Band Identification. Three criteria must be 
satisfied before a photoproduct band is attributed to a particular 
PAH cation. First, the bands must appear only when the 
associated neutral PAH is present in the matrix. An extensive 
number of control experiments have been carried out to ensure 
that this is the case. Second, the bands attributed to the cation 
must be markedly enhanced when CCL», an electron acceptor, 
is present in the matrix at a concentration of 1 part in 200. This 
behavior establishes that the bands arise from a positive ion. 
This effect is demonstrated in Figure 3, which shows a portion 
of the spectrum of the benzo[gft/]perylene cation generated both 
with and without CCU in the matrix. Third, all the bands 
attributed to the cation must evolve in a similar fashion. Spectra 
collected as a function of photolysis time show that all of the 
bands assigned to the respective cation grow and decline together 
in a manner distinct from other features produced by photolysis. 
These band correlation plots are presented on a molecule by 
molecule basis along with the appropriate spectroscopic data. 
In general, the intensities of the bands corresponding to the PAH 
cation (plotted showing data points) peak after 4—8 min of 
photolysis and then remain essentially constant or fall off slightly 
upon further photolysis. This behavior is consistent with that 
observed previously for the naphthalene cation and discussed 
in ref 19. Conversely, the bands of other photoproducts (plotted 
without data points shown) tend to increase steadily with 
photolysis time. Rogue photoproduct bands were not common, 
typically numbering 2—4 in each case. Most common were

m. Results 

There are many PAHs that one can study. Those studied at 
the NASA Ames Research Center have been selected for the 
following reasons. First, as little is known about the infrared 
properties of PAH cations, the smallest members of the PAH 
family were chosen to minimize the number of fundamental 
vibrations and spectral complexity. Second, as this work is 
motivated by the astrophysical question, the PAHs most likely 
to be important in this context were given first preference. Thus, 
the thermodynamically most favorable members of the high- 
temperature PAH formation route containing 6—24 carbon atoms 
were studied (Figure l). 19 These spectra are presented here in 
the second paper of the series. Third, as the effects of structure 
and size on the infrared spectra of simple PAH cations are not 
known, related PAHs with limited, well-defined structural 



differences have been studied together. Finally, as size in- 
creases, PAH samples tend to become increasingly refractory 
and increasingly difficult and expensive to obtain. Thus, in the 
interest of experimental practicality, smaller PAHs were the 
logical starting point. Small PAHs are also relevant from the 
astrophysical point of view. Indeed, a QRRKM analysis of the 
interstellar spectra indicates that molecules containing 20—30 
carbon atoms dominate the fluorescence at the shortest 
wavelengths. 3 "- 4 

The positions and relative intensities of the mid-infrared 
cation bands for the thermodynamically most favorable series 
of PAHs up to coronene are shown in Table 1 . In addition, the 
spectra of the perdeuterated phenanthrene (Ci4E>io + ) and pyrene 
(CiaDio" 1 ") cations have also been measured. Band positions and 
relative intensities are compared with those of the fully 
hydrogenated cations and with those of naphthalene (C]oHg + 
and CioDg + ) in Table 2. The infrared spectra of the cations of 
the thermodynamically most favorable series of PAHs are 
presented in the order of increasing molecular size. Only those 
regions of the spectrum where cation bands appear are shown. 
The complete spectra of the neutral isolated PAHs will be given

A. Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy. Screening by the CH 
stretching bands due to the much more abundant neutral 
molecules prevents detection of any of the PAH cation bands 
in the 3200-2900 cm -1 region. The difficulty inherent in 
detecting the infrared active CH stretching modes of the PAH 
cations studied to date is consistent with theoretical calculations 
that have predicted that the CH stretching bands of the cation 
are suppressed relative to the analogous bands of the neutral 
counterparts. 23 "- 1 '- 24 

The Phenanthrene Cation, Citfio*. The mid-infrared spec- 
trum of the phenanthrene cation is shown in Figure 4. The band 
frequencies and relative intensities are listed in Table 1. The 
evolution of the bands assigned to the cation with Lyman-a 
photolysis is plotted in Figure 5. This band correlation, one of 
the criteria of ion assignment, is looser for the weaker bands 
whose signal-to-noise ratios lie in the 2—3 range. Nonetheless, 
their overall behavior of a sharp rise and leveling off warrants 
their assignment to the cation. 

Only weak new bands appear in the normally very strong 
CH out-of-plane bending region between about 900 and 600 
cm -1 . Most of the detectable new bands fall between 1570 and 
1250 cm -1 and, thus, are assigned principally to the CC 
stretching and CH in-plane bending modes of the phenanthrene 
cation. There undoubtedly are other cation bands that are 
screened by neutral features. Due to unavoidable confusion 
from H2O contamination in the matrix, it is difficult to establish 
the presence or absence of ion peaks in the 1600 cm -1 region 
from this data. 

The cation frequency spectrum, with bands between 1570 
and 580 cm -1 , resembles that of the neutral species in that the 
spectrum of neutral phenanthrene is richest between 1600 and 
700 cm -1 . However, the intensity pattern is remarkably 
different, a characteristic of all PAH cations studied to date. 
While neutral phenanthrene has moderate to strong bands 
between 1600 and 850 cm -1 and two very strong bands at about 
813 and 735 cm -1 (out-of-plane CH bends), the cation band

intensity pattern is just the opposite, with the bands in the CC 
stretching and CH in-plane bending region being stronger than 
those in the CH out-of-plane bending region. Interestingly, the 
strongest cation bands fall at 1565 and 1277 cm -1 , frequencies 
within the envelopes of the strongest interstellar emission 
features. 

Two cation bands are discernible in the normal CH out-of- 
plane bending region between 900 and 680 cm -1 , namely, those 
at 836.0 and 756.2 cm -1 . They fall close to the regions expected 
for two and four adjacent hydrogen atoms per aromatic ring, 
respectively, the types of peripheral H atoms on phenanthrene. 
Note that both bands (836.0 and 756.2 cm -1 ) are shifted to 
higher frequencies by 15—20 cm -1 from the very intense bands 
corresponding to the CH out-of-plane bending vibrations in the 
neutral molecule (813 and 735 cm -1 ). Furthermore, one can 
estimate the intensity of these features relative to those of the 
neutral molecule. Let n° be the number of neutral molecules 
in the (prephotolysis) sample. n + is the number of ions 
produced by photolysis. The ionization fraction, / (=n + /n°), 
has been measured directly as 0.09 ± 0.04 (9 ± 4%) by the 
fractional decrease in the neutral band areas with photolysis 
for this experiment. The integrated intensities (/r dv = a) of 
the bands from the CH out-of-plane bending modes of the n° 
neutral phenanthrene molecules are (am) = 0.165 cm -1 and 
(3735)° = 0.249 cm -1 . If the absorption strengths of the CH 
out-of-plane bends in the ion were the same as those of the 
neutral molecule, we would expect to see the growth of ion 
bands with integrated intensities 9 ± 4% those of the prepho- 
tolysis neutral bands or (a 8 36) + = (0.09)(0.1647) = 1.5 x 10" 2 
cm" 1 and (a 75 «) + = (0.09)(0.2493) = 2.2 x 10' 2 cm" 1 . In 
reality, the intensities of the 836 and 756 cm -1 ion bands are 
measured to be (a 83 6) + = 1-123 x 10~ 3 cm -1 and (ays6) + = 
1.406 x 10" 3 cm -1 , respectively, or 13 x and 16x weaker, on 
average, than those in the neutral molecule. This is in general 
agreement with our previous results for the naphthalene 
molecule, where the CH out-of-plane mode was found to be 
suppressed by a factor of 18 in the cation. 

The two bands at 694.5 and 582 cm -1 probably arise from 
CCC plane bending motions.

is shown in Figure 6. The evolution of the bands assigned to 
the cation with Lyman-a photolysis is plotted in Figure 7. These 
bands, together with the corresponding hydrogenated ion bands, 
are listed in Table 2. 

Comparisons between the spectra of the hydrogenated and 
deuterated PAHs have been used to shed light on the nature of 
a particular band. 19 - 27,32 * 33 For phenanthrene, however, without 
the benefit of calculations that take molecular symmetry into 
account, this technique alone is of rather limited use. The 1565, 
1558.2, 1551, and 1513 cm -1 bands all fall in the CC stretching 
region, with a vqc'Vvcc 1 ' ratio of 1.01—1.03 to their presumed 
deuterated counterparts at 1547.4, 1528/1525, 1507, and 1459.5 
cm" ' . This assignment to CC stretching modes does not require 
deuteration. 

While the positions of the bands in the 1300-1260 cm -1 
region of perhydrophenathrene are suggestive of CC stretching 
vibrations, it is conceivable that they might have some CH in- 
plane bend character as well. Simply taking the bands between 
1300 and 1250 cm"' and comparing them to the frequencies of 
the perdeuterated molecule between 1296.5 and 1201 cm -1 , one 
obtains v^/v ratios in the 1 — 1 .05 range, again consistent with 
modes that are primarily CC stretching in nature. The difficulty 
here is that bands also appear upon deuteration between 1 194.1 
and 856.2 cm -1 , suggesting that there are active modes in the 
hydrogenated species corresponding to CH in-plane bends. By

assuming a vtyv ratio of 1.15, this would predict CH in-plane 
bands between about 1370 and 980 cm -1 , encompassing the 
bands between 1300 and 1250 cm -1 . As the spectrum of neutral 
phenanthrene has several absorptions in this region, it is 
plausible that the corresponding cation bands are screened. It 
has also been demonstrated that surprisingly large changes in 
intensity in a given vibrational mode can result from deutera- 
tion. 19,27 - 32 - 33 Thus, it may also be that the features observed in 
this region for the perdeuterated cation are too weak to be visible 
in the fully hydrogenated cation. It is clear that deuteration 
alone is not sufficient to make band assignments in the larger 
PAH molecules. 

The Pyrene Cation, CksHio + . The mid-infrared absorption 
bands of the pyrene cation are shown in Figure 8. The cation 
band frequencies and relative intensities are listed in Table 1. 
These compare favorably with those reported by Vala et al. for 
this species. 27 We have also observed seven additional bands 
attributable to the pyrene cation. These bands lie at frequencies 
of 1556.0, 1356.1, 1255.7, 1253.7, 1188.7, 953.8, and 867.0 
cm -1 . The bands at 1255.7/1253.7, 1188.7, 953.8, and 867.0 
cm -1 are weaker than those previously reported, while the bands 
at 1556.0, and 1356.1 cm -1 overlap with previously reported 
bands and may arise through site effects. 

The mid-infrared spectrum is characterized by moderate to 
strong bands that are rather evenly distributed between 1600 
and 600 cm -1 . Of the twelve bands between 1600 and 1200 
cm -1 , the CC stretching region, three are very strong. We have 
detected two bands in the CH in-plane bend region, at 1102 
and 976 cm -1 . 

The 861 cm -1 frequency of the detected out-of-plane CH bend 
is interesting. Pyrene has two rings with three adjacent H atoms 
and two rings with two adjacent H atoms. The 861 cm" 1 band 
falls at the high limit of the normal range expected for two 
adjacent H atoms. As the 690 cm -1 band falls nearly 60 cm -1 
below the range for neutral PAHs with three adjacent H atoms 
on a ring, it is attributed to a CCC bend. Apparently, due to 
either screening or the inherent weakness of the feature, the 
absorption corresponding to the triply adjacent CH out-of-plane 
bend remains undetected. Using an analysis similar to that 
presented for the phenanthrene cation, we find that the integrated

C20H12 4 " with Lyman-a photolysis is plotted in Figure 11. As 
with the phenanthrene cation, although this band correlation is 
looser for the weaker bands, the overall behavior of a sharp 
rise and leveling off warrants their assignment to the cation. 
The lines plotted without data points present the behavior of 
two photoprorJuct bands not associated with the benzo[e]pyrene 
cation. 

The 11 cation bands in the 1600-1150 cm" 1 range are 
dominated by a very strong band at 1349.2 cm -1 . All of these 
bands are attributed to CC stretches. As with perprotonated 
phenanthrene, no cation features were detected between 1200 
and 900 cm -1 (the CH in-plane bending region), presumably 
due to screening by absorptions from the neutral species. 

There are two cation bands in the CH out-of-plane bending 
region. Three are expected since there are three different classes

region screened by the stronger neutral absorptions, these results 
indicate that the force field for the cation is sufficiently different 
that these out-of-plane motions not only are reduced dramatically 
in intensity but that the bond strengths and interactions are 
altered as well. If the 873.3 cm -1 band does indeed arise from 
the doubly adjacent CH out-of-plane bending vibration, its 
intensity is suppressed by a factor of 9 from that of the neutral 
molecule. Furthermore, if the 848 cm" 1 band arises from the 
triply adjacent mode, it is remarkable both for its large blue 
shift from the neutral position (v = 772 cm -1 , Av = 76 cm" 1 ) 
and for the fact that it is only suppressed by a factor of 2 relative 
to the neutral, much less than the 10-20x reduction typically 
observed in other PAHs. 

The band at 685.7 cm" 1 is assigned to a CCC out-of-plane 
bend since, in contrast to the other ion CH out-of-plane bending 
bands, it falls 62 cm" 1 lower in frequency than the lowest 
frequency, strong neutral band and about 40 cm -1 below the 
region normally associated with four adjacent H atoms, in the 
range normally associated with five adjacent H atoms. 

The Benzol gki]perylene Cation, C22Hi2 r . The mid-infrared

assigned to C22Hi2 + with Lyman-a photolysis is plotted in 
Figure 13. The two lines plotted without data points present 
the behavior of two photoproduct bands not associated with the 
benzo[gfti]perylene cation. 

Although the benzo[g/iflperylene cation spectrum is similar 
to that of the benzo[e]pyrene cation in that it is rich in the 1600— 
1200 cm" 1 range, it has a very different intensity pattern. This 
spectrum is dominated by four strong bands in a grouping, which 
is similar to that found for the interstellar emission spectrum, 
rather than by one strong band. The strongest band falls at 1S78 
cm" 1 , followed by a gap of nearly 200 cm" 1 , at which point 
three bands become important, namely, those at 1401.3, 1369, 
and 1324.4 cm" 1 . As with phenanthrene and benzo[e]pyrene,

cm -1 beyond the high-frequency limit. Thus, as with the benzo- 
[t?]pyrene case, unless there are important bands in this region 
screened by the stronger neutral absorptions, these results 
indicate that the force field for the cation is quite different from 
that of the neutral molecule. As a doubly adjacent CH out-of- 
plane bend, the intensity of this band is suppressed by a factor 
of 4 from that of the 846 cm -1 band of the neutral molecule. 

The band at 639.6 cm" 1 is assigned to a CCC out-of-plane 
bend as it is more than 100 cm -1 below the region normally 
associated with three adjacent H atoms, and is even well out of 
the range associated with five adjacent H atoms. 

The Coronene Cation, C24H !2 + . The mid-infrared absorption 
bands of the coronene cation are shown in Figure 14. The cation 
band frequencies and relative intensities are listed in Table 1. 
The positions and relative intensities of the bands at 1378.6 
and 874.5 cm -1 agree well with those previously published. 2811 - 29 
The band at 1579 cm" 1 has not been reported. 

The coronene cation spectrum is remarkable for its simplicity 
and unusual intensity pattern. Only three cation bands have 
been reported, and the intensity pattern is opposite those of all 
other PAH cations studied to date, with the CH out-of-plane 
bend producing a band slightly stronger than that arising from 
the CC stretching modes. It should be pointed out that the 
ionization percentage calculated for this experiment is 11%, 
comparable to that obtained for the other PAHs in the series. 
Furthermore, the intensity of the detected CH out-of-plane 
bending feature is also comparable to that measured for the other 
cations. Thus, we conclude that the CC stretching modes in 
the coronene cation are anomalously weak, giving rise to the 
atypical intensity pattern. 

Two bands fall in the CC stretching range (1579 and 1378.6 
cm -1 ), none are in the CH in-plane bend region, and one falls 
in the CH out-of-plane bend region (874.5 cm" 1 ). These three 
bands fall at frequencies very close to those of prominent bands 
in the interstellar emission spectrum. As with btnzo[ghi]- 
perylene, it seems odd that no bands were detectable in the CH 
in-plane bend region, as the spectrum of the neutral species is 
extremely simple in this area and screening is not a reasonable 
explanation for the absence of cation bands. High symmetry 
seems plausible to account for the overall simplicity of the 
spectrum, the weakness of the CC stretching bands, and the 
absence of detectable bands in the CH in-plane bend region. 
The position of the out-of-plane CH bend of the cation is 
interesting in this regard in that, as with the other PAH cations 
in this series, it falls on the high side of the normal range 
expected for two adjacent H atoms and is reduced in intensity 
by a factor of 5 from that of the 857 cm -1 band of neutral 
coronene.

C. Integrated Absorbance Values. Integrated absorbance 
values [A (kilometers/mole)] for the mid-infrared cation bands 
of the PAHs phenanthrene, pyrene, benzo[g/ii]perylene, and 
coronene are listed in Table 4. These A-values were determined 
using the near-infrared spectra presented earlier in the following 
way. 

The integrated absorbance value, A, is given by the relation 



A = ft dv/N* 



(1) 



where W 4 " is the number density of absorbers, in this case PAH 
cations, and fr dv is the integrated area of the strongest near- 
infrared band (in centimeters -1 ). N 4 " (in moles centimeters -2 ) 
is related to the area of this band by the equation 



ft = tAv/e+Av 



(2) 



where f^Av is the integrated molar absorption coefficient in 
liters mole -1 . Combination of eqs 1 and 2 gives 



^nir = e L Av

coefficient e^, was determined from the oscillator strength (/)

A straightforward unitary conversion gives the integrated 
absorbance value in units of kilometers/mole. The ratio of the 
integrated area of the mid-infrared bands to that of the near- 
infrared band in the same matrix could then be used to scale 
Ank, giving the integrated absorbance values presented in Table 
4. All integrated band areas were calculated in base 10 with 
software provided by Nicolet. The specific oscillator strengths, 
molar absorption coefficients, and near-IR/mid-IR band ratios 
used for our calculations are given in the following. 

It should also be emphasized that our experiments indicate 
that the presence of CCU significantly enhances the near-infrared 
band intensities with respect to the mid-infrared band intensities. 
For example, without CCU in the matrix, the ratio of the 
integrated intensity of the 9005 A phenanthrene electronic band 
to the 1565 cm -1 vibrational band is 66. With CCU, the ratio 
is 139. The presence of CCI4 enhances the ratio by about 2 
times. For benzo[e]pyrene, without CCU in the matrix, the ratio 
of the integrated intensity of the 9181 A electronic band to the 
1349.2 cm -1 vibrational band is 43. With CCU, the ratio is 
59, an enhancement of about 40%. For the 7663 A and 1401 .3 
cm -1 bands of benzo[g/u']perylene, the enhancement is about 6 
times (/t dv^R/Jr dvMm = 9 without CCL, and 55 with CCU). 
In ref 19, we showed that CCU did not influence the absolute 
strength of naphthalene's mid-infrared bands, but did not 
investigate its influence on any electronic transitions. 

In view of the near- to mid-infrared intensity ratio alterations 
induced by CCU, A-values were determined for matrices without 
CCI4 present. Ultimately, the accuracy of these values rests on 
the molar absorption coefficient used to determine the number 
of neutral PAH molecules lost upon photolysis, the technique 
generally used to determine the molar absorption coefficients 
and oscillator strengths of the near-infrared cation bands. 36 As 
this information is not available for all of the PAHs studied 
here, we have been unable to determine A-values for all the 
cations reported. The integrated A-values for the other PAH 
cation bands will be evaluated as this information becomes 
available. 

This is an extremely important issue as there is wide variance 
in the literature on this subject. As with the naphthalene cation, 
and as discussed at length in ref 19, while the relative intensities 
of the cation bands reported here agree well in those cases where 
independently measured data are available (pyrene and coro- 
nene), there are discrepancies between the reported absolute 
intensities. However, while discrepancies still exist between 
our results and those from Professor Vala's group at the 
University of Florida, they are much more modest than was 
the case for the naphthalene cation (2— 4x as compared to 50 x). 
Such variances may well be within the experimental uncertain- 
ties associated with the measurements, conservatively estimated 
to be less than a factor of 2. By far the largest source of error 
in these measurements stems from the lack of accurate molar 
absorbances for the near-IR bands. In order to reduce the 
relative uncertainty in these values, and to eliminate the 
possibility of matrix effects influencing the electronic transitions 
differently from the vibrational transitions, we are developing 
an alternative method to determine A-values. In view of the 
fundamental importance of these values, we present the details 
of our A-value calculations.

earlier was applied to the naphthalene cation in order to check

the technique. We had previously derived the naphthalene 
cation A-values using an entirely independent analysis. 19 Use 
of the amended molar absorption coefficient for the 6754 A 
band of the naphthalene cation, 19 e^ — 565 L mol -1 cm -1 , 
and FWHH = 45 cm -1 in eq 3 gives Anir = 254 km/mol. The 
ratio of the 1218 cm -1 band of the naphthalene cation, the 
strongest rnid-infrared feature, to the 6750 A band measured 
for this experiment is 1/65, giving an A-value for this band of 
A1218 = 3.9 km/mol. This is in excellent agreement with the 
value of 4.1 km/mol presented in ref 19, supporting the validity 
of this technique. 

Phenanthrene Integrated A-Values. The oscillator strength 
for the 9005 A band of phenanthrene is 6 x 10" 5 . 36 Use of eq 
4 and a 53 cm -1 FWHH gives e^ = 338 L mol -1 cm -1 . 
Equation 3 gives Anir = 1.79 x 10 2 km/mol. Finally, the ratio 
of the strongest mid-infrared band, 1565 cm -1 , to the 9005 A 
near-infrared band is 1/66, giving A 1565 = 2.7 km/mol. The 
other mid-infrared A-values were scaled using the relative 
intensities shown in Table 1 . 

Phenanthrene-dio Integrated A-Values. The oscillator strength 
for the 8973 A band of phenanthrene-dio is assumed equal to 
that for phenanthrene, i.e., 6 x 10 -5 . 36 This gives e^. = 188 L 
mol -1 cm -1 (FWHH = 95 cm -1 ) and Antr = 179 km/mol. The 
ratio of the 1528 cm -1 mid-infrared band to the 8973 A band 
in phenanthrene-<fio is 1/42, giving A1528 = 4.2 km/mol. The 
other rnid-infrared A-values were scaled using the relative 
intensities shown in Table 2. 

Pyrene Integrated A-Values. The oscillator strength for the 
7837 A band of pyrene is assumed to be about 1 x 10 -3 . 39 
This gives e^ = 1420 L mol -1 cm -1 (FWHH = 210 cm -1 ) 
and Antr = 2.99 x 10 3 km/mol. The ratio of the 1356.1 cm -1 
mid-infrared band to the 7837 A band of pyrene is 1/11, giving 
A U56 = 282 km/mol. The other mid-infrared A-values were 
scaled using the relative intensities shown in Table 1. 

Benzol ghijperylene Integrated A-Values. The oscillator 
strength for the 7663 A band of benzo[g/u']perylene is also taken 
as 1 x 10~ 3 . 39 This corresponds to e^ = 3830 L mol -1 
cm -1 , based on a 78 cm -1 FWHH. The integrated absorbance 
value is Antr = 2.99 x 10 3 km/mol. The ratio of the 1578.2 
cm -1 mid-infrared band to the 7663 A band of benzo[ghi]- 



perylene is 1/8, giving A1578 = 374 km/mol. The other mid- 
infrared A-values were scaled using the relative intensities shown 
in Table 1. 

Coronene Integrated A-Values. The oscillator strength for 
the 9607 A band of coronene is 1.8 x 10" 3 . 40 This corresponds 
to e^ = 5.84 x 10 3 L mol -1 cm -1 , based on a 92 cm -1 
FWHH. This, in turn, gives Amr = 5.38 x 10 3 km/mol. The 
ratio of the 874.5 cm -1 mid-infrared band to the 9607 A band 
of coronene is 1/30, giving A&s =179 km/mol. The other mid- 
infrared A-values were scaled using the relative intensities shown 
in Table 1. 

IV. Astrophysical Implications 

Comparisons between the interstellar emission spectra and 
the absorption spectra of PAHs in KBr pellets have shown 
important differences, which are used by some to draw 
conclusions about the nature of interstellar PAHs and by others 
to raise doubts as to the validity of the PAH hypothesis. One 
important difference concerns relative band intensities. As 
shown in Figure 21, which presents the IR emission spectrum 
from the Great Nebula in Orion, 41 the interstellar 1610 cm -1 
(6.2 fim) feature and broad emission envelope centered near 
1300 cm -1 (7.7 /on), which are assigned to PAH CC stretching 
modes, are much more intense than the interstellar feature near 
885 cm -1 (11.3 fim), which is attributed to the CH out-of-plane 
bending mode. This behavior is just the opposite that of PAHs 
in KBr pellets and in solvents where the strongest absorptions 
by far are those due to the out-of-plane CH bending vibrations 
[often 5—8 times greater than the average band strength in the 
CC stretch and CH in-plane bending region between about 1650 
and 1100 cm -1 (6 and 9 fim)]. The relative intensities of the 
interstellar features have been taken by some as evidence that 
interstellar PAHs are severely dehydrogenated, in spite of the 
fact that atomic hydrogen is on the order of 10 000 times more 
abundant in most of the emission zones than the PAHs. 42 To 
invoke such a high degree of dehydrogenation under these 
conditions seems unreasonable. 

This difficulty is removed if the PAHs in space are largely 
ionized. With the exception of coronene, we have shown the 
following: First, the intensities of the bands in the 1650 — 1 100 
cm" 1 range, the CC stretching and CH in-plane bending region

of PAH cations, are typically 2-5 times greater than those of 
the CH out-of-plane bending modes, which fall between 900 
and 550 cm -1 . Second, the CH out-of-plane bending modes 
of the cations are typically 5-20 times weaker than the out- 
of-plane bending modes of the neutral molecules, and third, the 
bands in the the CC stretching and CH in-plane bending regions 
are generally an order of magnitude stronger than those for the 
corresponding transitions in neutral PAHs. The coronene 
exception is notable. The 874.5 cm -1 CH out-of-plane bend 
of the coronene cation is slightly stronger than the strongest 
CC stretch at 1579 cm" 1 . 

This work and work presented by the University of Florida 
group on other PAH cations 25-28 confirm the behavior predicted 
theoretically by Defrees et al. 23 and Pauzat et al. 24 and resolve 
one of the more troubling aspects of the interstellar PAH model. 
Other impediments to the full exploitation of the interstellar 
PAH hypothesis raised by comparing KBr pellet spectra to the 
interstellar spectra are addressed by the results of a study of 
the spectroscopic properties of a number of neutral, matrix- 
isolated PAHs found elsewhere. 21 - 22 

It is important to realize that the most intense bands of all 
PAH cations studied to date fall within the envelopes of the 
most intense interstellar features, namely, those at 6.2 and 7.7 
//m. As illustrated by Figure 21, these are consistently the 
broadest and most intense members of the interstellar emission 
band family. The observation that the most intense interstellar 
emission features fall in the PAH CC stretching and CH in- 
plane bending regions is completely consistent with the com- 
posite emission spectrum expected from a mixture dominated 
by free, ionized, small PAHs. 

V. Conclusions 

The near- and mid-infrared spectra of the phenanthrene, 
pyrene, benzo[e]pyrene, benzo[g/ij]perylene, and coronene 
cations, isolated in argon matrices, are reported. Ions were 
generated by in situ photolysis. 

With the exception of coronene, the strongest mid-infrared 
absorption bands of these PAH cations fall between 1600 and 
1200 cm -1 , the CC stretching and CH in-plane bending region. 
These tend to be 2— 5 times more intense than the bands due to 
the CH out-of-plane bending modes. The strongest bands tend 
to fall in groupings between 1600 and 1550 cm -1 and between 
1400 and 1200 cm -1 . 

On the other hand, integrated absorbance values for the CH 
modes in the cation are strongly depressed with respect to the 
neutral molecules. Only weak new bands grow in the normally 
very strong CH out-of-plane bending region between about 900 
and 600 cm -1 . The extent to which these out-of-plane motions 
are reduced in intensity and the bond strengths and interactions 



are altered is far more than would be expected on first principles 
by the removal of one electron from the n system. Similarly, 
as has been the case with previous PAH cations studied, no 
new features were found in the CH stretching region between 
3200 and 2900 cm -1 , implying that the CH stretching modes 
of the cation are comparable to or weaker than those for the 
neutral species. Theory predicts them to be weaker. 24 

Most of the detectable new bands fall between 1570 and 1250 
cm" 1 and, thus, are assigned principally to the CC stretching 
modes. Those at the lower frequencies in this range may have 
some in-plane CH bending character as well. 

The observation that the strongest cation bands coincide with 
CC stretching modes, behavior just the opposite that of the 
neutral species, has important ramifications on the interpretation 
of the observed astronomical emission spectrum, which is 
dominated by very broad features in this region at 1310 and 
1620 cm -1 . Since this seems to be a general characteristic of 
PAH cations, it resolves one of the greatest discrepancies with 
the interstellar PAH hypothesis.

Note Added in Proof: Recent unpublished calculations on 
PAH cation integrated absorbance values (A-values) by Langhoff 
show considerable PAH to PAH variation when compared to 
the values in Table 4. The experimental values tend to be no 
more than a factor of 2 greater than the theoretical values for 
pyrene, but they are 2—3 orders of magnitude smaller for 
phenanthrene. This points out the need for a better understand- 
ing of 4-values in PAH cations.
