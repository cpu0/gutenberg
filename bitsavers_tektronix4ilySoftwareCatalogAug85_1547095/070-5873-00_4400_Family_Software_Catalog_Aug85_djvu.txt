PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 

Product Name: Smalltalk-80 

Function: Artificial Intelligence Programming Language 

Description: 

Smalltalk-80 is an object-oriented programming language with a sophisticated 
window/mouse oriented user interface. It is especially suited for exploratory 
programming because it allows rapid prototyping and experimentation. 

Smalltalk-80 as available on the 4400 Series of Artificial Intelligence Systems is a 
highly optimized, proprietary implementation which achieves execution speeds only 
exceeded by systems costing over five times as much. Graphic response is fast enough 
to support screen animation under direct control of Smalltalk. 

Smalltalk-80 provides a robust, integrated programming environment using pop-up 
menus and windows. Smalltalk code can be input and edited, incrementally compiled 
in a few seconds, debugged and executed without leaving Smalltalk. Smalltalk's 
object oriented nature allows problems to be described symbolically and grouped into 
classes where both multiple and hierarchical inheritance allows each new member to 
inherit aspects of its parent classes. Smalltalk is extended by defining new classes 
which are subclasses of existing classes yielding improvements in programmer 
productivity.

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 

Product Name: FRANZ LISP 
Function: Programming Language 

Description: 

Franz Lisp is the most widely distributed and extensively used implementation of 
LISP. Franz Lisp was developed at the University of California at Berkeley for 
research work in symbolic manipulation, expert systems, and other Artificial 
Intelligence projects. Several large AI programs have been written using Franz Lisp 
including OPS5, Macsyma, Reduce, Pearl, and others. 

Franz Lisp is similar to Maclisp, a version of lisp available on the DEC 10 and 20 
product line. Programs written in other dialects of Lisp can be merged and run under 
Franz Lisp by the use of compiler declarations and environment libraries. Franz Lisp 
has been designed to make interfaces to non-Lisp application programs in C or Fortran 
quite convenient. Tek 4400 Family users can take full advantage of graphics libraries 
provided in C. 

Software written in Franz Lisp on a variety of machines can usually be downloaded, 
recompiled, and executed on the Tek 4400 Family without any modifications being 
required, protecting software investments. 

Documentation for Franz Lisp has been recently augmented by a textbook written by 
Prof. Robert Wilensky, of the University of California at Berkeley. The book is 
entitled LISPcraft and was published in 1984 by W.W. Norton.

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 

Product Name: MPROLOG 
Function: Programming Language 

Dacription: 

Mprolog is a programming language used in artificial intelligence applications where 
problems are solved by specifying what answers are needed rather than describing a 
detailed solution procedure. Mprolog is non-procedural, based entirely on facts, rules, 
and logical relationships. 

Once known relationships between the elements of a problem are established in the 
knowledge base, Mprolog can make logical inferences from the relationships when 
queried by the user. Mprolog can explain how the conclusion was derived. Mprolog 
also offers a complete development environment for enhancing programmer 
productivity. The Mprolog Program Development Support System (PDSS) is an 
integrated system with editing and debugging tools. 

Since the Mprolog interpreter is accessible from PDSS, predicate definitions can be 
tested immediately. Program modules can also be translated into binary format to 
yield more compact and efficient executable programs.

EXPERT SYSTEMS 

Product Name: KES 

Function: Environment for implementing Interactive expert systems 

Description: 

The Knowledge Engineering System (KES) is an environment and support tool for 
implementing interactive expert systems. The purpose of KES-developed expert 
systems is to enable users to make decisions related to domain-independent, i.e., it is 
not restricted to any one knowledge area because the system and the knowledge base 
are strictly separated. In order to build an expert system using KES the domain 
expert need only create a file which contains the necessary expertise to be used in 
solving a problem. No knowledge of programming or artificial intelligence techniques 
is required. KES accepts the knowledge base file and converts it into a form suitable 
for combination with the expert system software. This separation of the knowledge 
base and the system software allows the development of a variety of knowledge bases, 
each of which can be utilized by the system to produce operational expert systems. 

KES has three separate subsystems, each with its own method of representing 
knowledge and making inferences. The production rule subsystem has knowledge 
represented as conditional rules that are used by a consequent-driven rule interpreter. 
In the hypothesize-and-test subsytem knowledge is represented by descriptive frames; 
the inference engine is based on the mininal set cover theory and is capable of 
evaluating multiple hypotheses simultaneously. In the Bayes subsystem the knowledge 
is in tables of prior and conditional probabilities. Among the advantages of KES are 
its ease of use, both for a knowledge base author and an end-user; and the fact that it 
is fully supported and documented and has a proven record in a variety of 
applications.

EXPERT SYSTEMS 

Product Name: RuleMaster 

Function: A software tool for building expert systems 

Description: 

Rulemaster is a flexible set of software tools that can be used in the development of 
expert systems. The RuleMaster expert system building package contains two 
principal components: RuleMaker, for inducing rules from examples, and Radial, an 
interpreted language for expressing and executing rules. 

RuleMaster knowledge is in a form of a highly structured rule set. Rules are 
modularized and can be developed and tested separately. Control can be easily 
specified within each module and between modules to produce the effect of forward or 
backward chaining. Because of the structuring available in RuleMaster, a problem can 
be broken down into small components. Each rule is developed separately as an 
individual module by entering examples to specify particular cases. 

RuleMaster has the ability to explain lines of reasoning, access other information 
sources, and interface to any user's code in various languages. 

Radial is a block structured, interpreted language for expressing and executing rules 
based on finite state machine theory. It offers the same visibility and scoping rules as 
Pascal and Algol, and allows users to define abstract data types and associated 
operators specific to an application. This can be used to make Radial rules expressible 
in a form very close to the natural language of each domain.

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 

Product Name: OPS5 

Function: Programming Language for production systems 

Description: 

OPS5 is a member of a class of programming languages known as production systems. 
A production system is a program composed entirely of conditional statements called 
productions. A production is similar to an IF-THEN statement in conventional 
programming languages. IF certain conditions are true, THEN some action is 
performed. 

Unlike other conventional languages, OPS5 does not use variables to assign values or 
to keep the "state" of the application. Instead, a working memory is loaded with 
expressions to reflect existing operating conditions. Also, a conventional program uses 
sequential execution of statements plus a number of control constructs such as 
subroutine calls, loops, and conditional branching. A production system like OPS5 
uses LHS (left hand side or the IF part of an IF-THEN statement) satisfaction. 

Each production's LHS is a description of the states in which the production is 
applicable; the LHS becomes true when there is information in working memory that 
the production can process. When the interpreter performs the match process, it is in 
effect searching for a production that knows how to process the data that is in working 
memory. When it finds that production and executes its RHS (right hand side or the 
THEN part of an IF-THEN statement), working memory is changed, and so on the 
next cycle, the interpreter performs the match again to find a production that can 
handle the new data. 

OPS5 is used primarily for applications in the areas of artificial intelligence, expert 
systems, and cognitive psychology.

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 

Product Name: OPS83 

Function: Programming Language for production systems 

Description: 

OPS83, like OPS5, is a member of a class of programming languages known as 
production systems. OPS83 incorporates a new, proprietary compiler technology that 
makes it substantially faster (30 times) than OPS5. OPS83 is very compact. More 
memory is therefore available for application programs. This allows larger and more 
complex knowledge-based systems to be developed. 

OPS83 can be conceived as two sublanguages, an imperative sublanguage, which 
incorporates the features of C or PASCAL, and a rule-based sublanguage, which has 
similar features as other members of the OPS family. OPS83 supports modular 
development and separate compilation. See the description of OPS5 for more 
information on the rule-based sublanguage, and in particular, production systems. 

OPS83 is used primarily for applications in the areas of artificial intelligence, expert 
systems, and cognitive psychology.

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 

Product Name: OBJECTIVE-C 

Function: Adds object-oriented programming to C 

Dctcription: 

Objective-C is a compiler which accepts the full C language plus message and object 
extensions developed by Productivity Products International. 

Objective-C operates between the pre-processor and the additional compiler passes 
available in C. It adds to C the run-time semantics of Smalltalk-80 including dynamic 
messaging, objects, classes, inheritance and encapsulation. The effect is a language 
which combines the outstanding productivity of message/object programming with the 
efficiency and portability of C. Since full access to the C language is retained, the 
programmer is free to mix object-oriented and conventional concepts within the same 
program. 

Programmers currently developing code in the C language can gracefully evolve to 
Objective-C and maintain complete compatibility with the past.

EDITORS AND TEXT PROCESSORS 

Product Name: EMACS 
Function: Document Editor 

Description: 

The version of EMACS used on the 4400 Series of AI Systems is the Emacs screen 
editor, version 264, from Unipress Software, Inc., with minor changes and additions. 

There are two major editors called Emacs. The first was written at MIT for their ITS 
systems as an extension to TECO. This editor is the spiritual father of all Emacs-like 
editors; its principal author was Richard Stallman. The other editor called Emacs was 
also written at MIT, but it was written in MacLisp for Multics by Bernie Greenberg. 
This editor picked up where the ITS Emacs editor left off in terms of extension 
facilities. 

The Unipress Software, Inc., Emacs and thus the 4400 Series Emacs are modeled on 
these two versions of Emacs, but may include some features those do not have and 
leave out others they do have. Almost all of the commands from the original versions 
of Emacs are included in the 4400 Series Emacs.

Product Name: Lisp Intelligent Tutoring System 
Function: Computer-based training on Lisp 

Description: 

The Lisp Intelligent Tutor is a computer-based tutor designed to be as effective in 
teaching Lisp as a human tutor. Based on artificial intelligence techniques, Lisp 
Intelligent Tutor provides effective instruction in problem solving the way a human 
tutor does, an approach known as intelligent tutoring. 

The Lisp Intelligent Tutor provides a friendly environment for the student working on 
a problem. Whenever the student makes a planning or coding error or asks for help, 
the Lisp Intelligent Tutor provides helpful information to guide them back to a correct 
path to the solution. The Lisp Intelligent Tutor has an ideal model containing 
programming knowledge ideal students use in solving problems. This allows the Lisp 
Intelligent Tutor to monitor a student's progress and discover and instruct about 
errors. 

If the student is having difficulty, the Lisp Intelligent Tutor will provide guidance by 
hinting toward the correct solution. Hints take the form of queries and reminders 
about current goals or if necessary, the next piece of code so that the student may 
continue. 

A structured editor is also provided which balances parentheses and provides 
placeholders for function arguments. The student is relieved of the burden of 
balancing parentheses and checking syntax, enabling them to focus on the more 
conceptually difficult aspects of Lisp. 

The Lisp Intelligent Tutor provides 10 or more lessons in Lisp, each taking from one to 
four hours to complete. A good review of the Lisp Intelligent Tutor can be found in 
the April, 1985 issue of Byte Magazine.

Demolmage.trbl is a Smalltalk-80 image file that contains a sample expert system 
developed at Tek Labs for troubleshooting a Tektronix function generator product 
called the FG502. Demolmage.trbl is strictly an example of how an expert system 
could conceivably be developed in Smalltalk-80 and is not designed as an expert 
system shell or generic expert system for troubleshooting products. 

Demolmage.trbl makes extensive use of the 4400 Family's graphic display system, with 
multiple windows including: l) an electronic components part list window, 2) a part 
description window, 3) a schematic diagram window, 4) a window containing a graphic 
representation of the primary circuit board used in the FG502, 5) a troubleshooting 
advice window, and 6) a window showing rules in effect during any diagnosis taking 
place. 

All windows display information pertinent to a part under selection - as a part from 
the part list is selected, a relevant description is shown and the part's location on the 
schematic diagram and circuit board is highlighted. 

During the diagnosis phase of the troubleshooter, a series of questions are answered by 
the technician using the system and a service diagnosis is generated.
