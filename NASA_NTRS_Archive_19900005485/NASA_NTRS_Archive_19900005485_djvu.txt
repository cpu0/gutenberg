AN SSE APPROACH TO REUSABILITY 


N90- 14801 


David L. Badal 

Lockheed Missiles and Spacecraft Co. 


The SSE project has engineering analysis and design efforts under way for the development of 
the SSE reusability library management system. An ad hoc committee on reuse has been meet- 
ing for several months identifying design considerations and learning about Ruben Prieto-Diaz 
faceted classification, CAMP domain analysis, SPC activities, SEI activities, and SPS activities. 
A standard format was developed for the Ada prologue for reusable components (both 
specification and body). The SSE reusability process can be viewed as a transformation pro- 
cess with minimized losses and difficulties.
