AFRL Releases Audit Trail Viewer (ATV) 

By Mr. Alex Sarnacki, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/IFSB) 




he Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) 
Information Directorate has officially released the 
Audit Trail Viewer (ATV). The ATV was created as a 
replacement for IVIEW 2000 and was initially devel¬ 
oped to support the display of air engagement simula¬ 
tions at the National Air Intelligence Center at Wright- 
Patterson AFB, OH. Written in Java, the ATV is cross 
platform capable and will operate in both the 
Windows and Unix Operating Systems. Support for 
the Macintosh platform will be available in the near 
future. The ATV allows visualization, playback, and 
analysis of a variety of recorded simulation file types. 


The current release of the ATV allows for the visuali¬ 
zation of recorded simulation audit trails from the fol¬ 
lowing list of simulation file formats; BlueMax, IView 
2000 ASCII, IView-style Suppressor, IView-style 
Brawler, JMASS (partially implemented), JWARS, 
MIL-AASPEM 2.0, SimView, Trap 3.1, and UCAVSim. 
The ATV supports the 3D representation of the simu¬ 
lation entities as either Wavefront.obj models or .gif 
files with newer formats coming shortly, such as 
Microsoft’s flight simulator MDL, Open Flight FLT, 
and VRML.

In this view, captured 
from the Audit Trail 
Viewer, the analyst 
obtained a close up 
view of the detailed 
aircraft model using 
the Orbit View, 
enabled the SkyBox, 
enabled fictional ter¬ 
rain, displayed affilia¬ 
tion sensitive past and 
future trails, and 
enabled the bottom 
and one side of the 
bounded grid.

The ATV was built using the JView Application 
Programmers Interface (API) that was also developed at 
AFRL. JView is a 3D runtime configurable and plat¬ 
form independent visualization API upon which robust 
applications can be built. It is written entirely in Java 
and utilizes the GL4Java API to gain 3D hardware 
graphics acceleration. It has been developed using con¬ 
crete Object Oriented Design and Programming tech¬ 
niques to provide a robust and venue non-specific visu¬ 
alization environment. It has been designed to let the 
software developer take advantage of 3D graphics with¬ 
out having extensive knowledge of such graphics. Using 
JView may dramatically reduce development time of 
new applications. JView provides a variety of pre-built 
components that the developer can take advantage of, 
such as, DTED loaders, user interface device drivers, 
model loaders, geometric shapes, artificial environments, 
a complete 3D graphics engine, and many other tools. 



This figure shows the Audit Trail Viewer displaying an IView compatible simulation run from the Trajectory Analysis 
Program. In this view the analyst has a 3D Orbiting View, a 2D Graph of the simulation's X-axis versus Time, and the 
location of the entities in the scene. The F-18 model was assigned from the Model Assignment panel and the simple 
flare.gif image was used for the countermeasures. The control panel on the right is displayed for the current active view, 
as specified by the red border. 



This is a view from the screen capture functionality of the Audit 
Trail Viewer. In this example the analyst is displaying a config¬ 
urable sensor cone representing the seeker of the missile with 
affiliation sensitive trails. A bottom bounded grid is also being 
displayed with associated element projections, allowing the user 
to better understand the entitie's location in the 3D scene.

The ATV’s suite of built-in support tools complement 
the 3D visualization of the simulation result. It gives 
the user the ability for multiple, simultaneous views, 
consisting of 3D, text data, and/or graphs. All views 
update simultaneously in real time during the playback 
of the simulation audit trail. It also has the ability to do 
2D graphing and plotting of any of the following vari¬ 
ables; time, location, orientation, component velocity, 
and mach. Other features include displaying of config¬ 
urable bounding grids and element projections to those 
grids, affiliation sensitive coloring for trails and element 
projections, several simulated terrain types and Skybox 
environments to help the user maintain perspective, file 
based configuration for all 3D settings allowing settings 
to be saved and then loaded up each time you start the 
application, configurable geometry cones to simulate 
coverage areas, vectors, configurable screen layouts, and 
built in screen capture support. 

User interaction with the 3D environment can be per¬ 
formed using the keyboard, mouse, and, optionally, 
Logitech’s Magellan 3D input device. The ATV has 
three different camera positioning tools. The Observer 
View is a free flight mode which allows the user to 
position themselves at any point in space, the Trail

- Component Vulnerability Analysis Archive (CVAA) 
Users Group Meeting to Be Held 


The SURVIAC, in conjunction with the Joint Aircraft 
Survivability Program Office, JASPO, and the Joint 
Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions 
Effectiveness, JTCG/ME, would like to announce the 
impending availability of a new version of the 
Component Vulnerability Analysis Archive (CVAA). 
The CVAA is a searchable database of engineering 
methodologies, results of completed analyses, and 
supporting test data to determine the vulnerability of 
components to a wide variety of damage mechanisms. 
The CVAA contains vulnerability data on components 
from systems ranging from aircraft and lightly 
armored vehicles to hardened targets and ships. 
Damage mechanisms include penetration, blast, fire, 
and shock among others. All data in the CVAA has 
been reviewed by a group of senior vulnerability ana¬ 
lysts to ensure traceability to the original source of 
information and to clearly define limitations of data. 

The CVAA has been incorporated into SURVIAC and 
a users meeting will be held to demonstrate CVAA 
capabilities, typical usages, and procedures for adding 
data as well as a “hands on” session to perform data 
searches and develop local archives. In addition, a 
discussion of desired CVAA data additions, and avail¬ 


able data/analyses techniques will be held. The work¬ 
shop will be held at the Booz Allen Hamilton 
Dayton, Ohio facility. The Users Group Meeting will 
be held 16 June 2003. Participants in the workshop 
will receive a CD ROM with CVAA version 5.2 and 
copies of all presentations given at the workshop. A 
fee of $50 to cover administrative fees and generation 
of the notebook and of the CD ROM will be collect¬ 
ed and a receipt will be provided for reimbursement. 
In order to effectively conduct the “hands on” por¬ 
tion of the workshop, participation will be limited to 
25 people. Slots will be allocated on a first come first 
served basis. 

If you have questions regarding the CVAA Users 
Group Meeting, or have data for inclusion or topics 
you would like covered, please contact:
