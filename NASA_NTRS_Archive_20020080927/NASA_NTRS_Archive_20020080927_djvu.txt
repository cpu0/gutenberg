M assaeh u setts m anufa cl u res 
MM physical security systems for 
a wide range of government and 
business users (below). These 
systems include many types of 
security devices, such as card 
validation, alarm monitoring, 
closed circuit TV, video badging 
and biometric identification 
systems. 

Software House’s primary 
securin' management system is 
the C* CURES ystem I Plus™; The 
photo at right shows the 
C*CLJRESystem 1 Plus family of 
products. The software based 
system may he used with a vari- 
ety o! access control hardware at 
installations ranging from indi- 


vidual or remote 
locations to 
multiple integrat- 
ed networks 
around the 
world. Advanced 
software 
programs enable 
C * CU RES y stem 
! Plus users to 
manage large 
amounts of infor- 
mation and to solve unique 
security problems; they also 
provide power over access 
control with time schedules, 
authorization levels, door entry 
with card validation, and exten- 
sive reporting capabilities. 

In addition. C*CURESystem 


I Plus provides access lo orher 
information management tools, 
such as the NASA expert devel- 
opment tool named CLIPS. 

Using CLIPS, Software House 
integrates software and hardware 
to solve problems that might 
arise with the various access 
control systems. The expert 
system software prototype asks 
a series of questions about what 
the hardware is doing or not 
doing; from the given answers, 
the program makes recommen- 
dations on possible routes to 
check and what might be 
causing the problem, CLIPS 
enabled Software House to 
develop new generations of 
hardware that allow problem 
solution by a non-expert person 
with fast response. 

CLIPS was developed by 
Johnson Space Center and 
was supplied to Software 
House by the Computer Soft- 
ware Management and Informa- 
tion Center f COSMIC)®, a 
N AS A- s pc mso red n tec h a n ism 
for making available at nominal 
cost government-developed 
computer programs that have 
secondary applicability (see 
page 140). •
