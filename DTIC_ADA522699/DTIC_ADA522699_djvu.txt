Computational Solutions for 

Today's Navy 

New methods are being employed to meet the Navy's changing software- 
development environment.

T he Naval Research Labor¬ 
atory (NRL) is the corpor¬ 
ate laboratory for the 
United States Navy. Part of the 
mission of NRL is to provide 
"broadly based applied research 
and advanced technology develop¬ 
ment programs in response to 
identified and anticipated Navy 
and Marine Corps needs". Advan¬ 
cing the state-of-the-art in sci¬ 
entific computation is important in 
both applied research and techno¬ 
logy development. In this article, 
we relate current computational 
trends in naval technologies as 
well as the trends we anticipate 
over the next few years. We also 
present solutions for some of the 
current and coming challenges we 
face. 

Naval operations can benefit 
greatly from a highly accurate and 
timely knowledge of the environ¬ 
ment. Specifically, mine-hunting 
operations require knowledge of 
the seafloor composition and 
oceanographic conditions which 
include the temperature, density, 
water clarity, and depth of the wa¬ 
ter, the speed of ocean currents, 
and wave heights. Naval person¬ 
nel use a combination of historic¬ 
al, real-time, and predicted data 


about these conditions. 

Sea-based computing 

Sea basing refers to a major 
thrust in future naval capabilit¬ 
ies from the Office of Naval Re¬ 
search where "logistics, ship¬ 
ping, and at-sea transfer tech¬ 
nologies support joint opera¬ 
tional independence". This ap¬ 
plies equally well to environ¬ 


mental data processing. Indeed, 
in recent years, we have no¬ 
ticed an increasing shift to¬ 
wards computationally intensive 
data processing in the field, 
fleet, and during survey opera¬ 


tions as opposed to collecting and 
processing data at centralized fa¬ 
cilities. Contributing to this shift 
is the development and manufac¬ 
turing of affordable and compact 
(yet powerful) workstations. Since 
computers meeting both budget 
and space constraints are now 
widely available, these machines 
may be installed in the ship or 
other vehicle along with the ne¬ 


cessary software. In this way, 
rather than depending on the reli¬ 
ability and data-transfer rates of 
the communication links, operat¬ 
ors can use onboard data pro¬ 
cessing to make real-time de- 



OLD WAY of doing business: Computing power is located at shore-based 
production facilities that determine and distribute the "best" environment.

cisions. While not exactly a new 
method, defense organizations are 
increasingly processing data in 
the field or at sea. 

The most important demands 
on computing systems resulting 
from the sea-based computing 
model are twofold-portability and 
efficiency . While software devel¬ 
opment targets usability in the 
field, expert analysts must also be 
able to use the same software in 
their office spaces, either for fur¬ 
ther analysis or to process 
archived data, often with a differ¬ 
ent platform. Cross-platform com¬ 
puter languages such as C + + with 


sea requires large amounts of 
data to be analyzed efficiently, 
in fact, in real-time. Modern 
compiled languages (e.g. C, C + 
+, Fortran 95) are well suited 
for speedy computations, 
however, good software design 
is the most important factor in 
program efficiency. 

Through-the-Sensor techno- 
logy 

In addition to sea-based com¬ 
puting, there is a definite trend 
towards techniques that allow 
environmental data to be ex¬ 
tracted from tactical feet 


for scientific purposes. 

Software aids are used to help 
make tactical decisions by military 
operators. These decision aids 
use environmental inputs, and 
then output optimal methods for 
finding targets. Actual 
environmental (not historical) 
data is needed to yield accurate 
answers. 

Through-the-Sensor (TTS) 
techniques use tactical sensors to 
acquire environmental informa¬ 
tion in situ. This new information 
is used to refresh historical hold¬ 
ings. Using TTS data, decision 
aids can provide answers based

NEW WAY of doing business: Computing power is located at sea and ashore. "Best" environment is determined on-scene 
using new in situ data to refresh historical data. 


Qt (Trolltech) or Java (Sun Mi¬ 
crosystems) are especially useful 
for these applications. Not only 
must computing solutions be port¬ 
able, processing in the field or at 


sensors 1 . This requires com¬ 
puter systems to have the flex¬ 
ibility to acquire and process 
data from combat sensors 
rather than sensors designed 


on actual versus historical condi¬ 
tions. The challenge is to collect, 
process, fuse, and disseminate 
TTS data in near real-time. The 
benefit is lowered operational risk

and accurate time lines based on 
actual conditions. 

Recent technological solutions 

NRL and the Naval Oceano¬ 
graphic Office have recently de¬ 
veloped the Environmental Post 
Mission Analysis (EPMA) system 
to manage the integration of these 
types of data. The EPMA collects 
data from tactical sidescan sonars 
(Through-the-Sensor technology), 
supercomputer generated numer¬ 
ical models, and historical/clima¬ 
tological databases. It uses a vari¬ 
ety of fusion algorithms to merge 
those sources into a single best 
view of the naval environment. 

The EPMA is developed in C+ + 
with Qt and is used on Windows, 
Linux, and UNIX platforms; all of 
which appear both at various 
Navy installations and on Naval 
ships (sea-based technology). 

Another recent example of the 
need for sea-based technology is 
the requirement for sediment 
identification at the ocean floor 
during naval oceanographic sur¬ 
veys. In the past, locations for nu¬ 
merous sediment core samples 
were chosen prior to embarking 
on a survey. NRL has since de¬ 
veloped SediMap® 23 to enable the 
mapping of sediments during the 
survey itself. SediMap® uses the 


Java Runtime Environment for 
the capability of executing on a 
number of different platforms. 
To maximize efficiency, a num¬ 
ber of tests were conducted to 
determine the optimal conver¬ 
gence rate for sediment-size es¬ 
timates without sacrificing ac¬ 
curacy. The software runs in 
real-time as data is collected 
and may either be installed on 
the onboard computer or simply 
run off the CD. 

Further examples of 
Through-the-Sensor data ac¬ 
quisition are the extraction of 
bathymetry and surficial sea¬ 
floor sediment types from the 
UQN-4 fathometer on mine 
counter-measures (MCM) ships, 
the BQN-17 submarine fatho¬ 
meter, and the AN/AQS-20A 
mine-hunting system (which 
also yields multibeam bathy¬ 
metry). These data are needed 
in anti-submarine and mine¬ 
hunting decision aids to determ¬ 
ine tactics. 

Conclusions 

To better utilize large quant¬ 
ities of environmental data, the 
Navy is moving towards sea- 
based computing, which allows 
decisions to be made in real¬ 
time at sea. Also, Through-the- 


Sensor technology is being de¬ 
veloped for existing/future fleet 
combat sensors to be used in tac¬ 
tical decision aids. These ad¬ 
vances will help the US Navy 
maintain sea supremacy in today's 
fast-paced war-fighting environ¬ 
ment.
