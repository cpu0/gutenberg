x-archive-meta-description: Ames Research Center, a vital field installation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, has a long tradition of award-winning advances in aeronautical, space, and life science research. The center has completed the first step of a comprehensive strategic planning program to ensure its continued effectiveness as a national research laboratory in support of the nation's aeronautical and space goals. This step resulted in the identification of key areas in which Ames can provide unique capabilities and make significant contributions to major agency initiatives in the next decade. The path to the 21st Century is one which will bring continued distinction to Ames Research Center for outstanding contributions to science and technology through its exceptional personnel and premier facilities.
