Report Title 

Final Report for "Hardware-Assisted Large-Seale Neuroevolution for Multiagent Learning" 

ABSTRACT 

This DURIP equipment award was used to purehase, install, and bring on-line two Berkeley Emulation Engines (BEEs) and two mini-BEE 
maehines to establish an FPGA-based high-performanee multiagent training platform and its assoeiated software. This aequisition of BEE4- 
W (Berkeley Emulation Engine) hardware platforms has eosted $201,500.00 in total. 

To aeeelerate both the multiagent software simulation and hardware development, a DELL integrated eluster environment unit was 
purehased, featuring 192 2.8 GHz proeessors (on 24 nodes) with 384 GB high- speed RAM on an Infiniband baekbone. We also installed 
eluster eontrol software and lieenses for the UBUNTU-based Linux operating system. Soft-ware was installed ineluding JAVA and C/C++ 
eompiler suites (debuggers, performanee measurements, ete.), the Xilinx ISE software suite, and the Matlab software. The system was 
ordered in late 2012 and arrived in early 2013 and was up and running routinely with loeal users in a few weeks. This delay of equipment 
arrival is largely due to the faet that all 

BeeCube systems are highly eustomized hardware. Numerous researeh groups at UCF have made extensive use of the DURIP eluster, 
running several different versions of Xilinx ISE design suite. This DURIP award has greatly inereased turnaround time and produetivity for 
these groups. Speeifieally, the purehased equipments have enhaneed ongoing DARPA and ARO funded aetivities. Several exploratory 
researeh tasks using these new equipments are eurrently un¬ 
dergoing at UCF to 1) alleviate the eomputing performanee bottleneek imposed by software-based simulation while eondueting multiagent 
learning researeh, 2) signifieantly inerease the multiagent HyperNEAT learning intensity to faeilitate solving real-world problems, 3) enable 
training teams at mueh larger sizes than previously possible in simulation, and 4) make training adaptive neural networks with genuine 
synaptie plastieity feasible. In the long term, 

this equipment aequisition ean expand the researeh eapability at the University of Central Florida (UCF) in the area of Roboties, Artifieial 
Intelligenee (AI), and evolvable hardware by forging a elose eollaboration between two researeh teams at UCF: one foeusing on multiagent 
robot training (based on HyperNEAT teehnology and a hive brain) and the other on high-performanee reeonfigurable eomputing (BCM, 
MARC, and evolvable hardware). 

To date, we have built the proposed hardware platform largely based on the existing teehnology of our Evolutionary Complexity Researeh 
Group (EPlex) and High-Performanee Reeonfigurable Computing Laboratory. Currently, we are foeusing on developing a probabilistie 
eomputing engine for high-performanee eonvolutions. This is motivated by the faet that both eonvolution and eorrelation are fundamental 
building bloeks in sealable multiagent learning and training a multiagent hive brain. In addition, this equipment aequisition 
has enabled us for the first time to set up a praetieal edueational platform at UCF. In this semester, we have experimented with using the 
purehased platforms for hardware software eo-design elass. In the long term, we believe that all these outeome from the proposed equipment 
aequisition ean benefit various tasks relevant to DoD missions in the field, sueh as dynamie eordoning, eoordinated surveillanee, and multi¬ 
robot teleoperation.

1 Executive Summary 

This DURIP equipment award was used to purchase, install, and bring on-line two Berkeley 
Emulation Engines (BEEs) and two mini-BEE machines to establish an FPGA-based high- 
performance multiagent training platform and its associated software. This acquisition of 
BEE4-W (Berkeley Emulation Engine) hardware platforms has costed $201,500.00 in total. 
To accelerate both the multiagent software simulation and hardware development, a DELL 
integrated cluster environment unit was purchased, featuring 192 2.8 GHz processors (on 
24 nodes) with 384 GB high- speed RAM on an Inhniband backbone. We also installed 
cluster control software and licenses for the UBUNTU-based Linux operating system. Soft¬ 
ware was installed including JAVA and G/G-I--I- compiler suites (debuggers, performance 
measurements, etc.), the Xilinx ISE software suite, and the Matlab software. The system 
was ordered in late 2012 and arrived in early 2013 and was up and running routinely with 
local users in a few weeks. This delay of equipment arrival is largely due to the fact that all 
BeeGube systems are highly customized hardware. Numerous research groups at UGF have 
made extensive use of the DURIP cluster, running several different versions of Xilinx ISE 
design suite. This DURIP award has greatly increased turnaround time and productivity 
for these groups. 

Specihcally, the purchased equipments have enhanced ongoing DARPA and ARO funded 
activities. Several exploratory research tasks using these new equipments are currently un¬ 
dergoing at UGF to 1) alleviate the computing performance bottleneck imposed by software- 
based simulation while conducting multiagent learning research, 2) signihcantly increase the 
multiagent HyperNEAT learning intensity to facilitate solving real-world problems, 3) en¬ 
able training teams at much larger sizes than previously possible in simulation, and 4) make 
training adaptive neural networks with genuine synaptic plasticity feasible. In the long term, 
this equipment acquisition can expand the research capability at the University of Gentral 
Florida (UGF) in the area of Robotics, Artihcial Intelligence (AI), and evolvable hardware 
by forging a close collaboration between two research teams at UGF; one focusing on multi¬ 
agent robot training (based on HyperNEAT technology and a hive brain) and the other on 
high-performance reconhgurable computing (BGM, MARG, and evolvable hardware). 

To date, we have built the proposed hardware platform largely based on the existing 
technology of our Evolutionary Gomplexity Research Group (EPlex) and High-Performance 
Reconhgurable Gomputing Laboratory. Gurrently, we are focusing on developing a proba¬ 
bilistic computing engine for high-performance convolutions. This is motivated by the fact 
that both convolution and correlation are fundamental building blocks in scalable multia¬ 
gent learning and training a multiagent hive brain. In addition, this equipment acquisition 
has enabled us for the hrst time to set up a practical educational platform at UGF. In this 
semester, we have experimented with using the purchased platforms for hardware software 
co-design class. In the long term, we believe that all these outcome from the proposed 
equipment acquisition can beneht various tasks relevant to DoD missions in the held, such 
as dynamic cordoning, coordinated surveillance, and multi-robot teleoperation.

BEE (Berkeley Emulation Engine) Platform 



Figure 1: Interconnect Network Architecture of a BEE platform. 

We purchased the Berkeley Emulation Engine (BEE 4) platforms to establish an FPGA- 
based high-performance multiagent training platform. The Berkeley Emulation Engine 
(BEE4) is a commercial, stackable full speed multi-FPGA based prototyping platform, in¬ 
tegrated with DAG/ADG modules for mixed signal and digital communications designs. 


2 


























Specifically, each BEE4 system or module consists of 4 Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGAs based on 
a unique HPC (High Performance Computing) Honeycomb architecture, which allow us to 
build application-specihc computing platform to replace a large number of computers. Each 
BEE4 module supports a variety of high-end Virtex-6 FPGAs, including LXT 240/365/550 
and SXT 315/475, allowing BEE4 to support 20 MGate designs per module, or 400 MGates 
per rack, all of which are interconnected through high-speed links. This FPGA-based com¬ 
puting platform can 1) significantly increase the number of evaluations possible in multia¬ 
gent HyperNEAT learning to facilitate solving real-world problems, 2) enable training teams 
at much larger sizes than previously possible in simulation, and 3) make adaptive neural 
networks through synaptic plasticity feasible. All these benehts can alleviate the computing 
performance bottleneck imposed by software-based simnlation while condncting mnltiagent 
learning research. In addition, BEE4 modules can be stacked or clustered to increase ca¬ 
pacity withont losing speed, which is critical as we scale np the size of onr mnltiagent robot 
training system. Finally, because of the versatility of the BEE4 platform, this facility can 
serve the research and teaching needs of several faculty members in our department and 
enhance onr research in these areas. 


4 Examples of Usage 

The two DARPA-sponsored projects, the Real-world Scalable Multiagent Learning for Coor¬ 
dinated UGV Operations (Period: 8/11 - 8/12; Amonnt: $249,347; PI: Kenneth O. Stanley; 
Program Manager: James Donlon) and the Training a Multiagent Hive Brain for Coordi¬ 
nated UCV Operations (Period: 9/11-9/14; Amonnt: $150,000 in Erst year; PI: Kenneth 
O. Stanley; Program Manager: Pnrush Iyer) have made extensive use of the computational 
cluster. (These projects are given highest priority usage.) When the hardware emulation en¬ 
gines constrncted with BEE4 platforms are hnished, these two projects will use the hardware 
platforms extensively. 

4.1 Main Task I: High-Throughput FPGA-based Multiagent Train¬ 
ing Platform 

We are cnrrently using the reconhgurable hardware within the pnrchased BEE4 platforms 
to constrnct a high thronghpnt FPGA-based mnltiagent training platform capable of eval- 
nating probabilistic networks with arbitrary DAG (directed acyclic graph) topology. We 
have hnished building the application-specihc processor cores that are specihcally tailored 
for mnltiagent training. We are working on constructing application-specihc memory access 
network to signihcantly improve the memory bandwidth by avoiding “Von-Nenmann bottle¬ 
neck” . Eventnally, we plan to replace networks between clustered computer with high-speed 
inter-FPGA links with 200 times more bandwidth. 

The above scheme has been built on the top of our previous work work of building 
large-scale Bayesian Gompnting Machine using reconhgurable logic, where we successfully 


3 



developed a high throughput Bayesian computing machine (BCM) that not only can be 
applied to many important algorithms in artificial intelligence, signal processing, and digital 
communications, but also has high reusability, i.e., a new application needs not change a 
BCM’s hardware design, only new task graph processing and code compilation are necessary. 
In this DURIP effort, we are currently working on make the computing architecture of BCM 
to scale linearly with the size of the FPGA on which it is implemented. Because of our 
success with Bayesian computing machine containing 16 processing nodes in a Virtex-5 
FPGA (XCV5LX155T-2), especially because of the strong similarity in computing pattern 
between evolving neural network and Bayesian network computing, we are quite optimistic 
that the similar two orders of magnitude of performance improvement in BCM can also be 
achieved in the proposed multiagent training platform against a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo Intel 
processor and a GeForce 9400m using the CUBA software package. In addition, we expect 
that all these huge perform improvements are obtained with only tens of Watts while the 
reference GPU platform consumed more than 200 Watts. 

The architecture of our hardware-assisted multiagent platform was highly optimized for 
training large-scale neural networks. More specifically: 

• Each processing node only implements the minimum hardware required for the nec¬ 
essary neural network computation. Unlike in conventional parallel processors imple¬ 
mented with ASIC technology, where the pipeline stages seldom exceed 10 due to data 
dependencies, in the proposed multiagent training platform, we pipeline each process¬ 
ing node to 20~30 in order to maximize the throughput. Furthermore, instead of 
building sophisticated control circuitry to handle data or instruction hazards, the mul¬ 
tiagent training platform completely avoids dependencies by pre-processing the com¬ 
puting task graph and strategically allocating memory for intermediate results during 
the execution. 

• The memory of the multiagent neural substrates is physically distributed in order to 
take advantage of the massively distributed memory blocks in a modern FPGA. The 
communication between processors and memories is handled by two separate crossbar 
switches. Combined with pre-processing of the computing task graph in the com¬ 
pilation phase, our novel memory allocation scheme can effectively avoid any data 
dependency and memory hazards. 

• As for each processing node, the scheduler that controls the two crossbars is also deeply 
pipelined to improve the throughput. Given the fact that all information needed for 
memory allocation of outgoing messages is available before its results, we can start 
computing the schedule right after the first stage of the processor.

4.2 Main Task II: Energy-Efficient Multiplier-Less Discrete Con¬ 
volver through Probabilistic Domain Transformation 

Large-scale convolution is a fundamental building block for all of the multiagent learning 
algorithms and many important video and image processing algorithms. Using this pur¬ 
chased BEE4 platform, we have designed a high-performance reconfigurable discrete con¬ 
volver specihcally designed for FPGA-based multiagent training processors. While the con¬ 
ventional multiplier-based architecture can only achieve our proposed architecture 

can achieve approximately 0{N) in algorithmic complexity, therefore highly scalable and en¬ 
ergy efficient. This signihcant reduction in algorithm complexity is made possible by using 
probabilistic domain transformation and several novel reconhgurable hardware techniques 
to convert computationally intensive multiplications into additions that manipulate random 
signal samples. In addition, these techniques make the proposed architecture highly fault- 
tolerant because information to be processed is encoded with probability density function 
instead of its binary forms. As such, the local perturbations of its computing accuracy or 
signal values are inconsequential to its overall results. 

To validate this proposed probabilistic architecture for discrete convolver. We have de¬ 
veloped several prototypes with Virtex 6 FPGA devices (XG6VLX550t). To further op¬ 
timize the performance of our probabilistic convolver, we developed four novel hardware 
techniques—Segmented Memory Swapping, Stochastic Mixing Scheme, Virtual Indexing 
Scheme, and Scalable Adder Extension—to minimize hardware usage and mitigate mem¬ 
ory bandwidth bottleneck. Our prototype of probabilistic convolver requires just 4.09 ps to 
perform a 128 x 128 convolution and dissipates only 166.63 nJ in dynamic energy consump¬ 
tion at 250 MHz. We believe that this new architecture can be exploited in all the real-time 
applications in which energy-efficient convolutions are required and it can be realized with 
many other FPGA device families. 

5 Summary 

The DURIP project officially started on August 15, 2012. All equipments were purchased 
within one month. However, because all FPGA platforms are custom-built, the hnal arrival 
of all these BEE4 platforms was delayed to May 2013. Fortunately, the FPGA-based high- 
performance multiagent training platform will be extensively used for at least hve years. 
After that, the platform will be upgraded. 

The purchased platforms are housed at the Gomputer Architecture Laboratory (Harris 
Engineering Genter Room 242 with additional resources in Room 238) in the School of 
Electrical Engineering and Gomputer Science at the University of Gentral Florida. The 
MARG training of defense-related engineering students has taken place through the lab 
sessions of course EEL5722c (Advance FPGA Design and Technology). 

We have included the following as “Synergistic Benehts to DoD”: 

• Research 


5 



— We developed the FPGA-based high-performance computing systems that allevi¬ 
ate the computing performance bottleneck imposed by software-based simulation 
while conducting multiagent learning research. 

— This system can signihcantly increase the multiagent HyperNEAT learning inten¬ 
sity to facilitate solving real-world problems. 

— Through this purchase, we have explored how to enable training teams at much 
larger sizes than previously possible in simulation, and make training adaptive 
neural networks with genuine synaptic plasticity feasible. 

• Education (Both Graduate and Undergraduate) 

— For the first time, we set up a practical educational platform at UGF for many of 
our students who are currently working (or will work) for defense-related industry. 

— This DURIP project provides valuable opportunities for both graduate and un¬ 
dergraduate students to learn real-world hardware design. 

All these outcome from the proposed equipment acquisition can beneht various tasks 
relevant to DoD missions in the held, such as dynamic cordoning, coordinated surveillance, 
and multi-robot teleoperation. Some of these benehts have already been realized.
