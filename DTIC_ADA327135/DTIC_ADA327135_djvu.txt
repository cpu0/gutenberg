Project Description: 

As part of the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) High Level Architecture (HLA) 
development effort, the Semi-Automated Forces (SAF) subsystems of the Close Combat Tactical Trainer 
(CCTT) were modified to support CCTT participation in the Platform Proto-Federation (PPF) 
experiment. Following the prototyping effort, DMSO sponsored continued research to support the 
evolution of HLA. 

The first phase of the HLA PPF project was conducted from March to October 1996 and focused on 
participation in the PPF experiments. Much of the project effort focused on modifying CCTT SAF and 
its use of DIS to support HLA. During this phase, the problem of DIS migration to HLA was explored, 
an HLA interface developed, and modifications made to CCTT SAF to support HLA-based information 
exchange. Working with other PPF participants, the PPF experiment concept was developed, a 
Federation Object Model (FOM) developed, and the experiment conducted. 

The second phase of the project, conducted from November 1996 through May 1997, supported the 
evolution of HLA. An IBM compatible version of the Runtime Infrastructure (RTI) version F.O was 
developed, providing accessibility for IBM users. The project also developed Ada support for HLA by 
implementing the Ada Application Programmer Interface (API) and binding code to allow the Ada API to 
work with the C++ based RTI. The second phase also involved some initial experimentation to explore 
the ability of HLA to support a particular federate’s participation in multiple federation executions.

User Objectives: 

• To conduct the PPF experiments with CCTT SAP participation. 

• To evaluate the problem of the migration of DIS-based legacy systems to HLA. 

• To develop an IBM compatible version of RTI F.O. 

• To implement the Ada API and develop necessary binding code allowing use of the C++-based RTI. 

• To conduct experiments to explore multiple federation executions. 

ADSTII Contributions: 

• HLA implementation experience for exploring DIS-based legacy system migration to HLA. 

• CCTT SAF HLA interface. 

• Ada support for HLA. 

• IBM Version of the RTI F.O 

• Two papers for the Spring 97 SIW: “Implementation of the High Level Architecture into DIS-Based 
Legacy Simulations” and “Application Programming Interfaces for the HLA Runtime Infrastmcture” 

• Produced a technical paper for SIMTECT ‘97 which took the best paper award: “Implementation of 
the High Level Architecture into DIS-Based Legacy Simulations” 

Technical Approach Summary: 

The ADST II technical approach for the first phase of the project involved working with other PPF 
participants to develop the FOM for the experiment. The project then performed the re-engineering of 
the distributed interface of CCTT SAF to use HLA instead of DIS. Modifications were made to 
accomodate the requirements of the PPF FOM. For the demonstration, engineering support was provided 
for integration, testing and conduct of the experiment. 

The phase 2 approach to port RTI F.O to the IBM platform involved coordination with Sun platform RTI 
developers to ensure that the functionality of the port was maintained and consistent with Sun RTI 
operation. A short experiment involving ModSAF running on a Sun with the Sun version of RTI F.O and 
CCTT SAF running on the IBM with the IBM ported RTI was successfully conducted. The phase 2 
development of the Ada API was closely coordinated with developers of the C++ and Java versions to 
ensure consistency between APIs. Phase 2 multifederation execution experiments were closely 
coordinated with the Federation Management Technical Exchange group which helped to identify the 
issues to be explored and provided a forum for feedback on approaches and results. 

Achievement Summary: 

• HLA support for CCTT SAF. 

• Basis for exploring DIS-system transition to HLA. 

• IBM support for RTI F.O. 

• Ada API concept verification and HLA support for Ada-based systems. 

• Initial implementation of Multiple Federation Execution concept for CCTT SAF.
