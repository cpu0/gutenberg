The Ramtek 6200A is a sophisticated, interactive computer terminal 
which provides the computer user with high resolution, raster scan 
Colorgraphics. The Ramtek 6000 Series provides to the computer 
graphics marketplace a highly-modular and flexible graphics terminal 
which gives you full color output from your computer. Ramtek gives you 
high resolution, cost-effective Colorgraphics today. 

The 6200A Colorgraphic Computer Terminal integrates the latest in 
raster scan graphics and microprocessor technology with an interpretive 
graphics programming language to provide a comprehensive 
Colorgraphics terminal. The Colorgraphic Programming Language is a 
powerful set of user-oriented commands that are easy to learn and easy 
to use. This offers graphics users an efficient way to add color to their 
existing graphics applications. It allows non-graphics users an effective 
way to move immediately to Colorgraphics. 

The 6200A has full color graphic and alphanumerics capabilities. The 
independent graphic and alphanumeric random access memories 
(RAM) may be viewed! either together or separately This provides 
maximum flexibility to the user. 

The bright, flicker-free color display may be easily viewed in typical 
ambient light conditions. And, in addition, Colorgraphics maximizes the 
utility of the information displayed. 

Teletype compatibility allows the user immediate access to his computer 
system. The 6200A has several options available to increase the 
graphics utility of the terminal in the computer graphics movement.

No one can let you 
plug in to Colorgraphics 






Ramtek. 







Color adds information and clarity to any display. 
Color increases operator efficiency. In every application, 
color works harder. 

Now, Colorgraphics from Ramtek makes it easy 
for you to upgrade your terminals. 

Easy because conversion is as simple as unplugging 
the old and plugging in the new. 

Easy, because writing programs is so 
uncomplicated you can be displaying your first 
colorgraphics in half-an-hour. 

Easy, because Colorgraphics is the only complete 
family of raster scan colorgraphics terminals. 

Easy, too, because stand-alone colorgraphics 
terminals let you develop your color software without 
costly CPU overhead. 



Finding out more is just as easy. Call your nearest 
Ramtek Office. Or, write: Ramtek, 585 N. Mary Ave., 
Sunnyvale, CA 94086. 

The complete terminal family is ready to plug in.

The Colorgraphics computer terminal family 
is the beginning of a new era in computer graphics. 



"If you are looking for true color 
graphics, there is no lower priced way 
to make the switch from monochrome 
or black-and-white than the new 6110 
Colorgraphics" 




The 6110 Colorgraphics 

• 320 x 240 x 3 graphics matrix. 

• Medium resolution 13" color 
monitor. 

• 72 x 25 alphanumerics format. 

• TV compatible format. 

• Eight graphics colors. 

• Pedestal configuration. 

• Ideal for educational, business and 
process control applications. 



"The user who is looking for a ver- 
satile, general-purpose graphics 
terminal will soon discover that the 
6200A Colorgraphics offers more 
features for the money than anything 
else around'.' 




The 6200A Colorgraphics 

• 512 x 256 x 3 graphics matrix. 

• High resolution 13" color monitor. 

• 72 x 25 alphanumerics format. 

• Eight selectable colors. 

• Desktop or rack mount 
configuration. 

• Ideal for general computer graphics 
applications. 



"The critical fact about the Color- 
graphics 6310 is performance. With an 
800 x 600 displayable matrix it is sim- 
ply the highest resolution raster scan 
color terminal on the market today." 




The 6310 Colorgraphics. 

• 800 x 600 x 3 graphics matrix. 

• Ultra-high resolution 19" color monitor. 

• 72 x 24 alphanumerics format. 

• User programmable colors. 

• Color zoom/pan over the full 1024 
x 1024 memory. 

• Pedestal configuration. 

• Ideal for high resolution computer 
graphics applications such as scientific 
research and computer aided design. 



Color does more for you 

1. You can display more information 
on the screen at one time. 

2. You get another dimension for data 
display. 

3. You react faster to changes in data. 

4. You have many more choices 
when coding graphics and alpha- 
numerics. 

5. It's less boring for the user; effi- 
ciency increases. 



Two terminals in one 

Dual architecture gives you separate 
memories for graphics and alpha- 
numerics. Each terminal can function 
as either a teletype or a graphics 
terminal or both simultaneously. 
Increases your flexibility in how you 
can assign work stations and the 
kinds of tasks that can be performed 
at each. 



TTY compatible 

The family is RS 232 and CCITT (V 24) 
compatible. A serial asynchronous 
communications interface minimizes 
host interface problems. 



Total compatibility 

The Colorgraphics family is upward 
and downward compatible in soft- 
ware, options and peripherals. There 
is no wasted effort, wasted money or 
retraining required to shift from one 
model to the next. 



They stand alone 

Powerful terminal-resident firmware 
provides an easy-to-use interpreter. 
You can develop your Colorgraphics 
software off-line, without costly host 
computer overhead. 



From Ramtek, Who Else? 

Ramtek has been the innovator in 
raster scan color imaging and graphics 
technology from the first. Nobody 
knows more about it. Nobody gives 
you more ways to take advantage of its 
potential— at an affordable price.

You get true Raster Scan 
Colorgraphics 

Every plot point is addressable. In a 
character graphic system the entire 
character cell must be one color. With 
raster scan, each pixel (picture ele- 
ment) can be a different color. It adds 
versatility and effectively increases 
color resolution. 



Easy to program 

Ramtek's Colorgraphics programming 
language is an extremely high-order 
language. Commands are brief and 
intuitive. Complex graphics opera- 
tions, such as drawing a circle require 
only a single command. Operator 
training time is reduced to a minimum. 



Easy on the user 

60Hz, non-interlaced repeat field 
operation makes the display flicker- 
free. Operators can look at the display 
for longer periods without fatigue. 
The bright, easyrto-read display per- 
mits use in a wide range of lighting 
conditions.
