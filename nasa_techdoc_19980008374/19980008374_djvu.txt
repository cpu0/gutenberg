ABSTRACT 

GREENLEAF, JOHN E. Physiology of fluid and electrolyte re- 
sponses during inactivity, water immersion and bed rest. Med. Set 
Sports Exerc, Vol. 16, No. 1, pp. 20-25, 1984. This manuscript 
emphasizes the physiology of fluid-electrolyte-hormonal re- 
sponses during the prolonged inactivity of bed rest and water 
immersion. An understanding of the total mechanism of adapta- 
tion (deconditioning) should provide more insight into the con- 
ditioning process. Findings that need to be confirmed during bed 
rest and immersion are: 1) the volume and tissues of origin of 
fluid shifted to the thorax and head; 2) interstitial fluid pressure 
changes in muscle and subcutaneous tissue, particularly during 
immersion; and 3) the composition of the incoming presumably 
interstitial fluid that contributes to the early hypervolemia. Better 
resolution of the time course and source of the diuretic fluid is 
needed. Important data will be forthcoming when hypotheses are 
tested involving the probable action of the emerging diuretic and 
natriuretic hormones, between themselves and among vasopressin 
and aldosterone, on diuresis and blood pressure control.

Human physical performance is limited by three major, 
but not necessarily independent, factors: substrate for 
muscular contraction, level of hyperthermia, and main- 
tenance of consciousness (blood pressure). An important 
common denominator is water content and distribution, 
and the accompanying levels of electrolytes and protein. 
Blood, composed mainly of water, is the vehicle for de- 
livery of oxygen to the tissues, for removal of metabolic 
end products, and for transfer of metabolic heat to the 
periphery. Henderson (38) has emphasized five physical 
properties of water that facilitate life and enhance sur- 
vival potential in earthly organisms: 1) its power as the 
universal solvent; 2) its high thermal conductivity, which 
helps maintain cellular temperature constant; 3) its high 
latent heat of evaporation, which favors heat dissipation; 
4) its high specific heat, which allows for the transfer of 
large quantities of heat with relatively small changes in 
body temperature; and 5) its dielectric constant, which 
allows for a high ionization potential. 



These are the invited comments of the author which have not been evaluated 
or processed by the review procedures established by the Editorial Board 
of Madidna and Science in Sports and Exerasa. 



Water, the largest single constituent in the human body, 
comprises 55-75% of body weight in a normal, healthy, 
70-kg person; the average is about 61% (59). Total body 
water (TBW) is divided arbitrarily into that contained 
inside cells (intracellular water; 41% TBW or 29 liters) 
and that contained outside cells (extracellular water; 20% 
TBW or 14 liters). Extracellular water is further divided 
into that outside the vascular system (interstitial water; 
16% TBW or 11.2 liters) and that inside the vascular 
system (plasma water; 4% TBW or 2.8 liters). 

The plasma and interstitial fluid volumes provide the 
first line of defense against metabolic and environmental 
insult in order to protect intracellular homeostasis. Hence, 
the emphasis on understanding the physiology and dy- 
namic interchange of fluid, electrolytes, and protein be- 
tween these two compartments. Acute and chronic change 
of posture, the latter occurring with water immersion and 
bed rest, as well as increased levels of physical exercise, 
considered separately or in combination, result in large 
perturbations in extracellular fluid and electrolyte ho- 
meostasis. 

This manuscript will suggest possible directions for fu- 
ture research and will refer to, but will not provide, an 
extensive review of the literature. Emphasis will focus on 
fluid and electrolyte shifts and balance during prolonged 
inactivity, that is, water immersion and bed rest. Under- 
standing the process of deconditioning may provide in- 
sight into the conditioning adaptation syndrome. 



WATER IMMERSION 

Epstein (12) has reviewed the renal aspects of volume 
control during head-out immersion and annotated bibli- 
ographies of papers regarding physiological responses in 
mainly thermoneutral water have been prepared (34,46). 

Any change in the gravitational force acting on the body 
causes an immediate shift in fluid and electrolytes with 
accompanying compensatory cardiorespiratory re- 
sponses. Although data are few, probably the fastest re- 



FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE RESPONSES DURING INACTIVITY 



sponse is during rapid-onset head-to-foot ( + GJ accel- 
eration where body fluid is translocated from the upper 
body to the legs and from the vascular system to the 
interstitial space (27,35,65). The dynamics of these fluid 
and electrolyte shifts have received relatively little at- 
tention and more research is needed. 

An opposite and probably equally-rapid fluid-electro- 
lyte response occurs during water immersion where the 
physiological responses are due to the hydrostatic pres- 
sure of the water on the skin, which is then translated to 
body tissues. This general increase in mechanical pres- 
sure on connective tissue is proportional to the depth of 
immersion, and the pressure on the abdomen pushes the 
diaphragm cephalad and results in compression of the 
thoracic cardiorespiratory structures. Heart size is in- 
creased by 30% within 6 s of immersion to the neck in 
vertical (standing) subjects (50,62). The volume of fluid 
shifted has been calculated (mean transit time through 
lungs X cardiac output) from three subjects to be 700 
± 500 ml (X + SD) (2). This measurement needs to be 
confirmed as it has been widely quoted and is the only 
datum available. Of the 700 ml, approximately 150 ml 
shifts into the heart. As a result, central venous (right 
atrial) and pulmonary arterial pressures increase from a 
control level of 2-4 mmHg to 13-16 mmHg (11,52,62). 
Intrathoracic (esophageal) pressure increases from —0.4 
mmHg to +3.4 mmHg (11) and transmural pressure in 
the great veins increases from 3-5 mmHg to 12-15 mmHg 
(2,11). Venous pressure in the arm remains constant at 
about 4 mmHg while venous tone decreases from 17 to 
12-13 mmHg-ml~' • 100 g~' tissue and remains de- 
pressed for at least 1 h after immersion is terminated (1 1). 
Systemic vascular resistance decreases by 30% (A = 5 
mmHg-1"' min"') (2). Cardiac output increases by 32% 
in sitting immersion (2) and by 63% in standing immer- 
sion (22). There appears to be a more uniform distribu- 
tion of pulmonary blood flow during immersion (61), 
which is similar to that occurring during short periods of 
weightlessness (55). Most of these cardiorespiratory re- 
sponses are similar to those following a blood transfusion, 
and also mimick those occurring during negative pressure 
breathing; that is, breathing air from a tank at lower than 
atmospheric pressure (about —20.5 cm H.iO) (1). 

Simultaneously with the cephalic intravascular fluid 
shift, there is an absolute increase in plasma volume (hy- 
pervolemia) of 8-10% within the first 30 min (probably 
sooner) of immersion (31,41,53) and a progressive de- 
cline thereafter (31.32.33.41). 

There is disagreement concerning the composition and 
source of the incoming fluid. Some data suggest the in- 
coming fluid causes vascular hemodilution with reduction 
in hematocrit and the concentrations of hemoglobin and 
protein as well as the concentrations of the more readily 
diffusible plasma electrolytes (32,33,40,41). These re- 
sults suggest that the composition of the incoming fluid 
was hypotonic (a lower osmolality) with respect to the 
existing plasma tonicity. On the other hand, when mildly- 



dehydrated subjects were immersed, hypervolemia oc- 
curred with similar increases in Hct, Hb, RBC, protein, 
and albumin concentrations, but there were no significant 
changes in plasma sodium or osmotic concentrations 
(19,31). These responses suggest that the composition of 
the incoming fluid was isotonic in comparison with ex- 
isting plasma tonicity. These results also depend upon 
the magnitude of the net influx and efflux of diffusible 
ions that become more important as diuresis increases 
and fluid and electrolytes are excreted. 

The incoming fluid is probably derived from interstitial 
fluid. A relative decrease in capillary filtration and an 
increase in capillary reabsorption, resulting from the in- 
creased pressure on connective tissue from the immer- 
sion fluid, has been postulated by von Diringshofen (67). 
Accordingly, interstitial fluid pressure should increase 
during the first minutes of immersion when plasma vol- 
ume increases and then decrease thereafter as plasma 
volume falls. Interstitial pressure has not been measured 
early during immersion, but Khosla and DuBois (41) found 
it decreases progressively from a control level of —0.5 
± 1.4 cm HjO in supine subjects in air, by —0.5 ± 0.3, 
-1.2 ± 0.5, and by -1.6 ± 0.8 cm HjO at 20, 40, and 
60 min of head-out immersion, respectively. These im- 
portant results are suggestive of at least a part of the 
mechanism for the changes in plasma volume, and point 
the way for future studies. Measurements of interstitial 
fluid composition, in conjunction with the volume shifts 
would be most interesting. Ascertaining the contribution 
of fluid from the intracellular compartment to this early 
plasma-interstitial fluid interaction would also be impor- 
tant, but more precise analytical techniques are required 
than are currently available. 

In view of the relative state of general body hyper- 
hydration induced as the result of immersion, the purpose 
for this hypervolemic response is not clear. It would ap- 
pear to be a response to the connective tissues compres- 
sion that perhaps reacts to a relatively lower plasma vol- 
ume in the legs following the cephalad shift of fluid. This 
postulated imbalance of compression pressure might then 
be reflected in greater interstitial fluid pressure in the 
legs when compared with interstitial pressure elsewhere 
and fluid would be forced into the vascular system from 
the legs. Perhaps the hypervolemia is simply an antici- 
patory response to protect the plasma volume from the 
ensuing hypovolemia from the diuresis. However, this 
observed absolute increase in plasma volume should be 
confirmed before speculation is carried too far. 

An in-depth review of the factors contributmg to im- 
mersion diuresis has been published (12). It is generally 
agreed that the primary stimulus for the diuresis is the 
redistribution of blood into the thoracic region with an 
accompanying increase in central venous (right atrial and 
pulmonary arterial transmural) pressures. Accompanying 
the diuresis is a significant loss of sodium (natriuresis) 
which appears to be controlled independently from the 
diuresis (14,15,19,41), but may also contribute to the 



MEX)ICINE AND SCIENCE IN SPORTS AND EXERCISE 



magnitude of the diuresis by carrying water with the so- 
dium ion. StimuU from the atrial and pulmonary vascular 
structures, and perhaps elsewhere, initiate activation of 
various compensatory responses that induce diuresis to 
reduce the "excess" extracellular fluid. Some compen- 
satory responses include increased renal prostaglandin 
activity (18), a decrease in sympathetic nervous stimu- 
lation of the kidney (6.23.24,39), a decrease in the ac- 
tivity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that 
promotes less kidney retention of sodium (7,16,20,21, 
47) suppression of plasma vasopressin (anti-diuretic hor- 
mone) that allows less water reabsorption by the kidney 
(19,32,33), and the probable roles of natriuretic (8,9, 
13,17,51,57,63,64) hormones. Many natriuretic sub- 
stances and sodium transport (Na*, K*-ATPase) inhibi- 
tors, derived from extracts of brain, urine, plasma, and 
heart atrial tissue have been reported (8,9,63,64). The 
atrial and plasma natriuretic and plasma diuretic factors 
are in the process of being purified and it is uncertain at 
this time whether they are distinctly separate substances. 
A natriuretic factor has been isolated from heart atria 
from the rat, rabbit, dog, baboon, and humans (64) and 
possesses both natriuretic and diuretic properties (8,64). 
A diuretic factor has been isolated from dog plasma 
(36,43,44,45,60). Both factors appear to have an active 
component with molecular weight greater than 30,000 
daltons (9,60), an active natriuretic component of less 
than 5,000 daltons (9), and an active diuretic component 
of less than 1,800 daltons (60). Elucidation of the inter- 
action between the diuretic, antidiuretic, natriuretic, and 
anti-natriuretic hormones should prove to be very inter- 
esting. 

BED REST 

Annotated bibliographies of the physiological re- 
sponses to prolonged bed rest in normal, healthy people 
have been prepared (28,34). Kozlowski (48) has re- 
viewed the hypokinesia (bed rest) literature prior to 1969. 
We have prepared a more general review of the recent 
literature (29) as well as of the few data concerning the 
problem of changes in physical working capacity (peak 
oxygen uptake) during bed rest (30). 

Prolonged bed rest induces general body dehydration. 
Assumption of the horizontal or sHghtly head-down (-6°) 
body positions results in a shift of fluid from the lower 
extremities to the thorax and head. Subjects experience 
fullness in the head and often report headache and nasal 
congestion. The volume of the thighs and legs decreases 
by about 900 ml (6%) (3), the lower legs by only 160 ml 
(5%), and calf circumference by 1 cm (2.7%) (37). Thus, 
the cephalic-fluid volume shift is derived in about equal 
proportions from the thighs and legs with about half as 
much fluid coming from subcutaneous tissue as from mus- 
cle and bone. As a result of the fluid shift, central venous 
pressure (heart and pulmonary area) increases (°P<0.05) 
from 5 to 7* cm HjO (3), and interstitial fluid pressure 



in the tibialis anterior muscle decreases from +4.6 to 
— 2.8° mmHg and from -1-0.6 to -3.8° mmHg in sub- 
cutaneous leg tissue (37). A trend toward a more negative 
pressure would suggest a loss of fluid. 

Plasma volume (calculated from changes in [Hb] and 
Hct) decreases by the second hour of horizontal bed rest 
by about 6.5% (68), by 4.3% (125 ml) after 6 h, and by 
5^3% to 9.7% (150-300 ml) after 24 h (58,66). There 
are no data to determine whether plasma volume in- 
creases within the first 30 min of assumption of a recum- 
bent position like that occurring with immersion. Hy- 
povolemia is -10 to -13% (-350 to -450 ml) by the 
fourth day when isometric or isotonic exercise was per- 
formed for 1 h/d during bed rest, but plasma volume 
continued to decline when no exercise was performed 
(26) suggesting that exercise has a stabilizing eflPect on 
the rate of hypovolemia. 

In comparison with the rate of hypovolemia, red-cell 
mass decreases more slowly; by 100 ml (5%) after 14 d 
of bed rest and by 300-550 ml after 30 d (42,56). 

The interstitial volume decreases in the first few days 
of bed rest followed by a restoration to or an increase of 
320 to 430 ml above control levels after 2 wk (26). The 
magnitude of this apparent overshoot was approximately 
equal to the volume of plasma lost (262-441 ml). Thus, 
after 14 d of bed rest the extracellular fluid volume (plasma 
plus interstitial) was unchanged from the ambulatory con- 
trol level. It appears that maintenance of the extracellular 
volume takes precedence over maintenance of the plasma 
volume; the control appears to reside within the inter- 
stitial volume. These findings must be confirmed, and 
■ very important findings will come from simultaneous 
measurements of interstitial volume and pressure changes 
under conditions of inactivity and exercise. 

There are few data on fluid volume levels beyond 2 wk 
of bed rest. Plasma volume continues to decrease and 
reaches - 1 5% ( - 500 ml) after 20 d (26). - 1 8% ( - 600 
ml) at 70 d and -30% (-1000 ml) at 175 d (10). The 
extracellular volume remains at control levels after 175 
d of bed rest due possibly to a larger compensatory in- 
crease in interstitial volume. 

Total body water decreases by 3.4% (2900 ml) after 
25 d of bed rest (49). Of this 2900-ml loss, 600-1000 
ml (approximately one-third) were derived from plasma 
and the remaining two-thirds from the intracellular vol- 
ume which includes the red-cell mass. These results sug- 
gest that control of body water distribution depends 
mainly on factors related to changes in hydrostatic pres- 
sure and, to a lesser extent, on the exercise (metabolic) 
duration and rate. A sufficient duration of heavy exercise 
performed intermittently during bed rest could probably 
maintain plasma volume near ambulatory control levels. 
This may be a technique for controlling the volume of 
interstitial fluid if the overshoot response occurs when 
plasma volume is not allowed to decrease. Significant 
edema may be the result with undesirable consequences, 



FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE RESPONSES DURING INACTIVmf 



particularly for astronauts with their "normal" cephalic 
edema. 

Both lean body mass and fat content are lost during 
bed rest. A proportionately greater loss of fat than lean 
body mass occurs when isotonic exercise is performed 
(25). Thus, the loss of body weight during bed rest is 
partitioned between exercise-induced fat reduction and 
the loss of lean body mass resulting more from reduction 
in hydrostatic pressure and independent of metabolic rate. 
In normally-hydrated subjects eating a controlled diet, 
the onset of diuresis and accompanying losses of sodium, 
potassium, and other osmols during bed rest is slower 
than during immersion and reaches a peak during the first 
24 h (4,25,37). A second peak of urine sodium loss occurs 
about the fifth day and continues for at least nine addi- 
tional days. Urine potassium excretion increases by 35% 
during the first hours of head-down bed rest and returns 
to control levels after 8 h (37). Potassium, like sodium, 
remains at control levels for 3 d and increased again from 
days 5-14 of bed rest (4,25). 

The loss of plasma volume is accompanied by net 
changes of sodium and potassium that left the plasma 
concentrations of these ions unchanged from normal con- 
trol levels (26,66). Plasma renin activity (PRA) and al- 
dosterone concentration appear to increase somewhat 
during bed rest to probably counter sodium loss (4,37, 
54,66) although this increase is not a consistent finding 
(5,28). Orcadian changes in PRA may have influenced 
these results (54). Attenuation of plasma renin activity 
following an autotransfusion of blood suggests PRA was 
responding, at least in part, to the hypovolemia and per- 
haps to accompanying changes in blood pressure. A de- 
crease in plasma aldosterone concentration would facil- 
itate urine sodium loss and potassium retention; however, 
Chobanian et al. (5) observed no change in plasma al- 
dosterone concentration during 3 wk of bed rest. If PRA 
and aldosterone are essentially constant after 3 d of bed 
rest, then another mechanism must be involved to ac- 
count for the secondary natriuresis and kaliuresis begin- 



ning after the fifth day. The actions of diuretic and na- 
triuretic hormones are likely possibilities. 

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

With the exception of some water-immersion studies, 
most research on the process of deconditioning in humans 
has been of a descriptive nature. More such studies are 
needed that include: 

1 . Studying the eflFects of increasing duration and in- 
tensity of isometric and isotonic exercise during immer- 
sion and bed rest on responses of all physiological sys- 
tems, but especially the vestibular, immune, 
thermoregulatory, and fluid-electrolyte systems. 

2. Investigating the effects of circadian rhythm influ- 
ences on hormonal function during bed rest and immer- 
sion. 

3. More emphasis on events occurring during the first 
minutes of immersion and bed rest where physiological 
responses occur most rapidly. 

4. And finally, more extensive investigation into various 
remedial procedures that can reduce or eliminate the 
adaptive (deconditioning) responses. Research study de- 
signs concerning remedial procedures must consider the 
separate effects of hypodynamia (reduced exercise levels) 
and hypogravia (reduced hydrostatic pressure) and their 
probable interaction. 

The bed rest and immersion environments are good 
models for studying the more basic aspects of fluid vol- 
ume and electrolyte physiology and their controlling hu- 
moral mechanisms. The function of the emerging diuretic 
and natriuretic hormones, on conjunction with vasopres- 
sin and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, must 
contribute importantly in the metabolism of sodium which 
plays an important role in the etiology of blood pressure 
control, possibly orthostatic hypotension, and probably 
hypertension.
