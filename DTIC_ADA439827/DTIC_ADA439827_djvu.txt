13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 Words) 

XML (extensible Markup Language) is the ubiquitous low-level language of the World Wide Web, and forms the primary 
structure for the emerging Semantic Web. The Semantic Web is the vision, and ongoing implementation, of how the 
web will transform over time to connect disparate pieces of knowledge, data, and resources. Our purpose in this 
contract was to create a foundation for the Semantic Web, suitable for deployment within the Air Force Infosphere 
project. The concept behind the Infosphere is one of rapid data and knowledge interchange, between physical objects, 
models, and computational processes. In our work, we created two XML schemas, defining two applications: MXL and 
DXL. MXL (Multimodeling exchange Language) defines dynamic system models at a fairly high level of abstraction, and 
DXL (Dynamics exchange Language) defines a low-level, block-oriented, language for a wide variety of simulation 
applications. With initial results in 2001, these two languages represented the first thorough implementations of XML in 
simulation, and they led the way to subsequent, higher level ontology studies.

CONTRACTUAL ITEMS 


The following items are specifically requested in the contract, and are addressed below: 

1. Accomplishments compared to goal objectives-, the accomplishments far exceed the original goal, which was 
to create an XML “presence” for use in the battle infosphere. We not only created two XML 
languages, schemas, and implementations around them, we also have extended this work to ontology 
definitions and use in the user interface. We constructed a comprehensive 3D dynamic model 
authoring environment, linking dynamic model with geometric model components. 

2. Reasons why established goals were not met if appropriate. N/A. 

3. Cumulative list of publications-, see the Results <& Discussion section. 

4. List of professionalpersonnel. Paul Fishwick (PI) and students. Students are listed toward the end of this 
report. Requested info for the PI is PhD Computer and Information Science, University of 
Pennsylvania, 1986. Thesis title: “Hierarchical Reasoning: Simulating Complex Processes over 
Multiple Levels of Abstraction”. 

5. Papers presented at meetings-. See the comprehensive list under Results <& Discussion. 

6. Consultive and advisory functions-. N/A. 

7. Inventions and Patents-. The software that we have constructed (SimPackJ, SimPackP, and RUBE) is 
open source. 


INTRODUCTION 

For the past four years, we have developed a software framework called RUBE. RUBE’s purpose is to 
provide a modeler with a way in which to better integrate the phenomenon being modeled and the model 
itself. This integration is done using multiple visual modes of display, allowing the dynamic models, as well 
as the phenomena, to be displayed in 3D. Figure 1 displays the RUBE architecture. Our use of ontologies 
within the RUBE project is founded on two approaches: (1) schema definitions and XML files for model 
types and model files; and (2) an OWL representation of a sample air reconnaissance scene. We proceed 
with these in sequence. 

RUBE begins its process with two types of interfaces: a 2D interface using the SodiPodi tool, and a 3D one 
using Blender, which is a tool for authoring and animating 3D scenes. The simulation analyst builds a scene to 
be simulated, and then builds dynamic models of that scene. The dynamic models are translated into MXL 
(Multimodel eXchange Language). MXL contains an ontology (or XML schema) defining certain model types 
and how they are defined. For example, a Finite State Machine contains an initial state, a set of states, and 
transitions. DXL (Dynamics eXchange Language) is a lower-level homogeneous block-model language capable 
of describing both synchronous and asynchronous execution of block networks. As such, DXL networks 
reflect behaviors such as those found in digital circuits as well as more loosely connected data flow networks. 
Both MXL and DXL are XML languages. Each has a schema, defining the language as an ontology. 
Returning to the process defined in Figure 1, a model is converted into MXL and then DXL, and finally into 
a target language such as Java or Javascript. This Javascript code is then reinserted into the scene. This is 
done by first exporting the Blender scene into an X3D (extensible 3D) file and then defining the Javascript 
in X3D script nodes. The final X3D scene file, intact with both geometric and dynamic properties, is then 
executed to yield the simulation. In addition to the work performed in RUBE, we have recently started to 
create an ontology that attempts to bring all knowledge about an application domain together. Figure 2 
shows a network relating elements of a scene (JSTARS, FI 5, and UAV) with the geometry and dynamics of

these objects we have listed the defined styles that might be required during the formatting process. The 
idea here is that we can use RUBE to generate objects, that are then updated in the ontology. Moreover, we 
can add to the ontology manually, if necessary, to express the semantic relations. We are using OWL for 
expressing the network, and the Stanford Protege tool for managing the links. There is a two-way 
connection between Blender and Protege so that information can be entered in Protege and then appear in 
Blender, and vice versa.
