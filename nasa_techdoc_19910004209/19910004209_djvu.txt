Abstract 

Static oxidation kinetics of the super-a2 titanium- 
aluminide alloy Ti-25Al-10Nb-3V-lMo (atomic per- 
cent) were investigated in air over the temperature 
range of 650° C to 1000°C using thermogravimetric 
analysis. The oxidation kinetics were complex at 
all exposure temperatures and displayed up to three 
distinct oxidation rates. Breakaway oxidation oc- 
curred after long exposure times at high tempera- 
tures. Oxidation products were determined using 
X-ray diffraction techniques, electron microprobe 
analysis, and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Ox- 
ide scale morphology was examined by scanning elec- 
tron microscopy of the surfaces and cross sections of 
oxidized specimens. The oxides during the parabolic 
stages were compact and multilayered, consisting pri- 
marily of Ti02 doped with Nb, a top layer of AI2O3, 
and a thin bottom layer of TiN. The transition be- 
tween the second and third parabolic stage was found 
to be linked to the formation of a TiAl layer at the 
oxide-metal interface. Porosity was also formed dur- 
ing the third stage, causing degradation of the oxide 
and the beginning of breakaway oxidation. 

Introduction 

Titanium-aluminide intermetallic alloys, such as 
TisAl, axe candidate materials for use in hypersonic 
structures and advanced engines because of their 
high specific strength and excellent high-temperature 
properties. These exceptional properties result from 
their ordered microstructure, which is also the cause 
of the low ductility of intermetallic alloys at room 
temperature. In an effort to improve ductility, 
the intermetallic TiaAl has been alloyed with beta- 
stabilizing elements such as tungsten, molybde- 
num, niobium, tantalum, and vanadium. The alloy 
Ti-25Al-10Nb-3V-lMo (atomic percent), commonly 
referred to as super-a2, is one such modification of 
TiaAl being considered for aerospace applications. 

The oxidation susceptibility of titanium- 
aluminides in hypersonic and advanced engine en- 
vironments is of concern because of the reactivity of 
titanium alloys at high temperatures. The role of 
aluminum and niobium in the oxidation of titanium 
has been reported (refs. 1-5): aluminum reduces the 
solubility of oxygen in titanium, but its role on oxide 
formation is uncertain; and niobium decreases the ox- 
ide formation rate of titanium. Except for a few lim- 
ited studies (refs. 6-11), kinetic and microstructural 
data on the oxidation behavior of titanium-aluminide 
alloys are lacking in the open literature. The exist- 
ing data indicate that the kinetics for oxidation of 
titanium-aluminides are complex and involve two or 



more oxidation rates, depending on the temperature 
and time of exposure. 

The purpose of the present study was to char- 
acterize the oxidation behavior of Ti-25Al-10Nb- 
3V-IM0 alloy. Samples were oxidized at tem- 
peratures over the range of 650° C to 1000°C in 
commercially available high-purity air (true hydro- 
carbon content less than 0.1 ppm) using a thermo- 
gravimetric apparatus (TGA). Selected samples were 
examined using X-ray diflFraction (XRD), conven- 
tional light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM), microprobe X-ray analysis, energy dispersive 
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) to characterize the oxide com- 
position and morphology and the microstructural 
changes in the metal. 

Experimental Procedures 

Specimens and Materials 

The chemical analysis of the ingot Ti-25Al-10Nb- 
3V-IM0 alloy is shown in table I. The alloy in the as- 
received condition had been processed into a forged 
pancake shape (4 in. thick and 15 in. diameter) and 
heat treated as follows: 1121°C for 2 hr, direct 
transfer to 732°C salt bath for 0.5 hr, direct transfer 
to 816°C salt bath for 0.5 hr, and air cool.

TGA samples were machined to dimensions of 
1 cm wide, 1.5 cm long, and 0.12 cm thick with a 
0.16-cm-diameter hole through the thickness at one 
end for suspending the sample during the test. Sur- 
faces of samples were ground to a uniform finish us- 
ing silicon carbide paper through 2400 grit. Sam- 
ples were detergent cleaned, ultrasonically cleaned in 
acetone and ethyl alcohol, and air dried. The di- 
mensions of finished samples were measured to the 
nearest 0.001 cm and weights were recorded before 
and after exposure to the nearest 0.05 mg. 



Oxidation Tests 

Oxidation tests were conducted from 650 °C to 
1000°C for times up to 100 hr. The sample weight 
change was recorded continuously during exposure 
using a Cahn C2000 microbalance with an accuracy 
of 1 jig. Samples were suspended by quartz fibers 
into a vertical tubular furnace, and the temperature 
was monitored continuously with a type R thermo- 
couple located just below the suspended specimen. 
High-purity air (true hydrocarbon content less than 
0.1 ppm) was continuously pumped through the re- 
action chamber from the top to the bottom at a 
flow rate of 60 ccm. At each temperature, duplicate 
or triplicate tests were performed to evaluate data 
reproducibility. 

Characterization Studies 

Microstructural characterization of the alloy was 
done before and after oxidation using SEM, EDS, 
TEM, and XRD. Oxidized specimens were analyzed 
by XRD, SEM, and EDS to determine the oxide 
phases present. Selected specimens were also cross- 
sectioned after mounting in plastic, polished and 
lightly etched using Kroll's reagent (2 percent HNO3, 
1 percent HF, and 97 percent H2O), and coated with 
a thin layer of gold. The cross-sectioned specimens 
were examined using electron microprobe, SEM, and 
EDS to determine the distribution and morphology 
of the oxide phases.

Oxidation Kinetics 

The oxidation of titanium alloys involves both 
oxide formation and dissolution of gas into the metal 
(ref. 12). Assuming that these processes are rate 
controlling, the weight will increase parabolically. 
This weight gain can therefore be described by the 
rate equation 

m = \Jkpt 

where m is the weight gain per unit area of speci- 
men surface, kp is the parabolic rate constant, and 
t is time of exposure. The parabolic rate constant 
for a particular alloy can be calculated by plotting 
oxidation weight gain data in parabolic coordinates 
(weight as a function of square root of time), produc- 
ing a line of slope ^/k^. The parabolic rate constant 
kp varies with temperature following the Arrhenius 
relation 

kp = koexp{-Q/RT) 

where kg is the preexponential factor, Q is the acti- 
vation energy of the rate-determining mechanism, R 



is the gas constant, and T is the temperature of oxi- 
dation. Using this equation, the activation energy Q 
is calculated by plotting ln{kp) as a function of 1/T, 
which produces a line of slope Q/R. 

Examination of the weight gain kinetics for 
Ti-25Al-10Nb-3V-lMo alloy using this analysis shows 
that there are up to three distinct stages of parabolic 
oxidation. All three stages were not observed for ev- 
ery exposure: at temperatures of 850° C and below, 
stages 1 and 2 were detected; at 900°C, stages 1, 2, 
and 3 were detected; and above 950°C, stages 2 and 3 
were detected. 

Figure 1 shows the weight gain history in para- 
bolic coordinates for a specimen exposed for 100 hr 
at 700° C and is typical for samples exposed in the 
lower temperature range (650° C to 850° C) where 
two stages of parabolic oxidation were observed. At 
700° C the first stage lasted about 7 hr, after which 
a second stage began at a lower oxidation rate. The 
periods of first-stage oxidation were shorter at higher 
temperatures. In fact, for exposures above 900° C the 
first-stage oxidation was too brief to be detected. 

The weight gain history for a sample exposed 
for 24 hr at 1000°C is shown in figure 2. At that 
temperature the first stage was not observed, and 
only the second and third oxidation stages could 
be identified. The second stage lasted for 1.7 hr^/^ 
(3 hr) after which there was a period of nonparabolic 
oxidation that lasted until 3 hr^''^ (9 hr) when the 
third parabolic stage began. 

Breakaway oxidation occurred after long exposure 
times at higher temperatures. It began at about 
4.5 hrV2 (20 hr) for the sample exposed at 1000°C 
(fig. 2). Breakaway oxidation began at about 5 hr^'^ 
(25 hr) for the sample exposed for 50 hr at 975° C 
and continued for the remainder of the test as shown 
in figure 3. 

Table II shows TGA results for each time- 
temperature exposure condition, including the weight 
gain and the parabolic rate constant for each oxi- 
dation stage encountered. Figure 4 is an Arrhenius 
plot of parabolic rate constants as a function of tem- 
perature. The activation energies for super-a2 were 
calculated to be 52.5 kcal/mol for the first stage, 
59.5 kcal/mol for the second stage, and 23.7 kcal/mol 
for the third stage. 

Figure 5 is an Arrhenius plot showing a compari- 
son of the present data and similar data for Ti-24A1- 
lONb (ref. 9) and Ti-25A1 (ref. 11). The oxidation 
rates for super-Q2 are similar to those for Ti-24A1- 
iONb, but both alloys have much lower rates than 
those of Ti-25A1.

Oxidation Products 

The XRD analysis, table III, revealed that Ti02 
was the primary oxide phase formed on super-Q:2 at 
all exposure temperatures. TiN was identified in 
the oxide for all specimens exposed above 700°C. 
The presence of AI2O3 varied with temperature: 
none was identified for samples exposed at 700°C, 
trace amounts were observed for samples exposed 
at 800° C, and significant amounts were observed 
for samples exposed at temperatures above 800° C. 
The amount of TiAl phase detected also varied with 
exposure temperature: trace amounts were identi- 
fied in samples exposed at lower temperatures where 
second-stage oxidation occurs (850° C and below); 
significant amounts were identified in samples ex- 
posed for 24 hr at 900°C, which is just at the end 
of the second stage; and strong TiAl signals were 
identified in all samples exposed above 900°C, where 
third stage oxidation occurs. 

SEM, EDS, and electron microprobe analysis of 
cross-sectioned samples were used to further charac- 
terize oxide morphologies. Samples chosen for cross- 
sectioning were picked to represent the various oxi- 
dation stages identified from the weight gain plots. 
Weight gains were too small, i.e., the oxides were too 
thin, during first-stage oxidation to allow analysis us- 
ing this technique. 

Examination of the oxides during the second 
parabolic stage showed multilayered, compact (void 
free) oxides. Figure 6 shows a cross-sectional mi- 
crograph of a specimen exposed for 24 hr at 900° C, 
which is at the end of the second oxidation stage. 
The oxide consists of three layers; the top layer is 
1.8 nm thick, the middle layer is 4.7 ^m thick, and 
the bottom layer is 1 . 1 /xm thick. The accompanying 
microprobe scans, combined with the XRD results 
(table III), allow identification of each layer. The 
high nitrogen concentration in the bottom layer iden- 
tifies it as TiN. The center layer is Ti02; however, the 
niobium scan shows that this element is also present, 
decreasing in concentration from the metal-oxide in- 
terface. Since no niobium oxides were identified by 
XRD, it is assumed that the niobium is present in 
the Ti02 as a dopant. The top layer is AI2O3, as 
shown by the high aluminum concentration. Exami- 
nation of the surface of this specimen using SEM and 
EDS identified particles of both AI2O3 and Ti02, in- 
dicating that the AI2O3 does not form a continuous, 
protective layer. 

The oxides during the third parabolic stage were 
also found to be multilayered and compact, despite 
the introduction of limited porosity. Figure 7 shows 
the cross section of a sample exposed for 100 hr at 
900°C, which is within the third oxidation stage. 



This sample has the same phase distribution as seen 
during the second stage (fig. 6): a bottom layer of 
TiN, a top layer of AI2O3, and a middle layer of 
Ti02 doped with niobium. The TiN layer has not 
grown in thickness between 24 and 100 hr, although 
the AI2O3 and Ti02 layers have grown from 1.8 ^m 
to 2.8 /xm and from 4.7 /itm to 6.2 /zm, respectively. 
Additionally, beneath the TiN layer a new phase has 
formed which has a high concentration of aluminum. 
This indicates that the TiAl phase identified in the 
XRD forms in the metal beneath the oxide-metal 
interfjice. 

Oxides of samples exposed at higher tempera- 
tures, which had undergone breakaway oxidation, ex- 
hibited significantly more porosity than oxides during 
the second and third parabolic stages. Figure 8 shows 
the cross-sectional micrograph of a specimen exposed 
at 1000°C for 24 hr that had just started breakaway 
oxidation. Large amounts of porosity are visible in 
the oxide. The large cracks joining this porosity are 
assumed to have occurred during cooling or specimen 
preparation since the weight gain does not indicate 
any spalling during exposure. 

New compact oxides were found to be forming 
underneath the oxides of specimens that had under- 
gone long periods of breakaway oxidation. The cross- 
sectional micrograph of the sample exposed for 50 hr 
at 975°C is shown in figure 9(a). That sample ex- 
perienced breakaway oxidation beginning at about 
5 hr^/'^ (25 hr) and continuing for the remainder of 
the exposure. The Ti02 layer had a layer of exten- 
sive porosity similar to that seen at the beginning 
of breakaway oxidation (fig. 8) . The elemental map 
for aluminum (fig. 9(b)) reveals a high concentration 
of aluminum along the dark line visible in the ox- 
ide near the oxide-metal interface; the titanium map 
(fig. 9(c)) shows a depletion of titanium in this re- 
gion. These indicate that a second-generation com- 
pact oxide, with the three-layer distribution of earlier 
compact oxides, is starting to grow beneath the orig- 
inal oxide. 

Microstructure of Alloy 

The SEM micrograph of the as-received super-a2 
(fig. 10(a)) shows an acicular, two-phase microstruc- 
ture. The thin, light phase was identified by XRD 
and TEM as TisAl. The XRD pattern of the dark 
phase was not found in literature; however, from 
XRD and TEM analysis it was found to have a struc- 
ture similar to Nb2Al. The dark phase was therefore 
identified as (Ti,Nb,Mo,V)2Al, which will be referred 
to as M2AI. The two-phase structure was retained 
after all exposures, even at 1000°C (fig. 10(b)). 

Results from XRD analysis of selected oxidized 
samples are presented in table III. The XRD analysis 



showed TisAl was present after all exposures. The 
M2AI phase was also present after all exposures but 
slightly modified (compared with the phase in the 
as-received material) after exposure at the higher 
temperatures (975°C and 1000°C), as revealed by 
different XRD extinctions and intensities. Trace 
amounts of /3-Ti were also detected after exposure 
at 975°C and 1000°C. 

Since the oxidation of titanium alloys proceeds 
by the dual processes of oxide formation and oxygen 
dissolution into the metal, the amount of oxygen 
dissolved into the alloy is an important consideration. 
The estimated weight gain contributions of both 
oxide formation and oxygen dissolution are presented 
in table IV. For each oxide layer, weight gain per unit 
area, Wq, due to oxide growth is given by 

Wo = pz 

where p is the density of the oxide phase and z is the 
thickness of this phase measured from SEM cross- 
sectional micrographs. Subtracting this total weight 
for all three oxide layers from the total weight gain 
yields the weight of oxygen dissolved into the metal.

The compositional broadening of an X-ray diffrac- 
tion peak was analyzed (ref. 13) to determine the 
concentration profile for oxygen in the substrate al- 
loy for a sample exposed at 650°C for 100 hr (fig. 11). 
The oxygen solubility limit was estimated to be 7.5 
atomic percent, and the diffusion coefficient 5.6 x 
10"^** cm^/sec was calculated. The maximum solu- 
bility was lower than the 12.5 atomic percent calcu- 
lated for Ti-24Al-10Nb. The diffusion coefficients are 
similar; Ti-24Al-10Nb was found to have a diffusion 
coefficient of 4 x 10^^'* cm^/sec at 650°C. (ref. 9). 

Discussion 

Study of the oxidation kinetics of super-Q2 re- 
vealed complex behavior: three distinct stages of 
parabolic oxidation, separated by periods of non- 
steady-state behavior, were identified. Although sim- 



ilar multiple-stage oxidation behavior has been ob- 
served in other titanium-aluminide alloys, the exact 
mechanisms have yet to be fully identified. In the 
present study, the oxide morphology of representa- 
tive samples were examined in some detail to better 
understand the operative oxidation mechanisms. 

The first oxidation stage was identified only dur- 
ing exposure at lower temperatures and decreased in 
duration as the exposure temperature was increased. 
Because the oxides formed during first-stage oxida- 
tion were so thin, microstructural evaluation was not 
attempted. The activation energy calculated from 
the Arrhenius plot of parabolic rate constants (fig. 4) 
for this stage was 52.5 kcal/mol and is similar to that 
for the oxidation of titanium (ref. 14). This indicates 
that the rate of oxidation is controlled by transport 
across Ti02 on the surface of the alloy. 

Onset of second-stage oxidation follows first-stage 
oxidation after a very brief transition period. The 
second stage, which has a lower oxidation rate than 
the first, was identified at all exposure temperatures. 
Examination of a sample in this second stage (fig. 6) 
shows a compact oxide layer. The oxide consisted 
primarily of Ti02 doped with niobium as identified 
by XRD (table II) and elemental scans. The outer 
surface is primarily AI2O3, and there is a layer of TiN 
at the oxide-metal interface. 

The morphology observed for samples undergoing 
second-stage oxidation suggests a strong oxygen ac- 
tivity gradient across the oxide, which would result 
from a compact oxide. A low-oxygen activity at the 
oxide-metal interface is indicated by the presence of 
the TiN layer since the reaction to form TiN (2TiN -|- 
O2 = 2TiO + N2) requires a very low partial pressure 
of oxygen to proceed, P02/.PN2 = 5 x lO"!'^ at 982°C 
(ref. 15). The presence of AI2O3 only at the surface 
also confirms the steep activity gradient. Since the 
solubility of AI2O3 in Ti02 (rutile) is a strong func- 
tion of oxygen activity (increasing as the activity of 
oxygen decreases (ref. 16)), AI2O3 would be soluble 
within the oxide, where the oxygen activity is low. 
The AI2O3 would exist as a distinct phase only at 
the surface, where there is a high oxygen activity. 

The layer of AI2O3, however, was not shown to 
be protective. XRD, SEM, and EDS analysis of the 
oxide surface of a sample exposed for 24 hr at 900° C 
showed the presence of AI2O3 and Ti02 particles, in- 
dicating that the AI2O3 layer was discontinuous and 
allowed titanium to diffuse to the surface. Examin- 
ing the oxidation kinetics data also indicated that the 
AI2O3 was not protective. The activation energy was 
calculated to be 59.5 kcal/mol for the second oxida- 
tion stage, which is similar to that for the oxidation of 
titanium alloys. This indicates that transport across 
the Ti02 layer is rate controlling, and that AI2O3 has 



little effect on the oxidation rate. These facts imply 
that the presence of AI2O3 at the surface has little 
or no effect on oxidation rates. 

The super-a2 was shown to have an oxygen sol- 
ubility of 7.5 atomic percent, which is lower than 
that of titanium alloys. This is attributed in part to 
the presence of aluminum, which has been shown to 
reduce the maximum oxygen solubility of titanium 
alloys (ref. 17). Beta-stabilizers (niobium, molybde- 
num, and vanadium) have been shown to reduce the 
oxidation rate of titanium alloys by reducing the alloy 
oxygen solubility (ref. 17). In addition the presence 
of niobium in the oxide, as shown in figure 6, has 
been attributed with slowing the diffusion of oxygen 
through the oxide by reducing the concentration of 
oxygen ion vacancies (ref. 9). 

Despite the lower oxygen solubility, oxygen dis- 
solution into the metal must still be considered. As 
little as 1.2 atomic percent oxygen has been shown to 
embrittle titanium (ref. 18), and this level has been 
exceeded for a depth of 4 fim after 100 hr at 650°C 
(fig. 11). This could have serious consequences on 
the mechanical properties when super-Q2 is used as 
a thin sheet. 

The second-stage oxidation kinetics obey the clas- 
sical parabolic law. The kinetics are determined by 
both transport across a compact oxide surface and 
oxygen dissolution into the metal substrate. Al- 
though AI2O3 does form on the surface, it does not 
create a protective surface and in fact has little im- 
pax;t on the oxidation kinetics. 

At higher temperatures the oxide layer becomes 
unstable, and the oxidation kinetics depart from 
steady-state parabolic behavior. Afler some tran- 
sition period a third parabolic stage was observed, 
but this lasted only a short period at 975°C and 
1000°C; thereafter breakaway oxidation was observed 
(figs. 2 and 3). The XRD revealed that the primary 
difference between the second and third stages was 
the presence of TiAl. Only trace amounts of TiAl 
were found in samples within the second stage, but 
a strong XRD signal from XRD was identified at the 
end of the second stage (900°C, 24 hr). The TiAl was 
still observed by XRD during the third stage (900°C, 
100 hr) and also clearly visible in the cross-sectional 
micrographs (see fig. T). Smaller amounts of TiAl 
were observed in specimens that experienced break- 
away oxidation (1000°C, 24 hr and 975°C, 50 hr). 

Based on this analysis, the TiAl phase plays a 
major role in altering the parabolic processes govern- 
ing the second-stage oxidation. Aluminum is rejected 
back into the metal as oxidation proceeds, creating a 
layer of high aluminum concentration at the metal- 
oxide interface and the eventual nucleation of TiAl 
particles. The presence of the TiAl alters the dif- 



fusion across the oxide and disturbs the parabolic 
growth of the oxide. There is a period of non- 
parabolic growth as this TiAl grows, and once this 
layer completely covers the oxide-metal interface a 
new rate of diffusion is established causing a new 
parabolic oxidation rate. These kinetics dominate 
the third parabolic oxidation stage. 

SEM examination of cross-sectioned third-stage 
specimens also revealed the presence of limited poros- 
ity, in contrast to the compact oxides formed during 
second-stage oxidation. Layered porosity found in 
Ti alloys has been attributed to successive spallation 
events caused by stresses between the growing oxide 
and the oxygen-saturated metal substrate (ref. 19). 
The super-a2 alloy has a lower oxygen solubility than 
titanium alloys and therefore does not undergo simi- 
lar spallation. However, the formation of the TiAl 
does introduce a complicated stress situation that 
may be linked to the formation of porosity. 

According to Mrowec (ref. 20), porosity interrupts 
the diffusion both of metal ions to the surface and of 
oxygen ions to the oxide-metal interface. The oxygen 
activity begins to increase next to the pore, with a 
corresponding increase in the oxygen pressure in the 
pore. The oxide begins to dissociate surrounding the 
pore, and fills the pores with a new porous oxide 
product. If this process continues, it can degrade the 
protectiveness of the oxide as more of the oxide is 
converted into this nonprotective form. 

Specimens exposed at 975° C and 1000°C exhib- 
ited breakaway oxidation, and their oxides had ex- 
tensive porosity (figs. 8 and 9). It would appear that 
porosity continues to form during the third oxidation 
stage until the process of dissociation begins to ren- 
der the oxide unprotective and breakaway oxidation 
begins. At 975°C after 20 hr of breakaway oxidation, 
the process of dissociation had proceeded to the point 
that a second-generation oxide was able to form at 
the oxide-metal interface. 

Concluding Remarks 

Super-a2 titanium-aluminide alloy Ti-25Al-10Nb- 
3V-lMo is a modification of the stoichiometric al- 
loy TisAl that was developed to improve room- 
temperature ductility for aerospace applications. 
Additions of vanadium and molybdenum do not sig- 
nificantly alter the oxidation characteristics of the al- 
loy compared with Ti-24Al-10Nb alloy. Noteworthy 
features of the oxidation behavior of super-a2 are as 
follows: 

1. The overall oxidation rate is much lower than for 
stoichiometric TiaAl alloy and about the same as 
for Ti-24Al-10Nb alloy. 



2. The oxidation kinetics are marked by at least 
three distinct parabolic stages with successively 
lower oxidation rates. The occurrence of the 
stages depends on the exposure time and 
temperature. 

3. The oxidation products are Ti02 doped with Nb, 
AI2O3, and TiN, but AI2O3 does not contribute 
to the protection of the alloy. 

4. Oxidation during the parabolic stages is con- 
trolled by the presence of compact oxides. The 
transition between the second stage and the third 
stage is linked to the formation of a TiAl layer at 
the oxide-metal interface. 

5. Breakaway oxidation occurs after long times at 
high temperatures. The oxides during this stage 
exhibit large amounts of porosity that reduce 
their protectiveness. 

6. Oxygen dissolution in the alloy must be consid- 
ered during the oxidation of super-a2. The solu- 
bility of oxygen in the alloy is lower than that of 
Ti-24Al-10Nb, but their diffusivities are the same.

16. Abstrsict 

Static oxidation kinetics of the super-a2 titanium-aluminide alloy Ti-25Al-10Nb-3V-lMo (atomic 
percent) were investigated in air over the temperature range of 650°C to 1000°C using 
thermogravimetric analysis. The oxidation kinetics were complex at all exposure tempera- 
tures and displayed up to three distinct oxidation rates. Breakaway oxidation occurred af- 
ter long exposure times at high temperatures. Oxidation products were determined using 
X-ray diffraction techniques, electron microprobe analysis, and energy dispersive X-ray analy- 
sis. Oxide scale morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy of the surfaces and 
cross sections of oxidized specimens. The oxides during the parabolic stages were compact and 
multilayered, consisting primarily of Ti02 doped with Nb, a top layer of AI2O3, and a thin bottom 
layer of TiN. The transition between the second and third parabolic stages was found to be linked 
to the formation of a TiAl layer at the oxide-metal interface. Porosity was also formed during the 
third stage, causing degradation of the oxide and the beginning of breakaway oxidation.
