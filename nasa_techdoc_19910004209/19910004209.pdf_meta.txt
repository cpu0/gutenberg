x-archive-meta-description: Static oxidation kinetics of the super-alpha 2 titanium-aluminide alloy Ti-25Al-10Nb-3V-1Mo (at. percent) were investigated in air over the temperature range of 650 to 1000 C using thermogravimetric analysis. The oxidation kinetics were complex at all exposure temperatures and displayed up to three distinct oxidation rates. Breakaway oxidation occurred after long exposure times at high temperatures. Oxidation products were determined using x ray diffraction techniques, electron microprobe analysis, and energy dispersive x ray analysis. Oxide scale morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy of the surfaces and cross sections of oxidized specimens. The oxides during the parabolic stages were compact and multilayered, consisting primarily of TiO2 doped with Nb, a top layer of Al2O3, and a thin bottom layer of TiN. The transition between the second and third parabolic stage was found to be linked to the formation of a TiAl layer at the oxide-metal interface. Porosity was formed during the third stage, causing degradation of the oxide and the beginning of breakaway oxidation.
