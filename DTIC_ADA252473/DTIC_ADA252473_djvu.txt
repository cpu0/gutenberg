INTRCXXXrriON 


The Ada inplementation described above was tested according to the Ada 
Validation Procedures [Pro90] against the Ada Stemdard [Ada83] using the 
current Ada Conpiler Validation Capability (ACVC). This Vali^tion Suinnary 
Report (VSR) gives an account of the testing of this Ada implementation. 

For any technical terms used in this report, the reader is referred to 
(Pro90]. A detailed description of the ACVC may be found in the current 
ACVC User's Guide (UG89].

1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: A, 
B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class to 
v^ich it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B and 
class L tests are expected to produce errors at compile time euxi link time, 
respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result when they 
are executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, 
and the procedure CHECK FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT 
also provides a set of Identity functions used to defeat some ccmipiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting conpilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately compiled units. Errors 
are expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values — for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in A{pendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and 
implementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this implementation are described in section 2.3. 


1-2 






INTRMXJCTION 


For each Ada in^jleinentation, a customized test suite is produced by the 
AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications described in 
the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see section 2.1), and 
possibly removing some inapplicable tests (see section 2.2 and (UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada in^lementation must process each test of 
the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inaK>licable if it contains test objectives which are irrelevant 
for a given Ada inplementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may 
be supported by documents issued by the ISO and the AJFO known as Ada 
Commentaries and canmonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
inplementation, the following tests were determined to be ina^licable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Commentaries are included as 
appropriate.

C35713C, B86001U, and C86006G check for the predefined type 

LCM];_FLOAT; for this inplementation, there is no such type. 


C35713D euid B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with a 
name other than FLOAT, LCNG_FLOAT, or SHORT_FLQAT; for this 
implementation, there is no such type. 

A35801E checks that FLOAT'FIRST. .FLOAT'LAST may be used as a range 
constraint in a floating-point type declaration; for this 
inplementation, that range exceeds the range of safe numbers of the 
largest predefined floating-point type and must be rejected. (See 
section 2.3.) 

C45531M..P euid C45532M..P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations for 
types that require a SYSTEM.MAXJMWTTISSA of 47 or greater; for this 
inplementation, MAX_MANTISSA is less them 47. 

C45624A..B (2 tests) check that the proper exception is raised if 
MACHINE_OVERFLCWS is FALSE for floating point types and the results of 
various floating-point operations lie outside the range of the base 
type; for this implementation, MACHINEjOVERFLOWS is TRUE. 

B86001Y uses the name of a predefined fixed-point type other than type 
DURATION; for this inplementation, there is no such type. 

C96005B uses values of type DURATION'S base type that are outside the 
range of type DURATION; for this inplcmentation, the ranges are the 
same. 


CD1009C checks whether a length clause can specify a non-default size 
for a floating-point type; this inplementation does not suj^rt such 
sizes.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 21 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
implementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the 
way expected by the original tests. 

B24009A B33301B B38003A B38003B B38009A B38009B 

B85008G B85008H BC1303F BC3005B BD2B03A BD2D03A 

BD4003A 


A35801E was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by 
the AVO. The conpiler rejects the use of the range 

FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST as the range constraint of a floating-point type 
declaration because the bounds lie outside of the range of safe numbers 
(cf. LRM 3.5.7:12). 

CD1009A, CD1009I, CD1C03A, CD2A24A, and CD2A31A. .C (3 tests) were graded 
passed by Evaluation Modification as directed by the AVO. These tests use 
instantiations of the support procedure LE2«?rH_CHECK, which uses 
Unchecked_Conversion according to the interpretation given in AI-00590. 

The AVO ruled that this interpretation is not binding under ACVC 1.11; the 
tests are ruled to be passed if they produce Failed messages only frcxn the 
instances of LENGTH_CHECK —i.e, the allowed Report.Failed messages have 
the general form; 

" * CHECK REPRESENTATION FOR <TYPE ID> FAILED."

Language Standard# vdiether the test is applicable or inapplicable; 
otherwise, the Ada Inplementation fails the ACVC (Pro90]. 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and aj^licable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard. 

The list of items below gives the number of ACVC tests in various 
categories. All tests were processed, except those that were withdrawn 
because of test errors (item b; see section 2.1), those that require a 
floating-point precision that exceeds the implementation's maximum 
precision (item e; see section 2.2), and those that depend cmti the support 
of a file system — if none is supported (item d). All tests passed, 
except those that are listed in sections 2.1 and 2.2 (counted in items b 
and f, below).

3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were not loaded directly onto the host computer. The tape 
was loaded onto a Sun Workstation, and the tests were copied over Ethernet 
to the host machine. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host computer, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada inplementation. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the custcmner and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a connplete listing of 
the processing options for this inp)lementation. It also indicates the 
default options. The option invoked explicitly for validation testing 
during this test was: 

Option(s)/Switch Effect 

-w To suppress conpiler warning messages. 


Test output, conpiler and linker listings, and job logs were captured on 
magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site 
the validation team were also archived.

SYNTAX 

ada [options] tsource_file]... (object_file.o]... 

OPTIWS 

-# identifier type value (define) Define an identifier of a 
specified type a^ value. See VADS ADA PREPROCESSOR REFEREMCE. 

-A (disassemble) disassemble the units in the source file after ccxrpiling 
them. -A can be followed by arguments that further define the 
disassembly display (e.g. -Aa, -Ab, -Ad, -Af, -Al, -As): 

a add hexadecimal display of instruction bytes to disassembly 
listing 

b disassemble the unit body [default] 
d print the data section (if present) as well 
f use the alternative format for output 

1 put the disassembly output in file "file_name.das" 

s disassemble the unit spec 

-a file_name (archive) Treat file^name as an object 
archive file created by ar. Since some archive files end 
with .a, -a is used to distinguish archive files from Ada 
source files. 

-DG (debug flag) Force frong end to write out the gnrx.lib 
file in ASCII format. To use this option, you must 
con^jile a file that changes the gnrx.lib file. 

-d (dependencies) Analyze for dependencies only. Do not do 
semantic analysis or code generation, l^xlate the library, 
marking any defined units as unconqpiled. Ihe -d option is 
used by a.make to establish dependencies among new files. 

-e (error) Process ccxnpilation error messages using a.error 
and send it to standard output. Only the source lines 
containing errors are listed. Only one -e or -E option 
should be used. 

-E 

-E file 

-E directory (error output) Without a file or directory 
argument, ada processes error messages using a.error and 
directs a brief output to standard output; the raw error 
messages are left in ada_source.err. If a file pathname is 
given, the raw error messages are placed in that file. If a 
directory argument is supplied, the raw error output is 
placed in dir/source.err. Ihe file of raw error messages can 
be used as input to a.error

-el (error listing) Intersperse error messages among source 
lines and direct to standard output. 


-El 

-El file 

-El directory (error listing) Same as the -E option, except 
that source listing with errors is produced. 

-ev (error vi(l)) Process syntax error messages using 
a.error, embed them in the source file, and call the 
environment editor ERROR_EDITOR. (If ERROR_EDITOR is 
defined, the environment variable ERROR_PATTERN should also 
be defined. ERROR_PATTERN is an editor search command that 
locates the first occurrence of '###' in the error file.) If 
no editor is specified, vi(l) is invoked. 

-K (keep) Keep the intermediate language (IL) file 
produced by the conpiler front end. The IL file will be 
placed in the .objects directory, with the file name 
Ada_source.i 

-L library_name (library) Operate in VADS library 
library_naroe (Default: current working directory] 

-lfile_abbreviation (library search) This is an option 
passed to the UNIX linker, ld(l) telling it to search the 
specified library file. (No space between the -1 and the 
file abbreviation.) 

For a description of the file abbreviations, see also 
Operating system documentation, ld(l). 

-M unit_naroe (main) Produce an executable program by 
linking the named unit as the main program, \jnit_name must 
already be ccnt^iled. It must be either a parameterless 
procedure or a parameterless function returning an integer. 

The executable program will be named a.out unless overridden 
with the -o option. 

-M source_file (main) Produce an executable program by 
compiling and linking source_file. The main unit of the 
program is assxmied to be the root name of the .a file (for 
foo.a the unit is foo). Only one .a file nay be preceded by 
-M. The executable program will be named a.out (self-hosted) or 
a.vox (cross-development) unless overridden with the -o option. 

-o executable file (output) This option is to be used in 
conjunction with the -M option. executable_file is the name 
of the executable rather than the default a.out. 

-0(0-9] (optimize) Invoke the code optimizer. An optional digit 
(there is no space before the digit) provides the level of 
optimization. The default is -04.

-O full optimization 

-OO prevents optimization 

-01 no hoisting 

-02 no hoisting but more passes 

-03 no hoisting but even more passes 

-04 hoisting from loops 

-05 hoisting from loops but more passes (and instruction 
scheduling, if available) 

-06 hoisting from loops with maximum passes (and instruction

-07 hoisting from loops and branches (and instruction) 
scheduling, if available) 

-08 hoisting from loops and branches, more passes (and 
instruction scheduling, if available) 

-09 hoisting from loops and branches, maximum passes (and 
instruction scheduling, if available) 

Hoisting from branches (and cases alternatives) can be slow 
and does not always provide significant performance gains so 
it can be suppressed. 

For more information about optimization, see COMPILING ADA 
PROGRAMS, Conpiler Optimizations. See also pragma 
OPTIMIZE_CODE(OFF). 

-P Invoke the Ada Preprocessor. See VADS ADA PREPROCESSOR 
REFERENCE. 

-R VADS_library (reconcile instantiation) Force analysis 
of all generic instantiations, causing reinstantiation of 
any that are out of date. 

-S (suppress) ^ply pragma SUPPRESS to the entire 
compilation for all suppressible checks. (See also pragma 
SUPPRESS (ALL_CHECKS). 

-sh (show) Display the name of the tool executable but do 
not execute it. 

-T (timing) Print timing information for the compilation. 

-V (verbose) Print compiler version number, date and time 
of compilation, name of file ccmpiled, comroarxl input line, 
total compilation time, and error summary line. Storage 
usage information about the c±)ject file is provided. 

-w (warnings) Suppress warning diagnostics. 

DESCRIPTION 

The command ada executes the Ada compiler and compiles the 
named Ada source file, ending with the .a suffix. The file 
must reside in a VADS library directory. The ada.lib file in 


B-4 






COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


this directory is modified after each Ada \init is compiled. 

By default, ada produces only object and net files. If the 
-M option is used, the conpiler automatically invokes a.Id 
and builds a conpiete program with the named library unit as 
the main program. 

Non-Ada object files (.o files produced by a conpiler for 
another language) may be given as arguments to ada. These 
files will be passed on to the linker and will be linked 
with the specified Ada object files. 

Command line options may be specified in any order, but the 
order of compilation and the order of the files to be passed 
to the linker can be significant. 

Several VADS compilers may be simultaneously available on a 
single system. Because the ada command in any 
VADS location/bin on a system will execute the correct 
compTler conponents based upon visible library directives, 
the option -sh is provided to print the name of the 
components actually executed. 

Program listings with a disassembly of machine code 
instructions are generated by a.db or a.das. 

See also a.das, a.db, a.error, a.Id, a.mklib, arx3 Operating 
System reference documentation for the ld(l) utility. 

DIAGNOSTICS 

The diagnostics produced by the VADS compiler are intended 
to be self-explanatory. Most refer to the RM. Each RM 
reference includes a section number and optionally, a paragrajh 
number enclosed in parentheses.

a.Id collects the object files needed to make unit_name a main 
program and calls the UNIX linker ld(l) to link together all Ada 
and other language objects required to produce an executable image 
in a.out (self-hosted) or a.vox (cross- development), unit name is 
the main program and must name a non-generic subprogram. I^unit name 
is a function, it must return a value of the type STANDARD.INTEGER. 

This integer result will be passed back to the UNIX shell as the status 
code of the execution. The utility uses the net files produced ly the Ada 


B-6 


COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


compiler to check dependency information, a.Id produces an exception 
mapping table and a \mit elaboration table and passes this information 
to the linker. The elaboration list generated by a.Id does not include 
library level packages that do not need elaboration. In addition, 
packages that contain no code that can raise an exception will no longer 
have exception tables. 

a.Id reads instructions for generating executables from the ada.lib file 
in the VADS libraries on the search list. Besides information generated 
by the compiler, these directives also include WlTHn directives that 
allow the automatic linking of object modules conpiled from other 
languages or Ada object monies not neuned in context clauses in the Ada 
source. Any number of WITHn directives may be placed into a library, but 
they must be numbered contiguously beginning at WITHl. The directives 
are recorded in the library's ada.lib file and have the following form. 

WITHl;LINK:object_file: 

WITH2;LINK:archive file: 


WITHn directives may be placed in the local Ada libraries or in any 
VADS library on the search list. 

A WITHn directive in a local VADS library or earlier on the library 
search list will hide the same numbered WITHn directive in a library 
later in the library search list. 

Use the tool a.info to change or report library directives in the 
current library. 


All arguments after unit_naroe are passed on to the linker. These may 
be options for it, archive libraries, library abbreviations, or 
object files. 


VADS_location/bin/a.ld is a wrafper program that executes the correct 
executable based upon directives visible in the ada.lib file. This 
permits multiple VADS compilers to exist on the same host. The -sh 
option prints the name of the actual executable file.

C-1 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


APPENDIX F. Inplenventation-Dependent Characteristics 


1. Inplementation-Dependent Pragmas 

1.1. INLINE_CINLY Pragma 

The INLINE_0NLY pragma, v^en used in the same way as pragma 
INLINE, indicates to the con^jiler that the subprogram must 
always be inlined. This pragma also suppresses the genera¬ 
tion of a callable version of the routine which saves code 
space. If a user erroneously makes 2 m iNLINEjONLY subpro¬ 
gram recursive a warning message will be emitted and an 
PROGRAM_ERROR will be raised at nm time. 

1.2. INITIALIZE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers STATIC or DYNAMIC as the single 
argument. This pragma is only allowed within a library- 
level package spec or body. It specifies that all objects 
in the package be initialized as requested the pragma 
(i.e. statically or dynamically). Only library-level 
objects are sii)ject to static initialization; all objects 
within procedures are always (by definition) dynamic. If 
pragma INITIALIZE(STATIC) is used, and an object cannot be 
initialized statically, code will be generated to initialize 
the object and a warning message will be generated. 

1.3. BUILT_IN Pragma 

The BUILT IN pragma is used in the inplementation of some 
predefined Ada packages, but provides no user access. It is 
used only to implement code b^ies for which no actual Ada 
body can be provided, for exan?)le the MACHINE_OODE package. 

1.4. SHARE_CC»E Pragma 

The SHARE_CODE pragma takes the name of a generic instantia¬ 
tion or a generic unit as the first argument and one of the 
identifiers TRUE or FALSE as the second argument. This 
pragma is only allowed immediately at the place of a 
declarative item in a declarative part or package specifica- 


C-2 






APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


tion, or after a library unit in a compilation, but before 
any subsequent compilation unit. 

When the first argument is a generic unit the pragma applies 
to all instantiations of that generic. When the first argu¬ 
ment is the name of a generic instantiation the pragma 
applies only to the specified instantiation, or overloaded 
instantiations. 

If the second argument is TRUE the compiler will try to 
share code generated for a generic instantiation with code 
generated for other instantiations of the same generic. 
When the second argument is FALSE each instantiation will 
get a unique copy of the generated code. The extent to 
^ich code is shared between instantiations depends on this 
pragma and the kind of generic formal parameters declared 
for the generic unit. 

The name pragma SHARE_BODY is also recognized by the imple¬ 
mentation and has the same effect as SHARE_CODE. It is 
included for conpatability with earlier versions of VADS. 

1.5. NO_IMAGE Pragma 

The pragma suppresses the generation of the image array used 
for the IMAGE attribute of enxjmeration types. This elim¬ 
inates the overhead required to store the array in the exe¬ 
cutable image. An attempt to use the IMAGE attribute on a 
type vhose image array has been suppressed will result in a 
compilation warning and PROGRAM_ERROR raised at rxm time. 

1.6. EXTERNAL_NAME Pragma 

The EXTERNAL NAME pragma takes the n^une of a subprogram or 
variable defined in Ada and allows the user to specify a 
different external name that may be used to reference the 
entity from other languages. The pragma is allowed at the 
place of a declarative item in a package specification euid 
must apply to an object declared earlier in the same package 
specification. 

1.7. INTERFACE_NAME Pragma 

The INTERFACE_NAME pragma takes the name of a a variable or 
subprogram defined in another language and allows it to be 
referenced directly in Ada. The pragma will replace all 
occurrences of the variable or subprogram name with an 
external reference to the second, link_argument. The pragma 
is allowed at the place of a declarative item in a package 
specification and must af^ly to an object or sul^rogram 
declared earlier in the same package specification. The 
object must be declared as a scalar or an access type. The 
object cannot be any of the following: 


C-3 






APPEM)IX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


a Icxjp variable, 
a constant, 

an initialized variable, 
an array, or 
a record. 

1.8. IMPLICIT_CC»E Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine c^e 
procedure. It specifies that inplicit code generated by the 
conpiler be allowed or disallowed. A warning is issued if 
OFF is used and any implicit code needs to he generated. 
The default is ON. 

1.9. 0PTIMIZE_C(X)E Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies whether the code should be optim¬ 
ized by the compiler. The default is ON. VJhen OFF is 
specified, the compiler will generate the code as specified. 

2. Implementation of Predefined Pragmas 

2.1. CONTROLLED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 

2.2. ELABORATE 

This pragma is implemented as described in appendix B of the 
Ada RN. 

2.3. INLINE 

This pragma is implemented as described in i^ppendix B of the 
Ada RN. 

2.4. INTERFACE 

This pragma supports calls to and FORTRAN functions. The 
Ada suiprograms can be either functions or procedures. The 
types of parameters and the result type for functions must 
be scalar, access or the predefined type ADDRESS in SYSTEM. 
All parameters must have mode IN. Record and array objects 
can be passed by reference using the AIX>RESS attribute. 

2.5. LIST 

This pragma is implemented as described in ^pendix B of the 
Ada RN. 


C-4 





APPENDIX F OF TOE Ada STANDARD 


2.6. MEMORY_SIZE 

TOis pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.7. NON_REENTRANT 

This pragma takes one argument which can be the name of 
either a library subprogram or a subprogram declared immedi¬ 
ately within a library package spec or body. It indicates 
to the conpiler that the subprogram will not be called 
recursively allowing the cottpiler to perform specific optim¬ 
izations. The pragma can be applied to a subprogram or a 
set of overloaded subprograsm within a package spec or pack¬ 
age body. 

2.8. NOT_ELABORATED 

This pragma can only appear in a library package specifica¬ 
tion. It indicates that the package will not be elaborated 
because it is either part of the RTS, a configuration pack¬ 
age or an Ada package that is referenced from a language 
other than Ada. The presence of this pragma suppresses the 
generation of elaboration code and issues warnings if ela¬ 
boration code is required. 

2.9. OPTIMIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 

2.10. PACK 

This pragma will cause the conpiler to choose a non-aligned 
representation for conposite types. It will not causes 
objects to be packed at the bit level. 

2.11. PAGE 

This pragma is inplemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.12. PASSIVE 

The pragma has three forms : 

PRAGMA PASSIVE; 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(SEMAPHORE); 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(INTERRUPT, <number>); 


This pragma Pragma passive can be applied to a task or task

type declared immediately within a library package spec or 
body. The pragma directs the compiler to optimize certain 
tasking operations. It is possible that the statements in a 
task body will prevent the intended optimization, in these 
cases a warning will be generated at compile time and will 
raise TASKING_ERROR at runtime. 

2.13. PRIORITY 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RN. 

2.14. SHARED 

This pragma is recognized by the inplementation but has no 
effect. 

2.15. STORAGE_UNIT 

This pragma is recognized by the inplementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be reconciled. 

2.16. SUPPRESS 

This pragma is inplemented as described, except that 
DIVISION CHECK and in scxne cases OVERFLOW_CHECK cannot be 
supresseH. 

2.17. SYSTEM_NAME 

This pragma is recognized by the inplementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be reccmcil®<J' 

3. Implementation-Dependent Attributes 

3.1. P'REF 

For a prefix that denotes an object, a program unit, a 
label, or an entry; 

This attribute denotes the effective address of the first of 
the storage units allocated to P. For a suhci^ogram, pack¬ 
age, task unit, or label, it refers to the address of the 
machine code associated with the corresponding body or 
statement. For an entry for \^ich an address clause has 
been given, it refers to the corresponding hardware inter¬ 
rupt. The attribute is of the type OPERAND defined in the 
package MACHINE_CODE. The attribute is only allowed within 
a machine code procedure. 

See section F.4.8 for more information on the use of this

attribute. 

(For a package, task unit, or entry, the 'REF attribute is 
not supported.) 

3.2. T'TASKID 

For a task object or a value T, T'TASK_ID yields the unique 
task id associated with a task. The value of this attribute 
is of the type ADDRESS in the package SYSTEM.

5. Restrictions On Representation Clauses 

5.1. Pragma PACK 

In the absence of pragma PACK record ccmiponents are padded 
so as to provide for efficient access by the target 
hardware, pragma PACK applied to a record eliminate the pad¬ 
ding where possible. Pragma PACK has no other effect on the 
storage allocated for record conponents a record representa¬ 
tion is required. 

5.2. Size Clauses 

For scalar types a representation clause will pack to the 
number of bits required to represent the range of the sub- 
type. A size clause applied to a record type will not cause 
packing of components; an explicit record representation 
clause must be given to specify the packing of the com¬ 
ponents. A size clause applied to a record type will cause 
packing of conponents only when the conponent type is a 
discrete type. An error will be issued if there is insuffi¬ 
cient space allocated. The SIZE attribute is not suK»rted 
for task, access, or floating point types. 

5.3. Address Clauses 

Address clauses are only supported for variables. Since 
default initialization of a variable requires evaluation of 
the variable address elaboration ordering requirements 
prohibit inititalization of a variables vhich have address 
clauses. The specified address indicates the physical 
address associated with the variable. 

5.4. Interrupts 

Interupt entries are not supported. 

5.5. Representation Attributes 

The ADDRESS attribute is not suj^rted for the following 
entities: 

Packages 

Tasks 

Labels 

Entries 

5.6. Machine Code Insertions 


C-9 



APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


Machine code insertions are supported. 

The general definition of the package MACHINE_CODE provides 
an assembly language interface for the target machine. It 
provides the necessary record type(s) needed in the code 
statement, an enumeration type of all the opcode mneumonics, 
a set of register definitions, and a set of addressing mode 
functions. 

The general syntax of a machine code statement is as fol¬ 
lows: 


CODE_n'( opcode, operand {, operand} ); 

\diere n indicates the number of operemds in the aggregate. 

A special case arises for a variable number of operemds. 
The operands are listed within a subaggregate. The format 
is as follows: 

CODE_N'( opcode, (operand {, operand}) ); 

For those opcodes that require no operands, named notation 
must be used (cf. RM 4.3(4)). 

CODE_0'( op »> opcode ); 

The opcode must be an enumeration literal (i.e. it cannot be 
an object, attribute, or a rename). 

An operand can only be an entity defined in MACHINE_CX»E or 
the 'REF attribute. 

The arguments to emy of the functions defined in 
MAaiINE_CODE must be static expressions, string literals, or 
the functions defined in MACHINE_CC»E. The 'REF attribute 
may not be used as an argument in any of these functions. 

Inline expansion of machine code procedures is su{^rted. 

6. Conventions for In^lementation-generated Names 
There are no implementation-generated names. 

7. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clauses 

Address expressions in an address clause are interpreted as 
physical addresses. 

8. Restrictions on Unchecked Conversions 
None. 


C-10 







APPENDIX F OF TOE Ada STANDARD 


9. Restrictions on Unchecked Deallocations 
None. 


10. Inplementation Characteristics of I/D Packages 

Instantiations of DIRECT_IO use the value MAX REC_SIZE as 
the record size (expressed in STORAGEJUNITS) when the size 
of ELEMENTjryPE exceeds that value. For example for uncon¬ 
strained arrays such as string vdiere ELEMENT_TYPE'SIZE is 
very large, MAX_REC_SIZE is used instead. MAX_RECORD_SIZE 
is defined in SYSTEM and can be chauiged by a program before 
instantiating DIRECT_IO to provide an upper limit on the 
record size. In any case the maximum size supported is 1024 
X 1024 X STORAGEJUNIT bits. DIRECT_IO will raise USE_ERROR 
if MAX_REC_SIZE exceeds this absolute limit. 

Instantiations of SEQUENTIAL_IO use the value MAX_REC_SIZE 
as the record size (expressed in STORAGEJUNITS) when the 
size of ELEMENT JTYPE exceeds that value. For example for 
unconstrained arrays such as string where ELEMENTJTYPE'SIZE 
is very large, MAX REC_SIZE is used instead. 
MAX_RECORD SIZE is defineH in SYSTEM and can be changed by a 
program beTore instantiating INTEGER_I0 to provide an upper 
limit on the record size. SBQUENTIAL_IO inposes no limit on 
MAX_REC_SIZE. 

11. Inpleraentation Limits 

The following limits are actually enforced by the implemen¬ 
tation. It is not intended to imply that resources up to or 
even near these limits are available to every program. 


11.1. Line Length 

Ihe implementation supports a maximum line length of 500 
characters including the end of line character. 

11.2. Record and Array Sizes 

Ihe maximum size of a statically sized array type is 
4,000,000 X STORAGE_UNITS. Ihe m 2 ucimum size of a statically 
sized record type is 4,000,000 x STORAGEJUNITS. A record 
type or array type declaration that exceeds these limits 
will generate a warning message. 

11.3. Default Stack Size for Tasks 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGE_SIZE length specifica¬ 
tion every task except the main program is allocated a fixed 
size stack of 10,240 STORAGE IX^ITS. This is the value 


C-11 






APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


returned by T'STORAGE_SIZE for a task type T. 

11.4. Default Collection Size 

In the absence of an explicit ST0RAGE_SI2E length attribute 
the default collection size for an access type is 100 times 
the size of the designated type. Ihis is the value returned 
by T'ST0RAGE_SIZE for an access type T. 

11.5. Limit on Declared Objects 

There is an absolute limit of 6,000,000 x ST0RAGE_UNITS for 
objects declared statically within a compilation \anit. If 
this value is exceeded the compiler will terminate the com¬ 
pilation of the unit with a FATAL error message.
