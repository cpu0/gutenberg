x-archive-meta-description: The infrared and ultraviolet spectra of planetary nebula NGC 2440 is presented. The observations were made respectively by the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) These data, in conjunction with published optical observations have been used to derive electron temperature and density. A trend of electron temperature with ionization potential is found. In particular the electron temperature increases from 11000 to 18000 K with increasing IBM. The electron density has a constant value of 4500/cu cm in agreement with previous determination. The chemical abundance has been derived for the following elements; helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, sulfur and argon. The ionization correction factor turns out to be very small (almost unnecessary) for all species except sulfur.
