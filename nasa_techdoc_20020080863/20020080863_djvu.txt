Abstract. The infrared and ultraviolet spectra of planetary nebula NGC 2440 is presented. The observations 
were m£ide respectively by the Infreired Space Observatory (ISO) and International Ultraviolet Explorer (lUE). 
These data, in conjunction with jmblished optical observations have been used to derive electron temperature and 
density. A trend of electron temperature with ionization potential is found. In particular the electron temperature 
increases from 11000 to 18 000 K with increasing IP. The electron density has a constcint value of 4500 cm~^ 
in agreement with previous determination. The chemical abundance has been derived for the folowing elements; 
helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, sulfur and cirgon. The ionization correction factor turns out to be very 
small (almost innecces£iry) for all species except sulfur.

1. Introduction 

NGC 2440 has a highly and ioniztd spectrum. It has 
been of great scientific interest for astronomers for 
different reasons: The nebula present a complex bipolar 
or multipolar morphology, effects of stratification (Walker 
& AUer, 1970), and strong Nil lines (Shields et al., 
1981). The latter Iccids to a high (litrogen abundance, 
that together with the high helium abundance, classify 
it as Type I nebula (Peimbert, 1978). The earlier studies 
by Shields et al. (1981) give an electron density of 3000 
cm~^ £ind cin electron temperatur*; of 14000 for the 
Oiii. Later studies by Hyung & Aller (1998) leaded to 
a higher density of 5000 cm~^ but agree on the electron 
temperature finding 14200 K and 1(1000 K for Olll and 
N II respectively. 

ISO and lUE provide valuable information which 
allow us to precisely derive the eh^ctron density (N^), 
temperature (Te) and the nebular abundance. Infrared 
lines avoid many problems usually encountered when 
deriving abundamces, especially temperature fluctuations. 
This is of particulcir interest because infrcired lines are 
insensitive to this effect, which could be present in the

Kingdom) and with the participation of ISAS and NASA 



nebula. This and other advcmtages cire briefly discussed 
in recent papers by Pottasch & Beintema (1999) and 
Bernard Salas et al. (2001). 

The following section of this paper will be devoted to 
the ISO and lUE observations. The nebula is bigger than 
both ISO-SWS and lUE apertures Jind because of dust ab- 
sorption (although small) the fluxes need to be corrected 
for extinction. This is discussed in section 3. In section 4 
the line fluxes (infrared, optical and ultraviolet) are pre- 
sented. In section 5 the N^ and T^ are derived as well as 
the abundcince for the nebula. In section 6 a complete dis- 
cussion of the parcimeters previously derived, T^, Njand 
abundcinces is given. The conclusions are given in the last 
section. 

2. ISO and iUE observations 

The infrcired observations were mcide with the Short 
Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) on board ISO. 
Information about this instrument can be found in 
de Graauw et al. (1996). The wavelength range covered 
by the instrument is from 2.38 to 45.2 pm. The obser- 
vation used correspond to a SWSOl observing template, 
TDT number 72501762. This is a fast observation corre- 
sponding to Speed 2 cmd was reduced at a fix spectral 
resolution of 400. The observations were centered at 
RA(2000) 07*41*^55.4^ and Dec(2000)-18°12'31.8". 
Pointing errors in ISO are uncertain by about 3". In 
Fig. 1 the SWS spectrum of NGC 2440 is presented. 



Bernard Salas et al.: An ISO and lUE study of Planetary Nebula NGC2440 




In this work the observed lines have been corrected 
by extinction using Cff^=0.50. This leads to Eb-v=0.34. 
The predicted F^^ has been determined in two ways. 

One way to measure the extinction is using the pre- 
dicted FHf given by radio fluxes. Applying the following 
equation: 



Fig. 1. SWS spectrum of NGC2440. The continuum is very 
low. Strong lines are measured and havi! been labeled. No PAH 
features are present. 



Standard reduction techniques were applied and no 
major problems were encountered. Information about 
these tools used to reduce the data, cam be found in the 
interactive amcilysis software package distributed by the 
SWS consortium. The observed infrared intensities are 
given in Table 2. 

Maybe Feibelman can comment a little bit more 
about the lUE observations Tht!re are several ultravi- 
olet observations made with the International Ultraviolet 
Explorer (lUE). Two low resolution spectra and two high 
ones were used in this paper. When not avcdlable ultra- 
violet measurements from Shields et al. (1981) were also 
used. The low resolution spectra are labeled SWP 07262 
and LWR 06256 and the high ones as SWP 07263 and 
LWR 10741.The observed ultraviolet intensities are given 
in Table 3 



3. Corrections to line fluxes 

All fluxes measured, infrared, ultraviolet and optical, have 
been corrected for extinction (although the correction in 
the infrared is very small). Because of the size of the neb- 
ula £ind relative smadl aperture size of the instruments, 
aperture corrections have been app ied. 



3.1. Extinction 

In the previous work by Shields et <U. (1981) a 0^^=0.63 

was found (where Ch.= loq(U^ ''V-"""[ )), although 



FiH^) = 



2.82 109 tO-53 (1 + ^ + 3.7^^) 



(1) 



the expect H^ flux can be found. In eq. 1 5^=0.411 
Jy at 5 GHz (Pottasch , 1984), t is the temperature of 
the nebula in lO^K ( in this case T, =15 000 is used) and 
2.82 10® is a conversion factor if the flux density S„ in Jy 
£ind the F(H^) in erg cm~^ s~^. The helium abundances 
are taken from Table 7 and have been derived using 
the theoretical predictions of Benjamin et al. (1999) 
at a Ne=10000 cm"' (using Ne=100 cm-^ will lead 
to the same values). Eq. (1) leads to a predicted H^ of 



91.0 10"" erg cm 



-^s-^ 



The extinction factor is thus 



Ci/^=0.46. This is in good agreement with what Hyung 
& Aller (1998) (Ci/^=0.53) found. An average of those 
two (C^=0.50) has been used in the present paper to 
correct for extinction. 



3.2. Aperture corrections 

NGC2440 has a measured size (Shields et al., 1981) of 
10" for the msdn body and a faint envelope that extends 
up to 30". ISO-SWS uses diflferent size apertures for the 
different bands. These sizes range from 14"x 20" (the 
smallest), to larger apertures 14"x 27", 20"x 27" and 
20" X 33". The aperture of the lUE is very similar to 
ISO-SWS smallest aperture, it's an elUpse of 10"x 23". It 
is likely that some of the nebula is missing and, because 
of the similarity in aperture size, the correction factor in 
the infrared and ultraviolet will be similar. 

In order to correct the infrared lines from apertures 
eff'ects the SWS measurements have been compared with 
those from the Infriired Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), 
which has an aperture big enough to contain the whole 
nebula. This comparison is shown in Table 1. The SWS 
and IRAS fluxes (Pottasch , 1986) are shown in columns 
4 eind 5. In the last column the scale factor to reproduce 
the IRAS measurements (basically F*'"'"/F''"") is given. 

The advantage of this is that the Unes IRAS has mea- 
sured lie on different SWS apertures so that a correction 
for each one can be applied. As can be seen in Table 1 the 
IRAS fluxes for Ne vi and S IV is hieeer than in the fliuces

flux is missing in these apertures. Tiierefore, all measure- 
ments with the large aperture are sating the whole nebula. 
Only in the smallest aperture some flux is missing. The 
aperture correction fcictor are 1.35 and 1.72 for Ne VI and 
S IV. Although the Ne Vi line from IRAS is noisy an av- 
erage scale factor of 1.54 is found from both lines. This 
average factor should be correct witain ±0.2. 

The Bra line at 4.043 /im (3.91 10~^^ erg cm-^ s"^) 
leads to a very low H^ flux (57.0 10" ^^ erg cm~^ s"-') be- 
cause it is being underestimated. This fact can been used 
to correct the infrjired lines by sciJing the Bra line in 
order to get the proper predicted H^ flux (which is 91.0 
10"-'^ erg cm~^ s~^). The observed flux for this line is 4.00 



10- 



erg cm

The theoretical prediction given by 
Hummer & Storey (1987) at Te=15000 K and Ne=1000 
cm~^ (using Ne=10000 cm~^ will lead to the SEime con- 
clusions) leads to I(Br„/H^)=6.86 10-^ Therefore, the 
expected H^ flux is Fk^=58.3 10-^^ erg cm'^ 8"^ If this 
is compared with the predicted one, an aperture correc- 
tion factor of 1.56 is found which agrees with the average 
factor derived before. Therefore a factor of 1.56 has been 
adopted to correct the measurements done in the smallest 
SWS aperture (below 12 /im). 

To correct the ultraviolet lines tlie fact that the ratio 
of the helium lines F(A1640)/F(A4686)=6.94 (for a Te= 
15000 K) has been used. Using tlie dereddened fluxes 
listed in Tables 3 and 4 a ratio of 3.54 is found. The 
scaling factor becomes 1.96, which ve shall use. 

The optical data used in this study has been tciken 
from Hyung & AUer (1998). These fluxes cire only rep- 
resent part of the nebula, speciiicaJ'.y the brightest part 
of the northern blob using a slit of 4". Using the entire 
H^flux, they have been scaled to th( total flux.

' Dereddened fluxes using Ch^=0.50 

^ Aperture corrected and dereddened fluxes: Lines up to 12 
fiia have been applied an aperture correction factor of 1.56 
while for the rest of the lines (from 12 fim to 45.2 /im) no 
aperture correction fcictor has been applied. 



that no weak lines are found. Only one hydrogen line (Br^) 
and one helium line at 9.26 /im are found. High ioniza- 
tion stages for Argon (Ar Vl), neon (Nevi) and magnesium 
(Mg v) have been measured. The strongest line is that of 
O IV. Argon, neon jind sulfur are all present in the most 
important stages of ionization. 

Calibration errors increase at longer wavelength, but 
on average they amount to about 20%. Fluctuation errors 
depends on the line strength, and they decrease with 
line strength. Normally weak lines (7 < 5, where I is 
in 10~^^ erg cm~^ s~^) have estimated errors of about 
20%, intermediate lines (5 < / < 10) of about 10%, while 
the strongest lines (/ > 10), have normcdly less than 5% 
uncertcunty. There is just one exception, the sulfur line at 
18.712 at /xm, in which both up and down scan differs by 
40%. 



4.2. Ultraviolet spectrum 

In the lUE spectra fifty lines were mejisured. Nitrogen, 
oxygen, carbon, magnesium an silicon lines are abundant. 
In Table 3 the observed fluxes are listed in column 3. The 
extinction law applied (Fluks et al. , 1994) is given in col-

Siii, Ann, Oiii, Nelll and Nev. The helium lines were 
iised to derive the helium abundance. The rest of the 
ion were included to have information on several missing 
stages of ionization. 

For the N il the average values for the lines at 575.5 and 
658.4 nm. given by Perinotto & Corradi (1998) have 
been included. They measure the flux in different regions 
of the nebula from the center {cen), to positive increasing 
distances from the center {pl,p2, etc..) and negative 
increasing distances {nl,n2, etc.). The different values 
given by Hyung & Aller (1998) and Perinotto & Corradi 
(1998) leads to different T^ which can slightly affect the 
relative abundcinces derived for low ionization potentials 
(IP) ions. 



5. Physical parameters and abundance 

5.1. Electron density 

Ne has been derived for nine ions. A Te=15000 K has 
been assumed and a justification for this choice is given in 
the following subsection. The N^ is shown in Table 5, and 
as can be seen, Ne seems to be const£int for all the ions 
except for S III and Ar V. For comparison, the N^ found by 
Keenan et al. using the R-matrix method in successive pa- 
pers in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999 for S II, Ar iv, Ne IV and 
O II respectively have been included in the table. An aver- 
age of about 4000 cm~^ is found. In the paper by Hyung 
& Aller (1998) an average N^ of 5000 cm~' is found. If 
the average N« is derive from Table 5, but excluding the 
Slll and Arv ratio, a value of 4500 cm~' is found. This 
is in good agreement with the N« given by Hyung & Aller 
(1998) and Keenan et al. (1996,1997,1998,1999) and there- 
fore has been adopted to derive the T^ and abundcinces. 



T^ble 5. Electron density. T<=15 000 K is used. 



if not possible data form Shields et al. (1981) was used. 
The low resolution spectra was preferred because the Ccil- 
ibration is better. 

Maybe Feibelman want to comments something 
about errors or something 

4.3. Optical data 

Together with the infrared and ultraviolet data, optical 
lines were also used to derive the piiysical parsuneters of 
the nebula, and to have information in some stages of 
ionization that weren't observed neither in the infrared nor 
ultraviolet. The observed fluxes wert taken from Hyung & 
AUer (1998), and corrected for reddening. The NeV line

using the lines fluxes given by Perinotto & Corradi (1998). The

physical behavior (see discussion Sect. 6.2.) 



The Te for twelve different ions has been derived aind 
are shown in Table 6. These temj)eratures are plotted 
against the ionization potential in Fig. 2. The curve rep- 
resent the trend of the T^ with the ionization potentieJ

The values given by Keenan et al. (1997, 1998, 1999) 
are also shown in Table 6 The Te derive for the N ll differs 
by 1400 K whenever the optical lines from Hyung & AUer 
(1998) or Perinotto & Corradi (1998) are used. In Fig. 
2 these values have been plotted with the exception of 
the Te determined with Nelll and Siii (using the 33.4 
Hm Une). The Neiil have been excl ided because in other 
nebulae studies (Pottasch & Beint<!ma (1999); Bernard 
Salas et al. (2001)) it usually gives a lower T«. Probably 
this has something to do with the atomic parameter data. 
The Te derive from the S III (631.2/33400) is not included 
because the infrared line is very noisy , instead the ratio 
631.2/18 700 has been used. It ailso should be notice that 
the S III ratio is sensitive to the adopted N^ and this could

5.3. Chemical abundances 

The element abundances for carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, 
neon, magnesium, argon and sulfur have been derived. 
Unfortunately for silicon and chlorine only one stage of 
ionization was measured which is not enough to properly 
derive the element abundance. The determination of the 
ionization correction factor (ICF) should have been too 
uncertcdn. The ions for which abvmdance have been de- 
rive are Usted in Table 7 

The equation used to determine these ionic abun- 
dances was: 



Ni. 



N„ 



Hon XT ^vl ^H, 
Ih0 ^Hg ^ul 



,1 \NionJ 



(2) 



In the equation Np is the density of the ionized 
hydrogen; lion/^Hs is the measured intensity of the ionic 
line, normalized to H^; A„( is the wavelength of the line 
and Xh^ is the wavelength of H^; aj/^ is the effective 
recombination coefficient for H^; A„i is the Einstein 
spontaneous transition rate for the line and finally 
N„/Nion is the ratio of the population of the level from 
which the line originates to the total population of the ion. 

As can be seen in Table 7 the ICF is 1 or 1.1 m all cases

6. Discussion 

6.1. Electron density 

The Ne has been derived for several ions which have differ- 
ent IP. This value seems to be constant, about 4500 cm~^, 
there is no trend with the IP. This r.ould means that the 
ejection of the outer layers has been constant with time. 
This supports the supposition made before, that the neb- 
ula is homogeneous. 



6.2. Electron temperature 

A trend of the T^ is found with tie IP. As previously 
studied by Bernard Salas et al. (200 1) for NGC 7027, this 
agree with a simple picture of the nebula where the high 
states of ionization cire reached clos-Br to the centred stair 
so they give higher temperatures, and the low states of 
ionization give lower Te because they are formed further 
away. As mentioned, to derive the atundances an /tes has 
to be assumed, that in this case is determined by the curve 
in Fig. 2. As can be seen in Fig. 2 thi;; trend at high IP not 
as well determined as at low IP, where this assumption 
is more important. For ions with low IP the abundance 
has been derive mainly with ultraviolet or optical data, 
cind these lines are sensitive to the Te adopted, where the 
curve is well determined. On the other hand abundances 
of ions at high IP have been deriv^xi from infrared and 
therefore are insensitive (or very little) in the adopted Te. 

6.3. Comparison of abundances 

The abundances derived have been compared to those 
found in the Sun, O, B stars and previous literature (see 
Table 8 for references). Helium and carbon agree with 
those found by Kwitter & Henry (1996). The carbon 
abundance found by Hyung & Aller (1998) seems too lit- 
tle. The nitrogen is half that found by the same authors. 
The ICF used by Hyung & Aller (1998) seems too large. 
On the other hand the oxygen and neon abundance agree 
quite well. The sulfur abundance is between those reported 
by Hyung & Aller (1998) and Kwit.ter & Henry (1996) 
cind finally the argon derived from Hyung & Aller (1998) 
is smaller than the present study. From the three elements 
carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, only oxygen is less abundant 
thcin in the Sun and O, B stars. Maybe some oxygen has 
been converted into carbon and nitrogen via cycle CNO. 
Neon and £irgon are smilar to O, B stars which could mean 
that the nebula hasn't formed any of these elements during 
its evolution. The sulfur is less abundant but the reason 
for this is not clear. 

Other interesting possibility is the comparison of the 
ratio of carbon, oxygen and/or nitn igen. This is shown in 
Tahlp 9 Thp N /n ratin is .1 t.imps bit crpr than in 'NdC. 709.7

is twice as big as any other source. The progenitor star of 
NGC 2440 must be much more massive than the Sun or 
NGC 7027 (3-4 M©, Bernard Salas et al. (2001)). This 
is also supported by the helium abundance which is also 
larger than £iny of these comparison sources.
