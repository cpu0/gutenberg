CHAPTER 1 


INTRODUCTION 


This Validation Summary Report (VSR) describes the extent to which a 
specific Ada compiler conforms to the Ada Standard, ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A. 

This report explains all technical terms used within it and thoroughly 
reports the results of testing this compiler using the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability (ACVC). An Ada compiler must be implemented 
according to the Ada Standard, and any implementation-dependent features 
must conform to the requirements of the Ada Standard. The Ada Standard 
must be implemented in its entirety, and nothing can be implemented that 
is not in the Standard. 

Even though all validated Ada compilers conform to the Ada Standard, it 
must be understood that some differences do exist between 
implementations. The Ada Standard permits some implementation 
dependencies--for example, the maximum length of identifiers or the 
maximum values of integer types. Other differences between compilers 
result from the characteristics of particular operating systems, 
hardware, or implementation strategies.—AJJL_the dependencies observed > y~lr 
during the process of testing this compiler are given in this report. 

The information in this report is derived from the test results produced 
during validation testing. The validation process includes submitting a 
suite of standardized tests, the ACVC, as inputs to an Ada compiler and 
evaluating the results. The purpose of validating is to ensure 
conformity of the compiler to the Ada Standard by testing that the 
compiler properly implements legal language constructs and that it 
identifies and rejects illegal language constructs. Tha testing also 
identifies behavior that is implementation dependent, but is permitted 
by the Ada Standard. Six classes of tests are used. These tests are 
designed to perform checks at compile time, at link time, and during 
execution.

1.1 PURPOSE OF THIS VALIDATION SUMMARY REPORT 


This VSR documents the results of the validation testing performed on an 
Ada compiler. Testing was carried out for the following purposes: 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs supported by the 
compiler that do not conform to the Ada Standard 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs not supported by 
the compiler but required by the Ada Standard 

. To determine that the implementation-dependent behavior is allowed 
by the Ada Standard 


On-site testing was completed 12-01-89 at Syscon Corporation, 
Washington, D.C.

Inapplicable An ACVC test that uses features of the language that a 

test compiler is not required to support or may legitimately 

support in a way other than the one expected by the 
test. 

Passed test An ACVC test for which a compiler generates the expected 
result. 

Target The computer which executes the code generated by the

Test A program that checks a compiler's conformity regarding 

a particular feature or a combination of features to the 
Ada Standard. In the context of this report, the term 
is used to designate a single test, which may comprise 
one or more files. 

Withdrawn An ACVC test found to be incorrect and not used to check 

test conformity to the Ada Standard. A test may be 
incorrect because it has an invalid test objective, 
fails to meet its test objective, or contains illegal or 
erroneous use of the language. 


1.5 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conformity to the Ada Standard is measured using the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains both legal and illegal Ada programs structured into six test 
classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name 
Identifies the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests 
are executable, and special program units are used to report their 
results during execution. Class B tests are expected to produce 
compilation errors. Class L tests are expected to produce errors 
because of the way in which a program library is used at link time. 

Class A tests ensure the successful compilation and execution of legal 
Ada programs with certain language constructs which cannot be verified 
at run time. There are no explicit program components in a Class A test 
to check semantics. For example, a Class A test checks that reserved 
words of another language (other than those already reserved in the Ada 
language) are not treated as reserved words by an Ada compiler. A Class 
A test is passed if no errors are detected at compile time and the 
program executes to produce a PASSED message. 


1-4 



Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. 

Class B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled 
and the resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that every 
syntax or semantic error in the test is detected. A Class B test is 
passed if every illegal construct that it contains is detected by the 
compiler. 

Class C tests check the run time system to ensure that legal Ada 
programs can be correctly compiled and executed. Each Class C test is 
self-checking and produces a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message 
indicating the result when it is executed. 

Class D tests check the compilation and execution capacities of a 
compiler. Since there are no capacity requirements placed on a compiler 
by the Ada Standard for some parameters--for example, the number of 
identifiers permitted in a compilation or the number of units in a 
library--a compiler may refuse to compile a Class D test and still be a 
conforming compiler. Therefore, if a Class D test fails to compile 
because the capacity of the compiler is exceeded, the test is classified 
as inapplicable. If a Class D test compiles successfully, it is 
self-checking and produces a PASSED or FAILED message during execution. 


Class E tests are expected to execute successfully and check 
implementation-dependent options and resolutions of ambiguities in the 
Ada Standard. Each Class E test is self-checking and produces a NOT 
APPLICABLE, PASSED, or FAILED message when it is compiled and executed. 
However, the Ada Standard permits an implementation to reject programs 
containing some features addressed by Class E tests during compilation. 
Therefore, a Class E test is passed by a compiler if it is compiled 
successfully and executes to produce a PASSED message, or if it is 
rejected by the compiler for an allowable reason. 

Class L tests check that incomplete or illegal Ada programs involving 
multiple, separately compiled units are detected and not allowed to 
execute. Class L tests are compiled separately and execution is 
attempted. A Class L test passes if it is rejected at link time--that 
is, an attempt to execute the main program must generate an error 
message before any declarations in the main program or any units 
referenced by the main program are elaborated. In some cases, an 
implementation may legitimately detect errors during compilation of the 
test. 

Two library units, the package REPORT and the procedure CHECK_FILE, 
support the self-checking features of the executable tests. The package 
REPORT provides the mechanism by which executable tests report PASSED, 
FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE results. It also provides a set of identity 
functions used to defeat some compiler optimizations allowed by the Ada 
Standard that would circumvent a test objective. The procedure 
CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of text files written by some 
of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada Standard. The operation 


1-5 







of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of executable tests. These 
tests produce messages that are examined to verify that the units are 
operating correctly. If these units are not operating correctly, then 
the validation is not attempted. 

The text of each test in the ACVC follows conventions that are intended 
to ensure that the tests are reasonably portable without modification. 
For example, the tests make use of only the basic set of 55 characters, 
contain lines with a maximum length of 72 characters, use small numeric 
values, and place features that may not be supported by all 
implementations in separate tests. However, some tests contain values 
that require the test to be customized according to 
implementation-specific values--for example, an illegal file name. A 
list of the values used for this validation is provided in Appendix C. 

A compiler must correctly process each of the tests in the suite and 
demonstrate conformity to the Ada Standard by either meeting the pass 
criteria given for the test or by showing that the test is inapplicable 
to the implementation. The applicability of a test to an 
implementation is considered each time the implementation is validated. 

A test that is inapplicable for one validation is not necessarily 
inapplicable for a subsequent validation. Any test that was determined 
to contain an illegal language construct or an erroneous language 
construct is withdrawn from the ACVC and, therefore, is not used in 
testing a compiler. The tests withdrawn at the time of this validation 
are given in Appendix D.

2.2 IMPLEMENIATION CHARACTERISTICS 


One of the purposes of validating compilers is to determine the behavior 
of a compiler in those areas of the Ada S tandar d that permit 
implementations to differ. Class D and E tests specifically check for 
such implementation differences. However, tests in other classes also 
characterize an implementation. Ihe tests demonstrate the following 
characteristics: 


a. Capacities. 

(1) The compiler correctly processes a compilation containing 
723 variables in the same declarative part. (See test 
D29002K.) 

(2) The compiler correctly processes tests containing loop 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See tests D55A03A. .H (8 
tests).) 

(3) The compiler correctly processes tests containing block 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See test D56001B .) 

(4) The compiler correctly processes tests containing recursive 
procedures separately compiled as subunits nested to 6 
levels. (See test D64Q05E.) 


b. Predefined types. 

(1) This implementation supports the additional predefined 
types IGNG_INTEGER in the package STANDARD. (See tests 
B86001T..Z (7 tests).) 


c. Expression evaluation. 

The order in which expressions are evaluated and the time at 
which constraints are checked are not defined by the language. 
While the ACVC tests do not specifically attempt to determine 
the order of evaluation of expressions, teso results Indicate 
the following: 

(1) All of the default initialization expressions for record 
components are evaluated before any value is checked for 
membership in a component's subtype. (See test C32117A.) 

(2) Assignments for subtypes are performed with the same 
precision as the base type. (See test C35712B.) 


2-2 







(3) This implementation uses no extra hits for extra precision 
and uses all extra bits for extra range. (See test 
C35903A.) 

(4) NUMERIC_ERRQR is raised for pre-defined integer comparison 

and for pre-defined integer membership. NO EXCEPTION is 
raised for large_int comparison or for large_int 
membership. NUMERIC_EKFOR is raised for s mall_ int 

comparison and for small_int membership when an integer 
literal operand in a canparison or membership test is 
outside the range of the base type. (See test C45232A.) 

(5) NUMERIC_ER1R0R is raised when a literal operand in a 
fixed-point canparison or membership test is outside the 
range of the base type. (See test C45252A.) 

(6) Underflow is gradual. (See tests C45524A. .B (2 
tests).) 


d. Rounding. 

The method by which values are rounded in type conversions is 
not defined by the language. While the ACVC tests do not 
specifically attempt to determine the method of rounding, the 
test results indicate the following: 

(1) The method used for rounding to integer is round away from 
zero. (See tests C46012A. .B (2 tests).) 

(2) The method used for rounding to longest integer is round 
away from zero. (See tests C46012A..B (2 tests).) 

(3) The method used for rounding to integer in static universal 
real expressions is round toward zero. (See test C4A014A.) 


e. Array types. 

An implementation is allowed to raise NUMERICJERRQR or 
CDNSTRAINr_ERFQR for an array having a 1 IENGIH that exceeds 
STANDARD. INTEGER' LAST and/or SYSTEM. MAX_INT. For this 
implementation: 

(1) Declaration of an array type or subtype declaration with 
more than SYSTEM. MAX_INT components raises NUMERIC_ERROR. 
(See test C36003A.) 

(2) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when 'LENGIH is applied to an array 
type with DTTEGER'IAST + 2 components. (See test C36202A.) 


2-3 



(3) NUMERIC_ERPOR is raised when 'LENGTH is applied to an array 
type with SYSTEM.MAX_INT + 2 components. (See test 
C36202B.) 

(4) A packed BOOLEAN array having a 'LENGTH exceeding 
INTEGER'LAST raises STORAGE_ERROR when the array objects 
are declared. (See test C52103X.) 

(5) A packed two-dimensional BOOLEAN array with more than 
INTEGER'LAST components raises STORAGEJERROR when the array 
objects are declared. (See test C52104Y.) 

(6) A null array with one dimension of length greater than 
INTEGER'LAST may raise NUMERIC_ERROR or OONSTRAINT_ERROR 
either when declared or assigned. Alternatively, an 
implementation may accept the declaration. However, 
lengths mus t match in array slice assignments. This 
implementation raises no exception. (See test E52103Y.) 

(7) In assigning one-dimensional array types, the expression is 
evaluated in its entirety before OONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression' s subtype is 
compatible with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

(8) In assigning two-dimensional array types, the expression is 
not evaluated in its entirety before OQNSTRAINT_EKRDR is 
raised when checking whether the expression's subtype is 
compatible with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

f. Discriminated types. 

(1) In assigning record types with discriminants, the 
expression is evaluated in its entirety before 
OQNSTRAINrjERROR is raised when checking whether the 
expression's subtype is compatible with the target's 
subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


g. Aggregates. 

(1) In the evaluation of a multi-dimensional aggregate, the 
test results indicate that all choices are evaluated before 
checking against the index type. (See tests C43207A and 
C43207B.) 

(2) In the evaluation of an aggregate containing subaggregates, 
all choices are evaluated before being checked for 
identical bounds. (See test E43212B.) 

(3) All choices were not evaluated before C0NS1RAINT_ERRDR is 
raised when a bound in a non-null range of a non-null 
aggregate does not belong to an index subtype. (See test 


2-4 







E43211B.) 


h. Pragmas. 


(1) Ihe pragma INLINE is supported for functions or procedures. 
(See tests IA3004A..B (2 tests), EA3004C..D (2 tests), and 
CA3004E..F (2 tests).) 

i. Generics. 

(1) Generic specifications and bodies can be compiled in 

separate compilations. (See tests CA1012A, CA2009C, 

CA2009F, BC3204C, and BC3205D.) 

(2) Generic unit bodies and their subunits can be compiled in 
separate compilations. (See test CA3011A.) 

(3) Generic subprogram declarations and bodies can be compiled 
in separate compilations. (See tests CA1012A and CA2009F.) 

(4) Generic library subprogram specifications and bodies can be 
compiled in separate compilations. (See test CA1012A.) 

(5) Generic nan-library subprogram bodies can be compiled in 
separate compilations from their stubs. (See test 
CA2009F.) 

(6) Generic package declarations and bodies can be compiled in 
separate compilations. (See tests CA2009C, BC3204C, and 
BC3205D.) 

(7) Generic library package specifications and bodies can be 
compiled in separate compilations. (See tests BC3204C and 
BC3205D.) 

(8) Generic non-library package bodies as subunits can be 
compiled in separate compilations. (See test CA2009C.) 

(9) Generic unit bodies and their subunits can be c o mp iled in 
separate compilations. (See test CA3011A.) 


j. Input and output. (Ihe director, AJFO, has determined 

(AI-00332) that every call to OPEN and CREATE must raise 
USE_ERFOR or NAMEJERRQR if file input/cutput is not supported. 
This implementation exhibits this behavior for SB2UENTIAL_I0, 
DIRECr_IO, and TEXT_IO. This implementation does not support 
any I/O). 

(1) Ihe package SEQCJENITAL_lO cannot be instantiated with 
unconstrained array types and record types with 


2-5 






discriminants without defaults. (See tests AE2101C, 

EE2201D, and EE2201E.) 

(2) The package DIRECT_IO cannot be instantiated with 

unconstrained array types or record types with 
discriminants without defaults. (See tests AE2101H, 

EE2401D, and EE2401G.) 

(3) U5E_ERRQR is raised when Mode IN_FHE is not supported for 
tne operation of CREATE for SEQCJENTIAL_IO. (See test 
CE2102D.) 

(4) USE_ERROR is raised when Mode IN_FILE is not supported for 
the operation of CREATE for DIRECr_IO. (See test CE2102I.) 

(5) Modes PJ_FIIE, CXJT_FHE, and INOOT_FIIE are not supported 
for DIRECr_IO. (See tests CE2102F and CE2102J.)

CHAPTER 3 


TEST INFORMATION 


3.1 TEST RESULTS 

Version 1.10 of the ACVC comprises 3717 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, 44 tests had been withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF 
determined that 799 tests were inapplicable to this implementation. All 
inapplicable tests were processed during validation testing except for 
327 executable tests that use floating-point precision exceeding that 
supported by the implementation. Modifications to the code, processing, 
or grading for 38 tests were required to successfully demonstrate the 
test objective. (See section 3.6.) 

The AVF concludes that the testing results demonstrate acceptable 
conformity to the Ada Standard.

3.5 DtAFPLICABLE TESTS 

Same tests do not apply to all compilers because they make use of 
features that a compiler is not required by the Ada Standard, to support. 
Others may depend on the result of another test that is eith 
inapplicable or withdrawn. The applicability of a test to 
implementation is considered each time a validation is attempted, 
test that is inapplicable for one validation attempt is not necessarily 
inapplicable for a subsequent attempt. For this validation attempt, 799 
tests were inapplicable for the reasons indicated: 

a. The following 327 tests are not applicable because they have 
floating-point type declarations requiring more digits than 
SYSTEM.MAX_DIGITS: 

C24113C..Y (23 tests) 

C35706C..Y (23 tests) 

C35708C..Y (23 tests) 


3-2 


C35705C..Y (23 tests) 
C35707C..Y (23 tests) 
C35802C..Z (24 tests) 





b. 


C45241C..Y (23 tests) C45321C..Y (23 tests) 

C45421C..Y (23 tests) C45521C..2 (24 tests) 

C45524C..Z (24 tests) C45621C..Z (24 tests) 

C45641C..Y (23 tests) C46012C..Z (24 tests) 

C35508I, C35508J, C35508M, and C35508N are not applicable because 
they include enumeration representation clauses for BOOLEAN types 
in which the representation values are other than (FALSE => 0, TRUE 
=> l). under the terms of AI-00325, this inplementation is not 
required to support such representation clauses. 

c. C35702A and B86001T are not applicable because this inplementation 
supports no predefined type SHORT__FIOAT. 

d. C35702B and B86001U are not applicable because this implementation 
supports no predefined type LONG_FLOAT. 

e. The following 16 tests are not applicable because this 
implementation does not support a predefined type SHCKT_INIEGER: 

C45231B C45304B C45502B C45503B C45504B 

C45504E C45611B C45613B C45614B C45631B 

C45632B B52004E C55B07B B55B09D B86001V 

CD7101E 

f. C45231D, B86001X, and CD7101G (3 tests) are not applicable because 
this inplementation does not s u pport any predefined integer type 
with a name other than INTEGER or LONG_INTEGER. 

g. C45531M. .P (4 tests), C45532M. .P (4 tests) are not applicable 
because this inplementation does not support a 48 bit integer 
machine size. 

h. D64005F and D64005G compile successfully tut fail to build in the 
LINK because of excessive recursion. 

i. B86001Z is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined floating-point type with a name other than FLOAT. 

j. C86001F is not applicable because, for this implementation, the 

package TEXT_I0 is dependent upon package SYSTEM. This test 

recompiles package SYSTEM, making package TEXT_IO, and hence 

package REPORT, obsolete. 

k. CD1009C, CD2A41A, CD2A41B, CD2A41E, CD2A42A, CD2A42B, CD2A42C, 

CD2A42D, CD2A42E, CD2A42F, CD2A42G, CD2A42H, CD2A42I, CD2A42J (14 

tests) are not applicable because this implementation does not 
support 'SIZE representations for floating-point types. 

l. CD1009N, CD1009X, CD1009Y, CD1009Z, CD1C03H, CD1C04E, CD4031A, 

CD4041A, CD4051A, CD4051B, CD4051C, CD4051D, CD7204C, ED1D04A are 

not applicable because record representation clauses are not

implementation does not support the 'SIZE specification for record 
types implying compression of component storage. 

q. CD2A84B, CD2A84C, CD2A84D, CD2A84E, CD2AS4F, CD2A84G, CD2A84H, 

CD2A84I, CD2A84K, CD2A84L (10 tests) are not applicable because 
'SIZE representation clauses for access types are not supported. 

r. CD2A91A, CD2A91B, QD2A91C, CD2A91D, CD2A91E (5 tests) are not

3.6 TEST, PROCESSING, AND EVALUATION MODIFICATIONS 

It is expected that seme tests will require modifications of code, 
processing, or evaluation in order to compensate for legitimate 
implementation behavior. Modifications are made by the AVF in cases 
where legitimate implementation behavior prevents the successful 
completion of an (otherwise) applicable test. Examples of such 
modifications include: adding a length clause to alter the default size 
of a collection; splitting a Class B test into subtests so that all 
errors are detected; and confirming that messages produced by an 
executable test demonstrate conforming behavior that was not anticipated 
by the test (such as raising one exception instead of another). 

Modifications were required for 38 tests. 

C35A06Q consists of a single procedure which instantiates several 
generic subprograms. In order to test the functionality that this test 
requires, the test was split into two tests. These two tests together 
encompass the same functionality of the original single test. If the 
test were not split, the size of the code generated for this test would 
be too large for the maximum size of a phase in the Ada/M system which 
is 64KBytes. With the test being split, this test reports PASS. 

OC3126A was modified by inserting the initializing expression ":= 
(others => 'H')" into line numbered 117. With this modification, this 
test reports PASS. 

For this implementation CD2C11A and CD2C11B were modified by inserting 
the initialization ":= 5.0" into variable W's declaration (note that W 
is declared along with one or two other variables in a single object 
declaration; the initialization is not needed for them, but does not 
affect their use). With this modification, these tests report PASS. 

The following 34 tests were split because syntax errors at one point 
resulted in the compiler not detecting other errors in the test: 

B28003A B28003C B2A003A B33201C B33202C B33203C B33301B

3.7 ADDITIONAL TESTING INFORMATION 
3.7.1 Prevalidation 

Prior to validation, a set of test results for ACVC Version 1.10 
produced by the Ada/M, Version 2.0 (/NOjOPITMIZE Option) compiler was 
submitted to the AVF by the applicant for review. Analysis of these 
results demonstrated that the compiler successfully passed all 
applicable tests, and the compiler exhibited the expected behavior on 
all inapplicable tests. 


3.7.2 Test Method 


Testing of the Ada/M, Version 2.0 (/NOjOPITMIZE Option) compiler vising 
ACVC Version 1.10 was conducted on-site by a validation team from the 
AVF. The configuration in which the testing was performed is described 
by the following designations of hardware and software components:

RTEXEC Version 2.0/ RTLIB Version 2.0 


The host and target computers were linked via PORTAL/14. 


A magnetic tape containing all tests except for withdrawn tests was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. Tests that make 
use of implementation-specific values were customized before being 
written to the magnetic tape. Tests requiring modifications during the 
prevalidation testing were modified on-site. 


TEST INFORMATION 

The contents of the magnetic tape were loaded directly onto the host 
computers. 

The ACVC Version 1.10 was compiled and linked on the host VAX 8550. All 
executable tests were transferred to the AN/UYK-14 using FORTAI/14 and 
were run on the AN/UYK-14. Results were uploaded from the target system 


3-7 




to the VAX 8550 stored on disk and printed. 


The ACVC Version 1.10 was compiled and linked on the host VAX 11/785. 
All executable tests were transferred to the AN/UYK-14 using PQKEAI/14 
and were run an the AN/UYK-14. Results were uploaded from the target 
system to the VAX 11/785 stored on disk and printed. 

The compiler was tested using command scripts provided by U.S. NAVY and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix E for a complete listing 
of the compiler options for this implementation. The compiler options 
invoked during this test were: 

For A, C, D, L Tests: 

/SUMMARY /NOjOFnMIZE /SOURCE 

For B, E Tests: 

/SUMMARY /NO_OPTIMIZE /SOURCE 

Uhless explicitly stated the following are the default options: 

NOJSOURCE, NOJMACHINE, NO_ATTRIBUTE, NO_CRDSS_REFERENCE, 

NOJD3AGNOSTICS, NO_SUMMARY, NOJKXEES, PRIVATE, OCNTAINERjGENERATrQN, 
GODEjONJWARNING, LEST, NO_MEASURE, DEBUG, NOjDPITMIZE, CHECKS, 
NONEXECUTIVE, NO_KEE_CNLY 

Tests were compiled, linked, and executed as appropriate using a single 
computer. Test output, compilation listings, and job logs were captured 
on magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings were examined 
on-site by the validation team. 


3.7.3 Test Site 

Testing was conducted at Syscon Corporation, Washington, D.C. and was 
completed an 12-01-89.

Section 6 

The Ada Language For The AN/UYR-44 Target 


The source language accepted by the compiler is Ada, as 
described in the Military Standard, Ada Programming Language, 
ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A-1983, 17 February 1983 ("Ada Language 
Reference Manual”). 

The Ada definition permits certain implementation 
dependencies. Each Ada implementation is required to supply a 
complete description of its dependencies, to be thought of as 
Appendix F to the Ada Language Reference Manual. This section is 
that description for the AN/UYK-44 target. 


6.1 Options 

There are several compiler options provided by all ALS/N 
Compilers that directly affect the pragmas defined in the Ada 
Language Reference Manual. These compiler options currently 
include the CHECKS and OPTIMIZE options which affect the SUPPRESS 
and OPTIMIZE pragmas, respectively. A complete list of ALS/N 
Compiler options can be found in Section 10 "Options". 

The CHECKS option enables all run-time error checking for 
the source file being compiled, which can contain one or more 
compilation units. This allows the SUPRESS pragma to be used in 
suppressing the run-time checks discussed in the Ada Language 
Reference Manual, but note that the SUPRESS pragma(s) must be 
applied to each compilation unit. The NO CHECKS option disables 
all run-time error checking for all compilation units within the 
source file and is equivalent to SUPPRESSing all run-time checks 
within every compilation unit. 

The OPTIMIZE option enables all compile-time optimizations 
for the source file being compiled, which can contain one or more 
compilation units. This allows the OPTIMIZE pragma to request 
either TIME-oriented or SPACE-oriented optimizations be 
performed, but note that the OPTIMIZE pragma must be applied to 
each compilation unit. If the OPTIMIZE pragma is not present, 
the ALS/N Compiler's Global Optimizer tends to optimize for TIME 
over SPACE. The NO OPTIMIZE option disables all compile-time 
optimizations for all compilation units within the source file 
regardless of whether or not the OPTIMIZE pragma is present. 

In addition to those Compiler options normally provided by 
the ALS/N Common Ada Baseline Compilers, the Ada/M Compilers also 
implement the EXECUTIVE, DEBUG, and MEASURE options. 

The EXECUTIVE Compiler option shall enable processing of the

EXECUTIVE pragma. The EXECUTIVE compiler option also allows WITH 
of units compiled with the /RTE__ONLE option. IF NONEXECUTIVE is 
specified on the command line# the pragma will be ignored and 
will have no effect on the generated code. 

The DEBUG Compiler option shall enable processing of the 
pragma DEBUG to provide debugging support. If NO_DEBUG is 
specified# the DEBUG pragmas shall have no effect? Program units 
containing DEBUG pragmas and compiled with the DEBUG Compiler 
option may be linked with program units containing DEBUG pragmas 
and compiled with the NO_DEBUG option; only those program units 
compiled with the DEBUG option shall have additional DEBUG 
support. 

The MEASURE Compiler option shall enable processing of the 
pragma MEASURE to provide debugging support. If NO_MEASURE is 
specified, the MEASURE pragmas shall have no effect? Program 
units containing MEASURE pragmas and compiled with the MEASURE 
Compiler option may be linked with program units containing 
MEASURE pragmas and compiled with the NO_MEASURE option; only 
those program units compiled with the MEASURE option shall have 
additional MEASURE support.

6.2 Pragmas 

These paragraphs describe the pragmas recognized and 
processed by the Ada/M Compiler. The syntax defined in Section 
2.8 of the Ada Language Reference Manual allows pragmas as the 
only element in a compilation, before a compilation unit, at 
defined places within a compilation unit, or following a 
compilation unit. Ada/M associates pragmas with compilation 
units as follows: 

a. If a pragma appears before any compilation unit in a 
compilation, it will affect all following compilation 
units, as specified below and in Section 2.8 of the 
Ada Language Reference Manual 

b. If a pragma appears inside a compilation unit, it 
will be associated with that compilation unit, and 
with the listings associated with that compilation 
unit, as described in the Ada Language Reference 
Manual, or below. 

c. If a pragma follows a compilation unit, it will be 
associated with the preceding compilation unit, and 
the effects of the pragma will be found in the 
container of that compilation unit and in listings 
associated with that container. 


6.2.1 Language-Defined Pragmas 

This paragraph specifies implementation-specific changes to 
those pragmas described in Appendix B of the Ada Language 
Reference Manual. Unmentioned pragmas are implemented as defined 
in the Ada Language Reference Manual. 

The pragmas MEMORY_SIZE (arg), STORAGEJJNIT (arg), and 
SYSTEM_NAME (arg) must appear at the start of the first 
compilation when creating a program library, as opposed to the 
start of any compilation unit. If they appear elsewhere, a 
diagnostic of severity WARNING is generated and the pragma has no 
effect. 

pragma INLINE (arg {,arg,...}); 

The arguments designate subprograms. There are three I 
instances in which the INLINE pragma is ignored. Each 
of these cases produces a warning message which states 
that in INLINE did not occur. 

a. If a call to an INLINEd subprogram is 
compiled before the actual body of the 
subprogram has been compiled (a routine 
call is made instead). 


6.2.1 Language-Defined Pragmas 


6-03 








Version 2.0C 
30 September 1989 


Ada/M PSE Handbook 


| b. If the INLINEd subprograms compilation unit 

j depends on the compilation unit of its 

| caller (a routine call is made instead). 

I c. If an immediately recursive subprogram call 

I is made within the body of the INLINEd 

i subprogram (the pragma INLINE is ignored 

j entirely). 

pragma INTERFACE (arg, arg); 

The first argument specifies the language and type of 
interface to be used in calls used to the externally 
supplied subprogram specified by the second argument. 
The only value allowed for the first argument (language 
name) is MACRO NORMAL. MACRO_NORMAL indicates that 
parameters will be passed on the stack and the calling 
conventions used for normal Ada subprogram calls (see 
Section 3.4.14.2 of Ada/M_Intf_Spec) will apply. 

The user must ensure that an Assembly Language Body 
Container will exist in the program library before 
linking. 

pragma OPTIMIZE (arg); 

This pragma is effective only when the "OPTIMIZE" 
option has been given to the compiler. The argument is 
either TIME or SPACE. If TIME is specified, the 
optimizer concentrates on optimizing code execution 
time. If SPACE is specified, the optimizer 
concentrates on optimizing code size. 

pragma PRIORITY (arg); 

The argument is an integer static expression in the 
( range Q..15, where 0 is the lowest user-specifiable 
j task priority and IS is the highest. If the value of 
the argument is out of range, the pragma will have no 
effect other than to generate a WARNING diagnostic. A 
value of zero will be used if priority is not defined. 
The pragma will have no effect when not specified in a 
task (type) specification or the outermost declarative 
part of a subprogram. If the pragma appears in the 
declarative part of a subprogram, it will have no 
effect unless that subprogram is designated as the main 
subprogram at link time. 

pragma SUPPRESS (arg {,arg}); 

This pragma is unchanged with the following exceptions: 

I Suppression of OVERFLOW_CHECK applies only to integer 


6-04 


6.2.1 Language-Defined Pragmas 










Ada/M PSE Handbook 


Version 2.0C

operations; and a SUPPRESS pragma has effect only 
within the compilation unit in which it appears, except 
that suppression of ELABORATION_CHECK applied at the 
declaration of a subprogram or task unit applies to all 
calls or activations. 


6.2.2 Implementation-Defined Pragmas 

This paragraph describes the use and meaning of those 
pragmas recognised by Ada/M which are not specified in Appendix a 
of the Ada Language Reference Manual. 

pragma DEBUG; | 

To be supplied. ! 

pragma EXECUTIVE C(arg)3 ? I 

This pragma allows the user to specify that a 
compilation unit is to run in the executive state of 
the machine and/or utilize privileged instructions. 

The pragma has no effect if the Compiler option 
NO EXECUTIVE is enabled, either explicitly or by 
default. 

If PRAGMA EXECUTIVE is specified without an argument, 
executive state is in effect for the compilation unit 
and the code generator does not generate privileged 
instructions for the compilation unit. If PRAGMA 
EXECUTIVE (INHERIT) is specified, a subprogram in the 
compilation unit inherits the state of its caller and 
the code generator does not generate privileged 
instructions for the compilation unit. If PRAGMA 
EXECUTIVE (PRIVILEGED) is specified, the executive 
state is in effect and the code generator may generate 
privileged instructions for the compilation unit. In 
the absence of PRAGMA EXECUTIVE, the compilation unit 
executes in task state and the code generator does not 
generate privileged instructions. 

PRAGMA EXECUTIVE is applied once per compilation unit, 
so its scope is the entire compilation unit. PRAGMA 
EXECUTIVE may appear between the context clause and the 
outermost unit. If there is no context clause, the 
pragma EXECUTIVE must appear within that unit before 
the first declaration or statement. The placement of 
the pragma before the context clause has no effect on 
any or all following compilatin units. If PRAGMA 
EXECUTIVE appears in the specification of a compilation 
unit, it must also appear in the body of that unit, and 
vice versa. If the pragma appears in a specification 
but is absent from the body, the user is warned and the

pragma is effective. If the pragma, appears in the body 
of a compilation unit, but is absent from the 
corresponding specification, the user is warned and the 
pragma has no effect. PRAGMA EXECUTIVE does not 
propagate to subunits. If a subunit is compiled 
without PRAGMA EXECUTIVE and the parent of the subunit 
is compiled with PRAGMA EXECUTIVE, the user is warned 
and PRAGMA EXECUTIVE has no effect on the subunit. 

pragma FAST_INTERRUPT_ENTR¥ (argl, arg2); 

! To be supplied. 

pragma MEASURE (extraction_set, [arg,...]); 

I To be supplied. 

prigma STATIC (arg); 

I To be supplied. 

pragma TICK (arg); 

This is a system configuration pragma. It takes a 
single argument of type universal_real, which specifies 
the value of the named number system.tick. This pragma 
may appear only at the start of the first compilation 
when creating a program library. If this pragma 
appears elsewhere, a diagnostic of severity WARNING is 
generated. 

pragma TITLE (arg); 

This is a listing control pragma. It takes a single 
argument of type string. The string specified will 
appear on the second line of each page of every listing 
produced for a compilation unit. At most one such 
pragma may appear for any compilation unit, and it must 
be the first lexical unit in the compilation unit 
(excluding comments). 

pragma TRIVIAL_ENTR¥ (NAME: entry_simple_name); 

I To be supplied. 

pragma UNMAPPED (arg, [arg,...]); 

The effect of this pragma is for unmapped (i.e., not 
consistently mapped within the virtual space) 
allocation of data in a compilation unit. The 
arguments of this pragma are access types to be 
unmapped. If a program tries to allocate more UNMAPPED 
space than is available in the physical configuration,

then STORAGE_ERROR will be raised at run-time. Pragma ! 
UNMAPPED must appear in the same declarative region as | 
the type and after the type declaration. j 


6.2.3 Scope of Pragmas 

The scope for each pragma previously described as differing 

from the Ada Language Reference Manual is given below. 

DEBUG To be supplied. 

EXECUTIVE Applies to the compilation unit in which the pragma 
appears, i.e., to all subprograms and tasks within 
the unit. Elaboration code is not affected. The 
pragma is not propagated from specifications to 
bodies, or from bodies to subunits. The pragma 
must appear consistently in the specification, 
body, and subunits associated with a library unit. 

FAST_INTERRUPT_ENTRY 

To be supplied. 

INLINE Applies only to subprograms named in its 

arguments. If the argument is an overloaded 
subprogram name, the INLINE pragma applies to 
all definitions of that subprogram name which 
appear in the same declarative part as the 
INLINE pragma. 

INTERFACE Applies to all invocations of the named 
imported subprogram. 

MEASURE To be supplied. I 

M£MORY_SIZE Applies to the entire Program Library in j 

“ which the pragma appears. I 

OPTIMIZE Applies to the entire compilation unit in 

which the pragma appears. 

PRIORITY Applies to the task specification in which it 

appears, or to the environment task if it 
appears in the main subprogram. 

STATIC To be supplied. I 

STORAGE__UNIT Applies to the entire Program Library in 
which the pragma appears. 

SUPPRESS Applies to the block or body that contains 

the declarative part in which the pragma 
appears.

6.3 Attributes 

There are two implementation-defined attributes in addition 
to the predefined attributes found in Appendix A of the Ada 
Language Reference Manual. These are defined below. 

p'PHYSICAL_ADDRESS for a prefix p that denotes a data 
objects ~ 

Yields a value of type system.physical_address, which corresponds 
to the absolute address in physical memory of the object named by 
p. This attribute is only defined for static package 
specification and body data. 

p'OISP for a prefix p that denotes a data object: 

Yields a value of type universal_integer, which corresponds to 
the offset of p from the beginning of the frame containing p. 

For example, if p names a parameter, p'OISP is the offset of p 
from the argument pointer on the stack (see Section 3.4.14 of 
Ada/M Intf^Spec). This attribute differs from the ADDRESS 
attribute Tn that ADDRESS supplies the virtual absolute address 
whereas DISP supplies a displacement. It is the user's 
responsibility to determine the base value, (i.e., frame pointer, 
argument pointer, psect), relevant to the object p. The runtime 
environment is described in Section 3.4.14 of Ada/M Intf Spec. 

The following notes augment the language-required 
definitions of the predefined attributes found in Appendix A of 
the Ada Language Reference Manual. 

T'MACHINE_EMAX is 63. 

T'MACHINE_EMIN is -64. 

T a MACHINEJ1ANTISSA is 6. 

T'MACHINE_OVERFLOWS Is TRUE. 

T* MACHINE JIADIX is 16. 

T'MACHINE ROUNDS is FALSE.

6.6 Representation and Declaration Restrictions 

Representation specifications are described in Section 13 of 
the Ada Language Reference Manual. Declarations are described in 
Section 3 of the Ada Language Reference Manual. 

In the following specifications, the capitalized word SIZE 
indicates the number of bits used to represent an object of the 
type under discussion. The upper case symbols D, L, R, 
correspond to those discussed in Section 3.5.9 of the Ada 
Language Reference Manual. 


6.6.1 Integer Types 

Integer types are specified with constraints of the form: 
RANGE L..R 

where: 

R <= SYSTEM.MAX_INT & L >= SYSTEM.MIN_INT 

For a prefix "t" denoting an integer type, length specifications 
of the form: 

FOR t 1 SIZE USE n ; 

may specify integer values n such that 
n in 2..16, 
and such that 

R <- 2**(n-l)-l & L >- -(2**(n-1)) 
or else such that 

R <- (2**n)-l 6 L >* 0 
and 1 < n <* 15. 

I For a standalone object of integer type, a default SIZE of 16 is 
j used when: 

| R <* 2**15-1 and L >» -2**15 

I Otherwise, a SIZE of 32 is used. 

| For components of integer types within packed composite 

I objects, the smaller of the default standalone SIZE and the SIZE 
| from a length specification is used. 


6-14 


6.6.1 Integer Types 





Ada/M PSE Handbook 


Version 2.0C

6.6.2 Floating Types 

Floating types are specified with constraints of the form: 
DIGITS D 

where D is an integer in the range 1 through 6. | 

For a prefix "t" denoting a floating point type, length I 

specifications of the form: j 

FOR t 1 SIZE USE n; 

may specify integer values n 3 32 when D <* 6. All floating point 
values 

have SIZE 3 32. 


6.6.3 Fixed Types 

Fixed types are specified with constraints of the form: 

DELTA D RANGE L..R 

where: 

MAX (ABS(R), ABS(L)) 

- <* 2**31-1. 

actual delta 

The actual delta defaults to the largest integral power of 2 less 
than 

or equal to the specified delta D. (This implies that fixed 
values are 

stored right-aligned.) For specifications of the form: 

FOR t'SMALL USE n; 

n must be specified as an integral power of 2 such that n < 3 D. 

For a prefix N t N denoting a fixed point type, length 

specifications of the 

form: 

FOR t'SIZE USE n; 

are permitted only when n * 32. All fixed values have SIZE 3 32. 


6.6.4 Enumeration Types 

In the absence of a representation specification for an ! 

enumeration type ”t, N the internal representation of t'FIRST 3 0. | 


6.6.4 Enumeration Types 


6-15 




Version 2.0C 
30 September 1989 


Ada/M PSE Handbook 


j The default size for a standalone object of enumeration type "t" 
j is 16, so the internal representations of t'FIRST and t'LAST both 
I fall within the range 

-2**15 .. 2**15 - 1. 

I For enumeration types, length specifications of the form: 

FOR t'SIZE USE n; 

and/or enumeration representations of the form: 

I FOR t OSE <aggregate>? 

I are permitted for n in 2..16/ provided that the representations 
I and the SIZE conform to the relationship specified above/ or else 
I for n in 1..16/ is supported for enumeration types and provides 
I an internal representation of: 

| t'FIRST >* 0 .. t'LAST <= 2**(t 1 SIZE) - 1. 


For components of enumeration types within packed composite 
objects/ the smaller of the default standalone SIZE and the SIZE 
from a length specification is used. 

Enumeration representations on types derived from the 
predefined type standard.boolean will not be accepted, but length 
specifications will be accepted. 


6.6.5 Access Types 

| For access type, "t", length specifications of the form: 

| FOR t'SIZE USE n; 

I will not affect the runtime implementation of "t", therefore n*16 
j is the only value permitted for SIZE, which is the value returned 
| by the attribute. 

I For collection size specification of the form: 

| FOR t 1 STORAGE_SIZE OSE n? 

for any value of "n" is permitted for STORAGE_SIZE (and that 
value will be returned by the attribute call)7 The collection 
size specification will affect the implementation of "t" and its 
collection at runtime by limiting the number of objects for type 
N t N that can be allocated. 

The value of t'STORAGE_SIZE for an access type ”t N specifies 
the maximum number of storage units used for all objects in the 


6-16 


6.6.5 Access Types 







Ada/M PSE Handbook 


Version 2.0C 
30 September 1989 


collection for type "t." This includes all space used by the 
allocated objects, plus any additional storage required to 
maintain the collection. 


6.6.6 Arrays and Records 

For arrays and records, length specification of the form: 

FOR t'size USE n; 

is not allowed unless it is the default size. 

The PACK pragma may be used to minimize wasted space between 
components of arrays and records. The pragma causes the type 
representation to be chosen such that the storage space 
requirements are minimized at the possible expense of data access 
time and code space. 

A record type representation specification is not allowed. 
For records, an alignment clause of the form: 

AT MOD n 

specify alignments of 1 word (word alignment) or 2 words 
(doubleword alignment). > 

If it is determinable at compile time that the SIZE of a 
record or array type or subtype is outside the range of 
standard.long_integer, a diagnostic of severity WARNING is 
generated. Declaration of such a type or subtype would raise 
NUMERIC ERROR when elaborated. 


6.6.7 Other Length Specifications 

Length Specifications are described in Section 13.2 of the 
Ada Language Reference Manual. 

A length specification for a task type "t" of the form: 

For t'STORAGE_SIZE USE n; 

specifies the number of system.storage_untis that are allocated 
for the execution each task object of type "t". This includes 
the runtime stack for the task object but does not include 
objects allocated at runtime by the task object.

6.8 Address Clauses 

Refer to Section 13.5 of the Ada Language Reference Manual 
for a description of address clauses. All rules and restrictions 
described there apply. In addition, the following restrictions 
apply. 


An address clause designates a single task entry only. The 
appearance of a data object, subprogram, package, or task unit 
name in an address clause is not allowed, and will result in the 
generation of a diagnostic of severity ERROR. 

An address clause may designate a single task entry. Such 
an address clause is allowed only within a task specification 
compiled with the EXECUTIVE Compiler option. The meaningful 
values of the simple_expression are the allowable interrupt entry 
addresses defined in~Table 6-1. The use of other values will 
result in the raising of a PROGRAM_ERROR exception upon creation 
of the task. ” 

If more than one task entry is equated to the same interrupt 
entry address, the most recently executed interrupt entry 
registration permanently overrides any previous registrations. 

At most one address clause is allowed for a single task 
entry. Specification of more than one interrupt address for a 
task entry is erroneous.

I Refer to Section 10.1 (8) of the Ada Language Reference 

I Manual for a description of the main subprogram. The subprogram 
designated as the main subprogram cannot have parameters. The 
designation as the main subprogram of a subprogram whose 
specification contains a formal_part results in a diagnostic of 
severity ERROR at link time. 

The main subprogram can be a function, but the return value 
will not be available upon completion of the main subprogram's 
execution. The main subprogram may not be an import unit.

6.11.1 Naming External Files 

The naming conventions for external files in Ada/M are of 
particular importance to the user. All of the system-dependent 
information needed by the I/O subsystem about an external file is 
contained in the file name. External files may be named using 
one of three file naming conventions: standard, temporary, and 
user-derived. 

a. Standard File Names: 

The standard external file naming convention used in 
Ada/M identifies the specific location of the external 
file in terms of the physical device on which it is 
stored. For this reason, the user should be aware of the 
configuration of the peripheral devices on the AN/UYK-44 
at a particular user site. 

Standard file names may be six to twenty characters 
long; however, the first six characters follow a 
predefined format. The first and second characters must 
be either "CT," "MT," or "TT," designating an AN/USH-26 
Signal Data Recorder/Reproducer Set, the RD-358 Magnetic 
Tape Subsystem, or the AN/USQ-69 Data Terminal Set, 
respectively. These characters must be in upper case. 

The third and fourth characters specify the channel 
on which the peripheral device is connected. Since there 
are sixty-four channels on the AN/UYK-44, the values for 
the third and fourth positions must lie in the range "00" 
to "63." 

The range of values for the fifth position in the 
external file name (the unit number) depends upon the 
device specified by the characters in the first and 
second positions of the external file name. If the 
specified peripheral device is the AN/USH-26 magnetic 
tape drive, then the character in the fifth position must 
be one of the characters "0," "1," "2," or "3." This 
value determines which of the four tape cartridge units 
available on the AN/USH-26 is to be accessed. If the 
specified peripheral device is the RD-358 magnetic tape 
drive, the character in the fifth position must be one of 
the characters "0," "1," "2," or "3." This value 
determines which of the four tape units available on the 


6.11.1 Naming External Files 


6-23 






Version 2.0C 
30 September 1989 


Ada/M PSE Handbook 


RO-3S8 is to be accessed. If the specified peripheral 
device is the AN/USQ-69 militarized display terminal, the 
character in the fifth position must be a "0." The 
AN/USQ-69 has only one unit on a channel. 

The colon, is the only character allowed in the 

sixth position. If any character other than the colon is 
in this position, the file name will be considered 
non-standard and the file will reside on the default 
device defined during the elaboration of CONFIGURE_IO. 

Positions seven through twenty are optional to the 
user written Ada program and may be used as desired. 

These positions may contain any printable character the 
user chooses in order to make the file name more 
intelligible. Embedded blanks, however, are not allowed. 

The location of an external file on a peripheral 
device is thus a function of the first six characters of 
the file name regardless of the characters that might 
follow. For example, if the external file 
"CT000:Old_Data" has been created and not subsequently 
closed, an attempt to create the external file 
"CT000:New_Data" will cause the exception DEVICE_ERROR 
(rather than NAME_ERROR or USE_ERROR) to be raised 
because the peripheral device on channel "00" and 
cartridge "0" is already in use. ' 

The user is advised that any file name beginning 
with "xxxxx:" (where x denotes any printable character) 
is assumed to be a standard external file name. If this 
external file name does not conform to the Ada/M standard 
file naming conventions, the exception NAME_ERROR will be 
raised. 

b. Temporary File Names: 

Section 14.2.1 of the Ada Language Reference Manual 
defines a temporary file to be an external file that is 
not accessible after completion of the main subprogram. 

If the null string is supplied for the external file 
name, the external file is considered temporary. In this 
case, the high level I/O packages internally create an 
external file name to be used by the lower level I/O 
packages. The internal naming scheme used by the I/O 
subsystem is a function of the type of file to be created 
(text, direct or sequential), the temporary nature of the 
external file, and the number of requests made thus far 
for creating temporary external files of the given type. 
This scheme is consistent with the requirement specified 
in the Ada Language Reference Manaul that all external 
file names be unique. 


6-24 


6.11.1 Naming External Files 






Ada/M PSE Handbook 


Version 2.0C 
30 September 1989 


The first three characters of the file name are 
“TEX," "DIR," or "SEQ." The next six characters are 
"__TEMP_." The remaining characters are the image of an 
intege? which denotes the number of temporary files of 
the given type successfully created. There are two types 
of temporary files; one is used by SEQUENTIAL_IO and 
DIRECT_IO, and the other is used by TEXT_IQ. “For 
instance, the temporary external file name "TEX_TEMP_10" 
would be the name of the tenth temporary external file 
successfully created by the user written Ada program 
through calls to TEXT_IO. 

c. User-Derived File Names: 

A random string containing a sequence of characters 
of length one to twenty may also be used to name an 
external file. External files with names of this nature 
are considered to be permanent external files. The user 
is cautioned to refrain from using names which conform to 
the scheme used by the I/O subsystem to name temporary 
external files (see list item ”b."). 

It is not possible to associate two or more internal files 
with the same external file. The exception USE_ERROR will be 
raised if this restriction is violated. 


6.11.2 The FORM Specification for External Files 

Section 14.2.1 of the Ada Language Reference Manual defines 
a string argument called the FORM, which supplies 
system-dependent information that is sometimes required to 
correctly process a request to create or open a file. In Ada/M, 
the string argument supplied to the FORM parameter on calls to 
CREATE and OPEN is retained while the file is open, so that calls 
to the function FORM can return the string to the user written 
Ada program. Form options specified on calls to CREATE have the 
effects stated below. Form options specified on calls to OPEN 
have no effect. 

The REWIND and APPEND options are mutually exclusive; an 
attempt to specify both options on a call to CREATE will raise 
the exception USE_ERROR. 

The NOHEAD option may be specified in combination with 
either the REWIND or the APPEND option. 

If one form option is specified, the FORM string should 
contain only the option, without any extraneous characters. If 
two form options are specified, the FORM string should contain 
the first form option followed by a comma followed by the second 
form option. The form options may be specified in any 


6.11.2 


6-25 






Version 2.0C 
30 September 1989 


Ada/M PSE Handbook 


combination of upper and lower case. 

If the supplied FORM string is longer than the maximum 
allowed FORM string (13 characters), CREATE and OPEN will raise 
the exception (JSE_ERROR. 

If the procedure CREATE does not recognize the options 
specified in the FORM string, it raises the exception CJSE_ERROR. 
The procedure OPEN does not validate the contents of the supplied 
FORM string. 

Positioning arguments allow control of tape before its use. 
The following positioning arguments are available to the user: 

a. REWIND - specifies that a rewind will be performed 
prior to the requested operation. 

b. NOREWIND - specifies that the tape remains positioned 
as is. 

c. APPEND - specifies that the tape be positioned at the 
logical end of tape (LEOT) prior to the requested 
operation. The LEOT is denoted by two consecutive 
tape_marks. 

The formatting argument specifies information about tape 
format. If a formatting argument is not supplied, the file is 
assumed to contain a format header record determined by the ALS/N 
I/O system. The following formatting argument is available to 
the user: 

a. NOHEAD - specifies that the designated file has no 
header record. This argument allows the reading and 
writing of tapes used on computer systems using 
different header formats. Note that files created 
with the NOHEAD option cannot be opened by the Ada/M 
I/O subsystem. 


6.11.3 File Processing 

Processing allowed on Ada/M files is influenced by the 
characteristics of the underlying device. The following 
restrictions apply: 

a. Only one file may be open on an individual AN/USH-26 
tape cartridge at a time. 

b. Only one input and one output file may simultaneously 
be open on an AN/OSQ-69 terminal at one time. 


6-26 


6.11.3 File Processing 








Ada/M PSE Handbook 


Version 2.0C 
30 September 1989 


c. A user-written Ada program is erroneous if it does 
not close or delete all files that it creates or 
opens. 

d. 

The attempt to CREATE a file with the mode IN_FILE is 
not supported since there will be no data in the file 
to read. 


6.11.4 Text Input/Output 

TEXT_IO is invoked by the user-written Ada program to 
perform sequential access I/O operations on text files (i.e, 
files whose content is in human-readable form). TEXT_IO is not a 
generic package and, thus, its subprograms may be invoked 
directly from the user-written Ada program, using objects with 
base type or parent type in the language-defined type character. 
TEXT_IO also provides the generic packages INTEGER_IO, FLOAT_IO, 
FIXED^IO, and ENUM£RATI0N_I0 for the reading and writing of 
numeric values and enumeration values. The generic packages 
within TEXT_IO require an instantiation for a given element type 
before any of their subprograms are invoked. The specification 
of this package is given in Section 14.3.10 of the Ada Language 
Reference Manual. 

% 

The implementation-defined type COUNT that appears in 
Section 14.3.10 of the Ada Language Reference Manual is defined 
as follows: 

type COUNT is range 0... INTEGER'LAST? 

The implementation-defined subtype FIELD that appears in Section 
14.3.10 of the Ada Language Reference Manual is defined as 
follows: 


subtype FIELD is INTEGER range 0...INTEGER•LAST; 

At the beginning of program execution, the STANDARD_INPUT 
file and the STANDARD_OUTPUT file are open, and associated with 
the files specified by the user at export time. Additionally, if 
a program terminates before an open file is closed (except for 
STANDARD_INPUT and STANDARD OUTPUT), then the last line which the 
user added to the file may He lost; if the file is on magnetic 
tape, the file structure on the tape may be inconsistent. 

A program is erroneous if concurrently executing tasks 
attempt to perform overlapping GET and/or PUT operations on the 
same terminal. The semantics of text layout as specified in the 
Ada Language Reference Manual, Section 14.3.2, (especially the 
concepts of current column number and current line) cannot be 
guaranteed when GET operations are interweaved with PUT - 


6.11.4 Text Input/Output 


6-27 




Version 2.0C 
30 September 1989 


Ada/M PSE Handbook 


operations. A program which relies on the semantics of text 
layout under those circumstances is erroneous. 

For TEXT_IO processing, the line length can be no longer 
I than 1000 chaFacters. An attempt to set the line length through 
I SET_LIN£ LENGTH to a length greater than 1000 will result in 
OSE ERROR. 


6.11.5 Sequential Input/Output 

SEQUENTIAL_IO is invoked by the user-written Ada program to 
perform I/O on the records of a file in sequential order. The 
SEQUENTIAL_IO package also requires a generic instantiation for a 
given element type before any of its subprograms may be invoked. 
Once the package SEQUENTIAL_IO is made visible, it will perform 
any service defined by the subprograms declared in its 
specification. The specification of this package is given in 
Section 14.2.3 of the Ada Language Reference Manual. 

The following restrictions are imposed on the use of the 
package SEQUENTIAL_IO: 

a. SEQUENTIAL_IO must be instantiated for a constrained 
type. 

b. Ada/M does not raise DATA_ERROR on a read operation 
if the data input from the external file is not of 
the instantiating type (see the Ada Language 
Reference Manual, Section 14.2.2). 


6.11.6 Direct Input/Output 

Calls to the subprograms of an instantiation of DIRECT_IO 
have one of three possible outcomes. The exception USE ERROR is 
raised if an attempt is made to CREATE and/or OPEN a file since 
direct access I/O operations are not supported in Ada/M. The 
exception STATUS_ERROR is raised on calls to subprograms other 
than CREATE, OPEN, and IS_OPEN. The function IS_OPEN always 
returns the value FALSE. ~ 

I The implementation-defined type COUNT that appears in 

I Section 14.2.5 of the Ada Language Reference. Manual is defined as 
I follows: 


I type COUNT is range 0..io_support.count'LAST; 

| where io_support.count'LAST is equal to LONG_INTEGER'LAST.

6.11.7 Low Level Input/Output 








Ada/M PSE Handbook 


Version 2.0C 
30 September 1989 


LOW_LEVEL_IG is invoked by the user-written Ada program to 
initiate”physical operations on peripheral devices, and thus 
executes as part of the user-written Ada program task. Requests 
made to LOW_LEVEL_IO from the user-written Ada program are passed 
through the~RTEXECj3ATEWAY to the channel programs in CHANNEL_IO. 
Any status check or result information is the responsibility of 
the invoking subprogram and can be obtained from the subDrogram 
RECEIVEJZONTROL within LOW_LEVEL_IO. 

The package LOW_LEVEL_IO allows the user written Ada program 
to send I/O cornmands^to the I/O devices (using SEND_CONTROL) and 
to receive status information from the I/O devices (using 
RECEIVEJZONTROL). A program is erroneous if it uses LOW L£VEL_IO 
to access a device that is also accessed by high-level l7o 
packages such as SEQUENTIAL_IO and TEXT_IO. The following is 
excerpted from the package L0W_LEVEL_I07

6.13 Machine Code Insertions 

The Ada language permits machine code insertions as defined 
in Section 13.8 of the Ada Language Reference Manual. This 
section describes the specific details for writing machine code 
insertions as provided by the predefined package MACHINE_CQDE. 

The Ada/M user may, if desired, include AN/UYR-44 
instructions within an Ada program. This is done by including a 
procedure in the program which contains only record aggregates 
defining machine instructions. The package MACHINE_CODE, 
included in the system program library, contains type, record, 
and constant declarations which are used to form the 
instructions. Each field of the aggregate contains a field of 
the resulting machine instruction. These fields are specified in 
the order in which they appear in the actual instruction. 

A procedure containing machine-code insertions looks similar 
to this: 

with machine_code; use machine_code; 
procedure machine_samples is 
begin 

instr'(OPCODE,A,M,Y); -- first instruction 
instr'(OPCODE,A,M,Y); — second instruction 
• • • 

instr'(OPCODE,A,M,Y); — last instruction 
end; 

OPCODE, A, M, and Y in all these examples are replaced by the 
actual opcode, A register, M register, and Y field desired for 
each AN/UYK-44 instruction. Whenever possible, MACRO/M mnemonics 
are used to specify the opcode field. The A and M register 
fields are specified as R0, Rl, ... R15. The Y field may be 

specified by any static expression which will fit in a 16-bit 
integer. For certain instructions such as unary arithmetic 
operations, the opcode and either the A or M register determine 
which instruction is executed. The specification of these 
instructions and certain others is somewhat more complicated and 
is explained in detail below. Here are some examples of possible 
MACRO/M instructions and the Ada/M record aggregates that 
correspond to them: 

MACRO/M Ada/M 


spt A,Y,M 
lr A,M 
1 A,Y,M 
mi A,M 
ork A,Y,M 


instr'(spt,A,M,Y); 
instr'(lr,A,M); 
instr'(1,A,M,Y); 
instr'(mi,A,M); 
instr'(ork,A,M,Y);

Ada/M PSE Handbook 


Version 2.0C 
30 Sepcember 1989 


In some cases, A or M register fields do not appear in the 
MACHO/M instruction because the field is always zero in the 
machine instruction. R0 must be used in that field of the record 
aggregate in Ada/M, however, since no missing fields are allowed. 
Here are some examples where that occurs: 

MACRO/M Ada/M 


lpi M instr*(Ipi,rO,M); 

lp Y,M instr'(lp,rO,M,Y); 

sfsc M instr'(sfsc,rO,M); 


Some MACRO/M mnemonics are ambiguous and are assembled into 
one of two or more opcodes based on the operands specified in the 
instruction. Ada/M opcode mnemonics must be unambiguous, so 
either the letter K (indicating an RK format instruction) or the 
letter X (indicating an RX format instruction) has been added to 
the end of otherwise ambiguous mnemonics. Some examples of this 
are as follows: 

MACRO/M Ada/M 


jz A,Y,M instr'(jzk,A,M,Y); 

jp A,*Y,M instr’(jpx,A,M,Y); 


For those MACRO/M mnemonics which determine both the opcode 
and either the A or M register, the MACRO/M mnemonic 
(disambiguated as above if necessary) is used for the A or M 
field and an opcode mnemonic is invented. Some examples of this 
are as follows: 

MACRO/M Ada/M 


pr A 
drtr A 
sqr A 
jne Y,M 
her 


instr*(ua_opcode,A,pr); 
instr*(ua_opcode,A,drtr); 
instr'(us_opcode,A,sqr); 
instr*(cjk_opcode,jnek,M,Y); 
instr’(ec_opcode,hcr,rO);

Ada/M PSE Handbook 


The Ada/M user must be able to include data as well as 
instructions in machine code. The MACHINE_CODE package defines 
record types which allow the user to create indirect words, 
signed bytes, unsigned bytes, words, double words, and floating 
point numbers. The format for including data is as follows: 

Data Ada/M 


indirect word (iw J,Y,X) indirect_word’(J,X,Y); 

unsigned byte (0 .. 255) unsigned~byte_value'(VALUE); 

word (16-bit value) word_value'(VALUE); 

double word (32-bit value) doubre_word_value'(VALUE); 
float value (32-bit value) float_value'(VALUE); 


Table 6-3 contains a list of MACRO/M instructions and their 
Ada/M machine code equivalents, sorted by MACRO/M mnemonic.

TEST PARAMETERS 


Certain tests in the ACVC make use of implementation-dependent values, 
such as the maximum length of an input line and invalid file names. A 
test that makes use of such values is identified by the extension .TST 
in its file name. Actual values to be substituted are represented by 
names that begin with a dollar sign. A value must be substituted for 
each of these names before the test is run. The values used for this 
validation are given below.

APPENDIX D 


WITHDRAWN TESTS 


Some tests are withdrawn from the ACVC because they do not conform to 
the Ada Standard. The following 44 tests had been withdrawn at the time 
of validation testing for the reasons indicated. A reference of the 
form Al-ddddd is to an Ada Commentary. 

A39005G 

This test unreasonably expects a component clause to pack an array 
component into a minimum size (line 30). 

B97102E 

This test contains an unintended illegality: a select statement 
contains a null statement at the place of a selective wait alternative 
(line 31). 

C97116A 

This test contains race conditions, and it assumes that guards are 
evaluated indivisibly. A conforming implementation may use interleaved 
execution in such a way that the evaluation of the guards at lines 50 & 
54 and the execution of task CHANGING_OF_THE_GUARD results in a call to 
REPORT.FAILED at one of lines 52 or 56. 

BC3009B 

This test wrongly expects that circular instantiations will be detected 
in several compilation units even though none of the units is illegal 
with respect to the units it depends on; by AI-00256, the illegality 
need not be detected until execution is attempted (line 95). 

CD2A62D 

This test wrongly requires that an array object's size be no greater 
than 10 although its subtype's size was specified to be 40 (line 137). 

CD2A63A..D, CD2A66A..D, CD2A73A..D, CD2A76A..D [16 tests] 

These tests wrongly attempt to check the size of objects of a derived 
type (for which a 'SIZE length clause is given) by passing them to a 
derived subprogram (which implicitly converts them to the parent type 
(Ada standard 3.4:14)). Additionally, they use the 'SIZE length clause 
and attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic by the WG9 
ARG. 

CD2A81G, CD2A83G, CD2A84M & N, & CD50110 

These tests assume that dependent tasks will terminate while the main 
program executes a loop that simply tests for task termination; this is 
not the case, and the main program may loop indefinitely (lines 74, 85, 
86 & 96, 86 & 96, and 58, resp.). 


D-l 







CD2B15C & CD7205C 

These tests expect that a 'STORAGE_SIZE length clause provides precise 
control over the number of designated objects in a collection; the Ada 
standard 13.2:15 allows that such control must not be expected. 

CD2D11B 

This test gives a SMALL representation clause for a derived fixed-point 
type (at line 30) that defines a set of model numbers that are not 
necessarily represented in the parent type; by Commentary AI-00099, all 
model numbers of a derived fixed-point type must be representable values 
of the parent type. 

CD5007B 

This test wrongly expects an implicitly declared subprogram to be at the 
address that is specified for an unrelated subprogram (line 303). 

ED7004B, ED7005C & D, ED7006C & D [5 tests] 

These tests check various aspects of the use of the three SYSTEM 
pragmas; the AVO withdraws these tests as being inappropriate for 
validation. 

CD7105A 

This test requires that successive calls to CALENDAR.CLOCK change by at 
least SYSTEM.TICK; however, by Commentary AI-00201, it is only the 
expected frequency of change that must be at least SYSTEM.TICK -- 
particular instances of change may be less (line 29). 

CD7203B, & CD7204B 

These tests use the 'SIZE length clause and attribute, whose 
interpretation is considered problematic by the WG9 ARG. 

CD7205D 

This test checks an invalid test objective: it treats the specification 
of storage to be reserved for a task's activation as though it were like 
the specification of storage for a collection. 

CE2107I 

This test requires that objects of two similar scalar types be 
distinguished when read from a file--DATA_ERROR is expected to be raised 
by an attempt, to read one object as of the other type. However, it is 
not clear exactly how the Ada standard 14.2.4:4 is to be interpreted; 
thus, this test objective is not considered valid, (line 90) 

CE3111C 

This test requires certain behavior, when two files are associated with 
the same external file, that is not required by the Ada standard. 

CE3301A 

This test contains several calls to END_OF_LINE & END_OF_PAGE that have 
no parameter: these calls were intended to specify a file, not to refer 
to STANDARD_INPUT (lines 103, 107, 118, 132, & 136). 


D-2 







CE3411B 

This test requires that a text file's column number be set to COUNT'LAST 
in order to check that LAYOUT_ERROR is raised by a subsequent PUT 
operation. But the former operation will generally raise an exception 
due to a lack of available disk space, and the test would thus encumber 
validation testing. 

E28005C 

This test expects that the string TOP OF PAGE. --63" of line 204 
will appear at the top of the listing page due to a prag::.a PAGE in line 
203; but line 203 contains text that follows the pragma, and it is this 
that must appear at the top of the page.

10.2 Options 

Options control the type of processing the compiler 
performs. They enable the selection of listings produced as part 
of the compilation process, make special processing requests, and 
indicate when special compilation units are being compiled. The 
compiler options, their functions and defaults are summarized in 
Table 10-1. Each option may be specified as shown or preceded by 
the three characters NO_ to specify the opposite option. For 
example, SOURCE turns the source listing on; NO_SOURCE turns the 
source listing off. 

The Compiler produces a diagnostic of severity level WARNING 
if any of the following conditions are encountered during the 
processing of options: 

a. The complement of an option already specified is 
specified. The first option will be ignored. For 
example, if NO_SOURCE is specified, then SOURCE is 
specified later in the option list, SOURCE will be in 
effect; 

b. An option already specified is re-specified. The 
first option will be ignored; or 

c. An undefined option is specified. 

There is no examination of options to determine whether 
redundant combinations of options are specified. For example, 
specifying both NO_SOURCE and NO_PRIVATE will not result in a 
diagnostic. 

Some options impact the speed with which the compilation 
process is completed and the efficiency of the object code 
produced by the Compiler. The remainder of this section 
discusses the implications of options for the compilation 
process, how options affect the quality of object code generated 
by the Compiler, and guidelines for using them.

I Option Function 


Listing Control Options: 

ATTRIBUTE Produce a symbol attribute listing. 

(Produces an attribute cross-reference listing 
when both ATTRIBUTE and CROSS_REFERENCE are 
specified.) Default: NO_ATTRIBUTE. 

CROSS_REFERENCE Produce a cross-reference listing. 

(Produces an attribute cross-reference listing 
when both ATTRIBUTE and CROSS_REFERENCE are 
specified.) Default: NO_CROSS_REFERENCE. 

DIAGNOSTICS Produce a diagnostic summary listing. 

Default: NO_DIAGNOSTICS. 

MACHINE Produce a machine code listing if code 

generated. Code is generated when 
CONTAINER_GENERATION is in effect and there 
are no diagnostics of severity ERROR, SYSTEM, 
or FATAL; and if there are diagnostics of 
severity level WARNING and CODEJDN^WARNING is 
in effect. If a machine code listing is 
requested and no code is generated, a 
diagnostic of severity NOTE is reported. 
Default: NO__MACHINE. 

NOTES Include diagnostics of severity NOTE in the 

source listings and in the diagnostic summary 
listing. Default: NO_NOTES. 

PRIVATE If there is a source listing, text in the 

private part of a package specification is to 
be listed in accordance with the selected 
SOURCE option, subject to requirements of LIST 
pragmas. Default: PRIVATE. 

SOURCE Produce a listing of the source text. 

Default: NO_SOURCE. 

SUMMARY Produce a summary listing, always produced 

when there are errors in the compilation. 
Default: NO SUMMARY

Special Processing Options: 

CHECKS Provide runtime error checking. NO_CHECKS 

suppresses all runtime error checking. Please 
refer to the Pragma SUPPRESS description for 
further information on runtime error checking. 
Default: CHECKS. 

CODE_ON_WARNING Generate code (and, if requested, a machine 
code listing) when there are diagnostics of 
severity level WARNING, provided there are no 
FATAL, SYSTEM, or ERROR diagnostics. 
NO_CODE_ON_WARNING means generate no code (and, 
if requested, no machine code listing) when there 
are diagnostics of severity level WARNING. 
Default: CODE_ON_WARNING. 

CONTAINER_GENERATION 

Produce a container if diagnostic severity 
permits. NO_CONTAINER GENERATION means that no 
container is to be produced, regardless of 
diagnostic severity. If a container is not 
produced because NO_CONTAINER_GENERATION is in 
effect, code is not generated (nor is a machine 
code listing, if requested). 

Default: CONTAINER_GENERATION. 

DEBUG Generates debugger symbolic information and, 

as required, changes the code being generated 
If NO DEBUG is specified, the compiler output 
includes only that information needed to link, 
export, and execute the current unit. 

Default: NO^DEBUG. 

This option Is ignored for a unit that: 

o is a package or subprogram specification, 
o is a subprogram body for which there is no 
previous declaration, or 
o contains a body stub, pragma INLINE, 
generic declaration, or a generic body. 

A diagnostic of severity NOTE is issued when 
the option is ignored.

Special Processing Options (continued): 

EXECUTIVE Enable pragma EXECUTIVE and allow visibility to 

units which have been compiled with the 
/RTE_ONLY option. 

Default: NO_EXECUTIVE. 

MEASURE Deferred. 

OPTIMIZE Enable global optimizations in accordance with 

the optimization pragmas specified in the source 

program. Default: NO_OPTIMIZE 

When NO_OPTIMIZE is in effect, no global 
optimizations are performed, regardless of 
pragmas specified. The OPTIMIZE option enables 
global optimization. The goals of global 
optimization may be influenced by the user 
through the Ada-defined OPTIMIZE pragma. If 
TIME is specified, the global optimizer 
concentrates on optimizing execution time. 

If SPACE is specified, the global optimizer 
concentrates on optimizing code size. If the 
user does not include pragma OPTIMIZE, the 
optimizations emphasize TIME over SPACE. 

If NO_OPTIMIZE is in effect, no optimizations 
are performed, regardless of the pragma. 

RTE_ONLY Restrict visibility of this unit only to those 

units compiled with the /EXECUTIVE option. 
Default: NO RTE ONLY.
