13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words) 

Research performed in collaboration with George Mason University, the University 
of California at Berkeley, and Berkeley Research Associates in order to develop 
a freely-available, re-usable, object-oriented PIC code in C++. The code 
should have a state-of-the-art graphical user interface (GUI) and 
physics capabilities such as a fully relativistic and electromagnetic 
field solver, variable geometries (cylindrical, cartesian, etc.), a 
multi-conductor package, extensive diagnostics, etc. The code will have 
extensive documentation.

Research Objectives: 

Perform research in collaboration with George Mason University, the University of 
California at Berkeley, and Berkeley Research Associates in order to develop a freely-available, 
re-usable, object-oriented PIC code in C++. The code should have a state-of-the-art graphical 
user interface (GUI) and physics capabilities such as a fully relativistic and electromagnetic field 
solver, variable geometries (cylindrical, cartesian, etc.), a multi-conductor package, extensive 
diagnostics, etc. The code will have extensive documentation. 





Status of research effort: 


This research effort is a collaborative effort between FM Technologies, the University of 
California at Berkeley, George Mason University, and Berkeley Research Associates. Thus, the 
project status reflects the work of all the researchers. The particular responsibilites of FM 
Technologies, Inc. in this effort is to provide overall support for integration of the code among 
the various groups, testing of OOPIC, and management of (and scientific consultation to) the 
effort at George Mason University. 

During the no-cost extension to the final report, FM Technologies was involved in the 
following major activities: 

♦ Management, support, and scientific consultation to the GUI developer, Dr. James Acquah. 

♦ Physics Code Development 

♦ Manual writing, editing, and development 

These issues are discussed in detail in the following sections. 


Management, Support, and Scientific Consultation to the effort at GMU: 


During the no-cost extension, FMT's prime goal was to ensure development of a 32-bit 
version of PC OOPIC which was as bug-free and reliable as possible. FMT was able to impact 
the GMU contract by: 

♦ Helping to keep the chief GUI designer, James Acquah, employed at GMU so as to be able 
to sustain the development of the GUI. 

♦ Purchasing software needed for GUI development and testing for GMU. 

♦ Aiding in communication, and interfacing with the physics developers on the West Coast 
and the GUI developers at GMU. 


Physics Code Development: 

Improved the FieldEmitter Boundary in collaboration with John Verboncoeur of UC 
Berkeley. Developed a number of new input decks, the most important being a deck for which a 
TEM wave is injected into a coaxial cavity which feeds into an rf cavity. The TEM wave 
mode-converts to a TM 01 mode. Part of the cavity is made up of a field-emitter which field emits 
when subject to the TM 0] electric field. This input deck thus simulates a high-power diode. 



Manual Writing, Editing, and Development: 


FMT is responsible for the documentation of the code. During this period we completed 
the development of a World Wide Web version of the Users Manual, Developers Manual, and 
the Algorithm Manual. Because this is a "new-generation" PIC code, an online manual version 
was considered appropriate by AFOSR technical supervisor, Dr. Robert Barker.
