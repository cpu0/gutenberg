SUMMARY 


This paper encompasses that part of error analysis which deals with errors 
resulting from the instrumentation used in measuring pertinent wind-tunnel 
parameters. The parameters, for this discussion and analysis, are limited to 
those required for the wind-tunnel model measurements. The pertinent parame- 
ters, their standard deviations, and the theoretical derivation of them, are 
given. BASIC programs and plots for the standard deviations of dynamic pres- 
sure, Mach number, and Reynolds number are included for the National Transonic 
Facility. A literature search was made back to 1934 and it was found that 
information of this kind is almost nonexistent. 


INTRODUCTION 

In any successful research endeavor, it should be possible to experimen- 
tally validate the results. In addition, the same or other experimenters 
duplicating the parameters of the experiment should be able to get the same 
results within experimental error. When this cannot be achieved, it must be 
concluded that the theories or formulations that were to be validated were 
incorrect or that large errors of some kind entered into the experiment, which 
prevents duplication of results within the experimental error. 

In numerous reported wind-tunnel measurements, it is indicated or can be 
inferred that correlation of measurements between similar tests has not reached 
a level of desired consistency. The purpose of this paper is to determine the 
extent to which the accuracy and precision of the measuring instrumentation 
contributes to the total error. Though it is not dealt with herein, the two 
other types of errors are those introduced in establishing and measuring perti- 
nent tunnel parameters and those entering into the acquisition and reduction of 
data. 


Before any results can be compared, it is imperative that their accuracies 
and precisioBS be reported in a consistent manner. The major experimental 
errors are either systematic or random (accidental) . Although systematic 
errors do exist and occur, they are not statistical and can be corrected or 
eliminated. Therefore, they are not further discussed in this paper. This 
work assumes that the errors are random (accidential) , which means that they 
are variable in magnitude, follow no pattern in occurrence, and can be either 
negative or positive. General references 1 , 2, and 3 show that the arithmetic 
mean of the measured value is the one that most closely approaches the true 
value of the measured quantity. The standard deviation, which is the root- 
mean-square value of the deviations, best describes the scatter of the mea- 
sured values from the mean value. In reporting any experimentally measured 
results, therefore, the accuracy (arithmetic mean) and the standard deviation 
of the mean value a/^/n should be given or the mean and a preferably with 
n included. When grappling these results, either set of values should also be 
shown. In the following pages and in appendix A it is shown how to obtain 


the standard deviations of significant parameters of wind-tunnel measurements. 
Knowing the number of observations taken to obtain the standard deviation, the 
standard deviation of the mean value is obtained. From these and their mean 
values, it can be determined where accurate and precise measurements are more 
critical and necessary. This may require more research and development to 
advance the state of the instrument art as well as the other areas involved 
in the final wind-tunnel data accumulation. 

Since the current problem is a manifold problem, this paper deals only with 
the accuracy and precision of the measuring instrumentation being used in wind- 
tunnel testing at present, the theoretical analyses which show where the errors 
are produced, their criticality and how they combine, the development of the 
second-order strain-gauge balance interactions and how they combine, and why 
higher-order terms are ignored. Then, using the parameters for the National 
Transonic Facility (NTF) at Langley Research Center and the instrument errors 
for the instruments used in this facility in the derived formulas, the follow- 
ing standard deviations were obtained; 0(Reynolds number), 0 (Mach number), 

0 (dynamic pressure), 0 (normal- force model), 0 (axial-force model), 0(pitching- 
mcment model) , 0 (yawing-moment model), 0(rolling-mc*nent model), and subsidiary 

sigma values for items such as normal-force coefficient, side-force coefficient, 
lift and drag coefficients, etc. Programs have been written (see appendix B) 
for the Hewlett-Packard 9830A calculator for obtaining 0(Mach number), 
0(Reynolds number), and 0(dynamic pressure), and results for the NTF have been 
plotted. Assuming the values for the parameters and the instrumentation for the 
NTF remain unchanged, potential users of the NTF should find the error results 
of this report useful. If changes in the values do occur, these can readily be 
taken care of in the data section of the Hewlett-Packard program.

script ”(2)” on any of these subscripts indicates the second-order term of that 
component. For example, ^^(2) second-order term of the normal-force 

component. Any two of these components together indicate the interaction of 
the second term upon the first. For example, FjjFy is the cross term whereby 
the side- force component contributes to the normal- force output. 


ERROR ANALYSIS 

When considering the following sections, it should be understood that small 
errors in the independent variables are assumed in the resulting formulas. If 
the errors become so large that second- or higher-order terms are not negligi- 
ble, then the errors are derived by using A values and not exact differen- 
tials. It is assumed that random errors are being dealt with whose magnitudes 
are variable and whose occurrence is disordered. It is also assumed that their 
distribution is normal or Gaussian if systematic errors are removed and good 
sampling practices employed. In those equations that are applicable, the val- 
ues used for the constants are for air. Where different substances are used, 
the appropriate constants for that substance should be used. 

The general texts on errors given in the references show that the mean 
value of a measured quantity (assuming randan errors only) approaches the true 
value of that quantity. If systematic (bias) errors exist, then the mean value 
becomes displaced from its true value and results in inaccuracy. Systematic 
errors are not statistical and by definition can be eliminated when they are 
discovered. The general reference texts also show that the root-mean-square 
value of the measured quantity equals its standard deviation from the mean 
value. The mean value and the standard deviation can thus define the accuracy 
and precision of a random measurement and should always be used together when

this is done. If a function f(x,y,z) is dependent on the three independent 

variables x, y, and z, the standard deviation may be obtained by taking the 
exact differential of the function, e.g., 


df = — ox + — oy + — oz 
9x 3y 9z 


( 1 ) 


If df is the deviation frcxn f, then the right side of equation (1) must be 
the sum of the deviations of the three independent variables. Using superposi- 
tion and the definition of O, then 



The mean value of f is as follows: f = 


This section is a summary of the standard deviations which are valid over 
all Mach numbers and assume the use of differentials (small errors) . The deri- 
vations for these values as well as the remainder of the balance output errors

For an interaction correction of a six-ccanponent strain-gauge balance, it 
is assumed that each component contributes second-order terms and that the 
second-order terms are small. Taking two components at a time to obtain the 

6 ! 

second-order terms (refs. 5 and 6), results in 6Co = = 15 . Fifteen 

2 ! ( 6 - 2 )! 

cross terms plus 6 first-order terms plus 6 squared terms result in 27 terms 
for each of the 6 model components obtained from the strain-gauge balances. 
These terms are listed in table I. The symbolization (see table I) of a con- 
tribution of side force, for example, on the normal force is K -|^2 times Fy 
for the first-order term and K-] 3 times Fy for the second-order term. This 
notation is more easily grasped in the follcwing matrix equations. Terms 
involving higher than second order are usually too small to be significant and 
will be ignored. The balance output column matrix is 

Normal-force output from balance 
Side-force output from balance 
Axial-force output from balance 
Pitching-moment output frcm balance 
Yawing-moment output from balance

force-mcxnent equations for a six-component strain-gauge 








If we let B equal the matrix in the left c»lumn, Y equal the matrix 
in the middle c»lumn, and Z equal the matrix in the right column of equa- 
tions (12) , and let K equal the 6x6 matrix and K-| equal the 6 x 21 matrix, 
then 


B = KY + K-i Z 


Since B equals the output from the strain-gauge balances and Y equals the 
actual loads applied to the balance, solving for Y yields 

K~**KY = - K“'*KiZ 

Since K“^K, if K“^ exists, is the identity or unity matrix K”^K = D ] and 
y = - K*^K*|Z. From this, a(Y) can be obtained, which is the same as 

a(F^), a(FY), o{Fp^), a(My)r a(Mz),or a(Mx). 

Since obtaining Y is prolonged and tedious and since it, as well as 0(Y) 
is not available as yet, the development in this paper proceeds with the outputs 
of the strain-gauge balance components, matrix B and cr(B), that is, a(B-|), 
a(B2) , a(B3), a(B4), a(B5) , and aCBg) • From this it is shown how to obtain 
the extrema and thus the errors of the Y matrix. As shown in equation (13), 
a(B’|)/B'| = f (Fjq,FyfF;^,MY,Mz,Mx, the interaction coefficients, and measurement 
errors) . Since the only time F^, Fy, F;^, My, and Mx are known is 

at balance calibration, the K factors are obtained using known loads having 
known load standard deviations and using statistical methods for arriving at 
the expectation values for K and cr(K). The measured values of K are 
obtained by applying the loads singly and in combination and observing the 
effects on and the values of the outputs of interest. Once this information is 
obtained, wind-tunnel measurements can be made. For example, suppose measure- 
ments of the output of the normal component of the balance are made. If the 
loads on the model are not known, all of them may be assumed to be acting. 

Each balance component output is then multiplied by its sensitivity constant 
which was obtained during balance calibration. This yields the uncorrected 
balance outputs; i.e., CjjB-j , CyB2, ^n®5^ ^Z®6- These 

outputs are then corrected by taking the products of the interaction coeffi- 
cients and their uncorrected balance outputs and subtracting them from 
which yields a corrected B-| . Corrected B2, B3, B4, B5, and B5 are 
obtained in the same manner- The process is reiterated until the corrected 
balance outputs converge to a value which is within 1 percent of their last 
value. With these values, the standard deviations of the balance outputs can 
be found by using equation (13) in the body of the paper and equations (A21) 
to (A25) in appendix A. Once the corrected loads are determined, the calibra- 
tion curve shows the corresponding balance outputs. The positive and negative 
standard deviations can be projected onto the calibration and in turn onto the 
axis for the actual load values. For linear calibrations, these projections 
would show the load standard deviations. For nonlinear calibrations, these 
projections would show the extrema from which the errors are obtained. It is 
important to note that all of the interaction coefficients K, excluding sys- 
tematic errors, have random errors associated with their measurement, and for 
this reason they are treated as random variables because they can vary between 
the extremes set by their error limits.

The standard deviations of B-\ , B2, B3, B4, B5, and Bg are typified 
by equation ( 13 ). The derivation for a(B^)/Bi, in which all the K factors 
are considered to be random variables, is as follows:

The standard deviations for the angle measurements are not derived but 
measured. The technique for obtaining the angles is to use an accelerometer 
employing a null servo system. By this means a strut angle can be measured to 
a relative precision of 20 = ±0.02° and a model angle of 20 = ±0.03°. The 
acceleraneter must be isolated from vibration which has an adverse effect on 
it. Tunnel investigators would like to obtain 20 = ±0.01°. This is possible 
to obtain but is not routinely feasible at present. 




Of cxjurse, other factors contributing independently to any of these stand- 
ard deviations, such as the error in Cd and Cj, due to grit effect, internal 
friction effects, etc., must be added in. Fjj, P^, a, p^., p, and S may be 
dependent on other parameters, so their errors would be formulated on more 
fundamental parameters. This continues until the last desired quantity is 
formulated in as fundamental a system as desired. The latter is usually mass, 
length, time, temperature, and charge. This would be the suggested error- 
analysis format reconroended for use in instrument work. For wind-tunnel appli- 
cation or for any other specialized field application, the error- analysis format 
would be stated in terms of basic parameters and could be presented thusly;

Some of these formulations can be used immediately and in a general way. 
As an example, the National Transonic Facility (NTF) , a cryogenic tunnel using 
nitrogen is being built at this Center. Tentatively, the following parameter 
limits are being used for its design: 


1 8 


Specific heat of nitrogen Yn 2 atmosphere 1.4 to 1.45 

Specific heat of nitrogen at nine atmospheres 1.74 

Stagnation pressure p^ from M = 0.2 to 1.0, N/m^ 8.963 x 1 0^ 

Mach number 0.2 to 1.2 

R/A, m"'' 0 to 3.94 X 108 

q, N/m^ absolute 0 to 3.352 x 1 0^ 


The total temperature varies from 339 K to the temperature of liquid nitrogen 
for the value of Pt at that Mach number. 

Using the preceding information, programs were written in BASIC and run on 
the Hewlett-Packard 9830A calculator for 0 (M) , <7 (q) , and cr(R/i-) . The pro- 

grams are in appendix B and the plots of the standard deviations are shown in 
figures 1 to 4. These standard deviations are due to instrument errors only, 
and other independent sources contributing to the error of these variables must 
be included to obtain their total standard deviation. 


DESCRIPTICW OF INSTRUMENTATION 

Some of the basic instrumentation types whose parameters are used in this 
error analysis are described. The error values are real and were obtained 
from the manufacturer's error-band quotation and from data obtained from the 
instruments. 


The acoustic mancxneter is essentially a U-tube mercury mancmeter. (See 
fig. 5.) A sound signal is simultaneously sent through both legs of the manom- 
eter from which the differential mercury height, and thus the differential 
pressure, is obtained. This manometer is used over the following ranges, and 
the errors given by the manufacturers are shown as 3a values: 


1 . 034 X 1 q 5 N/m2 < 
4.826 X 1 q 4 N/m2 < 
2.758 X 105 N/m2 < 
1 .931 X 1 N/m2 < 


Pt < 2.758 X 1 q 5 N/m^; 
p < 2.758 X 105 N/m2; 
Pt < 4.826 X 1 0^ N/m^; 
p < 4.826 X 1 0^ N/m^; 


3a = 2.069 X 10l N/m2 
3a = 2.069 X lol N/m2 
3a = 4.137 X 10l N/m2 
3a = 4.137 X 10^ N/m2 


For higher pressures, a f used-quartz Bourdon tube gauge is used. (See fig. 6.) 
As the tube is deflected by a change in pressure, it is restored electromag- 
netically to a null position, thus minimizing errors. The current required to 
hold the tube in its null position is a measure of the pressure. Its 3a error 
is 0.006 percent of full scale plus 0.012 percent of the reading. In normal 
tunnel operations, for pressures greater than 4.826 x 10^ N/m^, only one fused- 
quartz Bourdon tube type of transducer is used whose full scale exceeds the 
estimated total tunnel pressure. In the NTF, however, two will be used with 


19 


full scales of 6.895 x 1 0^ N/m^ eind 1.034 x 1 0® N/m^. A sensor will activate 
a switch which will cut the lower pressure instrument off just before its full 
scale is reached. The data will be marked at the same time to identify the 
recording transducer. The full scales of the f used-quartz Bourdon tube pres- 
sure transducers start at 6.895 x 10^ N/m^, and increase in multiples of ten. 
There are also pressure transducers with full scales which start at 
1,034 X 10^ N/m^ and increase in multiples of ten. In fact, using three pres- 
sure capsules and staying within the pressure limits of these capsules, any 
full scale may be obtained by adjustment of the electronics. 


Acoustic mancmeters have at least three times the precision of the 
fused-quartz Bourdon tube type, but since their price is more than three 
times as high, they are used only when warranted by the precision require- 
ments. (Acoustic manometers have almost the accuracy and precision of a 
primary standard.) In tunnel work, acoustic manometers are used for measuring 
pressures below 4.826 x 1 0^ N/m^. For higher pressures, fused-quartz Bourdon 
tube pressure transducers are available with full scales of 5.171 x 10^ N/m^, 
6.895 X 10^ N/m^, and 1.034 x 1 0® N/m^. The last value is sufficient for 
tunnel work. However, these instruments can be obtained at very much higher 
full scales. By the same token, if the accuracy and precision of the fused- 
quartz transducer are adequate, they can also be obtained with full scales of 
6.895 X 1 q 4 N/m2, 1.034 x 10^ N/m^, 2.068 x 1 0^ N/m^, and 3.447 x 1 O^ N/m^. 
This is also essentially a static-type transducer. 


Stagnation temperature measurements are made with platinum resistance 
thermcsneters. (See fig. 7.) The operating range of these thermometers is 
from 8 to 533 K. In steady-state operation, a = 0.3 K. 


The six-ccsnponent strain-gauge-balance calibration fixture is shown in 
figure 8. This fixture, as well as manual loading, is used to calibrate the 
strain-gauge balances and obtain the coefficients for the interactions and 
second-order terms. 


RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

This discussion is limited to some typical results rather than all the 
results that can be obtained and is used to illustrate what can be done. It is 
based on parametric data applicable to the NTF. In figure 1 , which is a plot 
of a(M) versus Mach number, 0(M) is dependent on the pressure parameter. By 
using basic relationships and dimensional analysis, and by following procedures 
shown in appendix A, a(M) can be written with dependency on other parameters. 
The sharp breaks in the curves of figures 1 and 2 occur because different types 
of pressure instruments, as well as the same type with different full scales, 
are used. Since the errors are a function of the full scale of the instruments 
used and/or their indicated value, a break occurs in the error curve when the 
pressure transducer is changed. Since these error calculations are based on a 
fixed total pressure, the breaks appear when the static pressure, which is a 
function of total pressure and Mach number, changes to a value requiring a 
change of transducer range with a corresponding change in error values. It is 
apparent that the greatest absolute errors in Mach number occur at the low 
Mach numbers. This is apparent from the relationships in equation (4) and 


20 


p = P|. (1 + and from the errors in p and p^. at different Mach 

numbers. It would be preferable not to try to interpolate values for pres- 
sures not plotted, because of the instrument error changes with pressure range. 
Instead, curves should be plotted for any additional total pressures of inter- 
est. The previous comments also apply to figure 2, which is a plot of a(q) 
versus Mach number for various total pressures. In figure 3, which is a plot 
of a(R/S.) versus Mach number at a temperature of 77.8 K, the greatest abso- 
lute errors are encountered at the highest Mach numbers and increase with 
higher total pressures. 

It is profitable to examine the standard-deviation equations in the body 
of the paper because they are algebraic. Discrete points of error buildup can 
thus be pinpointed to leurge multiplying coefficients. These points can be 
verified with actual numerical values. Time can then be more efficiently 
allotted for finding the means of eliminating or reducing these large sources 
of error. Examination of equations (13) to (18) shows that second-order terms 
as well as terms produced by interactions increase the errors in the strain- 
gauge-balance outputs. In addition, the errors made in measuring the interac- 
tion coefficients increase this error still more. Errors of this type result 
in nonlinear calibrations. There are other causes for producing nonlinear 
calibrations but these can usually be isolated. When nonlinearities attribu- 
table to the aforementioned causes are found, the production sources should be 
attenuated within the bounds of desired accuracy and precision and the limits 
imposed by the state of the art. 

Figure 4 shows that the standard deviation obtained for Mach numbers using 
only fused-quartz Bourdon tube pressure transducers of different full scales 
gives 2 to 3.5 times the error obtained in figure 1, where different types of 
pressure transducers were used. These larger errors still fall within accept- 
able limits for most research testing. 

Equations (1 3) and (24) to (28) give the relative errors for the strain- 
gauge-balance outputs. Although this may be the desired end information for 
some researchers, the actual loads and their errors are probably the more 
desired information. This information can be obtained from the calibration 
curves by finding the load corresponding to the balance output and applying 
the sigma values to obtain the extrema of the loads. The explicit, theoretical 
solution for the actual loads is omitted in this paper because it is believed 
that it more properly belongs in a paper dealing with the strain-gauge balances 
alone. These same equations show also that since the K coefficients appear 
everywhere as multipliers and are used in the iteration process, it is neces- 
sary that they be determined with a high degree of confidence in accuracy and 
precision. 


CONCLUDING REMARKS 

The work herein represents a beginning to a systenatic approach to error 
analysis for measurement instrumentation for the National Transonic Facility 
(NTF), which is located at the Langley Research Center. This work can be 
easily applied to any wind-tunnel measurements. It was long overdue in that a 
thorough search of the literature back to 1 934 revealed almost no such work. 


21 



Also, the work that was found constituted only a very small part of the effort 
being undertaken. Again, it is very simple to apply the error analysis of this 
paper to almost any instrument measurements. However, throughout this work 
randan errors are assumed; that is, there is just as much likelihood of the 
errors being negative as positive. They are variable in magnitude and dis- 
ordered in occurrence. It is also assumed that systematic errors are removed 
and good sampling practices employed. 

Pertinent wind-tunnel parameters, their standard deviations, and their 
theoretical derivation are given as are BASIC language computer programs and 
plots for obtaining the standard deviations of Mach number, dynamic pressure, 
and Reynolds number versus Mach number for the NTF. These standard deviations 
are for the instrument contribution only. It can be determined from the equa- 
tions and graphs which parameters are producing the largest errors or undesir- 
able errors and take the necessary steps for minimizing them or making them, 
insignificant. 

Finally, the author has noted that in many technical writings and investi- 
gations, the measurement errors are not reported, or are erroneously reported, 
partial errors are reported as total errors, or for whatever reason, the errors 
are glossed. The author hopes that this work, in some way, will encourage 
investigators to analyze their measurements, isolate and eliminate errors that 
have no role in statistical measurement, find the causes of and minimize their 
statistical errors when possible, and, finally, report their findings (their 
measured values) with their appropriate related errors.

16. Abstract 


This paper encompasses that part of error analysis which deals with errors result- 
ing from the instrumentation used in measuring pertinent wind-tunnel parameters. 
The parameters, for this discussion and analysis, are limited to those required 
for the wind-tunnel model measurements. The pertinent parameters, their standard 
deviations, and the theoretical derivation of them, are given. BASIC programs 
and plots for the standard deviations of dynamic pressure, Mach number, and 
Reynolds number are included for the National Transonic Facility. A literature 
search was made back to 1934 and it was found that information of this kind is 
almost nonexistent.
