13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 Words) 

Multi-Agent Distributed Goal Satisfaction, MADGS, is a JAVA-based mobile-agent system under development to 
facilitate distributed mission planning and execution in complex dynamic environments with a focus on distributed 
goal satisfaction. The MADGS system represents the union of five separate components, Agent-Server (named 
Carolina), mobile-agents, Distributed Goal Satisfaction (DGS), agentTool, and Prodigy. The target real-world 
operational environment for the MADGS system is a network topology consisting of intermittent nodes and 
uncertain network connections that exist in a large-scale, multi-platform dynamic network. The resulting design 
developed for this environment addresses the communications issues faced when handling massive numbers of 
mobile-agents in such a topology. Our primary contribution to date has been examining the communications 
infrastructure requirements and changing how real-time mission planning and execution can be achieved without 
re-planning in the face of plan failures.

Final Project Summary 

Goal: Facilitate distributed mission planning and execution in complex dynamic 
environments with a focus on distributed goal satisfaction 

Approach: Utilize multi-agent systems, mixed-initiative systems, and intelligent resource 
substitution to avoid costly plan failures 

Multi-Agent Distributed Goal Satisfaction, MADGS, is a JAVA-based mobile-agent 
system under development to facilitate distributed mission planning and execution in 
complex dynamic environments with a focus on distributed goal satisfaction. The 
MADGS system represents the union of five separate components, Agent-Server (named 
Carolina), mobile-agents, Distributed Goal Satisfaction (DGS), agentTool, and Prodigy. 
The target real-world operational environment for the MADGS system is a network 
topology consisting of intermittent nodes and uncertain network connections that exist in 
a large-scale, multi-platform dynamic network. The resulting design developed for this 
environment addresses the communications issues faced when handling massive numbers 
of mobile-agents in such a topology. Our primary contribution to date has been 
ex aminin g the communications infrastructure requirements and changing how real-time 
mission planning and execution can be achieved without re-planning in the face of plan 
failures. 

For real-time planning and execution, we developed the ability to autonomously handle 
changes in the constraints of a plan which can mean the success or failure of any 
distributed operational mission/goal. The need to re-plan or backtrack due to constraint 
changes in any plan can mean a substantial resource loss; be it lost capital or life, the 
expense is real. Our approach seeks to mitigate a significant amount of this loss by 
preemptively expecting failure, defining alternative constraint configurations, developing 
delivery arrangements and in the event of a failure offering a near instant solution instead 
of re-planning. Basically, our approach is to model resources as having interchangeable 
attributes for application to different tasks. When plan failure occurs due to resource 
failures, different resource agents much like quartermasters, etc., work together and 
negotiate quickly how alternative resources may be found and used. When combined 
with a human at the scene so to speak, decisions can be quickly made and implemented.
