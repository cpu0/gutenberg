INTRODUCTION 



This Validation Summary Report {VSR?" describes the extent to which a 
specific Ada compiler conforms to the Ada Standard, ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A. 
This report explains all technical terms used within it and thoroughly 

reports the results of_testiiig this compiler using the Ada Compiler 

Validation Capability "An Ada compiler must be implemented 
according to the Ada Standard, and any implementation-dependent features 
must conform to the requirements of the Ada Standard. The Ada Standard 
must be implemented in its entirety, and nothing cam be implemented that is 
not in the Standard. ^ 

Even though all validated Ada compilers conform to the Ada Standard, it 
must be understood that some differences do exist between implementations. 
The Ada Standard permits some implementation dependencies—for example, the 
maximum length of identifiers or the maximum values of integer types. 
Other differences between compilers result from the characteristics of 
particular operating systems, hardware, or implementation strategies. All 
the dependencies observed during the process of testing this compiler are 


given in this report .5 


The information in this report is derived from the test results produced 
during validation testing. The validation process includes submitting a 
suite of standardized tests, the ACVC, as inputs to an Ada compiler and 
evaluating the results." The purpose of validating is to ensure conformity 
of the compiler to the Ada Standard by testing that the compiler properly 
implements legal language\ constructs and that it identifies and rejects 
illegal language constructs. The testing also identifies behavior that is 
implementation-dependent but is permitted by the Ada Standard. Six classes 
of tests are used. These tests are designed to perform checks at compile 
time, at link time, and during execution.

INTRODUCTION 


1.1 PURPOSE OF THIS VALIDATION SUMMARY REPORT 


This VSR documents the results of the validation testing performed on an 
Ada compiler. Testing was carried out for the following purposes: 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs supported by the 
compiler that do not conform to the Ada Standard 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs not supported by 
the compiler but required by the Ada Standard 

. To determine that the implementation-dependent behavior is allowed 
by the Ada Standard 

Testing of this compiler was conducted by SofTech, Inc. under the 
direction of the AVF according to procedures established by the Ada Joint 
Program Office and administered by the Ada Validation Organization (AVO). 
On-site testing was completed 13 February 1990 at Torrance CA.

INTRODUCTION 


Failed test An ACVC test for which the compiler generates a result that 
demonstrates nonconformity to the Ada Standard. 

Host The computer on which the compiler resides. 

Inapplicable An ACVC test that uses features of the language that a 

test compiler is not required to support or may legitimately 

support in a way other than the one expected by the test. 

Passed test An ACVC test for which a compiler generates the expected 
result. 

Target The computer for which a compiler generates code. 

Test A program that checks a compiler's conformity regarding a 

particular feature or a combination of features to the Ada 
Standard. In the context of this report, the term is used to 
designate a single test, which may comprise one or more 
files. 

An ACVC test found to be incorrect and not used to check 
conformity to the Ada Standard. A test may be incorrect 
because it has an invalid test objective, fails to meet its 
test objective, or contains illegal or erroneous use of the 
language. 


1.5 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conformity to the Ada Standard is measured using the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains both legal and illegal Ada programs structured into six test 
classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies 
the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable, 
and special program units are used to report their results during 
execution. Class B tests are expected to produce compilation errors. 
Class L tests are expected to produce compilation or link errors because of 
the way in which a program library is used at link time. 

Class A tests ensure the successful compilation of legal Ada programs with 
certain language constructs which cannot be verified at compile time. 
There are no explicit program components in a Class A test to check 
semantics. For example, a Class A test checks that reserved words of 
another language (other than those already reserved in the Ada language) 
are not treated as reserved words by an Ada compiler. A Class A test is 
passed if no errors are detected at compile time and the program executes 
to produce a PASSED message. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each tost in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that every syntax or 
semantic error in the test is detected. A Class B test is passed if every 
illegal construct that it contains is detected by the compiler.

INTRODUCTION 


Class C tests check the run time system to ensure that legal Ada programs 
can be correctly compiled and executed. Each Class C test is self-checking 
and produces a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result vhen it is executed. 


Class D tests check the compilation and execution capacities of a compiler. 
Since there are no capacity requirements placed on a compiler by the Ada 
Standard for some parameters—for example, the number of identifiers 
permitted in a compilation or the number of units in a library—a compiler 
may refuse to compile a Class D test and still be a conforming compiler. 
Therefore, if a Class D test fails to compile because the capacity of the 
compiler is exceeded, the test is classified as inapplicable. If a Class D 
test compiles successfully, it is self-checking and produces a PASSED or 
FAILED message during execution. 


Class E tests are expected to execute successfully and check 
implementation-dependent options and resolutions of ambiguities in the Ada 
Standard. Each Class E test is self-checking and produces a NOT 
APPLICABLE, PASSED, or FAILED message vhen it is compiled and executed. 
Hovever, the Ada Standard permits an implementation to reject programs 
containing some features addressed by Class E tests during compilation. 
Therefore, a Class E test is passed by a compiler if it is compiled 
successfully and executes to produce a PASSED message, or if it is rejected 
by the compiler for an allowable reason. 


Class L tests check that incomplete or illegal Ada programs involving 
multiple, separately compiled units are detected and not allowed to 
execute. Class L tests are compiled separately and execution is attempted. 
A Class L test passes if it is rejected at link time—that is, an attempt 
to execute the main program must generate an error message before any 
declarations in the main program or any units referenced by the main 
program are elaborated. In some cases, an implementation may legitimately 
detect errors during compilation of the test. 


Two library units, the package REPORT and the procedure CHECK_FILE, support 
the self-checking features of the executable tests. The package REPORT 
provides the mechanism by which executable tests report PASSED, FAILED, or 
NOT APPLICABLE results. It also provides a set of identity functions used 
to defeat some compiler optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that 
would circumvent a test objective. The procedure CHECK FILE is used to 
check the contents of text files written by some of the Class C tests for 
chapter 14 of the Ada Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. These tests produce messages that 
are examined to verify that the units are operating correctly. If these 
units are not operating correctly, then the validation is not attempted. 


The text of each test in the ACVC follovs conventions that are intended to 
ensure that the tests are reasonably portable without modification. For 
example, the tests make use of only the basic set of 55 characters, contain 
lines with a maximum length of 72 characters, use small numeric values, and 
place features that may not be supported by all implementations in separate 
tests. Hovever, some tests contain values that require the test t- be

INTRODUCTION 


customized according to implementation-specific values—for example, an 
illegal file name. A list of the values used for this validation is 
provided in Appendix C. 

A compiler must correctly process each of the tests in the suite and 
demonstrate conformity to the Ada Standard by either meeting the pass 
criteria given for the test or by shoving that the test is inapplicable to 
the implementation. The applicability of a test to an implementation is 
considered each time the implementation is validated. A test that is 
inapplicable for one validation is not necessarily inapplicable for a 
subsequent validation. Any test that vas determined to contain an illegal 
language construct or sun erroneous language construct is vithdravn from the 
ACVC and, therefore, is not used in testing a compiler. The tests 
vithdravn at the time of this validation are given in Appendix D.

CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


2.2 IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS 

One of the purposes of validating compilers is to determine the behavior of 
a compiler in those areas of the Ada Standard that permit implementations 
to differ. Class D and E tests specifically check, for such implementation 
differences. However, tests in other classes also characterize an 
implementation. The tests demonstrate the following characteristics: 


a. Capacities. 


(1) The compiler correctly processes a compilation containing 723 
variables in the same declarative part. (See test D29002K.) 

(2) The compiler correctly processes tests containing loop 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See tests D55A03A..H (8 
tests).) 

(3) The compiler correctly processes tests containing block 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See test D56001B.) 

(4) The compiler correctly processes tests containing recursive 
procedures separately compiled as subunits nested to six 
levels. (See tests D64005E..G (3 tests).) 


b. Predefined types. 

(1) This implementation supports the additional predefined types 
SHORT INTEGER and L0NG_FL0AT in package STANDARD. (See tests 
B8600IT..Z (7 tests).) 


c. Expression evaluation. 

The order in which expressions are evaluated and the time at which 
constraints are checked are not defined by the language. While 
the ACVC tests do not specifically attempt to determine the order 
of evaluation of expressions, test results indicate the following: 

(1) Some of the default initialization expressions for record 
components are evaluated before any value is checked for 
membership in a component's subtype. (See test C32117A.) 

(2) Assignments for subtypes are performed with less precision 
than the base type. (See test C35712B.) 

(3) This implementation uses no extra bits for extra precision and 
uses all extra bits for extra range. (See test C35903A.) 


2-2 







CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(4) Sometimes NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when an integer literal 
operand in a comparison or membership test is outside the 
range of the base type. (See test C45232A.) 

(5) No exception is raised when a literal operand in a fixed-point 
comparison or membership test is outside the range of the base 
type. (See test C45252A.) 

(6) Underflow is gradual. (See tests C45524A..Z (26 tests).) 


d. Rounding. 

The method by which values are rounded in type conversions is not 
defined by the language. While the ACVC tests do not specifically 
attempt to determine the method of rounding, the test results 
indicate the folloving: 

(1) The method used for rounding to integer is round away from 
zero. (See tests C46012A..Z (26 tests).) 

(2) The method used for rounding to longest integer is round away 
from zero. (See tests C46012A..Z (26 tests).) 

(3) The method used for rounding to integer in static universal 
real expressions is round away from zero. (See test C4A014A.) 


e. Array types. 

An implementation is allowed to raise NUMERIC_ERROR or 

CONSTRAINT_ERROR for an array having a 'LENGTH that exceeds 

STANDARD.INTEGER'LAST and/or SYSTEM.MAX_INT. 

For this implementation: 

(1) Declaration of an array type or subtype declaration with more 
than SYSTEM.MAX INT components raises NUMERIC_ERROR sometimes. 
(See test C36003A.) 

(2) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised when 'LENGTH is applied to an array 

type with INTEGER'LAST + 2 components with each component 

being a null array. (See test C36202A.) 

(3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised when 'LENGTH is applied to an array 
type with SYSTEM.MAX_INT + 2 components with each component 
being a null array. (See test C36202B.) 

(4) A packed BOOLEAN array having a 'LENGTH exceeding INTEGER'LAST 
raises CONSTRAINT ERROR when the array objects are declared. 
(See test C52103X.J 


2-3 



CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(5) A packed two-dimensional BOOLEAN array with more than 
INTEGER'LAST components raises CONSTRAINT_ERROR when the array 
objects are declared. (See test C52104Y.) 

(6) A null array with one dimension of length greater than 
INTEGER'LAST may raise NUMERIC_ERR0R or CONSTRAINT_ERROR 
either when declared or assigned. Alternatively, an 
implementation may accept the declaration. However, lengths 
must match in array slice assignments. This implementation 
raises no exception. (See test E52103Y.) 

(7) In assigning one-dimensional array types, the expression is 
evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_EEROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

(8) In assigning two-dimensional array types, the expression is 
evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
vhen checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


f. Discriminated types. 

(1) In assigning record types with discriminants, the expression 
is evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


g. Aggregates. 

(1) In the evaluation of a multi-dimensional aggregate, index 
subtype checks are made as choices are evaluated. (See tests 
C43207A and C43207B.) 

(2) In the evaluation of an aggregate containing subaggregates, 
not all choices are evaluated before being checked for 
identical bounds. (See test E43212B.) 

(3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised before all choices are evaluated 
when a bound in a non-null range of a non-null aggregate does 
not belong to an index subtype. (See test E43211B.) 


h. Pragmas. 

(1) The pragma INLINE is not supported for functions or 
procedures. (See tests LA3004A..B (2 tests), EA3004C..D (2 
tests), and CA3004E..F (2 tests).) 


2-4 




CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


i. Generics. 

(1) Generic specifications and bodies can be compiled in separate 
compilations. (See tests CA1012A, CA2009C, CA2009F, BC3204C, 
and BC3205D.) 

(2) Generic unit bodies and their subunits can be compiled in 
separate compilations. (See test CA3011A.) 


j. Input and output. 

(1) The package SEQUENTIAL_IO cannot be instantiated with 
unconstrained array types or record types with discriminants 
without defaults. (See tests AE2101C, EE2201D, and EE2201E.) 

(2) The package DIRECT_IO cannot be instantiated with 
unconstrained array types or record types with discriminants 
without defaults. (See tests AE2101H, EE2401D, and EE2401G.) 

(3) Modes IN_FILE and OUT FILE are supported for SEQUENTIALIO. 
(See tests CE2102D..E (2“tests), CE2102N, and CE2102P.) 

(4) Modes IN_FILE, 0UT_FILE, and INOUT FILE are supported for 
DIRECT_I07 (See tests CE2102F, CE2102I..J (2 tests), CE2102R, 
CE2102T, and CE2102V.) 

(5) Modes IN FILE and OUT FILE are supported for text files. (See 
tests CE3102E and CE3T02I..K (3 tests).) 

(6) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for SEQUENTIAL_IO. 
(See tests CE2102G and CE2102X.) 

(7) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for DIRECT_IO. (See 
tests CE2102K and CE2102Y.) 

(8) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for text files. 
(See tests CE3102F..G (2 tests), CE3104C, CE3110A, and 
CE3114A.) 

(9) Overwriting to a sequential file truncates to the last element 
written. (See test CE2208B.) 

(10) Temporary sequential files are given names and deleted when 
closed. (See test CE2108A.) 

(11) Temporary direct files are given names and deleted when 
closed. (See test CE2108C.) 

(12) Temporary text files are given names and deleted when closed. 
(See test CE3112A.)

CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(13) More than one internal file can be associated with each 

external file for sequential files when reading only. (See 
tests CE2107A..E (5 tests), CE2102L, CE2110B, and CB2111D.) 

(14) More than one internal file cam be associated with each 

external file for direct files when reading only. (See tests 
CE2107F..H (3 tests), CE2110D, and CE2111H.) 

(15) More than one internal file cam be associated with each 

external file for text files when reading only. (See tests 
CE3111A..E (5 tests), CE3114B, and CE3115A.)

CHAPTER 3 
TEST INFORMATION 


3.1 TEST RESULTS 

Version 1.10 of the ACVC comprises 3717 tests. Vhen this compiler was 
tested, 44 tests had been vithdravn because of test errors. The AVF 
determined that 504 tests were inapplicable to this implementation. All 
inapplicable tests were processed during validation testing except for 201 
executable tests that use floating-point precision exceeding that supported 
by the implementation. Modifications to the code, processing, or grading 
for 7 tests were required to successfully demonstrate the test objective. 

The AVF concludes that the testing results demonstrate acceptable 
conformity to the Ada Standard.

3.5 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

Some tests do not apply to all compilers because they make use of features 
that a compiler is not required by the Ada Standard to support. Others may 
depend on the result of another test that is either inapplicable or 
withdrawn. The applicability of a test to an implementation is considered 
each time a validation is attempted. A test that is inapplicable for one 
validation attempt is not necessarily inapplicable for a subsequent 
attempt. For this validation attempt, 504 tests were inapplicable for the 
reasons indicated: 


a. C24113H..K (4 tests) are not applicable because the line length 

exceeds the maximum input line length permitted by this 
implementation. 

b. The following 201 tests are not applicable because they have 
floating-point type declarations requiring more digits than 
SYSTEM.MAX DIGITS:

is attempted. 


3.6 TEST, PROCESSING, AND EVALUATION MODIFICATIONS 

It is expected that some tests will require modifications of code, 
processing, or evaluation in order to compensate for legitimate 
implementation behavior. Modifications are made by the AVF in cases where 
legitimate implementation behavior prevents the successful completion of an 
(otherwise) applicable test. Examples of such modifications include: 
adding a length clause to alter the default size of a collection; splitting 
a Class B test into subtests so that all errors are detected; and 
confirming that messages produced by an executable test demonstrate 
conforming behavior that wasn't anticipated by the test (such as raising 
one exception instead of another). 

Modifications were required for 7 tests. 


The following tests were split because syntax errors at one point resulted 
in the compiler not detecting other errors in the test: 

B24009A B44004D B49003A B49005A B49009C B59001E 

At the recommendation of the AVO, the expression "2**T'MANTISSA - 1" on 
line 262 of test CC1223A was changed to "(2**(T'MANTISSA-1)-1 + 

2**(T'MANTISSA-1))" since the previous expression causes an unexpected 
exception to be raised.

3.7 ADDITIONAL TESTING INFORMATION 


3.7.1 Prevalidation 

Prior to validation, a set of test results for ACVC Version 1.10 produced 
by the TLD VAX/HAWK Ada Cross Compiler System, Version 2.1.3 compiler was 
submitted to the AVF by the applicant for review. Analysis of these 
results demonstrated that the compiler successfully passed all applicable 
tests, and the compiler exhibited the expected behavior on all inapplicable 
tests. 


3.7.2 Test Method 


Testing of the TLD VAX/HAWK Ada Cross Compiler System, Version 2.1.3 
compiler using ACVC Version 1.10 was conducted on-site by a validation team 
from the AVF. The configuration in which the testing was performed is 
described by the following designations of hardware and software 
components: 


Host computer: 

Host operating system: 
Target computer: 

Target operating system: 
Compiler: 


Microvax/3500 

VAX/VMS, Version 5.1 

LRMSC-HAVK/32 

AOS/VS, Version 7.57 

TLD VAX/HAWK Ada Cross Compiler 

System, Version 2.1.3 


The host and target computers were linked via Ethernet-802. 

A magnetic tape containing all tests except for withdrawn tests and tests 
requiring unsupported floating-point precisions was taken on-site by the 
validation team for processing. Tests that make use of 
implementation-specific values were customized before being written to the 
magnetic tape. Tests requiring modifications during the prevalidation 
testing were included in their modified form on the magnetic tape. 

The contents of the magnetic tape were loaded directly onto the host 
computer. 


After the test files were loaded to disk, the full set of tests was 
compiled and linked on the Microvax/3500; then all executable images were 
transferred to the LRMSC-HAWK/32 via Ethernet-802 and run. Results were 
printed from the host computer. 


The compiler was tested using command scripts provided by TLD Systems, Ltd. 
and reviewed by the validation team. The compiler was tested using all the 
following option settings. See Appendix E for a complete listing of the 
compiler options for this implementation. The following list of compiler 
options includes those options vhich were invoked by default: 


3-7 







TEST INFORMATION 


No_checks = Exception Info Suppress generation of Debug string's 

in unrelocatable object code for unhandled 
exception 

No_Phase Suppress display of phase times during 

compilation 


Tests vere compiled, linked, and executed (as appropriate) using a single 
computer. Test output, compilation listings, and job logs vere captured on 
magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site by 
the validation team vere also archived.

APPENDIX B 

APPENDIX F OF TEE Ada STANDARD 


The only alloved implementation dependencies correspond to 
implementation-dependent pragmas, to certain machine-dependent conventions 
as mentioned in Chapter 13 of the Ada Standard, and to certain alloved 
restrictions on representation clauses. The implementation-dependent 
characteristics of the TLD VAX/HAWK Ada Cross Compiler System, Version 
2.1.3 compiler, as described in this Appendix, are provided by TLD Systems, 
Ltd. Unless specifically noted otherwise, references in this Appendix are 
to compiler documentation and not to this report. Implementation-specific 
portions of the package STANDARD, which are not a part of Appendix F, are: 


package STANDARD is 


• • • 

type INTEGER is range -2147483648 .. 2147483647; 
type SHORT_INTEGER is range -32768 .. 32767; 

type FLOAT is digits 6 range -2.26156E+74 .. 2.26156E+74; 
type L0NG_FL0AT is digits 15 

range -2.26156424291634E+74 .. 2.26156424291634E+74; 

type DURATION is delta 2.0**(-12) range -86400.0 .. 86400.0; 


end STANDARD; 


B-l 




The Ada language definition allows for certain machine_dependencies in a 
controlled manner. No machine-dependent syntax of semantic extensions or 
restrictions are allowed. The only allowed implementation-dependencies 
correspond to implementaton-dependent pragmas and attributes, certain 
machine-dependent conventions as mentioned in chapter 13, and certain allowed 
restrictions on representation clauses. 

The full definition of the implementation-dependent characteristics of the 
TLD VAX/HAWK target Ada Compiler System is presented in this Appendix F. 

Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 

The TLD ACS supports the following implementation dependent pragmas. 


Pragma Export (Language_name, Ada_entity_name, (String)); 

This pragma is a complement to Pragma Interface and instructs the compiler to 
make the entity named available for reference by a foreign language module. 
The language name identifies the language in which the foreign module is 
coded. The only foreign language presently supported is Assembly. Ada and 
JOVIAL are permitted and presently mean the same as Assembly but the 
semantics of their use are subject to redefinition by future releases of the 
compiler. If the optional third parameter is present, the string provides 
the name by which the entity may be referenced by the foreign module. The 
contents of this string must conform to the conventions for the indicated 
foreign language and the linker being used. No check is made by the compiler 
to insure that these conventions are obeyed. 

Only objects having static a'location and subprograms are supported by pragma 
Export. If the Ada entity viamed is a subprogram, this pragma must be placed 
within the declarative region of the named subprogram. If the name is that 
of an object, the pragma must be placed within the same declarative region 
and following the object declaration. It is the responsibility of the 
programmer to insure that the subprogram and object are elaborated before the 
reference is made. 


pragma If (Compile_Time_Expression); 
pragma Elsif (Compile_Time_Expression); 
pragma Else; 
pragma Endif; 

Thrse source directives may be used to enclose conditionally compiled source 
to enhance program portability and configuration adaptation. These 
directives may occur at the place that language defined pragmas, statements, 
or declarations may occur. Source code following these pragmas will be 
compiled or ignored similar to the semantics of the corresponding Ada 
statements depending upon whether the Compile_Time_Expression is true or 
false, respectively. The primary difference between these pragmas and the 


B-2 







corresponding Ada statements are that the pragmas may enclose declarations 
and other pragmas. 


Implementation-Dependent Attributes 
None. 


Representation Clause Restrictions 
Pragma Pack is not supported. 

Length clauses are not supported for ‘SIZE except when applied to task 
types. 

Length clauses are not supported for 'Storage_Size when applied to access 
types. 

Length clauses are supported for 'Storage_Size when applied to a task type 
and denote the number of words of stack to be allocated to the task. 

Length clauses are not supported for 'Small. 

Enumeration representation clauses are supported for value ranges of 
Integer'First to Integer'Last. 

Record representation clauses are supported to arrange record components 
within a record. Record components may not be specified to cross a word 
boundary unless they are arranged to encompass two or more whole words. A 
record component of type record that has itself been "rep specificationed" 
may only be allocated at bit 0. Bits are numbered from left to right with 
bit 0 indicating the sign bit. 

The alignment clause is not supported. 

Address clauses are supported for variable objects and designate the virtual 
address of the object. The TLD Ada Compiler System treats the address 
specification as a means to access objects allocated by ocher chan Ada means 
and accordingly does not treat Che clause as a request to allocate the object 
at the indicated address. 

Address clauses are not supported for constant objects, packages, casks, or 
task entries. 


B-3 






Address Clause Expressions 


Address expression values and type Address represent a location in logical 
memory (in the program's current address state). For objects, the address 
specifies a location within the logical address space. The 'Address 
attribute applied to a subprogram represents a 32 bit word address within the 
logical instruction space. 


Unchecked Conversion Restrictions 
None 

I/O Package Characteristics 

The following implementation-defined types are declared in Text_Io. 
subtype Count is integer range 0 .. 2_147_483_647; 
subtype Field is Integer range 0 .. 127;

LRM defined pragmas are recognized and processed as follows: 

Controlled -- Has no effect. 

Elaborate --As described in the LRM. 

Inline -- Not presently supported. 

Interface •• Supported as a means of importing foreign language 
components into the Ada Program Library. May be applied either to a 
subprogram declaration as being specially implemented, -- read Interface 
as Import --, or to an object that has been declared elsewhere. 
Interface languages supported are Assembly for calling assembly language 
routines; and MV_32 for defining built in instruction procedures. An 
optional third parameter is used to define a name other than the name of 
the Ada subprogram for interfacing with the linker. 

List --As defined in the LRM. 

Memory Size -- Has no effect.

Priority -- As defined in the LRM. Priority may range from 1 to 200. 
Default priority is 1. 

Shared --As defined in the LRM. May be applied to scalar objects only. 
Storage Unit -- Has no effect. 

Suppress -- As defined in the LRM for suppressing checks; all standard 
checks may be suppressed individually as well as "Exception_Info n and 
"All_Checks". Suppression of Exception_Info eliminates data used to 
provide symbolic debug information in the event of an unhandled 
exception. The All_Checks selection eliminates all checks with a single 
pragma. In addition to the pragma, the compiler permits control of 
check suppression by command line option without the necessity of source 
changes. 

System Name -- Has no effect. 

Number declarations are not assigned addresses and their names are not 
permitted as a prefix to the 'address attribute. (Clarification only). 

Objects are allocated by the compiler to occupy one or more 16 bit words. 
Only in the presence record representation clauses are objects allocated to 
less than a word. 

Except for access objects, uninitialized objects contain an undefined value. 
An attempt to reference the value of an uninitialized object is not detected. 

The maximum number of enumeration literals of all types is limited only by 
available symbol table space. 

The predefined integer types are: 

Short_Integer range -32_768 .. 32_767 and is implemented as a 16 bit 
value. 

Integer range -2_147_483_648 .. 2_147_483_647 and implemented a 32-bit 
value. 

Lon g lnteger is not supported. 

System.Min_Int is -2_147_483_648. 

System.Max_Int is 2_147_483_647. 

The predefined real types are: 

Float digits 6. 

Long_Float digits 15. 

Short_Float is not presently supported. 

System.Max_Digits is 15 digits. 


B-6 







Fixed point is implemented as 16-bit or 32-bit data as is appropriate for the 
range and delta. 

Index constraints as well as other address values such as access types are 
limited to 29 bits of value. 

The maximum array size is limited to the size of virtual address. 

The maximum String length is the same as for other arrays. 

Access objects are implemented as an unsigned 32 bit integer. The access 
literal Null is implementated as two words of zero. 

There is no limit on the number of dimensions of an array type. Array types 
are passed as parameters opposite unconstrained formal parameters using a 3 
word dope vector illustrated below: 


| Vord address of first element j 
j Low bound value of first dimension j 
j Upper bound value of first dimension | 


Additional dimension bounds follow immediately for arrays with more than one 
dimension. 

LRM Chapter 4. 

Machine_Overflows is True. 

Pragma Controlled has no effect since garbage collection is never performed. 
LRM Chapter 5. 

The maximum number of statements in an Ada source program is undefined and 
limited only by Symbol Table space. 

Case statements unless they are quite sparse, are allocated as indexed jump 
vectors and are, therefore, quite fast. 

Loop statements with a for implementation scheme are implemented most 
efficiently if the range is in reverse and down to zero. 

Data declared in block statements is elaborated as part of its containing 
scope.

LRM Chapter 6. 


Arrays, records and task types are passed by reference. 

Pragma Inline is not presently supported for subprograms. 

LRM Chapter 7. 

Package elaboration is performed dynamically permitting a warm restart 
without the necessity to reload the program. 

LRM Chapter 8. 

LRM Chapter 9. 

Task objects are implemented as access types pointing to a Task Information 
Block (TIB). 

Type Time in package Calendar is declared as a record containing two double 
precision integer values: the date in days and the real time clock. 

Pragma Priority is supported with a value of 1 to 200. 

Pragma Shared is supported for scalar objects. 

LRM Chapter 10. 

Multiple Ada Program Libraries are supported with each library containing an 
optional ancester library. The predefined packages are contained in the TLD 
standard library, MV.LIB. 

LRM Chapter 11. 

Exceptions are implemented by the TLD Ada Compiler System to take advantage 
of the normal policy in embedded computer system design to reserve 50% of the 
duty cycle. By executing a small number of instructions in the prologue of a 
procedure or block containing an exception handler, a branch may be taken, at 
the occurrence of an exception, directly to a handler rather than performing 
the time consuming code of unwinding procedure calls and stack frames. The 
philosophy taken is that an exception signals an exceptional condition, 
perhaps a serious one involving recovery or reconfiguration, and that quick 
response in this situation is more important and worth the small throughput 
tradeoff in a real time environment.

LRM Chapter 12. 


/ 


A single generic instance is generated for a generic body. Generic 
specifications and bodies need not be compiled together nor need a body be 
compiled prior to the compilation of an instantiation. Because of the single 
expansion, this implementation of generics tend to be more favorable of space 
savings. To achieve this tradeoff, the instantiations must by nature be more 
general and are, therefore, somewhat less efficient timewise. 

LRM Chapter 13. 

Representation clause support and restrictions are defined above. 

A comprehensive Machine_Code package is provided and supported. 

Unchecked_Deallocation and Unchecked_Conversion are supported. 

The implementation dependent attributes are all supported except 
'Storage_Size for an access type. 

LRM Chapter 14. 

Full file I/O operations are supported and interface to AOS/VS operations. 
Text__Io and Low_Level_lo are supported.

APPENDIX C 


TEST PARAMETERS 


Certain tests in the ACVC make use of implementation-dependent values, such 
as the maximum length of an input line and invalid file names. A test that 
makes use of such values is identified by the extension .TST in its file 
name. Actual values to be substituted are represented by names that begin 
vith a dollar sign. A value must be substituted for each of these names 
before the test is run. The values used for this validation are given 
belov.

APPENDIX D 


WITHDRAWN TESTS 


Some tests are withdrawn from the ACVC because they do not conform to the 
Ada Standard. The following 44 tests had been withdrawn at the time of 
validation testing for the reasons indicated. A reference of the form 
Al-ddddd is to an Ada Commentary. 


a. E28005C: This test expects that the string TOP OF PAGE. —63" of 
line 204 will appear at the top of the listing page due to a pragma 
PAGE in line 203; but line 203 contains text that follows the pragma, 
and it is this text that must appear at the top of the page. 

b. A39005G: This test unreasonably expects a component clause to pack an 
array component into a minimum size (line 30). 

c. B97102E: This test contains an unintended illegality: a select 
statement contains a null statement at the place of a selective wait 
alternative (line 31). 

d. C97116A: This test contains race conditions, and it assumes that 

guards are evaluated indivisibly. A conforming implementation may use 
interleaved execution in such a way that the evaluation of the guards 
at lines 50 & 54 and the execution of task CHANGING 0F_THE_GUARD 

results in a call to REPORT.FAILED at one of lines 52 or 56.~ 

e. BC3009B: This test wrongly expects that circular instantiations will 
be detected in several compilation units even though none of the units 
is illegal with respect to the units it depends on; by AI-00256, the 
illegality need not be detected until execution is attempted (line 
95). 

f. CD2A62D: This test wrongly requires that an array object's size be no 
greater than 10 although its subtype's size was specified to be 40 
(line 137). 


D-l 








WITHDRAWN TESTS 


g. CD2A63A..D, CD2A66A..D, CD2A73A..D, and CD2A76A..D (16 tests): These 

tests wrongly attempt to check the size of objects of a derived type 
(for which a 'SIZE length clause is given) by passing them to a 
derived subprogram (which implicitly converts them to the parent type 
(Ada standard 3.4:14)). Additionally, they use the 'SIZE length 
clause and attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic 
by the WG9 ARG. 

h. CD2A81G, CD2A83G, CD2A84M..N, and CD50110 (5 tests): These tests 

assume that dependent tasks will terminate while the main program 
executes a loop that simply tests for task termination; this is not 
the case, and the main program may loop indefinitely (lines 74, 85, 
86, 96, and 58, respectively). 

i. CD2B15C and CD7205C: These tests expect that a 'STORAGE_SIZE length 
clause provides precise control over the number of designated objects 
in a collection; the Ada standard 13.2:15 allows that such control 
must not be expected. 

j. CD2D11B: This test gives a SMALL representation clause for a derived 
fixed-point type (at line 30) that defines a set of model numbers that 
are not necessarily represented in the parent type; by Commentary 
AI-00099, all model numbers of a derived fixed-point type must be 
representable values of the parent type. 

k. CD5007B: This test wrongly expects an implicitly declared subprogram 
to be at the address that is specified for an unrelated subprogram 
(line 303). 

l. ED7004B, ED7005C..D, and ED7006C..D (5 tests): These tests check 
various aspects of the use of the three SYSTEM pragmas; the AV0 
withdraws these tests as being inappropriate for validation. 

m. CD7105A: This test requires that successive calls to CALENDAR.CLOCK 
change by at least SYSTEM.TICK; however, by Commentary AI-00201, it is 
only the expected frequency of change that must be at least 
SYSTEM.TICK—particular instances of change may be less (line 29). 

n. CD7203B and CD7204B: These tests use the 'SIZE length clause and 
attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic by the WG9 
ARG. 

o. CD7205D: This test checks an invalid test objective: it treats the 
specification of storage to be reserved for a task's activation as 
though it were like the specification of storage for a collection. 


D-2 







WITHDRAWN TESTS 


p. CE2107I: This test requires that objects of two similar scalar types 
be distinguished when read from a file—DATA_ERROR is expected to be 
raised by an attempt to read one object as of the other type. 
However, it is not clear exactly how the Ada standard 14.2.4:4 is to 
be interpreted; thus, this test objective is not considered valid 
(line 90). 

q. CE3111C: This test requires certain behavior, when two files are 
associated with the same external file, that is not required by the 
Ada standard. 

r. CE3301A: This test contains several calls to END_0F_LINE and 

END_0F_PAGE that have no parameter: these calls were intended to 
specify a file, not to refer to STANDARD_INPUT (lines 103, 107, 118, 
132, and 136). 

s. CE3411B: This test requires that a text file's column number be set to 
COUNT'LAST in order to check that LAY0UT_ERR0R is raised by a 
subsequent PUT operation. But the former operation will generally 
raise an exception due to a lack of available disk space, and the test 
would thus encumber validation testing.

COMPILER OPTIONS AS SUPPLIED BY TLD SYSTEMS, LTD. 


Compiler: TLD VAX/HAVK Ada Cross Compiler System, Version 2.1.3 

ACVC Version: 1.10 


E-l 




TLD Ada Compiler System 
ADA COMPILER REFERENCE DOCUMENT 


In all of the above examples, Che input file eesC.ada is compiled 
generating a relocatable object file named test.obj, a listing file 
named test.1st containing a summary of the option svltches, a source 
image and generated assembly listing and a cross reference listing. The ? 
Ada source code is interspersed with the generated assembly code in the 
listing file. No constraint checking code is generated. All address 

computations are performed in 1750A single precision fixed point 
arithmetic. A system cross reference file, eest.srf is also genersced. 7 


3.2 Compiler Recognized Names 


3.3 Compiler Option Switches 

Compiler option switches provide control over various processing and 
output features of the compiler. These features include several 
varieties of listing output, the level and kinds of optimizations 
desired, the choice of target computer, and the operation of the 
compiler in a syntax checking mode only. 

Keywords are used for selecting various compiler options. The 
complement keyword, if it exists, is used to disable a compiler option 
and is formed by prefixing the switch keyword with "no_". 

Switches may be abbreviated to the number of characters required to 
uniquely identify the switch. For example, the switch "elaborator" 
(explained In the list, below) may be uniquely identified by the 
abbreviation "el." Of course, the entire name maybe used. If an 
option is not specified by the user, a default setting is assumed. All 
specified compiler options apply eo a single invocation of the compiler. 

The default setting of a switch and its meaning are defined Ln the cable 
below. The meaning of the complement fora can be derived by 
complementing the meaning of the switch. For some switches, the 
complement meaning is not obvious; these complement switch keywords are 
listed separately. 

In the description of the switches, the target dependent name <target> 
is used. The value of this symbol is determined by the value of the 
target switch. 

Compiler generated file specifications generally conform to host 
conventions. For example: 

The generated file name is the source filename appended with Che default 
file suffix. If the ueer specifies an output file name, no default 
suffix is provided.

The TLD defined check_ldentifier exception_info is explained 
below. 

TLDada generates a string in the relocatable object code that 
is the full path name of the file being compiled. TLDada also 
generates extra instructions in the relocatable code that are 
used by the Run Time System to Inform the programmer where an 
unhandlsd exception is raised. The no_checks-«xeepcion_info 
switch will suppress both the string and exera instructions, 
whereas the pragma will only suppress the extra instructions.

derived from the name tld_lib_<targst>. See the target 
dependent compiler sections for furthsr explanations of this 

name. 

oaxerrors-n 

maxerrors-500 * - default 

The maxerrors switch assigns a value limit to the number of 
errors forcing Job termination. Once this veiue is exceeded, 
the compilation is terminated. Information*level diagnostic 
messages ere not included in the count of errors forcing 
termination. The specified value's range is from 0 to 500.

1750A target 

TLSada produces code for any Implementation that conforms to 
MIL-STD-1750A. The model switch informs TLDada that a special 
model of the MIL*STD-1750A is the eargat computer. MODEL also 
is used to Inform the compiler of 1750A implementations with 
special Built*Xn-Functions (BIFs). Models and the special 
features that characterize them are listed below. 

mdc281 

This switch allows ehe compiler to make use of the 7 
standard mdc281 BIF that produces a 64-bit integer 7 

multiply result. In addition, the ndc281 chip set ? 

has a known bug associated with FNEC and FABS in a 
boundary condition. Use of this switch results in 
generated code that avoids the problem, although the 
generated eoda is less efficient. 

standard 

All other Implementations of MXL*STD-1750A ars 
supported by the default value of the model switch. 

object( object>file-spec) 
object •• default 
no_object 


The object switch produces s relocatable object file. The 
default file suffix is VobJ". 

opt default 
no_opt 

The opt switch enables regional optimization on the compiled 
code. 

parm 

nojpant •• default 

The perm switch causes all option switches governing the 
compilation, Including the defaulted option switches, to be 
included in the listing file. The list option must also be 
selected or perm will have no effect. User specified switches 
are preceded in the listing file by a leading asterisk (*).

pcross 7 

no_pcross -- default ? 

7 

The pcross switch selects a procedure call cross reference 7 

listing. 7 


phase -- default 
no_phase 

The no_phase switch suppresses displaying phase times during 
compilation. 

reformed reformat*file-spec) 
no_reformat -- default 

The reformat switch causes TLDade to reformat the source 
listing in the listing file and, if a reformat-file-spec is 
present, to generate a reformatted source file. The default 
suffix of Che new source file is ".rfm." 


skip ((latter...)) 7 

no skip -- default 7 

7 

The skip switch permits the selective skipping of source code 7 

enclosed within (begin-lend directives. This option functions 7 

as if a (skip directive for each of the corresponding 7 

letter(a) had occurred at the beginning of the source program 7 

and if no letter is specified, exactly as if a (skip directive 7 

without any letter had occurred as the start of the sourcs 7 

program, i.e., ail (begin-lend enclosed source will be 7 

skipped. Tills option permits conditional compilation without 7 

changing Che source file. ? 

sourcs -- default 7 

no source ? 

7 

The source switch causes the input source program to be ? 

Included in Che listing file. Diagnostic messages, unless 7 


otherwise suppressed, are always included in the listing file. 7 
sti (-sti-file-spec) 7 

no sti -- default ? 

7 

The sti switch generates e software tools Interface file. The 7 


sti-file-spec can be completely or partially specified. If 7 
only tha sti file name is specified, the default sti file 7 
type, ".sti", is used to form the sti-file-spec. If only the 7 
file type is specified, the file name of the input*file-spec 7 
is used to form the sti-file-spec. If no sti-file-spec Is 7 
Specified, the sti file name is formed from the file name of ? 
the input-file-spec and the default sti file type, ".sti". 7

The sysref switch generates an external name cross'reference ? 

file. This file consists of all external names referenced in 7 
Che source program with the modules which refer to that ? 

external name, The default file suffix is SRF. 7 


table_picture 7
