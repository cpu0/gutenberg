Lift off the printer cover. 




3 Gently turn the paper roller 
toward you until the paper 
appears. Make sure that the paper 
slides under the two brass pinch 
rollers as it turns. Unless the paper 
is under the pinch rollers, it won't 
feed properly during operation. 



2 Lift the paper holder out of its 
slots and place a roll of paper 
on the paper holder. Place the roll 
of paper behind the printer before 
loading. Trim the leading edge of 
the paper so that it's clean and 
straight. Make sure the paper roll 
is oriented so the paper feeds from 
the bottom of the roll. 





Feed the leading edge of the 
paper into the metal slot at the bot- 
tom of the paper well.

Lift off the printer cover. 



2 Press the POWER button to 
turn on the printer. The 
Power-On light comes on and the 
printer automatically begins the 
motions of printing a test pattern. 




3 When the test pattern opera- 
tion has stopped, press the 
CHANGE PEN button. (Note that if 
the PEN button is held down for 
longer than three seconds, the pen 
carriage returns to the HOME posi- 
tion and prints the four-square test 
pattern.) The pen carriage moves 
to the CHANGE PEN position. 



4 The silver wheel at the end of 
the pen carriage next to the 
paper indicates which color pen to 
insert in each pen slot. Remove the 
protective cap from the pen and 
gently slide it into the carriage slot 
until it snaps into place. Be sure 
that the tip of the pen is inserted in 
the hole in the silver wheel. 




5 When the first pen is in place, 
press the COLOR button on 
the printer. The pen carriage 
returns to the HOME position and 
rotates to the next pen slot, then 
moves back to the CHANGE PEN 
position. Insert the next color pen 
as indicated on the silver wheel

Repeat the procedure until all 
the pens are loaded. 

7 After you've finished loading 
all the pens, press the PAPER 
button to return the pen carriage to 
the HOME position. 




a Press the POWER button to 
turn off the printer, then press 
it again to turn the power back on. 
The printer will print the test pat- 
tern. If the pens are loaded pro- 
perly, the printer will draw four 
squares, one for each color. 




Each time you turn on your printer, 
it automatically prints a test pattern 
consisting of four squares, one for 
each of the four pens. The purpose 
of the test pattern is to determine 
that the printer is working correct- 
ly, and to show the condition of 
each of the pens. If you find that 
any color ink is faded, it's time to 
replace that pen as described 
below. 



ILift off the printer cover and 
press the POWER button to 
turn on the printer. The Power-On 
light comes on." 

2 Press the CHANGE PEN but- 
ton on your printer. The pen 
carriage moves to the CHANGE 
PEN position. (Note that if the PEN 
button is held down for longer than 
three seconds, the pen carriage 
returns to the HOME position and 
prints the four-square test pattern.) 
Press the CHANGE COLOR button 
to rotate the pen carriage to the 
color pen that needs to be 
changed. 



3 Gently pull the knurled white 
plastic pen change lever 
toward you. The pen in the slot 
pops up. Remove the old pen and 
replace it with a new one by gently 
snapping it into the pen slot. 







When the new pen 
has been inserted, 
press the COLOR button 
to rotate the pen car- 
riage to any other pen that 
needs to be changed, and repeat 
step 3.

ing the pens, press the PAPER 
button to return the pen carriage 
to the HOME position and resume 
normal operation. 





The ATARI 1020 Color Printer can 
perform 13 different operations, 
some in the TEXT mode and some 
in the GRAPHICS mode. You can 
try your hand at computer art or 
create tables, charts or diagrams 
for those important reports. 
Highlight those same reports with 
headings or labels printed in any 
of 64 different sizes. Or draw X 
and Y axes with scale marks for 
easily readable graphs. 



Before trying these operations, be 
sure to: 



i 



Turn on your television.

The ATARI 1020 Color Printer 
works in two modes, a TEXT mode 
and a GRAPHICS mode. 

Before you can carry out any opera- 
tions with the printer, you have to 
command your computer to "open" 
the printing device. To open the 
printer, type: 

OPEN #(and a value from 1 
to 7),8,0,"P:" 

You can enter any value from 1 to 
7 after the number symbol (#), but 
the value must be consistent 
throughout all the commands that 
you enter for any single program. 
For the purposes of explanation, 
this guide uses the value 2 in all 
sample operations commands 
discussed. After you've opened 
the printer, enter the GRAPHICS 
mode by typing: 

PR .#;" ESC ESC CTRL G 

(For CTRL G, press CTRL while 
typing G.) 

Programmer Note: If you PRINT a 
LIST of commands for a program 
you've created, the GRAPHICS 
mode sequence will be printed 
like this: 

PR.#2;" " 

To return to the TEXT mode from 
the GRAPHICS mode, type: 

PR.#2; ,, A M 



Your ATARI 1020 Color Printer 
allows you to print in 20, 40, and 80 
character-per-column widths. Dif- 
ferent character widths can be 
used for labeling and distinguish- 
ing among different types of data 
or parts of diagrams. 

Unless you specify the width you 
want, the printer will automatically 
print text in 40 characters per 
column. 

To have the printer type 20- 
characters per column, type: 

PR.#2;"ESC ESC CTRL P" 

(For CTRL P, press CTRL while 
typing P.) 

To change to 80 characters per 
column, feature type: 

PR.#2;"ESC ESC CTRL S" 

(For CTRL S, press CTRL while 
typing S.) 

To return to 40 characters per col- 
umn, type: 



PR .#2; "ESC ESC CTRL NT 

(For CTRL N, press CTRL while 
typing N.) 



You can print characters in 64 dif- 
ferent sizes with the SET SCALE 
operation. To carry out the SET 
SCALE operation, first enter the 
GRAPHICS mode; then type: 

PR.#2,"S(and a value from 
Oto 63)" 



Finally, return to the TEXT mode. 
Any text you enter will be printed 
in the scale you chose. 




2® L 







In general, the characters you type 
on the computer keyboard are 
what your ATARI 1027 prints. 
There are exceptions, however, 
that allow you to print useful 
characters that are not on the 
keyboard. 

When using BASIC, you may print 
international characters by enter- 
ing this short program: 

10 OPEN #2,8,0,"P: M 
20 PR.#2;"ESC ESC CTRL W" 

To stop printing international 
characters while you're in 
BASIC, type: 

PR.#2;*'ESC ESC CTRL X" 




The pen carriage will return to the 
HOME position when you type: 

PR.#2;"H" 

The command that tells the printer 
to change the color of the pen to 
be used is: 

PR.#2;"C(and a value from 
0 to 3)" 

These commands are useful when 
you're writing a program that uses 
a combination of the printer's 
capabilities. 



Your 1020 Color Printer will 
draw either solid lines or dotted 
lines; the dots can be of various 
lengths. This operation can be par- 
ticularly useful in printing mechani- 
cal drawings or geometric figures. 
Unless you tell the printer to draw 
a dotted line, it will automatically 
draw a solid one. To have the 
printer make a dotted line, type: 

PR.#2;"L(and a value from 1 
to 15)" 

To return to printing a solid line, 
type: 

PR.#2;"LO 




Given this command, your printer 
will draw a line (solid or dotted) 
from the coordinates 0,0 to any 
values you enter for X and Y. You 
can make clear, precise charts, 
tables or graphs with this opera- 
tion. Combine it with other opera- 
tions to make interesting graphic 
patterns. 

The values for X can be from 0 to 
480; the values for Y can be from 
-999 to 999. The command for the 
DRAW operation is: 

PR.#2;"DX,Y" 

By entering a string of several 
X,Y values for a DRAW com- 
mand (or any other GRAPHICS 
mode command), you can 
have the printer execute a 
number of operations con- 
secutively. For example: 

PR.#2;"DX,Y;X,Y;X,Y;X,Y;" 

When you enter several 
different commands to- 
gether in a string, you 
must type an asterisk (*) 
between successive com- 
mands. For example: 



To initialize the printer— that is, to 
tell it to regard the current position 
of the pen as the coordinates 0,0 in 
carrying out subsequent opera- 
tions—type: 



PR.#2;'T' 



Like a DRAW operation preceded 
by an INITIALIZE command, the 
RELATIVE DRAW operation 
begins from the current position of 
the pen. To carry out the 
RELATIVE DRAW operation, type: 



PR.#2;"JX,Y" 




The MOVE command is similar to 
the DRAW command, except that 
the pen is raised while the pen 
carriage travels to the X and Y 
coordinates that you specify. To 
command the printer to MOVE, 
type: 

PR.#2:"MX.Y" 



RELATIVE MOVE acts in the same 
way as RELATIVE DRAW, except 
that the pen is raised while travel- 
ing to the new coordinates. To 
carry out the RELATIVE MOVE 
operation, type: 

PR.#2;"RX,Y" 

By using a number of commands 
together, you can have the printer 
move to various positions on the 
paper and draw horizontal, vertical 
and curved lines or text characters. 



This operation lets you draw X and 
Y axes; it also lets you determine 
where scale marks should be 
printed along the axes and the 
distance between scale marks. For 
example: 

PR.#2; ,,,, X2,11,53" 

l — specifies the 
number of scale 
marks 

specifies the 

distance between 
scale marks 



To print the Y axis only, type the 
number 0 after the X command 
character. Any number other than 
0 will tell the printer to print the X 
axis. For example, the command 
PR.#2;"X0,50,10" will print the Y 
axis with the specified scale 
marks. 

The X and Y axis commands must 
be entered on separate lines. 



specifies the 
X axis 




■ 

■ ■ ■ 




The ATARI 1020 Color Printer can 
print text characters in four dif- 
ferent directions— a handy option 
for clearly labeling different axes 
or areas on your charts or graphs. 
To carry out this operation, type: 

PR.#2;"Q(and a value from 
0to3) M 

Then enter the text you would 
like to have printed like this: 

PR.#2;"P(and any text)" 

The P command after the quo- 
tation marks tells the printer 
to print alphanumeric char- 
acters in the GRAPHICS 
mode. Your text will be 
printed in the direction that 
corresponds to the value 
you selected.

Here's a list of procedures to 
follow should you have problems 
using your printer. For help with 
other problems or questions, you 
can call ATARI Customer Service 
toll-free at (800) 538-8543 ((800) 
672-1404 in California). 

OWhat should I do if my printer 
doesn't automatically run the 
four-square test pattern when 
turned on? 

Mk i Check to see if the Power-On 
m^k light is lit, Then check to see 
if the power cord is plugged 
securely into both the wall socket 
and the printer. 



Q 



The printing is coming out 
light and fuzzy. What's wrong? 

A The pens probably need 
changing. Refer to the 
CHANGING THE PENS section in 
this guide. 

I want to print some large 
scaled letters. Why, when I 

enter the command PR.#2;"S45" r 

does the printer type S45? 

A You're still operating in the 
TEXT mode. You must go into 
the GRAPHICS mode, then enter 
the SET SCALE command. After 
you've done this, type PR.#2;"A M 
to return to the TEXT mode. Your 
text will now be printed in the size 
you select. 



4% I entered this DRAW com- 
Idf mand in the GRAPHICS 

mode: 

PR.#2;"D240,240:M0,0:D50,280" 

Why did the printer draw the first 
command and ignore the rest? 

A You can enter a string 
of commands using different 
features only by separating suc- 
cessive commands with an asterisk 
(*)• Type: 

PR. #2; ,, D240,240*M0,0*D50,280" 

Now the printer will execute the 
three commands consecutively.
