INTRODUCTION 


' This Validation Summary Report -iySR\T^ describes the extent to which a 
specific Ada compiler conforms to the Ada Standard, ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A. 
This report explains all technical terms used within it and thoroughly 
reports the results of test ing this compiler using the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability ,(ACVG)^ An Ada compiler must be implemented 
according to the Ada Standard, and any implementation-dependent features 
must conform to the requirements of the Ada Standard. The Ada Standard 
must be implemented in its entirety, and nothing can be implemented that is 
not in the Standard. 


Even though all validated Ada compilers conform to the Ada Standard, it 
must be understood that some differences do exist between implementations. 
The Ada Standard permits some implementation dependencies—for example, the 
maximum length of identifiers or the maximum values of integer types. 
Other differences between compilers result from the characteristics of 
particular operating systems, hardware, or implementation strategies. All 
the dependencies observed during the process of testing this compiler are 
given in this report. 


The information in this report is derived from the test results produced 
during validation testing. The validation process includes submitting a 
suite of standardized tests, the ACVC, as inputs to an Ada compiler and 
evaluating the results. The purpose of validating is to ensure conformity 
of the compiler to the Ada Standard by testing that the compiler properly 
implements legal language constructs and that it identifies and rejects 
illegal language constructs. The testing also identifies behavior that is 
implementation-dependent but is permitted by the Ada Standard. Six classes 
of tests are used. These tests are designed to perform checks at compile 
time, at link time, and during execution.

INTRODUCTION 


1.1 PURPOSE OF THIS VALIDATION SUMMARY REPORT 


This VSR documents the results of the validation testing performed on an 
Ada compiler. Testing vas carried out for the following purposes: 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs supported by the 
compiler that do not conform to the Ada Standard 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs not supported by 
the compiler but required by the Ada Standard 

. To determine that the implementation-dependent behavior is allowed 
by the Ada Standard 

Testing of this compiler was conducted by SofTech, Inc. under the 
direction of the AVF according to procedures established by the Ada Joint 
Program Office and administered by the Ada Validation Organization (AVO). 
On-site testing was completed 30 January 1990 at Irvine CA.

INTRODUCTION 


An ACVC test for which the compiler generates a result that 
demonstrates nonconformity to the Ada Standard. 

The computer on which the compiler resides. 

An ACVC test that uses features of the language that a 
compiler is not required to support or may legitimately 
support in a way other than the one expected by the test. 

An ACVC test for which a compiler generates the expected 
result. 

The computer for which a compiler generates code. 

A program that checks a compiler's conformity regarding a 
particular feature or a combination of features to the Ada 
Standard. In the context of this report, the term is used to 
designate a single test, which may comprise one or more 
files. 

An ACVC test found to be incorrect and not used to check 
conformity to the Ada Standard. A test may be incorrect 
because it has an invalid test objective, fails to meet its 
test objective, or contains illegal or erroneous use of the 
language. 


1.5 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conformity to the Ada Standard is measured using the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains both legal and illegal Ada programs structured into six test 
classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies 
the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable, 
and special program units are used to report their results during 
execution. Class B tests are expected to produce compilation errors. 
Class L tests are expected to produce compilation or link errors because of 
the vay in which a program library is used at link time. 

Class A tests ensure the successful compilation of legal Ada programs with 
certain language constructs which cannot be verified at compile time. 
There are no explicit program components in a Class A test to check 
semantics. For example, a Class A test checks that reserved words of 
another language (other than those already reserved in the Ada language) 
are not treated as reserved words by an Ada compiler. A Class A test is 
passed if no errors are detected at compile time and the program executes 
to produce a PASSED message. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests arc not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that every syntax or 
semantic error in the test is detected. A Class B test is passed if every 
illegal construct that it contains is detected by the compiler.

INTRODUCTION 


Class C tests check the run time system to ensure that legal Ada programs 
can be correctly compiled and executed. Each Class C test is self-checking 
and produces a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result when it is executed. 


Class D tests check the compilation and execution capacities of a compiler. 
Since there are no capacity requirements placed on a compiler by the Ada 
Standard for some parameters—for example, the number of identifiers 
permitted in a compilation or the number of units in a library—a compiler 
may refuse to compile a Class D test and still be a conforming compiler. 
Therefore, if a Class D test fails to compile because the capacity of the 
compiler is exceeded, the test is classified as inapplicable. If a Class D 
test compiles successfully, it is self-checking and produces a PASSED or 
FAILED message during execution. 


Class E tests are expected to execute successfully and check 
implementation-dependent options and resolutions of ambiguities in the Ada 
Standard. Each Class E test is self-checking and produces a NOT 
APPLICABLE, PASSED, or FAILED message when it is compiled and executed. 
However, the Ada Standard permits an implementation to reject programs 
containing some features addressed by Class E tests during compilation. 
Therefore, a Class E test is passed by a compiler if it is compiled 
successfully and executes to produce a PASSED message, or if it is rejected 
by the compiler for an allowable reason. 


Class L tests check that incomplete or illegal Ada programs involving 
multiple, separately compiled units are detected and not allowed to 
execute. Class L tests are compiled separately and execution is attempted. 
A Class L test passes if it is rejected at link time—that is, an attempt 
to execute the main prograin must generate an error message before any 
declarations in t-he main program or any units referenced by the main 
program are elaborated. In some cases, an implementation may legitimately 
detect errors during compilation of the test. 


Two library units, the package REPORT and the procedure CHECK_FILE, support 
the self-checking features of the executable tests. The package REPORT 
provides the mechanism by which executable tests report PASSED, FAILED, or 
NOT APPLICABLE results. It also provides a set of identity functions used 
to defeat some compiler optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that 
would circumvent a test objective. The procedure CHECK FILE is used to 
check the contents of text files written by some of the Class C tests for 
chapter 14 of the Ada Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. These tests produce messages that 
are examined to verify that the units are operating correctly. If these 
units are not operating correctly, then the validation is not attempted. 


The text of each test in the ACVC follows conventions that are intended to 
ensure that the tests are reasonably portable without modification. For 
example, the tests make use of only the basic set of 55 characters, contain 
lines with a maximum length of 72 characters, use small numeric values, and 
place features that may not be supported by all implementations in separate 
tests. However, some tests contain values that require the test to be

INTRODUCTION 


customized according to implementation-specific values—for example, an 
illegal file name. A list of the values used for this validation is 
provided in Appendix C. 

A compiler must correctly process each of the tests in the suite and 
demonstrate conformity to the Ada Standard by either meeting the pass 
criteria given for the test or by showing that the test is inapplicable to 
the implementation. The applicability of a test to an implementation is 
considered each time the implementation is validated. A test that is 
inapplicable for one validation is not necessarily inapplicable for a 
subsequent validation. Any test that was determined to contain an illegal 
language construct or an erroneous language construct is withdrawn from the 
ACVC and, therefore, is not used in testing a compiler. The tests 
withdrawn at the time of this validation are given in Appendix D.

CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


2.2 IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS 

One of the purposes of validating compilers is to determine the behavior of 
a compiler in those areas of the Ada Standard that permit implementations 
to differ. Class D and E tests specifically check for such implementation 
differences. However, tests in other classes also characterize an 
implementation. The tests demonstrate the following characteristics: 


a. Capacities. 


(1) The compiler correctly processes a compilation containing 723 
variables in the same declarative part. (See test D29002K.) 

(2) The compiler correctly processes tests containing loop 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See tests D55A03A..H (8 
tests).) 

(3) The compiler correctly processes tests containing block 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See test D56001B.) 

(4) The compiler correctly processes tests containing recursive 
procedures separately compiled as subunits nested to 10 
levels. (See tests D64005E..G (3 tests).) 


b. Predefined types. 

(1) This implementation supports the additional predefined types 
SH0RT_INTEGER and BYTE_INTEGER in package STANDARD. (See 
tests B86001T..Z (7 tests).) 


c. Expression evaluation. 

The order in which expressions are evaluated and the time at which 
constraints are checked are not defined by the language. Uhile 
the ACVC tests do not specifically attempt to determine the order 
of evaluation of expressions, test results indicate the following: 

(1) None of the default initialization expressions for record 
components are evaluated before any value is checked for 
membership in a component's subtype. (See test C32117A.) 

(2) Assignments for subtypes are performed with the same precision 
as the base type. (See test C35712B.) 

(3) This implementation uses no extra bits for extra precision and 
uses all extra bits for extra range. (See test C35903A.) 


2-2 





CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(4) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when an integer literal operand in a 
comparison or membership test is outside the range of the base 
type. (See test C45232A.) 

(5) No exception is raised when a literal operand in a fixed-point 
comparison or membership test is outside the range of the base 
type. (See test C45252A.) 

(6) Underflow is gradual. (See tests C45524A..Z (26 tests).) 


d. Rounding. 

The method by which values are rounded in type conversions is not 
defined by the language. Vhile the ACVC tests do not specifically 
attempt to determine the method of rounding, the test results 
indicate the following: 

(1) The method used for rounding to integer is round to even. 
(See tests C46012A..Z (26 tests).) 

(2) The method used for rounding to longest integer is round to 
even. (See tests C46012A..Z (26 tests).) 

(3) The method used for rounding to integer in static universal 
real expressions is round away from zero. (See test C4A014A.) 


e. Array types. 

An implementation is allowed to raise NUMERIC_ERROR or 

CONSTRAINT_ERROR for an array having a 'LENGTH that exceeds 

STANDARD.INTEGER'LAST and/or SYSTEM.MAX_INT. 

For this implementation: 

(1) Declaration of an array type or subtype declaration with more 
than SYSTEM.MAXJCNT components raises no exception. (See test 
C36003A.) 

(2) NUMERIC ERROR is raised when 'LENGTH is applied to an array 

type with INTEGER'LAST + 2 components with each component 

being a null array. (See test C36202A.) 

(3) NUMERIC ERROR is raised when 'LENGTH is applied to an array 
type with SYSTEM.MAX INT + 2 components with each component 
being a null array. (See test C36202B.) 

(4) A packed BOOLEAN array having a 'LENGTH exceeding INTEGER'LAST 
raises NUMERIC ERROR when the array objects are declared. 
(See test C52103X.) 


2-3 






CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(5) A packed two-dimensional BOOLEAN array with more than 
INTEGER'LAST components raises NUMERIC ERROR when the array 
objects are declared. (See test C52104Y.J 

(6) A null array with one dimension of length greater than 
INTEGER'LAST may raise NUMERIC_ERR0R or CONSTRAINT_ERROR 
either when declared or assigned. Alternatively, an 
implementation may accept the declaration. However, lengths 
must match in array slice assignments. This implementation 
raises NUMERIC_ERR0R when the array type is declared. (See 
test E52103Y.) 

(7) In assigning one-dimensional array types, the expression is 
evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

(8) In assigning two-dimensional array types, the expression is 
evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


f. Discriminated types. 

(1) In assigning record types with discriminants, the expression 
is evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


g. Aggregates. 

(1) In the evaluation of a multi-dimensional aggregate, all 
choices are evaluated before checking against the index type. 
(See tests C43207A and C43207B.) 

(2) In the evaluation of an aggregate containing subaggregates, 
not all choices are evaluated before being checked for 
identical bounds. (See test E43212B.) 

(3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised before all choices are evaluated 
when a bound in a non-null range of a non-null aggregate does 
not belong to an index subtype. (See test E43211B.) 


h. Pragmas. 

(1) The pragma INLINE is not supported for functions or 
procedures. (See tests LA3004A..B (2 tests), EA3004C..D (2 
tests), and CA3004E..F (2 tests).) 


2-4 





CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


i. Generics. 

(1) Generic unit declarations, bodies, and subunits can be 

compiled in separate compilations. (See tests CA1012A and 

CA3011A.) 

(2) If a generic unit body or one of its subunits is compiled or 
recompiled after the generic unit is instantiated, the unit 
instantiating the generic is made obsolete. The obsolesence 
is recognized at binding time, and the binding is stopped. 
(See tests CA2009C, CA2009F, BC3204C, and BC3205D.) 


j. Input and output. 

(1) The package SEQUENTIAL_IO cannot be instantiated with 
unconstrained array types or record types with discriminants 
without defaults. (See tests AE2101C, EE2201D, and EE2201E.) 

(2) The package DIRECT_IO cannot be instantiated with 
unconstrained array types or record types with discriminants 
without defaults. (See tests AE2101H, EE2401D, and EE2401G.) 

(3) Modes IN_FILE and OUT FILE are supported for SEQUENTIAL_IO. 
(See tests CE2102D..E (2”tests), CE2102N, and CE2102P.) 

(4) Modes IN_FILE, OUT FILE, and INOUT_FILE are supported for 
DIRECT 10. (See tests CE2102F, CE2102I..J (2 tests), CE2102R, 
CE2102T, and CE2102V.) 

(5) Modes IN FILE and OUT FILE are supported for text files. (See 
tests CE3102E and CE3T02I..K (3 tests).) 

(6) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for SEQUENTIAL_IO. 
(See tests CE2102G and CE2102X.) 

(7) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for DIRECT_I0. (See 
tests CE2102K and CE21027.) 

(8) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for text files. 
(See tests CE3102F..G (2 tests), CE3104C, CE3110A, and 
CE3114A.) 

(9) Overwriting to a sequential file does not truncate the file. 
(See test CE2208B.) 

(10) Temporary sequential files are given names and deleted when 
closed. (See test CE2108A.) 

(11) Temporary direct files are given names and deleted when 
closed. (See test CE2108C.) 


2-5 





CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(12) Temporary text files are given names and deleted when closed. 
(See test CE3112A.) 

(13) More than one internal file can be associated with each 

external file for sequential files when reading only. (See 
tests CE2107A..E (5 tests), CE2102L, CE2110B, and CE2111D.) 

(14) More than one internal file can be associated with each 

external file for direct files when reading only. (See tests 
CE2107F..H (3 tests), CE2110D, and CE2111H.) 

(15) More than one internal file can be associated vith each 

external file for text files when reading only. (See tests 
CE3111A..E (5 tests), CE3114B, and CE3115A.)

TEST INFORMATION 


3.1 TEST RESULTS 

Version 1.10 o£ the ACVC comprises 3717 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, 44 tests had been withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF 
determined that 286 tests were inapplicable to this implementation. All 
inapplicable tests were processed during validation testing except for 201 
executable tests that use floating-point precision exceeding that supported 
by the implementation. Modifications to the code, processing, or grading 
for 4 tests were required to successfully demonstrate the test objective. 

The AVF concludes that the testing results demonstrate acceptable 
conformity to the Ada Standard.

3.5 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

Some tests do not apply to all compilers because they make use of features 
that a compiler is not required by the Ada Standard to support. Others may 
depend on the result of another test that is either inapplicable or 
withdrawn. The applicability of a test to an implementation is considered 
each time a validation is attempted. A test that is inapplicable for one 
validation attempt is not necessarily inapplicable for a subsequent 
attempt. For this validation attempt, 286 tests were inapplicable for the 
reasons indicated: 


a. The following 201 tests are not applicable because they have 
floating-point type declarations requiring more digits than 
SYSTEM.MAX DIGITS: 


C24113L..Y (14 tests) 
C35706L..Y (14 tests) 
C35708L..Y (14 tests)

C35705L..Y (14 tests) 
C35707L..Y (14 tests) 
C35802L..Z (15 tests)

C45641L..Y (14 tests) C46012L..Z (15 tests) 

b. C35702A and B86001T are not applicable because this implementation 
supports no predefined type SHORT_FLOAT. 

c. C35702B and B86001U are not applicable because this implementation 
supports no predefined type L0NG_FL0AT. 

d. The following 16 tests are not applicable because this 
implementation does not support a predefined type LONG_INTEGER: 


C45231C 

C45304C 

C45502C

e. C45531M..P (4 

tests) and 

C45532M..P (4 tests) 

are not applicable 


because the value of SYSTEM.MAX^MANTISSA is less than 48. 

f. D64005G is not applicable because this implementation does not 
support nesting 17 levels of recursive procedure calls. 

g. C86001F is not applicable because, for this implementation, the 
package TEXT_IO is dependent upon package SYSTEM. This test 
recompiles package SYSTEM, making package TEXT_IO, and hence 
package REPORT, obsolete. 

h. B86001Y is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined fixed-point type other than DURATION. 

i. B86001Z is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined floating-point type with a name other than FLOAT, 
LONG_FLOAT, or SHORT_FLOAT. 

j. CA2009C, CA2009F, BC3204C, and BC3205D are not applicable because 

this implementation does not support separate compilation of 
generic specifications, bodies, or subunits, if an instantiation 
is given before compilation of its bodies or subunits. The 
created dependency is detected at bind time. 

k. LA3004A, LA3004B, EA3004C, EA3004D, CA3004E, and CA3004F are not 

applicable because this implementation does not support pragma 
INLINE. 

l. AE2101C and EE2201D..E (2 tests) use instantiations of package 

SEQUENTIAL_IO with unconstrained array types and record types with 
discriminants without defaults. These instantiations are rejected 
by this compiler.

TEST INFORMATION 


m. AE2101H, EE2401D, and EE2401G use instantiations of package 

DIRECT_I0 with unconstrained array types and record types with 
discriminants without defaults. These instantiations are rejected 
by this compiler. 

n. CE2102D is inapplicable because this implementation supports 

CREATE with IN_FILE mode for SEQUENTIAL_IO.

ag. CE3102J is inapplicable because this implementation supports OPEN 
vith IN_FILE mode for text files. 

ah. CE3102K is inapplicable because this implementation supports OPEN 
with OUT_FILE mode for text files. 

ai. CE2107B..E (4 tests), CE2107L, and CE2110B are not applicable 

because multiple internal files cannot be associated with the same 
external file when one or more files is writing for sequential 
files. The proper exception is raised when multiple access is 
attempted. 

aj. CE2107G..H (2 tests), CE2110D, CE2111D, and CE2111H are not 
applicable because multiple internal files cannot be associated 
with the same external file when one or more files is writing for 
direct files. The proper exception is raised when multiple access 
is attempted. 

ak. CE3111B, CE3111D..E (2 tests), CE3114B, and CE3115A are not 
applicable because multiple internal files cannot be associated 
with the same external file when one or more files is writing for 
text files. The proper exception is raised when multiple access 
is attempted. 


3.6 TEST, PROCESSING, AND EVALUATION MODIFICATIONS 

It is expected that some tests will require modifications of code, 
processing, or evaluation in order to compensate for legitimate 
implementation behavior. Modifications are made by the AVF in cases where 
legitimate implementation behavior prevents the successful completion of an 
(otherwise) applicable test. Examples of such modifications include: 
adding a length clause to alter the default size of a collection; splitting 
a Class B test into subtests so that all errors are detected; and 
confirming that messages produced by an executable test demonstrate 
conforming behavior that wasn't anticipated by the test (such as raising 
one exception instead of another). 

Modifications were required for 4 tests. 


3-5 



TEST INFORMATION 


The following tests were split because syntax errors at one point resulted 
in the compiler not detecting other errors in the test:

3.7 ADDITIONAL TESTING INFORMATION 


3.7.1 Prevalidation 

Prior to validation, a set of test results for ACVC Version 1.10 produced 
by the AdaVantage, Version 4.0 compiler was submitted to the AVF by the 
applicant for review. Analysis of these results demonstrated that the 
compiler successfully passed all applicable tests, and the compiler 
exhibited the expected behavior on all inapplicable tests. 


3.7.2 Test Method 


Testing of the AdaVantage, Version 4.0 compiler using ACVC Version 1.10 was 
conducted on-site by a validation team from the AVF. The configuration in 
which the testing was performed is described by the following designations 
of hardware and software components: 


Host computer: 

Host operating system: 
Target computer: 

Target operating system 
Compiler: 


Apple Macintosh SE 30 
System 6.0.3 
Apple Macintosh SE 30 
System 6.0.3 
AdaVantage, Version 4.0 


A set of diskettes containing all tests except for withdrawn tests and 
tests requiring unsupported floating-point precisions was taken on-site by 
the validation team for processing. Tests that make use of 
implementation-specific values were customized before being written to the 
diskettes. Tests requiring modifications during the prevalidation testing 
were included in their modified form on the diskettes. 


The contents of the diskettes were loaded directly onto the host computer. 

After the test files were loaded to disk, the full set of tests was 
compiled, linked, and all executable tests were run on the Apple Macintosh 
SE 30. Results were transferred to a Sun 3 computer via a serial line and 
the KERMIT file transfer program, and then printed. 

The compiler was tested using command scripts provided by Meridian Software 
Systems, Inc. and reviewed by the validation team. The compiler was 
tested using all the following option settings. See Appendix E for a 
complete listing of the compiler options for this implementation. The 
following list of compiler options includes those options which were 
invoked explicitly:

Tests were compiled, linked, and executed (as appropriate) using 2 
computers. Test output, compilation listings, and job logs were captured 
on diskettes and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site by the 
validation team were also archived. 


3.7.3 Test Site 

Testing was conducted at Irvine CA and was completed on 30 January 1990.

APPENDIX B 

APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


The only allowed implementation dependencies correspond to 
implementation-dependent pragmas, to certain machine-dependent conventions 
as mentioned in Chapter 13 of the Ada Standard, and to certain allowed 
restrictions on representation clauses. The implementation-dependent 
characteristics of the AdaVantage, Version 4.0 compiler, as described in 
this Appendix, are provided by Meridian Software Systems, Inc. Unless 
specifically noted otherwise, references in this Appendix are to compiler 
documentation and not to this report. Implementation-specific portions of 
the package STANDARD, which are not a part of Appendix F, are: 


package STANDARD is 


type INTEGER is range -2_147_483 648 .. 2 147 483_647; 
type SHORT_INTEGER is range -32758 .. 32757; 
type BYTE_INTEGER is range -128 .. 127; 

type FLOAT is digits 15

Implement at ion- D ep endent 
Characteristics 


This appendix lists implementation-dependent characteristics of the Mac¬ 
intosh version of Meridian AdaVantage. Note that there are no preced¬ 
ing appendices. This appendix is called “Appendix F” because of a very 
clearly stated requirement by ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A that this appendix be 
so named. 

Implemented Chapter 13 features include length clauses, enumeration rep¬ 
resentation clauses, record representation clauses, address clauses, interrupts, 
package SYSTEM, machine code insertions, pragma interface, and unchecked 
programming. 


F.l Pragmas 


The implemented pre-defined pragmas are: 


B-2 







elaborate 

interface 

list 

pack 

page 

priority 

suppress 


Implemented as per ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A section 10.5. 
See section F.1.1. 

Implemented as per ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A Appendix B. 
See section F.1.2. 

Implemented as per ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A Appendix B. 
Implemented as per ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A Appendix B. 
See section F.1.3. 


The remaining pre-defined pragmas are accepted, but presently ignored: 

controlled optimize system-name 

inline shared 

memory-size storage-unit 


Named parameter notation for pragmas is not supported. 

When illegal parameter forms are encountered at compile time, the com¬ 
piler issues a warning message rather than an error, as required by the Ada 
language definition. 

Refer to ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A Appendix B for additional information .bout 
the pre-defined pragmas. 


F.1.1 Pragma Interface 

The form of pragma interface in Meridian AdaVantage is: 
pragma intarfaca( language, subprogram [, " link-name "] ); 

where: 

language is the interface language, one of the names assem¬ 

bly, c, builtin, or internal. The names builtin and 




B-3 







internal are reserved for use by Meridian compiler 
maintainers in run-time support packages. 

subprogram is the name of a subprogram to which the pragma 
interface applies. If link-name is omitted, then the 
Ada subprogram name is also used as the object code 
symbol name. Depending on the language specified, 
some automatic modifications may be made to the 
object code symbol name. 

link-name is an optional string literal specifying the name of the 
non-Ada subprogram corresponding to the Ada sub¬ 
program named in the second parameter. The link- 
name is used as the object code symbol. Depending 
on the language specified, some automatic modifica¬ 
tions may be made to the object code symbol name. 

It is appropriate to use the optional link-name param¬ 
eter to pragma interface when the interface subpro¬ 
gram has a name that does not correspond at all to its 
Ada identifier or when the interface subprogram name 
cannot be given using rules for constructing Ada iden¬ 
tifiers (e.g. if the name contains a ‘S’ character). 

The characteristics of object code symbols emitted for each interface language 
are: 

assembly The object code symbol is the same as the subprogram 
name. If no link-name string is specified, then the sub¬ 
program name is translated to lower case. 

builtin The object code symbol is the same as the subpro¬ 
gram name, but with one underscore character 
prepended, whether or not a link-name string is speci¬ 
fied. If no link-name string is specified, then the sub¬ 
program name is translated to lower case. This lan¬ 
guage interface is reserved for special interfaces defined 


B-4 




by Meridian Software Systems, Inc. The builtin inter¬ 
face is presently used to declare certain low-level run¬ 
time operations whose names must not conflict with 
programmer-defined or system-defined names. 

c The object code symbol is the same as the subprogram 

name. If no link-name string is specified, then the sub¬ 
program name is translated to lower case. This is the 
convention used by the Macintosh C compiler. 

internal No object code symbol is emitted for an interrial’lan- 
guage interface; this language interface is reserved for 
special interfaces defined by Meridian Software Systems, 
Inc. The internal interface is presently used to declare 
certain machine-level bit operations. 

In no case are the low-level calling conventions changed; no automatic data 
conversions are performed on parameters of interface subprograms. It is up 
to the programmer to ensure that calling conventions match and that any 
necessary data conversions take place when calling interface subprograms. 

A pragma interface may appear within the same declarative part as the 
subprogram to which the pragma interface applies, following the subpro¬ 
gram declaration, and prior to the first use of the subprogram. A pragma 
interface that applies to a subprogram declared in a package specification 
must occur within the same package specification as the subprogram decla¬ 
ration; the pragma interface may not appear in the package body in this 
case. A pragma interface declaration for either a private or non-private 
subprogram declaration may appear in the private part of a package speci¬ 
fication. 

Pragma interface for library units is not supported. 

Refer to ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A section 13.9 for additional information about 
pragma interface. 


B-5 




F.1.2 Pragma Pack 

Pragma pack is implemented for composite types (records and arrays). 

Pragma pack is permitted following the composite type declaration to which 
it applies, provided that the pragma occurs within the same declarative part 
as the composite type declaration, before any objects or components of the 
composite type are declared. 

Note that the declarative part restriction means that the type declaration and 
accompanying pragma pack cannot be split across a package specification and 
body. 

The effect of pragma pack is to minimize storage consumption by discrete 
component types whose ranges permit packing. Use of pragma pack does not 
defeat allocations of alignment storage gaps for some record types. Pragma 
pack does not affect the representations of real types, pre-defined integer 
types, and access types. 


F.1.3 Pragma Suppress 

Pragma suppress is implemented as described in ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A 
section 11.7, with these differences: 


• Presently, division-check and overflow-check must be suppressed 
via a compiler flag, -fN; pragma suppress is ignored for these two 
numeric checks. 

• The optional “ON *>” parameter name notation for pragma suppress 
is ignored. 

e The optional second parameter to pragma suppress is ignored; the 
pragma always applies to the entire scope in which it appears. 


B-6 







F.2 Attributes 


There axe presently no implementation-dependent attributes in Meridian 
Ada Vantage. All attributes described in ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A Appendix 
A are implemented. 


F.3 Standard Types 

Two additions’ standard types are defined in AdaVantage: 

1. SHORT-INTEGER, defined with less precision than type INTEGER. 

2. BYTE-INTEGER, defined with less precision than type SHORT-INTEGER; 

The standard numeric types axe defined as: 

typa BYTE.HTEGER is rang* -128..127; 
typa SHQRT.IYTEGER is rang* -32768 .. 32767; 
typa IVTEGER is rang# -2147483648 .. 2147483647; 
type FLOAT is digits 16 

rang* -1.79769313486231E+308 .. 1.79769313488231E+308, 

typa DURATIOI is dalta 0.0001 

ranga -86400.0000 .. 86400.0000; 


F.4 Package SYSTEM 


The specification of package SYSTEM for Macintosh is: 


packaga SYSTEM is 


B-7 







type ADDRESS is ns? IITEGER; 


typs VAME is ( n68000 ); 

SYSTEM.IAME : constant IAME :* m68000; 

STORAGE JJ1IT : constant :» 8; 

HEMORY.SIZE : constant :■ 1024; 

— Systsa-Dopsndont Vanad Knabsrs 

MII.IK : constant :» -2147483648; 

KAX.IHT : constant :* 2147483647; 

MAX.DIGITS : constant :* 15; 

MAX.MAVTISSA : constant :* 31; 

FI1EJDELTA : constant : = 2.0 ** (-31); 

TICK : constant : a 1.0; 

— OtMsr Systsn-Dspsndsnt Dsclarations 
snbtyps PRIORITY is IVTEGER range 1 .. 20; 

end SYSTEM; 


The value of SYSTEM .MEMORY-SIZE is presently meaningless. 


F.5 Restrictions on Representation Clauses 

F.5.1 Length Clauses 

A size specification (T’SIZE) is rejected if fewer bits are specified than can 
accommodate the type. The minimum size of a composite type may be 
subject to application of pragma pack. It is permitted to specify precise sizes 
for unsigned integer ranges, e.g. 8 for the range 0.. 255. However, because 
of requirements imposed by the Ada language definition, a full 32-bit range 
of unsigned values, i.e. 0.. (2**32)-1, cannot be defined, even using a size 
specification. 

The specification of collection size (T’STORAGE-SIZE) is evaluated at run¬ 
time when the scope of the type to which the length clause applies is entered, 
and is therefore subject to rejection (via STORAGE-ERROR) based on available 



storage at the time the allocation is made. A collection may include storage 
used for run-time administration of the collection, and therefore should not 
be expected to accommodate a specific number of objects. Furthermore, cer¬ 
tain classes of objects such as unconstrained discriminant array components 
of records may be allocated outside a given collection, so a collection may 
accommodate more objects than might be expected. 

The specification of storage for a task activation (T' STORAGE-SIZE) is evalu¬ 
ated at run-time when a task to which the length clause applies is activated, 
and is therefore subject to rejection (via STORAGE-ERROR) based on available 
storage at the time the allocation is made. Storage reserved for a task ac¬ 
tivation is separate from storage needed for any collections defined within a 
task body. 

The specification of small for a fixed point type (T ’ SMALL) is subject only 
to restrictions defined in ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A section 13.2. 


F.5.2 Enumeration Representation Clauses 

The internal code for the literal of .an enumeration type named in an enu¬ 
meration representation clause must be in the range of STANDARD. INTEGER. 

The value of an internal code may be obtained by applying an appropriate 
instantiation of UNCHECKED-CONVERSION to an integer type. 


F.5.3 Record Representation Clauses 

The storage unit offset (the at static-simple-expression part) is given in terms 
of 8-bit storage units and must be even. 

A bit position (the range part) applied to a discrete type component may 
be in the range 0.. IS, with 0 being the least significant bit of a component. 
A range specification may not specify a size smaller than can accommodate 
the component. A range specification for a component not accommodating 
bit packing may have a higher upper bound as appropriate (e.g. 0. .31 for 


B-9 




a discriminant string component); the lower bound for such a type must 
be zero. Refer to the internal data representation of a given component in 
determining the component size and assigning offsets. 

Components of discrete types for which bit positions are specified may not 
straddle 16-bit word boundaries. 

The value of an alignment clause (the optional at mod paxt) must evaluate 
to 1, 2, 4, or 8, and may not be smaller than the highest alignment required 
by any component of the record. On Macintosh, this means that some records 
may not have alignment clauses smaller than 2. 


F.5.4 Address Clauses 

An address clause may be supplied for an object (whether constant or vari¬ 
able) or a task entry, but not for a subprogram, package, or task unit. The 
meaning of an address clause supplied for a task entry is given in section 
F.5.5 

An address expression for an object is a 32-bit linear memory address of type 
SYSTEM.ADDRESS. 


F.5.5 Interrupts 


A task entry’s address clause can be used to associate the entry with a 
signal a la UNIX. Values in the range 0.. 16 may be specified. At present, 
only signal 2, representing the Command-Dot keyboard interrupt (or SIGINT 
signal), can be activated via the signal mechanism. Value 0 may be specified, 
but no signal corresponds to value 0, and such an entry is never called via 
the signal mechanism. 

An interrupt entry may not have any parameters. 


B-10 






F.5.6 


Change of Representation 


A change of representation effected by means of type conversion between 
objects of two types, one type derived from a parent type for which a repre¬ 
sentation clause has been supplied (as described in ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A 
section 13.6), is not permitted. 


F.6 Implementation-Dependent Components 


No names are generated by the implementation to denote implementation- 
dependent components. 


F.T Unchecked Conversions 


There are no restrictions on the use of UNCHECKED-CONVERSION. Con¬ 
versions between objects whose sizes do not conform may result in storage 
areas with undefined values. 


F.8 Input-Output Packages 


A summary of the implementation-dependent input-output characteristics is: 

• In calls to OPEN and CREATE, the FORM parameter must be the empty 
string (the default value). 

• More than one internal file can be associated with a single external file 
for reading only. For writing, only one internal file may be associated 
with an external file; RESET may not be used to get around this rule. 

• Temporary sequential and direct files are given names. Temporary files 
are deleted when they are closed. 


B—11 




• File I/O is buffered; text files associated with terminal devices axe line- 
buffered. 

• The packages SEQUENTIALJO and DIRECT-IO cannot be in¬ 
stantiated with unconstrained composite types or record types with 
discriminants without defaults. 


F.9 Source Line and Identifier Lengths 


Source lines and identifiers in Ada source programs are presently limited to 
200 characters in length. 


B-12 





APPENDIX C 


TEST PARAMETERS 


Cerain tests in the ACVC make use of implementation-dependent values, such 
as the maximum length of an input line and invalid file names. A test that 
makes use of such values is identified by the extension .TST in its file 
name. Actual values to be substituted are represented by names that begin 
vith a dollar sign. A value must be substituted for each of these names 
before the test is run. The values used for this validation are given 
below.

APPENDIX D 


WITHDRAWN TESTS 


Some tests are withdrawn from the ACVC because they do not conform to the 
Ada Standard. The following 44 tests had been withdrawn at the time of 
validation testing for the reasons indicated. A reference of the form 
Al-ddddd is to an Ada Commentary. 


a. E2800SC: This test expects that the string "— TOP OF PAGE. —63" of 
line 204 will appear at the top of the listing page due to a pragma 
PAGE in line 203; but line 203 contains text that follows the pragma, 
and it is this text that must appear at the top of the page. 

b. A39005G: This test unreasonably expects a component clause to pack an 
array component into a minimum size (line 30). 

c. B97102E: This test contains an unintended illegality: a select 
statement contains a null statement at the place of a selective wait 
alternative (line 31). 

d. C97116A: This test contains race conditions, and it assumes that 

guards are evaluated indivisibly. A conforming implementation may use 
interleaved execution in such a way that the evaluation of the guards 
at lines 50 & 54 and the execution of task CHANGING 0F_THE_GUARD 

results in a call to REPORT.FAILED at one of lines 52 or 56.“ 

e. BC3009B: This test wrongly expects that circular instantiations will 
be detected in several compilation units even though none of the units 
is illegal with respect to the units it depends on; by AI-00256, the 
illegality need not be detected until execution is attempted (line 
95). 

f. CD2A62D: This test wrongly requires that an array object's size be no 
greater than 10 although its subtype's size was specified to be 40 
(line 137). 


D-l 



WITHDRAWN TESTS 


g. CD2A63A..D, CD2A66A..D, CD2A73A..D, and CD2A76A..D (16 tests): These 

tests wrongly attempt to check the size of objects of a derived type 
(for which a 'SIZE length clause is given) by passing them to a 
derived subprogram (which implicitly converts them to the parent type 
(Ada standard 3.4:14)). Additionally, they use the 'SIZE length 
clause and attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic 
by the WG9 ARG. 

h. CD2A81G, CD2A83G, CD2A84M..N, and CD50110 (5 tests): These tests 

assume that dependent tasks will terminate while the main program 
executes a loop that simply tests for task termination; this is not 
the case, and the main program may loop indefinitely (lines 74, 85, 
86, 96, and 58, respectively). 

i. CD2B15C and CD7205C: These tests expect that a 'STORAGE_SIZE length 
clause provides precise control over the number of designated objects 
in a collection; the Ada standard 13.2:15 allows that such control 
must not be expected. 

j. CD2D11B: This test gives a SMALL representation clause for a derived 
fixed-point type (at line 30) that defines a set of model numbers that 
are not necessarily represented in the parent type; by Commentary 
AI-00099, all model numbers of a derived fixed-point type must be 
representable values of the parent type- 

k. CD5007B: This test wrongly expects an implicitly declared subprogram 
to be at the address that is specified for an unrelated subprogram 
(line 303). 

l. ED7004B, ED7005C..D, and ED7006C..D (5 tests): These tests check 
various aspects of the use of the three SYSTEM pragmas; the AVO 
withdraws these tests as being inappropriate for validation. 

m. CD7105A: This test requires that successive calls to CALENDAR.CLOCK 
change by at least SYSTEM.TICK; however, by Commentary AI-00201, it is 
only the expected frequency of change that must be at least 
SYSTEM.TICK—particular instances of change may be less (line 29). 

n. CD7203B and CD7204B: These tests use the 'SIZE length clause and 
attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic by the WG9 
ARG. 

o. CD7205D: This test checks an invalid test objective: it treats the 
specification of storage to be reserved for a task's activation as 
though it were like the specification of storage for a collection. 


D-2 





WITHDRAWN TESTS 


p. CE2107I: This test requires that objects of two similar scalar types 
be distinguished when read from a file—DATA_ERROR is expected to be 
raised by an attempt to read one object - as of the other type. 
However, it is not clear exactly how the Ada standard 14.2.4:4 is to 
be interpreted; thus, this test objective is not considered valid 
(line 90). 

q. CE3111C: This test requires certain behavior, when two files are 
associated with the same external file, that is not required by the 
Ada standard. 

r. CE3301A: This test contains several calls to END_OF_LINE and 

END_OF_PAGE that have no parameter: these calls were intended to 
specify a file, not to refer to STANDARD INPUT (lines 103, 107, 118, 
132, and 136). 

s. CE3411B: This test requires that a text file's column number be set to 
COUNT'LAST in order to check that LAY0UT_ERR0R is raised by a 
subsequent PUT operation. But the former operation will generally 
raise an exception due to a lack of available disk space, and the test 
would thus encumber validation testing.

APPENDIX E 

COMPILER OPTIONS AS SUPPLIED BT MERIDIAN 


Compiler: AdaVantage, Version 4.0 

ACVC Version: 1.10 


E-l 








• Functional Changes 


A new switch has been added to the ada command to control the calling 
sequences for “pragma interface C”. The -mc68881 option to ada allows 
you to also compile your C functions with the same option. Ada Vantage 
still maintains floating point objects in the 64-bit format, but now you 
can call C routines that use either the 80-bit format (default) or the 96-bit 
format. 


E-2 





14.1 ada 

Name: ada —invoke the Meridian AdaVantage compiler 

14.1.1 Invocation 


ada 


ada [option _] file, ada ... 

14.1.2 Description 

The ada command invokes the Meridian AdaVantage compiler. 

A program library must be created using mklib or newllb in advance of any compilation. The compiler 
aborts if it is unable to find a program library (either the default, ada. lib, in the current working directory 
or the library name specified with the -L option). 

Note that the source file has the extension . ada. Just about any non-empty file extension is permitted. 
The ones not allowed include those used by the AdaVantage compiling system for other purposes such as 
. o for object module files. If an illegal extension is given, the error message “illegal source file extension” 
is displayed. Some other commonly used source file extensions are: 

. ads for package specification source files 

. adb for package body source files 

. sub for subunit (separate) source files 

The Meridian AdaVantage compiler emits Assembly language code that is then automatically compiled 
by the MPW Assembler to produce native 68000 object code. 

14.13 Options 

-£D Generate debugging output. The -£D option causes the compiler to generate the appropriate code 
and data for operation with the Meridian AdaVantage Debugger. For more information on using 
this option and using the Debugger, see Chapter IS. 

-£• Annotate assembly language listing. The -£• option causes the compiler to annotate an assembly 

language output file. The output is supplemented by comments containing the Ada source state¬ 
ments corresponding to the assembly language code sections written by the code generator, lb use 
this option, the-S option must also be specified, otherwise the annotated file is not emitted. Refer 
to section 14.1.9 for more information. 

-Ot Generate error log file. The -£S option causes the compiler to generate a log file containing all 
the errormessages and warning messages produced during compilation. The error log file has the 
same name as the source file, with the extension . «rr. For example, the error log file for slat- 
pi*.ada is siajpls. srr. The error log file is placed in the current working directory. In the 
absence of the -£H option, the error log information is sent to the standard output stream. 

-£L Generate exception location information. The-fl option causes location information (source file 

names and line numbers) to be maintained for internal checks. This information is useful for de¬ 
bugging in the event that an “exception never handled” message appears when an exception propa¬ 
gates out ofthe main program (see section 5.7). This flag causes the code to be somewhat larger. If 
-£L is not used, exceptions that propagate out of the main program will behave in the same way, 
but no location information will be printed with the “exception never handled” message. 

-Ot Suppress numeric checking. The -£N flag suppresses two kinds of numeric checks for the entire 
compilation: 


E-3 




a da 


1. division_check 

2. overflow_check 

These checks are described in section 11.7 of the LRM. This flag reduces the size of the code. Note 
that there is a related ada option, -fa to suppress all checks for a compilation. See also section S.7. 

Tne -fN option must be used in place of pragma suppress for the two numeric checks, because 
presently pragma suppress is not supported for division_check and overflow_check. Pragma 
suppress works for other checks, as described in section 4.2. In the absence of the -fN flag, the 
numeric checks are always performed. 

-£R Inhibit static initialization of variables. Although this option is intended for generating ROMable 
programs on other systems, its primary use on the Macintosh is to enforce a“code-for-data” swap, 
since global data space is at a premium on the Macintosh (see Chapter 11). However, the amount of 
global segment space saved by using this option tends to be small. String literals are always placed 
in the global segment, regardless of the setting of -fR. The -£R option is applicable only in the 
presence of the -fa option, which suppresses certain runtime checks. Normally, the Ada compiler 
initializes constants or variables with static data when the following conditions all occur 

If the -fR flag is specified, static initialization is suppressed for variables (but not for constants); 
assignments to each component of a variable are performed in the code. Note that this always hap¬ 
pens in the absence of the -fa option. 

-fa Suppress all checks. The -fa flag suppresses all automatic checking, including numeric check¬ 
ing. This flag is equivalent to using pragma suppress on all checks. This flag reduces the size of 
the code, and is good for producing‘production quality” codeorfor benchmarking the compiler. 
Note that there is a related ada. option, -fN to suppress only certain kinds of numeric checks. See 
also sections 42 and 5.7. 

-fU Inhibit library update. The -fU option inhibits library updates. This is of use in conjunction with 
the -S option. Certain restrictions apply to use of this option; see section 14.1.9. 

-fv Compile verbosely. The compiler prints the name of each subprogram, package, or generic as it is 

compiled. 

-fw Suppress warning messages. With this option, the compiler does not print warning messages about 

ignored pragmas, exceptions that are certain to be raised at run-time, or other potential problems 
that the compiler is otherwise forbidden to deem as errors by the LRM. 

-g The -g option instructs the compiler to run an additional optimization pass. The optimizer re¬ 
moves common sub-expressions, dead code and unnecessary jumps. It also does loop optimiza¬ 
tions. This option is different from the -g option to baap. The -g option to ada optimizes the 
specified unit when it is compiled; no inter-unit optimization is done. The -g option to basnp ana¬ 
lyzes and optimizes the entire program at link time. Note that even if -g is specified for the aula 
command, the -X option to ada must still be specified for the -g option to banap to be effective. 

-halp 

The -halp option is used to invoke the Meridian Ada Vantage help facility. You musthave Apple’s 
HyperCard application installed. The -halp option must be the first option on the ada command 
line. 

-X Keep internal form file. This option is used in conjunction with the Optimizer (see Chapter 9 for 
more information). Without this option, the compiler deletes internal form files following code 
generation. 

-1 modifiers 

Generate listing file. The -1 option causes the compiler to create a listing. Optional modifiers 


E-4 





a da 


S 


may be given to affect the listing format. You can use none or any combination of the following 
modifiers: 

c continuous listing format, 
p obey pragma page directives, 
a use standard output, 
t relevant text output only. 

Tire formats of and options for listings are discussed in section 14.1.7. The default listing file gen¬ 
erated has the same name as the source file, with the extension . 1st. For example, the default 
listing file produced for simple. ada has the name simple. 1st. The listing file is placed in 
the current working directory. Note: -1 also causes an error log file to be produced, as with the 
-£K option. 

-L library-name 

Default: ada. lib 

Use alternate library. The -L option specifies an alternative name for the program library. 

-mb q The -mbg option prepares a compilation unit for use with the MacsBug machine-level debugger. 

Symbols are truncated to 31 

characters. Refer to the Macintosh Programmer’s Workshop Reference for information about 
MacsBug. 

-mc68020* 

The -mc68020 option causes MC68020 processor instructions to be emitted. Warning: This 
renders a program inoperable on any Macintosh systems but those equipped with the 68020 or 
68030 processor. 

-N No compile. This option causes the ada command to do a “dry run” of the compilation process. 
The command invoked for each processing step is printed. This is similar to the -P opuon, but no 
actual processing is performed. 

-P Print compile. This option causes the ada command to print out the command invoked for each 
processing step as it is performed. 

-3 Generate assembly code. Causes the code generator to produce an assembly language source file 
and to halt further processing. This option must be used cautiously; refer to section 14.1.9 to find 
out how to use this option properly. 

Note: Options beginning with -f may be combined, as in “-£av.” This is equivalent to specifying the 
options separately, c.g. “-fa -£v." Options beginning with-1 may be similarly combined or sepa¬ 
rated, as in “-lea" or “-lc -la" (see section 14.1.7). 

14.1.4 Compiler Output Files 

Files produced by compilations, other than listings and error logs, are: 

.a files assembly language files (only when-S option used) 

.a.o files object code files 

. atr files interface description files 

•This option is actually processed by the Assembler. Although all the MPW Assembler options are accepted 
and passed along to the Assembler by the ada command, only the Assembler options useful in conjunction with 
Meridian Ada Vantage are discussed. For additional details of Assembler options, refer to the Macintosh Pro¬ 
grammer’s Workshop Reference. Unless otherwise noted, “the compiler” or “the code generator” refer to com¬ 
ponents of the AdaVantage compiler, not to the Assembler.
