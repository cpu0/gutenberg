CHAPTER 1 


INTRODUCTION 


The Ada implementation described above was tested according to the Ada 
Validation Procedures [Pro90] against the Ada Standard [Ada83] using the 
current Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC). This Validation Summary 
Report (VSR) gives an account of the testing of this Ada implementation. 

For any technical terms used in this report, the reader is referred to 
[Pro90]. A detailed description of the ACVC may be found in the current 
ACVC User's Guide [UG89].

1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: A, 
B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class to 
which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B and 
class L tests are expected to produce errors at compile time and link time, 
respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result when they 
are executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, 
and the procedure CHECK FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT 
also provides a set of Identity functions used to defeat some compiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately compiled units. Errors 
are expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values — for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in Appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between tne tests and 
implementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this implementation are described in section 2.3.

INTRODUCTION 


For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by the 
AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications described in 
the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see section 2.1), and 
possibly removing some inapplicable tests (see section 2.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each test of 
the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are irrelevant 
for a given Ada implementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may 
be supported by documents issued by the ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and commonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Commentaries are included as 
appropriate.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


The following 201 tests have floating-point type declarations 
requiring more digits theui SYSTEM.MAX_DIGITS: 


C24113L..Y (14 tests) 
C35706L..Y (14 tests) 
C35708L..Y (14 tests) 
C45241L..Y (14 tests) 
C45421L..Y (14 tests) 
C45524L..Z (15 tests) 
C45641L..Y (14 tests) 


C35705L..Y (14 tests) 
C35707L..Y (14 tests) 
C35802L..Z (15 tests) 
C45321L..Y (14 tests) 
C45521L..Z (15 tests) 
C45621L..Z (15 tests) 
C46012L..Z (15 tests) 


C35404D, C45231D, B86001X, C86006E, and CD7101G check for a predefined 
integer type with a name other them INTEGER, LONG_INTEGER, or 
SHORT_INTEGER; for this implementation, there is no such type. 

C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with a 
name other than FLOAT, LONG_FLOAT, or SHORT_FLQAT; for this 
implementation, there is no such type. 

C45531M..P and C45532M..P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations for 
types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or greater; for this 
implementation, MAX_MANTISSA is less than 47. 

C45536A, C46013B, C46031B, C46033B, and C46034B contain length clauses 
that specify values for 'SMALL that are not powers of two or ten; this 
implementation does not support such values for 'SMALL. 

C45624A..B (2 tests) check that the proper exception is raised if 
MACHlNE_OVERFLCWS is FALSE for floating point types and the results of 
various floating-point operations lie outside the range of the base 
type; for this implementation, MACHINE__OVERFLCWS is TRUE. 

B86001Y uses the name of a predefined fixed-point type other than type 
DURATION; for this implementation, there is no such type. 

C96005B uses values of type DURATION'S base type that are outside the 
range of type DURATION; for this implementation, the ranges are the 
same. 


CD1009C checks whether a length clause can specify a non-default size 
for a floating-point type; this implementation does not support such 
sizes. 

CD2A53A checks operations of a fixed-point type for which a length 
clause specifies a power-of-ten TYPE'SMALL; this implementation does 
not support decimal 'SMALLs. (See section 2.3.) 

CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use length clauses 
to specify non-default sizes for access types; this implementation 
does not support such sizes. 


2-2 





IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


BD8001A, BD8003A, BD8004A..B (2 tests), and AD8011A use machine code 
insertions; this implementation provides no package MACHINE_CODE. 

The following 16 tests check operations on sequential, direct, and 
text files when multiple internal files are associated with the same 
external file and one or more are open for writing; USE_ERROR is 
raised when this association is attempted. 


CE2107B..E CE2107G..H CE2107L CD2110B CE2110D 
CE2111D CE2111H CE3111B CE3111D..E CE3114B 
CE3115A 

CE2111C checks whether a sequential file can be reset irom mode 
IN_FILE to mode OUT_FILE; this implementation does not support this 
operation and raises USE_ERROR. 

CE2401H, EE2401D, and EE2401G use instantiations of DIRECT_IO with 
unconstrained array and record types; this implementation raises 
USE_ERROR on the attempt to create a file of such types. 

The tests listed in the following table check that USE_ERROR is raised 
if the given file operations are not supported for the given 
combination of mode and access method; this implementation supports 
these operations.

CE2203A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of an 
external sequential file is exceeded; this implementation cannot 
restrict file capacity. 

CE2403A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of an 
external direct file is exceeded; this implementation cannot restrict 
file capacity. 

CE3304A checks that SET_LINE^LENGTH and SET_PAGE_LENGTH raise 
USE_ERROR if they specify an Inappropriate value for the external 
file; there are no inappropriate values for this implementation. 

CE3413B checks that PAGE raises LAYOUT ERROR when the value of the 
page number exceeds COUNT'LAST; for this Implementation, the value of 
COUNT'LAST is greater than 150000, making the checking of this 
objective inpractical. 

CE3202A expects that function NAME can be applied to the standard 
input and output files; in this implementation these files have no 
names, and USE ERROR is raised. (See section 2.3.) 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 20 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
implementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the 
way expected by the original tests. 

B23004A B24007A B24009A B28003A B32202A B32202B 

B32202C B37004A B61012A B91004A B95069A B95069B 

B97103E BA1101B BC2001D BC3009C 


BA2001E was graded passed by Evaluation Modification as directed by the 
AVO. The test expects that duplicate names of subunits with a common 
ancestor will be detected as compilation errors; this implementation 
detects the errors at link time, and the AVO ruled that this behavior is 
acceptable. 

EA3004D was graded passed by Evaluation and Processing Modification as 
directed by the AVO. The test requires that either pragma INLINE is 
obeyed for a function call in each of three contexts and that thus three 
library units are made obsolete by the re-compilation of the inlined 


2-4 


IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


function's body, or else the pragma is ignored completely. This 
implementation obeys the pragma except when the call is within the package 
specification. When the test's files are processed in the given order, 
only two units are made obsolete; thus, the expected error at line 27 of 
file EA3004D6M is not valid and is not flagged. To confirm that indeed 
the pragma is not obeyed in this one case, the test was also processed 
with the files re-ordered so that the re-compilation follows only the 
package declaration (and thus the other library units will not be made 
obsolete, as they are compiled later); a "NOT APPLICABLE" result was 
produced, as expected. The revised order of files was 0-1-4-5-2-3-6. 

When run as is, the implementation fails to detect an error on line 27 of 
test file EA3004D6M. This is because the pragma INLINE has no effect when 
its object is within a package specification. However, the results of 
running the test as-is do not confirm that the pragma had no effect, only 
that the package was not made obsolete. By re-ordering the compilations 
so that the two subprograms are compiled after file D5 (the re-compilation 
of the "with"ed package that makes the various earlier units obsolete), we 
create a test that shows that indeed pragma INLINE has no effect when 
applied to a subprogram that is called within a package specification. 

The test must execute and produce the expected NOT_APPLICABLE result (as 
though INLINE were not supported at all). The recommended re-ordering of 
EA3004D test files is; 0-1-4-5-2-3-6. 

CD2A53A was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by 
the AVO. The test contains a specification of a power-of-10 value as 
'SMALL for a fixed-point type. The AVO ruled that, under ACVC 1.11, 
support of decimal 'SMALLs may be omitted. 

CE3202A was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by 
the AVO. This test applies function NAME to the standard input file, 
which in this implementation has no name; USE_ERROR is raised but not 
handled, so the test is aborted. The AVO ruled that this behavior is 
acceptable pending any resolution of the issue by the ARG.

PROCESSING INFORMATION 


3.1 TESTING ENVIRONMENT 

The Ada implementation tested in this validation effort is described 
adequately by the information given in the initial pages of this report. 

For technical and sales information about this Ada implementation, contact: 

George Romanski, Vice-President, Engineering 
Alsys, Inc. 

67 South Bedford Street 
Burlington, MA 01803-5152 
(617) 270-0030 

Testing of this Ada implementation was conducted at the customer's site by 
a validation team from the AVF. 


3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming 
Language Standard, whether the test is applicable or inapplicable; 
otherwise, the Ada Implementation fails the ACVC [Pro90]. 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard. 


3-1 


PROCESSING INFORMATION 


The list of items below gives the number of ACVC tests in various 
categories. All tests were processed, except those that were withdrawn 
because of test errors (item b; see section 2.1), those that require a 
floating-point precision that exceeds the implementation's maximum 
precision (item e; see section 2.2), and those that depend on the support 
of a file system — if none is supported (item d). All tests passed, 
except those that are listed in sections 2.1 and 2.2 (counted in items b 
and f, below). 


a) Total Number of Applicable Tests 3792 

b) Total Number of Withdrawn Tests 95 

c) Processed Inapplicable Tests 82 

d) Non-Processed I/O Tests 0 

e) Non-Processed Floating-Point 

Precision Tests 201 

f) Total Number of Inapplicable Tests 233 


g) Total Number of Tests for ACVC 1.11 4170 


3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were loaded directly onto a VAX system (from a standard 1/2 
inch, 9-track VMS BACKUP tape) and then transferred to the HP Vectra RS/25C 
via ethernet. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host computer, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 

The tests were compiled, linked, and executed on the host computer system, 
as appropriate. The results were captured on the computer system. 

Testing was performed using-command scripts provided by the customer and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a complete listing of 
the processing options for this implementation. It also indicates the 
default options. The options invoked explicitly for validation testing 
during this test were: 


Compiler Options: 


TEXT => 

NO 

Do not show source code in listing 
(used for all but the B tests) 

TEXT =*> 

YES 

Show source code in listing 
(used for the B tests) 


3-2 



PROCESSING INFORMATION 


SHOW «> NO 

WARNING «> NO 
ERRORS -> 999 

CALLS =»> INLINED 

GENERICS -> STUB 


Do not show header nor error summary in 
listing. 

Do not include warning messages. 

Maximum number of compilation errors 
permitted before terminating the compilation. 

This option allows insertion of code for 
subprograms inline and must be set for the 
pragma INLINE to be operative. 

This option places code of generic 
instantiations in separate subunits. 


The default options were used for all binds. 

Test output, compiler and linker listings, and job logs were captured on 
magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site by 
the validation team were also archived.

APPENDIX A 


MACRO PARAMETERS 


This appendix contains the macro parameters used for customizing the ACVC. 
The meaning and purpose of these parameters are explained in [UG89]. The 
parameter values are presented in two tables. The first table lists the 
values that are defined in terms of the maximum input-line length, which is 
the value for $MAX_IN_LEN—also listed here. These values are expressed 
here as Ada string aggregates, where "V" represents the maximum input-line 
length.

APPENDIX F 


Implementation - Dependent Characteristics 


This appendix summarizes the implementation-dependent characteristics of the Alsys 
Ada Software Development Environment for BTOS II. Appendix F is a required part of 
the Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language (called the RM in this 
appendix). 

The sections of this appendix are as follows: 

1. The form, allowed places, and effect of every implementation-dependent pragma. 

2. The name and the type of every implementation-dependent attribute. 

3. The specification of the package S YSTEM. 

4. The description of the representation clauses. 

5. The conventions used for any implementation-generated name denoting im¬ 
plementation-dependent components. 

6. The interpretation of expressions that appear in address clauses, including those 
for interrupts. 

7. Any restrictions on unchecked conversions. 

8. Any implementation-dependent characteristics of the input-output packages. 

9. Characteristics of numeric types. 

10. Other implementation-dependent characteristics. 

11. Compiler limitations. 


Implementation -Dependent Characteristics 


1 


The name Alsys Runtime Executive Programs or simply Runtime Executive refers to the 
runtime library routines provided for all Ada programs. These routines implement the 
Ada heap, exceptions, tasking control, and other utility functions. 

General systems programming notes are given in another document, the Application 
Developer’s Guide (for example, parameter passing conventions needed for interface with 
assembly routines). 


? 


Appendix F, Version 5 




Section 1 


Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 


1.1 INLINE 

Pragma INLINE is fully supported; however, it is not possible to inline a subprogram in a 
declarative part. 


1.2 INTERFACE 

Ada programs can interface with subprograms written in Assembler and other languages 
through the use of the predefined pragma INTERFACE and the implementation-defined 
pragma INTERFACE_NAME. 

Pragma INTERFACE specifies the name of an interfaced subprogram and the name of 
the programming language for which parameter passing conventions will be generated. 
Pragma INTERFACE takes the form specified in the RM: 

pragma INTERFACE (language _name, subprogram jiame)\ 

where, 

• language jxame is ASSEMBLER or ADA 

■ subprogram jxame is the name used within the Ada program to refer to the 
interfaced subprogram. 

The only language names accepted by pragma INTERFACE are ASSEMBLER or ADA 
The full implementation requirements for writing pragma INTERFACE subprograms are 
described in the Application Developer’s Guide. 

The language name used in the pragma INTERFACE does not have to have any 
relationship to the language actually used to write the interfaced subprogram. It is used 
only to tell the Compiler how to generate subprogram calls; that is, what kind of 
parameter passing techniques to use. The programmer can interface Ada programs with 
subroutines written in any other (compiled) language by understanding the mechanisms 


Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 


3 




used for parameter passing by the compiler and the corresponding mechanisms of the 
chosen external language. 


1.3 INTERFACE.NAME 

Pragma INTERFaCE_NAME associates the name of the interfaced subprogram with the 
external name of the interfaced subprogram. If pragma INTERFACE_NAME is not used, 
then the two names are assumed to be identical. This pragma takes the form: 

pragma INTERFACE_NAME (subprogram_name, string Jiteral ); 

where, 

■ subprogram jiame is the name used within the Ada program to refer to the 
interfaced subprogram. 

■ string Jiteral is the name by which the interfaced subprogram is referred to at link 
time. 

The pragma INTERFACEJNAME is used to identify routines in other languages that are 
not named with legal Ada identifiers. Ada identifiers can only contain letters, digits, or 
underscores, whereas the BTOS II Linker allows external names to contain other 
characters, for example, the dollar sign (S) or commercial at sign (@). These characters 
can be specified in the string Jiteral argument of the pragma INTERFACE_N AME. 

The pragma INTERFACE_NAME is allowed at the same places of an Ada program as the 
pragma INTERFACE. (Location restrictions can be found in section 13.9 of the RM.) 
However, the pragma INTERFACE^ AME must always occur after the pragma 
INTERFACE declaration for the interfaced subprogram. 

The string Jiteral of the pragma INTERFACE_NAME is passed through unchanged to the 
BTOS n object file. The maximum length of the string Jiteral is 40 characters. This limit 
is not checked by the Compiler, but the string is truncated by the Binder to meet the 
Intel object module format standard. 

The user must be aware however, that some tools from other vendors do not fully 
support the standard Intel object file format and may restrict the length of symbols. For 
example, the Microsoft assemblers silently truncate symbols at 31 characters. 

The Runtime Executive contains several external identifiers. All such identifiers begin 
with either the string *ADA@" or the string ’ADAS®'. Accordingly, names prefixed by 
"ADA@" or "ADAS@* should be avoided by the user.

Appendix F, Version 5 




Example 


package SAMPLE_DATA is 

function SAMPLE_DEVICE (X; INTEGER) return INTEGER; 
function PROCESS.SAMPLE (X; INTEGER) return INTEGER; 
private 

pragma INTERFACE (ASSEMBLER, SAMPLE_DEVTCE); 
pragma INTERFACE (ADA PROCESS_SAMPLE); 

pragma INTERFACE_NAME (SAMPLE_DEVICE, “DEVIOSGET_SAMPLE"); 
end SAMPLE_DATA; 


1.4 INDENT 

Pragma INDENT is only used with AdaReformat. AdaReformat is the Alsys reformatter 
which offers the functionalities of a pretty-printer in an Ada environment. 

The pragma is placed in the source file and interpreted by the Reformatter. The line 

pragma INDENT(OFF); 

causes AdaReformat not to modify the source lines after this pragma, while 
pragma INDENT(ON); 

causes AdaReformat to resume its action after this pragma 


1.5 Other Pragmas 

Pragmas IMPROVE and PACK are discussed in detail in the section on representation 
clauses and records (Chapter 4). 

Pragma PRIORITY is accepted with the range of priorities running from 1 to 10 (see the 
definition of the predefined package SYSTEM in Section 3). Undefined priority (no 
pragma PRIORITY) is treated as though it were less than any defined priority value. 

In addition to pragma SUPPRESS, it is possible to suppress all checks in a given compi¬ 
lation by the use of the Compiler option CHECKS. (See Chapter 4 of the User's Guide.)

Section 4 


Support for Representation Clauses 


This section explains how objects are represented and allocated and how it is possible to 
control this using representation clauses. Applicable restrictions on representation 
clauses are also described. 

The representation of an object is closely connected with its type. For this reason this 
section addresses successively the representation ot eauntci _::on, integer, floating point, 
fixed point, access, task, array and record types. For each class of type the representation 
of the corresponding objects is described. 

Except in the case of array and record types, the description for each class of type is 
independent of the others. To understand the representation of anay and record types it 
is necessaiy to understand first the representation of their components. 

Apart from implementation defined pragmas, Ada provides three means to control the 
size of objects: 

• a (predefined) pragma PACK, applicable to array types 

■ a record representation clause 

■ a size specification 

For each class of types the effect of a size specification is described. Interactions among 
size specifications, packing and record representation clauses is described under the 
discussion of array and record types. 

Representation clauses on derived record types or derived tasks types are not supported. 

Size representation clauses on types derived from private types are not supported when 
the derived type is declared outside the private pan of the defining package.

4.1 Enumeration Types 


4.1.1 Enumeration Literal Encoding 

When no enumeration representation clause applies to an enumeration type, the 
internal code associated with an enumeration literal is the position number of the 
enumeration literal Then, for an enumeration type with n elements, the internal codes 
are the integers 0,1,2,, n-1. 

An enumeration representation clause can be provided to specify the value of each 
internal code as described in RM 13.3. The Alsys compiler fully implements enumeration 
representation clauses. 

As internal codes must be machine integers the internal codes provided by an 
enumeration representation clause must be in the range -2 31 .. 2 31 -1. 

An enumeration value is always represented by its internal code in the program 
generated by the compiler. 


4.1.2 Enumeration Types and Object Sizes 

Minimum size of an enumeration subtype 

The minimum possible size of an enumeration subtype is the minimum number of bits 
that is necessary for representing the internal codes of the subtype values in normal 
binary form. 

A static subtype, with a null range has a minimum size of 1. Otherwise, if m and M are 
the values of the internal codes associated with the first and last enumeration values of 
the subtype, then its minimum size L is determined as follows. For m > « 0, L is the 
smallest positive integer such that M < * 2 L -1. For m < 0, L is the smallest positive 
integer such that -2 L '~ < = m and M < = 2 L ' l -l. For example: 

type COLOR is (GREEN, BLACK, WHITE, RED, BLUE, YELLOW); 

- The minimum size of COLOR is 3 bits. 

subtype BLACK_AND_WHITE is CO.OR range BLACK.. WHITE; 

- The minimum size of BLACK_AND_WHITE is 2 bits. 


16 


Appendix F, Version 5 




subtype BLACK_OR_WHITE is BLACK_AND_WHITE range X.. X; 

~ Assuming that X is not static, the minimum size of BLACK_OR_WHITE is 
- 2 bits (the same as the minimum size of its type mark BLACK_AND_WHrTH). 


Size of an enumeration subtype 

When no size specification is applied to an enumeration type or fust named subtype, the 
objects of that type or first named subtype are represented as signed machine integeis. 
The machine provides 8,16 and 32 bit integers, and the compiler selects automatically 
the smallest signed machine integer which can hold each of the internal codes of the 
enumeration type (or subtype). The size of the enumeration type and of any of its 
subtypes is thus 8,16 or 32 bits. 

When a size specification is applied to an enumeration type, this enumeration type and 
each of its subtypes has the size specified by the length clause. The same rule applies to a 
first named subtype. The size specification must of course specify a value greater than or 
equal to the minimum size of the type or subtype to which it applies: 


type EXTENDED is 

(- The usual ASCII character set 

NUL, SOH, STX, ETX, EOT, ENQ, ACK, BEL, 


V, 


y, ’Z\ T, T, T. '-\ del. 


- Extended characters 

C_CEDILLA_CAP, U_UMLAUT, E_ACUTE, .„); 
for EXTENDED-SIZE use 8; 

- The size of type EXTENDED will be one byte. Its objects will be represented 

- as unsigned 8 bit integers. 

The Alsys compiler fully implements size specifications. Nevertheless, as enumeration 
values are coded using integers, the specified length cannot be greater than 32 bits. 


Size of the objects of an enumeration subtype 

Provided its size is not constrained by a record component clause or a pragma PACK, an 
object of an enumeration subtype has the same size as its subtype

4.2 Integer Types 

There are three predefined integer types in the Alsys Ada Software Development 
Environment for BTOS II implementation: 

type SHORTJNTEGER is range -2**07.. 2**07-l; 

type INTEGER is range -2**15.. 2**15-1; 

type LONGJNTEGER is range -2* *31.. 2* *31*1; 


4.2.1 Integer Type Representation 
An integer type declared by a declaration of the form: 
type T is range L.. R; 

is implicitly derived from a predefined integer type. The compiler automatically selects 
the predefined integer type whose range is the smallest that contains the values L to R 
inclusive. 

Binary code is used to represent integer values. Negative numbers are represented using 
two’s complement 


4.2.2 Integer Type and Object Size 

Minimum size of an integer subtype 

The minimum possible size of an integer subtype is the minimum number of bits that is 
necessary for representing the internal codes of the subtype values in normal binary 
form. 

For a static subtype, if it has a null range its minimum size is 1. Otherwise, if m and M are 
the lower and upper bounds of the subtype, then its minimum size L is determined as 
follows. For m > * 0, L is the smallest positive integer such that M < = 2 L ' 1 . For m < 
0, L is the smallest positive integer that -2 L '* < = m and M < » 2 L * 1 -1. For example: 

subtype S is INTEGER range 0.. 7; 

- The minimum size of S is 3 bits. 


18 


Appendix F, Version 5 




subtype D is S range X.. Y; 

- Assuming that X and Y are not static, the minim um size of 

- D is 3 bits (the same as the minimum size of its type marie S). 


Size of an integer subtype 

The sizes of the predefined integer types SHORTJNTEGER, INTEGER and 
LONGJNTEGER are respectively 8,16 and 32 bits. 

When no size specification is applied to an integer type or to its first uamed subtype (if 
any), its size and the size of any of its subtypes is the size of the predefined type from 
which it derives, directly or indirectly. For example: 

type S is range 80.. 100; 

- S is derived from SHORTJNTEGER, its size is 8 bits, 
type J is range 0.. 255; 

- J is derived from INTEGER, its size is 16 bits. 

type N is new J range 80.. 100; 

- N is indirectly derived from INTEGER, its size is 16 bits. 

When a size specification is applied to an integer type, this integer type and each of its 
subtypes has the size specified by the length clause. The same rule applies to a fust 
named subtype. The size specification must of course specify a value greater than or 
equal to the minimum size of the type or subtype to which it applies: 

type S is range 80.. 100; 
for S’SIZE use 32; 

- S is derived from SHORTJNTEGER, but its size is 32 bits 

- because of the size specification. 

type J is range 0.. 255; 
for J’SIZE use 8; 

- J is derived from INTEGER, but its size is 8 bits because 

- of the size specification. 

type N is new J range 80.. 100; 

- N is indirectly derived from INTEGER, but its size is 

- 8 bits because N inherits the size specification of J.

Size of the objects of an integer subtype 

Provided its size is not constrained by a record component clause or a pragma PACK, an 
object of an integer subtype has the same size as its subtype. 


4 3 Floating Point Types 

There are three predefined floating point types in the Alsys implementation for 180x86 
machines: 

type SHORT FLOAT is 

digits 6ronge -(2.0- 2.0**(-23))*2.0**127.. (2.0- 2.0**(-23))*2.0**127; 
type FLOAT is 

digits 6 range -(2.0 - 2.0**(-23))*2.0**127 .. (2.0 - 2.0**(-23))*2.0**127; 


type LONG FLOAT is 

digits 15 range -(2.0 - 2.0* *(-52)) *2.0“ 1023.. (2.0 - 2.0* *(-52)) *2.0* *1023; 
Note that SHORT_FLOAT has the same range as FLOAT. 


43.1 Floating Point Type Representation 

A floating point type declared by a declaration of the form: 

type T is digits D [range L.. RJ; 

is implicitly derived from a predefined floating point type. The compiler automatically 
selects the smallest predefined floating point type whose number of digits is greater than 
or equal to D and which contains the values L to R inclusive. 

In the program generated by the compiler, floating point values are represented using 
the IEEE standard formats for single and double floats. 

The values of the predefined types SHORT_FLOAT and FLOAT are represented using the 
single float format. The values of the predefined type LONG_FLOAT are represented 
using the double float format. The values of any other floating point type are represented 
in the same way as the values of the predefined type from which it derives, directly or 
indirectly. 


20 


Appendix F, Version 5 





43.2 Floating Point Type and Object Size 

The minimum possible size of a floating point subtype is 32 bits if its base type is 
SHORT_FLOAT or FLOAT or a type derived from SHORT_FLOAT or FLOAT; it is 64 bits 
if its base type is LONG_FLOAT or a type derived from LONG_FLOAT. 

The sizes of the predefined floating point types SHORT_FLOAT and FLOAT is 32 bits 
and LONG_FLOAT is 64 bits. 

The size of a floating point type and the size of any of its subtypes is the size of the 
predefined type from which it derives directly or indirectly. 

The only size that can be specified for a floating point type or first named subtype using a 
size specification is its usual size (32 or 64 bits). 

An object of a floating point subtype has the same size as its subtype. 


4.4 Fixed Point T^pes 


4.4.1 Fixed Point Type Representation 

If no specification of small applies to a fixed point type, then the value of small is 
determined by the value of delta as defined by RM 33.9. 

A specification of small can be used to impose a value of small. The value of small is 
required to be a power of two. 

To implement fixed point types, the Alsys Ada Software Development Environment for 
BTOS II uses a set of anonymous predefined types of the form: 

type SHORT_FIXED is delta D range (-2.0**7-l)*S.. 2.0**7*S; 
for SHORT_FIXED’SMALL use S; 

type FIXED is delta D range (-2.0**15-1)*S.. 2.0**15*S; 
for FTXED’SMALL use S; 

type LONG_FD£ED is delta D range (-2.0**3l-l)*S.. 2.0**31*S; 
for LONG_FTXED’SMALL use S; 

where D is any real value and S any power of two less than or equal to D. 


Support for Representation Clauses 


21 



A fixed point type declared by a declaration of the form: 

type T is delta D range L.. R; 
possibly with a small specification: 
for TSMALL use S; 

is implicitly derived from a predefined fixed point type. The compiler automatically 
selects the predefined fixed point type whose small and delta are the same as the small 
and delta of T and whose range is the shortest that includes the values L to R inclusive. 

In the program generated by the compiler, a safe , 'alue V of a fixed point subtype F is 
represented as the integer: 

V / FBASE’SMALL 


4.4.2 Fixed Point Type and Object Size 
Minimum size of a fixed point subtype 

The minimum possible size of a fixed point subtype is the minimum number of binary 
digits that is necessary for representing the values of the range of the subtype using the 
small of the base type. 

For a static subtype, if it has a null range its minimum size is 1. Otherwise, s and S being 
the bounds of the subtype, if i and I are the integer representations of m and M, the 
smallest and the greatest model numbers of the base type such that s < m and M < S, 
then the minimum size L is determined as follows. For i > = 0, L is the smallest positive 
integer such that I <=2 L ’ 1 . Fori < 0, Lis the smallest positive integer such that - 
2 l " x < » i and I <* 2 L '*-1. 

type F is delta 2.0 range 0.0 .. 500.0; 

- The minimum size of F is 8 bits. 

subtype S is F delta 16.0 range 0.0.. 250.0; 

- The minimum size of S is 7 bits. 

subtype D is S range X.. Y; 

— Assuming that X and Y are not static, the minimum size of D is 7 bits 

- (the same as the minimum size of its type mark S). 


22 Appendix F, Version 5 







Size of a fixed point subtype 


The sizes of the predefined fixed point types SHORTJFIXED, FIXED and LONG_FTXED 
are respectively 8,16 and 32 bits. 

When no size specification is applied to a fixed point type or to its first named subtype, 
its size and the size of any of its subtypes is the size of the predefined type from which it 
derives directly or indirectly. For example: 

type S is delta 0.01 range 0.8.. 1.0; 

- S is derived from an 8 bit predefined fixed type, its size is 8 bits, 
type F is delta 0.01 range 0.0.. 2.0; 

- F is derived from a 16 bit predefined fixed type, its size is 16 bits, 
type N is new F range 0.8.. 1.0; 

- N is indirectly derived from a 16 bit predefined fixed type, its size is 16 bits. 

When a size specification is applied to a fixed point type, this fixed point type and each of 
its subtypes has the size specified by the length clause. The same rule applies to a first 
named subtype. The size specification must of course specify a value greater than or 
equal to the minimum size of the type or subtype to which it applies: 

type S is delta 0.01 range 0.8.. 1.0; 
for S’SIZE use 32; 

- S is derived from an 8 bit predefined fixed type, but its size is 32 bits 

- because of the size specification. 

type F is delta 0.01 range 0.0.. 2,0; 
for FSIZE use 8; 

- F is derived from a 16 bit predefined fixed type, but its size is 8 bits 

- because of the size specification. 

type N is new F range 0.8.. 1.0; 

- N is indirectly derived from a 16 bit predefined fixed type, but its size is 
~ 8 bits because N inherits the size specification of F. 


Support for Representation Clauses 


23 




The Alsys compiler fully implements size specifications. Nevertheless, as fixed point 
objects are represented using machine integers, the specified length cannot be greater 
than 32 bits. 


Size of the objects of a fixed point subtype 

Provided its size is not constrained by a record component clause or a pragma PACK, an 
object of a fixed point type has the same size as its subtype. 


4.5 Access Types and Collections 

Access Types and Objects of Access Types 

The only size that can be specified for an access type using a size specification is its usual 
size (32 bits). 

An object of an access subtype has the same size as its subtype, thus an object of an 
access subtype is always 32 bits long. 


Collection Size 

As described in RM 13.2, a specification of collection size can be provided in order to 
reserve storage space for the collection of an access type. 

When no STORAGE_SIZE specification applies to an access type, no storage space is 
reserved for its collection, and the value of the attribute STORAGE_SIZE is then 0. 

The maximum size allowed for a collection is 64k bytes. 


4.6 Task Types 

Storage for a task activation 

As described in RM 13.2, a length clause can be used to specify the storage space (that is, 
the stack size) for the activation of each of the tasks of a given type. Alsys also allows the 
task stack size, for all tasks, to be established using a Binder option. If a length clause is 
given for a task type, the value indicated at bind time is ignored for this task type, and the 
length ciaus: is obeyed. When no length clause is used to specify the storage space to be 


24 


Appendix F, Version 5 




reserved for a task activation, the storage space indicated at bind time is used for this 
activation. 

A length clause may not be applied to a derived task type. The same storage space is 
reserved for the activation of a task of a derived type as for the activation of a task of the 
parent type. 

The minimum size of a task subtype is 32 bits. 

A size specification has no effect on a task type. The only size that can be specified using 
such a length clause is its usual size (32 bits). 

An object of a task subtype has the same size as its subtype. Thus an object of a task 
subtype is always 32 bits long. 


4.7 Array Types 

Each array is allocated in a contiguous area of storage units. All the components have 
the same size. A gap may exist between two consecutive components (and after the last 
one). All the gaps have the same size.

If pragma PACK is not specified for an array, the size of the components is the size of the 
subtype of the components: 


Support for Representation Clauses

type A is array (1.. 8) of BOOLEAN; 

- The size of the components of A is the size of the type BOOLEAN: 8 bits. 

type DECIMAL_DIGIT is range 0.. 9; 
for DECIMAL_5lGITSIZE use 4; 
type BINARYJcODED.DECIMAL is 

array (IKTEGERrange <>)ofDECIMAL_DIGIT; 

- The size of the type DECIMAL_DIGIT is 4 bits. Thus in an array of 

- type BINARY_CODED^DECIMAL each component will be represented on 

- 4 bits as in the usual BCD representation. 

If pragma PACK is specified for an array and its components are neither records nor 
arrays, the size of the components is the minimum size of the subtype of the components: 

type A is array (1.. 8) of BOOLEAN; 
pragma PACK(A); 

-* The size of the components of A is the minimum size of the type BOOLEAN: 

-1 bit. 

type DECIMAL_DIGIT is range 0.. 9; 
for DECIMAL.DIGirSIZE use 32; 
type BINARY_CODED_DECIMAL is 

array (INTEGER range < >) of DECIMAL_DIGIT; 
pragma PACK(BINARY_CODED_DECIMAL); " 

~ The size of the type DECIMaL_DIGIT is 32 bits, but, as 

- BINARY_CODED_DECIMAL is packed, each component of an array of this 
~ type will be represented on 4 bits as in the usual BCD representation. 

Packing the array has no effect on the size of the components when the components are 
records or arrays, since records and arrays may be assigned addresses consistent with the 
alignment of their subtypes. 


Gaps 

If the components are records or arrays, no size specification applies to the subtype of 
the components and the array is not packed, then the compiler may choose a 
representation with a gap after each component; the aim of the insertion of such gaps is 
to optimize access to the array components and to their subcomponents. The size of the 
gap is chosen so that the relative displacement of consecutive components is a multiple 


26 


Appendix F, Version 5 





of the alignment of the subtype of the components. This strategy allows each component 
and subcomponent to have an address consistent with the alignment of its subtype: 

type R is

K: INTEGER; 

B: BOOLEAN; 

end record; 
for R use 
record 

KatO range 0.. 15; 

B at 2 range 0.. 0,

-- Record type R is byte aligned. Its size is 17 bits, 
type A is array (1.. 10) of R;

4.7 2 Array Subtype and Object Size 

Size of an array subtype 

The size of an array subtype is obtained by multiplying the number of its components by 
the sum of the size of the components and the size of the gaps (if any). If the subtype is 
unconstrained, the maximum number of components is considered. 

The size of an array subtype cannot be computed at compile time 

■ if it has non-static constraints or is an unconstrained array type with non-static 
index subtypes (because the number of components can then only be determined at 
run time). 

■ if the components are records or arrays and their constraints or the constraints of 
their subcomponents (if any) are not static (because the size of the components and 
the size of the gaps can then only be determined at run time). 

As has been indicated above, the effect of a pragma PACK on an array type is to suppress 
the gaps. The consequence of packing an array type is thus to reduce its size. 

If the components of an array are records or arrays and their constraints or the 
constraints of their subcomponents (if any) are not static, the compiler ignores any 
pragma PACK applied to the array type but issues a warning message. Apart from this 
limitation, array packing is fully implemented by the Alsys compiler. 


28 


Appendix F, Version 5 




A size specification applied to an array type or first named subtype has no effect. The 
only size that can be specified using such a length clause is its usual size. Nevertheless, 
such a length clause can be useful to verify that the layout of an array is as expected by 
the application. 


Size of the objects of an array subtype 

The size of an object of an array subtype is always equal to the size of the subtype of the 
object. 


4.8 Record Types 


4.8.1 Basic Record Structure 

Layout of a record 

Each record is allocated in a contiguous area of storage units. The size of a record 
component depends on its type. 

The positions and the sizes of the components of a record type object can be controlled 
using a record representation clause as described in RM 13.4. In the Alsys Ada Software 
Development Environment for BTOSII implementation there is no restriction on the 
position that can be specified for a component of a record. If a component is not a record 
or an array, its size can be any size from the minimum size to the size of its subtype. If a 
component is a record or an array, its size must be the size of its subtype.

Pragma PACK has no effect on records. It is unnecessary because record representation 
clauses provide full control over record layout. 

A record representation clause need not specify the position and the size for every 
component If no component clause applies to a component of a record, its size is the 
size of its subtype.

4.8.2 Indirect Components 

VFFSET 


If the offset of a component cannot be computed at compile time, this offset is stored in 
the record objects at run time and used to access the component Such a component is 
said to be indirect while other components are said to be direct: 



Beginning of the record 
Conpils tin offset 

Compile tin offset 


Run tin offset 


A direct and an indirect component 

If a record component is a record or an array, the size of its subtype may be evaluated at 
run time and may even depend on the discriminants of the record. We will call these 
components dynamic components: 

type DEVICE is (SCREEN, PRINTER); 

type COLOR Is (GREEN, RED, BLUE); 

type SERIES is array (POSITIVE range < >) of INTEGER; 

type GRAPH (L : NATURAL) is 
record 

X: SERIES(l „ L); - The size of X depends on L 
Y: SERJES(l _ L); - The size of Y depends on L 
end record; 

Q: POSITIVE; 


Support for Representation Clauses 


31 




type PICTURE (N : NATURAL; D : DEVICE) is 

record 

F: GRAPH(N); -- The size of F depends on N 
S: GRAPH(Q); -- The size of S depends on Q 
case D is 

when SCREEN = > 

C: COLOR; 
when PRINTER = > 
null; 
end case; 
end record; 

Any component placed after a dynamic component has an offset which cannot be 
evaluated at compile time and is thus indirect. In order to minimize the number of 
indirect components, the compiler groups the dynamic components together and places 
them at the end of the record: 

0 » SCREEN 0 ■ PRINTER 

N ■ 2 N « 1 


S OFFSET 


F OFFSET

Run time offsets 


-[ 


S OFFSET 


F OFFSET 


The record type PICTURE: F and S are placed at the end of the record 


32 


Appendix F, Version 5 




Note that Ada does not allow representation clauses for record components with non¬ 
static bounds [RM 13.4.7], so the compiler’s grouping of dynamic components does not 
conflict with the use of representation clauses. 

Because of this approach, the only indirect components are dynamic components. But 
not all dynamic components are necessarily indirect: if there are dynamic components in 
a component list which is not followed by a variant part, then exactly one dynamic 
component of this list is a direct component because its offset can be computed at 
compilation time (the only dynamic components that are direct components are in this 
situation):

■ — ■ Coopile time offset 

Size dependent on discriminant L 

. . . . (tun time offset 

Size de p e n d en t on discriminant L 


The record type GRAPH: the dynamic component X is a direct component. 


The offset of an indirect component is always expressed in storage units. 

The space reserved for the offset of an indirect component must be large enough to store 
the size of any value of the record type (the maximum potential offset). The compiler 
evaluates an upper bound MS of this size and treats an offset as a component having an 
anonymous integer type whose range isO_ MS. 

If C is the name of an indirect component, then the offset of this component can be 
denoted in a component clause by the implementation generated name COFFSHT.

4.83 Implicit Components 

In some circumstances, access to an object of a record type or to its components involves 
computing information which only depends on the discriminant values. To avoid 
recomputation (which would degrade performance) the compiler stores this information 
in the record objects, updates it when the values of the discriminants are modified and 
uses it when the objects or its components are accessed. This information is stored in 
special components called implicit components. 

An implicit component may contain information which is used when the record object or 
several of its components are accessed. In this case the component will be included in any 
record object (the implicit component is considered to be declared before any variant 
part in the record type declaration). There can be two components of this kind; one is 
called RECORD_SIZE and the other VARIANTJNDEX. 

On the other hand an implicit component may be used to access a given record 
component In that case the implicit component exists whenever the record component 
exists (the implicit component is considered to be declared at the same place as the 
record component). Components of this kind are called ARRAY_DESCRIPTORs or 
RECORD_DESCRIPTORS. 


’RECORDJSIZE 

This implicit component is created by the compiler when the record type has a variant 
part and its discriminants are defaulted. It contains the size of the storage space 
necessary to store the current value of the record object (note that the storage effectively 
allocated for the record object may be more than this). 

The value of a RECORD_SIZE component may denote a number of bits or a number of 
storage units. In general it denotes a number of storage units, but if any component 
clause specifies that a component of the record type has an offset or a size which cannot 
be expressed using storage units, then the value designates a number of bits. 

The implicit component RECORD_SIZE must be large enough to store the maximum 
size of any value of the record type. The compiler evaluates an upper bound MS of this 
size and then considers the implicit component as having an anonymous integer type 
whose range is 0.. MS. 

If R is the name of the record type, this implicit component can be denoted in a 
component clause by the implementation generated name R'RECORD_SIZE. This 
allows user control over the position of the implicit component in the record. 


34 


Appendix F, Version 5 




VAJUANTJNDEX 

This implicit component is created by the compiler when the record type has a variant 
part. It indicates the set of components that are present in a record value. It is used when 
a discriminant check is to be done. 

Component lists in variant parts that themselves do not contain a variant part are 
numbered. These numbers are the possible values of the implicit component 
variantjndex. 

type VEHICLE is (AIRCRAFT, ROCKET, BOAT, CAR); 

type DESCRIPTION (KIND : VEHICLE := CAR) is

noil; 
end case; 

when BOAT = > - 3 
STEAM : BOOLEAN; 
when ROCKET = > -4 

STAGES: INTEGER; 

end case; 
end record; 

The value of the variant index indicates the set of components that are present in a 
record value:

{KINO, SPEED, WHEELS, WINGSPAN} 

2 

(KIND, SPEED, WHEELS} 

3 

{KINO, SPEED, STEAK)

Support for Representation Clauses 


35 





A comparison between the variant index of a record value and the bounds of an interval 
is enough to check that a given component is present in the value: 


Conponent 

Interval 

KINO

SPEED 

*• 

WHEELS 

1 .. 2 

WINGSPAN 

1 .. 1 

STEAM 


STAGES 



The implicit component VaRIANTJNDEX must be large enough to store the number v 
of component lists that don't contain variant parts. The compiler treats this implicit 
component as having an anonymous integer type whose range is 1.. V. 

If R is the name of the record type, this implicit component can be denoted in a 
component clause by the implementation generated name R’VARIANTJNDEX. This 
allows user control over the position of the implicit component in the record. 


! ARRAY-DESCRIPTOR 

An implicit component of this kind is associated by the compiler with each record 
component whose subtype is an anonymous array subtype that depends on a discriminant 
of the record. It contains information about the component subtype. 

The structure of an implicit component of kind ARRAY_DESCRIPTOR is not described 
in this documentation. Nevertheless, if a programmer is interested in specifying the 
location of a component of this kind using a component clause, size of the component 
may be obtained using the ASSEMBLY parameter in the COMPILE command. 

The compiler treats an implicit component of the kind ARRAY_DESCRIPTOR as having 
an anonymous array type. If c is the name of the record component whose subtype is 
described by the array descriptor, then this implicit component can be denoted in a 
component clause by the implementation generated name CARRAY_DESCRIPTOR. 

This allows user control over the position of the implicit component in the record.

Appendix F, Version 5 







'RECORD_DESCRIPTOR 

An implicit component of this kind is associated by the compiler with each record 
component whose subtype is an anonymous record subtype that depends on a 
discriminant of the record. It contains information about the component subtype. 

The structure of an implicit component of kind RECORD_DESCRIPTOR is not described 
in this documentation. Nevertheless, if a programmer is interested in specifying the 
location of a component of this kind using a component clause, the size of the 
component may be obtained using the ASSEMBLY parameter in the COMPILE 
command. 

The compiler treats an implicit component of the kind RECORD JDESCRIPTOR as 
having an anonymous array type. If C is the name of the record component whose 
subtype is described by the record descriptor, then this implicit component can be 
denoted in a component clause by the implementation generated name 
CRECORD_DESCRIPTOR. This allows user control over the position of the implicit 
component in the record. 


Suppression of Implicit Components 

The Alsys implementation provides the capability of suppressing the implicit 
components RECORD_SIZE and/orVARIANT INDEX from a record type. This can be 
done using an implementation defined pragma called IMPROVE. The syntax of this 
pragma is as follows: 

pragma IMPROVE (TIME | SPACE, [ON *» >] simple_name ); 

The first argument specifies whether TIME or SPACE is the primary criterion for the 
choice of the representation of the record type that is denoted by the second argument 

If TIME is specified, the compiler inserts implicit components as described above. If on 
the other hand SPACE is specified, the compiler only inserts a VARIANTJNDEX or a 
RECORD_SIZE component if this component appears in a record representation clause 
that applies to the record type. A record representation clause can thus be used to keep 
one implicit component while suppressing the other. 

A pragma IMPROVE that applies to a given record type can occur anywhere that a 
representation clause is allowed for this type.

4.8.4 Size of Record Types and Objects 

Size of a record subtype 

Unless a component clause specifies that a component of a record type has an offset or a 
size which cannot be expressed using storage units, the size of a record subtype is 
rounded up to a whole number of storage units. 

The size of a constrained record subtype is obtained by adding the sizes of its 
components and the sizes of its gaps (if any). This size is not computed at compile time 

■ when the record subtype has non-static constraints, 

• when a component is an array or a record and its size is not computed at compile 
time. 

The size of an unconstrained record subtype is obtained by adding the sizes of the 
components and the sizes of the gaps (if any) of its largest variant. If the size of a 
component or of a gap cannot be evaluated exactly at compile time an upper bound of 
this size is used by the compiler to compute the subtype size. 

A size specification applied to a record type or first named subtype has no effect. The 
only size that can be specified using such a length clause is its usual size. Nevertheless, 
such a length clause can be useful to verify that the layout of a record is as expected by 
the application. 


Size of an object of a record subtype 

An object of a constrained record subtype has the same size as its subtype. 

An object of an unconstrained record subtype has the same size as its subtype if this size 
is less than or equal to 8k bytes. If the size of the subtype is greater than this, the object 
has the size necessary to store its current value; storage space is allocated and released as 
the discriminants of the record change.

Address Clauses 


6.1 Address Clauses for Objects 

An address clause can be used to specify an address for an object as described in RM 13.5. 
When such a clause applies to an object the compiler does not cause storage to be 
allocated for the object The program accesses the object using the address specified in 
the clause. It is the responsibility of the user therefore to make sure that a valid 
allocation of storage has been done at the specified address. 

An address clause is not allowed for task objects, for unconstrained records whose size is 
greater than 8k bytes or for a constant 

There are a number of ways to compose a legal address expression for use in an address 
clause. The most direct ways are: 

■ For the case where the memory is defined in Ada as another object use the 
’ADDRESS attribute to obtain the argument for the address clause for the second 
object 

■ For the case where the desired location is memory defined in assembly or another 
non-Ada language (is relocatable), an interfaced routine may be used to obtain the 
appropriate address from referencing information known to the other language. 

• For the case where an absolute address is known to the programmer, use the 
function SYSTEM.VALUE. This function has one (1) parameter of type string. The 
string is of the form 'ssss:0000*. The length is 9, and the is required to separate 
the segment and offset portion of the address. SY5TEM.VALUE returns a value of 
type SYSTEMADDRESS. The string representing the desired address can be passed 
as the actual parameter to SYSTEM.VALUE in the simple expression part of the 
address clause. See Section 3 for the specification of package SYSTEM. 

In all cases other than the use of an address attribute, the programmer must ensure 
that the segment part of the argument is a selector if the program is to run in 
protected mode. Refer to the Application Developers’ Guide, Section 5.1.5 for more 
information on protected mode machine oriented programming.

8.6 Access Protection of External Files 


All BTOSII access protections exist when using files under BTOSIL If a file is open for 
read only access by one process it can not be opened by another process for read/write 
access. 


8.7 The Need to Close a File Explicitly 

The Runtime Executive will flush all buffers and close all open files when the program is 
terminated, either normally or through some exception. 

However, the RM does not define what happens when a program terminates without 
closing all the opened files. Thus a program which depends on this feature of the 
Runtime Executive might have problems when ported to another system. 


8.8 Limitation on the Procedure RESET 

An internal file opened for input cannot be RESET for output. However, an internal file 
opened for output can be RESET for input, and can subsequently be RESET back to 
output. 


8.9 Sharing of External Files and Tasking Issues 

Several internal files can be associated with the same external file only if all the internal 
files are opened with mode IN_MODR However, if a file is opened with mode 
OUT_MODE and then changed to IN_MODE with the RESET procedure, it cannot be 
shared. 

Care should be taken when performing multiple input-output operations on an external 
file during tasking because the order of calls to the I/O primitives is unpredictable. For 
example, two strings output by TEXT_IO.Pt JTJJNE in two different tasks may appear in 
the output file with interleaved characters. Synchronization of I/O in cases such as this is 
the user’s responsibility. 

The TEXTJO files STANDARDJNPUT and STaNDARD_OUTPUT are shared by all 
tasks of an Ada program. 

If TEXT_IO.STANDARD_INPUT is not redirected, it will not block a program on input. 
All tasks not waiting for input will continue running. 


48 


Appendix F, Version 5 




Note that due to the definitions of line terminator, page terminator, and file terminator 
in the RM, and the method used to mark the end of file under BTOSII, some ASCII files 
do not represent well-formed TEXTJO files. 

A text file is buffered by the Runtime Executive unless 

■ it names a device (for example, [VID]). 

• it is STANDARD_INPUT or STANDARD_OUTPUT and has not been redirected. 

If not redirected, prompts written to STAND ARD_OUTPUT with the procedure PUT will 
appear before (or when) a GET (or GETJJNE) occurs. 

The functions END_OF_PAGE and END_OFJFILE always return FALSE when the file is a 
device and STANDARD_INPUT when it is not redirected. Programs which would like to 
check for end of file when the file may be a device should handle the exception 
ENDERROR instead, as in the following example: 


Example 

begin 

loop 

-- Display the prompt: 

TEXTJO.PUT {■--> «); 

-- Read tha next line: 

TEXTJO.GET_l.IW (COHttlB, LAST); 

-- Now do something with COMHAND (1 .. LAST) 
end loop; 
exception 

when TEXTJO.EHO_ERROR *» 
null; 


END_ERROR is raised for STANDARDJNPUT when F6 (ASCII.SUB) is entered at the 
keyboard. 


Input-Output Packages 


47 




If a non-existing directory is specified in a file path name to CREATE, the directory will 
not be created, and the exception NAME_ERROR is raised. 


8.2 Error Handling 

BTOSII errors are translated into Ada exceptions, as defined in the RM by package 
IO_EXCEPTIONS. In particular, DEVICE_ERROR is raised in cases of .LDrive not 
ready,.LErrors:drive not ready,drive not ready, .IUnknown media;.i.Errors:unlcnown 
media;unknown media, .i.Disk full;.i.Errors:disk fulljdisk full or .LHardware 
errors;.i.Errors:hardware;hardware errors on the disk (such as read or write fault). 


8.3 Sequential Files 

For sequential access the file is viewed as a sequence of values that are transferred in the 
order of their appearance (as produced by the program or run-time environment). This 
is sometimes called a stream file in other operating systems. Each object in a sequential 
file has the same binary representation as the Ada object in the executable program. 


8.4 Direct Files 


For direct access the file is viewed as a set of elements occupying consecutive positions 
a linear order. The position of an clement in a direct file is specified by its index, which 
an integer of subtype POSmVE_COUNT. 


DIRECT_IO only allows inpul-output for constrained types. If DIRECTJO is instantiated 
for an unconstrained type, all calls to CREATE or OPEN will raise USEJSRROR. Each 
object in a direct file will have the same binary representation as the Ada object in the 
executable program. All elements within the file will have the same length. 


8.5 Text Files 

Text files are used for the input and output of information in ASCII character form. 
Each text file is a sequence of characters grouped into lines, and lines are grouped into a 
sequence of pages. 

All text file column numbers, line numbers, and page numbers are values of the subtype 
PQsmVE_COUNT.

Section 8 


Input-Output Packages 


The RM defines the predefined input-output packages SEQUENTIALIO, DIRECTJO, 
and TEXT JO, and describes how to use the facilities available within these packages. 
The RM also defines the package IO_EXCEPTIONS, which specifies the exceptions that 
can be raised by the predefined input-output packages. 

In addition the RM outlines the package LOW_LEVELJO, which is concerned with low- 
level machine-dependent input-output, such as would possibly be used to write device 
drivers or access device registers. LOWJJEVELJO has not been implemented. The use 
of interfaced subprograms is recommended as an alternative. 


8.1 Correspondence between External Files and BTOS n 
Files 

Ada input-output is defined in terms of external files. Data is read from and written to 
external files. Each external file is implemented as a standard BTOS n file, including the 
use of STANDARD JNPUT and STANDARD_OUTPUT. 

The name of an external file can be either 

• the null string 

• a BTOS II filename 

If the name is a null string, the associated external file is a temporary file and will cease 
to exist when the program is terminated. The file will be placed in the current directory 
and its name will be chosen by BTOS II. 

If the name is a filename, the filename will be interpreted according to standard BTOS II 
conventions (that is, relative to the current directoiy). The exception NAMEJERROR is 
raised if the filename has more than SO characters. 

If an existing BTOS II file is specified to the CREATE procedure, the contents of the file 
will be deleted before writing to the file.

Unchecked Conversions 


Unchecked type conversions are described in [13.10.2]. The following restrictions apply 
to their use: 

• Unconstrained arrays are not allowed as target types. Unconstrained record types 
without defaulted discriminants are not allowed as target types. Access types to 
unconstrained arrays are not allowed as target or source types. Notes also that 
UNCHECKED_CONVERSION cannot be used for an access to an unconstrained 
string. 

■ If the target type has a smaller size than the source type then the target is made of 
the least significant bits of the source. 

If the sou ce and the target types are each of scalar or access type or if they are both of 
composite type, the effect of the function is to return the operand. 

In other cases the effect of unchecked conversion can be considered as a copy. 

• If an unchecked conversion of a scalar or access source type to a composite target 
type is performed, the result is a copy of the source operand. The result has the size 
of the source. 

■ If an unchecked conversion of a composite source type to a scalar or access target 
type is performed, the result is a copy of the source operand. The result has the size 
of the target

Other Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


10.1 Characteristics of the Heap 

All objects created by allocators go into the heap. Also, portions of the Runtime Execu¬ 
tive representation of task objects, including the task stacks, are allocated in the heap. 

UNCHECKED_DEALLOCATION is implemented for all Ada access objects except access 
objects to tasks. Use of UNCHECKED J3EAIXOCATION on a task object will lead to 
unpredictable results. 

All objects whose visibility is linked to a subprogram, task body, or block have their 
storage reclaimed at exit, whether the exit is normal or due to an exception. Effectively 
pragma CONTROLLED is automatically applied to all access types. Moreover, all 
compiler temporaries on the heap (generated by such operations as function calls 
returning unconstrained arrays, or many concatenations) allocated in a scope are 
deallocated upon leaving the scope. 

Note that the programmer may force heap reclamation of temporaries associated with 
any statements by enclosing the statement in a begin.. end block. This is especially 
useful when complex concatenations or other heap-intensive operations are performed 
in loops, and can reduce or eliminate STORAGE_ERRORs that might otherwise occur. 

The maximum size of the heap is limited only by available memory. This includes the 
amount of physical memory (RAM) and the amount of virtual memory (hard disk swap 
space). 


10.2 Characteristics of Tasks 

The default task stack size is IK bytes (32K bytes for the environment task), but by using 
the Binder option STACK-TASK the size for all task stacks in a program may be set to a 
size from IK bytes to 64K bytes. 


Other Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


51 


Normal priority rules are followed for preemption, where PRIORITY values are in the 
range 1.. 10. A task with undefined priority (no pragma PRIORITY) is considered to be 
lower than priority 1. 

The maximum number of active tasks is restricted only by memory usage. 

The accepter of a rendezvous executes the accept body code in its own stack. 
Rendezvous with an empty accept body (for synchronization) does not cause a context 
switch. 

The main program waits for completion of all tasks dependent upon library packages 
before terminating. 

Abnormal completion of an aborted task takes place immediately, except when the ab¬ 
normal task is the caller of an entry that is engaged in a rendezvous, or if it is in the 
process of activating some tasks. Any such task becomes abnormally completed as soon 
as the state in question is exited. 

The message 

GLOBAL BLOCKING SITUATION DETECTED 

is printed to STANDARD_OUTPUT when the Runtime Executive detects that no further 
progress is possible for any task in the program. The execution of the program is then 
abandoned. 

10.3 Definition of a Main Subprogram 

A library unit can be used as a main subprogram if and only if it is a procedure that is not 
generic and that has no formal parameters. 


10.4 Ordering of Compilation Units 

The Alsys Ada Software Development Environment for BTOS II imposes no additional 
ordering constraints on compilations beyond those required by the language.

Section 11 


Limitations 


11.1 Compiler Limitations 

• The maximum identifier length is 255 characters. 

• The maximum line length is 255 characters. 

• The maximum number of unique identifiers per compilation unit is 2500. 

• The maximum number of compilation units in a library is 1000. 

■ The maximum number of Ada libraries in a family is 15. 


11.2 Hardware Related Limitations 

• The maximum amount of data in the heap is limited only by available memory. 

• If an unconstrained record type can exceed 4096 bytes, the type is not permitted 
(unless constrained) as the element type in the definition of an array or record type. 

■ The maximum size of the generated code for a single compilation unit is 65535 
bytes. 

• The maximum size of a single array or record object is 65522 bytes. An object 
bigger than 4096 bytes will be indirectly allocated. Refer to ALLOCATION 
parameter in the COMPILE command. (Section 4.2 of the User’s Guide.) 

■ The maximum size of a single stack frame is 32766 bytes, including the data for 
inner package subunits unnested to the parent frame. 

■ The maximum amount of data in the global data area is 65535 bytes, including 
compiler generated data that goes into the GDA (about 8 bytes per compilation un.. 
plus 4 bytes per externally visible subprogram).
