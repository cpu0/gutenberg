Programming in AWIPS I 


• Limited scope of programmers 

• Most users could only modify 

- Data 

- Configuration 
— Menus 

- Shell/Perl scripts 

- Database mods

Enter AWIPS II 


• Raytheon Technical Services Co. (RTSC) 

• NWS Technology Infusion (AWIPS follow-on) 

• Open source, Java-based 

• Service Oriented Architecture 

• Extensible, Plugin-based 

OBJECTIVE: Collaborative development

AWIPS II Plugin Architecture 




• EDEX plugin - handles data ingest; persists data in internal storage 
(HDF5 files) and writes metadata in the PostgreSQL database. 

• DATA plugin - simply the container handling the data/metadata 
objects. 

• VISUALIZATION plugin - communicates with the DATA plugin to 
retrieve data and write to CAVE resources.

What's needed for AWIPS II developers 

• All Application Developers 

— Java; Python; Eclipse; XML; Subversion 

• Application Integrators 

— JMS(ActiveMQ); ESB (Camel); MicroEngine 

• Database Access Developers 

— Java DAO; Hibernate; Spring; EDEX; HDF5 

• Graphical Interface Developers 

- CAVE; Eclipse RCP; SWT+Jface; SVG

Lightning Mapping Array 


Total lightning data from 
Lightning Mapping Arrays 
(LMAs) is 3-Dimensional, 
unable to be brought into 
AWIPS I - except as model 
data. We expect to make 
use of future AWIPS II 3D 
capabilities. 

LMA data is generated as 
ASCII, but we write as 
unique NetCDF - requiring 
a new EDEX plugin.

Lightning Tracking Tool 


Total lightningyY/mps are at 
times related to severe 
weather. Forecasters need 
to quickly track several 
storms separately, tracking 
their intensity. 

-Track multiple cells 
-Variable radii 
-Adjustable storm tracking 
-Color-coded chart for each 
data layer 

-Extrapolation for new data 
(frames)

NOAA HMS: Smoke & Fire 


NOAA's Hazard Mapping 
System Hot Spot and Smoke 
data required new plugins 
because the hot spot point 
data needed special 
visualization (time- 
grouping) and the smoke 
regions needed special 
ingest code (KML). 


DOM parser required

CAVI.OAX - 07D 


Satellite /MclDAS AREA 


We deal with a lot of data in 
MclDAS "AREA" format. 

We're using Raytheon's 
extension of NCEP's MclDAS 
plugin. We're using the 
existing AWIPS II satellite 
plugin for visualization.

Convective Initiation 

GOES-based data set 
generated at UAHuntsville 
for short-term forecasts of 
convection. 

Simple NetCDF format, but 
not natively read by AWIPS 
II. We wrote both EDEX and 
visualization plugins.

Programming experiences 


• Java and associated tools/parts are complex 

• Frequent updates usually meant changing our 
plugins 

• Lack of documentation made it harder 

• We're beginning to need software management 
tools

Plans 


• Prepare plugins, colormaps, bundles for all 
current AWIPS I SPoRT products 

• Create and/or extend plugins for upcoming 
datasets 

— Improve RGB with true 24-bit viz 
— Possible 3D viz efforts 
- Possible multi-byte datasets

Summary 


• SPoRT is preparing for AWIPS II 

• AWIPS I offered very limited programming 

• AWIPS II offers exciting opportunities for 
handling new data sets and visualization 
capabilities 

• Documentation is badly needed
