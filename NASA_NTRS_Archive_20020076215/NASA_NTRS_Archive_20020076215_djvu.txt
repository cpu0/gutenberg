Individualized Communications 


n nnovative ways that a company can reach large 
audiences on a one-on-one, personalized basis 
becomes practical using InrelliWeb™ and. 
IntelliPrint™. These products are available from 
MicroMass Communications™, Inc of Raleigh, North 
Carolina, 

Established in 1994, MicroMass is a communica- 
tions software company devoted to helping their clients 
communicate individually with each member of a 
company’s customer base. 

The first commercially- released product from 
MicroMass is IntelliWeb, a full-featured website 
personalization tool. MicroMass also provides 
IntelliPrint, a product designed to create tailored, 
individualized messages via printed media. 


Based on a JVdSd software system, 

IntelliWeb allows risers to personalize their 
websites. 

At the heart of these MicroMass personalization 
technologies is CLIPS. Computer technicians at 
Johnson Space Center produced CLIPS, a development 
and delivery expert system tool. CLIPS stands for C 
Language Integrated Production System,, It provides a 
cohesive software tool for handling a wide variety of 
knowledge with support for three different program- 
ming paradigms: rule-based, object-oriented, and 
procedural, CLIPS was made available to MicroMass 
Communications through the Computer Software 
Management and Information Center (COSMIC®) in 
Athens, Georgia, 

“By embracing CLIPS and its expert system 
technology, our personalization products can make 
expert* content selections. This has put our products in 


an elite group,” says Mark Rinehart, MicroMass* 
director of systems engineering. 

IntelliWeb delivers personalized messages by 
dynamically creating single web pages or entire web sites 
based on information provided by each website visitor. 

A key feature of the product is that a user need not wade 
through volumes to get to sentences. IntelliWeb 
developers tie content databases to expert system-based 
mlcs/facts databases. These are activated when a visitors 
information is either entered via a standard HTML form 
or provided from a customer database. Also, the 
databases are triggered when the users own personal 
IntelliWeb profile is supplied. 

IntelliPrint uses proprietary technology to generate 
printed messages that are personally relevant and 

tailored to meet each individual s needs. Over 
time, IntelliPrint establishes a dialogue with 
each customer using individual customer 
feedback. This information is then utilized to 
create timely, relevant and enduring person- 
alized messages. 

“IntelliPrint dramatically changes the 
way people have traditionally communi- 
cated,” says David Bulger, MicroMass 
chairman and CEO. Historically, people have 
only been able to communicate on either a 
micro (one-to-one) or mass (one-to-many) 
level, he explains. 

Examples of IntelliPrint in operation are 
numerous. For instance, Bristol-Myers 
Squibb, in conjunction with MicroMass, 
developed a personalized newsletter, Living at 
Your Best. The newsletter content was geared 
to each recipient based on a health and 
lifestyle survey taken earlier. 

IntelliPrint also is the core technology behind 
SmithKIine Beechams Nicorette Committed Quitters^ 3 
Program. This 1 2- week program was built by 
MicroMass using IntelliPrint software, coupled to the 
latest in demand printing technology. Participants are 
provided individually customized motivational materials 
to support their attempt to stop smoking. 

“Our system combines the intimacy of very 
personal, micro communication with the reach of mass 
communication, enabling our clients to develop and 
sustain interactive conversations with millions of 
people,” Bulger says.
