DOCUMENTATION AND 
DEBUGGING — BASICS OF 
EFFECTIVE PROGRAMMING 

Dear Sir : 

You may want to argue with Toby Riley during his presentation of the Computer 
Program Documentation & Debugging seminar. As a matter of fact, we hope you will, 
because the ground he covers involves two controversial aspects of programming that 
are not often approached in terms of objective standards. 

— Ri l ey has some firm beliefs about documentation and debugging acquired over a 

ten -year career in programming and programmer management. Working for a company 
that built its reputation largely in development of computer software on a contract 
basis, Riley 1 s beliefs are, frankly, colored by the need to deliver computer pro- 
grams on time, to specifications, and within a budget. 

If you have seen programming money slurp down the drain because of inadequate 
(or over-adequate) documentation, or through debugging that cost too much man time 
and machine time, you may have considered such possible causes as: 

• Informal or non-existant training in two basic programming skills --docu- 
mentation and debugging. 

• The absence of practical standards for defining and managing the docu- 
mentation and debugging tasks . 

That’s what this seminar is concerned with. Designed for both the programmer 
and the programming manager, it covers documentation and debugging from A to Z at 
a practical, working level. In each area it first defines the subject, then reviews 
current practices, and winds up with an outline for workable performance standards. 

You may have concluded at this point that Riley figures he knows it all. He 

doesn’t. And the conclusions reached in this seminar won’t necessarily be his own-- 

he expects you to come prepared to argue the point whenever you think he’s off the 
track. The idea. is to open up discussion and lead it to a consensus acceptable to 
the entire group. 

We said that a good part of C-E-I-R’s reputation is built on its* performance 
in computer software development. And that Riley, in his years with IBM and 
C-E-I-R has developed a healthy appreciation and understanding of the importance of 
documentation and debugging. 

An example of what we mean is C-E-I-R’s development of a resource allocation 
model (under the lecturer’s direction) with the E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company. 

This program consists of more than 8,500 FORTRAN statements, and was under develop- 
ment for two years. Throughout this period, programmers, mathematicians, and 
engineers were kept in constant communication regarding development of algorithms, 
practicality of the approach, and data processing problems. Tbe program was sub- 
jected to in-house testing, then on-site field testing in several different client 
locations, each with different conditions. 



- 2 - 

In every instance, the documentation had to he complete for each of the different 
staffs involved during the year the program -underwent field tests. This documenta- 
tion included program lists, explanation of algorithms, test correspondence, training 
texts and user ! s guides. Tasks such as this one helped C-E-I-R (and Riley) appre- 
ciate the problems of programming for multi-installation use, and meeting a variety 
of specifications for a common program. 

During this seminar you will be asked to consider the problem of meaningful 
problem definition, and answer the question of what to document, and when to docu- 
ment it, and why. 

Each participant is asked to bring along two computer programs: one that you be- 
lieve to represent most features of a well-documented program, and a second program 
that you will use in a cl ass exercise. 

In the class problem you will see your second program processed by two automatic 
documentation systems, {Flowcharter and the Symbolic Block Diagram System], both 
run on the 7090 at C-E-I-R 1 s computing center. You will discuss and evaluate the 
results of these systems, and consider other special documenting routines that can 
be written or used by programmers. 

The sessions on documentation will be supplemented by a vist to a local computer 
installation to study its implementation of documentation procedures. 

This seminar will benefit any practicing programmer or programmer manager by 
focusing his attention on important aspects of his job whose proper handling can: 

• Extend program life by simplifying the job of making changes and conversions. 

• Improve manager -programmer communication by setting ground rules for objec- 
tives, methods and status reporting. 

• Facilitate the exchange of information between programmers and thereby better 
coordinate the group effort. 

• Reduce the amount of man and machine time spent in program debuggin g . 

• Increase the efficiency -- and reduce the cost -- of the programming 
operation. 

This seminar will be given October 2 6, 27 and 28 at the Statler-Hilton Hotel in 
Washington, D.C. These are three days that can help you advance your professional 
career. Circle them on your calendar now, and mail the enclosed registration form. 

We look forward to meeting you.

C-E-I-R SEMINAR COVERS 
SYSTEM 360 LANGUAGE, 

CURRENT COBOL PRACTICE 
Dear Sir: 

If your job involves use and selection of computer languages, the Programming 
Languages seminar will help you achieve the informed view you need to mato? these 
important decisions. 

This seminar, presented in Washington, D. C., November 16-17-18, covers 
compilers, assemblers, interpreters and translators. The subject matter is organ- 
ized in a meaningful framework to examine their applications and their advantages 
and disadvantages. 

The principal instructor is Howard Bromberg, a member of the programming 
profession whose experience includes service on national and international com- 
mittees dealing with programming languages and their standardization. 

The language field in general is covered first, and then attention is focused 
in greater detail on two languages of major importance for today and for the 
future — COBOL and PL/l. Included in the COBOL section is a class problem which 
you will code in COBOL and see the result after it is compiled on an IBM JOJO at 

C-E-I-R* s computing center. 

PL/l is considered from the viewpoint of the language organization, its 
implementation, and its likely effect on computer programming in the future. 

Your participation in this seminar will bring you up to date on current 
developments and practices in computer language application, and, in addition, help 
you to a clearer understanding of the re -programming problem raised by PL/l. 

We hope that you or a member of your organization will mail the enclosed 
registration card and take part in this helpful analysis of computer programming 
languages and their application. 



Sincerely,

management scientists and others from a 
variety of disciplines. In addition, many of 
the finest scientific and professional men in 
America are retained on a consultant basis. 
Augmenting this professional capability are 
modern electronic computing equipment, 
and skilled computer programmers and op- 
erations personnel at computing centers in 
five major U.S. cities, London, The Hague 
and Mexico City.

sion of C-E-I-R’s 
long-standing involvement in management 
education. The revolutionary nature of com- 
puter-based methods made education an in- 
tegral part of C-E-l-R operations from the 
beginning. This relationship is formalized 
through the Institute for Advanced Tech- 
nology. IAT faculty members are drawn 
primarily from the ranks of C-E-I-R's pro- 
fessional and computer operations staffs. 
Its curriculum is drawn from subjects in 
which C-E-l-R staff members are expert- 
recognized for excellence in day-to-day ap- 
plication of the art and science of computer 
usage to the real problems of C-E-l-R cus- 
tomers in business and industry. Sharing 
these new skills through seminars in major 
cities, management clinics, and special, in- 
plant training programs is the major goal of 
the Institute for Advanced Technology. 


PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 

(With the Emphasis on PL/1 & COBOL) 

A three-day seminar 

This seminar is intended for those intimately involved 
in the selection and use of computer languages. It 
provides an overview of the major programming lan- 
guages and their advantages and disadvantages, with 
detailed presentations of the System 360 programming 
language (PL/ 1) and of COBOL. The PL/1 section 
covers the general organization of the language. The 
COBOL section is an introductory presentation in which 
the latest CODASYL publication is used to indicate 
the language’s scope, advantages and disadvantages. 
Tuition, including luncheons and alt course materials, 
is $175 for one student and $155 for each added stu- 
dent from the same organization.

SYSTEM 360 LANGUAGE, 
CURRENT COBOL PRACTICE 

Dear Sir: 


If your job involves use and selection of computer languages, the Programming 
Languages seminar will help you achieve the informed view you need to make these 

important decisions. 

This seminar, presented in Washington, D. C., January 18-19-20, cover s 
compilers, assemblers, interpreters and translators. Hie subject matter is organ- 
ized in » Tr^arnngfnl framework to examine their applications and their advantages 

and disadvantages. 

The principal instructor is Howard Bromberg, a member of the programming 
profession whose experience includes service on national and international com- 
mittees dealing with programming languages and their standardization. 


The language field in general is covered first, and then attention is focused 
in greater detail on two languages of major importance for today and for the 
future — COBOL and PL/l. Included in the COBOL section is a class ^oblem whic 
you will code in COBOL and see the result after it is compiled on an I BM 7090 at 

C-E-I-R* s computing center. 


PL/1 is considered from the vie-wpoint of the language organization, its 
implementation, and its likely effect on computer programming in the future. 

Your participation in this seminar will bring you up to date on curren t 
developments and practices in computer language application, and, in audition, help 
you to a clearer understanding of the re -programming problem raised b y PL/1. 

We hope that you or a member of your organization will mail the enclosed 
registration card and take part in this helpful analysis of computer programming 
languages and their application.
