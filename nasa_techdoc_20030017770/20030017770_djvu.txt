ABSTRACT 

The Aircraft Morphing Program at NASA Langley 
envisions an aircraft without conventional control 
surfaces. Instead of moving control surfaces, the 
vehicle control systems may be implemented with a 
combination of propulsive forces, micro surface 
effectors, and fluidic devices dynamically operated by 
an intelligent flight control system to provide aircraft 
maneuverability over each mission segment. As a part 
of this program, a two-dimensional NACA 0015 airfoil 
model was designed to test mild maneuvering 
capability of synthetic jets in a subsonic wind tunnel. 
The objective of the experiments is to assess the 
applicability of using unsteady suction and blowing to 
alter the aerodynamic shape of an airfoil with a purpose 
to enhance lift and/or to reduce drag. Synthetic jet 
actuation at different chordwise locations, different 
forcing frequencies and amplitudes, under different 
freestream velocities are investigated. The effect of 
virtual shape change is indicated by a localized increase 
of surface pressure in the neighborhood of synthetic jet 
actuation. That causes a negative lift to the airfoil with 
an upper surface actuation. When actuation is applied 
near the airfoil leading edge, it appears that the 
stagnation line is shifted inducing an effect similar to 
that caused by a small angle of attack to produce an 
overall lift change.

1. INTRODUCTION 

New technologies and advanced materials, both 
nearly in hand and in early development, offer the 
potential to create revolutionary advances in aerospace 
vehicles with significantly greater performance and 
maneuvering compared to conventional approaches. 

Conventional airfoils of aerospace vehicles have 
been designed for a single flight condition and then 
modified to cover multiple flight conditions. This is 
done through the use of control surfaces, such as 
ailerons and flaps, spoilers, and variable wing sweep. 
Variable wing sweep affects changes in the local flow 
field by altering the flow velocity normal to the leading

edge of the airfoil. The control surfaces and spoilers 
affect changes in the flow field by directly varying the 
camber on certain regions of the airfoil, thereby causing 
changes in the baseline aerodynamic characteristics of 
the entire airfoil. 

The Aircraft Morphing Program at NASA Langley 
has been initiated with the goal to develop next 
generation aerospace vehicles by mimicking Nature. 
Efforts include providing muscle-like actuators to 
change aerodynamic form on demand, nervous-system- 
like sensing, self-healing materials, and adaptive fault- 
tolerant controls to enhance flight safety. One approach 
envisions future vehicles without conventional control 
surfaces that could lead to significant weight reductions 
or decrease the aircraft signature. Instead of moving 
control surfaces, the aerodynamic control systems may 
be implemented with a combination of thrust vectoring 
propulsion, adaptive micro-machined surface effectors, 
and distributed fluidic devices dynamically operated by 
an intelligent control system to provide aircraft 
maneuverability under different flight conditions. As a 
part of this program, a two-dimensional NACA 0015 
airfoil model was designed to test mild maneuvering 
capability of synthetic jets in the NASA Langley 2 ft x 
3 ft Tunnel. The objective of the experiments is to 
assess the applicability of using unsteady suction and 
blowing of synthetic jets to alter the aerodynamic shape 
of an airfoil to enhance lift and/or to reduce drag. 

Previous preliminary tests with a piston-type 
actuator indicate that the actuator has a net effect on the 
boundary-layer flow of producing a local net increase in 
the displacement thickness of the flow. Hence an 
effective shape change could approximate the effect of 
the synthetic jet actuator. Most recent works 1 " 6 on airfoil 
aerodynamic manipulation using synthetic jets has 
focused on the control of flow separation at moderate 
and large angles of attack. The experimental work done 
by Chatlynne et al. 7 showed that it is possible to modify 
the apparent aerodynamic shape of an airfoil at low 
angles of attack when the baseline flow is fully 
attached. However, this virtual aero-shaping was 
achieved by combining the activation of a high- 
frequency synthetic jet actuator placed downstream 
from a miniature surface-mounted passive obstruction 
(a little fence). This combination introduces a small 
stationary re-circulating flow region next to the surface, 
which displaces the local streamlines sufficiently to 
modify the local pressure distribution. The modified 
flow results in a significant reduction in pressure drag 
with a minimal loss of lift. Physically, the function of 
the synthetic jet actuator in this application is to force 
the separated flow downstream of the little fence to 
reattach to the surface. 



The work described in the present paper focuses on 
the aerodynamic virtual shaping of an airfoil at zero 
angle of attack, using only synthetic jets without 
additional fixtures. This represents an examination of 
the fluidic modification of aero-surfaces that does not 
necessarily rely on coupling to flow instability such as 
that inherently in separated flows. The effects of virtual 
shaping are investigated with synthetic jet actuation at 
different chordwise locations, different forcing 
frequencies and amplitudes, under different freestream 
velocities. Characteristics of electric power 
consumption of the synthetic jet actuator are also 
reported in this paper. 

2. APPARATUS 

2.1 Wind Tunnel Facility 

The experiment was conducted in the 2 ft x 3 ft 
Low-Speed Wind Tunnel located at the NASA Langley 
Research Center. The tunnel is a closed-loop type with 
a 10:1 contraction ratio. The test section is 91.4 cm 
wide by 61.0 cm high by 6.1 m long. The turbulence- 
reduction devices upstream of the contraction consist of 
a honeycomb followed by four stainless-steel screens. 
A vane-axial fan powered by a 30 horsepower DC 
motor is used to drive the tunnel. Speeds of 
approximately 45 m/sec are attainable in the test section 
with measured turbulence intensities, u/U„, of 
approximately 0.1% in the range of 0.1 <f< 400 Hz. 
The test-section ceiling and floor are adjustable to 
achieve a desired streamwise pressure gradient and 
accommodate various test conditions. Further details of 
the facility have been previously published. 8 

2.2 Airfoil Model 

The two-dimensional NACA 0015 airfoil model 
has the dimensions of 91 .4 cm span and 91 .4 cm chord. 
The model was made with a 0.3 cm thick lay-up of 
fiberglass skin supported by four internal chordwise 
ribs machined from 6061 -T6 aluminum alloy. There are 
six chordwise locations for installation of a synthetic jet 
actuator with a long exhaust slot centered spanwise on 
the model. Figures 1 (a), (b) and (c) show a side view, a 
cut-away view and a photograph of the airfoil model. 
The model was mounted to external mounts through the 
tunnel sidewalls by a spanwise-extended steel tube, as 
shown in the center of Figure 1(c). The surface finish 
on the airfoil surface was 1 micron or better. 

Three rows of streamwise pressure taps are located 
on the midspan, the right- and the left-quarter-spans on 
both upper and lower surfaces. The pressure taps are 
staggered in each row to minimize streamwise 
interference. The nominal orifice diameter of the 
pressure taps is 0.05 cm. Three 32-port 10-inch water- 



American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 



column ESP modules were connected to pressure taps 
to get the surface static pressure readings. Ten dynamic 
pressure transducers, two Kulite XCS-062-5D and eight 
Endevco 8510B-1, were distributed along the midspan 
with nine on the upper surface and one on the lower 
surface. Locations of the pressure taps and the dynamic 
pressure transducers are shown in the sketches of 
Figures 2(a) and (b). One row of spanwise pressure taps 
distributed near the trailing edge approximately at x/c = 
0.95, also shown in Figure 2(a), was used to check 
possible tunnel-sidewall contamination of the surface 
pressure readings. 

2.3 Synthetic Jet Actuator 

A long two-dimensional synthetic jet actuator, as 
shown in Figure 3, was installed across the airfoil span 
at one of six different chordwise locations for the test. 
These six actuator locations are at x/c = -0.015, 0.1, 
0.15, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.75 (the negative value was on the 
bottom side of the airfoil). One of the test purposes was 
to determine the optimal placement of the actuator on 
the airfoil for virtual shape change. The actuator 
consists of a continuous cavity enclosed by 14 pairs of 
piezoelectric diaphragms. Each pair of piezoelectric 
diaphragms was operated with a 180° phase differential 
at the same sinusoidal voltage and frequency. With 
actuation, a synthetic jet issued from a two-dimensional 
slot that is 76.2 cm long by 0.5 mm wide on the top 
plate of the device. Six top plates with different 
curvatures were made to fair the actuator to different 
chordwise locations on the airfoil model. A multi- 
channel attenuation unit was used to obtain the best 
uniformity of the synthetic jet across the airfoil span by 
adjusting the amplitude of power input to each pair of 
piezoelectric diaphragms. 

3. CHARACTERISTICS OF 
ACTUATOR 

The strength of synthetic jets generally is not 
uniform along the 76.2 cm spanwise slot due to 
irregularity in the piezoelectric diaphragms. After 
careful tuning with the attenuation unit, the best 
uniformity of the synthetic jet at the maximum 
performance condition (defined later) was obtained and 
shown in Figure 4. It shows slight variations of jet 
velocities along the slot centerline on the jet exit 
surface in the quiescent environment. The jet is slightly 
stronger in the position at top of the center of each 
piezoelectric diaphragm pair than that at top of the 
interval between two diaphragm pairs. 

Typical variations of jet velocities at the maximum 
performance condition with respect to the forcing 
frequency, in the range of 200 Hz to 1 700 Hz, at the 



slot center on jet exit surface, are shown in Figure 5. It 
presents two distinguished peaks at the frequencies 
around 600 Hz and 1300 Hz. These two peak 
frequencies correspond to the natural (mechanical) 
frequency of the piezoelectric diaphragm and the 
Helmholtz (acoustic) frequency of the actuator cavity, 
respectively. More detailed discussions of these 
resonant frequencies were given in a previous paper. 9 

The characteristics of electric power used to drive 
the piezoelectric diaphragms of the actuator at the 
forcing frequencies of 600 and 1300 Hz are shown in 
Figures 6 and 7, respectively. The electric power level 
was adjusted by varying the amplitude of sinusoidal 
voltage input through the multi-channel attenuation unit 
to a high-voltage power amplifier with a nominal gain 
of 100 before sending to the actuator. The input 
voltage, E tn , is the peak-to-peak amplitude of the 
sinusoidal voltage generated by a universal function 
generator. Figures 6(a) and 7(a) show variations of the 
effective values (in terms of standard deviations) of 
current, I eff , voltage, E eff , and the phase angle, 8, of 
voltage with respect to current, with the input voltage, 
E in . Generally the effective current and voltage increase 
with the input voltage but the phase angle decreases 
slightly from +90°. It indicates that the piezoelectric 
diaphragm deviates from a perfect capacitance device 
as the input voltage increases. Figures 6(b) and 7(b) 
show relations between the jet energy, in terms of 
variance of jet velocity, (v„„ s ) 2 , the active (P) and the 
reactive (0 electric powers with the input voltage, E tn . 
Note that the reactive power is plotted as Q/4 in the 
figures in order to compile data in the same scale. The 
active power, P, and the reactive power, Q, are defined 



P = E eff I effCOS9 
Q = E effIeffSine

(2) 



The performance of the piezoelectric diaphragm (hence, 
the actuator) can be enhanced by an offset of the input 
voltage that is shown as a step jump for the input 
voltage equal to and greater than 2.0 volts in the 
figures. The maximum performance condition of the 
piezoelectric diaphragm and the actuator was achieved 
at the input voltage of 2.3 volts with an offset of 0.6 
volts. Data at the maximum performance condition are 
plotted in Figures 8(a) and 8(b) against the forcing 
frequency. The active power is closely correlated with 
the jet output as seen in the (b) plot of Figures 6, 7 and 
8. The reactive power is due to the capacitive nature of 
the actuator. The magnitude of the reactive power is 
always greater than the active power in this device. It is 
very interesting to see that the performance peaks, 
approximately at 600 and 1300 Hz, happen when the 



American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 



phase angle between voltage and current is small and 
the reactive power is low, as shown in Figures 8(a) and 
8(b). The active power is very indicative of the phase 
matching of the driving frequency to the resonance 
mode of the synthetic jet as seen by the peaks in active 
power and jet output in Figure 8(b). The differing 
character of the peak active power at the Helmholtz 
resonance versus the mechanical resonance may be 
indicative of the more complex non-linear coupling in 
the system. The data hints at the potential of monitoring 
the active power as a potential tuning tool to maintain 
the excitation near resonance of the actuator. 

4. VIRTUAL SHAPING USING 
SYNTHETIC JETS 

The effect of virtual shape change on the airfoil 
model was detected by comparing the measurements of 
airfoil surface pressures with the synthetic jet actuation 
on and off. Typical variations of the surface pressure 
coefficient, C p , with actuation on and off on the upper 
and the lower surfaces are shown in Figures 9(a) and 
9(b), respectively. Customarily the C p scale is inverted 
in the plot. It clearly indicates a localized increase of 
the surface pressure in the neighborhood of synthetic jet 
actuation. That causes a negative lift on the airfoil with 
the actuator located on the upper surface. This negative 
lift change is consistent with numerical simulations of 
Hassan. 11 Note that, at zero angle of attack, there is zero 
lift for the baseline (without actuation) NACA 0015 
airfoil due to the geometric symmetry. The computed 
C p from the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes solver 
CFL3D 12 for the baseline airfoil (also included in the 
figures) show a good match with the measured no- 
control data. There is no discernible spanwise variation 
of C p by comparing the three rows of streamwise 
pressure readings along the midspan, the right- and the 
left-quarter-spans on both upper and lower surfaces, 
denoted as UpperC, UpperR, UpperL, LowerC, 
LowerR, and LowerL in the figures. Typical C p 
distributions from spanwise pressure taps near the 
trailing edge with the synthetic jet actuation on/off, 
under the same flow conditions as Figure 9, are 
presented in Figure 10. It indicates no discernible 
sidewall contamination on the C p data. 

Presumably virtual shaping is by nature an inviscid 
local phenomena rather than a convective one such as 
separation control. The status of the boundary layer, 
either laminar or turbulent, is assumed to be a minor 
effect on virtual shaping. Power spectra of pressure 
fluctuations obtained by dynamic pressure transducers, 
such as the one shown in Figure 1 1 , were used to verify 
the boundary layer conditions. To investigate the effect 
of boundary-layer transition on virtual shaping, a 1.27 



cm wide tape with randomly distributed #35 Grit was 
used to trip the boundary layer at x/c = 0.12 on the 
airfoil upper surface. Figure 12 shows that the 
boundary-layer trip moved the transition boundary 
(laminar data on left-hand side) to a lower freestream 
velocity but no discernible difference on airfoil lift 
change due to synthetic jet actuation for data between 
trip (turbulent data) and no -trip (laminar data) transition 
boundaries except normal data scattering. 

Typical variations of airfoil lift change with forcing 
frequency, when the actuator was driven at the 
maximum performance condition (i.e., input 2.3 volts 
and offset 0.6 volts), are shown in Figure 13. The 
change of lift coefficient, AC h is presented as a 
percentage of the airfoil upper surface lift, C lm , that has 
a nominal value of 0.23. Two negative lift peaks in 
Figure 13 correspond to the jet energy peaks as shown 
in Figure 8(b). Variations of airfoil lift change, 
AC t /C lm , with jet momentum coefficient, C^, are 
presented in Figures 14(a) to 14(d) for the actuator 
located at x/c = 0.1, 0.15, 0.3 and 0.5 on the airfoil 
upper surface. Data are presented for the actuator 
operated at peak forcing frequencies of 600 Hz and 
1300 Hz with varying input voltages and freestream 
velocities. Generally the lift change increases with C^ 
and actuation chordwise coordinate after x/c = 0.15. 
However, the lift change decreases for actuation at x/c = 
0.75 as shown in Figure 15. Numerical computations 
verified that the laminar boundary layer separation 
occurred at x/c = 0.53. It indicates that virtual shaping 
by synthetic jet actuation is much less effective in 
separated flow. In the range of data tested, the 
maximum lift change was -0.015 that resulted in a -6% 
change in AC l /C lm with actuation at x/c = 0.5, as 
shown in Figure 14(d). An attempt to correlate the data 
shown in Figures 14(a) to 14(d) is presented in Figure 
16 with a fitted line of Y = -17*X 025 where X and Y 
represent the lumped variables for the x and y 
coordinates, respectively. The correlation result implies 
that virtual shaping by synthetic jet actuation is 
inversely proportional to the Reynolds number and the 
local logarithmic pressure gradient but increases 
(negative lift) with the jet momentum coefficient. 

When synthetic jet actuation was near the leading 
edge (x/c = -0.015), it appeared that the stagnation line 
was shifted inducing an effect similar to that caused by 
a small positive angle of attack to produce an overall 
positive lift increase. Figures 17(a) and 17(b) show 
typical C p distributions on the airfoil upper and lower 
surfaces, respectively. Variations of lift increase with 
respect to the jet energy and the forcing frequency is 
compiled in Figure 18 with the actuator driven at the 
maximum performance condition. The increase of lift 
does not closely follow the peak of jet energy because 



American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 



the increase of lift is saturated at C^ ~ 0.003, when U rjo ~ 
10 m/sec, as indicated in Figure 19. Variations of lift 
increase with jet momentum coefficient under different 
freestream velocities are shown in Figures 20(a) to 
20(d) for data at forcing frequencies of 600 Hz and 
1300 Hz only. Lift increase and jet momentum 
coefficient are correlated as a function of Reynolds 
number and presented in Figure 21 with two fitted lines, 
Y= 230 + 72*logXand Y= 260 + 72*logX, for forcing 
frequencies of 600 Hz and 1300 Hz, respectively. 
Where X and Y represent the lumped variables for the x 
and y coordinates. 

The effect of virtual shaping on the airfoil pressure 
drag coefficient, C dp , is never greater than 0.002 under 
any circumstance of this investigation. Most of the time 
it is negligible therefore not included for discussion. 

5. SUMMARY 

Aerodynamic virtual shaping of a two-dimensional 
NACA 0015 airfoil were investigated in the NASA 
Langley 2 ft x 3 ft Tunnel, using a synthetic jet actuator 
at different chordwise locations, different forcing 
frequencies and amplitudes, under different freestream 
velocities. Important characteristics of electric power 
consumption of the synthetic jet actuator were also 
reported. Results are summarized as follows: 

1 . Synthetic jet energy is closely correlated to the 
active power consumed by the actuator. The data 
hints at the potential of monitoring the active 
power as a potential tuning tool to maintain the 
excitation near resonance of the actuator. 

2. Performance of the synthetic jet actuator increases 
when the magnitude of reactive power and the 
phase lag of voltage to current are decreasing. 

3. Synthetic jet actuation on the airfoil upper surface 
causes a localized increase of surface pressure that 
results in a negative lift to the airfoil. In the range 
of data tested, the maximum lift change was -0.015 
that resulted in a -6% change in AC t /C t m with 
actuation at 50% of chord. 

4 . Effect of virtual shaping is drastically decreased 
when synthetic jet actuation is applied under 
separated flow. 

5 . The stagnation line is shifted by synthetic jet 

actuation near the airfoil leading edge, inducing an 

effect similar to that caused by a small angle of 

attack to produce an overall lift change. 

Synthetic jets represent a breakthrough in actuator 

technology, but further development is required to 

substantially increase jet momentum output before 

applying them to real flight vehicles.
