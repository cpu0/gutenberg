INTRODUCTION 


The Ada implementation described above was tested according to the 
Ada Validation Procedures [Pro90J against the Ada Standard [Ada83] 
using the current Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC). This 
Validation Summary Report (VSR) gives an account of the testing of 
this Ada implementation. For any technical terms used in this 
report, the reader is referred to [Pro90]. A detailed description 
of the ACVC m?y be found in the current ACVC User's Guide (UG89).

1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. 
The ACVC contains a collection of test programs structured into six 
test classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test 
name identifies the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and 
E tests are executable. Class B and class L tests are expected to 
produce errors at compile time and link time, respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and 
produce a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result when they are executed. Three Ada library units, the 
packages REPORT and SPPRT13, and the procedure CHECK_FILE are used 
for this purpose. The package REPORT also provides a set of 
identity functions used to defeat some compiler optimizations 
allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test objective. 
The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the Ada 
Standard. The procedure CHECKFILE is used to check the contents 
of text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 
of the Ada Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK FILE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. If these units are not 
operating correctly, validation testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. 
Class B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is 
compiled and the resulting compilation listing is examined to 
verify that all violations of the Ada Standard are detected. Some 
of the class B tests contain legal Ada code which must not be 
flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects 
violation of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately 
compiled units. Errors are expected at link time, and execution is 
attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be 
replaced by implementation-specific values — for example, the 
largest integer. A list of the values used for this implementation 
is provided in Appendix A. In addition to these anticipated test 
modifications, additional changes may be required to remove 
unforeseen conflicts between the tests and implementation-dependent 
characteristics. The modifications required for this 
implementation are described in section 2.3. 


1-2 









For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by 
the AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications 
described in the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see 
section 2.1) and, possibly some inapplicable tests (see Section 3.2 
and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each 
test of the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


2.1 WITHDRAWN TESTS 

Some tests are withdrawn by the AVO from the ACVC because they do 
not conform to the Ada Standard. The following 95 tests had been 
withdrawn by the Ada Validation Organization (AVO) at the time of 
validation testing. The rationale for withdrawing each test is 
available from either the AVO or the AVF. The publication date for 
this list of withdrawn tests is 91-08-02.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are 
irrelevant for a given Ada implementation. The inapplicability 
criteria for some tests are explained in documents issued by ISO 
and the AJPO known as Ada Commentaries and commonly referenced in 
the format Al-ddddd. For this implementation, the following tests 
were determined to be inapplicable for the reasons indicated; 
references to Ada Commentaries are included as appropriate. 

The following 201 tests have floating-point type declarations 
requiring more digits than SYSTEM.MAX_DIGITS: 

C24113L..Y (14 tests) C35705L..Y (14 tests) 

C35706L..Y (14 tests) C35707L..Y (14 tests) 

C35708L..Y (14 tests) C35802L..Z (15 tests)

C45641L..Y (14 tests) C46012L..Z (15 tests) 

The following 20 tests check for the predefined type LONG_lNTEGER; 
for this implementation, there is no such type:

C35713B, C45423B, B86001T, and C86006H check for the predefined 
type SHORT_FLOAT; for this implementation, there is no such type. 

C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with 
a name other than FLOAT, LONG_FLOAT, or SHORT_FLOAT; for this 
implementation, there is no such type 

C45531M..P and C45532M..P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations 
for types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or greater; for 
this implementation, MAX_MANTISSA is less than 47. 

C45536A, C46013B, C46031B, C46033B, and C46034B contain length 
clauses that specify values for small that are not powers of two or 
ten; this implementation does not support such values for small. 

C45624A..B (2 tests) check that the proper exception is raised if 
MACHINE_OVERFLOWS is FALSE for floating point types and the results 
of various floating-point operations lie outside the range of the 
base type; for this implementation, MACHINE_OVERFLOWS is TRUE. 

B86001Y uses the name of a predefined fixed-point type other than 
type DURATION; for this implementation, there is no such type. 

CD1009C checks whether a length clause can specify a non-default 
size for a floating-point type; this implementation does not 
support such sizes. 

CD2A53A check operations of a fixed-point type for which a length 
clause specifies a power-of-ten TYPE'SMALL; this implementation 
does not support decimal ' SMALLS. (See section 2.3.) 

CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use length 
clauses to specify non-default sizes for access types; this 
implementation does not support such sizes. 

BD8001A, BD8003A, BD8004A..B (2 tests), and AD8011A use machine 
code insertions; this implementation provides no package 
MACHINE CODE.

The tests listed in the following table check the given file

this implementation does not support these operations. 

Test File Operation Mode File Access Method 

CE2105A CREATE IN_FILE SEQUENTIAL_IO 

CE2105B CREATE INJFILE DIRECT_IO 

CE3109A CREATE IN_FILE TEXT_IO 

CE2401H, EE2401D, and EE2401G use instantiations of DIRECT_IO with 
unconstrained array and record types; this implementation raises 
USE_ERROR on the attempt to create a file of such types. 

CE2203A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of an 
external sequential file is exceeded; this implementation cannot 
restrict file capacity. 

CE2403A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of an 
external direct file is exceeded; this implementation cannot 
restrict file capacity. 

CE3202A expects that function NAME can be applied to the standard 
input and output files; in this implementation these files have no 
names, and USE_ERROR is raised. (See section 2.3.) 


2-3 








CE3304A checks that SET_LINE_LENGTH and SET_PAGE_LENGTH raise 
USE_ERROR if they specify an inappropriate value for the external 
file; there are no inappropriate values for this implementation. 

CE3417B checks that PAGE raises LAYOUT ERROR when the value of the 
page number exceeds COUNT'LAST. For this implementation, the value 
of COUNT'LAST is greater than 150000, making the checking of this 
objective impractical. 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 23 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
implementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in 
the way expected by the original tests. 

B23004A B24007A B24009A B28003A B32202A B32202B 

B32202C B37004A B61012A B74401F B74401R B91004A 

B95032A B95069A B95069B BA1101B BC2001D BC3009C 

B85002A was graded passed by Evaluation Modification as directed by 
the AVO. This test declares a record type REC2 whose sole 
component is of an unconstrained record type with a size in excess 
of 2**32 bytes; this implementation rejects the declaration of 
REC2. Although a strict interpretation of the LRM requires that 
this type declaration be accepted (an exception may be raised on 
the elaboration of the type or an object declaration) , the AVO 
accepted this behavior in consideration that such early error 
detection is expected to be allowed by the revised language 
standard. 

BA2001E was graded passed by Evaluation Modification as directed by 
the AVO. The test expects that duplicate names of subunits with a 
common ancestor will be detected as compilation errors; this 
implementation detects the errors at link time, and the AVO ruled 
that this behavior is acceptable. 

EA3004D was graded passed by Evaluation and Processing Modification 
as directed by the AVO. The test requires that either pragma 
INLINE is obeyed for a function call in each of three contexts and 
that thus three library units are made obsolete by the 
re-compilation of the inlined function's body, or else the pragma 
is ignored completely. This implementation obeys the pragma except 
when the call is within the package specification. When the test's 
files are processed in the given order, only two units are made 
obsolete; thus, the expected error at line 27 of file EA3004D6M is 
not valid and is not flagged. To confirm that indeed the pragma is 
not obeyed in this one case, the test was also processed with the 


2-4 






files re-ordered so that the re-compilation follows only the 
package declaration (and thus the other library units will not be 
made obsolete, as they are compiled later); a "NOT APPLICABLE" 
result was produced, as expected. The revised order of files was 
0-1-4-5-2-3-6. 

CD2A53A was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as 
directed by the AVO. The test contains a specification of a 
power-of-10 value as 'SMALL for a fixed-point type. The AVO ruled 
that, under ACVC 1.11, support of decimal 'SMALLs may be omitted. 

CE3202A was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as 
directed by the AVO. This test applies function NAME to the 
standard input file, which in this implementation has no name; 
USE_ERROR is raised but not handled, so the test is aborted. The 
AVO ruled that this behavior is acceptable pending any resolution 
of the issue by the ARG.

PROCESSING INFORMATION 


3.1 TESTING ENVIRONMENT 


The Ada implementation tested in this validation effort is 
described adequately by the information given in the initial pages 
of this report. 

For technical or sales information about this Ada implementation 
system, see:

Chantilly, VA 22021-3808 
Phone: (703) 818-4426 
FAX: (703) 818-5484 

Testing of this Ada implementation was conducted at the customer's 
site by a validation team from the AVF. 

3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes 
each test of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada 
Programming Language Standard, whether the test is applicable or 
inapplicable; otherwise, the Ada Implementation fails the ACVC 
[Pro90]. 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable) , a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard. 

The list of items below gives the number of ACVC tests in various 
categories. All tests were processed, except those that were 
withdrawn because of test errors (item b; see section 2.1), those 
that require a floating-point precision that exceeds the 
implementation's maximum precision (item e; see section 2.2), and 
those that depend on the support of a file system — if none is 
supported (item d) . All tests passed, except those that are listed 
in sections 2.1 and 2.2 (counted in items b and f, below). 

a) Total Number of Applicable Tests 3791 

b) Total Number of Withdrawn Tests 95 

c) Processed Inapplicable Tests 83 

d) Non-Processed I/O Tests 0

Precision Tests 

f) Total Number of Inapplicable Tests 284 (c+d+e) 

g) Total Number of Tests for ACVC 1.11 4170 (a+b+f) 


3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 
1.3) was taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The 
contents of the magnetic tape were loaded directly onto the host / 
target computer. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host / target computer, 
the full set of tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the 
customer and reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for 
a complete listing of the processing options for this 
implementation. 

The following options were explicitly invoked: 

Switch Effect 


-b Displays the short forms of compiler error messages. 

(The default is to display the long forms.) 

-e nnn Stops compilation after nnn errors; this Ada 

validation effort set nnn = 999 (Example: -e 999). 

-w Suppresses warning messages. 

-B Produces an output listing. 

-O Invokes the optimizer. 


For the support files, the following options were explicitly 
invoked: 

-b -w -O 

For the B, E28002A, E28002B, E28002D, EA3003B..D and all not 

applicable TEST files, the following options were explicitly 
invoked: 

-e 999 -w -B 


3-2 









For the A, C, D, E (with exceptions noted above for the E test 
files; note that EA3004D is compiled again in the order of 
0-1-4-5-2-3-6) TEST files, the following options were explicitly 
invoked: 

-w 

For the L TEST files, the following options were explicitly 
invoked: 

All default options were taken. 

Test output, compiler and linker listings, and job logs were 
captured on magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings 
examined on-site by the validation team were also archived.

APPENDIX B 


COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


The compiler options of this Ada implementation, as described in 
this Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically 
noted otherwise, references in this appendix are to compiler 
documentation and not to this report. 


B-l 










COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


NAME 

ada - Ada compiler 
SYNOPSIS 

ada ( options ] [ files ] libraryname 
Remarks: 

This command requires installation of optional Ada software 
(not included with the standard HP-UX operating system) 
before it can be used. 

DESCRIPTION 

ada is the HP-UX Ada compiler. It accepts several types of 
file arguments: 

(1) Arguments whose names end with .ad?, where ? is any 
single alphanumeric character, are taken to be Ada 
source files. 

(2) The libraryname argument names an Ada library that must 
have been previously created using the ada . mklib (l) 
command. An Ada library is an HP-UX directory 
containing files that are used by the various 
components of the Ada compilation system. There is no 
required or standard suffix on the name of an Ada 
library. 

The named source files are compiled and each 
successfully compiled unit is placed in the specified 
Ada library by the compiler. When binding, or binding 
and linking, information is extracted from the Ada 
library to perform the bind and/or link operation. The 
Ada library must always be specified. 

To ensure internal data structure integrity of the Ada 
libraries, libraries are locked for the duration of any 
operations being performed on them. During 
compilation, libraryname is normally locked for 
updating, and other Ada libraries can be locked for 
reading. During binding/linking, Ada libraries are 
only locked for reading. 

If ada cannot obtain a lock after a suitable number of 
retries, it displays an informational message and 
terminates. 

Users are strongly discouraged from placing any 
additional files in Ada library directories. User 
files in Ada libraries are subject to damage by, or 
might interfere with, proper operation of ada and 
related tools. 

(3) All other file arguments, including those whose names 




COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


end with .o or .a are passed on to the linker ld(l) to 
be linked into the final program. It is not possible 
to link-only with the ada (l) command. 

(4) Although shown in the preferred order above, options , 
files , and libraryname arguments can appear in any 
order. 

Environment Variables 

The environment variable ADA_PATH is associated with all 
components of the Ada compilation system. It must be set 
properly and exported before any component of the Ada 
compilation system (including ada ) can be used. 

Normally this variable is defined and set in the system-wide 
shell startup files /etc/profile (for sh(l) and ksh (l)) and 
/etc/csh.login (for csh (l)). However, it can be set by a 
user, either interactively or in a personal shell startup 
file, .profile (for sh(l) and ksh (l)) or .cshrc (for 
csh (1)). 

ADA PATH must contain the path name of the directory in 
which the Ada compiler components have been installed. 

The value of this variable must be a rooted directory (that 
is, it must begin with a /) and the directory specification 
must not end with a /. 

ADAOPTS 

The environment variable ADAOPTS can be used to supply 
commonly used (or default) arguments to ada . ADAOPTS is 
associated directly with ada , and is not used by any other 
component of the Ada compilation system. 

Arguments can be passed to ada through the ADAOPTS 
environment variable, as well as on the command line. 
ada(l) picks up the value of ADAOPTS and places its contents 
before any arguments on the command line. For example (in 
sh(l) notation), 

$ ADAOPTS-"-v -e 10" 

$ export ADAOPTS 
$ ada -L source.ada test.lib 

is equivalent to 

$ ada -v -e 10 -L source.ada test.lib 
Compiler Options 

The following options are recognized: 

-a string Store the supplied annotation string in the 
library with the compilation unit. This 


B-3 




COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


string can later be displayed by the unit 
manager. The maximum length of this string 
is 80 characters. The default is no string. 

-b Display abbreviated compiler error messages 

(default is to display the long forms). 

-c Suppress link phase and, if binding occurred, 

preserve the object file produced by the 
binder. This option only takes effect if 
linking would normally occur. Linking 
normally occurs when binding has been 
requested. 

Use of this option causes an informational 
message to be displayed on standard error 
indicating the format of the ld(l) command 
that should be used to link tEe program. It 
is recommended that the user supply 
additional object (.o) and archive (.a) files 
and additional library search paths (-lx) 
only in the places specified by the 
informational message. 

If the -c option is given along with the -d 
or -D option, the binder must assume the name 
for the eventual executable file, in order to 
determine what to name the debug/profiling 
information file (see -d and -D). If no -o 
option is given, the debug/profiling 
information file will be named a.out.cui, and 
you must make sure the eventual executable 
file is named a.out. If a -o outfile option 
is given, the debug/profiling information 
file will be named outfile .cui, and you must 
make sure the eventual executable file is 
named outfile . If the executable is not 
named as expected, neither ada . probe (1) nor 
ada.tune(l) will work correctly. 

When Id is later used to actually link the 
program, the following conditions must be 
met: 

1. The .o file generated by the binder 
must be specified before any HP-UX 
archive is specified (either 
explicitly or with -1). 

2. If -lc is specified when linking, any 
.o file containing code that uses 
stdio (3S) routines must be specified 
before -lc is specified. 


B-4 






COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


Cause the compiler to store additional 
information in the Ada library for the units 
being compiled for use by the Ada debugger 
(see ada . probe d)) or Ada profiler (see 
ada . time (1)). Only information required for 
debugging or profiling is saved; the source 
is not saved (see -D). 

Cause the binder to produce a debug/profiling 
information file for the program being bound 
so that the resulting program can be 
manipulated by the Ada debugger. (Note: if 
you intend to use the Ada profiler you should 
use the binder option -W b,-p instead of 
using -d at bind time.) The binder will 
produce a debug/profiling information file 
named a. out . cui (unless -o is used to specify 
an alternate name). If the debug information 
file name would be truncated by the file 
system on which it would be created, an error 
is reported. 

Only sources compiled with the -d or -D 
option contribute information to the 
debug/profiling information file produced by 
the binder. The default is not to produce 
the debug/profiling information (see the Ada 
Tools Manual for more details ). See -c for 
information on the enteraction between the 
-o, -d, -D, and -c options. 

See the WARNINGS section for information 
regarding debugging of optimized programs. 

Stop compilation after nnn errors (legal 
range 0..32767, default 50). 

Cause any pending or existing instantiations 
of generic bodies in this Ada library, whose 
actual generic bodies have been compiled or 
recompiled in another Ada library, to be 
compiled (or recompiled) in this Ada library. 

This option is treated as a special "source'* 
file and the compilation is performed when 
the option is encountered among the names of 
any actual source files. 

Any pending or existing instantiations in the 
same Ada library into which the actual 
generic body is compiled (or recompiled), do 
not need this option. Such pending or 
existing instantiations are automatically 
compiled (ot recompiled) when the actual 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


generic body is compiled into the same Ada 
library. 

Warning: Compilation (or recompilation) of 
instantiations either automatically or by 
using this option only affects instantiations 
stored as separate units in the Ada library 
(see -u). Existing instantiations which ace 
"in-line" in another unit are not 
automatically compiled or recompiled by using 
this option. Units containing such 
instantiations must be explicitly recompiled 
by the user if the actual generic body is 
recompiled. 

Cause the compiler to save an internal 
representation of the source in the Ada 
library for use by the Ada cross referencer 
ada . xref (1). By default, the internal 
representation is not saved. 

-lx Cause the linker to search the HP-UX library 

named either /lib/libx.a (tried first) or 
/usr/lib/libx.a (see Td(l)). 

-m nnn The supplied number is the size in Kbytes to 

be allocated at compile time to manipulate 
library information. The range is 500 to 
32767. The default is 500. The default size 
should work in almost all cases. In some 
extreme cases involving very large programs, 
increasing this value will improve 
compilation time. 

-n Cause the output file from the linker to be 

marked as shareable (see -N). Do not use the 
option -n when also profiling with the option 
—W b,-p. For details refer to chatr(l) and 
ld(l). 

~o outfile Name the output file from the linker outfile 
instead of a.out. In addition, if used with 
the -c option, name the object file output by 
the binder outfile .o instead of a.out.o. If 
debugging is enabled (with -d or -D), name 
the debug information file output by the 
binder outfile .cui instead of a.out.cui. 

If -c is not specified, the temporary object 
files used in the link operation are deleted, 
whether or not the link succeeded. 

-q Cause the output file from the linker to be 

marked as demand loadable (see -Q). For 

B-6 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


details refer to chatr(l) and ld(l). 

-r nnn Set listing line length to nnn (legal range 

60..255, default 79). This option applies to 
the listing produced by both the compiler and 
the binder (see -B, -L, and -w b,-L). 

-s Cause the output of the linker to be stripped 

of symbol table information (see ld(l) and 
strip (1)). 

Use of this option prevents ada . probe (l) and 
ada.tune(l) from functioning correctly. 

-t £,name Substitute or insert subprocess c with name 

where c is one or more of a set of 
identifiers indicating the subprocess(es). 
This option works in two modes: 1) if c is a 
single identifier, name represents the full 
path name of the new subprocess; 2) if c is a 
set of (more than one) identifiers, name 
represents a prefix to which the standard 
suffixes are concatenated to construct the 
full path name of the new subprocesses. 

The possible values of c are the following: 

b binder (standard suffix is adabind ) 
c canqpiler (standard suffix is adacomp ) 

7 same as c 

T linker (standard suffix is Id) 

-u Cause instantiations of generic program unit 

bodies to be stored as separate units in the 
Ada library (see -i). 

If -u is not specified and the actual generic 
body has already been compiled when an 
instantiation of the body is compiled, the 
body generated by the instantiation is stored 
"in-line" in the same unit as its 
declaration. 

If -u is specified or the actual generic body 
has not already been compiled when an 
instantiation of the body is compiled, the 
body generated by the instantiation is stored 
as a separate unit in the Ada library. 

The -u option may be needed if a large number 
of generic instantiations within a given unit 
result in the overflow of a compiler internal 
table. 


B-7 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


Specifying -u reduces the amount of table 
space needed, permitting the compiler to 
complete. However it also increases the 
number of units used within the Ada library, 
and also introduces a small amount of 
overhead at execution time in units which 
instantiate generics. 

-v Enable verbose mode, producing a step-by-step 

description of the compilation, binding, and 
linking process on standard error. 

-w Suppress warning messages. 

-x Perform syntactic checking only. The 

libraryname argument must be supplied, 
although the Ada library is not modified (see 
-X and -G). 


-B Causes the compiler to produce a compilation 

listing, suppressing page headers and the 
error summary at the end of the compilation 
listing. This is useful for avoiding 
mismatcnes caused by page headers when 
comparing a compilation listing with a 
previous compilation listing of the same 
program. This option cannot be specified in 
conjunction with the -L option. 

-C Suppress runtime checks except for stack 

overflow. Use of this option may result in 
erroneous (in the Ada sense) program 
behavior. In addition, some checks (such as 
those automatically provided by hardware) 
might not be suppressed (see -R). 

If a generic body, or a procedure or function 
that may be included "inline" (see the +0 i 
and -I options), is compiled with this option 
in effect, this option setting is 
"remembered". When the generic is 
instantiated, or the procedure or function is 
included "inline", the compiler will produce 
code for that instantiation or inlining that 
is consistent with the "remembered" option 
again being in effect (i.e. the runtime 
checking level specified to the compiler 
which is compiling the instatiation or 
inlined procedure or function is ignored for 
the duration of the instantiation or inlining 
aid the runtime checking level specified when 
the generic body or orignal procedure or 
function was compiled is used instead). 


B-8 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


See the Users Guide for more information. 

-D Cause the compiler to store additional 

information in the Ada library for the units 
being compiled, for use by the Ada debugger 
(see ada . probe (1)) or Ada profiler (see 
ada . tune d?). In addition to saving 
information required for debugging and 
profiling, an internal representation of the 
actual source is saved. This permits 
accurate source level debugging and profiling 
at the expense of a larger Ada library if the 
actual source file changes after it is 
compiled (see -d). By default, neither 
debug/profiling information nor source 
information is stored. 

Cause the binder to produce a debug/profiling 
information file for the program being bound 
so that the resulting program can be 
manipulated by the Ada debugger (Note: if you 
intend to use the Ada profiler you should use 
the binder option -W b,-p instead of using -D 
at bind time). The binder wil produce a 
debug profiling information file named 
a. out . cui (unless -o is used to specify an 
alternate name). If the debug information 
file name would be truncated by the file 
system on which it is to be created, an error 
is reported. 

Only sources compiled with the -d or -D 
option contribute information to the 
debug/pcofiling information file produced by 
the binder. The default is not to produce 
the debug/profiling information (see the Ada 
Tools Manual for more details). See -c for 
information on the interaction between the 
-o, -d, -D, and -c options. 

See the WARNINGS section for information 
regarding debugging of optimized programs. 

~G Generate code but do not update the library. 

This is primarily intended to allow one to 
get an assembly listing (with -S) without 
changing the library. The libraryname 
argument must be supplied, although the Ada 
library is not modified (see -x and -X). 

-H Causes the compiler to produce informational 

messages of interest to users of the 
INTERRUPT_MANAGER package (which is described 
by the appropriate Reference Manual for the 

B-9 






COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


Ada Programming Language , Appendix F). Three 
types of messages are produced: 

1. Information that an Ada runtime system 
routine will be called from the 
generated code for the indicated 
construct. The name of the Ada 
runtime system routine will be 
indicated. 

2. Information that an Ada type support 
subprogram (TSS) will be called from 
the generated code for the indicated 
construct. The name of the Ada type 
that the TSS supports will be 
indicated. 

3. Information indicating the size in 
bytes of the parameter block, for a 
task entry for which an address clause 
has been specified. 

The first two kinds of messages are of 
interest when compiling the bodies of signal 
handlers for use with the INTERRUPT_MANAGER 
package. The third kind of message is of 
interest when compiling the specifications of 
tasks which contain entries which will be 
called by the INTERRUPT_MANAGER package. 

If you generate a complete compiler listing 
with the -B or -L options, the informational 
messages appear in the compiler listing at 
the appropriate source lines. If you do not 
generate a complete compiler listing, only 
the source lines that apply to the 
informational message appear with the 
informational message. The information 
normally produced by -H will be suppressed if 
-b is also specified. 

-I Suppress all inlining. No procedures or 

functions are expanded inline and pragma 
inline is ignored. This also prevents units 
compiled in the future (without this option 
in effect) from inlining any units compiled 
with this option in effect. 

-L Write a program listing with error 

diagnostics to standard output. This option 
cannot be specified in conjunction with the 
-B option. 


B-10 








COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-M main Invoke the binder after all source files 

named in the command line (if any) have been 
successfully compiled. The argument main 
specifies the entry point of the Ada program; 
main must be the name of a parameterless 
Ada-library-level procedure. 

The library-level procedure main must have 
been successfully compiled into (or linked 
into) the named Ada library, either by this 
invocation of ada or by a previous invocation 
of ada (or ada . umgr d)). 

The binder produces an object file named 
a.out.o (unless -o is used to specify an 
alternate name), only if the option -c is 
also specified. The object file produced by 
the binder is deleted unless the option -c is 
specified. Note that the alternate name is 
truncated, if necessary, prior to appending 
.o. 

-N Cause the output file from the linker to be 

marked as unshareable (see -n). For details 
refer to chatr(l) and ld(l). 

-0 Invoke the optimizer with full optimizations. 

See the description of +0 under the

See the WARNINGS section for information 
regarding debugging of optimized programs. 

-P nrm Set listing page length to nnn lines (legal 

range 10..32767 or 0 to indicate no page 
breaks - , default 66). This length is the 
total number of lines listed per listing 
page. It includes the heading, header and 
trailer blank lines, listed program lines, 
and error message lines. This option applies 
to the listing produced by both the conpiler 
and the binder (see -L and -W b,-L). 

-Q Cause the output file from the linker to be 

marked as not demand-loadable (see -q). For 
details refer to chatr (1) and ld(1). 

HR Suppress all run-time checks. However, sane 

checks (such as those automatically provided 
by hardware) might not be suppressed. Use of 
this option may result in erroneous (in the 
Ada sense) program behavior (see -C ). 

If a generic body, or a procedure or function

that may be included "inline" {see the +0 i 
and -I options), is compiled with this option 
in effect, this option setting is 
"remembered". When the generic is 
instantiated, or the procedure or function is 
included "inline", the conpiler will produce 
code for that instantiation or inlining that 
is consistent with the "remembered" option 
again being in effect (i.e. the runtime 
checking level specified to the compiler 
which is compiling the instatiation or 
inlined procedure or function is ignored for 
the duration of the instantiation or inlining 
and the runtime checking level specified when 
the generic body or orignal procedure or 
function was compiled is used instead). 

■S Write an assembly listing of the code 

generated to standard output. This output is 
not in a form suitable for processing with 
as(l). 


-W c, argl [, arg2 ,..., argN ) 

Cause argl through arqN to be handed off to 
subprocess c. Each argi is of the form 
-argoption (, arevalue ), where argoption is the 
name of an option recognized by the 
subprocess and argvalue is a separate 
argument to argoption where necessary. The 
values that c can assume are those listed 
under the -t option as well as d (driver 
program). 

To pass the -r (preserve relocation 
information) option to the linker, use: 

-W 1,-r 

The following sends the options -m 10 -s 2 to 
the binder: 


-W b,-ra,10,-s,2 


Note that all the binder options can be 
supplied with one -W, {more them one -w can 
also be used) and that any embedded spaces 
must be replaced with commas. Note that -W b 
is the only way to specify binder options. 

The -W d option specification allows 
additional implementation-specific options to 
be recognized and passed through the compiler 
driver to the appropriate subprocess. For 
example. 


B-12 






COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-W d,-0,eo 

sends the option -O eo to the driver, which 
sends it to the compiler so that the e and o 
optimizations are performed. Furthermore, a 
shorthand notation for this mechanism can be 
used by inserting + in front of the option as 
follows: 

+0 eo 

This is equivalent to ~W d,-0,eo. Note that 
for simplicity this shorthand is applied to 
each implementation-specific option 
individually, and that the arqvalue (if any) 
is separated from the shorthand argoption 
with white space instead of a comma. 

-X Perform syntactic and semantic checking. The 

libra rymame argument must be supplied, 
although the Ada library is not modified (see 
-x and -G ). 


Binder Options 

The following options can be passed to the binder using 


-W b,-b At execution time, the Ada STANDARD_INFUT and 

STANDARD OUTPUT files will block if'data is 
not available (STANDARD_INFUT) or if data 
cannot currently be written (STANDARD OUTPUT) 
or if the data to be read or written Ties in 
a locked region. All tasks will be suspended 
when an I/O operation on one of these 
standard files blocks. This option is the 
default if the program contains no tasks (see 
-w b,-B for more details). 


-W b,-k 


Keep uncalled subprograms when binding. The 
default is to remove them. 


-W b,-m, nnn Series 300/400: Set the initial program stack 
size to nnn units of 1024 bytes (legal range 
1..32767, default 10 units - 10 * 1024 bytes 
- 10240 bytes). 

Series 600/700/800: Set the raaucimum stack 
limit of the program stack to nnn units of 
1024 bytes (legal range 512..32757, defaults 
to a system-defined limit). 

—W b,-p Cause the binder to link the program in the 

special manner required by ada . tune (l) and to 
place additional information in the 


B-13 









COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


debug/profiling information file for use 
ada.tuned). Note that neither -d nor -D 
needs to be specified when binding if this 
option is specified, as this option causes 
the same binder action as -d and -D plus the 
additional actions noted above. 

If you specify the -c option when binding, 
you will need to specify special options and 
object files when linking with ld(l) in order 
for ada.tuned) to function correctly. When 
you specify -c, the ldd) command you need to 
use will be displayecTas an informational 
message by the binder. Consult the Ada Tools 
Manual for your implementation for further 
information. 

-W b,-s, nnn Cause round-robin scheduling to be used for 
tasking programs. Set the time slice to nnn 
tens of milliseconds (legal range 1..32767 or 
0 to turn off time slicing). By default, 
round-robin scheduling is enabled with a time 
slice of 1 second ( nnn « 100). 

The time slice granularity is specified under 
the DEPENDENCIES section. 

-W b,-t, nnn Set the total task ’STORAGE_SIZE to nnn units 
of 1024 bytes for each task which does not 
have a length clause. 

Cause this amount of space to be allocated 
for the total task data area which includes 
both the task stack and the overhead for the 
Ada runtime system. 

Series 300/400: The Ada runtime system 
overhead is approximately 3600 bytes, so the 
minimum usable value of nnn is 4. The 
default is 32 units, equaT~to 32 * 1024 bytes 

- 32768 bytes, less 3600 bytes leaves 29168 
bytes for the task stack. 

Series 600/700/800: The Ada runtime system 
overhead is approximately 5400 bytes, so the 
minimum usable value of nnn is 6. The 
default is 32 units, equal - to 32 * 1024 bytes 

- 32768 bytes, less 5400 bytes leaves 27368 
bytes for the task stack. 

If insufficient space is allocated either 
TASKING_ERROR or STORAGE_EEROR will occur 
during task elaboration or activation.

specified (see -w b,-L below). 

At execution time, the Ada STANDARD INPUT and

or if the data to be read or written Ties in 
a locked region. The task attempting the I/O 
operation that cannot currently be completed 
will be suspended (and the I/O operation 
retried later), but other tasks will continue 
to run as appropriate. This option is the 
default if the program contains tasks (see 
-W b,-b for more details). 

Write a binder listing with waming/error 
diagnostics to standard error. 

Specifies which HP-UX timer should be used to 
implement task time-slicing. If time-slicing 
is not also enabled, this option has no 
effect. 

The argument t is a single character that 
specifies which timer to use. The legal 
values of t and their meanings are: 

a or K : Use the timer which generates 
SIGALRM for time-slicing. 

£ or P : Use the timer which generates 
SIGPROF for time-slicing. 

v or V : Use the timer which generates 
SIGVTALRM for time-slicing. 

The default is to use the timer which 
generates SIGVTALRM for time-slicing. 

Suppress procedure traceback in response to

This also causes traceback tables to be

compilation system options 


Ada libraries and families are locked for the duration of 
operations that are performed on them. Normally Ada 
families are locked for only a short time when libraries 
within them are manipulated. However, multiple Ada 
libraries might need to be locked for longer periods during 
a single operation. If more than one library is locked, ada 
places an exclusive lock on one library so it can be 
updated, and a shared lock on the other(s) so that they can 
remain open for read-only purposes. 

An Ada family or library locked for updating cannot be 
accessed in any way by any part of the Ada compilation 
system except by the part that holds the lock. An Ada 
family or library locked for reading can be accessed by any 
part of the Ada compilation system desiring to read from the 
Ada family or library. 

If ada cannot obtain a lock after a suitable number of 
retries, it displays an informational message and 
terminates. 

Under some circumstances, an Ada family or Ada library might 
be locked, but the locking program(s) might have terminated 
(for example, due to system crash or network failure). If 
you determine that the Ada family or Ada library is locked 
but should not be locked, you can remove the lock. 

Use ada.unlock(l) to unlock an Ada library and 
ada . funlock (l) to unlock an Ada family. However, unlocking 
should be done with care. If an Ada family or Ada library 
is actually locked by a tool, unlocking it will permit 
access by other tools that might find the contents invalid 
or that might damage the Ada family or Ada library. 

EXTERNAL INFLUENCES 

International Code Set Support 
Single-byte character code sets are supported within file 
names. 


DIAGNOSTICS 

The diagnostics produced by ada are intended to be self- 
explanatory. Occasional messages might be produced by the 
linker. 

If a program listing (-B or -L) and/or generated code 
listing (~S) is requested from the compiler, this listing as 
well as compiler error messages are written to standard 
output. 

If neither a program listing nor a generated code listing is 
requested from the compiler, erroneous source lines and 
conpiler error messages are written to standard error. 




COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


If a binder listing is requested from the binder (with 
-W b,-L), the binder listing as well as binder error 
messages are written to standard error. 

If a binder listing is not requested from the binder, binder 
error messages are written to standard error. 

Errors detected during command line processing or during 
scheduling of the compiler, binder, or linker, are written 
to standard error. If any compiler, binder, or linker 
errors occur, ada writes a one-line summary to standard 
error immediately before terminating. 

WARNINGS 

Options not recognized by ada are not passed on to the 
linker. The option -w l, arg can also be used to pass 
options to the linker explicitly. 

ada does not generate an error or warning if both 
optimization and debugging are requested. However, 
ada . probe is only capable of limited debugging of optimized 
code. Certain ada . probe commands may give misleading or 
unexpected results. For example, object values may be 
stored in registers; therefore the value displayed from 
memory may be incorrect. For this reason, the ability to 
examine or modify objects and expressions may be impaired. 
Dead-code elimination or code motion may affect single step 
execution or prevent breakpoints from being set on specific 
source lines. 

DEPENDENCIES 

Series 300/400 

The compiler option -H is not supported on the Series 
300/400. 

The binder option -W b,-m behaves differently on the 
Series 300/400 versus the Series 600/700/800. See the 
section Binder Options for more information. 

The time slice granularity for round-robin scheduling 
is 20 milliseconds. 

The following options are specific to the Series 
300/400: 

+0 what Selectively invoke optimizations. The ac 
argument must be specified, and indicates 
which optimizations should be performed. 

Note that the option -0 is equivalent to 
+0 eioE. 

The what argument can be a combination of 
the letters e, i, o, p, E, and P. Either e 


B-17 



COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


or p, but not both, can be specified. 
Similarly, either E or F, but not both, can 
be specified. All other combinations are 
permitted, but only one of each letter, at 
most, can be specified. 

e Same as p (below). 

i Permit procedures and functions 

not declared with pragma inline to 
be expanded inline at the 
compiler's discretion. Only 
procedures and functions in the 
current source file are 
considered. 

Procedures and functions declared 
with pragma inline are always 
considered candidates for inline 
expansion unless -I is specified; 
this optimization only causes 
additional procedures and 
functions to be considered. 

o Peephole optimizations are 

performed on the final object 
code. 

p Optimizations *re performed to 

remove unnecessary checks, 
optimize loops, and remove dead 
code. 

E Same as P (below). 

p Optimizations are performed on 

common subexpressions and register 
allocation. 

+h type Bind/link the program to use the specified 
type of hardware floating-point assist for 
user code floating-point operations (see 
+H). The two t ypes currently supported are 

68881 (the MC 63881 math coprocessor) and 

68882 (the MC 68882 math coprocessor). The 
code generated is the same for either type . 
This is the default if the host system 
provides a MC 68881 or a MC 68882 
coprocessor. This option is ignored if 
floating point operations were compiled 
inline with the +i type option. 

+i type Compile the program to inline the specified 
type of hardware floating-point assist for 


B—18 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


user code floating-point operations (see 
+1). The two types currently supported are 

68881 (the MC 68881 math coprocessor) and 

68882 (the MC 68882 math coprocessor). The 
code generated is the same for either type . 
This is the default if the host system 
provides a MC 68881 or a MC 68882 
coprocessor. Once inlined with this 
option, the bind/link options +h type and 
+H are ignored. 

+H Bind/1ink the program to use software 

floating-point routines for user code 
floating-point operations (see +h). This 
is the default if the host system does not 
provide a MC 68881 or a MC 68882 
coprocessor. This option is ignored if 
floating point operations were compiled 
inline with the +i type option. 

+1 Compile the program to make calls to a math 

library for user code floating point 
operations (see +i). The +h or +H options 
are then used at bind/link time to specify 
whether hardware or software is used for 
floating point operations. This is the 
default if the host system does not provide 
a MC 68881 or a MC 68882 coprocessor. 

Unlike other Series 300/400 compilers, it is not 
possible to link-only using the ada (l) command. If 
separate linking is desired, use~tKe ld(l) command. 

A successful bind produces a (non-executable) .0 file. 
The .0 file is normally deleted unless the option -c is 
specified. 

Series 600/700/800 

The binder option -W b,-m behaves differently on the 
Series 300/400 versus the Series 600/700/800. See the 
section Binder Options for more information. 

The time slice granularity for round-robin scheduling 
is 10 milliseconds. 

The following options are specific to the Series 
600/700/800: 

+D Aarchitecture 

Generate code for the architecture 
specified, architecture is required. The 
default code generated for the Series 800 
is PA_RISC_1.0. The default code generated 


B-19 




compilation system options 


for the Series 700 is PA_RISC_1.1. The 
default code generation may be overriden 
using the ADAOPTS environment variable or 
the conmand line option +DA. Defined 
values for architecture are: 

1.0 Precision Architecture RISC, 
version 1.0. 

1.1 Precision Architecture RISC, 
version 1.1. 

The compiler determines the target 
architecture using the following 
precedence: 

1. Conmand line specification of +qa. 

2. Specification of +DA in the ADAOPTS 
environment variable. 

3. The default as mentioned above. 

+D Sarchitecture 

Use the instruction scheduler tuned to the 
architecture specified, architecture is 
required. If this option is not used, the 
compiler uses the instruction scheduler for 
the architecture on which the program is 
compiled. Defined values for architecture 
are: 

1.0 Precision Architecture RISC, 
version 1.0. 

1.1 Precision Architecture RISC, 

version 1.1, general scheduling 
for the series 700. 

1.1a Scheduling for specific models of 
Precision Architecture RISC, 
version 1.1. 

+0 what Selectively invoke optimizations. The what 
argument must be specified, and indicates 
which optimizations should be performed. 
Note that the option -O is equivalent to 
+0 eilE. 

The what argument can be a combination of 
the letters e, i, 0, 1, p, E, and P. 

Either e or p, but not both, can be 
specified. Similarly, either E or p, but 
not both, can be specified. Similarly, 
either 0 or 1, but not both, can be 
specified. All other combinations are 
permitted, but only one of each letter, at 
most, can be specified. 


B-20 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


e Same as p (below). 

i Permit procedures and functions not 
declared with pragma inline to be 
expanded in-line at the compiler's 
discretion. Only procedures and 
functions in the current source 
file are considered. 

Procedures and functions declared 
with pragma inline are always 
considered candidates for inline 
expansion unless -I is specified; 
this optimization only causes 
additional procedures and functions 
to be considered. 

0 The code generator performs no 
optimizations. 

1 The code generator performs level 1 
optimizations. 

p Optimizations are performed to 

remove unnecessary checks, optimize 
loops, and remove dead code. 

E Same as P (below). 

P Optimizations are performed on 

common subexpressions and register 
allocation. 

+T Suppress the generation of traceback 

information at compile time. In addition 
to suppressing traceback of the current 
compilation unit at rur time, this also 
reduces the size of the object file in the 
ada library. 

Unlike other Series 600/700/800 compilers, it is not 
possible to link-only using the ada (l) command. If 
separate linking is desired, use ld(l). 

A successful bind produces a (non-executable) .o file. 
The .o file is normally deleted unless the option -c is 
specified.

COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


NAME 

Id - link editor 

SYNOPSIS 

Id t-bdmnqrstvxzENQZ] I-a search 1 ... [-e epsym ) [-h 

symbol] ... {-o out file) [-u symbol] ... [ -A name ) [-B 
bind ! [-L dir] ... T-R ~offset ] [-V nun ) [-X nun] [-lx 
THle] ... 

DESCRIPTION 

Id takes one or more object files or libraries as input and 
combines them to produce a single (usually executable) file. 
In doing so it resolves references to external symbols, 
assigns final addresses to procedures and variables, revises 
code and data to reflect new addresses (a process called 
"relocation"), and updates symbolic debug information (when 
present in the file). By default. Id produces an executable 
file that can be run by the HP-UX loader exec (2). 
Alternatively, the linker can generate a relocatable file 
that is suitable for further processing by Id (see -r 
below). It can also generate a shared library (see -b 
below). The linker marks the output file non-executable if 
any unresolved external references remain. Id may or may 
not generate an output file if any other errors occur during 
its operation; see DEPENDENCIES. Id recognizes three kinds 
of input files: object files create3 by the compilers, 
assembler, or linker (also known as ’'.o'' files), shared 
libraries created by the linker, and archives of object 
files (called archive libraries). An archive library 
contains an index of all the externally-visible symbols from 
its component object files. (The archiver command ar(l) 
creates and maintains this index.) Id uses this table to 
resolve references to external symbols. 

Id processes files in the same order as they appear on the 
command line. It includes code and data from an archive 
library element if and only if that object module provides a 
definition for a currently unresolved reference within the 
user's program. It is common practice to list libraries 
following the names of all simple object files on the 
command line. 

Code from shared libraries is never copied into an 
executable program, and data is copied only if referenced 
directly by the program. The dynamic loader /lib/dld .si is 
invoked at startup time by /lib/crtO.o if a program uses 

shared libraries. The dynamic loader attaches each required 
library to the process and resolves all symbolic references 
between the program and its libraries. The text segment of 
a shared library is shared among all processes that use the 
library. 


B-25 






COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


Environment Variables 

Arguments can be passed to the linker through the LDOPTS 
environment variable as well as on the conroand line. The 
linker picks up the value of LDOPTS and places its contents 
before any arguments on the command line. 

The LD PXDB environment variable defines the full execution 
path for the debug preprocessor pxdb . The default value is 
/usr/bin/pxdb. Id invokes pxdb on its output file if that 
file is executable and contains debug information. To defer 
invocation of pxdb until the first debug session, set 
LD_PXDB to /dev/null. 

Options 

Id recognizes the following options: 


-a search 


-b 


-d 


-e epsym 


-h symbol 


Specify whether shared or archive 
libraries are searched with the -1 
option. The value of search should be 
one of archive, shared, or default. 

This option can appear more than once, 
interspersed among -1 options, to 
control the searching for each library. 
The default is to use the shared version 
of a library if one is available, or the 
archive version if not. If either 
archive or shared is active, only the 
specified library type is accepted. 

Create a shared library rather than a 
normal executable file. Object files 
processed with this option should 
contain position independent code (PIC). 
See the discussion of PIC in ceil), 
f77 {1), pc(1), and as(1). 

Forces definition of "common" storage; 
i.e., assign addresses and sizes, for -r 
output. 

Set the default entry point address for 
the output file to be that of the symbol 
epsym . (This option only applies to 
executable files.) 

Prior to writing the symbol table to the 
output file, mark this name as "local" 
so that it is no longer externally 
visible. This ensures that this 
particular entry will not clash with a 
definition in another file during future 
processing by Id. (Of course, this only 
makes sense witE thf.* -r option.) More 


8-26 



COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


than one symbol can be specified, but -h 
must precede each one. 

-lx Search a library libx.a or libx.sl, 

where x is one or more characters. The 
current state of the -a option 
determines whether the archive (.a) or 
shared (.si) version of a library is 
searched. Because a library is searched 
when its name is encountered, the 
placement of a -1 is significant. By 
default, libraries are located in /lib 
and /usr/lib. If the environment 
variable LPATH is present in the user's 
environment, it should contain a colon- 
separated list of directories to search. 
These directories are searched instead 
of the default directories, but -L 
options can still be used. If a program 
uses shared libraries, the dynamic 
loader /lib/dld.sl will attempt to load 
each library from the same directory in 
which it was found at link time. 

-m Produce a load map on the standard 

output. 

-n Generate an (executable) output file 

with code to be shared by all users. 
Compare with -N. 

-o outfile Produce an output object file by the 
name outfile (default name is a.out). 

Generate an (executable) output file 
that is demand-loadable. Compare with 
-Q. 

Retain relocation information in the 
output file for subsequent re-linking. 
Hie Id command does not report undefined 
symbols. The -r option is incompatible 
with -A and -b. 

Strip the output file of all symbol 
table, relocation, and debug support 
information. This might impair or 
prevent the use of a symbolic debugger 
on the resulting program. This option 
is incompatible with -r. (The strip (l) 
command also removes this information.) 

Print a trace (to standard output) of 
each input file as Id processes it. 



B-27 






COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-u symbol 


-v 


-x 


-2 


-A name 


-B bind 


Enter symbol as an undefined symbol in 
the symbol table. The resulting 
unresolved reference is useful for 
linking a program solely from object 
files in a library. More than one 
symbol can be specified, but each must 
be preceded by -u. 

Display verbose messages during linking. 
For each library module that is loaded, 
the linker indicates which symbol caused 
that module to be loaded. 

Partially strip the output file; that 
is, leave out local symbols. The 
intention is to reduce the size of the 
output file without impairing the 
effectiveness of object file utilities. 
Note: use of -x might affect the use of 
a debugger. 

Arrange for run-time dereferencing of 
null pointers to produce a SIGSEGV 
signal. (This is the complement of the 
-Z option.) 

This option specifies incremental 
loading. Linking is arranged so that 
the resulting object can be read into an 
already executing program. The argument 
name specifies a file whose symbol table 
provides the basis for defining 
additional symbols. Only newly linked 
material is entered into the text and 
data portions of a.out, but the new 
symbol table reflects all symbols 
defined before and after the incremental 
load. Also, the -R option cam be used 
in conjunction with -A, which allows the 
newly linked segment to commence at the 
corresponding address. The default 
starting address is the old value of 
_end. The -A option is incompatible 
with -r and -b. 

Select run-time binding behavior of a 
program using shared libraries. The 
value of bind must be one of immediate 
or deferred. The default is deferred, 
which tells the dynamic loader 
/lib /dld .sl to resolve procedure calls 
on first reference rather than at 
program start-up time. 


B-28 




COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-E 


-L dir 


-N 


-Q 


-R offset 

-V num 


-X num 


-Z 


Mark all symbols defined by a program 
for export to shared libraries. By 
default, Id can mark only those symbols 
that are actually referenced by a shared 
library. 

Change the algorithm of searching for 
libx.a or libx.sl to look in dir before 
looking in default locations. More than 
one directory can be specified, but each 
must be preceded by -L. The -L option 
is effective only if it precedes the -1 
option on the command line. 

Generate an (executable) output file 
that cannot be shared. This option also 
causes the data to be placed immediately 
following the text, and makes the text 
writable. 

Generate an (executable) output file 
that is not demand-loadable. (This is 
the complement of the -q option.) 

Set the origin (in hexadecimal) for the 
text (i.e., code) segment. 

Use num as a decimal version stamp 
identifying the a.out file that is 
produced. This is not the same as the 
version information reported by the SCCS 
what (_1) command, nor is it the same as 
the version information recorded for 
shared library use. 

Define the initial size for the linker's 
global symbol table. This reduces link 
time for very large programs, especially 
those with a large number of external 
symbols. 

Arrange to allow run-time dereferencing 
of null pointers? See the discussions of 
-Z and pointers in cc(l). (This is the 
complement of the -z option.) 


Defaults 

Unless otherwise directed, Id names its output a.out. The 
-o option overrides this. Executable output files can be 
shared. The default state of -a is to search shared 
libraries if available, archive libraries otherwise. The 
default bind behavior is deferred. 


B-29 



COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


EXTERNAL INFLUENCES 

Environment Variables 

LANG determines the language in which messages are displayed 
(Series 700/800 only). 

If LANG is not specified or is set to the empty string, a 
default of "C" (see lang (5)) is used instead of LANG. 

If any internationalization variable contains an invalid 
setting. Id behaves as if all internationalization variables 
are set to "C". See environ (5). 

DIAGNOSTICS 

Id returns zero when the link is successful. A non-zero 
return code indicates that an error occurred. 

EXAMPLES 

The following command line links part of a C program for 
later processing by Id. It also specifies a version number 
of 2 for the output ?Tle. (Note the .o suffix for the 
output object file. This is an HP-UX convention for 
indicating a linkable object file.) 

Id -V 2 -r filel.o file2.o -o prog.o 

The next example links a simple FORERAN program for use with 
the cdb(l) symbolic debugger. The output file name will be 
a.out since there is no -o option in the comnand line. 

(Note: the particular options shown here are for a Series 
300/400 system.) 

Id -e start /lib/frtO.o ftn.o -1.T77 -1F77 -lm -lc 
/Usr/lib/end.o 

This example creates a shared library. 

Id -b -o libfunc.sl funcl.o func2.o func3.o 

Link a program with libfunc.sl but use the archive version 
of the C library: 

Id /lib/crtO.o program.o -L . -lfunc -a archive 
-lc 

Link a Pascal program on a Series 300/400 system: 

Id /lib/crtO.o main.o -lpc -lm -lc 


WARNINGS 

Id recognizes several names as having special meanings. The 
symbol end is reserved by the linker to refer to the first 
address~~beyond the end of the program's address space. 


S— 30 




COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


Similarly, the symbol _edata refers to the first address 
beyond the initialized data, and the symbol etext refers to 
the first address beyond the program text. The linker 
treats a user definition of any of these symbols as an 
error. The symbols end, edata, and etext are also defined 
by the linker, but only if the program contains a reference 
to these symbols and does not define them {see end (30 for 
details). 

Through its options, the link editor gives users great 
flexibility. However, those who invoke the linker directly 
must assume some added responsibilities. Input options 
should ensure the following properties for programs: 

• When the link editor is called through cc(l), a 
start-up routine is linked with the user's program. 
This routine calls exit(2) after execution of the 
main program. If users call Id directly, they must 
ensure that the program always calls exit() rather 
than falling through the end of the entry routine. 

• When linking for use with the symbolic debugger cdb, 
the user must ensure that the program contains a 
routine called main. Also, the user must link in 
the file /usr/lib/end.o as the last file named on 
the command line. 

There is no guarantee that the linker will pick up files 
from archive libraries and include them in the final program 
in the same relative order that they occur within the 
library. 

DEPENDENCIES 

Series 300/400 

The default entry point is taken to be text location 
0x0 (which is also the default origin of the program 
text) if shared libraries are not used. Otherwise, the 
entry point is taken to be the first text location 
after the extension header placed at the beginning of 
the text segment by Id for use by /lib/dld .sl. This 
corresponds to the first procedure m the fi rst input 
file that the linker reads. If the C startup routine 
/lib/crtO.o is the first object file on the command 

line, the label start denotes the entry point. Use the 
-e option to select a different entry point. 

The version number specified with the -V option must be 
in the range 0 through 32767. Use of this option is 
not recommended because this field is used by several 
HP-UX commands that expect particular values here. 
Consult the C Programmer 's Guide for more details on 
the version fieldT 


B-31 




COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


Hie placement of -L options relative to -1 is not 
significant. 

The Series 300/400 linker does not support the 
following options: -m, -z, and -Z. 

On Series 300/400 systems, the conpilers place an 
underscore at the beginning of all external names. 

Thus, the symbol _end appears to the linker as _end. 

Id does not generate an output file if any other errors 
occur during its operation. 

Series 700/800 

The linker searches for the symbol $START$ as the 
program entry point. This symbol is defined in the 
file /lib/crtO.o, which should be the first file loaded 
for all programs regardless of source language. Use 
the -e option to select a different entry point. 

When invoking Id directly to link a C program whose 
main procedure is located in a library, the -u main 
option should be used to force the linker to load main 
from the library, since this symbol is not actually 
referenced until the jstart routine is loaded from the 
C library. When using cc(l) to link the program, the 
compiler automatically passes this option to the 
linker. Because of this behavior, do not use cc to 
link a program containing a FORTRAN or Pascal main 
program; use f77 or pc instead. 

Nonsharable, executable files generated with the -N 
option cannot be executed via exec (2). Typically, -N 
is used when rebuilding the kernel or when preparing an 
image for dynamic loading. 

When the -A option is used to do an incremental link, 
the linker generates extra code where a procedure call 
crosses a quadrant boundary (a quadrant is one 
gigabyte, or one fourth of the addressing space). On 
Series 700/800 systems, text is normally in the first 
quadrant and data is in the second quadrant. When an 
object file is intended to be read into an already- 
executing program, both its code and data must be 
placed in the second quadrant, since the first quadrant 
is set to read-only. Procedure calls from one quadrant 
to the other require the extra code, called inter-space 
calling stubs. The linker generates an "export" stub 
for the entry point designated in the incremental link, 
and "inport" stubs for each procedure in the basis 
program that is called by the new object file. The 
import stubs require the existence of a routine in the 
basis program called _sr4export, which is supplied in 
/lib/crtO.o. If a procedure in the basis program is 


B—32 







COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


called indirectly by the new object file, the linker 
cannot detect the crossing of the quadrant boundary, 
and therefore will not generate the needed stub. A 
special version of $$dyncall placed in /lib/dyncall.o 
is provided for handling the inter-quadrant branch. 
This routine should be linked in when the -A option is 
in effect. 

The Series 700/800 linker does not support the -V 
option. 

The following options are specific to the Series 
700/800 linker: 

-y symbol Indicate each file in which symbol 
appears. Many such options can be 
given to trace many symbols, but -y 
oust precede each one. 

-Cn Set the maximum parameter-checking 

level to n. The default maximum is 
3. See tKe language manuals for the 
meanings of the parameter-checking 
level. 

-D offset Set the origin (in hexadecimal) for 
the data space. The default value 
for offset is 0x40001000. 

~G Strip all unloadable data from the 

output file. This option is 
typically used to strip debug 
information. 

-S Generate an Initial Program Loader 

(IPL) auxiliary header for the output 
file, instead of the default HP-UX 
auxiliary header. 

-T Save the load data and relocation 

information in tenporary files 
instead of memory during linking. 

This option reduces the virtual 
memory requirements of the linker. 

If the TWPDIR environment variable is 
set, the temporary files are created 
in the specified directory, rather 
than in /tmp. 

Id treats both duplicate symbols and unresolved symbols 
Tn the same manner: an output file is generated and 
marked as non-executable if errors occur during its 
operation.

F 1.1 Interfacing the Ada Language with Other Languages 

Your Ada programs can call subprograms written in other languages when you 
use the predefined pragmas INTERFACE and INTERFACE.NAME. Ada supports 
subprograms written in these languages: 

■ PA-RISC Assembly Language. 

■ HP C. 

■ HP Pascal. 

■ HP FORTRAN 77 for HP 9000 Series 600, 700, and S00 computers. 

Compiler products from vendors other than Hewlett-Packard may not conform 
to the parameter passing conventions given below. See section U F 11. Calling 
External Subprograms from Ada” for detailed information, instructions, and 
examples for interfacing your Ada programs with the above languages. 

In addition, data objects declared in other languages can be made accessible 
to Ada by using the ’IMPORT attribute of the SYSTEM. ADDRESS type (see 
“F 2.2 Attribute SYSTEM.ADDRESSIMPORT” in Chapter 2). Data 
objects declared in a global Ada scope can be referenced by a non-Ada 
external subprogram when you use the predefined pragma EXPORT. Alternative 
names for a global Ada data object can be defined when you use the pragma 
EXTERNAL.NAME.

F 1.1.1 Pragma INTERFACE 

The pragma INTERFACE (Ada RM, section 13.9) informs the compiler that 
a non-Ada external subprogram will be supplied when the Ada program is 
linked. Pragma INTERFACE specifies the programming language used in the 
external subprogram and the name of the Ada interfaced subprogram. The 
corresponding parameter calling convention to be used in the interface is 
implicitly defined in the language specification. 

Syntax 

pragma INTERFACE (Language-name, Adasubprogram-name); 


Parameter 

Description 

Language-name 

is one of ASSEMBLER. C. PASCAL, or FORTRAN. 

Adas-ubprogram-name 

is the name used within the Ada program when 
referring to the interfaced external subprogram. 


It is possible to supply a pragma INTERFACE to a library-level subprogram. 


F 1 . implementation Supported Pragmas 1-3

I 

F 1.1.2 Pragma INTERFACE.NAME 

Ada provides the implementation-defined pragma INTERFACE.NAME to associate 
an alternative name with a non-Ada external subprogram that has been 
specified to the Ada program by the pragma INTERFACE. 


Syntax 

pragma INTERFACE.NAME ( A da.subprogram,name. 

" ExlemaLsubprogram.name" ); 


Parameter 

Description 

Ada. subprogram-name 

is the name when referring to the interfaced external 
subprogram. 

Ezternal.subprogram.name 

is the external name used outside the Ada program 


You must use pragma INTERFACE.NAME whenever the interfaced subprogram 
name contains characters not acceptable within Ada identifiers or when the 
interfaced subprogram name contains uppercase letter(s). You can also use 
a pragma INTERFACE.NAME if you want your Ada subprogram name to i 
different than the external subprogram name. 

If a pragma INTERFACE.NAME is not supplied, the external subprogram name is 
the name of the Ada subprogram specified in the pragma INTERFACE, with all 
alphabetic characters shifted to lowercase letters. 

The compiler truncates the name to 255 characters if necessary. 

Pragma INTERFACE.NAME is allowed at the same places in an Ada program as 
pragma INTERFACE (see Ada RM. section 13.9.) Pragma INTERFACE.NAME 
must follow the corresponding pragma INTERFACE. If the pragma INTERFACE 
appears in a declarative part, the pragma INTERFACE.NAME must appear 
within the same declarative part, although it need not immediately follow the 
pragma INTERFACE. If the pragma INTERFACE appears outside of any program 
unit, as it does when being applied to a library-level subprogram, the pragma 
INTERFACE.NAME must appear after the pragma INTERFACE and before any 
subsequent compilation unit. 


1-4 FI. Implementation Supported Pragmas 













F 1.1.3 Example of INTERFACE and INTERFACE.NAME 

The following example illustrates the INTERFACE and INTERFACE.NAME 
pragmas. 

package SAMPLE.LIB is 

function SAMPLE.DEVICE (X : INTEGER) return INTEGER; 
function PROCESS.SAMPLE (X : INTEGER) return INTEGER; 

private 

pragma INTERFACE (ASSEMBLER, SAMPLE.DEVICE ); 
pragma INTERFACE (C, PROCESS.SAMPLE ); 

pragma INTERFACE.NAME (SAMPLE.DEVICE, "DevlO" ); 
pragma INTERFACE.NAME (PROCESS.SAMPLE, "DoSajnple" ); 

end SAMPLE.LIB; 

This example defines two Ada subprograms that are known in Ada code as 
SAMPLE.DEVICE and PROCESS.SAMPLE. When a call to SAMPLE.DEVICE is 
executed, the program generates a call to the externally supplied assembly 
function DevlO. Likewise, when a call to PROCESS.SAMPLE is executed, 
the program will generate a call to the externally supplied HP C function 
DoSample. 

By using the pragma INTERFACE.NAME, the names for the external subprograms 
to associate with the Ada subprogram are explicitly identified. If pragma 
INTERFACE.NAME had not been used, the external names referenced would be 
sarnple.device and process.sample. 


F 1. implementation Supported Pragmas 1*5

F 1.1.4 Additional Information on INTERFACE and 
INTERFACE.NAME 

Either an object file or an object library that defines the external subprograms 
must be provided as a command line parameter to the Ada binder. The 
command line parameter must be provided to the linker ld(l) if you call 
the linker separately. If you do not provide an object file that contains the 
definition for the external subprogram, the HP-UX linker, ld(l), wiil issue an 
error message. 

To avoid conflicts with the Ada Runtime System, the names of interfaced 
external routines should not begin with the letters ‘‘alsy” or “A_’ r because the 
Ada runtime system prefixes its internal routines with these prefixes. 

When you want to call an HP-UX system call from Ada code, you should use 
a pragma INTERFACE with C as the language name. You might need to use a 
pragma INTERFACE.NAME to explicitly supply the external name. This external 
name must be the same as the name of the system call that you want to call. 
(See section 2 of the HP-UX Reference for details.) In this case it is not 
necessary to provide the C object file to the binder, because it will be found 
automatically when the linker searches the system library. 

When you want to call an HP-UX library function from Ada code, you should 
use a pragma INTERFACE with C as the language name. You should use pragma 
INTERFACE.NAME to explicitly supply the external name. This externa] name 
must be exactly the same as the name of the library function. (See section 3 of 
the HP-UX Reference for details. ) If your library function is located in either 
the Standard C Library or the Math Library, it is not necessary to provide the 
object library to the binder because the binder always requests that the linker 
search these two libraries. If your library function is located in any of the other 
standard libraries, you must provide the appropriate -lr option to the binder. 
The binder will pass this information onto the linker as a request to search the 
specified library. 


1*6 F 1. Implementation Supported Pragmas 








Caution 


All array and record type parameters are passed by reference 
from Ada code to non-Ada interfaced code. In particular, 
arrays and records occupying 64 bits or less of storage are 
passed by reference and are not passed by copy, as is the 
standard PA-RISC calling convention. Therefore, non-Ada 
code expecting to receive such array or record parameters 
must expect to receive them by reference, not by copy. C 
should declare such parameters to be appropriate pointer types: 
Pascal should declare such parameters to be VAR parameters: 
FORTRAN always expects explicit parameters by reference. 
Note that array and record type parameters occupying more 
than 64 bits of storage are passed by reference, both by Ada 
and by the standard PA-RISC calling convention, and require 
no special precautions. 


See section li F 11. Calling External Subprograms From Ada“ for additional 
information on using pragma INTERFACE and pragma INTERFACE_NAME. 


F 1. Implementation Supported Pragmas 1-7 








F 1.1.5 Pragma EXPORT 

The pragma EXPORT allows for data objects and subprograms declared in 
a global Ada scope to be referenced by a non-Ada external subprogram. 
Pragma EXPORT specifies the programming language and the name of the 
Ada data object or subprogram. The default name for the externally visible 
symbol is the name of the Ada object in all lowercase letters. The pragma 
EXTERNAL.NAME (described in section “F 1.1.6 Pragma EXTERNAL.NAME”) 
can be used to change this default. 


Syntax 

pragma EXPORT {Language.name, Ada.name) ; 


Parameter 

Description 

Language. name 

is one of ASSEMBLER. C PASCAL, or FORTRAN 

Ada.name 

is the simple name of the Ada data object or Ada 
subprogram that is to be made visible to a non-Ada 
subprogram 


The pragma EXPGRT must occur in a declarative part and applies only to data 
objects or subprograms declared in the same declarative part: that is. generic 
instantiated objects or renamed objects are excluded In addition, if an Ada 
subprogram name is specified to pragma EXPORT there must be a unique Ada 
subprogram with that name (that is. the Ada subprogram name must not be 
overloaded). 

The pragma EXPOP.T can on!> be used for data object* with direct allocation 
mode (objects are allocated with indirect allocation mode if they are dynamic 
or have a significant size: see section "F -1.9 Data Allocation", for details) and 
for subprograms that are declared in a library par hag*' or m a package that is 
ultimately nested in a library package. The pragma cannot be used for a data 
object or subprogram that is declared within another subprogram, nor can it 
be used for a lib:..ry level subprogram. When applied to an Ada subprogram, 
the pragma EXPORT is additionally restricted to only being specified in a iibrarv 
package specification. 


1*8 Fi. Implementation Supported Pragmas 














The pragma EXPORT cannot be used for a subprogram that: 

■ has an IN OUT or OUT parameter 

■ has an unconstrained array parameter 

■ has a task type parameter 

■ is a function with an array result type 

■ is a function with a record result type 

■ is a function %vith a task type result type 
• has a pragma INTERFACE also specified 

■ has a pragma INLINE also specified 

When using pragma EXPORT with one or more Ada subprograms, the main 
program unit must be an Ada procedure. This Ada procedure can call routines 
in other languages that themselves call Ada. but the main procedure itself must 
be in Ada. 

Caution The name of any exported subprogram (either the default name 
or the name specified by pragma EXTERNAL.NAME) is a linker 
symbol visible to all components of the application. If this 
name happens to be the same as an HP-UX system call, it 
causes program failure in unexpected situations. For example, 
if the name of your exported routine is close, it intercepts all 
calls to the system routine clcse(2). This causes failure of the 
Ada I/O system. 

For this reason, make sure that the name you choose is unique, 
and not either a system call or m use by some other part of

F 1.1.6 Pragma EXTERNAL.NAME 

The pragma EXTERNAL.NAME is used to supply an alternate externally visible 
name for a global Ada data object or Ada subprogram that has been exported 
using a pragma EXPORT. The pragma EXTERNAL.NAME can be used anywhere 
in an Ada program where the pragma EXPORT is allowed. The pragma 
EXTERNAL.NAME must occur after the corresponding pragma EXPORT and within 
the same library package as the corresponding pragma EXPORT. 


Syntax 

pragma EXTERNAL.NAME (Ada^name, " ExtemaLname") ; 


Parameter 

Description 

A da.name 

is the simple name of the Ada data object or Ada 
subprogram that is to be made visible to a non-Ada 
subprogram. 

External _ name 

is the externally visible name that is to be accessed in 
the non-Ada subprogram. 


You must us* the pragma EXTERNAL.NAME whenever the externally visible 
name contain; characters not acceptable within Ada identifiers or when the 
externally visible name contains an uppercase letter or letters. You can also 
use the pragma EXTERNAL.NAME if you want your Ada data object name or Ada 
subprogram name to be different than the externally visible name. 

If a pragma EXTER.NAL.NAME is not supplied, the externally visible name is the 
name of the Ada data object or subprogram specified in the pragma EXPORT, 
with all alphabetic characters shifted to lowercase letters. 

The compiler truncates the name to 255 characters if necessary.

F 1.1.8 Pragma EXPORT Applied to Ada Subprograms 

In this section, the term “exported Ada subprogram” refers to an Ada 
subprogram to which the pragma EXPORT has been applied. An exported Ada 
subprogram can be called from Ada code as usual; the subprogram will not 
behave any differently just because the pragma EXPORT has been specified. 

F 1.1.8.1 Calling an Ada Subprogram from Non-Ada Code 

An exported Ada subprogram must not be called from non-Ada code before 
the body of the exported Ada subprogram has been elaborated. If non-Ada 
code calls an exported Ada subprogram prior to the elaboration of the Ada 
subprogram body, the results are unpredictable and could lead to program 
failure. 

When calling an exported Ada subprogram from non-Ada code, the parameters 
passed to Ada from non-Ada code must be compatible with the data types and 
sizes of the parameters that the exported Ada subprogram is expecting. 

Exported Ada subprograms can only have parameters of mode IN. All record 
and array parameters must be passed by non-Ada code to Ada by reference. 

If an exported Ada subprogram has default parameter values, these values 
are ignored when the exported Ada subprogram is called from non-Ada code. 
Non-Ada code must always pass all parameters explicitly to Ada code. 

With respect to parameter type compatibility, the action of calling an 
exported Ada subprogram from non-Ada code is very similar to calling 
non-Ada code (via pragma INTERFACE) from Ada code. Section “F 11. Calling 
External Subprograms From Ada", describes the correspondences, or lack 
of correspondences, between Ada types and non-Ada types and should be 
consulted for information on which non-Ada objects are compatible with which 
Ada objects. 


1-14 FI. Implementation Supported Pragmas 





Caution All array and record type parameters are expected to be passed 
by reference from non-Ada cod« to exported Ada code. In 
particular, arrays and records occupying 64 bits or less of 
storage must be passed by reference and must not be passed 
by copy, as is the standard PA-RISC calling convention. 
Therefore, non-Ada code expecting to pass such array or 
record type parameters to Ada must pass such parameters 
by reference not by copy. C must pass the addresses of such 
parameters cast to appropriate pointer types; Pascal must 
declare such parameters to be VAR parameters in the EXTERNAL 
declaration: FORTRAN always passes explicit parameters 
by reference. Note that array and record type parameters 
occupying more that 64 bits of storage are passed by reference, 
both by Ada and by the standard PS-RISC calling convention, 
and require no special precautions. 


The next sections describe general conditions and constraints that apply to 
Ada being called from Assembly, C. FORTRAN, and Pascal. 

Assembler 

Ada expects any parameter passed, except LONG-FLOAT by value, to be 
passed as a 4 byte quantity, sign extended as necessary, in the location (register 
or memoryj appropriate for its parameter type and position in the parameter 
list (LONG-FLOAT by value is expected to be passed as a 8 byte quantity). 

C 

Ada expects any parameter passed, except LONG-FLOAT by value, to be 
passed as a 4 byte quantity, sign extended as necessary, in the location (register 
or memory) appropriate for its parameter type and position in the parameter 
list (LONG-FLOAT by value is expected to be passed as a 8 byte quantity). 

If an exported Ada subprogram is called from C. and C is operating in 
non-ANSI mode, or it is operating in ANSI mode, but lacks a function 
prototype for the called function. C will convert all float value* to double 
when passing them as parameters. Therefor*', passing parameters front C 
to Ada when Ada is expecting a parameter of type FLOAT requires that C be 
operating in ANSI mode'with a function piototype for the Ada subprogram. 


F 1. Implementation Supported Pragmas 1-15

FORTRAN 

The exported Ada subprogram parameters that correspond to parameters 
passed explicitly from FORTRAN must ail be of an access type or of type 
SYSTEMADDRESS as FORTRAN passes such parameters by reference. 

The exported Ada subprogram parameters that correspond to parameters 
passed implicitly from FORTRAN (such as the length of a FORTRAN string 
parameter; see “F 11.4.4 String Types and HP FORTRAN 77 Subprograms" 
in Chapter 11) must be of an appropriate scalar type (not an access type nor 
SYSTEMADDRESS). This type is usually INTEGER. 

Pascal 

Ada expects any parameter passed, except LONG-FLOAT by value, to 
be passed as a 4 byte quantity, sign extended as necessary, in the location 
(register or memory) appropriate for its parameter type and position in the 
parameter list (LONG-FLOAT by value is expected to be passed as a 8 byte 
quantity). The exported Ada subprogram parameters that correspond to 
Pascal VAR parameters must all be of the appropriate access type or of type 
SYSTEM. ADDRESS as Pascal passes such parameters by reference. Non-scaJar 
parameters can only be passed to Ada using Pascal VAR parameters, they may 
not be passed using Pascal value parameters. The exported Ada subprogram 
parameters that correspond to Pascal value parameters must all be of an 
appropriate scalar, access, or SYSTEM. ADDRESS type as Pascal passes such 
parameters by value.

* value. 

•/ 

dres * Func.froa.Ada (flag ? 1 ; 0);

F.l.1.8.2 Exceptions 

An exported Ada subprogram must not allow an exception to propagate out of 
itself if it wa.~ railed by a non-Ada caller. If an exception is propagated bark 
to a non-Ada caller, the behavior of the Ada runtime is unpredictable am! mav 
result in program failure. If the exported Ada subprogram was called by Ada 
code and the Ada subprogram is aware of that fact, it can safely propagate 
exceptions out of itself.

F. 1.1.8.3 Obtaining the Non-Ada Call Address in Ada at Runtime 

When pragma EXPORT (and optionally pragma EXTERNAL.NAME) is applied 
to an Ada subprogram, an externally visible name is created such that the 
Ada subprogram can be called directly by that externally visible name from 
non-Ada code. However, the Ada code may need to obtain the address of 
an exported Ada subprogram at run time. For example, it might pass such 
an address as a parameter to non-Ada code so that the non-Ada code can 
use the address to call an Ada subprogram (a ‘•callback’ 1 situation). The 
function EXPORTED.SUBPROGRAM is supplied in the package SYSTEM to obtain 
the “non-Ada call address” of an exported Ada subprogram. The function 
SYSTEM.EXPORTED.SUBPROGRAM is passed a single parameter, the ’ADDRESS 
value of an exported Ada subprogram, and it returns the address which 
non-Ada code must call to invoke that Ada subprogram. See section “F 3.1 
The Package SYSTEM 1 ', for more information. 


Caution The value o r ’ADDRESS of an exported Ada subprogram is 
not the address that non-Ada code should call to invoke 
the exported Ada subprogram. The address that non-Ada 
code must call to invoke an Ada subprogram is obtained as 
the result of passing the 'ADDRESS value of the exported Ada 
subprogram to SYSTEM.EXPORTED.SUBPROGRAM: the function 
result value is the address that the non-Ada code must call. If 
non-Ada code attempts to call an exported Ada subprogram 
using the ’ADDRESS value for that subprogram, the result is 
unpredictable and will most likely result in program failure.

F.l.1.8.4 Bind-Time Issues 


i 


1 



To ensure that the desired exported Ada subprograms are present in the 
executable program produced by the binder, the Ada library level packages 
that contain those exported subprograms must be “withed” into at least one 
Ada program unit that will be present in the executable program. No special 
action is needed if the Ada program already uses any of the facilities from a 
library level package that contains exported Ada subprograms because that 
package will, of necessity, already be “withed” somewhere in the program. 

Only if the Ada program does not use any of the facilities from a library level 
package that contains exported Ada subprograms (for example, if that package 
only contains exported Ada subprograms that are called directly from non-Ada 
code), will it be necessary to take extra action to ensure the presence of the 
exported Ada subprograms in the executable program. If no obvious place to 
“with” such a package exists, the package can always be "withed” into the 
main program procedure. 

Note The Ada binder supports a mechanism to eliminate uncalled 

subprograms. Within Ada compilation units, subprograms 
that are never called (or have their ADDRESS taken! can 
be eliminated from the executable program produced by the 
binder. Because exported Ada subprograms legitimately might 
never i>e called by Ada code i for example, if they are only 
called by non-Ada code), they are automatically protected from 
uncalled subprogram elimination. Therefore, if your program 
"withed” a library level package that declares one or more 
exported Ada subprogram', those subprograms will always be 
present in the executable file produced by the binder (even if 
they are also not called from non-Ada code]. In addition, if any 
of tiie exported Ada subprograms call other Ada subprograms, 
those other Ada subprograms (and in turn, repeatedly, any Ada 
subprograms they call ) will also be present in the executable 
program. Therefore, care must be taken with respect to the 
placement of exported Ada subprograms m packages and 
tli** “vithing" of those packages into your program to avoid 
including in your executable file the code for Ada subprograms 
that your program does not call (either from Ada or from 
non-Ada code).

P.1.1.8.5 HP-UX Signal Handlers in Ada 

Although possible, it is not recommended that you apply the pragma EXPORT 
to an Ada subprogram so that the Ada subprogram can be specified as an 
HP-UX signal handler. If you do so, the Ada subprogram that is to act as a 
signal handler must be compiled with checks off (using the -R option) and it 
must not call any Ada runtime system routines. The Ada subprogram must 
not call HP-UX routines or other non-Ada code, either via pragma INTERFACE 
or via a binding. If the Ada subprogram calls another Ada subprogram, the 
called subprogram must follow the same constraints. 

Using the interrupt entry mechanism to provide Ada subprograms as a signal 
handlers is preferred. This is described in section “F 12. Interrupt Entries”.

F 1.2 Using Text Processing Tools 

The pragma INDENT is a formatting command that affects the HP supplied 
formatter, ada.fcrmat(l). This pragma does not affect the compilation listing 
output of the compiler. The pragmas LIST and PAGE are formatting commands 
that affect the compilation listing output of the compiler. 


F 1.2.1 Pragma INDENT 

Ada provides the implementation-defined pragma INDENT to assist in 
formatting Ada source code. You can place these pragmas in the source code 
to control the actions of ada.format(l).

F 1.2.2 Pragma LIST 

The pragma LIST affects only the compilation listing output of the compiler. 
It specifies that the listing of the compilation is to be continued or suspended 
until a LIST pragma with the opposite argument is given within the same 
compilation. The pragma itself is always listed if the compiler is producing a 
listing. The compilation listing feature of the compiler is enabled by issuing 
one of the compiler options -L or -B to the ada(l) command. 


Syntax

F 1.3 Affecting the Layout of Array and Record Types 

The pragmas PACK and IMPROVE affect the layout of array and record types in 
memory. 


F 1.3.1 Pragma PACK 

The pragma PACK takes the simple name of an array type as its only argument. 
The allowed positions for this pragma and the restrictions on the named type 
are governed by the same rules as for a representation clause. The pragma 
specifies that storage minimization should be the main criterion when selecting 
the representation of the given type. 


Syntax 

pragma PACK {array, type.name) \ 

The pragma PACK is not implemented for record types on Ada. You can use a 
record representation clause to minimize the storage requirements for a record 
type. 

The pragma PACK is discussed further in section “F 4.7 Array Types." 


F 1.3.2 Pragma IMPROVE 

The pragma IMPROVE, an implementation-defined pragma, suppresses implicit 
components in a record type. 

Syntax 

pragma IMPROVE ( TIME I SPACE , [ON =>] nrord.lype.nuiue) ; 

Th** default for pragma IMPROVE is TIME. This pragma is discussed futther in 
section "F 4.S Record Types.’’

F 1.4 Generating Code 

The pragmas ELABORATE, INLINE, and SUPPRESS direct the compiler to 
generate different code than would have been normally generated. These 
pragmas can change the run time behavior of an Ada program unit. 


F 1.4.1 Pragma ELABORATE 

The pragma ELABORATE is used when a dependency upon elaboration order 
exists. Normally the Ada compiler is giv^-n the freedom to elaborate library 
units in any order. This pragma specifies that the bodies for each of the library 
units named in the pragma must be elaborated before the current compilation 
unit. If the current compilation unit is a subunit, the bodies of the named 
library units must be elaborated before the body of the parent of the current 
subunit. 


Syntax 

pragma ELABORATE (library_uni(~name [, librnry_unit-namc ] ... ); 


This pragma lakes as its argument; one or more simple names, each of which 
denotes a library unit. This pragma is only allowed immediately after the 
context clause of a compilation unit (before the subsequent library unit or 
secondary unit). Each argument must be the simple name of a library unit 
that was identified by the context clause. (See the Ada R\f, section 10.5. for 
additional information on elaboration of library units .) 


1-24 F 1. Implementation Supported Pragmas 




F 1.4.2 Pragma INLINE 

The pragma INLINE specifies that the subprogram bodies should be expanded 
inline at each call whenever possible; in the case of a generic subprogram, 
the pragma applies to calls of its instantiations. If the subprogram name 
is overloaded, the pragma applies to every overloaded subprogram. Note 
that pragma INLINE has no effect on function calls appearing inside package 
specifications. 


Syntax 

pragma INLINE (subprogram.namc [, subprogram-name] ... ); 


This pragma takes as its arguments one or more names, each of which is either 
the name of a subprogram or the name of a generic subprogram. This pragma 
is only allowed at the place of a declarative item in a declarative part or 
package specification, or after a library unit in a compilation, but before any 
subsequent compilation unit. See the Ada RM . section 6.3.2, for additional 
information on inline expansion of subprograms. 

This pragma can be suppressed at compile time by issuing the compiler option 
-I to the ada(l) command. 


F 1. Implementation Supported Pragmas 1-25 




F 1.4.3 Pragma SUPPRESS 

The pragma SUPPRESS allows the compiler to omit the given check from the 
place of the pragma to the end of the declarative region associated with the 
innermost enclosing block statement or program unit. For a pragma given in 
a package specification, the permission extends to the end of the scope of the 
named entity. 


Syntax 

pragma SUPPRESS (check-identifier l, [ON *>] name] ); 


The pragma SUPPRESS takes as arguments the identifier of a check and 
optionally the name of either an object, a type or subtype, a subprogram, a 
task unit, or a generic unit. This pragma is only allowed at the place of a 
declarative item in a declarative part or a package specification. 

If the pragma includes a name, the permission to omit the given check is 
further restricted: it is given only for operations on the named object or 
on all objects of the base type of a named type or subtype: for calls of a 
named subprogram: for activations of tasks of the named task type; or for 
instantiations of the given generic unit. (See the Ada RM. section 11.7, for 
additional information on suppressing run time checks.) 

The compiler can be directed to suppress all run time checks by issuing the 
compiler option -R to the ada(l) command. The compiler can also be directed 
to suppress all run time checks except for stack checks by issuing the compiler 
option -C to the ada(l) command.

F 1.5 Affecting Run Time Behavior 

The pragmas PRIORITY and SHARED affect the run time behavior of a tasking 
program. 


F 1.5.1 Pragma PRIORITY 

The pragma PRIORITY specifies the priority to be used for the task or tasks of 
the task type. When the pragma is applied within the outermost declarative 
part of the main subprogram, it specifies the priority to be used for the 
environment task, which is the task that encloses the main subprogram. If a 
pragma PRIORITY is applied to a subprogram that is not the main subprogram, 
it is ignored. 

Syntax 

pragma PRIORITY ( stotic-eipression ); 

The pragma PRIORITY takes as its argument a static expression of the 
predefined integer subtype PRIGRITY. For Ada. the range of the subtype 
PRIORITY is 1 to 1G. Note that during an entry call invoked by an interrupt 
handler, the priority of a task is temporarily raised to a value higher than 
PRIORITY*LAST. The priority value is specified when the interrupt handler is 
installed: see section "F 12.6 Associating an Ada Handier with an HP-UX 
Signal", for details. 

The PRIORITY pragma is only allowed within the specification of a ta^k unit or 
within the outermost declarative part of the main subprogram. 

These ta>-k priorities are only relative to other Ada tasks that are concurrently 
executing with the environment task. This pragma does not change the 
priority of an Ada task or the Ada environment task relative to other HP-UX 
processes. All the Ada tasks execute within a «mgie HP-UX process. This 
HP-UX process executes together with other HP-UX processes and is scheduled 
by the HP-UX kernal. To change the priority of an HP-UX process. se« rhe 
command nice(l). See the Ada KM. section ‘h>. for additional information on 
task priorities. 


F 1. Implementation Supported Pragmas 1-27 





F 1.5.2 Pragma SHARED 

The pragma SHARED specifies that every read or update of the variable is 
a synchronization point for that variable. The type for the variable object 
is limited to scalar or access types because each read or update must be 
implemented as an indivisible operation. 

The effect of pragma SHARED on a variable object is to suppress the promotion 
of this object to a register by the compiler. The compiler suppresses this 
optimization and ensures that any reference to the variable always retrieves the 
value stored by the most recent update operation. 


Syntax 

pragma SHARED (.variable^simple^name) ; 

The pragma SHARED takes as its argument a simple name of a variable. This 
pragma is only allowed for a variable declared by an object declaration and 
whose type is a scalar or access type; the variable declaration and the pragma 
must both occur (in this order) within the same declarative part or package 
specification. 

See the Ada RM, section 9.11, for additional information on shared variables.

section 13.7.2, there are five implementation-defined representation attributes: 

’OFFSET 
’RECORD.SIZE 
’VARIANT.INDEX 
’ARRAY.DESCRIPTOR 
’RECORD.DESCRIPTOR 

These implementation-defined attributes are only used to refer to implicit 
components of record type'- inside a record representation clause. Using these 
attributes outside of a record representation clause - vill cause a compiler error 
message. For additional information, see section U F 4.S Record Types". 


F 2. Implementation-Dependent Attributes 2-1 




F 2.1 Limitation of the Attribute ’ADDRESS 

The attribute ’ADDRESS is implemented for ail entities that have meaningful 
addresses. The compiler will issue the following warning message when the 
prefix for the attribute ’ADDRESS refers to an object that has a meaningless 
address: 

The prefix of the ’ADDRESS attribute denotes a program unit that 
has no meaningful address: the result of such an evaluation is 
SYSTEM.NULL.ADDRESS. 

The following entities do not have meaningful addresses and will cause the 
above compilation warning if used as a prefix to ’ADDRESS: 

■ A constant that is implemented as an immediate value (that is, a constant 
that does not have any space allocated for it). 

■ A package identifier that is not a library unit or a subunit. 

■ A function that renames an enumeration literal. 

Additionally, the attribute ’ ADDRESS, when applied to a task or task type, 
returns different values depending on the elaboration status of the task body. 

In particular, the value returned by the attribute 'ADDRESS changes after 
the elaboration of the task body. Therefore, the attribute task ’ADDRESS 
or task_ type ’ ADDRESS should Ire used only after the body of the task is 
elaborated.

F 2.2 Attribute SYSTEM. ADDRESS’IMPORT 

This implementation of Ada defines an additional attribute for the type 
SYSTEM.ADDRESS. The attribute ’IMPORT can be applied to the type 
SYSTEM.ADDRESS. This attribute is a function with two parameters, the 
parameters are described in the table below. 



Syntax

F 4. Type Representation 


This chapter explains how data objects are represented and allocated by the 
HP Ada compiler for the HP 9000 Series 600. 700. and S00 Computer Systems 
and how to control this using representation clauses. 

The representation of a data object is closely connected with its type. 
Therefore, this section successively describes the representation rf enumeration, 
integer, floating point, fixed point, access, task, array, and record types. 

For each class of type, the representation of the corresponding data object 
is described. Except for array and reco d types, the description for each 
class of type is independent of the others. Because array and record types 
are composite types, it is necessary to understand the representation of their 
components. 

Ada provides several methods to control the layout and size of data objects: 
these methods are listed in Table 4-1.

F 4.1 Enumeration Types 


Syntax (Enumeration representation clause) 
for enumeration-type-name use aggregate; 


The aggregate used to specify this mapping is written as a one-dimensional 
aggregate, for which the index subtype is the enumeration type and the 
component type is universaLtnteger. An others choice is not permitted in this 
aggregate. 

F 4.1.1 Internal Codes of Enumeration Literals 

When no enumeration representation clause applies to an enumeration type, 
the internal code associated with an enumeration literal is the position number 
of the enumeration literal. Thus, for an enumeration type with n elements, the 
interna! codes are the integers 0, 1, 2, .. , n-1. 

An enumeration representation clause can be provided to specify the value of 
each internal code as described in the Ada RM , section 13-3- The values used 
to specify the internal codes must be in the range -(2**31) to (2**31)-1. 

The following example illustrates the use of an enumeration representation 
clause. 


4-2 F 4. Type Representation 





Example 


type COLOR is (RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN. AQUA, BLUE, VIOLET); 

for COLOR use 

(RED => 10, 

ORANGE =>20, 

YELLOW => 40, 

GREEN *> 80, 

AQUA => 160, 

BLUE *> 320, 

VIOLET => 640); 

In the above example, the internal representation for GREEN will be the 
integer SO. The attributes ’PRED and ’SUCC will still return YELLOW and 
AQUA, respectively. Also, section 13-3(6) in the Ada RM states that the 'POS 
attribute will still return the positional value of the enumeration literal. In the 
case of GREEN, the value that ’POS returns will be 3 and not 80. The only way 
to examine the internal representation of the enumeration literal is to write the 
value to a file or use UNCHECKED.CQNVERSION to examine the value in memory. 


F 4. Type Representation 4-3 





F 4.1.2 Minimum Size of an Enumeration Type or Subtype 

The minimum size of an enumeration subtype is the minimum number of bits 
necessary for representing the internal codes in normal binary form. 

A static subtype of a null range has a minimum size of one. Otherwise, define 
m and M to be the smallest and largest values for the internal codes values of 
the subtype. The minimum size L is determined as follows: 


Value of m 

Calculation of L - 
smallest positive integer such that: 

Representation 

m > 0 

V/ < 1 L - 1 

Unsigned 

m < 0 

-? L -' < m and M < 2 L ~ l - 1 

Signed two’s complement 


Example 

type COLOR is (RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, AQUA, BLUE, VIOLET); 
— The minimum size of COLOR is 3 bits. 

subtype SUNNY.COLOR is COLOR range ORANGE .. YELLOW; 

-- The minimum size of COLOR is 2 bits. 

-- because the internal code for YELLOW is 2 
-- and (2**1)-1 <= 2 <= (2**2)-l 

type TEMPERATURE is (FREEZING, COLD. MILD. WARM, HOT); 
for TEMPERATURE use 

(FREEZING *> -10, 

COLD => 0, 

MILD => 10. 

WARM => 20, 

HOT => 30); 

-- The minimum size of TEMPERATURE is 6 bits 
-- because with six bits ve can represent signed 
-- integers between -32 and 31. 


4-4 F 4. Type Representation 















F 4.1.3 Size of an Enumeration Type 

When no size specification is applied to an enumeration type, the objects of 
that type are represented as signed machine integers. The HP 9000 Series 
600, 700, and 800 Computer Systems provides 8-, 16-, and 32-bit integers, and 
the compiler automatically selects the smallest signed machine integer that 
can hold all of the internal codes of the enumeration type. Thus, the default 
size for enumeration types with 128 or less elements is 8 bits, the default si 2 e 
for enumeration types with 129 to 32768 elements is 16 bits. Because this 
implementation does not support enumeration types with more than 3276S 
elements, a size specification or enumeration representation clause must be used 
for enumeration types that use a 32-bit representation. 

When a size specification is applied to an enumeration type, this enumeration 
type and all of its subtypes have the size specified by the length clause. The 
size specification must specify a value greater than or equal to the minimum 
Size of the type. Note that if the size specification specifies the minimum size 
and none of the internal codes are negative integers, the internal representation 
will be that of an unsigned type. Thus, when using a size specification of eight 
bits, you can have up to 256 elements in the enumeration type. 

If the enumeration type is used as a component type in an array or 
record definition tliar is further constrained by a pragma PACK or a record 
representation ciause. the size of this component will be determined by the 
practna PACK or the record representation clause. This allows the array or 
record type to temporarily override any size specification that may have 
applied to the enumeration type. 

The Ada compiler provides a complete implementation of size specifications. 
Nevertheless, because enumeration values are coded using integers, the specified 
length cannot be creator than 32 bits. 

F 4.1.4 Alignment of an Enumeration Type 

An enumeration typ» is by»• '-aliened if the size of 'he type is less than or equal 
to eight bits. An '’numeration type is aligned on a 2 byte boundary > 1 >> bit 
or half-word aligned* if the size of th«* type is in the range of 9. .16 bits. An 
enumeration typo i> aligned on a 4-byte boundary t 32 bit or word aligned i if 
the size of the type i? in the range of 17..32 bits. 


F 4. Type Representation 4-5 





F 4.2 Integer Types 


F 4.2.1 Predefined Integer Types 

The HP 9000 Series 600, 700, and 800 Computer Systems provides these three 
predefined integer types: 

type SHORT.SHORT.INTEGER 

is range -(2**7) .. (2**7)-l; — 8-bit signed 

type SHORT.INTEGER 

is range -(2**1S) .. (2**1S)-1; — 16-bit signed 

type INTEGER 

is range -(2**31) .. (2**3l)-l; — 32-bit signed 

An integer type declared by a declaration of the form 
type T is range L .. U; 

is implicitly derived from a predefined integer type. The compiler 
automatically selects the smallest predefined integer type whose range contains 
the values L to U, inclusive. 


F 4.2.2 Internal Codes of Integer Values 

The internal codes for integer values are represented using the two’s 
complement binary method. The compiler does not represent integer values 
using any kind of a bias representation. Thus, one internal code will always 
represent the same literal value for any Ada integer type. 


4-6 F 4. Type Representation 







F 4.2.3 Minimum Size of an integer Type or Subtype 

The minimum size of an integer subtype is the minimum number of bits 
necessary for representing the internal codes of the subtype. 

A static subtype of a null range has a minimum size of one. Otherwise, define m 
and M to be the smallest and largest values for the internal codes values of the 
subtype. 

The minimum size L is determined as follows: 


Value of m

m < 0 

~2 l ~ x < m and . 1 / < 2 1 " 1 - 1 

Signed two’s complement 


F 4. Type Representation 4-7 




Example 


type MY.INT is range 0 .. 31; 

— The minimum size of MY.INT is 5 bits using 

— an unsigned representation 

subtype SQME.INT is MY.INT range S .. 7; 

-- The minimum size of SOME.INT is 3 bits. 

— The internal representation of 7 requires three 

— binary bits using an unsigned representation. 

subtype DYNAMIC.INT is MY.INT range L .. U; 

-- Assuming that L and U are dynamic, 

—(i.e. not known at compile time) 

-- The minimum size of DYNAMIC.INT is the same as its base type, 
-- MY.INT. which is 5 bits. 

type ALT.INT is range -1 .. 16; 

-- The minimum size of MY.INT is 6 bits, 

-- because using a S-bit signed integer we 

— can only represent numbers in the range -16 .. 15 

— and using a 6-bit signed integer we 

— can represent numbers in the range -32 .. 31 
-- Since we must represent 16 as well as -1 the 

— compiler must choose a 6-bit signed representation 


4-8 F 4. Type Representation 





F 4.2.4 Size of an Integer Type 

The sizes of the predefined integer types SHORT.SHORT.INTEGER, 
SHORT.INTEGER and INTEGER are 8, 16, and 32 bits, respectively. 

When no size specification is applied to an integer type, the default size is that 
of the predefined integer type from which it derives, directly or indirectly. 

Example 

type S is range 80 .. 100; 

— Type S is derived from SHORT.SHORT.INTEGER 

— its default size is 8 bits. 

type N is range 0 .. 2SS; 

— Type M is derived from SHORT.INTEGER 

its default size is 16 bits. 

type Z is new M range 80 .. 100; 

-- Type Z is indirectly derived from SHORT.INTEGER 
its default size is 16 bits. 

type L is range 0 .. 99999; 

Type L is derived from INTEGER 
its default size is 32 bits. 

type UNSIGNED.BYTE is range 0 .. (2**8)-l; 
for UNSIGNED.BYTE’SIZE use 8; 

-- Type UNSIGNED.BYTE is derived from SHORT.INTEGER 
its actual size is 8 bits. 

type UNSIGNED.HALFWORD is range C .. (2**16)-1; 
for UNSIGNED.HALFWORD'SIZE use 16; 

-- Type UNSIGNED.HALFWORD is derived from INTEGER 
its actual size :s 16 bits. 



F 4. Type Representation 4-9 






When a size specification is applied to an integer type, this integer type 
and all of its subtypes have the size specified by the length clause. The size 
specification must specify a value greater than or equal to the minimum size 
of the type. If the size specification specifies the minimum size and the lower 
bound of the range is not negative, the internal representation will be unsigned. 
Thus, when using a size specification of eight bits, you can represent an integer 
range from 0 to 255. 

Using a size specification on an integer type allows you to define unsigned 
machine integer types. The compiler fully supports unsigned machine integer 
types that are either 8 or 16 bits. The 8-bit unsigned machine integer type 
is derived from the 16-bit predefined type SHORT.INTEGER. Using the S-bit 
unsigned integer type in an expression results in it being converted to the 
predefined 16-bit signed type for use in the expression. This same method also 
applies to the 16-bit unsigned machine integer type, such that using the type in 
an expression results in a conversion to the predefined 32-bit signed type. 

However. Ada does not allow the definition of an unsigned integer type that 
has a greater range than the largest predefined integer type. INTEGER is the 
largest predefined integer type and is represented as a 32-bit signed machine 
integer. Because the Ada language requires predefined integer types to be 
symmetric about zero (Ada RM , section 3.5.4), it is not possible to define a 
32-bit unsigned machine integer type because the largest predefined integer 
type. INTEGER, is also a 32-bit type. 

If the integer type is used as a component type in an array or record definition 
that is further constrained by a pragma PACK or record representation clause, 
the si.’e of this component will be determined by the pragma PACK or record 
representation clause. This allows the array or record type to temporarily 
override any size specification that may have applied to the integer type. 

The Ada compiler provides a complete implementation of size specifications. 
Nevertheless, because integers are coded using machine integers, the specified 
length cannot be greater than 32 bits. 


4-10 F 4. Type Representation 






F 4.2.5 Alignment of an Integer Type 

An integer type is byte-aligned if the size of the type is less than or equal to 
eight bits. An integer type is aligned on a 2-bvte boundary (16 bit or half-word 
aligned) if the size of the type is in the range of 9.. 16 bits. An integer type is 
aligned on a 4-bvte boundary (32 bit or word aligned) if the size of the type is 
in the range of 17..32 bits. 


F 4.2.6 Performance of an Integer Type 

The type INTEGER is the most efficient of the integer types in Ada/800 because 
the hardware can access these integers and perform overflow checks on them 
with no additional cost. For the smaller integer types (SHORT.INTEGER and 
SHORT.SHORT.INTEGER), the compiler must emit additional instructions for 
access and overflow checking that increase both the execution lime and the size 
of the generated code.

F 4.3 Floating Point Types 


F 4.3.1 Predefined Floating Point Types 

The HP 9000 Series 600/700/800 Computer Systems provides two predefined 
floating point types. 

type FLOAT is digits 6 range 

-(2.0 - 2.0**(-23))*(2.0*»127) .. 

♦(2.0 - 2.0**(-23))*(2.0**127); 

— This expresses the decimal range -3.40282E+38 .. 3.40282E+38 

type L0NG.FL0AT is digits 15 range 

-(2-0 - 2.0**(-S2))*(2.0**1023) .. 

♦(2.0 - 2.0**(-S2))*(2.0**1023); 

-- This expresses the decimal range: 

-- -1.797693134862315E+308 .. +1.7976931348623l5E*308 

A floating point type declared by a declaration of the form 

type T is digits D [range L .. U]; 

is implicitly derived from a predefined floating point type. The compiler 
automatically selects the smaller of the two predefined floating point types. 
FLOAT or LQNG_FL0AT. whose number of digits is greater than or equal to D and 
that contains the values L to U inclusive. 


F 4.3.2 Internal Codes of Floating Point Values 

The internal codes for floating point values are represented using the IEEE 
standard formats for single precision and double precision floats. 

The values of the predefined type FLOAT are represented using the single 
precision float format. The value? of the predefined type LONG.FLOAT are 
represented using the double precision float format. The values of any other 
floating point type are represented in the same way as the values of the 
predefined type from which it derives, directly or indirectly.

F 4.3.3 Minimum Size of a Floating Point Type or Subtype 

The minimum size of a floating point subtype is 32 bits if its base type is 
FLOAT or a type derived from FLOAT; it is 64 bits if its base type is LONG.FLOAT 
or a type derived from LONG.FLOAT. 


F 4.3.4 Size of a Floating Point Type 

The only size that can be specified for a floating point type in a size 
specification is its default size (32 or 64 bits). 


F 4.3.5 Alignment of a Floating Point Type

F 4.4 Fixed Point Types 


F 4.4.1 Predefined Fixed Point Types 

To implement fixed point types, the HP 9000 Series 600, 700, and 800 
Computer System provides a set of three anonymous predefined fixed point 
types of this form: 

type SHORT.FIXED is delta D range 

- (2**7)*SMALL .. *( (2**7)-1)*SMALL; 
for SH0RT.FIXED’SMALL use SMALL; 
for SHORT.FIXED’SIZE use 8; 

type FIXED is delta D range 

-(2**15)*SMALL .. ♦((2**15)-1)*SMALL; 
for FIXED’SMALL use SMALL; 
for FIXED’SIZE use 16; 

type L0NG.FIXED is delta D range 

-(2**3l)*SMALL .. ♦((2**31)-1)»SMALL; 
for LONG.FIXED'SMALL use SMALL; 
for LONG.FIXED'SIZE use 32; 

-- In the above type definitions SMALL is the largest 
-- power of two that is less than or equal to D. 


A fixed point type declared by a declaration of the form 
type T is delta D range L .. U; 
is implicitly derived from one of the predefined fixed point types. 


4-IP 


F 4, Type Representation 






The compiler automatically selects the smallest predefined fixed point type 
using the following method: 

■ Choose the largest power of two that is not greater than the value specified 
for the delta to use as SMALL. 

■ Determine the ranges for the three predefined fixed point types using the 
value obtained for SMALL. 

■ Select the smallest predefined fixed point type whose range contains the 
values L+SMALL to U-SMALL, inclusive. 

I'sing the above method, it is possible that the values L and U lie outside the 
range of the compiler-selected fixed point type. For this reason, the values used 
in a fixed point range constraint should be expressed as follows, to guarantee 
that the values of L and U are representable in the resulting fixed point type: 

type ANY_FIXED is delta D range L-D .. U+D; 

-- The values of L and U are guaranteed to be 
-- representable in the type ANY_FIXED. 


F 4.4.2 Internal Codes of Fixed Point Values 

The internal codes for fixed point values are represented using the two's 
complement binary method as integer multiples of ’SMALL. The value of a fixed 
point object is ’SMALL multiplied by the stored internal code. 


F 4.4.3 Small of a Fixed Point Type 

The Ada compiler requires that the value assigned to ’SMALL i> always a power 
of two. Ada does not support a length clause that specifies a ’SMALL for a fixed 
point type that is not a power of two. 

If a fixed point type doe; not have a lenctii ciativ that specifies tie value to 
>!><• for ’SMALL, the value of ’SMALL is determined by the compiler according to 
the rules in th'- Ada /?’«/. section 3.5.9. 


F 4. Type Representation 4-17 





F 4.4.4 Minimum Size of a Fixed Point Type or Subtype 

The minimum size of a fixed point subtype is the minimum number of binary 
digits necessary to represent the values in the range of the subtype using the

A static subtype of a null range has a minimum size of one. Otherwise, define 
s and S to be the bounds of the subtype, define m and M to be the smallest

F 4.4.5 Size of a Fixed Point Type 

The sizes of the anonymous predefined fixed point types SHORT.FIXED, FIXED, 
and LONG.FIXED are 8, 16, and 32 bits, respectively. 

When no size specification is applied to a fixed point type, the default size 
is that of the predefined fixed point type from which it derives, directly or 
indirectly. 

Example 

type Q is delta 0.01 range 0.00 .. 1.00; 

-- Type Q is derived from an 8-bit predefined 
-- fixed point type, its default size is 8 bits. 

type R is delta 0.01 range 0.00 .. 2.00; 

-- Type R is derived from a 16-bit predefined 
-- fixed point type, its default size is 16 bits. 

type S is nee R range 0.00 .. 1.00; 

-- Type S is indirectly derived from a 16-bit predefined 
-- fixed point type, its default size is 16 bits. 

type SF is delta 16.0 range -400.0 .. 400.0; 
for SF’SIZE use 6; 

— Type SF is derived from an 8-bit predefined 

— fixed point type, its actual size is 6 bits. 

type UF is delta 0.1 range 0.0 .. 100.0; 
for UF’SIZE use 11; 

— Type UF is derived from a 16-bit predefined 
-- fixed point type, its actual size is 11 bits. 

-- The value used for ’SMALL is 0.0625 


4-20 F 4. Type Representation 




When a size specification is applied to a fixed point type, this fixed point type 
and all of its subtypes have the size specified by the length clause. The size 
specification must specify a value greater than or equal to the minimum size 
of the type. If the size specification specifies the minimum size and the lower 
bound of the range is not negative, the internal representation will be that of 
an unsigned type. 

If the fixed point type is used as a component type in an array or 
record definition that is further constrained bv a pragma PACK or record 
representation clause, the size of this component will be determined by the 
pragma PACK or record representation clause. This allows the array or record 
type to temporarily override any size specification that may have applied to the 
fixed point type. 

The Ada compiler provides a complete implementation of size specifications. 
Nevertheless, because fixed point objects are coded using machine integers, the 
specified length cannot be greater than 32 bits. 


F 4.4.6 Alignment of a Fixed Point Type 

A fixed point type is byte-aligned if the size of the type is less than or equal 
to eight bits. A fixed point type is aligned on a 2-byte boundary (10 bit or 
half-word aligned) if the size of the type is in the range of 9..16 bits. A fixed 
point type is aligned on a 4-byte boundary i 32 bit or word aligned i if the size 
of the type is in the range of 17..32 bits.

F 4.5 Access Types 


F 4.5.1 Internal Codes of Access Values 

In the program generated by the compiler, access values are represented 
using 32-bit machine addresses. The predefined generic function 
UNCHECKED.CONVERSION can be used to convert the internal representation 
of an access value into any other 32-bit type. You can also use 
UNCHECKED ..CONVERSION to assign any 32-bit value into an access value. When 
interfacing with externally supplied data structures, it may be necessary to use 
the generic function UNCHECKED.CONVERSION to convert a value of the type 
SYSTEM. ADDRESS into the internal representation of an access value. Programs 
that use UNCHECKED.CONVERSION in this manner cannot be considered portable 
across different implementations of Ada. 


F 4.5.2 Collection Size for Access Types 

A length clause that specifies the collection size is allowed for an access type. 
This collection size applies to all objects of this type and any type derived 
from this type, as well as any and all subtypes of these types. Thus, a length 
clause that specifies the collection size is only allowed for the original base type 
definition and not for any subtype or derived type of the base type. 

When no specification of collection size applies to an access type, the attribute 
STORACE.SIZE returns zero. In this case, the compiler will dynamically manage 
the storage for the access type and it is not possible to determine directly the 
amount of storage available in the collection for the access type. 


4>22 F 4. Type Representation 






The recommended format of a collection size length clause is: 

U_NUM: constant :* 50; -- The maximum number 

of elements needed 

U_SIZE: constant := <Usize>; -- Substitute the value 

— of U’SIZE here 


— The constant U.SIZE should also be: 

1. a multiple of two 
— 2. greater than or equal to four 

-- Additionally, the type U must have a static size 

type P is access U; — Type U is any 

non-dynamic user defined type, 
for P’STORAGE.SIZE use (U_SIZE*U_NUM)*4; 

In ilie above example we have specified a collection size that is large enough to 
contain 50 objects of the type U. There is a constant overhead of four bytes for 
each storage collection. Because the collection manager rounds the element size 
to be a multiple of two that is four or greater, you must ensure that U_SIZE 
is the smallest multiple of two that is greater than or equal to U’SIZE and is 
greater than or equal to four. 

You can al.-,o provide a length clau'O that specifies the collection size for a type 
that has a dynamic size. It is only possible to specify an upper limit on the 
amount of memory that can be used by all instances of objects that are of this 
dynamic type. Because the size is dynamic, you cannot specify tiie number of 
elements in the collection.

F 4.5.3 Minimum Size of an Access Type or Subtype 

The minimum size of an access type is always 32 bits. 

F 4.5.4 Size of an Access Type 

The size of an access type is 32 bits, the same as its minimum size. 

The only size that can be specified for an access type in a size specification 
clause is its usual size (32 bits).

An access type is aligned on a -1-byte boundary (32 bit or word-aligned).

F 4.6 Task Types 


F 4.6.1 Internal Codes of Task Values 

In the program generated by the compiler, task type objects are represented 
using 32-bit machine addresses. 


F 4.6.2 Storage for a Task Activation 

The value returned by the attribute ’STORAGE.SIZE has three cases. 

a For a task type without a length clause and using the default storage size at 
bind time, the attribute ’STORAGE.SIZE returns the default task storage size. 

a For a task type without a length clause and using the bind-time option -W 
b.-t.nnn to set the task storage size, the attribute ’STORAGE.SIZE returns 
nnn*1024. 

a For a task type with a length clause, the attribute ’STORAGE.SIZE returns 
the value used in the length clause. 

When a length clause is used on a task type it specifies the number of storage 
units reserved for an activation of a task of this type (Ada RM 13.2 (10)). 

This space includes both the task stack space and a private data section of 
approximately 5400 bytes. The private data section contains the Task Control 
Block which has information used by the Ada runtime to manage the task. 

The size specified in the length clause must be greater than this minimum 
size, otherwise a TASKING-ERROR exception will be generated during the 
elaboration of the activation of a task object of this type. The stack space 
requirements for the task object must also be considered. If the stack space is 
insufficient during the execution of the task, the exception STORAGE-ERROR 
will he rai'cd and the task object will be terminated. 


F 4. Type Representation 4-25 





An example that sets the storage usage for a task type that needs 4K bytes of 
stack space: 

task type MY.TASK.TYPE is 
entry START; 
entry STOP; 
end MY.TASK.TYPE; 

for MY.TASK.TYPE’STORAGE.SIZE use 5400 + (4 * 1024); 

-- Allocates a 4K stack. 


F 4.6.3 Minimum Size of a Task Stack 

The task object will use S00 bytes of stack space in the first stack frame. Some 
additional stack space is required to make calls into the Ada runtime. The 
smallest value that can be safely used for a task with minimal stack needs is 
approximately 2000 bytes. If the task object has local variables or if it makes 
calls to other subprograms, the stack storage requirements will be larger. The 
actual amount of stack space used by a task will need to be determined by trial 
and error. If a tasking program raises ST0RAGE.ERR0R or behaves abnormally, 
you should increase the stack space for the tasks. 


F 4.6.4 Limitation on Length Clause for Derived Task Types 

If a task type has a storage size length clause, the storage size applies to all 
task objects of this type and any task type derived from this type. Thus, a 
length clause that specifies the storage size is only allowed for the original task 
type definition and not for any derived task type.

F 4.6.5 Minimum Si 2 e of a Task Type or Subtype

F 4.6.6 Size of a Task Type 

The size of a task type is 32 bits, the same as its minimum size. 

The only size that can be specified for a task type in a size specification clause 
is its usual size (32 bits). 


F 4.6.7 Alignment of a Task Type 

A task type is aligned on a 4-byte boundary (32 bit or word aligned).

F 4.7 Array Types 


F 4.7.1 Layout of an Array 

Each array is allocated in a contiguous area of storage units. All the 
components have the same size. A gap may exist between two consecutive 
components (and after the last component). All the gaps are the same size, as 
shown in Figure 4-1.

Figure 4-1. Layout of an Array 


F 4.7.2 Array Component Size and Pragma PACK 

If the array is not packed, the size of each component is the size of the 
component type. This size is the default size of the component type unless a 
size specification applies to the component type. 

If the array is packed and the array component type is neither a record nor 
array type, the size of the component is the minimum size of the component 
typo. The minimum size of the component type is used even if a size 
specification applies to the component type. 


4-28 F 4. Type Representation 


V 








Packing the array has no effect on the size of the components when the 
component type is a record or array type. 


Example 

type A is array(1..8) of BOOLEAN; 

— The component size of A is the default size 
— of the type BOOLEAN: 8 bits. 

type B is array(1..8) of BOOLEAN; 
pragma PACK(B); 

-- The component size of B is the minimum size 
-- of the type BOOLEAN: 1 bit. 

type DECIMAL.DIGIT is range 0..9; 

-- The default size for DECIMAL.DIGIT is 8 bits 
-- The minimum size for DECIMAL.DIGIT is 4 bits 

type BCD.NOT.PACKED is array(1..8) of DECIMAL.DIGIT; 

-- The component size of BCD.NOT PACKED is the default 
-- size of the type DECIMAL.DIGiT: 8 bits. 

type BCD.PACKED is array Cl..8) of DECIMAL.DIGIT; 
pragma PACKCBCD.PACKED); 

-- The component size of BCD.PACKED is the minimum 
-- size of the type DECIMAL.DIGIT: 4 bits. 


F 4.7.3 Array Gap Size and Pragma PACK 

If the array type is not packed and the component type is a record type 
without a size specification clause, the compiler may choose a representation 
for the arra\ with a gap after each component. Inserting gaps optimize^ acces; 
to the array components. The siz'- of the gap is chosen so that each arra> 
component begins on an alignment boundary. 

If the array type is packed, the compiler will generally not insert a gap between 
the array components. In such ca<=es. access to array components can be slower 


F 4. Type Representation 4-29 




because the array components will not always be aligned correctly. However, 
in the specific case where the component type is a record and the record has 
a record representation clause specifying an alignment, the alignment will be 
honored and gaps may be inserted in the packed array type. 

Example 

type R is 
record 

K : INTEGER; -- Type Integer is word aligned. 

B : BOOLEAN; -- Type Boolean is byte aligned, 

end record; 

— Record type R is word aligned. Its size is 40 bits, 
type A is array(l-.lO) of R; 

— A gap of three bytes is inserted after each array 

— component in order to respect the alignment of type R. 

-- The size of array type A is 640 bits. 

type PA is arrayCl.-lO) of R; 
pragma PACK CPA); 

— There are no gaps in an array of type PA because 

— of the pragma PACK statement on type PA. 

-- The size of array type PA is 400 bits. 

type NR is new R; 
for NR’SIZE use 40; 

type B is array(1..10) of NR; 

-- There are no gaps in an array of type B because 
-- of the size specification clause on type NR. 

-- The size of array type B is 400 bits. 


4-30 F 4. Type Representation 




F 4.7.4 Size of an Array Type or Subtype 

The size of an array subtype is obtained by multiplying the number of its 
components by the sum of the size of the component and the size of the gap. 

The size of an array type or subtype cannot be computed at compile time if 
any of the following are true: 

■ If the array has non-static constraints or if it is an unconstrained type with 
non-static index subtypes (because the number of components can then only 
be determined at run time) 

■ If the components are records or arrays and their constraints or the 
constraints of their subcomponents are not static (because the size of the 
components and the size of the gaps can then only be determined at run 
time). Pragma PACK is not allowed in this case. 

As indicated above, the eflect of a pragma PACK on an array type is to 
suppress the gaps and to reduce the size of the components, if possible. The 
consequence of packing an array type is thus to reduce its size. 

Airay packing is fully implemented by the Ada compiler wit., this limitation: 
if the components of an array type are records or arrays and their constraints 
or the constraints of their subcomponents are not static, the compiler ignores 
any pragma PACK statement applied to the array type and issues a warning 
message. 

A size specification applied to an array type has no effect. The only size ilia: 
the compiler will accept in such a length clause is the usual size. Nevertheless, 
sucii a length clause can be used to verify that the layout of an array is as 
expected by the application. 


F 4. Type Representation 4-31 








F 4.7.5 Alignment of an Array Type 

If no pragma PACK applies to an array type and no size specification applies to 
the component type, the array type is aligned as the component type would 
have been. 

If a pragma PACK applies to an array type or if a size specification applies to 
the component type (so that there are no gaps), the alignment of the array 
type is as given in Table 4-2

F 4.8.1 Layout of a Record 

A record is allocated in a contiguous area of storage units. The size of a record 
depends on the size of its components and the size of any gaps between the 
components. The compiler may add additional components to the record. 

These components are called implicit components. 

The positions and sizes of the components of a record type object can be 
controlled using a record representation clause as described in the Ada RM. 
section 13.4. If the record contains compiler-generated implicit components, 
their position also can be controlled using the proper component clause. For 
more details, see section 'T 4.S.6 implicit Components' - , in the implementation 
for the HP 9000 Seri?' 000. 700. and 800 Computer Systems, there is no 
restriction on the position that can be specified for a component of a record. 

If the component is not a record or an array, its size can be any size from the 
minimum siz*- to the default size of its ba«e type. If the component is a record 
or an array, its size must be the size of its base type.

end record; 

In the above example, the record representation clause explicitly tells the 
compiler both the position and size for each of the record components. The 
optional alignment clause specifies a -1-byte alignment for this record. In this 
example every component has a corresponding component clause, although 
it is not required. If one is not supplied, the choice of the storage place for 
that component is left to the compiler. If component clauses are given for all 
components, including any implicit components, the record representation 
clause completely specifies the representation of the record type and will be 
obeyed exactly by the compiler. 


F 4.8.2 Bit Ordering in a Component Clause 

The HP Ada compiler for the HP 9000 Series SOO Computer System numbers 
the bits in a component clause starting from the most significant bit. Thu=. bit 
zero represents the most ?ignificant bit of an S-bit byte and bit seven represents 
the least significant bit of ihe byte. 


F 4. Type Representation 4-35 





F 4.8.3 Value used for SYSTsHM.STORAGE.UNIT 

The smaJlest directly addressable unit on the HP 9000 Series 600/700/800 
Computer Systems is the 8-bit byte. This is the value used for 
SYSTEM.ST0RAGE.UNIT that is implicitly used in a component clause. A 
component clause specifies an offset and a bit range. The offset in a component 
clause is measured in units of SYSTEM.STQRAGE.UNIT, which for the HP 9000 
Series 600/700/800 Computer Systems is an S-bit byte. 

The compiler determines the actual bit address for a record component by 
combining the byte offset with the bit range. There are several different 
ways to refer to the same bit address. In the following example, each of the 
component clauses refer to the same bit address.

F 4.8.4 Compiler-Chosen Record Layout 

If no component clause applies to a component of a record, its size is the size 
of the base type. Its location in the record layout is chosen by the compiler so 
as to optimize access to the component. That is, each component of a record 
follows the natural alignment of the component’s base type. Moreover, the 
compiler chooses the position of the components to reduce the number of gaps 
or holes in the record and additionally to reduce the size of the record. 

Decause of these optimizations, there is no connection between the order of 
the components in a record type declaration and the positions chosen by the 
compiler for the components in a record object. 


4-36 F 4. Type Representation 








F 4.8.5 Change in Representation 

It is possible to apply a record representation clause to a derived record type. 
This allows a record type to possibly have several alternative representations. 
Thus, the compiler fully supports the “Change in Representation” as described 
in the Ada RM , section 13.6. 


F 4.8.6 Implicit Components 

In some circumstances, access to a record object or to a component of a 
record object involves computing information that only depends on the 
discriminant values or on a value that is known only at run time. To avoid 
unnecessary recomputation, the compiler reserves space in the record to store 
this information. The compiler will update this information whenever a 
discriminant on which it depends changes. The compiler uses this information 
whenever the component that depends on this information is accessed. This 
information is stored in special components called implicit components. There 
are three different kinds of implicit components: 

■ Components that contain an offset value. 

• Components that contain information about the record object. 

■ Components that are descriptors. 


F 4. Type Representation 4-37 




Implicit components that contain an offset value from the beginning of the 
record are used to access indirect components. Implicit components of this 
kind are called offset components. The compiler introduces implicit offset 
components whenever a record contains indirect components. These implicit 
components are considered to be declared before any variant part in the record 
type definition. Implicit components of this kind cannot be suppressed by 
using the pragma IMPROVE. 

Implicit components that contain information about the record object are used 
when the record object or component of a record object is accessed. Implicit 
components of this kind are used to make references to the record object 
or to make record components more efficient. These implicit components 
are considered to be declared before any variant part in the record type 
definition. There are two implicit components of this kind: REC0RD.SI2E and 
VARIANT.INDEX. Implicit components of this kind can be suppressed by using 
the pragma IMPROVE. 

The third kind of implicit components are descriptors that are used when 
accessing a record component. The implicit component exists whenever the 
record has an array or record component that depends on a discriminant of 
the record. An implicit component of this kind is considered to be declared 
immediately before the record component it is associated with. There are two 
implicit components of this kind: ARRAY.DESCRIPTOR and RECORD.DESCRIPTOR. 
Implicit components of this kind cannot be suppre c sed by using the pragma 
IMPROVE. 


Note The -S option (Assembly Option) to the ada(l) command is 

useful for finding out what implicit components are associated 
with the record type. This option will detail the exact 
representation for all record types defined in a compilation unit. 


4-38 


F 4. Type Representation 








F 4.8.7 indirect Components 

If the offset of a component cannot be computed at compile time, the compiler 
will reserve space in the record for the computed offset. The compiler computes 
the value to be stored in this offset at run time. A component that depends on 
a run time computed offset is said to be an indirect component, while other 
components are said to be direct. 

A pictorial example of a record layout with an indirect component is shown in 
Figure 4-2. 



Figure 4*2. Record layout with an Indirect Component 

In the above example, the component D has an offset that cannot be computed 
at compile time. The compiler then will reserve space in the record to store the 
computed offset and will store this offset at run time. The other components 
(A. E. and C) are all direct components because their offsets can ail ho 
computed at compile time. 


F 4. Type Representation 4-39 






F 4.8.8 Dynamic Components 

If a record component is a record or an array, the size of the component may 
need to be computed at run time and may depend on the discriminants of the 
record. These components are called dynamic components. 


Example (Record with dynamic components): 
type U_RNG is range 0..255; 

type UC.ARRAY is arrayCU.RNG range <>) of INTEGER; 

— The type GRAPH has two dynamic components: X and Y. 

type GRAPH (X.LEN, Y.LEN: U.RNG) is 
record 

X : UC_ARRAY(1 .. X.LEN); 

— The size of X depends on X.LEN 
Y : UC.ARRAYCl .. Y.LEN); 

-- The size of Y depends on Y.LEN

Any component that is placed after a dynamic component has an offset 
that cannot be evaluated at compile time and is thus indirect. To minimize 
the number of indirect components, the compiler groups the dynamic 
components and places them at the end of the record. Due to this strategy, 
the only indirect components are dynamic components. However, all dynamic 
components are not necessarily indirect. The compiler can usually compute the 
offset of the first dynamic component and thus it becomes a direct component. 
Any additional dynamic components arc then indirect components.

F 4.8.9 Representation of the Offset of an Indirect Component 

The offset of an indirect component is always expressed in storage units, which 
for the HP 9000 Series 600, 700, and 800 Computer System are bytes. The 
space that the compiler reserves for the offset of an indirect component must 
be large enough to store the maximum potential offset. The compiler will 
choose the size of an offset component to be either an 8*, 16-, or 32-bit object. 
It is possible to further reduce the size in bits of this component bv specifying 
it in a component clause. 

If C is the name of an indirect component, the offset of this component can 
be denoted in a component clause by the implementation-generated name 
C’OFFSET. 


Example (Record representation clause for the type GRAPH) 

for GRAPH use 
record 

X.LEN at 0 range 0..7; 

Y_LEN at 1 range 0..7; 

X 1 OFFSET at 2 range 0..15; 
end record; 

-- The bit range for the implicit component 
-- X’OFFSET could have been specified as 0..11 
-- This would make access to X much slower 

In this example we have used a component clause to specify the location of 
an offset for a dynamic component. In this example the compiler will choose 
Y to be the first dynamic component and as such it will have a static offset. 
The component X will be placed immediately after the end of component Y by 
the compiler at run time. At run time the compiler will store the offset of this 
location in the field X’OFFSET. Any references to X will have additional code to 
compute the run lime address of X using the X’OFFSET field. References to Y 
will be direct references

F 4.8.10 The implicit Component RECORD.SIZE 

This implicit component is created by the compiler whenever a record with 
discriminants has a variant part and the discriminant that defines the variant 
part has a default expression (that is, a record type that possibly could be 
unconstrained.) The component ’RECORD.SIZE contains the si 2 e of the storage 
space required to represent the current variant of the record object. Note that 
the actual storage allocated for the record object may be more than this. 

The value of a RECORD.SIZE component may denote a number of bits or a 
number of storage units (bytes). In most cases it denotes a number of storage 
units (bytes), but if any component clause specifies that a component of the 
record type has an offset or a size that cannot be expressed using storage units, 
the value designates a number of bits. 

The implicit component RECORD.SIZE must be large enough to store the 
maximum size that the record type can attain. The compiler evaluates this 
size, calls it MS, and considers tiie type of RECORD.SIZE to be an anonymous 
integer type whose range is 0 . . MS. 

If R is the name of a record type, this implicit component can be denoted in a 
component clause by the implementation-generated name R’RECORD.SIZE. 


F 4.8.11 The Implicit Component VARIANT.INDEX 

This implicit component is created by the compiler whenever the record type 
has a variant part. It indicates the set of components that are present in a 
record object. It is used when a discriminant check is to be done. 

Within a variant part of a record type, the compiler numbers component lists 
that themselves do not contain a variant part. These numbers are the possible 
values for the implicit component VARIANT.INDEX. The compiler uses this 
number to determine which components of the variant record are currently 
valid. 


4-44 F 4. Type Representation 










Example (Record with a variant part): 

type VEHICLE is (AIRCRAFT, ROCKET, BOAT. CAR,; 

type DESCRIPTION( KIND : VEHICLE := CAR) is 
record 

SPEED : INTEGER; 
case KIND is 

when AIRCRAFT 1 CAR => 

WHEELS : INTEGER; 
case KIND is 

when AIRCRAFT => — VARIANT.INDEX is 1 

WINGSPAN : INTEGER; 

when others => -- VARIANT.INDEX is 2 

null; 
end case; 

when BOAT => -- VARIANT.INDEX is 3 

STEAM : BOOLEAN; 

when ROCKET => — VARIANT.INDEX is 4 

STAGES : INTEGER; 
end case; 
end record; 

In the above example, the value of the variant index indicates which of the 
components are present in the record object; these components are summarized 
in the table below .

F 4. Type Representation 4-45 











The implicit component VARIANT.INDEX must be large enough to store the 
number of component lists that do not contain %’ariant parts. The compiler 
evaluates this size, calls it VS, and considers the type of VARIANT.INDEX to be 
an anonymous integer type whose range is 0 .. VS. 

If R is the name of a record type, this implicit component can be denoted in a 
component clause by the implementation-generated name R’VARIANT.INDEX. 


F 4.8.12 The Implicit Component ARRAY.DESCRIPTOR 

An implicit component of this kind is associated by the compiler with each 
record component whose type is an array that has bounds that depend on a 
discriminant of the record. 

The structure and contents of the implicit component ARRAY.DESCRIPTOR are 
not described in this manual. Nevertheless, if you are interested in specifying 
the location of a component of this kind in a component clause, you can obtain 
the size of the component by supplying the -S option (Assembly Option) to the 
ada(l) command. 

If C is the name of a record component that conforms to the above definition, 
this implicit component can be denoted in a component clause by the 
implementation-generated name C'ARRAY.DESCRIPTOR. 


F 4.8.13 The Implicit Component RECORD.DESCRIPTOR 

An implicit component of this kind may be associated by the compiler when a 
record component is a record type that has components whose size depends on 
a discriminant of the outer record. 

The structure and content of the implicit component RECORD.DESCRIPTOR are 
not described in this manual. Nevertheless, if you are interested in specifying 
the location of a component of this kind in a component clause, you can obtain 
the size of the component by applying the -S option (Assembly Option) to the 
ada( 1) command. 


4-46 F 4. Type Representation 





If C is the name of a record component that conforms to the above definition, 
this implicit component can be denoted in a component clause by the 
implementation-generated name C ’ RECORD.DESCRIPTOR. 


F 4.8.14 Suppression of implicit Components 

Ada provides the capability of suppressing the implicit components 
RECORD.SIZE and VARIANT.INDEX from a record type. This can be done using 
an implementation defined pragma called IMPROVE. 


Syntax 

pragma IMPROVE ( TIME I SPACE , [ON =>] record„type~name ) ; 


The first argument specifies whether TIME or SPACE is the primary criterion for 
the choice of representation of the record type that is denoted by the second 
argument. 

If TIME is specified, the compiler inserts implicit components as described 
above. This is the default behavior of the compiler. If SPACE is specified, 
the compiler only inserts a VARIANT.INDEX component or a RECORD.SIZE 
component if a component clause for one of these components was supplied. 

If the record type has no record representation clause, both components will 
be suppressed. Thus, a record representation clause can be used to keep one 
implicit component while suppressing the other. 

A pragma IMPROVE that applies to a given record type can occur anywhere that 
a record representation clause is allowed for this type. 


F 4. Type Representation 4-47 




F 4.8.15 Size of a Record Type or Subtype 

The compiler generally will round up the size of a record type to a whole 
number of storage units (bytes). If the record type has a component clause 
that specifies a record component that cannot be expressed in storage units, 
the compiler will not round up and instead the record size will be expressed as 
an exact number of bits. 

The size of a constrained record type is obtained by adding the sizes of its 
components and the sizes of its gaps (if any). The size of a constrained record 
will not be computed at compile time if: 

■ The record type has non-static constraints. 

■ A component is an array or record and its size cannot be computed at 
compile time (that is, if the component has non-static constraints.) 

The size of an unconstrained record type is the largest possible size that 
the unconstrained record type could assume, given the constraints of the 
discriminant or discriminants. If the size of any component cannot be 
evaluated exactly at compile time, the compiler will use the maximum size that 
the component could possibly assume to compute the size of the unconstrained 
record type. 

A size specification applied to a record type has no effect. The only size that 
the compiler will accept in such a length clause is the usual size. Nevertheless, 
such a length clause can be used to verify that the layout of a record is as 
expected by the application.

F 4. Type Representation 








F 4.8.16 Size of an Object of a Record Type 

A record object of a constrained record type has the same size as its base type. 

A record object of an unconstrained record type has the same size as its base 
type if this size is less than or equal to 24576 bytes. The size of the base type 
is the largest possible size that the unconstrained record type could assume, 
given the constraints of the discriminant(s). If the size of the base type is 
larger than 24576 bytes, the record object only has the size necessary to store 
its current value. Storage space is then allocated and deallocated dynamically 
based on the current value of the discriminant or discriminants. 


F 4.8.17 Alignment of a Record Subtype 

When a record type does not have a record representation clause, or when a 
record type has a record representation clause without an alignment clause, 
the record type is word-aligned to the maximum alignment required by any 
component of the record (8, 16. 32, or 64 bits). Any subtypes of a record type 
also have the same alignment as their base type. 

For a record type that has a record representation clause with an alignment 
clause, any subtypes of this record type also obey the alignment clause. 

An alignment clause can specify that a record type is byte, half-word. word, or 
double-word aligned fspecified as 1. 2, 4, or S bytes). Ada does not support 
alignments larger than an S-byte alignment.

F 4.9 Data Allocation 

This section explains how data objects are allocated by the HP Ada compiler 
for the HP 9000 Series 600, 700, and S00 Computer System. 

Data objects are al’ocated into: 

■ A stack frame. 

■ The global data area. 

■ The heap. 

or have no storage allocated to them. 

A stack frame is used for objects declared within a subprogram or task body, 
or within a declare block. The stack frame contains the data objects that are 
dynamic if each invocation of the subprogram or block creates a new data 
object. Each object allocated in a stack frame has a lifetime that begins after 
the elaboration of the subprogram or block enclosing the object and ends after 
the subprogram or the block is exited. 

The global data area is used for objects declared in library level packages, 
either in the specification or in the body. The global data area contains the 
data objects that are allocated in a static manner. Each object allocated in the 
global data area has a permanent lifetime. The global data area is allocated in 
the $DATA$ segment of the HP-UX object file (see a .cut_800(4)). 

The heap is used for objects that are created by an Ada allocator as well as 
objects created via indirect allocation. Storage for task objects, including the 
task stack, are also allocated into the heap. The heap contains the data objects 
that are dynamic in the broadest sense. Each object allocated in the heap has 
a lifetime that begins after the allocator operation and ends only when an 
implicit or explicit deallocator operation is performed. The heap is allocated 
using the sbrk(2) system call. 


4-50 F 4. Type Representation 






For constants that are scalar in type, no storage is allocated or used. The 
values are stored In a compile-time data structure. Because these scalar 
constants do not have an allocation address, it is illegal to refer to their address 
(using the attribute ’ADDRESS) or to supply an address for them (using an 
address clause.) Constants that are aggregates or non-scaiar are allocated into 
one of the above three locations. 

Objects that are created by the compiler, such as temporaries, also obey the 
above rules. 


F 4. Type Representation 4-51 





F 4.9.1 Direct Allocation versus Indirect Allocation 


The HP Ada compiler determines whether to allocate each object directly in 
the frame or in the global data area, or to allocate it dynamically in the heap 
and access it indirectly via a pointer. These two modes are called direct and 
indirect, respectively. The determination is based on the object’s size or its 
maximum possible size. An allocation map will list the size of all objects and 
can be produced by using the -S assembly option. 

Note that objects of the unconstrained type STRING, including those returned 
by functions that return the type STRING, are allocated in the heap. 

F 4.9.2 Object Deallocation 

This section describes compiler-generated objects, programmer-generated 
objects, and program termination. 

F 4.9.2.1 Compiler-Generated Objects 

All objects that the compiler chooses to represent in an indirect form will 
automatically be freed and their storage reclaimed when leaving the scope in 
which th<- objects are declared. Moreover, all compiler-generated temporaries 
that are allocated on the heap in a scope will be deallocated upon leaving the 
scope. These compiler temporaries are often generated by such operations 
as function calls returning unconstrained arrays, or by using the STRING 
concatenation operator (4). By enclosing the statements in a begin ... end 
block, you can force the heap to reclaim the temporaries associated with any 
statement. 

The storage associated with a task object, including its stack space, is 
automatically freed when the task terminates. 


4-52 F 4. Type Representation 






F 4.9.2.2 Programmer-Generated Objects 

Whether the storage for an object created with an Ada allocator is reclaimed 
depends on where the access type is declared. 

For access types declared in a nested or non-library level scope, all objects 
created with an Ada allocator will automatically be freed and their storage 
reclaimed when leaving the scope in which the type was declared. Thus, 
pragma CONTROLLED is effectively applied to all access types by default. Upon 
exiting a scope that declares an access type, the lifetime of objects of this 
access type expires and the storage can be reclaimed safely. 

For access types declared in a library level scope or with library package 
visibility, objects that are created using a type declared in a library level 
package will not be freed by the Ada Runtime System. The compiler cannot 
determine the lifetime of the object and thus must assume that a future 
reference to the object could occur at any time. For these kinds of objects, it is 
the programmer's responsibility to reclaim their storage through the careful use 
of UNCHECKED.DEALLOCATION. 

F 4.9.2.3 Program Termination 

All memory used by a program, including code, global data. I/O buffers, and so 
on. is released when the program terminates and returns to HP-l'X. This is the 
standard behavior of any program under HP-UX. 


F 4. Type Representation 4-53 







F 4.9.3 Dynamic Memory Management 

This section explains how dynamic memory is managed by the Ada Runtime 
System. 

F 4.9.3.1 Collections of Objects 

Every access type has a corresponding collection of objects associated 
with it. Each use of an allocator queries the corresponding collection and 
then reserves the correct amount of space within the heap. Each use of 
UNCHECKED.DEALLOCATION updates the collection data structures and effectively 
gives back the space for future use. 

The size of the space taken from the heap depends on: 

■ The designated type. 

■ The access value type. 

• Possibly, for an unconstrained record access type, the supplied value of the 
discriminant or discriminants either when the object is created or again when 
a new value is given to the object. 

The effective size of the object can be obtained using the predefined attribute 
’SIZE. For an unconstrained array access type, a descriptor is added that holds 
tlie unconstrained actual dimension or dimensions with the actual size of the 
array; thus, the descriptor size is the sum of the size container (generally 4 
bytes) and all the actual constraints (array bounds) implemented the same way 
as their index type (either 1. 2. or 4 bytes each). 

The heap manager applies the following rules to each object: 

■ The size of the object is rounded up to an even number of bytes. 

■ The minimum size is 12 bytes. Thus, if the object is less than 12 bytes, it is 
increased to 12 bytes. 

■ To the above size, the following is added: a 5-byte descriptor if the collection 
is global (is declared within a library level package) or a 40-byte descriptor 

if the collection is in a nested scope (declared within a procedure or task 
body). 


4-54 F 4. Type Representation 





A special rule applies for collections where the objects of the designated type 
are of static size and are smaller than 64 bytes. Instead of allocating one 
object at a time within the heap, blocks of several objects are allocated. The 
size of the block is either 128 bytes or 16 times the object size plus 10 bytes, 
whichever is greater. To the size of this block, the heap manager applies the 
above rules; that is, the heap manager adds either a 8- or 40-bvte descriptor. 

When a collection size is specified using a length clause for an access type (that 
is, for T’STORAGE.SIZE use <nnn>), the heap manager allocates a single block 
of the specified size. The size of this block will be exactly the size specified in 
the length clause. Individual objects will then be allocated from this block. 

The minimum size of an individual object allocated from this block is four 
bytes. Whenever UNCHECKED .DEALLOCATION is performed on an object, the 
collection will add the object to the free list associated with the collection. 

This free list is maintained as a linked list of pointers contained directly within 
the collection. No additional storage is required to maintain the free list. When 
space in the collection is exhausted, the exception STORAGE.ERROR is raised. 

F 4.9.3.2 Global Dynamic Objects 

A global dynamic object is a user-declared object whose size is not known until 
execution time and is declared within a library package (in a specification or 
body including nested packages and blocks, but not subprograms or tasks .) 

The compiler also considers an object as dynamic if the size is bigger than 1024 
bytes, even if this size is known statically at compile time. The compiler also 
considers any object as static if the maximum size is smaller than 12S bytes, 
even if this size must be dynamically computed at execution time. 

All such global dynamic objects are allocated within the heap. The size of 
these objects can be obtained using the predefined attribute ’SIZE and the 
heap manager applies the same rules to them as it does for collections of 
objects, as described in section “F 4.9.3.1 Collections of Objects”. 


F 4. Type Representation 4-55 




F 4.9.3.3 Local Objects 

Local objects, declared within a subprogram or task, are normally allocated in 
the stack. This is done either in the frame associated with the subprogram or 
task execution, or dynamically on top of the stack at the time of elaboration of 
the object declaration when the size of the object is dynamic. 

The heap is used for an unconstrained record if the object discriminant 
or discriminants can be changed during the lifetime of the object. This 
discriminant change has a potentially large effect on the object size. In this 
case, the object is allocated in the heap, and when the discriminant changes, a 
new space of the desired size is allocated and the old space is given back to the 
heap. 

The heap manager applies the same rules for object size as described in 
“F 4.9.3.1 Collections of Objects". 

F 4.9.3.4 Temporary Objects 

During code execution, it is sometimes necessary to take some memory space 
from the heap to hold temporary object values. This only happens when the 
memory size is not known at compiler time, or memory size is big enough 
(more than 12S bytes) to be considered dynamic rather than static for this 
implementation. 

The following cases are possible: 

• Function results that are of a dynamic size. 

■ Evaluation of large aggregates. 

■ Operations on dynamic arrays (such as catenation of object of type STRING; 
also the predefined operators and. or, xor, and not used on dynamic Boolean 
arrays). 

■ Evaluation of the predefined attribute 'IMAGE. 


4-56 F 4. Type Representation 







I 


F 4.9.3.S Reclaiming Heap Storage 

Heap storage is reclaimed as follows: 

■ For the collection of an access type, ali storage allocated is returned 
upon exiting the scope in which access type was declared. Reclaiming 
occurs whether the exit is normal or abnormal (that is, due to exception 
propagation.) 

■ The storage of a task, (including its’ stack) is reclaimed when the task 
terminates. 

■ For an object passed to an instance of the generic procedure 
UNCHECKED.DEALLOCATION, the storage associated with the object is 
reclaimed immediately. 

■ For a temporary object, storage is returned no later than on exit from the 
scope (subprogram or block) that contained the allocation of the temporary 
object. 

For objects of an access type declared in a library package, automatic 
reclaiming is not performed. This would require automatic garbage 
collection with its" inherent overhead at runtime. You should perform 
UNCHECKED.DEALLOCATION to reclaim this storage. 

Reclaimed heap storage is managed internally by the Ada Runtime System. 
Such memory is ntver released back to HP-UX using the sbrk(l) system call. 
Reclaimed heap storage is available for the Ada Runtime System to reuse: 
however, to the HP-UX kernel, it appears that the memory is still in use by the 
Ada Runtime System.

F 6. Address Clauses 


This chapter describes the available address clauses. 


F 6.1 Objects 

An address clause can be used to specify an address for an object as described 
in the Ada R.\f, section 13.5. When such a clause applies to an object, no 
storage is allocated for it in the program generated by the compiler. Storage 
for the object must be allocated for the object outside of the Ada program unit 
unless the address is a memory mapped hardware address. The Ada program 
accesses the object by using the address specified in the address clause. 

An address clause is not allowed for unconstrained records whose maximum 
size can be greater than 24576 bytes. 

Note that the function SYSTEM. VALUE, defined in the package SYSTEM, is 
available to convert a STRING valve into a value of type SYSTEM. ADDRESS (see 
section "F 3.1 The Package SYSTEM" for details). Note that the IMPORT 
attribute is available to provide the address of an external symbol (see section 
”F 2.2 Attribute SYSTEM. AD DR ESS'I.M PORT" for details).

6*2 F 6. Address Clauses 









F 6.6 Data Objects 

An address clause can specify the address for an object as described in the 
Ada RM , section 13.5. The address supplied must be either an integer 
constant or the value returned by the implementation-defined attribute 
SYSTEM. ADDRESS’IMPORT. This attribute is defined to return a reference 
value that can be used as the address of an external static data object This 
attribute takes two parameters: the language and the name of the external 
data object. Both of these parameters are Ada strings. 

Example 

IMPORT.OBJ: INTEGER; 

for IMPORT.OBJ use at SYSTEM.ADDRESS’IMPORTC’c" , "c.obj"); 

MEMORY.MAPPED.OBJ: INTEGER; 

for MEMORY.MAPPED.OBJ use at 16#6FFF_0400#; 

See section U F 2.2 Attribute SYSTEM.ADDRESS’IMPORT" for more details. 


F 6.7 Task Entries 

An address clause can be supplied for an Ada task entry. The actual address of 
the Ada task entry is not bound to the value supplied by the address clause. 
Instead, this kind of address clause is used to provide the interrupt entry 
mechanism (see section "F 12. Interrupt Entries" for details).

F 7. Restrictions on Unchecked Type 
Conversions 

The following limitations apply to the use ofUNCHECKED_CONV£RSION: 

■ Unconstrained arrays are not allowed as target types. 

• Unconstrained record types without defaulted disciminants are not allowed as 
target types. 

■ Access types to unconstrained arrays or unconstrained strings are not allowed 
as source or target types. 

■ If the source and target types are each scalar types, the sizes of the types 
must be equal. 

■ If the source and target types are each access types, the sizes of the objects 
that the types denote must be equal. 

■ If the source or target type is a composite type, the sizes do not have to be 
equal. See the warning below for more details. 

If the source and target types are each of scalar or access types or if they are 

both of composite type with the same static size, the effect of the function is to 7 

return the operand. 

In other cases, the effect of unchecked conversion can be considered as a copy 
operation. 


F 7. Restrictions on Unchecked Type Conversions 7*1 








Caution 


7-2 F 


When you do an UNCHECKED.CONVERSION among types whose 
sizes do not match, the code that is generated copies as many 
bytes as necessary from the source location to fill the target. 

If the target is larger than the source, the code copies all of 
the source plus whatever follows the source. Therefore, an 
UNCHECKED.CONVERSION among types whose sizes do not match 
can produce meaningless results, or can actually cause a trap 
and abort the program (if these memory locations do not 
actually exist).

F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 


Characteristics 

This chapter describes the I/O characteristics of Ada on the HP 9000 Series 
600, 700, and 800 computers. Ada handles I/O with packages, which are 
discussed in section “F 8.1 Ada I/O Packages for Externa] Files”. File types 
are described in section M F 8.1.3 Standard Implementation of External Files” 
and the FORM parameter is discussed in section “F 8.2 The FORM Parameter 


F 8.1 Ada I/O Packages for External Files 

In Ada. I/O operations are considered to be performed on objects of a certain 
nie type rather than directly on external files. An external file is anything 
external to the program that can produce a value to be read or receive a value 
to be written. In Ada. values transferred to and from a given file must all be of 
the same type. 

Generally, the term file object refers to an Ada file of a certain file type, 
whereas a physical manifestation is known as an external file. An external file 
is characterized by: 

■ Its NAME, which is a string defining a legal pathname for an external file on 
the underlying operating system. HP-UX is the underlying operating system 
for Ada. The rules that govern legal pathnames for external files in Ada 
programs, are the same as those that govern legal pathnames in HP-UX. See 
section “F 8.1.2 Correspondence between External Files and HP-UX" for 
details. 

■ Its FORM, which allows you to supply implementation-dependent information 
about the external file characteristics. 


F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 8-1 





Both SAME and FORK appear explicitly in the Ada CREATE and OPEN procedures. 
These two procedures perform the association of the Ada file object and the 
corresponding external file. At the time of this association, a FORK parameter is 
permitted to specify additional characteristics about the external file. 

Ada I/O operations are provided by several predefined standard packages. See 
the Ada RM , Chapter 14 for more details. Table 8-1 describes the standard 
predefined Ada I/O packages.

F 8.1.2 Correspondence between External Files and HP-UX 

Files 

When Ada I/O operations are performed, data is read from and written to 
external files. Each external file is implemented as a standard HP-UX file. 
However, before an external file can be used by an Ada program, it must be 
associated with a file object belonging to that program. This association is 
achieved by supplying the name of the file object and the name of the externa! 
file to the procedures CREATE or OPEN of the predefined I/O packages. Onre the 
association has been made, the external file can be read from or written to with 
the file object. Note that for SEQUENTIAL.IO and DIRECT.IC. you must first 
instantiate the generic package to produce a non-generic instance. Then you 
can use the CREATE or OPEN procedure of that instance. The example at the 
end of this section illustrates this instantiation process. 

The name of the external file can be either of the following: 

■ an HP-UX pathname 

■ a null string (for CREATE only) 

The exception USE.ERROR is raised by the procedure CREATE if the specified 
external file cannot be created. The exception USE.ERROR i? also raised bv the 
procedure OPEN if ;.ou have insufficient access rights to the fiie 

If the name is a null string, the associated external fiie is a temporary file 
created using the HP-UX facility tmpnam(3). This external file will cease to 
exist upon completion of the program. 


F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 8-3 







When using OPEN or CREATE, the Ada exception NAME.ERROR is raised if any 
path component exceeds 255 characters or if an entire path exceeds 1023 
characters. This limit applies to path components and the entire path during 
or after the resolution of symbolic links and context-dependent files (CDFs). 


Caution The absence of NAME.ERROR does not guarantee that the 

path will be used as given. During and after the resolution 
of symbolic links and context-dependent files (CDFs). the 
underlying file system may truncate an excessively long 
component of the resulting pathname. For example, a fifteen 
character file name used in an Ada program OPEN or CREATE 
call will be silently truncated to fourteen characters without 
raising NAME.ERROR by an HP-UX file system that is configured 
for ‘‘short filenames”. 


If an existing external file is specified to the CREATE procedure, the contents 
of that file will be deleted. The recreated file is left open, as is the case for a 
newly created file, for later access by the program that made the call to create 
the file.

8-6 f 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 






Note 


The Ada development system manages files internally so 
that names involving symbolic links (see ln(l)) are mapped 
back to the actual rooted path. Consequently, when the Ada 
development system interacts with files involving symbolic 
links, the actual rooted pathname may be mentioned in 
informational or error messages rather than the symbolic name. 


F 8.1.3 Standard Implementation of External Files 

External files have a number of implementation-dependent characteristics, such 
as their physical organization and file access rights. It is possible to customize 
these characteristics through the FORM parameter of the CREATE and OPEN 
procedures, described fully in section “F S 2 The FORM Parameter". The 
default of FORM is the null string. 

The next three subsections describe the Ada implementation of these three 
types of external files: SEQUENTIAL. 10, DIRECT.IO, and TEXT.IO files. 


F 8.1.3.1 SEQUENTIAL. 10 Files 

A SEQUENTIAL.10 fi!' 5 is a sequence of elements that are transferred in the 
order of their appearance to or from an external file. Each element in the file 
contains one object of the type that SEQUENTIAL. 10 was instantiated on. All 
objects in the file are of this same type. An object stored in a SEQUENTIAL.IO 
file has exactly the same binary representation as an Ada object in the 
executable program. 

The information placed in a SEQUENTIAL.IO file depends on whether the type 
used in the instantiation is a constrained type or an unconstrained type. 

For a SEQUENTIAL.IO file instantiated with a constrained type, each element 
is simple the ob ject. The objects are stored’ consecutively in the file without 
separators. For constrained types, the number of bytes occupied by each 
element is the size of the constrained type and is the same for all elements. 
Files created using SEQUENTIAL.IO on con.-trained types cun be accessed as 


F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 8-7 





DIRECT.IO files at a later time. The representation of both SEQUENTIAL.IO and 
DIRECT. 10 files are the same when using constrained types. 

For a SEQUENTIAL.IO file instantiated with an unconstrained type, each 
element is composed of three parts: the size (in bytes) of the object is stored in 
the file as a 32-bit integer value, the object, and a few optional unused trailing 
bytes. These unused trailing bytes will only be appended if the FORM parameter 
RECORD.UNIT was specified in the CREATE call. This parameter instructs the 
Ada runtime to round up the size of each element in the file to be an integral 
multiple of the RECORD.UNIT size. The default value for RECORD.UNIT is one 
byte, which means that unused trailing bytes will not be appended. The 
principle use for the RECORD.UNIT parameter is in reading and writing external 
files that are in formats that already use this convention. Files created using 
SEQUENTIAL.IO on unconstrained types connot be accessed as DIRECT.IO files 
at a later time. The representation of SEQUENTIAL.IO and DIRECT.IO files are 
not the same when using an unconstrained type. See section “F 8.2.10.2 The 
Structure of DIRECT.IO and SEQUENTIAL.IO Files" for more information 
ou file structure. 

A SEQUENTIAL.IO file can be buffered. Buffering is selected by specifying a 
non-zero value for the FORM parameter, BUFFER.SI2E. The I/O performance 
of an Ada program will be considerably improved if buffering is used. By 
default, no buffering takes place between the physical external file and the 
Ada program. See section “F 8.2.4 The FORM Parameter Attribute - File 
Buffering" for details on specifying a file BUFFER.SIZE. 


F 8.1.3.2 DIRECT.IO Files 

A DIRECT.IO file is a set of elements each occupying consecutive positions in a 
linear order. DIRECT.IO files are sometimes referred to as random-access files 
because an object can be transferred to or from an element at any selected 
position in the file. The position of an element in a DIRECT.IO file is specified 
by its index, which is a number in the range 1 to (2**31 )-l of the subtype 
POSITIVE.COUNT. Each element in the file contains one object of the type 
that DIRECT.IO was instantiated on. All objects in the file are of this same 
type. The object stored in a DIRECT.IO file has exactly the same binary 
representation as the Ada object in the executable program. 


8-8 F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 






Elements within a DIRECT.10 file always have the same size. This requirement 
allows the Ada runtime to easily and quickly compute the location of any 
element in a DIRECT. 10 file. 

For a DIRECT.IO file instantiated with a constrained type, the number of bytes 
occupied by each element is the size of the constrained type. Files created 
using DIRECT.IO on constrained types can be accessed as SEQUENTIAL. 10 files 
at a later time. The representation of both DIRECT.IO and SEQUENTIAL. 10 files 
are the same when using a constrained type. 

For DIRECT.IO files instantiated with an unconstrained type, the number 
of bytes occupied by each element is determined by the FORM parameter, 
RECORD.SIZE. All of the unconstrained objects stored in the file must have an 
actual size that is less than or equal to this size. The exception DATA.ERROR 
is raised if the size of an unconstrained object is larger than this size. Files 
created using DIRECT.IO on unconstrained types cannot be accessed as 
SEQUENTIAL.IO files at a later time. The representation of DIRECT.IO and 
SEQUENTIAL. 10 files are not the same when using an unconstrained type. See 
section “F 8.2.10.2 The Structure of DIRECT.IO and SEQUENTIAL.IO 
Files’’ for more information on file structure. 

If the file is created with the default FORM parameter attributes (see section 
“F 8.2 The FORM Parameter”), only objects of a constrained type can 
be written to or read from a DIRECT.IO file. Although an instantiation of 
DIRECT.IO is accepted for unconstrained types, the exception USE.ERROR 
is raised on any call to CREATE or OPEN when the default value of the FORM 
parameter is used. You must specify the maximum RECORD.SIZE for the 
unconstrained type. 

A DIRECT.IO file can be buffered. Buffering is selected by specifying a non-zero 
value for the FORM parameter. BUFFER.SIZE. The I/O performance of an Ada 
program will normally be considerably improved if buffering is used. However, 
for a DIRECT.IO file that is accessed in a random fashion, performance can 
actually be degraded. The buffer will always reflect a contiguous set of 
elements in the file and if subsequent I/O requests lie outside of the current 
buffer, the entire buffer will be updated. This could cause performance 
to degrade if a large buffer is used and each I/O request requires that the 
buffer be updated. By default, no buffering takes place between the physical 
external file and the Ada program. See section "F 8.2.4 The FORM Parameter 
Attribute - Tile Buffering" for details on specifying a file BUFFER.SIZE. 


F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 8-9 









F 8.1.3.3 TEXT JO Files 


A TEXT.IO file is used for the input and output of information in readable 
form. Each TEXT.IO file is read or written sequentially as a sequence of 
characters grouped into lines and as a sequence of lines grouped into pages. All 
TEXT.IO column numbers, line numbers, and page numbers are in the range 1 
to (2**31)-1 of subtype POSITIVE.COUNT. The line terminator (end-of-line) 
is physically represented by the character ASCII.LF. The page terminator 
(end-of-page) is physically represented by a succession of the two characters, 
ASCII.LF and ASCII.FF, in that order. The file terminator (end-of-file) is 
physically represented by the character ASCII .LF and is followed by the 
physical end of file. There is no ASCII character that marks the end of a file. 
An exception to this rule occurs when reading from a terminal device. In 
this case, the EOF character defined by HP-UX is used by the Ada runtime 
to indicate the end-of-file (see stty(l) and teraioC?) for details.) See “F 
8.2.10.1 The Structure of TEXT.IO Files“in this section for more information 
about the structure of text files. 

If you leave the control of line, page, and file terminators to the Ada runtime 
and use only TEXT.IO subprograms to create and modify the text file, you 
need not be concerned with the above terminator implementation details. 
However, you must not output the characters ASCII.LF or ASCII .FF when 
using TEXT.IO.PUT operations because these characters would be interpreted 
as line terminators or as page terminators when the file was later read using 
TEXT.IO.GET. If you affect structural control by explicitly outputting these 
control characters, it is your responsibility to maintain the integrity of the 
external file. 

If vour text file was not created using TEXT.IO. your text file may not be in a 
format that can be interpreted correctly by TEXT.IO. It may be necessary to 
filter the file or perform other modifications to the text file before it can be 
correctly interpreted as an Ada text file. See section U F S.2.10.1 The Structure 
of TEXT.IO Files" for information on the structure of TEXT.IO files. 

The representation of a TEXT.IO file is a sequence of ASCII characters. It is 
possible to use DIRECT.IO or SEQUENTIAL.IQ to read <■-- write a TEXT.IO fi!<\ 
The Ada type CHARACTER must be used in the instantiation of DIRECT.IO or 
SEQUENTIAL.IO. It is not possible to use DIRECT.IO or SEQUENTIAL.10 on the 
Ada type STRING to read or write a TEXT.IO file. 


8'10 F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 







A TEXT.IO file can be buffered. Buffering is selected by specifying a non- 2 ero 
value for the FORM parameter, BUFFER.SIZE. The I/O performance of an Ada 
program will be considerably improved if buffering is used. By default, no 
buffering takes place between the physical external file and the Ada program. 
However, terminal input is line buffered by default. See sections “F S-2.4 
The FORM Parameter Attribute - File Buffering” and “F 8.2.8 The FORM 
Parameter - FIFO Control” for details. 


F 8.1.4 Default Access Protection of External Files 

HP-UX provides protection of a file by means of access rights. These access 
rights are used within Ada programs to protect external files. There are three 
levels of protection: 

■ User (the owner of the file). 

■ Group (users belonging to the owner’s group). 

■ Others (users belonging to other groups). 

For each of these levels, access to the file can be limited to one or several of 
the following rights: read, write, or execute. The default HP-UX external file 
access rights are specified by using the unask(l) command (see umask(l) and 
umask(2) in the HP-UX Reference.) Access rights apply equally to sequential, 
direct, and text files. See section “F 8.2.3 The FORM Parameter Attribute - 
File Protection” for information about specifying file permissions at the time of 
CREATE. 


F 8.1.5 System Level Sharing of External Files 

Under HP-UX, several programs or processes can access the same HP-UX file 
simultaneously. Each program or process can access the HP-UX file either for 
reading or for writing. Although HP-UX can provide file and record locking 
protection using fcntl(2) or lockf (2). Ada does not utilize this feature 
when it performs I/O on external files. Thus, the external file that Ada reads 
or writes is not protected from simultaneous access by non-Ada processes, or 
by another Ada program that is executing concurrently. Such protection is 


F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 8-11 








outside the scope of Ada. However, you can limit access to a file by specifying 
a file protection mask using the FORM parameter when you create the file. See 
section “F 8.2.3 The FORM Parameter Attribute - File Protection” for more 
information. 

The effects of sharing an external file depend on the nature of the file. You 
must consider the nature of the device attached to the file object and the 
sequence of 1/0 operations on the device. You also must consider the effects of 
file buffering if you are attempting to update a file that is being shared. 

For shared files on random access devices, such as disks, the data is shared. 
Reading from one file object does not affect the file positioning of another 
file object, nor the data available to it. However, writing to a file object may 
not cause the external file to be immediately updated: see section U F S.2.5.1 
Interaction of File Sharing and File Buffering” for details. 

For shared files on sequential devices or interactive devices, such as magnetic 
tapes or keyboards, the data is no longer shared. In other words, a magnetic 
record or keyboard input character read by one I/O operation is no longer 
available to the next operation, whether it is performed on the same file object 
or not. This is simply due to the sequential nature of the device. 

By default, file objects represented by STANDARD.INPUT and STANDARD.OUTPUT 
are preconnected to the HP-UX streams stdin and stdout (see stdio(S)), 
and thus are of this sequential variety of file. The HP-UX stream stderr is not 
preconnected to an Ada file, but is used by the Ada runtime system for error 
messages. An Ada subprogram called PUT.TC.STANDARD.ERROR is provided in 
the package SYSTEH.ENVIRONMENT which allows your program to output a line 
to the HP-UX stream stderr. 


Note The sharing of external files is system-wide and is managed by 

the HP-UX operating system. Several programs may share one 
or more external files. The file sharing feature of HP Ada using 
the FORM parameter SHARED, which is discussed in section 
“F S.2.5 The FORM Parameter Attribute - File Sharing", 
is not system-wide, but is a file sharing within a single Ada 
program and is managed by that program. 


8-12 F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 







F 8.1.6 I/O Involving Access Types 

When an object of an access type is specified as the source or destination of an 
I/O operation (read or write), the 32-bit binary access value is read or written 
unchanged. If an access value is read from a file, make sure that the access 
value read designates a valid object. This will only be the case if the access 
value read was previously written by the same execution of the program that is 
reading it, and the object which it designated at the time it was written still 
exists (that is, the scope in which it was allocated has not been exited, nor has 
an UNCHECKED.DEALLOCATION been performed on it). A program may execute 
erroneously or raise PROGRAM.ERRQR if an access type read from a file does not 
designate a valid object. In general. I/O involving access types is strongly 
discouraged. 


F 8.1.7 I/O Involving Local Area Networks 

This section assumes knowledge of networks. It describes Ada program I/O 
involving Local Area Network (LAN) services available on the Series 600, 700. 
and 800 computers. 

The Ada programs discussed here are executed on a local (host) computer. 
These programs access or create files on a remote system, which is connected to 
a mass storage device not directly connected to the host computer. The remote 
file system can be mounted and accessed by the host computer using NFSi 
LAN services. NFS systems are described in the manuals Using .\ T FS Services 
and Installing and Administering .\'FS Services. 


t NFS is a trademark of Sun Microsystems. Inc. 


F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 8-13 





If an Ada program expects to access or create a file on a remote file system 
using NFS LAN services, the remote volumes that contain the file system must 
be mounted on the host computer prior to the execution of the Ada program. 

For example, assume that a remote system exports a file system /project, 
/project is mounted on the host computer as /ada/project. Files in this 
remote file system are accessed or created by references to the files as if they 
were part of the local file system. To access the file test .file, the program 
would reference /ada/project/test.file on the local system. Note that 
test.file appears as /project/test.file on the remote system. 

The remote file system must be exported to the local system before it can be 
locally mounted using the mount(ln) command. 


F 8.1.8 Potential Problems with I/O From Ada Tasks 

In an Ada tasking environment on the HP 9000 Series 600. TOO, and S00. the 
Ada runtime must ensure that a file object is protected against attempts to 
perform multiple simultaneous I/O operations on it. If such protection was 
not provided, the internal state of the file object could become incorrect. For 
example, consider the case of two tasks each writing to STANDARD.OUTPUT 
simultaneously. The internal values of a text file object include information 
returned by 7EXT.I0.C0L, TEXT.IO.LINE. and TEXT. ID .PAGE functions. 

These internal values are volatile and any I/O operations that change these 
values must be completed before any other I/O operations are begun on the 
file object. Thus, the file object is protected by the Ada runtime for the 
duration of the I/O operation. If another task is scheduled and runs before the 
I/O operation has completed and this task attempts to perform I/O on the 
protected file object, the exception PR0GRAM.ERR0R is generated at the point of 
the I/O operation. If this exception is not caught by the task, the task will be 
terminated. 


8-14 F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 








Note that the file protection provided by the Ada runtime is not the same 
as the protection provided by the use of the SHARED attribute of the FORM 
parameter of CREATE or OPEN calls. The FORM parameter either prohibits or 
allows multiple Ada file objects to share the same external file. In contrast, the 
file protection provided by the Ada runtime prohibits the simultaneous sharing 
of the same Ada file object between tasks. The SHARED attribute always deals 
with multiple Ada file objects. 

The file protection provided by the Ada runtime will only be a problem when 
the same Ada file object is used by different tasks. When each task uses a 
separate file object, it is not necessary to provide explicit synchronization when 
performing I/O operations. This is true even when the file objects are sharing 
the same external file. However, for this case, you will need to consider the 
effects of the SHARED attribute and/or file buffering. 


Caution It IS your responsibility to utilize proper synchronization and 
mutual exclusion in the use of shared resources. Note that 
shared access to a common resource (in this case, a file object) 
could be achieved by a rendezvous between tasks that share 
that resource. If you w-rite a program in which two tasks 
attempt to perform I/O operations on the same logical file 
without proper synchronization, that program is erroneous. 
(See Ada RM. section 9.11 ) 


F 8.1.9 I/O Involving Symbolic Links 

Some caution must be exercised when using an Ada program that performs I/O 
operations to files that involve symbolic links. For more detail on the use of 
symbolic links to files in HP-UX. see ln(l). 

Creating a symbolic link to a file creates a new name for that file: that is. an 
alias for the actual file name is created. If you use the actual file name or its 
alias (tiiat is. the name involving symbolic links;, Ada I/O operations will work 
correctly. However, the NAME function in the TEXT.IO, SEQUENTIAL.IO. and 
DIRECT.10 packages will always return the actual ro.oted path of a file and not 
a path involving symbolic links. 


F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 8-15 





F 8.1.10 Ada I/O System Dependencies 

Ada has a requirement (see Ada RM , section 14.2.1(21)) that the NAME 
function must return a string that uniquely identifies the external file in 
HP-UX. In determining the unique file name, the Ada runtime system may 
need to access directories and directory entries not directly associated with 
the specified file. This is particularly true when the path to the file specified 
involves an NFS remote file system. This access involves HP-UX operating 
system calls that are constrained by HP-UX access permissions and are subject 
to failures of the underlying file system, as well as by network behavior. 


Caution It is during the Ada OPEN and CREATE routines that the name 

which uniquely identifies the external file is determined for later 
use by the NAME function. If it is not possible to determine that 
name, an exception is raised by the call to the OPEN or CREATE 
routine. 

If, during name determination, the underlying file system or 
network denies access (possibly due to a failed remote file 
system) or the access permissions are improper, the OPEN or 
CREATE call will raise an exception. Or. for some conditions of 
network failure, the call might not complete until the situation 
is corrected. 

During file name determination, the Ada runtime temporarily 
changes the current working directory of the Ada program. 
However, it first determines the fully rooted path to the current 
working directory so it can restore the correct current working 
directory before returning control to the Ada program. If 
the runtime cannot determine the fully rooted path to the 
current working directory (usually because some directory in 
the fully rooted path to the current working directory lacks 
read (r) or search (x) permission for the effective user of the 
Ada program), the OPEN or CREATE of the file also fails with an 
exception. 

If the permissions for any directory on the fully rooted path 
to the current working directory are changed while the Ada 


8-16 F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 







runtime is in the process of determining the name of a file, the 
Ada runtime may be unable to restore the current working 
directory. This can only occur if the permission change denies 
the effective user of the Ada program read (r) or search (x) 
access to the directory whose permission changed. Because it is 
unsafe for the program to continue execution with an incorrect 
current working directory, the Ada runtime will abort the Ada 
program with a diagnostic message to stderr and a non-zero 
exit status. This abnormal termination can only occur if: 

1. The permissions for a directory (such as /A) in the rooted 
path to a directory (such as /A/8/C) are changed while am 
Ada program is running with /A/B/C as its cuncr.t working 
directory. 

2. The effective user of the Ada program loses ?ad (r) or 
search (x) permission (such as /A) because ot the change. 

3. The Ada runtime was in the process of determining the 
name of a file when the permission changed. 


For example, when opening a file, the Ada exception NAME.ERRGR is raised if 
there are any directories in the rooted path of the file that are not readable or 
searchable by the "effective uid" of the program. This restriction applies to 
intermediate path components that are encountered during the resolution of 
symbolic links. 

Also, if access to an NFS “hard" mounted remote file system is lost (possibly 
due to a network failure), subsequent OPEN or CREATE calls on a file whose 
actual rooted path contains the parent directory of the NFS mount point might 
not complete until the NFS failure is corrected (whether or not the actual file 
being accessed is on the failed NFS volume.)

F 8.2 The FORM Parameter 

For both the CREATE and OPEN procedures in Ada, the FORM parameter specifies 
the characteristics of the external file involved. 


F 8.2.1 An Overview of FORM Attributes 

The FORM parameter is a string composed from a list of attributes that specify 
the following: 

■ File protection. 

■ File buffering. 

■ File sharing. 

■ Appending. 

• Blocking. 

■ FIFO control. 

■ Terminal input. 

■ File structuring. 


F 8.2.2 The Format of FORM Parameters 

Attributes of tin. FORM parameter have an attribute keyword followed by the 
Ada "arrow symbol” (*>) and followed by a qualifier or numeric value. 

The arrow symbol and qualifier are not always needed and can be omitted. 
Thus, the formal for an attribute specifier is 

KEYWORD 

or 

KEYWORD => QUALIFIER 


8-18 F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 








The general format for the FORM parameter is a string formed from a list of 
attributes with attributes separated by commas. (FORM attributes are distinct 
from Ada attributes and the two are not related.) The FORM parameter string 
is not case sensitive. The arrow symbol can be separated by spaces from the 
keyword and qualifier. The two forms below are equivalent: 

KEYWORD *> QUALIFIER 
KEYWORD * > Q UA LIFIER 

In some cases, an attribute can have multiple qualifiers that can be presented 
at the same time. In cases that allow multiple qualifiers, additional qualifiers 
are introduced with an underscore (_). Note that spaces are not allowed 
between the additional qualifiers; only underscore characters are allowed. 
Otherwise, a USE.ERROR exception is raised by CREATE. The two example? that 
follow illustrate the FORM parameter format. 

The first example illustrates the use of the FORM parameter in the 
TEXT. 10.OPEN to set the file buffer size. 


-- Example of opening a file using the non-generic 
-- package TEXT.IO. This illustrates the use of the 
-- FORM parameter BUFFER.SIZE. 

-- Note: "input.file" must exist or NAME.ERROR will be 
-- raised,

procedure STEST is 

--Define a file object for use in Ada 
TFILE : TEXT.IO.FILE.TYPE;

— Buffer Size is 4096 bytes 

); 


The second example illustrates the use of the FORM parameter in 
TEXT. 10.CREATE. This example sets the access rights of the owner (HP-UX file 
permissions) on the created file and shows multiple qualifiers being presented at 
the same time. 


TEXT.10.CREATE (OUTPUT.FILE, TEXT_I0.0UT.FILE, OUTPUT.FILE.NAME, 
FORM*>"owner*>r«ad_Brite.execute"); 


8*20 F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 





F 8.2.3 The FORM Parameter Attribute - File Protection 


The file protection attribute is only meaningful for a call to the CREATE 
procedure. 

File protection involves two independent classifications. The first classification 
specifies which user can access the file and is indicated by the keywords listed 
in Table 8-2. 


Table 8*2. User Access Categories 


Category 

Grants Access To 

OWIER 

Only the owner of the created file. 

CROUP 

Only the members of a defined group. 

WORLD 

Any other user* 


Note that WORLD is similar to ‘•others” in HP-UX terminology, but was used in 
its place because OTHERS is an Ada reserved word. 

The second classification specifies access nghts for each classification of 
user. The four general types of access rights, which awe specified in the FORM 
parameter qualifier string, are listed in Table S-3. 


Table 8*3. File Access Rights 


Category 

Allows the User To 

READ 

Read from the external file 

WRITE 

Write to the external file 

EXECUTE 

Execute a program stored m the external file 

HONE 

The user lias no access rights to the external file. (This qualifier 
overrides an\ prior prtv«l—• 


F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 8-21 








More than one access right can be specified for a particular file. Additional 
access rights can be indicated by separating them with an underscore, as noted 
earlier. The following example using the FORM parameter in TEXT. 10.CREATE 
sets access rights of the owner and other users (HP-UX file permissions) on 
the created file. This example illustrates multiple qualifiers being used to set 
several permissions at the same time. 

TEXT.10.CREATE (OUTPUT.FILE, TEXT.IO.OUT.FILE, OUTPUT.FILE.NAME, 
FORM»>"ovner*>read_write_execute, world*>none"); 

Note that the HP-UX command uaask(l) may have set the default rights 
for any unspecified permissions. In the previous example, permission for the 
users in the category GROUP were unspecified. Typically, the default unask will 
be set so that the default allows newly created files to have read and write 
permission (and no execute permission) for each category of user (USER. GROUP, 
and WORLD). 

Consider the case where the users in WORLD want to execute a program in an 
external file, but only the owner may modify the file. The appropriate FORM 
parameter is: 

WORLD *> EXECUTE, 

OWNER *> READ.WRITE.EXECUTE 
This would be applied as: 

TEXT.10.CREATE (OUTPUT.FILE. TEXT.IO.OUT.FILE, OUTPUT.FILE.NAME, 

FORM*>"vorld“>execute, owner*>read.write.execute"); 

Repetition of the same qualifier within attributes is illegal: 

WORLD *> EXECUTE.EXECUTE — NOT legal 

But repetition of entire attributes is allowed: 

WORLD => EXECUTE, WORLD «> EXECUTE -- legal 


8-22 F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 








F 8.2.4 The FORM Parameter Attribute - File Buffering 

The buffer size can be specified by the attribute: 

BUFFER.SIZE ®> si:e^in.bytes 

The default value for BUFFER.SIZE is 2048 bytes. A value of zero specifies no 
buffering. Note that a BUFFER.SIZE value of one also specifies no buffering 
and is treated identical to the value zero. Using the file buffering attribute 
will improve I/O performance by a considerable amount in most cases. If I/O 
performance is a concern for disk files, the attribute BUFFER.SIZE should be set 
to a value that is an integral multiple of the size of a physical disk block. The 
size of a physical disk block can be found in <sys/paraxn.h> and is 1024 bytes 
for the HP 9000 Series 600, TOO, and 800. 

An example of using the FORM parameter in the TEXT.IO.OPEN to set the file 
buffer size is shown below: 

— An example of creating a file using the non-generic 
-- package TEXT.IQ. This illustrates the use of the 

— form parameter BUFFER.SIZE. 

with TEXT.10; 
procedure T.TEST is 

BFILE : TEXT.I0.FILE.TYPE; -- Define a file object 

-- for use by Ada 


begin -- T.TEST 


TEXT.10.CREATE (FILE => BFILE, 

-- Ada file is BFILE 


MODE => TEXT.10.OUT.FILE, 

— MODE is WRITE only 
NAME => "txt.file", 

— External file "txt.file" 
FORM => "BUFFER.SIZE *> 8192" 


); 


Buffer size is 8192 bytes 


end T.TEST; 


F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 8-23 







The BUFFER.SIZE attribute can be applied to files associated with terminals 
operating in TERMIHAL.INPUT «> LIMES mode and to files associated with 
pipes/FIFOs. However, there are additional considerations to take into account 
when doing this. See section “F 8.2.9 The FORM Parameter - Terminal 
Input” in this manual and the section “Ada 1/0 Operations on a Terminal or 
Pipe/FIFO” in Chapter 7 in the Ada User’s Guide for additional information. 


8-24 F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 








F 8.2.5 The FORM Parameter Attribute - File Sharing 

The file sharing attribute of the FORM parameter allows you to specify what 
kind of sharing is permitted when multiple file objects access the same external 
file. This control over file sharing is not system-wide, but is limited to a 
single Ada program. The HP-UX operating system controls file sharing at the 
system level. See section “F 8.1.5 System Level Sharing of Externa] Files” for 
information on system level file sharing between separate programs. 

An external file can be shared; that is, the external file can be associated 
simultaneously with several logical file objects created by the OPEN or CREATE 
procedures. The file sharing attributes forbids or limits this capability by 
specifying one of the modes listed in Table 8-4. 


Table 8-4. Fite Sharing Attribute Modes 


, 

Mode 

Description 

WOT_SHARED 

Indicates exclusive access. No other logical file can 
be associated with the extern; 1 file. 

SHARED 2 > READERS 

Only logical files of mode IN can be associated with 
the external file. 

SHAR£D-> siigle.writer 

Only logical files of mode IN and at most one file 
with mode OUT can be associated with the external 
file. 

shared=> any 

No restrictions this is the default. 


F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 8-25 



















A USE,ERROR exception is raised if either of the following conditions exists for 
an external Ale already associated with at least one logical Ada file: 

■ The OPEN or CREATE call specifies a file sharing attribute different than the 
current one in effect for this external file. Remember the attribute SHARED *> 
ANY is provided if the shared attribute is missing from the FORM parameter. 

■ A RESET call that changes the MODE of the file and violates the conditions 
imposed by the current file sharing attribute (that is, if SHARED ■> READERS 
is in effect, the RESET call cannot change a reader into writer). 

The current restriction imposed by the file sharing attribute disappears when 
the last logical file linked to the external file is closed. The next call to CREATE 
or OPEN can and does establish a new file sharing attribute for this external 
file. See section l ‘F 8.1.8 Potential Problems with I/O From Ada Tasks” for 
information about potential problems with I/O from Ada tasks. 


F 8.2.5.1 Interaction of File Sharing and File Buffering 

For files that are not buffered (the default), multiple I/O operations on an 
external file shared by several file objects are processed in the order they occur. 
• Each Ada I/O operation will be translated into the appropriate HP-UX system 
call (read(2). write(2), creat(2). op«n(2), or close(2)) and the external 
file will be updated by the HP-UX I/O runtime. Note that if file access is 
performed across a network device, the external file may not be immediately 
updated. However, additional I/O operations on the file will be queued and 
must wait until the original operation has completed. This allows multiple 
readers and multiple writers for the external file. 

For files that are buffered, multiple I/O operations each operate sequentially 
only within the buffer that is associated with the file object and each file object 
has its own buffer. For write operations, this buffer is flushed to the disk either 
when the buffer is full, or when the file index is positioned outside of the buffer, 
or when the file is closed. The external file only reflects the changes made by 
a write operation after the buffer is flushed to the disk. Any accesses to the 
external file that occur before the buffer is flushed will not reflect the changes 
made to the file that exist only in the buffer. 


8*26 F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 





Due to this behavior, shared files should not be buffered if any write operations 
are to be performed on this file. This would be the case for file objects of the 
mode QUT.FILE or INOUT.FILE. Thus, when using buffered files safely, no 
writers are allowed, but multiple readers are allowed. 

File buffering is enabled by using the FORM parameter attributes at the time 
you open or create the file. If file buffering is enabled for a file, you should also 
specify a file sharing attribute of either NOT.SHARED or SHARED">READERS to 
prevent the effects of file buffering and file sharing interfering with one another. 
The Ada runtime w'ill raise the exception USE.ERROR if any attempt is made 
to share the file or to share and write the file, when the above file sharing 
attributes are provided as FORM parameters. 

If the possibility of shared access exists in your Ada program for sequential 
devices or interactive devices, you should specify a file sharing attribute of 
NOT.SHARED. This will prevent the negative effects of file sharing on these kinds 
of devices. 


F 8.2.6 The FORM Parameter Attribute - Appending to a File 

The APPEND attribute can only be used with the procedure OPEN. Its format is: 
APPEND 

Any output will be placed at the end of the named external file. 

Under normal circumstances, when an external file is opened, an index is set 
that points to the beginning of the file. If the APPEND attribute is present for a 
sequential or text file, data transfer begins at the end of the file. For a direct 
access file, the value of the index is set to one more than the number of records 
in the external file. 

The APPEND attribute is not applicable to terminal devices. 


F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 8-27 




F 8.2.7 The FORM Parameter Attribute - Blocking 

This attribute has two alternative forms: 

BLOCKING 

or 

NON.BLOCKING 


The default for this attribute depends on the Ada program. The default is 
BLOCKING for programs without any task declarations and is NON.BLOCKING for 
programs containing tasks. 

The NON.BLOCKING default allows tasking programs to take advantage of their 
parallelism in the presence of certain I/O requests. There is normally little 
advantage in specifying NON.BLOCKING within a non-tasking program because 
the program must wait for the I/O request to complete before continuing its 
sequential execution. However, if a non-tasking program declares interrupt 
handlers, and if the interrupt handler or handlers are likely to be invoked 
frequently, NON.BLOCKING may be appropriate to provide more reliable data 
transfer (see the warning in section “F 8.2.7.1 Blocking” for additional 
information). 


F 8.2.7.1 Blocking 

If the FORM parameter BLOCKING is specified (or is the default). I/O operations 
will “block” at the HP-UX level awaiting completion of the I/O operation. 
However, this does not guarantee that all Ada tasks will be blocked from 
running until the "blocked" I/O operation is complete. If there are one or more 
active delay statements, or if time-slicing is enabled, or if interrupt handlers 
or entries have been enabled. HP-UX signals may be received by the program 
during the ‘’blocked” I/O operation. These HP-UX signals will cause HP-UX 
to terminate the I/O operation as interrupted and may cause the Ada runtime 
system to permit other tasks to execute. When the task that was performing 
the “blocked" I/O ope. ttion is permitted by the Ada runtime to execute again, 
the interrupted “blocked" I/O operation will be automatically restarted. 


8*28 F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 





Caution 


If a “blocked” I/O operation is frequently interrupted 
and restarted as described above, the operation may be 
unable to complete successfully. In addition, under some 
circumstances, data could be lost by HP-UX when an I/O 
operation is interrupted and restarted. To avoid these 
difficulties, either specify (or default) the FORM parameter 
to NON.BLOCKING or, if a “true blocking" I/O operation is 
needed, specify (or default) the FORM parameter to BLOCK 
and additionally surround the “blocking” I/O operation 
with calls to SYSTEM.ENVIRONMENT. SUSPEND.ADA.TASKING 
and SYSTEM.ENVIRONMENT.RESUME.ADA.TASKING. The 
SYSTEM.ENVIRONMENT.SUSPEND.ADA.TASKING call will disable 
or block the HP-UX signals associated with delay, time-slicing, 
and interrupt handlers or entries during the I/O operation. 


F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 8-29 







F 8.2.7.2 Non-Blocking 

The NON.BLOCKING attribute specifies that when a read or write request cannot 
be immediately satisfied, the Ada runtime should attempt to schedule another 
task to run and retry the I/O operation later. The current implementation of 
this attribute allows for the following three cases: 

1. Non-blocking read operations are performed on all terminal devices. Refer 
to the section “Ada I/O Operations on a Terminal or Pipe/FIFO” in 
Chapter 7 in the Ada User's Guide for additional information. 

2. For HP-UX pipes and FIFO special files, read requests will not block when 
the pipe/FIFO contains no data and write requests will not block when the 
pipe/FIFO is full. Refer to the section “Ada I/O Operations on a Terminal 
or Pipe/FIFO” in the Chapter 7 in the Ada User's Guide for additional 
information. 

3. The non-blocking attribute sets the HP-UX flag O.NQNBLOCK. a flag 
to open(2). that allows non-blocking access to a normal disk file with 
enforcement-mode recording locking set (see lockf (2)). 

For this case, read and write requests will not block only if the portion of 
the file being accessed is currently locked by another process. Most files will 
not have enforcement-mode record locking enabled. 

The normal behavior of HP-UX I/O operations on disk files is to block until 
the I/O request completes. Thus, in an Ada talking program, when a single 
task performs a read operation upon a disk file. HP-UX blocks the process until 
the I/O request can be satisfied. However, HP-UX will automatically perform 
disk cacheing so that a write operation will return before data is physically 
written to the disk. 


8-30 F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 







F 8.2.8 The FORM Parameter - FIFO Control 

The FIFO control attribute has one of two alternate forms: 

FIFO.EOF *> YES 

FIFO.EOF ■> NO 

The default value of FIFO.EOF is YES. 

The FIFO.EOF attribute controls the behavior of an Ada file associated with a 

FIFO special file, as follows: 

■ When a FIFO special file is opened for reading (IN.FILE), by default 
(FIFO.EOF *> YES) the Ada END.OF.FILE condition becomes true when the 
last process having the FIFO open for writing closes the FIFO special file. 

a When a FIFO special file is opened for reading (IN.FILE) and 
FIFO.EOF «> NO is specified, the Ada END.OF.FILE condition never becomes 
true and so another mechanism is needed to signal that no further attempts 
to read from such a FIFO should be attempted. This mode of operation 
would most likely be used by a monitor or daemon type program that 
monitors (reads) a FIFO that does not always have a writing process 
attached to it. This mode of operation may also be necessary when a FIFO 
special file is opened for reading, in NON.BLOCKINC mode, to avoid premature 
signaling of the Ada END.OF.FILE condition when there are currently no 
processes with the FIFO open for writing. 

a When a FIFO special file is opened for writing (OUT.FILE). by default 
(FIFO.EOF *> YES). There are no special conditions or behaviors if the FIFO 
is opened in BLOCKING mode (the default in non-tasking programs). If th* 
FIFO is opened in NON.BLOCKINC mode (the default in tasking programs), 
the open will fail with a USE.ERROR if the FIFO is not already open for 
reading bv another for the same) process. 


F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 8-31 









■ When a FIFO special file is opened for writing (OUT.FILE) and 
FIFO.EOF *> NO is specified, there are no special conditions or behaviors if 
the FIFO is opened in BLOCKING mode (the default in non-tasking programs). 
If the FIFO is opened in NON ..BLOCKING mode (the default in tasking 
programs), an attempt is made to open the FIFO such that a USE.ERROR 
does not occur if the FIFO is not already open for reading by another (or the 
same) process. The Ada I/O system attempts to avoid the USE.ERROR by 
performing the HP-UX open of the FIFO to permit both writing and reading 
(although Ada I/O only permits writing to the associated Ada file). Because 
opening a FIFO for both writing and reading provides a reader of the FIFO 
in the HP-UX sense, the open for writing will not fail with a USE.ERROR if no 
process already has the FIFO open for reading. Note that if FIFO.EOF *> NO, 
but the FIFO cannot be successfully opened for both writing and reading 
(that is, you do not have read access to the FIFO), the Ada I/O system 
reattempts the open for writing onh. If the Ada I/O must reattempt the 
open for writing only, it is then possible for the open to fail with USE.ERROR 
if there is not already a process with the FIFO open for reading even though 
FIFO.EOF *> NO was specified. 

■ Once a FIFO special file is successfully opened explicitly for writing 
(OUT.FILE). and the open specified or defaulted to NON.BLOCKING mode, the 
Ada program receives no notification (that is. no exception is raied) when the 
last reading process closes the read end of the FIFO. If FIFO.EOF *> NO was 
specified, there is always at least one reader in the HP-UX sense, and the 
last reader does not close the read end until the Ada file opened for writing 

is closed (for example, the Ada open for writing opened for FIFO for both 
reading and writing). If FIFO.EOF «> YES was specified (or defaulted), a last 
reader can close the FIFO, but the Ada program is not notified. The Ada 
I/O system continues to write data to the FIFO until the FIFO fills up and 
internally retries further write requests. In a non-tasking Ada program, some 
Ada write operations to the FIFO eventually blocks the entire program. In a 
tasking Ada program, no single Ada write operation to the FIFO blocks the 
entire program, although Ada write operations to the FIFO eventually blocks 
the tasks performing them. 

Refer to the section “'Ada I/O Operations on a Terminal or Pipe/FIFO" in 

Chapter 7 in the Ada User's Guide for additional information. 


8*32 F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 




F 8.2.9 The FORM Parameter - Terminal Input 

The terminal input attribute has one of two alternative forms: 

TERMINAL.INPUT »> LINES. 

TERMINAL.INPUT «> CHARACTERS, 

Terminal input is normally processed by Ada (and HP-UX) in units of one 
line at a time. An Ada program attempting to read from the terminal as an 
external file does not receive any data from the terminal until a complete line is 
typed. At that time, the outstanding read operation (and possibly subsequent 
read operations) is satisfied. In this mode, the HP-UX line editing characters 
“kiir and "erase” can be used to edit the input characters before the Ada 
program is given access to the characters. 

The TERMINAL.INPUT *> LINES attribute, the default case, specifies the one line 
at a time mode of transfer. Note that the BUFFER.SIZE attribute may be set 
to any value greater or equal to zero when LINES mode is in effect. However, 
if the BUFFER.SIZE is greater than one, no characters are available to the A la 
program until at least BUFFER.SIZE of them have been entered (which may 
require multiple lines of input). Once BUFFER.SIZE number of characters has 
been entered, only BUFFER.SIZE number of characters are available to the 
Ada program until the next BUFFER.TIZE number of characters are entered. 
Because BUFFER.SIZE number of characters may be reached in the middle of a 
line, the behavior of the program may be confusing to the person entering data. 
A BUFFER.SIZE greater than one is not recommended if a person is entering 
data, although it may make sense if the “terminal" is a data communication 
line from a device that is producing the data. Refer to the section on "Ada 
I/O Operations on a Terminal or Pipe/FIFO" in Chapter 7 in the Ada User's 
Guidt for additional information. 

Terminal input can optionally be processed by Ada {and HP-UX) in units 
of one character at a time. An Ada program attempting to read from the 
terminal as an external file will receive data from the terminal as it is typed. 

In this mode, the HP-UX line editing characters "kill" and "erase" inav not be 
used to edit the input characters before the Ada program is given access to the 
characters. 


F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 8-33 











The TERMINAL.INPUT *> CHARACTERS attribute specifies that data transfers 
occur character by character, so a complete line does not need to be entered 
before one or several read operations are satisfied. Note that the BUFFER.SIZE 
attribute can only be set to zero or one when CHARACTERS mode is in effect. 

When CHARACTERS mode is in effect, the ICANON bit is cleared in the c.lf lag 
of the HP-UX teraio structure. This bit changes the line discipline of the 
terminal device. The line discipline state is not maintained on a per file 
descriptor basis, so changing the line discipline for one terminal file does affect 
the line discipline of all terminal files that refer the same physical terminal 
device or pseudo terminal process or terminal window. Care must be taken 
if the same terminal device is to be accessed via multiple Ada files; the line 
discipline caused by the most recent OPEN operation is applied to all Ada files 
associated with the same terminal. See teroio(7) and the section “Ada I/O 
Operations on a Terminal or Pipe/FIFO" in Chapter 7 in the Ado User’s 
Guide for additional information. 

Because the TERMINAL.INPUT attribute is only available for explicitly opened 
files, the TERMINAL.INPUT attribute of the default STANDARD.INPUT file 
cannot be changed and the default STANDARD.INPUT file always operates 
in LINES mode. If a terminal is associated with STANDARD.INPUT, it 
can be accessed in CHARACTERS mode if opened explicitly with the FORM 
parameter TERMINAL.INPUT => CHARACTERS. The external file name of the 
terminal associated with STANDARD.INPUT can be obtained with the HP-UX 
ctyname(3C) function by passing it an argument of zero, or the file name 
/dev/tty can be used to open the same terminal device as that associated with 
STANDARD.INPUT.

There is no FORM parameter to define the structure of text files. A text file

F 8.2.10.2 The Structure of DIRECT JO and SEQUENTIAL. 10 Flies 

This section describes use of the FORM parameter for binary (sequential or 
direct access) files. Two FORM attributes, RECORD.SIZE and RECORD.UNIT, 
control the structure of binary files. 

Such a file can be viewed as a sequence or a set of consecutive RECORDS. The 
structure of a record is 

[ HEADER 3 OBJECT [ UNUSED.PART 3 

A record is composed of up to three items: 

1. A HEADER consisting of two fields (each 32 bits): 
a The length of the object in bytes. 

a The length of the descriptor in bytes; for this implementation of Ada. the 
length is always zero. 

2. An OBJECT with the exact binary representation of the Ada object in the 
executable program, possibly including an object descriptor. 

3. An UNUSED.PART of variable size to permit full control of the record’s size. 

The HEADER is implemented only if the actual parameter of the instantiation of 
the I/O package is unconstrained. 

The file structure attributes take the form: 

RECORD.SIZE «> sir<_tn_6yfes 

RECORD.UNIT *> si:e-in.bytes 

The attributes' meaning depends on the object’s type (constrained or 
unconstrained) and the file access mode (sequential or direct access). 


F 8. Implementation-Dependent Input-Output 8-37 





There are four types of access that are possible: 

■ Sequential access of fixed size, constrained objects. 

■ Sequential access of varying size, unconstrained objects, with objects rounded 
up to a multiple of the RECORD-UNIT size. 

■ Dire, access of fixed si 2 e, constrained objects. 

a Direct access of fixed size, unconstrained objects, with a maximum size for 
the object. 

The consequences of the above are listed in Table 8-6.

F 9. The Ada Development System and 
HP-UX Signals 


The Ada runtime on the HP 9000 Series 600/700/800 uses HP-UX signals to 
implement the following features of the Ada language: 

■ Ada exception handling. 

■ Ada task management. 

■ Ada delay timing. 

■ Ada program termination. 

■ Ada interrupt entries.

STORAGE.ERROR. or PROGRAM.ERROR exceptions. 


9*2 F 9. The Ada Development System and HP-UX Signals 























Note 


The signals SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, and SIGILL are not reserved 
by the Ada runtime. These signals are never deliberately 
produced by generated code or by the Ada runtime to cause 
an exception to be raised. If, due to a programming error, 
access is attempted on misaligned or protected data (causing 
SIGSEGV or SIGBUS) or an illegal instruction is executed 
(causing SIGILL), a PRQGRAM.ERRQR occurs. When receiving 
these signals, a PROGRAM.ERROR is raised unless the application 
has overridden the Ada runtime and an alternative action 
has been specified. If the Interrupt Entry mechanism (see 
Chapter 12) is used to specify an Ada handler for one or more 
of these signals, and the ORIGINAL.HANDLER parameter to 
INSTALL.hANDLER was not REPLACED, the “original handler” 
that will be invoked (either FIRST or LAST) will be the default 
Ada runtime handler that will raise PROGRAM.ERROR. Therefore. 
ORIGINAL.HANDLER *> REPLACED is recommended when using 
INSTALL.HANDLER with one of these signals. 


F 9. The Ada Development System and HP-UX Signals 9-3 






Note 


The signals listed as causing exceptions in Table 9-1 will induce 
an exception even if non-Ada code is executing at the time the 
signal is received. If interface code causes one of these signals 
or is running when a signal is received from an outside source, 
the Ada code that called the interface code will receive an Ada 
exception. 


Note The alarm signals SIGALRM, SIGVTALRM, and SIGPROF are not 

always used or reserved in an Ada program. See the rest of this 
section for details. 


The HP-UX signals SIGALRM, SIGVTALRM, and SIGPROF are reserved by the Ada 
runtime for some Ada application program configurations and are not reserved 
by the Ada runtime for other Ada application program configurations.

F 9.2 Using HP-UX Signals in External Interfaced 
Subprograms 

When your Ada code uses external interfaced subprograms, you must take the 

following into consideration: 

■ If the external interfaced subprograms want to manipulate any of the 
signals reserved by the Ada runtime, they use the sigvectox and 
sigsetmask(2)/sigblock(2) mechanism or a compatible mechanism. Using 
the non-compatible signal(2) mechanism might produce unpredictable 
program behavior. 

■ If the external interfaced subprograms change the signal handling action 
(that is, SIG.DEL. SIG.IGN, or user handler) for any HP-UX signal reserved 
by the Ada runtime, the original signal handling action must be restored 
before returning control to Ada code. Failure to restore the Ada signal action 
will produce unpredictable program behavior. 

■ If the external interfaced subprograms change the signal mask bits of any of 
the HP-UX signals reserved by the Ada runtime, the original mask bits for 
those signals must be restored before returning control to Ada code. Failure 
to restore the original signal mask will produce unpredictable program 
behavior. 

Additional considerations are detailed in section 4 'F 11.7 Potential Problems 

Using Interfaced Subprograms". 


9-6 F 9. The Ada Development System and HP-UX Signals 






I 


F 9.3 HP-UX Signals Used for Ada Exception Handling 

The Ada implementation uses signals to raise exceptions. The Ada runtime 
handlers for these signals are set during the elaboration of the Ada runtime 
system. Defining a new handler for any of these signals subverts the normal 
exception handling mechanism of Ada and will most likely result in an 
erroneous runtime execution. 

If your Ada program uses external interfaced subprograms, you must ensure 
that these external interfaced subprograms do not redefine the signal behavior 
for any of the HP-UX signals reserved by the Ada runtime. If you change the 
signal behavior for the signal used for Ada exception handling (SIGFPE) and 
your Ada program attempts to raise an exception, unpredictable program 
behavior will result. 

The SIGFPE signal has a predefined meaning and is reserved for use by the 
Ada runtime for exception handling. The SIGFPE signal is generated in 
your compiled Ada code whenever one of the predefined runtime checks fail, 
including null access value checks. The runtime examines the context in which 
the signal occurred and raises the appropriate exception: CONSTRAINT.ERROR. 
NUMERIC.ERROR.STORAGE.ERROR, or PROGRAM.ERROR. An unexpected SIGFPE 
signal that was generated outside of Ada code or sent to the process from 
an outside source causes the exception PROGRAM.ERROR to be raised. If 
the unexpected signal occurred in a context where the runtime believed a 
legitimate exception could have occurred, that exception is raised instead of 
PROGRAM.ERROR. 



F 9. The Ada Development System and HP-UX Signals 


9-7 




The signals SIGSEGV and S1GBUS are not reserved by the Ada runtime. They 
are generated by access to an illegal or improperly aligned address. Normally 
these signals are not generated in an Ada program because access values 

• are initialized to null 

■ are only assigned legal and properly aligned values by generated code 

■ have runtime checks performed on them to detect attempts to dereference a 
null access value (causing CQNSTRAINT.ERROR using SIGFPE as mentioned 
above) 

Such illegal or improperly aligned addresses are usually produced by the 
improper use ofUNCHECKED.CONVERSION or are supplied by interfaced code. In 
response to receiving SIGSEGV, the Ada runtime raises PROGRAM.ERROR. An 
unexpected SIGSEGV signal that was generated outside of Ada code or was sent 
to the process from an outside source also causes the exception PROGRAM.ERROR 
to be raised. 

The signal SIGILL is not reserved by the Ada runtime. It is generated by 
the execution of an illegal instruction. Normally this signal is not generated 
in an Ada program because generated Ada code does not contain any illegal 
instructions. Execution of an illegal instruction usually occurs in interfaced 
code. In response to receiving SIGILL. the Ada runtime raises PROGRAM.ERROR. 
An unexpected SIGILL signal that was generated outside of Ada code or 
was sent to the process from an outside source also causes the exception 
PROGRAM.ERROR to be raised. 


Note l ser code can define its own handler (or change the signal 

action] for SIGSEGV, SIGBUS. and SIGILL without directly 
compromising the operation of the Ada program. However, 
ignoring a synchronous instance of one of the signals or 
continuing execution after handling a synchronous instance 
of one of these signals is not advised without a thorough 
understanding of the causes and continuation strategies for such 
signals under HP-L’X on PA .RISC. 


9-8 F 9. The Ada Development System and HP-UX Signals 






Note 


The Ada binder does not specify -2 or -Z to the linker (ld(l)) 
to control the system action on a dereference of a nail pointer. 
Either the ld(l) default or a user-specified value (using -W 1) 
will therefore take effect. 

If Ada code is compiled with checks enabled (the default case), 
the Ada Runtime System will operate properly with either -2 
or -Z linker options. This is because Ada generates software 
checks for null pointer dereferencing. 

If Ada code is compiled with pointer dereference checks 
disabled (using the -C or -R compiler options or using pragma 
SUPPRESS), some null pointer checking can be restored with no 
runtime overhead by using the -2 linker option. 

If -z is specified, the system will send SIGSEGV when a null 
pointer is dereferenced: the Ada Runtime System will map that 
signal to PROGRAH.ERROR. The Ada software checks for null 
pointer dereferencing are intended to handle ail cases where a 
null pointer could appear. CONSTRAINT.ERROR will be raised if 
such a dereference occurs. SIGSEGV, enabled by the -2 linker 
option, will only be sent when the final result of an address 
calculation is the null pointer. The resulting exception will be 
PROGRAM.ERROR instead of CONSTRAINT.ERROR. 


F 9. The Ada Development System and HP-UX Signals 9-9

F 9.4 HP-UX Signals Used for Ada Task Management 

When an Ada program contains tasks and time-slicing was enabled (or enabled 
by default) at bind time, the Ada runtime system uses one of the following to 
control the time-slice interval: SIGALRK, SIGVTALRM (the default), or SIGPROF. 
The Ada runtime allocates the available processor time among ready-to-run 
tasks by giving each task one or more time-slice intervals. 

When an Ada program does not contain tasks, or contains tasks but 
time-slicing was disabled at bind time, neither SIGVTALRM nor SIGPROF 
is reserved by the Ada runtime. If an Ada program contains tasks but 
time-slicing is disabled, SIGALRM may or may not be reserved (see 
“F 9.1 HP-UX Signals Reserved by the Ada Runtime” for more information). 

If vour Ada program uses external interfaced subprograms, you must ensure 
that these external interfaced subprograms do not redefine the signal behavior 
for any of the HP-l'X signals reserved by the Ada runtime. If you change 
the signal behavior for the signal used for Ada task management (SIGALRM, 
SIGVTALRM. or SIGPROF) and your Ada program is using time-slicing, 
unpredictable program behavior will result. 


9-10 F 9. The Ada Development System and HP-UX Signals 





F 9.5 HP-UX Signals Used for Ada Delay Timing 

When an Ada program contains delay statements, the Ada runtime system 
uses SIGALRM to time the delay intervals. The resolution of the SIGALRM timer 
is 1/100 of a second. Thus, all delay statements are implemented using actual 
delays that are integral multiples of 1/100 of a second. Non-zero delays for 
periods smaller than 1/100 of a second will delay for at least 1/100 of a second. 
Zero delays will not cause an actual delay, but will provide an opportunity for 
the Ada runtime to change the currently running task to a different task (if 
appropriate). 

If an Ada program contains delay statements, SIGALRM is reserved. If an Ada 
program contains tasks but does not contain any delay statements, SIGALRM 
may or may not be reserved (see “F 9.1 HP-UX Signals Reserved by the Ada 
Runtime” for details). 

If your Ada program uses external interfaced subprograms, you must ensure 
that these external interfaced subprograms do not redefine the signal behavior 
for any of the HP-UX signals reserved by the Ada runtime. If you change the 
signal behavior used for Ada delay timing (SIGALRM) and your Ada program 
contains a delay statement, unpredictable program behavior will result. 


F 9. The Ada Development System and HP-UX Signals 9-11 





F 9.6 HP-UX Signals Used for Ada Program Termination 

The signals SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGTERM, and SIGPIPE are recognized by 
the Ada runtime as attempts to terminate the Ada program. The Ada runtime 
initially arranges to catch each of these signals. If the Ada runtime catches one 
of these signals, Ada runtime cleanup actions are performed and the program 
is terminated in such a way that the parent program sees the Ada program 
as having been terminated by the signal. The Ada runtime cleanup actions 
include flushing file buffers and closing files, as well as restoring terminal 
characteristics that have been altered by the Ada I/O system. However, these 
signals are not reserved by the Ada runtime and the application is free to use 
one or more of these signals for application-defined purposes. 

If the application-defined purpose is also to signal that the program should be 
terminated, when the application is finished handling the signal it should: 

1. Restore the original Ada signal handler (the handler the application saved 
when it altered the signal behavior for its own purposes). 

2. Ensure that the signal is not masked. 

3. Send the same signal to itself again to invoke the Ada runtime signaled 
termination process. 



9*12 F 9. The Ada Development System and HP-UX Signals 




I 


Caution 


If a. signal is not currently reserved by the Ada runtime (see the 
appropriate sections of F 9) or is not recognized as an attempt 
to terminate the Ada program (see the list of such signals 
above) and is received by the Ada program, the HP-UX action 
may be to terminate the program. Such a termination will 
not be intercepted by the Ada runtime and the Ada runtime 
cleanup actions will not occur. This could cause corrupted files 
and/or corrupted terminal states. If an Ada program is likely 
to receive such signals, the program should arrange to ignore or 
mask such signals or to catch and handle such signals. If such a 
signal terminates the Ada program, the Ada program should 
arrange to catch and handle such a signal, and should then 
send one of the defined termination signals (see list above) to 
itself tc trigger the Ada signaled termination process. The Ada 
program should ensure that the original Ada handler is in effect 
for that termination signal and that the signal is not masked 
before sending the signal to itself. 


F 9. The Ada Development System and HP-UX Signals 9*t3 





F 9.7 HP-UX Signals Used for Ada Interrupt Entries 

Any HP-UX signal that is not reserved by the Ada runtime and that HP-UX 
permits to be caught can be associated with an interrupt entry. Interrupt 
entries provide a facility equivalent to that described by the Ada RM , 
section 13.5.1, although the actual mechanism supplied is more general. 

The interrupt entry facility is described in detail in section U F 12. Interrupt 
Entries”. 

The HP-UX signals that are reserved by the Ada runtime are specified earlier 
in this section. Those subsections should be consulted to determine which 
signals can be safely associated with interrupt entries. The interrupt entry 
mechanism will actually not prohibit the use of signals reserved by the Ada 
runtime, but using such signals for interrupt entries will cause unpredictable 
program behavior. 


Caution Associating an interrupt entry with a HP-UX signal that can 
be invoked synchronously (that is, by the execution of faulty 
code within the Ada program) should only be done with a 
thorough understanding of the behavior of the underlying 
hardware and of the behavior of HP-UX in the presence of such 
faults. Failure to correctly adjust the execution context before 
resuming after such faults can lead to repeated occurrences 
of the fault condition and/or other unpredictable program 
behavior. 


9*14 F 9. The Ada Development System and HP-UX Signals 





F 9.8 Protecting Interfaced Code from Ada’s 
Asynchronous Signals 

The SIGALRM, SIGVTALRM, and SIGPROF signals (described in sections “F 9.4 
HP-UX Signals Used for Ada Task Management” and “F 9.5 HP-UX Signals 
Used for Ada Delay Timing”) occur asynchronously. Because of this, they may 
occur while your code is executing an external interfaced subprogram. For 
details on protecting your external interfaced subprogram from adverse effects 
caused by these signals, see the section in the Ada User’s Guide on “Interfaced 
Subprograms and Ada's Use of Signals.” 


F 9.9 Programming in Ada With HP-UX Signals 

If you intend to utilize signals in external interfaced subprograms, refer to 
section F 11.7, “Potential Problems Using Interfaced Subprograms.” This 
version of HP Ada supports the association of an HP-UX signal, such as 
SIGINT. with an Ada signal handling procedure (and via such a procedure with 
a task entry). Refer to section “F 9.7 HP-UX Signals Used for Ada Interrupt 
Entries" and section "F 12. Interrupt Entries” for additional information.

F 10.3 Limitations Affecting User-Written Ada 
Applications 

The Ada compiler and Ada development environment is expected to be used 
on versions of the HP-UX operating system that support Network File Systems 
(NFS), diskless HP-UX workstations, long filename file systems and symbolic 
links to files. To accommodate this diversity within a file system used in 
both the development and target systems, the HP Ada compiler places some 
restrictions on the use of the OPEN and CREATE on external files. This section 
describes those restrictions. 


F 10.3.1 Restrictions Affecting Opening or Creating Files 

Unless you observe the following restrictions on the size of path components 
and file names, the OPEN or CREATE call will raise NAME.ERROR in certain 
situations. 


F 10.3.1.1 Restrictions on Path and Component Sizes 

The maximum number of characters in any path component of a file specified 
for access by an Ada program is 235. 

The maximum number of characters in the entire path to a file specified for 
access by an Ada program is 1023. 

The pathname limits apply to the entire path during and after the resolution 
of symbolic links and context-dependent files (CDFs) if they appear in the 
specified path. 


F 10.3.1.2 Additional Conditions that Raise NAME.ERROR 

When opening a file, the Ada exception NAME.ERROR will be raised if there 
are any directories tn the rooted path of the file that are not readable by the 
“effective uid" of the program. This restriction applies to intermediate path 
components that are encountered during the resolution of symbolic links. 


10*6 F 10. Limitations 




F 10.3.2 Restrictions on TEXTJO.FORM 

The function TEXT.I0.F0RM will raise USE.ERROR if it is called with either of 
the predefined files STANDARD.INPUT or STANDARD.OUTPUT. 


F 10.3.3 Restrictions on the Small of a Fixed Point Type 

A length clause may be used to specify the value to use for 'SMALL on a fixed 
point type. However, this implementation requires that the value specified 
for 'SMALL is a power of two. The compiler rejects a compilation unit with a 
length clause specification with an IMPLEMENTATION RESTRICTION if 'SMALL is 
not an exact power of two. 


F 10.3.4 Record Type Alignment Clause 

A record type alignment clause can specify that a record type is byte, 
half-word, word, or double-word aligned (specified as 1. 2, -4. or $ bytes). Ada 
DS does not support alignments larger than an $ oyte alignment.

F 11. Calling External Subprograms From Ada 


In Ada. parameters of external interfaced subprograms are passed according 
to the standard PA-RISC calling conventions (see PA-RISC Architecture 
Procedure Calling Convention Reference Manual). This convention is used by 
Hewlett-Packard for other language products on the HP 9000 Series 600, 700. 
and 800 family of computers. The languages described in this section are the 
HP implementations of HP-PA Assembler, HP C. HP FORTRAN 7". and HP 
Pascal on the HP UX Series 600, 700, and 800 systems. 

When you specify the interfaced language name, that name is used to select 
the correct calling conventions for supported languages. Subprograms written 
in PA-RISC Assembler. HP C, HP FORTRAN 77, and HP Pascal interface 
correctly with the Ada subprogram caller. This section contains detailed 
information about calling subprograms written in these languages. If the 
subprogram is written in a language from another vendor, you must follow the 
standard calling conventions. 

In the Ada implementation of external interfaced subprograms, the three 
Ada parameter passing modes i in. out. in out) are supported, with some 
limitations as noted below. Scalar and access parameters of mode in are 
passed by value. All other parameters of mode in are passed by reference. 
Parameters of mode out or in out are always passed by reference. (See 
Table 11-1 and section "F 11.1.2 Access Types” for details.)

classification (scalar, access, or composite). 

Only scalar types (enumeration, character. Boolean, integer, or floating point) 
or access types are allowed for the result returned by an external function 
subprogram.

from Ada code to non-Ada interfaced code. In particular, 
arrays and records occupying 64 bits or less of storage are 
passed by reference and are not passed by copy, as by the 
standard PA-RISC calling convention. Therefore, non-Ada code 
expecting to receive such array or record parameters must 
expect to receive them by reference, not by copy. C should 
declare parameters to be an appropriate pointer type; Pascal 
should declare parameters to be VAR parameters; FORTRAN 
always expects explicit parameters by reference. Note that 
array and record type parameters occupying more that 64 bits 
of storage are passed by reference, both by Ada and by the 
standard PA-RISC calling convention, and require no special 
precautions.

Note There are no checks for consistency between the subprogram 

parameters (as declared in Ada) and the corresponding external 
subprogram parameters. Because external subprograms have 
no notion of Ada's parameter modes, parameters passed by 
reference are not protected from modification by an external 
subprogram. Even if the parameter is declared to be only of 
mode in (and not out or in out) but is passed by reference 
(that is, an array or record type), the value of the Ada actual 
parameter can still be modified. 

The possibility that the parameter’s actual value will be 
modified by an external interfaced subprogram exists when 
that parameter is not passed by value. Objects whose attribute 
’ ADDRESS is passed as a parameter and parameters passed bv 
reference are not protected from alteration and are subject to 
modification by the external subprogram. In addition, such 
objects will have no run-time checks performed on their values 
upon return from interfaced external subprograms. 

Erroneous results may occur if the parameter values are altered 
in some way that violates Ada constraints for the actual Ada 
parameter. The responsibility is vours to ensure that values 
are not modified in external interfaced subprograms in such a 
manner as to subvert the strong typing and range checking 
enforced by the Ada language.

Caution Be very careful to establish the exact nature of the types of 
parameters to be passed. The bit representations of these 
types can be different between this implementation of Ada and 
other languages, or between different implementations of the 
Ada language. Pay careful attention to the size of parameters 
because parameters must occupy equal space in the interfaced 
language. When passing record types, pay particular attention 
to the internal organization of the elements of a record 
because Ada semantics do not guarantee a particular order of 
components. Moreover, Ada compilers are free to rearrange 
or add components within a record. See section U F 4. Type 
Representation*’ for more information.

F 11.1 General Considerations in Passing Ada Types 

Section F 11.1 discusses each data type in general terms. Sections F 11.2 
through F 11.5 describe the details of interfacing your Ada programs with 
external subprograms written in PA-RISC Assembler, HP C, HP FORTRAN 
77, and HP Pascal. Section F 11.6 provides summary tables. 

The Ada types are described in the following order: 

■ Scalar 

□ Integer 

d Enumeration 

□ Boolean 

c Character 
a Real 

■ Access 

■ Array 

■ Record 

■ Task 


F 11.1.1 Scalar Types 

This section describes general considerations when you are passing scalar types 
between Ada programs and subprograms written in a different HP language. 
The class scalar types includes integer, real, and enumeration types. Because 
character and Boolean types are predefined Ada enumeration types, they are 
also scalar types. 

Scalar type parameters of mode in are passed by value. Scalar type parameters 
of mode in out or out are passed by reference. 


11-6 F 11. Calling External Subprograms From Ada 









F 11.1.1.1 Integer Types 

In Ada, all integers are represented in two’s complement form. The 
type SHORT.SHORT.INTEGER is represented as an 8-bit quantity, the type 
SHORT.INTEGER is represented as a 16-bit quantity, and the type INTEGER is 
represented as a 32-bit quantity. 

All integer types can be passed to interfaced subprograms. When an integer is 
used as a parameter for an interfaced subprogram, the call can be made either 
by reference or by value. If passed by reference, the value of the actual integer 
parameter is not copied or modified, but a 32-bit address pointer to the integer 
value is passed. If passed by value, a copy of the actual integer parameter value 
is passed, based on its size, as per the standard PA-RISC calling convention. If 
passed in a register, it will be sign extended as required. See sections 
“F 11.2.1.1 Integer Types and Assembly Language Subprograms”. "F 11.3.1.1 
Integer Types and HP C Subprograms”. “F 11.4.1.1 Integer Types and HP 
FORTRAN 77 Subprograms”, and ”F 11.5.1.1 Integer Types and HP Pascal 
Subprograms”for details specific to interfaced subprograms written in different 
languages. 

Integer types may be returned as function results from external interfaced 
subprograms. 



F 11.1.1.2 Enumeration Types 

Values of an enumeration type (Ada R,\f . section 3.5.1) without an 
enumeration representation clause {.4dn RM, section 13.3) have an internal 
representation of the value's position in the list of enumeration literals defining 
the type. These values are non-negative. The first literal in the list corresponds 
to an integer value of zero. 

An enumeration representation clause can be used to further control the 
mapping of internal codes for an enumeration identifier. Sec section "F 41 
Enumeration Types." for information on enumeration representation clauses. 

Values of enumeration types are represented internally as either an 1G-. 
or 32-bit quantity <see section "F 4.1 Enumeration Types”). When an 
enumeration value is used as a parameter for an interfaced subprogram, the 
call can be made either by r eference or by value. If passed by reference, the 
value of the actual enumera ion parameter is not copied or modified, but 


F 11. Calling External Subprograms From Ada 11*7 






a 32-bit address pointer to the enumeration value is passed. If passed by 
value, a copy of the actual enumeration parameter value is passed, based 
on its size, as per the standard PA-RISC calling convention. If passed in 
a register, it will be zero extended as required. See sections “F 11.2.1.2 
Enumeration Types and Assembly Language”, U F 11.3.1.2 Enumeration 
Types and HP C Subprograms”, “F 11.4.1.2 Enumeration Types and HP 
FORTRAN 77 Subprograms”, and “F 11.5.1.2 Enumeration Types and HP 
Pascal Subprograms"for details specific to interfaced subprograms written in 
different languages. 

Enumeration types may be returned as function results from external interfaced 
subprograms. 


F 11.1.1.3 Boolean Types 

Values of the predefined enumeration type BOOLEAN are represented internally 
as an S-bit quantity. The Boolean value FALSE is represented by the S-bit value 
2#0000_0000# and the Boolean value TRUE is represented by the S-bit value 
2#0000_000l«. This representation is the same as that of any two-valued 
enumeration type whose size and internal code values have not been modified 
with a representation clause. 

Boolean values are passed the same as any other enumeration values. 

Boolean types can be returned as function results from external interfaced 
subprograms. 

See sections "F 11.2.1.3 Boolean Types and Assembly Language Subprograms". 
‘‘F 11.3.1.3 Boolean Types and HP C Subprograms", “F 11.4.1.3 Boolean

F 11.1.1.4 Character Types 

The values of the predefined enumeration type CHARACTER are represented as 
8-bit values in a range 0 through 127. 

Values of the character type are passed as parameters and returned as function 
results, as are values of any other 8-bit enumeration type. 

Character types may be returned as function results from external interfaced 
subprograms.

F 11.1.1.5 Real Types 

Ada fixed point types and Ada floating point types are discussed in the 
following subsections. 


Fixed Point Types 

Ada fixed point types ( Ada RM , sections 3.5.9 and 3.5.10) are not supported as 
parameters or as results of external interfaced subprograms. 

Fixed point types cannot be returned as function results from external 
interfaced subprograms. 


Floating Point Types 

Floating point values (Ada RM . sections 3.5.7 and 3.5.$) in the HP 
implementation of Ada are of 32 bits (FLOAT) or 64 bits (LONG.FLOAT). These 
two types conform to the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic 

The Ada type FLOAT is a 32-bit real type and is passed as a 32-bit real; this 
type is never extended to a 64-bit real. The Ada type LONG.FLDAT is a 64-bit 
•real type and is passed as a 64-bit real. 

Both floating point types can be passed to interfaced subprograms. When a 
floating point value is used as a parameter for an interfaced subprogram, the 
call can be made either by reference or by value. If passed by reference, the 
value of the actual floating point parameter is not copied or modified; a 32-bit 
address pointer to the floating point value is passed. If passed by value, a copy 
of the actual floating point parameter value is passed, based on its size, as per 
the standard PA-RISC calling convention. 

See sections “F 11.2.1.5 Real Types and Assembly Language Subprograms”, 

*‘F 11.3.1.5 Real Types and HP (.' Subprograms". “F 11.4.1.5 Real Types and 
HP FORTRAN 77 Subprograms”, and "F 11.5.1.5 Real Types and HP Pascal 
Subprograms"for details specific to interfaced subprograms written in different 
languages. 

Floating point types may be returned as function resuits from external 
interfaced subprograms, with some restrictions. Sec section "F 11.3.1.5 Real 
Types and HP C Subprograms'" for details.

F 11.1.2 Access Types 

Values of an access type (Ada RM, section 3.8) have an internal representation 
which is the 32-bit address of the underlying designated object. 

If you need to get a SYSTEM. ADDRESS containing the address of the accessed 
object and have the following declarations 

type PTR is access <something>; 

P: PTR; 

A: SYSTEM.ADDRESS; 
you can just declare 
function CONV is 

neu UNCHECKED.CONVERSION (PTR, SYSTEM.ADDRESS); 
and then declare 
A:* CONV(P); 

This converts the pointer into a SYSTEM.ADDRESS. 

An access type object has a value that is the address of the designated object. 
Therefore, when an access type is passed by value, a copy of this 32-bit address 
is passed. If an access type object is passed by reference, however, the address 
of the access type object itself is passed. This will effectively force references to 
the designated object to be double indirect references. 

See Figure 11-1 for details.

Figure 11*1. Passing Access Types to Interlaced Subprograms 


Access types may be returned as function results from external interfaced 
subprograms. 

Ada access types arc pointers to Ada objects. In the implementation of HP 
Ada for the Series 600, TOO. and S00 Computer System, an address pointer 
value will always point at the first byte of storage for the designated object 
and not at a descriptor for the object. This may not be the case for other 
implementations of the Ada language and should be considered when Ada 
source code portability is an issue. 

Note if a pointer to an unconstrained array object is passed to 

interC ec! code, the information that describes the run-time 
constraints meds to be passed explicitly. 


11-12 F 11. Calling External Subprograms From Ada 




11 


F 11.1.3 Array Types 

In the HP implementation of Ada, arrays (Ada RM , section 3.6) are always 
passed by reference. The value passed is the address of the first element of 
the array. When an array is passed as a parameter to an external interfaced 
subprogram, the usual checks on the consistency of array bounds between 
the calling program and the called subprogram are not enforced. You are 
responsible for ensuring that the external interfaced subprogram keeps within 
the proper array bounds. You may need to explicitly pass the upper and lower 
bounds for the array type to the external subprogram. 

The external subprogram should access and modify such an array in a manner 
appropriate to the actual Ada type. Note that Ada will not range check the 
values that may have been stored in the array by the external subprogram. 

In Ada. range checks are only required when assigning an object with a 
constraint; thus, range checks are not performed when reading the value of an 
object with a constraint. If an external subprogram modifies elements in an 
Ada array object, it has the responsibility to ensure that any values stored 
meet the type constraints imposed by the Ada type. 

Array element allocation, layout, and alignment are described in section k, F -1.7 
Array Types". 

Values of the predefined type STRING i Ada R.\f. section 3 6.3} are 
unconstrained arrays and are passed by reference as described above. The 
address of the first character in the string is passed. You may need to explicitly 
pass the upper and lower bounds or the length of the string to the external 
subprogram. 

Returning strings from an external interfaced subprogram to Ada (such as OUT 
parameters) is not supported. See section "F 11.3.3 Array Types and HP C 
Subprograms" for a complete example that shows how to return STRING type 
information from interfaced subprograms. 

Array types cannot be returned as function results from external interfaced 
subprograms. How«*v»*r. an access pc to the array type can lie returned a.- a 
function result.

Caution All array type parameters are passed by reference from 

Ada code to non-Ada interfaced code. In particular, arrays 
occupying 64 bits or less of storage are passed by reference 
and are not passed by copy, as is the standard PA-PJSC 
calling convention. Therefore, non-Ada code expecting to 
receive such array parameters must expect to receive them 
by reference, not by copy. C should declare such parameters 
to be an appropriate pointer type; Pascal should declare 
such parameters to be VAR parameters; FORTRAN always 
expects explicit parameters by reference. Note that array type 
parameters occupying more than 64 bits of storage are passed 
by reference, both by Ada and by the standard PA-RISC 
calling convention, and require no special precautions.

F 11.1.4 Record Types 

Records (Ada RM, section 3.7) are always passed by reference in the HP 
implementation of Ada, passing the 32-bit address of the first component of 
the record. The external subprogram should access and modify such a record 
in a manner appropriate to the actual Ada type. Note that Ada will not range 
check the values that may have been stored in the record by the external 
subprogram. In Ada, range checks are only required when assigning an object 
with a constraint; thus, range checks are not performed when reading the 
value of an object with a constraint. If an external subprogram modifies a 
component in an Ada record object, it has the responsibility to ensure that 
any values stored meet the type constraints imposed by the Ada type for that 
component. 

When interfacing with external subprograms using record types, it is 
recommended that you provide a complete record representation clause for 
the record type. It is also vour responsibility to ensure that the external 
subprogram accesses the record type in a manner that is consistent with 
the record representation clause. For a complete description of record 
representation clauses, see section “F 4.8 Record Types”. 


Caution All record type parameters are passed by reference from 

Ada code to non-Ada interfaced code. In particular, records 
occupying G-J bits or less of storage are passed by reference 
and are not passed by copy, as is the standard PA-RISC 
calling convention. Therefore, non-Ada code expecting to 
receive such record parameters must expect to receive them 
by reference, not by copy. C should declare such parameters 
to be an appropriate pointer type: Pascal should declare 
such parameters to be VAR parameters: FORTRAN always 
expects explicit parameters by reference. Note that record t> pe 
parameters occupying more than G-l bits of storage are passed 
by reference, both by Ada and b\ the standard PA-RISC 
calling convention, and require no special precaution.-.

F 11. Calling External Subprograms From Ada 11-15 






If a record representation clause is not used, you should be aware that the 
individual components of a record may have been reordered internally by 
the Ada compiler. This means that the implementation of the record type 
may have components in an different order than the declarative order. Ada 
semantics do not require a specific ordering of record components. 

When interfacing record types with external subprograms, you may want to 
communicate some or all of the offsets of individual record components. One 
reason for doing this would be to avoid duplicating the record information in 
two places: once in your Ada code and again in the interfaced code. Software 
maintenance is often complicated by this practice. 

The attribute ’POSITION returns the offset of a record component with respect 
to the starting address of the record. By passing this information to the 
external subprogram, you can avoid duplicating the record type definition in 
your external subprogram. 

The starting address of a record type can be passed to an external subprogram 
in one of three ways: 

■ The record object passed as a parameter (records are always passed by 
reference). 

• The attribute 'ADDRESS of the record object passed as a parameter. 

• A value parameter that is of an access type to the record object. 


11-16 F 11. Calling External Subprograms From Ada 





Direct assignment to a discriminant of a record is not allowed in Ada (Ada 
RM y section 3.7.1). A discriminant cannot be passed as an actual parameter 
of mode out or in out. This restriction applies equally to Ada subprograms 
and to external interfaced subprograms written in other languages. If an 
interfaced program is given access to the whole record (rather than individual 
components), that code should not change the discriminant value because that 
would violate the Ada standard rules for discriminant records. 

In Ada, records are packed and variant record parts are overlaid; the size of 
the record is the longest variant part. If a record contains discriminants or 
composite components having a dynamic size, the compiler may add implicit 
components to the record. See section U F 4.8 Record Types” for a complete 
discussion of these components. 

Dynamic components and components whose size depends upon record 
discriminant values are implemented indirectly within the record by using 
implicit ’OFFSET components. 

Record types cannot be returned as function results from external interfaced 
subprograms. However, an access type to the record type can be returned as a 
function result.

F 11.1.5 Task Types 

A task type cannot be passed to an external procedure or external function as 
a parameter in Ada. A task type cannot be returned as a function result from 
an external function.

F 11.2 Calling Assembly Language Subprograms 

When calling interfaced assembly language subprograms, specify the named 
external subprogram in a compiler directive: 

pragma INTERFACE ( ASSEMBLER, Ada.subprogram.name ) ; 

Note that the language type specification is ASSEMBLER and not ASSEMBLY. This 
description refers to the HP assembly language for the PA-R1SC processor 
family upon which the Series 600, 700, and S00 family is based. 

Interfaced subprograms written in PA-RISC Assembly Language that conform 
to the PA-RISC procedure calling conventions can be called from Ada with 
no special precautions. See the PA-RISC Architecture Procedure Calling 
Convention Reference Manual and the Assembly Language Reference Manual 
for additional information. 

Only scalar types (integer, floating point, character. Boolean, and enumeration 
types) and access types are allowed as result types for an external interfaced 
function subprogram written in PA-RISC Assembly Language.

F 11.3 Calling HP C Subprograms 

When calling interfaced HP C subprograms, the form 

pragma INTERFACE (C, Ada^subprogram.name) 

is used to identify the need to use the HP C parameter passing conventions. 

To call the following HP C subroutine 

void c.sub (val.parm, ref.parm) 
int val.parm; 
int *ref.parm; 

< 

> 

Ada requires an interfaced subprogram declaration: 

procedure C.SUB (VAL.PARAM : in INTEGER; 

REF_PARAM : in out INTEGER); 
pragma INTERFACE (C, C.SUB); 

In the above example we provided the Ada subprogram identifier C.SUB to the 
pragma INTERFACE. If a pragma INTERFACE.NAME is not supplied, the HP C 
subprogram name is the name of the Ada subprogram specified in the pragma 
INTERFACE, with all alphabetic characters shifted to lowercase. 

Note that the parameter in the preceding example. VAL.PARAM. must be of 
mode in to match the parameter definition for val.parm found in the HP C 
subroutine. Likewise. REF.PARAM, must be of mode in out to correctly match 
the C definition of “ref.parm. Also, note that the names for parameters do not 
need to match exactly. However, the mode of access and the data type must be 
correctly matched, but there is no compile-time or run-time check that can 
ensure that they match. It is your responsibility to ensure their correctness. 

You must use pragma INTERFACE.NAME whenever the HP C subprogram name 
contains characters not acceptable within Ada identifiers or when the HP 
C subprogram name contains uppercase ietter or letters. You can also use 
a pragma INTERFACE.NAME if you want your Ada subprogram name to be 
different than the HP C' subprogram name. 


F 11. Calling External Subprograms From Ada 11-21 







Note that the Ada compiler does not automatically convert 32-bit real 
parameters to 64-bit real parameters. See section “F 11.3.1.5 Real Types and 
HP C Subprograms” for details. 

Only scalar types (integer, floating point, character, Boolean, and enumeration 
types) and access types are allowed as result types for an external interfaced 
function subprogram written in HP C. 

When binding and linking Ada programs with interfaced subprograms written 
in HP C. the libraries libc.a libM.a, and libel.a are usually required. The 
Ada binder automatically provides the -1M -1c -lcl directives to the linker. 
You are not required to specify “-1M -lc -lcl” when binding and linking the 
Ada program on the ada(l) command line.

See section “F 11.1.1.1 Integer Types” for details. 

When passing integers by reference, note that an Ada SHORT.SHORT.INTEGER 
(eight bits) actually corresponds with the HP C type char, because C treats 
this type as a numeric type.

F 11.3.1.2 Enumeration Types and HP C Subprograms 

See section “F 11.1.1.2 Enumeration Types” for details. 

HP C enumeration types have the same representation as Ada enumeration 
types. They both are represented as unsigned integers beginning at zero. In 
HP C, the size of an enumeration type is always 32 bits. When HP C passes 
enumeration types as value parameters, the values are zero extended to 32 
bits. Because Ada also performs the zero extension to 32 bits for enumeration 
type values. th**y will be in the correct form for HP C subprograms. If a 
representation specification applies to the Ada enumeration type, the value 
specified by the representation clause (not the ’POS value) will be passed to the 
HP C routine.

F 11.3.1.3 Boolean Types and HP C Subprograms 

See section “F 11.1.1.3 Boolean Types” for details. 

Booleans are passed as other enumeration types are passed; see section 
“F 11.3.1.2 Enumeration Types and HP C Subprograms" for details. 

The type Boolean is not defined in HP C and the Ada representation of 
Booleans does not directly correspond to any type in HP C. However, an Ada 
Boolean could be represented in C with an appropriate two-valued enumeration 
type or with an HP C integer type. 

Boolean types are allowed for the result returned by an external interfaced 
subprogram written in HP C, when care is taken to observe the internal 
representation. 

F 11.3.1.4 Character Types and HP C Subprograms 

See section “F 11.1.1.4 Character Types” for details. 

The Ada predefined type CHARACTER and any of its subtypes correspond with 
the type char in HP C. Both the Ada and HP C types have the same internal 
representation and size. However, in Ada the type CHARACTER is constrained to 
be within the 128 character ASCII standard.

F 11.3.1.5 Real Types and HP C Subprograms 

This section discusses passing fixed point types and floating point types to 
HP C. 



Fixed Point Types 

Ada fixed point types are not supported as parameters or as results of external 
subprograms. Ada fixed point types cannot be returned as function results 
from interfaced subprograms written in HP C. 


Floating Point Types 

When HP C is operating in compatibility mode (non-ANSI mode), the 
default calling convention for passing parameters of floating point types by 
value requires that 32-bit single precision reals be converted to 64-bit double 
precision reals before being passed 

When HP C is operating in ANSI conformant mode (or in compatibility 
mode with the *r flag specified), 32-bit single precision reals are passed as 
parameters without being converted to 64-bit double precision. 

Consequently, an interface parameter of type FLOAT or of a type derived 
from a type whose base type is FLOAT, can only be passed directly to 
float parameters of HP C code compiled in ANSI conformant mode or in 
compatibility mode with *r specified. 

To interface with compatibility mode HP C code (no *r specified!, the 
Ada type LONG.FLOAT. or a type derived from a type whose base type is 
LONG.FLOAT, must be used for all parameters of HP C type float. 

This limitation on passing the Ada type FLOAT only applies to parameters 
tiiat are of the type FLOAT or derived from a type whose base type is FLOAT. 

A parameter of a composite type, such as an array or record, can have 
components that are of the type FLOAT. Also, the type FLOAT can be passed by

F 11.3.2 Access Types and HP C Subprograms 

See section “F 11.1.2 Access Types” for details. 

F 11.3.3 Array Types and HP C Subprograms 

See section “F 11.1.3 Array Types” for details. 

Note that, constrained Ada arrays with SH0RT_SH0RT_INTEGER or with 8-bit 
enumeration type components can be most conveniently associated with an HP 
C type of the form chart] or char *. 

In Ada, the predefined type STRING is an unconstrained array type. It is 
represented in memory as a sequence of consecutive characters without any 
gaps in between the characters. In HP C. the string type is represented as 
a sequence of characters that is terminated with an ASCII null character 
(\Q00). You will need to append a null character to the end of an Ada string 
if that string is to be sent to an external interfaced HP C subprogram. When 
retrieving the value of an HP C string object for use as an Ada string, you will 
need to dynamically allocate a copy of the HP C string. The HP C type char 
* is not compatible with the unconstrained array type STRING that is used by- 
Ada. 

The examples on the following pages illustrate the handling of strings in HP C- 
and in Ada. In the first example, an Ada string is passed to HP C. Note the 
need to explicitly add a null character to the end of the string so that string is 
in the form that HP C expects for character strings.

F 11.4 Calling HP FORTRAN 77 Language Subprograms 

When calling interfaced HP FORTRAN 77 subprograms, the following form is 
used: 

pragma INTERFACE(FQRTRAN, Adasubprogram-name) 

This form is used to identify the need for HP FORTRAN 77 parameter passing 
conventions. 

To call the HP FORTRAN 77 subroutine 

SUBROUTINE fsub (pans) 

INTEGER*4 parm 


END 

you need this interfaced subprogram declaration in Ada: 

procedure FSUB (PARM : in out INTEGER); 
pragma INTERFACE (FORTRAN, FSUB); 

The external name specified in the Ada interface declaration can be any Ada 
identifier. If the Ada identifier differs from the FORTRAN 77 subprogram 
name, pragma INTERFACE.NAME is required. 

Note that the parameter in the example above is of mode in out. In 
HP FORTRAN 77. all user-declared parameters are always passed by reference: 
therefore, mode in out or mode out must be used for scalar type parameters. 
The HP FORTRAN 7£ compiler might expect some implicit parameters that 
are passed by value and not by reference. See section “F 11.4.4 String Types 
and HP FORTRAN 77 Subprograms" for details. 

Only scalar types (integer, floating point, and character types) are allowed for 
the result returned by an external interfaced function subprogram written 
in HP FORTRAN 77. Access type results are not supported. For more 
information, see the following manuals:

F 11.4.1 Scalar Types and HP FORTRAN 77 Subprograms 

FORTRAN expects ail user-declared parameters to be passed by reference. 

Ada scalar type parameters will only be passed by reference if declared as 
mode in out or out; therefore, no scalar type parameters to a FORTRAN 
interface routine should be declared as mode in (except for certain implicit 
parameters; see section U F 11.4.4 String Types and HP FORTRAN 77 
Subprograms” for details.) No error will be reported by Ada, but you will most 
likely get unexpected results. 



F 11.4.1.1 Integer Types and HP FORTRAN 77 Subprograms 

See section "F 11.1.1.1 Integer Types" for details. 

See section “F 11.1.1 Scalar Types" for details. 

Table 11-3 summarizes the correspondence between integer types in Ada and 
HP FORTRAN 77.

Ada semantics do not allow parameters of mode in our to be passed to 
function subprograms. Therefore, for Ada to rail HP FORTRAN 77 external 
interfaced function subprograms, each scalar parameter s addiess must be 
passed. The use of the supplied package SYSTEM facilitates this passing of the

object's address. The parameters in an HP FORTRAN 77 external function 
must be declared as in the example below: 

with SYSTEM; 

VAL1 : INTEGER; --a scalar type 
VAL2 : FLOAT ; — a scalar type 
RESULT : INTEGER; 

function FTNFUNC (PARH1, PARM2 : SYSTEM.ADDRESS) return INTEGER; 
The external function must be called from within Ada as follows: 

RESULT := FTNFUNC (VAL1'ADDRESS. VAL2'ADDRESS); 


F 11.4.1.2 Enumeration Types and HP FORTRAN 77 Subprograms 

See sectior "F 11.1.1.2 Enumeration Types’’ for details. 

The HP FORTRAN 77 language does not support enumeration types. 
However, objects that are elements of an Ada enumeration type can be passed 
to an HP FORTRAN 77 integer type because the underlying representation 
of an enumeration type is an integer. The appropriate FORTRAN type 
(BYTE. INTEGER*2. or INTEGER*4) should be chosen to match the size of the 
Ada enumeration type. If a representation specification applies to the Ada 
enumeration type, the value specified by the representation clause (not the 
'POS value/ will be passed to the FORTRAN routine. 


11-34 F 11. Calling External Subprograms From Ada 






F 11.4.1.3 Boolean Types and HP FORTRAN 77 Subprograms 

See section “F 11.1.1.3 Boolean Types” for details. 

An Ada Boolean that has the default 8-bit size is compatible with the default 
mode HP FORTRAN 77 type LOGICAL* 1 both as a parameter and as a 
function result. 

An Ada Boolean type with a representation specification fcr a larger size (16 
or 32 bits) is not compatible with the larger sized HP FORTRAN 77 logical 
types (L0GICAL*2 or L0GICAL*4). Such Ada Booleans can be passed to the 
appropriately sized FORTRAN integer type (INTEGER*2 or INTEGER*4) and 
treated as integers that have the value of 'POS of the Ada Boolean value. 

If the HP FORTRAN 77 routine is compiled with one of the HP FORTRAN 77 
options that changes the size or representation of logical types to other 
than the default, you will have to determine what Ada types, if any. are 
compatible with the altered FORTRAN behavior by consulting the appropriate 
FORTRAN documentation.

F 11.4.1.4 Character Types and HP FORTRAN 77 Subprograms 

See section “F 11.1.1.4 Character Types'’ for details. 

There is no one-to-one mapping between an Ada character type and any 
HP FORTRAN 77 character type. An Ada character type can be passed to 
HP FORTRAN 77 or returned from HP FORTRAN 77 using one of several 
methods. 

HP FORTRAN 77 considers all single character parameters to be 
single-element character arrays. The method that HP FORTRAN 77 uses to 
pass character arrays is described in section “F 11.4.4 String Types and HP 
FORTRAN 77 Subprograms”. The method requires that an implicit value 
parameter be passed to indicate the size of the character array. Because HP 
FORTRAN 77 uses this method for passing character types, it might be more 
convenient to convert Ada character types into Ada strings and follow the rules 
that govern passing Ada string types to HP FORTRAN 77. 

An Ada character that has the default S-bit size can be passed to a default 
mode HP FORTRAN 77 parameter of type CHARACTER*!. This can be done 
if the interface declaration specifies the additional size parameters that 
HP FORTRAN 77 implicitly expects and passes the constant value one (the 
size of the character) when the HP FORTRAN 77 subprogram is called. See 
section “F 11.4.4 String Types and HP FORTRAN 77 Subprograms" for 
an example of implicit size parameter? for strings: to pass an Ada character 
instead of a string, simply use the Ada character type in the Ada interface 
declaration in place of the Ada string type and CHARACTER*! :n the HP 
FORTRAN 77 declaration .n place of the CHARACTER *(•). Note that the 
size parameter or parameters are not specified in the HP FORTRAN 77 
subprogram declaration: they are implicit parameters that are expected by the 
HP FORTRAN 77 subprogram for each character arrav (or character) tvpp 
parameter. 

An Ada character type that has the default size cannot be returned from an 
HP FORTRAN 77 function that has a result type of CHARACTER*l fit can be 
returned as a BYTE: ^ee below for details.). 

An Ada character type ilia' has the default S-bit size can also be passed to 
an HP FORTRAN 77 parameter of type BYTE without having to pass the 
additional length parameter. Th'> BYTE will have the value of ’ PQS of the Ada 
character value. 


11*36 F 11. Catling External Subprograms From Ada 





An Ada character type that has the default size can also be returned from an 
HP FORTRAN 77 function that has a return type of BYTE. The BYTE to be 
returned should be assigned the ’POS value of the desired Ada character. 

An Ada character type with a representation specification for a larger size (16 
or 32 bits) is not compatible with any HP FORTRAN 77 character type. Such 
Ada characters can be passed to the appropriately sized FORTRAN integer 
type (INTEGER*2 or INTEGER*4) and treated as integers that have the value of 
’POS of the Ada character value. 



F 11.4.1.5 Real Types and HP FORTRAN 77 Subprograms 

This section discusses passing fixed and floating point types to subprograms

F 11.4.2 Access Types and HP FORTRAN 77 Subprograms 

See section “F 11.1.2 Access Types’’ for details. 

Ada access types have no meaning in HP FORTRAN 77 subprograms because 
the types are address pointers to Ada objects. The implementation value of 
an Ada parameter of type ACCESS may be passed to an HP FORTRAN 77 
procedure. The parameter in HP FORTRAN 77 is seen as INTEGER*-!. 

The object pointed to by the access parameter has no significance in 
HP FORTRAN 77; the access parameter value itself would be useful only for 
comparison operations to other access values. 

HP FORTRAN 77 can return an INTEGER*4 and the Ada program can declare 
an access type as the returned value type (it will be a matching size because in 
Ada, an access type is a 32-bit quantity.) However, care should be taken that 
the returned value can actually be used by Ada in a meaningful maimer. 


11-38 F 11. Calling External Subprograms From Ada 






F 11.4.3 Array Types and HP FORTRAN 77 Subprograms 

See section “F 11.1.3 Array Types” for details. 

Arrays whose components have an HP FORTRAN 77 representation can be 
passed as parameters between Ada and interfaced external HP FORTRAN 77 
subprograms. For example. Ada arrays whose components are of types 
INTEGER, SHORT.INTEGER, FLOAT. LONG.FLOAT, or CHARACTER may be passed as 
parameters. 

Array tvpes cannnt be returned as function results from external 
HP FORTRAN 77 subprograms. However, an access type to the array type can 
be returned as a function result. 


Caution Arrays with multiple dimensions are implemented differently 

in Ada and HP FORTRAN 77. To obtain the same layout of 
components in memory as a given HP FORTRAN 77 array, the 
Ada equivalent must be declared and used with the dimensions 
in reverse order.

Consider the components of a 2-row by 3-column matrix, declared in 
HP FORTRAN 77 as 


INTEGERS a (2,3) 
or 

INTEGER»4 a(1:2,1:3) 

This array would be stored by HP FORTRAN 77 in the following order: 

a(l,l), a(2,l), a(l,2) , a(2,2). a(l,3), a(2,3) 

This is referred to as storing in column major order ; that is. the first subscript 
varies most rapidly, the second varies next most rapidly, and so forth, and the 
last varies least rapidly. 

Consider the components of a 2-row by 3-column matrix, declared in Ada as: 

A : array (1..2, 1..3) of INTEGER; 

This array would be stored by Ada in the following order: 

A(l.l), AC1.2), A(1,3), AC2.1). A(2,2), A(2.3) 

This is referred to as storing in row major order ; that is. the last subscript 
varies most rapidly, the next to Iasi varies next most rapidly, and so forth, 
while the first varies least rapidly. Clearly the two declarations in the different 
languages are not equivalent. Now. consider the components of a 2-row by 
3-column matrix, declared in Ada as: 

A : array (1..3, 1..2) of INTEGER; 

Note the reversed subscripts compared with the FORTRAN declaration. This 
arras would be stored by Ada in the following order: 

A(1 ,1) , A(l,2). A(2,1), A(2,2), A(3,l), A(3,2) 

If the subscripts are reversed, the layout would be 

A(l,l). A (2,1) , A(l.2). A (2.2) , Ad,3), A(2,3) 

which is identical to the HP FORTRAN 77 layout Thus, either of the 
language declarations couid declare its component indices in rceersc order to b 
compatible. 


11-40 F 11. Calling External Subprograms From Ada 







To illustrate that equivalent multi-dimensional arrays require a reversed order 
of dimensions in the declarations in HP FORTRAN 7? and Ada, consider the 
following: 

The Ada statement 

F00 : array (1..10,1..5,1..3) of FLOAT; 
is equivalent to the HP FORTRAN 77 declaration 
REAL*4 F00(3,5,10) 
or 

REAL*4 F0Q(1:3.1:5.1:10) 

Both Ada and HP FORTRAN 77 store a one-dimensional array as a linear list. 

F 11.4.4 String Types and HP FORTRAN 77 Subprograms 

When a string item is passed as an argument to an HP FORTRAN 77 
subroutine from within HP FORTRAN 77. extra information is transmitted 
in hidden (implicit) parameters. The calling sequence includes a hidden 
parameter (for each string) that is the actual length of the ASCII character 
sequence. This implicit parameter is passed in addition to the address of the 
ASCII character string. The hidden parameter is passed by value, not by 
reference. 

These conventions are different from those of Ada. For an Ada program to call 
an external interfaced subprogram written in HP FORTRAN 77 with a string 
type parameter, you must explicitly pass the length of the string object. The 
length must be declared as an Ada 32-bit integer parameter of mode in.

Returning A String From FORTRAN 

It is not possible to declare, in Ada, an external FORTRAN function 
that returns a result of type STRING (character*N or character*(*) in 
FORTRAN). However, such a FORTRAN function can be accessed from Ada 
by declaring the function to be an Ada procedure with two additional initial 
parameters. The first parameter should be declared as an out parameter of 
a constrained string type: the second parameter should be declared as an in 
parameter of type INTEGER. The string that is to hold ihe result is passed as 
the first parameter, and the length of that first parameter Ithe number of 
characters that FORTRAN can safely return in that first parameter string) is 
passed as the second parameter. 

If the maximum number of characters specified by the second parameter is 
greater than the number of characters in the string being returned as the 
FORTRAN function result, the Ada string will be padded with blanks out to 
the number of characters specified as the second parameter. If the maximum 
number of characters specified by the second parameter is less than the 
number of characters in the string being returned as the FORTRAN function 
result, only the number of characters specified as the second parameter will be 
returned in the Ada string.

The following Ada program calls a FORTRAN function that returns a STRING 
function result:

F 11.4.5 Record Types and HP FORTRAN 77 Subprograms 

See section “F 11.1.4 Record Types” for details. 

Ada records may be passed as parameters to external interfaced subprograms 
written in HP FORTRAN if care is taken regarding the record layout and 
access to record discriminant values. See section “F 4.S Record Types” for 
information on record type layout. 

Record types are not allowed as function results in HP FORTRAN' functions. 

F 11.4.6 Other FORTRAN Types 

The HP FORTRAN' 77 types COMPLEX, COMPLEX-8. DOUBLE COMPLEX, and 
COMPLEX* 16 have no direct counterparts in Ada. However, it is possible to 
declare equivalent types using either an Ada array or an Ada record type. For 
example, with type COMPLEX in HP FORTRAN 77. a simple Ada equivalent is a 
user-defined record: 

type COMPLEX is 
record 

Real : FLOAT; 

Imag : FLOAT; 
end record; 

Similarly, an HP FORTRAN 77 double complex number could be represented 
with the two record components declared as Ada type LQNC.FLDAT. 

While it is not possible to declare an Ada external function that returns the 
above record type, an Ada procedure can be declared with an out parameter 
of type COMPLEX. The Ada procedure would then need to interface with an 
HP FORTRAN 77 subroutine, which would pass the result back using an in 
out or out parameter.

F 11.5 Calling HP Pascal Language Subprograms 

When calling interfaced HP Pascal subprograms, the form 

pragma INTERFACE (Pascal, Adasubprogram.name) 

is used to identify the need to use the HP Pascal parameter passing 
conventions. 

To call the following HP Pascal subroutine 

module modp; 
export 

procedure p.subr (val.parm : integer; 

var ref.parm : integer); 

implement 

procedure p.subr (val.parm : integer; 

var ref.parm : integer); 

begin 

end; 
end. 

Ada would use the interfaced subprogram declaration: 

procedure P.SUB (VAL.PARAM : in INTEGER; 

REF.PARAM : in out INTEGER); 
pragma INTERFACE (Pascal, P.SUB); 

In the above example we provided the Ada subprogram identifier P.SUB to the 
pragma INTERFACE. 

Note that the parameter in the example, VAL.PARAM. must be of mode in 
to match the parameter definition for val.parm found in the HP Pascal 
subroutine. Likewise. REF.PARAM. must be of mode in out to correctly match 
the HP Pascal definition of var ref .parm. Also, note that the names for 
parameter- da not need to match exactly. However, the mode of access arid the 
data type must be correctly matched, but there is no compile-time or run-time 
check that can ensure that they match. It is your responsibility to ensure their 
correctness. 


11-46 F 11. Calling External Subprograms From Ada 







When Ada interfaces to HP Pascal, it refers to the HP Pascal procedure 
or function by the procedure or function name. In the above example, the 
pragma INTERFACE was sufficient to specify that name, although a pragma 
INTERFACE.NAME could also nave been used (and would be necessary if the 
name given to the Ada routine did not map correctly to the desired HP Pascal 
name). Because Ada uses only the HP Pascal procedure or function name, 
there is a difficulty if that name is not unique. 

The names of the procedures and functions declared within an HP Pascal 
module must be unique within a single module. A given module can only 
contain one procedure or function name (for example. FO0). but another 
module could also contain a procedure or function named F00. If a single 
program uses both modules, it is necessary to properly resolve references to 
F00. To properly resolve such references, procedure and function names in 
modules are qualified with the name of the module that contains them. This 
qualification is internal to the object file and is not accessible to user code. 

The linker (ld(l)) uses the qualification information to resolve references by 
HP Pascal code to identically named procedures or functions. 

This qualification mechanism poses a difficulty when attempting to interface 
Ada to HP Pascal because Ada can only specify the unqualified HP Pascal 
procedure or function name. There will be no difficulty if the HP Pascal 
procedure or function being called has a name that is unique within all the 
HP Pascal modules used m the Ada program <if the qualification mechanism 
is not needed for the name). If the procedure or function name is not unique, 
the linker {Id Cl)) will, without producing an error or warning, select one 
(usually the first one) of the multiple HP Pascal procedures or functions that 
it encounters during the link that has the name specified by Ada. As this 
unpredictable selection is likely to lead to an incorrect program, interfacing 
to HP Pascal procedures or functions that are not uniquelv named is not 
recommended. 

For more information on Pascal interfacing, see the HP Pasral/H P-I'X 
Reference Manual Additional information is available in the HP-UX 
Portability Guide. 

For Pascal, scalar and access parameters of mode in are pas-^d by value:

Only scalar types (integer, floating point, character, Boolean, and enumeration 
tvpes) and access types are allowed for the result returned by an external 
interfaced Pascal function subprograms.

Note In HP Pascal, any integer subrange that has a negative lower 

bound is always implemented in 32 bits. Integer subranges 
with a non-negative lower bound are implemented in 8-bits if 
the upper bound is 255 or less, in 16-bits if the upper bound 
is 65535 or less, and in 32-bits if the upper bound is greater 
than 65535. Therefore, in table Table 11-4, the user-defined 
subrange 0 . .. 255 is shown as the HP Pascal equivalent to the 
Ada type SHORT,SHORT.INTEGER; however, the Ada type is a 
signed type with the range -128..127. To convert the unsigned 
value back to a signed value in HP Pascal, if the unsigned value 
is greater than 127, you will need to subtract 256 to obtain the 
actual negative value. 



Whether passed from Ada to HP Pascal by value or by reference, the 
appropriate HP Pascal type, as shown in Table 11-4. must be used to properiy 
access the Ada integer value from HP Pascal. 

All Ada integer types are allowed for the result returned by an external 
interfaced subprogram written in HP Pascal if care is taken with respect to 
ranges defined for integer quantities.

F 11.5.1.2 Enumeration Types and HP Pascal Subprograms 

See section “F 11.1.1.2 Enumeration Types” for details. 

Ada and HP Pascal have similar implementations of enumeration types. In 
Ada and HP Pascal, enumeration types can have a size of 8, 16, or 32 bits. 
However, Ada normally considers enumeration types to be signed quantities 
and HP Pascal considers them to be unsigned. Table 11-5 shows corresponding 
enumeration types in Ada and HP Pascal.

> 65536 elements 

32 


If the Ada enumeration type has 129 through 256 elements or 32769 through 
65536 elements, there are additional requirement to passing or returning values 
of such an Ada type. A size specification on a representation clause for the 
Ada enumeration type should be used to specify the minimum size for the 
enumeration type (see section F 4 1 for details.) When such a size is used and 
none of the internal codes are negative integers, the internal representation 
of the Ada type will be unsigned and wiii conform with the HP Pascal 
representation. 


11-50 F 11. Calling Externa! Subprograms From Ada 





If such a size specification representation clause is not used, it is still possible 
to pass a simple variable or expression of such a type to HP Pascal, by value 
or reference, or to return one from HP Pascal. Although the Ada enumeration 
object is stored in a larger container than HP Pascal expects, the valid values 
are actually all stored within the part of the container that HP Pascal will 
access. 

However, unless a size specification representation clause is used, there will be 
difficulty passing arrays of Ada enumeration values of such types or passing 
records containing fields of such types. HP Pascal will not properly access the 
correct elements of such arrays or fields of such records because it will assume 
the enumeration values to be smaller than they actually are and therefore will 
compute their location incorrectly. 

If a representation specification is applied to the Ada enumeration ryoe to 
alter the internal value of any enumeration elements, care must be taken 
that the values are within the HP Pascal enumeration type to which the Ada 
enumeration value is being passed 

Ada supports the return of a function result that is an enumeration type from 
an external interfaced function subprogram written in HP Pascal.

F 11.5.3 Array Types and HP Pascal Subprograms 

See section “F 11.1.3 Array Types” for details. 

Arrays with components with the same representation have the same 
representation in Ada and HP Pascal. 

Arrays cannot be passed by value from Ada to HP Pascal. An Ada array can 
only be passed to a VAR parameter in an HP Pascal subprogram. 

Array types cannot be returned as function results from external interfaced 
subprograms written in HP Pascal. 

Pascal conformant array parameters passed by reference (VAR) can be passed 
from Ada to Pascal. To pass such parameters, additional implicit parameters 
expected by Pascal must be added in the Ada declaration of the Pascal 
procedure or function. For each dimension, except the last dimension, these 
additional parameters are the bounds of the arrav followed by the size of the 
array elements in bytes and they must immediately follow the conformant array 
parameter or parameters. The bounds and element size parameters must be 
declared as in parameters of an integer or enumeration type. 

When more than one conformant array parameter is declared in a 
comma-separated formal parameter list in a Pascal procedure or function 
heading, all the actual parameters passed to the formal? in that list must have 
the same number of dimensions and the same lower and upper index bound in 
each dimension. Therefore, only one set of implicit bound parameters is needed 
for the two formal parameters A and B in the following example (no element 
size is passed to A and B because the> have only one dimension). The actual 
parameters passed to the formal A and B parameters must have the same index 
hounds. 



F 11. Calling External Subprograms From Ada 11-53 




11 


Note that two sets of implicit bound parameters and one element size 
parameter are needed for the two-dimensional conformant array formal 
parameter C (one set of bounds for each dimension and an element size for the 
second dimension). If there are additional two-dimensional conformant array 
parameters, and they are all declared in the same comma-separated parameter 
list in Pascal (with the C parameter), only the two sets of implicit bound 
parameters and the one element size parameter is required for the entire list. 
For example, if the Pascal function heading is 

function VectorThing 

(VAR a.b: ARRAY [i..j: INTEGER] of INTEGER; 

VAR c : ARRAY [p..q: INTEGER] of ARRAY [r..s: INTEGER] 
of INTEGER) : INTEGER; 


11-54 F 11. Calling External Subprograms From Ada 





The Ada declaration to call such a Pascal function follows: 


with SYSTEM; 

procedure PASCAL.CONFORM.FUNC is 

type VECTOR is array (INTEGER range -492..+S00) 

of INTEGER range -100..+100; 

type VECT0R2 is array (INTEGER range 1..10) of VECTOR;

F 11.5.4 String Types and HP Pascal Subprograms 

See section F 11.1.3 for details. 

Passing variable length strings between Ada and HP Pascal is supported 
with some restrictions. Strings cannot be passed by value from Ada to HP 
Pascal. An Ada string can only be passed to a VAR parameter in an HP Pascal 
subprogram. 

String types cannot be returned as function results from external HP Pascal 
subprograms. 

Although there is a difference in the implementation of the type STRING in the 
two languages, with suitable declarations you can create compatible types to 
allow the passing of both Ada strings and HP Pascal strings. An Ada string 
corresponds essentially to a packed array of characters in Pascal. However, 
the Ada string type must be one character longer than the corresponding 
string type in the HP Pascal procedure or function. HP Pascal adds such an 
implicit extra byte to its ow n paoced arrays of characters and expects to be 
able to utilize this extra byte during some string operations. The following 
example illustrates the declaration of compatible types for passing an Ada 
string between an Ada program and an HP Pascal subprogram. 

HP Pascal subprogram: 

(* passing an Ada STRING type to an HP Pascal routine «) 

module p; 

export 

type stringSO - packed array [1..80] of char; 
procedure exl ( var s : string80; len : integer );

procedure exl; 
begin 

... (* update/use the Ada string as a PAC *) 
end; 
end.

An HP Pascal STRING type corresponds to a record in Ada that contains 
two fields: a 32-bit integer field containing the string length and an Ada 
STRING field containing the string value. The following example illustrates the 
declaration of compatible types for passing an HP Pascal string between an 
Ada program and a Pascal subprogram.

F 11.7 Potential Problems Using Interfaced Subprograms 


F 11.7.1. Signals and Interfaced Subprograms 

The Ada run-time on the HP 9000 Series 600, 700, and 800 computeis 
uses signals in a manner that generally does not interfere with interfaced 
subprograms. However, some HP-UX routines are interruptible by signals. 
These routines, if called from within interfaced external subprograms, may 
create problems. You need to be aware of these potential problems when 
writing external interfaced subprograms in other languages that will be called 
from within an Ada main subprogram. See sigvector(2) in the HP-UX 
Reference for a complete explanation of interpretabilitv of operating system 
routines. 

The following should be taken into consideration: 

■ SIGALRM is sent when a delay statement reaches the end of the specified 
interval. 

■ One of SIGALRM. SIGVTALRM (the default), or SIGPRQF is sent periodically 
when time-slicing is enabled in a tasking program. 

■ Interruptible HP-UX routines (see sigvector(2)) may need to be 
protected from interruption by the signals used by the Ada run-time 
system. The SYSTEM.ENVIRONMENT routines SUSPEND.ADA.TASKING and 
RESUME.ADA.TASKING can be used to implement uns protection. As 

an alternative, the knowledgeable user can use the sigseunask(2) or 
sigblock(2) mechanism to implement the same protection. 

■ If a signal is received while it is blocked, one instance of the signal is 
guaranteed to remain pending and will be honored when the signal is 
unblocked. Any additional instances of the signal will be lost. 

■ Any signals blocked in interfaced code should be unblocked before leaving the 
interfaced code. 


11-64 F 11. Calling External Subprograms From Ada 





The alarm signals sent by delay statements and sent to implement time-slicing 
(noted above) are the most likely signals to cause problems with interfaced 
subprograms. These signals are asynchronous; that is, they can occur at any 
time and are not caused by the code that is executing at the time they occur. 
In addition, SIGALRM and SIGPROF (but not SIGVTALRM) can interrupt HP-UX 
routines that are sensitive to being interrupted by signals. 

Problems can arise if an interfaced subprogram initiates a ‘‘slow" operating 
system function that can be interrupted by a signal (for example, a read(2) 
call on a terminal device or a wait(2) call that waits for a child process to 
complete). Problems can also arise if an interfaced subprogram can be called 
by more than one task and is not reentrant. If an Ada reserved signal occurs 
during such an operation or non-reentrant region, the program may function 
erroneously. 

For example, an Ada program that uses delay statements and tasking 
constructs causes the generation of SIGALRM and optionally eh her SIGVTALRM 
or SIGPROF. If an intefaced subprogram needs to perform a potentially 
interruptible system call or if the interfaced subprogram can be called from 
more than one task and is not reentrant, you can protect the interfaced 
subprogram by blocking the potentially interrupting time signals around ’.he 
system call or non-reentrant region. If one of these timer signals does occur 
while Hocked, signifying either the end of a delay period or tlie need to 
reschedule due to time-slice exp'ration. that signal is not lost: it is effectively 
deferred until it is Inter unblocked. 


F 11. Catling External Subprograms From Ada 11-65 






Assuming a tasking program, which contains one or more delay statements, 
with time-slicing enabled using the default time-slicing signal (SIGVTALRM), the 
following example shows a protected read(2) call in the C language: 


•include <signal.h> 
void interface_rout(); 

long mask; 


/* Add SIGALRM and SIGVTALRM to the list of currently 
blocked signals (see sigblock(2)). */ 

mcsk * sigblock (sigmask (SIGALRM) 1 sigmask (SIGVTALRM)); 

read (...); /* or non-reentrant region */ 

/* restore old mask so Ada run-time can function */ 
sigsetmask (mask); 



11-66 F 11. Calling External Subprograms From Ada 





If any Ada reserved signal other than SIGALRM or the alarm signal (if any) 
being used for time-slicing is to be similarly blocked, SIGALRM and the alarm 
signal used for time-slicing must already be blocked or must be blocked at the 
same time as the other signal or signals. 

Any Ada reserved signal blocked in interfaced code should be unblocked before 
leaving that code, or as soon as possible thereafter, to avoid unnecessarily- 
stalling the Ada run-time executive. Failure to follow these guidelines will 
cause improper delay or tasking operation. 

An alternative and preferred method of protecting interfaced code from signals 
is described in the Ada User’s Guide in the section on “Execution-Time 
Topics.’’ The two procedures SUSPEND_ADA_TASKING and RESUME_ADA_7ASKING 
from the package SYSTEM.ENVIRONME.VT supplied by Hewlett-Packard can be 
used within an Ada program to surround a critical section of Ada code or a call 
to external interfaced subprogram code with a critical section. 


F 11.7.2 Files Opened by Ada and Interfaced Subprograms 

An interfaced subprogram should nc‘ attempt to perform I/O operations 
on files opened bv Ada. Your program should not use HP-UX I/O utilities 
intermixed with Ada I/O routines on the same file If it is necessary to perform 
I/O operations in interfaced subprograms using the HP-UX utilities, open and 
close those files with HP-UX utilities.

F 12. Interrupt Entries 


This chapter describes interrupt entry processing. 


F 12.1 Introduction 

The Ada compiler supports a limited form of interrupt entries as defined by 

the Ada RM , section 13.0.1. In addition, the compiler provides the following 

features: 

a Interrupt entries are associated with HP-UX signals, but are not directly 
invoked by an HP-UX signal. Instead, the interrupt entry is called from 
an Ada signal handling procedure. An Ada signal handling procedure can 
1 » associated with one or more HP-UX signals. If an Ada signal handler 
wants to call an interrupt entry, it can only call the interrupt entry that is 
associated with the same HP-UX signal that caused the Ada signal handler 
itself to be invoked. 

a Interrupt entries associated with HP-LX signals can have parameters. 

• If the interrupt entry call cannot be processed immediately by the server 
task, the interrupt entry parameters are buffered so that the interrupt is not 
lost and the entry is processed as soon as conditions permit. 

■ All sicnal? except the ones reserved by the Ada runtime and the HP-UX 
system can be handled with up to seven different priorities. The interrupt 
entf. mechanism will riot prohibit the use of signals reserved h\ the Ada 
runtime or in HP-UX. but using such signal' for interrupt entries w.li cause 
unpredictable program behavior. 


F 12. Interrupt Entries 12-1 




F 12.2 Immediate Processing 

If an Ada handler has been associated with an HP-UX signal, when that 
signal occurs, an internal signal handler installed by the runtime system 
is entered. That internal handler then calls the user-defined Ada handler. 

One parameter of type SYSTEM. ADDRESS is passed to the user handler; the 
parameter is the “signal number’’ that caused it to be invoked (a function is 
provided to convert the integer representation of a “signal number” into an 
object of type SYSTEM .ADDRESS). The Ada handler can make an entry call to 
a task entry associated with the particular signal and/or it can update global 
state information (for example, variables) that is meaningful to the program. 

It should then return, giving control to the internal handler in the runtime 
system. 

If the Ada handler makes an entry call to an entry previously declared with 
a representation clause as an interrupt entry, the rendezvous does not occur 
immediately. The kernel saves the parameters passed by the signal handler in a 
buffer taken from a pool of free buffers and links the buffer to the entry queue 
for the interrupt. The actual rendezvous will take place in deferred processing 
(see section “F 12.3 Deferred Processing"). The pool of free buffers is allocated 
or.ce at the program startup by calling INIT_INTERRUPT_MANAGER with the 
number of buffers specified (see section “F 12.5 Initializing the Interrupt Entry 
Mechanism"). 


Note The Ada handier must not call any Ada Runtime System 

routines and must be compiled with checks off. See sections 
“F 12.G Associating an Ada Handler with an HP-UX Signal” 
and “F 12.6.1 Determining If Your Ada Handler Makes Ada 
Runtime Calls” for details. 


12-2 F 12. Interrupt Entries 




F 12.3 Deferred Processing 

The deferred processing step is the execution of the accept statement for the 
interrupt entry. It is performed with signals enabled and with an Ada task 
priority specified by the user (but higher than any software priority as required 
by the Ada RM , section 13.5.1.2). The accept statement has access to the IN 
parameters provided by the Ada handler when the Ada handler made the entry 
call. There are no limitations on the code of the accept statement; run-time 
calls are allowed. 

The connection between the immediate and deferred processing is made by 
the Ada runtime. At the end of the immediate processing step, when the 
Ada handler returns control to the internal handler in the Ada runtime. Ada 
runtime checks to see if any immediate processing steps remain active (that is. 
an Ada signal handler has been called in response to a signal but has not yet 
returned). If any immediate processing steps remain active, the Ada runtime 
simply returns control to the interrupted context, which will be one of the 
currently active Ada signal handlers. 

If no immediate processing steps remain active (that is, the Ada signal handler 
that is currently returning control to the Ada runtime is the only currently 
active Ada signal handler), the Ada runtime identifies all of the tasks and 
entries that immediate processing steps have requested be called. There may 
be more than one interrupt entry call pending because multiple different 
signals may have been received, causing multiple Ada signal handlers to be 
simultaneously active. Only when the last active Ada signal handler returns 
control to the Ada runtime will the pending tasks or entries be considered as 
callable. The Ada runtime will determine for each pending interrupt entry- 
call whether the accept statement can be executed immediately. If so. the 
current task is preempted unless it is of equal or higher priority than any of the 
pending interrupt entry calls (for example, the current task is itself executing 
an accept statement for a higher priority interrupt). Pending interrupt entry- 
calls for which the accept can be executed, but which *e of a lover pr.ority 
than the currently running task, will be made as th**ir priority p< : niit> note 
that calls to interrupt entries with identical priorities may occur in an arbitrary 
order i. 

If the accept statement, cannot be executed immediately, the rendezvous will 
take place according to normal Ada semantics when the server ta^k executes an 
accept or select statement for the given entry. 


F 12. Interrupt Entries 12-3 






There are no restrictions on the number of interrupt entries one task can use, 
nor on the number of tasks that can use interrupt entries. The only restriction 
is that only one entry may be associated with a given HP-UX signal and that 
signals reserved by the Ada runtime may not be associated with an interrupt 
entry. 

The buffering of the interrupt entry call from the Ada handler to the interrupt 
entry attempts to ensure that no signal will be lost. It is important that the 
average execution time of the interrupt entry be smaller than the signal rate 
for the associated signal, otherwise the pool of buffers to hold interrupt entry 
parameters will be quickly exhausted. Each buffer is released immediately 
before execution of the accept body for the interrupt entry after the parameters 
have been copied to the stack of the acceptor task. It is also important that 
the execution time of the Ada signal handlers be minimized as the deferred 
processing step is not performed when any Ada signal handler remains active. 


F 12.4 Handling an Interrupt Entirely in the Immediate 
Processing Step 

Calling an interrupt entry in response to a signal is optional. Interrupts can 
be handled in a sequential program that lias no tasks to call or in a tasking 
program without calling an interrupt entry if the Ada handler performs all the 
required processing. This can improve performance because the overhead of 
task switching is avoided. However, because the Ada handler cannot make Ada 
run-time calls and must be compiled with checks off (using the -R option), the 
amount of processing that an Ada handler can do is limited. In addition, if 
the Ada handler does all the processing, the Ada program must generally poll 
global state information to determine that the signal has been received. 


12-4 F 12. interrupt Entries 




F 12.5 Initializing the Interrupt Entry Mechanism 

The compiler provides the package INTERRUPT.MANAGER to support interrupt 
entries. This package is in the predefined library. 

To use interrupt entries, you must initialize the interrupt manager by calling 
this procedure: 

procedure INIT.INTERRUPT.MANAGER 

(NUMBER.OF_BUFFERS : in BUFFER.NUMBER; 

MAX.PARAM.AREA.SIZE : in BYTE.SIZE; 

INTERRUPT.STACK.SIZE : in BYTE.SIZE :* 2048); 

This procedure allocates the given number of buffers to hold parameters of 
interrupt entries that cannot be processed immediately and allocates a signal 
stack of the given size. The size of each buffer is the maximum parameter area 
size specified to the call, plus a fixed overhead of 2? bytes used by the Ada 
runtime. If the given signal stack size is zero, all signals are handled on the 
current slack; therefore, all stacks must have sufficient buffer space. Using an 
interrupt stack allows better usage of available memory. 

The MAX.PARAM.AREA.SIZE parameter must be the size, in storage units, of 
the largest parameter block required by an interrupt entry call. A parameter 
block is an area of memory in which the generated code for a task entry call 
temporarily stores the actual parameters of the task entry call. The address of 
the parameter block is passed to the Ada run-time routine ENTRY.CALL which 
makes the parameters available to the called task entry when the rendezvous 
actually occurs. In the case of an interrupt entry, the Ada runtime copies the 
parameter block into one of the buffers allocated by INIT.INTERRUPT.MANAGER 
until the deferred processing step is reached. 


F 12. Interrupt Entries 12-5 




The parameter block sizes for the task entries to be called by Ada signal 
handling procedures can be obtained by compiling the specifications of the task 
for such entries with the -H option. An informational message is produced 
indicating the parameter block size for each task entry specification that has 
an address clause, indicating it is a candidate for calling from an Ada signal 
handling procedure. 

The procedure INIT.INTERRUPT.MANAGER must be called at program startup 
before any call is made to an interrupt entry from an Ada signal handler. 

Entry calls will be lost if the number of buffers is insufficient. The required 
number of buffers depends on the frequency of signals. A zero number of 
buffers can be used when the signal handier only buffers information and never 
calls an interrupt entry. 

This procedure raises STORAGE.ERRCR if there is not enough memory to allocate 
the required buffers and the interrupt stack. 


12-6 F 12. Interrupt Entries 






F 12.6 Associating an Ada Handler with an HP-UX Signal 

You can install a signal handler by calling the following procedure: 

procedure INSTALL.HANDLER 

(HANDLER.ADDRESS : in SYSTEM.ADDRESS; 

SIG : in SYSTEM.ADDRESS; 

PRIORITY : in INTERRUPT.PRIORITY 

:* INTERRUPT.PRIORITY’FIRST; 

ORIGINAL.HANDLER : in ACTION := REPLACED); 

This procedure installs an Ada routine, specified via HANDLER.ADDRESS, as the 
Ada handler for the specified HP-UX signal (SIG) after saving the address 
of the original handler. If the Ada handler calls an interrupt task entry, the 
signal number passed to this procedure as SIG must be the same as the one 
specified in the interrupt entry address clause (see **F 12.10 Address Clauses 
for Entries*’) for that task entry. The PRIORITY parameter specifies the priority 
of the entry call to be made by the handler (all accept statements will run 
with this priority unless they are themselves within an accept statement 
executed at higher priority.) The ORIGINAL.HANDLER parameter controls 
whether the current signal handler, the one the Ada handler is replacing, is to 
be called before (FIRST) or after (LAST) the new Ada handler or not called at 
all ( REPLACED). 

The INSTALL.HANDLER procedure must be called from a scope that encloses the 
declaration of the Ada procedure that is being installed as the Ada handler. 

A convenient technique is to declare the Ada handler procedure immediately 
within a library level package and place the cal! to INSTALL.HANDLER in 
the package body block. INSTALL.HANDLER will not detect any error if this 
restriction is violated: however, unexpected prosram behavior or program 
failure may occur when an incorrectly installed Ada handler is invoked. 

The Ada handler must be a procedure with one parameter of type 
SYSTEM.ADDRESS and without inner units The procedure can only reference 
local or aiobal objects, excluding objects of an enclosin'! frame, and must be 
compiled with checks off (using the -P. op’ion). If an entry call is made in an 
Ada handler, the task the entry belong to must b*> a cloba! object. 

The Ada handler must not call any Ada Runtime System routines (either 
explicitly or implicitly) other than simple entry calls to interrupt entries 
because >ome of the Ada run-time routines update critical run-time data 


F 12. Interrupt Entries 12*7 






structures and must not be reentered during such updates. Specifically, neither 
timed nor conditional entry calls may be made. 

The Ada handler must not call HP-UX routines or other non-Ada code, either 
via pragma INTERFACE or via a binding. 

If the Ada handler calls another Ada procedure or function, that procedure or 
function must follow these same constraints. 

For certain complex data structures, the compiler produces Type Support 
Subprograms (TSS). These subprograms perform actions such as initializing 
record fields, comparing records, changing record representation, and so on. 
The compiler then adds implicit calls to these routines when needed. Some 
calls to TSS routines are not safe in Ada handlers. If the TSS calls Ada 
Runtime System routines, that TSS should not be called from an Ada handler. 
To remove the call, you have to simplify the code so that the action that needs 
the call is no longer present. The -H option, if used when compiling the Ada 
handler, causes an informational message to be produced if the generated code 
contains a call to one or more TSS routines. Additionally, the massages specify 
the type that the TSS supports. 

In general, the code in an Ada handler should be kept extremely simple. It is 
recommended to only set a global flag or make an entry call to an interrupt 
entry to actually do the required processing. 

The HP-UX signal currently being handled is masked for the duration of the 
Ada handler. 

The address of the Ada procedure to use as the Ada handler can be obtained 
by the ’ADDRESS attribute, which is only valid after elaboration of the 
procedure body. 

The procedure INSTALL.HANDLER raises STORAGE.ERROR if MAX.HANDLERS 
handlers have already been defined. 


12-8 F 12. Interrupt Entries 






F 12.6.1 Determining If Your Ada Handler Makes Ada Runtime Calls 

If you are not sure your Ada handler makes specific Ada Runtime System 
routine calls, you can compile the Ada source file containing the Ada handler 
with the -H option. The -H option causes the compiler to produce a warning 
message each time it generates code to call an Ada Runtime System routine. 

If you generate a complete compiler listing with the -B or -L options, the 
warnings appear in the compiler listing at the appropriate source lines. If you 
do not generate a complete compiler listing (with -B or -L options), only the 
source lines that apply to the warning appear in a listing with the warning. 
Check the names of the Ada Runtime System routines that appear in the 
warning messages; if cn.^s to any of the following Ada Runtime System routines 
appear, your Ada handler is “unsafe”.

A call to ENTRY.CALL is safe as long as it is calling the task entry declared as 
an interrupt entry for the HP-UX signal that caused the Ada signal handler to 
be invoked. 

To help you understand what Ada language construct might cause such a call 
to be made, a description of each cf the above Ada run-time routines is listed 
in section “F 12.13 Ada Runtime Routine Descriptions’ - .

F 12.7 Disassociating an Ada Handler from 
an HP-UX Signal 

The Ada handler for a given HP-UX signal can be removed and the original 
HP-UX signal handler (or signal behavior) restored with this procedure 

procedure REMOVE.HANDLER (SIG : in SYSTEM.ADDRESS); 

This procedure only needs to be called when it is no longer necessary to 
have a handler for a particular signal. All Ada handlers are automatically 
disassociated from their HP-UX signals when the main program terminates. 

The procedure REMQVE.HANDLER raises PROGRAM.ERROR if no handler has been 
installed for the given signal. 


F 12.8 Determining How Many Handlers are Installed 

Use the following procedure to determine how many handlers have already 
been installed: 

function HANDLER.COUNT return HANDLER.NUMBER; 


F 12.9 When Ada Signal Handlers Will Not Be Called 

When the procedure SYSTEM.ENVIRONMENT. SUSPEND. ADA .TASKING is called, 
the HP-UX signals for which Ada signal handlers have been installed, 
will be masked. That is. the Ada signal handlers will not be called if 
one of the signals should occur. At most one instance of any giv en signal 
will be remembered while the signals are masked. When the procedure 
SYSTEM.ENVIRONMENT.RESUME.ADA.TASKING Is called, the signals for which Ada 
siurial handlers have been installed will be unmasked. Any signal that occurred 
while the masking was in effect will then lie delivered to the Ada program and 
will invoke ilie associated Ada signal handler? (at most one instance of any 
such signal will have been remembered while the signals were marked t. 


F 12. Interrupt Entries 12-11 





Caution The Ada program, as well as interface code called by the Ada 
program, should not unmask any of the HP-UX signals for 
which Ada signal handlers are installed while Ada tasking has 
been suspended. Doing so will cause unpredictable and possibly 
erroneous program behavior. 


F 12.10 Address Clauses for Entries 

According to section 13.5.1 of the Ada RM , an address clause for an interrupt 
entry has the following form: 

task INTERRUPT.HANDLER is 
entry INTERRUPTS . . . ) ; 
for INTERRUPT use at ...; 
end INTERRUPT.HANDLER: 

An interrupt entry may have zero or more parameters of mode IN. Parameters 
of mode IN OUT or OUT are not permitted: see section 13.5.1(1) in the Ada 
RM for details. The expression in the address clause must be of type 
SYSTEM. ADDRESS and is interpreted as a signal number by the runtime system. 
A function SIGNAL is provided by the INTERRUPT.MANAGER package to convert 
an integer to a SYSTEM. ADDRESS. Note that a with statement for the package 
SYSTEM must be specified for the context in which such an address clause 
appears.

F 12.11 Example of Interrupt Entries 

The following is a program that uses interrupt entries. The program could 
be written using only Ada tasking and not using HP-UX signals or interrupt 
entries; however, this version provides a sample of declaring and using the 
interrupt entry mechanism. A machine readable copy of this program is 
provided in $ADA_PATH/samples/intent/intentexl.ada (although the text 
and line breaks are different).

-- floor to floor. 

-- There are three tasks : PASSENGER, ELEVATOR and MANAGER. 

-- The MANAGER task manages the elevator by determining the floor 

— number and the direction to go. The PASSENGER task generates 

— passengers and sends a signal to the ELEVATOR task. The 

— ELEVATOR loads and unloads passengers and sends a signal back 
-- to the PASSENGER task after loading new arrivals or placing 
-- them in a queue (the elevator has a maximum capacity, the

— hold the parameters of interrupt entry calls that cannot be 

— processed immediately, and allocates a signal stack of the 
-- given size The size of each buffer is the maximum 

-- parameter area size plus a fixed overhead of 28 bytes used 
-- by the Ada runtime. If the given signal stack size is zero, 
-- all signals are handled on the current stack, and all stacks 

— must then have sufficient buffer space. 

-- This procedure must be called before any Ada signal handler 
-- can be installed and hence before any interrupt entry call 
-- can be made from an Ada signal handler. Signals can be 
-- lost if the number of buffers is insufficient. The number 
-- of buffers required depends on the frequency of signals. 

-- The number of buffers can be specified as zero if all Ada 
-- signal handlers completely handle their signal and never 
-- call ar. interrupt entry.

-- This procedure installs the Ada routine at the specified

-- entry calls made by the handler (all accept statements will 

— run with this priority). 

— The address of the Ada signal handler can be obtained with 
-- the attribute ’ADDRESS (which is only valid after 

— elaboration of the procedure body). The Ada signal handler 
-- receives control with the signal it is handling blocked, but 
-- other non-reserved signals are only blocked if they have an 
-- Ada signal handler routine and it is currently active (has 
-- been called in response to the signal but has not yet 

-- returned). The Ada signal handler must not make implicit 
-- or explicit calls to the Ada runtime, other than a simple 
-- entry call to the interrupt entry with the address clause 
-- corresponding to the signal being handled. Neither timed 

— nor conditional entry calls may be made from an Ada signal 

— handler. 

-- The Ada signal handler must be a procedure with one 
-- parameter of type ADDRESS, and without inner units. The
