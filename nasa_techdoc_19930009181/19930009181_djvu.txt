PREFACE 



Four material coatings of different thicknesses were flown on the LDEF to determine their ability to 
perform in the harsh space environment. The coatings, located in the ram direction of the spacecraft, 
were exposed for 10 months to the low-Earth orbit (LEO) environment experienced by the LDEF at 
an orbit of 260 nautical miles. They consisted of: Indium Oxide (ln 2 3 ), Silicon Oxide (SiO x ), clear 
RTV silicone, and Silicone with Silicate-treated Zinc Oxide (ZnO). These coatings were flown to 
assess their behavior when exposed to atomic oxygen and to confirm their good radiative properties, 
stability, electrical conductivity, and resistance to UV exposure. 

The flown samples were checked and compared with the reference unflown samples using high- 
magnification optical inspection, ESCA analysis, weight changes and dimensional changes. These 
comparisons indicated the following. 

The 1000A SiO x coating eroded uniformly, with minor changes in its radiative properties. The 100A 
of ln 2 3 coating eroded completely down to the Kapton® backing, with resultant losses of reflec- 
tance. The RTV-615 showed erosion, with carbon (C) content losses, while the Si remained con- 
stant, with a doubling of the oxygen (O) concentration. The RTV-615 silicone with K 2 Si0 3 -treated 
ZnO changed from flat to glossy white in appearance. It lost C, was etched, and increased its O 
content. The upper layers showed no remaining Zn or K. Losses of reflectance occurred within 
certain wavelength bands. 

It was not possible to evaluate the experimental oxygen reaction rate using the calculated atomic 
oxygen fluence of 2.6 x 10 20 atoms/cm 2 for the exposure of these coatings during the flight. The 
bakeout of the coatings was not canied out prior to the flight. Hence, the coating weight and dimen- 
sional losses included losses by outgassing products.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Four coating samples prepared by the Materials Branch at GSFC were flown on the Long 
Duration Exposure Flight (LDEF) spacecraft, launched in 1984. The samples were 
mounted with many others in the Experiment Environmental Control Canister (EECC). 
The canister was identified as Experiment No. S0010, and was located in Tray B9, which 
was situated at an angle of 8.1° from the ram vector, as shown in Figure 1. The assembly 
of the test specimens in the flight canister and in the control canister was managed by 
NASA's Langley Research Center (LaRC). 

The flight canister, shown in Figure 2, was provided with a drawer that opened and 
closed on command to expose the samples to the space environment while in flight. The 
container provided a clean, low-pressure inert gas environment while closed. A timer 
opened and exposed the samples 1 month after launch, and remained open for 10 months, 
at which time the drawer returned to the closed position to protect the samples during the 
remainder of the mission. The hermeticity of the drawer and canister was reconfirmed on 
the LDEF return, some 5 1/2 years after launch. 

Table 1 shows the environmental exposure conditions as reported in Reference 1. The 
atomic oxygen fluence for the spacecraft (particularly for Row 9) and other data on the 
space environment are shown in Figures 3 and 4, taken from Reference 2. 

For the 10-month exposure at an altitude of 260 nautical miles, the oxygen fluence is 
estimated to have been (from Figure 3 of the above reference) 2.6 x 10 20 atoms/cm 2 . The 
UV radiation exposure was 126,000 hours, as indicated in Table L The other environ- 
mental parameters are given in Table 1. 

The four samples were located on the tray in the same row that included samples from the 
GSFC Optics Branch. Those samples consisted of various metallic coatings such as Au 
(gold), Pt (platinum), Os (osmium), Ir (iridium), and Al (aluminum) with MgF (magne- 
sium fluoride) and SiO x (silicon oxide).

2. DESCRIPTION OF COATING SAMPLES 

The four coating samples are shown schematically in Figure 5, indicating their composi- 
tions and the known dimensions. It is not known if, previous to the flight, those samples 
were baked out in vacuum to reduce their outgassing. We are assuming that they were 
not. The descriptions of the samples, the primary uses and advantages of the coatings, 
and available data on the samples follow. 

Kapton®/VDA, 1000A SiO x (Sample #3) 

This sample was composed of 1000 A of SiO x deposited on the vacuum- aluminized face 
of Kapton, which was attached to the aluminum support disk with 3M Corporation's Y- 
966 transfer adhesive. Data on the sample indicate that the weight of the assembled 
components was 4.345883 g and its total thickness was 0.1294 in. (0.3287 cm). The 
weight of the support disk was approximately 4.25987 g and its thickness was 0. 1 148 in. 
(0.2916 cm). No other data was given. The surface was described as "shiny metallized." 
This combination is often used as an environmental protective coating, is resistant to 
atomic oxygen exposure, and provides improved radiative properties after space environ- 
ment exposure, 

Kapton/VDA with 100 A ln 2 3 (Sample #2) 

This sample consisted of 100 A of indium oxide deposited on Kapton. The Kapton was 
attached with its vacuum-deposited Al face to the aluminum support disk with 3M's Y- 
966 adhesive. The data sheet indicates that the assembled sample weight was 4.328355 g 
and its thickness was 0.1271 in. (0.3228 cm). The support disk weight was approximately 
4.259878 g and its thickness was 0.1 160 in. (0.2946 cm). The surface was described as 
"yellow," and "shiny " The indium oxide coating provides sufficient electrical conductiv- 
ity, has little effect on substrate solar absorption and emittance, and remains stable during 
long exposure in space to UV radiation and particle bombardment. 

RTV-615 Silicone on Aluminum (Sample #2C) 

This sample consisted of devolatized General Electric Corporation (GE) RTV-615 two- 
part silicone with an A/B parts-by- weight mix ratio of 10/1, which was bonded to the 
aluminum disk via GE primer SS4155. The data describe it as a clear silicone. The total 
thickness of the assembly was 0. 1 253 in. (0.3 1 83 cm). The weight of the support disk 
was 4.25987 g and its thickness was 0.1 127 in. (0.2862 cm). No other description was 
given. This combination is an environmental protective coating used as a sealant and is 
particularly resistant to atomic oxygen.

RTV-615/SHicone-Treated ZnO (zinc oxide) (Sample #1A) 

This sample consisted of GE's devolatized RTV-615 two-part silicone with 68% of 
UTRTs I^SiC^ coated and buffered SP-500 ZnO pigment. The RTV-615 silicone had an 
A/B parts-by-weight mix ratio of 10:1. The material was bonded to the aluminum disk 
via GE primer, SS4155. The total weight was 4.55060 g and the total thickness was 
0. 1343 in. (0.341 1 cm). The weight of the support disk was 4.25987 g and its thickness 
was 0.1 197 in. (0.3040 cm). No other data were given. This combination is a thermal 
control coating and is used as a white paint for spacecraft and other structures. It is 
resistant to UV radiation exposure. 

3. DATA AND MEASUREMENTS TAKEN 

The effect of the space environment on these samples is indicated by providing the 
following descriptive parameters. 

o The sample weight loss per unit area (g cm' 2 )--This is the difference between the 

weight of the flight and control samples before and after the mission, ratioed to the 
exposed area of the flight samples. 

o The sample thickness loss (cm)-This is obtained from the difference in thickness 

of the flight samples before and after the mission. Depending on the magnitude of the 
difference, one can determine the degree of coating loss attributable to the space environ- 
ment. 

o A percent thickness loss-This is based on the same assumptions used for the 

measurements of the coating thickness. 

o A comparison of the spectral reflectance and the integrated absorption and emit- 

tance of the coatings before and after space environment exposure-The measurements 
were made using the P.E. X-9 spectrophotometer. 

o Surface analysis of the samples-The ESCA probe was used to provide elemental/ 

chemical composition of the samples within a depth of 100 A (up to some 50 monolay- 
ers) employing x rays to emit electrons. 

o Photographic and microscopic documentation-This shows the reference and 

flight sample surface appearance and related evaluation of the changes that may have 
occurred following space exposure. 



4. SAMPLE ANALYSES 
1000 A of SiO x on VDA Kapton 

Visual Inspection«The surface was highly reflective with some raised areas. The flight 
sample surface was slightly duller than the reference sample, with extremely fine 
discontinuities over the entire surface, 

High-Magnification Inspection-The shape of the discontinuities was not discernible at 
200 X magnification. There were no pinholes in the vacuum-deposited Al. 

ESC A Analysis-The composition of both the flight and reference samples were similar, 
as shown by the spectrogram in Figure 6. The concentrations of Si and O remain constant 
through the thicknesses of both samples. Erosion may have been uniform over the sur- 
face. Peaks of silicone and oxygen are found within the various thicknesses. 

Radiative Analysis--The reflectances vs. wavelengths are shown in Figure 7. The ex- 
posed sample shows an improved reflectance below 450 nm and above 700 nm. The 
integrated properties are a = 0. 127 and e = 0.023 for the flight sample, and a = 0. 155 and 
e = 0.025 for the reference sample. 

Physical Analysis-The mass loss of the flight sample was 3.3 x 10* 5 g or about 8.9 x 
10" 6 g cm* 2 of the exposed area. The thickness change amounted to 3.032 x 10" 3 cm, 
corresponding to about 0.994% of the total sample thickness. 

Oxygen Erosion-The change in thickness, 3.032 x 10 3 cm, is considerably more than 
the Si0 2 thickness of 1000 A (1 x 10" 5 cm). Some of the VDA Kapton was eroded. One 
cannot establish a reaction rate constant because the measured mass loss and thickness 
may include changes due to the sample's outgassing losses. 

100A ln 2 3 on VDA/Kapton 

Visual Inspection-Figures 8 and 9 reveal uniformly oriented serrations in the highly 
reflective, gold-colored Kapton surface. Brushed marks on the aluminized surface are 
opaque with a golden hue and an aluminized color visible on only a few small areas. 

High-Magnification Inspection-An etched, frosted appearance is visible at the brush 
marks under the undamaged areas. 

ESCA Analysis-The flown coating sample (Figure 10) has a rough surface with visible 
erosion and delamination. The non-exposed surface appears shiny at the outer edge, with 
no visible damage. The exposed surface is severely eroded and gray in color, with scratch

marks around the eroded area. The scratched and eroded areas are made up mostly of 
Kapton, with some traces of indium. The indium at those locations measured up to 0.95 
atomic % while at the unexposed surfaces, the indium was 7 atomic %, 

Radiative Analysis-Figure 1 1 shows the reflectances of the exposed and reference 
samples. About 10% reflectance loss occurred at wavelengths below 450 nm and about 
5% loss occurred between 600 and 1600 nm. The integrated values are 0.391 absorption 
and 0.547 emittance for the flown sample and are 0.363 and 0.564, respectively, for the 
reference sample. 

Physical Analysis-The mass loss for the sample was 0.001867 g, or about 5.37 x 10" 4 g 
cm" 2 of exposed area. The thickness change amounted to about 5.08 x 10 3 cm, corre- 
sponding to about 1.538% of the total thickness. 

Oxygen Erosion-The 100 A (10" 6 cm) of Io^ and a considerable amount of the VDA/ 
Kapton were eroded. In addition, considerable material and thickness must have been lost 
by outgassing in space. Not knowing if bakeout in vacuum was performed on the material 
before launch, it is not possible to estimate the reaction efficiency of the indium. How- 
ever, the various analyses have indicated that the indium was completely eroded. The 
reaction rate for the Kapton is known to be about 3 x 10" 24 cm 3 /atom from other orbital 
tests. 

Devolatized RTV-615 Bonded on Al with SS 4155 Primer 

Visual Inspection-The surface is clear and transparent with no noticeably changed 
features (Figures 12 and 13). 

High-Magnification Inspection-Optical magnification shows banded networks with 
areas of contamination (possibly impacts) at focal points of several bands (Figures 12 and 
13). The network of crack lines may have orignated from solar exposure and from addi- 
tional material losses causing thermal cracking. 

ESC A Analysis-The erosion pattern is similar to that of the sample consisting of the 
same RTV with l^SiC^ and ZnO pigment. The flight sample shows carbon content of 1.5 
atomic %, while the reference sample has 35 atomic %. The Si concentration did not 
change, while the O concentration doubled in the flight sample (Figure 14). 

Radiative Analysis-The flight sample experienced a loss of about 5% in reflectance 
throughout the measured range of wavelength with respect to that of the reflectance 
sample. The integrated properties are: a = 0.489 and e = 0.819 for the flight sample, and 
a = 0.432 and e = 0.824 for the reference sample (Figure 15).

Physical Analysis-The mass loss was 0.0037 g, or about 8.983 x 10' 3 g cm" 2 of the 
exposed area. The thickness change amounted to about 8.63 x 10" 3 cm, corresponding to 
about 2.617% of the total thickness. 

Oxygen Erosion-The change in thickness, 0.0034 in. (8.63 x 10' 3 cm), is considerably 
less than the thickness of the RTV and primer 0.0167 in. (4.24 x 10" 2 cm). Under the 
assumptions that the loss was the result of the oxygen erosion, we could calculate the 
reaction efficiency. 

However, calculations to estimate the reaction efficiency using the above data indicate a 
considerable oxygen erosion, much larger than the value of 6.25 x 10 26 cm 3 /atom re- 
ported in reference 3. The discrepancy in order of magnitude must be assumed to have 
been produced by loss of material from outgassing. 

RTV-615/Silicate-Treated ZnO 

Visual Inspection--The flight sample surface appears slighdy glossy and white, with 
raised agglomerated particles originating from the glossy matrix surface. The reference 
sample is flat white. 

High-Magnification Inspection--The sample surface is shown in Figures 16 and 17. 

ESCA Analysis-This analysis (Figure 18) indicated considerable difference in the 
concentrations of carbon (C) between the flight and the reference specimens. The con- 
centrations of Si between the two are about equal and constant through the thicknesses. 
The O and C concentrations differ. The C concentration decreases by 21 atomic % and O 
increases by 18 atomic % after 1 minute of etching. On the other hand, for the reference 
sample, the C decreases by 7 atomic % concentration and the O increases by 2 atomic % 
for the same etching time. No Zn or K peaks were found, even though the silicone was 
filled with potassium silicate and ZnO, indicating that they had eroded or that they had 
penetrated into deeper layers. 

Radiative Analysis-The reflectance versus wavelength is shown in Figure 19. It shows 
some loss between 400 and 700 nm and between 1800 and 2100 nm. The integrated 
absorption is 0.201 and the emittance is 0.891 for the flown sample and 0.190 and 0.907, 
respectively, for the reference sample. 

Physical Analysis-The mass loss was 8.27 x 10" 4 g, or about 2.33 x 10^ g cm* 2 of 
exposed surface. The thickness change amounted to 3 x 10 3 in. (7.78 x 10~ 3 cm), corre- 
sponding to about 2.142% of the total thickness.

Oxygen Erosion-Both the RTV and the silicate were eroded. The actual erosion and 
mass thickness are not known because of the possible loss by outgassing, and the calcula- 
tion for the reaction efficiency could be erroneous. But, as indicated, the erosion did 
occur. 

5. CONCLUSIONS 

The four material coatings aboard the LDEF that were exposed directly to the space 
environment at an orbit of 260 nautical miles for 10 months, beginning 1 month after 
launch, have exhibited the following. 

1000 A of SiO x on Kapton--The sample of SiO x was uniformly eroded. The 
concentrations of O and Si remained constant. Some improved reflectance occurred 
below 450 nm and above 700 nm. 

100 A Infis on VDA/Kapton--The sample was severely eroded, with the indium 
reduced to less than 0.95 atomic % in comparison to the unexposed sample at 7 atomic 
%. The color changed from gold to gray. Kapton was exposed to the eroded areas and it 
exhibited substantial erosion. Losses of 5% to 10% in reflectance resulted below 450 nm 
and between 600 and 1600 nm. 

RTV-615 Devolatized on AIuminum-The sample surface shows erosion and 
banded networks originating from focal points. Carbon content dropped significandy. 
The Si concentration remained constant while the O concentration doubled with respect 
to the reference sample. Reflectance losses of about 5% occurred throughout the ana- 
lyzed spectrum. 

RTV-615 Silicate-Treated ZnO-The flight sample surface changed from flat 
white to slightly glossy white. The C concentration decreased by about 21 atomic % 
while the O concentration increased by 18 atomic %, as it etched into the surface. A 
comparable etching of the reference sample indicates a C drop of 7 atomic % and an O 
increase of 2 atomic %. No Zn and K were found, indicating either erosion or penetration 
deeper into the coating. Some loss of reflectance is noted at the wavelengths between 
400 and 700 nm, and between 1800 and 2100 nm. The silicone was eroded. 

An evaluation of the O reaction efficiency for the coatings exposed to a total O fluence of 
about 2.6 x 10 20 atoms cm' 2 was not possible. The material losses and recessions, quite 
certainly, included outgassing products, but these could not be determined. However, 
from the above analyses, general indications of these coatings' performance in orbit was 
possible.

13, ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words) 

Four material coatings of different thicknesses were flown on the LDEF to determine their ability to perform in the harsh space 
environment. The coatings, located in the ram direction of the spacecraft, were exposed for 10 months to the low-Earth orbit 
(LEO) environment experienced by the LDEF at an orbit of 260 nautical miles. They consisted of: Indium Oxide (Iru^), 
Silicon Oxide (SiO x ), clear RTV silicone, and Silicone with Silicate-treated Zinc Oxide (ZnO). These coatings were flown to 
assess their behavior when exposed to atomic oxygen and to confirm their good radiative properties, stability, electrical 
conductivity, and resistance to UV exposure. The flown samples were checked and compared with the reference unflown 
samples using high-magnification optical inspection, ESCA analysis, weight changes and dimensional changes. These 
comparisons indicated the following. The lOOOA SiO x coating eroded uniformly, with minor changes in its radiative proper- 
ties. The 100A of ln 2 3 coating eroded completely down to the Kapton® backing, with resultant losses of reflectance. The 
RTV-615 showed erosion, with carbon (C) content losses, while the Si remained constant, with a doubling of the oxygen (O) 
concentration. The RTV-615 silicone with KjS^-treated ZnO changed from flat to glossy white in appearance. It lost C, was 
etched, and increased its O content. The upper layers showed no remaining Zn or K. Losses of reflectance occurred within 
certain wavelength bands. It was not possible to evaluate the experimental oxygen reaction rate using the calculated atomic 
oxygen fluence of 2.6 x 10 20 atoms/cm 2 for the exposure of these coatings during the flight. The bakeout of the coatings was 
not carried out prior to the flight. Hence, the coating weight and dimensional losses included losses by outgassing products.
