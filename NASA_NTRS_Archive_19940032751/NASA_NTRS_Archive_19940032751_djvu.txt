INTRODUCTION 


The results included in this report were previously released as a company report, see Reference 1, and 
this report is intended to formalize that analysis and to document the results of a validation study that 
was performed later and included here as Appendix B. Prior to that analysis, the stresses in the joints 
of the model support systems were resolved by assuming the moment in the joint was reacted about 
the center of the joint and the stresses were the result of this moment that were reacted over a plane 
parallel to the horizontal centerline. The new analytical technique was developed to better define the 
loads and stresses in typical sting joints found in the model support systems at the National Transonic 
Facility at NASA LaRC and to provide a design tool that could easily be used during the design of new 
model support systems. To be more precise, the original objective was to provide a method of 
determining the loads and stresses in concentric, tapered, socket type joints found in wind tunnel model 
support systems. Once completed, the analytical method was found to be applicable to any 
overlapping type joint. Some joints for which the method is applicable are illustrated in Figure 1 and 
includes general configurations where one of the joint members can be considered to be basically 
supported by the contact pressure from the other joint member. The forward end of a model support 
system engages with and is supported by an aft support system, which is the subject of this report. A 
lamppost is supported by the ground and the analytical technique included herein can be used to 
determine if the depth of penetration is sufficient for the bearing pressure of the soil to laterally 
support the lamppost during high wind conditions. The strength of a clamped round bar assembly and 
the strength of a tongue and groove type joint that are subjected to external forces and moments can 
both be evaluated using this analytical technique. The tongue and groove joint would, however, 
require some additional development to determine the proper stress relationships which could be 
accomplished by a similar analysis to what is included here by using strip theory to evaluate the 
strength of a unit width of the joint. 

The results in this report are in the form of equations that are for a concentric, tapered socket type 
joint and can be used during the design of new model support systems to determine the strength of 
socket joints and for most applications the need of more lengthy analyses can be avoided. Results are 
provided for both a joint where the joint members are in continuous contact along the full length of 
the joint and for a joint with intermediate contact relief. The joint with intermediate contact relief has 
a gap between the joint members along about one-third of the midsection of the joint, typical of 


1 



NASA LaRC sting joints, and the joint members are in full contact fore and aft of this midsection gap. 
Illustrations of both joint types are given in Figures 2 and 3. Analytically, the approach for both was 
to use Strength of Materials principles to analyze the joint members by idealizing the joint as two 
rigid, parallel beams that are joined by an infinite number of springs along the contacting surfaces. 
The contact loads can be pictured as being equivalent to the loads developed in the springs along the 
length of the joint attributed to the differential slope between two rigid joint members. The contact 
loads between the joint members are represented as externally applied, linearly varying, distributed 
loads and are as shown on the free body diagrams in Figure 2 and 3. Each joint member is treated like 
a simple beam and the contact loads between the beams are taken to act like external loads that are 
independently applied to each of the two beams. For the first joint member, depicted in Figures 2b 
and 3b, the externally applied loads are balanced by the application of the contact type loads and for 
the second joint member, depicted in Figures 2c and 3c, the contact loads are the only loads that act 
on the end of the cantilevered beams. These contact loads, in conjunction with the externally applied 
loads for the forward joint members are used to develop independent expressions for the bending 
moment along the length of the joint for the two joint members. The joint stress relationships for the 
joint members are determined from the bending moment equations by including the effects of 
appropriate section properties for a given geometry. The geometry of the contacting surfaces for the 
joint in this report is in the shape of a frustum of a cone and is representative of the tapered socket 
type joints found in model support systems in NASA LaRC wind tunnels. 

The results in this report can be used to determine the distributed contact loads and stresses in sting 
joints directly from joint dimensions and externally applied loads. As a design aid, the key equations 
have been programed for a personal computer to automatically compute all the results given in this 
report. A copy of an IBM BASIC program that was developed to evaluate the results for a concentric 
tapered, socket type joint is included as Appendix A.

ANALYSIS 


FORWARD JOINT MEMBER WITH CONTINUOUS CONTACT 


Load Development 

To identify the stresses in the joint, the contact loads can be used to evaluate distributed bending 
moments and ultimately the stresses. Expressions for distributed loads can be developed in terms of 
the externally applied loads by assuming a linear load variation along the longitudinal axis of the beam 
members attributed to the contact pressure and solving for maximum magnitudes of the distributed 
loads required to achieve equilibrium. The direction of the loading reverses at some intermediate 
location which is literally where the contact loads shift from the upper mating surface to the lower 
mating surface and this load reversal location can be used as a dependent variable to simplify other 
expressions. To solve for this load reversal location, consider that there are two other unknowns which 
are the maximum magnitudes of the distributed loads at each end of the joint, or the concentrated 
loads that are equivalent to the distributed loads, and three equations will therefore be required for a 
unique solution. Summation of forces and moments provide two of the equations and an assumption 
that the distributed loads are linear provides the basis for a third equation. For an illustration of the 
loads and relevant dimensions refer to Figure 2b. Summing forces in the vertical direction for the 
forward joint member yields 


F 0 * W 1 + W 2 = 0 


( 1 ) 


Summing moments about the load center of the externally applied loads, Fq and Mq, provides 


M„ + W, 


L

(b-a-c)

W 2 [ l - a - I] = 0 


( 2 ) 


For the linear variation assumption, the loads can be related by using the geometric properties of 
similar triangles (the ratio of all corresponding sides of similar triangles are equal) 


W| w r, 

(b-a-c) c 


( 3 ) 


3 



To equate the preceding equations, expressions for the distributed loads given in equation (3) can be 
determined in terms of concentrated loads, using a basic definition that an equivalent concentrated 
load for a linearly varying distributed load that goes to zero is half the product of the peak distributed 
load times the distance over which the load acts. The following relationships are rearranged to solve 
for the distributed loads in terms of the concentrated loads. 

2W i 

W 1 = (4) 

2W 9 

w 2 = -r 4 (5) 

substituting equations (4) and (5) into equation (3) gives the following relationship between the 
equivalent concentrated loads after grouping 

[(M 2 - 2c(b-a) + c 2 ] W 9 - c 2 Wj = 0 (3a) 


Three linearly independent equations, (1), (2), and (3a) are now available that can be solved 
simultaneously for the three unknowns (c, Wj and W 2 ) in terms of the externally applied loads (F () 
and Mq) and the joint dimensions as shown in Figure 2. The load reversal location would be 



To simplify the following expressions for the equivalent concentrated loads, the equations are expressed 
in terms of the load reversal location, c, which is defined in the preceeding equation 



4 






The dimension identifying the load reversal location, c, can also be used to simplify the expression for 
the varying contact load and will be used in the following development as an independent variable. 
The dimension identifies the physical location where the contact loads shift from the upper mating 
surfaces to the lower mating surfaces and distinguishes where separate governing equations are required 
for the downward acting loads and for the upward acting loads, see Figure 2. 


Forward Bending Moment Equation 


Expressions for the bending moment at 
any location along the length of the joint 
can be developed in terms of the 
downward acting contact loads by 
considering the forward load 
segment as a function of the x-distance 
along the beam, see adjacent figure. 
Again, using similar triangles, the 
magnitude of this partial distributed 
load at some general distance ”x” from 
the external loads would be

The distance from the center of this variable concentrated load to the section at which the bending 
moment is being evaluated, see above figure, can be evaluated as if it was a homogeneous plane section 
by using the distributed loads as equivalent to any other dimension.

Simplifying

The expression for the general bending moment at any location along the forward end of the joint 
would be the product of the variable concentrated load, YV X , and the distance to its respective load 
center, x x , in combination with the moment attributed to the externally applied loads Mq and Fq 


M x = Mg + FqX - W x x x for L-b < x < L-a-c 

Substituting for W x and x x , using equations (11) and (13), and simplifying provides the final 
expression of the bending moment for the forward end of the joint (note that a similar expression can 
be found in Reference 3 for a cantilever with a partial triangular load)

Aft Bending Moment Equation 


For the aft end of the joint, a similar 
expression is required which is a 
function of the preceding terms 
and also the upward acting 
distributed load that starts at 
the load reversal location, see 
adjacent figure. The general 
bending moment aft of the 
load reversal location in terms 
of a newly defined variable 
concentrated load, W x , and the 
distance to its load center, x x , can 
then be expressed as follows: 



M x = M q + F 0 x -Wj x-(L-b) - ( b ' 3 a — ) 


-f W x x x for L-a-c < x < L- 


(15) 


where 


(b - a - c) . _ 


IS Xj. 


To determine a new expression for the variable concentrated load at the aft end of the joint start with 
a general expression of the partial distributed load at the location of the evaluation in terms of the aft 
distributed load 


w

^x-L+a-fc\

for L-a-c < x < L-a 


(16) 


which in terms of the equivalent concentrated load from equation (5) would be 

w x = ^( x L + a + c ) . w 9 for L-a-c < x < L-a (17) 

or 

The general expression for the variable concentrated load at the aft end of the joint can then be 
expressed in terms of the distributed load as 

W x = iw x (x-L+a+c) for L-a-c < x < L-a (18) 


7 



and in terms of the total concentrated aft load would be 


w x = W 2 ( x - L + a+c ) 2 for L-a-c < x < L-a (19) 

The distance from the location of the evaluation to this aft centroid would be 

x x = i (x-L+a+c) for L-a-c < x < L-a (20) 

The final expression of the general bending moment at any location along the aft end of the joint, after 
substituting equation (19) for the concentrated load into equation (15) and equation (20) for the 
centrodial distance, can be expressed as 


M y — *+*

(21) 


where c, Wj and W 2 are determined from equations (6), (7) and (8). 

Note that at x = L - a - c either equation (14) or equation (21) can be used to evaluate the bending 
moment since they are algebraically identical. 

BENDING MOMENT EQUATIONS FOR AFT JOINT MEMBER WITH CONTINUOUS CONTACT 

For the aft joint member, the loading is purely through the contact loads and the external loads, Mq 
and Fq, would not appear directly in the expressions for the bending moment equations, see Figure 2c. 
The bending moment equations for the aft joint member would be similar to the equations for the 
forward joint member with the only differences being the omission of the externally applied loads, Mq 
and Fq, and a sign change to indicate that the loads act in the opposite direction. The general 
expression for the bending moment equations for the aft joint member can therefore be obtained 
directly from previous equations by simply omitting the external load terms and by changing the sign 
of the concentrated load terms to reflect loads are in the opposite direction. Revising equation (14) 
yields the following general bending moment equation for the forward end of the aft joint member

where c and Wj are determined from equations (6) and (7). 

Revising equation (21) yields the following general bending moment equation for the aft end of the aft 
joint member 



where c, Wj and W 2 are determined from equations (6), (7) and (8). 

FORWARD JOINT MEMBER WITH INTERMEDIATE CONTACT RELIEF 
Load Development 

Expressions for the loading between two beam members that are not in contact along the full length of 
the joint can be developed similar to the preceding for the joint with continuous contact. The primary 
difference is that a third set of independent bending moment equations will be required for the 
intermediate region where the joints are not in contact, see Figure 3 for dimensions and an illustration 
of the joint. The load reversal location will again be used even though for this case it is a hypothetical 
dimension based on a projection of the linearized distributed load and would define where the loading 
would be zero, if the contact were continuous, see Figure 3b. The load reversal location will generally 
occur along the intermediate relief region and an expression for its location will be developed later. 
Summing forces in the vertical direction for the forward joint member would provide the same results 
as given in equation (1) and summing moments about the load center of the externally applied loads, 
Fq and Mq, provides 

M q + Wj(L - b + xj) - W 2 ( L - a - x 2 ) = 0 (24) 

Solving equations (1) and (24) simultaneously for the concentrated loads, Wj and W 2 > in terms of the 
externally applied loads, Fq and Mq, and the load center locations, Xj and x 2 , yields

(b - a) - xj - x 2 


Wo = 


M 0 + ( L - b + x i) F c 

(b - a) - Xj - x "2 


(26) 


The load center locations, and X 2 , can be determined as before by considering the distributed 
loading as if it were a homogeneous plane section and the location of the concentrated loads can be 
evaluated as if they were the centroid locations, see Figure 3 for illustration of dimensions. Solving for 
the load centers in terms of the distributed loads yield 


e ^w 1 + 2 w i / ) 
3 ^Wj + Wj'j 

f ^ w 2 ^ 

3^W2 + W2^ 


(27) 


(28) 


The intermediate distributed loads terms, Wj' and can be eliminated from the above expressions 

by again using the properties of similar triangles to relate them to the maximum magnitudes of the 
distributed loads. For an assumed linear variation along the length of the joint, the intermediate 
distributed loads in terms of the maximum magnitudes of distributed loads and related joint 
dimensions would be 


w ,' = (S^ f ) w 2 


(29) 

(30) 


Substituting equation (29) into (27) into equation (30) into (28), yields the following expressions for 
the load center locations, after simplifying

3 2(b - a - c) - e 


(31)

(32)

Note that in the final expressions for the load centers, all the distributed load terms have canceled out 
and the only remaining terms are the joint dimensions. These expressions for the load centers can now 
be substituted into the expressions for the concentrated loads, equations (25) and (26), to obtain 
expressions that are only functions of the externally applied loads, Fq and Mq, and the joint 
dimensions

The only joint dimension included in the above equations that is not yet known is the load reversal 
location, c, and it can be determined by starting with the assumption of linear variation in the 
distributed loads that relates the distributed loads to the joint dimensions, again based on properties 
of similar triangles. 


W 1 _ ^2

(35) 


Relationships between the distributed loads and the concentrated loads are needed and can be obtained 
by considering the concentrated loads are equivalent to the product of the average distributed load 
times the respective lengths, again see Figure 3b for illustration.

Forward Bending Moment Equation 

The development of the general bending equation for the joint with intermediate contact relief would 
be similar to the preceding development for a joint with continuous contact as illustrated on Page 5. 
For the forward end of the joint, the distributed load, w x , would be the same as in equation (9), the 
variable concentrated load, W x , in terms of the distributed load, would be the same as in equation 


12 






(10), and the load center location x x , would be the same as in equation (13). At this point, however, 
to simplify the expressions of the bending moment equations for the joint with intermediate contact 
relief, the equations are expressed in terms of the maximum distributed loads, w^ and W 2 , in lieu of 
the concentrated loads, Wj and W 9 , as was done previously. The general expression for the bending 
moment at any location along the forward end of the joint with relief contact can be expressed as a 
combination of the moment attributed to the externally applied loads, Mg and Fg, together with the 
product of the variable concentrated load, W x , given in equation (10), and the distance to the load 
center location x x . 

M x = Mg + Fgx - W x x x for L - b < x < L - b + e 
Substituting for W x and x x using equations (10) and (13) yields, after simplifying 


M x - Mq + FqX - -gij

3(x-L-fb) - 7 t 7- 

(b-a-c) 


for L-b < x < L-b+e 


(42) 


where Wj and c are determined from equations (38) and (dl). 

Central llending Moment Equation 

Similarly the general expression for the bending moment at any location along the intermediate section 
of the joint with contact relief would be the sum of the product of a concentrated load, W|, and the 
distance to the load center location, combined with the moment attributed to the externally applied 
loads Mg and Fg 

M x = Mg -f FgX - Wj (x - L + b - X| ) for L - b t o < x < L - a - f 

Substituting for W|, obtained by rearranging equation (38), and for x^, using equation (31) yields the 
following, after simplifying 


13 





where w^ and c are determined from equations (38) and (41). 

Aft Bending Moment Equation 



The variable concentrated load for the partial section would then simply be the product of the average 
of the distributed loads at the two ends times the length of the section 

( w 9 ' + w' \ 

W x = ^ 2 J (x - L + a + f) forL-a-f<x< L-a (45) 

substituting for an< ^ w x / ’ us i n S equations (30) and (44), yields the desired expression for the 
concentrated load, after regrouping 


14 




w x = 


for L - a - f < x < L - a 


To obtain the relative location of this load, x x , a similar development that was used to determine the 
load centers and ^ given in equations (27) and (28), can be used to provide the following 
expression for the relative location of the load 


(x - L + a + f) ( w' x + 2 w 2 7 


w x' + w 2 


forL-a-f<x< L 


which after substituting for W 2 f and w x ; , using equations (30) and (44) yields, after simplifying 


(x - L + a + f) / X -L + a + 3c-2f 
3 V x - L + a + 2c - f 


forL-a-f<x< L-a 


The general expression for the bending moment at any location along the aft end of the forward joint 
member of the joint with contact relief can now be expressed as the sum of the product of the variable 
concentrated load, W x , and the distance to its respective load center, x x , in combination with the 
moment up through the intermediate section, as given in equation (42). 


M x - Mq + FqX - W 1 (x-L + b-Xj) + W x x x for L-a-f<x<L-a 

Substituting for W x and x x , using equations (4G) and (48) yields, after simplifying 



where w^, W 2 , and c are determined from equations (38), (39) and (41).

BENDING MOMENT EQUATIONS FOR AFT JOINT MEMBER WITH INTERMEDIATE 
CONTACT RELIEF 


As was done for the joint with continuous contact, the bending moment equations for the aft joint 
member can be obtained directly from the equations for the forward joint member by simply omitting 
terms that include the external load Fq and Mq and changing the sign of the remaining terms, see 
Figure 3c for an illustration of the loads. 

The following general expression for the bending moment equations along the forward end of the aft 
joint member is obtained by revising equation (42).

JOINT STRESS RELATIONSHIPS 


To evaluate the strength of a typical socket type joint of a model support system, the previously 
developed results can be combined with appropriate geometric properties to determine the respective 
stresses. The previously developed results were independent of the overall geometry of the joint, except 
for using the length of the joint for distributing the loadings, but for the following development of the 
stress equations, specific cross sectional shapes are needed. For the typical socket joints found in NASA 
LaRC wind tunnel model support systems, shown in Figure 4, a frustum of a cone would be 
representative of the geometry and is therefore used here to determine typical sectional properties. The 
resulting stresses are based on a force and moment such as a normal force and pitch moment and if 
other combined loads are to be considered simultaneously, such as a side force and yaw moment, 
results must be obtained vectorily. Results for joint geometries other than a frustrum of a cone can be 
developed similar to the following by substitution of appropriate sectional properties. 


Bending Stress 


Because of variations in geometry, the affect of the sectional properties interacting with the affect of 
the bending moment change along the length of the joint and the locations of the maximum bending 
stress and the maximum bending moment do not necessarily coincide, particularly for the first joint 
member as is illustrated in Figure 4. For the second joint member the bending moment is increasing 
as a function of ’’x” and generally the maximum stress occurs at the end of the joint where the bending 
moment is a maximum. The bending stress in either joint member can be evaluated from the 
following relationship 


^b = 


Mx 

I/c 


(53) 


17 




where M x is the respective bending moment, determined from the previously developed bending 
moment equations, and I/c is the section property at the cross section being evaluated. Note that for 
tapered joints, the cross-sectional properties vary along the length of the joint and the effect of this 
variation has to be considered concurrently with the changes in the bending moment in order to obtain 
the absolute maximum. Generally the maximum for the forward joint member occurs within the 
forward ten percent of the length, and for the aft joint members the maximum is at the aft end of the 
joint, but it is recommended that the relative bending stresses be evaluated iteratively at a sufficient 
number of locations to identify where the absolute maximum bending stress occurs. 

Transverse Shear Stress 


The maximum shear stress for each of the two joint members occurs at opposite ends of the respective 
joints and is where the full shear force is carried totally by only one of the beam members, see Figure 
4. For the distribution through the cross section, the maximum occurs at the neutral axis with respect 
to bending flexure and for solid circular beam cross section the maximum shear stress would be as 
given in Reference 2 


_ 4V _ IE 0 
” 3A S “ 3A 


where the shear force, V, is equivalent to the externally applied force, Fq and the area, A s , is the 
sectional area of the respective joint member. For a hollow circular cross section the maximum would 
be similar 



(55) 


Note that the maximum shear stress, with respect to the distribution through the cross section, would 
be where the bending stress is zero and the maximum bending stress is where shear stress is zero so 
combining the maximum shear stress with the maximum bending stress is not necessary, see Reference 
4 for further detail.

Hoop Stress 


The hoop stress is an expression of how the peripheral tensile loads are carried tangentially in the wall 
of the outer joint member and is a result of the contact loads. Consider a section of the outer joint 
member sliced horizontally, and the hoop stress can be physically interpreted as the lateral forces that 
are tending to separate the joint along this section cut. 


'h 



(56) 


Where the local lateral force in the joint, p, would be the product of a distributed load, w, and some 
differential length and the area of the material resisting this force would be the product of twice the 
wall thickness, 2t, to account for the two sides of the joint, multiplied by the same differential length 
as in the numerator. Rewriting the previous equation in terms of these definitions and canceling the 
differential length from both the numerator and the denominator yields 


*h 



(57) 


Note that both the distributed load, w, and the wall thickness, t, vary along the length of the joint 
and although generally the maximum occurs at the free end of the outer joint member, for w^ as given 
in either equation (4) or equation (38), it is best to at least spot check some other locations to verify 
that the thinner wall sections do not result in an even larger stress. The equation is valid along the 
length of the entire joint and can be used to evaluate the local hoop stress at any location along the 
length of the joint by simply using the appropriate distributed load together with the corresponding 
wall thickness at the same respective location. 


Contact Pressure Stress 

The previously developed expressions were for the linear distribution along the length of the joint and 
to obtain a true distribution of the contact loads a lateral distribution across the width of the joint is 
needed. In general for elastic, curved bodies that are in compression, an elliptic load distribution is 
assumed that considers mutual deflections between the contacting bodies. To obtain the maximum 
contact pressure stress, also known as the Hertz contact stress, the elliptical load distribution can be 


19 



integrated over the width of the joint and the result then solved for the maximum. The integral can be 
set up by using the maximum pressure as one of the parameters in the equation of an ellipse to 
determine the limits of integration. Setting up the integral and integrating yields an expression for the 
linear distributed load in terms of the maximum pressure 
■hr 

w = | b™Mr 2 - z 2 dz = fap 
-r 

Solving this expression for the maximum contact pressure, P max , in terms of the local joint diameter 
of the contacting surfaces, d, and linear distributed load, w, provides the desired expression for the 
maximum bearing stress between the mating surfaces of the joint members which is equivalent to the 
maximum contact pressure 


i z r 2 - z 2 + r 2 sin' 1 §1 +f = - ” P max 


(58) 


<r = P - 4w 
P r max - 


(59) 


For a tapered joint, the maximum can occur at either end of the joint, depending on the worse case 
combination of the distributed loads w^ and w 9 , as determined from either equations (4), (5), (38) and 
(39) and the local diameter of the contacting surfaces, d. Note that the bearing stress acts in the radial 
direction and actually can only exists where the joint members are in contact.

CONCLUSION 


The results included in this report were originally developed to evaluate the stresses in concentric, 
tapered, socket type joints for wind tunnel model support systems and the stress equations included in 
this report reflect this application. Although the analysis was for a specific geometry, the method is 
applicable to other joints as shown in Figure 1 and discussed in the Introduction. As pointed out in 
the Introduction, the key feature of this method was that the loading be transferred from one joint 
member to the other by the mutual contact pressure between the joint members and that the 
distribution vary linearly along the length of the joint from some maximum at one end to a minimum 
at the other end. The assumed linear load distribution of the contact pressure would be applicable to 
other configurations, because the Strength of Materials principles used in the analysis is independent of 
the geometry, but the stress equations would depend on a specific geometry and may need to be revised 
for new geometries of different configurations. The expressions for the distributed loads and bending 
moments included in this report can be used to develop new bearing pressure and stress equations for 
other geometries by simply substituting the appropriate sectional properties for any new geometry. In 
general, the development of new stress equations for different geometries would be similar to the 
development of the included stress equations and the only differences would be attributed to the 
differences due to the new sectional properties. A restriction that must be considered when developing 
new pressure/stress relationships is that the geometry of the joint must consist of an overlapping 
arrangement of the joint members such that the loads transfer from one joint member to the other 
solely by the mutual contact pressure. Any attachments to the joint that can alter the assumed linear 
load distribution such as threaded draw nuts would affect the computed results and the use of this 
analytical technique would then not be applicable for such configurations. 

To verify the assumption of linearity in the load distribution, a finite element analysis was performed, 
see Appendix B. A finite element model of a typical joint from a wind tunnel model support system in 
the National Transonic Facility was generated complete with loads that are typical of a representative 
model. To study the effect of differences in the relative bending stiffnesses of the joint members the 
thickness of the outer joint member was varied with two subsequent finite element models. The 
reference configuration was modified to generate two new finite element models, one with a thicker 
outer joint member and one with a thinner outer joint member, but the dimensions of the inner joint 
member was the same in all the finite element models. The results of the finite element analysis 


21 



indicate the calculated results from using the equations in this report would be conservative for the 
range of variations in the thickness of the joint members considered. It should be noted, however, that 
the best calculated results would be obtained when the stiffness of the outer joint member is a couple of 
orders of magnitude greater than the stiffness of the inner joint member. 

With regard to an appropriate aspect ratio for the length to diameter of the contacting surfaces of the 
joint members, consider the joints illustrated in Appendix B. For the joints that were analyzed, the 
aspect ratio was slightly less than two, based on the larger diameter of the inner joint member and the 
contact length of the joint members. If the aspect ratio is much smaller than two, the inner joint 
member will physically tend to rotate within the outer joint member and increase the concentrated 
loads at each end of the joint. If the aspect ratio is much larger than two, the actual load distribution 
would tend to decrease basically exponentially toward the small end of the inner joint member and the 
small end of the inner joint member would not carry its fair share of the load. Neither of these effects 
can be evaluated from the results in this report, since the loads were assumed to vary linearly, and as a 
general rule it is recommended that the aspect ratio be kept as close to two as possible to avoid any 
needless problems. 

In general, the calculated results obtained from using the equations in this report are considered to be 
conservative but relatively coarse. If a more complete description of the stress state in the joint is 
desired, it is suggested that a more detailed analytical method such as finite element analysis be used. 
The results presented in this report were not intended to replace the need for more detailed analytical 
methods but instead, the results are considered acceptable for use in conservatively evaluating the 
strength of joints in new model support systems.

160 REM 

170 REM Program computes bending moments and stresses only for the 
180 REM length of engagement of the joint. For a joint with relief the 
190 REM number of computations would be 3 (N+l) and for no relief they 
200 REM would be (N+l), where N is the input "No. of divisions” . For 
210 REM additional bending calculations, a restart option is available 
220 REM at the end of the program to allow entering a new value of N. 

230 REM 

240 REM Program is adaptable to tapered or nontapered joints that may or 
250 REM may not have surface relief: 

260 REM * The respective taper is established by entering the inside 
270 REM diameters, Di, mean diameters, Dm, and outside diameters, Do, 

280 REM for both ends of the joint (end 1 is near the loads and end 2 

290 REM is near the support). If Dml and Dm2 are equal, the program will 

300 REM ask for the Beam No. of the male joint member, otherwise the 

310 REM program determines the respective joint type from the geometries. 

320 REM * The surface relief is the magnitude that the radius is to be 

330 REM decreased and is defined by entering the depth, R, and the distance 

340 REM from the ends, e & f, where the relief is to start and stop.

APPENDIX B 

VALIDATION OF LOADING WITH FINITE ELEMENTS 


A finite element analysis, FEA, was performed to validate the profile of the assumed load distribution 
that was used in the socket joint analysis of this report. The results of the FEA were correlated with 
the linear variation in the load distribution, that was the premise of the analytical approach in 
evaluating the strength of socket joints, to demonstrate that the assumed load distribution provides 
conservative results. In order to show the interrelated effect of the relative stiffness of the respective 
joint members on the load distribution, three different joint configurations were independently 
evaluated with FEA. This evaluation was accomplished by increasing and decreasing the outer wall 
thickness from a reference configuration and then comparing the FEA results of all three configurations 
to the assumed linear variation in the load distribution. 

The finite element model, FEM, that was developed as a reference for the analysis was representative of 
a typical socket joint found in NASA LaRC wind tunnel model support systems at the National 
Transonic Facility. The FEM is shown in Figure 5 and represents the joint between a two inch 
diameter balance, the inner joint member, and a three inch diameter sting, the outer joint member. 
This was the same balance and sting joint that was included as a Sample Problem for illustrating the 
analytical results in Reference 1. The FEM consisted of three dimensional ’’brick” elements that were 
used to generate a symmetric half-model that included 2291 nodes and 1548 3-D elements. The loads 
for the FEM were the design loads of the balance from the Sample Problem: a 6500 lb normal force 
and a 13000 in-lb pitch moment acting at a location equivalent to the moment center of the balance. 
Nonlinear FEA results were equivalent to the moment center of the balance. Nonlinear FEA results 
were obtained by iterating with the FEM manually until only compressive reactions were obtained at 
the interface of the inner and outer joint members. To obtain these nonlinear results, the connectivity 
of the inner and outer joint members had to be released at any location where tensile type reactions 
were found, reconnected for any previously released location where the inner and outer joint members 
were found to overlap, and the FEA rerun until only compressive reactions were obtained with no 
overlapping of the joint members. Overlapping was detected by comparing the static deflection results 
from the FEA to see if the final

deformed position of either the inner and outer joint member extended across the geometric boundary 
of the other member. This overlapping condition could occur if connectivity was required at a location 
that had previously been released, due to a shift in the load distribution, and would allow a 
compressive load to once again be developed at that location. Once a solution was obtained that 
included only compressive loads or separation between the inner and outer joint members, the FEA 
results were accepted and the results were correlated to the profile of the distributed load that was 
assumed in the socket joint analysis. 

The iterative process that was required to obtain a nonlinear solution had to be repeated for each of the 
three different configurations because the differences in the thicknesses of the outer joint member 
produced variations in the distribution of the compressive reactions that had to be considered 
independently. The results of the FEA for each configuration are shown in Figure 6 and include load 
distributions and illustrations of each of the three joint configurations. At the center of the figure is 
the reference configuration, taken from Reference 1, and at the top and bottom are the configurations 
for decreasing and increasing, respectively, the wall thickness of the outer joint member. The FEM 
that was based on the reference configuration was developed first and then copies of the input data file 
were modified to develop the FEMs of the other configurations. The other configurations that were 
selected to study the effects of variations in the wall thickness of the outer joint member on the load 
distribution were obtained by decreasing the diameter of the outer joint member to 2.25 inches for one 
FEM and by increasing the diameter of the outer joint member to 4.0 inches for another FEM. The 
inner joint member was kept the same for all three configurations. Key dimensions of each 
configuration and the resulting load distributions are shown in Figure 6. 

To transform the radial reactions obtained from the FEA into equivalent vertical loads and to perform 
validations of the FEA results, a computer program was developed. The computer program not only 
provided tabulated results that could be directly compared to the distributed loads but also allowed 
complete equilibrium checks to readily be performed that provided confidence in the data obtained 
from the FEA. The reactions obtained from the FEA were normal to the surface between the inner 
and the outer joint members and the computer program transformed these reactions into vertical, 
lateral, and axial components. The distribution of the vertical components about the perimeter were 
lumped at the centerline, the lateral components were matched by the mirror image loads, and the 


29 



APPENDIX B 


axial components were counterbalanced with loads equivalent to those developed by the locking devices 
that secure the balance to the sting. Also the sum of the vertical components was in equilibrium with 
the externally applied normal force and the sum of the moments of the vertical components and the 

axial components about the equivalent moment center location was in equilibrium with the externally 
applied pitch moment. The vertical components that were lumped along the centerline are plotted in 
Figure 6 adjacent to the illustrations of the three joint configurations. The equivalent loads obtained 
from applying the results of the linearly distributed load obtained from the socket joint analysis, as in 
the Sample Problem of Reference 1, are also included for comparison. 

A physical interpretation that illustrates the relative effect of the wall thickness would be to consider 
the thinner outer joint member as a thin wall tube and the corresponding inner joint member as 
basically a stiff round bar. As the load is applied, the contact loads near the end of the inner rod, the 
loads would be more concentrated at the end of the inner rod, and eventually lead to a failure mode of 
the inner rod punching through the thinner outer joint member. This is depicted by a sharp spike as 
shown on the right hand side of Figure 6a which is for the distributed load for the joint with thin outer 
member. For the thicker outer joint member, the thick wall would act more like a rigid support that 
would in effect be like cantilevering the inner joint member from the end of the outer joint member. 
The loads would be more concentrated at the end of the outer joint member and would tend to be 
more uniformly distributed near the end of the inner joint member. This is depicted by the sharp spike 
shown on the left hand side of Figure 6c which is for the distributed load for the joint with thick outer 
member. Note the similarity between the distributions is turned upside down and rotated end for end. 
The similarity in the distributions could be interpreted for the thinner outer joint member as the outer 
joint member is being cantilevered off of the end of the more rigid inner joint member and for the 
thicker outer joint member, as the inner joint member is being cantilevered off of the end of the more 
rigid outer joint members.

13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words) 

This report documents the development of a set of equations that can be used to provide a relatively simple 
solution for identifying the strength of socket joints and for most cases avoid the need of more lengthy analyses. 
The analytical approach was verified by comparison of the contact load distributions to results obtained from a 
finite element analysis. The contacting surfaces for the specific joint in this analysis are in the shape of 
frustrums of a cone, and is representative of the tapered surfaces in the socket-type joints used to join segments 
of model support systems for wind tunnels. The results are in the form of equations that can be used to 
determine the contact loads and stresses in the joint from the given geometry and externally applied loads. 
Equations were determined to define the bending moments and stresses along the length of the joints based on 
Strength and Materials principles. The results have also been programmed for a personal computer and a copy 
of the program that was developed is included.
