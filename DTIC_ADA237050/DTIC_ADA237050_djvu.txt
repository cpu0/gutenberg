Transition Plan 


Distributed Ada Real-Time Kernel 


Version 1.0 


Preface 

This plan describes the project objectives and progress of the Distributed Ada Real-Time Kernel (DARK) 
Project in order to effectively plan and execute appropriate technology transition activities. The 
information contained within the document was gathered from sources listed in the plan history. 

Transition planning is a process for gathering and disseminating information. The process produces 
approaches to transitioning the products and deliverables of SEI projects. Based on project status, 
product characteristics, resource constraints, and various other factors, transition engineers, transition 
managers, the project leader, the project team, resident affiliates (if applicable), and the program 
manager select transition approaches through a process of negotiation and consensus development. 

Once the approaches are selected, Technology Transition personnel work with the project to execute the 
planned tasks, accessing and deploying resources from across the Institute.

1.1 Problem Statement 

This project was initiated to demonstrate the feasibility of developing Ada applications — of acceptable 
quality and performance — for real-time distributed systems. One of the most persistent problems with 
the transition to Ada is the suitability of the Ada runtime system operating in environments that use 
tasking with distributed systems. Many users feel forced to create their own solutions to the constraints of 
Ada definition and implementation in real-time distributed systems. This project intends to produce a 
generic solution in the form of a software artifact that can meet the needs of most Ada real-time 
distributed users. This artifact is called the Distributed Ada Real-Time Kernel (DARK). 

1.2 Summary of Activities 

The DARK Project objective is two-pronged. First the project will replace the standard Ada tasking 
mechanism with a software artifact (that it develops) that can meet the needs of the mission critical

Transition Plan 


Distributed Ada Real-Time Kernel 


Version 1.0 


computer resource (MCCR) community. Second, it will transition this artifact to the MCCR community. 
To date, the project has developed detailed requirement and design specifications to (1) ensure that the 
product is properly developed and (2) to allow the MCCR community to review the requirements, design, 
implementation, and testing. 

The transition strategy for DARK consists of two parts. Activities under the first part of the strategy 
constitute a proof of concept program to demonstrate the usability of the Kernel with the goal of it being 
adopted by one of the acceptor sites. The proof of concept program supports the second part of the 
DARK transition strategy by demonstrating the usability of the Kernel and by developing a potential 
market for a commercial version of the Kernel. 

The first part involves the transfer of the Kernel to a number of acceptor sites. These acceptor sites may 
be SEI industrial affiliates, government agencies, or any other organization interested in using and 
reporting on the Kernel. Initially, these sites will be involved only in testing and evaluating the Kernel. 
Eventually, they may use the Kernel in their own applications. One acceptor site, Westinghouse Electric 
Corporation, has assigned a resident affiliate to the SEI to work with the DARK project team. Their 
affiliate will learn about the Kernel and take that information back to Westinghouse after leaving the SEI. 
A goal for Westinghouse is to use the Kernel in one of their applications. 

The acceptor sites will receive two versions of the Kernel for the first target and one version of the Kernel 
for the second target. (Target describes a specific hardware computer architecture.) The first version of 
the Kernel for the first target, the beta version, will be released as soon as system acceptance testing is 
completed. There are two purposes for this beta version release (1) to introduce the Kernel to interested 
users and (2) to obtain feedback from Kernel users at an early stage. 

The second version of the Kernel for the first target, the official version, will be distributed after the formal 
demonstration of the Kernel is complete. The official version of the Kernel will correct errors and 
deficiencies found both in preparing for formal demonstration and in beta release feedback. 

The Kernel for the second target will be released in one beta version. This beta version will be released 
after testing and benchmarking are completed on the second target. 

The second part of the DARK transition strategy focuses on the recruitment and selection of one or more 
product affiliates to take the Kernel and turn it into a commercial product. Companies that the SEI 
determines to have the necessary experience and knowledge will be recruited to become potential 
product affiliates for DARK. Of those recruited, the SEI will select a few companies to become product 
affiliates. The number of product affiliates will be based on the SEI's ability to provide active support to 
each of the affiliates. The product affiliates will then be expected to execute their best effort to develop, 
market, support, and enhance the Kernel. The SEI will provide direct support to these product affiliates 
for six months.

1.3 Contract Deliverables 

The official project deliverables are: 

• Kernel implementation report (renamed the Final Kernel Acquisition Report and User 
Manual) 

• Final report 

While the DARK Project is not a project documented in accordance with formal government standards 
(i.e., MIL-STD-2167A), it does intend to produce an artifact, support software, and a set of documentation 
that could be turned into a supportable product. The items are as follows: 

Artifact and Support Software 

• Kernel software. 

• Kernel Test Software. This software includes: 

1. Processor integrity test suite (PITS) 

2. Network integrity test suite (NITS) 

3. Kernel integrity test suite (KITS) 

4. Application integrity test suite (AITS). The AITS is the Inertial Navigation System 
(INS) distributed across a network and modified to report performance data. The INS 
was originally developed by the Real-Time Embedded Systems Testbed Project 
(REST) and will be modified for DARK. 

• Tool Interface. This allows building tools that interface directly to DARK.

Transition Plan 


Distributed Ada Real-Time Kernel 


Version 1.0 


2 TRANSITION STRATEGY 

2.1 State of the Practice 

Ada is now mandated for a large number of DoD development projects as the sole programming 
language. Many of these projects are building distributed real-time systems. Many project managers and 
contractors are anxious to support this effort, to reap the advantages of Ada, and to use the newer 
techniques of software engineering that Ada can support. However, this transition has not always been 
smooth, and some serious problems have surfaced. 

One of the most persistent and worrying problems is the suitability of the Ada runtime system, most 
notably the tasking features, on distributed systems. There are also issues concerning functionality, 
amply documented by the Ada Real-Time Environment Working Group (ARTEWG); issues of 
customization; issues of tool support, especially target debuggers and performance monitors; issues of 
inter-process communication and code distribution; and perhaps, most intractable, issues of efficiency in 
execution time. 

Most organizations are on the brink of deciding how to take to solve these problems. They have a 
number of choices: they can try to develop their own solution to this problem; they can try to buy a 
solution from a third party company; or they can try to postpone the decision until Ada 9X is released. 
Ada 9X is the proposed revision to Ada which may or may not include new features. As such, Ada 9X 
may contain some solutions to the distributed and real-time problems. However, Ada 9X will not be 
available until at least the mid 1990s, so only the first two are viable near term options. 

2.2 Transition Objective 

The transition objective of the DARK Project’s is to reduce the risks for the MCCR community in adopting 
Ada for real-time distributed systems by providing them with a proven software Kernel that could be used 
as a focus for discussion of technical issues, as a basis for an individual MCCR community member's 
own distributed application, or as a product distributed and maintained by a product affiliate. 

2.3 Potential Impact 

There are at least three potential impacts of the DARK Project. 

1. The use of the process of designing, reviewing, implementing, testing, and evaluating 
DARK as a focus for discussion of technical issues. This discussion could lead to other 
solutions of the Ada distributed/tasking problem. While DARK is not to be viewed as the 
only answer, its development can contribute to the process of solving Ada’s 
distributed/tasking problems. 

2. The savings in development costs that can be realized when members of the MCCR 
community use the Kernel as a basis for their own implementations. 

3. The overall development and maintenance costs for the MCCR community can be reduced 
for many users if the Kernel is taken over and maintained by a product affiliate. The later 
impacts are more difficult, but will also produce a greater reward

2.4 Expected Results 

The DARK artifact will provide individual users one way to produce reliable and efficient real-time 
distributed systems written in Ada. Several results are possible from this project. On the near end of the 
spectrum, the DARK Project could result in increased discussions of Ada on real-time distributed 
systems. In the middle of the spectrum, the DARK Project can result in the adoption of all or portions of 
the Kernel in a contractor's actual delivered system. On the far end, the DARK Artifact can continue to 
exist as an independent entity maintained by product affiliates. All of these are positive contributions 
toward solving Ada's distributed/tasking problems. 


2.5 Transition Mechanisms 

• Demonstration (proof of concept). The SE' proves the validity of the design by implementing 
the Kernel on two targets. 

• Distributed 68020 target. The SEI is currently developing the Kernel to run on a 
system of distributed 66020 microprocessors. 

• Distributed RISC processor target. The SEI plans to port to this additional target once 
development on the first 68020 target is completed. Westinghouse and the SEI will 
select the processor for this port jointly, as stated in the SEI/Westinghouse 
memorandum of understanding (MOU). Westinghouse will assume the leading role, 
with the goal of achieving mutual benefit from the selection. 

This mechanism is the responsibility of the DARK project team. 

• Publications. These include conference papers and magazine articles both in professional 
journals such as Ada Letters (SigAda) and in trade journals such as Electronics, Defense 
Computing, and Defense Electronics. This mechanism is the responsibility of the DARK 
transition engineer with support from the DARK project team. 

• Document Review. The DARK project team and the DARK transition engineer will 
encourage review and comment by knowledgeable people both inside and outside the SEI 
This not only develops the community’s awareness of DARK but also provides important 
feedback to the project. However, to be credible, the project team must be willing to respond 
to the comments, including the effort to actually change the Kernel or its documentation. 

• Education. As one of the first software development projects at the SEI, the DARK project 
team has spent considerable effort developing proposed generic software development 
plans, design/coding style guides, and other basic development documentation. The DARK 
project team and Transition Training can set up courses to teach the methodology and 
standards developed by DARK for use on other projects. This also can increase DARK’S 
visibility within the SEI. 

• Announcement. The DARK transition engineer sends announcements of Kernel availability 
and results to a large body of users via electronic mail and standard mail and to publication 
media via press releases. All press releases will be cleared through the SEI JPO before 
distribution. 

• Workshop. The DARK transition engineer and the DARK project team will conduct a 
workshop on details of implementation results for interested parties. 

• Recruitment and selection. The DARK transition engineer, with support from the DARK 
project team, will recruit companies to become potential product affiliates. Through a 
structured evaluation process the DARK transition engineer and the DARK project team will 
select one or more companies to become product affiliates to take over long-term DARK 
support. The number of product affiliates selected will be based on the SEI’s ability to 
provide active support to each. 

• Software Distribution. Actual distribution of tne software artifact to various organizations for

examination and trial will do much to increase DARK’S visfcifity, Good reports from these 
organizations will also increase DARK’S credibility. The software distribution will be 
conducted by the DARK project team.

Transition Plan 


Distributed Ada Real-Time Kernel 


Version 1.0 


A general request for potentially interested parties in real-time Ada kernels on the SEI bulletin board is 
expected to bring in additional contacts. Presentation at additional conferences, especially ones 
emphasizing Ada, may bring in additional contacts. The DARK transition engineer should conduct market 
analysis, with support from the DARK project team, to determine who are the most likely acceptor sites 
(those who may use the Kernel in their systems) or product affiliates (those who may wish to market 
DARK as an independent entity) in the group, and the transition effort should concentrate on them. 
These parties and all other interested parties will receive all announcements and requests for reviews 
concerning DARK. 

2.7 Context Analysis 
MCCR Community 

There are a number of companies in the MCCR community who are attempting to deal with some part or 
all of the Ada real-time distributed problem. The SEI's effort is unique in that it is a fresh look at the 
problem which attempts to incorporate the best thinking on the subject. The SEI is also unique in that it is 
not constrained by needing to be compatible with an existing product. Therefore, the SEI can develop an 
independent solution that can be suitable for many users. 

A critical problem is the lack of long-term support for DARK. The SEI currently has no plans to support 
DARK as a long-term, maintained, configuration-controlled item. However, most potential users have 
stated that without this long-term support, they cannot justify using DARK. Unless the SEI is able to find 
at least one product affiliate to take over the support of DARK, it is unlikely to have long-term success. 

Another perceived problem is the need for fault-toleration and dynamic reconfiguration support. This 
issue was raised at the CDR. This support is beyond the scope of the DARK Project, except for some 
investigation of the problem as mentioned in the DARK Project Plan. A follow-on project by any party will 
have to include inis support. Although, technically, providing this support is a difficult problem. 

The lack of any support for data reliability or data security in the Kernel is another problem. This is a 
critical need of users in the MCCR community. Product development of the Kernel would have to meet 
this need. 

The entire process of designing and implementing an important piece of software like DARK, with 
participation of the MCCR community, is a valuable exercise. It has provided a forum in which to discuss 
a wide variety of technical issues relating to Ada tasking, distribution, and scheduling. This important 
contribution deserves special attention. 

SEI 

While the transition of this project to the MCCR community is this plan's primary concern, the benefits that 
the SEI receives cannot be overlooked. DARK is the first software development project performed at the 
SEI that has gone through, or will go through, all the stages of requirements analysis, design, 
implementation, testing, and installation. Documents and practices resulting from DARK may be of value 
to other SEI software development projects.

Transition Plan 


Distributed Ada Real-Time Kernel 


Version 1.0 


Westlnghouse 

Westinghouse will take the lead in selecting the RISC processor for the second target, and assist in 
getting the DARK Artifact and the sample application, the Inertial Navigation System (INS), operating on 
that target at the SEI. This is only to be a demonstration system. The use of the Kernel on any real 
programs will depend on how well DARK performs, how well suited it is for Westinghouse applications, 
and how well it is sold. Publicity efforts within Westinghouse are crucial. 

Emphasis must be placed on ensuring that enough of the information derived from Westinghouse is 
available to publicize DARK to the MCCR community. Details will be required if any other organization is 
expected to accept the results. Westinghouse must commit to allowing their evaluations of both the 
68020 and RISC ports at the SEI to be publicly available. 

Product Affiliates 

The question for the product affiliate will be, "why spend resources on developing DARK when anyone 
can get the SEI version for free?" The answer comes from experience with government provided 
software packages. A government funded Jovial J73 compiler has been available from the Embedded 
Computer System Program Office at Wright-Patterson AFB for some time. Yet most major programs 
have chosen to purchase a compiler from a commercial software house. These software houses use the 
government funded compiler as a base then add their own special features and provide support. It is the 
extra value added by the software houses that makes the compiler truly useable. This will be true for 
DARK as well. Companies will purchase DARK from a product affiliate because of the extra features 
added and the support provided. 

2.8 Success Criteria 

This project will be a success if DARK helps the MCCR community find ways to solve its current 
difficulties with distributed real-time systems using Ada. One measure of success will be that at least two 
contractor/users adopt and use the Kernel in a system. (These contractor/users will first be acceptor 
sites, and then actually use DARK in a real application.) Another measure will be that at least one 
product affiliate adopt the Kernel, turn it into a product, and market it to the MCCR community. A third 
measure will be that a contractor/user adopt all or portions of DARK in an actual delivered system. A 
fourth measure will be if the general discussion of the issues brought up by DARK leads to other solutions 
to the problems. A final measure will be that some of the features of DARK find their way into the Ada 9X 
considerations. All of these outcomes can help solve the original problem. 

Also as mentioned in section 2.7, the mere act of going through the process of developing the Kernel with 
MCCR community cooperation is of benefit to the MCCR community and the SEI. The MCCR community 
will have a clearer sense cf the technical issues involving the Ada real-time distributed systems. 

The progress of the technology transition to Westinghouse will be measured at three- and six-month 
points from the beginning of the schedule in Figure 2. The effectiveness of the overall technology 
transition will also be measured. This information will be used to modify the execution of this technology 
transition plan.

2.9 Risk Analysis 
MCCR Community 

There are two ways the MCCR community comes in contact with DARK. The first contact is participating 
in the review and discussion of the DARK project. There are no risks from this level of involvement. The 
second contact is attempting to use DARK in an application. The major risk from this contact is that 
DARK becomes unsupported by the SEI and no other organization is set up to provide support. A 
company would be forced either to abandon its investment in DARK or pick up the support itself. 

The risk reduction strategy for the MCCR community is for the SEI to recruit, select, and support one or 
more product affiliates to provide long term support for DARK. Unless long-term support is available, no 
member for the MCCR community will take the risk of using DARK in an application. 

SEI 

The risk to the SEI is that DARK turns out not to be an effective solution to the Ada real-time distributed 
problem. This risk is reduced by extensive MCCR community reviews and commitment by the DARK 
Project Team to fully evaluate the DARK design at each stage of the development process. 

Westinghouse 

The risk to Westinghouse is that they will not be able to use DARK in any of their applications and 
therefore will have gotten little return from their investment of sending a resident affiliate to the SEI. The 
risk reduction strategy for this problem is to find a Westinghouse application candidate as soon as 
possible. The early identification will allow DARK’S implementation to be influenced by the selected 
application and increase the probability that the application and DARK will be compatible. 

Product Affiliate 

The first risk to the product affiliate is that once they have invested the time and effort in making DARK a 
supportable product, potential customers will go to the SEI and get the DARK Kernel for free. This, 
however, is not a serious risk since it is unlikely that any member of the MCCR community could make 
use of DARK in an unsupported state. 

The second risk is that too many of product affiliates are selected by the SEI and the market for the DARK 
Kernel cannot support the number of vendors. This risk is real but will be reduced by the fact that the SEI 
can provide direct support to a limited number of product affiliates due to the SEI's resource constraints.

3 TRANSITION PLAN - General Transition Efforts 


3.1 Trans'tion Activities 


1. Conduct the proof of concept program internally, with Westinghouse and other acceptor 
sites. This will include the distribution of all versions of the DARK Kernel. These are the 
beta and official versions of the Kernel for the first target and the beta version of the Kernel 
for the second target. The detailed schedule for Kernel releases is contained in the project 
schedule, Appendix I. 

Data will be collected from that program to evaluate the performance of the Kernel. The 
evaluation of the data will be used to support the continuation of the DARK Project, to 
validate the transition approach, and to support presentations to other organizations. 

The DARK project team, the DARK transition engineer, and the Westinghouse resident 
affiliate will perform this activity. The actual release and distribution of versions of the 
DARK Kernel are the responsibility of the DARK project team. This activity includes all the 
activities of section 4.1. 

2. Continue to publicize the activities of the DARK Project through reviews of its documents 
and announcements of its results. Invite interested parties to formal reviews and 
demonstrations as if they were a paying customer. This is a continuing activity whose 
intermediate milestones are undetermined, and is the responsibility of the transition 
engineer with support from the DARK project team. 

3. Make an industry-wide announcement about the availability of the Kernel toward the end of 
system integration testing. Potential interested parties can attend the formal demonstration. 
This is a way to solicit both potential acceptor sites and product affiliates. This activity is the 
responsibility of the transition engineer, and this task is dependent on completion of the final 
acceptance review. 

4. Write and release an "announcement of product development opportunity" (APDO) package 
to allow potential product affiliates to submit a Product Development Proposal to be a SEI- 
supported product affiliate. This activity is the responsibility of the transition engineer with 
support from the DARK project team. The package will be released when the first target 
demonstration is complete and, when the SEI JPO approves this transition plan and the 
APO package 

5. Prepare and conduct a workshop on the details of the design, implementation, testing, and 
results of the DARK Project. Work at bringing the largest possible number of potential 
users to the workshop. Especially concentrate on potential product affiliates. The technical 
content of this workshop is the responsibility of the DARK Project Team. The logistics of 
the workshop is the responsibility of the Transition Engineer. The workshop will occur after 
the APO package is released. 

6. Write an evaluation guide to describe and control the process of evaluating and selecting at 
least one product affiliate. The transition engineer will perform this task. 

7. Potential product affiliates will prepare bids in the form of Product Development Proposals 
to be a product affiliate. 

8. Select at least one SEI-supported product affiliate via a criteria-based formal evaluation 
process. The transition engineer will have responsibility for this task. The DARK project 
team, SEI Business Services and SEI Technology Transition will provide support. 

9. Work with the selected product affiliates to take over the Kernel and make it a commercial 
product. These affiliates will receive support from SEI until the transition point. The SEI 
support will consist of the equivalent of one person half-time to aid the product affiliates'

understanding of the details of the Kernel. Once the transition point is reached, the product 
will be the responsibility of the product affiliate. The DARK project team and the transition 
engineer will share responsibility for this task. 


3.2 Schedule 

See Figure 1. For complete DARK Project Team schedule, see appendix 1. 


3.3 Resources Required 

This portion of the plan requires one third of a member of the Technology Transition staff to perform the 
activities in Figure 1 during the period from May 23,1988 to January 15,1990. Support from the DARK 
project team is required, in addition to their activities scheduled already, to support transition to the 
product affiliate. The loading from the DARK project team to support this portion of the technology 
transition plan is one-half of a person from app r oximately July 12,1989 to January 15,1990.

4 TRANSITION PLAN - Westinghouse 


* 


4.1 Transition Activities 

1. SEI will provide all current DARK documentation to Westinghouse to distribute to interested 
parties at their Baltimore site and throughout Westinghouse. This task will be performed 
throughout the project. 

2. The Westinghouse resident affiliate will write a memo for broad distribution within 
Westinghouse, advertising future availability of the Kernel. The memo will request interested 
parties contact the Westinghouse resident affiliate for more detailed information. The DARK 
project team, and SEI Technology Transition will coordinate on the drafting of the 
Westinghouse memo. 

3. From list of interested parties and other potential projects within Westinghouse, the market 
will be analyzed to determine the most likely users of the Kernel. Analysis will be conducted 
by the Westinghouse resident affiliate, Westinghouse management, the DARK project 
team, and SEI Technology Transition. 

4. A briefing about DARK will be given by the DARK project team, the Westinghouse resident 
affiliate, and SEI Technology Transition to likely DARK users at Westinghouse. Potential 
users will be asked to comment on materials received and the briefing. Technical 
interchanges will be conducted between potential users and the DARK project team to 
determine strengths and weaknesses of the Kernel’s design, with potential impact on further 
Kernel design and implementation. 

5. Both parties will jointly review the progress of the transition activity at the three- and six- 
month points from the start of this transition plan. The subject of the review will be the 
technical progress and the progress of the technology transition for the DARK Project. 

6. Westinghouse and the SEI will select the second target according to the understandings in 
the SEI/Westinghouse MOU. The SEI will then procure the hardware and the Ada compiler. 
Westinghouse will procure or produce a hardware system with the same processor as that 
in the SEI procured hardware. 

7. The DARK project team will transfer the beta release of the first target of the Kerne! to 
Westinghouse. The packaging of this release is the responsibility of the DARK project team 
and must include a current KUM. 

8. The DARK project team with the support of the Westinghouse resident affiliate, will port the 
Kernel and the INS to the second target. 

9. Once the first DARK formal demonstration is completed, the DARK project team will 
transport demonstration equipment to Westinghouse site for an in-house demonstration. 
The Westinghouse resident affiliate will encourage participation of potential users. 

10. The DARK project team will transfer the Kernel and the INS to Westinghouse once testing 
of the second target is completed. The release packaging is the responsibility of the DARK 
project team. The packaging must include an updated KUM. 

11. Westinghouse and the SEI will prepare and conduct a formal demonstration at 
Westinghouse of the RISC-based system when the implementation is completed. 

12. Westinghouse will evaluate the second target and write a report, with SEI technical support, 
to assess the Kernel’s portability, functionality, efficiency, hardware independence, compiler 
independence, documentation quality, and lessons learned. Westinghouse will distribute 
test results and reports to potential Westinghouse users and to SEI for further distribution. 

13. Westinghouse will adapt or develop an application that uses the Kernel, assuming a 
positive assessment of the Kernel port to the second target. This task will be governed by 
Westinghouse discretion, adaptability of Westinghouse applications, and funding

constraints. Ideally, performing this task as early as possible is a more successful result of 
the SEI/Westinghouse affiliation. A Westinghouse application will be searched for once the 
beta release of the first target is released. 

4.2 Schedule 

See figure 2. 

4.3 Resources Required 

A resident affiliate from Westinghouse is required to execute this plan. The resident affiliate will be part- 
time (2 days, every other week) from June 1988 to September 1988. From September 1988 to 
September 1989, the resident affiliate will be full-time.
