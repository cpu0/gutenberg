The KAMA! Report 

Issue Number 5 July, 1985 



IN THIS ISSUE 

We have been unbelievably busy since the 
last issue of the KAMAS Report went out. 
See the "In the News" section for the scoop 
on the frenzied spring. With summer just 
around the corner, it's time to cool down a 
bit and get back in touch. Here's an 
overview of what's included in this issue.

IN THE NEWS 

A new version is released—earlier than 
planned. A re-christening occurs. And 
more. In the news. 



A Rose by Any Other Name? 

If you've seen our recent ads or if you've 
contacted us recently, you have probably 
already noticed that we've changed our 
company name. Our new name, KAMASOFT, 
is easier to pronounce and easier to spell 
than the old tongue twister — Compusophic 
Systems. These days, I only have to tell 
people that it starts with a K instead of a C 
and they can pretty well guess the rest of 
it. KAMASOFT also sounds less arcane and 
has more of a recognition factor since it's 
based on our product name. 



Version U2 

Perhaps the biggest news since last time is 
the release of a new version of KAMAS. We 
had already been working on Version 1.2 
when Kaypro Corp. came out with the New 2 
(a single drive version of the Kaypro 2X). At 
the same time, they changed their CP/M 
operating system to a new version (2.2u) on 
their entire line of CP/M computers. To

5-1 



our surprise (and dismay) we learned that 
KAMAS Version 1.1 would not work with the 
new Kaypro operating system. 

Finding out about this problem was all the 
encouragement that we needed to finish up 
work on Version 1.2 of KAMAS which runs 
on virtually any CP/M computer (including 
the Kaypro CP/M 2.2u machines). The only 
real snag in the whole scenario was that we 
had to start shipping before we could 
formally announce the new version. (Our 
first units were shipped May 17). Oh well. 
Better late with the announcement than 
announcing too far in advance and creating 
the notorious VAPORWARE ... 

The biggest change in Version 1.2 is that 
KAMAS can now be installed on 
practically any Z80 computer with 64K of 
RAM, CP/M 2.2 or above, 200K of disk 
storage, and an 80 col x 24 line ASCII 
terminal with direct cursor addressing. We 
have reports of the new version working on 
the Apple and Frankln Ace with a wide 
variety of CP/M cards and the IBM PC with 
the Baby Blue card. We even hear that it's 
working on a TurboDos system. TurboDos 
is a CP/M look-a-like that runs on 
CompuPro computers and other S-100 
systems. 

About 15 machines are listed on the main 
install menu. If you have one of these 
systems, installation is a snap. You just 
select your computer, specify the disk 
drives that are available, and tell KAMAS if 
you want a Perfect Writer or Wordstar style 
editor. Then, you're done. All the 
computers that were available on 1.1 of 
KAMAS (Kaypro, Morrow, Epson, Osborne, 
Zorba, Xerox, and Lobo) are on the main 
machine menu. If your computer is not 
listed on the main menu, you can still 
install KAMAS by answering a few prompts 
about your system. 



How to Order Version 1.2 

Version 1.2 of KAMAS is available as an 
upgrade to registered customers only. If 
you purchased Version 1.1 of KAMAS (or 
even 1.0) prior to April 11, you can order the 



update for #30.00. The update includes a 
55-page manual, two reference cards (one for 
Perfect Writer style editor and the other for 
Wordstar style editor), and a disk with the 
new software on it. If you purchased an 
older version of KAMAS after April 11, 
1985, you can order the update for #15.00. 

Both prices include shipping which is by 
First Class Mail. 

When you order, please specify the serial 
number of your older version and the name 
under which it is registered. If you did not 
purchase directly from us and you think you 
are eligible for the half-price deal, please 
include a copy of your sales receipt showing 
that you purchased after April 11. If you 
purchased direct from us, we use the 
shipping date on your invoice to determine 
if you are eligible for the half-price 
update. 



What's New in L2 

Most of the changes in Version 1.2 are in the 
Outline Editor. Many functions that could 
previously be done only in ROVE mode are 
now available in the Outline Editor. You 
can now do most of the Show commands 
(Show View, Show Focus, etc.), most of the 
Query Commands, Format Commands, Print 
Commands, and Output to File Commands in 
the Outline Editor. You can mount new 
topics in the Outline Editor. You can Jex 
stems that contain KAMAS programs from 
the Outline Editor. And you can now exit to 
CP/M from the Outline Editor. 

In the Leaf Editor, you can reformat a 
paragraph. A new command allows you to 
exit from the Leaf and save the leaf all in 
one step. And the CTRL-T (CTRL-O in 
Wordstar configured editors) which splits 
the leaf now prompts before continuing to 
create a new stem. 

In ROVE mode, the changes are in the View 
commands, the Status command, and the 
Format Margins command. SV and QV now 
behave like the View command on Utility 
Disk 1; both commands show a smaller 
neighborhood of surrounding keys. The 



5-2 



* 1985 KAMASOFT, Inc., P.O. Box 5549, ALoha, Oregon 97007 



Status command (TS) now shows the current 
key and the available drives are shown in 
search order with the default drive first. 
The Format Margins command Q?M) now 
shows the old margin values before 
prompting for new values. 

The corresponding VIEW and STATUS 
commands in the language are changed 
similar to their ROVE mode counterparts. 

You also get two reference cards for ROVE 
mode, the Outline Editor, and the Leaf 
Editor. 



What's No Longer In 1.2 

We have taken a few commands out of the 
KAMAS language. The majority of the 
commands that we removed are machine 
specific, so taking them out allows a wider 
variety of computers to run KAMAS. 

The SETDRIVES command in the KAMAS 
programming language is no longer included 
in Version 1.2. Older versions of KAMAS 
were preconfigured for specific computers, 
and the number of disk drives available was 
fixed according to the machine. If you had 
added a RAM Disk or a Hard Disk, you could 
use SETDRIVES to inform KAMAS about the 
added drives. Now, in Version 1.2, you 
define the drives available when you install 
KAMAS, so SETDRIVES is no longer 
needed. An article later in this issue tells 
how you can change the available drives 
without re-installing KAMAS. 

The SETBAUD command in the KAMAS 
programming language is no longer 
available. This command is machine 
specific and its definition varies from 
computer to computer depending on the type 
of RS-232 serial port installed in the 
system. We hope to publish examples of 
SETBAUD for a variety of computers in 
future issues of the newsletter and/or on 
future utility disks. 

The telecommunications commands in the 
KAMAS programming language no longer 
work unless you are able to configure for 



telecom during installation. The telecom 
commands are: 

WCRCV, WCXMT, RECEIVE?, 
TERMINAL, TOGREMOTE, 
REMOTEGO, REMOTEVIOL 

The SYSTOPIC that comes with Version 1.2 
has been reduced in size to about 50K. This 
allows us to distribute KAMAS on a single 
floppy with as little as 126K available. 
Most of the abend help screens for the 
programming language have been removed. 
These screens are printed in Chapter 17 of 
the User's Guide. The JEX LEAFS branch has 
also been removed except for the AUTOJEX 
leaf. The KAMASBBS bulletin board 
application has been removed. The 
KAMASBBS application has some machine 
dependencies. Also, the version that was in 

1.1 of KAMAS needs some changes to work 
with 1.2 of KAMAS. We hope to provide 
working versions of KAMASBBS for specific 
machines on upcoming Utility Disks. 

All of the things that we took out of 
SYSTOPIC are going to be included on 
future Utility Disks for people that do not 
have the earlier versions. But if you 
already have an older version of KAMAS, 
you won't need this. Topic files from 
earlier versions are compatible with Version 

1.2 so just use your old SYSTOPIC if you 
need this material. 



Utility Disks 1, 2, and 3 

Utility Disk 1 no longer contains the 
KAMAS LANGUAGE topic. It currently has 
the UTILITIES topic only containing 
utility programs. KAMAS LANGUAGE is 
now on Utility Disk 2. We made this change 
so that we could reduce the files down to a 
size that would fit on floppy with 126K or 
less. That way we can distribute it to 
anyone who can run KAMAS. 

Utility Disk 2 is now available. It is a 
programmer's documentation disk. It 
contains the KAMAS LANGUAGE topic, an 
online document that describes the 
programming commands. It also contains 



• 1985 KAMASOFTf Inc., P.O. Box 5549, ALoha, Oregon 97007 5-3 



the help screens that we removed from 
SYSTOPIC for Version 1.2. These help 
screens are primarily error messages for the 
programming language abends. If you have 
KAMAS 1.1 or 1.0 and you have the early 
version of Utility Disk 1, you don f t need 
this. You will find it redundant with files 
you already have. 

Utility Disk 3 is now available. It is the 
latest update to UTILITIES. TOP that was 
originally released on Utility Disk 1. This 
latest version is meant to replace the earlier 
one. There are some bug fixes, but there are 
not really any new features. The difference 
is in how you run the programs in the 
UTILITIES topic. Now, you access those 
programs through MENU mode instead of 
loading all the programs at once when 
KAMAS initializes. You still access the 
utilities using the U command at the ROVE: 
prompt. The old way of loading the 
programs took quite a long time especially 
if you were running on floppies. The new 
way loads programs as you need them and is a 
little faster and more convenient. Utility 
Disk 3 also contains the Jex Leafs that we 
removed from SYSTOPIC. These leafs 
primarily contain program examples 
described in the User's Guide. 



Pricing and Policy on Utility Disks 

Utility Disks are Public Domain. This means 
that if you can find someone who has a 
Utility Disk and they will let you copy it, 
you can get the disk free. If you get the 
Utility Disk from us, we charge a modest fee 
to cover our costs in producing the disks 
and shipping them to you. 

There are two prices for Utility Disks: one 
for purchasing Utility Disks separately and 
the other for purchasing Utility Disks with 
some other order, e.g., with KAMAS or with a 
KAMAS update. 

Purchase Utility Disks Separately: 

#10.00 for first Utility Disk on an order 

# 5.00 for each additional disk included 

on the same order 

Purchase with KAMAS System or Update: 

# 5.00 for each Utility Disk included on 

the order 



On the disks that contain programs, we 
include a User's Guide topic that describes 
the programs on the disk. You can print the 
User's Guide topic to get printed 
documentation. Most of the material 
included on the disks is supplied by KAMAS 
users who are running it on their machines. 
We also test it as much as possible before 
including it on a disk. If you find a bug on 
a utility disk, we would appreciate learning 
about it, and we'll correct it the next time 
we update the program involved. 



Other News 

Since the last issue of the newsletter, 
articles on KAMAS have continued to appear 
in national publications as well as local 
area newsletters. The March issue of the 
Epson Connection contained a review of 
KAMAS. The March issue of KUGRAM also 
contained a review. The May issue of 
Personal Computing had an article about 
Outline Processors in which KAMAS was 
prominently featured. And the June 
Personal Computing had an article on CP/M 
software which also discussed KAMAS. 



FOCUS ON OUTLINE PROCESSING 

Here is a tip that you might find useful from 
Jim Newell. 



Recovering from a TOODENSE Abend 

Another jewel from Newell. This time Jim 
wrote in to offer a tip on recovering from a 
TOODENSE abend. This tip is one I wish I 
had known about several times. 



If you are like me, you are stingy with disk 
space. I tend to make my topics too small 
and fill them until they crash. 

When you save a leaf with ESC S, and you get 
the dreaded TOODENSE abend, go to the top 
of the leaf and use ESC M to mark the 
beginning. Then, go to the end and use ESC 
W to put the leaf into the swap buffer and 



5-4 



• 1985 KAMASOFT, Inc., P.O. Box 5549, Atoha, Oregon 97007 



erase the leaf. Then, use ESC S (in Version 
1.2 you can also use ESC Q) to save the now 
empty leaf. 

Next, delete the key for the stem that just 
overflowed. This may give you enough 
space to go to another title in the topic and 
save the leaf that's in the swap buffer with 
ESC Y (ESC U if you have configured for 
Wordstar). Or switch to some other topic that 
has some free space and save the swap buffer 
there. 

Now, you can resize with TCOPY or the 
branch copy in AUX ROVE. 

Finally, go to the stem where you 
temporarily stored the leaf you were 
working on and use ESC M and ESC W again 
to get that leaf back into the leaf buffer. 
Now, move the leaf back into your original 
topic and its original title. 

Thanks, Jim. I know that one can be of use 
to lots of people. 

FOCUS ON WORD PROCESSING 

Wordstar users will find some useful hints 
in this section. Also, there are some tips on 
printing outlines. 

Wordstar Users 

The Wordstar file output option on Utility 
Disk 1 allows you to convert a topic file to 
a Wordstar document file. It requires that 
every stem in the topic being converted to 
be marked either full or left justify. You 
can accomplish the formatting easily in 
Version 1.2 in the Outline Editor with the 
ESC F T option. Here's a tip that comes 
from Lucian Minor to format the entire 
topic automatically during the conversion. 

Mount the UTILITIES topic and go to the 
key OUTLINE OUT. Edit the leaf of this 
stem and find the line: 

FILENAME STUC START LOG .IFSO 

Just above this line insert the following 
line: 

9WSFLAG IFSO GT LOOP MARKUUST GF ? END LINK 
UNTILT .LOOP .IFSO GT 



Then, when you output the topic to a 
Wordstar document file, the entire topic is 
formatted automatically. 



Reading in Wordstar Files 

Note that when you use the FINPUTJOB to 
read in the Wordstar document files, the 
print control characters embedded in the 
file CPH) are dropped. These characters 
have no meaning within a KAMAS topic and 
they can cause problems in some cases when 
you are later editing the text. 



Printing Topics and Outlines 

Two notes about printing outlines. First, 
when you use the OO output option in ROVE 
mode, you don't get a blank line after the 
title prints. If you want a blank, you have 
to insert it as the first line of the leaf. 
However, don't insert a carriage return 
only. Instead, insert a spacebar and 
carriage return on the first line of the leaf. 

The other note about the OO option has to 
do with right margins. OO indents all the 
levels of your outline on the printout. If 
you have a lot of levels, your lowest levels 
will be indented way over from the left 
margin (indentation is set at two spaces per 
level). This can cause the line to overflow 
the right printer margin. If the leaf is 
formatted, there will be no problem within 
your text. But the title is not affected by 
formatting. You have to make the low level 
titles short enough to fit on one line even 
when they are preceded by spaces from being 
indented. What happens when the title 
overflows? It depends on your printer. 
Some printers automatically print the 
leftover title on the next line. Then, the 
line count will be off by one and your page 
breaks won't be correct. KAMAS counts the 
title as one line even though the printer 
might use two. Other printers truncate the 
left-over title and the page breaks are OK 
but the title is clipped. The best solution 
is to watch the size of these lower level 
titles if you are going to use OO to print the 
outline.

Printing Leafs Only 

Robert Dclapaz sent in this useful set of 
commands to print only the leafs without 
any titles. You can type these commands 
into a leaf and jex it to run the program. 
The first line shown below is the title of 
the stem and the following lines go in the 
leaf. The program outputs the leafs to a 
file or to the printer.

FROM USER GROUPS 

With our recent promotion and all the press 
coverage that we have been getting, KAMAS 
owners are becoming a large group. We have 
had numerous requests about user's groups. 
Some people are interested in joining them. 
Others are interested in forming them. 



Washington, DC Atea 

Honors for forming the first KAMAS User's 
Group go to Joe Cobb and the folks at the 
Capitol Kaypro User's Group (CKUG). They 
formed a KAMAS SIG in February. Anyone in 
the DC area (zip codes from 20001 through 
22399) is welcome and encouraged to join. 
It's not necessary to have the Kaypro 
version of KAMAS to join. Any version 
will do. Contact Joe Cobb at 202/547-6622 
from 8:00 pm to 11:00 pm or from 8:00 am to 
4:00 pm. If you get an answering machine, 
leave your name, number, and address and 
Joe will be in touch. 

Attorneys 

We have had a lot of requests from attorneys 
who want to contact other attorneys using 
KAMAS. 



If anyone wants to serve as a focus point for 
a KAMAS Attorney's User Group, let us 
know and we'll publish your name and 
address in the next issue. 



Other Professions 

Forming KAMAS User Groups for specific 
professions sounds like a good idea. 

So, if any of you are interested in contacting 
other members of your profession who also 
use KAMAS, let us know and we'll publish 
your name and address too. 



Bulletin Boards and Artificial Intelligence 

Mike Sale of Glendale, California is 
interested in hearing from people with 
experience in setting up a Bulletin Board 
System using KAMAS. Contact Mike at 207 
W. Lomita, #216, Glendale, CA 91204. Phone 
(818) 502-0826. 

Mike is also interested in forming a Special 
Interest Group for Artificial Intelligence 
Applications in KAMAS. 



Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Sacramento 

We've had requests from people in all three 
of these areas about forming user groups. 
Anyone who would like to serve as a focal 
point in getting a group started, let us know 
and we'll publish your name, address, and 
phone number. From the calls we've had, I 
think there are enough interested parties to 
start a group in each of these areas. 

FROM THE SUPPORT LINE 

This section of the newsletter contains tips 
and notes based on support calls that we 
have received recently. 

Utility Disk 1 Notes 

If you are using Utility Disk 1 with KAMAS 
Version 1.2, here are a few things that you 
should take note of: 



5-6 



• 1985 KAMASOFT, Inc., P.O. Box 5549, ALoha, Oregon 97007 



1. The KAMASBBS that is on Utility 
Disk 1 works with Version 1.1. It 
requires modification to the 
NOCARRIER? command before it will 
work properly with Version 1.2. Also, 
you must write a SETBAUD command 
for your computer. We hope to 
include several SETBAUD commands 
for different systems on future 
Utility Disks. 

2. The Outline Output option on 
Utility Disk 1 does not obey the 
margin settings when you are 
outputting to a file. 

3. Don't install Utility Disk 1 with 
KAMAS Version 1.2. That is, don f t 
run the INSTALL command from 
Utility Disk 1. This command 
replaces the KAMAS AUTOJEX with 
a new leaf that loads the programs 
from the Utility Disk. Version 1.1 of 
KAMAS needed this replacement 
AUTOJEX. It's already built-in to 
Version 1.2. If you have already run 
INSTALL, you might want to replace 
your AUTOJEX leaf with the one 
from your original master to get the 
Version 1.2 AUTOJEX back. It's a 
better AUTOJEX than the one on the 
Utility Disk. 



Warning Note about Versions and Patches 

In the past, we have printed ways that you 
can patch KAMAS by changing its object 

files using the CP/M utility DDT. These 
patches apply only to the Versions 
specified. In most cases, a patch for 
Version 1.1 will not work in Version 1.2 and 
vice versa. 

The insides of KAMAS were changed 
drastically to make the installable version 
possible. This means that memory 
locations that once had initialization code 
for a modem no longer have that. If you 
change those same locations in Version 1.2, 
there is no telling what you are changing or 
how it may affect KAMAS. So don't patch 
the new 1.2 KAMAS.COM using patches in 
Issues 2-4 of The KAMAS Report. 



Newsletter Policy 

We've had a number of questions about the 
newsletter. Who gets it? How many do you 
get? And so on. Here's our policy. I hope 
this clarifies things a little. 

The current issue of the newsletter is 
included when you purchase KAMAS. 

Only registered users can get additional 
issues of the newsletter. You register by 
filling out and returning the registration 
card that comes with your disk. 

If you purchased Version 1.1 or 1.0, you get 
12 issues of The KAMAS Report included in 
your purchase. You can get back issues as 
part of your 12 issues if you want, or you 
can start the 12 issues with the time of your 
purchase. To get back issues, write a note 
on your registration card or drop us a post 
card requesting them if you already sent 
your registration card. 

If you purchased Version 1.2, you get one 
year of The KAMAS Report included in your 
purchase. The newsletter is not published 
on a regular schedule. It comes out roughly 
every quarter, so you get about 4 issues. 
For now, you can also get back issues by 
requesting them on your registration card. 

The stock on back issues is limited, so this 
back-issue policy will necessarily change in 
the future. You will know when it changes 
because the registration card will no longer 
have a box to check to receive back issues. 
We'll also announce the new back-issue 
policy in the newsletter. If your 
registration card says you can get back 
issues, we'll honor your request for back 
issues. 

USING SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT 

Here are a couple of items that will help if 
you are running keyboard macro software or 
if you want to change your disk drive setup 
within KAMAS. 

Keyboard Macros 

Many of you have written to tell us that you 
have been using some of the keyboard macro 
utility programs with KAMAS. 



® 1985 KAMAS0FT f Inc., P.O. Box 5549, Aloha, Oregon 97007 



5-7 



We have reports that the public domain 
program KSTROKES.COM works as well as 
SmartKey, Backgrounder, and XtraKey. 

With some of these programs, you must 
either confine your macro to a single line or 
insert a pause at certain points in the macro 
so that KAMAS gets enough time to process 
the command. 

Keyboard macros can be very useful within 
the leaf editor to add functions like moving 
the cursor ahead or back by more than one 
character. We even had reports of someone 
writing a paragraph reformat using a 
keyboard macro to issue sequences of leaf 
editor commands. Version 1.2 has the 
reformat built in but other additions sure 
could be helpful. 



Dynamically Changing your 

Drive Array after you 
Install Version L2 of KAMAS 

In Version 1.2 of KAMAS, the SETDRIVES 
command is no longer included. This 
command allowed you to change the disk 



drives that KAMAS was aware of while 
running KAMAS. Now, in Version 1.2, the 
disk drives are set up during installation. 
However, you can still change them within 
KAMAS using a program that is included on 
Utility Disk 3. The program is called 
SETDRIVES and it prompts you for a new 
drive array. It does not permanently 
change the KAMAS file and must be run each 
time you run KAMAS. If you need to 
permanently change the drive array, go back 
to your master disk and make a fresh copy of 
it and re-install KAMAS for your new 
drives. 

The SETDRIVES job is intended to make 
changes occasionally. For example, suppose 
you run KAMAS on the Morrow MD5 
computer. If you specify the floppy when 
you install KAMAS, you have to place a disk 
in drive B everytime that you run KAMAS. 
Normfftly, you want to use the hard disk and 
ignore the floppy drive B so you would not 
specify drive B during installation. But 
occasionally you may want to read a topic 
that is stored on the floppy. The 
SETDRIVES program works well for this 
purpose. It makes KAMAS aware of drive B 
for the session.
