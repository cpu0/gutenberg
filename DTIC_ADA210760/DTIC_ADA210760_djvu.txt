OBJECTIVE l. To develop numerical algorithms for parallel 
processing using the Ada language. 


Dr. Shantilal N. Shah studied LU Factorization algorithms in light 
of simulating a new algorithm in a parallel processing environment 
using Ada's tasking facilities to simulate this environment. His 
abstract to a paper "Modification of LU Factorization Algorithm for 
Parallel Processing Using Tasks Supported by Ada Language" (see 
bibliography) follows: 


An Algorithm to factor a given non-singular matrix 
A into two Lower and Upper matrices is modified so that 
the Lower triangular matrix can be computed by one task 
and the Upper triangular matrix can be computed by a 
second task, with both tasks running in parallel." 


Dr. Shah's work on simulating parallel algorithms is currently 
being utilized and expanded in a NASA research grant. 






OBJECTIVE 2. To develop new methodologies in reusing Ada 
software. 

Dr. George C. Harrison studied a automated code reuse system and 
has virtually completed a working prototype system to aid in the 
reuse and project integration of Ada source code. His abstract to 
the paper "AdaL, An Automated Code Reuse System" (see bibliography) 
follows: 


Under a United States Army grant we are developing a 
prototype software package to produce an automated Ada 
code reuse system supported by the language LIL to aid 
the Ada programmer/designer in choosing the appropriate 
Ada generic or ordinary package from a data base of 
reusable code and to automatically instantiate that code 
if it is generic. Our goal is to have reusable code 
chosen effectively WITHOUT actually examining Ada 
specification. By examining the semantics in the LIL 
files the programmer may choose the appropriate LIL file 
that corresponds to the specification and semantics 
needed in his or her Ada source. 


Dr. Harrison has used and disseminated portions of this AdaL tool 
to other researchers for their use. Appropriate designations in 
source are given to the Army Research Office. Dr. Harrison plans 
on extending this Ada reuse system, AdaL, into a more advanced CASE 
(Computer Assisted Software Engineering) tool. 


With student assistance Dr. Harrison has developed a comprehensive 
Ada to VMS interface for VMS Screen Management Guidelines of the 
VMS Run-time Library. 






-5- 


OBJECTIVE 3. To solve select problems in applied mathematics 
using MACSYMA and Ada. 


Dr. Sandra Deloatch because of other research and administrative 
commitments and because of a delay in obtaining the MACSYMA 
software has only completed preliminary work on this topic. 
However, other faculty in the Department of Mathematics and 
Computer Science, Drs. Philip McNeil and John Wiggs, are using 
MACSYMA, Ada and other software to expand their research and 
educational goals. 


Dr. Deloatch (and the others) is following up her objectives and 
findings and the experiences of others in the department into other 
research funding sources. 





- 6 - 


OBJECTIVE 4. To simulate the interactions of nodes in a network 
using Ada. 


Dr. Mou-Liang Kung has completed this research and has issued an 
extensive internal report "Simulation Testbed for Routing 
Algorithms" (see bibliography) with the following abstract: 


There are recent efforts in designing simulation 
facility for testing routing algorithms, such as that by 
P. Bell and K. Jabbour who used IBM PC and compiled 
BASIC. We selected Ada language on a twin CPU VAX 8350 
< to design and construct this testbed for routing 
algorithms. Our study showed that a simple experiment 
of 400 messages per hour of length 10,000 bits at all 
seven nodes in a network can take up to 9 CPU hours to 
conduct a one hour test run. When the random walk 
algorithm was used, the simulation ran for 2 CPU days. 
To yield all meaningful results, we must incorporate 
higher level protocols, the simulation time can become 
too time-consuming. Hence we believe that a parallel 
architecture combined with a parallel language such as 
Ada is more suitable to run large scale simulations of 
networking. 


Dr. Kung is following up this work with proposals for funding for 
an appropriate computational platform and software tools.

0BJECT1VE 5. To increase the cadre of educators available to 
provide Ada training by conducting Ada workshops for 
Norfolk State University and Staff. 


During the Summer of 1988 Dr. George Harrison conducted a two-week 
extensive workshop on Ada and Software Engineering. The following 
persons were the paid workshop participants: 


Dr. Richard O'Daniel, Associate Professor, Department of 
Management, School of Business 

Dr. William Spriggs, Assistant Professor, Department of Management, 
School of Business 

Mr. Charles Taylor, Associate Professor, Physics Program, 
Department of Chemistry, Physics, and Engineering, School or 
Health Related Professions, and Natural Sciences (HRPNS) 

Dr. Charlesworth Martin, Associate Professor, Engineering Program, 
Department of Chemistry, Physics, and Engineering, HRPNS 
Dr. Andrew Hargrove, Professor, Engineering Program, Department of 
Chemistry, Physics, and Engineering, HRPNS 
Dr. John Wiggs, Associate Professor, Mathematics Program, 
Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, HRPNS 
Mr. Mustaq Khan, Instructor, Mathematics Program, Department of 
Mathematics and Computer Science, HRPNS 
Ms. Jacquelyn Long, Assistant Professor, Computer Science Program, 
Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, HRPNS 
Ms. Deborah Chen, Instructor, Computer Science Program, Department 
of Mathematics and Computer Science, HRPNS 
Mr. Paul Hsiung, Instructor, Computer Science Program, Department 
of Mathematics and Computer Science, HRPNS 
Ms May Tsai Hou, Instructor, Computer Science Program, Department 
of Mathematics and Computer Science, HRPNS 
Mr. Mark Manes, Systems Manager, Academic Computing Unit 

Unpaid participants: 

Dr. Mou-Liang Kung, Associate Professor, Computer Science Program, 
Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, HRPNS 
Ms. Esther Lumsdon, CAI Assistant/Programmer, ReDTEA Project, 
Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, HRPNS 


The workshop was one of the best successes of the entire project. 
No fewer than six of the participants are using their expertise in 
Ada and software engineering in permanent and temporary DoD 
positions, DoD contracts, and other research.

OBJECTIVE 6. To develop a series of in-class and individualized 
modules addressing Ada programming using computer 
assisted instruction. 


Ms. Esther Lumsdon was hired as CAI Assistant/Programmer from May 
1988 through mid April 1989. She and Dr. George Harrison developed 
and maintained several class-assisted CAI modules. The primary 
source for the software purchased was ADA-TUTR, a shareware product 
from Dr. John Herro of Computer Innovations Technology. The use 
of this product was so successful that much of the work on direct 
class-assisted CAI products were postponed. Ms. Lumsdon, however, 
was assigned and completed a LRM (Ada Language Reference Manual) 
on-line reader. This software uses the LRM text files from the 
Army Simtel 20 Ada Repository. It can isolate chapters, sections, 
and paragraphs; view them; print them; etc. This software was 
written in Ada for VAX/VMS and for the PC using Meridian 
AdaVantage. It has been submitted to Simtel 20 for submission into 
the Ada Repository. Limited copies can be furnished upon request. 


We have purchased three PC Ada compilers (Janus R&R, ALSYS, and 
Meridian) for educational use and the ADA-TUTR Customization Kit 
to revise Dr. John Herro ADA-TUTR to make compiler-dependent 
versions of that tutorial. Work is still in progress on this by 
Dr. George Harrison. 


Dr. George Harrison is also working on CAI modules for graduate and 
continuing education courses in software engineering using the 
Software Engineering Institute's guidelines. This work is expected 
to continue under a National Science Foundation grant. 







-9- 


OBJECTIVE 7. To disseminate research results and CAI modules to 
other minority institutions through computer 
networking, workshops, and lecture series. 


The research in OBJECTIVES 1 and 2 have been presented at the 
Seventh Annual Conference on Ada Technology in March 1989. One of 
the primary foci of that conference is the dissemination of Ada and 
software engineer research at minority institutions. Copies of 
these papers had been deposited with Army Research Office as 
required, and appropriate credit was given ARO in them. The Herro 
ADA-TUTR and the LRM READER software is been made available to 
minority institutions and to anyone who asks for it up to the 
availability of our resources.

CONCLUSIONS 


HISTORY OF PROJECT: 


In February 1987 we were asked to present a proposal for 
approximately $400,000 to the United State Army for research and 
development initially in a consortium with two other Historically 
Black Universities (HBUs). Because we had Ada educators in the 
Department of Mathematics and Computer Science and because we felt 
that the potential for research and education in the Tidewater area 
of Virginia in Ada related topics was necessary, we drafted a 
proposal within the 24-hour deadline given us. The grant was to 
last one year. 


In September 1987 we began our work on the grant which was based 
on a newly drafted proposal to last 18 months until February 28, 
1989. Because we had not completed some of our goals nor spent 
significant portions we were granted an extension to May 31, 1989. 


PROJECT ACTIVITIES: 


We found that since there was a large time interval in the 
submission of the initial proposal and the granting of the proposal 
some researchers were already committed to other projects. Due to 
lack of budgeting for a full-time position we were also unable to 
hire a part-time secretary as a part of our project. Paperwork and 
other hindrances prevented us from hiring a programmer until May 
of 1988. 


We perhaps over-estimated our timing on parts of the project. We 
were unable to complete all the CAI work we had planned; although 
completion is near and has been greatly extended and broadened to 
include more work on continuing education and graduate curricula. 


The work on MACSYMA and Ada is still in progress; however, we were 
able to include Mr. Jonathan Graham, Instructor of Computer Science 
co take the Summer 88 place of Dr. Sandra Deloatch, who had a 
orevious commitment on a different DoD grant. His summer work on 
"Using Ada tasking to simulate theoretical operating systems 
concepts in multiprocess environments" is not completed yet but is 
•n progress and is being tied to his research toward his Ph.D. in 
Computer Science at the College of William and Mary. 








- 11 - 


The successes, however, far outweigh our expectations. The 
purchase through the grant of a VAX 8 350 to complement our VAX 
11/785 has allowed us to increase our computation research platform 
capabilities well beyond this ARO research grant. The Academic 
Computing Unit at the University is clustering these two computers, 
adding additional software and storage capabilities, placing the 
University on a national network (NSFNet), and developing CAI work. 


Virtually none of this could have happened without the acquisition 
of the VAX 8350 from this grant. 


We have been able to train approximately 20 faculty in software 
engineering principles and Ada, which in many cases have encouraged 
them to submit new research proposals. Many of them are doing 
research now that they would not have ordinarily done. 
Approximately, seven students have been hired to aid the 
researchers and to do independent work. Some are now being 
employed and using the knowledge, experience, and techniques 
received while working for the ReDTEA project. Approximately, 
forty students have taken Ada-related courses during the grant 
period. Some are now in the employ of DoD and its contractors 
using that language in software engineering environments. 


The effects of the funding of research and training, the 
acquisition of hardware and software, the purchase of research 
materials, and the support of an excellent CAI Assistant/Programmer 
have had the above measurable and many unmeasurable positive 
effects on the overall computational research capabilities at this 
University. We are being solicited even more often to write 
proposals for both governmental and private grants in computational 
research; we are now considered a Historically Black Research 
University by some private research foundations; and we are 
beginning to attract better faculty. 


Needless to say we appreciate the funding and feel that the entire 
University community has benefitted and will still benefit. 


FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS; 


Virtually, all the researchers and participants are continuing with 
the same or similar activities; some of these have already been 
supported by other funding organizations. New avenues of 
investigation and interests have also been generated directly and 
indirectly from this ARO grant. Some current areas of interest 
include 







- 12 - 


1 . Using Ada has a program design language. There have been 
conversations with Army officials (TRADOC) dealing with an 
Ada-based design data base design and management. 


2. Building a software engineering laboratory, establishing 
specialized graduate continuing education courses in this 
area, etc. Funding is being sought to accomplish both 
educational and research objectives in software engineering. 
We are beginning to establish a relationship with the Software 
Engineering Institute. 


3. We have research contracts with NASA (Langley Research 
Center), plan to establish contracts with the Naval Surface 
Weapons Center, and have made proposals to the National 
Science Foundation. 


In November, 1988 we asked for an extension on this grant (called 

ReDTEA II - ARO Proposal No. 26808-EL) to 

1. Extend our Ada Education and Training, 

2. Extend the AdaL prototype to other computational platforms, 

3. Establish additional Ada and Software Engineering Workshops, 

4. Continue with the work of investigating the modifying 
algorithms to a parallel processing environment using Ada's 
tasks as a simulation tool, 

5. Study fault tolerance and distributed systems in an Ada- 
controlled environment, 

6. The development and application of a basic fuzzy-set, fuzzy- 
graph package in Ada, and 

7. Further enhancements of the Academic Computing Unit. 


Since November, some of these items have already been funded, but 
the proposal is still outstanding at ARO.
