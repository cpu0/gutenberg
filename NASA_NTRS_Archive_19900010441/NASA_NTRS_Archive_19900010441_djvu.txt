TECHNICAL REPORT 


The 

RICIS 

Concept 


The University of Houston-Clear Lake established the Research Institute for 
Computing and Information systems in 1986 to encourage NASA Johnson Space 
Center and local industry to actively support research in the computing and 
information sciences. As part of this endeavor, UH-Clear Lake proposed a 
partnership with JSC to jointly define and manage an integrated program of research 
in advanced data processing technology needed for JSCs main missions, including 
administrative, engineering and science responsibilities. JSC agreed and entered into 
a three-year cooperative agreement with UH-Clear Lake beginning in May, 1 986, to 
jointly plan and execute such research through RICIS. Additionally, under 
Cooperative Agreement NCC 9-16, computing and educational facilities are shared 
by the two institutions to conduct the research. 

The mission of RICIS is to conduct, coordinate and disseminate research on 
computing and information systems among researchers, sponsors and users from 
UH-Clear Lake, NASA/JSC, and other research organizations. Within UH-Clear 
Lake, the mission is being implemented through interdisciplinary involvement of 
faculty and students from each of the four schools: Business, Education, Human 
Sciences and Humanities, and Natural and Applied Sciences. 

Other research organizations are involved via the “gateway” concept. UH-Clear 
Lake establishes relationships with other universities and research organizations, 
having common research interests, to provide additional sources of expertise to 
conduct needed research. 

A major role of RICIS is to find the best match of sponsors, researchers and 
research objectives to advance knowledge in the computing and information 
sciences. Working jointly with NASA/JSC, RICIS advises on research needs, 
recommends principals for conducting the research, provides technical and 
administrative support to coordinate the research, and integrates technical results 
into the cooperative goals of UH-Clear Lake and N AS A/JSC.

Purpose And Contents 



PURPOSE : 


S E A D 

Software Engineering and Ada Database 


SEAD has been developed to provide an information resource 
to NASA and NASA contractors with respect to Ada-based 
resources and activities which are available or underway 
either in NASA or elsewhere in the worldwide Ada community. 
The sharing of such information will reduce duplication of 
effort while improving quality in the development of future 
software systems. 


CONTENT : 

SEAD data is organized into five major areas: 

1) Information regarding education and training resources 
which are relevant to the life cycle of Ada-based 
software engineering projects such as those in the 
Space Station Program. 

2) Research publications relevant to NASA projects such as 
the Space Station Program. Conferences relating to Ada 
technology . 

3) The latest progress reports on Ada projects completed 
or in progress both within NASA and throughout the free 
world . 

4) Ada compilers and other commercial products that 
support Ada software development. 

5) Reusable Ada components generated both within NASA and 
from elsewhere in the free world. This classified 
listing of reusable components shall include 
descriptions of tools, libraries and other components 
of interest to NASA. 

Sources for the data include technical newsletters and 

periodicals, conference proceedings, the Ada Information 

Clearinghouse, product vendors, and project sponsors and 

contractors . 


1-3 


USER INTERFACE: 


The SEAD user interface consists of a set of menu-driven 
interactive panels which allow searches on any field. The 
user may construct a query using a single value, a range of 
values, or a logical combination of values. The system will 
search the database for all records that match the query and 
retrieve them. The user may "browse" through the retrieved 
data, viewing the records one at a time. 

**SEAD is accessible via NASA/JSC CIN. Interested NASA 
personnel and contractors may contact the Data Administrator 
at (713) 488-8806.

TERMS AND CONCEPTS 


RECORD A representation of a single row from the database table. 

FIELD A portion of a form used for entering and/or displaying a 

single item of information. Fields most often represent 
columns from database tables, but may also represent other 
information . 


FUNCTION KEYS 

The following function keys are available while running a form; they are 
grouped here by function type. 

You can display the function key assignments for your terminal by pressing 
PFl (SHOW FUNCTION KEYS) . A key map of the VT100 keys corresponding to the 
IBM 3270 keys is included at the end of this section. 

Ask your Database Administrator for the exact keystrokes required by your 
particular terminal type. 

NOTES: The function-key descriptions listed below are based on the default 
function key assignments. Since any of these functions can be redefined by 
the DBA, some of these functions may work differently, or may not be

displays the next record that 
satisfies the query. In a block 
displaying multiple records, moves 
the cursor to the next record in 
the block. If the current record 
is the last record displayed in a 
multiple record block, moves other 
records up to make room for a new 
one. 


If a query is active in a block 
displaying multiple records, 
displays the next set of retrieved 
records . 


Moves the cursor to the previous

Chapter 1 . 


Procedures For Using SQL Menus 


There are several procedures that are common for all SQL 
menus. They are as follows: 

ENTERING DATA: 

- To enter data into a field, press <NEXT FIELD> 
after typing in the information. The cursor will 
then be positioned at the next field to be 
entered. 

Some fields on the SQL menu may be skipped if data 
is not required or available by the user . This 

may be done by pressing <ENTER>. If data must be 
entered, then the message "Field must be entered" 
will appear at the bottom of the screen. 

If you are not sure of the type of data that needs 
to be entered for a particular field, pressing the 
<HELP> key while the cursor is at the field will 
display a brief help message at the bottom of the 
screen. Pressing the <HELP> key a second time 
will display a more detailed help screen for the 
field 

Because the screen can only display 80 characters 
per line, some of the fields cannot display its 
entire contents at once. To view the contents, 
each field can be scrolled horizontally by using 
the < SCROLL LEFT> and <SCROLL RIGHT> keys. 

To access a different SQL menu other than the one 
that is currently being used, pressing <NEXT 
BLOCK> will display the next SQL menu. An 
alternative way is by pressing the <MENU> key. 
This will display a submenu listing of the SQL 
menus that are available. From there you can 
select the menu you need. 

- To display the function key map, press <SHOW 
FUNCTION KEYS> . 


III-3 


RETRIEVING, INSERTING, UPDATING, AND DELETING RECORDS: 


To display all records in a table: 

Press <EXECUTE QUERY> . Press <NEXT RECORD> 
to display each subsequent record. If there 
is no data in the database for the particular 
SQL menu, then the message "Query caused no 
records to be retrieved" will appear at the 
bottom of the screen. Data can be cleared 

from the SQL menu by pressing the <CLEAR 
RECORD> key. 

To retrieve records by matching exact values: 

Press <ENTER QUERY>; enter the values you 
want to match into the appropriate fields; 
press <EXECUTE QUERY> . Press <NEXT RECORD> 
to view subsequent records retrieved by the 
query . 

To retrieve records by entering a WHERE condition: 
Press <ENTER QUERY>; move the cursor to the 
field where you want to enter a variable; 
type & followed by a variable name (for 
example, &SAL) ; press <EXECUTE QUERY>; when 
prompted with Query where...? enter any WHERE 
condition, (for example, &SAL > 10000. 

To insert a new record: 

Press <CREATE RECORD>; enter the field 
values; press <COMMIT>. The message 

"Transaction completed - 1 records 

processed" will appear at the bottom of the 
screen. To insert additional records, repeat 
the sequence. 

To update a record: 

Retrieve the desired record; move the cursor 
to the field (s) to be updated, press <ENABLE 
RECORD UPDATE>, change the necessary values; 
press <COMMIT> . To update additional 

records, repeat the sequence. 

To delete a record: 

Retrieve the record to be deleted; press 
<DELETE RECORD>, press <COMMIT>. To delete 
additional records, repeat the sequence.

BASIC TUTORIAL FOR SQL* Forms 


Chapter 1 . Basic Concepts 

A FORM is a "fill-in-the-blanks" arrangement of database data 
that allows easier data entry, update, and query. Although a 
form may be displayed on one or more PAGES, only one page is 
visible on the terminal screen at a time. 

A form consists of one or more BLOCKS. Each block corresponds 
to a single table in the ORACLE database. For each block, the 
form will display one or more RECORDS (or rows) from the 
database table. Each record consists of one or more FIELDS, 
which may correspond to columns in the database. See Figure 
1 - 1 .

Running A Form 


IV-A 




You can use a form to enter new information into an ORACLE 
database or to issue a query that retrieves and displays 
existing information. Once information is displayed on the 
screen, you can view it, change it, or remove it from the 
database entirely. 


Chapter 2 . Running a Form 

To enter SQL*Forms and run an existing form, follow these 
steps : 

***This tutorial is not available on-line at this time, but 
can be used as a guide for using SEAD. Logon to SEAD using 
the directions in PART II - Chapter 1 of this users manual, 
please use this tutorial as a reference. 

1. Log on to your system in the normal manner. 

2. At the system command prompt, you have to enter IAP, 
the name of the form you want to run, and your 
ORACLE user name and password in the following 
format : 

IAP form_name username/password 
For this tutorial, type 

IAP EMPLOYEE SCOTT/TIGER 
and press ENTER. 


IV-5 



■^f*- er completing these steps, SQL*Forms displays the sample form 
on your screen (Figure 1-2) .

Figure 1-2 

Displaying the Sample Form 

The sample is based on the EMP table from ORACLE'S sample 
database, and contains information about the employees numbers, 
names, job titles, managers, hire dates, salaries and 
commissions, and department numbers.

Chapter 3 . 


Retrieving All Records 


IV-7 




Chapter 3 . 


Retrieving All Records 


Currently, the sample form has no information displayed in its 
fields. To retrieve all the records stored in EMP, press the 
[EXECUTE QUERY] key (for a list of the keys, see Chapter 7. HELP 
WITH FUNCTION KEY DEFINITIONS or PART II Chapters 3-4) . 

SQL*Forms displays the first record on the screen (Figure 1-3) . 

Note: If you or someone else (in a multiuser environment) have 
previously done the exercises in the Tutorial, permanent 
changes may have been made to the sample Oracle tables. In 
that case, the data you see on your screen may differ 
somewhat from the data shown in the screen images of this 
Tutorial .

Moving Around The Form 


IV-9 



Chapter 4 . 


Moving Around The Form 


Each displayed field on the screen corresponds to a column in the 
database. You can move from field to field by using the [NEXT 
FIELD] and [PREVIOUS FIELD] keys. For example: 

1. Press [NEXT FIELD] three times. 

The cursor should be positioned on the MGR field. 

2. Press [PREVIOUS FIELD] three times, to position the 
cursor back on the EMPNO field. 

3. Press [NEXT FIELD] seven times, until you reach the 
DEPTNO field. 

4. Press [NEXT FIELD] once more. 

The cursor should be positioned on the EMPNO field. 

Notice that the [NEXT FIELD] key cycles through all the employee 
fields in a forward direction. The [PREVIOUS FIELD] key cycles 
through all the fields in the opposite direction. 


IV-10 


Just as [NEXT FIELD] and [PREVIOUS FIELD] cycle through fields, 
[NEXT RECORD] and [PREVIOUS RECORD] cycle through the retrieved 

records. To view the remaining employee records, press the [NEXT 
RECORD] key once for each succeeding record. For example, when 
you press [NEXT RECORD] once, SQL*Forms displays the record for 
Employee 7499 (Figure 1-4).

Retrieving the Next Record 

You can continue pressing [NEXT RECORD] until the last record is 
displayed. At this point the message, "Last row of query 
retrieved," appears in the message area and the fields on the 
screen are set to their default values (blank, in this example) . 

To display preceding records, use the [PREVIOUS RECORD] function 
key. If you continue pressing [PREVIOUS RECORD] until the first 
record is redisplayed, SQL*Forms issues the message, "At first 
record. " 

Note: Besides [NEXT FIELD], [PREVIOUS FIELD], [NEXT RECORD], and 
[PREVIOUS RECORD] , SQL*Forms provides several other 
functions for cursor movement. For a list of available 
cursor-movement functions, see the SQL*Forms User's Quick 
Reference . 


iv- 11 



Exercises : 

1. If you are currently in the employee record for 
Allen (Figure 1-4) and the cursor is positioned at the 
HIREDATE field, how do you get to the ENAME fi.eld? 

2. Suppose the database currently contains two employee 
records: Smith (Figure 1-3) and Allen (Figure 1-4) in 
that order. If you are currently in the first record, 
Smith, what steps are necessary to get to the JOB field 
for Allen? 

3. If you are in the record for Allen, what steps are 
necessary to get to the SAL field for Smith? 


IV- 12 




Chapter 5 . 


Retrieving Specific Records 


IV- 13 




Chapter 5 . Retrieving Specific Records 

If your database contains a large number of records, it is time- 
consuming to retrieve all the records and look through them one 
at a time to find a particular one. Instead, when you want to 
retrieve specific records, you can specify criteria -you want 
those records to meet and SQL*Forms will retrieve all records 
matching your specification. 

Suppose you want to see the records of all employees whose job is 
MANAGER. You can do this by entering the value you want to match 
directly on the form: 

1. Press the [ENTER QUERY] key. 

SQL*Forms displays the message, "Enter a query, 
then press QUERY key to execute it." 

2. Press [NEXT FIELD] two times, until the cursor is 
positioned on the Job field. 

3. Type MANAGER in the JOB field. 

If you make a mistake when entering your query, you can 
use the [CHARACTER DELETE] function key to delete the 
character to the left of the cursor. Or, you can use 
the functions [RIGHT] or [LEFT] to move the cursor in 
either direction horizontally without changing any 
characters; and then type the desired character over the 
incorrect one. 

4. Press the [EXECUTE QUERY] key. 


IV-14 



SQL*Forms displays the first record that satisfies your query 
(Figure 1-5) .

Retrieving Records that Match a Specific Value 

As always, pressing [NEXT RECORD] and [PREVIOUS RECORD] displays 
the other records retrieved by the query. 

Note: Although this example showed a value entered in only 

one field, you can also specify values for several fields. 
For example, entering MANAGER in the JOB field and 30 in 
the DEPTNO field would retrieve the record for the manager 
of Department 30. 


IV-15 




Exercises : 


1. If you are currently in the EMPNO field of a record 
and you want to display the employee record for Jones, 
how would you do this? 

2. If you are currently in the COMM field of a record 
and you want to display all the employee records that 
have employee number 7566 as their manager, how would 
you do this? 

3. Suppose you are currently in the ENAME field of a 
record, what steps are necessary to find all the 
salesmen in department 20? 


IV-16 




Chapter 6. 


The THELP1 Function 


IV- 17 




Chapter 6 . 


The THELP1 Function 


The [HELP] function displays information about the current field. 
[HELP] can display information in two forms: 

a brief description of the field, displaye.d on the 
message line. 

2 - a screenful of information about the field, which 

replaces the current page of the form on the display. 

If the designer of the form provided a brief description of the 
current field, that description appears when you press [HELP] . 
If you want to see the screenful of information, press [HELP] a 
second time. 

If the designer of the form did not provide a brief description 
of the current field, the screenful of information appears when 
you press [HELP] the first time. 

To leave the screenful of help information and redisplay the 
current page of the form, press any function key except [HELP] . 

From the basic tutorial, if you were at the screen in Figure 1-2 
and the cursor is positioned at the first field, EMPNO, pressing 
the [HELP] key once would display: 


======== EMP ========

might well have such a list of values. 


Chapter 9. Help Form A Form 

Some forms can provide additional kinds of help at your request. 
Where additional help is available, it usually takes the form of 
a box or screenful of information that you can display by 
pressing a certain function key or making a certain selection 
from a menu. The instructions for using a form may tell you 
whether that form can provide any additional help, and if so, how 
to request it.

TO: 


Your user I.D. (username) is . 

You may access the SEAD through the NASA/JSC Center 
Information Network (CIN) . 

If you do not have the capability to directly connect to 
the CIN, you may dial in at 713/483-2500. You should use or 
emulate a VT100 terminal. Once you are connected, follow the 
procedure outlined on the following pages. If you do have a 
direct connection, simply type SEAD followed by your username 
at the CIN Menu. For direct connection, it is best to have 
or emulate an IBM3270. Please be aware that the SEAD relies 
on the function keys (ESC sequence on the VT100) and, if you 
or your communications software have redefined these keys to 
some other functions, you will have difficulty using the 
database. 

The first time you sign on, your password will be the 
same as your username. The system will immediately prompt 
you to enter a new password. Your new password must be from 
6 to 8 characters and can contain alpha and numeric 
characters. You will be asked to type the new password twice 
to verify it. Please remember your new password, as this is 
what you will use for your next logon. 

After you get to the main menu of SEAD, you should be 
able to follow the on-line menus, comments, and help. When 
you are ready to quit, return to the main menu and select <E> 
to exit, then hang up. 

If you encounter any problems, call the SEAD 
Administrator at (713) 488-8806. We also welcome any 
comments or suggestions you may have regarding the structure,
