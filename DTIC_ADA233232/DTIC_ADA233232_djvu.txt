CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 


The Ada implementation described above was tested according to the Ada 
Validation Procedures [Pro90] against the Ada Standard [Ada83] using the 
current Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC). This Validation Summary 
Report (VSR) gives an account of the testing of this Ada implementation. 

For any technical terms used in this report, the reader is referred to 
[Pro90]. A detailed description of the ACVC may be found in the current 
ACVC User's Guide [UG89].

1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: 

A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class 
to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B 
and class L tests are expected to produce errors at compile time and link 
time, respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result when they 
are executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, 
ana the procedure CHECK_FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT 
alsi provides a set of Identity functions used to defeat some compiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECKS ILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately compiled units. Errors 
are expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values — for example, the largest integer, A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in Appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and 
implementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this implementation are described in section 2.3.

INTRODUCTION 


For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by the 
AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications described in 
the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see section 2 . 1 ) and, 
possibly some inapplicable tests (see Section 2.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each test of 
the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are irrelevant 
for a given Ada implementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may 
be supported by documents issued by the ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and commonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Commentaries are included as 
appropriate.

C35702B, C35713C, B86001U, and C86006G check for the predefined type 
LONG FLOAT. 


C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with a 
name other than FLOAT, LONGFLOAT, or SH0RT_FL0AT. 

A35801E checks that FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST may be used as a range 
constraint in a floating-point type declaration; for this implementation 
that range exceeds the safe numbers and must be rejected. (See section 
2.3) 


C45531M..P (4 tests) and C45532M..P (4 tests) check fixed-point 
operations for the types that require a SYSTEM.MAXMANTISSA of 47 or 
greater. 

C45624A..B (2 tests) check that the proper exception is raised if 
MACHINE_OVERFLOVS is FALSE for floating point types; for this 
implementation, MACHINE_OVERFLOVS is TRUE. 

C86001F recompiles package SYSTEM, making package TEXT_I0, and hence 
package REPORT, obsolete. For this implementation, the package TEXT_I0 
is dependent upon package SYSTEM. 

B86001Y checks for a predefined fixed-point type other than DURATION. 

C96005B checks for values of type DURATION'BASE that are outside the 
range of DURATION. There are no such values for this implementation.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


CD1009C uses a representation clause specifying a non-default size for a 
floating-point type. 

CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use representation 
clauses specifying non-default sizes for access types.

attempted. 

CE2107F..H (3 tests), CE2110D, and CE2111H attempt to associate multiple 
internal files with the same external file for direct files. The proper

CE2203A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of the 
external file is exceeded for SEQUENTIAL_IO. This implementation does 
not restrict file capacity. 

CE2403A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of the 
external file is exceeded for DIRECT_I0. This implementation does not 
restrict file capacity.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


CE3111A..B (2 tests), CE3111D..E (2 tests), CE3114B, and CE3115A attempt 
to associate multiple internal files with the same external file for 
text files. The proper exception is raised when multiple access is 
attempted. 

CE3304A checks that USE_ERR0R is raised if a call to SET_LINE_LENGTH or 
SET_PAGE_LENGTH specifies a value that is inappropriate for the external 
file. This implementation does not have inappropriate values for either 
line length or page length. 

CE3413B checks that PAGE raises LAYOUT_ERROR when the value of the page 
number exceeds COUNT'LAST. For this implementation, the value of 
COUNT'LAST is greater than 150000 making the checking of this objective 
impractical. 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 22 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
implementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the way 
expected by the original tests. 

B24009A B33301B B38003A B38003B B38009A B38009B 

B85008G B85008H BC1303F BC3005B BD2B03A BD2D03A 

BD4003A 


A35801E was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by 
the AVO; the compiler rejects the use of the range FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST 
as the range constraint of a floating-point type declaration because the 
bounds lie outside of the range of safe numbers (cf. ARM 3.5.7(12)). 

CD1J09A, CD1009I, CD1C03A, CD2A22J, CD2A24A, and CD2A31A..C (3 tests) use 
instantiations of the support procedure Length_Check, which uses 
Unchecked^Conversion according to the interpretation given in AI-00590. 

The AVO ruled that this interpretation is not binding under ACVC 1.11; the 
tests are ruled to be passed if type produce Failed messages only from the 
instantiations of Length_Check — i.e., the allowed Report.Failed messages 
have the general form: 

"* CHECK ON REPRESENTATION FOR <TYPE ID> FAILED."

PROCESSING INFORMATION 


3.1 TESTING ENVIRONMENT 

The host and target computer systems for this Ada implementation were 
connected by an RS232 serial port. The rest of this Ada implementation is 
described adequately by the information given in the initial pages of this 
report.

Chantilly VA 22021 

Testing of this Ada implementation was conducted at the customer's site by 
a validation team from the AVF. 


3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming 
Language Standard, whether the test is applicable or inapplicable; 
otherwise, the Ada Implementation fails the ACVC [Pro90J. 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard.

All I/O tests of the test suite were processed because this implementation 
supports a file system. The above number of floating-point tests were not 
processed because they used floating-point precision exceeding that 
supported by the implementation. When this compiler "was tested, the tests 
listed in section 2.1 had been withdrawn because of test errors. 


3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

Version 1.11 of the ACVC comprises 4170 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, the tests listed in section 2.1 had been withdrawn because of test 
errors. The AVF determined that 292 tests were inapplicable to this 
implementation. All inapplicable tests were processed during validation 
testing except for 201 executable tests that use floating-point precision 
exceeding that supported by the implementation. In addition, the modified 
tests mentioned in section 2.3 were also processed. 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were not loaded directly onto the host computer. The tape 
was loaded onto a Sun Workstation, and the tests were copied over Ethernet 
to the host machine. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host computer, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 

The tests were compiled and linked on the host computer system, as 
appropriate. The executable images were transferred to the target computer 
system by the communications link described above, and run. The results 
were captured on the host computer system. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the customer and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a complete listing of 
the processing options for this implementation. It also indicates the 
default options. 

Test output, compiler and linker listings, and job logs were captured on 
magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site by 
the validation team were also archived.

APPENDIX A 
MACRO PARAMETERS 


This appendix contains the macro parameters used for customizing the ACVC. 
The meaning and purpose of these parameters are explained in [UG89]. The 
parameter values are presented in two tables. The first table lists the 
values that are defined in terms of the maximum input-line length, which is 
the value for $MAX_IN_LEN—also listed here. These values are expressed 
here as Ada string aggregates, where "V” represents the maximum input-line 
length.

COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


2 VADS ADA 

VADS ADA Ada compiler 
Syntax 

VADS ADA source_file [, 

3 Command_Qualifiers 

/APPEND Append all output to a log file. 

/DEBUG 

/DEBUG-G Write out the gnrx.lib file in ASCII. 

/DEFINE 

/DEFINE=(identifier:type=value", ... ) 

Define identifier of a specified type and value. See VADS ADA 
PREPROCESSOR REFERENCE. 

/DEPENDENCIES Analyze for dependencies only; no link will be performed if 
this option is given (/MAIN and /OUTPUT options must not be used with this 
qualifier). 

/ERRORS 

/ERRORS[-(option [, ...])] Process compilation error messages using the ERR 

tool and direct the output to SYS$OUTPUT; the parentheses can be omitted 
if only one qualifier is given (by default, only lines containing 
errors are listed). 

Options: 

LISTING List entire input file. 

EDITOR[="editor"] 

Insert error messages into the source file and call a text editor 
(EDT by default). If a value is given as a quoted string, 
that string is used to invoke the editor. This allows other editors 
to be used instead of the default. 

OUTPUTl = filename] 

Direct error processed output to the specified file name; if no file 
name is given, the source file name is used with a file extension .ERR. 

BRIEF List only the affected lines (default] 

Only one of the BRIEF, LISTING, OUTPUT, or EDITOR options can be used in a 
single command. 

For more information about the /ERRORS option, see also COMPILING ADA 
PROGRAMS, COMPILER ERROR MESSAGE PROCESSING. 

/EXECUTABLE 
/EXECUTABLE-file_name 

Provide an explicit name for the executable when used with the /MAIN qualifier; 
the filename value must be supplied (if the file type is omitted, .EXE is

/KEEP_IL Keep the intermediate language (IL) file produced 

by the compiler front end. The IL file will be placed in the OBJECTS 
directory, with the name ADA_SOURCE.I. 

/LIBRARY 

/LIBRARY=library_name Operate in VADS 

library library_name (the current working directory is the default). 

/LINKARGUMENTS 
/LINK_ARGUMENTS="value" 

Pass command qualifiers and parameters to the linker. 


/MAIN 

/MAIN[=unit_name] Produce an executable program 

using the named unit as the main program; if no value is given, the 

name is derived from the first Ada file name parameter (the 

.A suffix is removed); the executable file name is derived from 

the main program name unless the /EXECUTABLE qualifier is used. 


/NOOPTIMIZE Do not optimize. 

/WARNINGS Print warning diagnostics. 

/OPTIMIZE 

/OPTIMIZE[=numberj Invoke the code optimizer (0PTIM3). An optional digit 

provides the level of optimization. /0PTIMIZE=4 is the default.

of any that are out of date. 

/SHOW Show the name of the tool executable but do not execute it. 

/SHOW_ALL Print the name of the front end, code generator, 

optimizer, and linker, and list the tools that will be invoked. 

/SUPPRESS Apply pragma SUPPRESS for all checks 

to the entire compilation. (See also pragma SUPPRESS(ALL_CHECKS)) 

/TIMING Print timing information for the compilation. 

/VERBOSE Print information for the compilation^ 

3 Description 

The command VADS ADA executes the Ada compiler and compiles the named Ada source 
file, ending with the .A suffix. The file must reside in a VADS library 
directory. The ADA.LIB file in this directory is modified after each Ada unit 
is compiled. 

By default, VADS ADA produces only object and net files. If the /MAIN option is 
used, the compiler automatically invokes VADS LD and builds a complete program 
with the named library unit as the main program. 

Non-Ada object files may be given as arguments to VADS ADA. 

These files will be passed on to the linker and will be linked with 
the specified Ada object files. 

Command line options may be specified in any order, but the order 
of compilation and the order of the files to be passed to the linker 
can be significant. 

Several VADS compilers may be simultaneously available on a single 
system. The VADS ADA command within any version of VADS 
on a system will execute the correct compiler components based upon 
visible library directives. 

Program listings with a disassembly of machine code instructions are 
generated by VADS DB or VADS DAS. 

3 Diagnostics 

The diagnostics produced by the VADS compiler are intended to be 
self-explanatory. Most refer to the RM. Each RM reference includes a section 
number and, optionally, a paragraph number enclosed in parentheses.

LINKER OPTIONS 

The linker options of this Ada implementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to linker documentation and not 
to this report. 


B-5 



COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


2 VADS LD 

VADS LD prelinker 
Syntax 

VADS LD unit_narae 

3 Command_Qualifiers 
/APPEND 

/DEBUG Debug memory overflow (use in cases where linking a large number of 
units ca"ses the error message "local symbol overflow" to occur). 

/EARLY 

/EARLY="unit_name" Force the given unit to be elaborated as early as 

possible (unitname must be enclosed in double quotes). 

/EXECUTABLE 

/EXECUTABLE[= file_name] 

Put the output in the named file. The default executable names are 
<main_unit>.EXE on self-hosts or <main_unit>.VOX on cross targets. 

/FILES Print a list of dependent files in elaboration order, and suppress 
linking. 

/LIBRARY 

/LIBRARY=library_name Operate in VADS library library_name 
(the current working directory is the default). 

/LINKOPTIONS 

/LINK_OPTIONS=object_file_or_qualifier [,...]" 

Add the options surrounded by quotes to the invocation of the linker. 
/OUTPUT 

/OUTPUT=file_name Direct output to file_name. Default is SYS$OUTPUT. 

/SHOW Show the name of the tool executable but do not execute it. 

/UNITS Print a list of dependent units in order, and suppress linking. 
/VERBOSE Print the VMS linker command prior to execution. 

/VERIFY Print the VMS linker command but suppress execution. 

3 Description 

VADS LD collects the object files needed to make unit_name 
a main program and calls the VMS linker to link together all Ada 
and other language objects required to produce an executable. unit_name 
must be a non-generic subprogram that is either a procedure or 
a function that returns an Ada STANDARD.INTEGER (the predefined type 
INTEGER). The utility uses the net files produced by the Ada compiler 


B-6 



COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


to check dependency information. VADS LD produces an exception 
mapping table, a unit elaboration table, and passes this information 
to the linker. 

VADS LD reads instructions for generating executables from 
the ADA.LIB file in the VADS libraries on the search list. 

Besides information generated by the compiler, these directives also 
include VITHn directives that allow the automatic linking 
of object modules compiled from other languages or Ada object modules 
not named in context clauses in the Ada source. Any number of WITH 
directives may be placed into a library, but they must be numbered 
contiguously beginning at WITH1. The directives are recorded in the 
library's ADA.LIB file and have the following form. 

VITH1|LINK|object_file| 

VITH2I LINK|archive_file| 

WITH directives may be placed in the local Ada libraries or in any 
VADS library on the search list. 

A WITH directive in a local VADS library or earlier on the library search list 
will hide the same numbered WITH directive in a library later in the library 
search list. 

Use VADS INFO to change or report library directives in the current library. 

All arguments after unitname are passed on to the linker. These arguments may 
be linker options, names of object files or archive libraries, or library 
abbreviations. 

3 Diagnostics 

Self-explanatory diagnostics are produced for missing files, etc. 

Occasional additional messages are produced by the linker. 

3 Files 

Normally VADS LD generates an intermediate file with the 
process ID as a substring, VADSOPTION<process_ID>.OPT. 

With either the /VERIFY or /VERBOSE qualifiers, 

however, VADS LD will produce the intermediate file <main_unit>.OPT.

end STANDARD; 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


ATTACHMENT I 


APPENDIX F. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


1. Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 

1.1. INLINE_ONLY Pragma 

The INLINE_ONLY pragma, when used in the same way as pragma 
INLINE, indicates to the compiler that the subprogram must 
always be inlined. This pragma also suppresses the genera¬ 
tion of a callable version of the routine which saves code 
space. If a user erroneously makes an INLINEONLY subpro¬ 
gram recursive a warning message will be emitted and an 
PROGRAMERROR will be raised at run time. 

1.2. BUILT_IN Pragma 

The BUILT IN pragma is used in the implementation of some 
predefine3 Ada packages, but provides no user access. It is 
used only to implement code bodies for which no actual Ada 
body can be provided, for example the MACHINECODE package. 

1.3. SHARE_CODE Pragma 

The SHARECODE pragma takes the name of a generic instantia¬ 
tion or a generic unit as the first argument and one of the 
identifiers TRUE or FALSE as the second argument. This 
pragma is only allowed immediately at the place of a 
declarative item in a declarative part or package specifica¬ 
tion, or after a library unit in a compilation, but before 
any subsequent compilation unit. 

When the first argument is a generic unit, the pragma applies 
to all instantiations of that generic. When the first argu¬ 
ment is the name of a generic instantiation, the pragma 
applies only to the specified instantiation, or overloaded 
instantiations. 

If the second argument is TRUE, the compiler will try to 
share code generated for a generic instantiation with code 


C-2 



APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


generated for other instantiations of the same generic. 
When the second argument is FALSE, each instantiation will 
get a unique copy of the generated code. The extent to 
which code is shared between instantiations depends on this 
pragma and the kind of generic formal parameters declared 
for the generic unit. 

The name pragma SHAREBODY is also recognized by the imple¬ 
mentation and has the same effect as SHARE_CODE. It is 
included for compatibility with earlier versions of VADS. 

1.4. NOIMAGE Pragma 

The pragma suppresses the generation of the image array used 
for the IMAGE attribute of enumeration types. This elim¬ 
inates the overhead required to store the array in the exe¬ 
cutable image. An attempt to use the IMAGE attribute on a 
type whose image array has been suppressed will result in a 
compilation warning and PROGRAM_ERROR raised at run time. 

1.5. EXTERNALJJAME Pragma 

The EXTERNAL NAME pragma takes the name of a subprogram or 
variable de?ined in Ada and allows the user to specify a 
different external name that may be used to reference the 
entity from other languages. The pragma is allowed at the 
place of a declarative item in a package specification and 
must apply to an object declared earlier in the same package 
specification. 

1.6. INTERFACENAME Pragma 

The INTERFACENAME pragma takes the name of a variable or 
subprogram defined in another language and allows it to be 
referenced directly in Ada. The pragma will replace all 
occurrences of the variable or subprogram name with an 
external reference to the second, link_argument. The pragma 
is allowed at the place of a declarative item in a package 
specification and must apply to an object or subprogram 
declared earlier in the same package specification. The 
object must be declared as a scalar or an access type. The 
object cannot be any of the following: 

a loop variable, 
a constant, 

an initialized variable, 
an array, or 
a record. 

1.7. IMPLICIT_CODE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argu- 


C-3 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies that implicit code generated by the 
compiler be allowed or disallowed. A warning is issued if 
OFF is used and any implicit code needs to be generated. 
The default is ON. 


1.8. OPTIMIZE_CODE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies whether the code should be optim¬ 
ized by the compiler. The default is ON. When OFF is 
specified, the compiler will generate the code as specified. 

2. Implementation of Predefined Pragmas 

2.1. CONTROLLED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 

2.2. ELABORATE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.3. INLINE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.4. INTERFACE 

This pragma supports calls to 'C' and FORTRAN functions. The 
Ada subprograms can be either functions or procedures. The 
types of parameters and the result type for functions must 
be scalar, access, or the predefined type ADDRESS in SYSTEM. 
All parameters must have mode IN. Record and array objects 
can be passed by reference using the ADDRESS attribute. 

2.5. LIST 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.6. MEMORYSIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas; the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 


C-4 






APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


2.7. NONJREENTRANT 

This pragma takes one argument which can be the name of 
either a library subprogram or a subprogram declared immedi¬ 
ately within a library package spec or body. It indicates 
to the compiler that the subprogram will not be called 
recursively, allowing the compiler to perform specific optim¬ 
izations. The pragma can be applied to a subprogram or a 
set of overloaded subprograms within a package spec or pack¬ 
age body. 

2.8. NOTELABORATED 

This pragma can only appear in a library package specifica¬ 
tion. It indicates that the package will not be elaborated 
because it is either part of the RTS, a configuration pack¬ 
age, or an Ada package that is referenced from a language 
other than Ada. The presence of this pragma suppresses the 
generation of elaboration code and issues warnings if ela¬ 
boration code is required. 

2.9. OPTIMIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 

2.10. PACK 

This pragma will cause the compiler to choose a non-aligned 
representation for composite types. It will not cause 
objects to be packed at the bit level. 

2.11. PAGE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.12. PASSIVE 

The pragma has three forms: 

PRAGMA PASSIVE; 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(SEMAPHORE); 

PRAGMA PASSIVE<INTERRUPT, <number>); 


This pragma Pragma passive can be applied to a task or task 
type declared immediately within a library package spec or 
body. The pragma directs the compiler to optimize certain 
tasking operations. It is possible that the statements in a 
task body will prevent the intended optimization; in these 
cases, a warning will be generated at compile time and will 


C-5 



APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


raise TASKING_ERROR at runtime. 

2.13. PRIORITY 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.14. SHARED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 


2.15. STORAGEUNIT 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas; the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.16. SUPPRESS 

This pragma is implemented as described, except that 
DIVISIONCHECK and in some cases OVERFLOWCHECK cannot be 
suppressed. 

2.17. SYSTEM_NAME 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas; the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

3. Implementation-Dependent Attributes 

3.1. P'REF 

For a prefix that denotes an object, a program unit, a 
label, or an entry: 

This attribute denotes the effective address of the first o.f 
the storage units allocated to P. For a subprogram, pack¬ 
age, task unit, or label, it refers to the address of the 
machine code associated with the corresponding body or 
statement. For an entry for which an address clause has 
been given, it refers to the corresponding hardware inter¬ 
rupt. The attribute is of the type OPERAND defined in the 
package MACHINE_CODE. The attribute is only allowed within 
a machine code procedure. 

See section F.4.8 for more information on the use of this 
attribute. 

(For a package, task unit, or entry, the 'REF attribute is 
not supported.) 


C-6 






APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


3.2. T'TASKID 

For a task object or a value T, T'TASK_ID yields the unique 
task id associated vith a task. The value of this attribute 
is of the type ADDRESS in the package SYSTEM.

5.1. Pragma PACK 

In the absence of pragma PACK, record components are padded 
so as to provide for efficient access by the target 
hardware; pragma PACK applied to a record eliminates the pad 
ding where possible. Pragma PACK has no other effect on the 
storage allocated for record components for which a record 
representation is required. 

5.2. Size Clauses 

For scalar types, a representation clause will pack to the 
number of bits required to represent the range of the sub- 
type. A size clause applied to a record type will not cause 
packing of components; an explicit record representation 
clause must be given to specify the packing of the com¬ 
ponents. A size clause applied to a record type will cause 


C-8 



APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


packing of components only when the component type is a 
discrete type. An error will be issued if there is insuffi¬ 
cient space allocated. The SIZE attribute is not supported 
for task, access, or floating point types. 


5.3. Address Clauses 

Address clauses are only supported for variables. Since 
default initialization of a variable requires evaluation of 
the variable address, elaboration ordering requirements 
prohibit initialization of variables which have address 
clauses. The specified address indicates the physical 
address associated with the variable. 

5.4. Interrupts 

Interrupt entries are not supported. 

5.5. Representation Attributes 

The ADDRESS attribute is not supported for the following 
entities: 

Packages 

Tasks 

Labels 

Entries 


5.6. Machine Code Insertions 
Machine code insertions are supported. 

The general definition of the package MACHINE_CODE provides 
an assembly language interface for the target machine. It 
provides the necessary record type(s) needed in the code 
statement, an enumeration type of all the opcode mnemonics, 
a set of register definitions, and a set of addressing mode 
functions. 

The general syntax of a machine code statement is as fol¬ 
lows: 


CODE_n'( opcode, operand {, operand} ); 
where n indicates the number of operands in the aggregate. 


A special case arises for a variable number of operands. 
The operands are listed within a subaggregate. The format 
is as follows: 


C-9 




APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


CODE_N'( opcode, (operand {, operand}) ); 

For those opcodes that require no operands, named notation 
must be used (cf. RM 4.3(4)). 

C0D£_0'( op => opcode ); 

The opcode must be an enumeration literal (i.e., it cannot be 
an object, attribute, or a rename). 

An operand can only be an entity defined in MACHTNE_CODE or 
the 'REF attribute. 

The arguments to any of the functions defined in 
MACHINE_CODE must be static expressions, string literals, or 
the functions defined in MACHINE_CODE. The 'REF attribute 
may not be used as an argument in any of these functions. 

Inline expansion of machine code procedures is supported. 

6. Conventions for Implementation-generated Names 
There are no implementation-generated names. 

7. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clauses 

Address expressions in an address clause are interpreted as 
physical addresses. 

8. Restrictions on Unchecked Conversions 
None. 

9. Restrictions on Unchecked Deallocations 
None. 


10. Implementation Characteristics of I/O Packages 

Instantiations of DIRECTIO use the value MAX_REC_SIZE as 
the record size (expressed in ST0RAGE_UNITS) when the size 
of ELEMENTTYPE exceeds that value. For example, for uncon¬ 
strained arrays such as string where ELEMENT_TYPE'SIZE is 
very large, MAX_REC_SIZE is used instead. MAX_RECORD_SIZE 
is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a program before 
instantiating DIRECT_I0 to provide an upper limit on the 
record size. In any case, the maximum size supported is 1024 
x 1024 x ST0RAGE_UNIT bits. DIRECT_I0 will raise USE_ERR0R 
if MAX_REC_SIZE exceeds this absolute limit. 

Instantiations of SEQUENTIAL_I0 use the value MAX_REC SIZE 
as the record size (expressed in STORAGE UNITS) when the 


C-10 


APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


size of ELEMENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For example, for 
unconstrained arrays such as string where ELEMENT TYPE'SIZE 
is very large, MAX REC_SIZE is used ~ instead. 
MAX_RECORD SIZE is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a 
program belore instantiating INTEGER_IO to provide an upper 
limit on the record size. SEQUENTIAL_IO imposes no limit on 
MAX_REC_ SIZE. 

11. Implementation Limits 

The following limits are actually enforced by the implemen¬ 
tation. It is not intended to imply that resources up to or 
even near these limits are available to every program. 

11.1. Line Length 

The implementation supports a maximum line length of 500 
characters including the end of line character. 

11.2. Record and Array Sizes 

The maximum size of a tatically sized array type is 
4,000,000 x STORAGEUM"The maximum size of a statically 
sized record type i~ 4,000,000 x STORAGEJJNITS. A record 
type or array type declaration that exceeds these limits 
will generate a warning message. 

11.3. Default Stack Size for Tasks 

In the absence of an explicit ST0RAGESIZE length specifica¬ 
tion, every task except the main program is allocated a fixed 
size stack of 10,240 ST0RAGE_UNITS. This is the value 
returned by T'ST0RAGESIZE for a task type T. 

11.4. Default Collection Size 

In the absence of an explicit ST0RAGE_SIZE length attribute, 
the default collection size for an access type is 100 times 
the size of the designated type. This is the value returned 
by T'STORAGESIZE for an access type T. 

11.5. Limit on Declared Objects 

There is an absolute limit of 6,000,000 x ST0RAGE_UNITS for 
objects declared statically within a compilation unit. If 
this value is exceeded, the compiler will terminate the com¬ 
pilation of the unit with a FATAL error message.
