For superior OS-9 perf ormance, the 




Provides | 68020 running at 25 MHz, up to 128 MBytes of wait-state roemwy, SCSI and IDE 
interfaces; ^ ^rial and 2 parallel ports, 5 16-bit and 2 8-bit ISA slots and much more. The 
SYSTEM V builds on the design concepts proven in the SYSTEM IV providing maximum 
fterij^ty expandability. 

AN OS-9 FIRST - the MICROPROCESSOR is mounted on a daughter board which plugs 
onto the motherboard, This will permit inexpensive upgrades in the future when even greater 
perf orm^ce is required 

GtWINDO^$ benchmark perf ormance index 0,15 seconds faster with a standard VOA board than 
a 68030 tutinitig at 30 MHs with ACRTC video board (85.90 seconds vs 86.05 seconds) . 

Or, for less demanding requirements, the 



SYSTEM IV 



The perfect, low cost, high-quality and high performance OS-9 computer serving customers 
world-wide. Designed for and accepted by industry. Ideal low-cost work-station, development 
platform or just plain fun machine. Powerful, flexible and expandable inexpensively. Uses a 
68000 microprocessor running at 16 MHz. 

Both computers provide flexible screen displays in the native mode with the optional VGA card. 



Eleven graphics modes are supported - 
640 x 200 x 16, 320 x 200 x 256, 



640 x 350 x 16, 

640 x 480 x 16, 

800 x 600 x 16, 

1024 x 768 x 16,

1024 x 768 x 256 



Eight text modes are supported - 

40x24, 80x25, 

80x50, 100x40, 

132x25, 132x28, 

132x44, 132x60 

Foreground, background and border colors 
are user $elei?table from up to 1 6 colors. 

Text ^f3 g*^ may be selected by a utility provided, MODESET, by software using 

SetStt calls, or by termcap entries. In the text mode, the screen responds to standard VT1 00 con- 
trol sequences. The full character set from Hex 20 through Hex FF is suppported in text modes up 
to and ^ is^ding 100 characters wide. The upper 128 characters follow the 'IBM Character Set 2' 
popular with many terminals and printers. These may be displayed on the screen by using the 'Alt' 
key and one or two other keys (software permitting). 

G-WINDOWS option provides 3 screen resolutions; 640 x 480 x 256, 800 x 600 x 256 or 
1024 x 768 x 256. You can have 2 full size 80 x 25 windows with room to spare. Or, a 
window as large as 122 x 44 using the large fonts or a window over 180 x 70 using the 
small fonts.

Metamorphosis- 




From The 

Editor's 

Desk 

Here it is September already! Where has the year 
gone? The leaves on the trees in Missouri already have 
started changing colors. Halloween and Thanksgiving 
are just around the corner, and then Christmas will be 
upon us. If you a re like Mark, you have already started 
formulating your Christmas Wish List and maybe 
even dropping hints. You know, saying things like, 
"If someone really loved me they would buy me such 
and such this year for Christmas." Note: Putting it in 
writing may insure you actually get what you want. 

We have a name! Because of the lack of response 
to our ''Name That Magazine" contest, Mark decided 
to choose his own name: Metamorphosis. (There were 
only eight responses to our query, and the majority 
of these were new submissions instead of votes for 
the names already submitted.) Mark and I both fool 
the name Metamorphosis is a fitting one, all things 
considered . We hope you agree. 

I have been very busy the last couple of weeks 
learning to drive a school bus. After driving my route 
alone on the first day, 1 went home and threatened my 
own children that if they ever gave a bus driver a hard 
time I would let them have it. Believe me, it is hard 
work indeed to be a bus driver. I'm surprised how 
physical it is. I am using muscles I forgot I even had.

Phone: 912-32S-7S59 (9:00-1 2:00am, 6:0O-9:00pm EST) 



As a bus driver, I would like to make a couple 
of requests. One, please do not pull up as far as you 
can in the left turn lane if there is a bus trying to come 
around the corner. Contrary to what must be popular 
belief, buses do not bend in the middle. The angle of 
some turns makes it physically impossible for us to 
get through the turn without taking up the left turn 
lane of the street we are turning into. Giving us dirty 
looks while mouthing curses will not make the bus any 
easier to get around the corner the next time. 

Two, passing a school bus while honking your 
horn and yelling obscenities will not make us go any 
faster. It can take as much as the length of a football 
field for us to stop, so we are not as likely to go any 
faster than we need to, even though there are days 
when we would like to drive 70 mph to get rid of the 
trouble maker in the back. Also, the speed limits that 
are posted on the road ways are for cars. Cars do not 
bounce and rock like a school bus. Cars are not top 
heavy and will not flip over easily. We usually have 
to drive slower than the posted speeds, especially if the 
weather does not cooperate. Also, we have to watch 
out for tree branches and other things hanging in our 
path. 

Third, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE do not pull 
your car right up to our bumper when you are behind 
us at a stop light. We can see the top of your car in 
our mirrors, but we have no way of knowing just how 
close you really are. And believe me, these six ton 
babies roll quickly. A bus could be up over your hood 
and into your windshield in no time at all. Besides, 
who wants to inhale all of those diesel exhaust fumes 
anyway? 

Fourth, I realize it is a pain to be behind or 
even approaching a school bus dropping or loading 
children, but racing by when the red flashers and stop 
arm are out is not the answer. The one to two minutes 
saved by racing by a stopped school bus cannot be 
worth jeapardizing the life of a single child . 

Lastly, if you receive a complaint that your child 
is acting up on the bus, take it seriously. Students are 
written up only after repeated verbal warnings. One 
student acting up can disrupt a good one third of the 
students on the bus. Our write ups are our way of 
asking for help from the parents. Believe me, if you 
are transporting 70 rowdy students, the last thing 
you need is for one student to get one third of them 
even rowdier. It does no good for parents to tell their 
children they will "go down and give that old, mean 
bus driver what for" or even "beat them up." Well, 
enough car driver bashing. 

Mark will be at the Atlanta CoCo Fest coming up 
in early October. If you are planning to attend the fest, 
stop by to see him.

Dear Barbara: 

I wish to subscribe as I liked the August sample 
I received. I am treasurer of the Glenside Color 
Computer Club. I have many CoCos and hardware, 
20 and 30 Meg hard drives, 720 and 1.4 floppy drives 
(20 or more of each). I never could really understand 
or use OS9. I wrote one good program in Basic (Video 
Movie Catalog). My CoCos are piled away in the 
basement. 1 am using a 486DX33 plus 340 Meg HD 
and CD Rom, but not for programming. I just want to 
help you get started. 

Our Glenside Group is the nicest bunch of people, 
and many are super smart-just a great bunch of guys 
and gals. 

On behalf of Glenside, good luck! 

George L. Schneeweiss

News Clips 



Ready For Atlanta? 

With the Atlanta CoCoFest just around the corner, 
I spoke with Alan Dages, a member of the Atlanta 
Computer Society, the host of the show. Alan was not 
sure of his figures, but he estimated they might have 
up to 45 vendors at the show this year and may have to 
open up two rooms. He also speculated that the size of 
the crowd this year might be double that of last years 
200 plus. 

All-in-all, it looks like a real fine show shaping 
up. If you can get away for a couple of days, please 
get yourself to Atlanta and check it out. There will be 
many items there for all to see, as well as meeting old 
friends. 

Last Free Issue 

Just a reminder to all our readers. This is the last 
free issue from our introductory period . We hope you 
have enjoyed reading these issues and have found 
our efforts worthwhile. If you would like to continue 
reading Metamorphosis, then please send in your 
subscription soon. 

Barbara and I would like to thank everyone for 
their patience and kindness during this introductory 
period. We have learned a lot that will help us to put 
out a better magazine. 

In The Next Issue 

Next month will be the premier issue. What better 
way to start off our journey into a new OS-9 era than 
to feature an item long waited for to enhance one of 
the most popular OSK machines. A complete review 
of the newly available MM/1 accelerator boards from 
Kevin Pease will be featured in October's issue. Make 
sure you get yourself a copy to see what all the noise 
is about. 

The accelerator boards will be one of the many 
new items on sale at the Atlanta Fest. Check it out!

„ The Art of 
Programming 

Part III 

Program Flowcharting 

by Shaun Marolf 



Shaun Marolf, 30, is a member of the 
US Navy stationed at Naval Air Sta- 
tion San Diego where he is current- 
ly working on his degree in Comput- 
er Sciences. He first learned program- 
ming in 1979 on an Apple II Plus and 
is also schooled in electronics and dig- 
ital circuits. Shaun runs the "Eight 
BitHeaven" BBS (619-44? '-2111) and 
owns several computers, including an 
original grey case CoCo 1 . 



In part two we left off with 
some rudimentary skills in 
flowcharting and explained a few 
of the symbols. We discussed the 
need for planning the look, feel, 
and operation of the program. At 
this point, we are ready to start 
flowcharting the logic and oper- 
ations of the program. There are 
some basic steps to follow in pro- 
gramming: 

1. Proceed in small steps. Do 
not try to do too much at one 
time. 

2. Divide large jobs into small, 
logically separate tasks. Make 
the sub tasks as independent 
of one another as possible, so 
they can be tested separately 
and so changes can be made 
to one without affecting the 
others. 

3. Keep the flow of control sim- 
ple to make programs easy to 
follow and errors easy to lo- 
cate and correct. 

4. Use pictorial and graphic de- 
sign descriptions as much as 
possible. They are easier to 
visualize than word descrip- 
tions. This is the great advan- 
tage of flowcharts. 

5. Emphasize clarity and sim- 
plicity at first. You can im- 
prove performance (if nec- 
essary) once the program is 
working. 

6. Proceed in a thorough and 
systematic manner. Use 
checklists and standard pro- 
cedures. 

7. Do not tempt fate. (It will usu- 
ally win.) Do not use methods 
you are unsure of, or use them 
very carefully. Watch for situ- 
ations that might cause confu- 
sion and clarify them as soon 
as possible. 

8. Keep in mind that the pro- 
gram must be debugged, test- 
ed, and maintained. Plan for 
these. 



9. Use simple and consistent 
terminology and methods. 
Repetitiveness is no fault in 
program design, nor is com- 
plexity a virtue. 

10. Have your design complete- 
ly formulated before you start 
coding. Resist the temptation 
to start writing down instruc- 
tions: it makes no more sense 
than making parts' lists or lay- 
ing down circuit boards be- 
fore you know exactly what 
will be in your system. 

11. Be particularly careful of fac- 
tors that may change. Make 
the implementation of like- 
ly changes as simple as possi- 
ble. 

12. Keep the overall task in mind. 
Build a total framework in 
which individual pieces can 
be defined and tested. Do 
not leave the entire program 
integration to the end. 

13. If the data is complex or there 
are numerous relationships 
between data items, you must 
organize your data just as 
carefully as you organize your 
program, 



Not every design system is 
perfect, however. Flowcharting 
advantages tend to heavily out- 
weigh the disadvantages and you 
should be aware of them. 

1 . Flowcharts are difficult to de- 
sign, draw, or change in all 
except the simplest of situa- 
tions. 

2. There is no easy way to debug 
or test a flowchart. (However, 
it can lead you to where the 

bug is.) 

3. Flowcharts tend to be clut- 
tered. Designers find it 
difficult to balance between 
the amount of detail needed to 
make the flowchart useful and 
the amount that makes it a lit- 
tle better than a program list- 
ing. 



Metamorphosis - 



4. Flowcharts show only the 
program organization. They 
do not show the organization 
of the data or the structure of 
the I/O modules. 

5. Flowcharts do not help with 
hardware or timing problems 
or gives hints as to where 
these problems might occur. 

6. Flowcharts allow unstruc- 
tured design. There are no 
rules governing the number of 
entries and exits, the number 
or types of interconnections, 
or the logic that may be em- 
ployed. 

7. There is no obvious way to 
represent the simple repeti- 
tion of a loop. 

The disadvantages are 
formidable, but the advantages far 
outweigh them. A disadvantage 
can be turned into an asset. Point 
6 is actually more of an asset be- 
cause even though flowchart struc- 
ture has no rules, programming 
structure does. We can tailor the 
flowchart to fit the rules of the lan- 
guage in which we're working. 
By following the rules of the lan- 
guage we then have a set of rules 
for our flowchart. In point num- 
ber 3, there is also a hidden advan- 
tage. We can use a weaker draft- 
ing for more easily understood sec- 
tions and a more detailed drafting 
for those sections which may be 
unclear or require more documen- 
tation. 

In fact, the only true disadvan- 
tage of flowcharting is the amount 
of time it takes to do it. It can and 
often does become tedious, but 
the amount of time you may save 
while coding and debugging will 
often make up tor this. 

Flowcharting the operational 
portion of the program is a very 
detailed and tedious task and will 
often tend to strain the eyes after 
some time. By no means should 
you continue at this point. Take a 
break when symptoms of fatigue 
appear. You will be more apt 
to make a critical mistake when 



tired. 

Flowcharting is really nothing 
more than a map. The direction 
the program will take is dependent 
on what we want the computer 
to do and what the computer is 
logically following. 

The first symbol in a opera- 
tional flowchart is the TERMINAL 
symbol. This symbol should only 
be used twice in any flowchart. 
Once to show the beginning of 
the flowchart and once more to 
show the end of the flowchart. The 
only labels placed in this symbol is 
START and END. 




The Terminal Symbol 

Let's go ahead and mark the 
beginning of our fit) w chart with it. 
The next symbol we will concern 
ourselves with is the process 
symbol, which is a rectangle. Most 
programs require a system setup 
to allow for use of the hardware 
within the system. We usually try 
to do this first, unless the system 
requires a lot of time to set up. We 
may then want to inform the user 
of this, and we may want to send 
an output notice informing them 
of this first. However you do this, 
remember to keep it simple and 
straight forward. 

Don't confuse yourself or the 
user. I live by the simple K.I.S.S. 
rule. (Keep It Simple, Stupid^ 
In programming, use of elaborate 
schemes to do something simple 
that can be accomplished by only 
one or two lines of code not only 
makes it harder on you but is 
an opportunity for more bugs to 
creep in. It wastes memory space 
better suited for the data. 

Most programs manipulate 



data of one kind or another. Data 
comes in two basic forms as far 
as the program is concerned. The 
first type is fixed data which is set 
within the program and stored 
in a memory register where the 
program can access at any moment 
it is called to do so. The next is 
variable data which the program 
also stores in a memory register 
but then manipulates the data 
and then rewrites the new data to 
the space where the old data was 
stored to retrieve for display or 
further manipulation as needed. 
Variable data is also stored to 
disks for safekeeping and further 
processing in the future. 

The processing symbol is by 
far the most versatile and lints 
the most misunderstood symbol 
within the flowchart. A process 
is simply the work the computer 
does. It can do mathematical 
work comparison work or simply 
setting proper registers. Do not 
confuse comparisons made in a 
process with those made in a 
logical decision. These are not 
similar and are handled quite 
differently by the computer. 




The Process Symbol 

Using the process symbol is 
fairly straight forward. For each 
piece of processing you do, you 
will use this symbol. For a math- 
ematical formula, we simply draw 
the symbol then write the formula 
within. For comparison work, we 
indicate what the computer is com- 
paring such as Compare A to B. 
in register setting we can simply 
state what were setting by indicat- 
ing the name of the register, and its 
new value such as Reg A=567 or if 
a string variable then Reg A=rest. 



• Metamorphosis - 



A process symbol is also used to 
indicate the loading of a separate 
module which the program bads 
uses then forgets until the module 
is needed again then it will reload 
it, use it again, and forget it again. 

I know all of this is very con- 
fusing and as I do not wish to get 
into heavy details on the subject 
of flowcharting, I suggest you find 
yourself a book on flowcharting 
and go over carefully. It is a sub- 
ject requiring more detail than I 
plan on giving. 

There are several more sym- 
bols that I have not covered and 
again feel that the details of which 
are far beyond the scope of this se- 
ries. In the next installment, we 
will cover syntax and the need to

Review: 

InfoXpress 



by Keith Bauer 



Keith Bauer, 36, has been using OS9 
since '87 while juggling his duties 
as a husband and father along with 
his computer time. Keith has written 
several programs for OS -9, only some 
of zvhich have been made available to 
the public. 




Of all my purchases at this 
year's fest in Chicago, the one that I 
was most excited about was InfoX- 
press. It was also the purchase that 
I was most apprehensive about. I 
had heard that you could set this 
program up to call Delphi and 
CompuServe in the middle of the 
night. I had visions of a 4 hour 
phone call on my bill. 

InfoXpress is written by 
Wiiliam Dickhaus and distributed 
by the Dirt Cheap Computer Stuff 
Co. It is available for OS-9 on both 
the 68xxx machines and the CoCo 
3. I amusing it on an MM/1. The 
hardware requirements are pretty 
basic. You must have at least one 
floppy with a minimum of 720k ca- 
pacity or a hard drive. I strongly 
suggest a hard drive, as InfoXpress 
works with some rather large data 
files. You also need a hardware se- 
rial port, and this port must be ca- 
pable of dropping the Data Trans- 
mit Ready line when a path to the 
port is closed. You cannot use a 
bitbanger port. Of course you will 
need a modem, and it must be ca- 
pable of resetting itself when DTK 
is dropped by the serial port. The 
last requirement is memory. You 
will need a minimum of 512k. On 
OS-9 Level II systems, you will 
need at least 192k free and 10k of 
system map space. 

Since I was in Chicago and 
my MM/1 was 300 miles away 1 
had time to actually read the man- 
ual. When you Hrst look at the 
manual, you realize this is no ordi- 
nary package you just bought. The 
manual comes in a 7" x 9" 3 ring 
binder. The pages are very crisp 
and easy to read, very profession- 
al. InfoXpress does have an install 
script file for getting everything 
setup, but it is fairlv basic. 1 would 
like to sec something that is moro 
interactive, asking you where you 
want to store the script files and 
the help files and which com- 
mands directory to copy InfoXpress 
to. You should also be able to run 
the install program right from the 
floppy, after you made a backup 
copy of course, and put the files in 
their proper place. The files come 
compressed in AR format, and you 



need to copy the supplied AR ex- 
ecutable file as well as the install 
script file to the directory in which 
you will be setting up InfoXpress. 
I chose the root directory on /h0. 
The install program makes a direc- 
tory called IX and then calls AR to 
unarchive all the files to this direc- 
tory. It then sets the attributes on 
IX and IXUSAGE and copies these 
to the /dd/emds directory. All in 
all not a bad way to do it but I still 
feel that it would be nice to pop the 
floppy in, type install and let it go 
from there. 

Once it was installed I had 
to check out the configuration 
file. There are two files provid- 
ed that you can check to see how 
things are done. The default file 
(defaultini) is set up to call Com- 
puServe and capture two lorums 
and mail. 

f won't go into each option 
that you can set up, but I will list 
a few. You can have it save a log 
of your login and forum entry 
times as well as the exit times. On 
the OSK version you can save all 
the information that is sent out as 
well as that which is sent out to a 
log. This corner in handy in case 
you have a problem logging on at 
night. You can go through this and 
see what took place. You can setup 
the network option to try different 
nodes in case one is down or busy. 
You are also able to setup modem 
initialization strings. 

InfoXpress allows you to 
define how long you want to keep 
messages, and each message base 
can have a different life span. You 
can also set a history option to save 
all messages after they become 
old or you can just save those 
messages that are to /from you. 

I just changed the defaults to 
match where I stored the help and 
snipt files that InfoXpress uses. 1 
changed the phone number , user 
id , and password, of course, as 
well as the entry for a 9600 baud 
modem. With these few changes 1 
was ready to give it a test run. 

If you use the defaultini 
file you will need to be in that 
directory or use the -c= option and 



-13- 



- Metamorphosis- 



give it the full path to where the 
file is located. Once you are in 
InfoXpress help is just a keystroke 
away. By pressing the '/' key a 
list of all the options comes up. 
You will see that you have many 
options when going online. You 
can just process your requests 
(send your messages) or go online 
in manual mode. The option that 
you will use most often is to go 
online in automatic mode. You 
just select 'o' and choose which 
service, or all, you would like it to 
call everyone. Then just sit back 
and watch it perform. 

When you go online for the 
first time you must set your high 
message number. Unless you 
were keeping a log you will most 
likely have to login with your 
telcom program and check to see 
what the last message was you 
read. If you do not tell InfoXpress 
this you will start at the beginning 
and most likely run up a very large 
bill. You set the high message 
number by selecting / h' , choose a 
system and enter in the message 
number. 



Once you have collected all 
the messages, you can then read 
them using InfoXpress. You can 
either view all the messages in 
a given forum or just the new 
messages. Most times it will be 
just the new ones. InfoXpress will 
show the messages in threads, 
and you can move forward and 
backward through them. If you 
see one that you want to reply to 
just press y. You then have the 
option of quoting text from the 
message you are replying to or 
not. Your favorite editor is then 
fired up (the editor name is taken 
from a setting in the default.ini 
file) and you use it as you normally 
would. If you choose to include 
the text from the message you are 
replying to InfoXpress will insert a 
V before each line. When you are 
done, just save the message and 
quit your editor as you normally 
would. You are then returned to 
the message and you can continue 
to read the remainder of your 
messages. 

I think the best feature about 
InfoXpress is its ability to be run in 



the middle of the night when the 
phone rates are the best and the 
services are the least active. 

InfoXpress has proven to be 
an EXTREMELY solid program. I 
have run across only one bug that 
needs to be fixed. If you 'zap' a

Modem Madness 
....the beginning 

by Rogelio Perea 



Rogelio Perea, 26, has worked on 
various Color Computers from an 
MC-10 (still has it) to his CoCo HI 
since they first became available. He 
has worked with TRS-80 Model I and 
III and has written a number of highly 
technical programs, Wlien he is not 
working at his job as Chief Engineer 
for a major AM/FM radio station, he 
is busy with his family. 



And it all begun with the 
Direct Connect Modem Pak. 

Yes, for me the world of 
telecommunications opened up 
using the DCM. I have worked 
with Color Computers since I was 
in college, way back in 1982. They 
tought us 6800 uP programming 
there and the CoCo 1 was a natural 
at class. Now I am a proud own- 
er of a 512 K CoCo 3, CM-8, FD- 
502 with 2 drives, a DMP106 print- 
er driven by a parallel interface 
and about 100 floppy s filled with 
software. One coworker asked 
me at some time, "You should put 
up a modem with your comput- 
er", beign skeptical then I replied, 
"A modem?, what for?'' Now I 
KNOW what for! 

Visiting the RS store in my 
area f found a DCM for about 
10 dollars, so I decided to get 
one (a real bargain)- Cot home, 
hooked it up and played with 
it for some time, the pain of 
pluging the PAKs in and out did n't 
bother me enough, after installing 
the phone line I was ready to 
get on line with whomever came 
across. I dialed some BBS's and 
after getting a response it felt 
really good to become part of this 
comunity in a more direct fashion. 
The limited display of the DCM 
and its 300 baud speed started to 
get bothersome (and expensive!!!), 
that's when I decided to get a real 
communications program with an 
external modem also. At work 
I have an account with CIS, so 
using the PC's there I began to look 
around for software. 

After joining the CoCo and 
OS9 Forums I downloaded Mick- 
ey term, Ultima term and Greg- 
E-Term. Trouble was, how to 
transfer the files to my CoCo at 
home. Fortunately, Procomm Plus 
(the package I use with the PC) 
has a mini -host option within, after 
setting this mini-BBS at the office I 
ran to my home to do some exper- 
imentation. Hooked up the DCM 
with a tape recorder and got on- 
line with the PCPlus BBS. The file 
transfer was rather lengthy but 
succesfull. Then came the task 



to transfer the data on the tape 
to the disk, an easy task acom- 
plished with a file transfer pro- 
gram. All was OK now, the files 
were on the disk, but, they were 
not executable!!! Why? Well, 
the DCM saves the files on tape, 
and this tape file has absolute- 
ly no definition as what type of 
file is saved there, and this situ- 
ation reflects also in the disk file. 
Out it came the trusty old disk 
editor, changed the file attribute 
bytes on the directory at track 
17 and presto! For some reason, 
only Mickeyterm worked correct- 
ly (maybe a dropout in the tape 
ruined the other two) but it was 
enough to set up the external mo- 
dem. 

It has been a while since that 
experience with the DCM. It shure 
paid off more than enough the 10 
bucks I invested!!! Now, I use 
Ultima term 4.0 most of the time 
(1 like* 1 hi' little window were the 
incoming or outgoing data scrolls 
through) and I'm ready to get 
things running at more than the 
2400 baud the bit-banger limits me 
now (with the aid of a stray MP1 1 
found at a swap meet). Maybe the 
DCM will get some use as a RS232 
Pak. Still, I HAVE to try using the 
bit-banger port with OS9, as I have 
found a driver that supposedly 
makes OS9 work at 1200 baud. 
I'll get my hands on this and will 
share my findings with all the 
CoCo comunity.

Early History 

Development 

of the OS-9 
Community 

NetWork 

by Dove Kelly 



It's been a little over a year 
and a half since some of us on the 
OS9 FIDO echo started talking 
about what we could do to keep 
the OS9 operating system alive. 

Since FIDO has a competent 
organizational structure, it was 
decided to utilize that concept. 
Thus a name, OS-9 Community 
Network (OCN), was adopted 
and an International Coordiantor 
and International Librarian was 
appointed. Then volunteers for the 
coordinators and librarians for the 
9 regions in zone 1 were found. 

A set of guidelines was devel- 
oped stating that the OCN would 
support the preservation of OS-9, 
OSK and OS-9000. Several other 
offices are detailed for when they 
become necessary. This guideline 
is available for downloading from 
any OCN library. 

A request for members was 
announced on the OS-9 and COCO 
echos and to date about 400 people 
have opted to have their names 
listed. These include people from 
Europe, Canada and Australia. 



: .W^f- 







Recently, Peter Tuteiaers, a 
college student majoring in com- 
puter science and living in Leende, 
The Netherlands, has started to 
develop a world wide group of 
OS9/OSK users. There are also 
other networks: OCN now has 
representives on DELPHI, Inter- 
net, AcBBS, and StG. While we 



started on FIDO, we are working 
to expand our area of coverage, 
and messages are exchanged be- 
tween these networks. Peter can be 
reached on the Internet at: 

os 9 pete r9 stack . urc . tue . nl 

An extensive network of OCN 
libraries has been put in place 
to allow anyone to be able to get 
the latest programs as they are 
developed. This list is published 
elsewhere in this issue. You do not 
have to be a member of OCN to 
access these libraries. They are free 
to all. Brian Steward in Chicopee, 
MA, posts the new programs 
as they are received from the 
International Librarian. 

All OCN libraries are set up 
the same. If a program is in a 
certain library SIG on a BBS on the 
east coast, it will be in the same SIG 
on a library on the west coast, thus, 
making it easy to find what you 
want. 

If you wish to have your 
name listed on the membership 
roles, post a message on the OS9, 
COCO, COCO CLUB echos of 
FIDO to Greg Morgan, or write 
him directly:

Metamorphosis- 



Hardware Hacking 
MM/1 Function Keys 

by Znck Sessions 

Using the keyboard function keys on the MM/1 has 
been a bane to both users and programmers since the 
machine first came out. The keyboard driver built into the 
KWindows interface normally uses the function keys to 
flip to different windows. In fact, those keys return nothing 
to the user so even within a program they could not be 
accessed. 

However, recent messages over the computer networks 
have revealed hozv to tnake use of these keys in spite of the 
barriers placed by the KWindows interface. -Ed. 

Using display commands, you '.-in dol'ino 
something which has essentially a Get/ Put butter in it, 
but its contents are handled in a pretty neat way. You 
then load the buffer with data with a display statement 
like the following: 

$ display lb 2b fO fkn 00 00 01 00 01 00 
05 /dir/ Od 00 

For the fkn parameter, substitute a value from $01 
to $08. This number relates to the eight function keys 
Fl to F8. Notice that OSK display can display text by 
enclosing the data with forward slashes. What this 
command does is equate the character string dir<CR> 
with a function key. In this example, say fkn is $01, 
then any time after the display command the Fl key is 
pressed, the MM/1 will act just like one had keyed in 
dir<CR>. Instant variable function keys! 

Note that the TYP byte is $00, and the values of the 
X size and Y size are irrelevent, but a value larger than 
zero must be used (I think!). The size bytes MUST be 
right and must contain the length of the string, plus a 
possible (but not required!) carriage return byte ($0d), 
and also include the terminating $00 byte. 

With Windio edition 46, the function keys Fl to 
F8 no longer select windows 1 through 8. The only 
keys now used to flip to another window are the F9 
and F10 keys. They still work as they used to, and 
you probably cannot redefine them with the previous 
command. (I don't know, I haven't bothered to try) 

The 1*0 before the fkn means thai this is a 
system-wide function key definition and the buffer 
number is the number of the function key. If you do 
the display command in / wl, and you flip to / w2 and 
hit the approptiate function key, it will react as it was 
programmed in the other window. 

One can override the system definition first 
defining the data in a normal Get/ Put buffer. For 
example, if your pid is $06 and you want to use buffer 
number $2a, and you want to use the Fl key to now 



do an mdir -e command instead, you would define the 
buffer with: 

$ display lb 2b 06 2a 00 00 01 00 01 00 
09 /mdir -e/ Od 00 

This just defines the buffer, a normal Get/ Put 
buffer which obviously does NOT contain "graphical 
data"! Next, to tell windio that this buffer is to now be 
the return value of a function key, you would do the 
following display command: 

$ display le 2 6 grp b£n fkn 

Where the values of grp and bfn should be 
obvious, and fkn is, as before, a number between 

$01-$08. 

There is NO way to revert this back to the 
previously defined system-wide command IN THE 
CURRENT WINDOW! You can, of course, define 
another process specific Get/ Put buffer which has the 
same definition as a previously defined system -wide 
definiton. Function key associations using the last 
display code sequence are good for the life of the 
window they were issued in and good ONLY in the 
window they were defined in. 

So, if you want to use some application specific 
definitions in a program, it is best to open a path to 
the next window, /w, and use that window for all 
screen operations and new function key associations. 
When you close the path to that window and 
re-select your original standard IO path window, 
you go back to the system wide definitions (if any).
