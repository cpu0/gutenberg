In an era of heightened 
environmental 
awareness, finding sites 
to dispose of solid waste 
is a difficult, complicated 
and tedious process, 
often a tug-of-war 
between state and local 
community officials. 

Each candidate 
landfill site must meet a 
series of rigorous criteria, for example, slope, 
distance to cultural features, surface and subsurface 
hydrology, soil erosion potential and land 

ownership; in addition, 
the site must be 
sufficiently distant from 
residential areas, 
schools, airports, 
population centers and 
endangered species 
habitats. 

Researchers at Ohio 
University, Athens, Ohio, 
are trying to make site 
selection less complex 
by programming 
computer software to 
help evaluate a 
candidate site. Their tool 
is a NASA-developed 
program called CLIPS, a 
software shell for 
developing expert 
systems. Originally 
developed by Johnson 
Space Center, CLIPS is 
designed to allow 


At Ohio University, assistant geography professor James Lein (left) has 
adapted a NASA computer program to a novel use: simplifying the evaluation 
and selection of landfill sites for solid waste disposal. An expert system 
developed with the CLIPS program uses details about a candidate site, such 
as topography (above) or adjacent water sources (upper right) to determine 
whether the site meets requirements. 


research and development of artificial intelligence on 
conventional computers. 

Says Dr. James Lein, assistant professor of Ohio 
University’s Geography Department: 

“We structure the rules and parameters 
surrounding the decision-making process and CLIPS 
provides an estimate of whether a particular site 
fulfills the siting requirements.” With an expert 
system, the reasoning mechanisms influencing site 
selection can be defined more clearly and the system 
can be modified to reflect changes in legislation or 
new information. With an expert system the site 
selection process is less difficult, reducing the time 
and costs involved. CLIPS was supplied to Ohio 
LJniversity by the Computer Software Management 
and Information Center (COSMIC)®, NASA’s 
mechanism for helping industrial, government and 
institutional organizations to effect significant 
reduction of automation costs. 

Information processing by computer is still 
experiencing explosive growth in the United States. 




Thousands of organizations are joining the ranks of 
computer users annually, while longtime users are 
regularly finding new ways to improve their 
operations through greater automation. NASA’s way 
of helping them cut costs is providing them, at low 
cost, previously developed computer programs that 
have secondary utility. 

Development of an entirely new program is time 
consuming and expensive. Frequently, however, a 
program developed for one purpose can be adapted 
to an entirely different application. Thus, software 
users can save time and money by taking advantage 
of COSMIC’s service; they can purchase a program 
for a fraction of its original cost and get a return 
many times the investment, even when the cost of 
adapting the program to a new use is considered. 

The CLIPS program has proved a valuable 
research tool for a wide variety of applications. At 
Ohio University, researchers are also exploring use 
of CLIPS to assist in historic preservation, which 
involves identification, inventory and selection of 
structures — or entire areas — that have special 
cultural or historic significance. 

Other examples of CLIPS’ versatility include its 
use to monitor product quality and quantity at a 
chemical plant; its employment by an attorney to 
help him decide which facts from a casefile are most 
pertinent; and its use as the core of an advanced 
software system that gives a user engineer instant 


expertise in disciplines in which he is not skilled. 
Another use of CLIPS is its inclusion in a text book 
— Expert Systems: Principles and Programming, by 
Joe Giarratano and Gary D. Riley — in use at 40 
colleges and universities. CLIPS serves as the prime 
example of an expert system development tool in 
the book; sample CLIPS applications are included on 
a disc bound with the text book, enabling students 
to design and develop their own expert systems. 

Widely used in business and government, CLIPS 
represents only one of thousands of examples 
wherein users have benefited from COSMIC’s service.

Among examples of COSMIC program uses by 
industry are: 

MIL 3, Washington, D.C., a developer of 
software for the communications industry, supplies a 
software package — called OPNET — for 
developing simulations of communications satellite 
networks. OPNET easily supports geosynchronous or 
“stationary” satellites. However, the movement of 
low Earth orbit satellites was not supported and the 
frequent loss of communications when Earth blocks 
the line-of-sight between satellite and Earth station 
was not predictable. 

In order to support predictions of low Earth orbit 
as an interim measure, pending a planned 
advancement of OPNET that will allow predicting 
satellite occlusion, MIL 3 is using a COSMIC program 
called ASAP (Artificial Satellite Analysis Program) as 
an OPNET enhancement. MIL 3 translated the ASAP 
program from the original FORTRAN to C language 
and integrated the modified version of ASAP into 
OPNET. The ability to directly utilize ASAP code has 
enabled MIL 3 to offer low Earth orbit satellite 
modeling capability much sooner. A planned OPNET 
advancement involves development of a customized 
second-generation orbital mechanics program based 
on ASAP. 

Heath Tecna Aerospace Company, Kent, 
Washington, a major supplier of composite 
structures, designed and built the first full scale 
composite hybrid rocket motorcase. Looking for a 
computer program that would predict stresses in the

Located at the 
University of Georgia, 
Athens, Georgia, NASA’s 
Computer Software 
Management and 
Information Center 
(COSMIC) is custodian 
of the large “bank” of 
computer programs 
developed in the course 
of work sponsored by 
NASA, the Department 
of Defense and other 
technology generating 
agencies of the 
government. 

COSMIC gets a 
continual flow of these 
government-developed 
software packages and 
identifies those that can 
be adapted to secondary 
usage. The center stores 
and maintains the 
programs and informs potential customers of their 
availability through a catalog and through notices in 
the publication NASA Tech Briefs. 

COSMIC’s library contains more than 1,200 
programs for such purposes as structural analysis, 
artificial intelligence, computational fluid dynamics, 
thermal analysis, image processing, project 
management and a great 
variety of other 
functions. The center has 
distributed thousands of 
programs, some of 
which have made 
possible savings 
amounting to millions of 
dollars. Thus, COSMIC’s 
service represents one of 
the broadest areas of 
economic benefit 
resulting from secondary 
use of government 
developed technology.

The test motor was 
built under contract to 
American Rocket 
Company (AMROC), 
builder of privately- 
developed rocket launch 
vehicles. Heath Tecna 
confirmed the 
predictions of the 
COSMIC program by 
testing a subscale 
motorcase to failure. A 
full-scale 22-foot 
motorcase was then 
fabricated and 
successfully test fired by 
AMROC. 

Scientific-Atlanta 
Inc., Atlanta, Georgia, is 
an internationally 
known leader in cable 
television electronics 
and satellite 
communications 
networks. Company 
engineers were assigned 
the task of designing a 

new Cassegrain antenna, which consists of a primary 
radiator, a multimode hom to receive signals, a main 
reflector and a subreflector. 

Researchers found — and purchased — the 
COSMIC program “Machine Design of Cassegrain 
Feed System,” which seemed uniquely formulated to 
design this special type of antenna. The program 
allowed for computer simulations of the antenna’s 
performance, allowing engineers to change the 


design before any 
hardware was actually 
built. The program saved 
time and money in the 
design process, and 
additionally enabled 
engineers to build a 
vertex tuning plate 
intended to redirect 
scattered energy, which 
provided for greater operational economy.

in energy efficiency and quality might be achieved in

Along with other 
software, the company 
used a COSMIC program 
to evaluate technology intended to increase 
productivity and reduce energy usage in the reheat 
process. The COSMIC program — the General 
Thermal Analyzer Program — solves steady state and 
transient thermal problems using desk top 
computers. Salem Automation used it in modeling 
reheat furnaces; for example, the program can 
simulate how slabs in a proposed furnace will heat 
during operation.
