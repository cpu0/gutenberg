INTRODUCTION 


This document describes the mathematical techniques used by the NOSC Performance Oriented 
Design (POD) tool. The POD evaluates and predicts the performance of Computer Systems in terms of 
Response Time, Throughput, and Utilization. An algorithm that is extensible to distributed systems is also 
provided. 

MEAN VALUE ANALYSIS (MVA) 

Mean Value Analysis (MVA) is a technique for analyzing queueing networks that represent computer 
systems. MVA provides a developer with important performance measures such as Response Time, 
Throughput, Queue Length, and Device Utilization. 

MVA NOTATIONS AND DEFINITIONS 

Notations 

Model Inputs 

A e - Customer arrival rate for class c (for open classes) or 

N c - Number of class c terminals (for closed classes), i.e., number of terminals from which 
class c customers originate. 

Z c - Class c think time. 

S C|d - Class c service demand at queueing center/device d. 

Model Outputs 
Class Measures 

R c - Response Time for class c. 

X c - Throughput for class c. 

Device Measures 

U C|d - Class c utilization at device d. 

Q c d - Class c average queue length at device d. 

Definitions 

The following is a list of commonly used MVA terms that are also shown in figure 1, performance 
measures. 

Class 

A class is a group of customers with each customer of that group having the same workload 
intensities (A c , N c , or N e and Z c ) and service demand (S c d ). A class MUST define the service 
demand (S e d ) at each device used.

X: throughput Z: think time 

R: response time k. arrival rate = customers/time 

N: number of terminals

Figure 1. Performance measures. 


Throughput 

Throughput is the number of customers serviced by a device, xj is device throughput. 

Response Time 

Response Time is the time a customer spends at a device r^. 

System Throughput 

System Throughput is the number of customers serviced by the system within a given period of 
time. X = £x,. 

i 

System Response Time 

System Response Time is the sum time a customer spends at each device. R = ^ r 4 . 

Device Utilisation ' 

Device Utilization is a ratio between the busy time (time a device is being used) and the available 

time of the device. This ratio describes the extent of utilization of a device. Utilization is defined * 

as less than equal to 1.0; therefore, 0.S utilization means half of the device’s possible capacity is 

being used. 

Device Queue Length 1 

Device Queue Length is the number of customers waiting for service in a particular queueing 
center. 


2 






Think Time 

Think Time represents the time a user spends before submitting a customer. 

Arrival Rate 

Arrival Rate is the rate of customers arriving at a queue per unit time. 

Queueing Center 

Queueing center is a means of representing a resource and waiting area (queue). In this queueing 
center, a customer arrives for service and waits in line (the queue) until the resource is available. 
This may represent a bank teller line or a computer CPU. See figure 2. 



Figure 2. Queueing center. 

Queueing Network 

A Queueing Network is a set of queueing centers. Figure 3 is an example of a queueing network 
with three queueing centers. 



Figure 3. Network of queues. 


SIMPLE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES 

Given here are simple algorithms for solving a basic queueing system. These algorithms illustrate MVA 
concepts. POD formulas are given by an Open System or a Closed System.

Open System 


A Queueing Network is open if customers arrive from outside the system. Arrival rate denotes arrival 
intensity. See figure 4. 



► 


arrival rate 

Figure 4. Open system. 


Throughput 


X c = ^-c - 

Throughput equals arrival rate if utilization <= 1. 

^c.d = k c S Ci j. 

Utilization of class c at device d equals arrival rate of class c customers times class c service 
demand at device d. 

Response Time 

R«.d 


Response time of class c at device d equals service demand of class c at d over 1 minus the sum of 
the utilizations of each class c at d (as 0 s£ U c ,d Si, 1 -Z U e .d is unused capacity of d). 

Therefore, class c system response time 

D 

= 2 ] ®c,d 

dal 

is the sum of class c response times over all devices d, where D is the total number of devices in 
the system. 

Closed System 

A Queueing Network is closed if customers are generated inside the system (such as in a terminal 
system). In closed classes, the number of class c terminals (N c ) and think time for each class c terminal 
denote workload intensity (Z c ). Figure 5 is an example of a closed system with N terminals and one 
queueing center.

Solution Techniques 
Response Time 

Given ^(N) = Q c ,d(N - l c ), that is, the class c Arrival Instant Queue length of device d with N 
total terminals is equal to the queue length of class c at d with one less class c terminal, then 

Rc,a(N) = S e . d (l + I c .d(N)); 

that is, the response of class c time at device d with N terminals is equal to the class c service 
demand at d times the quantity of 1 phis the class c arrival instant queue length of d with N 
terminals. 

Throughput 


X C (N) = -yp- . 

Z c + J Rc.d(N) 

d*l 

Class c throughput with N terminals equals the number of class c terminals over class c think time 
plus the sum of class c response times. 

Queue Length 


Qc.d(N) = X C (N) Rc.d(N). 

This equation is the queue length at device d of the class c terminals. 

Z 



N: number of terminals 
Z: think time

POD ALGORITHM 


The main algorithm for POD is an Approximate MV A for mixed models. A mixed model contains 
techniques for solving both open and closed queueing networks. The POD algorithm also uses an approxi¬ 
mation technique for determining Arrival Instant Queue length. The Approximation technique is required 
because Exact techniques have large memory and computation demands. 

Approximation Technique for Arrival Instant Queue Length of Closed 
Systems 

The basic MVA algorithm for response time R is 
R c,k = s c,k (! + Qc.k)- 

Queue length Q is required but is hard to obtain exactly. Therefore, an Approximation technique is 
needed. The Queue Length Approximation technique is useful because it allows analysis of a queueing 
network (a representation of a computer system) using MVA techniques without the large memory and 
computational demands associated with Exact MVA techniques. The Approximation, together with MVA 
(known as Approximation MVA), estimate the queue length at a device (for all classes served at that 
device). This estimate is used as a parameter for the response time equation. 

The algorithm is 

given: N c = number of class c terminals 
D = number of devices 

1. For all c, d 

c = (0 ... 0) with c zero elements 
d = (0 ... 0) with d zero elements 



Initialize Q c d to the number of users divided by the number of devices. 

c c 1 

2. A c , d (N) = X Q Jid (N - l c ) where £ Q i- d * N > " Tr' Q c.d( N )- 

j=i j=i INc 

Approximate Arrival Instant Queue length by estimating the Queue length with minus one class 
c terminal. This should give us a view of the queue that an arriving customer will observe. 


POD MIXED MODEL ALGORITHM 

A simpler version of this algorithm is found in Quantitative System Performance by Edward D. 
Lazowska et al. (1984), that evaluates a mixed system model. Using this algorithm, POD is able to analyze 
systems that have both open classes (external input) and closed classes (such as cycle events of keyboard 
input). The basic approach is to determine the utilization caused by the open classes (this can be immedi¬ 
ately obtained by O, open class) and “hiding” that utilization from the closed classes. This is done through 
a technique known as “inflation” and (as a mathematical convenience) increases the service time of the 
closed class proportional to the amount of utilization “hidden” from them. The algorithm follows. 


6 





Let O be the set of open classes and C be the set of closed classes. 

1. Obtain the utilization for each device in the open classes: 

U c .d = V D Cik , c £ {O}.

APPROACH FOR MODELING SYNCHRONIZATION IN ADA-BASED SYSTEMS: 
RENDEZVOUS ANALYSIS 


ADA-based systems have (as a language feature) primitive mechanisms for specifying synchronization 
among tasks. Synchronized communication of data is known as Rendezvous. Since communication is a 
very important component of Distributed Systems, it is important to know through analysis the delays that 
may occur during Rendezvous. (See figure 6.)

ANALYSIS OF RENDEZVOUS 


The Analysis oi Rendezvous is complex due to the number of variables needed to parametrize a 
realistic State Space Balance model. A rendezvous is a synchronous communication between two tasks. 
For a rendezvous to occur, the sending task initiates an Entry Call (ADA construct for requesting a 
rendezvous) and the receiving task ACCEPTS (another ADA construct) the rendezvous. The complexity 
of this problem is increased because there can be several tasks attempting a rendezvous with a single 
Accepting task. Since only one Entry Call can be serviced at a time, the others queue (wait) in first-come, 
first-serve (FCFS) order. Also, the Accepting task may have contention for its computing resource. A 
queueing formation of this problem can view the Accepting task as a server with the rate of service varying 
inversely with the total system utilization and the Entry Call as workload class arriving.(See figure 7.) 

The problem with this approach is that the server (Accepting task) execution rate varies with utiliza¬ 
tion. The State Space Balance Equation solution yields a very complex three-dimensional Markov chain. 
Solving this Markov chain is infeasible due to space and time requirements. Developing a State Space 
Balance Equation does give insight to approximation techniques that could be used.

DISTRIBUTED MVA (DMVA) SOLUTION 


The basic Distributed Mean Value Analysis (DMVA) algorithm uses an "Active” Flow Equivalent 
Service Center whose service rate is inversely proportional to the utilization of its CPU. The following 
(figure 8) is an algorithm using DMVA for analyzing a rendezvous.

Assumr iions 

The system is composed of two CPUs with the Entry Call residing on one CPU and the Accepting task 
(along with other jobs) on the second CPU. 

Algorithm 

1. Solve the Queueing Network for the Entry Call’s system (QNO) by replacing the Accepting task 
with a dummy or shadow device. 

2. Solve the Queueing Network for the Accepting task’s system (QN1) (1) by using QNO throughput 
as the arrival rate for the Accepting task, and (2), by using the utilization "hiding” method and 
subtracting the utilization caused by other classes. 

3. Iterate from step 1 until QNO and QN1 throughputs converge.
