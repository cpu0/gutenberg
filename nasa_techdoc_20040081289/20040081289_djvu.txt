ABSTRACT 

On December 30* 2000, the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft reached the perijove 
milestone on its continuing journey to the Satumian system. During an extended six- 
month encoimter, the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) returned spectra of the 
Jovian atmosphere, rings and satellites from 10-1400 cm"' (1000-7 [xm) at a 
programmable spectral resolution of 0.5 to 15 cm"\ The improved spectral resolution 
of CIRS over previous IR instrument-missions to Jupiter, the extended spectral range, 
and higher signal-to-noise performance provide significant advantages over previous 
data sets. 

CIRS global observations of the mid-infrared spectrum of Jupiter at medium 
resolution (2.5 cm'') have been analysed both with a radiance differencing scheme 
and an optimal estimation retrieval model to retrieve the spatial variation of phosphine 
and ammonia fractional scale height in the troposphere between 60° S and 60° N at a 
spatial resolution of 6°. The ammonia fractional scale height appears to be high over 
the Equatorial Zone (EZ) but low over the North Equatorial Belt (NEB) and South 
Equatorial Belt (SEB) indicating rapid uphft or strong vertical mixing in the EZ. The 
abundance of phosphine shows a similar strong latitudinal variation which generally 
matches that of the ammonia fractional scale height. However while the ammonia 
fractional scale height distribution is to a first order symmetric in latitude, the 
phosphine distribution shows a North/South asymmetry at mid latitudes with higher 
amoimts detected at 40° N than 40° S. In addition the data show that while the 
ammonia fractional scale height at this spatial resolution appears to be low over the 
Great Red Spot (GRS), indicating reduced vertical mixing above the -500 mb level, 
the abundance of phosphine at deeper levels may be enhanced at the northern edge of 
the GRS indicating upwelling. 



1. Introduction 

Between October 2000 and March 2001 the Cassini/Huygens spacecraft passed by 

Jupiter in its way to Saturn. At its closest approach on December 30* 2000, the 

spacecraft was 9,700,000 km away from Jupiter (136 Rj). During the fly-by, Cassini's 

remote sensing instruments were activated to observe Jupiter and in this paper we 

report the observations of Jupiter by the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) of 

spectral emission features of phosphine, and adjacent or overlapping ammonia 

features. 

Phosphine is a disequilibrium species in the cold upper tropospheres of the giant 

planets. Its abundance is primarily govemed by temperature-dependent equilibriation 

reactions such as (e.g. Atreya 1986) 

4PH3 + 6H2O D P4O6 + 12H2, (1) 

and at the cold temperatures found in the Jovian upper troposphere its equilibrium 

abundance is expected to be undetectable. However the equilibration reaction (Eq. 1) 

is very slow, and in Jupiter's atmosphere the vertical transport of air due to convection 

appears to be fast enough to lead to a significant abundance in the observable 

troposphere of approximately 6x10''' (Kunde et al, 1982). Once in the upper 

troposphere, in addition to equilibration reactions, phosphine is also destroyed by 

solar UV photolysis to produce a number of possible species such as diphosphine 

(P2H2). Because of these destruction processes, regions of enhanced phosphine 

abundance indicate rapid vertical mean uplift, or equivalently, vigorous vertical eddy 

mixing, which transports phosphine from the deep interior faster than it can be 

destroyed. The spectral absorption features of phosphine are clearly seen in Jupiter's 

infrared spectrum in the far-IR, mid-IR and at 5-fxm wavelengths. These specfra have 

been used to determine that the mean abundance profile of phosphine has a 'deep' 



(i.e. at pressures greater than 1 bar) volxime mixing ratio (v.m.r.) of 6x10'^ (Kunde et 
al., 1982), and that at pressures less than 1 bar, the combined effects of vertical eddy- 
mixing, photodissociation and equilibration reactions, cause the abundance of 
phosphine to decrease with height with a fractional scale height (f.s.h.) of 
approximately 0.3 (Carlson et al, 1993; Irwui et al, 1998). 

A number of studies have also been made to investigate the spatial variation of 
phosphine. Griffith et al. (1992) reanalysed Voyager IRIS data to determine the 
tropospheric abundances of phosphine and ammonia aroimd the Great Red Spot 
(GRS). Since the GRS is thought to be a region of uplift at pressures greater than 500 
mbar (Flasar et al, 1981; Conrath et al., 1981), it was expected that the abundances of 
both species should be enhanced in the GRS. However no enhancement of phosphine 
was observed and indeed the abundance of armnonia appeared, unexpectedly, to be 
depleted. Lara et al. (1998) used the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) to 
examine the thermal emission spectrum of Jupiter from 10° S to 40° S and several 
longitudes, between 10.5 and 11.2 fxm. (891 - 956 cm*'). The abundances of both 
phosphine and ammonia were found to increase towards the equator, consistent with 
the Equatorial Zone (EZ) being a region of upwelling, or more rapid vertical mixing. 
However the abundance of ammonia was not found to vary over the GRS and while 
the abundance of phosphine appeared slightly enhanced, the enhancement was less 
than the estimated error of their retrievals. Edgington et al. (1998) analysed UV 
spectra observed by the HST Faint Object Spectrograph from 6° N to 48° N, and 
deduced the same decrease in upper tropospheric anmionia abundance away from the 
equator observed by Lara et al. (1998). Although Edgington et al. (1998) determined 
the mean mixing ratio of phosphine at the 140-mb level they were imable to extract 
any latitudinal dependence. 



Meridional variation in the abundance of ammonia at deeper levels has been 
inferred from ground-based radio observations by de Pater (1986) at a wavelength of 
approximately 2 cm. A clear latitudinal variation of brightness temperature was 
observed and interpreted as being due to a variation in the ammonia v.m.r. between 
0.5 and 2 bars of -2x10'^ in the Equatorial Belts, increasing to 5x10"^ in the EZ. 

In this paper the spectra recorded by the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) 
during Cassini's fly-by of Jupiter are analysed to retrieve, for the first time, the spatial 
distribution of both phosphine and ammonia in the upper troposphere at almost all 
longitudes and from 60° S to 60° N latitude at a spatial resolution of 6°. The retrieved 
maps show a clear latitudinal structure of both phosphine and ammonia, indicating 
variations in vertical fransport, and also indicate a depletion of upper level ammonia, 
and a possible slight enhancement of deep phosphine, over the GRS. 

2. CIRS observations. 
CIRS (Calcutt et al, 1992; Kunde et al, 1996), a successor of the versatile Infrared 
Specfrometer and Radiometer (IRIS) instruments flown on Voyagers 1 and 2, is a 
coordinated pair of interferometers designed to measure infrared radiation from 10 to 
1400 cm"' (1000 to 7 [xm) with a variable spectral resolution that can be set from 0.5 
to 15 cm'\ The two interferometers are situated opposite each other across the cenfral 
axis of the instrument and jointly share the received light from the 50-cm diameter 
telescope situated outside and in front of the instrument housing. 

The mid-infrared interferometer is a classic Michelson design and has two different 
focal planes (FP3: 600 - 1100 cm"^ FP4: 1100 - 1400 cm'') each consisting of 1x10 
arrays of square photoconductive, and photovoltaic detectors respectively with 
individual fields-of-view (FOV) of 0.27 mrad. The small field-of-view and high 



spectral resolution of the mid-infrared channels require that the detectors be cooled to 
80 K via an external radiator which greatly increases their sensitivity compared to the 
IRIS detectors. The mirror system of the mid-infrared interferometer utilizes comer- 
cube reflectors to make the interferometer more rugged and less prone to 
misalignment. 

The second interferometer operates in the far-infrared (10 - 600 cm"') and is a 
polarizing interferometer with a circular FOV of 4.3 mrad (just like Voyager ERIS). 
The far-infrared interferometer is a Martin-Puplett type which' uses polarizing wire 
grids and a pair of bolometers to separate and recombine the different polarizations of 
the incoming signal thereby removing the DC component from the resulting 
interferogram. This makes the spectrometer less susceptible to instrumental drifts and 
increases the measurement precision. 

Because both interferometers share the same mirror and drive assembly, the 
maximum spectral resolution (0.5 cm'' — almost a factor of ten better than that 
achieved by Voyager IRIS) is the same for both interferometers and is dependent 
upon the scan length. 

Cassini-Huygens, a joint NASA-ESA mission, was laimched in 1997 on a 
circuitous path utilising gravity-assists from Venus, Earth and Jupiter to propel itself 
towards its fiaal destination of the Satumian system, where it will arrive in July 2004. 
For the six months between 1 October 2000 and 22 March 2001 during Cassini's fly- 
by of Jupiter the Composite Infrared Spectrometer registered more than 850,000 
spectra of the Jovian atmosphere, satellites and rings. Of particular value are the 
ATMOS02 Jovian atmospheric observations, of which there are four in total: A, B, C 
and D, which were recorded during and immediately after closest approach (see Table 
1). In these observations, the FP3 and FP4 detector arrays were aligned parallel to the 



equator of Jupiter and cyclically scanned from North to South Pole at medium spectral 
resolution (2.5 cm"^ apodised). Each scan lasted approximately 40 minutes and was 
followed by observations of other instruments. Hence successive scans did not 
overlap but were separated by 45° longitude. Complete unbroken coverage was 
possible only by observing Jupiter for two complete rotations and in practice gaps 
occurred in all four maps due to competition for observation time with other 
instruments on the Cassini spacecraft. 

3. Forward Models 

The radiative transfer, or forward model used in this study is a development of code 
previously used to analyse Galileo/NIMS observations of Jupiter (Irwin et al, 1998, 
2001). The code has been converted to run in wavenumber rather than wavelength 
space and uses the method of correlated-^ (Lacis and Oinas, 1991). Although the 
forward model may include scattering (for which correlated-^ is especially useful) the 
effects of scattering were foimd to be negligible for model CIRS spectra and have 
been neglected here. The code has been validated against a number of line-by-line 
models and is found to produce similar results but is very much faster. The small 
differences between synthetic correlated-A: and line-by-line spectra were included in 
the error budget of the retrieval model presented later. 

The forward model uses pre-tabulated A:-distribution data which are calculated from 
line-by-line models for each individual gas confributing to the CIRS spectra. The 
tables cover fifteen temperatures equally spaced between 100 and 350 K, and fifteen 
pressures, equally spaced in log pressure between 1.7x10"^ and 7.5 bar. The gas line 
data is based upon GEISA (Jacquinet-Husson et al, 1999) with a number of 
modifications for line widths and line sfrengths. In particular the lines for phosphine 



R 



were corrected in the V4 band (1121 cm') following Lellouch et al. (2001). The k- 
tables were calculated from to 1500 cm'' in square bins of width 0.25 cm'', and 
were smoothed to lower resolutions as required. The collision-induced absorption of 
H2-H2 and H2-He was also included after Borysow et al. (1985, 1988). 

The Jovian atmospheric temperature profile is represented at 71 pressure levels 
equally spaced in log pressure between 4 and 4x10'' bar. The volume mixing ratio 
(v.m.r.) of each gas is either fixed at all altitudes for constituents such as methane and 
helium, or allowed to vary as follows. Ammonia is assumed to have a fixed v.m.r. of 
xo at pressures greater thanpo = 0.7 bar (the approximate condensation level) and to 
vary at lower pressures as 



^±- r II I I V 



— (2) 

where/is the fractional scale height (f.s.h.). In addition the ammonia profile was 
constrained to have a maximum relative hmnidity of 100%. The profile of phosphine 
was similar but here the deep pressure /7o was set at 1 bar, consistent with previous 
studies mentioned earUer, and there was no constraint on humidity. Cloud opacity was 
also included and modelled as a single cloud based at 1 bar with variable opacity and 
a fractional scale height of 0.5 in rough agreement with the cloud found by the probe 
nephelometer (Ragent et al, 1998) and by Galileo/NIMS and Galileo/SSI cloud 
retrievals (Irwin et al, 2001; Banfield et al, 1998, Simon-Miller et al, 2001b). The 
cloud opacity was assumed to be grey (i.e. constant absorption with wavelength) over 
the limited wavelength ranges considered in the retrievals. 

Figure 1 shows a synthetic reference CIRS spectrum in 750-1230 cm'' region 
covering most of the range of FP3 and part of FP4 using the a priori temperature, 
abundance and cloud assumptions listed in Table 2. Also plotted in Figure 1 are the 
partial derivatives of the spectral radiance with respect to ammonia and phosphine 



(deep v.m.r. and f.s.h.) and also cloud opacity. The altitudes sounded in the mid-IR 
range from 0.2 to approximately 1 bar as may be seen in Figure 2 which shows how 
the peaks of the transmission weighting functions and contribution functions (i.e. the 
transmission weighting functions multiplied by thermal emission of the atmosphere at 
each level and wavelength) vary with wavenumber. Comparing Figvires 1 and 2 it can 
be seen that the wavelengths where the spectrum shows significant sensitivity to 
phosphine (both deep and f.s.h.) correspond to weighting functions peaking near the 1 
bar level and thus this is the pressure level of the phosphine profile that the mid-IR 
spectrum is most sensitive to. More quantitatively, over the 1000-1200 cm"' 
wavenumber range used in the retrievals presented later, the average transmission 
weighting fimction, weighted by the sensitivity to deep phosphine abundance, peaks at 
0.88 bar, and the mean contribution function peaks at 1.2 bar. Similarly, the average 
transmission weighting ftinctions weighted by the sensitivity to phosphine f.s.h., deep 
ammonia abundance, and ammonia f.s.h. peak at 0.82, 0.75, and 0.64 bar respectively. 
Corresponding values for the mean contribution function peaks are 1.1, 0.94, and 0.76 
bar. Hence information on the ammonia abundance comes from higher altitudes than 
for the phosphine profile. It should be noted that the reference spectrum was 
calculated for a cloud-opacity of 0.5 above 1 bar. In more cloudy regions, the 
weighting functions move up and thus the abundance information comes from 
correspondingly higher altitudes. 

Most of the radiance partial derivative curves in Figure 1 (and indeed the radiance 
partial derivatives due to the temperature at different levels, which are not shown) are 
very different from each other and thus many different parameters may be 
independently determined. The main exception is for the two phosphine parameters 
for which the dependence on deep abundance and fractional scale height are found to 



10 



be very similar and in effect indistinguishable. This is due to the absorption lines of 
phosphine only appearing in a limited spectral region, sounding near the 1 bar level. 
Hence the f.s.h. was fixed at the a priori value of 0.3, consistent with a number of 
previous studies (Carlson et al, 1993; Irwin et ah, 1998) and only the deep v.m.r. was 
fitted in the retrievals presented later. 

4. Radiance Differencing 

Retrieving atmospheric composition fi"om remotely sensed spectra is a classic ill- 
posed problem in that many possible atmospheric profiles generate spectra which are 
consistent with the observed spectra, due to uncertainties both in the spectra and in the 
forward model. Hence before analysing the data with complicated retrieval models, it 
was decided to first of all see whether the raw spectra could be simply analysed to 
provide a qualitative indication of the spatial distribution of phosphine. 

The nominal synthetic spectrum and radiance partial derivative curves of Figure 1 
were searched for pairs of wavelengths of equal brightness temperature (and thus 
sounding roughly the same pressure level) which were equally affected by changes in 
temperature, ammonia (both deep volume mixing ratio and fi-actional scale height) 
and cloud opacity, but differentially affected by variations in the phosphine 
abimdance. Pairs with small wavelength differences were preferred over those with 
large wavelength differences since the asstmiption of grey cloud absorption was then 
more valid. Pairs of wavelengths with a brightness temperature of 154 K (sounding 
roughly the 0.7 bar level) in the synthetic specfrum were analysed in this way, and the 
optimum pair was found to be (1 186.7 cm"\ 1 190 cm"'). Figure 3 shows the reference 
synthetic spectrum in the region of this pair together with the differences introduced 
by varying the a priori ammonia (deep and f.s.h), phosphine (deep and f s.h.) and 



1 1 



cloud opacities by 50%. It can clearly be seen that the brightness temperatures at the 
two wavelengths (indicated by '+' symbols) vary by a similar amount for all 
parameters (including temperatures which are not shown here) except phosphine for 
which very different responses are seen. Hence by preparing brightness temperature 
maps at these two wavelengths and subtracting them, any variations observed should 
be attributable to phosphine variation alone. 

To demonstrate the validity of this technique, a set of test spectra were first 
calculated. Since we wanted a representative range of conditions for all latitudes 
between 60° S and 60°N, temperature profiles were first retrieved (with a separate 
model) from the ATMOS02A data set from 55°S to 55°N averaged into latitudinal 
bins of width 10° and step 5°, giving 23 different temperature profiles. These profiles 
were retrieved from apodised spectra (Hamming instrument function, FWHM = 2.5 
cm"^) in the range 600-700 cm'V For each of the 23 assumed temperature profiles and 
observing geometry conditions, the following atmospheric state parameters were then 
randomly varied and a number of sample synthetic spectra calculated: 

NH3 deep fraction (relative to an assumed solar value of 2.19x10"^) set to 1.0 + 
0.5x, where x is a random number between ±1 . 

NH3 fractional scale height set to 0.15 + 0.2x (limited not to go below 0.01). 

Cloud base set to 1 bar, with fractional scale height 0.5, and optical depth set 
to 0.3 + 0.5x (limited not to go below 0.0). 

PH3 deep fraction (relative to 6x10'') set to 1.0 + 0.5x. Fractional scale height 
fixed at 0.3. 

(n.b. the random number x was recalculated for each element) 



1? 



For each temperature profile, foxir random sets of the above parameters were 
generated and used to calculate 23 x 4 = 92 synthetic spectra in total. The spectral 
resolution of the forward model was set to be triangular with a full-width-half 
maximum of 2.5 cm'', found to be a convenient and sufficiently accurate 
approximation to the real instrument function. 

Using these test spectra the value of ATb = Tb(1190 cm'') - Tb(1 186.7 cm'') was 
plotted against the values of the ammonia, phosphine, cloud and temperature 
parameters used to generate the spectra. The sign of ATb was chosen to ensure that 
positive ATb values correspond to enhanced abimdances of phosphine. The results for 
the ammonia, phosphine and cloud parameters are shown in Figure 4 and a clear 
correlation with phosphine abundance is seen, while there is no correlation with any 
other parameter (including the temperatures at different altitudes which are not shown 
here). 

The same procedure was then applied to the ATMOS02A dataset and the 
brightness temperature maps at the two reference wavelengths, and difference, are 
shown in Figure 5. The zonal structure of Jupiter is clearly seen in the brightness 
temperature maps where the zones are cold and where the GRS is clearly seen at 50° 
W, 25° S. The dark near-vertical stripes axe due to missing data. In practice it was 
found that there was a small variation in the wavelength calibration of this, and the 
three other ATMOS02A maps, and thus the wavelengths were slightly adjusted to 
coincide with the either side of the 1187.5 cm"' brightness temperature peak. Figure 6 
shows the adjusted ATb signal for all four maps. The missing data swaths are clearly 
obvious in all four maps, and it can also be seen that calibration problems remain with 
the ATMOS02B set caused, it is believed, by changing instrument temperature which 
clearly affect the radiometric calibration. However in all foiir cases a clear meridional 



1 ^ 



variation of the signal is seen, together with a slight possible enhancement over the 
GRS. Figure 7 shows an average ATb map for the A, C and D ATMOS02 
observations (the B observation was neglected due to remaining calibration 
problems). These averaged data show more clearly the increased ATb values (and 
hence higher PH3 abundance) over the EZ, decreased values over the North Equatorial 
Belt (NEB) and South Equatorial Belt (SEB), and a possible local maximum over the 
GRS. In addition, there is also an indication of North/South asymmetry in phosphine 
abundance at mid-latitudes, with increased abundances seen in the northern 
hemisphere. 

5. Retrieval Model 

The radiance differencing method of the previous section provides a qualitative 
indication of the distribution of phosphine, but only uses two wavelengths and thus is 
rather sensitive to noise. To provide a better-averaged map, and also to provide a 
more quantitative analysis, a non-linear optimal estimation retrieval algorithm after 
Rodgers (1976, 2000) was applied. The scheme minimises the difference between 
measured and modelled spectra, subject to minimum departure from the a priori 
vector, by minimising the 'cost' function: 

\/ \/ \/ \/ V/ \/ I »' " •' 

(3) 
where 

y is the measured spectrum. 

\/ 

is the spectrum calculated with the forward model. 

Sj is the measurement covariance matrix, which contains both estimated 
measurement errors and forward modelling errors. 



14 



X is the model state vector. 

a is the a/7rzorz state vector. 

S^ is the a priori covariance matrix. 

The diagonal components of the a priori covariance matrix were set to the 
square of the estimated a priori errors. Off-diagonal elements were set to zero except 
for the temperature parameters, where a correlation length (in log(pressure) imits) of 
1 .5 was adopted to provide vertical smoothing (e.g. Rodgers 2000, p55). In addition to 
the constraints defined by the a priori assumptions, fiirther 'hard limits' were set to 
eliminate non-physical solutions. All the error values and limits used are listed in 
Table 2. Together with the a priori temperature error reducing with depth in the 
atmosphere to force barotropic conditioas at higher pressures, a fiorther constraint was 
placed on the temperature profile below the tropopause which was prevented from 
decreasing more rapidly with height than the dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR). 

Given these constraints, at each step in the iterative retrieval process a new 
estimate of the state vector x was estimated from optimal estimation theory to be 



\/ \/ \/ 



(4) 



where K„ is the matrix containing the rates of change of the n* calculated 
spectrum y„ with respect to all the elements in the state vector x. However, to stop the 
model becoming imstable, the actual modified state vector used, x^^j , was adjusted 
slightly using a Marquardt-Levenberg-type parameter (Press et al., 1992) X as: 

(5) 



1 S 



The parameter >^was initially set to 1.0. If the spectrum calculated from x^^j 
was found to reduce the cost function (j), then Xq was set to x^,^; , X was multiplied by a 
factor of 0.3, and the next iteration started. If however the spectrum calculated from 
x^^i was found to increase the cost function (j), then Xn was left unchanged, the 
parameter X increased by a factor of 10 and a new vector x^^j calculated. The choice 
of the multiplication parameters (0.3, 10) is somewhat arbitrary although it is 
important to ensure that they are not reciprocals of one another which can lead to 
endless loops. To ensure smooth convergence the lower number (0.3) was chosen to 
be greater than the reciprocal of the larger number so that X did not decrease too 
quickly. As the retrieval approaches its final solution, X -* and the model tends to 
the optimal estimate. 

To test the joint retrieval of tropospheric temperature, ammonia, phosphine and 
cloud (or haze) opacity, the retrieval model was apphed to the set of synthetic spectra 
discussed earher. Each spectrum was first cut to leave only the 600-700 cm"', and 
1000-1200 cm"' ranges. The noise on these synthetic spectra was set to the estimated 
Noise Equivalent Spectral Radiance (NESR) of the spectra, reduced by factors 
appropriate for the number of spectra averaged into the 10°-wide latitude bins. 
Forward modelling errors were also added at this stage to account for possible 
systematic errors in the forward model. The retrieval model was then run on each case 
for a maximum of 10 iterations or until the minimisation fimction ^ had converged to 
within 0.5%. 

The results of this retrieval run for the composition and cloud parameters are 
shown in Figure 8. This figure shows the correlation between the true and retrieved 
values of ammonia (deep fraction and f s.h.), deep phosphine fraction and cloud (or 
haze) opacity for all 92 cases. The a priori values are indicated by the dashed lines 



If; 



and the a priori errors by the dotted lines. The fitted values are indicated by + signs, 
with the vertical extent set to the estimated retrieval error of the model calculated 
fi-om: 



(6) 

It can be seen that in most cases, the retrieved parameters fit the 'true' 
parameters to within the 1-a retrieval error calculated fi-om Eq. 6, validating the 
correct behaviour of the retrieval model. The peculiar appearance of the anunonia 
fractional scale height plot at high f.s.h. values arises from some of the random 
combinations of the two ammonia parameters leading to saturation of ammonia at 
higher levels in the synthetic profiles. Since the volimie mixing ratio (v.m.r.) of 
ammonia is limited not to go above the saturated v.m.r. this means that in these cases 
the ammonia profiles used to generate the synthetic spectra have lower ammonia 
concentrations at pressures below 700 mb than prescribed by the ammonia parameter 
combinations alone. Hence the ammonia v.m.r. profile used to generate these 
synthetic spectra is actually better approximated by a different combination of the two 
ammonia parameters, with a lower fractional scale height, which the retrieval model 
correctly deduces. 

6. Global retrievals. 

The spectra in the ATMOS02A map were analysed using this retrieval model between 
600 and 700 cm'' and 1000-1200 cm"' to retrieve jointly the temperature profile, the 
deep phosphine abundance, the deep ammonia abundance and fractional scale height, 
and the total cloud (or haze) opacity. The fractional scale height of phosphine was 
fixed at 0.3 as described earlier. The spectra were averaged into bins of width 6° in 
both latitude and longitude and stepped every 3° in longitude between and 360° W 



17 



and between 60° S and 60° N to achieve Nyquist sampling. The error on these average 
spectra was then calculated including the averaged NESR, sample variation, and a 
very conservative estimate of the forward modelling error of 10%. The temperature 
retrievals were found to be in good agreement with the temperature retrievals of 
previous CIRS analyses (Flasar et al, 2003). Similarly the ammonia fractional scale 
height (f s.h.) retrievals are consistent with those of Fouchet et al. (2003), who 
considered a slightly different wavenumber range (900 - 940 cm'^). For the deep 
ammonia retrievals however, the variation across the planet was found to be 
insignificant compared to the retrieval error and thus nothing could be inferred. 
Similarly, the results of the cloud (or haze) opacity retrievals were found to depend 
strongly on the a priori assumptions. An atmosphere with a cloud of uniform 
absorption cross-section generates a thermal emission spectrum which is virtually 
indistinguishable over small wavelength ranges from a cloud-free atmosphere with a 
suitably adjusted temperature profile. Hence the only way that both the temperature 
profile and cloud opacity can be independently retrieved is by making assumptions on 
the vertical profile of the cloud, and placing suitable consfraints on the T-profile (e.g. 
Conrath and Gierasch, 1986). Hence in this case, these variables may be thought of 
simply as free parameters, used to minimise the difference between the synthetic and 
measured spectra, in regions away from phosphine absorption features. The exception 
to this is the ammonia scale height retrieval which is well constrained by these data 
and whose spatial variations are large compared to the retrieval errors. 

Figure 9 shows the global variation of the refrieved fractional scale height of 
ammonia, and the 'deep' phosphine abundance. The scale bars in Figure 9 also show 
the a priori and retrieved errors of the individual retrievals and it can be seen that the 
ammonia f s.h. is very well constrained by the data, but the phosphine abundance less 



1R 



so. The ammonia f.s.h. shows clear latitudinal variation with higher values in the EZ 
and lower values in the North Equatorial Belt (NEB) and South Equatorial Belt 
(SEB), consistent with the canonical view of upwelling of moist, volatile-rich air of 
the zones and subsidence over the belts (Stone, 1976). It is also apparent that the 
amm onia f s.h. appears depleted over the centre of the GRS which is consistent with 
previous investigations (e.g. Griffith et al. 1992) and suggests stagnation of the air at 
levels above ~500 mbar. The meridional pattern of the ammonia f s.h. distribution is 
also repeated in the deep phosphine abundance map which shows clear enhancement 
over the EZ and depletion over the SEB and NEB. However, while PH3 appears to be 
enhanced at -40° N, no clear enhancement is seen at 40° S. The cause of this 
asymmetry is unclear but was also observed in the brightness temperature difference 
maps shown earlier. An intriguing difference between the phosphine and ammonia 
maps is that while ammonia f.s.h. is depleted in the centre of the GRS the abundance 
of phosphine appears to be slightly enhanced at the northern edge. To assess the 
significance of this, the variation of the retrieved phosphine abundance, and retrieval 
errors are shown for a longitude strip (Figure 10) passing through the GRS and also a 
latitude strip (Figure 11). While the GRS signature in the single latitude strip could, 
on its own, be easily discarded as noise, the GRS signature in the longitude strip looks 
at first sight more convincing. In this longitude strip one hundred estimates of the 
phosphine abundance were made. The mean value was foimd to be 1.04 x 10" with a 
standard deviation of 1.02 x 10" . Using this error value, the two points in the GRS at 
48° and 51° W are found to be over four standard deviations away from the mean. 
Assuming Gaussian statistics, the probabiUty of finding such a point is only 6.3 x 10"^ 
and thus in a hundred samples the nimiber of such points is expected to be much less 
than one (0.0063). Hence on this basis the identification of increased phosphine 



IQ 



abundance over the GRS would appear to be statistically significant. However this 
analysis neglects the retrieval errors for which the mean value was found to be 2.3 x 
10'^. Substituting this as the standard deviation, the two GRS points are then found to 
be just below two standard deviations from the mean for which the probability is 
0.045. Hence in one hundred samples, four such points might be expected and thus the 
identification of phosphine enhancement over the GRS looks rather less secure. It 
should be remembered that a very conservative forward modelling error of 10% has 
been assumed in these retrievals to ensure smooth maps. When a smaller value of 5% 
is assumed, the retrieved phosphine map looks much noisier and the GRS signature is 
much harder to discern although the same mean latitudinal variation is seen. An 
additional factor to consider is the calibration of the CIRS dataset for which work is 
still on-going. The apparent PH3 signature over the GRS is found to be more visible in 
some versions of the calibrated data than others, and thus the results presented here 
should be considered as first indications rather than definitive final values. With the 
current state of the data set and modelling, the most the can be said at present is that 
the radiative differencing and retrieval models both show a clear latitudinal variation 
of phosphine, with North/South asymmetry, and an indication that phosphine may be 
enhanced over the northern edge of the GRS. 

7. Conclusions. 
The spatial distribution of phosphine, and also ammonia fi-actional scale height (f.s.h.) 
in Jupiter's atmosphere has been retrieved from 60°S to 60°N with high spatial 
resolution and low noise using Cassini CIRS spectra. We find that both ammonia 
f.s.h. and phosphine abundance are enhanced over the Equatorial Zone and depleted 
over the North and South Equatorial Belts in agreement with the canonical view of 



?n 



upwelling in the zones and subsidence in the belts (Stone, 1976). It should be noted 
however that the same effect may be achieved if vertical eddy mixing is more active 
over the zones and the observation does not necessarily imply bulk overturning 
motion. The behaviour at more polar latitudes is more puzzling in that while the 
latitudinal variation in ammonia f.s.h. appears symmetric, a noticeable North/South 
asymmetry in phosphine abundance is observed at mid-latitudes (-40°). The origin of 
this asymmetry is unknown although is presumably linked to the other well-known 
asymmetries in the Jovian atmosphere including the prevalence of large-scale 
anticyclonic eddies such as the GRS in the southern hemisphere. 

It has also been possible to determine the possible variation in abundance of both 
these volatiles over the GRS. Like Griffith et al. (1992) we find that upper level 
anmionia is depleted over the GRS, presumably due to a mixture of condensation and 
photodissociation. Phosphine however, so\mded at sUghtly deeper levels, appears to 
be enhanced as was noted by Lara et al. (1998), although this conclusion is right on 
the edge of owe detection limits. The apparent difference in behaviour between 
ammonia and phosphine over the GRS is at first glance rather confiising. However it 
should be remembered that the ammonia abundance is sampled at higher altitudes 
than phosphine at these wavelengths. Hence the high abundance of deep phosphine 
and the small ammonia fractional scale height are consistent with the canonical model 
of the GRS being an area of uplift at deeper levels but somewhat stagnant at upper 
levels (Flasar et al., 1981; Conrath etal, 1981) allowing of time for condensation, 
rain-out and photodissociation, thus reducing the abundance of higher altitude 
ammonia. This interpretation is also consistent with observation that the deep 
phosphine is possibly enhanced at the northern edge of the GRS, while the low 
ammonia f s.h. values are found further south. From temperature retrievals the centre 



71 



of the GRS at high altitudes is found to be considerably further south than at lower 
altitudes. Hence the high phosphine values (retrieved at deeper levels) are found to 
coincide with the centre of the GRS at deep levels while the low ammonia f.s.h. 
values (sounded at much higher altitudes) coincide with the centre at higher altitudes. 
It should be noted here that these results are dependent on spatial resolution. In order 
that we can detect phosphine we have used quite wide latitude/longitude bins in these 
retrievals to reduce noise. However such large bins may smear out localised features. 
Models retrieving ammonia only may use smaller latitude/longitude bins to achieve 
sufficient signal-to-noise ratios and such models developed at NASA/GSFC 
(Achterberg, private communication) to analyse the same ATMOS02 data find that 
while ammonia is depleted in the southern part of the GRS, as seen here, it appears 
enhanced in small areas to the north. 

Prior to the Cassini Jupiter encoimter, it was hoped that CIRS spectra might help to 
identify the chromophores in Jupiter's clouds. In particular, it had been suggested 
(e.g. Prinn and Lewis 1975) that triclinic red Phosphorus (P4), a possible product of 
phosphine photolysis, might be responsible for the colour of the GRS. However a 
number of other authors argue against this identification. West et al. (1986) found that 
both the red and white allotropes of Phosphorus are too blue-absorbing to match the 
observed redness of the GRS and instead Sulphur (Ss) allotropes seemed to do better. 
In addition Boudon et al. (1999) found that white phosphorus has a strong absorption 
feature at 466 cm"', which should also be present in red phosphorus and would be 
visible in the far-infrared CIRS spectra. However no such features have been detected. 
Finally Simon-Miller et al. (2001a) have performed a Principal Component Analysis 
of HST Jupiter observations and conclude that the anomalous redness of the GRS, 
compared to other red regions, is likely only a trace constituent whose actual identity 



?7 



remains a mystery. Laboratory spectra of sulphur and phosphorus allotropes, as well 
as higher-order hydrocarbons and other photochemical products like P2H2 are needed 
from the near-UV through the far-infrared to aid in this identification.

(1190cm'') - Tb (1186.7 cm''). Positive ATb values indicate enhancement of 
phosphine. The dark, near-vertical stripes are missing data. The ATb signal appears 
enhanced in the EZ, and depleted in the SEB and NEB. A possible enhancement at the 
northern edge of the GRS 20° S, 55° W can also just be seen.

Figure 6. Maps of ATb (proportional to phosphine enhancement) for all four of the 
ATMOS02A datasets. All four maps can be seen to have missing data but the 
latitudinal variation of the ATb signal is clear in all, as is the slight enhancement at the 
northem edge of the GRS. The banding in the ATMOS02B map is due to a calibration 
shift in this dataset which occured half-way during the observation, and which is yet 
to be corrected for.

Figure 7. Average of ATb (or phosphine enhancement) for ATMOS02 datasets A, C

latitudinal variation in ATb is clear, as is the increased signal to the northern edge of 



theGRS.

Figure 8. Validation of retrieval algorithm for set of synthetic test spectra. The four 
plots show the results for, respectively, deep NH3 solar fraction (i.e. relative to a 
v.m.r. of 2.19x10"^), NH3 fractional scale height (fs.h.), deep PH3 fraction (relative to 
the reference value of 6x 1 0'^) and cloud (or haze) opacity. The 'true' value of the 
parameter used to generate the spectrum is plotted along the x-axis, while the fitted 
value and error is plotted on the y-axis. The a priori estimates of the refrieved 
parameters are indicated by the dashed lines, and the a priori error limits by the dotted 
lines. The agreement between true and retrieved parameters is mostly very good. The 
peculiar behaviour of the ammonia fractional scale height results for true values 
greater than 0.25 is due to ammonia saturating in the model used to generate the 
synthetic spectra leading to lower than intended abundances of ammonia at higher 
altitudes.

Figure 9. Retrievals of the ammonia fractional scale height and deep phosphine 
volume mixing ratio between 60° S and 60° N for the ATMOS02A map using the 
optimal estimation retrieval model. The averaged retrieved values are indicated by the 
horizontal lines in the scale bars and the individual a priori and retrieved error ranges 
are indicated by the two vertical bars respectively for each map. Both parameters 
show similar meridional variation with increased values over the EZ and decreased 



-^-7 



values over the NEB and SEB. However at mid-latitudes, although the ammonia f.s.h. 
distribution shows no North/South asymmetry, the phosphine distribution appears to 
be enhanced in the northern hemisphere. The possible enhancement of phosphine to 
the northern edge of the GRS is also apparent, as is the reduction of the ammonia 
f s.h. over the centre of the spot.
