Archiving vast amounts of data has become a major part of every scientific space mission 
today. GRASP, the Generic Archive/ Retrieval Services Protocol, addresses the question of 
how to archive the data collected in an environment where the underlying hardware archives 
may be rapidly changing. 

GRASP is a device independent specification defining a set of functions for storing and 
retrieving data from an archive, as well as other support functions. GRASP is divided 
into two levels, the Transfer Interface, and the Action Interface. The Transfer Interface 
is computer /archive independent code while the Action interface contains code which is 
dedicated to each archive/computer addressed. 

Implementations of the GRASP specification are currently available for DECstations running 
Ultrix, Sparcstations running SunOS, and micro VAX/ VAXstation 3100s. The underlying 
archive is assumed to function as a standard Unix or VMS file system. The code, written in 
C, is a single suite of files. Preprocessing commands define the machine unique code sections 
in the device interface. The implementation was written, to the greatest extent possible, 
using only ANSI standard C functions.
