THE EFFECT ON THE SPZBB7 DIBECTIONAL OTBO IB TUBNISTa^

SUMHABT 



The' present report la concerned with an analytical traat— - 
nent of the effects of the transverse Inclination of an air- 
plane in a turn on the indication of the directional gzro, ^t 
is found that the extreme incllnaiiont^ which the airplane must 
necessarily assume for a correct turn in the approaches exe- 
cuted at high speed and small radius of curvature, renders 
the indications of the instrument worthless d^gtring such ma^- 
neuvers. 



INTBODUCTIOH 



The use of the directional gyro during che-nges of 
direction is very useful to the pilot, hecause it enables 
him to follow the turn step by step, and to resume after 
completing the turn, the new course which he Intends to follow, 
In fact, the resistance of the gyroscopic axis does not permit 
the graduated rim with which it is Integral, to execute any 
oscillations during the maneuver, as opposed to what occurs 
on the compass where the oscillations due to the Inertia of 
the magnetic equipment, as well as the errors Imputed in 
relation to the vertical component of the terrestial field, 
do not afford the pilot a safe reading of the course during 
the maneuver or immediately after it. The pilot, however, - 
can see that the directional gyro Is not even in a position 
to indicate the course accurately during the maneuvers, if 
performed with considerable transverse Inclinations. To 
illustrpte: on departing from a. 45° course he notices that 
the dial does not follow the motion of rotation of the air- 
plane at the first" Instant but a nticipates it by left— hand

turns. Impedes it "by rlght—hand turns, The relative errors 
of "t-hls- phenomenon -persist more, or- less during the direc- 
tional change, but the pilot is not able to verify them direct- 
ly; and they exceed in certain instances the maximum allowed 
to the directional gyro in normal setting, 

» 

In fact, the rule is that, 15 minutes after adjustment 
of the instrument by means of the appropriate adjusting lever, 
the errors due to the rotation of the earth, and the precision 
of the gyro in- the ^simuth due to various causes, should not 
exceed 3° to 4°; instead of that the instrument may introduce 
errors ars' high as 14^ to 15°, depending upon th^ particular 
trim of the airplane. 

Ooviously, even putting aside the normal use of the 
directional gyro on an airplane, the previously outlined 
phenomena occur in all specific cases where the reading of 
the instrument during the maneuver of turning, is required. 

So, the Instrument Section of the Guidon^ a laboratory 
made some experiments in which the instrument records 
during turning at various transverse inclinations were 
taken Into account, and It was found that, at small lit> 
cllnatlons, the experiments confirmed the results antici- 
pated, while at great inclinations the discrepancies were 
considerable. 

The behavior of the direetlonRl gyro in n turn was 
closely examined and a geometrical method developed 
parallel with 16 experiments, which confirmed the theoreti- 
cal results. 



aSOMETRICAL M3TH0D 



The functioning of the instrument is referred to a 
system of axes moving with the airplane and its setting 
to a system of axes fixed in space. 

Tlsuellze (fig. 1) a system of axes x, y, s. Integral

incident -with- the -ptlnolpal axes of inertia In such a way 
that axis x coincides with the longitudinal axis, positive

left, and axis s with the axis of yaw, positive upward, 
and a system of axes |, r|, ^ fixed In space, where t

Voraally, the directional - gyro is aounted in such a

porting frame of the spinning dlak cradle is bolted to the 
Instrument casing, and the axis iz with the diameter of the 
dial plate passing through the reference mark fcr the readings

This is not true in reality inasmuch as to^ results from 
the decomposition of a> along axis 7 and along another 

axis m (fig.. P.) defined hy the condition that a rotation

Sincot during the turn, the frontal plane rotates about ^ 
with respect to the fixed axes, the intersection m 

-of the two-planes -rotates also in the frontal plane, that 
is, with respect to the system of moving t^xes x, y, e; 
hence. If the direction of one- of the components of o) , 
in such a system changes, the value of the other component 
u^ must change also, even if its direction remains 
constant (always in the movable aysteo) (Tq* constant), 
the constancy of the resultant must be jnaintalned.

A study of '(^cTo) reveals that the error is Bero

obliciuity between 0° and 90°, when the direction of the 
airplane renges between the first and third quadrant; it 
is positive when the direction varies between the second and 
fourth quadrant. 

In a turn- .executed at constant obliquity, the error

That la to say, the maximum error, in a turn made with 
varying obliquity, shifts from the direction to= 45° 
(which has zero limit of obllauity) to ^0=90° (which

Figure 6 shows the curves of TCtoiTo) for various 
values of To* The curves coincide, at least for small 
and unavoidable differences, with those obtained experiment-

vertical axis with oblique setting. 

On the other hand, figure 7 given the error e with 
respect to the Indicated direction ii, as well es to . 
This diagram is derived from figure 6. 

The diagrams are plotted for obliquity not in excess'of 
6C for the reason that, when 6C° are exceeded, the 
system of gluibal Joints stops and the Instrument ceases to 
function regularly. 



c6Nc;.nsio?s. 



The results obtained from the foregoing geometrical 
study together with the tests in 'the laboratory afford a 



HACA TM Bo. 1091 8 

legitimate appraisal of the phenomena accompanying the 
function of the directional gyro In a tiirn. 

The errors of Indication can "be. Introduced hy the 
Instrument only to the extent that the airplane la maln^ 
talned In obllg,ue setting; the Instrument la not likely 
to furnish accurate Indications again after the airplane, 
upon completing the turn, has resumed Its normal attitude. 
As regards the use of the Instrument In an airplane, the 
prohlem therefore is reduced to an approximate appraisal 
of the Instant vhen the new course is reached. !I?o lllus^ 
trate: vhlle naTlgating with a directional gyro Indicating 
, it is desired to make a tO° right—hand turn,. 

'while the airplane has a fg = 40° obliquity, the turn is 
completed wh^n the gyro indicates (cf. fig. 6) 42°, 20' 
that is to say, 7°, 40<', within less then 50 effective 
degrees which are o'btalned. The airplane is not likely 
to resume normal attitude at the end of the turn when the 
directional gyro Indicates exactly 6fi°. Thus, if the 
pilot wants to make allowance for these phenomena in order 

.to effect a turn with a .prescri'bed angle without having to 
make successive tentative approximations, he should take 
from figure 6 the error ft a —7° 40')i which is appropriate 
for such an angle (to =50 in the model prohlem) and stop 
the turn at a value of the indication '^j. => ^^ + f nr, in 
above example, at 

£ 1 = 50°-7"40' = 42°20« 

However, as such a correction of the course is inevitable 
even "by imperfect maneuvers on the part of the pilot, the 
inconvenience will have no significant practical importance. 

The permissi'ble errors in the directional gyro are 
of th* order of magnitude of 3° to 4°. This is generally 
accepted, even in respect to the phenomena qf precession 
in the azimuth due to secondary causes. How, errors nf 
such order of magnitude may be Introduced by the Instrument 
even as a result of the alrplaue obliquity above 35*' to 30°, 
It is at ohllquity ahova 25° to 30°, therefore, that the 
indications of the instrument, during the maneuver, must be 
corrected by -the factors developed in the present study.
