A. Guide To 
ATARI LOGO Demo Disk 



SET UP 

Turn on the disk drive and insert the demo disk after the busy light goes out* Next, put an 
ATARI Logo cartridge in the computer and turn on the computer and television* 

The screen will display WELCOME TO ATARI LOGO* The ? (question mark) is the prompt 
symbol* The cursor (white square) shows where the next character you type will appear* 

Don't forget to press RETURN after each line of instructions* 

THE basics: SQUARES 

1) To begin the demo* type ST (Show Turtle) and press RETURN* Tell the turtle to move forward 
50 turtle steps and turn right 90 degrees by typing* 

7FORWARD 50 RIGHT 90* (Press RETURN ) 

IF WHAT YOU TYPED DIDN'T WORK make sure that there are spaces between words and 
numbers* that the words are spelled correctly* and that you're using capital letters* 

Ask onlookers what is needed to finish making a square* Type FORWARD 50 RIGHT 90 three 
more times* 

The turtle can also move backwards* Type* 

7BACK30 
To turn left. type. 

?LEFT 90 

For convenience, you can abbreviate FORWARD (FD), BACK (BK), RIGHT (RT), LEFT (LT)* Type* 

?FD 50 RT 130 
?BK 40 LT 90 

Experiment with these four commands* Try larger numbers and see if the results are what you 
expect. After you've played with drawing lines and turning the turtle* type*

2) The REPEAT command can draw a square with only one line of code* Use brackets C D not 
parentheses ( )♦ Type* 

7REFEAT 4 CFD 60 RT 903 

3) To draw a box* type* 

?CS 

?TO BOX 

>REPEAT 4 CFD 45 RT 903 
>END 

You've just created a procedure named BOX* You can see it by typing? 
?BOX 

4) Use BOX to build a more complex program* 

?TO FLOWER 

>REPEAT 12 CBOX RT 303 

>END 

To see the flower procedure* type* 
?CS 

7FLOWER 

This procedure draws a box and turns right thirty degrees twelve times* 
HELPFUL HINTS 

ATARI Logo has three screen formats ♦♦♦ text only* graphics only* or split screen (mostly 
graphics with text at the bottom of the screen)* 

To change formats* press the CONTROL key (sometimes labeled CTRL ) and 
T for Text Screen, 
F for Full Screen, or 
S for Split Screen* 

LOGO DEMO 

ERALL ERases ALL the Logo procedures in computer memory, but doesn't affect the procedures 
on disk* : : 'K' |§^S 

5) To begin the demo, (using a colon not a semicolon after M D), type! 

7ERALL •>:>:'• 'wBBI^'-' 
7LOAD "DJLOGODEMO 



As each procedure is brought into memory from the demo disk, its name will appear on the 
screen telling it has been defined* Most of the procedures printed on your screen are parts of 
larger procedures* 



VARIABLES AND RECURSION 



6) For multipurpose procedures* use a iplace holder which allows a variable in place of a 
number* 

?CT 

?PO "SQUARE (PO stands for Print Out) 

In The procedure (SQUARE JSIDE), "SIDE" can be any number for the size of the side. Using a 
variable means you don't have to write a new procedure to make different sizes of squares* 
Typet 

?CS 

7SQUARE 50 
7SQUARE 100 

Try other numbers with SQUARE* Move the turtle BACK (BK), RIGHT (RT)* LEFT (LT)* and 
FORWARD (FD) and try different placements of varied sized squares* 



7) In the next procedure* BURST is "recursive" because it calls itself within the procedure* 
Typet 

?CS 

7BURST 5 

Type Q and press RETURN * Print out the program by typing: 
?CT 

?PO "BURST 

Hold down CONTROL and press T to see all of the procedure* Notice the line near the end of 
the program** BURST JSIZE + 20* 

BURST 5 draws a square with sides 5 turtle steps long* The procedure repositions the turtle* 
and calls BURST again to draw another square of the requested size plus 20* Hold down 
CONTROL and press S to return to the split screen* 

"Recursion" enables the computer to perform complex tasks without complex programming* 



8) Type: 

?CS 
?DI2ZY 

As with BOX* BURST can be used to produce elaborate designs* The DIZZY program runs 
BURST* repositions the turtle, changes pen color* and uses BURST again*

STARTING OVER 



The following procedures utilize Logo's advanced capabilities* 

If you can't clear the screen by typing CS* type Q (for Quit) and press RETURN * "Q" is a 
procedure* written for the demo disk, that clears the screen and returns all the turtles to their 
original shapes* positions and colors* 

If typing Q doesn't work* press SYSTEM RESET or turn off the computer and then turn it on 
again* (Don't turn the disk drive off*) CAUTION* Both methods erase all your work in memory* 
You must reload the demo to continue after pressing SYSTEM RESET or turning off the 
computer*) 

If you run out of memory using this demo* type ERALL and press RETURN * 



MULTIPLE TURTLES AND COLORS 



9) Type* 

7TURTLE 

This procedure illustrates two of the dynamics of Atari's dynamic turtles! shape and color* 
The turtle flashes 13 of Atari's 123 colors* Most Logo versions have only 5 or 16 colors* 

Atari's shape editor can handle an unlimited number of shapes in groups of 15* Most Logo 
implementations limit the number of shapes* and some don't even have a shape editor* 

The Turtles 



Logo has four turtles numbered 0* 1* 2* and 3* When you first turned on Logo and typed ST* you 
were "talking" to turtle 0* 

10) BRSTFOUR shows all four turtles drawing in three different colors* The background 
cycles through 26 of the 123 colors* The procedure ends automatically* Type* 

?CS 

7BRSTFOUR 



TURTLES IN MOTION! SETSPEED 



11) This procedure makes four turtles move at different speeds* They draw dotted or solid 
lines depending on their speed* 

Turtle shapes can also be changed* and sound effects added* At the end of the procedure* the 
two faster turtles change into race cars revving their motors* Type* 

?CS 

7FOURLINE 



-4- 



FOURLINE incorporates direction changes* turtle color and background color changes* 



Unlike sprites (which other Logos use for continuous motion)* commands can be given to the 
turtles while they are moving* Turtle 0 is white* 1 is golden* 2 is pink, and 3 is blue* Type! 

?CS 

7ALLMOVE 

Press CONTROL and S far split screen* You can now give the turtles individual or joint 
commands* SETSP (SET SPeed) goes from -199 to -1 backwards and 0 to 199 forwards* Type! 

7TELL 0 LT 30 SETSP 199 
7TELL 1 RT 50 SETSP -20 
7TELL C2 33 SETSP 0 

CS will clear the screen of turtle tracks and put the turtle you were last talking to back in the 
center of the screen* Experiment using direction and speed changes with the four turtles* 
When you want to stop, type* 

?Q (Press RETURN) 



COLLISION DEMONS 



12) This program demonstrates Atari's unique collision detection capabilities* Turn up the 
volume and typet 

?CS 

7BOING 

Whenever turtle #2 (the pink turtle) collides with a red line, the turtle changes direction and a 
low sound is played* 

Whenever turtle #3 (the blue turtle) collides with a yellow line* the turtle changes direction 
and a high sound is played* ATARI Logo is the only version of Logo to have collision 
detection* This feature makes programming video games easier because it's unnecessary to 
continuously check for collisions* 

TO STOP ♦♦♦ press BREAK * type Q and press RETURN * 

SOUND 



13) To hear the range of sounds ATARI Logo can play* typei 
7SOUND 14 

SOUND can be started at any frequency - 14 Hertz (cycles per second) and above - and builds in 
increments of 14 to above audible. The frequency is printed on the screen. This procedure uses 
only one voice of the two voices in ATARI Logo. 



TO STOP .** press BREAK . 



14) Type: 



7MARYLAMB 

This plays a simple melody using both voices* Few versions of Logo have sound unless you buy 
additional equipment* 



animation: the shape editor 



15) The shape editor can be used to create animation* The eyes and mouth are turtles with 
changed shapes* The eyes open, half shut and closed} the mouth changes from no smile* to half 
smile* to full smile* The turtle colors were changed so the eyes are blue and the mouth is pink* 
The face automatically clears off the screen* Type: 

7FACE 

16) To see how this procedure is put together, type BLINK* The two eyes appear and go 
through their open/shut routine* Now type WINK (wait for someone cute to walk by)* Type 
MOUTH* if you're happy* type SMILE* Type MOUTH again if you want a grouch* Finally* type 
HEADNOSE to complete the face* 

Type Q to clear the screen and return the turtles to their original shapes and colors* 

17) This procedure has the turtles transformed into a noisy truck* then into busy workmen and 
finally into joyful Jack and Jill bouncing down the hill from her house* (RECYCLE reorganizes 
the computer's memory and gives you more working space* This is sometimes called garbage 
collection*) Type? 

7ERALL 
7RECYCLE 

7LOAD "DiJACKJILL (JACKJILL is one word with no spaces)

MOF.E LOGO* 



Since these procedures require a lot of space in the computer's memory, type ERALL before 
starting this part of the demo. Type' 

7ERALL 

7LOAD "D5MENU 
?MENU 

Choose an item from the list on the screen such as SENTENCES (letter A). 
?A 

This procedure constructs sentences from words chosen at random from lists of nouns* verbs 
and adjectives* This shows Logo's capacity to teach more than mathematical concepts and 
illustrates one element of ATARI Logo's list processing capabilities* 

Other programs in the list (menu) include* 
Graphics? 

Great Pyramids (C) — Three turtles draw a pyramid* 

Triangles #1 (E) — One turtle draws a star-like pattern* separate sections of the design 
change colors* 

Triangles #2 (G) — One turtle draws a cornucopia shape* colors spiral through it* 
Games*
