TWO-DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM FLUTTER SOLUTION FOR A PERSONAL COMPUTER 


David L. Turnock 


SUMMARY 

A computer program has been written for a personal computer which can be 
used to make two-degree-of-freedom (bending and torsion) flutter calculations 
by utilizing two-dimensional Theodorsen aerodynamics. The proqram may be used 
to approximately account for Mach number (compressibility) effects and aspect 
ratio (finite span) effects. This report contains the equations of motion, a 
program listing, user instructions, and test cases. 


INTRODUCTION 

Flutter is a self-excited dynamic oscillation produced by a coupling of 
inertial and elastic forces with aerodynamic forces resulting from elastic 
deformations of an aircraft wing. These oscillations could result in 
significant structural damaoe. Consequently, flutter must be taken into 
account during aircraft design; that is, the wing must be designed so that it 
will not flutter within the operating envelope of the airplane. 

The types of vibrations that an airplane wing could experience in flight 
are illustrated in Figure 1. 

If the wing is disturbed at flight conditions below the flutter boundary, 
the ensuing motion is a damped sinusoidal decay inq oscillation as shown in 
Figure la. This is a stable condition. At the flutter boundary, any 
disturbance will cause the wing to oscillate at a constant amplitude as shown 
in Figure lb. This is a neutrally stable condition. At conditions above the 
flutter boundary, a disturbance will produce a divergent oscillation as shown 
in Figure lc. This is an unstable condition. 

The purpose of this paper is to describe a computer program written for a 
personal, or home, computer that can be used to analyze aircraft wings for 
two-degree-of-freedom (bending and torsion) flutter. The equations of 
Theodorsen and Garrick (references 1 and 2) are implemented in this program. 
The analysis is a two-dimensional, two-dearee-of-freedom, representative- 
section method. Although this method is not new, it is sufficiently accurate 
for many present day aDplications. 

The method employed is adequate for moderate-to-hioh aspect ratio wings 
and unswept or slightly swept wings. However, the analysis has certain 
limitations. The aerodynamics are only applicable at subsonic velocities. 
The analysis as implemented in the computer program does not include the 
effects of concentrated masses such as wing mounted engines and fuel tanks. 
It also does not include the effects of aerodynamic control surfaces such as 
ailerons. These limitations are very important to note. Furthermore, the 
analysis used by the program is only an approximation. Therefore, the results 
should only be used as a guide, not as the final authority to determine 
whether or not a new or old wing design is safe from flutter. 



This report presents documentation of the computer program. Also 
presented are the derivation of the equations, user instructions, program 
listinq, and test cases which serve as illustrative examples.

EQUATIONS OF MOTION 

The flutter analysis used in this proqram is a two-dimensional, two- 
degree-of-freedom, representative-section method. The term "two-dimensional" 
applies to the aerodynamics that are utilized in the program. A two- 
dimensional wing has a constant lift and moment alonq the span. "Two- 
degree-of-freedom" means that the wing is free to deform or vibrate in two 
different motions. In this case, the motions are bending and torsion. 
Bending, or plunge, is the spanwise bending of the wing about the root. 
Torsion, or pitch, is the chordwise twisting of the wing about the rotation 
point or elastic axis of a beam-like wing. These motions are assumed to be 
simple harmonic or sinusoidal. "Representative section" means the winq 

characteristics can be represented by the properties and motions of a unit 
section of the wing. This section is chosen to be located at the 
three-auarter span station. The elasticity of the wing can be represented as 
two springs as shown attached to the wing section in Fiqure 2. If the wing is 
given a displacement, the wing will oscillate in simple harmonic motion 
(sinusoidal oscillations) at frequencies associated with the two degrees of 
freedom. Flutter occurs when these two modes of motion become coupled and 
extract energy from the airstream to produce a self-excited oscillation. 

The governing differential equations for a two degree-of-freedom flutter 
problem are derived in reference 3 and repeated here as equations 1 and 2.

These generalized forces are functions of the bending deflection h and 
the torsional twist a. These forces are defined explicitly in reference 3 
and repeated here as equations 3 and 4.

Theodorsen assumed several things in the derivation of the aerodynamics. The 
major assumption was that the wing is two-dimensional. From this assumption 
follows the assumption of infinite span. To further simplify the 
aerodynamics, incompressible flow was assumed. However, both finite-span and 


4 



compressible-flow corrections can be included to determine their effect on the 
flutter characteristics. These corrections are defined in the following text. 


The assumption of an infinite span is that no wing tip exists and the 
lift distribution is constant along the span of the wing. The lift curve 
slope of a two-dimensional wing is actually greater than the lift curve slope 
for a finite aspect ratio wing at the three auarter span location. For this 
reason the infinite aspect ratio assumption causes conservative results. 
However, for finite-span analysis, the equation for estimating the average 
lift curve slope is derived in reference 5 as

If the aspect ratio is assumed to he infinity as Theodorsen did, the 
corrected Cl q is equal to Cl^.

Furthermore, a reduced lift means a reduced moment. Because the moment 
Is equal to the lift multiplied by a distance, the moment is adjusted by the 
relationship

where the value M^ is the original value calculated by the Theodorsen 
aerodynamics. 


The assumption of incompressible flow means that the effects of Mach 
number are not considered in the calculations. The correction factor for 
compressible flow, which can be used below a Mach number of 0.8, is derived in 
Reference 6 as 


0 =

All Theodorsen aerodynamics are multiplied by this correction factor. 


FLUTTER DETERMINANT 

The solution of the flutter equations is described in this section. 

After the aerodynamic forces in equations 3 and 4 are substituted into 
equations 1 and 2 and simple harmonic motion is assumed, the two simultaneous 
equations that must be solved are given by

Several methods exist for solving the system of equations 15 and 16. A 
popular method, and the one used here, is from Theodorsen and Garrick 
(references 1 and 2). An artificial damping g and complex frequency 8 are 
introduced where 

8 = (u a /») 2 (l+1g) (21) 

This term is introduced into equations 15 and 16 and the A" and F expressions 
become 


A = y[l-(w h /w a ) 2 (l+ig h )n]+l h 


( 22 ) 


E = yr 2 [l-n(l+ig a )] - l/2(l/2+a) + M o - L o (l/2+a) + L h (l/2+a) 2 (23) 


The B and F expressions remain unchanged. 

For a non-trivial solution to exist, the determinant of the coefficients must 
vanish. That is. 


IT - B C = 0 (24) 

Equation 24 is quadratic in 8. The flutter solution occurs when 8 is 
real that is, when the artificial damping vanishes. Because the aerodynamic 
forces are parametric in reduced frequency k, equation 24 must be solved 
repeatedly to find the flutter solution. The individual solutions are usually 
plotted as shown in Figure 3 and the flutter velocity and frequency are 
obtained from the qraph. The flutter velocity is defined as the velocity 
where the damping value is zero. The flutter frequency is the corresponding 
frequency at that velocity. 


7 



Individual values are found each time equation 24 is solved for a value 


of reduced frequency. These values of velocity and frequency are obtained 
from the two resulting complex solutions by using equations 25 through 30.

Equations 5 through 8, 12 through 14, and 22 through 30 were used as 
shown in the text in the "computerized" flutter solution. Equations 10 and 17 
through 20 were used in a slightly different form due to the use of complex 
mathematics. A complete listing of the program source code is found in 
Appendix A. 


USER INSTRUCTIONS 

Of course, any computer program is useless without the knowledge of how 
to use it. This section explains the input parameters needed by the program, 
discusses how to obtain specific numerical values, and describes various input 
options. A description of the output is also included. 

Input of Structural Properties 


Structural values may be difficult to obtain in the form required by the 
program. However, reference 7 and the following guidelines should help 
determine the values of certain parameters needed for input to the computer 
program. 

Mass per unit length of span, m . This is mass in slugs (1 slug = 32.2 lbs) of 
a one foot section of the wing. Assuming an untapered straight wing with 
constant mass properties throughout the value can be derived as 


mass of wing (slugs) 
s (ft)' - 


8 



If the wing is tapered, swept, or has non-constant mass properties, the mass 
is determined for a one-foot-wide representative section centered about the 
three-quarter semi-span. Assuming a linear distribution of mass, the mass 
value is given by 


•_ mass of wing (sluqs) 
m - Z s T F t) " 

Center of gravity location . This is the location in percent chord of the 
point at which the wing balances on a knife edge as seen in Figure 4. 


CG% = (x CG /c)xlOO 


Vling moment of inertia about rotation point, I„ . This is the pitch inertia 
o? a one-foot representative section o7 the wing measured in slua-ft 2 . 
Experimental measurement may be done with a bi filar pendulum, (see reference 
7, pp. 30-31.) 

Elastic axis location . This is defined as the point about which the wing 
twists as illustrated in Figure 5. 


EA% = (xea/c) x 100 


Semi chord length, b . This is one half the chord length of the representative 
section. 

Natural bendinq and torsion frequencies f. ,f . These are fundamental 
h a 

frequencies in Hertz of the wing in bending and torsion. These are functions 
of mass, inertia, and stiffness. (See reference 7, pp. 31-33.) 

Structural damping - bending and torsion, gh,g a * This is defined as any 
internal damping of the structure. Values of .Oi to .03 are typical, however, 
for a solution that is conservative, a value of zero may be used. 

Aspect ratio, AR . This is the ratio of span to chord defined as 

AR = s 2 /A 


For straight, untapered wings, this reduces to 

AR = s/c 

For a fully two-dimensional analysis, an infinite aspect ratio should be 
used. Infinity however, cannot be input to a computer because of numerical 
difficulties. Therefore, a very large (but finite) value must be used. As 
very few wings have an aspect ratio greater than twenty, a value that is 
significantly greater than this (100,000,000 for instance) is recommended. 


9 



In making calculations to determine if a wing is free from flutter, it is 
prudent to assume that the aspect ratio is infinite because this assumption 
tends to cause conservative results. 

Input for Graphic Output 


The graphic input determines the plot resolution on the screen. A large 
scale may be needed for some solutions. However, that scale may be far too 
large for others. A typical plot appears in Figure 6. Guidelines for these 
input values follow: 

Maximum frequency to be plotted . This is usually the nearest multiple of five 
above the torsion frequency. 

Maximum velocity to be plotted . This should be about twice the expected 
flutter speed. 

Maximum G-value . This is the maximum value of artificial damping that is 
plotted. A value of .05 is sufficient for most cases. 

The above input will create two plots, frequency versus velocity and damping 
versus velocity. A typical plot has points off of the page. However, this is 
only undesirable if the flutter solution crossing point is off of the page. 

Intermediate Values Option 


As has been previously described, a flutter solution consists of solving 
the equations at many different reduced frequency values. Two values of 
velocity, coupled frequency and damping are obtained each time the equations 
are solved. If intermediate values are to be printed, then every value will 
be printed. Appendix B illustrates a solution with all values being printed. 

Air Density Option 


The air density that the wing flies at is very important to the flutter 
characteristics. A wina may flutter at one velocity and altitude yet be very 
stable at the same velocity and a higher altitude. Therefore, air density 
must be input to the problem also. Two options exist within the program for 
this purpose. 

Option 1 - One value for air density is input. This corresponds to flying the 
wing at one altitude. 

Option 2 - Several values for air density. The computer will calculate a 
solution at each air density or altitude. 

If option 2 is selected, then the following values must also be input: 

Number of values - This is the number of times the program must calculate a 
flutter solution using a different value of air density each time. 

Interval between values - This is the increment to be added to the previous 
density value for the next calculation. 


10 


First Value - This is the starting value for the computer to calculate. 


Example. Three values with an interval of .001 and a starting value of .001 
are as follows: .001, .002, and .003. 

Mach Number Option 


If compressibility effects are desired, a Mach number must be input. The 
input number must be less than one. If no compressibility effects are 
desired, a Mach number of zero should be used. 

Program Output 


The following information is output by the program: 

Structural parameters . The structural input parameters are printed so that 
the parameters can be saved and known for the flutter solution. 

Graphic input parameters . The graphic input parameters are printed in order 
to be able to determine the plot size. 

Preliminary values. These values are printed in order to know the Mach Number 
and air density. These values appear before each solution. 

Intermediate values . These are printed only if the intermediate values option 
is "turned on." The values that are printed are the reduced freguency k and 
the corresponding values of wing frequency, velocities, and damping. These 
intermediate values are used to form data points which are then plotted. 

Flutter values . The flutter values are printed along with an appropriate 
message. Because there are two sets of values (one for bending and one for 
torsion), the flutter conditions (frequency, velocity) are the numbers with 
the corresponding damping or g-value that is close to zero. 

The plots . The intermediate points of frequency and damping are plotted 
versus velocity. The points labeled "1" in Figure 3 are one set of 
intermediate points. As was stated before, two solutions existed for each 
reduced frequency. The points labeled "2" are the solutions of the 
determinant for a second value of reduced frequency. 

The damping curves indicate that one mode will cross the axis. The point 
of crossing is the corresponding velocity at which the wing will flutter. The 
other mode will generally become very stable as airspeed increases. 

Matched Point Solution 

Because the air density is an important factor in flutter calculations, 
an aircraft may flutter near sea level yet be perfectly safe at the same 
velocity when flying at ten thousand feet. Due to this fact, a flutter 
boundary is sometimes defined as Mach number M versus dynamic pressure q. 

A matched point is defined as the density condition where the flutter velocity 
is the same velocity determined from the product of the Mach number and the 
speed of sound V a . To find a matched point solution, multiple air densities 
are used in flutter solutions at the same Mach number. The velocities are 


11 



plotted against air density and a curve is faired through the points. Each 
value of air density corresponds to a particular altitude in the standard 
atmosphere for which the speed of sound also has a particular value. For the 
given Mach number a curve of velocity versus density is aenerated for the 
standard atmosphere. The point at which the two curves cross is the matched 
point. The corresponding velocity and air density are used to calculate 
dynamic pressure. When plotted as dynamic pressure against Mach number, a 
flutter boundary is defined. A complete matched point solution is oiven in 
Appendix C. 

CONCLUDING REMARKS 

A personal computer flutter solution has been written that employs 
modified two-dimensional Theodorsen aerodynamics for two degree-of-freedom 
lifting surfaces. The solution is only adequate for unswept or slightly swept 
wings with no concentrated masses located on the lifting surface. The 
aerodynamics utilized are only adequate for subsonic velocities. Control 
surface flutter is not addressed by the program. These limitations are 
further stressed by noting that the program is only to be used as a guide and 
not the final authority for determining if a wing is free from flutter.

APPENDIX A 


Copy of Computer Program Listing 

The flutter solution was programmed on an Apple IIE computer. Printed and 
plotted solutions were obtained with an Epson printer with Graftrax Interfaced 
by a Microbuffer II interface.* The computer was configured with 64K of 
internal memory and the program used less than 40K. This program was written 
in Applesoft BASIC. Obviously, the program will not run on other small 
computers unless it is modified to account for differences in other 
manufacturers BASIC codes. However, the conversion of the code should be 
relatively straightforward in most instances. 

The listing of the program begins on the next page.

APPENDIX B 


Sample Flutter Problem for Computer Program 

Due to the fact that errors can occur in entering the program in the 
computer, a sample case is given which can be used to determine if the program 
is working correctly. The sample problem appears in reference 4 pp. 219-224. 
The listed values for input are, 

u = 76 
a = -0.15 
x a = .25 

r 2 = .388 
a 

b = 5 inches 
aj a = 64.1 radians/sec 
= 55.9 radians/sec 
9h = 9ct = 0 


As most of these parameters are not in the units required as input for the 
program, the units are converted as follows: 


b = .4167 ft 

fy, = oj^/2ti = 8.9 Hz 

f 0 = co„/2ir = 10.2 Hz 

EA% = (1/2 + a/2)xl00 = 42.5% 

CG% = EA% + (x a /2 x 100) = 55% 


Assuming sea level air density 


p = .00237 slugs/ft3 
m = inrpb^ = .098 slugs/ft-span 


Therefore, 


I = r 2 mb 2 = .0066 slug-ft 2 /ft-span 

Furthermore, incompressible flow and infinite span are assumed. Therefore, 


M = 0 

AR = 100,000,000 (Essentially infinite) 

The input parameters appear in Table I. 

The full solution including the intermediate values is presented herein 
beginning on page 24. The solution is also plotted in Figure 6. The flutter 
solution is found by tracking one root of the quadratic to the crossing of the 
axis. The two successive k-values which have damping values on opposite sides 
of the axis are then averaged to determine the next k-value to be used. The 
solution process continues until the velocity difference for two successive 


22 



k-values is less than one foot per second. In other words, after first 
calculating that the flutter solution is between k-values of 0.3 and 0.2, the 
program then iterates to find that the flutter solution Is at a k-value of 
0.28125, The flutter velocity Is 89.3 ft/sec. The difference of this soluiton 
from the one found in reference 4 Is less than one percent. The reason for 
this difference may he due to the aerodynamic approximation of the program. 
The aerodynamics utilized by reference 4 are the actual values calculated from 
the Bessel functions whereas the algorithm used in the program is an 
approximation of these functions. 

It is also Interesting to note that the calculations at k-values of 0.01 
and 0.001 indicate a second Instability at about 173 ft/sec where both the 
frequency and damping of one of the modes goes to zero. This Is the static 
divergence speed. The divergence phenomena is discussed In textbooks such as 
references 3, 4, and 6,

APPENDIX C 


A matched point solution is presented in this section. The solution is 
calculated for four different Mach numbers and the solution Is presented In 
terms of dynamic pressure, altitude and equivalent airspeed. 

The wing to be analyzed is taken from reference 3, page 203. An aspect 
ratio of eight was assumed. The Input appears in table II. Air density 
option two was chosen and calculations were made for six value of air 
density. The interval between values was 0.0004 and the starting value was 
0.0004. The speed of sound at each air density was obtained from a standard 
atmosphere chart and then multiplied by the appropriate Mach number to obtain 
the corresponding velocity. 

The results for each Mach number are in Table III* 

Results at M = .4 . When the flutter velocity is plotted versus air density as 
shown in Figure 7, it is seen that the aircraft does not flutter at M = .4 at 
any altitude above sea level. Therefore, at M = .4 the aircraft is safe from 
flutter. 

Results at M = .5 . The velocity is plotted versus air density in Figure 8 the 
curve intersects the Mach 0.5 curve at an air density value of .0021 
slugs/ft 3 and a velocity of 550 ft/sec. 

Therefore, 

q = l/2pV 2 = 317.6 lb/ft 2 


The altitude H, In feet, can be calculated for altitudes less than about 
40,000 feet using the following equation which was derived from equations 
obtained from reference 5. 


H = 14S45O.[l-{- TJ0 § 37 .) 


.23496, 


Thus for p = .0021 the altitude is H = 4075 ft. 
The equivalent airspeed is: 


V e * V-3TO23T = 517 - 7 ft/sec 


Therefore, the aircraft is safe from flutter at M = .5 for altitudes greater 
than 4075 ft. If the plane was at 4075 ft., the aircraft would flutter when 
the equivalent airspeed is 517 ft/sec. For a more detailed description of the 
relevance of equivalent airspeed see reference 8. 


29 



Results at M = .6 


Using the above procedure, a matched point is found by using Figure 9. The 
plot indicates the curves crossing at an air density of 0.0014 slugs/ft 3 and 
a velocity of 630 ft/sec. The flutter conditions are therefore: 


q = 277.8 lb/ft2 
H = 16922 ft 
V e = 484.2 ft/sec 


Results at M = .8 

Using Figure 10, the matched point occurs at 

p = .00065 slugs/ft 3 
V = 780 ft/sec 


Therefore, 


q = 197.8 lbs/ft 2 
H = 38124 ft 
V e = 408.5 ft/sec 


When plotted as dynamic pressure versus Mach number as shown in Figure 11, the 
flutter boundary is described. However, when plotted as equivalent airspeed 
versus Mach number as in Figure 12, the flutter boundary takes on added 
meaning when the altitude lines are drawn. This plot makes it easy to 
visualize where the aircraft is safe in terms of altitude and equivalent air 
speed. The abbreviation "K" means thousand and is utilized in terms of feet 
( i . e. , 10K means 10,000 feet altitude).

16. Abstract 


A computer programmed flutter solution has been written in the BASIC language 
for a personal computer. The program is for two degree-of- freedom bending- 
torsion flutter applications and utilizes two dimensional Theodorsen aero- 
dynamics. The aerodynamics have been modified to include approximations for 
Mach number (compressibility) effects and aspect ratio (finite span) effects. 
The report contains a description of the program including input options, 
user instructions, program listing, and a test case application.
