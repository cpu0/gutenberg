develop an integrated common user, organizational and individual 
messaging and directory services system. The primary objective 
of DMS is to reduce costs and staffing by eliminating the 
resource intensive and archaic Automatic Digital Network 
(AUTODIN) system. A secondary objective is to improve support to 
the warfighers by implementing advanced messaging and directory 
service, building on commercial products and incorporating 
international standards. 

Other C^ Support includes resources for programs below the 
reporting threshold for major or non-major programs such as 
operation and maintenance of the Joint Interoperability 
Evaluation System (JIES), the internal DISA Information System 
(DISA-IS), automation and telecommunications supporting the 
President, Vice President, White House staff and National 
Security Council, and other information resource management 
functions required to support DISA operations.

The Ada Dual-Use Program is targeted toward revitalizing Ada and 
encouraging its use throughout DoD, government/ industry/ and 
academia. The program manages the launch of Ada 9X which 
involves efforts in standardization/ compilers/ validation/ 
bindings/ tools/ transition support/ and the increased commercial 
use of Ada through an aggressive dual-use program. 

The I-CASE program management office was created to establish a 
standard software engineering environment that supports a formal/ 
repeatable software development process throughout the entire 
software development life cycle. 

Software Systems Engineering targets the DoD software development 
community/ and provides support to organizations in implementing 
improved methods/ toolS/ and procedures at local sites. 
Implementing software engineering improvements in the areas of 
software reuse/ object oriented design/ domain engineering/ re¬ 
engineering/ software engineering environments/ and metrics will 
enhance the DoD software system life-cycle management 
capabilities/ and posture the DoD workforce for increased 
productivity and quality of information systems. 

The Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) mission is to 
execute and manage a unified/ fully integrated information 
systems security program and information warfare functions within 
the DOD Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) systems; and 
plan and coordinate DoD Multi-level Security (MLS) projects and 
initiatives/ support fielding and implementation of MLS 
capabilities and technology at high priority commands. 

The Enterprise Integration (El) initiative is the major effort to 
facilitate the migration of DoD information systems to an open 
system environment. The El initiative supports the decision 
making and planning for and prototyping of migration systems. By 
doing so, it also supports the consolidation and modernization 
the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) as part of the 
National Information Infrastructure (Nil).

The "Other" category captures costs for programs and initiatives 
below the reporting threshold for major or non-major programs. 
This includes DoD-wide data administration, DoD-wide information 
technology standards, information engineering, information 
technology asset management and knowledge base, process 
management and measurement, DoD software initiatives, open 
systems environment testing, opens sytems standards for 
information processing and DII efficiency. 

Information Management CIM Functional Area- DBOF 

The Defense Business Operations Fund-Communications Information 
Services Activity (DBOF-CISA) revolving fund provides 
telecommunications and information products/services from 
worldwide commercial carriers for DoD customers and other 
authorized users. Through it's administrative arm. Defense 
Information Technology Office (DITCO, formerly DITPRO), the 
revolving fund provides a single source for high quality, 
reliable, survivable and secure telecommunications services for 
command and control; provides a single source for the procurement 
of cost-effective and commercially competitive information 
technology voice, data and video telecommunications services to 
obtain economies of scale through bulk quantity purchasing at the 
lowest possible price; and, for assistance in defining, 
engineering and procuring necessary telecommunications support to 
meet customer requirements. 

The resources reported in this area also support the Defense 
Megacenters and Defense Information Processing Centers owned by 
DISA. There are no.Automated Information Systems owned by DISA 
funded by the Information Services (Information Processing) Busi¬ 
ness Area of the DBOF. Therefore, all of estimates are reflected 
in the "Other" major cost category. 

The total estimated costs of DBOF operations (excluding 
depreciation) in this budget are:

plan, approved by the 1993 Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) 
Commission, calls for the consolidation of work load from 59 
information processing facilities to 16 Defense Megacenters. 

Finance CIM Functional Area 


Funds in the Finance functional area supports the Plans and 
Program Analysis Support Center (PPASC). The PPASC is a Defense 
Support Activity (DSA) housed in, and administratively supported 
by, DISA. The PPASC supports the Office of the Secretary of 
Defense (OSD). The program provides, operates, maintains, and 
enhances the computer and data communications systems necessary 
for the PPASC to perform its mission. The PPASC program contains 
the resources required to support the users who provide technical 
and analytical support to OSD. The program includes desktop and 
midrange computer systems, data communications systems, and use 
of DISA's mainframe computer systems. The program provides a mix 
of computer systems which are capable of performing quantitative 
analysis such as simulations, modeling, and databases, as well as 
office automation (OA) functions such as word processing, 
spreadsheets, e-mail, and business graphics. In addition to OA 
desktop computers, and because of the requirement to perform 
complex quantitative analyses, the PPASC is equipped with

powerful desktop and midrange RISC/Unix systems with database, 
simulation, modeling, and mathematical software. The PPASC also 
uses DISA's mainframe computer systems on a reimbursable basis. 
The program operates, maintains, and enhances the OA and 
RISC/Unix IT infrastructure and includes funds to pay for the use 
of the DISA's mainframe computer systems. User activities 
include strategic and space simulations and analyses, mobility 
analyses, combat simulations, theater assessments, and program 
review support. 

Cost Changes Between Fiscal Years (±30%) 

FY 1995 Column, President's Budget to FY 1995 Column, FY 1996/FY 

1997 President's Budget 

Note: The most significant changes from the FY 1995 Information 

Technology Budget are the reporting formats. The new formats are 
the result of a collaborative effort between all government 
agencies to simplify and eliminate redxindancy in Information 
Technology Budget reporting. The format's cost categories have 
been aligned with the Federal Information Processing definitions 
of information technology resources as defined in the Federal 
Information Resources Management Regulation. Descriptions of 
changes ±30% in each category follow: 

Equipment (-$107 million): 

Reflects realignment of Defense Message System capital hardware 
purchase funds to capital software purchase category (-$12 
million) and realignment of items previously budgeted as DBOF 
capital investments to DBOF operating expenses (-$92 million). 

Software (+$12 million): 

Reflects realignment of Defense Message System capital hardware 
purchase funds to capital software purchase category (+$12 
million).

(BRAC) Commission, calls for the consolidation of workload from 
59 information processing facilities to 16 Defense Megacenters. 

FY 1996 to FY 1997 

Equipment (-$72 million); Software (-$28 million): 

Decreases reflect completion of most capital investments to 
support the DoD Data Center Consolidation Plan. This plan, 
approved by the 1993 Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) 
Commission, calls for the consolidation of workload from 59 
information processing facilities to 16 Defense Megacenters.

A. AIS Title and Number: Enterprise Integration 

B. CIM Functional Area: Information Management 

C. Life-Cycle Cost and Program Cost: Enterprise Integration is 
an initiative - not an Automated Information System. 

Accordingly, life cycle costing is not applicable. For

D. Cross Reference to Justification Books: Procurement: 

Defense Wide, Items Less than $2 million; O&M: Budget Activity 
3, Defense Information Systems Agency. 

E. System Description: The Enterprise Integration (El) 
initiative is the major effort to facilitate the migration of DoD 
information systems to an open system environment. The El 
initiative supports the decision making and planning for and 
prototyping of migration systems. By doing so, it also supports 
the consolidation and modernization the Defense Information 
Infrastructure (DII) as part of the National Information 
Infrastructure (Nil). El, within the DISA, is not a system, but 
a capability engendered from the integration of individual 
information systems within DoD. The results are to realize cost 
savings to DoD by reducing the number of information applications 
in operation to benefit the warfighter sooner by providing 
greater intra-functional and cross-functional compatibility of 
the critical information required to manage the warfighter from 
home base to deployed operations in a seamless manner. 

F. Program Accomplishments and Plans: 

1. FY 1994 Accomplishments: The primary effort included 
initiation of the DII Functional Migration Prototype at the first 
of six prototype sites to provide "proof of concept" capabilities 
for validating infrastructure and application requirements for 
supporting warfighter/ Joint Task Force operations. Also 
completed prototype validation of the Civilian Personnel Database 
(Tidewater Project) as a part of the Civilian Personnel 
integration plan for the development of a Civilian Personnel Data

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
DEFENSE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AGENCY 
FY 1996/FY 1997 BIENNIAL BUDGET ESTIMATES 

Base. The funds supported a systems integration demonstration of 
standard DoD-wide platforms, data, and applications. The purpose 
of the demonstration was to promote interactive engagements of 
information requirements where infrastructure characteristics of 
DoD policy, data, system security, hardware, software, and 
communications integrate both horizontally and vertically. Other 
accomplishments included initial baselining of legacy and 
migration systems and supporting customers in developing 
migration strategies/plans. 

2. FY 1995 Planned Program: The primary effort this fiscal 
year will be to complete the implementation of the first DII 
prototype at Warner-Robbins and begin the prototype 
implementation at the other five sites to define/refine/verify 
infrastructure and application requirements for supporting 
warfighter/Joint Task Force operations. Both normal and 
contingency operation prototypes will be validated. The 
validation will examine the integration of Commercial-Off-The- 
Shelf (COTS) products and services. The prototype will support 
the DoD functional communities in validating requirements and 
migration/integration solutions through rapid prototyping. Other 
accomplishments will include completing the baselining of 
migration systems and strategies/plans for implementing them. 

3. FY 1996 Planned Program: DII migration prototype 
validations will be continued, utilizing existing hardware, 
software, and other components to provide an environment for 
systems integration evaluation and experimentation to determine 
product and application capability and compatibility. Many 
functional areas will have initiated use of shared databases with 
standardized data elements. El will deijonstrate technical and 
functional applications for sharing information and data. 

Business process improvement and functional economic analyses 
will have been completed for most functional areas. The goal 
will be to have sixty percent of the DoD cross-functionally 
integrated through the institutionalization of common methods and 
tools for achieving improved business methods and information 
management. The El Directorate will assist in the application of 
these methods, tools, standards and architectures across all 
functional areas. Through prototyping or "proof of concept" 
validation El will also ensure technical solutions are integrated 
and satisfy user needs. 

4. FY 1997 Planned Program: Initial migration of 


Exhibit 43, Page 21 of 41 




DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
DEFENSE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AGENCY 
FY 1996/FY 1997 BIENNIAL BUDGET ESTIMATES 

applications identified in FY 1994 will be substantially under 
way. The DII migration prototypes will continue to provide 
"lessons learned" for further implementation. This will be a 
major accomplishment in migrating DoD to an open system 
environment. Improved system capabilities will begin to attain 
productivity levels equivalent to commercial benchmark of 
performance, and will demonstrate the cost effectiveness and 
value added features of the future DII. Integration management 
orchestrates the hand-off of products and the interface between 
multiple organizations, coordinating project activities across 
all functional areas. 

G. Contract Information: The program fully utilizes the DEIS 
contract.

Activity 3, Defense Information Systems Agency 

E. System Description: The DISA Information Systems Security 
Program (ISSP) mission is to execute and manage a unified, fully 
integrated information systems security program and information 
warfare functions within the DOD Defense Information 
Infrastructure (DII) systems; and plan and coordinate DoD Multi¬ 
level Security (MLS) projects and initiatives, support fielding 
and implementation of MLS capabilities and technology at high 
priority commands. The DISA/Center for Information Systems 
Security (CISS), in a joint DISA and National Security Agency 
organizational structure, manages and executes the majority of 
information systems initiatives and programs within DISA. 

The FY 1996/1997 base level O&M program budget will fund 
general operating expenses, infrastructure/database development 
and maintenance, program support for information warfare 
protection, and civilian salaries. The ISSP's civilian billet 
end strength in FY 1996/1997 is 138. 

The Defense Information Systems Security Program was 
established within DISA to insure that the Defense Information 
Infrastructure (DII) is capable of providing complete and 
unaltered information while withstanding naturally occurring and 
malicious (insider and enemy) disruptions to or attacks against 
the infrastructure. In addition to implementing and ..;apporting 
the implementation of protective technologies and mechanisms for 
a variety of systems and operational environments, security

support services are provided to ensure that security mechanisms 
are implemented and maintained over the life cycle of each 
system/network, and that the capability exists to monitor the 
security safeguards established. The Information Systems 
Security Program provides information warfare protection, 
improves the DoD information systems security posture, counters 
evolving automated information system threats, ensures 
information security interoperability, protects data, eliminates 
redundancy, and reduces the cost of DoD information systems 
security operations.

countermeasures to combat same. Additionally, staffed an 
incident handling and response center (ASSIST). This center 
assists DoD AIS sites world-wide in responding to attack by 
internal and external intruders by recommending corrective 
measures, assisting with data retrieval, and recommending 
preventive measures for the future. Conducted Multilevel 
Security surveys and installation of solutions at 2 CINCs. 
Provided Accreditation support to Mega Data Centers. Developed 
the transition strategy for Defense Goal Security Architecture.
