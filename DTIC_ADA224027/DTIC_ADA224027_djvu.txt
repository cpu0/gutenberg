PREFACE 

This work partially fulfills requirements of IDA Task T-D5-304, Ada Validation, 
for support to the Ada Joint Program Office through analysis of technical or management 
issues within the Ada compiler validation process.

1.0 PURPOSE 


The purpose of IDA Memorandum Report M-376, Ada Validation Workload, is to 
provide the Ada Joint Program Office (AJPO) with an analysis of the validation workload 
for Ada compilers and the problems surrounding the annual expiration of an ACVC 
version. This report is intended for those individuals in the AJPO who develop the policy 
and procedures that govern the validation process. 


2.0 SCOPE 


This paper focuses on the Ada Validation Facilities (AVFs) workload associated 
with validations under Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC) version 1.8. A 
projection of workload growth has been excluded from this analysis. Section 3 presents 
the background and date supporting the assertion that there is a serious imbalance in the 
Ada Validation Facility workload. Section 4 discusses findings concerning this imbalance 
and Section 5 provides recommendations for changes to the Validation Procedures and 
Guidelines and to the AVF workforce that will improve the management of that workload 


3.0 BACKGROUND 


Issuance of the AJPO Validation Procedures and Guidelines (Version 1.1) indicates 
that the process of validating Ada compilers has become a relatively stable set of 
procedures. These procedures have undergone continual refinements since the inception of 
validation. However, as much as usage and analysis have identified and eliminated past 
problems with the process, one long-standing problem remains. This problem is the 
concentration of most of the validation work in the three months surrounding the annual 
expiration of the ACVC version on 31 May. The second calendar quarter (April, May, and 
June) constitutes a critical period of intense demand on the resources of the Certification 
Body. This concentration of demand strains the process's human resources and aggravates 
its incident problems.

The demand for validation and re-validation services has increased significantly 
with each ACVC version since version 1.6. The total number of validations completed 
during the life of each ACVC version is shown in Figure 1. Even though the number of 
AVFs has also increased from one to five, the greatest demand for validation and 
revalidation services is not evenly distributable among these five AVFs.

Of the 122 validations completed using ACVC 1.8, about two thirds of the validations were 
conducted after 1 April by three AVFs. Nearly three quarters of all the validation work was 
done from March through June (see Figure 2).

Why is there a critical period of heavy validation demand surrounding the expiration of an 
ACVC version? What can be done to re-distribute or manage this demand? This document 
addresses these questions, analyzes the surrounding issues, and proposes several 
solutions. 


4.0 FINDINGS, DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 


In Section 4.0, we present the findings, discussion, and conclusions concerning the 
factors that contribute to the critical demand period, the probable limit on human resources 
that can be available during this period, and procedural changes that might motivate 
vendors to schedule validation earlier in an ACVC version life. Pertinent pages from the 
Ada Validation Procedures and Guidelines have been included in Appendix A. 

4.1 VENDOR BEHAVIOR 

4.1.1 Finding 

During ACVC 1.8, vendor behavior indicates that there is a tendency to validate or 
re-validate as late as possible in the ACVC version life. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 are being 
interpreted as official permission to complete validation with an expired ACVC version if 
vendors can show the AVF that they have used that version for pre-validation testing before 
it expired (31 May). (See Appendix A for the specific parts of Sections 4.1 and 4.2 that 
address scheduling, use of an expired ACVC, and automatic extension of certificates.) 

4.1.2 Discussion 

The Procedures and Guidelines Section 4.1 is being interpreted to mean that a 
compiler vendor may be permitted to validate a compiler using an expired version of the 
ACVC if the vendor has submitted pre-validation materials to the AVF before 1 June. This 
interpretation ignores the requirement that "the AVF has had sufficient time to determine 
that there are no failures." 1 AVF experience indicates that, on the average, at least two

UNCLASSIFIED 


weeks should be allowed for analysis, resolution of issues, and preparation of the draft 
validation summary report (VSR) for Ada Joint Program Office/Ada Validation 
Organization (AJPO/AVO) review and comment. The number of validations completed 
after 31 May (with an expired test suite) indicates that several AVFs imposed the 31 May 
deadline for submission of pre-validation materials but performed analysis of these 
materials later. 

Section 4.2 requires that a vendor submit a compiler for revalidation in a timely 
manner (as defined in Section 4.1, Step 4, page 10), in order to qualify for automatic 
extension of the validation certificate (VC). Thus the Procedures and Guidelines require 
that the vendor give consideration to the time estimates given in Section 4.1 for completing 
the validation process, including issuing a certificate. However, some vendors wishing to 
re-validate have not reflected this consideration of the time required to analyze pre¬ 
validation materials and to complete the subsequent steps leading to a certificate. 

Of the 43 re-validations under ACVC 1.8,18 were done after the expiration of the 
VC. Of the 24 revalidations that took place one month or more prior to the expiration of a 
VC, 9 of these were early re-validation under ACVC version 1.8 rather than version 1.9 
with its increased coverage. Another 5 revalidations were performed just prior to the end 
of the 3-month extension period that all 1.6 VCs received. Only 10 of these 24 
revalidations were performed significantly in advance of the compiler's VC. 

In the pre-April period, the validation workload was evenly divided between new 
validations and revalidations. In the critical period, revalidations numbered about the same 
as before; however, the bulk of the demand during the last quarter was for testing 
compilers that had not been validated before. When vendors encountered development 
problems, it was necessary to re-schedule validation even later. There was some indication 
that even experienced vendors planned first-time validations as late as possible. 

4.1.3 Conclusions 

• The Procedures and Guidelines document is being interpreted in a way that 
permits informal extensions of the 12-month ACVC version life. 

• The vendor demand pattern evident during ACVC 1.8 (and 1.7) will persist in 
subsequent ACVC cycles. Since there is no incentive for early validation and 


4 

UNCLASSIFIED 






UNCLASSIFIED 


re-validation, testing under AC VC 1.9 will be concentrated in the last quarter 
and continue through July, or later. 

4.2 ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES 

4.2.1 Finding 

The AJPO should consider feasible approaches for reducing vendor tendencies to 
schedule late and for reducing peak AVF workloads caused by the expiration of an ACVC 
version. 

4.2.2 Discussion 

We have found that three approaches are feasible. They are: 

• extending certificate life; 

• providing for late validation; and, 

• fixing certificate expiration dates. 

4.2.2.1 Extended Certificate Life 

The extended certificate life approach attempts to use exhibited vendor behavior to 
more evenly distribute the demand for services. Since new vendors can be expected to 
validate as late as possible in the ACVC version life, we can leave this period open for new 
vendors by issuing a certificate that expires later than 12 months from the date of issue 
(e.g., 16 months). The central idea is to issue a certificate that has a longer life than the 
ACVC version so that certificates issued at one point in the ACVC version cycle will expire 
at a different point. Although the present year’s large number of critical-period validations 
would still present a concentrated demand for revalidation, this demand would come at a 
different point in the ACVC cycle from the expected heavy demand for new validations. 
The peaks in demand for re-validation may begin to even out as some vendors rely on 
automatic extensions of their certificates to do re-validations at a later date. However, the 
concentration of re-validation workload is not likely to be significantly dispersed 
throughout the year.

4.2.2.2 Limited Provision for Late Validation 

This alternative provides conditions for using an ACVC test suite version after its 
expiration date. It is intended to remove a particular date from being the focus of last- 
minute validation efforts by allowing additional time for vendors to complete their 
implementation while imposing a reduction in the life of the validation certificate that can be 
received as a result of using an expired versions of the ACVC for validation. 

In this alternative, disputed tests must be submitted by the vendor before expiration 
of the ACVC version that will be used for validation. Pre-validation materials may be 
submitted to the AVF after the expiration date of the ACVC version, but these materials 
must reflect the AVO resolution of any disputed tests. On-site testing should begin within a 
month following submission of the pre-validation materials. If on-site testing completes 
successfully, the vendor will be awarded a validation certificate with an expiration date that 
is equal to the test suite version's expiration date plus one year. It is expected that this 
provision for late validation will not be used repeatedly by a vendor. The AVF can 
discourage vendors from habitual late validation through contract negotiations. 

The certification body (AJPO, AVO, AVFs) may define other conditions to be met 
in order to qualify for late validation. For example, it may be desirable to establish a cut¬ 
off date for submission of a letter of intent, or for submission of pre-validation materials, 
or for completing on-site testing. These deadlines may be desirable so that an AVF can 
arrange to preserve its capability to use the expired ACVC without impact on validations 
with the current ACVC. The late validation alternative is limited by the requirement for 
submission of disputed tests before the ACVC version expires and may include other 
deadlines that can be imposed by the certification body. 

4.2.2.3 Fixed 12-Month Certificate 

The fixed 12-month certificate approach addresses the vendor tendency to schedule 
validation near or after the expiration date of an existing certificate. With this alternative, 
the expiration date of a certificate is always 12 months from the expiration date of the 
previous certificate (rather than 12 months from the date of issue as is the current practice). 
Vendors who validate earlier than the expiration date do not lose some period of validated 
status under a current certificate. Vendors who wait to schedule until just before or after a 
certificate expiration date do not gain the additional time granted by an automatic extension 
because the new certificate expiration date will be fixed at 12 months from the expiration 


6

UNCLASSIFIED 


date of the old certificate. Thus vendors with current validation certificates would be less 
motivated to schedule later and might start validation earlier. This motivation can be 
reinforced by requiring the vendor to schedule or begin on-site testing prior to the 
expiration of the current certificate in order to qualify for an automatic extension. 

4.2.3 Conclusions 

The Extended Certificate Life alternative will help segregate workloads for re¬ 
validations from validation of new implementations, but does not directly address vendor 
tendency to schedule late in an ACVC version life or after expiration of a VC. Limited 
Provision for Late Validation and the Fixed 12-month Certificate alternatives, taken 
together, provide motivation for vendors to cooperate with AVFs in managing workload 
schedules. Thus vendor motivation is in the form of disincentives for delays in scheduling 
and completing validation. 

4.3 AVF WORKLOAD 

4.3.1 Finding 

The three AVFs with the heaviest workloads are those that have, or soon will have 
contracts in place, for validation services of Ada compilers. Only one of these AVFs can 
augment the workforce during the critical period. 

4.3.2 Discussion 

Contractor support for validation services is intended to provide personnel who are 
skilled in analytical and on-site testing procedures for one or more programming languages. 
These contracts provide an AVF with a labor pool but there is some limit as to the numbers 
of people with experience in Ada validation who can be available during the peak workload 
period for Ada validation. Figure 3 is an estimate of the number of contractor personnel 
that can be used by AVFs to perform technical tasks associated with Ada compiler 
validation.

Wright-Patterson uses these contractor personnel in teams consisting of two people 
per validation projects with each team is capable of completing one project per month. At 
NBS and in the UK, teams are generally not used. The analyst hours per validation project 
can vary from 150 to 350 hours; however, on the average, the output for NBS and the UK 
is one validation project per person-month (14 per month). Thus the combined validation 
service capacity for these three AVFs is about 22 validation projects per month. Wright- 
Patterson is the only AVF that can increase the number of available teams if there is 
adequate lead-time to locate or train analysts. However, this expansion of resources has 
some limit, as yet undefined, in terms of available funds and human resources. 

The demand for last quarter validation under ACVC 1.8 at these three AVFs was 82 
validations. Even though this number includes several validations that were completed 
within a single project (requiring only one on-site visit by the AVF), the demand for ACVC 
1.9 validations and re-validations will likely exceed the supply of AVF resources as new 
customers are added to the demand pattern. The extra workforce that Wright-Patterson 
may be able to obtain during the critical period will be a crucial factor in being able to 
accommodate the workload for ACVC 1.9. The establishment of an additional AVF in the 
U.S., with a contract modeled on the current Wright-Patterson contracting vehicle, would 
provide more flexibility not only for peak workload periods but also for meeting an overall 
increase in workload. 

4.3.3 Conclusion 

The capability of the AVFs in the US and in the UK to accommodate an expanding 
workload for Ada validation services is limited. Concentration of demand during the 
critical period in 1988 will expose these limitations.

5.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

5.1 LIMITED PROVISION FOR LATE VALIDATION 

Permit a limited use of an expired ACVC version by incorporating a Limited 
Provision for Late Validation in the wording of the Ada Validation Procedures and 
Guidelines, paragraph 4.1. The following revised wording is proposed: (the new wording 
has been italicized) 

Paragraph 4.1 STEPS AND PROCEDURES. There are nine steps in the 
Ada VALIDATION process that a VENDOR and the CERTIFICATION 
BODY must successfully complete. It is expected that the first seven of 
these steps will be completed prior to the expiration of the ACVC version 
that is used in VALIDATION testing. These steps are: 

Paragraphs 4.1.1 through 4.1.3 - no change. 

Paragraphs 4.1.4 - Last paragraph within 4.1.4 (ref. page 10, Ada 
Validation Procedures and Guidelines). 

In the event that a VENDOR completes step three in the VALIDATION 
process (i.e., Negotiate a formal agreement and submit disputed ACVC 
tests) prior to the expiration date of the current ACVC, and that the 
expiration date is subsequently reached before the VALIDATION process is 
complete, then the VENDOR is allowed to proceed with the original ACVC 
provided that: 

a. The AVF determines that there are no failures of APPLICABLE 
ACVC TESTS, and 

b. the VENDOR does not submit test disputes after the expiration of 
the ACVC version that will be used for validation, and 

c. the AVF agrees to complete the VALIDATION process after 
giving consideration to already scheduled work.

UNCLASSIFIED 








UNCLASSIFIED 


Completing the VALIDATION after the expiration of an ACVC version 
is a late VALIDATION. It is intended that there will be a limited use of the 
provision for late VALIDATION by VENDORS. The AVF may impose 
additional conditions that must be met by the VENDOR to ensure that a 
VENDOR does not habitually rely on late VALIDATION. 

5.2 FIXED 12-MONTH CERTIFICATE 

Provide explicit qualifying conditions for an automatic extension of a 
VALIDATION CERTIFICATE by incorporating a Fixed 12-Month Certificate in the 
wording of Section 4.2. The following wording is offered for consideration. Changes to 
the current wording have been italicized. 

Paragraph 4.2 CERTIFICATE EXPIRATION. VALIDATION 
CERTIFICATES expire in accordance with the time period established by 
the Director, AJPO. This time period is currently one year after the date of 
issue when the VENDOR has completed step 7 of the VALIDATION 
process prior to expiration of the ACVC version used for VALIDATION. 
Subsequent VALIDATION CERTIFICATES issued for this BASE 
COMPILER will have an expiration date that is fixed at one time period 
beyond that of the previous VALIDATION CERTIFICATE when the 
VENDOR has completed step 7 of the VALIDATION process prior to the 
expiration date of the ACVC version used for VALIDATION. When a 
VENDOR has completed step 7 of the VALIDATION process after the 
expiration date of the ACVC version used for VALIDATION, the expiration 
date of the VALIDATION CERTIFICATE will be one time period beyond 
the expiration date of the ACVC. 

A BASE COMPILER and associated DERIVED COMPILERS will be 
removed from the list of VALIDATED Ada COMPILERS when the 
VALIDATION CERTIFICATE for the BASE COMPILER expires. The 
VENDOR may request that the AJPO not remove the BASE COMPILER 
and associated DERIVED COMPILERS from the list of VALIDATED Ada 
COMPILERS when the VENDOR has: 


10 

UNCLASSIFIED 




UNCLASSIFIED 


a. begun step 7 of the VALIDATION process prior to the expiration 
date of the VALIDATION CERTIFICATE for the BASE COMPILER, 
or 

b. requested an AVF to schedule step 7 prior to the expiration date of 
the VALIDATION CERTIFICATE for the BASE COMPILER but has 
been delayed because the AVF had prior commitments for 
VAUDATION. 

It is the intent of the CERTIFICATION BODY that VENDORS schedule the 
REVALIDATION of their VALIDATED COMPILERS to occur in advance 
of the expiration of the associated VALIDATION CERTIFICATE. By 
applying a rule for establishing the expiration date at a fixed time period that 
is relative to the previous expiration date, a VAUDATION CERTIFICATE 
extends the time that an Ada COMPILER is a VAUDATED COMPILER by 
a fixed amount, regardless of when the actual testing occurs. Thus, all 
VENDORS may complete step 7 well before the expiration date of a 
VAUDATION CERTIFICATE without concern for redundant coverage." 

5.3 AVF WORKLOAD 

A decision to establish an additional AVF should be based upon analysis of the 
workload for ACVC 1.9. This analysis should also include the geographic distribution of 
clients and criteria for selecting an organizational entity that will be chartered as an AVF.
