SUMMARY 


A generalized mathematical modeling program is used to 
project the best performance of four types of biowaste resis- 
tojets and two hydrazine augmenters. Its use with a personal 
computer and Basic programming language permits the designer to 
obtain results which have been found to approximate closely ex- 
perimental results. The biowaste designs are analyzed for best 
design separately on carbon dioxide or steam at 1573*K heater 
temperature. Designs of augmenters of decomposed products of 
hydrazine were also evaluated at heater temperatures of 2073 *K. 
System adequacy in terms of such variables as response are 
verified also, where necessary. 

The first design, Concept 1 , uses a compact electric heater- 
convective heat exchanger made of an electrically conductive 
ceramic, cubic phase stabilized zirconia (mp 2860 W K). It is al- 
ready an oxide itself and, thus, has the highest growth poten- 
tial with the oxidizing biowaste gases studied. At 2000°K, 70% 

of its melting temperature, the specific impulse is projected to 
be 192.5 and 269 seconds for COa and H^O (steam), respectively. 
An auxiliary starting heater is required which, operating by 
itself, produces 133 seconds (C0 2 ) and satisfies the study 
specific impulse criteria, giving a redundant reliability. The 
time for the starting cycle is shown as acceptable if cold starts 
are required. Its standby heated mode is of low power consump- 
tion of 22 watts. 

Of the biowaste resistant metal-oxide grain stabilized 
platinum heaters, Concept 3 is the next recommended candidate of 
those studied. The specific impulse is 170 and 240 for CO^ and 
H*0 (steam) in turn. The overall power efficiency is .79 and .78 
for each. The bicoil consists of two platinum coils of precisely 
the same tubular heating length and cross-sectional diameter 
coiled in opposite rotation, one closely fitting within the other 
directly exposed to the biowaste gases. The pressure drop and 
flow of each passage and the resistance heating length are the 
same. The cross over points are at the same voltage potential 
and the two coils are physically bonded to one another there. As 
a result, the bicoil design is found by stress analysis using 
numerical methods to be stable and transversely rigid yet accom- 
modating for axial thermal expansion compensation. The gas flow 
in passing through the tubes of the bicoil closely approaches the 
wall in temperature. The design has the favorable features of a 
low temperature outer pressure case. No electrical insulation is 
used in the high temperature zones.

Concept 4 is a radiant non-exposed heater design. It physi- 
cally separates the heat exchanger function, which may be made 
more massive, from that of the ohmic heater, which may be 
separately designed for higher voltage. Used as a biowaste 
resistojet, the heat exchanger may be made of grain stabilized 
platinum with a thickness to insure its structural integrity. 
The ohmic heater, not being exposed to the biowaste bases, may be 
made of grain stabilized rhenium, the highest temperature 
capability of available conductive ductile materials. The heater 
temperature of the study of the hydrazine augmenters of 2073 *K is 
used as logical as it is not exposed to the biowastes. 

Two variations of the radiant design studied are of the 
pressurized and unpressurized heater cavity types. A pressurized 
cavity, though, shows a significant improvement, particularly 
with a high emissivity surface incorporated into the radiation 
heat transfer link. The pressurized type design requires a metal 
to ceramic seal and an inert pressurant line to the cavity. The 
notable characteristic of this type design is the much larger 
temperature difference required between heater and gas than all 
the other designs for the same specific impulse. 

Because its exchanger thermal mass is ten times higher than 
the direct convective exchanger - heater design, it has a slower 
response to reach its specific impulse from rest on short 
firings. 

The radiant heater design must be specifically sized with 
regard to power required for a specific propellant. There is a 
much wider variation in resultant gas temperature when various 
propellants are run in a fixed design. 

The bicoil heater-convective-exchanger and radiant type 
designs are again compared, specifically redesigned for use as a 
hydrazine augmenter. 

Concept 5, the bicoil, produces the highest gas temperature 
of 2007°K, hence specific impulse of 317 seconds for a given max- 
imum heater temperature of 2073*K compared to 1727*K for the gas 
temperature for the best radiant design, giving a specific im- 
pulse of 295 seconds. The overall effiencies are comparable, .73 
vs .72, respectively. A pressurizing inert gas is used in the 
case of the best of the radiant designs. 

The detailed heat transfer with resultant temperature 
profile results of each design are shown, as well as the con- 
struction details of the designs. The scaled layout drawings of 
each concept are presented with materials and recommended 
fabrication methods.

INTRODUCTION 


The early development of resistojets started at Lewis Re- 
search Center with Jack (ref. 1) in 1960. Similar development 
was concurrently undertaken in industry by Howard (ref. 2) who 
used some early mathematical modeling of the heat transfer 
process by means of a computer. This work focused on a 30 kW 
level of power with a goal of 6.67 N (1.5 lb*-) of thrust and 
specific impulse goal of up to 1000 seconds on hydrogen. As the 
expectations for availability of these levels of power 
diminished. Page (ref. 3) reported a3kW, .67 N (150 mlb*-) of 
thrust at a measured specific impulse of 840 seconds on hydrogen. 
Subsequently, Page (ref. 4) reported resistojets of .045 N (10 
mlbr ) for hydrogen or ammonia, achieving a specific impulse of 
668 and 320 seconds, respectively. Life tests of >8000 hours 
were demonstrated on these thrusters (ref. 5). These showed 
promise on the MORL studies (ref. 6) for use on manned space 
stations, particularly when made of biowaste resistant materials. 

Approximately 26 flight experiments and operational propul- 
sion systems using resistojets were developed by many groups from 
1965 to 1984. About 40 hydrazine resistojets are performing 
North/South station keeping functions on Intelsat V and RCA 
spacecraft. At present, NASA is pursuing the development of a 
permanent facility in space. This facility is comprised of a 
manned Space Station core, platforms and free-flying spacecraft 
which require propulsion systems for orbit maintenance, 
maneuvering, and possibly attitude control. The resistojet sys- 
tem is a strong candidate to satisfy these auxiliary propulsion 
requirements which are more demanding and variable than those of 
present space systems. Resistojet systems provide benefits which 
include, 1 ) the ability to operate on many candidate propellants 
including station fluids, 2) the use of gaseous, nontoxic propel- 
lants which can ease the problems of distribution, maintenance 
and contamination, 3) low variable thrust which produces ac- 
celerations below those of concern to users and provides the op- 
tions of precision acceleration and ephemeris control, and 4) 
growth potential to high specific impulse for evolutionary sta- 
tions and performance driven advanced free-flyers. 

The advent of the personal computer gives the design en- 
gineer the opportunity to rapidly model resistojet configurations 
to provide development guidance. In this study, a generalized 
axi symmetrical model diagram has been developed which may have 
dimensions of its elements prescribed so as to closely resemble 
the shape of the thruster being studied and the thermal relation- 
ship between elements assigned via subroutines. The use of the 
IBM PC and the Basic programming language allows the designer to 
quickly debug his program. When compiled, the code has much 


3 


faster execution. The few numbers of runs required justifies the 
somewhat long run times of several hours to come to a solution as 
a trade against significant reduction of programming time. 

Four biowaste resistojet designs and two hydrazine augmen- 
ters are analyzed and numerical results compared for recommenda- 
tions of designs for performance and qualitatively for 
reliability to give guidance to future resistojet designs.

The detailed descriptions of each of these concepts as to 
geometry, materials, fabrication and the supporting design study 
analyses are covered in the respective appendices, A through F. 
Included there are the results from each model by a mathematical 
modeling program using a generalized node diagram for heat 
transfer, gas and electric flow. The latter is described under 
Analytical Procedure. It permits solution of the steady state 
and transient equations. The gas dynamics analysis also includes 
pressure drop calculations. The pertinent structural and other 
mechanical effects are treated separately as are chemical 
corrosion, sublimation and deposition effects.

The study models are shown in conceptual form in figures 1 
and 2. Their concepts are described below. Note that all designs 
employ regenerators which are favorably configured in each case 
for maximum efficiency. 


Biowaste Resistojets 

Concept 1 uses an electrically conducting heater exchanger 
of cubic phase stabilized zirconia capable of directly heating 
the biowaste gas reliably to more than 2000 *K. Stabilized 
zirconia, itself an oxide, is highly resistant to oxidizing 
gases. It has a high melting point of 2860 *K compared to its 
nearest metallic counterpart of grain stabilized platinum of 
2047*K. The high electric resistance allows generous structural 
heater cross sections and a high terminal voltage. Because zir- 
conia is an electric insulator effectively below 1000*K, a 
starter heater must be provided which is shown. The preheater is 
located outside the pressure case. Since it is therefore unex- 

posed to biowaste gases, it can be made of grain stabilized 
rhenium (mp 3453°K). Operation on the preheater alone achieves 
the goal specific impulse and, hence contributes further to 
reliability. 

Concept 2 is based upon two novel features, the radially in- 
verted functional design and the truss heater. This biowaste 
resistojet uses the metal-oxide grain stabilized platinum for the 
heater as well as the highest temperature components. The pres- 
sure case is its outermost member. The wide passages 

regenerators are adjacent and interior to the pressure case. All 
thermal insulation is contained within these. Functionally it is 
radially "inverted" from all others studied except Concept 3. 
Consequently, it is one of implied higher structural reliability 
and thermal efficiency. No pressure balancing considerations are 
required within the design to prevent creep of the critical inner 
elements. The truss heater is a wire type heater using an exter- 
nal cross flow heat exchanger which is structurally designed for 
high transverse strength yet axial compliance and high electric 
resistance. This design eliminates the need for electrical in- 
sulators in the high temperature zone. 

Concept 3 introduces a new type heater, a heat exchanger 
using internal forced convection which is best described as two 
coils of opposite rotation of precisely the same tubular heating 
length and cross sectional diameter. One coil is located within 
the other and is of tighter pitch. The two coils are physically 
bonded to one another at the crossover points. The pressure drop 
of each passage is the same. The cross over points are at the 
same voltage potential. Hence they are metallurgically bonded 
there for transverse structural rigidity, yet remain axially 
compliant. The radial inverted geometry of Concept 2 is used, 
hence it also has the features of a low temperature reliable 
outer pressure case and high overall thermal efficiency.

Concept 4 physically separates the heat exchanger function 
from that of the ohmic heater. It has an indirect radiant heater 
in an inert gas pressurized central cavity radiating and conduct- 
ing to a heat exchanger in the pressure case flowing the biowaste 
expellants. The inert gas suppresses sublimation of the heater. 
A high emissivity surface incorporated in the radiation heat 
transfer link makes a notable further improvement over unpres- 
surized designs. The radial order of components is contemporary. 
A rhenium (mp 3453°K) heater suitably protected by inert gas in 
the cavity may operate at a significantly higher temperature than 
grain stabilized platinum (mp 2047 °K) which are exposed to the 
biowaste gases. The platinum members are within goal 
temperatures. 


Hydrazine Electrothermal Augmenters 

Concept 5, like Concept 3 presented earlier as a biowaste 
resistojet, uses the bicoil configuration as an integrated 
tubular ohmic heater and gas heat exchanger for a hydrazine 
augmenter. The philosophy of the design is to achieve the lowest 
material temperature operation for the goal specific impulse. 
This promotes reliability and longer life. Primarily because of 
the high temperature inlet gases from the decomposition chamber, 
a high temperature central pressure case design is used. The in- 
let temperature is 866 ’K if the ammonia is fully dissociated and 
higher if not. A higher heater thermal efficiency is found from 
this choice. This is unlike Concept 3 which has a cool inlet of 
biowaste gases of low thermal conductivity. All high temperature 
parts are fabricated of grain stabilized rhenium. No electric 
insulation is used in the high temperature zones. Propellant 
flow deters backstreaming of any sublimed metallic vapors onto 
the metal to ceramic seal. 

Concept 6 is geometrically identical to Concept 4 but is of 
rhenium. It physically separates the heater and exchanger func- 
tion from that of the ohmic heater. The heater and exchanger may 
thus be each made of different materials, each favorable to its 
own design. The figure illustrates the concept schematically. 
Because of the decoupling of the designs, the voltage of the 
heater may be made higher and the walls of the gas exchanger 
thicker than if the design were an integral one. The design 
here, as a hydrazine augmenter, has all high temperature parts 
fabricated of the same material, grain stabilized rhenium. A 
unique feature of the design is the use of a sturdy quad-coil, 
described functionally earlier for the bicoil model, to give more 
reliability against touching. The heater cavity again uses a 
high emissivity receiving surface and a pressurized cavity.

ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE 


The performance parameters of the study are defined in ap- 
pendix G with the terms used for a common baseline of comparison 
between concepts.

given in the table below.

For steam operation a separate evaporator design is shown as 
required to insure vapor injection into the resistojet. For 
hydrazine operation the input gas is from a first stage reactor. 

The supply pressure is that necessary to provide a pressure 
at the nozzle of 3 atmospheres in all cases. This was chosen as 
a reasonable value to use in order to give an acceptable throat 
diameter at the 50 mlb (.22 N) thrust level. 


Heater Performance 

The gas flow and heat transfer analysis of the heater com- 
ponent of each thruster has been undertaken by a generalized 
numerical modeling technique described in appendix H. The 
specific transformation of the generalized model is shown graphi- 
cally under each concept. It closely resembles the shape of the 
engine under study. Design drawings of the layout drawings of 
each concept are seen to closely compare with their models. 

The mathematical computational model employed here was used 
for this study in order to make rapid detailed studies of a num- 
ber of resistojet concepts. Such calculations were necessary to 
make meaningful heater recommendations. The numerical values in 
the performance tables were derived directly from these analyses 
and the following one described for the nozzles. The former is 
presented herein in appendix H in synoptic form. The program was 
written in basic and executed on an ordinary IBM PC machine. 

The nodal positional indices for a cylindrical coordinate 
system are presented in array format. The array indices keep the 


8 



same relationship to the functional physical member independent 
of adjustment of the overall dimensions of the thruster under 
study. By assignment of specific dimensional multipliers both 
axially and radially to each of the generalized nodes , the shapes 
of each configuration can be approximated. This makes it con- 
venient to compare temperatures, for instance, versus functional 
locations between similar designs. For example, a longer design 
can be compared to a shorter one. 

In order to keep within the initial memory constraints, the 
computational model assumed an initial mass flow close to the an- 
ticipated value. During the course of the relaxation to the tem- 
perature distribution, the actual resulting mass flows are noted 
and adjustments made in mass flow. These were made manually be- 
cause of the time allowed during reaching equilibrium amounted to 
approximately six hours. The convenience of setting up the model 
in compiled Basic was that it can be checked out in the interpre- 
tive mode for fast check out. The code was then compiled. The 
use of Basic was not a penalty as the number of cases run were 
small and the penalty of run time was not significant. A thrust 
check is shown to compare the the closeness to the 50 mlb 
condition. 


Nozzle Performance 

The overall total power efficiency of the resistojet is the 
product of the nozzle and heater efficiencies. See Appendix G. 
The heater efficiency is derived from the particular heat ex- 
changer analysis for the configuration under study. It is the 
primary variable exercised in this investigation. The basis of 
the performance of the nozzle is the same for all those studied 
here and is a function of Reynolds number, defined below. The 
thermal analysis then delineates the major differences between 
designs. 

Specific Impulse .- Based upon a study of reported experimen- 
tal measurements of low thrust, pure gas rockets and their cor- 
relation with viscous nozzle theory, a nozzle design prediction 
method was developed as part of the program of reference 4 and 
reported as an appendix to reference 7 of the same series. Based 
upon this method which accounts for losses due to frozen flow, 
incomplete expansion, divergence, and viscous effects, the 
specific performance is summarized in figure 3. Shown is the 
projected performance for CO*, H a 0 and decomposed hydrazine over 
the temperature range of interest for the 50 millipounds thrust 
class resistojet. The total gas temperature cited is at inlet to 
the nozzle. 

Efficiency .- The geometries of the conical nozzles based 
upon a 1 50 mlb«. and a 1.5 lbr resistojet were measured and found 
to have excellent nozzle efficiencies (ref. 3). See table 3 for

typical geometry used. Note the nozzle power efficiencies used 
in the study are consistently derived from reference 7 with the 
physical properties of the propellants reported herein. The 
geometry and performance of this nozzle is expected to be close 
to that indicated based on the reference 3 results.

Note that fully dissociated hydrazine, which is one mole of 
N* and two of H*, was selected in the study as the desired input 
gas to the augmenter. The expected frozen flow losses are ex- 
perienced in the preceding decomposition chamber component. 
Since this chamber was not part of the design study, it prevents 
reporting the overall efficiency of the overall decomposition 
chamber-augmenter system. The efficiencies reported are of the 
augmenter alone. Note from figure 5 that for both the hydrazine 
augmenter and the biowaste resistojet, no further dissociation 
occurs over the inlet conditions and the frozen flow component, 
n^, of overall nozzle efficiency, n M , of all cases studied is 
unity. See appendix G for definitions. 


Overall Performance Calculations 

The flow diagram for the overall analysis is shown in the 
adjacent diagram. The results of the Mathematical Computational 
Model (Appendix H), which is primarily an evaluation of the tem- 
perature profile and heater efficiency, is input into the viscous 
nozzle study results. This is the gas temperature, pressure and 
mass flow to the nozzle chamber. Based upon these specific gas 
properties from the thermodynamics properties bank (Appendix I) 
and the viscous nozzle study, the specific impulse, overall 
nozzle efficiency, and hence, the overall efficiency result.

Life and Reliability Criteria 


No mathematical analysis was made with regard to reliability 
as there was no basic life data in this field with which to es- 
tablish it. The comments on reliability generally are practical 
ones where redundancy is observed or where functional designs can 
be considered qualitatively more reliable than others. 

All analyses are based upon extrapolation of test data for 
the determination of life as no full term data are known. 


Overall Rating Criteria 

The overall rating criteria are based upon the requirements 
of table 1 , Resistojet Performance Goals, in the main. The fol- 
lowing notions were used: 

1 ) Did the design, under the operating condition 
constraints, meet the goal conditions required? 

2) What was the relative order of potential performance 

achievement relative to the baseline goals? The 
greater performance potential of one design over 
another can imply more reliability at the goal 

condition, other conditions being equal. 

3) Does the design have redundant features? What are the 
implications on reliability? 


MATERIALS 


Propellants 

For the mathematical modeling, the thermodynamic and 
transport properties of the pure propellants were needed. The 
three propellants are carbon dioxide and water vapor for the 
biowaste resistojets and hydrazine for the augmenters. The three 
properties, specific heat, viscosity and thermal conductivity, of 
equilibrium mixtures derived from each pure substance were calcu- 
lated for a pressure of three atmospheres and a temperature range 
of 300 to 2600°K. These are presented in figure 4. The data are 
tabulated in appendix I. 

The equilibrium compositions were calculated using a method 
of Gibbs free energy minimization described in reference 8. Data 
for this method was obtained from reference 9. 

Thermodynamic properties for the sixteen resultant com- 
ponents were obtained from reference 10, except for the thermal

conductivity of water vapor. In this reference, thermal conduc- 
tivity was calculated using an equation which, according to the 
author, shows poor correlations to experimental data for polar 
molecules. As the values are about 30% higher than those of 
three other sources at temperatures for which they were 
available, thermal conductivity of water vapor was instead taken 
from reference 11. 

Properties of the equilibrium mixtures thus determined were 
calculated using the equations described in reference 12. 

As a practical matter, the propellants supplied would most 
probably contain other chemical species which are indigenous from 
their production source. These must be addressed in any practi- 
cal design. 

The hydrazine augmenter receives its propellant from the 
first stage decomposition chamber. The decomposition reactant 
from this chamber is given by the reaction equation (1): 

N a H* -> 4 (1-x) NH 3 + 1 (1+2x)N* + 2 x Ha (1) 

3 3 


The temperature and properties of the gas can vary widely depend- 
ing on x, the degree of reaction. The propellant description 
chosen here is that of full decomposition (x = 1 ) for definition, 
resulting in a gas temperature of 866. 5 *K. The gas then consists 
of one mole of nitrogen and two moles of hydrogen with no 
ammonia. This is the most favorable input for several reasons. 
This condition represents the lowest interstage transfer 
temperature, hence, minimizes interstage heat loss. Too, it 
simplifies the analysis of the augmenter in that no chemical 
kinetics assumptions must be made as is described under the ther- 
mal analysis of the augmenter s presented. This assumption has 
small impact on the final augmenter power performance figures 
presented, only the thermal profile. 

The temperature range of this study did not encounter the 
need for consideration of dissociation of the expellants other 
than the hydrazine which was considered fully decomposed. 
Neither the hydrogen nor the nitrogen significantly dissociates 
in the temperature range of interest. See figure 5.

The material finally selected for each function depended 
upon its ability to withstand the combined effects of 
temperature, pressure and gas atmospheres to which they were sub- 
jected in the design. The candidates selected have evolved over 
a long development period for each propellant classification from 
a number of experimental studies and experiences of the authors 
and others with resistojets (refs. 4, 5, 13, 14, 15). Table 4

Structure .- For the biowaste, the metal selected was grain 
stabilized platinum, based upon the extensive experimental 
studies of references 14, 15, and particularly, 16. Recent 
developments in the grain stabilization are discussed in the lat- 
ter reference. 

As the strength of platinum is low, the use of grain stabi- 
lization is extremely attractive for improving its high tempera- 
ture endurance strength. As a guide, the ultimate strength of 
zirconia grain stabilized platinum at 1573*K is four to five 
times greater than pure platinum alone. 

Concept 1 uses a metal oxide, cubic phase stabilized 
zirconia, which is capable of withstanding the biowaste gases and 
other oxides to significantly higher temperatures than platinum, 
that is approximately 600°C higher 1 Concept 4 chooses the 
refractory metal, rhenium, for its heater with a similar high 
temperature capability using radiative transfer in a separate 
cavity with an inert environment. Therefore, the consideration 
of the materials, zirconia and rhenium, also are applicable to 
the biowaste thrusters. The properties of these three candidates 
structurally are reviewed. 

Because of its (a) superb ductile behavior, (b) high 
strength at temperature, (c) weldability, and (d) successful 
prior experience with thruster design in electric propulsion, 
grain stabilized rhenium was chosen for the entire hot structure 
of the hydrazine augmenter. 

Mechanical Properties: Data for 10,000 hours, if they exist 
at all, were not possible to obtain at this time. Therefore, ex- 
trapolation from existing data is necessary. Based on reference 
16, a supplier of grain stabilized platinum# the following en- 
durance stress design line for grain stabilized platinum was 
generated. The endurance stress, o, in kilopascals at 10,000 
hours was calculated at each temperature, T, in *K for grain sta- 
bilized platinum by, 

logio o = -2.13 x 10 _a T + 7.115 (2) 

As the strength of pure platinum, is low, the use of grain stabi- 
lization is extremely attractive for improving its high tempera- 
ture endurance strength. As a guide, the ultimate strength of 


zirconia grain stabilized platinum at 1753*K 
times greater than pure platinum alone. 

is

Values of endurance stress for Zr0 2 

may 

be 

found 

in 


reference 17. The allowable stress for ZrO* values are small and 
the applied stresses in designs using these heaters must be kept 
small. This is done by designing low pressure drops in the ex- 
changer which are in turn pressure balanced externally so as to 
be in slight compression. 


17 


The physical structural properties of grain stabilized 
rhenium are as yet unknown, but are anticipated to be sig- 
nificantly 4 better in endurance stress rupture capability as has 
been demonstrated for the other refractory metals (refs. 18 and 
19). For the structural analysis of this study, however, pure 
rhenium data were used because of its availability, which are ex- 
pected to have greater reliability. The endurance strength of 
rhenium, for a 10,000 hour design line, was chosen based upon a 
Larson-Miller correlation with the data of reference 20 and is 
shown in equation 3. 

logic a m -1.043 x 10'® T + 6.257 (3) 

Recently the addition of grain stabilizing metal oxides to 
rhenium has been found possible in the refined shapes required 
here (ref. 21). No stress design data is as yet available. 

Physical Properties: The thermophysical properties of the 

material used in the study for each of the functional elements of 
the resistojet are tabulated in appendix I. These tabulated data 
were generated from the polynomials used in the mathematical com- 
putational model, which are in turn based on the best recommended 
values from the Thermophysical Properties of Matter from the 
Purdue Series (ref. 22). 

Sublimation: The process of a material passing directly 

from a solid to a vapor state from a surface causing its 
recession, either under vacuum or with a suppressant gas, is an 
important factor in determining the service life of a device 
operating at high temperature. The surface recession rate is 
greatest in the vacuum. It can be suppressed by many orders of 
magnitude by adding an inert atmosphere. Key references used for 
vacuum were Dushman ref. 23), and for zirconia specifically 
(ref. 24). The sublimation recession rates for a number of very 
high temperature materials in vacuum are shown in figure 6. 

The surface recession rate under forced convection mass 
transfer uses the methods of Zima (ref. 25) and Dushman (ref. 
23) . 


Chemical corrosion resistance: The chemical corrosion 
processes at high temperature are very complex. Interactions be- 
tween all of the components of the system can occur. This in- 
volves a) members which are in contact, namely heater elements, 
electric insulators, thermal insulators; b) all three of these in 
propellant gases and trace species; and c) significant trace 
species in the peripheral elements such as brazes, insulations 
and components. The study here is strictly first order. Oxida- 
tion recession rates are based upon Phillips, (ref. 26). See 
figure 7 for a summary of these rates.

In Concepts 2 and 3 the intimate contact of the heater with 
biowaste gases, as well as the critical structural elements at 
high temperatures, suggested the use of a noble metal. The 
studies of reference 14 showed experimentally that platinum, 
while one of the lowest temperature and strength members of that 
family, must be considered because of chemistry. 

Rhodium forms a carbonyl. Iridium has a very high oxidation 
rate with even small amounts of oxygen present (ref. 26). See 
figure 7. 

Rhenium is not oxidation resistant. It does have a high 
resistance to small amounts of water vapor at high temperature. 
Unpublished test data of the authors found the erosion rate at 
2400*K to be negligible in the presence of 1% H 2 0 vapor, where 
at 2000*K, it was 5 x 10“* centimeters per hour. The higher the 
temperature above 2000°K, the more resistant it becomes to H 2 0 
vapor. 


Specific values for sublimation and corrosion life factors 
above are reported with each concept. 

Electric Heaters .- Figure 8 compares the electric resis- 
tivity of the candidate materials. Table 37 tabularizes the 
values versus temperatures. 

Thermal insulation .- The insulation systems used in the 
study were all of the porous or fibrous ceramic type. 

In the high temperature regions (above 1000°K) it can be 
shown that the effective thermal conductivity of a reasonably 
practical radiation shield configuration is no better than the 
better fibrous ceramic oxide insulations. The trade-off then in- 
volves many other factors such as having to support the shields 
without excessive thermal losses through the shielding, and in 
the case of fibrous insulation, having to handle a possible dust- 
ing problem and considering the launch environment. 

Zirconia fiber is an especially good high temperature 
insulation. It was selected for use here. Its thermal conduc- 
tivity in a vacuum values are tabulated in appendix I. 

A factor considered with fibrous insulation was the effect 
of gaseous environment. Its thermal conductivity changes from 
its value in air, argon, etc., and vacuum and was taken into 
account .

Electric insulators .- The thermal requirements of the 
electric insulators as found from the thermal analysis are very 
modest. 

For the purposes of these designs, in light of the tempera- 
ture and chemistries involved, very high purity (99.98%) alumina 
(Al = 0 3 ) is perfectly adequate. The temperatures where insulators 
are used is less than 625°K. The properties of alumina are given 
in appendix I. 

Electrothermal designers have used boron nitride for 
electric insulation because of the relative ease of machining. 
The thermal conductivity, however, of boron nitride, like beryl- 
lium oxide is almost that of a metal. For this reason, the 
design philosophy employed was not to use it.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 


The results of each of the thruster designs studied are 
presented in detail in the appendices A through F. Each stands 
as a complete, separate report of its concept. These are all or- 
ganized the same. The Table of Contents identifies, for each 
concept, the specific page of the following:

The results and discussion here synopsize the main points. 
The designs are compared and recommendations made. The concepts 
are simply summarized under Study Models. 


Biowaste Resistojets 

The results of the thermal analysis by mathematical modeling 
studies for the four biowaste designs studied are summarized for 
operation separately on carbon monoxide and on steam in tables 5a 
and 5b. The performance at the design goal heater temperature of 
1573°K, chamber pressure of 3 atmospheres and a thrust level of 
.22 Newtons (50 mlb?) are shown. 

The performance figures for Concepts 1 and 4 are shown in 
table 6 also for an advanced heater temperature of 2000 *K and 
2073*K, respectively, selected because of the unique features and 
the different heater materials of each of these designs. In 
these cases the other grain stabilized platinum components were 
limited to 1573*K resulting from this operation, the same value 
as the study goal temperature for the platinum heater. 

All of the designs presented use a separate evaporator to 
insure that vapor is supplied to the biowaste thruster. The 
thruster is charged with the inlet steam power in its performance 
assessment. The performance of the evaporator is not considered 
part of the thruster. 

Similar thermal insulation and electric insulator mounting 
standoffs are used for each concept to reduce power loss and so 
that thruster grounds are insulated from spacecraft grounds, 
respectively. This is to avoid ground loops.

In general, the few design iterations in each of the con- 
figurations that were permitted by the study effort sought to 
maximize specific impulse performance with due regard for 
reasonable overall efficiency and reliability considerations. 
The spacecraft designer must prescribe the relative importance of 
these output parameters for his mission for design guidance. 

The gas dynamic, structural, chemical corrosion, sublimation 
and deposition factors were kept within the limits of the study 
criteria during the course of configuring each concept design. 

Concept 1 .- The use of the electrically conductive ceramic, 
cubic phase stabilized zirconia, for its heating element permits 
a much higher than goal temperature of 1573*K of the study. It 
has the highest growth in specific impulse capability of the 
biowaste designs studied. It can achieve 192.5 and 269 seconds 
on carbon dioxide and steam, as shown in table 6. At the design 
goal condition. Concepts 1 , 2 and 3 have nearly the same specific 
impulse and overall efficiency values. Since the propulsion 
characteristics for the Space Station core is not performance 
driven, the design choice between these concepts would have to be 
made on other trade-off considerations. Reliability is the major 
consideration . 


24 



Zirconia has not been developed as a miniature gas heater- 
exchanger. However, its use as heater elements at high tempera- 
ture (>2000°C) in air in commercial ARTCOR research furnaces have 
greatly advanced the technology of this material since its early 
consideration for a biowaste resistojet (ref. 13). 

Electric characteristics: Figure 8 shows the marked dif- 
ference in electric characteristics of the conducting ceramic 
designs as compared to the metallic ones. Tables 5 and 6 show a 
resulting higher operating voltage than the other designs of 153 
to 173 V at operating conditions for CO* and H^O, respectively. 
The current levels are of the order of an ampere. These charac- 
teristics are most favorable for power loss reduction in trans- 
mission on the power bus of the spacecraft. A special electric 
consideration is that the ionic nature of the conducting ceramics 
require alternating current to avoid polarizing the ZrO*. This 
is essentially the driving of the negative oxygen ions to one end 
and altering the stochiometry if operation on D.C. is attempted. 
In addition, conducting ceramics, because of their negative 
electric characteristic with increasing temperature, a constant 
current type power control is required for stable operation. The 
latter eliminates any need for ballast resistors. 

Starting: Since zirconia does not conduct electricity es- 
sentially below 800 *K, it requires preheating. Only for this 
reason was the starting problem studied for Concept 1 . The 
various modes of operation were evaluated by means of transient 
studies using the computational mathematical model. These are 
presented in detail in the appendix. There it is shown that the 
time from a cold start (state 1) to design condition (state 4) is 
approximately 3 minutes. It is shown that a holding state (state 
3) at 1250°K with no flow requires only 22.6 watts of main heater 
power. Its thrust response is immediate but it is approximately 
5 seconds away from full value of specific impulse. 

Where the duty cycle is high and fast response in thrust 
cannot be readily anticipated as to schedule, the condition of 
holding at a no flow design and temperature state (state 3) is 
recommended. Power losses are low, the thrust and specific im- 
pulse response are high. 

Where firing times are long and separated by long periods of 
no thrust, the power up mode from rest (state 1) to design (state 
4 or 5) is recommended. When firing times are long and only 
separated by short inactive periods, a holding state at 1250°K 
(no propellant flow) is recommended. Overall reliability will be 
enhanced by the avoidance of heavy thermal cycling of ceramic 
materials. It is concluded with regard to starting that the 
systems engineer must ultimately make the final selection as to 
the best overall operating schedule. 


25 


Reliability by means of redundancy: Note that the inclusion 
of a preheater permits an additional powered mode (state 6) at 
1250*K as a fully redundant reliability feature of the design. 
This powered mode will produce a specific impulse of 133 seconds 
(C0 2 ) . This alone meets contractual goalsl The preheater, be- 
cause of the high temperature capability of rhenium, operating in 
the vacuum exterior to the pressure case as it is here, is 
limited in temperature only by the resultant temperature of the 
platinum pressure case. It represents a totally independent al- 
ternative means of powering Concept 1 for redundancy which could 
be from even a different power bus. 

Concept 2 .- This design (figure 1 ) is a new one based on 
novel features of a radially inverted functional design and a 
truss heater. The first feature results in the pressure case 
being its outermost member, which is the coolest of all the 
designs considered. Hence, it can be made of lower temperature 
stainless steel. The tfuss heater has high transverse strength, 
yet axial compliance dnd high electric resistance. The heater 
design does prove to be complex and Concept 3 which uses the same 
outer shell is somewhat superior in performance and easier to 
fabricate. Using radially broad regenerators is advantageous 
when cool expellant inlet gas of low thermal conductivity is 
used. This provides better thermal insulation and cooler cases 
than the traditional design order. 

Concept 3 .- This, like Concept 2, uses the radially inverted 
functional design in the biowaste configuration, but the bicoil 
heater as described in the Study Model. There are a number of 
advantages to Concept 3 besides the fact that the gas approaches 
the wall temperature very closely. This design has the highest 
specific impulse of all the biowastes at the goal temperature. 
It achieves 170.2 seconds on carbon dioxide and 240 on steam. It 
is perhaps the most thermally responsive in that the low mass 
coil is the first to heat during start up and the last to inter- 
act directly with the gas before it exits through the nozzle. 
Its overall thermal efficiency is approximately 5 percentage 
points less than Concept 1 . The reason for the efficiency dif- 
ference is primarily the difference in the axial lengths required 
of the two designs as discussed in the corresponding studies in 
the appendix. No electric insulation is used in the high tem- 
perature zones. Propellant flow deters backstreaming of any sub- 
limed metallic vapors onto electric insulators at the mount end 
which contains the power service. 

In respect to electric characteristics, the voltage of Con- 
cept 3 is the lowest of the designs studied and the current the 
highest. While the electric characteristic of the design was 
studied for voltage increase, a factor of perhaps two times that 
shown was considered the maximum. By means of pulsed mode con- 
trol operation off a 28 volt bus is possible without transforma- 
tion with a suitably designed power conditioner. 


26 



Concept 3 gives the highest specific impulse for any given 
wall temperature limit of those concepts studied. Because the 
cavity pressure surrounding the heater tube can be designed to be 
only slightly greater than within by use of its low mach number, 
a failure mode due to heater wall rupture by hoop stress is 
reduced. The design is pressure balanced internally with no ap- 
preciable creep load for all operating conditions. The thermal 
expansion compensation is inherent in the bicoil principal in 
that it is axially very compliant, yet the heater is structurally 
sturdy transversely because the coils are metallurgically bonded 
along the transverse length about every half turn at equipoten- 
tial points. Since the heater coil is surrounded by expellant, 
any small leakage is inconsequential with time. The pressure 
case is cool and can be made of less expensive materials and, in 
addition, bring high reliability to the pressure integrity of the 
design. 

Concept 4 . - The nonexposed radiant heater concept is already 
in use. The design physically separating the heat exchanger 
function from that of the ohmic heater allows the heater to be 
independently designed and a material used which need not be 
biowaste resistant. A rhenium heater can be chosen to operate at 
significantly higher temperatures. 

The power transfer link between the radiant wire heater and 
the heat exchanger pressure case is relatively fixed in value for 
a given temperature and radiant transfer heater. This power is 
mainly proportional to the heater temperature to the fourth power 
and transfer area. The lower temperature of the receiving sur- 
face is of much less influence. This somewhat limits its use as 
the variable thrust or multiexpellent design. By increasing 
chamber pressure, flow is increased. With a fixed amount of 
power, the gas temperature reduces and a noticeably lower 
specific impulse high thrust unit results. Its use as a multi- 
propellant design is difficult. A propellant with a sig- 
nificantly higher specific heat than the propellant for which it 
was designed cannot be run to achieve the same gas temperature 
for the same heater temperature limit. This is unlike a convec- 
tive design where the gas is in intimate contact with the heater, 
itself, and the temperature difference between gas and heater is 
small. Using the same size thruster housing as Concept 3 and 
same heater temperature goal of 1573°K, the goal specific impulse 
could not be achieved with the cavity in a vacuum. This means 
larger designs are required to increase the transfer surfaces and 
more heat loss surface, hence lower efficiency. The answer here 
was to improve the radiation link by offering a pressurizing in- 
ert gas in the cavity to add a parallel conduction mode and high 
emissivity surfaces to promote better radiant heat transfer 
exchange. With these the goal specific impulses can be achieved. 
With COss a specific impulse of 138 seconds was achieved with an 
efficiency of .816. In the same size design and heater tempera 
ture. Concept 3 produces 170 seconds with an efficiency of .793. 

27 


The heat exchanger is a more massive structure. It is a 
pressure vessel. The thermal mass is a factor of ten times that 
of the heater of Concept 3, the bicoil. The heat-up time tran- 
sient is substantially longer than Concept 3. Conversely, Con- 
cept 4 is less sensitive to erosion. 

In electrical characteristics the heater voltage is 18 to 
15.6 volts for COa and steam, respectively, are achieved by the 
quadcoil design. 

Hydrazine Augmenters 

Two designs, the convective and radiation type resistojet 
thruster designs, were studied by mathematical modeling their 
performance for operation on decomposed hydrazine (fully 
dissociated) with the inlet condition at 866 *K. The complete 

study reports of these are found in Appendices E and F. The per- 
formance is abstracted in table 7. The philosophies employed in 
both designs were kept comparable, consistent with appropriate- 
ness in order to insure an accurate comparison.

Concept 5 .- Based on the maximum heater goal heater tempera- 
ture of 2073*K, the specific impulse capability of Concept 5E is 
clearly superior, 317 seconds as compared to the radiative one of 
295 seconds. The maximum gas temperature in the bicoil design 
reached 2059*K, only 14 degrees from the maximum wall temperature 
limit while in the radiative one was 300 *K different because of 
the large temperature difference required by the radiative link. 
For this reason alone, Concept 5 will have a higher growth poten- 
tial for operation on hydrazine and comparable propellants such 
as ammonia, hydrogen, nitrogen and the reducing gases in general. 
The overall power efficiency is approximately 1.5 percentage 
points greater than Concept 6B because of the heater efficiency 
as radiative type design is longer. 

The voltage of the 5E design is 8.94 volts with a current of 
33.04 amperes. It is estimated that the terminal voltage of Con- 
cept 5 can be increased by a maximum factor of two by design 
changes . 

The thermal energy required to raise the heat exchanger mass 
to its design temperature during starting is relatively small, 
approximately one-tenth the radiative type. The specific impulse 
should respond faster after starting as compared with the more 
massive pressure case heat exchanger structure of Concept 6. For 
long term steady firing, this is not a factor. A heavier case of 
the latter has an advantage over the thinner surfaces of the 
bicoil heater from a long term erosion viewpoint. From a study 
of the sublimation enforced evaporation. Concept 5 meets the 
design objective of 10,000 hours. Since the bicoil is immersed 
in the expellant in the cavity, there is not a problem should 
small amounts of leakage occur. 

Concept 6 .- The performance of the nonexposed radiant heater 
type resistojet augmenter is improved by augmenting the radiant 
heat transfer link by the addition of an inert gas around the 
heater from a 278.2 seconds to 295.2. Further improvement could 
be expected with the addition of emissive surfaces on the cavity 
side of the case. The pressure case temperature, since it is 
also the heat exchanger member, is governing the maximum gas tem- 
perature and, hence, specific impulse. If anything, the pressure 
case temperature will be slightly higher than the pressure case 
of the bicoil type convective design of Concept 5. 

The favorable feature of the radiant design is the indepen- 
dence of the radiant heater element to a greater extent than in 
the convective one. Adequate radiative heater transfer surface 
area, though, must still be provided. A higher voltage, in this 
case 24.7 volts in the 6B design, is achieved with a lower cur- 
rent of 9.7 amps. The radiant design, for best performance, does 
require an additional pressurization connection of the inert gas 
to the cavity and another pressure supply. 


29 


MANUFACTURING 


The most critical elements in either the biowaste resistojet 
designs or the hydrazine augmenters must generally be supplied to 
near finished form by specialists in these fields. In the case 
of the biowaste designs, the exposed high temperature structure 
is of grain stabilized platinum, of which there are two suppliers 
(refs. 16 and 27). For pure rhenium, shaped resistojet parts may 
be obtained by the chemical vapor deposition process from a few 
suppliers in the United States. There are few suppliers of grain 
stabilized rhenium material in shaped resistojet parts. In the 
case of platinum, the high cost of the material makes material 
recovery methods important when machining final shapes. For 
this reason this is usually left to the suppliers of such 
material. The difficulty in the machining of the necessary 
shapes in rhenium causes the number of sources to be small. This 
is either done by the chemical vapor deposition method or a new 
method for grain stabilized rhenium described in reference 21 . 

Cubic phase stabilized zirconia is available from a number 
of suppliers. The combination of alumina and nickel for the 
insulator/ seal assembly was chosen because that technology has 
been well developed for the high frequency cable terminal 
industry. The two materials have similar thermal expansion 
characteristics and are, therefore, easily joined. Examples of 
such seals are given in references 4 and 5, which successfully 
passed year long life tests. The finishing adjustment of mating 
parts for brazing processes and metallurgical bonds for platinum 
to platinum may be undertaken by ordinary machining methods 
similar to those used for the machining of A-200 nickel. 

The machining of grain stabilized rhenium may be done by a 
number of techniques. The best method for finishing parts is 
grinding with tools having cutting surfaces coated with fine 
diamond abrasive particles. These tools can be obtained in al- 
most any shape including drills, core drills, cutting wheels and 
grinding wheels. Curved surfaces can be obtained by the use of 
special tools with shapes corresponding to those of the desired 
parts. A second method used is the electro discharged machining 
method (EDM), which has been quite successfully employed. 
Rhenium parts should be annealed frequently during fabrication. 
This seems to relieve many problems. They should be annealed if 
made by vapor deposition and after other operations preceding 
welding. One-half hour at a temperature of 1925*K was sufficient 
in previous work. 

The machining of zirconia is generally again by diamond tool 
grinding. The forming to final shape can be by any number of 
methods familiar to the ceramic industry depending upon the 
shape. Hot pressing, isostatic pressing, extrusion, slip 
casting, cold pressing followed by sintering. 


30 



Joining Methods 


Considerable care must be exercised in joining grain stabi- 
lized platinum components. If the joints of the materials are 
heated above the melting point, as in the fusion welding, the 
oxide dispersion is lost in the weld area. Sometimes rhodium 
rich filler metal is added to the weld pool. This usually 
provides sufficient solution hardening to the platinum interface 
to compensate for the local loss of the oxide dispersion. 
However, for this resistojet application, the use of rhodium in 
high temperature areas should be avoided because of carbonyl 
reaction during operation with C0 2 (ref. 15). 

The preferred practice is to design the components such that 
any welds are made away from any critically stresses areas. The 
preferred method for joining the grain stabilized platinum to it- 
self is the diffusion bonding technique. The diffusion bonding 
is conducted in a vacuum furnace at 1575’K for two hours. This 
requirement is well within the capabilities of most vacuum 
furnaces. Brazing and/or electron beam welding can be used in 
joining the grain stabilized platinum to itself in the lower tem- 
perature areas where several brazing techniques are available as 
well, depending upon the mating part material and joint design. 

Rhenium .- This is easily welded to itself either by the 
electron beam process or the tungsten inert gas process. With 
small parts, however, the more precise electron beam welding is 
superior. The following points should be observed for easy 
welding. The parts should be clean and free of oxidation and fit 
tightly with no gaps. It is much easier to weld parts of similar 
thickness than a thin part to a thick one. This is due to heat 
transfer considerations. Weld schedules should be determined by 
practice with sample parts, having thicknesses and geometry 
similar to the parts they represent. 

The same observations apply to electron beam welding of 
stainless steel parts and of nickel to stainless steel. 

Rhenium is readily brazed to many other metals with a braz- 
ing alloy consisting of 82% gold and 18% nickel. Other brazes 
may be applicable as well. The rhenium to stainless steel joints 
can be done by this alloy as well. This operation should be done 
in a vacuum and the heat should be applied either in a conven- 
tional vacuum furnace for five minutes at a temperature of 1240° 
to 1250°K or by the electron beam welder with the beam diffused 
slightly. In the latter method one can make pass after pass un- 
til all braze material has been melted and flown into the joint. 
This method is applicable primarily to small parts and easily ac- 
cessible joints. 


31 


SUMMARY OF RESULTS 


The use of the electrically conductive ceramic, cubic 
phased stabilized zirconia, for the heating element gives the 
highest growth potential and specific impulse of all the biowaste 
designs studied. Concept 1, using this, can achieve about 192 
and 270 seconds on carbon dioxide and steam, respectively. It 
has a high voltage alternating current operating characteristic 
that promotes low power transmission losses. A special control- 
ler is required. Because it requires a starting heater, it has a 
redundant operating mode, also, using the preheater which also 
meets the specific impulse criteria of the study of 133 seconds. 
When operating off a separate power bus, it represents poten- 
tially one of the most reliable of the designs. 

If limited to metallic heaters. Concept 3 is selected as the 
next best candidate. Concept 3 has the lowest design tempera- 
tures involved. The gas approaches its heater wall temperature 
very closely before entering the nozzle and has a fast thermal 
response. A low temperature case is used, made of ordinary 
stainless steel, which improves its reliability. The bicoil 
heater has the lowest terminal voltage. 

The radiant heater design. Concept 4, requires a rhenium 
heater or other refractory metal operating at significantly 
higher temperatures than the study guidelines, but under the 
circumstances, within the design operating conditions of the 
study for hydrazine augmenters under similar environment. The 
radiant power transfer link, however, must be pressurized in or- 
der to meet the design specific impulse minimums. An extra gas 
line is required. Loss of this gas pressure drops the specific 
impulse below the study goal. 

Hydrazine augmenters, the two designs studied were the con- 
vective and the radiative type resistojets. The convective, in 
this case, clearly had a specific impulse advantage and a growth 
advantage in that gas approaches very closely to the limiting 
heater temperature. The augmenter radiative design did not meet 
the minimum goal specific impulse of 300 seconds. Again the ter- 
minal voltage of Concept 5, the convective design, is low. That 
of Concept 6, the radiative one, is high, 24 volts. By pulsed 
mode control, both can be readily operated on 28 volts with equal 
power conditioning requirements. The convective design, again, 
is recommended.

APPENDIX A 


CONCEPT 1 -ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTING CERAMIC 
HEATER WITH EXPOSED INTERNAL FLOW 


Concept 1 is a biowaste resistojet based upon a heat ex- 
changer made with an electrically conducting ceramic. Zirconia, 
stabilized into the cubic phase, is used. The primary attraction 
of zirconia is its tolerance to the biowaste gases at higher tem- 
perature (mp 2998°K) than its nearest metallic heater counter- 
part, platinum (mp 2047°K). It is an update and reappraisal of a 
prior NASA supported technology base (circa 1971-72) reported in 
reference 14. Improvements in the design made possible since 
that time are included. It is functionally described below. 



The ceramic heater contains multiple heat exchanger passages 
in a pentagonal pattern for a short, compact final stage. At 
1573°K (1300°C), the specific electric resistivity of zirconia is 
3 compared to 5x10“® ohm-cm for platinum or 6x10° times more. 
See figure 6. This allows generous structural heater cross 
sections, less sensitive to erosion, which results in a high 
voltage - low current design of the order of 100 volts and a few 
amperes. Because zirconia is effectively an electrical insulator 
below about 1000°K, a starter heater must be provided. 

The preheater is located outside the pressure case and is 
therefore unexposed to biowaste gases and can be made of grain 
stabilized rhenium (mp 3453°K). It can be encapsulated in an 
electrically insulating support. Operation on the preheater 
alone achieves the goal specific impulse and, hence contributes 
to reliability. The expellant passes in counter flow through a 
regenerator, part of the pressure case made of platinum, before 
passing through the short, compact, essentially constant wall 
temperature ZrO a heater exchanger. The power controller stably 
operates the Zr0 3 exchanger without need of ballast resistors.

The pressure envelope is formed by the pressure case 
regenerator (-4) with its headers, the case end (-9) and the 
nozzle assembly (-1). The ceramic ohmic heater and exchanger is 
mounted within this pressurized cavity between these headers. 
The entrance end of the zirconia heater is held by an electric

insulator and mount (-8). The gas pressure in the cavity is made 
the same as the exchanger inlet by means of porting. The ex- 
changer thus has a regulated small compressive pressure across it 
be design. The fit between nozzle (-1) and exchanger (-5) is 
close to minimize gas bypass around the exchanger. The thermal 
expansion coefficients of zirconia and platinum at this joint are 
the same. This helps to maintains a close fit. 

Figure 9 shows the main power feedthrough (-13) to the exit 
electrode which is power supply ground. Not shown as being out 
of the drawing plane is a similar feedthrough (-14) connecting 
the high side of the power supply to the entrance electrode. The 
high temperature central assembly is thermally and electrically 
isolated from the thruster mount (-12), hence spacecraft, by 
three standoffs (-10). This is for thermal efficiency and 
separation of power supply ground from spacecraft ground. 

The preheater (-6) is located external to the pressure case 
and not exposed to biowaste gases. It can be constructed of 
rhenium. This permits a redundant backup operation which meets 
minimum study performance goals itself off of an independently 
powered second source which contributes to reliability. 

The propellant feed line enters the case to enter the 
regenerator at the nozzle end as a "shuttle line". The "shuttle 
line", because of its intentionally poor heat transfer design, 
enters the nozzle end cool. This entrance was chosen, as opposed 
to one at the mount end, for reasons of power efficiency and the 
desire to keep the entrance electrode higher in temperature for 
electric conduction reasons. The flow then spirals to the 
ceramic ohmic heater-exchanger entrance through the regenerator- 
pressure case (-4). There is passes through heater-exchanger (-5) 
and exits via the nozzle (-1). 


Performance 

The projected performance on the candidate propellants CO x 
and H 2 .O for the study heater temperature of 1573°K are shown in 
table 9. 

Because the zirconia heat exchanger is shown operating so 
much below its temperature capability, an advanced design point 
comparable in life to the others of the study is also presented 
in a second column at 2000 °K. Operation less than this advanced 
design then represents a contribution to reliability. 

These figures on basis of performance are superior when com- 
pared to all the other biowaste concepts of the study.

Thermal Analysis 


The heat transfer analysis of the ceramic ohmic heater ex- 
changer may be previewed in an approximate way by equations A1 
and A2 to guide the designer as to the effects of changes in the 
design parameters (ref. 14). These equations are based upon a 
number of simplifications. A constant wall temperature and gas 
properties are assumed. These do, however, provide a basis for 
roughing in the starting point configuration, for a more exact 
study by the mathematical model via a microcomputer.

The ceramic heater, because of its logarithmic decrease in 
resistivity with temperature, tends to approximate the heat 
transfer boundary condition of a constant temperature wall. The 
relatively small change in resistivity of the metallic tube 
heater, by contrast, causes a boundary condition of constant heat 
input per unit length. 

Which of these two conditions for a given maximum tempera- 
ture of the wall produces a shorter gas passage to heat a given 
mass flow to the same exit gas temperature? Comparison with the 
analysis of Concept 5 shows that the constant temperature wall 
produces a substantially shorter gas passage.

The adjustable variables seen in equation A1 are the number 
of passages, n, and exchanger length, L. The greater the number 
of passages, the less the length required for the same tempera- 
ture of the gas at exit temperature. Sixteen passages represents 
a practical upper number for a reliable state of the art in mul- 
tiple passage tube manufacture. It results in a 30 mm long ex- 
changer which is acceptable. 

Steady state analysis by generalized computational model . - 
The node diagram representing the final preliminary design choice 
is shown in figure 10. The temperature distributions are shown 
in figures 11 through 12 at 50 mlb^ for both CO* and HssO steam at 
the study design point of 1573"K (1300°C) and at an advanced con- 
dition of 2000°K (1727°C). The latter is shown as perfectly 
feasible in light of the capabilities of ZrO z material. 

The alternatives to this final selection are reviewed with 
reasons for the selections made as baseline. 

1 ) The platinum nozzle wall should be thin, not massive, to 
avoid axial heat losses. Thick walled nozzles caused the tem- 
perature of the gas at the throat to be 246 “K below the maximum 
heater temperature. The thin composite nozzles of Configuration 
D2 were 125°K by comparison. 

2) A ZrOa inner surface to the nozzle reduces the loss in 
gas temperature and to a lesser extent lowers the platinum backup 
wall structural temperature and erosion loss. 

3) With regard to the ceramic heat exchanger length, after 
the peak gas temperature axial station is reached, the n passages 
can be reduced to one to minimize the drop in gas temperature by 
propellant "shuttle" to the nozzle. This also reduces heating 
the exit electrode unnecessarily. 

4) Only one flow pass should be made through the 
regenerator-pressure case. The gas otherwise tends to retrace 
its temperature back to its near starting temperature. The 
expellant can be put into the case either at the nozzle end or 
the mount end. In the latter case a fast single tubular transfer 
is desirable as a shuttle pass to the mount end so that the gas 
entering the ceramic heater-exchanger is at its maximum tempera- 
ture from the regenerator. The single pass promotes thermal ef- 
ficiency about 3%. Regenerator entry at the nozzle end in Con- 
figuration D2 favorably keeps the rear electrode electrically 
conductive. The propellant entry to the regenerator at the 
nozzle end was also the least complex mechanically. 

5) The n gas passage diameters were the same and hence not 
optimized. The walls of the inner gas passages are 40 °C hotter 
than the outer ten. The inner 6 passages can be increased in 
diameter to increase their flow. This could adjust the heater 


39 



walls to the same maximum temperature uniformly. This would in- 
crease the net gas temperature about 15°C, but is not included in 
the results of D2 here. 

The net effect of the optimization study to arrive at Con- 
figuration D2 was to: 

1) Increase the specific impulse from 159 to 168 seconds, a 
propellant savings of 5.6%. 

2) Increase the overall thermal efficiency from 76.7% to 
82.7%, a power savings of 7.8%. 

3) Give a reduction in maximum case temperature from 746°K 
to 684°K. 

Starting cycle analysis .- Since the starting cycle has been 
often suggested as a problem for this design, a thorough tran- 
sient thermal analysis was undertaken. Such an analysis is much 
more difficult for any device than a steady state one. It was 
only undertaken in this study for Concept 1 to show that the ap- 
plication of this resistojet potentially to space station is 
readily accommodated. 

The application of resistojets to manned space stations do 
not require fast thermal response based upon the results of the 
MORL studies (ref. 6). Their long firing times for drag makeup, 
for control moment gyro desaturation, etc., represent the bulk of 
the total impulse requirement. Only small percentages of the to- 
tal impulse requirement ’/ere used for roll control where a fast 
response might be required. It is for this reason that in the 
study the unscheduled mode for fast response and specific impulse 
was included as well as the scheduled one. 

These modes were studied to provide current systems trade- 
off response data. A summary of permissible thruster operating 
states is defined in table 1 0 to study how to provide for these 
modes. Also summarized are the resulting performance figures 
determined during the analysis. 

Table 1 1 summarizes the transient operation times between 
the important states with citations to the included results in 
figures and tables. These transitions between states were 
studied as a series of solutions of temperature distributions 
through the resistojet at the intervening time intervals. The 
special transient analysis, as well as the steady state type 
analysis, was required to find the asymptotic value. The times 
cited refer to temperature conditions which are within ap- 
proximately 3% of the steady state values as a somewhat 
arbitrary, practical criteria.

It was found that delaying the start of propellant flow at 
state 1 substantially reduced the starting time. For the first 
analysis of this operating starting mode, only judgmental 
efforts, not rigorous ones, were made to improve the procedure. 
The initial start required somewhat high power from the preheater 
system because it was allowed to proceed at constant voltage. 
The initial resistance of the preheater was low. The power con- 
sumption dropped off as the resistivity of the preheater in- 
creased with temperature. The maximum preheater temperature 
limit was 1350°K. The main heater starts to conduct at ap- 
proximately 75 seconds. Flow was initiated when the main heater 
current reached approximately 60% of design condition and the 
preheater shut down. No expellant flows until 186.9 seconds. Up 
to this time, preheater power is applied at 140 volts. The main 
heater assumes full responsibility and for all practical 
purposes, full specific impulse is reached at 189 seconds. 

If the initial power level is limited to, say 400 watts 
above while the preheater itself is cool and thus low resistance, 
the start is estimated to require 60 seconds longer than that 
indicated. 

The temperature profiles through the thruster are shown in 
figures 13a through d. Figure 13 also shows the corresponding 
nodal physical positions in the thruster. The supporting tabular 
presentation of auxiliary data is found in table 1 3 for the same 
corresponding time intervals. 

Power initiation from rest state (1) to an intermediate hold 
state (2): The purpose is to place the thruster in a standby 
mode by preheater power only from which thrust and specific im- 
pulse may be obtained readily by main power initiation. The tem- 
perature distribution with time is identical with the case of 
start from rest (1) to design state (4) for the first 120 seconds 
because during this period there is no main heater power. 
Figures 14a and b describe this interval. At 180 seconds the 
difference between figure 14a of this transition and figure 13c 
for full start from rest is not too different as is seen. Figure 
14b shows the steady state condition of state 2. 

Table 13 shows preheater electric variables and power during 
this transition for the assumed algorithm of full voltage until a 
preheater limit of 1250°K is reached after which it is tempera- 
ture controlled. Other algorithms, such as an initially constant 
power limit, were not explored. 

This transition has no pressing time requirement. Its end 
state is a hold. If full operation is required during this 
transition, reversion to full start settings are simply made and 
maximum time is again 189 seconds from rest as in from state 1 to 
state 4.

Intermediate hold state (1250 ,:, k): There are two means to 
hold Concept 1 at this steady readiness state of 1250 C, K. These 
are by the preheater (state 2) or the main heater (state 3). The 
temperature distributions within Concept 1 for state 2 and 3 are 
shown in figures 14b and 15a. The important difference between 
the two states which serve the same purpose is the power 
requirement. Low power drain is the selection criteria. Case 2 
requires 80.4 watts while case 3 only 22.6 watts 1 

Case 3 is the clear choice not only on lower power but lower 
temperature of the regenerator-pressure case, a reliability 
consideration. The case holding temperature is reduced from 
1250°K to 1150°K thereby. Case 2 is simply academic as a pass- 
through state to create state 3. 

Transition from intermediate hold state (2) to design state 
(4): Table 12 shows the power flow history during the transition 
from the intermediate hold state (2) to the design state (4). In 
5 seconds the thruster is at full performance, if 2.5 seconds is 
anticipated before initiation of propellant flow. 

In the algorithm selected it is possible to consider full 
thrust immediately from this condition but with a slower than 5 
second overall response to full specific impulse. This ti*ansi- 
tion is not studied further here because of the importance of 
state 8 (full temperature, no flow) from which virtually instan- 
taneous thrust and specific impulse can be obtained for a cyclic 
mode.

Design hold state 8: The main heater may hold the thruster 
at full design temperature of 1573°K (at no flow) for 46.8 watts 
and be ready for instantaneous thrusting at full specific 
impulse! Recall that state 3 requires only 22.6 watts but is 5 
seconds from full specific impulse. See figures 15a and b. 

Conclusions with regard to starting: The systems applica- 
tions engineer must ultimately make the final selection of best 
overall operating schedules. Where the duty cycle is heavy and 
fast response and thrust cannot be readily anticipated as to 
schedule, the condition of holding at state 8, a design tempera- 
ture hold state, is recommended. Power losses are low, the 
thrust and specific impulse response are high. From MORL studies 
(ref. 6) roll control was a small total impulse requirement and 
not a driving requirement. 

Where firing times are long and separated by long periods of 
no thrust, the power-up mode from rest to design is recommended. 
Where firing times are long and only separated by short inactive 
periods, state 3 is recommended as the hold state. Power-up to 
design from this condition will take *5 seconds. Reliability 
will be enhanced by avoidance of heavy thermal cycling. 

Reliability by means of redundancy .- Note that the inclu- 
sion of a preheater permits an additional powered mode at 1250°K 
heater temperature (state 6) as a redundant liability feature of 
the design. This powered mode will produce a specific impulse of 
133 seconds (COss) and meets contractual goals. The power 
required is 166.6 W and the gas total temperature is 1001 °K! See 
figure 16 for the thermal distribution of this mode, state 6.

Gas Dynamic Analysis 

The local gas flows through the thruster were taken into ac- 
count during the thermal analysis in the mathematical computa- 
tional modeling. A summary of the parameters is shown in table 
15 for a design heater temperature of 1573°K and mass flow of 
0.131 grams per second.

The results on Ha-0 steam are similar with the pressure drop 
inconsequential . 

Note that the flow is laminar in the ceramic heater and that 
the flow passages before the nozzle are below a Mach number of 
0.10. This results in a rather low pressure drop in the design. 
This is seen to be beneficial structurally in the next section. 

The problem of the stability of the laminar compressible 
flow with friction and heat addition in parallel passages with 
equal pressure drops (the so-called nuclear rocket problem) 
(ref. 28) was investigated in reference 14. It was found to be 
stable. The type of flow stability problem can be thought of as 
one arising from the negative flow resistance characteristics of 
such a system under certain combinations of conditions. The 
stability criterion depends only on the temperature exponent of 
viscosity of the propellant gas in question and the temperature 
ratio across the heater. Analysis of Concept 1 shows it meets 
this flow stability criterion as well. 


Mechanical Design 

The structural design in reference 1 4 was found more than 
adequate, hence, is not repeated here in keeping with the broad 
investigative nature of the study. 

Chemical Corrosion, Sublimation and Deposition 

Since the zirconia heater is an oxide, it resists chemical 
reactions with the oxygen based biowaste propellants. This al- 
lows higher temperatures to be used than would be feasible with 
any metallic heaters such as stabilized platinum. It is for this 
reason that this design was presented first. The high perfor- 
mance capability of this design suggests a highly reliable design 
at the reduced temperature of 1573°K chosen contractually as 
design. 

Compatibility with Ha-0 (steam), COa: and vacuum has been ex- 
perimentally demonstrated to 1935°K for 500 hours without 
failure (ref. 13.) . 

The ceramic heater at 2000°K with a recession rate of 2x1 O'"* 
millimeters per second in a vacuum is expected to operate for 
4000 hours and about 10 times longer at a gas pressure of 3 at- 
mospheres for a 10% reduction in cross sectional area. Life 
tests in air have achieved 7000 hours without ceramic failure. 
The platinum heater element wire is expected to last 1x10^ hours 
under the same criteria with careful design of the electrodes. 

No deposition studies were undertaken within the scope of 
the investigation. 


53 


Rating 


Advantages .- (1) The heating element resists oxidation, so 
is expected to have longer life and to be able to run at higher 
temperature than would be feasible with a metallic element. 
Thus, it provides significant growth potential. Although metal 
electrodes are required, it has been found feasible to design the 
unit with lower temperature at the electrode contact locations 
for reliable operation even at advanced design (2000°K). 

(2) A zirconia element has high electrical resistivity, so 
is readily designed to operate with a high voltage and a low 
current. This permits small light leads and small lead losses. 

(3) High resistivity in the heating element also allows a 
compact lightweight thruster design with low thermal losses to be 
used. There is no need to lengthen the heater (or otherwise in- 
crease its size) to achieve an acceptable operating voltage. 

(4) A backup heater is available from the preheater provid- 
ing a redundant mode for increased reliability that can provide 
the goal specific impulse. 

Disadvantages . - (1) A zirconia heating element is noncon- 
ductive at room temperature. It requires a conventional metallic 
heater for starting. This results in a more complicated system, 
and a time delay during start-up. The metallic heater can be 
outside of the gas path, so the advantages listed above are not 
negated. 

(2) An alternating current power supply is required for the 
zirconia heating element.

APPENDIX B 


CONCEPT 2 - EXPOSED METALLIC TRUSS HEATER 
IN EXTERNAL CROSS FLOW 


This new design is based upon two novel features. These are 
the radially inverted functional design and the truss heater. 
This biowaste resistojet uses the metal-oxide grain stabilized 
platinum for the highest temperature components as contrasted to 
Concept 1 where ZrO = is used. 

The pressure case is its outermost member. The wide pas- 
sages regenerators are adjacent and interior to the pressure 
case. All thermal insulation is contained within these. It is 
radially inverted from all others here except Concept 3. The in- 
verted approach results in a pressure vessel of low temperature 
and, consequently, one of implied higher structural reliability. 
No pressure balancing considerations are required within the 
design to prevent creep of the critical inner elements. 

The truss heater here is a wire heater which is structurally 
designed for transverse strength yet axial compliance and high 
electric resistance. This design eliminates all electrical in- 
sulators from the high temperature zone. The radially broad 
regenerators, when cool expellant inlet gas of low thermal con- 
ductivity are used, provide better thermal insulation and cooler 
cases than the traditional design order. Flow splitters shown 
are used to minimize free convection during ground testing. This 
approximates the freedom from free convective heat transfer ex- 
perienced in space. 

The schematic below illustrates these above functional 
relationships .

The pressure envelope is now formed, unlike early resistojet 
designs, by the outermost member (-10). This being the coolest 
location, this case can be designed out of conventional high 
grade stainless steels. The case end (-14) insulator power 
feedthrough and the nozzle (-1) complete the pressure envelope. 
The regenerator consists of a wide annular passage passing from

the mount toward the nozzle immediately within the pressure case, 
and hence , returning in a second pass back to the zone of the 
heat exchanger inlet. All fibrous thermal insulation (-6) is 
radially contained between the regenerator and the nonpressurized 
heater chamber (-3). The truss heater (-5) is mounted within the 
heater chamber supported by its truss support (-11) and at the 
nozzle end by the heater outer support and return (-4) as shown. 

The power feed connection (high) is by means of the 
feedthrough (-19) which also serves as the rear support to the 
truss heater. The principal voltage drop occurs across the truss 
heater (-5). The return to the ground side of the power feed, 
the terminal, (-18) is primarily through the heater outer sup- 
port and return (-4) and case end (-14). The resistojet itself 
is thermally and electrically isolated from the mount (-17) by 
means of which it is mounted to the spacecraft. Note that the 
propellant feedline similarly must be electrically isolated to 
avoid ground loops. Shown is an example of such an isolation (- 
20). This function could occur at a number of sites. 

The dimensions of the outer package are summarized in the 
table that follows.

The description of the truss wire heating element is 
presented next. Its electrothermal design is discussed under 
thermal analysis. 

The heating element area is shown only in outline in figure 
17. The truss heater is designed so as to be a nonredundant 
structure. It is free to expand axially due to temperature ex- 
pansion along the thrust direction, but because of its lateral 
stability, resists movement radially within the heater cavity. 


58 



In effect, a series of elements in a family of nine electrically 
parallel systems span the inlet support to the exit. They are 
joined with each other many times during the course of the span 
in a nonredundant way such as to satisfy structural stability, 
join nodes of equal electrical potential, in a cyclic repeating 
pattern. The design, while complex in appearance, can be simply 
wound on a sacrificial mandrel which is later dissolved away. 
Following is the description of one such design. 

Geometry of the truss type heating element .- The configura- 
tion for the heating element consists of a truss with the links 
arranged at a shallow angle to the tangential. This is done to 
provide an acceptable operating voltage. It is much more rigid 
than the usual simple coil (but not bicoil) type of heater, and 
some flexibility can be advantageous as a simple means of provid- 
ing for thermal expansion without the development of excessive 
thermal stresses. 

The truss geometry can be described as a series of junction 
points arranged on an imaginary cylindrical surface and joined by 
a repeating pattern of connecting links. Each junction point in 
the center region joins six links, giving the total number needed 
to provide a rigid truss with no redundancy. The location of the 
junction points is described in the table below in cylindrical 
coordinates. All junction points are at a radius of 0.5 cm. For 
brevity, only approximately the first and last cycles are shown 
in the table to illustrate the construction. The others can be 
simply constructed from these. 

There are a total of 307 links connecting the junction 
points, including ten (five at each end) that connect to a sta- 
tionary mounting base at one end. The links are made of platinum 
wire for biowaste applications, and of rhenium wire for high tem- 
perature applications where the heater is not subjected to an 
oxidizing gas (when hydrogen or hydrazine are used as the 
propellant ) . 

The electrical current follows nine parallel paths through 
the main body of the truss. The paths are of three types as 
described below. The truss geometry and the wire diameters are 
selected in a manner that tends to keep the wire temperature 
variation the same for the nine paths. 

1 ) There are two right hand helix type paths made up of 
links that join junction points in the order listed in the above 
table. Both of these helical paths are made up of 50 links, each 
of which is 5.56 mm long by .254 mm (0.10 in.) in diameter.

Each of these paths is made up of 33 links, all of which are 
6.90 mm long by .203 mm (.008 in.) in diameter. 

3) There are four star like paths made up of longer links 
that skip alternate junction points, joining them in the order 
indicated below.

C4 : 3-7-11-15-19 87-91-95-99 

Each of these paths is made up of 24 or 25 links, all of 
which are 9.17 mm long by .203 mm (.008 in.) in diameter. 

The combination of wire length and diameter for these num- 
bers was selected to provide a uniform voltage gradient through 
the truss, as well as a uniform temperature variation. This is 
true of the ten base mounting links as well as the links in the 
main body of the truss.

Performance 


The projected performance is summarized in table 19 for the 
study propellants at the heater design temperature of 1573°K. 

The results of the dtesign study of Concept 2 show an attrac- 
tive overall efficiency of 81.5% for CO* at a specific impulse of 
164 seconds. The heat loss per unit length is less than that of 
Concept 1. However, the length of Concept 2 is 11.5 cm because 
of heat exchanger design compared to Concept 1 of 7 cm. The 
result of the overall length effect is that the shorter Concept 1 
does have a more attractive overall efficiency of 84.9% and a 
specific impulse of 167.5 seconds for CO*. 

The principal contribution of Concept 2 is the efficient in- 
verted design notion and the genesis of another truss heater, the 
bicoil, presented as Concept 3 herein.

Thermal Analysis 


The analysis consists of three substudies: 1 ) a geometric 
study of simplified regenerative passages; 2) the truss heater 
configuration; and 3) a mathematical computational model of the 
overall Concept 2 system. 

Regenerators . - The effect of the regenerative passage 
geometry on thermal losses from the housing of a resistojet are 
studied by means of a simplified model which is used to represent 
a 50 raillipound resistojet running on COz propellant. The fol- 
lowing assumptions are made to simplify the model: 

1 ) Gas properties are assumed to be independent of 
temperature. The specific heat is taken as .2681 cal/(g°K) while 
the thermal conductivity is taken as .0001141 cal/ (cm-sec-°K) . 

2) Material properties are taken as constants. The emis- 
sivity of the passage walls is taken as .16, while the emissivity 
of the outer surface of the housing is taken as .12. Two alter- 
native values were used for the thermal conductivity of the in- 
sulating material. A low value of .0001791 cal/ (cm-sec-°K) is 
used for a layer at moderate temperature in a vacuum. Otherwise, 
a high value of .0005927 cal/(cm-sec-°K) is used. 

3) Heat flows due to conduction or radiation in the axial 
direction are neglected. The only axial heat flows considered 
are those due to gas flow in the regenerative passages. 

4) The primary resistojet heater is represented by a 
central cylinder 1.4 cm in diameter at a uniform temperature of 
1573°K. The ambient temperature (and the inlet gas temperature) 
is taken as 300°K. 

5) The propellant flow rate is taken as .1316 g/sec. This 
corresponds to a specific impulse of 172.3 seconds with 188 watts 
to heat the gas. 

6 ) The heater length is taken as 5 cm which is believed to 
be representative for a "truss type" wire heating element, while 
the housing O.D. is also taken as 5 cm for most of the study. 
The latter figure appears to be a reasonable choice based on the 
present study. 

The study is conducted in two parts. The first, to gain 
insight, used a single pass of the gas through an annular 
passage, while the second utilized a second pass, at a reduced 
radius, to return the flow to the inlet end of the engine. The 
geometries of the two cases are depicted in figure 20. A 
parametric study shows estimated thermal losses with the passage 
dimensions varied in a systematic manner. 


64 




Single pass cases: In the single pass case, the insulation 
layer inside of the passage is assumed to have the higher value 
of thermal conductivity while the outer layer is assumed to have 
the lower value. Estimated losses are shown in figure 21a as a 
function of the radius ratio of the inner insulation layer and of 
the radius ratio of the regenerative gas passage. Shown is the 
case with the passage moved all the way to the outside, completely 
eliminating the outer layer of insulation. The analysis shows 
minimum losses with the passage at or near the outer wall. The 
choice of no outer insulation layer seems attractive due to its 
simplicity. A relatively thick gas passage appears desirable. 
Losses seem to be minimum when the passage radius ratio is in the 
neighborhood of .80 to .85. The flow was found to be laminar in 
the gas passages, which enhances their effectiveness in blocking 
the radial conduction of heat and makes increased passage thick- 
ness advantageous. Note that reduction of the thickness of the 
outer layer of insulation improves performance even though that 
layer was assumed to have a much more favorable value for the 
thermal conductivity. There is evidently a strong incentive to 
minimize heating of the gas in the regenerative passage so that 
the outer wall can be kept cool along its entire length. This is 
accomplished by providing a thick layer of insulation inside the 
passage. It is worth noting that when the gas enters the 
thruster in the cool condition, regenerative passages can be very 
effective in reducing the heat lost to the housing. 

Figure 21a also shows a line near the top of the page 
labeled "spiral". This line shows estimated losses for a passage 
modified to enhance convective heat transfer to the gas. Spiral 
flutes of metal join the inner and outer walls and cause the gas 
to follow a spiral path. The cases shown for spiral passages are 
all for the passage at the housing O.D. with no external 
insulation. The outer wall temperature is increased by conduc- 
tion through the flutes which helps to increase convection to the 
gas. Increased heat flow through the insulation to the gas in- 
creases the temperature drop in the insulation, which, it was 
hoped, would also reduce the outer wall temperature and external 
radiation losses. This is not the case. 

The calculations show that a flow of cool inlet gas is the 
most effective in keeping the outer wall temperature at a low 
value. Best advantage is taken of this effect by using a thick 
annular passage rather than the spiral type of passage. Rather 
large temperature differences between the inner and outer passage 
walls are obtainable when thick annular passages are used. It 
seem to be preferable to minimize convection heat transfer to the 
gas so that it will remain relatively cool along the entire 
length of the housing.

diameter ratios. 



b) Gas passage radius ratio, £ 2 

Figure 21. - Simplified parametric study of regenerative passage geometry 
study for the single pass showing effect of diameter. 





Figure 21b shows losses for a number of housing diameters. 
In all of these cases, there is no external insulation. Although 
minimum loss seems to occur with a housing diameter between 7.0 
and 10.0 cm. there is only a small penalty in performance if the 
diameter is reduced to 4.0 or 5.0 cm. Use of a 5.0 cm housing 
diameter with a passage radius ratio of 0.83 is suggested for a 
preliminary design which is analyzed in more rigorous detail. 

As the gas progresses down stream through a passage, its 
temperature increases, and it loses its ability to keep the outer 
wall cool and minimize external radiation losses. The longer the 
thruster, the more difficult the problem becomes. As length 
increases, losses increase at a rate that is more than 
proportional. The effect is illustrated in figure 22 for 
thrusters with no external insulation. It is important to mini- 
mize the heater length so that the housing can be kept relatively 
cool over its entire length. 

Two pass cases: Results for the study with two regenerative 
passes are shown in figure 23. To reduce the number of 
variables, the first pass geometry was fixed with a configuration 
that looked attractive in the single pass study. A passage 
radius ratio of 0.83 is used with no insulation layer outside of 
the first pass. The radial location of the second pass and its 
radius ratio were then varied parametrically. It shows estimated 
losses as a function of the radius ratio of the inner insulation 
layer, and the radius ratio of the second gas passage. In 
addition, two dotted lines appear on the figure. The upper one 
is for the case with no inner insulation layer, while the lower 
one has no insulation layer between the two gas passages. 
Results for the second pass are similar to those obtained for the 
single pass study. The penalty associated with eliminating the 
outer of the two insulating layers is not large. In the interest 
of simplifying the design, we tentatively select a design with a 
'single insulating layer on the inside of the gas passages. A 
radius ratio of 0.83 is suggested for the outer pass, while a 
lower value (say 0.73) appears attractive for the second pass. 

The truss heater .- In principle, it should be possible to 
design a wire heating element with an intricate array of fine 
wires in cross flow which would provide excellent heat transfer 
characteristics and would operate an an attractively high 
voltage. Although simple coil type heaters are subject to vibra- 
tion problems, it was felt that a truss type configuration could 
be used to stiffen the heater and raise its natural frequencies 
above the expected excitation frequency range. Accordingly, a 
gas heater having a fairly complex truss type wire heating ele- 
ment was designed and an analysis made to estimate its 
performance.

Although it was found possible to keep the heating element 
no larger in size than most of the other designs studied, the 
thermal analysis shows the gas temperature obtained for a given 
1573°K heater temperature is 96°C less than Concept 3 # a bicoiled 
tube type of heater. 

To minimize thermal distortion of the heating element, a 
truss configuration should be symmetrical, and the wires should 
be sized so that they all operate at about the same temperature. 
It seems to be generally true that a heater designed as a truss 
with six wires connecting to each node will not have the same 
voltage gradient (E/L) in all of the wires. As a result, the 
electrical power heating some wires will differ from the others 
and the wire temperature will be different even if the gas tem- 
perature and velocity are the same at all of the wires. A method 
is needed for choosing wire diameters that will tend to equalize 
the wire temperatures. For illustration, consider a case with 
convection the dominant heat transfer mechanism, and with radia- 
tion negligible. The heat transfer performance is estimated from 
reference 29. At the low Reynolds numbers here the Nusselt num- 
ber for flow across a cylinder is proportional to the square root 
of the Reynolds number, so:

this becomes:

An alternate case is one in which radiation from the wires 
dominates, and convective heat transfer is neglected. Overlook- 
ing variations in the shape factors and assuming constant wire 
temperatures, radiative heat transfer is taken proportional to 
the wire surface area:

Since equation (B2) differs from equation (B1), there isn't 
a simple relation expressing the desired adjustment in wire 
diameter. With Concept 2 work carried to a more detailed study 
phase, it is anticipated that wire diameters ultimately would be 
selected utilizing the computer heat balance program with its es- 
timates of gas temperature and wall temperature variation. For 
this initial study, the minimum wire diameter was taken as .02 mm 
(.008 inches), with the diameter increased for other current 
paths to a weighted average of values given by equations (B1 ) and 
(B2). The convective heat transfer expression was weighted twice 
as heavily as the other. 

Steady state modeling of the thermal system .- Steady state 
thermal analysis was undertaken by generalized computational 
model. The specific node diagram representing the Concept 2 con- 
figuration of figure 17 is shown in figure 24. The temperature 
distributions resulting from the case of the study design goal of 
50 mlb thrust at 1300°C (1573°K) heater element temperature are 
shown for both CO* and Il 2 0 (steam) in figures 25a and b, 
respectively. 

The CO;* gas temperature at nozzle entrance is 1384°K or 
189°K below maximum heater wall temperature of 1573°K. The pres- 
sure case temperature is only 633°K at the nozzle exit joint. 
The metal to ceramic (-19) seal joint is at 471 CT K, well below its 
rating of 623°K. The thermal profile shows the favorable design 
characteristic of an increasing temperature towards the nozzle. 
This keeps the thruster mount cool. This feature deters deposi- 
tion of metallic vapors on insulators at the feedthrough (-19).

As a result of the favorable thermal design, the thermal ef- 
ficiency is 90%, second only to Concept 1 , an extremely short 
design because of its ceramic heater. 

No further improvement of Concept 2 was attempted because 
Concept 3, using the same basic inverted structure, continued 
that development. 


Gas Dynamic Analysis 

The heating element is enclosed in a circular passage sized 
to produce a low gas velocity which is .3 to 3 meters/sec depend- 
ing on the propellant and the gas temperature. The corresponding 
Reynolds numbers based on a wire diameter of .2 mm (.008 inches) 
vary from 2.6 to 15.6. Referring to Hoerner (ref. 30), figure 1 
page 3-2, we see that this is well below the range of Reynolds 
numbers in which vortex streets form in the wake of a cylinder. 
Although this feature of the design reduces the convective heat 
transfer to the gas by reducing the Nusselt number, this can be 
offset by increasing the length of wire in the heater. An in- 
crease in the wire length has the added advantage of an increase 
in the operating voltage but increases the overall losses. Be- 
cause of the low gas velocities, there is no pressure drop of 
consequence.

Structural and Other Mechanical Effects 

A truss type of structure rather than a simple coil is used 
for the heating element. This increases the rigidity and the 
natural frequency of the heater. Structural problems are 
relieved because it is easier to provide mounts that will isolate 
the unit from resonant frequencies if those frequencies are high. 
It is planned to use a "complete" truss for the heater (a con- 
figuration that would be rigid if all the joints between links 

were pivots ) . 

* 

Redundant members are avoided in the structure. This is to 
avoid high thermal stresses and permanent distortion if one mem- 
ber heats up at a different rate than the others. The number of 
links (n) required for a truss with (j) joints is given by the 
relation: 


n = 3j - 6 

For example, a tetrahedron with four joints requires six 
linking members. A cube with 8 joints requires 18 linking mem- 
bers (including a brace in each of the six faces). An additional 
brace across the internal space between opposite corners would be 
redundant and could generate locked in stresses. The tension or 
compression forces in the links can be found by solving a set of 
simultaneous equations consisting of three force balance equa- 
tions (one for each coordinate) at each joint. There are, 
therefore, 3j unknowns requiring 3j linking members if the base 
mounts are counted. With more links there would not be a unique 
solution. Links required for mounting the structure to a base 
are no included in the above expression which explains the sub- 
traction of six links. 

For the center part of the heating element, it is planned to 
use a repeating pattern with all of the joints using the same 
configuration. Since each link connects two joints, there are a 
total of six links connected to each joint. Departures from this 
rule occur at the two ends where the deduction of six links are 
made without disturbing the repeating pattern used elsewhere. 

A twist in the truss geometry is used to stagger the wires 
in the gas flow path and to help equalize wire diameters. 

Truss geometries considered are described as right and left 
hand helical patterns wound on a mandrel having a polygon shaped 
cross section. The wires intersect at the polygon corners where 
they are welded together to form the joints. Internal welded 
joints are avoided. Slots of saw cuts in the mandrel are needed 
for winding the deep star-like patterns. The mandrel may be 
either a straight or a twisted polygon cylinder. It must be 
destructible so that it can be removed when the part is finished. 


74 


Since the heating element is axially complient, no special 
flexibility is required in its mounting to allow for thermal ex- 
pansion in the axial direction. 

Examples .- Two figures are attached to illustrate the type 
of truss geometries that can be developed based on a polygon 
shaped mandrel. Both examples use a mandrel with a pentagon 
cross section shape. The first sketch depicts a case with no 
twist in the mandrel. The top view shows the pentagon shaped 
outer windings and the star shaped inner windings in an end view, 
while the lower sketch shows a developed view of the pentagon 
surface. It is not to scale. 

The star shaped pattern is wound first. There are four of 
these windings in a form that advances like a right-hand helix, 
but each link advances only one unit axially; while the second is 
a triple left-hand helix advancing one and a half units for each 
link. The difference between the right and left hand polygon 
helix patterns is necessary in order to get all of the wires to 
intersect at the same points when there are an odd number of 
sides on the polygon. There are a total of nine paths for 
electrical current in parallel. The vertical lines in the lower 
view represent the corners of the polygon, and are not part of 
the truss. Wires in the axial direction would be too low in 
resistance. 

The second sketch shows the same basic geometry with a twist 
introduced in the mandrel to stagger the wire pattern. A second 
effect is that the left-hand helix is lengthened which helps to 
increase its resistance. This is advantageous because it has a 
steeper advance angle and is therefore exposed to a higher volt- 
age gradient than the right-hand elements. In the configuration 
selected, a balance was achieved between the star windings and 
the left-hand windings. Both of these can use a wire diameter of 
.2 mm. However, the other pentagon shaped windings still have a 
lower voltage gradient and need a somewhat larger wire diameter 
(about .010 inches) to provide their share of the heating. 


Chemical 

There are no chemical problems in the design in the choice 
of materials used. Concept 3 gives a quantified level of an- 
ticipated oxidation and sublimation recession losses which are 
very low and typical for the inverted biowaste thrusters. 


75 


Rating 


Advantages .- (1) The heater is structurally rigid 
transversely yet axially accommodating for expansion 
compensation. 

(2) Closely spaced staggered wires provide a relatively ef- 
fective heat transfer to the gas compared to radiative designs. 

(3) No electric insulators are required in the hot zone. 

(4) The single heater required can run with either AC or a 
DC power supply. 

Disadvantages . - (1 ) With biowaste propellants, the tem- 
perature is limited to the level that can be tolerated by 
platinum wire. This is expected to be about 1300°C as opposed to 
values of at least 2000 °C that appear to be attainable with a 
zirconia heater. 

(2) If subjected to a high velocity gas flow, wire elements 
can shed a vortex street accompanied by an oscillating force ac- 
ting on the wire. A structural problem results if a resonant 
condition occurs. 

(3) Usually heater wire coil designs have low natural 
frequencies leading to the possibility of resonant vibrations in- 
duced by launch conditions or by the operation of other equipment 
while in orbit.

APPENDIX C 


CONCEPT 3 - EXPOSED METALLIC BICOIL 
TUBULAR HEATER IN INTERNAL FLOW 


This new design is based upon two novel features. The 
radially inverted design of Concept 2, described previously in 
detail, is used identically. The bicoil, an integrated tubular 
ohmic heater and gas heat exchanger, is introduced. It is made of 
metal-oxide grain stabilized platinum. 

The figure below summarizes the conceptual relationship of 
elements. The favorable features of a low temperature outer 
pressure case with its radially broad regenerator is retained 
from Concept 2. No electric insulation is used in the high tem- 
perature zones. Propellant flow deters backstreaming of any sub- 
limed metallic vapors onto electric insulators. 

The bicoil consists of two coils of precisely the same 
tubular heating length and cross-sectional diameter coiled in op- 
posite rotation, one closely fitting within the other. The pres- 
sure drop and flow of each passage and the resistance heating 
length are the same. The cross-over points are at the same volt- 
age potential and the two coils are physically bonded to one 
another there. As a result, the bicoil design is found by stress 
analysis to be stable and transversely rigid yet accommodating 
for axial thermal expansion compensation. The operating voltage 
of the bicoil can be designed relatively high. The temperature 
of the gas flowing through the tubes of the bicoil approaches 
here to within 63°C of that of the wall at exit.

struction of Concept 3 is identical to 2 except for the geometry

platinum.

One of the novel features of this concept is the bicoil, an 
integral tubular ohmic heater and gas exchanger (-5). The bicoil 
is mounted within the heater chamber (-3). Its exit is supported 
by member (-4) which also serves as an electric terminal and gas 
plenum feeding the nozzle. The bicoil at the entrance end is 
supported by its terminal and support (-11).

The ground side of the 

power 

line is 

connected to 

the ter 


minal (-18) which connects to the case end (-14). Current passes 
through the gas exit terminal support (-4) to the bicoil ohmic 
heater and gas exchanger to the entrance terminal and support 
(-11). The circuit is completed through the power feed through 
(-19) to the high side of the power line. 

The expellant feed line enters the thruster through an insu- 
lated fitting (-21) at the case end (-14) and into the parallel 
pass annular regenerators. Exiting from the regenerator it en- 
ters the heater cavity (-3) at the station of the bicoil 
entrance. The gas can only exit the thruster nozzle through the 
twin passages of the bicoil, and hence the nozzle. Since the 
heater is immersed in the expellant gases, low pressure 
differentials, hence low stresses across the wall, are involved 
with careful optimal heater design. 

The features of the bicoil are described in detail in Con- 
cept 5 where it is used in a hydrazine augmenter.

Concept 3, the bicoil, the notion for which comes as a 
result of the studies of Concept 2, has the highest specific im- 
pulse of the biowaste concepts at the 1 573.2 ,, K heater condition. 
For COz, this is 170.2 seconds, but a slightly lower overall ef- 
ficiency than Concept 1 of 79.3%. The reason for the latter is 
the higher gas temperatures generated of 1510.3°K as compared to 
1468. 4°K for Concept 1. The key point for Concept 3 is the 
closeness to which the bicoil heater can raise the gas tempera- 
ture at its exit to its own design heater temperature, a dif- 
ference of only 63“C. The Concept 2 difference is 159°C and Con- 
cept 1 is 104. 6*C. 


Thermal analysis 

The heat transfer analysis of an ohmically heated tube as a 
heat exchanger can be approximated by means of the following 
equations to see the general effect of the design parameters. 
These equations are highly simplified. A constant wall heat 


81 


flux, q w , boundary condition, entrance conditions ignored, and 
constant physical properties of the gas and wall are assumed. 
The wall of the simple model was considered adiabatic. 

The more exact study by means of the mathematical model is 
presented in the section that follows this which includes vari- 
able gas and wall properties with temperature and local heat 
transfer conditions taken into account. 

The cases considered were laminar. The exchanger exit or 
maximum temperature point was fully developed thermally, hence 
the Nusselt's number, Nu® 

Nu® = hd = constant = 4.364 (Cl) 

k 

where Nu® is the so called asymptotic or infinity solution. 
Values of thermal conductivity, k, and viscosity, u, used in the 
study are presented under Propellants. The diameter is d. 

From the local convective heating equation 

(^w) lac.i — h(T w — T a ) Ti d ( C2 ) 

at any location, x, along L, and 

(qj.v. = Q ( C3 ) 

L 

where Q is the total heat input and L the tube length. 

From equations (Cl), (C2), and (C3) and the approximate 

analysis assumptions of constant physical properties, any point 
along L including the exit 

Q = q„L = Nu®kn((Tw)^ - (Tg)*)L (C4) 

The total heat to the gas, Q, is also given by 

Q = m Cp((Tg)* - (Tg), ) (C5) 

The ((Tw)^ - (Tg),) of equation C4 is the excess temperature 
of the wall over that required of the gas. For a given required 

total heat input to the gas, Q, a shorter tube length, L, 

requires higher wall excess temperature penalty or conversely 
lowers the gas temperature attained because of maximum wall tem- 
perature limits. 


82 


Radius, centimeters 


Equations C4 and C5 show the basis for the assertion that 
two tubes in parallel, each with one half m, sharing the heating 
requirement, reduces the temperature difference between wall and 
gas to one half compared to a single tube of the same length. 
This is one additional reason for the bicoil design presented 
here. Another is the lateral structural integrity introduced by 
the two integrated counter rotation coils. Note that the tube 
diameter in laminar flow drops out of the equation. The only 
size restriction is one of minimizing pressure drop and prevent- 
ing choking. 

Setting an acceptable design temperature difference defines 
a gas path length. This is the starting point for the more 
refined analysis to follow. 

Mathematical computational analysis . - The node diagram for 
Concept 3 is shown in figure 27. The resultant temperature dis- 
tribution for COa; and Ha-O are shown in figures 28a and b, taking 
into account variable properties. 

The expellant gas temperature increases in almost a linear 
manner with length as does the coil wall temperature as expected 
by the previous simple analysis. The gas more closely approaches 
at exchanger exit the wall temperature than any of the other 
designs studied or 63 °C and 54 °C for C0 3 and H a 0, respectively. 
The gas temperature drops 24°C and 17°C, respectively, to the

plenum in being shuttled to the nozzle plenum. The maximum wall 
temperature of the heater occurs over a very limited region near 
the exit. This allows some ameliorating design considerations in 
this region only if required, such as wall thickening, to promote 
a longer life design without serious compromise of performance. 
It was not required here in this design. 

The attraction of the bicoil is that the tubes heat the ex- 
iting gas to near maximum heater structure temperature and in a 
rapidly responsive way during starting. This is important if 
short firing cycles are required. 

The temperatures of the metal to ceramic seal at the power 
feedthrough are 560 °K versus a 623 °K steady state permitted by 
the the manufacturers. The analysis is made under the conserva- 
tive assumption of no temperature sinking by the power connector 
cable, hence a slightly longer design than required. 

The pressure case is 600 o K maximum at the nozzle exit joint 
permitting contemporary metalurgical joints by brazing using con- 
temporary structural case materials. This latter fact is felt to 
be the major contribution of the inverted design rather than any 
major efficiency advantage. 


Gas Dynamic Analysis 

A summary of the parameters is shown in table 23 for a 
design heater temperature of 1573°K and a mass flow of .1319 
grams per second of COa as representative. The results for H^O 
steam are similar.

The static 

pressure within 

pressure 

case cavity is 51 


psia. The critical flows within the bicoil are treated 

everywhere as laminar. The favorably low mach number of the 


85 


design in the heat exchanger promotes a relatively low pressure 
drop. Further, the static pressure at the bicoil exit is only 
slightly suppressed below the total pressure. This reduces the 
wall delta pressure to 8.4 psia, and hence, hoop stress at this 
critical section. 


Mechanical Design 

Pressure envelope .- The pressure envelope is now the outer- 
most member because of the inverted design. Its temperature 
ranges from 592°K maximum at its outer radius to 682°K at nozzle 
junction. The thickness chosen for this pressure shell is not 
consequential to the thermal design. Ordinary nickel chrome 
steel is adequate. Its structural design is not critical. 

For instance, wall thickness of 1.25 mm (.050 in.) for an 
outside diameter of 5 cm would develop a stress of 11.6 MPa (1680 
psi). The 10,000 hour life data for just 3% chromium steel at 
810»K (1000°F) taken for margin is 48.3 MPa (7000 psi). The ex- 
act low cost material has yet to be selected. 

The balance of the design is static pressure balanced within 
the pressure envelope. The bicoil is the only member to be con- 
sidered for stress review here. The applicability of the metal 
to ceramic seal is treated in the corresponding section of Con- 
cept 5. It is not further discussed here. It is not a problem. 

Heating element .- The bicoil heater is critical near its 
exit where the temperature is the maximum value for the thruster 
of 1573°K. The pressure across the tube wall from the gas 
dynamic study is the difference between the cavity of 51.8 psia 
less the internal static pressure of 43.3 psia at the maximum 
wall temperature point of 8.5 psia difference in pressure. The 
hoop stress, o, is pD/2t giving a value of 255 KPa (37 psi) where 
the mean diameter is .044 inches and the thickness, t, is .005 
inches. The stress rupture endurance from the 10,000 hour grain 
stabilized design line is 5.8 MPa (842 psi). 

The structural integrity of the bicoil heater under the max- 
imum expected operating conditions warranted more detailed ex- 
planation since the concept is new. It was studied under Concept 
5, herein, by means of a finite structural analysis program. 

Based upon the results of these analyses, it is concluded 
that the bicoil design provides a very stable, strong, yet 
flexible, component which is capable of withstanding the loads 
produced by the operating environment. The results of the 
analysis indicated that the load factor is safe against buckling. 
The resistance of the bicoil to side deflections is very impres- 
sive in light of its axial flexibility. 


86 



The bicoil was found to exert negligible reaction loads on 
the components to which it is attached, particularly the hermetic 
seal. 


Chemical Corrosion, Sublimation and Deposition 

If there would be a most critical surface, it would be at 
the exit of the bicoil tubes because: 

1) Its temperature is the highest, 1573°K. 

2) The sweeping velocity is the maximum, 90 m/s. 

3) The wall is the thinnest, 1.25 mm. 

From figure 6 a sublimation loss in a vacuum is computed to be 
.007 mm in 10,000 hours, a trivial amount, and the 3 atmospheres 
suppressing pressure effect makes it even more so or by about a 
reducing factor of 10 -! *. 

Oxidation effects on the high temperature zone above may be 
estimated from figure 7 for air. A static loss of .014 mm in a 
year is of no serious concern from the surface. This is .02% to- 
tal thickness loss in a year. Confirming tubular experimental 
measurements in CO* are also in order since in this case it is 
only two orders of magnitude from being a factor. This is par- 
ticularly true for COa effects below. 

The results of an earlier study with biowaste resistojets 
(ref. 15) discovered experimentally that carbonyls which form 
from COas gas are a factor with the rhodium used early as an 
otherwise favorable alloying metal for platinum. As a practical 
matter platinum was recommended for such applications in such 
forms either as pure platinum, thoriated platinum or platinum 
palladium. Experimental verification of these for the operating 
time requirement was not undertaken. 

Based upon these recommendations, the choice of grain stabi- 
lized platinum is made as qualified for this application from a 
chemical resistance viewpoint. 


Rating 

Advantages . - 1) The gas approaches the wall temperature 
very closely, therefore, the highest specific impulse for given 
wall temperature limit of those concepts studied. 

2) Because the pressure surrounding the tube can be made by 
design only slightly greater than within it, the failure mode due 
to heater wall stress rupture is reduced. 


87 


3) The design is pressure balanced internally with no ap- 
preciable creep load for all operating conditions. 

4) Thermal expansion compensation is inherent in the bicoil 
principle. 

5) The heater is structurally sturdy transversely because 
the coils are metallurgically bonded along the transverse length 
about every half turn at equipotential points. 

6) Any coil leak is not catastrophic. There is not any 
propellant lost. Any specific impulse degradation is minimal. 

7) The pressure case is cool and can be made of cheaper 
materials . 

Disadvantages . - 1 ) High current, low voltage, or 29.71 am- 

peres and 6.83 volts (CO*). This voltage value can be increased 
perhaps 2 to 3 times with refined bicoil design. 

2) The unit is longer than Concept 1, and hence, has a 
slightly lower heater efficiency n,-, of .88 than the .93 for Con- 
cept 1 at the 1 573°K wall temperature design point. 


88 



APPENDIX D 


CONCEPT 4 - NONEXPOSED RADIANT HEATER 
WITH FLOW IN THE SURROUNDING CASE PASSAGE - (BIOWASTE) 


Concept 4, the last design studied, utilized Concept 6 with 
a simple transmutation of the high temperature materials to ones 
which could be exposed to the oxidizing biowaste gas. This is 
done by substituting grain stabilized platinum for rhenium. The 
separate heater itself remains grain stabilized rhenium with its 
same temperature capability as used in Concept 6. This section 
treats only those things of Concept 6 which must be changed to 
accommodate biowaste and the different resultant performance. 
The figure below illustrates the concept schematically. 

The design physically separates the heat exchanger function 
from that of the ohmic heater. Used as a biowaste resistojet, 
the heat exchanger may be made of grain stabilized platinum of 
thickness to insure its structural integrity. It is a favorable 
application of the concept in that a rhenium heater operates at 
significantly higher temperatures than grain stabilized platinum. 

Several variations are presented. These are the unpres- 
surized and pressurized heater designs. The detailed heat trans- 
fer results of each are shown. The performance of the pres- 
surized cavity is shown as a significant improvement with a 
second variation of high emissivity surface incorporation in the 
radiation heat transfer link as making a notable further 
improvement .

Note that the heater assembly forward connector and mount 
(-4) penetrates to the gas passage. This terminal is to be made 
of two pieces. That interfacing the gas surface, the nozzle 
plenum will be grain stabilized platinum. That at the heater 
side will be made of platinum/rhodium as it is not exposed to the 
gas, as the latter enjoys a significant advantage over that of 
grain stabilized platinum for use in the cavity at the interface. 


Performance 

The projected performance is summarized for a number of con- 
figurational variations and operating temperatures for the study 
propellants in the following tables. This was necessary as the 
unpressurized cavity case did not meet projected performance at 
1 573°K. 

Table 25 shows the projected performance on CO* and 
separately H*0 (steam) at the goal heater element temperature of 
1573°K specified for the biowaste resistojets. Since the heater 
element was divorced from the biowaste exposure, the case of the 
heater element temperature for the augmenters such as in Concept 
6 of 2073°K was also studied and is presented in table 25. This 
increase in heater element temperature will bring the basic 
design within the goal performance. 

Pressurizing the heater cavity separately with nitrogen en- 
hances the heat transfer by the addition of the convective heat 
transfer mode for the same heater element temperature. Table 26 
shows that the specific impulse is increased from 92.6 seconds to 
117 seconds projected with pressurization. This is still less 
than the contractual goal of 130 and 200 seconds, respectively 
for CO* and H*0. Increasing the heater element in conjunction 
with pressurization provides a further specific impulse 
enhancement . 

Table 27 shows the effect of adding a high emissivity sur- 
face to the inside of the pressure case to promote heat transfer 
reception radiantly from the heater as well as from nitrogen 
pressurization. It is seen that this will permit operation above 
the contractual goal for CO* of 130 seconds for the 1573*K heater 
case, the only case studied, to 138 seconds. By enhancing the 
performance further with a heater temperature increase above the 
goal temperature to 2073*K, a specific impulse of 179 seconds can 
be achieved. 

The performances projected here are under space vacuum 
conditions. In the similar discussion under Concept 6, it is 
cautioned that test cell pressures to simulate this operational 
performance should be less than 1 0 microns in order to simulate 
free molecule heat transfer in the cavity (like a Dewar or vacuum 
bottle) for the case of the unpressurized cavity. Otherwise 


92 



performance measured under continuum conditions would be 
measured. This would be like those of Configuration 4D, a pres- 
surized cavity. This would introduce serious over-estimation of 
the propulsive performance to be expected in space.

Thermal Analysis 


The thermal analysis using the mathematical computational 
method uses the same node diagram as for Concept 6. The methods 
are the same. Only the methods and materials are different. 

The results of the parametric study are best presented in 
figures 30 through 34. 

Configuration 4C which employs a vacuum cavity with radia- 
tion directly to the grain stabilized rhenium surface, shown in 
figure 30 for the case of COa at the maximum heater temperature 
of 1573°K. The striking feature is the extremely large tempera- 
ture difference between the wire heater and the resultant gas 
temperature. Radiant heat transfer is poorer at low 
temperatures; the effect being T“ related. Figures 32a and b 
show the effect of increasing this temperature to the allowable 
temperature allowed in the hydrazine augmenter such as Concept 6. 
The enhancement of gas temperature is significant even though the 
temperature between wire heater and gas is still very large. The 
goal specific impulses are met in this way at the price of heater 
temperature. Note that no grain stabilized platinum materials 
exceed the 1573°K specification. 

Concept 4D employs a nitrogen immersant gas in the cavity 
with a metal to ceramic seal and a separate pressurization system 
to the cavity. The temperature distributions shown in figures 
32a and b where both 1573°K and 2073°K heater element temperature 
improve the temperature of the gas over that of the vacuum case 
in each instance. However, a temperature of 2073°K is still 
required to achieve goal performance of the study. 

Concept 4F is a pressurized cavity with an inner surface of 
the grain stabilized platinum being enhanced as to emissivity by 
a metal oxide coating of alumina. Figure 34 shows the gas tem- 
peratures much more closely approach the heater wire temperature 
of all the cases studied for both the 1573°K heater element case 
where specified goal performance of the contract were met. 

Note in all cases that the hermetically insulated 
feedthrough is at or above critical temperatures specified by the 
manufacturer. However, the thermal model conservatively assumed 
there would be no thermal sinking of the terminal by the power 
feed cable. When this factor is introduced, these values fall 
within the 623°K specification or below as shown in later studies 
but not shown here.

Gas Dynamic Analysis 


The summary of parameters shown in Concept 6 are generally 
representative of the fluid flow parameters here. The Mach num- 
bers are low. The pressure drops are low. The flow is laminar. 
For brevity, they are omitted. 


Mechanical Design 

Pressure envelope .- As in Concept 6, the critical stress 
region and maximum temperature of the pressure case is as the 
hemispherical end where the nozzle joins it. Its stress is about 
2.1 MPa (300 psi) also. The temperature is now 960 °K. The 
stress rupture endurance for 10,000 hours for the grain stabi- 
lized platinum design line projected is 5.8 MPa (842 psi), cer- 
tainly an adequate factor of safety. The design choice here, of 
course, is Configuration 4F. The other remarks relative to 
mechanical design of Concept 6 are applicable here. 


Chemical Corrosion, Sublimation and Deposition 

Because of the robust character of the Concept 4 design, and 
the maximum temperatures of the gas passages for 4F at a heater 
element temperature of 1573“K, no serious problems due to sub- 
limation or oxidation, erosion are anticipated. 


Rating 

The pros and cons of the radiation type resistojet are 
similar to Concept 6, differing only in the numerical magnitude. 
An additional advantage listed for Concept 4 over that shown in 
Concept 6 is that the performances projected here which can be 
equally applicable to a type 6 design is that emissive surfaces 
can lower the heater element temperature required to meet goal 
performance. It was the only case where goal performance was met 
at 1573°K for this type design. 

Advantages .- 1 ) Higher voltages than the integral convec- 
tive designs or 1 8 volts for Concept 4F as compared to 6.83 for 
Concept 3. While higher voltages can be incorporated in the con- 
vective design, it is with more struggle. The reason is that the 
radiant electrical heater and gas heater exchanger designs are 
more independent in these functions than an integral heater - 
convective heat exchanger. 

2) The heater exchanger of Concept 4 is more massive than 
that of the direct convective Concept 3. Hence, it is less sen- 
sitive to erosion. 


1 01 



Disadvantages . - 1 ) Radiant designs produce lower specific 
impulse for the same maximum heater temperature. The maximum 
specific impulse for Concept 3 is 170.2 and 138 seconds for Con- 
cept 4F, both on C0 2 for the same heater element temperature. 

2) The thermal mass of Concept 4 gas exchanger is 10 times 
more than that of the Concept 3 convective exchanger and there- 
fore less specific impulse responsive on short firings. 

3) The radiant heater type design must be specifically 
sized with regard to power required for a specific propellant. 
It is more closely a fixed power thruster. Higher specific heat 
propellants operate at lower gas temperatures and specific im- 
pulse than possible with a convective design under the same tem- 
perature maximum heater limits. The latter convective designs 
operate closely at the same gas temperature, the combined heater 
element exchanger more closely matching the power requirement 
needs to do this. 


102 



APPENDIX E 


CONCEPT 5 - EXPOSED METALLIC BICOIL 
HEATER WITH INTERNAL FLOW 


Concept 5, like Concept 3 presented earlier as a biowaste 
resistojet, uses the bicoil configuration as an integrated 
tubular ohmic heater and gas heat exchanger for a hydrazine 
augmenter. The philosophy of the design is to achieve the lowest 
material temperature operation for the goal specific impulse, 
that is the required gas temperature at the nozzle. This 
promotes reliability and longer life. 

Primarily because of the high temperature inlet gases from 
the decomposition chamber of at least 866 °K if the ammonia were 
fully dissociated, and higher if not, a high temperature central 
pressure case design is used. This is unlike Concept 3 which has 
a cool inlet gas. The reason for this choice was that a higher 
heater thermal efficiency was found compared to that with use of 
the external type pressure case of Concept 3. 

All high temperature parts are fabricated of grain stabi- 
lized rhenium. No electric insulation is used in the high tem- 
perature zones. Propellant flow deters backstreaming of any sub- 
limed metallic vapors onto the metal to ceramic seal. 

The bicoil consists of two coils of precisely the same 
tubular heating length and cross-sectional diameter coiled in op- 
posite rotation, one closely fitting within the other. The pres- 
sure drop and flow of each passage and the resistance heating 
length are the same. The cross-over points are at the same volt- 
age potential and the two coils are physically bonded to one 
another there. As a result the bicoil design is found by stress 
analysis to be stable and transversely rigid yet accommodating to 
axial thermal expansion compensation.

Figure 35. - Concept 5, a hydrazine augmenter with exposed metallic bicoil heater 
with internal flow. 



The key feature of this concept is the bicoil, an integral 
tubular ohmic heater and gas exchanger (-5). The bicoil is 
mounted within the pressure case (-3). Its exit is supported by 
member (-4) which also serves as an electric terminal and gas 
plenum feeding the nozzle. The bicoil at the entrance end is 
supported by its terminal and support (-8). 

The bicoil heater geometry is tabulated below. This bicoil 
uses two rhenium tubes each of 26.91 inches of running, active 
length. The tube outside diameter is 1.24 mm (0.049 in.) and the 
inner is 0.99 mm (0.039 in.).

The hermetic envelope of the pressure case (-3) is completed 
by the power feedthrough and hermetic seal (-13) and the nozzle 
(-1). A parallel concentric pass regenerator (-7) in 
counterflow, located at the radial position shown, reduces the 
radial heat loss. It is supported by by the regenerator support 
(-15) and by the three transfer lines to the case. 

The inner thruster assembly is thermally and electrically 
stood off from the mount by means of the three (-11) assemblies. 
The power terminals (-13) and (-4) accept the spacecraft cable 
connectors. The thruster is designed to be mounted to the 
spacecraft at three points by the equally spaced attachment holes 
on the mount. 

Two level fibrous thermal insulation systems are shown. The 
inner, higher temperature material is zirconia and the outer is 
Min-K 2000. The containing canister (-19) completes the system. 

The ground side of the power line is connected to the ter- 
minal (14) which connects to the pressure case (-3) via its con- 
nector (-15) and entrance section (-10). Current passes through 
the gas exit terminal support (-4) to the bicoil ohmic heater and 
gas exchanger to the entrance terminal and support ( -8 ) . The 
circuit is completed through the power feedthrough (-13) to the 
high side of the power line. A variation of the bicoil is 
capable of being made a 28 volt design, but is not presented 
here. 


106 



The expellant feed line enters the thruster at the nozzle 
end of the parallel pass regenerator (-7). Three lines exiting 
from the regenerator enter the pressure case (-3) at the station 
of the bicoil entrance. The gas can only exit the thruster 
nozzle through the twin passages of the bicoil. 


Performance 

The projected performance of the bicoil convective type 
hydrazine augmenters in the successive iterative design are shown 
in table 30 for a heater temperature of 2073°K. The thermal per- 
formance is based upon the analysis discussed in the next 
section. The nozzle is the optimal model as discussed earlier. 
The geometry of the nozzle shown, while believed close to 
optimal, is only a generalized one so as to indicate position in 
the configuration.

Configuration 5E is the overall choice for this type design 
for the cases studied. Its principal difference from 5D is that 
it is simpler to build than 5D because of the propellant entry 
into the nozzle end of the regenerator. It has a lower pressure 
case temperature and is expected to be of higher reliability and 
of longer life. 

The evolutionary steps in reaching 5E from the initial 5 are 
discussed in the thermal analysis. 

Its attraction is that the tubes heat the exiting gas to 
within 50 °C of its maximum structure temperature and in a rapidly 
responsive way during starting. Since the heater is immersed in 
the expellant gases, low pressure differentials, hence low 
stresses across the wall, are involved. 


Thermal Analysis 

In the analysis of Concept 3, which introduced the bicoil 
ohmic heater and exchanger, a simplified heat transfer equation 
was presented for the boundary condition of constant heat flux at 
the wall. This was based upon constant physical properties of 
the gas and wall. The heat transferred to the gas, Q,in laminar 
flow in a single heated tube of length, L, was shown as 

Q = Nu®kn [ ( Tw, f - (Tg)*]L (C4) 

Since the asymptotic Nusselt number is a constant, for 
laminar flow in a tube, the temperature difference is inversely 
proportional to the length of the tubular heater and independent 
of its flow diameter, d. 

The length of the heat exchanger tube is made axially short 
by dividing the flow and heat transfer into two tubes, coiling 
them in opposite rotation coaxially to make a rugged, short com- 
pact structure as described. 

Analysis by the generalized mathematical computational 
model: The node diagram for the final design choice of Concept 5 
which is Configuration E, is shown in figure 36b. The tempera- 
ture distribution is shown for the design condition of a heater 
temperature of 2073°K for hydrazine at 50 millipounds thrust. 

The gas products from the hydrazine decomposition chamber 
are taken as fully reacted. The resultant inlet temperature to 
the augmenter is taken to be 886. 5°K for the purposes of the 
analysis. This is the coolest transfer temperature condition be- 
tween the separate decomposition chamber and augmenter stages, 
hence has least interstage heat loss potential.

This represents a different design choice than for the non- 
augmented monopropellant hydrazine thruster. An intermediate 
degree of NH,, decomposition for non-augmented designs is 
generally employed. 

The effect of degree of dissociation of the inlet gas on 
augmenter thermal performance wasn't studied here. Only the com- 
plete dissociation case is treated. It is the easiest to analyze 
because the gas composition is specified and no finite chemical 
kinetic considerations are involved within the augmenter. 

Experience with resistojets operating on ammonia has shown 
(ref. 4) that, at the design temperatures here, the gas is fully 
dissociated at the throat of the nozzle. In a hydrazine augmen- 
ter thruster full dissociation (x=1 ) of the NH^ at the nozzle 
throat may be expected as well because of the high temperature 
created there. 

The electric power required is essentially independent of 
degree of dissociation of the inlet gas providing the gas tem- 
perature shown is not degraded due to the loss.. 

The energy to dissociate the ammonia further, to its equi- 
librium state, is contained thermally within the gas. Only the 
time to complete the reaction is missing. No further electric 
energy is required. 

The design philosophy chosen for the first stage decomposi- 
tion chamber is full reaction resulting in the lowest temperature 
for one stage coupling. The condition at the nozzle throat of 
the augmenter would be full decomposition regardless of the inlet 
gas state. Only the temperature distribution within the thruster 
would be different. The overall power input would be the same. 

A series of iterative designs were undertaken. The alterna- 
tives considered in making the final selection are reviewed. 

The exact geometry of Concept 3, with the substitution of 
rhenium for platinum and identified as Concept 5, was thermally 
analyzed by means of its existing node diagram and found to have 
attractive performance in that the maximum augmented gas tempera- 
ture of the decomposed hydrazine of 2060°K is close to the limit- 
ing heater wall temperature prescribed for the design of 2073°K. 
The thermal efficiency is low, however, - less than 60%. 

Concept 3 was described as an inverted design earlier. By 
inverted is meant the radial order of components as previously 
described. Because hydrogen has such an outstanding thermal con- 
ductivity as compared to the biowaste gases, the use of the wide 
regenerator passages typical of Concept 3 with decomposed 
hydrazine resulted in high radial losses. Further, the insula- 
tion is immersed in the expellant gas as the pressure case in 


110 



this design is the exterior member. The thermal conductivity of 
the insulation is increased greatly. While this value is not 
serious for the lower temperature inlet biowaste gas, it cer- 
tainly is for ones rich in a hydrogen constituent at high inlet 
temperatures such as an augmenter. 

Further, from reference 31 it was verified that the 
hydrazine readily chemically attacks zirconia, the high tempera- 
ture material used for thermal insulation which further negates 
the use of the inverted design here. 

The net effect of this was to return to the philosophy of an 
inner pressure case and exterior thermal insulation in a vacuum 
for decomposed hydrazine as is shown in the balance of the Con- 
cept 5 configurations presented here. 

In a series of design iterations Concept 5E evolved as shown 
in figure 35. The considerations in arriving at this design are 
described as follows: 

1 ) Because the inlet gas is hot, extra care must be exer- 
cised in designing an acceptable cool mount end where the power 
feedthrough is located. The inlet gases cannot be used to cool 
this region as they are already above the maximum allowable metal 
to ceramic seal temperature (-13) of 623 °K. Careful thermal dam- 
ming is required in the entrance section of the case. Short in- 
let sections can be achieved with due regard to the fact that the 
power feed terminal clamp provides a thermal sink. Comparing the 
terminal temperature without and with this sink results in a tem- 
perature decrease from 856°K to 583°K. Only 12 additional watts 
loss are required to affect this protection of the metal to 
ceramic seal joint, meaning a reduction in heater efficiency of 
only 0.8% for this assurance. 

2) The effect of the use of a regenerator in otherwise 
identical cases is compared in table 30 for Configuration 5B with 
regenerator against 5A without. The regenerator is thermally 
more efficient, giving a net *1 % increase in overall efficiency 
and a cooler pressure case by 23 °C. 

3) The propellant feed inlet to the regenerator, being lo- 
cated at the nozzle or mount end, is found to be inconsequential 
with regard to heater efficiency. The nozzle end configuration 
was selected for simplicity of design and is shown in figure 35. 

4) The finally selected Concept 5E is 2.5 cm shorter than 
the initial Configuration 5A, shown on the same table, which has 
a significantly improved efficiency. Overall length reduction 
has much more benefit than including a regenerator. A lower 
heater voltage results by the reduction. This voltage decrease 


111 


can be offset by increasing the coil and pressure case diameter, 
but is not shown here. 

5) It is found that the heat exchanger design and ohmic 
heater design considerations are reasonably independent in that 
the bicoil is immersed in the pressure cavity and is not itself 
under any serious pressure vessel design constraint. A higher 
voltage design could readily be achieved. It is not shown here. 

The scaled drawing of Concept 5E is shown in figure 35 which 
is modeled for the mathematical computational model in figure 
36b. The thermal profiles at design are shown in figure 36a. 
The design has a favorable temperature profile with mount at 
643°K maximum and the power feedthrough ceramic seal at 583°I<, 
increasing in temperature to the maximum heater temperature just 
before the nozzle throat. The gas temperature follows this same 

trend, closely approaching the heater wall temperature to within 
13°K and leaving the throat about 66°K below the maximum heater 
wall temperature. Only a small segment of the thruster, the 
heater bicoil hot end, is operated at the temperature limits. 
Because of the higher resistivity coefficient with temperature of 
rhenium, the heater tube walls can even be made thicker in this 
region for further reliability. It satisfies the life require- 
ment of >10,000 hours with uniform wall thickness. Since the 
heater is immersed in the expellant gases, sublimation is 
suppressed. Chances of metallic vapors migrating to the seal 
area against the general flow are minimized in the design. 

Conclusions with regard to starting .- The specific impulse 
response of the Concept 5 design is expected to be high in that 
the heating element mass of the bicoil is small. The gas tempera- 
ture is primarily influenced by this element since it is the last 
heat transfer surface seen. There is little time for much ther- 
mal loss to the nozzle. The specific impulse will approach its 
steady state value quickly as compared to Concept 6, described 
following, which must have its pressure case heated as well to 
reach this value which takes approximately 10 times longer. 

Reliability . - Because of the small pressure drop across the 
bicoil walls, any long term leakage of the bicoil merely allows 
small flows into the exchanger from a zone already at very high 
temperature. This leakage can only escape through the nozzle and 
is ohmically heated in the process, not compromising the 
thruster's performance significantly. Since two heating elements 
are involved, the bicoils, a complete severance of one of the 
heater tubes does not shut down the thruster. The heat exchanger 
has great structural integrity laterally and the wall cross sec- 
tions are generous compared to a wire type design, hence should 
be more reliable than the latter.

The static pressure 

within pressure case cavity 

is 59 


psia. The critical flows within the augmenter are everywhere 
laminar. The favorably low mach number of the design in the heat 
exchanger promotes a relatively low pressure drop. Further, the 
static pressure at the bicoil exit is only slightly suppressed 
below the total pressure. This reduces the wall delta pressure, 
and, hence, stress at this critical section. 


Mechanical Design 

Pressure envelope .- The critical stress region is at the 
hemispherical end of the pressure case where the nozzle 
penetrates it. Using the area replacement rule of the ASME pres- 
sure vessel code for this penetration (ref. 32), the hemispheri- 
cal thin shell equation is used. The membrane stress given by 
PR/2t is 2.05 MPa (297 psi) based upon the pressure p within the 
case of .4 MPa (59.0 psia) and a radius of curvature, R of 7.6 mm 
(.30 inches) with a wall, t = .08 mm (.030 inches). There the 
temperature is 1758°K from the thermal analysis. 

The stress rupture endurance capability based on the 10,000 
hour rhenium design line is projected to be 26.5 MPa (3,845 psi). 

In figure 35 the balance of the envelope is seen from the 
thermal analysis to decrease in temperature toward the hermetic 
power feedthrough. As a result, the wall thicknesses are tapered 


113 


thinner to reduce the axial heat conduction and are still able to 
provide generous structural allowance primarily because of the 
lower temperatures. The feedthrough, because of its metal to 
ceramic construction, is a critical member reviewed below. 

Metal to ceramic seal .- The power feedthrough shown is a 
metal to ceramic seal very much like that demonstrated in ex- 
tended resistojet life tests of 8,000 hours on NH 3 at 2 atmos- 
pheres nozzle pressures without failure (ref. 5). This type 
design, as reviewed for use by its manufacturer, is suitable for 
use at the 3 atmosphere condition under a continuous rating of 
350°C ( 623°K) . 

Heating Element .- The bicoil heater is critical near its 
exit where the temperature is the maximum value for the thruster 
of 2073°K. The pressure across the tube wall from the gas 
dynamic study is the difference between the cavity of .4 MPa 
(59.0 psia) less the internal static pressure at the maximum wall 
temperature point of .3 MPa (43.2 psia) or .1 MPa (15.8 psi). 
The hoop stress, is pD/2t giving a value of .48 MPa (69.5 psi) 
where the mean diameter is 1.1 mm (.044 inches) and the 
thickness, t, is .1 mm (.005 inches). The stress rupture en- 

durance from the 10,000 hour rhenium design line is 12.4 MPa 
(1802 psi). 

The structural integrity of the bicoil heater under the max- 
imum expected operating conditions warrant more detailed explana- 
tion since the concept is new. 

The bicoil is seen to be constrained at each end by its 
mounts. Under the thermal profile these mounting points move 
away from each other due to the thermal expansion of the pressure 
envelope. However, the thermal expansion of the bicoil between 
these two points is greater putting it into compression. Of par- 
ticular interest is whether the coil buckles sideways and pos- 
sibly comes into electrical contact with the insulated side walls 
of the enclosure. 

An over design operating condition of twice the mass flow 
and a temperature of 2600°K was analyzed by the ANSYS (1) finite 
element model computer program. Based upon the results of these 
analyses, it is concluded that the bicoil design provides a very 
stable, strong, yet flexible, component which is capable of 
withstanding the loads produced by the operating environment. 
The results of the analysis indicated that the load factor 
against buckling is 475. The resistance of the bicoil to side 
deflections is very impressive in light of its axial flexibility. 
The low stresses of 3.1 MPa (450 psi) developed in the coils at 
this over design operating condition should result in a high 
tolerance to thermal cycling and good component reliability at 
design. 


114 


The bicoil was found to exert negligible reaction loads on 
the components to which it is attached, particularly the hermetic 
seal . 


Chemical Corrosion, Sublimation and Deposition 

Chemical . - Operation on decomposed hydrazine exposes the 
rhenium primarily to hydrogen, ammonia and nitrogen. All of 
these represent no problem. The 8000 hour resistojet life tests 
(ref. 5) on ammonia exposed rhenium to the same species. 

Hydrazine contains other trace compounds from its manufac- 
ture and small amounts of water are added for stabilization. The 
particulates are not believed to be a problem. Extensive bench 
tests on simulated sample systems are ultimately required. 
Rhenium's resistance to water vapor is the best of all of the 
refractory metals (ref. 33). The long term effect of water on 
rhenium, while favorable, needs to be more thoroughly evaluated. 
Very high temperature tests at 2400 °K with rhenium and 1% water 
vapor would not pose a serious loss mechanism. Lower 
temperatures, however, might and should be verified by further 
experimental testing for extended periods and temperature range 
in bench tests. Hydrazine propellant with minimum water content 
of the order of .1% and/or an erosion rate less than 2.5x10" "* 
(lO- -7 inches) per hour would be required. Values greater than 
this might represent a problem over 10,000 hours on the thin 
bicoil heater wall. 

Sublimation . - A maximum sublimation rate occurs on the 
pressure case exterior at its high temperature hemispherical end 
where it is also subjected to vacuum. The temperature there from 
the thermal analysis is 1758°K. The estimated erosion rate is 
10 -11 inches per hour and inconsequential. 

With regard to the heating element at 2073 °K, an erosion is 
estimated. By means of reference 23, where the influence of sub- 
limation and the combined effects of pressure and a main gas 
velocity over the surface, the following loss rate is estimated 
within the tube. The velocity from the gas dynamics analysis is 
450 m/s (1480 feet per second) and the pressure is .3 MPa (44.09 
psia). From the data presented by Zima (ref. 23), the total ero- 
sion for 10,000 hours is 1.42 picometers (5.6 x 10"" 2 ' inches) on 


the interior of 
sequence on the

Since 

the general

flow 

is from the 


entrance into the cavity towards the nozzle at increasing 
temperature, back-streaming of metallic vapors is not 
anticipated. The life test of reference 5 experienced minimal 
deposition of rhenium in the nozzle throat at these same tempera- 
ture levels. 


Rating 


The benefits of the bicoil enumerated under the discussion 
of Concept 3 apply also to Concept 5. The major differences be- 
tween the two designs are the use of biowaste and hydrazine 
resistant materials, respectively, and the inverted versus normal 
radial order configuration. 

Advantages .- 1 ) The gas approaches the limiting wall tem- 
perature very closely, therefore, is the highest specific impulse 
augmenter design of the study. 

2) Because the bicoil is immersed in its own gas, the pres- 
sure drop, hence stress, across the wall is low compared to a 
coil acting as its own pressure vessel and sublimation is less. 

3) The design requires no pressure balancing internally to 
avoid creep. 

4) The bicoil design relieves differential thermal expan- 
sion stresses by ready axial compression by readily compressing 
axially at a low spring constant. 

5) The heater is structurally sturdy and stable from buc- 
kling transversely because the coils are metallurgically bonded 
along the transverse length about every half turn at equipoten- 
tial points. 

6) Any pinhole leak in the coil is not catastrophic. There 
is not any propellant lost. Any specific impulse degradation is 
minimal . 

Disadvantages . - 1) It is naturally higher current - lower 
voltage design of 29.1 amperes and 10.1 volts than Concept 6. 
Some increase can be safely included if this is serious. 

2) The thinner walled heat exchanger tube is more sensitive 
to any long term erosion attack.

APPENDIX F 


CONCEPT 6 - NONEXPOSED RADIANT HEATER WITH FLOW 
IN SURROUNDING CASE SPIRAL PASSAGE - (HYDRAZINE) 


Concept 6 physically separates the heat exchanger function 
from that of the ohmic heater. The heater and exchanger may thus 
be each made of different materials, each favorable to its own 
design. The figure below illustrates the concept schematically. 
Because of the decoupling of the designs, the voltage of the 
heater may be made higher and the walls of the gas exchanger 
thicker than if the design were an integral one. The design here 
as a hydrazine augmenter has all high temperature parts fabri- 
cated of the same material, grain stabilized rhenium. 

A unique feature of the design here is the use of a sturdy 
quad coil, described herein, to give more reliability against 
touching and electrical continuity in the event of breakage for 
increased reliability. A variation from that of the original 
design (ref. 31 ) is introduced. The detailed results in perfor- 
mance through use of the pressurized cavity are shown compared to 
the original.

The key features of this concept are the radiant wire heater 
within the central cavity, separated from but surrounded by an 
annular spiral heat exchanger to capture the heat in the gas as 
it moves to the nozzle. The heater is mounted within the pres- 
sure case (-3) supported by the feedthrough hermetic seal at the 
mount end, similarly to Concept 5. The hermetic seal may be 
either of the double terminal type or the single one with the 
power return utilizing the case itself. The former has the ad- 
vantage of isolating the rest of the system from the power 
source; the latter, simplicity and possibly reliability. The 
latter is shown. The heat exchanger - pressure case is double 
walled and the flow is down a thin annular passage or a spiral 
passage as modeled here. 

The thruster assembly is shown thermally and electrically 
stood off from the mount by means of the three (-11) assemblies. 
The power terminals (-13) and (-4) accept the spacecraft cable 
connectors using the single hermetic seal terminal approach. The 
thruster is designed to be mounted to the spacecraft at three 
points by equally spaced attachment holes to the mount as shown. 
The thermal analysis presented did not utilize the thermal stand- 
offs from the mount. 

The power ground side of the power supply line is connected 
to the terminal (-14) where it connects to the case. The circuit 
is completed through the power feed-through to the high side of 
the power line. 

The expellant feed line enters the thruster at the nozzle 
end of the concentric counterflow regenerator (-7). Three lines 
exiting from the regenerator enter the pressure case at the 
beginning of the wire wound central heater, again passing toward 
the nozzle and the annular heat exchanger, hence out the central 
nozzle. 

The heater geometry consists of four parallel electric coils 
made of rhenium wire .36 mm (.014 in.) in diameter. Two coils 
are clockwise, the other two counterclockwise wound. Like the 
bicoil, this quadcoil is bonded at the crossover points. These 
points are at the same electric potential on each wire by the 
principle of symmetry. The pitch diameter of the set is 1 0 mm. 
The overall axial length is 47 mm. 

The exchanger consists of spiral passages for the model. 
The cross section of the flow passage is 1.5 mm x 1.5 mm. The 
pitch is 2.5 mm. The pitch diameter is 16.7 mm and the axial 
length is 56.5 mm.

Performance 


The projected performance of the radiant heater type 
hydrazine augmenters studied are shown in table 33 for heating 
element temperature of 2073°K. Two type designs were considered. 
The first operates the heater in a vacuum cavity; the second in a 
hermetically sealed cavity with a suppressant gas. The purpose 
of the latter is to provide an additional heat transfer mode con- 
duction to that of the radiation and to supply a suppressing ef- 
fect on heating element sublimation. The latter requires a her- 
metic seal. The performance is based upon the thermal analysis 
of the next section and that of the nozzle that was discussed 
earlier. The design with the suppressant gas achieves a higher 
specific impulse because it is able to achieve a higher gas tem- 
perature through better coupling. The life and reliability of 
the heating element is enhanced. The question of a hermetic seal 
is a complexity but has been successfully tested (ref. 5). The 
overall efficiency of the design with the suppressant gas is 2.7 
points less, expectedly, because of the higher temperature (and 
specific impulse) performance.

The performance with a high emissivity coating on the inte- 
rior of the heater cavity wall was not evaluated for hydrazine 
operation. Concept 4, the biowaste equivalent of Concept 6, the 
last to be evaluated, did determine the benefits of emissivity 
enhanced walls. The effect was found significant. 


Thermal Analysis 

Analysis by the generalized mathematical computational 
model; the node diagram for Concept 6 which may be utilized for 
Configuration A or B is shown in figure 38. The resultant tem- 
perature distributions for the study are shown for the heater 
design condition of 2073°K for hydrazine at nominally 50 mil- 
lipounds thrust. Because the resultant gas temperature was lower 
than that anticipated, the mass flow initially selected for the 
run was less. The actual thrust level check as shown on the per- 
formance table is for a 43 to 46 millipounds class engine because 
of this. 

As with Concept 5, the same inlet assumptions were used for 
the decomposed hydrazine, specifically that of fully decomposed 
hydrazine with an inlet temperature of 866 a K. 

Configuration A assumes strictly radiative heat transfer 
from the central cavity to the heat exchanger in order to avoid 
the use of the metal to ceramic seal. This configuration is cur- 
rently used to avoid the deposition problems which could cause 
short circuits. Figure 39a shows the resultant temperature 
distribution. Note that the gas temperature is 1513°K, ap- 
proximately 557°C lower than the heater temperature. 

This analysis recognizes that the free molecule conductive 
transfer is essentially zero under applicable space conditions. 
Yet to simulate this condition in a test cell, a cell pressure of 
approximately 10 microns Hg is required! If a pressure much 
greater than this is used, which unfortunately has been the case, 
specific impulses erroneously high will be reported. These 
values will not be realized in space by the actual Configuration 
A. The results obtained under these conditions will be those of 
Configuration B presented below. 

Configuration B, which employs a metal to ceramic seal and 
nitrogen gas for sublimation suppression and heat transfer en- 
hancement to improve the outlet temperature to be realized in 
space. See figure 39b. The gas temperature at the nozzle is 
1 727°K resulting in an improvement in specific impulse as a 
result from 278 to 298 seconds with the same heater temperature. 
Because of the higher temperature, the heater efficiency is ap- 
proximately 1 percentage point less than that of A for the same 
maximum heater wall temperature. The temperature difference for 
B is 347°K below heater temperature.

Figure 38. - Thermal node diagram used in Concept 6. 


The temperature distribution and results here are based upon 
the heat exchanger geometry and heater configuration described by 
figure 36. The thermal nodal model, figure 38, is rec- 
tilinearized for convenience. The the actual hardware repre- 
sented is believed closely approximated. 

Because the flow is laminar, a straight annular exchanger 
could have been used equally well to the one used here. A spiral 
design was suggested by reference 31 . 

In examining, in a preliminary way, other gases, such as 
hydrogen, with this same type geometry, lower gas temperatures 
resulted. The configuration tends to be a constant power output 
device because of its independent heater. Gases with high 
specific heats, such as hydrogen, in the same design do not 
achieve as high a temperature. Putting it another way, the 
thruster has to be designed for each propellant and is not as 
universal a thruster with regard to multipropellant usage as is a 
convective design. It does not work the propellants to the same 
gas temperature for a given heater temperature. 

Starting .- The relative mass of the heat exchanger of Con- 
cept 6 as compared to the tubular bicoil exchanger of Concept 5 
is larger by a factor of over 10. This could have implications 
on short term firing attitude control applications as differen- 
tiated from long term drag makeup functions.

The nitrogen gas pressure in the heater cavity is taken as 3 
atmospheres in Configuration B. The flow is laminar. The low 
mach number chosen for the heat exchanger promotes a low pressure 
drop. 


Mechanical Design 

Pressure envelope .- The critical stress region and maximum 
temperature of the pressure case (-3) is in the hemispherical end 
where the nozzle joins it. Like Concept 5, its stress is about 
about 2.07 MPa (300 psi). The temperature is now 1655°K. The 
stress rupture endurance for 10,000 hours from the rhenium design 
line is 33.9 MPa (4925 psi), an adequate factor of safety. 

The heater has been designed as a quadcoil (four parallel 
heater wires - two CW and two CCW) for transverse stability. A 
single terminal feedthrough is used. Little stress is induced in 
thermal expansion adjustments under temperature conditions either 
within itself or its attached hermetic seal. 

The hermetic seal is of the same design as Concept 5. 


125 


Chemical Corrosion, Sublimation and Deposition 


Chemical .- The chemical exposure as discussed under Concept 
5 possesses the same problems, if any, with the trace con- 
taminants in hydrazine. The one notable difference may be the 
water in the hydrazine. The more robust heat exchanger of the 
radiant design is more insensitive to erosion caused possibly by 
heavy water vapor content in the 10,000 hours than the bicoil 
heater. The latter will definitely require the special grades of 
hydrazine low water content which are available, such as the so- 
called Viking grade.

Sublimation: The maximum evaporation rate occurs on the 
hemispherical end where temperature is 1655°K. The estimated 
surface erosion rate is 5 x 10~ l3: inches per hour or 5 x 10 - ® 
inches total in 10,000 hours, or inconsequential. The .014 inch 
diameter heating element wire is at 2073°K is expected to sublime 
2 x 10 - ° inches, an inconsequential amount in a vacuum. 

The suppressing effect of the nitrogen on sublimation is 
desirable to prevent subsequent deposition in insulators. This 
is a serious problem as there is no sweeping gas flow toward the 
high temperature zone around the heater and away from the her- 
metic seal. A serious alternative would be having elected a her- 
metic cavity to introduce a small leakage flow from thruster in- 
let through the heater cavity out a small orifice at the nozzle 
chamber to perform this function of sweeping vapors. The better 
heat transfer capabilities of the decomposed hydrazine compared 
to nitrogen (Configuration B suppressant gas) for instance, would 
further increase the specific impulse. 


Rating 

The pros and cons of the radiation type augmenter such as 
Concept 6 are described here. These are essentially the same as 
those of its biowaste resistojet version. Concept 4. The two 
thrusters, geometrically identical, differ primarily in materials 
of construction, propellants and operating temperatures. 


126 



Advantages . - 1 ) Higher voltages are possible than with in- 
tegral convective ones, or 24.7 versus 8.9 volts for Concept 5E. 
The reason is that the radiant electric heater and gas heat ex- 
changer designs are more independent than are these functions in 
an integral heater - convective heat exchanger one. 

2) The heat exchanger of Concept 6 is more massive by a 
factor of ten that of the direct convective Concept 5, hence, is 
less sensitive to erosion due to any abnormal water level content 
in the hydrazine. 

Disadvantages . - 1 ) Radiant designs produce lower specific 
impulse for the same maximum heater temperature. The maximum 
specific impulse for 6B is 295 seconds and 317 seconds for 5E. 
The integral heater - convective exchanger (bicoil) design was 
overall power efficiency, of .737 versus .722 for the radiative. 

2) The thermal mass of the Concept 6 gas exchanger (32,400 
joules) is ten times more than that of the Concept 5 convective 
exchanger (3390 joules) and, therefore, is less responsive in 
specific impulse on short firings. 

3) The radiant heater must be specifically sized with 
regard to power required by a specific propellant. It has a nar- 
row range. In this regard, it is less general purpose for 
various compatible propellants and thrust levels with a given 
propellant.

APPENDIX H 


BASIS OF MATHEMATICAL COMPUTATIONAL MODEL 
By L . Barker 


An IBM P.C. running a compiled BASIC was used to model the 
resistojet. The compiler uses up to 128 K bytes of memory and 
then requires about 1 92K to run. This permitted a node model 
with about 500 to 600 nodes. Because the total program was too 
large to be run at once, the BASIC chain command was used to 
combine two or three subprograms. 


The Model 

The model basis for the thermal analysis is a generalized 
system of orthogonal elements in cylindrical coordinates. The 
elements dimensions are dr, rd© and dz and are considered finite. 
The model is treated as axisymmetric. The elements, called nodes 
here, are treated as a matrix and are numbered with the first 
index, I, radially outward, and the second index, J, axially 
positive toward the nozzle. 

A specific thruster is studied by assigning dimensional 
specifiers to the corners of the elements (nodes) so as to repre- 
sent the geometry. This shaping gives a physical character to 
the model approximating the physical description of the thruster. 
See figures 35 and 36b for example. The material identifiers of 
each element are next assigned, which allows access to the needed 
material properties subroutine banks as required, e.g., electri- 
cal conductivity with temperature, eraissivity, etc. The 
properties are summarized in Appendix I. The various heat trans- 
fer linkages between the various adjacent elements are embodied 
in the program and are activated as required to model the 
specific thruster. Heat transfer procedures for treating nonad- 
jacent nodes and nonasymmetric components are provided on an in- 
dividual basis. The net heat flow into an element can be deter- 
mined for its assumed temperature and that of its adjacent 
elements. When the net heat flux into each node is zero, the 
equilibrium temperature throughout the model is found. The 
method for determining this temperature distribution is next 
described. 


The Method 

To solve for a steady-state temperature distribution, the 
detailed procedure outlined in figure 38 was used. In summary, 
heat flows between all nodes are calculated using assumed values 
for temperatures and then are summed for each node. If the sums 
are not sufficiently small, the temperatures are adjusted and the 


129 


calculations repeated. The systematic temperature correction 
used is a fraction (usually .7) of the following expression: 

N 

-* q.j 

j«i 

AT< a 

N 3^i j 

Z 

j*1 9T< 

where j = the heat flow into node i from node j . 

There is a test for convergence. This section requires that 
the heat balance error be no more than 0.1 watt for any node and 
that the maximum heater temperature at any station differs from 
the prescribed values by no more than 0.1 *K. If the conditions 
for convergence are met, the procedure leaves the main loop and 
jumps to the printout section, and if not, the iterative process 
continues . 

In the next approximation equation for temperatures above, 
it has been found that the fraction (.7 used here) must be less 
than unity to stabilize the convergence process. Too high a 
value can result in increasing errors of alternate sign, while 
too low a value will reduce the rate of convergence. 

When the temperatures have converged, values of heat flows 
and temperatures are printed out and the temperatures are plotted 
on a dot matrix printer. For a transient solution, the above ap- 
proach is used except instead of using the above temperature 
correction, mass and specific heat data for each node are used 
with a maximum allowable time interval to adjust temperatures. 

The models used for various heat flow mechanisms follow. 

Conduction 

The equation used is the Fourier equation: 

9T 

q = -kA 

9X 

Heat flow towards increasing x is positive. In the program the 
opposite sign is used. 

For a given qeometry one can assume that q is a constant and 
that A is a function of x.

16. Abstract 


A generalized modeling program was adapted in BASIC on a 
personal computer to compare the performance of four types of 
biowaste resistojets and two types of hydrazine augmenters. 

Analyzed biowaste design types were: 1 ) an electrically 
conductive ceramic heater-exchanger of zirconia; 2) a truss 
heater of platinum in cross flow; 3) an immersed bicoiled tubular 
heater-exchanger; and 4) a nonexposed, refractory metal, radiant 
heater in a central cavity within a heat exchanger case. Con- 
cepts 2 and 3 are designed to have an efficient, stainless steel 
outer pressure case. The hydrazine design types are: 5) an im- 
mersed bicoil heater exchanger and 6) a nonexposed radiant heater 
now with a refractory metal case. 

The ceramic biowaste resistojet has the highest specific im- 
pulse growth potential at 2000°K of 192.5 (CO*) and 269 s (Ha-o). 
The bicoil produces the highest augmenter temperature of 1994°K 
for a 2073°K heater giving 317 s at .73 overall efficiency. 

Detailed temperature profiles of each of the designs are 
shown. The scaled layout drawings of each are presented with 
recommended materials and fabrication methods.
