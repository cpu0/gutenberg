INTRODUCTION 



This Validation Summary Report *tVSR) describes the extent to which a 
specific Ada compiler conforms to the Ada Standard, ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A. 
This report explains all technical terms used within it and thoroughly 

reports the results of_testing this compiler using the Ada Compiler 

Validation Capability« (ACVC)An Ada compiler must be implemented 
according to the Ada Standard, and any implementation-dependent features 
must conform to the requirements of the Ada Standard. The Ada Standard 
must be implemented in its entirety, and nothing can be implemented that is 
no t in the Standard. , 

Even though all validated Ada compilers conform to the Ada Standard, it 
must be understood that some differences do exist between implementations. 
The Ada Standard permits some implementation dependencies—for example, the 
maximum length of identifiers or the maximum values of integer types. 
Other differences between compilers result from the characteristics oi 
particular operating systems, hardware, or implementation strategies. All 
the dependencies observed during the process of testing this compiler are 
given in this report. 

The information in this report is derived from the test results produced 
during validation testing. The validation process includes submitting a 
suite of standardized tests, the ACVC, as inputs to an Ada compiler and 
evaluating the results. The purpose of validating is to ensure conformity 
cf the compiler to the Ada Standard by testing that the compiler properly 
implements legal language constructs and that it identifies and rejects 
illegal language constructs. The testing also identifies behavior that is 
implementation-dependent but is permitted by the Ada Standard. Six classes 
of tests are used. These tests are designed to perform checks at compile 
time, at link time, and during execution.

INTRODUCTION 


1.1 PURPOSE OF THIS VALIDATION SUMMARY REPORT 


This VSR documents the results of the validation testing performed on an 
Ada compiler. Testing was carried out for the following purposes: 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs supported by the 
compiler that do not conform to the Ada Standard 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs not supported by 
the compiler but required by the Ada Standard 

. To determine that the implementation-dependent behavior is allowed 
by the Ada Standard 

Testing of this compiler was conducted by SofTech, Inc. under the 
direction of th* AVF according to procedures established by the Ada Joint 
Program Office and administered by the Ada Validation Organization (AVO). 
On-site testing was completed 20 April 1989 at San Diego CA.

The computer for which a compiler generates cod.». 

A program that checks a compiler's conformity regarding a 
particular feature or a combination of features to the Ada 
Standard. In the context of this report, the term is used to 
designate a single test, which may comprise one or more 
files. 

An ACVC test found to be incorrect and not used to check 
conformity to the Ada Standard. A test may be incorrect 
because it has an invalid test objective, fails to meet its 
test objective, or contains illegal or erroneous use of the 
language. 


1.5 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conformity lu the Ada Standard is measured using the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains both legal and illegal Ada programs structured into six test 
classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies 
the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable, 
and special program units are used to report their results during 
execution. Class B tests are expected to produce compilation errors. 
Class L tests are expected to produce compilation or link errors because of 
the way in which a program library is used at link time. 

Class A tests ensure the successful compilation of legal Ada programs with 
certain language constructs which cannot be verified at compile time. 
There are no explicit program components in a Class A test to check 
semantics. For example, a Class A test checks that reserved words of 
another language (other than those already reserved in the Ada language) 
are not treated as reserved words by an Ada compiler. A Class A test is 
passed if no errors are detected at compile time and the program executes 
to produce a PASSED message. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that every syntax or 
semantic error in the test is detected. A Class B test is passed if every 


1-4 





INTRODUCTION 


illegal construct that it contains is detected by the compiler. 

Class C tests check the run time system to ensure that legal Ada programs 
can be correctly compiled and executed. Each Class C test is self-checking 
and produces a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result when it is executed. 

Class D tests check the compilation and execution capacities of a compiler. 
Since there are no capacity requirements placed on a compiler by the Ada 
Standard for some parameters—for example, the number of identifiers 
permitted in a compilation or the number of units in a library—a compiler 
may refuse to compile a Class D test and still be a conforming compiler. 
Therefore, if a Class D test fails to compile because the capacity of the 
compiler is exceeded, the test is classified as inapplicable. If a Class D 
test compiles successfully, it is self-checking and produces a PASSED or 
FAILED message during execution. 

Class E tests are expected to execute successfully and check 
implementation-dependent options and resolutions of ambiguities in the Ada 
Standard. Each Class E test is self-checking and produces a NOT 
APPLICABLE, PASSED, or FAILED message when it is compiled and executed. 
However, the Ada Standard permits an implementation to reject programs 
containing some features addressed by Class E tests during compilation. 
Therefore, a Class E test is passed by a compiler if it is compiled 
successfully and executes to produce a PASSED message, or if it is rejected 
by the compiler for an allowable reason. 

Class L tests check that incomplete or illegal Ada programs involving 
multiple, separately compiled units are detected and not allowed to 
execute. Class L tests are compiled separately and execution is attempted. 
A Class L test passes if it is rejected at link time—that is, an attempt 
to execute the main program must generate an error message before any 
declarations in the main program or any units referenced by the main 
program are elaborated. In some cases, an implementation may legitimately 
detect errors during compilation of the test. 

Two library units, the package REPORT and the procedure CHECK_FILE, support 
the self-checking features of the executable tests. The package REPORT 
provides the mechanism by which executable tests report PASSED, FAILED, or 
NOT APPLICABLE results. It also provides a set of identity functions used 
to defeat some compiler optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that 
would circumvent a test objective. The procedure CHECK FILE is used to 
check the contents of text files written by some of the Class C tests for 
chapter 14 of the Ada Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. These tests produce messages that 
are examined to verify that the units are operating correctly. If these 
units are not operating correctly, then the validation is not attempted. 

The text of each test in the ACVC follows conventions that are intended to 
ensure that the tests are reasonably portable without modification. For 
example, the tests make use of only the basic set of 55 characters, contain 
lines with a maximum length of 72 characters, use small numeric values, and 
place features that may not be supported by all implementations in separate 








INTRODUCTION 


tests. However, some tests contain values that require the test to be 
customized according to implementation-specific values—for example, an 
illegal file name. A list of the values used for this validation is 
provided in Appendix C. 

A compiler must correctly process each of the tests in the suite and 
demonstrate conformity to the Ada Standard by either meeting the pass 
criteria given for the test or by showing that the test is inapplicable to 
the implementation. The applicability of a test to an implementation is 
considered each time the implementation is validated. A test that is 
inapplicable for one validation is not necessarily inapplicable for a 
subsequent validation. Any test that was determined to contain an illegal 
language construct or an erroneous language construct is withdrawn from the 
ACVC and, therefore, is not used in testing a compiler. The tests 
withdrawn at the time of this validation are given in Appendix D.

2-1 





CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


2.2 IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS 

One of the purposes of validating compilers is to determine the behavior of 
a compiler in those areas of the Ada Standard that permit implementations 
to differ. Class D and E tests specifically check for such implementation 
differences. However, tests in other classes also characterize an 
implementation. The tests demonstrate the following characteristics: 


a. Capacities. 


(1) The compiler correctly processes a compilation containing 723 
variables in the same declarative part. (See test D29002K.) 

(2) The compiler correctly processes tests containing loop 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See tests D55A03A..H (8 
tests).) 

(3) The compiler correctly processes tests containing block 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See test D56001B.) 

(4) The compiler correctly processes tests containing recursive 
procedures separately compiled as subunits nested to 10 
levels. (See tests D64005E..G (3 tests).) 


b. Predefined types. 

(1) This implementation supports the additional predefined types 
SHORT INTEGER and L0NG_FL0AT in package STANDARD. (See tests 
B8600IT..Z (7 tests).) 


c. Expression evaluation. 

The order in which expressions are evaluated and the time at which 
constraints are checked are not defined by the language. Vhile 
the ACVC tests do not specifically attempt to determine the order 
of evaluation of expressions, test results indicate the following: 

(1) Some of the default initialization expressions for record 
components are evaluated before any value is checked for 
membership in a component's subtype. (See test C32117A.) 

(2) Assignments for subtypes are performed with the same precision 
as the base type. (See test C35712B.) 


(3) This implementation uses no extra bits for extra precision and 
uses no extra bits for extra range. (See test C35903A.) 










CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(4) Sometimes NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when an integer literal 
operand in a comparison or membership test is outside the 
range of the base type. (See test C45232A.) 

(5) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised vhen a literal operand in a 
fixed-point comparison or membership test is outside the range 
of the base type. (See test C45252A.) 

(6) Underflow is not gradual. (See tests C4S524A..Z.) 


d. Rounding. 

The method by vhich values are rounded in type conversions is not 
defined by the language. While the ACVC tests do not specifically 
attempt to determine the method of rounding, the test results 
indicate the following: 

(1) The method used for rounding to. integer is round away from 
zero. (See tests C46012A..Z.) 

(2) The method used for rounding to longest integer is round away 
from zero. (See tests C46012A..Z.) 

(3) The method used for rounding to integer in static universal 
real expressions is round away from zero. (See test C4A014A.) 


e. Array types. 

An implementation is allowed to raise NUMERIC_ERROR or 

CONSTRAINT_ERROR for an array having a 'LENGTH that exceeds 

STANDARD.INTEGER'LAST and/or SYSTEM.MAX_INT. 

For this implementation: 

(1) Declaration of an array type or subtype declaration vith more 

than SYSTEM.MAX INT components raises NUMERIC_ERROR sometimes. 
(See test C36003A.) ~ 

(2) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when a null array type with 

INTEGER'LAST + 2 components is declared. (See test C36202A.) 

(3) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when a null array type vith 

SYSTEM.MAX INT + 2 components is declared. (See test 

C36202B.) ” 

(4) A packed BOOLEAN array having a 'LENGTH exceeding INTEGER'LAST 
raises NUMERIC_ERROR when the array type is declared. (See 
test C52103X.) 


2-3 








CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(5) A packed two-dimensional BOOLEAN array with more than 
INTEGER'LAST components raises NUMERIC_ERROR when the array 
type is declared. (See test C52104Y.) 

(6) A null array with one dimension of length greater than 

INTEGER'LAST may raise NUMERIC_ERROR or CONSTRAINT_ERROR 
either when declared or assigned. Alternatively, an 

implementation may accept the declaration. However, lengths 
must match in array slice assignments. This implementation 
raises NUMERIC ERROR when the array type is declared. (See 
test E52103Y.) “ 

(7) In assigning one-dimensional array types, the expression is 
evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
vith the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

(8) In assigning two-dimensional array types, the expression is 
not evaluated in its entirety before C0NSTRAINT_ERR0R is 
raised when checking whether the expression's subtype is 
compatible with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


f. Discriminated types. 

(1) In assigning record types vith discriminants, the expression 
is evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


g. Aggregates. 

(1) In the evaluation of a multi-dimensional aggregate, index 
subtype checks are made as choices are evaluated. (See tests 
C43207A and C43207B.) 

(2) In the evaluation of an aggregate containing subaggregates, 
not all choices are evaluated before being checked for 
identical bounds. (See test E43212B.) 

(3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised after all choices are evaluated 
when a bound in a non-null range of a non-null aggregate does 
not belong to an index subtype. (See test E43211B.) 


h. Pragmas. 

(1) The pragma INLINE is not supported for functions or 

procedures. (See tests LA3004A..B, EA3004C..D, and 

CA3004E..F.) 


2-4 






CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


i. Generics 

(1) Generic library subprogram specifications and bodies can be 
compiled in separate compilations. (See test CA1012A.) 

(2) Generic non-library subprogram bodies cannot be compiled in 

separate compilations from their stubs. (See test CA2009F.) 

(3) Generic library package specifications and bodies can be 

compiled in separate compilations. (See tests BC3204C and 
BC3205D.) 

(4) Generic non-library package bodies as subunits cannot be 

compiled in separate compilations. (See test CA2009C.) 

(5) Generic unit bodies and their subunits can be compiled in 
separate compilations. (See test CA3011A.) 


j. Input and output 

(1) The package SEQUENTIAL_IO cannot be instantiated with 
unconstrained array types or record types vith discriminants 
without defaults. (See tests AE2101C, EE2201D, and EE2201E.) 

(2) The package DIRECT_IO cannot be instantiated with 
unconstrained array types or record types with discriminants 
without defaults. (See tests AE2101E, EE2401D, and EE2401G.) 

(3) Modes IN_FILE and OUT FILE are supported for SEQUENTIAL_IO. 
(See tests CE2102D..E, CE2102N, and CE2102P.) 

(4) Modes IN FILE, OUT FILE, and INOUT FILE are supported for 
DIRECT I07 (See tests CE2102F, CE210SI..J, CE2102R, CE2102T, 
and CEI102V.) 

(5) Modes IN FILE and OUT FILE are supported for text files. (See 
tests CE3102E and CE3I02I..K.) 

(6) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for SEQUENTIAL_IO. 
(See tests CE2102G and CE2102X.) 

(7) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for DIRECT 10. (See 
tests CE2102K and CE2102Y.) 

(8) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for text files. 
(See tests CE3102F..G, CE3104C, CE3110A, and CE3114A.) 

(9) Overwriting to a sequential file does not truncate the file. 
(See test CE2208B.)

CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(10) Temporary sequential files are given names and deleted when 
closed. (See test CE2108A.) 

(11) Temporary direct files are given names and deleted when 
closed. (See test CE2108C.)

CHAPTER 3 
TEST INFORMATION 


3.1 TEST RESULTS 

Version 1.10 o£ the ACVC comprises 3717 tests. When this compiler vas 
tested, 43 tests had been withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF 
determined that 318 tests were inapplicable to this implementation. All 
inapplicable tests were processed during validation testing except for 201 
executable tests that use floating-point precision exceeding that supported 
by the implementation . Modifications to the code, processing, or grading 
for 6 tests were required to successfully demonstrate the test objective. 
(See section 3.6.) 

The AVF concludes that the testing results demonstrate acceptable 
conformity to the Ada Standard.

3.5 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

Some tests do not apply to all compilers because they make use of features that 
a compiler is not required by the Ada Standard to support. Others may depend on 
the result of another test that is either inapplicable or withdrawn. The 
applicability of a test to an implementation is considered each time a 
validation is attempted. A test that is inapplicable for one validation attempt 
is not necessarily inapplicable for a subsequent attempt. For this validation 
attempt, 318 tests were inapplicable for the reasons indicated: 


a. The following 201 tests are not applicable because they have 
floating-point type declarations requiring more digits than 
SYSTEM.MAX DIGITS: • 


C24113L..Y 
C35708L..Y 
C45421L..Y 
C45641L..Y 


C35705L..Y 
C35802L..Z

include enumeration representation clauses for BOOLEAN types in which 
the representation values are other than (FALSE *> 0, TRUE «> 1). 
Under the terms of AI-00325, this implementation is not required to 
support such representation clauses. 

c. C35702A and B86001T are not applicable because this implementation 
supports no predefined type SH0RT_FL0AT. 

d. The following 16 tests are not applicable because this implementation 
does not support a predefined type L0NG_INTEGER: 

C45231C C45304C C45502C C45503C C45504C 

C45504F C45611C C45613C C45614C C45631C ***

implementation does not support any predefined integer type with a name 
other than INTEGER, LONG_INTEGER, or SH0RT_INTEGER. 

f. C45531M..P (4 tests) and C45532M..P (4 tests) are not applicable 

because the value of SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA is less than 47. 

g. C52008B is not applicable because this implementation does not support 
a record type with four discriminants of type integer having default 
values. The si 2 e of this object exceeds the maximum object size of 
this implementation and NUMERIC_ERR0R is raised. 

h. D64005G is not applicable because this implementation does not support 
nesting 17 levels of recursive procedu_e calls. 

i. C86001F is not applicable because, for this implementation, the package 

TEXT_I0 is dependent upon package SYSTEM. These tests recompile 

package SYSTEM, making package TEXT_I0, and hence package REPORT, 
obsolete. 

j. B86001Y is not applicable because this implementation supports no 

predefined fixed-point type other than DURATION. 

k. B86001Z is not applicable because this implementation supports no 

predefined floating-point type vith a name other than FLOAT, 
L0NG_FL0AT, or SH0RT_FL0AT.

TEST INFORMATION 


as. CE3111B, CE3111D..E (2 tests), CE3114B, and CE3115A are not applicable 

because multiple internal files cannot be associated with the same 
external file when one or more files is writing for text files. The 
proper exception is raised when multiple access is attempted. 


3.6 TEST, PROCESSING, AND EVALUATION MODIFICATIONS 

It is expected that some tests will require modifications of code, processing, 
or evaluation in order to compensate for legitimate implementation behavior. 
Modifications are made by the AVF in cases where legitimate implementation 
behavior prevents the successful completion of an (otherwise) applicable test. 
Examples of such modifications include: adding a length clause to alter the 
default size of a collection; splitting a Class B test into subtests so that all 
errors are detected; and confirming that messages produced by an executable test 
demonstrate conforming behavior that wasn't anticipated by the test (such as 
raising one exception instead of another). 

» 

Modifications were required for 6 tests. 


The following tests were split because syntax errors at one point resulted in 
the compiler not detecting other errors in the test:

3.7 ADDITIONAL TESTING INFORMATION 


3.7.1 Prevalidation 

Prior to validation, a set of test results for ACVC Version 1.10 produced by the 
IBM Development System for the Ada Language, MVS Ada Compiler was submitted to 
the AVF by the applicant for review. Analysis of these results demonstrated 
that the compiler successfully passed all applicable tests, and the compiler 
exhibited the expected behavior on all inapplicable tests. 


3.7.2 Test Method 


Testing of the IBM Development System for the Ada Language, MVS Ada Compiler 
using ACVC Version 1.10 was conducted on-site by a validation team from the AVF. 
The configuration in which the testing was performed is described by the 
following designations of hardware and software components:

TEST INFORMATION 


A magnetic tape containing all tests except for withdrawn tests and tests 
requiring unsupported floating-point precisions was taken on-site by the 
validation team for processing. Tests that make use of implementation-specific 
values were customized before being written to the magnetic tape. Tests 
requiring modifications during the prevalidation testing were included in their 
modified form on the magnetic tape. 

The contents of the magnetic tape were ported onto the host computer after first 
being loaded to a VM/CMS computer system. No conversion or alteration of 
contents occurred. 


After the test files were loaded to disk, the full set of tests was compiled, 
linked, and all executable tests were run on the IBM 4381. Results vere printed 
from the from the host computer. 

The compiler vas tested using command scripts provided by International Business 
Machines Corporation and revieved by the validation team. The compiler vas 
tested using all default option settings except for the folloving:

messages interspersed with source code. 

Produces a compilation source listing. Semantic 
errors, syntax errors, and warnings are 
interspersed. 

Causes the program to load and execute. It is 
assumed that the program display the results on 
the console. The output of the entire compilation 
and execution is copied to a dataset. This dataset 
is examined to determine whether the program was 
executed successfully. 


Tests were compiled, linked, and executed (as appropriate) using a single 
computer. Test output, compilation listings, and job logs were captured on 
magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site by the 
validation team vere also archived.

APPENDIX B 


APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


The only allowed implementation dependencies correspond to 
implementation-dependent pragmas, to certain machine-dependent conventions 
as mentioned in chapter 13 of the Ada Standard, and to certain allowed 
restrictions on representation clauses. The implementation-dependent 
characteristics of the IBM Development System for the Ada Language, MVS Ada 
Compiler, Version 2.1.1, as described in this Appendix, are provided by 
TeleSoft. Unless specifically noted otherwise, references in this Appendix 
are to compiler documentation and not to this report. 
Implementation-specific portions of the package STANDARD, which are not a 
part of Appendix F, are: 


package STANDARD is 


type INTEGER is range -2_147_483 648 .. 2147 483_647; 
type SHORT_INTEGER is range -32_768 .. 32_767; 

type FLOAT is digits 6 range -7.23701E+75 .. 7.23701E+75; 
type LONG_FLOAT is digits 15 range -7.2370P cr ~733225E+75 ..

type DURATION is delta 2#1.0#E-14 range -86400.0 .. 86400.0; 


end STANDARD; 


B-l 







APPENDIX F 

OF THE LANGUAGE REFERENCE MANUAL 


The Ada language definition allows for certain target dependencies in a controlled manner. 
This section, called Appendix F as prescribed in the LRM, describes implementation-dependent 
characteristics of the IBM Development System for the Ada Language Release 2.1.1 running 
under CMS or MVS. 

1. Implementation-Defined Pragmas 

PRAGMA INTERFACE( Assembly, <subroutine_name> ); 

PRAGMA INTERFACE( Non_XA_Assembly, <subroutine_name> ); 

PRAGMA INTERFACE( Fortran, <subroutine_name> ); 

PRAGMA SUPPRESS_ALL; 

to cause Pragma SUPPRESS to be invoked simultaneously for all the following 
condition_names: access_check, discriminant_check, index check, length check. 
division_check, elaboration check, and storage check. 

PRAGMA COMMENT (string_literal); 

embeds string_literal into object code 
PRAGMA IMAGES (enumeration_type, <immediate>[ <deferred>); 

generates a table of images for the enumeration type, deferred causes the table to be 
generated only if the enumeration type is used in a compilation unit 

PRAGMA LINKNAME (<pragma INTERFACE subprogram name>, <linkname>); 

when used in association with pragma INTERFACE, will provide access to any routine 
whose name can be specified by an Ada string literal. 

•PRAGMA MVSTASK (priority); 

to specify the relative urgency of each MVS task created. 

•PRAGMA ALLOCATION JD AT A 

(<access type>, 

< residence mode>, 

<allocation duration>, 

<subpool_number>, 

< discrete_user _data>); 

to associate MVS virtual storage attributes with an Ada access type. 

Note that PRAGMA MVSTASK and PRAGMA ALLOCATION DATA are effective only when 
compiling for an MVS target. Both pragmas require that an MVS runtime be present. 


2. Implementation-Defined Attributes 

There are no implementation-defined attributes. 


B-2 












3. Package SYSTEM 

The current, specification of package SYSTEM is provided below. 

PACKAGE System IS 

TYPE Address is Access Integer; 

TYPE Name IS (MC68000, ANUYK44. IBM370); 

System_Name : CONSTANT name := IBM370; 

Storage_Unit : CONSTANT :*= 8; 

Memory _Size : CONSTANT := 2**24-l; 

— System-Dependent Named Numbers: 

Minjnt : CONSTANT -(2 ** 31); 

Max Jnt : CONSTANT :« (2 ** 31) - 1; 

Max_Digits : CONSTANT := 15; 

Max_Mantissa : CONSTANT 31; 

Fine_Delta : CONSTANT 1.0 / (2 ** Max_Mantissa ); 

Tick : CONSTANT 1.0 / (10 ** 6); 

— Other System-Dependent Declarations 

TYPE Subprogram_Value is record 

Entry_Point_Address : Address: 

Display : Address; 
end record: 

SUBTYPE Priority IS Integer RANGE -255 .. 255: 
end SYSTEM; 

4. Representation Clauses 

This implementation supports address, length, enumeration, and record representation 
clauses with the following exceptions: 

Address clauses are not supported for package, for entry, for tasktype, for 
subprograms. 

Enumeration clauses are not supported for boolean representation clauses. 

The size in bits of representation specified records is rounded up to the next highest multiple 
of 8, meaning that the object of a representation specified record with 25 bits will actually occupy 
32 bits, and, if the record is used as a component of another representation specified record, 32 
bits must be reserved for it. 

Non-supported clauses are rejected at compile time. 


B-3 












5. Implementation-Generated Names 

There are no implementation-generated names denoting implementation-dependent 
components. Names generated by the compiler shall not interfere with programmer-defined 
names. 

6. Address Clause Expression Interpretation 

Expressions that appear in Address clauses are interpreted as virtual memorv addresses. 

7. Unchecked Conversion Restrictions 

Unchecked conversions are allowed between types (or subtypes) Tl and T2 provided that: 

(1) They have the same static size. 

(2) They are not private. 

8. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics of the I/O Packages 

• Sequential_IO, Direct_10, and Text_10 are supported. 

• Low_Level_IO is not supported. 

• Unconstrained array types and unconstrained types with discriminants may not be 
instantiated for I/O. 

• File names follow the conventions and restrictions of the target operating system. 

• In Text 10, the type Field is defined as follows: subtype Field is integer range 0..1000: 

• In TextJO, the type Count is defined as follows: type Count is range 
0..2 147 483 646;

APPENDIX C 
TEST PARAMETERS 


Certain tests in the ACVC make use of implementation-dependent values, such 
as the maximum length of an input line and invalid file names. A test that 
makes use of such values is identified by the extension .TST in its file 
name. Actual values to be substituted are represented by names that begin 
with a dollar sign. A value must be substituted for each of these names 
before the test is run. The values used for this validation are given 
belov. 


Name and Meaning _ 

$ACC_SIZE 

An integer literal whose value 
is the number of bits sufficient 
to hold any value of an access 
type. 

$BIG_ID1 

An identifier the size of the 
maximum input line length which 
is identical to $BIG_ID2 except 
for the last character. 

$BIG_ID2 

An identifier the size of the 
maximum input line length which 
is identical to $BIG_ID1 except 
for the last character. 

$BIG_ID3 

An identifier the size of the 
maximum input line length which 
is identical to $BIG_ID4 except 
for a character near the middle.

APPENDIX D 


WITHDRAWN TESTS 


Some tests are vithdravn from tht ACVC because they do not conform to the 
Ada Standard. The following 43 tests had been vithdravn at the time of 
validation testing for the reasons indicated. A reference of the form 
Al-ddddd is to an Ada Commentary. 


a. E28005C: This test expects that the string "— TOP OF PAGE. —63" of 
line 204 will appear at the top of the listing page due to a pragma 
PAGE in line 203; but line 203 contains text that follows the pragma, 
and it is this text that must appear at the top of the page. 

b. A39005G: This test unreasonably expects a component clause to pack an 
array component into a minimum size (line 30). 

c. B97102E: This test contains an unintended illegality: a select 
statement contains a null statement at the place of a selective wait 
alternative (line 31). 

d. BC3009B: This test wrongly expects that circular instantiations will 
be detected in several compilation units even though none of the units 
is illegal with respect to the units it depends on; by AI-00256, the 
illegality need not be detected until execution is attempted (line 
95). 

e. CD2A62D: This test wrongly requires that an array object's size be no 
greater than 10 although its subtype's size was specified to be 40 
(line 137). 

f. CD2A63A..D, CD2A66A..D, CD2A73A..D, and CD2A76A..D (16 tests): These 

tests wrongly attempt to check the size of objects of a derived type 
(for which a 'SIZE length clause is given) by passing them to a 
derived subprogram (which implicitly converts them to the parent type 
(Ada standard 3.4:14)). Additionally, they use the 'SIZE length 
clause and attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic 
by the WG9 ARG. 


D-l 






WITHDRAWN TESTS 


g. CD2A81G, CD2A83G, CD2A84M..N, and CD50110 (5 tests): These tests 

assume that dependent tasks will terminate while the main program 
executes a loop that simply tests for task termination; this is not 
the case, and the main program may loop indefinitely (lines 74, 85, 
86, 96, and 58, respectively). 

h. CD2B15C and CD7205C: These tests expect that a 'STORAGE_SIZE length 
clause provides precise control over the number of designated objects 
in a collection; the Ada standard 13.2:15 allows that such control 
must not be expected. 

i. CD2D11B: This test gives a SMALL representation clause for a derived 
fixed-point type (at line 30) that defines a set of model numbers that 
are not necessarily represented in the parent type; by Commentary 
AI-00099, all model numbers of a derived fixed-point type must be 
representable values of the parent type. 

j. CD5007B: This test wrongly expects an implicitly declared subprogram 
to be at the address that is specified for an unrelated subprogram 
(line 303). 

k. ED7004B, ED7005C..D, and ED7006C..D (5 tests): These tests check 
various aspects of the use of the three SYSTEM pragmas; the AVO 
withdraws these tests as being inappropriite for validation. 

l. CD7105A: This test requires that successive calls to CALENDAR.CLOCK 
change by at least SYSTEM.TICK; however, by Commentary AI-00201, it is 
only the expected frequency of change that must be at least 
SYSTEM.TICK—particular instances of change may be less (line 29). 

m. CD7203B and CD7204B: These tests use the 'SIZE length clause and 
attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic by the WG9 
ARG. 

n. CD7205D: This test checks an invalid test objective: it treats the 
specification of storage to be reserved for a task's activation as 
though it were like the specification of storage for a collection. 

o. CE2107I: This test requires that objects of two similar scalar types 
be distinguished when read from a file—DATA_ERROR is expected to be 
raised by an attempt to read one object as of the other type. 
However, it is not clear exactly how the Ada standard 14.2.4:4 is to 
be interpreted; thus, this test objective is not considered valid 
(line 90). 

p. CE3111C: This test requires certain behavior, when two files are 
associated with the same external file, that is not required by the 
Ada standard. 

q. CE3301A: This test contains several calls to END_OF_LINE and 
END_OF_PAGE that have no parameter: these calls were intended to 
specify a file, not to refer to STANDARD INPUT (lines 103, 107, H8, 


D-2 





WITHDRAWN TESTS 


132, and 136). 

CE3411B: This test requires that a text file's column number be set to 
COUNT'LAST in order to check that LAYOUT_ERROR is raised by a 
subsequent PUT operation. But the former operation will generally 
raise an exception due to a lack of available disk, space, anc the test 
would thus encumber validation testing.
