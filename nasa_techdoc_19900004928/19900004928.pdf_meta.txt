x-archive-meta-description: An investigation was conducted at the National Transonic Facility (NTF) to document the change in sting-balance deflections from ambient to cryogenic temperatures. Space limitations in some NTF models do not allow the use of on-board angle of attack instrumentation. In order to obtain angle of attack data, pre-determined sting-balance bending data must be combined with arc sector angle measurements. Presently, obtaining pretest sting-balance data requires several cryogenic cycles and cold loadings over a period of several days. A method of reducing the calibration time required is to obtain only ambient temperature sting-balance bending data and correct for changes in material properties at cryogenic temperatures. To validate this method, two typical NTF sting-balance combinations were tested. The test results show excellent agreement with the predicted values and the repeatability of the data was 0.01 degree.
