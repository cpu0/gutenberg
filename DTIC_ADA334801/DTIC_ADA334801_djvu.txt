2 Summary of Activities 

The contract was awarded to Dr. George Vanecek. When Dr. Vanecek left 
Purdue University, to join AT&T, the contract was re-assigned to Professor 
Hoffmann. The work under this contract has focused on two efforts: 

(A) The Proxima project of Dr. Vanecek, simulating virtual mechanical sys¬ 
tems of and the required spatial geometric computations. 

(B) The Erep project of Dr. Hoffmann developing a neutral CAD representa¬ 
tion supporting features and constraints. 

(A) Project Proxima (Vanecek) 

This effort is a continuation of the highly successful Project Newton sponsored 
by ONR (N00014-86-K-0465 and N00014-90-J-1599). Newton was a collabora¬ 
tion between John Hopcroft, Cornell, and Christoph Hoffmann, Purdue. The 
objective of the Newton effort has been the creation of a system for simulating 
the dynamical behavior of mechanisms and mechanically evolving environments. 

The objective of Proxima was to create infrastructure and environments 
for rapid creation of mechanical simulations and virtual environments, with 
special emphasis on distance computations and collision detection and analysis. 
Proxima also had collaborative ties with Jim Cremer, University of Iowa, who 
was also supported by ONR. 

The creation of geometric models for virtual worlds is a primary difficulty 
addressed by Proxima. To this end, special data structure were developed and 
implemented for computing the proximity of objects and for determining near 
features between objects that are close. The publications resulting from this 
work are listed below. The Proxima toolkit was implemented in C+-I-. 

As part of the effort. Dr. Vanecek organized a workshop at Purdue on Sim¬ 
ulation of Virtual Environments, July 1994, jointly with Professor Cremer from 
the University of Iowa. Due to the success of the workshop, a second work¬ 
shop was organized at the University of Iowa on Simulation and Interaction in 
Virtual Environments. Co-chairs of the second workshop were Professor Cre¬ 
mer from the University of Iowa and Professor Manocha from the University of 
North Carolina. The conference was held July 13-15, 1995. Earlier, results from 
this the effort had been presented at a ONR 6.1 Virtual Environment Grantees 
Workshop, in March of 1995.

(B) Feature Bzised Design with Ereps (Hoffmann) 

The Erep project, also supported by ONR under contracts N00014-90-J-1599 
and N00014-96-1-0635, has developed an information model of a high-level, 
feature-based design representation. This ongoing effort has had significant 
impact on the field of solid modeling, and on both academic research and com¬ 
mercial CAD development. For example, the Erep work was extended by the 
industry-led ARPA ENGEN Project, administered through ONR and awarded 
to an industry consortium led by the South Carolina Research Authority to 
develop the exchange of constraints between commercial CAD systems. 

During the support period, the project explored issues of spatial constraint 
solving, an enabling technology for next generation CAD, and issues related 
to user-defined features. Current work is developing an object-oriented design 
repository framework, a so-called master model. This new initiative is also show¬ 
ing signs of string impact: Hoffmann will present some of the results of this work 
at the upcoming Aerospace Interest Group meeting in Arizona, January 1998, 
and participate in discussions setting strategic directions for CAD developments 
for the next five years.
