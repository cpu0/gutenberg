INTRODUCTION 


The Ada implementation described cibove was tested according to the Ada 
Validation Procedures (Pro90] against the Ada Standard [Ada83] using the 
current Ada Coi^iler Validation Capability (ACVC). This Validation Summary 
Report (VSR) gives an account of the testing of this Ada implementation. 

For any technical terms used in this report, the reader is referred to 
[Pro90]. A detailed description of the ACVC may be found in the current 
ACVC User's Guide (UG89].

1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada inplementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: A, 
B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class to 
v^ich it belongs. Class A, C, D, eind E tests are executable. Class B and 
class L tests are expected to produce errors at compile time and link time, 
respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner eind produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result vrtien they 
are executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT 2 Uid SPPRT13, 
and the procedure CHECK FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT 
also provides a set of Identity functions used to defeat some conpiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a conpiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled emd the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the con^iler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that ein Ada inplementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately compiled units. Errors 
are expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values — for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in ^^jpendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests euid 
implementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this implementation are described in section 2.3. 


1-2 



INTRODUCTION 


For each Ada inplementation, a customized test suite is produced by the 
AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications described in 
the preceding paragraph, removing withdravm tests (see section 2.1), and 
possibly removing some inapplicable tests (see section 2.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass ein ACVC an Ada implementation must process each test of 
the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are irrelevant 
for a given Ada implementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may 
be supported by document-^ issued by the ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and commonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Commentaries are included as 
appropriate.

C35713B, C45423B, B86001T, aind C86006H check for the predefined type 
SHORT_FLQAT; for this implementation, there is no such type. 

C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with a 
name other than FLOAT, LONG_FLOAT, or SHORT_FLOAT; for this 
implementation, there is no such type. 


C45531M..P and C45532M..P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations for 
types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or greater; for this 
implementation, MAX_MANTISSA is less than 47. 

C45624A..B (2 tests) check that the proper exception is raised if 
MACHINE_OVERFLCWS is FALSE for floating point types and the results of 
various floating-point operations lie outside the range of the base 
type; for this inplementation, MACHINE_0VERFLO7S is TRUE. 

B86001Y uses the name of a predefined fixed-point type other than type 
DURATION; for this implementation, there is no such type. 

C96005B uses values of type DURATION'S base type that are outside the 
range of type DURATIW; for this inplementation, the ranges are the 
same. 

CD1009C checks vdiether a length clause can specify a non-default size 
for a floating-point type; this implementation does not support such 
sizes. 

CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use length clauses 
to specify non-default sizes for access types; this implementation 
does not support such sizes.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIC»^S 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 20 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
inplementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the 
way expected by the original tests.

CD1009A, CD1009I, CD1C03A, CD2A24A, CD2A31A..C (3 tests) were graded 
passed by Evaluation Modification as directed by the AVO. These tests use 
instantiations of the support procedure LENGTH_CHECK, which uses 
Unchecked_Conversion according to the interpretation given in AI-00590. 

The AVO ruled that this interpretation is not binding under ACVC 1.11; the 
tests are ruled to be passed if they produce Failed messages only from the 
instances of LENGTH_CHECK—i.e, the allowed Report.Failed messages have 
the general form: 

" * CHECK ON REPRESENTATION FOR <'IYPE ID> FAILED."

PROCESSING INFORMATIOJ 


3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Inplementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming 
Language Standard, whether the test is applicable or inapplicable; 
otherwise, the Ada Inplementation fails the ACVC [Pro90]. 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Stcindard. 

The list of items below gives the number of ACVC tests in various 
categories. All tests were processed, except those that were withdrawn 
because of test errors (item b; see section 2.1), those that require a 
floating-point precision that exceeds the inplementation's mciximum 
precision (item e; see section 2.2), and those that depend on the support 
of a file system — if none is supported (item d). All tests passed, 
except those that are listed in sections 2.1 and 2.2 (counted in items b 
and f, below). 


a) Total Number of Appliccible Tests 3806 

b) Total Number of Withdrawn Tests 95 

c) Processed Inapplicable Tests 68 

d) Non-Processed I/O Tests 0 

e) Non-Processed Floating-Point 

Precision Tests 201 

f) Total Number of Inapplicable Tests 269 


g) Total Number of Tests for ACVC 1.11 4170 


3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were loaded onto a Sun Workstation and copied over Ethernet 
to the host conputer. 


The tests were conpiled and linked on the host computer system, as 
appropriate. The executable images were transferred to the target conputer 
system by the communications link described above, and run. The results 
were captured on the host computer system. 


Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the customer and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a conplete listing of 
the processing options for this implementation. It also indicates the 
default options. The options invoked explicitly for validation testing 
during this test were:

MACRO PARAMETERS 


This appendix contains the macro parameters used for customizing the ACVC. 
The meaning and purpose of these parameters are explained in [UG89]. The 
parameter values are presented in two tables. The first tadsle lists the 
values that are defined in terms of the maximum input-line length, which is 
the value for $MAX_IN_LEN—also listed here. These values are expressed 
here as Ada string aggregates, v^ere "V" represents the maximum input-line 
length.

APPENDIX B 


COMPILATICN SYSTEM OPTIONS 


The coitpiler options of this Ada implementation, as described in this 
^pendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to compiler documentation and 
not to this report. 

ada - invoke the Ada compiler 

SYNTAX 

ada [options] [source_file]... [object_file.o]... 

OPTIONS 

-# identifier type value (define) Define an identifier of a 

specified type and value. See VADS ADA PREPROCESSOR REFERENCE. 

-A (disassemble) disassemble the units in the source file after 
compiling them. -A Ccin be followed by arguments that further 
define the disassembly display (e.g. -Aa, -Ab, -Ad, -Af, -Al, -As): 

a add hexadecimal display of instruction bytes to disassembly 
listing 

b disassemble the unit body [default] 
d print the data section (if present) as well 
f use the alternative format for output 

1 put the disassembly output in file "file_name.das" 

s disassemble the unit spec 

-a file_name (archive) Treat file_name as an object archive file created 
by ar. Since some archive files end with .a, -a is used to 
distinguish archive files from Ada source files. 

-DG (debug flag) Force front end to write out the gnrx.lib file in ASCII 
format. To use this option, you must compile a file that changes 
the gnrx.lib file. 

-d (dependencies) Analyze for dependencies only. Do not do semantic 

analysis or code generation. Update the library, marking any defined 


B-1 





COMPILATICN SYSTEM OPTICWS 


units as ^compiled. The -d option is used by a.make to establish 
dependencies among new files. 

-e (error) Process conpilation error messages using a.error and send it 
to standard output. Only the source lines containing errors are 
listed. Only one -e or -E option should be used. 

-E 

-E file 

-E directory (error output) Without a file or directory argument, ada 

processes error messages using a.error and directs a brief 
output to stauidard output; the raw error messages are left 
in ada_source.err. If a file pathname is given, the raw 
error messages are placed in that file. If a directory 
argument is supplied, the raw error output is placed in 
dir/source.err. The file of raw error messages can be used 
as input to a.error. 

-el (error listing) Intersperse error messages among source lines and 
direct to standard output. 

-El 

-El file 

-El directory (error listing) Same as the -E option, except that source 
listing with errors is produced. 

-ev (error vi(l)) Process syntax error messages using a.error, embed 
them in the source file, and call the environment editor 
ERROR_EDITOR. (If ERROR_EDITOR is defined, the environment variable 
ERROR PATTERN should also be defined. ERROR_PATTERN is an editor 
search command that locates the first occurrence of '###' in the 
error file.) If no editor is specified, vi(l) is invoked. 

-K (keep) Keep the intermediate language (IL) file produced by the 
compiler front end. The IL file will be placed in the .objects 
directory, with the file name Ada_source. 

-L library_name (library) Operate in VADS library library_name. 

[Default: current working directory) 

-lfile_abbreviation (library search) This is an option passed to the UNIX 

linker, ld(l) telling it to search the specified 
library file. (No space between the -1 and the file 
abbreviation.) 

For a description of the file abbreviations, see also 
Operating System documentation, ld(l). 

-M unit_name (main) Produce ein executable program by linking the named 
unit as the main program. unit_name must already be 
compiled. It must be either a parameterless procedure or 
a parameterless function returning an integer. The 
executable program will be named a.out unless overridden 
with the -o option. 


B-2 




COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-M source_file (main) Produce an executable program by compiling and 
linking source_file. The main unit of the program is 
assumed to be the root name of the .a file (for foo.a 
the unit is foo). Only one .a file may be preceded by 
-M. The executable program will be named a.out 
(self-hosted) or a.vox (cross-development) unless 
overridden with the -o option. 

-o executcible_file (output) This option is to be used in conjunction 

with the -M option. executable_file is the name 
of the executcible rather than the default a.out. 

-O[0-9] (optimize) Invoke the code optimizer. An optional digit 

(there is no space before the digit) provides the level of 
optimization. The default is -04. 

-0 full optimization 
-OO no optimization 

-01 copy propagation, constant folding, removing dead variables, 
subsuming moves between scalar variables 
-02 add CSE within basic blocks 
-03 add global CSE 

-04 add hoisting invariants from loops and address 
optimizations 

-05 add reinge optimizations, instruction scheduling and one 
pass of reducing induction expressions 
-06 no change and instruction scheduling 

-07 add one more pass of induction expression reduction and 
instruction scheduling 

-08 add one more pass of induction expression reduction and 
instruction scheduling 

-09 add one more pass of induction expression reduction, 

instruction scheduling and hoisting expressions common 
to the then eind else parts of if statements. 

Hoisting from brcinches (and cases alternatives) can be slow 
and does not always provide significant performance gains so 
it can be suppressed. 

NOTE; This version of VADS includes a preliminary SPARC- 
specific optimizer. It schedules loads to avoid pipeline 
conflicts and moves instructions to the delay slots of 
branches and calls. Since it can be slow for some programs, 
it is only enabled at optimization levels greater than 4. 

For more information about optimization, see COMPILING ADA 
PROGRAMS, Compiler Optimizations and pragma OPTIMIZE_CODE(OFF). 

-P Invoke the Ada Preprocessor. See VADS ADA PREPROCESSOR REFERENCE. 

-R VADS_library (recompile instantiation) Force analysis of all 

generic instantiations, causing reinstantiation of 
any that are out of date. 


B-3 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTICWS 


-S (suppress) Apply pragma SUPPRESS to the entire conpilation for all 
suppressible checks. (See also pragma SUPPRESS(ALL_CHECKS)). 

-sh (show) Display the name of the tool executable but do not execute it. 

-T (timing) Print timing information for the conpilation. 

-V (verbose) Print conpiler version number, date and time of compilation, 
name of file compiled, command input line, total compilation time and 
error summary line. Storage usage information about the object file 
is provided. 

-w (warnings) Suppress warning diagnostics. 

DESCRIt-nON 

The command ada executes the Ada conpiler and conpiles the named Ada 
source file, ending with the .a suffix. The file must reside in a VADS 
library directory. The ada.lib file in this directory is modified after 
each Ada unit is coitpiled. 

By default, ada produces only object and net files. If the -M option is 
used, the compiler automatically invokes a.Id and builds a complete 
progreun with the named library unit as the main program. 

Non-Ada object files (.o files produced by a compiler for another 
language) may be given as arguments to ada. These files will be passed 
on to the linker and will be linked with the specified Ada object files. 

Command line options may be specified in any order, but the order of 
conpilation and the order of the files to be passed to the linker can be 
significant. 

Several VADS conpilers may be simultaneously available on a single system. 
Because the ada command in emy VADS_location/bin on a system will execute 
the correct compiler components based upon visible library directives, 
the option -sh is provided to print the name of the components actually 
executed. 

Program listings with a disassembly of machine code instructions are 
generated by a.db or a.das. 

DIACM)STICS 

The diagnostics produced by the VADS compiler are intended to be 
self-explanatory. Most refer to the RM. Each RM reference includes a 
section number cind optionally, a paragraph number enclosed in parentheses.

LINKER OPTIONS 

The linker options of this Ada implementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to linker documentation and not 
to this report. 

a.Id - prelinker 

SYNTAX 

a.Id [options] \init_name [ld_options] 

OPTIONS 

-DO (objects) Use partially linked objects instead of archives as an 

intermediate file if the entire list of objects cannot be passed to 
the UNIX linker in one invocation. This option is useful because 
of limitations in the archiver on some hosts (including Ultrix, 

HPUX and System V). 

-DX (debug) Debug memory overflow (use in cases where linking a large 
number of units causes the error message "local symbol overflow" 
to occur). 

-E unit_name (elaborate) Elaborate unit_name as early in the 
elaboration order as possible. 

-F (files) Print a list of dependent files in order and suppress linking. 

-L library_name (library) Operate in VADS library library_name. 

[Default: current working directory] 

-o executable_file (output) Use the specified file name as the name of 

the output rather than the default (a.out (self-hosted) 
or a.vox (cross-development)). 

-sh (show) Display the name of the tool executable but do not execute it. 
-U (units) Print a list of dependent units in order and suppress linking. 
-V (verbose) Print the linker command before executing it. 

-V (verify) Print the linker command but suppress execution. 

DESCRIPTICW 

a.Id collects the object files needed to make unit name a main program 
and calls the UNIX linker ld(l) to link together all Ada and other 
language objects required to produce an executable image in a.out 
(self-hosted) or a.vox (cross- development), unit name is the main 




CC»1PILATI0N SYSTEM OPTIONS 


program and must name a non-generic subprogram. It unit_name is a 
function, it must return a value of the type STANDARD.INTEGER. This 
integer result will be passed back to the UNIX shell as the status code 
of the execution. The utility uses the net files produced by the Ada 
compiler to check dependency information, a.Id produces an exception 
mapping table and a unit eleiboration table and passes this information 
to the linke.. The elaboration list generated by a.Id does not include 
library level packages that do not need elaboration. In addition, 
packages that contain no code that can raise an exception will no longer 
have exception teibles. 

a.Id reads instructions for generating executables from the ada.lib file 
in the VADS libraries on the search list. Besides information generated 
by the conpiler, these directives also include WITHn directives that 
allow the automatic linking of object modules compiled from other 
languages or Ada object modules not named in context clauses in the Ada 
source. Any number of WITHn directives may be placed into a library, but 
they must be numbered contiguously beginning at WITHI. The directives 
are recorded in the library's ada.lib file and have the following form. 

WITHI:LINK:Object_file: 

WITH2:LINK:archive_file: 

WITHn directives may be placed in the local Ada libraries or in any 
VADS library on the search list. 

A WITHn directive in a local VAGS library or earlier on the library 
search list will hide the same numbered WITHn directive in a library 
later in the library search list. 

Use the tool a.info to change or report library directives in the 
current library. 

All arguments after unit_name are passed on to the linker. These may 
be options for it, archive libraries, library abbreviations, or object 
files. 


VADS_location/bin/a.ld is a wrapper program that executes the correct 
executable based upon directives visible in the ada.lib file. This 
permits multiple VADS coirpilers to exist on the same host. The -sh 
option prints the name of the actual executable file.

APPEiroiX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


ATTACHMENT III 


APPENDIX F. Inplementation-Dependent Characteristics 


1. Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 

1.1. INLINE_ONLY Pragma 

The INLINE_0NLY pragma, when used in the same way as pragma 
INLINE, indicates to the compiler that the subprogram must 
always be inlined. This pragma also suppresses the genera¬ 
tion of a callable version of the routine which saves code 
space. If a user erroneously makes an INLINE_0NLY subpro¬ 
gram recursive a warning message will be emitted and an 
PROGRAM_ERROR will be raised at run time. 

1.2. INITIALIZE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers STATIC or DYNAMIC as the single 
argument. This pragma is only allowed within a library- 
level package spec or body. It specifies that all objects 
in the package be initialized as requested by the pragma 
(i.e. statically or dynamically). Only library-level 
objects are subject to static initialization; all objects 
within procedures are always (by definition) dynamic. If 
pragma INITLALIZE(STATIC) is used, and an object cannot be 
initialized statically, code will be generated to initialize 
the object and a warning message will be generated. 

1.3. BUILT_IN Pragma 

The BUILT IN pragma is used in the implementation of some 
predefined Ada packages, but provides no user access. It is 
used only to implement code bodies for which no actual Ada 
body can be provided, for example the MACHINE_CODE package. 

1.4. SHARE_CODE Pragma 

The SHARE_CODE pragma takes the name of a generic instantia¬ 
tion or a generic unit as the first argument and one of the 
identifiers TRUE or FALSE as the second argument. This 
pragma is only allowed immediately at the place of a 


C-2 




APPEI^IX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


declarative item in a declarative part or package specifica¬ 
tion, or after a library unit in a compilation, but before 
any subsequent compilation unit. 

When the first argument is a generic unit the pragma applies 
to all instantiations of that generic. When the first argu¬ 
ment is the name of a generic instantiation the pragma 
applies only to the specified instantiation, or overloaded 
instantiations. 

If the second argument is TRUE the conpiler will try to 
share code generated for a generic instantiation with code 
generated for other instantiations of the same generic. 
When the second argument is FALSE each instantiation will 
get a unique copy of the generated code. The extent to 
VNhich code is shared between instantiations depends on this 
pragma and the kind of generic formal parameters declared 
for the generic unit. 

The name pragma SHAREJBODY is also recognized by the inple- 
mentation eind has the same effect as SHARE_CODE. It is 
included for compateibility with earlier versions of VADS. 

1.5. NO_IMAGE Pragma 

The pragma suppresses the generation of the image array used 
for the IMAGE attribute of enumeration types. This elim¬ 
inates the overhead required to store the array in the exe¬ 
cutable image. An attempt to use the IMAGE attribute on a 
type whose image array has been suppressed will result in a 
compilation warning and PRCXjRAM_ERROR raised at run time. 

1.6. EXTERNAL_NAME Pragma 

The EXTERNAL NAME pragma takes the name of a subprogram or 
variable defined in Ada and allows the user to specify a 
different external name that may be used to reference the 
entity from other languages. The pragma is allowed at the 
place of a declarative item in a package specification eind 
must apply to an object declared earlier in the same package 
specification. 

1.7. INTERFACE_NAME Pragma 

The INTERFACE_NAME pragma takes the name of a a variable or 
subprogram defined in another language and allows it to be 
referenced directly in Ada. The pragma will replace all 
occurrences of the variable or subprogram name with an 
external reference to the second, link_argjment. The pragma 
is allowed at the place of a declarative item in a package 
specification and must apply to an object or subprogram 
declared earlier in the same package specification. The 
object must be declared as a scalar or an access type. The 


C-3 



APPEM)IX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


object cannot be any of the following; 
a loop variable, 
a constant, 

an initialized varieible, 
an array, or 
a record. 

1.8. IMPLICIT_CODE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies that implicit code generated by the 
coitpiler be allowed or disallowed. A warning is issued if 
OFF is used and any inplicit code needs to be generated. 
The default is C»J. 

1.9. OPTIMI2E_CODE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies whether the code should be optim¬ 
ized by the compiler. The default is ON. When OFF is 
specified, the compiler will generate the code as specified. 

2. Inplementation of Predefined Pragmas 

2.1. CONTROLLED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 

2.2. ELABORATE 

This pragma is implemented as described in appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.3. INLINE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.4. INTERFACE 

This pragma supports calls to 'C' and FORTRAN functions. The 
Ada subprograms can be either functions or procedures. The 
types of parameters and the result type for functions must 
be scalar, access or the predefined type ADDRESS in SYSTEM. 
All parameters must have mode IN. Record and array objects 
can be passed by reference using the ADDRESS attribute. 

2.5. LIST 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 


C-4 



APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


Ada RM. 

2.6. MEMORY_SIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The iitple- 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.7. NC»I_REENTRANT 

This pragma takes one argument vhich can be the name of 
either a library subprogram or a subprogram declared immedi¬ 
ately within a library package spec or body. It indicates 
to the conpiler that the si±>program will not be called 
recursively allowing the compiler to perform specific optim¬ 
izations. The pragma can be applied to a subprogram or a 
set of overloaded subprograms within a package spec or pack¬ 
age body. 

2.8. NOT_ELABORATED 

This pragma can only appear in a library package specifica¬ 
tion. It indicates that the package will not be elaborated 
because it is either part of the RTS, a configuration pack¬ 
age or an Ada package that is referenced from a leuiguage 
other than Ada. The presence of this pragma suppresses the 
generation of eleiboration code eind issues warnings if ela¬ 
boration code is required. 

2.9. OPTIMIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the inplementation but has no 
effect. 

2.10. PACK 

This pragma will cause the compiler to choose a non-aligned 
representation for composite types. It will not causes 
objects to be packed at the bit level. 

2.11. PAGE 

This pragma is implemented as described in ;ppendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.12. PASSIVE 

The pragma has three forms : 

PRAOIA PASSIVE; 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(SEMAPHORE); 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(INTERRUPT, <number>); 


C-5 


APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


This pragma Pragma passive can be applied to a task or task 
type declared immediately within a library package spec or 
body. The pragma directs the compiler to optimize certain 
tasking operations. It is possible that the statements in a 
task body will prevent the intended optimization, in these 
cases a warning will be generated at compile time and will 
raise TASKING_ERROR at runtime. 

2.13. PRIORITY 

This pragma is iitplemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.14. SHARED 

This pragma is recognized by the inplementation but has no 
effect. 

2.15. STORAGE_UNIT 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.16. SUPPRESS 

This pragma is implemented as described, except that 
DIVISION_CHECK and in some cases OVERFLCW_CHECK cannot be 
suppressed. 

2.17. SYSTEM_NAME 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTE21 package must be reconciled. 

3. Inplementation-Dependent Attributes 

3.1. P'REF 

For a prefix that denotes an object, a progreim unit, a 
la±)el, or aui entry: 

This attribute denotes the effective address of the first of 
the storage units allocated to P. For a subprogram, pack¬ 
age, task unit, or laibel, it refers to the address of the 
machine code associated with the corresponding body or 
statement. For an entry for which an address clause has 
been given, it refers to the corresponding hardware inter¬ 
rupt. Hie attribute is of the type OPERAND defined in the 
package MACHINE_CODE. The attribute is only allowed within 
a machine code procedure. 


C-6 






APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


See section F.4.8 for more information on the use of this 
attribute. 

(For a package, task unit, or entry, the 'REF attribute is 
not supported.) 

3.2. T'TASKID 

For a task object or a value T, T'TASK_ID yields the unique 
task id associated with a task. The value of this attribute 
is of the type ADDRESS in the package SYSTEM.

5. Restrictions On Representation Clauses 

5.1. Pragma PACK 

In the cibsence of pragma PACK record con^nents are padded 
so as to provide for efficient access by the target 
hardware, pragma PACK applied to a record eliminates the pad¬ 
ding where possible. Pragma PACK has no other effect on the 
storage allocated for record components a record representa¬ 
tion is required. 

5.2. Size Clauses 

For scalar types a representation clause will pack to the 
number of bits required to represent the range of the sub- 
type. A size clause applied to a record type will not cause 
packing of conponents; an explicit record representation 
clause must be given to specify the packing of the com¬ 
ponents. A size clause applied to a record type will cause 
packing of components only when the conponent type is a 
discrete type. An error will be issued if there is insuffi¬ 
cient space allocated. The SIZE attribute is not supported 
for task, access, or floating point types. 

5.3. Address Clauses 

Address clauses are only supported for variables. Since 
default initialization of a variable requires evaluation of 
the variable address elaboration ordering requirements 
prohibit initialization of variables vdiich have address 
clauses. The specified address indicates the physical 
address associated with the variable. 

5.4. Interrupts 

Interrupt entries are supported with the following interpre¬ 
tation and restrictions: 

An interrupt entry may not have any parameters. 

A passive task that contains one or more interrupt entries 
must always be trying to accept each interrupt entry, unless 
it is handling the interrupt. The task must be executing 


C-9 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 




either cun accept for the entry (if there is only one) or a 
select statement where the interrupt entry accept alterna¬ 
tive is open as defined by Ada RM 9.7.1(4). This is not a 
restriction on normal tasks (i.e., signal ISRs). 

An interrupt acts as a conditional entry call in that inter¬ 
rupts are not queued (see the last sentence of Ada RM 
13.5.1(2) and 13.5.1(6)). 

No additional requirements are imposed for a select state¬ 
ment containing both a terminate alternative and an accept 
alternative for an interrupt entry (see Ada RM 13.5.1(3)). 

Direct calls to cin interrupt entry from another task are 
allowed emd are treated as a normal task rendezvous. 

Interrupts are not queued. 

The address clause for an interrupt entry does not specify 
the priority of the interrupt. It simply specifies the 
interrupt vector number. For passive ISRs, the nnn of the 
passive(interrupt,nnn) pragma specifies the interrupt prior¬ 
ity of the task. 

5.5. Represen*- iion Attributes 

The ADDRFSS attribute is not supported for the following 
entities: 

Packages 

Tasks 

Labels 

Entries 

5.6. Machine Code Insertions 
Machine code insertions are supported. 

The general definition of the package MACHINE_CODE provides 
an assembly language interface for the target machine. It 
provides the necessary record type(s) needed in the code 
statement, an enumeration type of all the opcode mnemonics, 
a set of register definitions, and a set of addressing mode 
functions. 

The general syntax of a machine code statement is as fol¬ 
lows: 


CODE_n'( opcode, operand {, operand} ); 
where n indicates the number of operands in the aggregate. 

A special case arises for a variable number of operands. 


C-10 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


The operands are listed within a subaggregate. The format 
is as follows: 

CODE_N'( opcode, (operand {, operand]) ); 

For those opcodes that require no operands, named notation 
must be used (cf. RM 4.3(4)). 

CODE_0'( op => opcode ); 

The opcode must be an enumeration literal (i.e. it cannot be 
an object, attribute, or a rename). 

An operand can only be an entity defined in MACHINE_CODE or 
the 'REF attribute. 

The arguments to any of the functions defined in 
MACHINE_CODE must be static expressions, string literals, or 
the functions defined in MACHINE_CODE. The 'REF attribute 
may not be used as an argument in any of these functions. 

Inline expansion of machine code procedures is supported. 

6. Conventions for Implementation-generated Names 
There are no inplementation-generated names. 

7. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clauses 

Address expressions in an address clause are interpreted as 
physical addresses. 

8. Restrictions on Unchecked Conversions 
None. 

9. Restrictions on Unchecked Deallocations 
None. 

10. Implementation Characteristics of I/O Packages 

Instantiations of DIRECT_I0 use the value MAX_REC_SIZE as 
the record sice (expressed in STOPAGE_UNITS) when the size 
of ELEMENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For example for uncon¬ 
strained arrays such as string where ELEriENT_TYPE' SIZE is 
very large, MAX_REC_SIZE is used instead. MAX_RECORD SIZE 
is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a program before 
instantiating DIRECT_IO to provide an upper limit on the 
record size. In any case the maximum size supported is 1024 
x 1024 X STORAGE_UNIT bits. DIRECT_IO will raise USE_ERROR 
if MAX REC SIZE exceeds this absolute limit. 


C-11 



APPEM)IX F OF THE Ada STANDARD

% 


Instantiations of SEQUENTIAL_IO use the value MAX_REC_SIZE 
as the record size (expressed in STORAGE_UNITS) when the 
size of ELEMENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For example for 
unconstrained arrays such as string where ELEMENT_TyPE'SIZE 
is very large, MAX REC_SIZE is used instead. 
MAX_RECORD SIZE is defined in SYSTEM and Ccin be chcinged by a 
program before instantiating INTEGER_IO to provide an upper 
limit on the record size. SEQUENTIAL_IO imposes no limit on 
MAX_REC_SIZE. 

11. Implementation Limits 

The following limits are actually enforced by the inplemen- 
tation. It is not intended to imply that resources up to or 
even near these limits are available to every program. 

11.1. Line Length 

The implementation supports a maximum line length of 500 
characters including the end of line character. 

11.2. Record cind Array Sizes 

The maximum size of a statically sized array type is 
4,000,000 X ST0RAGE_UNITS. The meiximum size of a statically 
sized record type is 4,000,000 x STORAGE_UNITS. A record 
type or array type declaration that exceeds these limits 
will generate a warning message. 

11.3. Default Stack Size for Tasks 

In the absence of ein explicit STORAGE_SIZE length specifica¬ 
tion every task except the main program is allocated a fixed 
size stack of 10,240 STORAGE_UNITS. This is the value 
returned by T'STORAGE_SIZE for a task type T. 

11.4. Default Collection Size 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGE_SIZE length attribute 
the default collection size for an access type is 100 times 
the size of the designated type. This is the value returned 
by T'STORAGE_SIZE for an access type T. 

11.5. Limit on Declared Objects 

There is an absolute limit of 6,000,000 x STORAGE_UNITS for 
objects declared statically within a compilation unit. If 
this value is exceeded the compiler will terminate the com¬ 
pilation of the unit with a FATAL error message.
