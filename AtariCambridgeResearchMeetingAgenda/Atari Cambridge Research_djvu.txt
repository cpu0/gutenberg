Atari Cambridge Research 
Language Design Meeting 
October 6-7, 1982 

The following is a tentative schedule for the next two days. 

We would like to provide for the maximum amount of 

participation. At The same time we would like to have 

accomplished some tangible things by the end of the two days. 

Perhaps we should think of this as a working and planning 

session. It probably should be followed by a small group meeting 
in which things suggested now get specified into a language 

proposal which we can distribute for written comments.
