1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada inplementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: A, 
B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class to 
which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B and 
class L tests are expected to produce errors at ccxnpile time and link time, 
respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result \^en they 
are executed. Three Ada library xinits, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, 
euid the procedure CHECK FILE are used for this purpose. The package REP^tT 
also provides a set of Identity fvinctions used to defeat some compiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ai^ Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by scsne of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a conpiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting ccxnpilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Stetndard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code vdiich must not be flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada inplementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately coopiled units. Errors 
are expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
inplementation-specific values — for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in Appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen ccmflicts between the tests and 
inplementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this implementation are described in section 2.3. 


1-2 





iuntODucnoN 


For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by the 
AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications described in 
the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see section 2.1), and 
possibly removing some inapplicable tests (see section 2.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada inplementation must process each test of 
the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are irrelevant 
for a given Ai^ implementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may 
be supported by documents issued by the ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and commonly referenced in the format AI-<3dddd. For this 
in|}leroentation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Ccsmmentaries are included as 
appropriate.

C35713C, B86001U, and C86006G checlc for the predefined type 

L(M7_FL0AT; for this inplementation, there is no such type. 


C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with a 
name other than FLOAT, LONG_FLQAT, or SHORT_FLQAT; for this 
in^lementation, there is no such type. 


A35801E checks that FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST may be used as a range 
constraint in a floating-point type declaration; for this 
inplementation, that range exceeds the range of safe numbers of the 
largest predefined floating-point type and must be rejected. (See 
section 2.3.) 


C45531I1..P and C45532N..P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations for 
types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or greater; for this 
implementation, NAX_MANTISSA is less than 47. 

C45624A..B (2 tests) check that the proper exception is raised if 
MACHINEjOVERFLOWS is FALSE for floating point types and the results of 
various floating-point operations lie outside the range of the base 
type; for this iin)lementation, MACHINEjOVERFLOWS is TRUE. 

B86001Y uses the name of a predefined fixed-point type other than type 
DURATION; for this inplementation, there is no such type. 

C96005B uses values of type DURATION'S base type that are outside the 
range of type DURATION; for this implementation, the ranges are the 
same. 


CD1009C checks v^ether a length clause can specify a non-default size 
for a floating-point type; this in^lementation does not suf^rt such 
sizes.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 22 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
inpleroentation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the 
way expected by the original tests. 

B24009A B33301B B38003A B38003B B38009A 

B38009B B85008G B85008H BC1303F BC3005B 

BD2B03A BD2D03A BD4003A 


A35801E was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by 
the AVO. The conpiler rejects the use of the range 

FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST as the rauige constraint of a floating-point type 
declaration because the bounds lie outside of the range of safe numbers 
(cf. LRM 3.5.7:12). 

CD1009A, CD1009I, CD1C03A, CD2A24A, CD2A31A..0 (3 tests) were graded 
passed by Evaluation Modification as directed by the AVO. These tests use 
instantiations of the support procedure LENGTH_CHECK, v4iich uses 
Unchecked_Conversion according to the interpretation given in AI-00590. 

The AVO ruled that this interpretation is not binding under ACVC 1.11; the 
tests are ruled to be passed if they produce Failed messages only frcxn the 
instances of LENGTH_CHECK—i.e, the allowed Report.Failed messages have 
the general form: 

" * CHECK 04 REPRESENTATION FOR <1YPE ID> FAILED." 


AD9001B was graded passed by Test Modification as directed by the AVO. 
This test checks that no bodies are required for interfaced sxjli^rograins; 
among the procedures that it uses is one with a parameter of mode OUT 
(line 36). This implementation does not su{^rt pragma INTERFACE for 
procedures with parameters of mode OUT. The test was modified by 
commenting out line 36 and 40; the modified test was passed.

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a resxjlt was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard. 

The list of items below gives the number of ACVC tests in various 
categories. All tests were processed, except those that were withdrawn 
because of test errors (item b; see section 2.1), those that require a 
floating-point precision that exceeds the implementation's maximum 
precision (item e; see section 2.2), and those that depeixi on the support 
of a file system — if none is supported (item d). All tests passed, 
except those that are listed in sections 2.1 and 2.2 (counted in items b 
and f, below).

3.3 TEST E5CECUTI0N 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were loaded onto a Sun Workstation and copied over Ethernet 
to the host computer. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host computet, the ftjll set of 
tests was processed by the Ada inplementation. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the custraier and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a ccmoplete listing of 
the processing options for this inplementation. It also indicates the 
default options. Hie options invoked explicitly for validation testing 
during this test were: 


Option/Switch Effect, 


-w 


suppress generation of warning messages 


Test output, conpiler and linker listings, and job logs were captured on 
magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site by 
the validation team were also archived.

APPENDIX B 


COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


Ihe compiler options of this Ada inf)lementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer, unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to compiler docuMntation and 
not to this report. 


Syntax 

ada (options) (source_file]... (linker_options] 
[object_file.oj... 

Description 

The command ada executes the Ada con^iler and compiles the 
named Ada source file, ending with the .a suffix. The file 
must reside in a VADS library directory. The ada.lib file in 
this directory is modified after each Ada unit is compiled. 

The object for each conf>iled Ada unit is left in a file with 
the same name as that of the source with 01, 02, etc. 
substituted for .a. The -o option can be used to produce an 
executable with a name other than a.out, the default. For 
cross conpilers, the default name is a.vox. 

By default, ada produces only object and net files. If the 
-N option is used, the conf^iler automatically invokes a.Id 
and builds a conf>lete program with the named library unit as 
the main program. 

Non-Ada object files (.o files produced by a ccopiler for 
another language) may be given as arguments to ada. These 
files will be passed on to the linker and will be linked 
with the specified Ada object files. 

Command line options may be specified in any order, but the 
order of compilation and the order of the files to be passed 
to the linker can be significant. 


B-1 







CX3MPIIATI0N SYSTEM OPTIONS 


Several VADS compilers may be simultaneously available on a 
single system. Because the ada comnzknd in any 
VADS location/bin on a system will execute the correct 
conpTler components based \jpon visible library directives, 
the option -sh is provided to print the name of the 
conponents actually executed. 

Program listings with a disassembly of machine code 
instructions are generated by a.db or a.das. 

Cations 

-a file_name (archive) Treat file_name as an ar file. 

Since some archive files end with .a, -a is used to 
distinguish archive files from Ada source files. 

-d (dependencies) Analyse for dependencies only. Do not do 
semantic analysis or code generation. Update the library, 
marking any defined linits as unccmpiled. The -d opticxi is 
used Isy a.make to establish dependencies among new files. 

-e (error) Process compilation error messages using a.error 
and send it to standard output. Only the source lines 
containing errors are listed. Only one -e or -E option 
should be used. 


-E 


-E file 

-E directory (error output) Without a file or directory 
argument, ada processes error messages \ising a.error and 
directs a brief output to standard output; the raw error 
messages are left in ada_source.err. If a file pathname is 
given, the raw error messages are placed in that file. If a 
directory argument is supplied, the raw error output is 
placed in dir/source.err. The file of raw error messages 
can Ise used as input to a.error. 

-el (error listing) Intersperse error messages among source 
lines and direct to standard output. 


-El 


-El file 

-El directory (error listing) Same as the -E option, except that 
source listing with errors is produced. 

-ev (error vi(l)) Process syntax error messages using 
a.error, eid)ed them in the source file, and call the 
environment editor ERROR_EDITOR. (If ERPOR_EDITCXI is 
defined, the environment variable ERROR PATTERN should also 


B-2 






COMPILATIGN SYSTEM OPTIONS 


be defined. EEVROR_PATrEPN is an editor search comaand that 
locates the first occurrence of '#!#' in the error file.) If 
no editor is specified, call vi(l). 

-K (keep) Keep the intermediate language (IL) file 
produced by the con^iler front end. 

-L library_name (library) Operate in VADS library 
library_name (the current working directory is the default). 

-lfile_at^reviation (library search) This is an option 
passed to the UNIX linker, ld(l) telling it to search the 
specified library file. (No space between the -1 and the 
file aUDreviation.) 

For a description of the file aUsreviations, see also 
Operating system documentation, ld(l) 

-N unit_name (main) Produce an executable program using 
the named unit as the main program. The unit must be either 
a parameterless procedure or a parameterless function 
returning an integer. The executable program will be left in 
the file a.out unless overridden with the -o option. 

-M source_file (main) This option is like -M unit_name, except 
that the unit name is assumed to be the root ~ 
name of the .a file (for foo.a the unit is foo. Only one .a file 
may be preceded by -M. 

-o executable file (output) This option is to be used in 
conjunction with the -M option. executable_file is the name 
of the executable rather than the default a.out. 

-O[0-9] (optimize) Invoke the code optimizer (0PTIM2). An 
optional digit (there is no space before the digit) limits 
the nxsnber of passes by the optimizer: 

no -0 option, make one pass 

-O no digit, optimize as far as possible 

-OO prevents optimization 

-01 no hoisting 

-09 full optimization 

The addition of the INFO directive, 0PTIM3:INFO:TRUE, to the 
ada.lib will cause the conpiler to use a new optimizer (0PTIM3) 
that generates faster code. 

The default level of optimization for 0PTin3 is 04. Note 
that optimization levels for 0PTIN3 are more than simply 
additional iterations: 


B-3 






COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-O full optimization (same as OPTIM2 ada -09) 

-OO prevents optimization 

-01 no hoisting (same as 0PTIN2 ada -01} 

-02 no hoisting but more passes 

-03 no hoisting but even more passes 

-04 hoisting from loops 

-05 hoisting from loops but more passes 

-06 hoisting from loops with maximum passes 

-07 hoisting from loops and branches 

-08 hoisting from loops and branches, more passes 

-09 hoisting from loops and branches, meucimum passes 

Hoisting from branches (and cases alternatives) can be slow 
and does not always provide significant performance gains so 
it can be suppressed. 

For information on linker INFO directives see USER'S GUIDE, 
INFO Directive Names on page 

a.info on page , and for more information about 
optimization, see USER'S GUIDE, Con^iler Optimizations on 
page . 

-R VADS_library (recon^jile instantiation) Force analysis 
of all generic instantiations, causing reinstantiation of 
any that are out of date. 

-S (suj^ress) Apply pragma SUPPRESS to the entire 
con^ilation for all suppressible checks. 

-sh (show) Display the name of the tool executable but do 
not execute it. 

-T (timing) Print timing information for the compilation. 

-V (verbose) Print coitpiler version nunfcer, date and time 
of conpilation, name of file conf>iled, command input line, 
total ccxnpilation time, and error summary line. Storage 
usage information about the object file is provided. With 
0PTIM3 the output format of conpression (the size of 
optimized instructions) is as a percentage of input 
(unoptimized instructions). 


B-4 






CXVIPIIATIGN SYSTEM OPTIGMS 


-w (warnings) Suppress warning diagnostics. 

See also a.das on page ; a.db on page ; a.error on page ; 
a.Id on page ; a.mklib on page ; and Operating System 
reference documentation for the ld{l) utility. 

Diagnostics 

The diagnostics produced by the V)^S compiler are interxied 
to be self-explanatory. Most refer to the RM. Each RM reference 
includes a section number euid optionally, a paragraf^ number 
enclosed in parentheses. 


LINKER OPTIONS 

The linker options of this Ada inplementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to linker documentation and not 
to this report. 


Synteuc 

a.Id [options] unit_name [ld_options] 

Options 

-DX (debug) Debug memory overflow (use in cases where 
linking a large number of imits causes the error message 
local symbol overflow" to occur). 

-E unit name (elaborate) Elaborate unit_name as early in 
the elaEoration order as possible. 

-F (files) Print a list of dependent files in order and 
suppress linking. 

-L library_name (library) Operate in VADS library 
libraryjiame (the current working directory is the default). 

-o executable file (output) Use the specified file name as 
the name of tHe output rather than the default, a.out. 

-sh (show) Display the name of the tool executable but do 
not execute it. 

-U (units) Print a list of dependent units in order and 
suppress linking. 

-V (verbose) Print the linker ccnaroand before executing it. 


B-5 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-V (verify) Print the linker ccmnand but su^Jcess 
execution. 

Description 

a.Id collects the object files needed to meJce unit_naine a 
main program and calls theUNiX 
linker ld(l) to link together all Ada euid other leuiguage 
objects required to produce an executable image in a.out. 
unit name is the main program and must name a non-generic 
subprogram. If unit_name is a function, it must return a 
value of the type STANDARD.INTEGER. This integer resxjlt 
will be passed back to the UNIX 

shell as the status code of the execution. The utility uses 
the net files produced by the Ada conpiler to check 
dependency information, a.Id produces an exception mapping 
table and a unit elaboration table and passes this 
information to the linker. 

a.Id reads instructions for generating executables from the 
ada.lib file in the VADS libraries on the search list. 
Besides information generated by the compiler, these 
directives also include WITHn directives that allow the 
automatic linking of object modules conpiled frcrni other 
languages or Ada object modules not named in context clauses 
in the Ada source. Any number of WITHn directives may be 
placed into a library, but they must be numbered 
contiguously beginning at WITHl. The directives are recorded 
in the library's ada.lib file and have the following form. 

WITHl;LINK:object_file: 

WITH2:LINK:archive_file; 

WITHn directives may be placed in the local Ada libraries or 
in euiy VADS library on the search list. 

A WITHn directive in a local VADS library or earlier on the 
library search list will hide the same nxjmbered WITHn 
directive in a library later in the library search list. 

Use the tool a.info to change or report library directives 
in the current library. 

All arguments after unit_nanie are passed on to the linker. 
These may be options for it, archive libraries, library 
abbreviations, or object files. 

VADS_location/bin/a.Id is a wrapper program that executes 
the correct executable based upon directives visible in the 
ada.lib file. This permits multiple VADS compilers to exist 
on the same host. The -sh option prints the name of the 
actual executable file.

are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted otherwise, 
references in this Appendix are to conpiler documentation and not to this 
report. Implementation-specific portions of the package STANDARD, which

end STANDARD; 







APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


APPENDIX F. Inplementation-Dependent Characteristics 


1. Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 

1.1. INLINE_CNLY Pragma 

The INLINE_CXniY pragma, v^en used in the same way as pragma 
INLINE, indicates to the conpiler that the sxjbprogram must 
always be inlined. This pragma also suppresses the genera¬ 
tion of a calladDle version of the routine vhich saves code 
space. If a user erroneously makes an INLINEjQNLY sxjl^ro- 
gram recursive a warning message will be emitted and an 
PROGRAM_ERROR will be raised at run time. 

1.2. BUILT_IN Pragma 

The BUILT IN pragma is used in the inplementation of some 
predefines Ada packages, but provides no user access. It is 
used only to implement code b^ies for vhich no actual Ada 
body can be provided, for example the :i.waiNE_CODE package. 

1.3. SHARE_CODE Pragma 

The SHARE_CODE pragma takes the name of a generic instantia¬ 
tion or a generic unit as the first a’-gument and one of the 
identifiers TRUE or FALSE as the second argument. This 
pragma is only allowed immediately at the place of a 
declarative item in a declarative part or package specifica¬ 
tion, or after a library unit in a compilation, but before 
any siibsequent compilation unit. 

When the first argument is a generic unit the pragma applies 
to all instantiations of that generic. When the first argu¬ 
ment is the name of a generic instantiation the pragma 
applies only to the specified instantiation, or overloaded 
instantiations. 

If the second argument is TRUE the compiler will try to 
share code generated for a generic instantiation with code 
generated for other instantiations of the same generic. 
When the second argument is FALSE each instantiation will 
get a unique copy of the generated code. The extent to 
which code is shared between instantiations depends on this 
pragma and the kind of generic formal parameters declared 
for the generic unit. 

The name pragma SHARE_BODY is also recognized by the imple- 


C-2 







APPE34DIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


mentation and has the same effect as SHARE_CCX>E. It is 
included for compatability with earlier versions of VADS. 

1.4. NO_IMAGE Pragma 

Ttie pragma suppresses the generation of the image array used 
for the IMAGE attribute of enxjmeration types. This elim¬ 
inates the overhead required to store the array in the exe¬ 
cutable image. An attempt to use the IMAGE attribute on a 
type whose image array has been suppressed will result in a 
compilation warning and PROGRAM_EBROR raised at run time. 

1.5. EXTERNAL_NAME Pragma 

The EXTERNAL NAME pragma takes the name of a subprogram or 
variable defined in Ada and allows the user to specify a 
different external neune that may be used to reference the 
entity from other languages. Ibe pragma is allowed at the 
place of a declarative item in a package specification and 
must apply to an object declared earlier in the same package 
specification. 

1.6. INTERFACE_NAME Pragma 

The INTERFACE_NAME pragma takes the name of a a variable or 
subprogram defined in another language and allows it to be 
referenced directly in Ada. The pragma will replace all 
occurrences of the variable or subprogram name with an 
external reference to the second, link_argument. The pragma 
is allowed at the place of a declarative item in a package 
specification and must apply to an object or subprogram 
declared earlier in the same package specification. The 
object must be declared as a scalar or an access type. The 
object cannot be any of the following: 
a loop variable, 
a constant, 

an initialized varieible, 
an array, or 
a record. 

1.7. IMPLICIT_CX®E Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers CW or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies that inplicit code generated by the 
compiler be allowed or disallowed. A warning is issued if 
OFF is used and any implicit code needs to be generated. 
The default is ON. 


1.8. OPTIMIZE_ca)E Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers or OFF as the single argu- 


C-3 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies whether the code should be optim¬ 
ized by the compiler. The default is ON. When OFF is 
specified, the compiler will generate the code as specified. 

2. Implementation of Predefined Pragmas 

2.1. CONTROLLED 

This pragma is recognized by the inplementation but has no 
effect. 

2.2. ELABORATE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RN. 

2.3. INLINE 

This pragma is implemented as described in A{^ndix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.4. INTERFACE 

This pragma supports calls to 'C' and FORTRAN fxinctions. The 
Ada subprograms can be either functions or procedures. The 
types of parameters and the result type for functions must 
be scalar, access or the predefined type ADDRESS in SYSTEM. 
All par 2 uneters must have mode IN. Record and array objects 
can be passed by reference using the AESDRESS attribute. 

2.5. LIST 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RN. 

2.6. MEMORY_SIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the inplementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.7. NC»J_REENTRANT 

This pragma takes one argument vhich can be the name of 
either a library subprogram or a s\±iprogram declared immedi¬ 
ately within a library package spec or body. It indicates 
to the compiler that the subprogram will not be called 
recursively allowing the ccxopiler to perform specific optim¬ 
izations. The pragma can be applied to a subprogram or a 
set of overloaded subprograsm within a package spec or pack¬ 
age body. 


C-4 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


2.8. NOT_ELABORATED 

This pragma can only appear in a library package specifica¬ 
tion. It indicates that the package will not be elaborated 
because it is either part of the RTS, a configuration pack¬ 
age or an Ada package that is referenced frcmi a language 
other than Ada. The presence of this pragma suf^resses the 
generation of elaboration code and issues warnings if ela¬ 
boration code is required. 

2.9. OPTIMIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the inplementation but has no 
effect. 


2.10. PACK 

This pragma will cause the compiler to choose a non-aligned 
representation for composite types. It will not causes 
objects to be packed at the bit level. 

2.11. PAGE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 


2.12. PASSIVE 

The pragma has three forms : 

PRAGMA PASSIVE; 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(SEMAPHORE); 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(INTERRUPT, <number>); 


This pragma Pragma passive can be applied to a task or task 
type declared immi^iately within a library package spec or 
b^y. The pragma directs the compiler to optimize certain 
tasking operations. It is possible that the statements in a 
task body will prevent the intended optimization, in these 
cases a warning will be generated at ccxipile time and will 
raise TASKING_ERROR at runtime. 

2.13. PRIORITY 

This pragma is implemented as described in i^pendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.14. SHARED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 


C-5 





AFPEM)IX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


2.15. STORAGE_UNIT 

liiis pragma is recognized by the implementation. Ihe imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recmpiled. 

2.16. SUPPRESS 

This pragma is implemented as described, except that 
DIVISION C31ECK and in some cases OVERFLOWjCHECK cannot be 
supresseH. 

2.17. SYSTEM_NAME 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be reccm^iiled. 

3. Implementation-Dependent Attributes 

3.1. P'REF 

For a prefix that denotes aui object, a program unit, a 
label, or an entry: 

This attribute denotes the effective address of the first of 
the storage units allocated to P. For a subprogram, pack¬ 
age, task unit, or label, it refers to the address of the 
machine code associated with the corresponding body or 
statement. For an entry for vhich an address clause has 
been given, it refers to the corresponding hardware inter¬ 
rupt. The attribute is cf the type OPERAND defined in the 
package MACHINE_CODE. The attribute is only allowed within 
a machine code procedure. 

See section F.4.8 for more information on the use of this 
attribute. 

(For a package, task unit, or entry, the 'REF attribute is 
not supported.) 


3.2. T'TASKID 

For a task object or a value T, T'TASK_ID yields the unique 
task id associated with a task. The value of this attribute 
is of the type AEXSRESS in the package SYSTEM.

5. Restrictions On Representation Clauses 
5.1. Pragma PACK 

In the absence of pragma PACK record components are padded 
so as to provide for efficient access by the target 


C-8 




APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


hardware, pragma PACK applied to a record eliminate the pad¬ 
ding where possible. Pragma PACK has no other effect on the 
storage allocated for record coaf>onents a record representa¬ 
tion is required. 

5.2. Size Clauses 

For scalar types a representation cla\jise will pack to the 
number of bits required to represent the range of the siib- 
type. A size clause applied to a record type will not cause 
packing of components; an explicit record representation 
clause must be given to specify the packing of the com¬ 
ponents. A size clause applied to a record type will cause 
packing of ccmfxjnents only vdien the cooponent type is a 
discrete type. An error will be issued if there is insuffi¬ 
cient space allocated. The SIZE attribute is not su{^rted 
for task, access, or floating point types. 


5.3. Address Clauses 

Address clauses are only supported for variables. Since 
default initialization of a variable requires evaluation of 
the variable address elaboration ordering requirements 
prohibit inititalization of a variables \diich have address 
clauses. The specified address indicates the {^ysical 
address associated with the variable. 

5.4. Interrupts 

Interupt entries are not supported. 

5.5. Representation Attributes 

The AEMDRESS attribute is not supported for the following 
entities: 

Packages 

Tasks 

Labels 

Entries 


5.6. Machine Code Insertions 
Machine code insertions are supported. 

The general definition of the package NACHINE_CODE provides 
an assendaly language interface for the target machine. It 
provides the necessary record type(s) needed in the code 
statement, an enumeration type of all the opcode nneumonics, 
a set of register definitions, and a set of addressing mode 
functions. 


C-9 







APPEM)IX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


The general synteuc of a machine code statement is as fol¬ 
lows: 


CCX)E__n'( opcode, operand (, operand) ); 

where n indicates the nianber of operands in the aggregate. 

A special case arises for a variable ntanber of operands. 
The operands are listed within a subaggregate. The format 
is as follows: 

CCX)E_N'( opcode, (operand {, operand}) ); 

For those opcodes that require no operands, named notation 
must be used (cf. RN 4.3(4)). 

CX»E_0'( op ■> opcode ); 

The opcode must be an enumeration literal (i.e. it cemnot be 
an object, attribute, or a rename). 

An opereuid C 2 m only be aui entity defined in NACHINE_CC^ or 
the 'REF attribute. 

The arguments to any of the functions defined in 
MACHINE_CCX)E must be static expressions, string literals, or 
the fxjnctions defined in MAC3!INE_CX)DE. The 'REF attribute 
may not be used as an argument in any of these functions. 

Inline expansion of machine code procedures is supported. 

6. Conventions for Implementation-generated Names 
There are no implementation-generated names. 

7. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clauses 

Address expressions in an address clause are interpreted as 
physical addresses. 

8. Restrictions on Unchecked Conversions 
None. 

9. Restrictions on unchecked Deallocations 
None. 


10. Implementation Characteristics of I/O Packages 

Instantiations of DIRECT_IO use the value MAX REC_SIZE as 
the record size (expressed in STORAGE UNITS) ^en the size 


C-10 





APPENDIX F OF IHE Ada STANDARD 




of ELQ1ENr_TyPE exceeds that value. For exasple for uncon¬ 
strained arrays such as string \diere ELE3lElir_TXPE'SIZE is 
very large, MAX_REC_SIZE is used instead. MAX_REOQRD_SIZE 
is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a program before 
instantiating DIRECT_IO to provide an upper limit on the 
record size. In any case the maximum size supported is 1024 
X 1024 X ST0RA£2:_UNIT bits. DIRECT_IO will raise USE_ERROR 
if MAX_REC_SIZE exceeds this absolute limit. 

Instantiations of SEQUENriAL_IO use the value MAX_REC_SIZE 
as the record size (expressed in STORACSJUNITS) when the 
size of ELEMENr_TyPE exceeds that value. For example for 
unconstrained arrays such as string where ELEMENT_TyPE'SIZE 
is very large, MAX REC_SIZE is used instead. 
MAX_RECORD SIZE is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a 
program before instantiating IMTEGER_IO to provide an upper 
limit on the record size. SBQUEm'IAL_IO imposes no limit on 
MAX_REC_SIZE. 

11. Implementation Limits 

The following limits are actually enforced 1:^ the implemen¬ 
tation. It is not intended to inply that resources up to or 
even near these limits are available to every progreun. 

11.1. Line Length 

The implementation supports a maximum line length of 500 
characters including tile end of line character. 

11.2. Record and Array Sizes 

The maximum size of a statically sized array type is 
4,000,000 X STORAGE_UNITS. The maximum size of a statically 
sized record type is 4,000,000 x STORAGEJUNITS. A record 
type or array type declaration that exceeds these limits 
will generate a warning message. 

11.3. Default Stack Size for Tasks 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGE_SIZE length specifica¬ 
tion every task except the main program is allocated a fixed 
size stack of 10,240 STORAGEJUNITS. This is the value 
returned by T'STORAGE_SIZE for a task type T. 

11.4. Default Collection Size 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGE_SIZE length attribute 
the default collection size for an access type is 100 times 
the size of the designated type. This is the value returned 
by T'STC»AGE_SIZE for an access type T. 

11.5. Limit on Declared Objects 


C-11 






APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


There is eui ad^solute limit of 6,000,000 x STORAGEJONITS for 
objects declared statically within a caipilation xinit. If 
this value is exceeded the conpiler will terminate the com¬ 
pilation of the unit with a FATAL error message.
