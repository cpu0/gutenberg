WHAT CAN A COMPUTER DO FOR YOU? 



You and the Computer 

Asking people what a computer can do for them brings a wide range of responses. Some 
people think first of the dramatic uses of the computer which we have seen on television 
news. Televised reports on the latest space flight show Mission Control and a room filled with 
computers. A research center's computers provide the background for a television 
announcer's report on a new life-saving medical technique. We hear election returns— and 
the computer's projections of the outcome of the election. Even though these events are far 
from our daily experience, television has made us aware of the power of the computer. 

Although the dramatic uses of the computer are often thought of first, other people respond 
to questions about what the computer can do for them by noticing things in everyday life. We 
go to the bank in the evening and push a few buttons to make a deposit or to transfer funds 
from one account to another. We buy groceries, and computers at the checkout counter 
respond to the barcoded price on a package and record the price on our grocery bill— and 
on the store's inventory list. 

Computers keep track of warehouse inventories, place orders for more materials, and send 
out bills. Computers prepare our bank statements and record the charges made on credit 
cards. The computer has become a common, almost unnoticed part of our everyday lives. 

Businessmen and women use word-processing software to send a personal letter to each 
customer by simply changing the inside address. People who run typing services make use 
of word-processing packages to improve their servfces and decrease their costs. Other 
software packages record customers' names and addresses on a mailing list which can be 
updated without retyping the entire list. 

Individuals owning small businesses are not the only ones who can profit by using a personal 
computer. Home management requires sophisticated record-keeping and decision-making 
skills. Personal computers using software packages selected to meet individual needs can 
make the financial tasks involved in managing a home easier. 

The same software package which provides information for a businessperson making 
decisions about borrowing money helps individuals planning to buy a car or a home 
determine which loan is the best financial decision. Keeping records of tax-related expenses 
can be made less difficult with a personal computer which calculates at the end of the tax 
year entries made throughout the year. Software packages also simplify keeping an inventory 
of household property because items can be added— and deleted— easily. Software packages 
can even assist with the monthly task of balancing a checkbook. 

The Personal Computer 

Some people do not think of the large computers used in space flights, in banking, or in bus- 
iness when they are asked what the computer can do for them. They think instead of the 
small personal computer which they can use in their homes. For these people, the answer to 
the question "What can a computer do for you? "brings a different response. It can do what I 
want it to do.

. . .In Homes 

The personal computer is designed to meet the needs of the people who use it The personal 
computer is "user friendly." It can be used tjy people who have never programmed a 
computer as well as by sophisticated users. The personal computer can respond to a com- 
puter language such as BASIC or to software packages which are preprogrammed. The 
personal computer is a convenient size for home use, requiring only a table or desk to hold 
the system. As the microcomputer has brought reduction in size of computers, it has also 
brought lower costs, which make ownership by individuals possible. Because of the personal 
computer's flexibility, the question "^at can a computer do for you? "brings answers as 
diverse as the people who are asked. 

...in Business 

Men and women with small businesses take advantage of the low cost and convenience of 
the personal computer to handle many aspects of their businesses. Software packages keep 
track of inventory and cash flow. Software cartridges compute interest charges and help pro- 
vide information necessary to make good decisions about borrowing and lending in a period 
of rapidly changing interest rates. Business people also use software programs to keep 
records of business-related expenses and calculate totals for each type of expense. 

. .for Education 

Not only can the personal computer make life easier for us In business and in homes, but it 
can also enrich our lives. Software packages in statistics or real estate management can 
provide both tools for our work and practice with a new subject. Software packages can help 
us learn how to program in a computer language so that we can create our own computer 
programs. We can even buy computer programs designed to help us learn such things as 
typing and chess. 

Children, in particular, enjoy the new opportunities for learning available t)ecause of the 
persona! computer. Children can create programs on the computer using LOGO, a 
programming language designed to appeal to children because of its exciting graphics and 
its ease of use. Computers can offer additional benefits to young learners. Many of the 
subjects which children need to learn require hours of drill and practice. Although practicing 
multiplication tables may not be exciting, it's fun to shoot an alien spaceship carrying a 
multiplication problem by firing a missile with the correct answer. Computers can be 
programmed to evaluate the number of errors being made by a child and can adjust the level 
of difficulty of the problems being presented to the child. 

. . .for Entertainment 

Personal computers help us with our businesses, with home management, and with educational 
enrichment, but they are also fun. We can have all the excitement of video games In our own 
homes. We can have a chess opponent who is always ready to play— and who will play at the 
level of skill we choose. With the correct software, the computer will play with us whether the 
game is bridge or blackjack. 

You and the Personal Computer 

The personal computer deserves its name. It is a computer for personal needs. Before you 
can answer the question "What can the computer— the personal computer— do for you", you 
will need to ask yourself a question. What are the things I need done? Help in my business? 
Record-keeping and home management information? Educational opportunities available in 
my home? Entertainment for my family and friends? When you think about what you want 
done and what the personal computer can do for you, you may decide that the personal 
computer Is your computer.

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 



In order to communicate with a computer, we must use programming languages which both 
the computer and the operator can understand. There are several languages available for 
use— each with special capabilities and purposes. Listed below are several of the most com- 
mon. 

BASIC stands for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. It is the most popular 
programming language in use today, as it is very much like our own English language. As 
with English, one may encounter several dialects of BASIC. The TI-99/4A dialect is called Tl 
BASIC, and it gives your computer a full range of programming capability for most home and 
personal applications. 

Tl Extended BASIC provides more complex capability for business and professional soft- 
ware. It will enable you to produce moving, animated graphics on the screen which is not 
possible with Tl BASIC. Tl Extended BASIC allows faster execution and provides access to 
the Memory Expansion Unit, thereby increasing the amount of information your computer 
can process. 

Tl LOGO is designed especially for children who are just becoming familiar with computers. 
Its simple, easy-to-learn commands allow you to progress from sketching, animated gra- 
phics, and writing, to mathematics and complex problem solving. Tl LOGO lets you expe- 
rience the world of computer programming through self-paced exploration and discovery. 

PILOT stands for Programmed Inquiry, Learning, Or Teaching. This programming language 
is used for educational program development for Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) and is 
readily learned by instructors for classroom use. Instructors use PILOT to create programs 
which demonstrate concepts, simulate laboratory-like environments, and provide individual- 
ized drill, practice, and testing. 

Pascal gives access to a large library of professional and technical programs. Relatively easy 
to read and understand, it is designed to run on various types of computer systems. The 
TI-g9/4A system utilizes th^TI P-code Card peripheral and the UCSD p-System* Compiler 
software to translate input in UCSD Pascal* directly into the native machine instruction lan- 
guage compatible with the computer. 

Tl FORTH is an advanced programming language. Compact and powerful, it also has the 
capability to use Assembly subroutines. Although easier to learn and use than Assembly, 
detailed programming knowledge is necessary for utilization of Tl FORTH. 

Assembly (TMS9900) is very similar to machine language. Commands written in Assembly 
language need not be interpreted by the computer to machine code. Therefore, programs 
run much faster than when entered in high-level languages (languages using everyday words 
such as BASIC). Because detailed knowledge of Assembly language is necessary in order to 
utilize the language, beginning programmers usually start with a higher-level language.

PRACTICE PROGRAMS 



Now, let* s try running a couple of simple programs just to see how they work and what they 
can do. Get into Tl BASIC by turning the computer on and pressing any to go to the 
Master Selection List Press 1 for Tl BASIC and type the following program, pressing ENTER 
at the end of each line. (If you make a mistake, press the FCTN and S keys to backspace to 
the error and type over the error to correct it.) 

10 CALL CLEAR 

20 PRINT "HELLO. I AM THE TI-99/4A" 
30 PRINT ::::: 
40 GOTO 20 

Now type RUN and press ENTER. What happened? Press FCTN 4 (CLEAR) to stop the pro- 
gram. Type EDIT 20 and press ENTER. Using FCTN S or FCTN D to move the cursor, 
change the wording between quotation marks by typlng^ver the old text. When finished, 
press ENTER. Now, RUN the program again and note what happens. 

When you type RUN and press ENTER after typing a program, the screen should turn green 
and the program should begin. If the computer beeps and prints an error message on the 
screen, you probably have a "bug" somewhere in your program! "Bugs" are usually caused 
by typographical errors. SOLUTION: Type LIST and press ENTER to view the program in 
memory. Check each line closely for errors. If an error is found, type EDIT 10 (or whichever 
line number contains the error) and press ENTER. Correct the error after using the arrow 
keys (FCTN S, FCTN D) and the space bar to move the cursor to the error. Press ENTER 
when the corrections are completed, then RUN the program. 

Type NEW and press ENTER before entering another program. The following program helps 
demonstrate color combinations on the screen. 

NEW 

10 CALL CLEAR 

20 INPUT "SELECT A NUMBER FROM 3 TO 16 THEN PRESS ENTER: ":S 

30 INPUT "SELECT A NUMBER FROM 1 TO 16 THEN PRESS ENTER: ":F 

40 INPUT "SELECT A NUMBER FROM 1 TO 16 THEN PRESS ENTER: ":B 

50 CALL CLEAR 

60 CALL SCREEN(S) 

70 CALL COLOR(2,F,B) 

80 CALL HCHAR(1 2,3,42.28) 

90 GOTO 20 

RUN 

Type RUN and press ENTER to execute the program. To stop the program, press FCTN 
4(CLEAR).

COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS 



1 . Question: Will the console work with my television set? 

Answer Yes. The TI-99/4A console can be connected to a television set by means of 
the TI-900 video modulator. 

2. Question: Will it work like a typewriter or a word processor? 

Answer Yes. The TI-99/4A with the Typing Tutor or the Tl-Writer cartridges can func- 
tion as a typing or word processing tool. 

3. Question: Will it drive a large printer? 
Answer Yes. With the RS-232 Interface card, using the j ^ 
serial port, it will drive any printer that can be driven ^ ( }y 



via the RS-232 standard. For printers with parallel 
connection, consult the printer's manual and the 
RS-232 manual. 



4. Question: Can I do fine line graphics? 

Answer Yes. The screen resolution of the monitor Is a 192 by 256 dot matrix. Each dot 
(pixel) on the screen can be individually addressed by programming. 

5. Question: Can I edit or change the solid state cartridges? 

Answer No. The solid state cartridges are programs locked in integrated circuit chips. 
The user cannot alter them. The only exception is the specially designed Mini Memory 
cartridge. 

6. Question: What is the Mini Memory cartridge? 

Answer It is a cartridge which is designed for program storage. It will retain data for the 
life of its battery even if the console is turned off or if the cartridge is removed. It gives 
full support of the 16 BIT Assembly language with debugger using the Editor/ 
Assembler manual. 

7. Question: Is system documentation (schematics) available? 
Answer Yes. For documentation, write to: 

Texas Instruments 
c/o The Dealer Parts Dept. 
P.O. Box 53 
Lubbock, Texas 79408 

8. Question: What is the power consumption of the console and the monitor? 

Answer The power consumption of the console plus the monitor is about the same as a 
150-watt light bulb. 

9. Question: Can you connect it to large computer data bases? 

Answer Yes. With the telephone coupler (modem), Terminal Emulator II solid state car- 
tridge, and the RS-232 Interface card, you can access large data bases such as 
Mtcronet, The Source, Compusen/e, Dow Jones, Texnet (a special edition of The 
Source forTI-99/4A users), etc. 



12 



10. Question: Is it durable? Will it withstand electrical shoci( via static electricity, keyboard 
abuse, etc.? 

Answen We have produced what is probably the most durable computer that's ever 
been made. We applied all we have learned from our years of experience in building 
handheld calculators to the TI-99/4A. For example. It has been designed to withstand a 
static electricity shock in excess of 50,000 volts with no physical damage to the com- 
puter. The only change occurring at that particular point is that some data \^ RAM may 
be changed or lost. As far as physical abuse to the keyboard, it's probably one of the 
most rugged keyboards that's ever been put into any computer. The key mechanism 
itself was designed to be used in a desk top commercial calculator. These calculators 
receive thousands of keystrokes per day. We have a very durable, very hard to hurt 
computer. It's been designed to operate under conditions far in excess of those you 
would ever encounter in your home. 

1 1 . Question: What is the warranty? 

Answer If the computer fails within the first thirty days because of defective materials or 
workmanship, it will be replaced free of charge. For the remainder of the warranty 
period, the computer will be replaced for a small fee. There are 42 exchange centers 
located around the United States where you can exchange your out-of-warranty com- 
puter for a working computer for a small fee. These are the same repair and exchange 
centers that currently handle our calculator products. 

1 2. Question: Is the RAM really 1 6K? 

Answer Some computers have only 5K RAM or less. Ours starts with 16K, expandable 
up to a potent 52K. 52K of RAM on the TI-99/4A actually gives you as much usable 
room for your programs as many "64K" computers. In fact, when you consider that Tl 
command cartridges can contain up to 36K in program (like Tl Extended BASIC and 
Video Chess) and that the Tl home computer has 26K ROM for user friendliness, you 
can have a total of 11 OK of memory and program power! And if that weren't impressive 
enough, the Tl home computer has a 16 bit microprocessor chip! No other home com- 
puter can make this statement. 

13. Question: Other than BASIC in what languages can I program? 

Answer With the correct peripherals, the computer can work in Pascal, Tl LOGO, 
PILOT, FORTH, Tl Extended BASIC, and Assembly. 

14. Question: Is there any package like Visicalc that will let me set up financial models? 
Answer Microsoft has written Multiplan for the TI-99/4A. The program can do many of 
the same things as Visicalc, plus a few extras. 

1 5. Question: Is there any way to get 80 colurfin width on the screen? 

Answer Yes, eighty columns are possible using Microsoft Multiplan™*, Tl Writer, Editor/ 
Assembler, Tl Forth and through the UCSD Pascal system (the screen only views 40 
columns at a time, but it is possible to scroll to see the rest).

16. Question: Can the computer do things for my home— turn on lights, regulate the 
temperature, control burglar alarms, etc.? 

Answer At the present time the only things standing between these sorts of functions 
and our computer are simple peripheral devices that will plug into the computer. 

17. Question: How much information can I store on a diskette? A cassette? Mini Memory 
Cartridge? 

Answer About OOK bytes of data can be stored per disl(ette, which is about the same as 
90,000 keystrokes of information (per diskette, per drive). Double-sided diskettes hold 
180K bytes. A 60-minute cassette tape can hold up to 200K bytes. A Mini Memory car- 
tridge will hold 4K bytes of RAM memory using a battery pack. 

1 & Question: What type of diskettes do I need to use with a Tl disk system? 

Answer The Tl disk system requires 5V4 inch, single-sided density, 40 track, soft- 
sectored diskettes. 

19. Question: Can I use a double-sided diskette with my disk drive system? 

Answer A double-sided diskette may be used with a double-sided disk drive. The Disk 
Manager II Cartridge is required (packaged with the Tl Disk Controller Card). 

20. Question: What is double density? 

Answer Double density allows about twice as many bytes of information per track, 
almost doubling diskette storage of data 

21 . Question: Is there a magazine that specifically gives information on the TI-99/4A? 
Answer 99'er Home Computer magazine does. You can subscribe by writing to:
