1.0 SCOPE OF DOCUMENT 

The purpose of this document is to describe a 
dexterous hand recently developed at NASA 
Goddard Space Flight Center. The hand (the 
Anthrobot-2) is a fully functional, tendon-driven, 
five-fingered robot hand. A patent on the design 
has been applied for. This document gives an 
overview of the mechanical structure of the hand, 
the electronics, and the system software. The 
appendices give further information on interfaces 
developed between some commercial exoskeletal 
gloves and the hand. Details on interfacing to the 
Anthrobot will be part of another document. A list 
of vendors for the various commercial products is 
included. This list does not constitute an 
endorsement by either the authors or the U.S. 
Government. 

2.0 INTRODUCTION 

2.1 Areas of Use 

In robotic applications, the choice of end effector is 
a choice between special purpose end effectors and 
general purpose end effectors. Examples of 
special purpose end effectors include two-jaw 
grippers, motorized screwdrivers, and spray 
nozzles. Multifingered hands comprise the family 
of general-purpose end effectors. A dexterous 
hand has more flexibility when coping with 
unforeseen situations and unstructured 
environments than the special purpose end 
effectors. A robot using special purpose end 
effectors requires an effector for each different 
task. As the number of tasks grows so does the 
number of effectors needed. Conversely, if the 
end effector cannot be changed, then the 
manipulated object must accommodate the end 
effector. This may involve specialized design of 
the object or addition of a special attachment point 
to an existing design. 

In contrast to the specialized end effectors, a robot 
with a dexterous hand can accommodate a variety 
of tasks more easily. We expect that the Anthrobot 
will find application in areas where a robot has to 
perform multiple tasks in an unstructured 
environment. A study by Mishkin and Jau [1988] 
discusses the advantages that a hand would have 
over several types of end effectors during extra- 
vehicular activities (EVA) in space. The Anthrobot 
will also be the preferred choice where unexpected 
events can take place. A robot hand which 


features anatomical consistency with a human hand 
will have special advantages during teleoperation. 

From a teleoperation control perspective, a human 
will find it easier to control a robot hand which 
functions like his or her own hand. The closer the 
robot hand follows the human anatomy, the easier 
it will be for a person to control it. One scenario is 
an emergency situation where a person must be 
able to perform a teleop task quickly and with little 
previous training. In this case, the user puts on an 
exoskeletal system (including a glove), attaches the 
hand to the robot, and performs the task in an 
intuitive manner. Another advantage is where the 
environment requires human as well as robotic 
interaction. If the robot uses an anthropomorphic 
hand, the human interfaces will work for the robot. 
Mishkin and Jau [1988] discuss several advantages 
of an anthropomorphic hand when performing 
tasks in space. 

2.2 Previous Work 

Research in the design of mechanical hands dates 
back to at least 1960, if not earlier. Some early 
examples can be found in Tomovic and Boni 
[1962], Okada [1979], Caporali [1982], and the 
following U.5?patents: Gentiluomo [1967], Mullen 
[1972], Eroyan [1978], Pinson [1981], 
Zarudiansky [1981], and Richter [1986]. The 
number of fingers in these hands vary from three to 
five. Probably the most famous of the three 
fingered hands is that of Salisbury and Ruoff 
[1990]. Some more recent examples of hands with 
four or more fingers include the Utah/MIT hand by 
Jacobsen, et al. [1986], the Dexter IIIB by 
Smallridge [1989], the JPL four-fingered end 
effector by Jau [1990], the Mark-1 by Maeda 
[1989], and the Belgrade/USC hand described by 
Rao, et al. [1988] and Bekey, et al. [1990]. The 
Belgrade/USC hand is based on the hand by 
Tomovic and Boni [1962] referenced earlier. A 
table in Appendix C compares the Anthrobot-2 
with these other five hands. 

2.3 Benefits of Approach 

In comparison with the hands discussed in the 
previous section, the Anthrobot is specifically 
designed for anatomical consistency with the 
human hand. This includes the number of fingers, 
the placement and motion of the thumb, the 
proportions of the link lengths, and the shape of 
the palm. The designers of the hands discussed 


1 



above either ignored or compromised on these 
factors. 

In the human hand, we have an existence proof of 
a structure which is capable of supporting a wide 
variety of dexterous manipulation tasks. The 
philosophy behind the Anthrobot-2 is to provide 
these capabilities to a robot hand by closely 
following the human model. This approach has 
clear advantages for teleoperation. It remains to be 
seen if the anthropomorphic model provides any 
advantages over non-anthropomorphic end 
effectors for autonomous control. However, non- 
anthropomorphic designs require theoretical 
analysis to prove that they support dexterous tasks, 
whereas an anthropomorphic dexterous end 
effector has centuries of empirical evidence to 
support the validity of the design approach. 

2.4 Evolution of the Anthrobot 

In 1988, Charles Engler built a working, five- 
fingered robot hand (the Anthrobot- 1) for his 
Master's research at Lehigh University. Engler 
and Groover [1989] summarizes his results. Mr. 
Engler came to Goddard in 1988. In 19 90, the 
Director's Discretionary Fund at Goddard provided 
funds to build a second-generation prototype hand 
(Anthrobot-2). This hand is lighter, smaller, easier 
to assemble, and more anatomically correct than the 
original. It also features improved electronics and 
software for servo control and computer 
interfacing. Two of the Anthrobot-2s (left and 
right hands) will be complete by the summer of 
1991. 

3.0 SYSTEM OVERVIEW 

Figure 1 shows a drawing of the Anthrobot-2 with 
views from the top and side. A third auxiliary 
view shows the front of the palm. The hand has 
four fingers and a thumb. Each finger has four 
joints as in the human hand; two at the knuckle 
(lateral and vertical motion), one between the 
proximal and middle finger segments, and one 
between the middle and distal finger segments. 
The thumb has four degrees-of-freedom (DOF), 
allowing it to emulate human thumb motion. The 
human thumb has two joints which provide the 
curling action, and a saddle joint which allows the 
thumb to oppose the other fingers. The saddle 
joint actually has two degrees-of-freedom, bringing 
the total number of thumb DOF to four. The 
Anthrobot emulates the saddle joint with two pulley 


driven links. The placement of the links 
determines the fidelity of the Anthrobot thumb 
motion to human thumb motion. 

Futaba servomotors actuate the finger and thumb 
joints. Radio-controlled model hobbyists use these 
servomotors in their model boats and airplanes. 
Notice that while there are twenty joints in the hand 
(four for each of the fingers and four for the 
thumb), there are only sixteen servomotors. Like 
the human hand, in this hand the last (distal) joint 
of each finger is connected to the middle joint. 
This reduces the controllable degrees of motion 
from twenty to sixteen. Further specifications on 
the Futaba servos are in section 6. 

The servomotors actuate the fingers via a system of 
tendons modeled after those in the human hand. 
Each motor has a pulley mounted on it. Two 
cables (tendons) attach to this pulley. Each cable 
then runs through the palm to either side of a joint 
mounted pulley which actuates a given joint. 
Clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the 
servomotor therefore provides the necessary 
motion for the fingers and thumb. Adjustment 
screws in the actuator housing maintain cable 
t e ns ion. 

Another key area in this design is the palm. In the 
top view, notice that where the fingers meet the 
palm has a curve similar to the human hand. The 
auxiliary view shows another human-like curvature 
of the palm. Although the two degree-of-freedom 
wrist is shown, the motors and pulley drive system 
for it are not. The wrist will use standard industrial 
motors as opposed to the Futaba servos because of 
torque requirements. These systems were under 
development at the time this document was written. 
The entire package is designed to fit on the end of a 
variety of industrial robots. Further specifications 
on the mechanical structure are in section 5. 

An overall system diagram is shown in Figure 2. 
The complete system consists of an IBM PC/AT or 
compatible microcomputer, an interface board, and 
the Anthrobot. The interface board is a pulse 
generator board which sends the appropriate 
signals to the Futaba servos. Eventually, the hand 
will include electronics such that any system (IBM, 
Macintosh, VME, etc.) with an analog/digital I/O 
board can run the hand. Optionally, operation of 
the hand in a master/slave mode is available via an 
Exos Dexterous Hand Master or a Nintendo Power 
Glove (see section 7 and Appendices A and B).

5.0 MECHANICAL DESCRIPTION 

The Anthrobot is designed to have the same size 
and shape as the human hand. The linkage 
proportions are based on data from the U.S. Air 
Force (see Garrett [1971]), the U.S. Army 
(Gordon et al. [1989]), and some in-house 
measurements. The proportions reflect those given 
for the 50th percentile male armed forces recruit. 
The dimensions for the hand (not including the 
actuator housing and wrist) arc: 


1. Length: 7.5 in. 

2. Width: 3.5 in. 

3. Thickness: 1.1 in. max. 

The entire package-meaning the hand structure, 
wrist, and actuators-will fit on the end of a variety 
of industrial manipulators. The package weight is 
about 10 pounds. The mechanical structure 
currently is 6061-T6 aluminum. The use of other 
materials (plastics, space alloys, etc.) is possible. 
Optionally, fingertips made of a urethane/leather 
laminate can replace the aluminum fingertips. The 
tendons consist of 0.025-inch-diameter Technora 
fiber cables sheathed in Teflon tubing. The 
Technora fiber has an ultimate tensile strength of 
150 pounds. An epoxy resin bonds the Technora 
fiber to the finger joint pulleys. The tendons are 
housed in coiled steel springs which attach to the 
structure of the fingers. 

6.0 ELECTRONICS DESCRIPTION 

6.1 Servomotor Packages 

6.1.1 Finger and Thumb Servos 

As shown in Figure 1, the hand uses 14 
Futaba FP-S125 servo motors for the fingers and 
two of the thumb joints. Two of the more 
powerful Futaba S134G motors control the 
remaining two axes of the thumb. The servos have 
the following features (see Futaba [1989]): 

FP-S125 Arm-type sail control servo 

rotation: 140 degrees (max.) 
size: 0.88" X 1.75" X 1.69" 
weight: 2.3 oz. 
output torque: 129.3 oz./in. 
speed: 0.62 sec./60 degrees 

FP-S 134G Quarter scale retract 

rotation: 140 degrees (typ.) 
size: 1.14" X 2.32" X 1.97" 
weight: 2.8 oz. 
output torque: 173.8 oz./in. 
speed: 0.33 sec./60 degrees 

The servo package includes a motor , gear train, a 
potentiometer, and servo electronics. A position 
command consists of sending a pulse of the proper 
duration every 1/60 second. The PC therefore 
controls the servos in an open-loop fashion. Our 
eventual plan is to remove the Futaba servo 
electronics and close-loop control the servo 


5 



package via an analog and digital I/O board in a PC 
or any other similarly equipped computer system. 

6. 1 .2 Wrist Servos 

The wrist servomotors are currendy under 
development 

6.2 Pulse Generator Board 

The pulse generator board (the PC-CTR-20) 
creates the pulses needed to command the Futaba 
servos. The board is a commercially available unit 
from OMEGA Engineering, Inc. which plugs into 
the backplane slot of any IBM PC or compatible. 
The board contains four AMD9513 counter/timer 
chips with five counter/timers each, for a total of 
20 outputs. The board has a number of modes 
which enable it to perform a variety of pulse 
generation, pulse timing, and interrupt functions. 
Commanding the Futaba servos requires the so- 
called "mode J." In this mode, two registers for 
each output define the width of the pulse and the 
frequency at which pulses are sent. The frequency 
of the pulses is a constant-typically 60-80 Hz 
(every 16-14 ms). The width of the pulse is the 
commanded position. For the FP-S125, a width 
varying between 1 and 2 ms wide corresponds to a 
position of -/+ 70 degrees. OMEGA f 1989] gives 
more information on the PC-CTR-20 board and the 
modes. 

6.3 Computer 

The computer is an IBM PC compatible. The main 
reason for using a PC was the availability of the 
pulse generator board for the PC (see previous 
section). The microprocessor is a 20-MHz 80286. 
This processor is adequate for the current system 
which controls the servos by open-loop. 
Eventually, the microcomputer will close the 
position loops. We expect to close these loops (a 
total of sixteen) with a bandwidth of 5 to 10 Hz. 
The processing ability of the 80286 should be 
adequate for this requirement. Closing the loops 
requires replacing the pulse generator board with 
an analog/digital I/O board. This type of board is 
available for PCs as well as Macintoshes, Suns, 
Multibus I and II, VME cages, and many other 
computer systems. The hand controller will 
therefore not have to be a PC. Instead, it can be 
any platform that has enough computational power 
and is compatible with the user's existing systems. 


7.0 SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION 

The software is written in 'C'. The standard 
package consists of two modules. The first 
module initializes the counter board. The second 
module controls the width of the generated pulses 
by writing the appropriate register on the counter 
board. Optional modules interface the Anthrobot 
with the Nintendo Power Glove and the Exos 
Dexterous Hand Master. These modules allow the 
user to operate the hand in a master/slave mode. 
Each optional module consists of three routines: an 
initialization routine, the routine to read the input 
data from the master, and the routine to map the 
input commands to the outputs for the Anthrobot. 
Sections 7.1 and 7.2 describe the operation of the 
master/slave mapping routines for the Nintendo 
and the Exos masters, respectively. See the 
Appendices for descriptions of the Nintendo and 
Exos products. 

7.1 Controlling the Anthrobot with the 
Nintendo Power Glove 

Without the ability to resolve individual finger joint 
motions, and only three detectable positions per 
finger, the Power Glove can only provide coarse 
control of the hand. In effect, four inputs have to 
control sixteen joints. The input from the master 
ring finger controls both the slave's ring and pinky 
fingers. The remaining inputs are assumed to be 
commands to curl or uncurl the appropriate finger 
and/or thumb. The flex data therefore provides 
motion commands for the last three joints on each 
finger (remember that the middle joint on each 
finger is mechanically connected to the distal joint). 
The glove-mounted keyboard controls the 
remaining side-to-side motion of the fingers. The 
keyboard can also control the wrist motors. 

7.2 Controlling the Anthrobot with the 
Exos Dexterous Hand Master 

The key to controlling the hand using the Exos 
master is to map the readings from the Hand 
Master into the appropriate joint commands for the 
hand. Since the Anthrobot- 2 is essentially a scaled 
replica of a human hand, the map is linear: 

y=mx+b 

where: 

y is the slave joint position, 


6 



x is the glove reading, 
m is the scale factor, and 
b is a constant offset. 

The calibration procedure consists of putting the 
master and slave in a variety of matching poses, 
finding the x's and y's, and solving for m and b 
using standard least-squares methods. 

8.0 CONCLUSION 

The Anthrobot-2 is a five-fingered, fully functional 
robot hand. The Anthrobot-2 is the first robot 
hand to follow human anatomical construction. 
This includes the link proportions, the thumb 
motion, and the the shape of the palm. By 
following the human model, the Anthrobot will 
exhibit the same dexterous manipulation 
capabilities as the human hand. In addition, 
teleoperated control of the Anthrobot is 
straightforward and intuitive, since the user utilizes 
the knowledge gained from controlling his or her 
own hands. 

The Anthrobot-2 attaches to a variety of industrial 
manipulators. One of the first experiments will be 
to run the hand in master/slave mode to learn what 
advantages and disadvantages this design has over 
other end effector designs. In the future, the 
Anthrobot will have tactile sensing capability added 
to increase its utility.

APPENDICES 


A. The Nintendo Power Glove 


B. The Exos Dexterous Hand Master 


The Nintendo Power Glove (PG) is a device used 
to measure hand and finger motion for games using 
the Nintendo system. VPL Research in Redwood, 
California (see List of Contacts), provides the 
glove with a serial adapter, called the Power Glove 
Serial Adapter (PGSA), for research use. Using 
the PGSA, any computer with a serial port can read 
the information from the glove. The glove 
information consists of flex data from the thumb 
and three fingers (the pinky finger does not have a 
sensor). The flex data is digitized into two-bit 
values for a total of three positions per finger 
(0,1,2). The glove also provides its 3-D position 
relative to a base unit (usually mounted to a TV 
set). Lastly, the glove information lists which of 
the several keys on the glove-mounted keyboard 
have been hit. 

The PGSA will upload a new data packet 
approximately 30 times per second. This is the 
maximum rate at which the PG can calculate and 
assemble a new data packet. The PGSA sends a 
data packet consisting of HTbytes preceded by 2 
header bytes (used for data synchronization). The 
remaining bytes contain sonar data, finger flex 
data, and keyboard button selection data. 

A.G.E. [1990] provides more information on the 
Power Glove and the serial adapter. This 
document is now available from VPL Research. 



The Dexterous Hand Master (DHM), available 
from Exos Corporation, is intended to attach to a 
person’s hand and perform direct readings of any 
joint of that hand. Exos also provides an optional 
attachment to measure wrist motion. The sensors 
are hall effect devices mounted on the structure 
near each joint. The hall effect sensors provide a 
sinusoidal voltage output proportional to the joint 
rotation. The sensor is positioned such that the 
range of motion is roughly within the most linear 
portion of the sine curve. An electronics board 
made by Exos provides the power and sensing for 
the DHM. The board is made for IBM PCs and 
compatibles. Exos provides 'C' and Assembler 
routines for activating and reading from the 
electronics board. Using the Exos software and 
hardware, the maximum sample rate is 100 Hz. 
For more information, see Exos [1990a], Exos 
[1990b], and Marcus and Churchill [1988].

16. Abstract 

The Anthrobot-2 is an anatomically correct, fully functioning robot hand. 

The number of fingers, the proportions of the links, the placement and 
motion of the thumb, and the shape of the palm follow those of the human 
hand. Each of the finger and thumb joints are servo controlled. The Anthro- 
bot-2 also includes a two-degree-of-freedom wrist. The entire package, 
including wrist, hand and actuators, will mount on the ends of a variety of 
industrial manipulators. A patent has been applied for on the design. The 
Anthrobot-2 will be useful in tasks where dexterous manipulation or tele- 
manipulation are required.
