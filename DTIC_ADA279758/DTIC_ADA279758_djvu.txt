3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 
1.3) was taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The 
contents of the magnetic tape were loaded directly onto the host 
computer. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host computer, the full 
set of tests was processed by the Ada implementation. The DDC-I 
Ada downloader runs on the Sun SPARCclassic and is used for 
downloading the executable images to the target Intel iSBC 186/100 
(Bare Machine). The DDC-I Debug Monitor runs on the target Intel 
iSBC 186/100 (Bare Machine) and provides communication interface 
between the host downloader and the executing target Intel iSBC 
186/100 (Bare Machine). The two processes communicate via 
ethernet. 

The tests were compiled and linked on the host computer system, as 
appropriate. The executable images were transferred to the target 
computer system by the communications link described above, and 
run. The results were captured on the host computer system. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the 
customer and reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for 
a complete listing of the processing options for this 
implementation. It also indicates the default options. The 
options invoked explicitly for validation testing during this test 
were: 

-list 

Test output, compiler and linker listings, and job logs were 
captured on magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings 
examined on-site by the validation team were also archived.

1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. 
The ACVC contains a collection of test programs structured into six 
test classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test 
name identifies the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and 
E tests are executable. Class B and class L tests are expected to 
produce errors at compile time and link time, respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and 
produce a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result when they are executed. Three Ada library units, the 
packages REPORT and SPPRT13, and the procedure CHECK_FILE are used 
for this purpose. The package REPORT also provides a set of 
identity functions used to defeat some compiler optimizations 
allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test objective. 
The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the Ada 
Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents 
of text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 
of the Ada Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. If these units are not 
operating correctly, validation testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. 
Class B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is 
compiled and the resulting compilation listing is examined to 
verify that all violations of the Ada Standard are detected. Some 
of the class B tests contain legal Ada code which must not be 
flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects 
violation of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately 
compiled units. Errors are expected at link time, and execution is 
attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be 
replaced by implementation-specific values—for example, the 


1-2 









/ 


largest integer. A list of the values used for this implementation 
is provided in Appendix A. In addition to these anticipated test 
modifications, additional changes may be required to remove 
unforeseen conflicts between the tests and implementation-dependent 
characteristics. The modifications required for this 
implementation are described in section 2.3. 

For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by 
the AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications 
described in the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see 
section 2.1) and, possibly some inapplicable tests (see Section 3.2 
and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each 
test of the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.1 WITHDRAWN TESTS 

Some tests are withdrawn by the AVO from the ACVC because they do 
not conform to the Ada Standard. The following 104 tests had been 
withdrawn by the Ada Validation Organization (AVO) at the time of 
validation testing. The rationale for withdrawing each test is 
available from either the AVO or the AVF. The publication date for

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are 
irrelevant for a given Ada implementation. The inapplicability 
criteria for some tests are explained in documents issued by ISO 
and the AJPO known as Ada Commentaries and commonly referenced in 
the format Al-ddddd. For this implementation, the following tests 
were determined to be inapplicable for the reasons indicated; 
references to Ada Commentaries are included as appropriate. 

The following 201 tests have floating-point type declarations 
requiring more digits than SYSTEM.MAX_DIGITS: 

C24113L..Y (14 tests) C35705L..Y (14 tests) 

C35706L..Y (14 tests) C35707L..Y (14 tests)

C35708L..Y (14 tests) C35802L..Z (15 tests) 

C45241L..Y (14 tests) C45321L..Y (14 tests) 

C45421L..Y (14 tests) C45521L..Z (15 tests) 

C45524L..Z (15 tests) C45621L..Z (15 tests) 

C45641L..Y (14 tests) C46012L..Z (15 tests) 

C24113I..K (3 tests) use a line length in the input file which 
exceeds 126 chai'acters. 

C35404D, C45231D, B86001X, C86006E, and CD7101G check for a 

predefined integer type with a name other than INTEGER, 
LONG_INTEGER, or SHORT_INTEGER; for this implementation, there is 
no such type. 

C35713B, C45423B, B86001T, and C86006H check for the predefined 
type SHORT_FLOAT; for this implementation, there is no such type. 

C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with 
a name other than FLOAT, LONG_FLOAT, or SHORT_FLOAT,* for this 
implementation, there is no such type. 

C45531M..P and C45532M..P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations 
for types that require a SYSTEM.MAX MANTISSA of 47 or greater; for 
this implementation, MAX_MANTISSA is less than 47. 

C45624A..B (2 tests) check that the proper exception is raised if 
MACHINE_OVERFIOWS is FALSE for floating point types and the results 
of various floating-point operations lie outside the range of the 
base type; for this implementation, MACHINE_OVERFLOWS is TRUE. 

C4A013B contains a static universal real expression that exceeds 
the range of this implementation's largest floating-point type; 
this expression is rejected by the compiler. 

D56001B uses 65 levels of block nesting; this level of block 
nesting exceeds the capacity of the compiler. 

B86001Y uses the name of a predefined fixed-point type other than 
type DURATION; for this implementation, there is no such type. 

C96005B uses values of type DURATION'S base type that are outside 
the range of type DURATION; for this implementation, the ranges are 
the same. 

CA2009C and CA2009F check whether a generic unit can be 
instantiated before its body (and any of its subunits) is compiled; 
this implementation creates a dependence on generic units as 
allowed by AI-00408 and AI-00506 such that the compilation of tie 
generic unit bodies makes the instantiating units obsolete. (See 
section 2.3.) 


2-2 








CD1009C checks whether a length clause can specify a non-default 
size for a floating-point type; this implementation does not 
support such sizes. 

CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use length 
clauses to specify non-default sizes for access types; this 
implementation does not support such sizes. 

The following 264 tests check operations on sequential, text, and 
direct access files; this implementation does not support external 
files:

CE2103A, CE2103B, and CE3107A use an illegal file name in an 

attempt to create a file and expect NAME_ERROR to be raised; this 
implementation does not support external files and so raises 
USE_ERROR. (See section 2.3.) 

2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 71 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
implementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in 


2-3 











the way expected by the original tests.

C83030C and C86007A were graded passed by Test Modification as 
directed by the AVO. These tests were modified by inserting 
"PRAGMA ELABORATE (REPORT);" before the package declarations at 
lines 13 and 11, respectively. Without the pragma, the packages 
may be elaborated prior to package Report's body, and thus the 
packages' calls to function REPORT.IDENT_INT at lines 14 and 13, 
respectively, will raise PROGRAM_ERROR. 

CA2009C and CA2009F were graded inapplicable by Evaluation 
Modification as directed by the AVO. These tests contain 
instantiations of a generic unit prior to the compilation of that 
unit's body; as allowed by AI-00408 and AI-00506, the compilation 
of the generic unit bodies makes the compilation unit that contains 
the instantiations obsolete. 

BC3204C and BC3205D were graded passed by Processing Modification 
as directed by the AVO. These tests check that instantiations of 
generic units with unconstrained types as generic actual parameters 
are illegal if the generic bodies contain uses of the types that 
require a constraint. However, the generic bodies are compiled 
after the units that contain the instantiations, and this 
implementation creates a dependence of the instantiating units on 
the generic units as allowed by AI-00408 and AI-00506 such that the 
compilation of the generic bodies makes the instantiating units 
obsolete—no errors are detected. The processing of these tests 
was modified by re-compiling the obsolete units; all intended 
errors were then detected by the compiler. 

CE2103A, CE2103B, and CE3107A were graded inapplicable by 
Evaluation Modification as directed by the AVO. The tests abort 
with an unhandled exception when USE_ERROR is raised on the attempt 
to create an external file. This is acceptable behavior because 
this implementation does not support external files (cf. AI-00332).

Testing of this Ada implementation was conducted at the customer's 
site by a validation team from the AVF. 

3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes 
each test of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada 
Programming Language Standard, whether the test is applicable or 
inapplicable; otherwise, the Ada Implementation fails the ACVC 
[Pro92]. 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard. 

The list of items below gives the number of ACVC tests in various 
categories. All tests were processed, except those that were 
withdrawn because of test errors (item b; see section 2.1), those 
that require a floating-point precision that exceeds the 
implementation's maximum precision (item e; see section 2.2), and 
those that depend on the support of a file system—if none is 
supported (item d). All tests passed, except those that are listed 
in sections 2.1 and 2.2 (counted in items b and f, below).

APPENDIX B 


COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


The compiler options of this Ada implementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to compiler documentation and 
not to this report. 










5 THE ADA COMPILER 


The Ada Compiler compiles all program units within the specified source file and inserts the 
generated objects into the current program library. Compiler options are provided to allow the 
user control of optimization, run-time checks, and compiler input and output options such as list 
flies, configuration flies, the program library used. etc. 

The input to the compiler consists of the source file, the configuration file (which controls the 
format of the list file), and the compiler options. Section S.l provides a list of all compiler 
options, and Section 5.2 describes the source and configuration files. 

If any diagnostic messages are produced during the compilation, they are output on the diagnostic 
file and on the current output file. The diagnostic file and the diagnostic messages are described 
in Section 5.3.2. 

Output consists of an object placed in the program library, diagnostic messages, and optional 
listings. The configuration file and the compiler options specify the format and contents of the 
list information. Output is described in Section 5.3. 

The compiler uses a program library during the compilation. The compilation unit may refer to 
units from the program library, and an internal representation of the compilation unit will be 
included in the p rog ra m library as a result of a successful compilation. The program library is 
described in Chapter 3. Section 5.4 briefly describes how the Ada compiler uses the library. 


5.1 Invoking the Ada Compiler 

Invoke the Ada compiler with the following command to the SunOS shell: 

$ ada (<option>) <source-file-name> 
where the options and parameters are:

36 




DACS-°Ox86 User's Guide 
Ada Compiler 


<source-file-name> 

The Ada compiler has one mandatory parameter that should specify the Ada source file. 

This parameter specifies the text file containing the source text to be compiled. If the file type 
is omitted in the source file specification, the file type ".ada" is assumed by default. 

The allowed format of the source text is described in Section 52 . 1 . 


Below follows a description of each of the available options to the invocation of the Ada 
compiler. 


5.1.1 •[nolautojnline 

•auto Jniine local | global 
•noautoinline (default) 

This option specifies whether subprograms should be inline expanded. The inline expansion only 
occurs if the subprogram has less than 4 object declarations and less than 6 statements, and if the 
subprogram fulfills the requirements defined for pragma INLINE (see Section C.2.3). LOCAL 
specifies that only inline expansion of locally defined subprograms should be done, while 
GLOBAL will cause inline expansion of all subprograms, including subprograms from other units. 


5.1.2 -check 


•check [ <keyword> a ON | OFT { ,<keyvrord> a ON I OFT } ] 

•check ALLaON (default) 

•check specifies which run-time checks should be performed. Setting a run-time check to ON 
enables the check, while setting it to OFT disables the check. All run-time checks are enabled by 
default. The following explicit checks will be disabled/enabled by using the name as <keywond>: 


ACCESS 

ALL 

DISCRIMINANT 

ELABORATION 

INDEX 

LENGTH 

OVERFLOW 

RANGE 

STORAGE 


Check for access values being non NULL. 
All checks. 

Checks for discriminated fields. 

Checks for subprograms being elaborated. 
Index check. 

Array length check. 

Explicit overflow checks. 

Checks for values being in range. 

Checks for sufficient storage available. 


37 



DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
Ada Compiler 


5.1 J -configurationfiie 


-configuration-file <fUe-speo 
•configuration-file config (default) 

This option specifies the configuration file to be used by the compiler in the current compilation. 
The configuration file allows the user to fotmat compiler listings, set error limits, etc. If the 
option is omitted the configuration file config located in the same directory as the Ada compiler 
is used by default. Section 52.2 contains a description of the configuration file. 


5.1.4 -[no]debug 
•debug 

•nodebug (default) 

Generate debug information for the compilation and store the information in the program library. 
This is necessary if the unit is to be debugged with the DDC-I Ada Symbolic Cross Debugger. 
Note that the program must also be linked with the -debug option, if the program is to be 
debugged with the DDC-I Ada Symbolic Cross Debugger. See Section 6.5.11. 


5.1 J -[no]fixpoint_rounding 

-fixpointrounding (default) 

-nofixpointrounding 

Normally all inline generated code for fixed point MULTIPLY and DIVIDE is rounded, but this 
may be avoided with -nofixpoint rounding. Inline code is generated for all 16 bit fixed point 
types and for 32 bit fixed point types, when the target is 80386PM or 80486PM. 


5.1.6 •[nolfloatjdlowed 

-fioatal lowed (default) 

-nofloatallowed 

Float instruction generation may be flagged as errors, if • nofloat is selected. This is for use in 
systems, where no floating point processor (nor emulator) is available. Notice that TEXT JO uses 
floats in connection with FLOAT JO and FIXED JO. 


38 











DACS-80x86 User's Guide 
Ada Compiler 


5.1.7 -library 

-library <flle-speo 

•library $ada_iibrary (default) 

This option specifies the current sublibrary that will be used in the compilation and will receive 
the object when the compilation is complete. By specifying a current sublibrary, the current 
program library (current sublibrary and ancestors up to root) is also implicitly specified. 

If this option is omitted, the sublibrary designated by the environmental variable a da-library is 
used as the current sublibrary. Section 3.4 describes how the Ada compiler uses the library. 


5.1.8 -(no)list 
•list 

•nolist (default) 

-list-specifics that a source listing will be produced. The source listing is written to the list file, 
which has the name of the source file with the extension Jis. Section 3.3.1.1 contains a description 
of the source listing. 

If -nolist is active, no source listing is produced, regardless of LIST pragmas in the program or 
diagnostic messages produced. 


5.1.9 -optimize 

•optimize [ <keyword> = on | off { ,<keyword> = on | off} ] 

•optimize all=off 

This option specifies which optimizations will be performed during code generation. The possible 
keywords are: (casing is irrelevant) 


all 

All possible optimizations are invoked. 

check 

Eliminates superfluous checks. 

cse 

Performs common subexpression elimination including common 
address expressions. 

fct2proc 

Change function calls returning objects of constrained array types 
or objects of record types to procedure calls. 

reordering 

Transforms named aggregates to positional aggregates and named 
parameter associations to positional associations. 

stack-height 

Performs stack height reductions (also called Aho Ullman 
reordering). 

block 

Optimize block and can frames. 


Setting an optimization to on enables the optimization, while setting an optimization to off disables 
the optimization. All optimizations are disabled by default. In addition to the optional 
optimizations, the compiler always performs the following optimizations: constant folding, dead 
code elimination, and selection of optimal jumps. 


39 




DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
Ada Compiler 


5.1.10 -(nojprogress 
-progress 

-noprogress (default) 

When this option is given, the compiler will output data about which pass the compiler is 
currently running. 


5.1.11 -{nojxref 
-xref 

•noxref (default) 

A cross-reference listing can be requested by the user by means of the option -xref. If the -xref 
option is given and no severe or fatal errors are found during the compilation, the cross-reference 
listing is written to the list file. The cross-reference listing is described in Section ?. 


5.1.12 -(no]save_source 

-save_source (default) 

•nosave_source 

When -save-source is specified, a copy of the compiled source code is placed in the program 
library. If -nosave_source is used, source code will not be retained in the program library. 

Using -nosave_source. while helping to keep library sizes smaller, does affect the operation of 
the recompiler, see Chapter 7 for more details. Also, it will not be possible to do symbolic 
debugging a the Ada source code level wit a the DACS-80x86 Symbolic Ada Debugger, if the 
source code is not saved in the library. 


5.1.13 -{no]target_debug 

-targetjlebug 
-notarget_debug (default) 

Specifies whether symbolic debug information on standard OMF is included in the object file. 
Currently the linker does not support the OMF debug information. 

This option may be used when debugging with standard OMF tools (i.e., PICE). 


40 





DACS-80x86 User's Guide 
Ada Compiler 


5.1.14 -unit 

•unit s <unit_number> 

The specified unit number will be assigned to the compilation unit if it is free and it is a legal 
unit number for the library. 


5.1.15 -recompile 
-recompile 

The file name (source) is interpreted as a compilation unit name which has its source saved from 
a previous compilation. If -specification is not specified, it is assumed to be body which must be 
recompiled. 


5.1.16 -specification 
-specification 

Works only together with -recompile see Section 5.1.15. 


5.2 Compiler Input 

Input to the compiler consists of the command line options, a source text file and, optionally, a 
configuration file. 


5.2.1 Source Text 

The user submits one file containing a source text in each compilation. The source text may 
consist of one or more compilation units (see ARM Section 10.1). 

The format of the source text must be in ISO-FORMAT ASCII. This format requires that the 
source text is a sequence of ISO characters (ISO standard 646), where each line is terminated by 
either one of the following termination sequences (CR means carriage return, VT means vertical 
tabulation, LF means line feed, and FF means form feed): 

• A sequence of one or more CRs, where the sequence is neither immediately preceded nor 
immediately followed by any of the characters VT, LF, or FF. 

• Any of the characters VT, LF, or FF, immediately preceded and followed by a sequence of zero 
or more CRs. 

In general, ISO control characters are not permitted in the source text with the following 
exceptions: 





DACS-80x86 User's Guide 
Ada Compiler 


« The horizontal tabulation (HT) character may be used as a separator between lexical units. 

• LF, VT, FF, and CR may be used to terminate lines, as described above. 

The maximum number of characters in an input line is determined by the contents of the 
configuration file (see section 5.1.3). The control characters CR, VT, LF, and FF are not 
considered a part of the line. Lines containing more than the maximum number of characters are 
truncated and an error message is issued. 


5^2 Configuration File 

Certain processing characteristics of the compiler, such as format of input and output, and error 
limit, may be modified by the user. These characteristics are passed to the compiler by means 
of a configuration file, which is a standard SPAR C/SunOS text file. The contents of the 
configuration file must be an Ada positional aggregate, written on one line, of the type 
CONFIGURATION.RECORD, which is described below. 

The configuration file (config) is not accepted by the compiler in the following cases: 

• The syntax does not conform with the syntax for positional Ada aggregates. 

• A value is outside the ranges specified. 

• A value is not specified as a literal. 

• UNES_PER_PAGE is not greater than TOP.MARGIN + BOTTOM.MARGIN. 

• The aggregate occupies more than one line. 

If the compiler is unable to accept the configuration file, an error message is written on the 
current output file and the compilation is terminated. 

This is the record whose values must appear in aggregate form within the configuration file. The 
record declaration makes use of some other types (given below) for the sake of clarity.

heading and blank lines. The heading is placed in the middle lines of the top margin. 

3) BOTTOM.MARGIN: specifies the minimum number of lines left blank in the bottom of 
the page. The number of lines available for the listing of the program is LINES 
PER.PAGE - TOP-MARGIN - BOTTOM-MARGIN. 

4) OUT-UNELENGTH: specifies the maximum number of characters written on each line. 
Lines longer than OUT-UNELENGTH are separated into two lines. 

5) SUPPRESS-ERRORNO: specifies the format of error messages (see Section 5.3.5.1). 

The name of a user-supplied configuration file can be passed to the compiler through the 
configuration-file option. DDC-I supplies a default configuration file (config) with the following 
content: 


INTEGER range 30..100 
INTEGER range 4.. 90 
INTEGER range 0.. 90 
INTEGER range 80..132 
BOOLEAN;

5-3 Compiler Output 

The compiler may produce output in the list file, the diagnostic file, and the cunent output file. 
It also updates the program library if the compilation is successful. The present section describes 
the text output in the three files mentioned above. The updating of the program library is 
described in Section S.4. 

The compiler may produce the following text output: 


1) A listing of the source text with embedded diagnostic messages is written on the list Hie, 
if the option -list is active. 

2) A compilation summary is written on the list file, if -list is active. 

3) A cross-reference listing is written on the list file, if -xref is active and no severe or fatal 
errors have been detected during the compilation. 

4) If there are any diagnostic messages, a diagnostic file containing the diagnostic messages 
is written. 

5) Diagnostic messages other than warnings are written on the cunent output file. 


44 












DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
Ada Compiler 


5J.1 The List File 

The name of the list file is identical to the name of the source file except that it has the file type 
Mis". The file is located in the current (default) directory. If any such file exists prior to the 
compilation, the newest version of the file is deleted. If the user requests any listings by 
specifying the options -list or -xref, a new list file is created. 

The list file may include one or more of the following parts: a source listing, a cross-reference 
listing, and a compilation summary. 

The pans of the list file are separated by page ejects. The contents of each pan are described in 
the following sections. 

The format of the output on the list file is controlled by the configuration file (see Section 52.2) 
and may therefore be controlled by the user. 


5J.1.1 Source Listing 

A source listing is an unmodified copy of the source text. The listing is divided into pages and 
each line is supplied with a line number. 

The number of lines output in the source listing is governed by the occurrence of LIST pragmas 
and the number of objectionable lines. 

• Pans of the listing can be suppressed by the use of the LIST pragma. 

• A line containing a construct that caused a diagnostic message to be produced is printed even 
if it occurs at a point where listing has been suppressed by a LIST pragma. 

5.3.12 Compilation Summary 

At the end of a compilation, the compiler produces a summary that is output on the list file if the 
option -list is active. 

The summary contains information about: 

1) The type and name of the compilation unit, and whether it has been compiled successfully 
or not. 

2) The number of diagnostic messages produced for each class of severity (see Section 
5.32.1). 

3) Which options were active. 

4) The full name of the source file. 

5) The full name of the current sublibrary. 

6) The number of source text lines. 







DACS-80x86 User's Guide 
Ada Compiler 


7) The size of the code produced (specified in bytes). 

8) Elapsed real time and elapsed CPU time. 

9) A "Compilation terminated" message if the compilation unit was the last in the compilation 
or "Compilation of next unit initiated" otherwise. 


5.3.1.3 Cross-Reference Listing 

A cross-reference listing is an alphabetically sorted list of the identifiers, operators, and character 
literals of a compilation unit The list has an entry for each entity declared and/or used in the 
unit, with a few exceptions stated below. Overloading is evidenced by the occurrence of multiple 
entries for the same identifier. 

For instantiations of generic units, the visible declarations of the generic unit are included in the 
cross-reference listing as declared immediately after the instantiation. The visible declarations are 
the subprogram parameters for a generic subprogram and the declarations of the visible pan of the 
package declaration for a generic package. 

For type declarations, all implicitly declared operations are included in the cross-reference listing. 

Cross-reference information will be produced for every constituent character literal for string 
literals. 

The following are not included in the cross reference listing: 

• Pragma identifiers and pragma argument identifiers. 

• Numeric literals. 

• Record component identifiers and discriminant identifiers. For a selected name whose selector 
denotes a record component or a discriminant, only the prefix generates cross-reference 
information. 

• A parent unit name (following the keyword SEPARATE). 


Each entry in the cross-reference listing contains: 

• The identifier with, at most. 13 characters. If the identifier exceeds 13 characters, a bar ("I") 
is written in the 16th position and the rest of the characters are not printed. 

• The place of the definition, i.e., a line number if the entity is declared in the current 
compilation unit, otherwise the name of the compilation unit in which the entity is declared 
and the line number of the declaration. 

• The numbers of the lines in which the entity is used. An asterisk ("*") after a line number 
indicates an assignment to a variable, initialization of a constant, assignments to functions, or 
user-defined operators by means of RETURN statements. Please refer to Appendix B.3 for 
examples.

DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
Ada Compiler 


5S2 The Diagnostic File 

The name of the diagnostic file is identical to the name of the source file except that it has the 
file type ■’.err’*. It is located in the current (default) directory. If any such file exists prior to the 
compilation, the newest version of the file is deleted. If any diagnostic messages are produced 
during the compilation a new diagnostic file is created. 

The diagnostic file is a text file containing a list of diagnostic messages, each followed by a line 
showing the number of the line in the source text causing the message, and a blank line. There 
is no separation into pages and no headings. The file may be used by an interactive editor to 
show the diagnostic messages together with the erroneous source text 


5.3X1 Diagnostic Messages 

The Ada compiler issues diagnostic messages on the diagnostic file. Diagnostics other than 
warnings also appear on the current output file. If a source text listing is required, the diagnostics 
are also found embedded in the list file (see Section 5.3.1). 

In a source listing, a diagnostic message is placed immediately after the source line causing the 
message. Messages not related to any particular line are placed at the top of the listing. Every 
diagnostic message in the diagnostic file is followed by a line stating the line number of the 
objecdonal line. The lines are ordered by increasing source line numbers. Line number 0 is 
assigned to messages not related to any particular line. On the current output file the messages 
appear in the order in which they are generated by the compiler. 

The diagnostic messages are classified according to their severity and the compiler action taken: 


Warning: Reports a questionable construct or an error that does not influence the meaning of the 
program. Warnings do not hinder the generation of object code. 

Example: A warning will be issued for constructs for which the compiler detects will 
raise CONSTRAINT.ERROR at run time. 


Error. Reports an illegal construct in the source program. Compilation continues, but no object 
code will be generated. 

Examples: most syntax errors; most static semantic errors. 


Severe Reports an error which causes the compilation to be terminated immediately, 
error No object code is generated. 

Example: A severe error message will be issued if a library unit mentioned by a 
WITH clause is not present in the current program library. 


47 



DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
Ada Compiler 


Fatal Repons an error in the compiler system itself. Compilation is terminated immediately 

error and no object code is produced. The user may be able to circumvent a fatal error by 

correcting the program or by replacing program constructs with alternatives. Please 
inform DDC-I about the occurrence of fatal errors. 


The detection of more errors than allowed by the number specified by the ERRORJJMTT 
parameter of the configuration file (see section 5 22) is considered a severe error. 


SJ-2.2 Format and Content of Diagnostic Messages 

For certain syntactically incorrect constructs, the diagnostic message consists of a pointer line and 
a text line. In other cases a diagnostic message consists of a text line only. 

The pointer line contains a pointer (a carat symbol A ) to the offending symbol or to an illegal 
character. 

The text line contains the following information; 

• the diagnostic message identification "• * ***" 

• the message code XY-Z where 

X is the message number 

Y is the severity code, a letter showing the severity of the error 

W: warning 
E: error 
S: severe error 
F: fatal error 

Z is an integer which, together with the message number X. uniquely identifies the compiler 
location that generated the diagnostic message; Z is of importance mainly to the compiler 
maintenance team - it does not contain information of interest to the compiler user. 

The message code (with the exception of the severity code) will be suppressed if the 
parameter SUPPRESS_ERROR.NO in the configuration file has the value TRUE (see 
section 52. 2). 

• the message text; the text may include one context dependent field that contains the name of 
the offending symbol; if the name of the offending symbol is longer than 16 characters only 
the first 16 characters are shown. 

Examples of diagnostic messages: 

*** 18W-3: Warning: Excaption CONSTRAINT_ERROR will ba raisad hara 

*** 320E-2: Nana OBJ doas not danota a typa 

*** 535E-0: Expression in return statement missing

5.4 The Program Library 

This section briefly describes how the Ada compiler changes the program library. For a more 
general description of the program library, the user is referred to Chapter 3. 

The compiler is allowed to read from all sublibraries constituting the current program library, but 
only the current sublibrary may be changed. 


5.4.1 Correct Compilations 

In the following examples it is assumed that the compilation units are correctly compiled, i.e.. that 
no errors are detected by the compiler. 


Compilation of a library unit which is a declaration 

If a declaration unit of the same name exists in the current sublibrary, it is deleted together with 
its body unit and possible subunits. A new declaration unit is inserted in the subiibrary. together 
with an empty body unit 

Compilation of a library unit which is a subprogram body 

A subprogram body in a compilation unit is treated as a secondary unit if the current subiibrary 
contains a subprogram declaration or a generic subprogram declaration of the same name and this 
declaration unit is not invalid. In all other cases it will be treated as a library unit, i.e.: 

• when there is no library unit of that name 

• when there is an invalid declaration unit of that name 

• when there is a package declaration, generic package declaration, an instantiated package, cr 
subprogram of that name 


Compilation of a library unit which is an instantiation 

A possible existing declaration unit of that name in the current sublibrary is deleted together with 
its body unit and possible subunits. A new declaration unit is inserted. 


Compilation of a secondary unit which is a library unit body 

The existing body is deleted from the sublibrary together with its possible subunits. A new body 
unit is inserted. 


49 






i 


DACS-80x86 User's Guide 
Ada Compiler 


Compilation of a secondary unit which is a subunit 

If the subunit exists in the sublibrary it is deleted together with its possible subunits. A new 
subunit is insetted. 


S.4J Incorrect Compilations 

If the compiler detects an error in a compilation unit, the program library will remain unchanged. 

Note that if a file consists of several compilation units and an error is detected in any of these 
compilation units, the program library will not be updated for any of the compilation units. 


SJ Instantiation of Generic Units 

This section describes the rules after which generic instantiation is performed. 


5 J.l Order of Compilation 

When instantiating a generic unit, it is required that the entire unit, including body and possible 
subunits, be compiled before the first instantiation. This is in accordance with the ARM Chapter 
10.3 (1). 


5J5 2 Generic Formal Private Types 

The present section describes the treatment of a generic unit with a generic formal private type, 
where there is some construct in the generic unit that requires that the corresponding actual type 
must be constrained if it is an array type or a type with discriminants, and there exists 
instantiations with such an unconstrained type (see ARM. Section 12.3.2(4)). This is considered 
an illegal combination. In some cases the error is detected when he instantiation is compiled, in 
other cases when a constraint-requiring construct of the generic unit is compiled: 

1) If the instantiation appears in a later compilation unit than the first constraint-requiring 
construct of the generic un ; t, the error is associated with the instantiation which is rejected 
by the compiler. 

2) If the instantiation appears in the same compilation unit as the first constraint-requiring 
construction of the generic unit, there are two possibilities: 

a) If there is a constraint-requiring construction of the generic unit after the instantiation, 
an error message appears with the instantiation. 

b) If the instantiation appears after all constraint requiring constructs of the generic unit 
in that compilation unit, an error message appears with the constraint-requiring 
construct, but will refer to the illegal instantiation. 


50 







DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
Ada Compiler 


3) The instantiation appears in an earlier compilation unit than the first constraint-requiring 
construction of the generic unit, which in that case will appear in the generic body or a 
subunit If the instantiation has been accepted, the instantiation will correspond to the 
generic declaration only, and not include the body. Nevertheless, if the generic unit and 
the instantiation are located in the same sublibrary, then the compiler will consider it an 
error. An error message will be issued with the constraint-requiring construct and will refer 
to the illegal instantiation. The unit containing the instantiation is not changed, however, 
and will not be merited as invalid. 


5.6 Uninitialized Variables 

Use of uninitialized variables is not flagged by the compiler. The effect of a program that refers 
to the value of an uninitialized variable is undefined. A cross-reference listing may help to find 
uninitialized variables. 


5.7 Program Structure and Compilation Issues 

The following limitations apply to the OACS-80x86 Ada Compiler Systems for the Real Address 

Mode and 286 protected mode only: 

• The Ada compiler supports a "modified la-ge" memory model for data references. The 
"modified large” memory model associates one data segment for each hierarchical sublibrary in 
the Ada program library. All package data declared within a sublibrary is efficiently referenced 
from Ada code compiled into the same sublibrary. A slight increase in code size results from 
referencing package data compiled into a different hierarchical level. Intel’s medium memory 
model can thus be obtained by utilizing only one level of Ada program library, the root 
sublibrary. 

• The Ada compiler supports a large memory model for executable code. Although the size of 
a single compilation unit is restricted to 32K words, the total size of the code portion of a 
program is not restricted. 

• The space available for the static data of a compilation unit is 64K - 20 bytes. 

• The space available for the code generated for a compilation unit is limited to 32K words. 

• Any single object cannot exceed 64K • 20 bytes. 

The following limitations apply to all DACS-80x86 products: 

• Each source file can contain, at most, 32,767 lines of code. 

• The name of compilation units and identifiers may not exceed the number of characters given 
in the INPUT.LINELENGTH parameter of the configuration file. 

• An integer literal may not exceed the range of LONG_INTEGER, a real literal may not exceed 
the range of LONG_FLOAT. 


51 





DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
Ada Compiler 


• The number of formal parameters permitted in a procedure is limited to 127 per parameter 
specification. There is no limit on the number of procedure specifications. For example, the 
declaration: 

procedure OVER LIMIT (INTEGER01, 

INTEGER02, 

• * * • I 

INTEGER!66: in INTEGER); 

exceeds the limit, but the procedure can be accomplished with the following: 

procedure UNDER LIMIT (INTEGER01 : in INTEGER; 

INTEGER02 : in INTEGER; 

INTEGER166 : in INTEGER); 

The above limitations are diagnosed by the compiler. In practice these limitations are seldom 
restrictive and may easily be circumvented by using subunits, separate compilation, or creating new 
sublibraries. 


5.8 Compiler Code Optimizations 

DDC-I's Ada compiler for the iAPX 80x86 microprocessor family generates compact efficient 
code. This efficiency is achieved, in pan. by the compiler's global optimizer. Optimizations 
performed include: 

• Common sub-expression elimination 

• Elimination of redundant constraint checks 

• Elimination of redundant elaboration checks 

• Constant folding 

• Dead code elimination 

• Optimal register allocation 

• Selection of optimal jumps 

• Optional run-time check suppression

LINKER OPTIONS 


The linker options of this Ada implementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to linker documentation and 
not to this report. 


B-2 








6 THE ADA LINKER 


The DACS linker must be executed to create an executable program in the target environment 
Linking is a two stage process that includes an Ada link using the compilation units in the Ada 
program library, and a target link to integrate the application code, run-time code, and any 
additional configuration code developed by the user. The linker performs these two stages with a 
single command, providing options for controlling both the Ada and target link processes. 

This chapter describes the link process, except for those options that configure the Run-Time 
System, which is described in detail in Chapter 7. 


6.1 Invoking the Linker

6.1.1 Diagnostic Messages 

Diagnostic messages from the Ada Linker are output on the current output file and on the optional 
log file. The messages are output in the order they are generated by the linker. 

The linker may issue two kinds of diagnostic messages: warnings and severe errors. 

A warning reports something which does not prevent a successful linking, but which might be an 
error. A warning is issued if there is something wrong with the body unit of a program unit 
which formally does not need a body unit, e.g. if the body unit is invalid or if there is no object 
code container for the body unit. Warnings are only output on the log file, not on the current 
output file. The linking summary on the log file will contain the total number of warnings issued, 
even if the issued warnings have not been output. 

A severe error message reports an error which prevents a successful linking. Any inconsistency 
detected by the linker will, for instance, cause a severe error message. e.g. if some required unit 
does not exist in the library or if some time stamps do not agree. If the linker is used for 
consequence examination, all inconsistencies introduced by the hypothetical recompilations are 
reported as errors. 

A unit not marked as invalid in the program library may be reported as being invalid by the 
linker if there is something wrong with the unit itself or with some of the vmits it depends on. 


6 2 The Linking Process 

The linking process can be viewed as two consecutive processes. Both are automatically carried 
out when issuing the link command ada_link. 


54 



DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
The Ada Linker 


The first process constitutes the Ada link process and the second constitutes the target link 
process. 

The Ada link process 

• retrieves the required Ada object modules from the program library, 

• determines an elaboration order for all Ada units, 

• creates a module containing the User Configurable Data (UCD) from the specified configuration 
options to the linker and 

• creates a shell script that carries out the target link process (i.e., dlnkbldx86). The locate/build 
phase is an integral pan of the target link. 


If the option -stop Jrefore Jink is NOT specified (default), the above script is executed 
automatically. Otherwise the linking process is halted at this point. 

When -stop.beforeJink is specified, all temporary files are retrieved for inspection or 
modification. The target linker is invoked by executing the shell script. 


6.2.1 Temporary Files 

The following temporary files are in use during the link phase: 

<main_program>_link.cora The shell script which invokes the target linker. 

<main_program>_elabcode.o The object code for the calling sequence of the elaboration 

code. 


<main_program>_ucd.o The object code generated from the RTS configuration 

options (see Section 12). 

<main_program>_uxxxxx.o The Ada object modules which have been extracted from the 

program library, xxxxx is the unit number of the Ada unit- 


55 



DACS-80x86 User's Guide 
The Ada Linker 



The following components make up the run-time system: 

1) User configurable portion of the RTS 

a) User configurable data (UCD) and 

b) User configurable code (UCQ 

2) Permanent part of the RTS 

a) Non-tasking RTS (rl 1 Jib) or 

b) Tasking RTS (rl2Jib) 

c) RMS Tasking RTS (rl3.1ib) 

The User Configurable Code defined by the environmental variable adajiccjib is included in the 
link. If no tasking has been specified, then the RTS non-tasking library (rll.lib) will be included. 
If tasking has been specified, then support for tasking will be included (rl2Jib or, when -rms, 
rl3.1ib). 


56 









DACS-80x86 User's Guide 
The Ada Linker 


The output of the linker step is an absolute executable object file with the extension "dat" and 
a map file with the extension ".mp5". 


6.U. Environmental Variables 

When a link is executed, a number of files are referred to and most are accessed through 
environmental variables. The locate/build phase uses the control file Sada.ucc.dir/config.bld.ddci, 
the remaining variables are: 


VARIABLE 

PURPOSE 

ada.systemjibrary 

Identifies the root library where the system compilation units reside. 

adajibrary 

Identifies the default library used by all DACS-80x86 tools. It is the 
lowest level sublibrary in the program library hierarchy. 

ada.rootjib 

Identifies the OMF library where the system library units have been 
extracted from the system library. By having a separate Library for the 
root compilation units, the link process is much faster than otherwise 
having to extract each unit from the system library for each link. 

ada_rl 1 Jib 

Identifies the OMF library for the Permanent Part of the non-tasking 
version of the Run-Time System. 

ada_rl2Jib 

Identifies the OMF library for the Permanent Part of the tasking version 
of the Run-Tune System. 

ada_rl3Jib 

Identifies the OMF library for the Permanent Pan of the optional Rate 
Monotonic scheduling Run-Tune System. 

ada_uccjib 

Identifies the OMF library for the User Configurable Code portion of 
the Run-Time System. 

ada-iemplate 

Identifies the template file for the Linker. 

ada_ucc_dir 

Identifies the directory of the current UCC. 


With each of these environmental variables, the name will differ depending on how the system 
was installed (ada86, adal86 etc). Throughout this document ada is assumed. For example, the 
environmental variables for the root library for the 80186 version of the compiler would be 
adal86_root_lib, and the RTS UCC library environmental variables for the 8086 version would 
be ada86_ucc_lib.

6J Run-Time System Overview 

The Run-Time System for DACS-80x86 is defined as all code and data, other than the code and 
data produced by the code generator, required to make an embedded system application operate 
properly on a specific hardware system. 

In general, there are two major components that make up the Run-Tune System. 

1) Code and data assumed to exist by the code generator. This is hardware independent and 
known as the RTS Permanent Part. 

2) Code and data tailoring the application with respect to the characteristics of the hardware 
and other requirements of the embedded systems developer. This code is called the RTS 
User Configurable Part. 

Both of the above components consist of modular OMF libraries. The modules are only included 
in the user program if they are needed, i.e., if a call or reference is made to the module. This 
ensures a compact RTS (typical applications are 4 KB to 10 KB). 

The RTS Permanent Pan does not make any assumptions about the hardware other than an 80x86 
and some amount of memory available. 

There are several versions of the RTS User Configurable Pan available for different development 
targets. Also, the source code is provided to allow the modification of the User Configurable 
Code (UCQ to operate on other targets. Refer to the RTS Configuration Guide for complete 
information on modifying the UCC. 

DDC-I has carefully analyzed and selected the pans of the Run-Time System that must be 
configurable for hardware independence, freeing the user from major rewrites whenever the 
Run-Time System is retargeted while, soil allowing for almost unlimited adaptability. 

Four important features of the run-time system are: 

• It is small 

• It is completely ROMable 

• It is configurable 

• It is efficient 


Conceptually, an Ada run-time system can be viewed as consisting of the following components: 

• Executive. i.e., the stan-up mechanism 

• Storage Management 

• Tasking Management 

• Input/Output 

• Exception Handling 

58 






DACS-80x86 User's Guide 
The Ada Linker 


• Run-Time Library Routines 

• Package CALENDAR support routines 


The run-time system (RTS) can be configured by the user through Ada Linker command options. 
The Ada Linker will generate appropriate data structures to represent the configured characteristics 
(UCD). 

Two versions of the RTS are supplied, one including tasking and one excluding tasking. The 
linker selects the RTS version including tasking only if the option -tasks is present or -tasks n 
is present and n > 0. Otherwise, the linker selects the RTS version excluding tasking. 


6.4 Linker Elaboration Order 

The elaboration order is primarily given by the unit dependencies, but this leaves some freedom 
here and there to arbitrarily choose between two or more alternatives. This arbitrary is in the 
DACS-80x86 linker controlled by the spelling of the involved library units, in order for "free" 
units to become alphabetically sorted. 

Recompiling from scratch, an entire system may thus affect the allocation of unit numbers, but the 
elaboration order remains the same. 

It is also attempted to elaborate "body after body", so that a body having a with to a specification, 
will be attempted elaborated after the body of this specification. 

Also elaboration of units from different library levels is attempted to complete elaboration of a 
father-level prior to the son-level. 

This strategy should in many cases reduce the need for resetting pragma ELABORATE. 


6-5 Ada Linker Options 

This section describes in detail the Ada linker option and parameters. 


6J.1 The Parameter <unit-name> 

<unit-name> 

The <unit_name> must be a library unit in the current program library, but not necessarily of the 
current sublibrary. 

Note that a main program must be a procedure without parameters, and that <unit-name> is the 
identifier of the procedure, not a file specification. The main procedure is not checked for 
parameters, but the execution of a program with a main procedure with parameters is undefined. 


59 






DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
The Ada Linker 


6JL2 The Parameter <recompilation-$peo 
The syntax of crecompilation-speo is: 

<unit_speo[-body|-spedfication][_] 

This parameter tells the linker to perform a consistency check of the entire program using the 
hypothetical recompilation of all units designated in the crecompi lauon- spec*. The link process 
in this instance is not actually performed. 

The <unit_speo is a list of unit-names (wildcards are allowed), separated by comma (,) or plus 
(+). Each unit-name should include an option to indicate if the body or specification is to be 
hypothetically compiled (-spec is the default). 


6JJ Required Recompilations 

If the consistency check found that recompilations are required, a list of required recompilations 
is written to the current output file or to a text file if the -log option is specified (the name of 
the text file is indicated in the log file, line 8). The list will include any inconsistencies detected 
in the library and recompilations required by the hypothetical recompilations specified with the 
options -declaration and -body. 

The entries in the list contain: 

1) The unit name. 

2) Indication of what type of unit (declaration unit, body unit, or subunit). 

3) If the unit is specified as recompiled with the -declaration or -body option, it is marked 
with "-R-". 

4) The environmental variable of the sublibrary containing the unit 

In the recompilation list the units are listed in a recommended recompilation order, consistent with 
the dependencies among the units. 


6J5.4 -seardtiib 

•searchlib <fUe_name> {,<file_name>} 

The -searchlib option directs the Ada Linker to search the specified 80x86 target libraries for 
object modules in order to resolve symbol references. The 80x86 target libraries for object files 
will be searched before the DACS Run-Time System (RTS) library normally searches for run-time 
routines: in this way one can replace the standard DACS RTS routines with custom routines. 

The -sear chlib option is also intended to specify libraries of modules referenced from Ada via 
pragma INTERFACE. 


60 















DACS*80x86 User’s Guide 
The Ada Linker 


Examples: 

$ ada_iink -search lib interface_lib p 

Links the subprogram p. resolving referenced symbols first with the target library iruerface.lib 
and then with the standard RTS target library. 


6ii -stop-before-link 


•stopJieforeJink 


The >stopJ>eforeJink option allows the user to introduce assemblers and linkers from third 
parties or~to otherwise configure the link to suit the application. The link is halted with the 
following conditions: 

• ser configurable data file, <main>.ucd.o, is produced with the default or user specified 
i. option values included. 

• The elaboration code is contained in the <main>_elabcode.o file. 

• The shell script file that contains the link command is present and has not been executed. The 
file's name is <main>-link.com. 

• The temporary Ada object file(s) used by the target linker are produced. These objects are 
linked and deleted when <main>_link.com is executed. 

• With -selectiveJink the object files comprise all Ada units including those from the root 
library. At this point it is possible to disassemble the "cut* object files using -object with the 
disassembler. 

To complete the link, the <miin>_link.com script must be executed. To use third party tools, this 
file may have to be modified. 


iii -options 

-options <parametcr> 

•options allow the user to pass options onto the target linker. 


61 






DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
Run-Time System 


6J.7 •library 

-library <fUe-tume> 

-library $ada-library (default) 

The -library option specifies the current sublibrary, from which the linking of the main unit will 
take place. If this option is not specified, the sublibrary specified by the environmental variable 
ada-library is used. 


6Ji -selectiveJink 


•selective-link 

This extracts ail required object modules from the Ada library (including the root library) and cuts 
out exactly those parts that are actually called, in order to make the resulting target program 
considerably smaller. If a program uses e.g. PUTJJNE as the only routine from TEXT JO. the 
contribution from the TEXT JO object module will only contain PUTJJNE (and whatever that 
needs). Note that disassemblies of units used in a selective link normally will not match what is 
linked, because of the cutting. Such disassemblies may though be obtained by disassembling 
directly those units that matte up the selective link, by stopping the linking before the target link 
phase (-stopJieforeJink), making disassemblies using -object and then resuming the link. 

Note also that unused constants and permanent variables are not removed. 

Only "level 1" subprograms may be removed. Nested subprograms (that are not called) are to be 
removed during compilation using the -optimize option. Nested subprograms are only removed, 
if the routine in which the nesting occurs is removed. 


6JJ >[no]log 

•log [<fiie-spec>] 

-nolog (default) 

The option specifies if a log file will be produced from the front end linker. As default, no log 
file is produced. If <file-speo is not entered with -log the default file name for the log file will 
be linkJog in the current directory. 

The log file contains extensive information on the results of the link. The file includes: 

• An elaboration order list with an entry for each unit included, showing the order in which the 
units will be elaborated. For each unit, the unit type, the time stamp, and the dependencies are 
shown. Furthermore, any elaboration inconsistencies will be repotted. 

• A linking summary with the following information: 

• Parameters and active options. 

• The full name of the program library (the current sublibrary and its ancestor sublibraries). 


62 





DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
The Ada Linker 


• The number of each type of diagnostic message. 

• A termination message, stating if the linking was terminated successfully or unsuccessfully or 
if a consequence examination was terminated. 

• Diagnostic messages and warnings are written on the log file. 


If recompilations are required (as a result of the consistency check) a text file is produced 
containing excerpts of the log file. The name of this text file is written in the log file, line 8. 


The log file consists of: 

• Header consisting of the linker name, the linker version number, and the link time. 

• The elaboration order of the compilation units. The units are displayed in the order elaborated 
with the unit number, compilation time, unit type, dependencies, and any linking errors. 

• If recompilations are required, the units that must be recompiled are listed along with its unit 
type and sublibrary level. 

• The linking summary that includes the main unit name, the program library, any recompilations 
that are required, and if any errors or warnings occurred. 


6.5.10 -(no]root_ex tract 


•root-extract 

-norootextract (default) 

The units contained in the Ada system library supplied by DDC-1 have been extracted and inserted 
into the Sada_root_lib OMF Library, thus eliminating extractions from the system library at link 
time and improving link performance. 

The user should normally not modify or compile into the Ada system library supplied by DDC-I. 
If however, a unit is compiled into the Ada system library, the Sada_root_lib will no longer 
match the Ada system library and -root_extract must be specified in order to link from the Ada 
system library. 


6J.11 -[nojdebug 
•debug 

•nodebug (default) 

The -debug option specifies that debug information is generated. The debug information 
required to enable symbolic debugging. If -nodebug is specified, the Ada linker will skip 
generation of debug information, thus saving link time, and will not insert the debug informat 


63 


tig 






DACS-80x86 User's Guide 
The Ada Linker 


into the chosen sublibrary, thus saving disk space. Note that any unit which should be 
symbolically debugged with the DDC-1 Ada Symbolic Cross Debugger must also be compiled with 
the -debug option. 


6J.12 -(no)rts 

-rts (default) 

•norts 

The -rts option directs the Ada Linker to include the appropriate Run-Time System (RTS) in the 
link, -norts directs the Ada Linker to exclude the RTS in the link. 

The ability to exclude the Run-Time System from the link allows the user to do an additional link 
with a private copy of a custom RTS. The Ada Linker may report unresolved references to RTS 
routines, but will still produce a relocatable object file. 


6.5.13 -rms 


•rms 

This option selects the Rate Monotonic Scheduling Tasking Kernel (if tasking is selected). The 
default is to use the Standard Tasking Kernel. This feature is supplied as an opdon. 


6.5.14 -[nolextract 

-extract (default) 

-noextract 

This option to the linker allows the user to specify that program unit objects should not be 
extracted from the Ada program library. This option would be used if the user knows that many 
objects have not changed since the last link and does not want the linker to waste time extracting 
them. 

To use this feature, the user should modify the template to not delete unit object files after a 
target link is performed. This way the object files remain in the current directory (or whenever 
the user decides to put them). On subsequent links the user can extract object modules of 
modified units from the Ada library using the standalone DACS extract tool. A new target link 
can then be performed using a combination of newly extracted objects and the object files from 
previous links that have gone unchanged. This could significantly improve linker speed when 
linking programs that share common and rarely modified libraries and when relinking programs 
that have had only a few units modified. 


64 







DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
Tile Ada Linker 


65.15 -template 

•template <flle-nime> 

•template Sada.template (default) 

The template file is known to the linker via the environmental variable adajemplate. DDC-I 
supplies a default template file as part of the standard release system. Please refer to appendix H 
for detailed information. 


65.16 -npx 


•npx (default) 

•nonpx 

The -npx option specifies that the 80x87 (8087, 80287, or 80387) numeric coprocessor is used 
by the Ada program. When -npx is specified, the 80x87 is initialized by the task initialization 
routine, the floating point stack is reset during exception conditions, and the 80x87 context is 
saved during a task switch. 


Configurable Data 

A 16 bit boolean constant is generated by the Ada Linker.

65.17 -tasks 
•tasks [n] 

(default is no tasking) 

This option specifies the maximum number of tasks allowed by the RTS. If specified, n must be 
greater than zero. If -tasks is specified without a value for n, n defaults to 10. If -tasks is not 
specified, the RTS used will not include support for tasking. If -tasks is specified, the RTS used 
will include support for tasking. 

Ada Interrupt tasks identified with pragma DMTERRUPT.HANDLER need not be included in the 
count of maximum number of tasks. The main program must be counted in the maximum number 
of tasks. Note that the main program, which may implicitly be considered a task, will not run 
under control of the tasking kernel when -notasks is specified. See also *nn option. 


Configurable Data 

For -tasks, the linker generates the following configurable data:

6.5.18 -priority 
•priority n 

•priority 15 (default) 

The -priority option specifies the default priority for task execution. The main program will run 
at this priority, as well as tasks which have had no priority level defined via pragma PRIORITY. 
The range of priorities is from 0 to 31. 

Priorities can be set on a per task basis dynamically at run time. See section El (Package 
RTS_EmryPoints) for more details.

45.19 -time-tike 

-dme_jlice (r] (default no time slicing is active) 

The -time_siice options specifies whether or not time slicing will be used for tasks. If specified. 
R is a decimal number of seconds representing the default time slice to be used. If R is not 
specified, the default time slice will be 1/32 of a second. R must be in the range Duration'Small 
£ R S 2.0 and must be greater than or equal to the -timer linker option value. Time slicing only 
applies to tasks running at equal priority. Because the RTS is a preemptive priority scheduler, the 
highest priority task will always run before any lower priority task, Only when two or more tasks 
are running at the same priority is time slicing applied to each task. 

Tune slicing can be specified on a per task basis dynamically at run-time. See Section E.1 
(Package RTS_EntryPoints) for more details. 

Time slicing is not applicable unless tasking is being used. This means that the -tasks option 
must be used for -timejslke to be effective.

The -timer option specifies the resolution of calls to the Run-Time System routine TIMER (see 
the Run-Time System Configuration Guide for DACS-80x86 for more information). The number. 
R, specifies a decimal number of seconds which have elapsed for every call to TIMER. The 
default TIMER resolution is one millisecond. R must be in the range DURATION’SMALL< R

6-5.21 -reserve-stack 
•reserve stack [n] 


The -reservestack option designates how many words are reserved on each task stack. This 
space is reserved for use by the RTS, which does no checking for stack overflow. This reserved 
space also allows the RTS to function in situations such as handling a storage error exception 
arising from stack overflow. 

The -reserve stack option also reserves pan of the main program suck size, specified by the 
linker option -mp stack size. 


Configurable Data 


The Ada Linker generates the following integer constant:

• Reserve 200 words from each suck for use by the RTS. 


6J5-22 -It-Stack-size 

-It stack size n 
-ItZstackZsize 500<default) 

The -lt_stack_size option designates the library task default size in words. A library task is 
formed 'when ~a task object is declared at the outermost level of a package. Library tasks are 
created and activated during the initial main program elaboration. (See the Ada Reference Manual 
for more details). 


68 







DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
The Ada Linker 


For each library task, the representation spec: 

FOR Task_object'STORAGE_SIZE USE N; 

can be used to specify the library task stack size. However, if the representation spec is not used, 
the default library task size specified by -lt_stack_size will be used. 

For efficiency reasons, all tasks created within library tasks will have stacks allocated within the 
same segment as the library task stack. Normally, the segment which contains the library task 
stack is allocated just large enough to hold the default library task stack. Therefore, one must use 
the option -It_s tack .option or the pragma LT_SEGMENT_SIZE to reserve more space within the 
segment that may be used for nested tasks’ stacks. (See the implementation dependent pragma 
LT.SEGMENT.SIZE in Section F.l for more information). 


The range of this parameter is limited by physical memory size, task stack size allocated during 
the build phase of the link, and the maximum segment size (64K for all except the 386/486 
protected mode, which is 4 GB). 

Configurable Data 


The Ada Linker generates the following integer constant: 


CD IT STACK SIZE 


INTEGER 


Example: 

$ a da-link -Itsttcksize 2048 -tasks p 

• Link the subprogram P using a 2K words default library stack size. 


6J> 23 -lt_stack_size 
-lt_segment_size n 

-lt_segment_size (lt.stack.size + 20 + exception-stack-space) (default) 

This parameter defines in words the size of a library task segment. The library task segment 
contains the task stack and the stacks of all its nested tasks. 

The default value is only large enough to hold one default task stack. If -lt_stack_size is used and 
specifies a value other than the default value, -lt_segment_size should also be specified to be the 
size of <task_stack_size> + 

<total_of_nested_tasks_sizes> + 

<20_words_overhead> + 
exception_stack_space. 

Note that the task stack size specified by the ’STORAGE_size can be representation spec or by 
the option -lt_stack_size. 

Dynamically allocated tasks receive their own segment equal in size to the mp_segment_size.

6JJ4 -mp_stack_size 


-mpstacksize n 
-mplstack-size 8000 (default) 

The -mp_stack_size option specifies the main program stack size in words. 

The range of this parameter is limited by physical memory size, task stack size allocated during 
the build phase (in tasking programs only), the maximum segment size (64K for all except the 
386/486 protected mode, which is 4 GB). and the size of mp_segment_size.

For tasking programs, the Ada Linker generates the same structures but limits the size to 1024 
words. This stack is only used for the execution of the system startup code and elaboration. 
At main program activation, a segment for the main program equal to the size specified by - 
-mp segment size will be allocated from the dynamic memory pool and a stack for the main 
program equal to the size specified by *mp_stack_size will be allocated from the memory 
pool.

6.5.2S -mp-segment-size 


-itip_segment_su* n 
•mplsegmentLsize 8100 (Default) 

The *mp_segment_size option specifies the size, in words, of the segment in which the main 
program sack is allocated. The default setting can be calculated from the formula: 

mp_segment_size * mp_stack_size + 

overhead + (tasks - 1) * 

(overhead + task_storage_size) 

Normally, the main program segment size can be set to the size of the main program sta 
However, when the main program contains nested tasks, the stacks for the nested tasks will 
allocated from the data segment which contains the main program stack. Therefore, when 
main program contains nested tasks, the main program stack segment must be extended via 
-mp_segment_size option. 

The range of this parameter is limited by physical memory size, task stack size allocated during 
the build phase (in tasking programs only), and the maximum segment size (64K for all except 
the 386/486 protected mode, which is 4 GB).

6JJO -sign_oo 
-sign_oa [<string>] 

When this option is specified the linker will generate code to output a sign on message, before 
the Ada elaboration is initiated and a sign off message when the target program has terminated 
successfully. If the program terminates with an uncaught exception, the sign off message is not 
printed. 

The sign on message consists of: 

START (<string>] <program name> 
and the sign off message 
STOP [<string>] <program name> 

The <string> may contain spaces, e.g. 

•sign-on Test 3“ (remember the quotes). 

This facility is very useful to separate output from several target programs run after each other, 
and to verify that a program that produces little or no output has actually been loaded and run 
successfully.

This appendix describes the implementation-dependent characteristics of DACS-80X86™ as required 
in Appendix F of the Ada Reference Manual (ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A). 

F.l Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 

This section describes all implementation defined pragmas. 


F.1.1 Pragma INTERFACE-SPELLING 

This pragma allows an Ada program to call a non-Ada program whose name contains characters 
that are invalid in Ada subprogram identifiers. This pragma must be used in conjunction with 
pragma INTERFACE, i.e., pragma INTERFACE must be specified for the Ada subprogram name 
prior to using pragma INTERFACE_SPELLING. 

The pragma has the format: 

pragma INTERFaCE_SPELUNG (subprogram name, string literal); 

where the subprogram name is that of one previously given in pragma INTERFACE and the string 
literal is the exact spelling of the interfaced subprogram in its native language. This pragma is 
only required when the subprogram name contains invalid characters for Ada identifiers. 

Example: 

function RTS_G*tDataSegm*nt raturn Integer; 
pragma INTERFACE (ASM86, RTS_GetDataSegment) ; 

pragma INTERFACE_S?EU.ING <RTS_GetDataSegment, "RlSMGS?GetDataSegment"); 

The string literal may be appended ’NEAR (or ’FAR) to specify a particular method of call. The 
default is 'FAR. This suffix should only be used, when the called routines require a near call 
(writing ’FAR is however harmless). If 'NEAR is added, the routine must be in the same segment 
as the caller. 


F.1J Pragma LT.SEGMENT-SIZE 

This pragma sets the size of a library task stack segment. 

The pragma has the format: 

pragma LT.SEGMENT.SIZE <T. N); 

where T denotes either a task object or task type and N designates the size of the library task

DACS-80x86 User's Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


stack segment in words. 


The library task's stack segment defaults to the size of the library task stack. The size of the 
library task stack is normally specified via the representation clause (note that T must be a task 

typo 


for T'STORAGE.SIZE use N; 

The size of the library task stack segment determines how many can be created which are 
nested within the library task. All tasks created within a library task will have their stacks 
allocated from the same segment as the library task stack. Thus, pragma LT.SEGMENT.SIZE 
must be specified to reserve space within the library task stack segment so that nested tasks' 
stacks may be allocated (see section 7.1). 

The following restrictions are places on the use of LT_SEGMENT_SIZE: 

1) It must be used only for library tasks 

2) It must be placed immediately after the task object or type name declaration. 

3) The library task stack segment size (N) must be greater than or equal to the library task 
stack size. 


F.1J Pragma EXTERNAL-NAME 


F.1J.1 Function 

The pragma EXTERNAL_NAME is designed to make permanent Ada objects and subprograms 
externally available using names supplied by the user. 


F.UJt Format 

The format of the pragma is: 

pragma EXTERNAL_NAME(<ada_entity>,<extemal name>) 
where <ada_entity> should be the name of: 

• a permanent object, i.e. an object placed in the permanent pool of the compilation unit • such 
objects originate from package specifications and bodies only, 

• a constant object, i.e. an object placed in the constant pool of the compilation unit • please 
note that scalar constants are embedded in the code, and composite constants are not always 
placed in the constant pool, because the constant is not considered constant by the compiler. 


194 








DACS*80x86 User’s Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


• a subprogr am name, i.e. a name of a subprogram defined in this compilation unit - please 
notice that separate subprogram specifications cannot be used, the code for the subprogram 
must be present in the compilation unit code, and where the <extemal name> is a string 
specifying the external name associated the <ada_entity>. The <extemal names> should be 
unique. Specifying identical spellings for different <ada_entities> will generate errors at compile 
and/or link time, and the responsibility for this is left to the user. Also the user should avoid 
spellings similar to the spellings generated by the compiler, e.g. E_xxxxx_yyyyy. P.xxxxx, 
C.xxxxx and other internal identifications. The target debug type information associated with 
such external names is the null type. 


F.1JJ Restrictions 

Objects that are local variables to subprograms or blocks cannot have external names associated. 
The entity being made external ("public") must be defined in the compilation unit itself. Attempts 
to name entities from other compilation units will be rejected with a warning. 

When an entity is an object the value associated with the symbol will be the relocatable address 
of the first byte assigned to the object 


F.l J.4 Example 

Consider the following package body fragment: 

package body example is 

subtype stringlO is string<1..10); 

type s is 
record 

len : integer; 
val : stringlO; 
end record; 

global_s ; s; 

const_s : constant stringlO :■ "1234567890"; 

pragma EXTERNALJNAME(global_s, ”GLOBAL_S_OBJ£CT"); 
pragma EXTERNAL_NAME(const_s, *'C0NST_S"); 

procedure handle (...) is 

end handle; 

pragma EXTERNAi_NAM£(handle, "HANDLE_PROC"); 


end example; 

The objects GLOBAL.S and CONST.S will have associated the names "GLOBAL_S_OBJECT" 
and "CONST_S”. The procedure HANDLE is now also known as "HANDLE.PROC". It is 


195 







DACS-80x86 User’s Guide

allowable to assign more than one external name to an Ada entity. 


F.1J.5 Object Layouts 

Scalar objects are laid out as described in Chapter 9. For arrays the object is described by the 
address of the first element; the array constraints) are NOT passed, and therefore it is 
recommended only to use arrays with known constraints. Non- discriminated records take a 
consecutive number of bytes, whereas discriminated records may contain pointers to the heap. Such 
complex objects should be made externally visible, only if the user has thorough knowledge about 
the layout. 


F.lJ.6 Parameter Passing 

The following section describes briefly the fundamentals regarding parameter passing in connection 
with Ada subprograms. For more detail, refer to Chapter 9. 

Scalar objects are always passed by value. For OUT or IN OUT scalars, code is generated to 
move the modified scalar to its destination. In this case the stack space for parameters is not 
removed by the procedure itself, but by the caller. 

Composite objects are passed by reference. Records are passed via the address of the first byte 
of the record. Constrained arrays are passed via the address of tire first byte (plus a bitoffset when 
a packed array). Unconstrained arrays are passed as constrained arrays plus a pointer to the 
constraints for each index in the array. These constraints consist of lower and upper bounds, plus 
the size in words or bits of each element depending if the value is positive or negative 
respectively. The user should study an appropriate disassembler listing to thoroughly understand 
the compiler calling conventions. 

A function (which can only have IN parameters) returns its result in registers). Scalar results are 
registers/float registers only*, composite results leave an address in some registers and the rest, if 
any, are placed on the stack top. The stack still contains the parameters in this case (since the 
function result is likely to be on the stack), so the caller must restore the stack pointer to a 
suitable value, when the function call is dealt with. Again, disassemblies may guide the user to 
see how a particular function call is to be handled. 


F.1.4 Pragma INTERRUPT-HANDLER 

This pragma will cause the compiler to generate fast interrupt handler entries instead of the normal 
task calls for the entries in the task in which it is specified. It has the format: 

pragma INTERRUPT.HANDLER; 

The pragma must appear as the first thing in the specification of the task object The task must 
be specified in a package and not a procedure. See Section F.6.2.3 for more details and restrictions 
on specifying address clauses for task entries.

F.IJ Pragma MONITOR_TASK 


F.1J.1 Function 

The pragma M0N1T0R.TASK is used to specify that a task with a certain structure can be 
handled in a special way by the Run-Time System, enabling a very efficient context switch 
operation. 


F.liJ Format 
The format of the pragma is 
pragma MONITORJTASK; 

The pragma must be given in a task specification before any entry declarations. 


F.liJ Restrictions 

The following restrictions apply on tasks containing a pragma MONTTOR_TASK : 

• Only single anonymous tasks can be "monitor tasks”. 

• Entries in "monitor tasks” must be single entries (i.e. not family entries). 

• The task and entry attributes are not allowed for "monitor tasks" and "monitor task" entries. 

• The declarative paro shou71d only contain declaration of objects; no types or nested sturcnires 
must be used. 

• The structure of the task body must be one of the following; 

i.

In both cases the declarative parts, the statement lists and the parameter lists may be empty. 
The statement list can be arbitrarily complex, but no nested select or accept statements are 
allowed. 

No exception handler in the monitor task body can be given. 

The user must guarantee that no exceptions are propagated out of the accepts.

F.4 Representation Clauses 

The DACS-80x86™ fully supports the ’SIZE representation for derived types. The representation 
clauses that are accepted for non-derived types are described in the following subsections. 


F.4.1 Length Clause 

Some remarks on implementation dependent behavior of length clauses are necessary: 

• When using the SIZE attribute for discrete types, the maximum value that can be specified is 
16 bits. For DACS-80386PM/80486PM the maximum is 32 bits. 

• SIZE is only obeyed for discrete types when the type is a part of a composite object, e.g. 
arrays or records, for example: 

type byte is range 0..255; 
for byte'size use 8; 

sixteen_bits_allocated : byte; — one word allocated 


: Integer; 

: TeekVelue; 

■■ SemaphoreValue; 

— only uaed In BDS. 


201 











DACS-80x86 User's Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


•ight_bit_par_«laffl«nt : array(0..7) of byte; — four words allocated 
type rec is 
record 

cl,c2 ; byte; — eight bits per component 

end record; 


• Using the STORAGE.SIZE attribute for a collection will set an upper limit on the total size 
of objects allocated in this collection. If further allocation is attempted, the exception 
STORAGE.ERROR is raised. 

• When STORAGE.SIZE is specified in a length clause for a task type, the process stack area 
will be of the specified size. The process stack area will be allocated inside the "standard” stack 
segment. Note that STORAGE.SIZE may not be specified for a task object 


F.42 Enumeration Representation Clauses 

Enumeration representation clauses may specify representations in the range of -32767..+32766 (or 
-16#7FFF..16#7FFE). 


F.4J Record Representation Clauses 

When representation clauses are applied to records the following restrictions are imposed: 

• if the component is a record or an unpacked array, it must start on a storage unit boundary 
(16 bits) 

• a record occupies an integral number of storage units (words) (even though a record may have 
fields that only define an odd number of bytes) 

• a record may take up a maximum of 32K bits 

• a component must be specified with its proper size (in bits), regardless of whether the 
component is an array or not (Please note that record and unpacked array components take up 
a number of bits divisible by 16 (sword size)) 

• if a non-array component has a size which equals or exceeds one storage unit (16 bits) the 
component must start on a storage unit boundary, i.e. the component must be specified as: 

component at N range 0..16 • M - 1; 

where N specifies the relative storage unit number (0.1....) from the beginning of the record, and 

M the required number of storage units (12....) 

• the elements in an array component should always be wholly contained in one storage unit 

• if a component has a size which is less than one storage unit, it must be wholly contained 
within a single storage unit: 


202 





DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


component at N range X .. Y; 

where N is as in previous paragraph, and O <* X <= Y <= IS. Note that for this restriction 
a component is not required to start in an integral number of storage units from the beginning 
of the record. 

If the record type contains components which are not covered by a component clause, they are 
allocated consecutively after the component with the value. Allocation of a record component 
without a component clause is always aligned on a storage unit boundary. Holes created because 
of component clauses are not otherwise utilized by the compiler. 

Pragma pack on a record type will attempt to pack the components not already covered by a 
representation clause (perhaps none). This packing will begin with the small scalar components and 
larger components will follow in the order specified in the record. The packing begins at the first 
storage unit after the components with representation clauses. 


F.4J.1 Alignment Clauses 

Alignment clauses for records are implemented with the following characteristics: 

• If the declaration of the record type is done at the outermost level in a library package, any 
alignment is accepted. 

• If the record declaration is done at a given static level higher than the outermost library level, 
i.e., the permanent area), only word alignments are accepted. 

• Any record object declared at the outermost level in a library package will be aligned according 
to the alignment clause specified for the type. Record objects declared elsewhere can only be 
aligned on a word boundary. If the record type is associated with a different alignment, an 
error message will be issued. 

• If a record type with an associated alignment clause is used in a composite type, the alignment 
is required to be one word; an error message is issued if this is not the case. 


F.5 Implementation-Dependent Names for Implementation Dependent Components 
None defined by the compiler. 


F.6 Address Clauses 

This section describes the implementation of address clauses and what types of entities may have 
their address specified by the user. 


203 





DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


F.6.1 Objects 

Address clauses are supported for scalar and composite objects whose size can be determined at 
compile time. The address clause may denote a dynamic value. 


F.<L2 Task Entries 

The implementation supports two methods to equate a task entry to a hardware interrupt through 
an address clause: 

1) Direct transfer of control to a task accept statement when an interrupt occurs. This form 
requires the use of pragma INTERRUPT_HANDLER. 

2) Mapping of an interrupt onto a normal conditional entry call. This form allows the interrupt 
entry to be called from other tasks (without special actions), as well as being called when 
an interrupt occurs. 


F.6.2.1 Fast Interrupt Tasks 

Directly transferring control to an accept statement when an interrupt occurs requires the 
implementation dependent pragma 1NTERRUPT_HANDLER to tell the compiler that the task is 
an interrupt handler. 


¥.622 Features 

Fast interrupt tasks provide the following features: 

• Provide the fastest possible response time to an interrupt. 

• Allow entry calls to other tasks during interrupt servicing. 

• Allow procedure and function calls during interrupt servicing. 

• Does not require its own stack to be allocated. 

• Can be coded in packages with other declarations so that desired visibiity to appropriate parts 
of the program can be achieved. 

• May have multiple accept statements in a single fast interrupt task, each mapped to a different 
interrupt If more than one interrupt is to be serviced by a single fast interrupt task, the accept 
statements should simply be coded consecutively. See example 2 how this is done. Note that 
no code outside the accept statements will ever be executed. 


204 



DACS-80x86 User's Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


F.6JL3 Limitations 

By using the fast interrupt feature, the user is agreeing to place certain restrictions on the task in 

order to speed up the software response to the interrupt. Consequently, use of this method to 

capture interrupts is much faster than the normal method. 

The following limitations are placed on a fast interrupt task: 

• It must be a task object, not a task type. 

• The pragma must appear first in the specification of the task object. 

• All entries of the task object must be single entries (no families) with no parameters. 

• The entries must not be called from any task. 

• The body of the task must not contain any statements outside the accept statemem(s). A loop 
statement may be used to enclose the accepts), but this is meaningless because no code outside 
the accept statements will be executed. 

• The task may make one entry call to another task for every handled interrupt, but the call must 
be single and parameterless and must be made to a normal tasks, not another fast interrupt 
task. 

• The task may only reference global variables; no data local to the task may be defined. 

• The task must be declared in a library package. i.e.. at the outermost level of some package. 

• Explicit saving of NPX state must be performed by the user within the accept statement if such 
state saving is required. 


F.6.2.4 Making Entry Calls to Other Tasks 

Fast interrupt tasks can make entry calls to other normal as long as the entries are single (no 
indexes) and parameterless. 

If such an entry call is made and there is a possibility of the normal task not being ready to 
accept the call the entry call can be queued to the normal task's entry queue. This can be forced 
by using the normal Ada conditional entry call construct shown below: 

accept E do 
select 
T.E; 
else 

null; 

end select; 
end E; 

Normally, this code sequence means make the call and if the task is not waiting to accept it 
immediately, cancel the call and continue. In the context of a fast interrupt task, however, the 
semantics of this construct are modified slightly to force the queuing of the entry call. 


205 




DACS-80x86 User's Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


If an unconditional entry call is made and the called task is not waiting at the corresponding 
accept statement, then the interrupt task will wait at the entry call. Alternatively, if a timed entry 
call is made and the called task does not accept the call before the delay expires, then the call 
will be dropped. The conditional entry call is the preferred method of making task entry calls 
from fast interrupt handlers because it allows the interrupt service routine to complete straight 
through and it guarantees queueing of the entry call if the called task is not waiting. 

When using this method, make sure that the interrupt is included in the *intemipt_entryjabie 
specified at link time. See Section 72.15 for more details. 


F.62J Implementation of Fast Interrupts 

Fast interrupt tasks are not actually implemented as true Ada tasks. Rather, they can be viewed 
as procedures that consist of code simply waiting to be executed when an interrupt occurs. They 
do not have a state, priority, or a task control block associated with them, and are not scheduled 
to "run” by the run-time system. 

Since a fast interrupt handler is not really a task, to code it in a loop of somekind is meaningless 
because the task will never loop; it will simply execute the body of the accept statement whenever 
the interrupt occurs. However, a loop construct could make the source code more easily understood 
and has no side effects except for the generation of the executable code to implement to loop 
construct. 


F.624 Flow of Control 

When an interrupt occurs, control of the CPU is transferred directly to the accept statement of the 
task. This means that the appropriate slot in the interrupt vector table is modified to contain the 
address of the corresponding fast interrupt accept statement. 

Associated with the code for the accept statement is 

at the very beginning: 

code that saves registers and sets (E)BP to look like a frame where the interrupt return 
address works as return address. 

at the very end: 

code that restores registers followed by an IRET instruction. 

Note that if the interrupt handler makes an entry call to another task, the interrupt handler is 
completed through the IRET before the rendezvous is actually completed. After the rendezvous 
completes, normal Ada task priority rales will be obeyed, and a task context switch may occur. 

Normally, the interrupting device must be reenabled by receiving End-Of-Interrapt messages. These 
can be sent from machine code insertion statements as demonstrated in Example 7. 






DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


F.6J.7 Savin- NPX Sute 

If (he interrupt handler will perform floating point calculations and (he state of the NPX must be 
saved because other tasks also use the numeric coprocessor, calls to the appropriate save/restore 
routines must be made in the statement list of the accept statement. These routines are located 
in package RTS_EniryPoints and are called RTS_Store_NPX_State and RTS_Restore_NPX_State. 
See example 6 for more information. 


F.&2J1 Storage Used 

This section details the storage requirements of fast interrupt handlers. 


F.6^9 Stack Space 

A fast interrupt handler executes off the stack of the task executing at the time of the interrupt. 
Since a fast interrupt handler is not a task it does not have its own stack. 

Since no local data or parameters are permitted, use of stack space is limited to procedure and 
function calls from within the interrupt handler. 


F.6JL10 Run-Time System Data 

No task control block (TCB) is created for a fast interrupt handler. 

If the fast interrupt handler makes a task entry call, an entry in the _CDJNTERRUPT_VECTOR 
must be made to allocate storage for the queuing mechanism. This table is a run-time system data 
structure used for queuing interrupts to normal tasks. Each entry is only 10 words for 80386/80486 
protected mode compilers and S words for all other compiler systems. This table is created by 
the linker and is constrained by the user through the linker option -interrupt entry table. For 
more information, see Section F.6.2.1 on linking an application with fast interrupts. 

If the state of the NPX is saved by user code (see Section F.6.2.7). it is done so in the NPX save 
area of the TCB of the task executing at the time of the interrupt This is appropriate because it 
is that task whose NPX state is being saved. 


F.6J Building an Application with Fast Interrupt Tasks 

This section describes certain steps that must be followed to build an application using one or 
more fast interrupt handlers.

DACS-80x86 User's Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


F.6J.1 Source Code 

The pragma INTERRUPT.HANDLER which indicates that the interrupt handler is the fast form 
of interrupt handling and not the normal type, must be placed in the task specification as the first 
statement. 

When specifying an address clause for a fast interrupt handler, the ofTset should be the interrupt 
number, not the offset of the interrupt in the interrupt vector. The segment is not applicable 
(although a zero value must be specified) as it is not used by the compiler for interrupt addresses. 
The compiler will place the interrupt vector into the INTERRUFTVECTORTABLE segment For 
real address mode programs, the interrupt vector must always be in segment 0 at execution time. 
For protected mode programs, the user specifies the interrupt vector location at build time. 

Calls to RTS_Store_NPX_State and RTS_Restore_NPX_State must be included if the state of the 
numeric coprocessor must be saved when the fast interrupt occrus. These routines are located in 
package RTS_EntryPoints in the root library. See example 6 for more information. 


F.6J 2 Compiling the Program 
No special compilation options are requited. 


F.6JJ Linking the Program 

Since fast interrupt tasks are not real tasks, they do not have to be accounted for when using the 
•tasks option at link bme. In fact, if there are no normal tasks in the application, the program 
can be linked without -tasks. 

This also means that the linker options -lt_stack_size, -It segment size, -mpsegmentsize. and 
-taskstoragesize do not apply to fast interrupt tasks, except to note that a fast interrupt* task will 
execute off the stack of the task running at the time of the interrupt. 

If an entry call is made by a fast interrupt handler the interrupt number must be included in the 
-interrupt_entry_table option at link time. This option builds a table in the run-time system data 
segment to" handle entry calls of interrupt handlers. The table is indexed by the interrupt number, 
which is bounded by the low and high interrupt numbers specified at link time. 


F.6-3.4 Locating/Building the Program 

For real-address mode programs, no special actions need be performed at link time; the compiler 
creates the appropriate entry in the INTERRUPTVECTORTABLE segment. This segment must be 
at segment 0 before the first intenupt can occur. 

For protected mode programs no special actions need be performed. The Ada Link automatically 
recognizes Ada interrupt handlers and adds them to the IDT.

Note that the application is linked with *tasks=2, where the are T and the main program. 
Since the fast interrupt handler is making an entry call to T. the techniques used guarantee that 
it will be queued, if necessary. This is accomplished by using the conditional call construct in 
the accept body of the fast interrupt handler and by including the interrupt in the -

F.6.5 Normal Interrupt Tasks 

"Normal" interrupt tasks are the standard method of servicing interrupts. In this case the interrupt 
causes a conditional entry call to be made to a normal task. 


F.6^,',1 Features 

Normal interrupt tasks provide the following features: 

1) Local data may be defined and used by the interrupt task. 


215 



DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


2) May be called by other tasks with no restrictions. 

3) Can call other normal tasks with no restrictions. 

4) May be declared anywhere in the Ada program where a normal task declaration is allowed. 

F.6.5.2 Limitations 

Mapping of an interrupt onto a normal conditional entry call puts the following constraints on the 
involved entries and tasks: 

1) The affected entries must be defined in a task object only, not a task type. 

2) The entries must be single and parameterless. 

F.6JJ Implementation of Normal Interrupt Tasks 

Normal interrupt tasks are standard Ada tasks. The task is given a priority and runs as any other 
task, obeying the normal priority rules and any time-slice as configured by the user. 


F.6J.4 Flow of Control 

When an interrupt occurs, control of the CPU is transferred to an interrupt service routine 
generated by the specification of the interrupt task. This routine preserves the registers and calls 
the run-time system, where the appropriate interrupt task and entry are determined from the 
information in the _CD_INTERRUPT_VECTOR table and a conditional entry call is made. 

If the interrupt task is waiting at the accept statement that corresponds to the interrupt, then the 
interrupt task is scheduled for execution upon return from the interrupt service routine and the call 
to the run-time system is completed. The interrupt service routine will execute an IRET. which 
reenables interrupts, and execution will continue with the interrupt task. 

If the intenupt task is not waiting at the accept statement that corresponds to the interrupt, and 
the interrupt task is not in the body of the accept statement that corresponds to the intenupt. then 
the entry call is automatically queued to the task, and the call to the run-time system is 
completed. 

If the interrupt task is not waiting at the accept statement that corresponds to the interrupt, and 
the interrupt task is executing in the body of the accept statement that corresponds to the intenupt. 
then the interrupt service routine will NOT complete until the intenupt task has exited the body 
of the accept statement. During this period, the intenupt will not be serviced, and execution in 
the accept body will continue with interrupts disabled. Users are cautioned that if horn within 
the body of the accept statement corresponding to an interrupt, an unconditional entry call is made, 
a delay statement is executed, or some other non-de term ini Stic action is invoked, the result will 
be erratic and will cause non-deterministic intenupt response. 

Example 4 shows how End-Of-Intenupt messages may be sent to the interrupting device. 


216 



DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


F.6JJ Saving NPX State 

Because normal interrupt tasks are standard tasks, the state of the NPX numeric coprocessor is 
saved automatically by the run-time system when the task executes. Therefore, no special actions 
are necessary by the user to save the state. 


F.6L5.6 Storage Used 

This section describes the storage requirements of standard interrupt tasks. 


F.6J.7 Stack Space 

A normal interrupt task is allocated its own stack and executes off that stack while servicing an 
interrupt. See the appropriate sections of this User's Guide on how to set task stack sizes. 


F.6.5.8 Run-Time System Data 

A task control block is allocated for each normal interrupt task via the -tasks option at link time. 

During task elaboration, an entry is made in the run-time system _CD_INTERRUPT_VECTOR 
table to "define" the standard interrupt. This mechanism is used by the run-time system to make 
the conditional entry call when the interrupt occurs. This means that the user is responsible to 
include all interrupts serviced by interrupt tasks in the -interrupt entry table option at link time. 


F.6.6 Building an Application with Normal Interrupt Tasks 

This section describes how to build an application that uses standard Ada tasks to service 
interrupts. 


F.6.6.1 Source Code 

No special pragmas or other such directives are required to specify that a task is a normal interrupt 
task. If it contains interrupt entries, then it is a normal interrupt task by default 

When specifying an address clause for a no.Ttal interrupt handler, the offset should be the 
interrupt number, not the offset of the interrupt in the interrupt vector. The segment is not 
applicable (although some value must be specified) because it is not used by the compiler for 
interrupt addresses. The compiler will place the interrupt vector into the 
INTERRUFTVECTORTABLE segment For real address mode programs, the interrupt vector 
must always be in segment 0 at execution time. This placement can be accomplished by specifying 


217 



DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Charaaerisiics 


the address to locate the INTERRUPTVECTORTABLE segment with the loc86 command, or at 
run time, by having the startup code routine of the UCC copy down the 
INTERRUPTVECTORTABLE segment to segment 0 and the compiler will put it there 
automatically. For protected mode programs, the user specifies the interrupt vector location at 
build time. 


F.6.6J Compiling the Program 
No special compilation options are required. 


F.&6J Linking the Program 

The interrupt task must be included in the -tasks option. The link options -Itstacksize, — 
lt_segment_size, -mpsegmentsize. and *task_storage_size apply to normal interrupt tasks and 
must be set to appropriate values for your application. 

Every interrupt task must be accounted for in the -interrupt_entry_table option. This option 
causes a table to be built in the run-time system data segment to handle interrupt entries. In the 
case of standard interrupt tasks, this table is used to map the interrupt onto a normal conditional 
entry call to another task. 


F.6.7 Examples 

These examples illustrate how to write normal interrupt tasks and then how to build the application 
using them.

F.U Interrupt Queuing 

DDC-I provides a useful feature that allows task entry calls made by interrupt handlers (fast and 
normal variant) to be queued if the called task is not waiting to accept the call, enabling the 
interrupt handler to complete to the IRET. What may not be clear is that the same interrupt may 
be queued only once at any given time in DDC-l's implementation. We have made this choice 
for two reasons: 

a) Queuing does not come for free, and queuing an interrupt more than once is considerably 
more expensive than queuing just one. DDC-I feels that most customers prefer their 
interrupt handlers to be as fast as possible and that we have chosen an implementation that 
balances performance with functionality. 

b) In most applications, if the servicing of an interrupt is not performed in a relatively short 
period of time, there is an unacceptable and potentially dangerous situation. Queuing the 
same interrupt more than once represents this situation. 

Note that this note refers to queuing of the same interrupt more than once at the same time. 
Different interrupts may be queued at the same time as well as the same interrupt may be queued 
in a sequential manner as long as there is never a situation where the queuing overlaps in time. 

If it is acceptable for your application to queue the same interrupt more than once, it is a 
relatively simple procedure to implement the mechanism yourself. Simply implement a high 
priority agent task that is called from the interrupt handler. The agent task accepts calls from the 
interrupt task and makes the call on behalf of the interrupt handler to the originally called task. 
By careful design, the agent task can be made to accept all calls from the interrupt task when they 
are made, but at the very least, must guarantee that at most one will be queued at a time. 


F.6.9 Recurrence of Interrupts 

DDC-I recommends the following techniques to ensure that an interrupt is completely handled 
before the same interrupt recurs. There are two cases to consider, i.e. the case of fast intenupt 
handlers and the case of normal interrupt handlers. 


F.6.9.1 Fast Interrupt Handler 

If the fast interrupt handler makes an entry call to a normal task, then place the code that 
reenables the interrupt at the end of the accept body of the called task. When this is done, the 
intenupt will not be reenabled before the rendezvous is actually completed between the fast 
interrupt handler and the called task even if the call was queued. Note that the interrupt task 
executes all the way through the IRET before the rendezvous is completed if the entry call was 
queued. 

Normally, end-of-interrupt code using Low.Level_I0 will be present in the accept body of the fast 
interrupt handler. This implies that the end-of-interrupt code will be executed before the 
rendezvous is completed, possibly allowing the intenupt to come in again before the application 
is ready to handle it 

If the fast intenupt handler does not make an entry call to another task, then placing the 


222 








DACS-80x86 User s Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


end-of-interrupt code in the accept body of the fast interrupt task will guarantee that the interrupt 
is completely serviced before another interrupt happens. 


¥.632 Normal Interrupt Handler 

Place the code that reenables the interrupt at the end of the accept body of the normal interrupt 
task. When this is done, the interrupt will not be reenabled before the rendezvous is actually 
completed between the normal interrupt handler and the called task even if the call was queued. 
Even though the interrupt "completes" in the sense that the IRET is executed, the interrupt is not 
yet reenabled because the rendezvous with the normal task's interrupt entry has not been made. 

If these techniques are used for either variant of interrupt handlers, caution must be taken that 
other tasks do not call the task entry which reenables interrupts if this can cause adverse side 
effects. 


F.-7 Unchecked Conversion 

Unchecked conversion is only allowed between objects of the same "size". However, if scalar type 
has different sizes (packed and unpacked), unchecked conversion between such a type and another 
type is accepted if either the packed or the unpacked size fits the other type. 


F.8 Input/Output Packages 

In many embedded systems, there is no need for a traditional I/O system, but in order to support 
testing and validation, DDC-I has developed a small terminal oriented I/O system. This I/O system 
consists essentially of TEXT_I0 adapted with respect to handling only a terminal and not file I/O 
(file I/O will cause a USE error to be raised) and a low level package called 
TERMINAL_DRIVER. A BASICJO package has been provided for convenience purposes, 
forming an interface between TEXT JO and TERMINAL JDRIVER as illustrated in the following 
figure. 



The TERMINAL J3RIVER package is the only package that is target dependent, i.e.. it is the only 

223 











DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


package that need be changed when changing communications controllers. The actual body of the 
TERMINAL_DRIVER is written in assembly language and is part of the UCC modules D1IPUT 
and D1IGET The user can also call the terminal driver routines directly, i.e. from an assembly 
language routine. TEXT JO and BASICJO are written completely in Ada and need not be 
changed. 

BASICJO provides a mapping between TEXT JO control characters and ASCI as follows: 
TEXT JO ASCII Character 


LINE TERMINATOR 

ASCII.CR 

PAGE.TERMINATOR 

ASCII.FF 

FILE.TERMINATOR 

ASQI.SUB (CTRL/Z) 

NEWJJNE 

ASCTI.LF 


The services provided by the terminal driver are: 

1) Reading a character from the communications port. Get.Character. 

2) Writing a character to the communications port Put_Character.

F.9 Machine Code Insertions 

The reader should be familiar with the code generation strategy and the 80x86 instruction set to 
fully benefit from this section. 

As described in chapter 13.8 of the ARM [DoD 83] it is possible to write procedures containing 
only code statements using the predefined package MACHINE_CODE. The package 
MACHINE.CODE defines the type MACHINE .INSTRUCTION which, used as a record aggregate, 
defines a machine code insertion. The following sections list the type MACHINE.INSTRUCITON 
and types on which it depends, give the restrictions, and show an example of how to use the 
package MACHINE.CODE. 


233 





DACS-80x86 User's Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


F.9.1 Predefined Types for Machine Code Insertions 

The following types are defined for use when making machine code insertions (their type 
declarations are given on the following pages): 

type opcode.type 
type operand _type 
type register.type 
type segment.register 
type machinejnsuuction 

The type REGISTER.TYPE defines registers. The registers STi describe registers on the floating 
stack. (ST is the top of the floating stack). 

The type MACHINEJNSTRUCTION is a discriminant record type with which every kind of 
instruction can be described. Symbolic names may be used in the form 

name'ADDRESS 

Restrictions as to symbolic names can be found in section F.9.2. 

It should be mentioned that addresses are specified as 80386/80486 addresses. In case of other 
targets, the scale factor should be set to "scale. 1".

F.9 2 Restrictions 


Only procedures, and not functions, may contain machine code insertions. 

Symbolic names in the form x'ADDRESS can only be used in the following cases: 

1) x is an object of scalar type or access type declared as an object, a formal parameter, or 
by static renaming. 

2) x is an array with static constraints declared as an object (not as a formal parameter or by 
renaming). 

3) x is a record declared as an object (not a formal parameter or by renaming). 


The m.CALL can be used with "name" to call (for) a routine. 


Two opcodes to handle labels have been defined: 

m.label: defines a label. The label number must be in the range 1 <= x <= 999 and is put 

in the offset field in the first operand of the MACHINEJNSTRUCTION. 

m_reset: used to enable use of more than 999 labels. The label number after a m_RESET 

must be in the range 1<= x <= 999. To avoid errors you must make sure that ail 
used labels have been defined before a reset, since the reset operation dean all used 
labels. 

All floating instructions have at most one operand which can be any of the following: 

• a memory address 

• a register or an immediate value 

• an entry in the floating stack

F.9J Advanced Topics 

This section describes some of the more intricate details of the workings of the machine 
code insertion facility. Special attention is paid to the way the Ada objects are referenced in 
the machine code body, and various alternatives are shown. 


239 






DACS-80x86 User’s Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


F.9.5.1 Address Specifications 

Package MACHINE_CODE provides two alternative ways of specifying an address for an 
instruction. The first way is referred to as SYSTEM .ADDRESS and the parameter associated 
this one must be specified via OBJECT’ADDRESS in the actual MACHINE.CODE insertion. The 
second way closely relates to the addressing which the 80x86 machines employ: an address has 
the general form 

segment:[base+index*scale+offset] 

The ADDRESS type expects the machine insertion to contain values for ALL these fields. The 
default value NIL for segment, base, and index may be selected (however, if base is NIL, so 
should index be). Scale MUST always be specified as scale. 1. scale_2, scale.4, or scale_8. For 
16 bit targets, scale.l is the only legal scale choice. The offset value must be in the range of 
-32768 .. 32767. 


F.9 Referencing Procedure Parameters 

The parameters of the procedure that consists of machine code insertions may be 
referenced by the machine insertions using the SYSTEM.ADDRESS or ADDRESS formats 
explained above. However, there is a great difference in the way in which they may be specified; 
whether the procedure is specified as INLINE or not. 

INLINE machine insertions can deal with the parameters (and other visible variables) using the 
SYSTEM.ADDRESS form. This will be dealt with correctly even if the actual values are 
constants. Using the ADDRESS form in this context will be the user's responsibility since the 
user obviously attempts to address using register values obtained via other machine insertions. It 
is in general not possible to load the address of a parameter because an ’address’ is a two 
component structure (selector and offset), and the only instruction to load an immediate address 
is the LEA. which will only give the offset. If coding requires access to addresses like this, one 
cannot INLINE expand the machine insertions. Care should be taken with references to objects 
outside the current block since the code generator in order to calculate the proper frame value 
(using the display in each frame) will apply extra registers. The parameter addresses will, 
however, be calculated at the entry to the INLINE expanded routine to minimize this problem. 
INLINE expanded routines should NOT employ any RET instructions. 

Pure procedure machine insertions need to know the layout of the parameters presented to. in this 
case, the called procedure. In particular, careful knowledge about the way parameters are passed 
is required to achieve a succesful machine procedure. When not INLINE a block is created around 
the call which allows addressing of parameters, and code for exiling the procedure jj also 
automatic. 

The user takes over the responsibility for correct parameter addressing. The rules of Ada 
procedure calls must be followed. The calling conventions are summarized below. 







DACS-80x86 User's Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


F.9 J .3 Parameter Transfer 

It may be a problem to figure out the cornet number of words which the parameters take up on 
the stack (the x value). The following is a short description of the transfer method: 

INTEGER types take up at least 1 storage unit 32 bit integer types take up 2 words, and 64 bit 
integer types take up 4 words. In 32 bit targets, 16 bit integer types take up 2 words the low 
word being the value and the high word being an alignment word. TASKs are transferred as 
INTEGER. 

ENUMERATION types take up as 16 bit INTEGER types (see above). 

FLOAT types take up 2 words for 32 bit floats and 4 words for 64 bit floats. 

ACCESS types are considered scalar values and consist of a 16 bit segment value and a 16 or 
32 bit offset value. When 32 bit offset value, the segment value takes up 2 words the high word 
being the aligment word. The offset word(s) are the lowest, and the segment word(s) are the 
highest. 

RECORD types are always transferred by address. A record is never a scalar value (so no 
post-procedure action is carried out when the record parameter is OUT or IN OUT). The 
representation is as for ACCESS types. 

ARRAY values are transferred as one or two ACCESS values. If the array is constrained, only 
the array data address is transferred in the same manner as an ACCESS value. If the array is 
unconstrained below, the data address will be pushed by the address of the constraint. In this 
case, the two ACCESS values will NOT have any alignment words in 32 bit targets. 

Packed ARRAY values (e.g. STRING types) are transferred as ARRAY values with the addition 
of an INTEGER bit offset as the highest wotd(s): 

+H: BIT.OFFSET 
+L: DATA_ADDRESS 

+0: CONSTRAINT_ADDRESS - may be missing 

The values L and H depend on the presence/absence of the constraint address and the sizes of 
constraint and data addresses. 

In the two latter cases, the form parameter’address will always yield the address of the data. If 
access is required to constraint or bit offset, the instructions must use the ADDRESS form. 


F.925.4 Example 

A small example is shown below (16 bit target): 

procedure unsigned.add 

(opl : in integer; 

op2 : in integer, 

res : out integer); 


241 






DACS-80x86 User's Guide

Notice that machine subprograms cannot be functions. 
The parameters take up: 


opl : integer 1 word 

op2 : integer 1 word 

res : integer 1 word

The body of the procedure might then be the following assuming that the procedure is 
defined at outermost package level:

pragma abatract_acoda_lnaartlona(talaa) ; 
and unalgnad^add; ~ 


A routine of this complexity is a candidate for INLINE expansion. In this case, no changes to the 
above 'machine.instruction' statements are required. Please notice that there is a difference between 
addressing record fields when the routine is INLINE and when it is not: 


type rec is 


record 


low 

: integer. 

high 

end record; 

: integer. 

procedure add_32 is 


(opl 

: in integer. 

op2 

: in integer. 

res 

: out rec); 


The parameters take up 1 + 1 + 2 words * 4 words. The RES parameter will be 
addressed directly when INLINE expanded, i.e. it is possible to write: 









DACS-80x86 User's Guide 
Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


machine .instruction ’ (system.address.register, m_MOV, 

res'address, AX); 

This would, in the not 1NL1NEO version, be the same as updating that place on the stack where 
the address of RES is placed. In this case, the insertion must read: 

machine_instruction’(register_system_address. m.LES. 

SI. res'address); 

-- LES SI,(BP+...] 

machine .instruction' (address.register. m.MOV, 

ES. SI. nil. scale. 1. 0, AX); 

- MOV ES:ISI+01,AX 


As may be seen, great care must be taken to ensure correct machine code insertions. A help 
could be to first write the routine in Ada, that disassemble to see the involved addressings, and 
finally write the machine procedure using the collected knowledge. 

Please notice that INLINED machine insertions also generate code for the procedure itself. This 
code will be removed when the -nocheck option is applied to the compilation. Also not 
INLINED procedures using the AA.INSTR insertion, which is explained above, will automatically 
get a storage.check call (as do all Ada subprograms). On top of that, 8 bytes are set aside in the 
created frame, which may freely be used by the routine as temporary space. The 8 bytes are 
located just below the display vector of the frame (from SP and up). The storage.check call will 
not be generated when the compiler is invoked with -nocheck. 

The user also has the option NOT to create any blocks at all. b ut th en he should be certain that 
the return from the routine is made in the proper way (use the RETP instruction (return and pop) 
or the RET). Again it will help first to do an Ada version and see what the compiler expects to 
be done. 

Symbolic fixups are possible in certain instructions. With these you may build 'symbolic* 
instructions byte for byte. The instructions involved all require the operand type NAME (like used 
with CALL), and the interpretation is the following: 

(name, m.DATAD, "MYNAME") a full virtual address (offset and selector) of the 

symbol MYNAME (no additional offset is possible). 

(name, m.DATAW, "MYNAME") the offset part of the symbol MYNAME (no additional 

offset is possible). 

(name, m.DATAB, "MYNAME") the selector value of symbol MYNAME 

In inlined machine instructions it may be a problem to obtain the address of a parameter (rather 
than the value). The LEA instruction may be used to get the offset part, but now the following 
form allows a way to load a selector value as well: 

(system.addtess, LES, param’address) ES is loaded with the selector of PARAM. If this 

selector was e.g. SS, it would be pushed and popped 
into ES. LES may be substituted for LFS and LGS 
for 80386.

F.ll RMS Tasking (OPTIONAL) 

The DACS-80x86 systems may run tasking applications by means of Rate Monotonic Scheduling 
(RMS). RMS capability is purchased optionally, and is thus not included by default. Please contact 
DDC-l for more information regarding RMS and your system. RMS allows the programmer to 
guarantee properties of a tasking system, i.e. that tasks will meet their hard deadlines. The RMS 
tasking is selected by specifying -rats to the Ada link command.
