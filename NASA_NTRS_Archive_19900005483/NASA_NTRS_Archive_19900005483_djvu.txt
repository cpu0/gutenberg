SSFP APPROACH TO SOFTWARE REUSE 


Peg Snyder 

Space Station Freedom Program 


This talk began by presenting the Space Station Freedom Program (SSFP) definitions of 
software commonality and software reuse. Software commonality is the use of identical, inter- 
changeable, functionally compatible, or similar software items to satisfy different sets of func- 
tionally similar requirements. The Software Support Environment (SSE) and the Data Manage- 
ment System (DMS) of onboard computing facilities are examples of SSFP common software. 
Software reuse is the use of identical, compatible, or similar software items in either modified 
or unmodified form to satisfy development activities at any point in the software life cycle; in 
other words, taking an existing item and applying it to another development activity. Software 
commonality has been mandated in several critical areas (such as the SSE and DMS) and a 
policy directive is under review. A software reuse study group was established in May 1988 to 
gather background information (see Level II Software Reuse Study that follows by Scott Her- 
man). The SSFP Program Definition and Requirements Document contains requirements for 
SSE support in the area of software reuse. The SSE is a collection of tools and rules, and pro- 
vides the common environment to be used for the life cycle management of all SSFP opera- 
tional software. Operational software includes ALL flight and ground software that either (1) 
interfaces with on-orbit elements in real time, (2) is critical to the mission, or (3) is SSE 
software. The SSE supports software development in Ada and provides tools for process 
management, software production, integration, test and verification, as well as training and 
library management The SSE will provide the mechanisms required to implement SSFP 
evolving strategies for software reuse.

SSFP APPROACH TO SOFTWARE REUSE 


DEFINITIONS 


Software Commonality: Use of identical, interchangeable, 
functionally compatible, or similar software items to 
satisfy different sets of functionally similar requirements. 

- Common items are from any phase of life cycle 

- Items are used without modifications 

Software Reuse: Use of identical, compatible, or similar 
software items in either modified or unmodified form to 
satisfy development activities at any point in the 
software life cycle. 

- Reusable items already exist 

- Reusability is determined by how well the existing item 

satisfies requirements or derived attributes of 
current development activity

Status 


• Software Commonality 

- Has been mandated in several critical areas such as: 

— Software Development (SSE) 

— Onboard data management (DMS) 

- Level II Policy directive under review 

• Software Reuse Strategy 

- Level II study group was established May 1988 to gather 

background information 

- Level II sponsored "Reusable Software Flight Certification 

Requirements" task 

- Level II Policy directive under review 

- The Software Support Environment (SSE) is mandated to 

support the SSFP reuse strategy 

- Participation in this workshop is part of the process 


SSFP APPROACH TO SOFTWARE REUSE 


The SSFP Level II requirements for SSE support in the area of software reuse 
are baselined in SSP 30000 Sec. 11, Rev. A dated October 15, 1988 as follows: 


5.3.7 REUSABLE SOFTWARE 

The SSE shall provide the capability for identifying and controlling the 
use of software components which may be used in multiple applications 
via a controlled library of reusable components. The SSE shall identify, 
maintain, and support the dissemination of reusability standards and 
reusable software components for SSP operational software.

INTRODUCTION TO THE SOFTWARE 
SUPPORT ENVIRONMENT (SSE) 

• What is the SSE? 

• Why does Space Station need the SSE? 

• SSE Implementation Approach 

• Who are the SSE Users? 

• SSE Functionality 

• Conclusion 


WHAT IS THE SSE? 

• SSE is a collection of: 

Tools (software) 

Rules (procedures, standards, s/w production 
hardware specs, documentation, policy, 
training materials) 

• SSE provides the common environment to be used for the 
life cycle management of all SSP operational software 

• The SSE supports all SSP facilities involved in software 
life cycle management. These facilities include: 

- Work package and KSC Software Production Facilities 

- The Multi-System Integration Facility (MSIF) 

- The SSE Development Facility 

• The SSE supports and provides mechanisms to enforce 
program-wide policies and standards such as: 

- Standard programming language (Ada) 

- Common User Interface standards 

- Software documentation standards 

- Common software verification approach 


92 



DEFINITION OF OPERATIONAL SOFTWARE 


Operational Software is: 

ALL flight and ground software that either 


(1) Interfaces with on-orbit elements in real time 


or 


(2) is critical to the mission, 

such as ah control center, test, and certification software 
including associated models and simulations 


or 


(3) SSE software 


WHY DOES SPACE STATION NEED THE SSE? 

• Software is high risk for the SSP in terms of both safety 

and cost 

- Large amount of software to be developed 

- Integration and testing are major issues - multiple 
developers are organizationally and geographically 
distributed 

- Sustaining engineering is a major cost factor in the SSP 
software life cycle 

• SSE provides the means to control SSP software life cycle 

costs 

- The SSE is a single implementation of tools and rules 
rather than many 

- SSE enables consolidation of contractors and skills for 
sustaining engineering of SSP software 

• SSE provides the means to control SSP software quality 

- Common program-wide standards and tools will be 
utilized for software integration and testing

management of SSP software. They include: 

- Software Project Managers 

- Requirements Analysts 

- Software Designers 

- Software Developers 

- Testers 

- Quality Managers 

■ Software Configuration Managers 

The majority of SSE users will be Work Package

Other SSE users will include: 

- NASA SSP organizations (e.g. MSIF) 

- KSC and non-prime contractors 

- Space Station users 

- International Partners 

The SSE Users Working Group (SSEUWG) provides the 
forum for SSE user information exchange and input to the 
project 



SSE FUNCTIONALITY 


• The SSE supports software development In Ada 

- Ada is baselined as the language of choice for the SSP 

- SSE can be expanded to support additional languages if 
required 

• The SSE Ruleset provides software standards, guidelines 
and procedures to support software acquisition, 
integration, verification and maintenance 

• The SSE Toolset provides all software tools necessary to 
acquire, integrate and deliver SSP operational software 
during all life cycle phases. SSE tools encompass the 
following functional areas: 

- SSE Process Management 

- Software Management Support 

- Software Production 

- Flight Software Integration, Test and Verification 

- Data Reconfiguration 

- Training 

- Library Management 


CONCLUSIONS 

• The SSE provides a single common environment for the 
life-cycle management of all SSP operational software 


• The SSE provides a mechanism for program-wide 

enforcement of approved standards and methodologies 


• SSE support in the critical areas of software integration 
and testing will help to maintain SSP safety requirements 


• Effective use of the SSE will minimize the cost of software 
ownership throughout the entire SSP life cycle
