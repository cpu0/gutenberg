A new frinde detection and measurement system has baan constructad for 
usa with NASA-Goddard's CNRS Fizeau wedde lasar tuner* and consists of 
thraa circuit boards* Tha first board is a standard Raticon RC-100B 
"motherboard* which is usad to provide tha timind* vidao processind* 
and Sanaral housekeerind functions raauirad by tha Raticon RL-512G 

photodiode array usad in tha swstaa* Tha sampled-and-held vidao 
sidnal froa tha "motherboard" is arocassad by a second* custoa-fabricatad 
circuit board which a contains a hidh-sreed frinde dataction and locating 
circuit* This board includes a DC laval discriainator-twae frinse 
detector* a countar circuit to dataraina frinde center r a pulsed lasar 
tridderind circuit* and a control circuit to operate tha shutter 
for tha He-Ne reference lasar baaa* Tha frinde canter inforaation is 
supplied to tha third board* a conaarical s indie-board computer (SYS-1* 
manufactured bw Octadon Systems Corp.) which dovarns tha data-collection 
process and interprets tha results* The computer bedins axacutind a simple 
BASIC-landuade prodram automatically upon powerind up* and this prodram 
may be used to communicate the frinda information to an intellident external 
controllind device (via an RS-232 interface)* or to denerate a correction 
sidnal directly at tha didital output port* Tha prodram is stored in a 
non-volatile on-board EPROM memory which may be erased and reprodrammed 
as desired* 


The following is a suaaarw of ths seauence of svsnts involved in makind 
e laser f rinse position measurement* 

(1) The computer sisnals the f rinse counter board that it is readw to 
accept data on a new laser shot bw drorrins the RD (readw for dita) line 
low* This initializes seauencinS latches A* B* and C <U8 and U20) and 
then sets latch A* 

(2) At the besinnins of the next arrow scan* the scan START pulse fros the 
arraw eotherboard causes latch B to be set* and the swstee is readw to 
acouire frinde data* 

(3) As the arraw readout scan prodressesf the sisnal froa the arraw elements 
is clocked seouentiallw onto the VIDEO input* and at the saae tiae a 9-bit 
binarw eleaent counter <U1» U2» and U24) keeps count of the nuaber of the 
arraw eleaent beinS read* 

• 

(4) As this process continues* a video discriainator circuit consistind of 
: a X2 aaplifier (U11A) and a comparator !U11B) searches for the risind edse 

of a frinde bw coaparind the aaplified video sidnal to a preset voltade 
level • 

! (5) On the first arraw eleaent whose video sidnal exceeds this discriaination 

' level* the coaparator switches on the FR (frinde) Iodic sidnal* settind 
latch D <U7) and transferrind the count in the eleaent counter to a second 
9-bit binarw counter <U3* U4* and U25)* the frinde center counter* The 
frinde center counter is increaented once for everw two arraw elements within thcj 
frinde* with the result that at the end of the frinde it will contain the 
location of the frinde center* j 

(6) As the fallind edae of the frinde is read out* the video sidnal adain 
crosses the preset discriainator level* turnind off the FR Iodic sidnal 
and settind latch E* This turns off the frinde center counter and sidnals 
the coaputer that the frinde center counter now contains a valid frinde center 
location bw turnind on the VD (valid data) line. 

(7) The coaputer reads and stores this number* opens the heliua-neon laser 
shutter bw placina a coaaand on the SH (shutter) line* and bedins an 
analodous process to deteraine the center of the first heliua-neon frinde 
on the arraw* The computer then closes the shutter* takes the difference 
between the test laser and He-Ne reference frinde center locations* prints 
the result* and the process bedins adain* 

(8) In the event that on a particular arraw scan there is no frinde 
detected* either because the laser has not fired or because the video sidnals 
lie below the discriainator level* the swstea siaplw waits for the next 

scan containind frinde information*

Design trade-offs* 


In terms of both hardware and software design* this swstea 
is relatively simple* making it both low in cost and easy to modify* 

However* this simplicity raflacts cartain dasisn tradaoffs which 
should ba kept in mind* 

First* by virtua of tha slow operating speed of tha elect ro- 
aachanical Ha-Na lasar shuttar mechanism* tha aaasuraaant throughput 
rata for this swstea will ba lowar than tha lasar firind rata* 
parhaps onlw 1 Hz* For higher speed operation a liauid-crwstal 
lidht valve or higher-speed alactroaachanical shuttar should be used 
to switch tha Ha-Na line on and off* Even with this liaitation removed* 
due to the slow spaed of tha interpreted BASIC programming language* tha 
system aev still fall short of 10 Hz operation unless tha prosraa is encoded 
in assembly language* It should be noted* however* that unless tha aachanical 
feedback device (i*a* aotorizad aicroaatar or piezoelectric pusher) 
servoing tha tunable lasar can respond with coaparable speed* such 
iaproveaents will have little affect on tha response tiae of the 
wavelength stabilization process* 


A second consideration arises froa tha hardware structuring of tha 
fringe detection process* Since a fringe is detected in real tiae by a DC 
level-crossing discriainator circuit rather than bw storing the scan video 
inforaation and using digital signal processing techniaues* it is 
a rapid* uncoaplicated process* However* since the system considers onlw the 
first fringe which is read out on each array scan* the wavelength 
variation of the laser aust not be greater than about half a free spectral 
range of the wedge in either direction (£0*25 A) before the fringe walks off 
the end of the arrow or another interferometer order emerges at the 
leading edge* Also* since the discriminator responds onlw to DC level 
crossings* the dwnamic range of the swstem is limited bw how low one can set 
the discriainator level before noise is interpreted as fringe date* This 
noise comes from two sources* First there is optical fringe noise 
introduced bw the characteristic rippled wing structure of fringes 
froa a reflectively coated Fizeau wedge* In the presence of such local 
peaks the discriminator level aust be adjusted high enough to 
prevent a premature turn-off of the fringe center counters before 
the actual fringe peak has been crossed* Second* there is electrical 
noise due to the switching transients and nonlinear response between the 
individual arraw elements* There is also a particularly large starting 
transient on the video line at the beginning of a readout 
scan* a characteristic of Reticon arrays# To block this transient 
a video blankina circuit (U27) has been incorporated in the discriainator 
to clamp the fringe logic (FR) output during the readout of 
the first 2 or 3 elements of the array* Even with this feature* however* 
the minimum acceptable fringe signal is twpicallw 25X of the full-scale 
DC signal level with an optimum adjustment of the level threshold triapot.

Docuaentation of Fizeau UedSe Tuner Prosraa 


The prosraa listed below is an exaaple of the use of the SYS-1 
coaputer to aanase the f rinse data collection and readout process* 
The prosrra is written in National Seaiconductor Corp* "Tin* BASIC" 
which uses a subset of the usual Oartaouth BASIC alone with several 
pseudo-asseablv l^nsuase coaaands that allow the contents of the 
I/O registers to be exaained and aanipulated* The prosraa listins 
eliainates all superfluous spaces between coaaands for the sake of 
execution speed* However* a line-bw-line explanation of the prosraa 
appears below the actual proS/ea listinS.
