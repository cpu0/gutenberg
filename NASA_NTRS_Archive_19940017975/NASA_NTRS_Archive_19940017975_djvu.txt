p A Self-Defining Hierarchical Data System

The Self-Defining Data System (SDS) is a system which allows the creation of self-defining 
hierarchical data structures in a form which allows the data to be moved between different 
machine architectures. Because the structures are self-defining they can be used for 
communication between independent modules in a distributed system. 

Unlike disk-based hierarchical data systems such as Starlink's HDS, SDS works entirely in 
memory and is very fast Data structures are created and manipulated as internal dynamic 
structures in memory managed by SDS itself. A structure may then be exported into a caller 
supplied memory buffer in a defined external format This structure can be written as a file or 
sent as a message to another machine. It remains static in structure until it is reimported into 
SDS. 

SDS is written in portable C and has been run on a number of different machine architectures. 
Structures are portable between machines with SDS looking after conversion of byte order, 
floating point format and alignment A Fortran callable version is also available for some 
machines.
