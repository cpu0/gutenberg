13. ABSTRACT 

Weapons Load Crew Management Program, AFLMA Project # LM9611300: The 1994 release of the Weapons Load Crew 
Management Program (WLCMP) was rapidly becoming outdated. The implementation of new computer operating systems 
and increased user demands for program flexibility were rapidly negating WLCMFs advantages. Movement of crew 
members between crews was an awkward process in the Ada programming language version. Widely used throughout the 
Air Force (including Air National Guard and Reserve units), WLCMP is a efficient way of managing load crew training, 
eliminating much of the time and manpower that is required by manual tracking procedures. The MS Access based version 
of WLCMP is intuitive to use and incorporates many new reporting features available to all user levels. These new reporting 
capabilities will allow improved training and trend analysis while reducing the number of man-hours required to collect the 
data. The program provides "real time" load crew status to multiple work centers while protecting the database from 
unauthorized or untrained*personnel. The WLCMP is now "year 2000" compliant.

LETTER REPORT 

WEAPONS LOAD CREW MANAGEMENT 
PROGRAM (WLCMP) UPDATE 


PROJECT MANAGERS: CMSGT ALLAN C. RICHARDSON, JR. 

MSGT STANLEY G. MYNCZYWOR 

SENIOR ANALYST: MS MARY DONALD, GS-12 

AFLMA PROJECT NUMBER: LM9611300 

AUGUST 1997 


BACKGROUND: The Weapons Load Crew Management Program (WLCMP), proficiency 
tracldng software written in ADA programming language, was originally developed in 1994 by 
the Air Force Logistics Management Agency. The software was rapidly becoming outdated with 
the implementation of new computer operating systems and increased user demands for program 
flexibility. Movement of crew members from one crew to another was an awkward process under 
the WLCMP ADA version. Development of an improved method to accomplish this action 
would simplify operations, save additional time, and reduce the potential for error during the 
annual records review/re-accomplishment. Other reported problems with the ADA version 
included: difiBculty in adding additional maintenance forms, lack of real-time load crew status 
reporting, and no multi-user level capability via a local area network (LAN). Widely used 
throughout the Air Force (including Air National Guard and Reserve units), WLCMP is an 
efficient way of managing load crew training, eliminating much of the time and manpower that is 
required by manual tracking procedures. 

OBJECTIVES: Update the current WLCMP using Microsoft Access. 

METHODOLOGY: Major command representatives from PACAF, ACC, and the ANG met 
with the AFLMA in September 1996 to refine the list of suggestions submitted by field users and 
to help develop a requirements list for the new program. Initial programming was finished in 
March 1997, followed by beta testing at Moody AFB and Eielson AFB. Barksdale AFB was 
added to the beta phase in April of the same year at the request of HQ ACC/LGWS. Local Area 
Network (LAN) testing began at Moody AFB in April 1997. 


DRAFT 


CONCLUSION: The MS Access based version of WLCMP is easier to use and incorporates 
many new features that will be useful at all user levels. The new reporting capabilities will allow 
improved training and trend analysis. The program provides near "real time" load crew status to 
multiple work centers while protecting the database from unauthorized or untrained personnel. 
Help files have also been added to assist the operator when needed. The WLCMP is now "year 
2000" compliant. 

RECOMMENDATION: 

1. AFLMA maintain the Weapons Load Crew Management Program until its functionality is 
subsumed by IMDS. 

2. Limit AFLMA involvement to correcting any technical problems in the existing program. 

3 . AFLMA will not support further enhancements or modification to the WLCMP. 

DISTRIBUTION: Refer to attached Standard Form 298.
