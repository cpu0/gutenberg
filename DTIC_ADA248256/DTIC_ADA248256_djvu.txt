1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conpliance of Ada inplementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: A, 
B, C, D, E, and L. Ihe first letter of a test name identifies the class to 
which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B and 
class L tests are expected to produce errors at conpile time and link time, 
respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner aund produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result vdien they 
are executed. Three Ada library units, the ^ckages REPORT and SPPRT13, 
and the procedure CHECK FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT 
also provides a set of Tdentity functions used to defeat soine conpiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these xonits are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a conpiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is conpiled and the 
resulting conpilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada inplementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Standard involving ttpjltiple, separately conpiled units. Errors 
are expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
inplementation-specific values — for exanple, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests auid 
inplementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this inplementation are described in section 2.3. 


1-2 





INTRODUCTION 


For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by the 
AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications described in 
the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see section 2.1), and 
possibly removing some inapplicable tests (see section 2.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC am Ada inplementation must process each test of 
the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives v^iich are irrelevant 
for a given A/^ implementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may 
be supported by documents issued by the ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and commonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Commentaries are included as 
appropriate.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


The following 201 tests have floating-point type declarations 
requiring more digits than SYSTEM.MAX DIGITS: 


C24113L..Y (14 tests) 
C35706L..Y (14 tests) 
C35708L..Y (14 tests) 
C45241L..Y (14 tests)

C45521L..Z (15 tests) 
C45621L..Z (15 tests) 
C46012L..Z (15 tests) 


The following 20 tests check for the predefined type LONG_INTEGER; for 
this implementation, there is no such type: 


C35404C 

C45502C 

C45613C 

C55B07A 


C45231C 

C45503C

C45412C 

C45611C 

B52004D 

CD7101F 


C35713C, B86001U, and C86006G check for the predefined type 

IXM3_FLOAT; for this inplementation, there is no such type. 


C35713D amd B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with a 
name other than FLOAT, LONG FLOAT, or SHORT_FLOAT; for this 
inplementation, there is no such ty^. 


A35801E checks that FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST may be used as a range 
constraint in a floating-point type declaration; for this 
inplementation, that range exceeds the range of safe numbers of the 
largest predefined floating-point type and must be rejected. (See 
section 2.3.) 


C45531M..P amd C45532M..P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations for 
types that require a SYSTEM.MAX__manTISSA of 47 or greater; for this 
implementation, MAX_MANTISSA is less than 47. 

C45624A..B (2 tests) check that the proper exception is raised if 
MAOlINEjOVERFLCWS is FALSE for floating point types amd the results of 
various floating-point operations lie outside the range of the base 
type; for this inplementation, MACHINE_0VERFLCIWS is TRUE. 

B86001Y uses the name of a predefined fixed-point type other than type 
DURATION; for this inplementation, there is no such type. 

C96005B uses values of type DURATION'S base type that are outside the 
range of type DURATION; for this inplementation, the ranges are the 
same. 


CD1009C checks vdiether a length clause can specify a non-default size 
for a floating-point type; this implementation does not support such 
sizes. 


2-2 




IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDQTCIES 


CD2A84A, CD2A84C, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use length clauses 
to specify non-defa\alt sizes for access types; this iinplenientation 
does not support such sizes. 

The tests listed in the following table checJc that USE_ERROR is raised 
if the given file operations are not supported for the given 
combination of mode and access method; this implementation supports 
these operations.

file capacity. 

CE3304A checks that SET_LINE LENGTH and SET_PAGE_LENGTH raise 
USE_ERROR if they specify eui Tnappropriate value for the external 
file; there are no inappropriate values for this implementation. 

CE3413B checks that PAGE raises LAYOUT ERROR when the value of the 
page nvnnber exceeds COUNT'LAST; for this Tmplementation, the value of 
COUNT'LAST is greater than 150000, making the checking of this 
objective impractical.

IMPLEMENTATIW DEPENDENCIES 


2.3 TEST M0D1FICATIC»IS 

Mcxlifications (see section 1.3) were required for 21 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
implementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the 
way expected by the original tests.

BD4003A 


A35801E was graded inappliccible by Evaluation Modification as directed by 
the AVO. The compiler rejects the use of the range 

FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST as the range constraint of a floating-point type 
declaration because the bounds lie outside of the range of safe numbers 
(cf. LRM 3.5.7:12). 


CD1009A, CD1009I, CD1C03A, CD2A24A, CD2A31A..C (3 tests) were graded 
passed ^ Evaluation Modification as directed by the AVO. These tests use 
instantiations of the support procedure LENGTH_CHECK, which uses 
Unchecked_Conversion according to the interpretation given in Al-00590. 

Hie AVO ruled that this interpretation is not binding under ACVC 1.11; the 
tests are ruled to be passed if they produce Failed messages only from the 
instances of LENGTH_CHECK—i.e, the allowed Report.Failed messages have 
the general form; 

" * CHECK W REPRESENTATIC»J FOR <TYPE ID> FAILED."

PROCESSING INFORMATIOI 


3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming 
Language Standard, vdiether the test is applicable or inapplicable; 
otherwise, the Ada Inplementation fails the ACVC [Pro903. 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard- 

The list of items below gives the number of ACVC tests in various 
categories. All tests were processed, except those that were withdrawn 
because of test errors (item b; see section 2.1), those that require a 
floating-point precision that exceeds the implementation's maximum 
precision (item e; see section 2.2), and those that depend on the support 
of a file system — if none is supported (item d). All tests passed, 
except those that are listed in sections 2.1 and 2.2 (counted in items b 
and f, below). 


a) Total Number of ^plicable Tests 3807 

b) Total Number of Withdrawn Tests 95 

c) Processed Inapplicable Tests 67 

d) Non-Processed I/O Tests 0

3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the vali^tion team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were loaded onto a Sun Workstation and copied over Ethernet 
to the host computer. 


After the test files were loaded onto the host computer, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 


Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the customer and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a complete listing of 
the processing options for this implementation. It also indicates the 
default options. The options invoked explicitly for validation testing 
during this test were:

COMPILATIC»I SYSTEM OPTIONS 


The conpiler options of this Ada inplementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer, unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to conpiler documentation and 
not to this report. 


ada 


Ada conpiler 
Syntax 

ada (options] [source_file]..• [linker_options] 

(objGCt_file.o]... ” 

Options 

“# identifier type value (define) Define an identifier of a 
specified type and value. See Chapter , VADS ADA PREPROCESSOR 
REFERENCE. 

-a file_name (archive) Treat filejname as an object 
archive file created by ar. Since some archive files end 
with .a, -a is used to distinguish archive files from Ada 
source files. 

-d (dependencies) Analyze for dependencies only. Do not do 
semantic analysis or code generation. Update the library, 
marking any defined units as unconpiled. Ihe -d option is 
used by a.make to establish dependencies among new files. 

-e (error) Process conpilation error messages using a.error 
and send it to standard output. Only the source lines containing 
errors are listed. Only one -e or -E option should be used. 

-E 

-E file 


B-1 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-E directory (error output) Without a file or directory 
argument, ada processes error messages using a-error eund 
directs a brief output to standard output; the raw error 
messages are left in ada_source.err. If a file pathname is 
given, the raw error messages are placed in that file. If a 
directo^ argument is supplied, the raw error output is 
placed in dir/source. 

err- The file of raw error messages can be used as input to 
a.error 

-el (error listing) Intersperse error messages among source 
lines and direct to standard output. 


-El 


-El file 

-El directory (error listing) Same as the -E option, except 
that source listing with errors is produced. 

-ev (error vi(l)) Process syntax error messages using 
a.error, embed them in the source file, and call the 
environment editor ERROR_EDITOR. (If ERROR_EDITOR is 
defined, the environment variable ERROR_PATTERN should also 
be defined. ERROR_PATTERN is an editor search command that 
locates the first occurrence of '###' in the error file.) If 
no editor is specified, vi(l) is invoked. 

-K (keep) Keep the intermediate language (IL) file 

produced by the compiler front end. The IL file will be 

placed in the .objects directory, with the file name Ada_source.i 

-L library_name (library) Operate in VADS library 
library_name (the current working directory is the default). 

-lfile_abbreviation (library search) This is an option 
passed to the UNIX linker, ld(l) telling it to search the 
specified library file. (No space between the -1 and the 
file abbreviation.) 

For a description of the file abbreviations, see also 
Operating system docvanentation, ld(l). 

-M unit_name (main) Produce an executable program by 
linking the named unit as the main program. unit_name must 
already be con?)iled. It must be either a parameterless 
procedure or a parameterless function returning an integer. 

The executable program will be named a.out unless overridden 
with the -o option. 

-M source_file (main) Produce an executable program by 
coinjiling and linking source_file. The main unit of the 


B-2 




a»5PILATIC»I SYSTEM OPTIONS 


program is assumed to be the root name of the .a file (for 
foo.a the unit is foo). Only one .a file may be preceded by 
-M. The executable program will be named a.out vmless 
overridden with the -o option. 

-o executable file (output) This option is to be used in 
conjunction wTth the -M option. executable_file is the name 
of the executable rather than the default a.out. 

-O[0-9) (optimize) Invoke the code optimizer {0PTIM3). An 
optional digit (there is no space before the digit) provides 
the level of optimization. The default is -04. 

-O full optimization 

-OO prevents optimization 

-01 no hoisting 

-02 no hoisting but more passes 

-03 no hoisting but even more passes 

-04 hoisting from loops 

-05 hoisting from loops but more passes 

-06 hoisting from loops with maximum passes 

-07 hoisting from loops and branches 

-08 hoisting from loops and branches, more passes 

-09 hoisting from loops and branches, maximum passes 

Hoisting from branches (and cases alternatives) cem be slow 
and does not always provide significant performance gains so 
it can be suppressed. 

For more information about optimization, see CXiMFILING AEIA 
PROGRAMS, Conpiler Optimizations on page. See also pragma 
OPTIMIZE_CODE(OFF) on page. 

-P Invoke the Ada Preprocessor. See Chapter , VADS ADA 
PREPROCESSOR REFERENCE. 

-R VADS_library (reconcile instantiation) Force analysis 
of all generic instantiations, causing reinstantiation of 
any that are out of date. 

-S (suppress) Apply pragma SUPPRESS to the entire 
compilation for all suppressible checks. (See also pragma 
SUPPRESS(ALL_CHEC:KS) on page. 


B-3 




COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-sh (shew) Display the name of the tool executable but do 
not execute it. 

-T (timing) Print timing information for the conpilation. 

-V (verbose) Print compiler version nvnnber, date and time 
of compilation, name of file conpiled, command input line, 
total conpilation time, and error summary line. Storage 
usage information about the object file is provided. With 
OPTIM3 the output format of conpression (the size of 
optimized instructions) is as a percentage of input 
(unoptimized instructions). 

-w (warnings) Suppress warning diagnostics. 

Description 

The commcuid ada executes the Ada conpiler and conpiles the 
named Ada source file, ending with the .a suffix. The file 
must reside in a VADS library directory. The ada.lib file in 
this directory is modified after each Ada unit is conpiled. 

By default, ada produces only object and net files. If the 
-M option is used, the conpiler automatically invoices a.Id 
and builds a complete program with the named library unit as 
the main program. 

Non-Ada object files (.o files produced by a conpiler for 
another language) may be given as arguments to ada. These 
files will be passed on to the linker and will be linked 
with the specified Ada object files. 

Command line options may be specified in any order, but the 
order of conpilation etnd the order of the files to be passed 
to the linker can be significant. 

Several VADS conpilers may be simultaneously available on a 
single system. Because the ada cemsnand in any 
VADS location/bin on a system will execute the correct 
conpTler conponents based upon visible library directives, 
the option -sh is provided to print the name of the 
conponents actually executed. 

Program listings with a disassembly of machine code 
instructions are generated by a.db or a.das. 

See also a.das on page ; a.db on page ; a.error on page ; 
a.Id on page ; a.mklib on page ; and Operating System 
reference documentation for the ld(l) utility. 

Diagnostics 

The diagnostics produced by the VADS conpiler are intended 
to be self-explanatory. Most refer to the RM. Elach RM reference

CCMPILATIW SYSTEM OPTIONS 


all Ada and other language objects required to produce an 
executable image in a.out.unit_name is the main program cind 
must name a non-generic subprogram. If unit_name is a 
function, it must return a value of the type STANDARD.INTEGER. 
This integer result will be passed back to the UNIX shell as 
the status code of the execution. The utility uses the net 
files produced by the Ada conpiler to check dependency 
information, a.Id produces an exception mapping table and a 
unit elaboration table and passes this information to the linker. 

a.Id reads instructions for generating executables from the 
ada.lib file in the VADS libraries on the search list. 

Besides information generated by the conpiler, these 
directives also include WITEIn directives that allow the 
automatic linking of object modules compiled from other 
languages or Ada object modules not named in context clauses 
in the Ada source. Any n\miber of WITHn directives may be 
placed into a library, but they must be numbered 
contiguously beginning at WITHl. The directives are recorded 
in the library's ada.lib file and have the following form. 

WITHl: Lir^K: ob ject_f ile: 

WITH2:LINK:archive_file: 

WITHn directives may be placed in the local Ada libraries or 
in any vadS library on the search list. 

A WITHn directive in a local VADS lil rary or earlier on the 
library search list will hide tlie same numbered WITHn 
directive in a library later in the library search list. 

Use the tool a.info to change cr report library directives 
in the current library. 

All arguments after unit_name are passed on to the linker. 

These may be options for it, archive libraries, library 
abbreviations, or object files. 

VADS_location/bin/a.ld is a wrapper program that executes 
the correct executeible based upon directives visible in the 
ada.lib file. This permits multiple VADS compilers to exist 
on the same host. The -sh option prints the name of the 
actual executable file.

APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


ATTACHMENT I 


APPENDIX F. Inplementation-Dependent Characteristics 


1. Inplementation-Dependent Pragmas 

1.1. INITIALIZE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers STATIC or DYNAMIC as the single 
argument. This pragma is only allowed within a library- 
level package spec or body. It specifies that all objects 
in the package be initialized as requested by the pragma 
(i.e. statically or dynamically). Only library-level 
objects are subject to static initialization; all objects 
within procedures are always (by definition) dynamic. If 
pragma INITIALIZE(STATIC) is used, and em object cannot be 
initialized statically, code will be generated to initialize 
the object and a warning message will be generated. 

1.2. INLINE_ONLY Pragma 

Ihe INLINE_ONLY pragma, when used in the same way as pragma 
INLINE, indicates to the compiler that the subprogram must 
always be inlined. Hiis pragma also suppresses the genera¬ 
tion of a callable version of the routine v^iich saves code 
space. If a user erroneously makes an INLINEjONLY s\abpro- 
gram recursive a warning message will be emitted and an 
PROGRAM_ERROR will be raised at run time. 

1.3. BUILT_IN Pragma 

The BUILT IN pragma is used in the implementation of scmie 
predefineH Ada packages, but provides no user access. It is 
used only to implement code bcxiies for v^iich no actual Ada 
body can be provided, for example the MACHINE_CODE package. 

1.4. SHARE_CODE Pragma 

The SHARE_CODE pragma takes the name of a generic instantia¬ 
tion or a generic unit as the first argument and one of the 
identifiers TRUE or FALSE as the second argument. This 
pragma is only allowed immediately at the place of a 


C-2 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


declarative item in a declarative part or package specifica¬ 
tion, or after a library unit in a conpilation, but before 
any sxibsequent conpilation unit. 

When the first argument is a generic unit the pragma applies 
to all instantiations of that generic. When the first argu¬ 
ment is the name of a generic instantiation the pragma 
applies only to the specified instantiation, or overloaded 
instantiations. 

If the second argument is TRUE the compiler will try to 
share code generated for a generic instantiation with code 
generated for other instantiations of the same generic. 
When the second argument is FALSE each instantiation will 
get a unique copy of the generated code. The extent to 
which code is shared between instantiations depends on this 
pragma and the kind of generic formal parameters declared 
for the generic unit. 

The name pragma SHARE_BODy is also recognized by the imple¬ 
mentation and has the same effect as SHARE_CODE. It is 
included for conpatability with earlier versions of VADS. 

1.5. NO_IMAGE Pragma 

The pragma suppresses the generation of the image array used 
for the IMAGE attribute of enumeration types. This elim¬ 
inates the overhead required to store the array in the exe¬ 
cutable image. An attempt to use the IMAGE attribute on a 
type whose image array has been suppressed will resxilt in a 
compilation warning and PROGRAM_ERROR raised at run time. 

1.6. EXTERNAL_NAME Pragma 

The EXTERNAL NAME pragma takes the name of a subprogram or 
variable deTined in Ada and allows the user to specify a 
different external name that may be used to reference the 
entity from other languages. Hie pragma is allowed at the 
place of a declarative item in a package specification and 
must apply to an object declared earlier in the same package 
specification. 

1.7. INTERFACE_NAME Pragma 

The INTERFACE_NAME pragma takes the name of a a variable or 
subprogram defined in another language and allows it to be 
referenced directly in Ada. The pragma will replace all 
occurrences of the variable or subprogram name with an 
external reference to the second, link_argument. The pragma 
is allowed at the place of a declarative item in a package 
specification and must apply to an object or subprogram 
declared earlier in the same package specification. The 
object must be declared as a scalar or an access type. The 


C-3 






APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


object cannot be any of the following: 
a loop variable, 
a constant, 

an initialized variable, 
ein array, or 
a record. 

1.8. IMPLICIT_CODE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers (»I or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies that inplicit code generated by the 
conpiler be allowed or disallowed. A warning is issued if 
OFF is used and any inplicit code needs to be generated. 
The default is ON. 

1.9. OPTIMIZE_CODE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine c^e 
procedure. It specifies v^ether the code should be optim¬ 
ized by the conpiler. The default is ON. When OFF is 
specified, the coirpiler will generate the code as specified. 

2. Iirpleroentation of Predefined Pragmas 

2.1. CONTROLLED 

This pragma is recognized by the inplementation but has no 
effect. 

2.2. ELABORATE 

This pragma is inplemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.3. INLINE 

This pragma is inplemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.4. INTERFACE 

This pragma supports calls to 'C' and FORTRAN functions. The 
Ada subprograms can be either ftmctions or procedures. The 
types of parameters and the result type for functions must 
be scalar, access or the predefined type ADDRESS in SYSTEM. 
All parameters must have mode IN. Record and array objects 
can be passed by reference using the ADDRESS attribute. 

2.5. LIST 

This pragma is implemented as described in appendix B of the 


C-4 







APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


Ada RM. 

2.6. MEMORY_SIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the inplementation. The inple- 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas/ the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.7. NON_REENTRANT 

Hiis pragma takes one argument \diich can be the name of 
either a library subprogram or a subprogram declared immedi¬ 
ately within a library package spec or body. It indicates 
to the conpiler that the subprogram will not be called 
recursively allowing the compiler to perform specific optim¬ 
izations. The pragma ceui be applied to a subprogram or a 
set of overloaded sxibprograms within a package spec or pack¬ 
age body. 

2.8. NOT_ELABORATED 

This pragma can only appear in a library package specifica¬ 
tion. It indicates that the package will not be elaborated 
because it is either part of the RTS, a configuration pack¬ 
age or an Ada package that is referenced from a language 
other than Ada. The presence of this pragma suppresses the 
generation of elaboration code and issues warnings if ela¬ 
boration code is required. 

2.9. OPTIMIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 

2.10. PACK 

This pragma will cause the compiler to choose a non-aligned 
representation for composite types. It will not causes 
objects to be packed at the bit level. 

2.11. PAGE 

This pragma is implemented as described in appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.12. PASSIVE 

The pragma has three forms : 

PRAGMA PASSIVE; 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(SEMAPHORE); 

PRAGMA PASSIVE (INTERRUPT, <nuroh':r>); 


C-5 





APPENDIX F OF TEiE Ada STANDARD 


This pragma Pragma passive can be applied to a task or task 
type declared immediately within a library package spec or 
bo^. The pragma directs the compiler to optimize certain 
tasking operations. It is possible that the statements in a 
task body will prevent the intended optimization, in these 
cases a warning will be generated at compile time and will 
raise TASKING_ERROR at runtime- 

2.13. PRIORITY 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RN. 

2.14. SHARED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 


2.15. STORAGE_UNIT 

This pragma is recognized by the in?)lementation. The iitple- 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.16. SUPPRESS 

This pragma is implemented as described, except that 
DIVIGIC»J_C3iECK and in some cases OVERFLCW_CHECK cannot be 
suppressed. 

2.17. SYSTEM_NAME 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package miust be recompiled. 

3. Implementation-Dependent Attributes 

3.1. P'REF 

For a prefix that denotes an object, a program unit, a 
label, or an entry; 

This attribute denotes the effective address of the first of 
the storage units allocated to P. For a subprogram, pack¬ 
age, task unit, or label, it refers to the address of the 
machine code associated with the corresponding body or 
statement. For an entry for \4iich an address clause has 
been given, it refers to the corresponding hardware inter¬ 
rupt. The attribute is of the type OPERAND defined in the 
package MACHINE_CCX)E. The attribute is only allowed within 
a machine code procedure. 


C-6 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


See section F.4.8 for more information on the use of this 
attribute. 

(For a package, task unit, or entry, the 'REF attribute is 
not supported.) 

3.2. T'TASKID 

For a task object or a value T, T'TASK_ID yields the unique 
task id associated with a task. The value of this attribute 
is of the type ADDRESS in the package SYSTEM.

5. Restrictions On Representation Clauses 
5.1. Pragma PACK 

In the absence of pragma PACK record components are padded 
so as to provide for efficient access by the target 
hardware, pragma PACK applied to a record eliminate the pad¬ 
ding v^ere possible. Pragma PACK has no other effect on the 
storage allocated for record ccanponents a record representa¬ 
tion is required. 








APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


5.2. Size Clauses 

For scalar types a representation clause will pack to the 
number of bits required to represent the range of the s\ab- 
type. A size clause applied to a record type will not cause 
packing of conpanents; an explicit record representation 
clause must be given to specify the packing of the 
components. A size clause applied to a record type will 
cause packing of components only vdien the component type is 
a discrete type. An error will be issued if there is insuf¬ 
ficient space allocated. The SIZE attribute is not sup¬ 
ported for task, access, or floating point types. 

5.3. Address Clauses 

Address clauses are only supported for variables. Since 
default initialization of a variable requires evalxiation of 
the variable address elaboration ordering requirements 
prohibit initialization of a variables v^ich have address 
clauses. The specified address indicates the physical 
address associated with the variable. 

5.4. Interrupts 

Interrupt entr*..- -.re supported with the following interpre¬ 
tation and res^i-ctions: 

An interr pt entry may not have any parameters. 

A passive task that contains one or more interrupt entries 
moist always be trying to accept each interrupt entry, unless 
it is handling the interrupt. The task must be executing 
either an accept for the entry (if there is only one) or a 
select statement where the interrupt entry accept alterna¬ 
tive is open as defined by Ada RM 9.7.1(4). This is not a 
restriction on normal tasks (i.e., signal ISRs). 

An interrupt acts as a conditional entry call in that inter¬ 
rupts are not queued (see the last sentence of Ada RM 
13.5.1(2) and 13.5.1(6)). 

No additional requirements are imposed for a select state¬ 
ment containing both a terminate alternative and an accept 
alternative for an interrupt entry (see Ada RM 13.5.1(3)). 

Direct calls to an interrupt entry from another task are 
allowed and are treated as a normal task rendezvous. 

Interrupts are not queued. 

The address clause for an interrupt entry does not specify 
the priority of the interrupt. It simply specifies the 


C-9 




APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


interrupt vector number. For passive ISRs, the nnn of the 
passive(interrupt,nnn) pragma specifies the interrupt prior¬ 
ity of the task. 

5.5. Representation Attributes 

The ADDRESS attribute is not supported for the following 
entities: 

Packages 

Tasks 

Labels 

Entries 


5.6. Machine Code Insertions 
Machine code insertions are supported. 

The general definition of the package MACHINE_CODE provides 
an assembly language interface for the target machine. It 
provides the necessary record type(s) needed in the code 
statement, an enumeration type of all the opcode mneumonics, 
a set of register definitions, and a set of addressing mode 
functions. 

The general syntax of a machine code statement is as fol¬ 
lows: 


CC®E_n'( opcode, operand {, operand} ); 

T^iere n indicates the number of operands in the aggregate. 

A special case arises for a variable niunber of operands. 
The operands are listed within a subaggregate. The format 
is as follows: 

OODE_N'( opcode, (operand {, operand}) ); 

For those opcodes that require no operands, named notation 
must be used (cf. RM 4.3(4)). 

OCX)E_0'( op -> opcode ); 

The opcode must be an enumeration literal (i.e. it cannot be 
an object, attribute, or a rename). 

An operand can only be an entity defined in MACHINE_CC®E or 
the 'REF attribute. 

The arguments to any of the functions defined in 
MACHINE_C(X)E must be static expressions, string literals, or 
the functions defined in MACHINE CODE. The 'REF attribute 


C-10 








APPENDIX F OF IHE Ada STANDARD 


may not be used as an argument in any of these functions. 
Inline expansion of machine code procedures is sx;^ported. 

6. Conventions for Inplementation-generated Names 
There are no implementation-generated neunes. 

7. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clauses 

Address expressions in an address clause are interpreted as 
physical addresses. 

8. Restrictions on Unchecked Conversions 
None. 

9. Restrictions on Unchecked Deallocations 
None. 


10. loplementation Characteristics of I/O Packages 

Instantiations of DIRECT_IO use the value MAX REC_SIZE as 
the record size (expressed in STORAGE_UNITS) ^en the size 
of ELEMENT_TOTE exceeds that value. For exaitple for uncon¬ 
strained arrays such as string viiere elemeut_TYPE'SIZE is 
very large, MAX_REC_SIZE is used instead. MAX_RECORD_SIZE 
is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a program before 
instantiating DIRECT_IO to provide an upper limit on the 
record size. In any case the maximum size supported is 1024 
X 1024 X STORAGE_UNIT bits. DIRECT_IO will raise USE_ERROR 
if MAX_REC_SIZE exceeds this absolute limit. 

Instantiations of SEQUENTIAL_IO use the value MAX_REC_SIZE 
as the record size (expressed in STORAGE_UNITS) when the 
size of RT.RM RNT_TVPR exceeds that value. For example for 
unconstrained arrays such as string vdiere ELEMENTJTYPE'SIZE 
is very large, MAX REC_SIZE is used instead. 
MAX_RECC»D SIZE is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a 
program beTore instantiating INTEGER_IC' to provide an upper 
limit on the record size. SEQUQJTIAL_IO imposes no limit on 
MAX_REC_SIZE. 

11. Inplementation Limits 

The following limits are actually enforced by the inplemen- 
tation. It is not intended to inply that resources up to or 
even near these limits are available to every program. 


C-11 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


11.1. Line Length 

The implementation supports a maucimum line length of 500 
characters including the end of line character. 

11.2. Record and Array Sizes 

The maximum size of a statically sized array type is 
4,000,000 X STORAGEJUNITS. The maximum size of a statically 
sized record type is 4,000,000 x STORAGEJUNITS. A record 
type or array type declaration that exceeds these limits 
will generate a warning message. 

11.3. Default Stack Size for Tasks 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGE_SIZE length specifica¬ 
tion every task except the main program is allocated a fixed 
size stack of 10,240 STORAGEJUNITS- This is the value 
returned by T'STORAGE_SIZE for a task type T. 

11.4. Default Collection Size 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGE_SIZE length attribute 
the default collection size for an access type is 100 times 
the size of the designated type. Ihis is the value returned 
by T'STORAGE_SIZE for an access type T. 

11.5. Limit on Declared Objects 

There is an eibsolute limit of 6,000,000 x STORAGE_UNITS for 
objects declared statically within a compilation unit. If 
this value is exceeded the compiler will terminate the com¬ 
pilation of the unit with a FATAL error message.
