General-Purpose Front End for Real-Time Data Processing 

NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California 


FRONTIER is a computer program 
that functions as a front end for any of 
a variety of other software of both the 
artificial intelligence (AI) and conven- 
tional data-processing types. As used 
here, “front end’’ signifies interface 
software needed for acquiring and pre- 
processing data and making the data 
available for analysis by the other soft- 
ware. FRONTIER is reusable in that it 
can be rapidly tailored to any such 
other software with minimum effort. 
Each component of FRONTIER is pro- 
grammable and is executed in an em- 


bedded virtual machine. Each compo- 
nent can be reconfigured during execu- 
tion. The virtual-machine implementa- 
tion making FRONTIER independent 
of the type of computing hardware on 
which it is executed. 

The top-level elements of FRONTIER 
are written in the C language for real- 
time performance. However, configura- 
tion-setup, preprocessing, conversion, 
advanced analysis (AI) algorithms and 
noise-source definitions are written in a 
virtual language that can be downloaded 
to each of its components while they are 


running to provide hot swaps of soft- 
ware. FRONTIER is composed of one 
non-reusable component and seven 
reusable ones. The non-reusable compo- 
nent is the one that interfaces to the ex- 
ternal world to acquire the data. 

This program was written by Mark James 
of Caltech for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Labora- 
tory. Further information is contained in a 
TSP (seepage 1).
