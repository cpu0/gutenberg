'5. COMPUTER PRODUCT ABSTRACT 


. / - 1 . - r.s 

The objective of the "Space System Cost Study", Contract MDA97£87C0Q5, was to a methodology and 
automated database/model that would enable DARPA to evaluate "low cost satellite’^programs and appro¬ 
priate cost reduction approaches. The initial step in this cost study was to derive an estimate for develop¬ 
ing and producing a "light" satellite under^business as usuaTconditions. These conditions include a -start 
from scratcf/phiiosophy and all the traditional operating procedures and documentation associated with 
building a reliable spacecraft. j 

The significance'bf the baseline cost modeling effort was to determine a Cost estimate that would represent 
the current culture of the satellite industry. This culture generally follows a "business as usual", "start from 
scratch" development approach. The baseline program emulates a typical fepace Division (U.S. Air Force> ' 
Space Divisionfidii-Std 1450B-type spacecraft. The vehicle mission type used for the analysis is a commu- 
nications-radio relay spacecraft. The cost estimates and trades to the baseline developed as a result of this 
study, are applicable to any spacecraft'that contains a similar functional mix of structure, payload, and 
electronics. / , 

The modeling process included evaluating three phases of hardware and software activities: the Develop¬ 
ment Phase, the Produceability Engineering Phase (PEP), and the Production Phase. The baseline program 
included cost values for each discrete item (up to 112) for the three phases of effort: Development, PEP, and 
Production. The 112 discrete items modeled and their costs were contained in the automated database/ 
model, Each item carried through the PEP and Production Phases, if appropriate. 

After the baseline program cost values were established (modeled), a list of candidate cost variables was 
established. These variables represent cost reduction approaches that address virtually all elements compris- 
inging the total program cost. The cost variables were targeted as items that could be controlled by the 
contracting agency or contractor. This control could be exerted either by specifications or special instructions 
to exclude/incude the activity from a normal spacecraft development approach. All of the investigated candi¬ 
date variables had a potential for program cost savings. Each had three options or degrees of sensitivity. This 
implied that the activities associated with candidate variables could be implemented completely or as a sub¬ 
set. The automated database/model (DARPASS) contains the cost results for each item/task for each candi¬ 
date variable (Primary and Secondary) and the three options for each. The total number of results derived as
