14. ABSTRACT 

The overarching vision of this project is to help people with diabetes better manage their condition by providing them with a 
tool that will make self-management less confusing, less stressful, and less constrained. This is a two-phase project. In phase 
1, we designed an Internet-based and mobile application (software) to assist with the following domains pertinent to diabetes 
self-management: 1) nutrition/diet (healthy eating) 2) physical activity (being active); 3) blood glucose (self-monitoring); 4) 
medications (tracking and adherence only); 5) outlook and beliefs; and 6) reducing risks through recommended medical visits, 
lab testing. Although not a primary focus, the application also addresses weight management and loss. The application is 
called Tracking My Diabetes (TMD). Using information that TMD receives on these self-management domains (from the user’s 
own monitoring/journaling devices that store data in Microsoft HealthVault and/or from the user’s manual data entry directly 
into TMD), TMD analyzes, interprets, provides feedback, and makes recommendations bolstered by educational content on 
diabetes self-management. All of the feedback and recommendations are focused on lifestyle. Some feedback provides 
information on the relationships among the various self-care domains. In phase 2, the project is conducting a brief pilot study 
of the clinical efficacy of the PHR-A in people with diabetes. The main outcome is glycemic control.

INTRODUCTION 


Despite the well-documented benefits of glycemic control 1,2 and a secular trend to 
overall improvement in people with diabetes, 3 glycemic control is still sub-optimal in 
many patients. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 
43.2% of people with diabetes had Ale levels greater than or equal to the generally 
recommended target of 7.0%. 3 Achieving target glycemic control typically requires a 
multi-factorial approach, with considerable commitment from the person with diabetes to 
examine and correctly interpret random blood glucose readings, take medications as 
prescribed, follow a balanced, whole foods-based diet and engage in regular physical 
activity. For a variety of reasons, many people with diabetes do not or cannot adhere to 
these requirements; 4 ' 8 failure to do so may be due to inadequate education about the 
purpose and outcomes of such behaviors and the absence of support and/or reminders. 

Thus, the overall objective of this project is to develop (phase 1) and test (phase 2) a 
new tool for diabetes self-management that provides education, reminders, and support. 
The new tool is an internet-based and mobile application (software), now called 
Tracking My Diabetes (TMD). Our central hypothesis is that an application (such as 
TMD) that coordinates the major components of diabetes self-management, is mobile, 
provides decision support with actionable options, and is based on user input, will 
enhance diabetes self-care, improve glycemic control, and lower psychological distress 
related to diabetes. During development (phase 1), we created the functional 
requirements, rules and algorithms for TMD, and then coded these rules and algorithms 
to create a functioning, Internet-based tool. The study (phase 2) is a test of the TMD’s 
clinical efficacy when used for 3 months by a cohort of people with diabetes. 


BODY 

TASK 1. Draft functional requirements - COMPLETE 

This is the first task that the project completed, and is foundational for the rest of the 
work. THIS INFORMATION HAS BEEN REPORTED PREVIOUSLY, BUT WE 
INCLUDE IT HERE FOR CONTINUITY OF DOCUMENTATION. 

To complete this task, the project identified, discrete, user-friendly ‘modules’ that 
address the main components of diabetes care. The modules, borrowed from the 
American Association of Diabetes Educators are: 

• Healthy Eating 

• Being Active 

• Outlook 

• Medications 

• Monitoring (weight and blood glucose) 

• Reducing Risks 


4 




Although not a separate module per se, the application also includes weekly diabetes 
tips (or twice weekly, depending on user preference) that cover the above areas (the 
user chooses the areas). We have drafted tips pertaining to the above areas. 

Furthermore, the ‘Reducing Risks’ module is not stand-alone; rather it is incorporated 
into the user’s Home Page and addresses issues such as lab results and appointment 
reminders. 

We submitted the Functional Requirement Document (Task 1) to Stacey Zimmerman, 
who has since left TATRC. The following is excerpted from the Functional Requirement 
Document submitted. We are including this information here because the contract 
transitioned from the TRUE Research Foundation to the Geneva Foundation, 
resulting in a new contract number, and we are not sure if all artifacts of the 
project were transferred with it. Note, the second task describes changes to the 
requirements that came out of our process for obtaining feedback. 


START OF EXCERPT FROM FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT 

A. Operating Environment 

The PHR-A is a web-based application that consists of: 

Two user interfaces 

o An HTML and JavaScript browser-based front end designed for the desktop 
o An HTML and JavaScript browser-based front end designed for mobile Smartphones 
A Java-based framework utilizing Apache Struts on the server 
Relational database to handle data storage requirements 

B. PHR-A Technical Requirements Summary 
Technical Architecture / Deployment Module 

The PHR-A must be designed to be deployed as one universally-available application. 

Specific technical architecture guidelines can be found in the PHR-A Technical Architecture Document. 

User Prerequisites 

While intended to support the person with diabetes, the PHR-A will be publicly-available to anyone 
interested in using it. No formal training is required. However, some baseline familiarity with internet 
technologies will be necessary to interact with the various application modules. 

Use of the desktop browser Version requires only basic internet connectivity and a reasonably modern 
computer. 


Use of the mobile Version requires a device with both internet connectivity and an internet browser. 

Some components of the PHR-A utilize data from third-party Personal Health Record (PHR) data 
repositories, such as Microsoft HealthVault. In order to take advantage of those components users will be 
required to both create their personal account and facilitate the transfer of their personal health record 
information.

Desktop User Interface Guidelines 

The following user interface guidelines should be used in implementing the desktop Version of the PHR- 
A. 

1. Desktop page size will be optimized for a resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels. The application will be 
usable at lower resolutions, but may require horizontal and vertical scrolling. 

2. The application will be targeted for multi-browser support. 

3. Each page of the application will contain a page title. 

4. The desktop client will display the username of the user who is logged in, a link to logout, and a 
link to access the user’s personal settings. 

5. For all date fields the following behaviors will be implemented: 

a. A Calendar should be enabled for all date fields that are not likely to have dates older 
than 5 years entered to allow the user to graphically select the date. 

b. If the user enters only a 4 digit year the date will default to “01/01” of the entered year. 

c. If the user presses the “t” key on the keyboard in the date field the current date will 
display. 

6. The user will be able to sort the contents of a panel within the desktop client by clicking on the 
column header within the Panel. 

a. The first click on a column header will sort the data in ascending order. 

b. The second click on the same column header will sort the data in descending order. 

c. Subsequent clicks on the same column header will alternate the sort order between 
ascending and descending. 

7. Data entry pages will exhibit the following interface behaviors: 

a. Required fields are designated by using a red “*” to the left of the field label. Additionally 
a “* = Required Field” text will display on the page. 

b. A message prompt will display if the user is editing or adding data and navigates away 
from the page. The prompt will display a message that the data were not saved and the 
user can cancel the navigation or proceed without saving. 

7 





c. Users of the desktop client will be able to navigate through the fields via the TAB key on 
the keyboard. Default tab movement will be from starting at the top and moving left to 
right then top to bottom. Within the sections where the tabbing is different than the 
default a special requirement/consideration will state this fact. 

8. The application will provide context sensitive tool tips (mouseover messages) as much as 
possible to aid the use and navigation of the user. 

Mobile Client User Interface Guidelines 

The following user interface guidelines should be used in implementing the mobile Version of the PHR-A. 

1. Mobile page size will be optimized for a resolution of 480x854 pixels. The application will be 
usable at lower resolutions, but may require horizontal and vertical scrolling. 

2. The application will be targeted for multi-browser support. 

3. Each page of the application will contain a page title. 

Development Best Practices 

To the extent feasible, the PHR-A will follow both the mobile website and mobile application best 
practices published by W3C. The current Versions of these practices may be accessed with the following 
URLs: 

1) http://www.w3.orq/TR/mobile-bp/ 

2) http://www.w3.orq/TR/mwabp/ 


Special Testing Tools/Constraints 

The mobile Version of the PHR-A requires a Smartphone. Smartphone technologies evolve very rapidly 
and vary widely between both manufactures and network carriers. The PHR-A will be designed to work 
on the widest range of devices possible; however it will not be possible to fully test every device on every 
network. Initial development testing will utilize the desktop computer based phone / mobile browser 
emulators typically made available to application developers by the device manufactures. Additional 
information on emulators and a best practices testing approach may be found 
at http://mobiforae.com/testina/storv/a-auide-mobile-emulators . 

After initial emulator based testing is complete, the software will be formally tested using the default web 
browser applications on the following popular Smartphones: 

• Apple iPhone (AT&T 3G network/Apple OS) 

• Blackberry Storm2 (Verizon 3G network/Blackberry OS) 

• Motorola Droid (Verizon 3G network/Google OS) 

• Samsung Omnia (Verizon 3G network/Windows OS)

C. System Functional Requirements 


General 

The PHR-A will consist of three modalities for viewing content and using the application functionality. 
These are the PHR-A website, iGoogle, and a mobile Smartphone. The PHR-A website will be viewable 
in a Smartphone browser, but will not be optimized for the screen size and resolution, only specific 
content will be optimized. Certain functions may be limited to specific modalities and this will be noted in 
each section’s requirements. 

PHR-A Website 

The PHR-A website is the user’s introduction to the PHR-A and will serve as a general marketing and 
informational website. It will allow the user to create an account and access the system functionality. 
Certain functionality will only be available within the PHR-A website.

E. PHR-A Module Content 

The PHR-A implements a cohesive set of user functions loosely modeled around the following American 
Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) recommended topic areas. 

Healthy Eating Module 

The Healthy Eating Module provides users with several related tools aimed at monitoring food intake, 
providing feedback/advice, and helping users to anticipate the effects of certain foods (“What if I ate...” 
analysis). The Healthy Eating Module’s focus is eating a balanced diet of the right food groups (not about 
calorie and/or carbohydrate intake per se). Tracking nutrition intake will utilize a diabetes food pyramid 
methodology whereby the user will track data based on the number of servings they eat from each 
category, such as starches, protein, fruits, vegetables, or high fat or sweet foods. Feedback will be based 
on the user’s eating behavior relative to the pyramid guidelines. Feedback will include information related 
to diabetes and healthy eating habits.

specific information. 


Once a month, the Being Active Module will include the Diabetes Activity Challenge. This is a brief activity 
that will ask the user to record their blood sugar before and after sustained physical activity. The 
application will have specific graphs to show the correlation between the blood sugar levels before and 
after the activity demonstrating how activity can improve blood sugar control.

The Domain Diagram 
above indicates the time 
at which various events 
in the PHRA occur. For 
example, account set-up 
occurs once, and then 
the user can 
maintain/update 
information within this 
domain as needed. The 
entering of information 
pertaining to eating, 
physical activity, 
medications, etc. occurs 
daily. Surveys important 
for feedback on physical 
activity and healthy 
eating, however, take 
place once a week. 
Certain challenges built 
into Version 1 (and 2) 
occur monthly, so as to 
keep the user engaged. 
The project still needs to 
create disclaimer pages 
necessary for public 
distribution.

The medication tab, shown at 
the left, is the aspect of the 
PHRA that allows users to 
track their medications - what 
they are taking and if they 
took it. They can also receive 
tips/reminders on medication, 
and can link out to education 
on particular medications so 
that they can better 
understand a medication’s 
actions. 

This tab does not suggest any 
adjustments to medications. 

Also, while other medications 
are indeed important for 
diabetes management, at this 
time we are addressing only 
diabetes medications. 

Previously we had an insulin 
dose calculator for people 
taking meal-time insulin, but 
the feedback we received led 
us to omit that functionality.

Dsdaimer and Our Views on Psycholog cal I esting 

Our surveys are ntenoed be fin ana educational, and they may help 
increase your awareness of particular esrperences or af particular 
farms of psych-cleg cal distress. They are not by themselves tools far 
diagnosing any type of health or mental health condition. 

Ps^hdogicaJ tests ana surveys should not be unaerslooa as prodding 
any type of diagnoss or healthcare recornmercatjon. 

tathe view of this s4e, self-administered psydiologcal screening tests 
may help to enhance seH- aware ness of one’s owi experences, but 
cannot gve any weH-informed recommenaation about vrfnt shoula be 
done about those escperences. In other words, by asking about 
particular experiences, a psychological test may simply help hi^nli^nt 
elements of these experiences Having these experiences higHi^ted 
may offer an irrfvidual an opportunity tc reflect on them at greater 
length, or to consider their relevance in a broader lie context. What an 
individual chooses to ao — or ’shotid' ohcose to do — wfth the resiJts of 
any giv-Hi test, is a matter ■far the ndivaual and should not be dictated 
by the test itself. 

CONTENT FROM: CcunseJIingResource.coTi 


In Version 1, the Outlook tab (shown here) 
had gaps. The feedback we received said 
that we needed to add more content on the 
rationale for users to complete surveys about 
their outlook, and that certain surveys did not 
belong in this section at all. The feedback 

—- that the PHRA itself gave to users was 

insufficient. Hence, this section has changed.

Task 3. Develop protocol and obtain approval from all appropriate Institutional 

Review Boards for User Testing of Version 1 — COMPLETE 

As mentioned in a prior Quarterly Report, for Task 3 we consulted with local and federal 
human subjects protection review experts. At that time, we learned that we did not need 
a formal protocol for the type of user input we are seeking, and because of the manner 
in which we are seeking it. The reason for this was because a) we were not formerly 
recruiting, b) we were not conducting “research” in the way it is defined, and c) when we 
received input from potential users, we did not collect any personal information from 
them. Indeed, the local IRB would not review a protocol that did not qualify as 
“research.” We instead were instead working with potential users as we would with any 
subject matter experts. 

Using the Diabetes Institute’s quarterly publication of “In Control”, we circulated the 
aforementioned diabetes tips for review by content experts and people with diabetes 
(over 6,000 people receive this publication). We have also provided guided 
demonstrations of the web site to Primary Care Physicians who work with people with 
diabetes and obtained their feedback. 

We also presented a component of this work at the Annual Meeting of the Diabetes 
Technology Society (November) and received useful feedback from diabetes 
technology experts (chiefly scientists, engineers, programmers, and social scientists). 
Their main criticism was that we make sure users are informed that the “decision 
support” the PHR-A gives them could (although not necessarily) contain errors just 
because it contains thousands of lines of computer code. As such, everything the PHR- 
A tells the user must include that disclaimer and urge them to use their own common 
sense as well. Further, the comments focused on the low literacy and numeracy levels 
of the U.S. population (as indicated by research presented at the same panel) and the 
need to insure that the PHR-A is “pitched” toward those low levels so as to make it as 
accessible as possible to a wide variety of people. 

We have been incorporating these and other suggestions. We changed the name of the 
application as part of these changes - Tracking My Diabetes. 


TASK 4. Test Version 1 ofthe Application, incorporate user feedback and 

finalize a Version 2 -COMPLETE 


Due to the cessation of TRUE Research Foundation activities 1 April 2011, and 
the ensuing 4-month hiatus in the life course of the project, completion of this 
task was delayed. However, we have now completed this task. The next series of 
pages shows what Version 2 looks like. To see the ‘live’ application, register

Surveys You Can Take 


Survey 

Text 

Food Survey

structure the feedback that you receive about healthy eating. 

Exercise Survey 

This is your a brief, weekiy survey of your physical activity during the past week. The surveys differ from week-to-week. 
They all help to structure the feedback that you receive about your physical activity. 

Brief Illness Perception (B-IPQ) 

This is a short survey that asks about your beliefs about diabetes. Often the beliefs we have about our health affect how we 
take care of ourselves. The survey has 6 questions. 

Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CESDJ 

The next survey asks about how your mood has been lately. Sometimes our mood affects how we take care of ourselves, 
and sometimes how we take care of ourselves affects our mood! So it is important to know what are mood is like. There are 
20 questions about how you have fell and behaved during the last week. 

Diabetes Distress Screener 

Living with diabetes can sometimes be tough, with lots of hassles and problems that come and go. This next survey asks 
about things about your diabetes that might have bothered you during the past month. If you feel that a particular item is not a 
bother or problem for you, choose T. If it Every bothersome to you, choose '5'

The Being Active tab has a format and function similar to the Healthy Eating tab in that it 
is intended to be simple for you to use, allows you to enter activity you do with a self¬ 
rating of exertion, gives feedback on the data that you enter, and provides a tip of the 
week. The two screen shots below show, first, the first page of the Being Active tab and, 
second, the box for entering activity.

Physical Activity Challenge 




The Being Active tab also includes monthly physical activity challenges, to keep you 
interested and ‘on your toes’, and to show the relationship between physical and activity 
and blood glucose, among other things. You will be prompted to complete these 
regularly. You can choose to ignore them, if you wish. 

Every week, you will also be asked to complete brief surveys (about 5 questions) about 
your diet and physical activity. 

The Medications tab allows you to enter the *diabetes* medications that you are taking 
so that you can track (such as on your smartphone) when you take them and can 
received reminders and education about medications. This functionality is shown in the 
next two graphics. The Medications tab also includes a tip of the week.

Medication Tip of the Week 




The last tab we will show you is the Blood Sugar tab. You can either upload your meter 
readings via Microsoft HealthVault, if you have an account there, or you can enter your 
readings one at a time. 



Blood Sugar Analysis 




42 










Once you have self-monitoring (SMBG) data in TMD, you will be able to look at graphs 
of your glucose trends (highs, lows, etc.) and will be able to overlay (with a graph) your 
trends on your Food Diary, Activity Diary, and Medications Log to see how those 
components of diabetes self-care affect your blood sugar. 

As with the other tabs, the Blood Sugar tab includes a tip of the week. 

For now, we are not reviewing the functionality of the Weight tab, since we don’t want 
you to address weight until you have used TMD for at least 6 weeks and recorded your 
weight every week as prompted.

TASK 5. Develop protocol ancj obtain approval from al[ appropriate 
Institutional Review Boards for Pilot Study, of Version 2 PHR-A - NOT YET 

COMPLETE 

The main elements of the Pilot Study are as follows: 

1) Two-arm, randomized controlled trial lasting for 3 months. Three months is the 
minimum period to observe clinically meaningful changes in diabetes-related outcomes, 
namely Ale. 

2) The sample size needed is 32 per arm (n=64 total). This estimate is based on the 
following assumptions: alpha = 0.05 (two-sided); power = 0.80, mean decline in Ale for 
PHR-A group = 1.0 (sd = 1.0); mean decline in A1 c for attention control group = 0.5 (sd 
= 0.50); n2/n1 = 1.00; number of follow-up measurements = 1; number of baseline 
measurements = 1; correlation between baseline & follow-up = 0.60; method of analysis 
= change. 

Although a larger sample size would have been our preference given how important 
larger samples are for statistically controlling for certain subject characteristics (e.g., 
age, type of diabetes, etc.), this smaller sample is sufficient for a basic test of the 
hypotheses and is consistent with related studies, such as that published in Diabetes 
Technology and Therapeutics regarding a mobile diabetes application called “WellDoc” 
(Quinn et al.. WellDoc™ Mobile Diabetes Management Randomized Controlled Trial: 
Change in Clinical and Behavioral Outcomes and Patient and Physician Satisfaction. 
Diabetes Technology and Therapeutics 2008; 10: 160-168.). 

3) We will require that all study participants have their own smart phones or that they 
will access the application via an Internet-connected computer. 


43 






The protocol is to recruit people with diabetes and randomly allocate them to use the 
PHR-A for 3months or to ‘attention control.’ After confirming eligibility using some simple 
tests of manual dexterity and cognitive function, we will collect metrics on the subjects’ 
backgrounds, glycemic control (Ale and self-monitoring of blood glucose data), self- 
reported self-care [Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA)], and diabetes- 
related distress [Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) scale]. At various points throughout 
the study, we will repeat collection of Ale, self-monitoring of blood glucose data, 
SDSCA, and PAID, and we will measure subjects’ engagement by tracking the contacts 
that they initiate with their providers and their adherence to appointments. At the 
completion of data collection, we will analyze the data with t-tests, repeated measures 
ANOVA, and multinomial logistic regression models. 

The project has encountered numerous obstacles to completing this task and those 
dependent on it. As mentioned previously, the cessation of the TRUE Research 
Foundation and the loss of funds due to that were the first challenge. 

Subsequently, we transferred the funds to the Geneva Foundation and then wrote the 
protocol documents for submission at Womack at Fort Bragg in NC. Our contact there 
was Dr. Laura Bowers. We submitted a Revision to the Statement of Work at the end of 
that Period of Performance to conduct the study at Womack, and this was approved by 
TATRC. We attempted the full transfer, but experienced difficulty at the Womack end 
throughout the Period of Performance that we are currently reporting on. In brief, we 
learned after the revision was approved that Dr. Bowers could not serve as a PI on this 
project. We were told that the Department Chief would find a suitable replacement, but 
he has not. Thus, at the end of this Period of Performance, we requested that the Pilot 
Study be moved to WRNMMC. 

The project has been moved to WRNMMC, but now the Institute that was making this 
project possible has been greatly reduced. We are seeking alternatives, or will close the 
project and submit a final report. 


TASK 6. Initiate and, maintain Pilot Study, through Completion—NOT 
COMPLETE 

This Task is dependent on the preceding task. 


TASK 7. Prepare reports and manuscripts for presentation at national 
meetings regarding the technology and our findings from the Pilot Study ,—

KEY RESEARCH ACCOMPLISHMENTS 


• Finalization of the rubric for the PHR-A (e.g., modules for Healthy Eating, Being 
Active, Monitoring of Blood Glucose, etc.) 

• Document with functional requirements 

• Determination of how users will do manual data entry, as needed 

• Drafting and documentation of rules and algorithms for specific 
components/modules of the PHR-A 

• Drafting of code for the components of the PHR-A based on the written rules and 
algorithms, leading to a Version 1 

• Drafting of over 200 tips that pertain to each component of the PHR-A 

• Documentation of code establishing linkages between the PHR-A and a PHR - 
Microsoft HealthVault only 

• Solicitation of and receipt of feedback on the PHR-A from experts, namely people 
who care for people with diabetes and people who have diabetes 

• Revision of the PHR-A (feedback, surveys, tips, introduction to each section and 
task), leading to a Version 2 

• Transfer of funds from TRUE Research Foundation to the Geneva Foundation, with 
re-establishment of sub-contracts, etc. 

• Establishment of a final site for the Internet “presence” to host the PHR-A and a new 
name, called Tracking My Diabetes-- http://trackinqmvdiabetes .com 

• Revision to the design of the Pilot Study, to better fit the reduction in budget and 
time resulting from the cessation of operations at TRUE Research Foundation 

• Presentations about the PHR-A at national meetings 

• Further revision of the project - so that we could conduct the Pilot Study at Womack 

• HOWEVER, the Pilot Study will not be conducted at Womack after all, due to 
aforementioned challenges, and we will now complete the paperwork to do the study 
at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Dr. Susan Walker completed 90% 
of this paperwork.

CONCLUSION 


Reduction or prevention of diabetes-related complications requires blood glucose levels 
be kept as close as possible to the normal range. Daily self-care behaviors carried out 
by the person with diabetes are of central importance in attaining good blood glucose; 
however, many people struggle with appropriate or consistent self-care. Tools have 
evolved over the past decade to help with diabetes self-care, but they are either tied to 
a clinic or provider, do not make use of Personal Health Records (PHR) as a place for 
storing and accessing useful diabetes data (such as Microsoft HealthVault), lack 
decision support, or some combination of these things. A new tool for diabetes care that 
can be mobile, if desired, uses a PHR, is not tied to a clinic, and can provide decision 
support with actionable recommendations is needed. 

Thus, our objective is to develop a new tool for diabetes self-management, involving 
potential end-users in the process, and to conduct a Pilot Study of the efficacy of the 
new tool. The new tool is called Tracking My Diabetes (TMD). For the Pilot Study, our 
central hypothesis is that a PHR-A (TMD) that coordinates the major components of 
diabetes self-management, is mobile, provides decision support with actionable options, 
and is based on user input will enhance diabetes self-care, improve glycemic control, 
and lower psychological distress related to diabetes. 

Our specific aims in this project are to develop a new PHR-A for diabetes self¬ 
management, to obtain feedback of this product regarding its “look and feel”, and then 
to conduct a Pilot Study with people with diabetes that will test the following hypotheses: 
1) Glycemic control will be more improved among people with diabetes who receive the 
PHR-A compared with people with diabetes who receive “attention control”.; and 2) Self- 
reported diabetes self-care, engagement with care, and psychological distress related to 
diabetes will be more improved among people with diabetes who receive the PHR-A 
compared with people with diabetes who receive “attention control. 

The project had a late start due to errors in the contract and then experienced a 
cessation of operations from April to August 2011 when TRUE Research Foundation 
declared bankruptcy. However, we have completed ALL development and have written 
a revised research protocol for the proposed Pilot Study, which we had planned to 
conduct at Womack, after we submitted a revision of the Statement of Work (so we 
could conduct the study there). However, things did not go as planned at Womack, as 
the person who volunteered to be the PI could not actually fulfill this role. Thus, we 
requested to move the study to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. In the 
coming year, we plan to conduct the Pilot Study. If we are unable to initiate it within the 
first half of 2015, we will close the project and submit a final report.
