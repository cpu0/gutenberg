AutoHelp: Demonstration and Presentation 

Christine M. Mitchell and David A. Thurman 
Center for Human-Machine Systems Research 
School of Industrial & Systems Engineering 
Georgia Institute of Technology 

AutoHelp is a case-based, Web-accessible help desk for users of the EOSDIS. Its uses a combination of 
advanced computer and Web technologies, knowledge-based systems tools, and cognitive engineering to 
offload the current, person-intensive, help desk facilities at the DAACs. 

As a case-based system, AutoHelp starts with an organized database of previous help requests (questions 
and answers) indexed by a hierarchical category structure that facilitates recognition by persons seeking 
assistance. As an initial proof-of-concept demonstration, a month of email help requests to the Goddard 
DAAC were analyzed and partially organized into help request cases. These cases were then categorized to 
create a preliminary case indexing system, or category structure. This category structure allows potential 
users to identify or recognize categories of questions, responses, and sample cases similar to their needs. 

Year one of this research project focused on the development of a technology demonstration. User 
assistance ‘cases’ are stored in an Oracle database in a combination of tables linking prototypical questions 
with responses and detailed examples from the email help requests analyzed to date. When a potential user 
accesses the AutoHelp system, a Web server provides a Java applet that displays the category structure of 
the help case base organized by the needs of previous users. When the user identifies or requests a 
particular type of assistance, the applet uses Java database connectivity (JDBC) software to access the 
database and extract the relevant cases. 

The demonstration will include an on-line presentation of how AutoHelp is currently structured. We will 
show how a user might request assistance via the Web interface and how the AutoHelp case base provides 
assistance. 

The presentation will describe the DAAC data collection, case definition, and organization to date, as well 
as the AutoHelp architecture. It will conclude with the year 2 proposal to more fully develop the case base, 
the user interface (including the category structure), interface with the current DAAC Help System, the 
development of tools to add new cases, and user testing and evaluation at (perhaps) the Goddard DAAC.
