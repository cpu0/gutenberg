Space Visions Congress 


Seminar: Seminar: Java Programming Language 
When: Friday April 27, 2007 1:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. 

Where: University of Central Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC), 1519 
Clearlake Road, Cocoa, Florida 
Instructor: Ali Shaykhian 

Space Visions Congress is sponsored by the Canaveral Council of Technical Societies 
(CCTS). CCTS is a voluntary, not-for-profit association of engineering, technical, and scientific 
societies that support memberships who live and work along Florida's Space Coast. 

Java Programming Language: The Java seminar covers the fundamentals of Java 
programming language. No prior programming experience is required for participation in 
the seminar. The first part of the seminar covers introductory concepts in Java 
programming including data types (integer, character, ..), operators, functions and 
constants, casts, input, output, control flow, scope, conditional statements, and arrays. 
Furthermore, introduction to Object-Oriented programming in Java, relationships 
between classes, using packages, constructors, private data and methods, final instance 
fields, static fields and methods, and overloading are explained. 

The second part of the seminar covers extending classes, inheritance hierarchies, 
polymorphism, dynamic binding, abstract classes, protected access. The seminar 
conclude by introducing interfaces, properties of interfaces, interfaces and abstract 
classes, interfaces and callbacks, basics of event handling, user interface components 
with swing, applet basics, converting applications to applets, the applet HTML tags and 
attributes, exceptions and debugging. 

Specific expectations are: 

o Show how to create, compile and run Java applet and application 
o Read, recognize, and describe Java syntax 
o Recognize methods, decisions, loops and exceptions 
o Learn how to declare, define and use variables, final, arrays, and references 
o Show how to implement classes representing real objects 

o Learn to implement object-oriented designs, emphasize on encapsulation, inheritance 
and polymorphism 
o Group classes into a package 

o Understand inner classes and the concept of nameless object 
o Use Java Graphical User Interface components 
o Recognize events and event handling techniques
