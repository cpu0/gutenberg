Status of Effort: 

Our paper on Mixed Variable Pattern Search will appear in SIAM Jounial on 
Optimization. We are awaiting referee reports on our Filter Pattern Search 
paper and our Analysis of Generalized Pattern Searches paper. We have 
received reports conditionally accepting our paper with Michael Kokkolaras, 
a mechanical engineering research engineer at the University of Michigan on 
heatshield design. In mid-October, Doug Moore finished the newest release 
of our C++ code FOCUS. This release implements our filter pattern search 
method for general nonlinear programming without derivatives. 

We have active collaborations with the Distributed Computing Group 
at Sandia Livermore Labs, Boeing Phantom Works, ExxonMobil Upstream 
Research, and Charles Audet of the Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal. In 
addition to the new collaboration with CSRI, we will be visited in early 
December by representatives of the United Technology Research Center led 
by Mike Dorobantu to explore a collaboration on robust design and reduced 
subspace methods. We do our best to leverage your support. 

Boeing has used our approach to design wing planforms for a new large 
airplane and a new small airplane. 

Major Mark Abramson, USAF, has completed his comprehensive exams. 
He is preparing to defend his thesis proposal this winter. He will propose to 
extend our mixed continuous/categorical variable algorithm to handle general 
nonlinear constraints, implement those extensions in FOCUS, and use the 
code to solve a manufacturing process design problem from AFRL. Garth 
Frazier assures me that we will be able to get the problem even after he 

leaves AFRL. : 

We have been invited to collaborate with Bill Hart and Tony Guinta 
of the CSRI at Sandia Labs on an interesting mixed continuous/categorical 
variable problem to design the best pattern and charges for placing explo¬ 
sives to breach a concrete wall. This looks now to be an excellent example 
problem since it can be meaningfully extended to multiple objectives, ro¬ 
bust optimization, and to a mixture of continuous, discrete, and categorical 
variables. 

Thus, the status of the project is that it is flourishing. One upset to 
the status quo is that Doug Moore will leave at the end of this project to 
join a local dotcom. We plan to replace Doug for the proposal period with a 
software engineer. We are more than ever convinced that students should not 
be depended on for top quality software, but since Doug never participated

in the algorithmic research, we expect that his replacement should not be 
too difficult. Charles Audet has agreed to supervise this person, and he has 
identified an experienced software engineer who wishes to work in a university 
environment. If Doug had left last year, it would have been a serious blow, 
but now it is not so serious because the design of the framework has now 
stabilized (at least until we add categorical variables!). Our collaborators at 
Boeing have successfully interfaced two completely different ad hoc search 
routines to FOCUS, and they are happy with the results. Of course, we will 
stay within our budget in replacing Doug. Indeed, if we can replace him 
with someone at a lower salary, this will enable me to be supported at a 
more reasonable level. 


Accomplishments/New Findings: 

As we said above, the project is flourishing. We go into the renewal very 
pleased with what has been accomplished so far, and with some low hanging 
fruit to pick because of our progress this year. 

• We have made a theoretical breakthrough in the analysis of general¬ 
ized pattern search methods (GPS). In a 10-page paper submitted to 
SIAM Journal on Optimization , we obtain a proof of convergence of 
GPS for problems with general linear constraints without assuming 
even finite values for the objective. We identify sequences whose limit 
points satisfy appropriate optimality conditions depending on the local 
smoothness of the objective at the point. 

Thus, our result is much stronger mathematically and more practical 
because the functions we deal with in practice are not continuous or 
finite valued. Not only are our results stronger, but our proofs are 
much shorter. We use the Clarke generalized directional derivatives as 
a tool to reduce to a few lines results that took pages when published 
originally in SIAM Journal on Optimization. 

• We developed a novel class of pattern search algorithms for general 
constrained optimization. It does not compute nor approximate any 
derivatives, and it does not use any penalty nor Lagrangian function. 
There are no penalty constants because there is no merit function. 
Our interest in these methods was really intensified by the fact that no

ff ilb/ 38 


merit function means no explicit dependence on Lagrange multiplier 
estimates, which are a big problem for-derivative-free methods. 

In the original pattern search algorithms, a trial point is accepted if 
it reduces the incumbent objective value. Our constrained algorithm 
is based on the so-called filter methods of Fletcher, Leffler, and Toint. 
This is a new and very hot approach to globalizing SQP and SLP algo¬ 
rithms. A filter method accepts a trial point if it is unfiltered, i.e., if its 
objective function value and its constraint violation function value are 
not dominated in the multiobjective sense. Thus, for the unconstrained 
case, this reduces exactly to the previous test. Again, we are able to 
use Clarke’s nonsmooth tools to achieve convergence without assuming 
continuity or finite values. We show that our algorithm generates an 
accumulation point satisfying first-order optimality conditions appro¬ 
priate to the local smoothness of the objective and constraints at the 
limit point. 

• Using the above filter pattern search approach, Paul Frank obtained 
very strong new designs of the wing planform for a new large airplane 
and a small airplane. The mission range constraint in the planform 
problem is nasty and nonlinear, so this was an excellent example to 
exercise our ideas. My understanding is that this will be the Boeing 
approach to planform design in the future. Now that is a TRANSITION. 

• In mid-October, Doug Moore finished the newest release of our C++ 
code FOCUS. This release implements pur filter pattern search method 
for general nonlinear programming without derivatives. It is based on a 
FOCUS redesign accomplished last summer during John Dennis’ visit 
to Boeing. Boeing has successfully married the new FOCUS with two 
local, and quite dissimilar, Boeing favorite search routines, and they 
seem quite happy with the functionality of the software. The software 
is freely available for downloading at: 

<http: //www. caam. rice. edu/dougm/~f ocus. html>. 

• Many engineering optimization problems involve a special kind of dis¬ 
crete variable that can be represented by a number, but this represen¬ 
tation has no significance. Such variables arise when a decision involves 
some situation like a choice from an unordered list of categories. This 
has two implications: The standard approach of solving problems with

continuous relaxations of discrete variables is not available, and the 
notion of local optimality must be defined through a user-specified set 
of neighboring points. 

We have a paper appearing in SIAM Journal on Optimization that 
defines a new class of direct search algorithms to provide limit points 
that satisfy some appropriate necessary conditions for local optimality 
for such problems. We give a more expensive, version of the algorithm 
that guarantees additional necessary optimality conditions. A small 
example illustrates the differences between the two versions. 

• A real thermal insulation system design problem illustrates the efficacy 
of the user controls for this class of algorithms. The joint paper with 
Kokkolaras mentioned above as provisionally accepted in the new Jour¬ 
nal for Optimization in Engineering applies our discrete/continuous 
direct search method MVP to obtain a greatly improved heatshield de¬ 
sign. There are many engineering problems of this type, which until 
our MVP work had to be treated through parametric studies. We ob¬ 
tained a 65 % reduction in energy use over the best published results 
obtained by parametric studies.

Projects in the Exploratory Stage 

• Oilfield Management 

Jn the last year, we continued to meet with representatives of the new 
ExxonMobil Upstream Co., and we helped them formulate a pro>lem 
of interest to them and well-suited to the optimization techniques we 
are developing. This particular problem concerns the placement and 
management of wells in an oilfield over a 20-year period. The problem 
has both continuous parameters, like the placement of wells and the 
rates of production, and discrete ones, like the startup and shut own 
dates for a given well. The problem lias constraints involving douu< s 
on production rates and interwell distances, and it incorporates both 
geophysical models and capital costs. We expect to continue to develop 
the problem and the tools to solve it over the next year. There are no 
continuous relaxations of the discrete parameters, and the constraints 
are general and Involve both sorts of variables. This and the planfotm 
problem will bo good test cases for algorithms that minimize a 

t Nozzle Design 

Our group is working with a group in Boeing Commercial Airplane 
Group (BCAG) to reduce the cycle time for designing nozzles. A nozzle 
i» the inside part of the engine housing, and its design is affected by the 
design of the more “upstream” components. This means that many o 
the design changes involving other airplane components force a. redesign 
of the nozzle as well. 

A nozzle design is specified by 100 parameters, 90 of which are fixed by 
other considerations. The system is governed by a 2D Navier Stokes 
coupled with NASTRAN, a commercial structures code. It takes about 
3 hours on an SGI Challenge to get one function value. The current

3 hours on an SGI Challenge to get one function value. The current 
length of a design cycle is two weeks. We expect to reduce that to 
approximately one day. 

Contact: Greg Shubin (425) 865-3516. 

• High-Speed Cutting Tool Design 

High-speed machine tools encounter the metal at over 300 mph. At 
that speed, the metals are not fully solid. This allows more complicated 
parts to be machined in a single piece. Many large airplane parts are 
currently assembled from components that were machined separately. 

If, during airplane assembly, one of these parts doesn’t quite fit, work 
stops and a supervisor is called in to approve the use of shims to make 
it fit. The Boeing plant in Wichita found a significant reduction in the 
need for this “shimming” when large parts were machined as a single 
piece using a high-speed machine tool. 

Since this is a new technique, no one yet knows how to design a really 
good cutting tool. This is a three-variable, very expensive multiobjec¬ 
tive problem.

Ongoing Projects 

• Model Management Framework Software 

Boeing and Sandia were supplied with the C++ reimplementation, FOCUS, 
last spring. This implementation replaces the C++ box constrained 
prototype delivered previously. The framework can be used to develop 
model management algorithms specialized for a user’s applications and 
capabilities. 

Contact: Greg Shubin (425) 865-3516. 

• Planform Design 

Our group worked with another BCAG group that does planform de¬ 
sign. We achieved better planforms with greatly reduced cycle time. 
The planform is the shape of the wing as viewed from above. It is 
a tricky design problem that involves a couple of dozen variables and 
some interesting constraints. For example, the fuel is outboard on the

wings, and the wings must be swept back for performance. One con- 
straint is that the plane must not fall over backwards when the tanks 
are filled while the plane is on the ground. This problem involves mul¬ 
tiple objectives and discrete variables, but the first test problem run by 
Boeing used cost/passenger mile as objective and assumed values for 
the discrete variables, like where the wings are placed on the body. 

The following text on the recent test was approved by Boeing for release: 

Recent Product Development activities at Boeing have underscored the 
need to decrease the time to market and cost of products. To accom¬ 
plish this, Boeing has been examining all of its processes in development 
and production. 

One process in particular that occurs early in the design is the determi¬ 
nation of a wing planform, which must be chosen to meet mission while 
decreasing operating economics and respecting design constraints. Boe¬ 
ing is exploring whether this highly multi-disciplinary problem yields 
itself to integrated analysis and optimization techniques, with the hope 
of decreasing the cycle time of finding a preferred result by an order of 
magnitude. 

This exploration provided the Design Explorer Team, of which Rice is 
a member, with an opportunity to apply our design optimization tools. 
It has also been useful from the standpoint of exercising the various 
discipline analysis tools. Starting from baselines developed through 
the standard process and using a significant subset of the tools, we 
have been able to demonstrate actual integration of the analyses from 
the different disciplines and the speed advantages that we were looking 
for. The solutions found do, within the level of accuracy of the included 
tools, meet all constraints while showing economic benefit relative to 
our analyses of the initial baselines. 

The approach to this problem used response surface (surrogate) mod¬ 
eling to speed up the optimization, as opposed to continuously re¬ 
sampling the analysis tools. Of additional note is that incorporation of 
Model Management Framework elements into the optimization scheme 
allowed resolution of the selected optimum to search variables of sec¬ 
ond order importance. Such resolution is particularly difficult to obtain 
when using response surface modeling.

• Helicopter Rotor Blade Design 

This is the problem we have been working on for the longest time. 
Wake simulation is the hard part of the problem, and the effects at 
the tip of the rotor blade are the most difficult to simulate. It takes 
about 4 hours on 16 fat nodes of an SP2. Our group at Boeing man¬ 
aged to build a response surface model for the spline coefficients of the 
output of the full potential rotor discipline as a function of the spline 
coefficients of the input to that code, which is the output from the 
coupled simulation involving thermal analysis, structural analysis, and 
aerodynamics analysis. This new model reduces the cost to minutes 
and the bandwidth of the coupling from 100s to 10s. About a year ago, 
we provided Boeing with the design variables corresponding to.a new 
“best” design.
