V. Pascal Today 



Pascal is still used today, both as a powerful educational tool for programming, as 
well as a viable language for industrial, commercial, scientific, shareware and 
freeware applications. The Pascal language is available on a number of different 
platforms, both commercially and through open source. 

Platforms 

Pascal is available for: 

• OpenVMS VAX 

• OpenVMS Alpha 

• Tru64 Unix 

• Windows 95/98/ME 

• Windows NT 

• Linux 

• FreeBSD Unix 

• OS/2 

• Macintosh 

See Table V in the Compilers section for a list of available compilers. 
Compilers 

Commercial versions of Pascal include Borland Pascal (aka, Turbo Pascal), Delphi, 
Compaq Pascal, THINK Pascal, and CodeWarrior Pascal. Turbo Pascal and THINK 
Pascal have not been updated for quite some time; likewise, CodeWarrior Pascal's 
final update is in progress at the time of this writing. Delphi and Compaq Pascal are 
both still commercially viable products, with yearly updates and full vendor support. 
Finally, FreePascal and GNU Pascal are ongoing open source projects, providing 
versions of Pascal freely available to the public. 

Table V below provides a list of the more popular Pascal compilers available. In the 
"Supports" column, each compiler is rated for how well it adheres to the unextended 
Pascal standard (PAS) and the Extended Pascal standard (EPAS), and whether it

supports the Object Pascal model (OP). For each standard, the compiler is also rated 
to what extent it supports that standard: Full, Nearly Full, or Partial. In addition to 
the Object Pascal as defined in the Object Pascal Technical Report, Borland designed 
a variation of Object Pascal. Compilers which adhere to Borland's Object Pascal 
model are designated as such.

** Borland's Delphi is a Rapid Application Development (RAD) Environment. It is 
based upon Pascal, but uses menus and windows for application building, hiding the 
code for the most part.
