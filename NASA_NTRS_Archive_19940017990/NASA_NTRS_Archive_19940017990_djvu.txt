Abstract 


The AIPS system that has served the needs of the radio astronomical 
community remarkably well during the last 15 years is showing signs of age 
and is being replaced by a more modern system, AIPS++. As the name 
implies, AIPS++ will be developed in an object oriented fashion and will 
use C++ as its main programming language. The work is being done by a 
consortium of seven organizations, with coordinated activities worldwide. 

After a review of the history of the project to this date from management, 
astronomical and technical viewpoints, and the current state of the 
project, the paper concentrates on the tradeoffs implied by the choice of 
implementation style and the lessons we have learned, good and bad.
