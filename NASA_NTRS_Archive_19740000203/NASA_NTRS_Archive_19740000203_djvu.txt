Computer Program for Buckling Loads of Orthotropic Laminated Stiffened 
Panels Subjected to Biaxial In-plane Loads (BUCLASP 2) 


The problem: 

In the analysis of laminated and stiffened, flat and 
curved panels, detail design is important, and dependable 
estimates of the buckling loads are needed. 


theory with prebuckling stresses and deformations 
ignored. Prior to buckling, the panel is subject to 
uniform strains so that each element has a constant 
(but not necessarily the same) biaxial loading. 


The solution: 

A general-purpose computer program has been de- 
signed to perform exact instability analyses for structures 
such as unidirectionally-stiffened, rectangular composite 
panels. 


How itâ€™s done: 

The structure is idealized as an assemblage of beam 
elements, laminated curved-plate elements, and lami- 
nated flat-plate elements. Each element extends the full 
length of the structure. The element edges that are 
normal to the longitudinal axis of the panel are assumed 
to be simply supported, and any external edge that is 
parallel to the longitudinal axis may be arbitrarily 
constrained by specifying the appropriate spring con- 
stants. The analysis is exact, based on linear elastic
