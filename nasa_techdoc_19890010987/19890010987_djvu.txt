Introduction 



The performance of a compact range is dependent upon a variety of factors. 
However, once they have been optimized, the facility must be validated. 
One approach is to measure objects whose scattered fields are accurately 
known, such as perfectly conducting spheres and disks. These canoncial 
structures have scattered field solutions based upon eigenfunction solutions 
but the sphere is more often used since its solution is easier to calculate 
and, more importantly, its scattered field is more sensitive to illumination 
from other angles. It is this sensitivity which important since the compact 
range ideally generates plane wave illumination in the test zone. 

The sphere is a good standard reference target but it does not provide a 
large dynamic range in its scattered field since it is dominated by a reflected 
field. Another standard target [1] is an ogive which provides excellent dy- 
namic range but it has been inconvenient to use since its exact solution can 
not be generated by an eigenfunction solution. The most direct approach to 
calculate its exact scattered field is through a method of moments solution. 
This has been done for two different ogives. This report briefly describes 
the dominant scattering mechanisms for the ogive and presents calculated 
backscattered patterns which are compared with measured results for two 
>gives. 



Chapter 2 

Scattering Mechanisms 



The high frequency representation of backscattered fields can be divided 
into three regions [2] which are shown in Figure 2.1. The angular sector 
between 0° and 90° is divided into these regions based upon the visibiUty 
of the rear tip and the presence of a specular field. Region I is between 
0° and a where a is the half tip angle of the ogive. Region II is between 
a and 90" — a. Region III is between 90° — a and 90°. Region I has 
scattering due to direct front tip illumination, creeping wave illumination 
of the rear tip and tip to tip interactions involving various creeping wave 
paths. Region II has scattering due to direct front and rear tip illumination 
and tip to tip interaction through creeping waves. Regions II and III have 
similar scattering mechanisms but with the presence of a dominant specular 
scattering mechanism in Region III. 

The backscattered field from an ogive can be decomposed into two po- 
larization planes; i.e. the E- and H-planes. The incidence plane is formed 
by the incident ray and the two tips of the ogive. The E- and H-plniie 
patterns have the electric field vector parallel and normal to the incidence 
plane, respectively. The patterns for both planes are similar in Region III 
due to the polarization independence of the specular field. The major dif- 
ference occurs due to the boundary condition of the electric field that has 
to be satisfied in Region I for the two polarization planes. The E-plane 



scattered field supports a significant creeping wave (normal electric field to 

the surface) in Region I which scatters back due to the rear tip. To provide 

a continuous field value in Region II, the rear tip has to scatter strongly as 

lecomes directly illuminated. The H-plane scattered field from the reat 

does not require a large value as it becomes directly illuminated since 

re is not a significant creeping wave (parallel electric field to the surface) 

minating the rear tip in Region I.

Calculations 



The E- and H-plane RCS patterns for two perfectly conducting ogives were 
calculated using a body of revolution moment method code [3]. The calcula- 
tions were performed on a Cray computer [4] to facilitate the computations. 
The computation involved the solution of many unkowns due to the large 
electrical size of the ogives. The sampling length of each segment was no 
greater than one tenth of a wavelength long. The dimensions for the ogives, 
identified as A and B, are in Table 3.1. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 illustrate the E- 
and H-plane RCS patterns for the 9.546" long ogive at 10 GHz, respectively. 
Figures 3.3 and 3.4 illustrate the E- and H-plane RCS patterns for the 36" 
long ogive at 4 GHz, respectively. Figures 3.5 and 3.6 illustrate the E- and 
H-plane RCS patterns for the 36" long ogive at 10 GHz, respectively. All 
cross section values are calibrated in dBsm.

Measurements 



RCS pattern measurements were performed at the ElectroScience Labo- 
ratory compact range for both the 36" and 9.546" long ogives. The 36" 
long ogive was provided by NASA Langley Research Center and was con- 
structed from a silver painted, fiberglas covered foam ogive with metal tips. 
The 9.546" long ogive was constructed from a piece of solid aluminum. 
Each measurement consisted of a vector background subtraction, where 
the measured returns with and without a target present in the range are 
subtracted. The ogives were positioned on a 2.75" diameter styrofoam col- 
umn which connected to a treated low cross section metal ogival pedestal. 
The following figures illustrate the measured response as a solid Une and the 
calculated one by a dashed line with all values calibrated in dBsm. Figure 
4.1 illustrates the E-plane pattern comparison for the 9.546" long ogive. 
Figures 4.2 and 4.3 illustrate the E-plane pattern comparison for the 36" 
long ogive at 4 and 10 GHz, respectively. Figures 4.4 and 4.5 illustrate the 
H-plane pattern comparison for the 36" long ogive at 4 and 10 GHz, respec- 
tively. As can be seen, the E-plane patterns generally haA-e good agreement 
between calculated and measured responses. However, the H-plane pattern 
comparisons do not agree as well in the low level regions due to the mount 
contamination arid model imperfections. This is confirmed with swept fre- 
quency measurements that have been transformed into the time domain to 



12 



obtain down range scattering center mechanism identification. Figure 4.6 
is an illustration of such a time domain signature for a 36" long ogive at 
axial incidence. Note the presence of error terms which are significant at 
low RCS levels.

Conclusions 



The measured H-plane scattered field pattern of an ogive is an excellent 
test of a compact range due to its large dynamic range. It has a very broad 
low level response (approximately -60dBsm) as well as a high level specular 
return. The ability to obtain patterns of the quality shown here is not 
only dependent upon the reflector system and instrumentation radar but 
also on target mounting techniques and target fabrication ability which are 
important aspects that are sometimes overlooked.
