14. ABSTRACT 

ORA is a network analysis tool that detects risks or vulnerabilities of an organizations design structure. 
The design structure of an organization is the relationship among its personnel, knowledge, resources, and 
tasks entities. These entities and relationships are represented by the Meta-Matrix. Measures that take as 
input a Meta-Matrix are used to analyze the structural properties of an organization for potential risk. 
ORA contains over 100 measures which are categorized by which type of risk they detect. Measures are 
also organized by input requirements and by output. ORA generates formatted reports viewable on screen 
or in log files, and reads and writes networks in multiple data formats to be interoperable with existing 
network analysis packages. In addition, it has tools for graphically visualizing Meta-Matrix data and for 
optimizing a network?s design structure. ORA uses a Java interface for ease of use, and a C++ 
computational backend. The current version ORA 1.2 software is available on the CAS OS website:

Abstract 


ORA is a network analysis tool that detects risks or vulnerabilities of an organization’s design structure. 
The design structure of an organization is the relationship among its personnel, knowledge, resources, and 
tasks entities. These entities and relationships are represented by the Meta-Matrix. Measures that take as 
input a Meta-Matrix are used to analyze the structural properties of an organization for potential risk. 

ORA contains over 100 measures which are categorized by which type of risk they detect. Measures are 
also organized by input requirements and by output. ORA generates formatted reports viewable on screen 
or in log files, and reads and writes networks in multiple data formats to be interoperable with existing 
network analysis packages. In addition, it has tools for graphically visualizing Meta-Matrix data and for 
optimizing a network’s design structure. ORA uses a Java interface for ease of use, and a C++ 
computational backend. The current version ORA1.2 software is available on the CASOS website:

The Main Menu runs across the top of the window, and the rest of the screen is 
divided into three panels. 

Below the menu is the Toolbar. ORA starts with buttons to add and remove Meta- 
Networks, NodeClasses and Networks. Using the inverted triangle you can add or 
delete buttons from this strip. 

The Meta-Network Pane displays a list of the Meta-Networks that has been 
loaded into ORA, its components and sub-networks. To view information about a 
particular meta-network or sub-network, single-click on it. 

The Editor Pane displays information about the meta-network or sub-network 
highlighted in Panel 1. 

The Report Pane displays information about the results of analyses run on your 
meta-network. 

Loading a meta-network into ORA 

You have three options for opening your meta-network in ORA: 

• From the main menu select File => Open Meta-Network. A small window 
titled Help: Opening meta-network pops up. Your data should already be 
in the correct format, so click [OK], 


2 















• Next, a file chooser titled Open pops up. Browse to the location of your 
dataset, single-click on it, and click the Open button in the bottom right 
corner. 

• Click the first icon in the row directly below the menu bar. It looks like a 
half-open file folder. A window titled Import Data into ORA will pop up. 
Click the Select Files button. A file chooser titled Open pops up. Browse to 
the location of your dataset, single-click on it, and click the Open button in 
the bottom right corner. You will be returned to the Import Data into ORA 
window. Click the Finish button in the bottom right corner. 

• In panel 2, click the Load button on the far right. A window titled Import 
Data into ORA pops up. Click the Select Files button. A file chooser titled 
Open pops up. Browse to the location of your dataset, single-click on it, and 
click the Open button in the bottom right corner. You will be returned to the 
Import Data into ORA window. Click the Finish button in the bottom right 
corner. 

A list of your meta-network and sub-categories in Panel 1, as well as the location 
and basic statistics of your meta-network in Panel 2 will appear. ORA is ready to 
begin analyzing the meta-network. 

The Visualizer 

To visualize a meta-network, first make sure the meta-network you wish to 
visualize is highlighted in Panel 1. If it is not highlighted, single-click on it. 

In Panel 2, click the Visualize this Meta-Network button. A new window will pop up 
displaying your meta-network graphically. A small legend also appears. 

Below is a screen capture showing the visualization of the agent x event graph 
from the Stargate Summit Meta-Network.

The visualization displays the connections between all items in the Stargate 
Summit Meta-Network. The red circles represent the agents, the green circles 
represent individual events in the scenario, and the lines represent the connections 
between the agents and the events. 

You'll notice there are agents with no connections to any events. They represent 
nodes that were connected to the scenario but not to the particular events of the 
Summit timeline. 



Creating a New Meta-Network 


These lessons will give you the information in order to create a Meta-Network 
from data you have on-hand. 

Lesson -101 

This section describes the process of looking over your data and deciding what is 
relevant for inclusion into a Meta-Network. It takes the examples I used for the 
Stargate dataset.

Lessons dealing with importing data from other programs. 



When you first open up ORA you need to construct a Meta-Network. But the 
question is, how do you go about this task? 

First, you need to understand what constitutes a Meta-network. The basic building 
blocks of all Meta-Networks is a . Similar nodes are combined to build 

. Node Sets are combined to make . Multiple networks are combined 

to create a 

It is up to you on HOW to construct the individual Node Sets and Networks and 
how to combine the Networks into a Meta-network. This means you need to gather 
as much information regarding the scenario as possible (who, what, when, 
where, and how) 

Knowing as much about the scenario as possible is important. Information about 
the people involved, where these people were seen, what items they had available 
and used, what they knew, what tasks they performed, what resources are needed 
to perform those tasks, etc. The more relevant information you collect the better 
your final Meta-network, will be. 

For the purpose of creating the Stargate Meta-network, the two-episode story 
arc (Summit / Last Stand) was chosen as the basis for all the nodes, node sets, 
and networks. But even though the information was clearly on the tv screen, many 
intuitive decisions had to be made. 

For the Julius Caesar Meta-network, both the play and spark notes were used as 
reference. As with the Stargate Meta-network, many decisions were made about 
how to create data sets and what connections would be required. 

I found that for the help file using a set of data where you know all the answers 
helps. But that won't always be the case. If you already know what the results are 
supposed to be then it's easy to build a correct Meta-Network. 


5 










But the most important part of this is it helps you to learn what to look for. You'll 
initially make mistakes but if you instantly jump into creation mode then, well, 
since you're not sure how to build this in the first place then how can you be sure 
your Meta-Networks are built correctly in the first place? 

Initially the Stargate Meta-network, was built with both the allies and the bad 
Guys. This appeared to be the best way and it looked good displayed in the 
visualizer. But it was discovered that having the bad Guys interfered with getting 
proper information from the reports. It wasn't until after the bad guys were 
removed that reports began to make more sense. What looks good in the 
beginning ISN'T necessarily your best option. 

What's in a Node Class 

There are six major classes: Agents, Location, Events, Tasks, Knowledge, and 
Resources.. Nearly everything will fall into one of these six class. ORA contains the 
ability to create new Node Classes but in most cases that's entirely unnecessary 
because most of ORA measures are designed to work with most common six 
classes mentioned above. 

With Stargate the agents were easy. The Stargate personnel, the Tok'ra, and some 
assorted others. The locations also were easy using scenes form the show. It was 
the events, knowledge, resources, and tasks which became slightly more difficult to 
discern. There were multiple false starts (missing some events, unnecessary 
locations, misplaced knowledge/resources) before I came to a proper conclusion. 
Initially I created extra Node sets (like faction & groups). This did nothing but 
clutter up the Meta-network, and make finding information much harder. 

The Julius Caesar Agent NodeSet was also easy using the cast of characters but 
it too had it's construction problems. Julius Caesar had limited resources so 
knowledge and resources were essentially combined into one NodeSet called 

knowledge. 

Node sets can be either binary (0 or 1) or numbered (negative #, 0 or 
positive #). A Meta-network, can contain a combination of the two. 

When building Node Classes and Networks (and then onward to Meta-networks) 
you'll discover that many networks are are very apparent while others were almost 
invisible. You'll have some large networks while others may be extremely small. But 
all networks are necessary to produce the complete Meta-network. 

And the depth of the Node Classes can be extended by affixing to them. 


6 


Stargate uses attributes to give extra information such as an agent's gender or 
time of death or the order in which events happened 

Use the Julius Caesar attributes allegiance and persuasion as a control 
mechanism to show the strength which various agents use these attributes. 

Agents (Who) 

It's usually best to start out by constructing the Agent NodeSet. This helps reveal 
many facets of the rest of the Meta-network. Gather all possible information about 
the Whos involved. Agents are the persons involved Stargates' daniel_jackson & 
jacob_carter_selmac and over at Julius Caesar Brutus and 1st Commoner. 

The Stargate NodeSet contains a mere 16 agents. Originally I plotted both the 
allies and bad guys but found there was too much clutter and unnecessary nodes. 
Removing the bad guys helped streamline the NodeSet. 

The Julius Caesar NodeSet came in with more than twice as many. Unlike the 
Stargate NodeSet all of the characters were necessary. Everybody was plotting 
against everybody else. 

After you've collected all the agents involved you can proceed to creating your first 
network. Figure out which agents had any contact the situation and place a "1" in 
the corresponding cell. Depending on the particular circumstances you will have to 
establish criteria for an association. An Agent x Agent network creates a Square 
Network meaning the names in the rows are identical to the columns. 

The Stargate (and Julius Caesar) Meta-networks were fairly easy to construct 
agent Node sets and agent by agent Networks. Real life data doesn't always come 
with such an easy to see diagram. After a Meta-network, is constructed it very 
likely that new information will surface which will change the face of the current 
Meta-network, and, thusly, the results of any reports. 

There are three modes of thought in creating connections. 1) The most common 
would be to say if one agent knows another agent then place a 1 in the cell. 2 ) 

Next would be to use the preceding criteria but to weight the ties where one person 
could have a higher regard for a person more than there are reciprocal feelings. 

3) The third would be to use a hierarchical style showing who reports to who in a 
organizational tree situation. It's important that the person creating the Meta¬ 
network. makes a call whether there is and and how strong a tie will be. 

>AII three of these steps (unfortunately) were gone through in the creation of the 
Stargate Meta-network. Initially, using only binary data, the logic of the data set 
was very fuzzy as to the exact nature of many of the connections Many of the 
allies knew many of the bad guys on a first name basis. Next weighted ties were 
tried with higher numbers for stronger connections but the results that should have 
been - just weren't. It wasn't until a hierarchical style showing who reported to who 
was used did the results begin to ring true. 


7 


The Julius Caesar Meta-network, didn't have the same problems. It was 
apparent from the start that a weighted person-by-person network was the key. 

As you learn more about Meta-networks it becomes easier to see which mode you 
need to use. 

You might not create a Meta-network, correctly the first time (or the second or 
the third time) if you rush into it. Best to take a little time and review the 
information before heading straight into the creation process. Sometimes too 
much information will find it's way into your Meta-network. 

On the first run for the Stargate Meta-network, both the allies and the bad guys 
were placed in the network figuring both were needed for proper interaction. And it 
worked find until the reports had some bad guys popping up where they actually 
interfered with the results. So those nodes were removed and run the reports a 
second (or third time). This become a waste of time and effort. This solution was to 
create the data set with only the allies. This then gave more reliable 
information in the reports. 

A little time spent on reviewing the data and any reports will great improve you 
chances of getting it somewhat right in the first place. It will also help in your 
deciding the best way to build your Networks. 

Originally, when both allies and bad guys were used, weighted ties were used to 
describe the connections between various nodes. Each connection between the 
nodes on the same side were individually weighted depending on how they felt 
toward that other node and weights between opposing sides were always less than 


Originally the Network was done with binary ties but was changed to weighted ties. 

Remember, you'll always find something that you think needs tweaked as more 
and more information is uncovered. 

Locations (Where) 

Next create a NodeSet of all the locations involved in the scenario. Locations are 
places like Stargate's earth or revanna or Julius Caesar's battlefield or senate. 


For the Stargate Meta-network, it was a simple matter of following the episode 
and marking down who was in what scene. Not quite a simple when you've got less 
than perfect data. 

Ditto for Julius Caesar If a character was in a scene location then a "1" was 
placed in that character's matrix cell showing he was there. 

Create a list of all possible locations and use your best guess as to whether that 
location is important. Remember, just because people are seen in a location doesn't 
mean it's important to the Meta-network. You may have a location you think is 
important initially but come to find that nothing happened of interest there (or visa 
versa). 

For the Stargate Meta-network, it was difficult to focus in on the exact locations 
necessary. The first time only the major locations were used, but it was difficult 
defining specific tasks. Then all locations were added but it ended up have many 
isolates and pendants that became unnecessary. 

For the Julius Caesar Meta-network, there was the scene on the battlefield and 
various sub-scenes in individual battle-tents. It was decided to combine all the 
battle-tent scenes together. Individual tasks would be used to sort out the Meta¬ 
network. 

Events (When) 

Creating an Events Node sets is a little more difficult than for either agents or 
locations. Agents and locations are tangible items whereas events are intangible. 
They also depend on the interpretation of the individual creating the NodeSet. 
Events can include items like Stargate's summit_meeting and gate_attack or 
Julius Caesar's Brutus speaks to citizens and Funeral of Julius Caesar. 

Many of the events in Summit scenario were easy (the meetings, the summit, the 
attack). But others were a little harder to discern. Initially there were a mere eight 
events. But shortly after it was found to be inadequate. After a quick re-adjustment 
he number of events doubled. 

When plotting events it is sometimes necessary to show what order they occurred. 
What happened first, second, third, and so on. This helps discern which agents are 
needed in which parts of the scenario. 

In the Stargate Meta-network, the event sequence shows the beginning event 
was the tollana_attack. This led to the sgc_meeting and onto the 
revanna_meeting. There the sequence split into two branches eventually both 
converging in on gate_attack. 

To create an ordered event x event network start with the row of earliest event. 
Place a checkmark in the column for the next event. Find the row for the column 
you just check marked. Follow that to the column with the next event. Proceed in 


9 


this manner till you have all your events. You may, as happened in the Stargate 
Network, that two events sprout from a single event. They may, or may not. 
converge back to an ending. 

Tasks (How) 

Tasks are things that are done by the agents such as Stargate's replace_jarren 
and poison_summit and Julius Caesar's Kill Caesar and Attend Senate. 

A task network can be set up to show the order that tasks need to be done in order 
for the scenario to be played out. For example, procuring materials to build 
something is always necessary before building something but not necessarily before 
planning. This is usually done with a directed graph (i.e. a link from procuring to 
building but not the other way around). 

As in the example of Events above certain tasks need to be completed before 
others can be started. Stargate uses a binary, directed network showing a 
pathway of which tasks are required to be completed before the next task can be 
started. create_poison, infiltrate_yuWorld, and create_memory_drug all 
needed done before present_pian_to_sgc. But none of this could have taken 
place without get_reole_chemical leading to the create_memory_drug. 

Tasks are exclusively attached to agents. You can't have a location, event, etc. 
performing a task. But this is not to say that you can't have a task attached to a 
location as it might necessarily need to be done at a certain location. 

daniei_jackson could only perform the task poison_summit at the location 

hasaraSystem_spaceStation as that's where the event summit_meeting took 
place. He could not have done poison_summit on revanna or yu_homeworld. 

Knowledge (What) 

Many times more than one person knows the same thing. And other times there is 
a single person who has some vital knowledge. This is a way to help find out if one 
person is completely indispensable or whether there are other pathways to 
accomplishing the goal. 


10 


In the Stargate Meta-network, there are some knowledge which many agents 
have. But there are also some knowledge that only one person has. And if that 
person is taken out of the picture then the plan fails to materialize. 

Another situation is two people both having knowledge but it's much more 
important to one than the other. Both daniel_jackson and jacob_carter_selmak 

use spying but it's clear that jacob_carter_selmak is better at it than 

daniel_jackson. 

Resources (What) 

Resources can be very similar to knowledge and many times these two overlap. 
It's not necessary to always have both. 

The Stargate Meta-network, is was very necessary to separate the two as 
sometimes it was necessary to have knowledge regarding a resource before you 
could actually use that resource. Before Daniel could use the symbiote poison or 
the memory-altering drug he was required to have the knowledge of how the 
devices operated. 

In the Julius Caesar Meta-network, there was no real reason to separate 
knowledge and resources. The resource NodeSet was simply not used for this 
data set as it would have been redundant. There is no such constraint on learning 
how a dagger worked in Julius Caesar. 

Most of the Measures that can be run on knowledge have a corresponding 
measure that runs on resources. So some Meta-Network can eliminate one or the 
other. 

Networks 

After creating all your Node sets you then move on to creating Networks. Every 
Meta-network, will require a slightly different set of Node sets and Networks. 
Below are the Stargate and the Julius Caesar Node sets The Node sets in 
bold/italic are not contained in the other Meta-network. 

The Stargate NodeSet consisted of: agent x agent, agent x event, agent x 
knowledge, agent x location, agent x resource, agent, x tasks, event x event, 
event x resource, knowledge x tasks, tasks x event, tasks x tasks 

The Julius Caesar NodeSet consisted of: agent x agent, agent x event, agent x 
knowledge, agent x location, agent x tasks, event x event, knowledge x tasks, 
location x location, task x event, task x task. 

Notice that the two are almost identical but Stargate contains Networks for the 
Resource Node sets The Julius Caesar used a location x location network. 


11 


Difference between the two Meta-networks 


The big difference was the construction of the agent x agent network. Julius 
Caesar was a weighted matrix with connections to everyone an agent knew. The 
Stargate agent x agent network used a hierarchical method showing who reported 
to who. 

Another difference was the lack of a resource nodeset in Julius Caesar. There was 
no need as all that was placed under knowledge. Stargate, on the other-hand 
required separate knowledge and resources as it was sometimes necessary to have 
a certain knowledge before using a certain resource. 

The two data sets are very similar, most of the major Node sets are contained in 
both. But the circumstances for each are unique which requires a slightly different 
set of Node sets 



Excel and CSV 


You learned from Meta-Network 101 about how to survey your data, the different 
forms it can take, and how to make it a fit for ORA. In this lesson we'll go through 
the procedure of creating a Meta-Network using the Stargate data set in some 
practical examples. 

Your first Node Set 

Your first Node set will more than likely be an Agent Node set since all other node 
sets are either referred to/or by the agent node set Review you data and make a 
list of the people involved. 

After watching the Summit/Last Stand episodes (a couple times) and reading 
various reviews on the storyline I came up with 16 agent nodes. My first thought 
was to only use the people involved in the assassination plot (The SGC and the 
Tok'ra) but found that two of the Gou'ald had vital interactions with the the team 
members. 

What program should be used to create the information? 

You need a program that can create .csv files that your system can read. 

Microsoft Excel is an excellent choice as it has good copy/paste features, 
multiple spreadsheets in one files, and known compatibility with ORA. 

The examples in the rest of this lesson will be using Excel in OSX. 

The agent Node set was created with IDs A01, A02, A03,... A16 and the names of 
the agents were put in a column called agent. The order of the agents does not 


12 










matter as long as you keep the relationship between IDs and agents consistent 
throughout your work. The IDs are what allows ORA to match various files. 


Column A contains my IDs A01, A02,... A16 and column B contains the names of 
all the agents in my Agent Node set 


NOTE: I use AOl instead of A1 preferring to prefix the zero to the numbers less 
than ten. This assists when doing a sort within the editor. If you think that you will 
have a Node set with more than 100 nodes then use A001, A002, ...

Your first Network 


Now that the agent Node set is done the next item is to create an agent x agent 
Network. As described in Meta-Network 101 just how your agents interact with 
one another is subjective to the type of Network you have. 

Insert a new spreadsheet in Excel and place the agent IDs running down in column 
A starting with row 2 and the same set of agent IDS in row 1 starting with column

The Stargate example was done with a hierarchical method showing the chain of 
command. Nodes A02, A03, & A04 represent maj_samantha_carter, 
daniei_jackson, & teai'c who all report to col_jack_o'neiii (node A01), leader 
of SG-1. jack_o'neill reports directly to gen_hammond (node A05). 
daniel_jackson, & teai'c, both being civilians, also report to gen_hammond and 
thusly have two links in the chain of command. maj_samantha_carter, being 
military, directly reports to her team leader, col_jack_o'neill.

Ready 


The rest of the Node sets and Networks 

Next you have to decide what other Node sets you need... 

I created Stargate Node sets for events: important events during the course of the 
scenario, knowledge: important information necessary for the completion of the 
mission, resource: material objects important to the mission, location: where 
particular events took place, and tasks: specific jobs for the completion of the 
mission. 


...and how these Node sets need to interact with each other. 


For Stargate_summit I decided I needed: agent x agent , agent x event, agent x 
knowledge, agent x resource , agent x task , event x event , event x 
resource, knowledge x task, resource x task, task x event, and task x task. 

Each Meta-Network will require different handling and may require more or less 
networks. 


Then, as done in the agent x agent network, decide how the various nodes interact 
with each other for each Network. When finished you will have one spreadsheet 
from which you can create all your .csv files. 


14 













NOTE: I keep all my spreadsheets in one file for easy access. One set for the Node 
sets and the other set for the Networks. 


knowledgeNodeSet resourceNodeSet locationNodeSEt taskNodeSet A x A AxE AxK AxL A: 


Saving as .CSV files 

The next step is to convert these Excel file to a format that ORA can import, namely 
the .csv format. This is easily done with Excel's Save As... function. Select the 
Excel spreadsheet you want to convert to CSV. From the Excel main menu select 
File =?> Save As.... Navigate to the directory to save your file, from the drop down 
menu select the csv format, and hit OK. Opening up this file in a text editor will 
reveal it's new format.

You can now convert all your Excel spreadsheets to CSV files in preparation for 
importing into ORA.

NOTE : If you are visiting this page from the help section on the Data Import Wizard, 
what follows is a series of lessons using the Data Import tool with the Stargate 
sample data set. You can start from the very beginning of this lesson by going to 
the preceding Meta-Networks 101 lesson) 

Now that we've got the Excel spreadsheets created and converted to .csv files it's 
time to learn about importing a CSV file into ORA. 

The Datasets 

Below is the file we will be importing. It denotes who reports to who in the SG-1 
unit and is called sgl_agent_x_agent.csv. This, and the other Stargate files, can 
be found in the ORA program folder sample data > Stargate.

Starting a new Meta-Network 

From the main menu of ORA, select File > Data Import Wizard or hit Ctrl-W. 
The Data Import dialog asks What would you like to do?. For this example we 
will be importing a network comprised of links so select Rectangle of link 
weights. Then click [ Next ]. 


16 





























In the next dialog box you will want to select Create a meta-network with ID:. 
This allows you to import a .csv file in the form of a matrix with labels on the X 
and Y axis (i.e. an agent by agent graph or resource by event and link data in 
the body). Give your new meta-network a name. I named mine sgl. When you are 
done, click [ Next ]. 



Click the [Browse] button and navigate to the ORA > sample data > Stargate > 
csv directory (mine were in a different directory). Select the 
sgl_agent_x_agent.csv file. In the Source type and Target type drop down 
menus select the types of nodes you are using. In this case both will be agent. In 
the Network ID: field, name the network (typically for this it would be agent x 
agent). When done click [ Finish ]. 


17 

































































Looking in the Meta-Network panel you'll see the stargate Meta-Network. Clicking 
the [ + ] will expand it to reveal the NodeClass and Network created. Highlighting 
either the Agent: size 5 or the Agent x Agent line and selecting the Editor tab 
will reveal the imported data.

Adding to the new Meta-Network 


You could, if you had multiple networks, import them all in at the same time. For 
each new Network file to import, click the [ Click to import from another file ] 
button and repeat the above procedure. 


NOTE: If at any time you want to remove a Network from the list select the WMl 
next to the Browse button 



18 

























































































NOTE : If you are visiting this page from the Data Import Wizard, what follows is a 
lesson on adding attributes to the Stargate sample data set provided with ORA. 
To begin the lesson from the very beginning go to Meta-Networks 101. 

The SG-1 NodeSet has been created when the network was imported. But without 
naming the individual nodes and without any attributes for those nodes it's very 
limited in it's information. Attributes help define nodes as individuals by 
designating what is special about each node. 

The Datasets 

sgl_agent_attributes.csv contains some base information got the five nodes of 
our basic network. With it we will set the nodes title and give it information on one 
attribute, gender. This, and the other Stargate files, can be found in the ORA 
program folder sample data > Stargate.

The Special Attribute, "Title" 

All attributes give information about the node they're attached to. But the title 
attribute is special. After importing the title attribute to a NodeSet it will lend this 
title to all Networks that use this NodeSet. 

NOTE: In the SG-1 Nodeset the title attribute consists of the character's names. 
This is the standard operating procedure but exactly what you use as the title is 
entirely up to you. 

Currently the NodeSet and Networks created only contain IDs which are not very 
easy for discerning who is who. 

Below is the SG-1 agent NodeSet (top) and the agent x agent Network 

(bottom). Truly this needs more definition

Adding Attributes 

Once again data needs to be imported to give it some meaning. But in this example 
the option, Node Attributes will be used as we want to import attribute data for 
the NodeSet, not Network linking data. 

First we need a duplicate of the sgl Meta-Network for this example. Highlight the 
Meta-Network then either select Edit > Copy or press Ctrl-C to copy it. Then 
either select Edit > Paste or press Ctrl-P to paste another copy. Highlight the 
bottom Meta-Network. In the Editor panel select the Meta-Netowrk ID textbox. 
Rename this Meta-Network stargate as we are going to import different 
information into each.

□ □□ Agent: size 5 
* J* Agent x Agent 

? m - stargate 

□ □□ Agent: size 5 
*J* AgentxAgent 


Find the stargate_agentNodeSet.csv. This contains all the attributes for all the 
nodes. In the first one we only want attributes for the five original nodes. In the 
second we'll allow ORA to populate our Meta-Network with any new nodes it finds. 

Highlight the sgl Meta-Network. Then click Import existing data? > Excel/CSV 
data > Single-mode table with column headers > Node Attributes. The click 
[ Next ] 


20 













































With the basic SG-1 NodeClass and Network already loaded we will now add 
attributes to the NodeClass. Place a check mark next to the sgl dataset. Then click 
the [Next] button. 



Below is the main dialog box to inform ORA what and how to import the new 
attributes. After the image is a description of each of the numbered steps. 


21 






































































• 1 With the [Browse] button you load the file containing the attributes to 
add. Once a file is selected, click the [ Next ] button 

• 2 Selects how to identify the nodes. If your file contains a column with node 
IDs use the top selection. Then select the column from the drop down menu. 
If your attribute file contains information in the same order as the nodes are 
already in then you can use the second option. 

NOTE : If you select the second option, and your nodes are in a differnt order than 
your attributes, the ORA will place the attributes in sequential order disregarding 
whether the IDs match or not. 

• 3 For each column a box will appear allowing you to chose which attributes 
to import. Place a check mark next to each attribute you want and give it a 
Type: Text Category, Text, URI, Number Category, Number, or Date. 
An attribute without a check mark will not be imported. 

• 4 In this example leave this unchecked as we only want attributes for the 
first five nodes. 

• 5 Select the NodeClass to add the attributes. This drop down will contain 
multiple entries if your Meta-Network contains more than one NodeClass. 


22 




































When finished entering information on this screen, click the [ Finish ] button. The 
NodeSet now contains names that match up to the IDs from the imported file.

Network then add them and their attributes.

NOTE : One thing to notice is there were more attributes added in the second 
procedure. When importing attributes into sgl ORA ignored any attributes which 
contained no values for any of the nodes in the Meta-Network. If the value of an 
attributes was null for all the nodes then it was not added. 

The remaining NodeClasses and Networks 

With any remaining NodeClasses and Networks for your dataset you can repeat the 
previous two lessons: first importing a Network of links then importing the 
attributes for that nodeClass. 



At this point the Meta-Network has been created and it contains the NodeSets 
and Networks. And each of the NodeSets contains titles and attributes in which to 


23 










































better define the NodeSets and Networks. But as with any dataset there will always 
be changes. 

Most certainly, as time goes on, NodeSets will require extra attributes or even new 
nodes. Possibly even new NodeSets will need to be created and worked into the 
Meta-Network. Or maybe a current set of attributes needs to be changed. What 
follows are the procedures to accomplish those tasks. 

Adding a New Node to a Meta-Network 

In this section we'll add a new node to the agent NodeSet using the Create new 
nodes from unrecognized IDs checkbox. It's for the situation that the data being 
imported contains nodes that are not in the current NodeSet. 

The new .csv file we're using contains one new set of information, the 17th agent to 
add to the agent NodeSet. Upon importing the new node we will have a 17th node 
with the title attribute. 

id,title,position,symbiote, host,dies_when,dies,ally,group,servitude,gender, race, race 
-2 

A17, zipacna,, zipacna, unknown,,, no, anubis,anubis, male, gou'ald, human 

It was created in Excel (the same way the other NodeClasses and Networks were) 
and exported out to a new .csv file called stargate_zipacna.csv. 

The easiest way to bring in a new node is to use the Attribute Import button. 


24 



1. Use the Browse button to navigate to the directory containing the new .csv 
file. It will show up in the textbox to the left. 

2. Check the proper column to use for the node ID and from the drop down 
menu select the type of node. 

3. Select the Attribute(s) you want to import. 

4. And most importantly, make sure the box Create new nodes for 
unrecognized IDs contains a checkmark in order to allow ORA to create 
new nodes. Without this checkmark ORA will ignore any nodelDs that aren't 
already in the NodeSet. 

When you review your agent NodeSet in the editor you will see a new entry at the 
bottom, the 17th node with zipacna in the Entity Title attribute.

The new node, and all their attributes, have been imported into the Meta-Network. 



There will be times when you have a Subset of a larger Meta-Network and you'll 
want to import data from a larger, main dataset. And you want to do this without 
creating new nodes. What follows are the procedures for accomplishing those goals. 

We start off with the Subset of SG-1 team and the SGC commanding officer, a 

Meta-Network of five agents.

Now, as before, navigate to the directory with your csv dataset file and import it. 
Select the column with your node ID, select the Attribute tab and create new 
Attributes using the [New] button, and finally, the most important part, remove 
the checkmark from the box next to Create new nodes for unrecognized IDs. 
Its the removing of this checkmark that will prevent ORA from creating extra nodes 
and only import data for the nodes in the selected NodeSet.

The result is maintaining a NodeSet with five nodes but attribute data imported 
only for the five nodes in the NodeSet. No new nodes will be created in this 
process. 


28 











































































There are three functions that can done with Attributes: 1) Edit and Attribute 
name; 2) edit Attribute type, and; 3) Delete an Attribute. 

All three are accomplished by Right-clicking on the Attribute Name to bring up the 
contextual menu. 


Edit Attribute Name 
Edit Attribute Type 
Delete Attribute 


Edit Attribute Name : Used for renaming an existing Attribute column. 

Edit Attribute Type : Attributes can be tagged with two types: Categorical 
or Continuous. 

Delete Attribute : Removes an Attribute column from a NodeSet. 

Replacing an Attribute Column 

NOTE: This method is suggested as ORA has the capability of retaining multiple 
values. If you want to completely replace the values then deletion and 
replacement of the column is suggested. 

For most small changes you can type in a new attribute value or two directly into 
the Editor. But say your NodeSet contained quite a few nodes, and the majority of 
the values needed changed. If might be easier to create a new .csv file and import 
the values in just as in the previous lesson. In the example below it was decided to 
completely replace all the skill_needed with a new set of values. 

Go to the ORA main interface and select the NodeSet. Then select with the attribute 
column you want to change. Right-click on the attribute name which brings up the 
contextual menu. Select Delete Attribute to remove it from the NodeSet.

After deleting a column then use the procedure for importing Attributes from 
Lesson-203 to import a new attribute information. Remember, you'll want to 
import into an Existing Meta-Network as in the example above. 


skill_needed 

<set filter > v

The skill_needed attribute has been imported into the NodeSet with the revised 
values. 



After importing data from the .csv files into ORA and then altering the data in ORA 
this somewhat makes your original data files out-of-date. 

What follows are the procedures to update your original .csv and Excel files with 
any changes that have been made recently. 

Saving Your Network Data 

From the main interface highlight the Network you want to save and Right-Click. 
This will bring up a contextual menu. Select Save Network.

This will bring up a Save dialog box. First, navigate to the directory you want to 
save your new Network file. Next, select the format (DyNetML, UCINET, DL, or 
CSV) to save the file. Give it a filename and select [Save].

Saving to each of the four formats creates five files. 

REMEMBER: The UCINET uses both .##d and ,##h extensions and both are 
needed to build a Meta-Network.

£j stargate_agent_x_agent.##h

=j stargate_agent_x_agent.xml 


NOTE: Since this Save box does not display the files present in the directory it is 
Highly Suggested that you save to a new directory and verify which previous file 
you want to replace. More information on these file formats can be found HERE 

Saving Your Attribute Data 

The above mentioned procedure works well for saving Networks but there are also 
the attributes in the NodeSets to think about. All the data is can be saved from File 
=> Save Meta-Network and the File => Save Meta-Network..., But this saves the 
data into one xml file. What if you what to save the data into individual files, the 
same as when you imported it. 

The quickest way is using the method. Values copied directly from the 

Main Interface Editor can be pasted into a Excel spreadsheet. 


31 






























In the ORA editor, highlight the cells you need to copy. Use either Ctrl-C or Edit =» 
Copy Editor Values.

Then switch to your Excel spreadsheet. Highlight the cell that corresponds to the 
top/left cell you started with in ORA and use either Ctrl-V or Edit => Paste. Entire 
NodeSets can be done in this fashion. 



IMPORTANT NOTE: Before you Copy/Paste in this manner make sure your 
columns are in the same order. This operation will NOT match up data as it's a 

blind copy/paste operation. 

You can then backup all of your NodeSets in the procedure and then re-save it to 
your .csv files. 



A Key Entity Report creates the following reports: central actors, organizations, 
central knowledge, resources, central events, tasks, central locations, and 
performance indicators. 

The Key Entity Report can either run its measures over the entire network or be 
refined or filtered to run them over only a select portion of the network. 

More detailed information regarding the basic workings of the Key Entity Report 
screens can be found 


32 

































Running a Key Entity Report: 

We'll be using the network Stargate: Summit contains all the agents involved in 
the scenario, friend and foe. The first report run will contain all the agents, friend 
and foe. 

• From the main menu select Analysis => Generate Reports which brings up 

the Generate Reports dialog box. 

• At the top of the window is a dropdown menu titled Select a Report. Pull 
down the menu by clicking the small inverted arrow icon to its right, and 
select Key Entity. 

• In the box titled Select one or more meta matrices: select the network to 
run the report on. 

• At the bottom of the box is the Transform options. 

o General Mathematical Transformation : Contains various formulas 
for manipulating a network. 

o Remove Entities : Remove node(s) from a network before running 
the measures. 

o Partition entities into separate meta matrices by attribute 
value : Create new networks based on your choice of nodes and 
attributes. 



33 



















Select the [Next >] button at the bottom of the dialog box. 



The next dialog box is for selecting the number of ranked nodes, critical 
attribute and values and also for selecting which reports you want to view. I 
am only interested in the top five nodes in the network and place a 5 in the top 
box. I don't want to point out any particular nodes, only the friends, so I'll leave the 
textbox blank. I want all the reports run so I place a checkmark in all four boxes. 

Click the [Next >] button. 


Generate Reports - Key Entity 


Reports can present their results in different formats. Each format produces one or more files that 
are saved to a specified location. When multiple files are created, each filename will be an extension 
of the one you gave. 


Select the report formats to create:

The last dialog box is for selecting what type of format for the final reports and the 
directory to place them. Text will create reports that will appear in Panel 3 of the 
interface, creates reports that will open up your browser, and creates 

files that are usable in ORA. The bottom section allows you to navigate to a 
directory where you want to save your files. 

Remove Nodes from a Key Entity Report: 

Next we'll look at removing nodes from the report. The network Stargate: Summit 
contains both the friends and foes in the scenario. But say you only want to see 
only how the friendly agents interacted. Being that there's an ally attribute this 
will make it simple to eliminate the foe agents. 

Follow the same procedure as above except click in the Remove entities radio 
button. 



In this example we're going to eliminate a portion of the network before we run the 
measures. Select the Remove entities button. Then select the [Next >] button at 
the bottom of the dialog box. 

In this dialog box you can select exactly which nodes to remove.

You'll also notice that daniel_jackson and ren'al swapped places. With various 
links removed, after eliminating the non-allies, the order of the remaining nodes 
can shift. It should also be noticed that the rating for jacob_carter_selmak has 
increased elevating his position as Emergent Leader. 



Performing a View Network Over-Time Analysis 

What follows are procedures to perform a View Network Over Time and View 
Measures Over Time Analysis. 

To either requires multiple network datasets representative of your network over 
different time periods. The goal is to analyze how a network changes across 
multiple time periods. The time period is determined by the intervals of collected 
network data and presented as multiple Meta-Networks, which are loaded into ORA 


38 








































in sequential order. The steps below provide detailed instruction on how type of 
analysis. 

To perform a View Network Over-Time Analysis, you must load Meta-Networks 
that relate to different time captures of your network data, which need to be in the 
form of multiple Meta-Networks. 

In the following example, we will use network time captures of the 1998 Embassy 
Bombing in Tanzania Meta-Network data set and compare the same data set as 
we knew it in 1997 and 1996 and 1998. We will then compare all the Meta- 
Networks in the Network Over-Time Viewer to gain a visual representation of how 
this network changed between 1996 and 1998. 

Note: For our purposes, we have changed data in this example and have renamed the Meta- 
Network for three different years. This will denote different network variables that have 
changed over time. 

You will see in the left window pane under input dataset three Meta-Networks, 
1998, 1997, and 1996, have been loaded. 

From the menu bar: File > Open Meta Network 



39 














Choose [Select Files] 



You will see all of our example data sets, which will load simultaneously into ORA, 
buy highlighting and selected all the files. 


40 







Highlight all files you analyze in Over-Time Viewer. Press [Enter], 


■ ■ Import Data into ORA 


Use this wizard to import any type of data into Ora. 

The supported file types are: dynetml (native Ora xml format), 

,dl, ,##h (UCINet), .csv (Excel format), .txt, .raw, .net (Pajek), 
.graphml, and .stl (GMU Model). 

Select one or more files below to begin.

Select [Finish]. 

All three Meta-Networks should display in Panel 1. 


41 



























Performing the Over-Time Analysis 

Now that we have time captures of our network data represented and loaded into 
ORA in the form of three Meta-Networks relating to 1996, 1997 and 1998, we can 
perform the Over-Time Analysis. 

From the Menu Bar > Data Visualization > View Network Over-Time 


Data Visualization 


Help 


Charts 

Visualizer 

View Measures Over Time 


View Network Over Time 


Drill-Down Window 

GIS 

Loom 


The ORA Visualizer will render all of the loaded Meta-Networks. 

Please take special note of the Time Viewer pop-up Window. This window displays a 
slider, which will allow you to quickly change from the first Meta-Network time 
capture of 1996, to 1997 and 1998 respectively. 

By moving the slider from one Meta-Network to the next, you will gain a visual 
perspective on how the network has changed over Time. 


42 





























The series of screen shots below display how the visualized data changes from one 
slider to position to the next. This allows you a picture of how the network changes 
Over-Time. 

Please note: Depending on the complexity of the network and the extent to which 
relationships (ties) have changed, the visualization of those changes may be subtle. 

The screen shots below, however, will emphasize the extent to which the role of the 
WTC Event entity has changed from 1996 to 1998 in relation to the network of 
which it is part of namely the Tanzania data set. Below these screen captures, are a 
series of detail screen captures focusing on the WTC Event node.

WTC Event Node: Detail 2 -1997 


Notice who how the relationships of this node to the rest of the network has changed from 
1996 to 1997. 



Notice that the connections (links) have changed from 1996 to 1997. 



46 









































As you can see, as we progress through the data sets pertaining to 1996, 1997 
and 1998, the event node WTC lost direct ties to other parts of the network. In 
the 1996 data set, WTC had 3 ties to other entities in the Tanzania Embassy 
network; In 1997, only 2; Finally, in 1998, the WTC event node had only 1 
link to Tanzania Network. This may indicate that the WTC node may have lost 
importance from one year to the next. 

Summary of Lesson 

At this point, you should be able to complete the following tasks to perform an 
Over-Time Network Analysis. 

• Load multiple Time Data Captures in the form of Meta-Networks, which are 
representative of your network (Meta-Network) over time. 

• Use the Over-Time slider window tool to move from one time capture to the 
next. 

• Gain a visual perspective of how your overall network has changed from one 
time capture to the next. 

Performing the View Measures Over-Time Analysis 

ORA provides an alternative method to analyzing your network data (in the form 

of Meta-Networks captured over time) than the only in the Visualizer. 

By running a View Measures Over Time analysis you can visualize how your 
network changes in relation to any given measure in the form of charts, which take 
you from one time point to the next. 

Below is a series of screen captures and instruction on how to access the View 
Measures Over Time feature:

Select View Measures Over Time. 



Select [OK] 

The View Measure Over Time Window will appear. You will see that this window 
is primarily organized into three sections. 

Area 1: is a slider where you can control various inputs that affect the aggregation 
level of your Meta-Networks. 

Area 2: is a tabbed index allowing you to select the graph level you desire and the 
individual entity sets you are interested in analyzing. 

Area 3: displays the actual chart based on the measures you selected in the tabbed 
index and the position of the aggregation slider. 



48 





























Interpreting The Results After Performing View Measures Over-Time Analysis 

In the example above, we have loaded all three of our network time captures into 
the View Measures Over Time Analysis tool. The result of our analysis, as we have 
indicated before, will be displayed as a chart in the bottom section of the ORA 
interface in Panel 3. But, what does this tell us? To find out, we will examine the 
Graph Level measure Knowledge Waste. From the tabbed measures window: 

Graph tab > Congruence, Organization Measure, Knowledge Waste. 

The result is displayed below. 



We can see the chart displays an axis scale correlating to our networks over time. 
The graph level measure of Knowledge Waste was selected using the View 
Measures Over Time tool and the result is displayed in the chart area of the 
window. 

We can see that the graph level measure of Knowledge Waste held a value slightly 
above 40 in the first Meta-Network, 1996, displayed with 1 on the Time axis. We 
can deduce from the chart that in 1997 something affected our measure of 
Knowledge Waste to increase the value to nearly 60. This corresponds to the time 
scale axis of 2, which represents 1997, our second year of network data. In the 
final year, 1998, our measure of Knowledge Waste declined to the value in 1996. 
This should be visually evident with its relative line graph position. 

It is clear that the value for the Knowledge Waste Measure increased from the first 
Meta-Network (1996) to the second (1997) and then retreated back to its original 


49 















(1996) level. It would be up to you to determine what may have affected that 
measure for it to undergo this progression and regression. 

Summary of Lesson 

At this point, you should be able to complete the following tasks to perform a View 
Measures Over-Time Analysis: 


• Load multiple data files into ORA (in the form of Meta-Networks) 
representative of your network across certain periods of time. 

• Select an aggregation level and choose a graph level or entity entity set to 
analyze. 

• Analyze the data output in the charting tool located in the bottom section of 
the View Measures Over Time window. 


• See how your network may have changed from one time capture to the next 
for any given graph level or entity node measure. 


• Use this visual comprehension to draw conclusions about how your network 
changed across multiple time periods. 



Working with Attributes 


• What is an attribute? 

• An attribute is a quality, an added description, a differentiation of some 
sort, of a Who, What, Where, How and When and Whatever. It also indicates 
the presences, absence or strength of a particular connection. As an 
example, you might create a network of people (Whos) who work at certain 
buildings (Locations). The attributes of those people could range anywhere 
from their first and last name, their employee identification number, their job 
grade in the corporation, their salary, their home phone number, education, 
political affiliation and the list goes on. Moreover, we might say that you 
have a connection to both your friend and father. However, we might give 
the connection to your father the attribute of family whereas your friend 
might be attributed personal. The key is to know that attributes can be both 
differentiate nodes or ties or both. 

• It follows that it would be helpful to view a network of Whos (and or any of 
the other node classes) and see how those Whos are grouped according to 
any particular attribute you are interested in analyzing. ORA has the 
capability to do just that and provides several ways of doing so. We will 
explore several methods of locating groups namely by using ORA's report 
tool and in the Visualizer.

Using Attributes to find groups in ORA 
Reports 


To create and assess groups by attribute use the Locate Subgroups report 

accessible in ORA Reports at the following path: 

Main Menu Bar > Analysis > Generate Reports 

1. Select the Locate Subgroups report (see screen shot below for more 
detail) 

2. Select the grouping algorithm "Attribute" 

3. Choose the attribute of interest 

4. Click Next 

5. Make sure to select Create block diagram at the top 

By default a new meta-network is created that contains the networks used in the 
grouping. 

In addition, there is a new node class that contains the group nodes, which in this 
case are just the attribute value nodes. Also two block model group x group 
networks are created. 

To access this tool, follow the steps below: 

Above is an image of the Locate Subgroups report tool in ORA. 

The Locate Subgroups report tool is divided into three sections labeled "Step 1" 
"Step 2" and "Step 3". 

In "Step 1" the tool can be applied to the entire Meta-Network by selecting the 
check box. Individual networks can be selected by scrolling down in the "Step 1" 
box and selecting the specific network level to which to apply the Locate Subgroups 
tool (i.e., agent x agent, agent x knowledge, et al.) 

In "Step 2" a particular type of grouping algorithm can be selected ( Concor , 
Newman, Johnson, et al.). Use the scroll bar to locate the grouping algorithm to 
select. 

In "Step 3" You can select the specific grouping algorithm parameters for the 
grouping algorithm selected in "Step 2" (i.e.. If the "Johnson" grouping algorithm 
was selected, use the panel tabs in "Step 3" to select "similarity" or "dissimilarity", 
number of groups to create, et al.). 


51 










After all required input is entered in Steps 1, 2, and 3, select "Next" to run the 
Locate Subgroups report. 

Above is an image of the algorithm output box. 

The algorithm output box allows you specify the type of algorithm output type you 
may need. You can choose from the following types of output: 

• Group Membership Matrix 

• Block Diagram 

• Hierarchical clustering diagram 

• Dendogram 

• Attribute value distributions 

Once you select the appropriate algorithm output type, select [Next] to choose 
report model format. You will have the following choices available: 

• Text 

. HTML 
. CSV 

Finally, choose a file path to save your report name the report accordingly without 
specifying an extension. You can use the file chooser or enter the path manually to 
specify a location to save the report. 

You will also see that your locate subgroups output will have generated a Meta- 
Network, which will be loaded into ORA's Meta-Network Manager. You can save out 
this new Meta-Network, run measures, generate reports or apply any of ORA's 
functions and tools otherwise available in performing an analysis of a Meta-Network 



Using Attributes to find groups in the 
Visualizer 


What follows are instructions for finding various groups that may exist in your 
Meta-Network by using attributes and the ORA Visualizer too. To follow along with 
this lesson, please load the SGI data set included with your installation. 

Step 1: Open the Stargate Meta-Network. 


52 












Step 2: Select [ Visualizer ] button. 


53 



































Step 3: In The Visualization, select "Attribute / Measure" Layout. 


54 



























Step 4: Next (screen shot below) you will see the "Attribute / Measure" Layout 
Dialog box appear. In this box, select the attribute for an X and Y coordinate. You 
can use the save button to come back to these settings later. After choosing your 
attributes, click "Run Layout." 


55 






























































Step 5: You can experiment with the X and Y values by using either attributes or 
measures. In the final result shown below, we choose to use the X value as an 
attribute and the Y values as a measure. 


56 












Loom allows you to view nodes over time and which locations these nodes visited.

Loading the Star Wars dataset 

For this example we will be using the 
Star Wars dataset included in the 
sample folder. You can find it in the 
following folder: ORA > sample data 
> Loom data > Star Wars. There 
will be 24 xml files. From the main 
menu select File > Open Meta- 
Network..., Navigate to the folder 
specified above. Select the first file 
then Shift-Click the last file to select 
them all. Then select [Open]. This 
will display them in the Meta-Network 
panel. 

Trail pattern length determines which 
clusters will be shown. 

To open this data in Loom make sure 
all Meta-Networks are selected. From 
the drop down menu select 
Visualizations > View Trails. You 
will be asked to chose a network. For 
this dataset chose Characters x 
Location. On the left will be two 
panes. On top is a list of Characters 
and below that is a list of locations. 


After opening the dataset in Loom all the characters will appear in the left/top pane 
and will start with no nodes checked. Below are the locations and the colors which 
will signify them on the Loom. 


58 




Trail pattern length 

Trail pattern length displays clusters of nodes which have the same general trail. 
The number is the minimum number of points they all need to have in common. 

Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru are in [4] timeslices. They will continue to be 
clustered until the Trail pattern length reaches [5]. At that point they no longer 
meet the conditions and are no longer clustered. 


59 









































Minimum Similarity 

This is the minimum number of [continuous] points that nodes need to have in 
common to be clustered. Whenever a node falls under this number it is dropped 
from the cluster. 

Here R2-D2, C-3P0, .uke Skywalker, and Obi-Wan Kenobi are clustered. When 
the Minimum Similarity reaches four Obi-Wan drops out of the cluster when he 
leaves for a different location.

Change Detection (Over-Time Viewer) 


Description 

The View Measures Over-Time is used to find out how quickly you can identify 
changes in a network to exploit subtle organization change, And also to facilitate 
improved command and control subject to a specifid risk of false alarm. Various 



62 












































measures of a network are taken at different points in time. You need to identify a) 
that a change did occur and b) when did that change occur. 

NOTE : It is important to note that this is not predicting change. But rather it is 
detecting that a change has occurred quickly and be able to make some inference 
about the actual time of change. 

Example of Change Detection 

Change Detection may offer you a tool to operate inside the normal decision cycle. 
The following figure represents some measure of interest over time. It could be the 
revenue of a company, the combat power of an enemy, or a measure of interest 
from a social network. When do you conclude from this measure that a change may 
have occurred? Let's assume that by conventional methods you can detect a 
change in organizational behavior as of today, the vertical line. This time point 
might be too late to take preventative or mitigating action. In other words, this 
could be the point of inevitable bankruptcy for the company, or the successful 
culmination of a terrorist attack. Identifying that a change occurred by time period 
E might allow the analyst to respond to the change before it is too late; get inside 
the decision cycle. 



Change detection is more challenging than it may seem at first. The sudden 
change in the measure between time D and time E, however, may look very 
similar to the peak at time A. Furthermore, if you assert that a change in fact 
occurs at time A, there may exist a large amount of time periods to investigate for 


63 









the cause of any change. If you can identify more likely points in time where 
change may have occurred, you can reduce the costs in terms of time and 
resources to search for the potential causes of change. Identifying the likely time 
that a change may have occurred is called Change Point Identification. 

Another problem you face is detecting the change as quickly as possible after the 
change occurred. Can you improve the ability to get inside the decision cycle by 
detecting the change at time D, or even better at time B? This is called Change 
Detection. 


NOTE : It is important that you use at least 10 time periods for an accurate 
simulation. 



This is simple and easy to implement and provides a Proof of Concept. If calculates 
a sarnie average of observations and measures of a process. The decision interval 
indicates whether the observation is in the tail of the disbtribution. 



Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) 

Other statistical schemes increase power (faster detection, given the same 
probability for false alarm). The CUSUM considers previous values of the observed 
process. It can take a long time to detect small changes. Intuitively, we can see 
change earlier. How to detect it? 


64 



















Cumulative Sum is good at detecting small changes in mean over time and has 
good buildt-in change point detection. 

The Load data and use CUSUM option. CUSUM has an additional parameter. This 
is equivalent to ? in the equation presented earlier. It is an optimality parameter for 
the CUSUM approach that will make this approach the uniformly most powerful for 
a change in the social network measure of ?. As a rule of thumb this is usually set 
to 1. 

There are three ways to set the risk of a False Alarm. 

1. The user can specify the decision interval. 

2. The user can specify a probability as in the Shewhart approach. 

3. The user can specify the average number of in-control networks expected 
before a false alarm. 

This is due to the nested conditional probability inherent in the CUSUM. 

The CUSUM signals a change, when the statistic exceeds the decision interval. The 
most likely point in time that the change actually occurred is interpreted as the 
point that the CUSUM was last equal to 0. In this case, the time period is 19, which 
is one time point before the actual change. This is where an analyst would begin to 
look for explanations of change in the group. There are two separate charts plotted. 
One is for increases (red) in the social network measure, and the other is for 
decreases (blue) in the measure. 

Exponetially Weighted Moving Average 

This chart requires two items. 

• A definition of what normal behavior is. 

• What is the risk of false alarm. (This is a trade-off between speed and 
mistakes).

One major obstacle to the study of network dynamics is periodicity or over¬ 
time dependence in longitudinal network data. For example, if we define a 
social network link as an agent sending an email to another, we have continuous 
time stamped data. Intuitively, we can imagine that individuals are more likely 
to email each other at certain times of the day, days of the week, etc. If the 
individuals in the network are students, then their email traffic might follow the 
school's academic calendar. Seasonal trends in data are common in a variety of 
other applications as well. When these periodic changes occur in the 
relationships that define social network links, social network change detection 
methods are more likely to signal a false positive. 

A False Positive : This occurs when the social network change detection 
method indicates that a change in the network may have occurred, when in fact 
there has been no change. 

To illustrate, assume that you are monitoring the density of the network for 
change in hourly intervals. The density of the network measured for the interval 
between 3 A.M. and 4 A.M. might be significantly less than the network 
measured from 3 P.M. to 4 P.M. because most of the people in the network are 


69 

























asleep and not communicating between 3 A.M. and 4 A.M. This behavior is to be 
expected, however, and it is not desireable for the change detection algorithm to 
signal a potential change at this point. Rather, it would be ideal to control for 
this phenomenon by accounting for the time periodicity in the density measure. 
Only then can real change be identified quickly in a background of noise. 

Periodicity can occur in many kinds of longitudinal data. Organizations may 
experience periodicity as a result of scheduled events, such as a weekly meeting 
or monthly social event. Social networks collected on college students are likely 
to have periodicity driven by both the semester schedule and academic year. 
Even the weather may introduce periodicity in social network data, as people are 
more or less likely to email, or interact face-to-face. 

Spectral Analysis provides a framework to understand periodicity. Spectral 
analysis is mathematical tool used to analyze functions or signals in the 
frequency domain as opposed to the time domain. If we look at some measure 
of a social group over time, we are conducting analysis in the time domain. The 
frequency domain allows us to investigate how much of the given measure lies 
within each frequency band over a range of frequencies. 

For example, the figure below shows a notional measure on some made-up 
group in the time domain. It can be seen that the measure is larger at points B 
and D corresponding to the middle of the week. The measure is smaller at points 
A, C, and E. 


70 



If that signal is converted to the frequency domain as shown in the figure 
bwlow, you can see how much of the measure lies within certain frequency 
bands. The negative spike corresponds to 7 days, which is the weekly periodicity 
in the notional signal. The actual frequency signal only runs to a value of 8 on 
the x-axis. The frequency domain signal after a value of 8 is a mirror image, or 
harmonic of the actual frequency signal. 


71

The frequency domain representation of a signal also includes the phase shift 
that must be applied to a summation of sine functions to reconstruct the original 
over-time signal. In other words, we can combine daily, weekly, monthly, 
semester, and annual periodicity to recover the expected signal over-time due to 
periodicity. For example, the next figures represent monthly, weekly, and sub¬ 
weekly periodicities. If these signals are added together, meaning that the 
observed social network exhibits all three of these periodic behaviors, the 
resulting signal is shown in Sum of the Signals. 


72 





Monthly Period 


Weekly Period 


Sub-Weekly Period 



If the periodicity in the signal is not accounted for, it appears that there may be 
a change in behavior around time period 20, where the signal is negatively 
spiked. In reality, this behavior is caused by periodicity. If you transform the 
signal to the frequency domain you can see the weekly periodicity at point B and 
the sub-weekly periodicity at point A. 


73 

















Spectral Analysis applied to social network measures over time will identify 
periodicity in the network. The next procedure will transform an over time 
network measure from the time domain to the frequency domain using a Fourier 
transform. Then the significant periodicity will be identified in the over-time 
network and present two methods for handling the periodicity. 

The over time dependence analysis is accessed by selecting the Fast Fourier 
Transform tab in the Over Time Viewer. This displays the frequency plot of the 
data. 

You can use the Over Time Viewer to help determine which frequencies are 
significant. 

The [Dominant Frequencies radio button], displays only the statistically 
significant frequencies. 

The [Fourier Transform radio button uses the normal distribution in order to 
transform data from the time domain to the frequency domain. Therefore, the 
normal distribution is an appropriate distribution to fit to the frequencies plotted 
in the frequency plot. All frequencies that are within two standard deviations of 
the mean are then set equal to zero for the dominant frequency plot, revealing 
only the dominant frequencies. 


74 










NOTE : A dominant frequency is a potential source of periodicity, as opposed to 
random noise in the over time signal. 

The analyst will often want to transform the statistically significant frequencies 
from the frequency domain back into the time domain so that he/she can make 
better sense of them. To do this, the analyst must select the radio button on the 
lower left called Period Plot. 

The [Period Plot radio button] shows the analyst the expected periodicity in 
the over-time data. In the example, you can see weekly periodicity. The peaks 
and valleys in the period plot occur approximately every 7 days. At this point, 
the analyst may wish to merge the daily data into weekly networks. This would 
average out the effects of weekends and evenings that are likely to affect the 
properties of daily networks. Another approach is to simply look at the networks 
departure from what is expected. 

The [Filtered Plot radio button] will create an over-time plot of how the 
measure deviates from what is expected, based on the periodicity of the 
measure. You can also plot the filtered measure with the original measure to see 
the difference as shown below.

From the Editor's main menu select Visualizations > View Measures Over

about are the Closeness and Betweenness measures. But this will not always be 
the case. 


Finally click [Compute]. 

Set Parameters For Trigger 

False Alarm vs. Fast Detection : You need to determine which type detection 
you are looking for. This will help you set the trigger point. Where you set the 
risk bar has an effect on triggering alarms. Set it too low and it will trigger an 
alarm quite frequently possibly giving too many false alarms. Set it too high and 
you might not see the trigger until it's too late. 

Example 

I select Network Centralization, Row Betweenness : A-03 

Next I click the Change Detection tab abd select CUSUM from the drop down 
menu. 

I then set the Risk to 0.17 and click [Compute]. 



Setting the Risk to 0.17 sets the trigger line in the chart (1). 

The datapoint at (2) is a major spike but has not set off the alarm yet. 


76 




























































After a slight decrease the next jump at datapoint (3) is still under the trigger 
point but very close, and the following datapoint sets off the alarm Sep-2009. 
Tracing backwards the point of change is Jul-2009 when the upward trend 
began. 

NOTE : There are two separate charts plotted. One is for increases (red) in the 
social network measures, and the other is for decreases (blue) in the measure. 

NOTE : When a change signals in both increasing and decreasing directions, it is 
iikey a false alarm. 

NOTE : Once a signal occurs the CUSUM is no longer plotted over time. 

Early Detection/False Alarm 



Setting parameters to different values can make changes in the alarm rate. 
Changes in the parameters (1) are Networks in control increase to 4 and 
Risk increases to 0.193. This lowers the alarm trigger point to 0.7 (2). 

(3) shows that the alarm is triggered in Aug-2009, a month earlier than the 
previous example although the upward trend is also Jul-2009. 

Had the Risk been risen any more the alarm would have been triggered in Jun- 
2009 and the changed point would be taken as May-2009, a full two months 
earlier than the previous example. 


77 

































































The question would be is May-2009 the true change point or is it merely a false 
alarm given the parameters set to detect it.

This is an overview of your first run of AutoMap3. It is not an all-inclusive view of 
AutoMap but will cover the, more or less, necessary basics. 

Procedure 
1. Create Workspace 

A good starting point is creating a project directory, a place where all your input 
files and output files will reside. This helps prevent files from getting lost. One 
suggestion is to create a top level project directory and create input and output 
directories within that directory. I also create a directory to place all support files 
such as Delete Lists and all the Thesauri. 


78 





















Place all your input files into the input directory. Place any Delete Lists, Thesauri 
and other files to be used in the support directory. Direct all your results to the 
output directory. 

2. Preparing Your Files 

Files can come from any source. But to use in AutoMap3 they must be .txt files. 
Files in a Word format or html files will not be accepted into AutoMap. Any of 
these formats must be re-saved as a .txt format. This could be as simple as re¬ 
saving the file in the correct format to doing a copy-and-paste of the text into a 
text editor. 

NOTE : AutoMap accepts a variety of text encodings but they must be in a .txt 
format. 

3. Load your files into AutoMap 

Once the text files are in the correct format they can be loaded into AutoMap. From 
the Pull Down Menu select File = Select Input Directory and navigate to the 
directory where you placed your text files. The first of these files will appear in the 
main window.

functions create any output files (though some require externally created files to 
work). These functions remove excess concepts (e.g. Remove Punctuation, 
Numbers, extra white spaces, or Symbols) or modify concept names (e.g. 
Thesauri for creating key_concepts) for easier generation and post-processing 
functions. 

5. Creating a Generalization Thesaurus 

Many people, places and things can be known by a variety of different formats of 
their names. A General Thesauri helps consolidate these various names under one 
unifying term. Below is an example. The format is concept,key_concept. Concept 
can be one or more words but key_concept must be one single word which can use 
the underscore. 


80 





























usCitizen Gen Thes. csv 

John Smith,John Smith 

United States,United States of America 
USA,United States of America 

NOTE : The Thesaurus changes both the 2nd and 3rd concepts to the key_concept 

United_States_of_America. 

Create this file in a text editor or spreadsheet program and save it as a .csv file. 

6. Apply a Generalization Thesaurus 

From the Pull Down Menu select Preprocess => Apply Generalization Thesauri 

and navigate to your Generalization Thesaurus. At the Adjacency dialog box select 
Rhetorical. After applying the text will change to reflect the application of the 
thesaurus. 

Text after General Thesauri applied 

John_Smith lives in the United_States_of_America . He is a 
United_States_of_America citizen. 

7. Edit your General Thesauri 

After applying a Thesaurus the list can be altered by selecting from the Pull Down 
Menu Tools => Thesauri Editor. 

8. Delete Extra/Unneeded Concepts 

Texts usually have many extra concepts, or noise, that are not relevant to the 
semantic connections. A Delete List removes those extra words. From the Pull Down 
Menu select Preprocess = > Apply Delete List and navigate to the Delete List you 
want to use. The text in the main will change to reflect the application of the Delete 
List. 

usCitizenDeieteList. txt 

in 

the 

is 

a 

Text after Delete List with rhetorical adjacency 

John Smith lives xxx xxx USA. He xxx xxx United States 
citizen. 

9. View and Alter Delete Lists 

After creating Delete List you may want to make changes to it with the Delete List 
Editor. From the Pull Down Menu select Tools => Delete List Editor. From this 


81 


tool you can add or remove concepts from a Delete List. From the Pull Down Menu 
select File => Save as Delete List and either replace the old file or save it as a 
new file. 

NOTE: If you decide to make changes to the Delete List then Undo the applied 
Delete List and reapply the new one. 

10. Generate Output 

After preprocessing the text it's time to produce output from them. The Pull Down 
Menu Generate contains functions that tell AutoMap to write output for the 
function selected; Concept Lists, Semantic List, Parts of Speech, and other useful 
functions. 

Each function outputs files that can be examined for analysis and used to further 
process the text files. 

11. Example of Output for Concept List 

From the Pull Down Menu select Generate => Concept List. AutoMap will ask for 
the directory to save the concept list. 

concept,frequency,relative_frequency,gram_type,tf-idf 

"He","1","0.5","single", "0.0" 

"John_Smith","1","0.5", "single", "0.0" 

"United States_of America","21.0","single","0.0" 

"citizen","1","0.5","single", "0.0" 

"lives","1","0.5","single", "0.0"

Encoding Lesson 


Encoding Problems 

The first you need to know is when you use the Select Input Directory AutoMap 
expects to find files in the standard UTF-8 format. If the files in the directory are 
encoded differently the text in the display will not show up correctly. 

Because the text you want to analyze could possibly come from a variety of sources 
there's no assurance that it's in the UTF-8 format. Word files, web pages, emails, or 
whatever else you can find can have a variety of encodings. And sometimes when 
you import text you find it's NOT in the form you thought it would be. 


82 










Those empty little boxes 

Occasionally, when importing text, you will get empty boxes instead of the some 
specialty characters. This is due to differences in the encoding schemes. What is 
the problem? It's a simple explanation and a simple fix. 

There are two kinds of UTF-8, with and without the BOM (Byte 
Order Mark) at the beginning of the file. Microsoft products 
require the BOM in order to recognize UTF-8, and the UTF-8 
they produce has a BOM. Most other products produce UTF-8 
without a BOM. 

Technically no BOM is required for UTF-8, but Microsoft has 
adopted the convention of using its presence to distinguish 
that encoding from the OS default. 

So without that marker some of your text may become mismarked. 

Cut-and-Paste problems 

Your first document may have started out with a proper UTF-8 format. But as you 
begin cutting and pasting material from other sources you may be adding oher 
formats. Anytime text is pasted into another document it retains it's encoding. 

Smart Quotes 

Smart quotes are not considered proper quote characters. The standard value for 
the straight quote character is 34; there is only one character for both the 
beginning and ending quotes. The smart, or curly, quotes are actually two entirely 
different characters, " (left curly quote mark) and " (right curly quote mark). 

The original designers of the ASCII character set did not define a standard method 
for identifying properly curved quotation marks, so computers have had a problem 
properly exchanging quotation marks ever since. 

The Solution 

First try AutoMap's Text Import function and allow AutoMap to try to detect the 
sources encoding. This function is designed to convert text into standard UTF-8 
format. 

If the program doesn't work, you can also use a third party text-editor to convert 
the data. Both Microsoft Word and the free Notepad + + text editor (http://notepad- 
plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm) support this functionality. Simply open the file in 
your editor and do a Save As... a .txt file. Microsoft's Notepad saves files as single¬ 
byte ANSI (ASCII) by default. 


83 


Foreign Characters Sets 

Foreign characters sets are an entirely different matter. These will require you to 
have the proper font installed on your computer as each font can possibly be 
encoded differently. 


17 JUN 09 



Concept Lists (the frequency of concepts in one file) and Union Concept Lists (the 
frequency of concepts throughout all loaded files) can be used to work with 
concepts from one or more text files. It lists the frequency, relative frequency, and 
gram type. When working with multiple files you'll find the Union Concept List 
useful. 

NOTE : The number of unique concepts considers each concept only once. The 
number of total concepts considers repetitions of concepts. 

Concept List Procedure 

1. Select a text file(s) to use 

Place your text file(s) in an empty directory. Load the file(s) by selecting from the 
Pull Down Menu File => Import Text Files. 

theBoy-4.txt: 

See the boy named Dave. He has 2 balls. 1 ball is red. 1 ball 
is blue. 

miikAndCookies. txt: 

Dave wants milk and cookies. He drives to the store. He then 
buys milk and cookies. 

2. Create Concept List 

From the Pull Down Menu select Generate => Concept List => Concept List 
(per text). Navigate to where you want to save the file(s) and click Select. 


84 










3. Decide if you need Union Concept List 

After specifying the directory for the Concept List(s) AutoMap will ask if you want to 
create a Union Concept List. Unless you know you will not need it, click Yes. 

4. Review a Concept List in the Concept List Viewer 

The Concept List(s) and Union Concept List can be viewed using Concept List 
Viewer. From the Pull Down Menu select Tools => Concept List Viewer. From 
the Viewer Pull Down Menu select File => Open File and navigate to the location 
of the concept list to view. 



NOTE : If you load a Union Concept List the right-most column has the header 
relative_percentage denoting the frequency of a concept occurring in all text 
files. 

Concept List Viewer functions 
Sorting a Concept List 

A Concept List can be sorted by clicking on any of the headers. This will sort the list 
in an ascending order. Clicking the same header again will reverse the sorting order 
to descending. Which header is being used will be denoted by a small triangle to 
the left of the header name. 


85 






























NOTE : The small triangle to the right of the header will tell you which header is 
used for sorting and whether it's in ascending upward facing arrow or descending 

downward facing arrow order. 

Creating a Delete List 

A Delete List can be created from the Concept List Viewer. Place a check mark in 
the Selected column of each concept to include in a Delete List. From the Pull 
Down Menu select File => Save as Delete List. AutoMap will prompt you to select 
a location to save the Delete List. Give it a unique filename and click Open. 

NOTE : The Delete List can be saved in either the .txt or a .csv format. 

This new Delete File can now be loaded and applied to your texts. 

Selecting Concepts 

In the Viewer Edit menu the viewer gives you options for selecting/unselecting 
multiple concepts. 

Select All : Places a check mark in every check box. 

Select None : Clears all check marks from the concept list. 

Select Minimum Threshold : The number input will select concepts with 
frequencies equal to or greater than the threshold to be selected. 

Select Maximum Threshold : The number input will select concepts with 
frequencies equal to or lesser than the threshold to be selected. 

Find : will highlight the input text, if found, with a cyan background. 

Reset Colors : removes all highlighting.

AutoMap is designed to extract, analyze, and interpret relational data (also known 
as network data) from unstructured, natural language text data. 


86 










Relation Extraction Sources 


The source of your daya can be anything: books, television, newspapers, blogs, 
emails, internet sites. AutoMap will extract the data and sort it into relational data 
which can be further analyzed in ORA. 

Method 

The first thing to do is identify the problem/goal. 

Next all/some of the concepts need identified in the texts and the links between 
them (binary, typed, directed, weighted) can be defined. 

Now this data can be represented as relational data (graph or list). 

Then the data can be analyzed. 

And finally the results can be interpreted. 

How is network data collected? 

Interviews, Automated (web-based surveys).

Data collection is more of an approximation via Network Text Analysis as most real- 
world networks and sequential data are not iid (independent and identically 
distrbuted). Network data is a concise represntation of what's in the text data - Is it 
not the truth, only an approximation.

Using a Delete List 


Description 

Delete Lists allow you to remove non-content bearing conjunctions, articles and 
other noise from texts. It also allows you to delete concepts that you just don't care 
about for analysis purposes. 


87 

































Delete Lists can be created internally in AutoMap or externally in a text editor or 
spreadsheet. They are a preprocessing stage done before doing any output. 

NOTE : Whether you apply the Delete List(s) before or after applying a Thesauri 
will depend on your exact circumstances. AutoMap allows for applying multiple 
Delete Lists is that is a necessity, one before and one after. 

Delete List Procedure 

1. Select a text file(s) to use 

Place the text to use in an empty directory. Below is an example text. 

tedInUSA.txt 

Ted lives in the United States of America. He lives on a dairy 
farm. He considers it a good life. Would he ever consider 
leaving? 

2. Create a Concept List 

To create a Delete List it helps to know the frequency of the concepts in the files. 
From the Pull Down Menu select Generate => Concept List. Save the file in your 
output directory. 

3. Create a Delete List 

A Delete List can be created within AutoMap using the Concept List Viewer. From 
the Pull Down Menu select Tools => Concept List Viewer. Navigate to the 
directory containing the Concept List file and select a file. In the Viewer place a 
check mark in the Selected column next to the concepts to include. From the View 
Pull Down Menu select File => Save as Delete List. Save the file in your support 
directory. The Delete List created can be viewed in the Delete List Viewer by 
selecting Tools => Delete List Viewer. 

A Delete List can also be created in Excel. Load the Concept List in Excel and sort 
by the frequency column. Create a new column and label it Delete List. Place an X 
next to all concepts to include in the Delete List. Sort the spreadsheet by the Delete 
List column. Copy all the rows containing an X in the Delete List column. Create a 
new sheet and paste these rows into it. Delete the column with the Xs. Save this 
file as a .txt file. 


88 


NOTE : For large concept lists review the top 100 entries and add concepts to the 
Delete List items. Resort primarily by the Delete List column and secondarily by the 
concept column. Review the top 100 again. Repeat this process until the top 100 
entries are of interest, review the rest of the list for other unneeded or unwanted 
concepts. Save this list as a .txt file. 

TIP : Create a cut-off limit (e.g. a word needs to be used at least three times. 
Concepts used less than that are placed on the Delete List.

4. Apply a Delete List 

From the Pull Down Menu select Preprocess => Apply Delete List. Navigate to 
the directory where your delete list is stored. 

5. Adjacency Option 

AutoMap will ask what type of adjacency you what to use. The Adjacency option 
determines whether AutoMap will replace deleted concepts with a placeholder or 
not. 

• Direct Adjacency : Removes concepts in the text that match concepts 
specified in the delete list and causes the remaining concepts to become 
adjacent. 

• Rhetorical Adjacency : Removes concepts in the text that match concepts 
specified in the delete list and replaces them with (xxx). The placeholders 
retain the original distances of the deleted concepts. This is helpful for visual 
analysis. 

6. The newly pre-processed texts can be viewed in the main window. 

Delete List with Rhetorical Adjacency 

Ted lives xxx xxx United States xxx America. He lives xxx xxx 
dairy farm. He considers xxx xxx good life. Would he ever 
consider leaving? 

Delete List with Direct Adjacency 

Ted lives United States America. He lives dairy farm. He 
considers good life. Would he ever consider leaving? 


89 


NOTE : If using Direct Adjacency the concepts are NOT replaced with anything. 

The concepts are moved next to the ones before and after. For more information on 
Delete Lists see the Content section. 

NOTE : If you need to remove the Delete List it can be Un-applied using the Undo 
function under the Pull Down Menu Preprocess or from the quick launch buttons. 

Other Delete List Functions 

Multiple Delete Lists 

Multiple delete lists can be applied to the same text in any order the user wants. 
They can be viewed in order using the Pull Down Menu. 

NOTE : This is useful if you have multiple specialty Delete Lists. 

Modifying a Delete List 

After a Delete list is created you can modify it using the Delete List Editor. From 
the Pull Down Menu select Tools => Delete List Editor. From the View Pull Down 
Menu select Open File and navigate to the Delete List to view.

you've added all concepts necessary. The next time you save the Delete List 
it will be saved without the checked concepts. 

• Remove Concepts : Click in the check box next to the concept to remove in 
the Select to Remove column.. The next time you save the Delete List it 
will be saved without the checked concepts. 


90 




















NOTE : No concepts are added or deleted until you actually save the file. 

• Create New Delete List : From the viewer Pull Down Menu select File => 
Save as Delete List. AutoMap will prompt you to select a directory and give 
the file a new file name. 

NOTE : Make sure to give the file the .txt extension. 

Save text(s) after Delete List 

After applying a Delete you can save your texts by selecting from the Pull Down 
Menu File => Save Preprocess Files. This step must be done before any other 
preprocessing as this option saves the texts at the highest level of preprocessing.

Using a Generalization Thesaurus 


Description 

Thesauri are generally used to take multiple concepts, in different forms, and 
compile them under one key concept. If this is not done then the same concept 
could be listed many times as individual concepts. 

Thesauri Procedure 

1. Select your text file(s) 

Copy these files into a text editor and save them as johnSmith.txt and 
countryThesauri.csv. Place the johnSmith.txt in a folder by itself. Place 
countryThesauri.csv in an accessible folder other than wherejohnSmith.txt resides. 

usdtizen.txt 

John Smith lives in the USA. He is a United States citizen. 

2. Prepare your Thesauri 

For this simple file the thesauri is short. Larger texts could easily have hundreds of 
entries. This can be done in either a text editor or a spreadsheet. 

usCitizenGen Thes-Ext. csv 

The United States of America,United States 

United states,United_States 

John Smith,John Smith 

America,United States 

USA,United States 


91 










3. Loading the files 

From the main menu select File => Import Text Files. Navigate to the directory 
where you placed johnSmith.txt and click Select. The file will appear in the main 
window. 

4. Applying the thesauri 

From the main menu select Preprocess => Apply Generalization Thesauri. 

Navigate to the directory where you placed countryThesauri.csv and click Select. 
The thesauri will be applied and a new text will appear in the window with the 
thesauri substitutions. Apply Thesauri (3) will now appear in the dropdown menu 
denoting AutoMap has applied the thesauri. 

Text after thesauri applied 

John_Smith lives in the United_States. He is a United_States 
citizen. 

Thesauri Editor 

AutoMap contains a Thesauri Editor making it easy to revise your thesauri files. 
From the dropdown menu select Tools => Thesauri Editor. 

From the Thesauri Editor menu select File => Open File. Navigate to the directory 
with your thesauri and click [Okay]. From the Thesauri Editor you can make 
changes to the thesauri. 

Questions regarding Thesauri 
Different Thesauri for different purposes 

You might initially think it's necessary to keep all the thesauri entries in one place. 
Just easier to find everything. But it essence it would make it easier to keep track 
by splitting up the thesauri into smaller files, each with it's own purpose. Below are 
some of the specialty thesauri used in this lesson. 

You might have a general countries thesauri that is always used to fix multiple ways 
of posting a country. The U.S. can be listed in a multitude of ways: 

U.S., America, United States, The United States of America 

A country thesauri could have all these permutations listed and convert them all to 
the same concept say, united states. So instead of four individual concepts you 
would have one. 

U.S.,United_States 
America,United States 
United states,United States 


92 


The United States of America,United States 

If your project concentrates on a particular field you could have a thesauri that 
contains names of organizations, resources, or people's names which appear with 
regularity. 

Analysts working on a similar subject every day would need the same names, 
places, and resource for each run. A special thesauri could take care of that and 
would be easier to maintain as a single file. 

Is the thesaurus case-specific? 

NO! If there are two or more entries for the same concept the first thesaurus entry 
will be used for all replacements. 


HE,Tom 
He,Dick 
he,Harry 


Every instance of HE, He, and he will be replaced with Tom without comparing 
their case. 

Running the Delete List Before or After the Thesauri 

You may also find it necessary to run a Delete List on your files. Whether you apply 
a delete list before or after applying a generalization thesauri will depend on your 
set of files. A longer discussion can be found in the Content section under Process 
Sequencing. 

Using of one large thesauri vs. multiple smaller thesauri 

This will be a personal choice of the user. Multiple thesauri have the advantage of 
easier editing but the downside is needing to apply multiple thesauri to the same 
set of files. 

NOTE : When doing multiple runs on the same data some analysts prefer to 
maintain a single thesaurus. 

NOTE : The Generalization Thesaurus is NOT case sensitive to what it finds in the 
text. United States, United states, and united States are all considered the same bi¬ 
gram and would be replaced with the same entry. 


23 SEP 09 



Compare Concept Lists 


93 










Description 


Compares two Concept Lists and displays concepts that appear in either both files 
(white background) or in a single file (red or green background). The viewer is 
called from the pull-down menu by selecting Tools => Concept List Viewer. 

Load 

This example will use a Concept List created with a raw file and a Concept List 
created after applying a thesaurus. This will be used to demonstrate how the viewer 
detects frequency differences. 

tmbg.txt 

John Flansburgh and John Linnell are musicians. John and John 
are the group They Might Be Giants. 

The tmbg's file is loaded into AutoMap with File => Import Text Files and a 
Concept List is created Generate => Concept List => Concept List (Per Text). 
This Concept List is then loaded into AutoMap with Tools => Concept List 
Viewer. 

NOTE : Notice the concept John has a frequency of 4. 



Close the Concept List Viewer. 

Go to the directory where your Concept List is saved and rename it tmbg- 
noThes.csv. This will prevent AutoMap from overwritting the file. 

Apply the generalization thesaurus tmbg-genThes.csv file with Preprocess => 
Apply Generalization Thesauri. 


94 
























tmbg-genThes.csv 

John Flansburgh,John Flansburgh 
John Linnell,John Linnell 

They Might Be Giants,They Might Be Giants 


Create a Concept List with Generate => Concept List => Concept List (Per 
Text). This Concept List, named tmbg.csv, will be used as the compare file. 

Comparing the two files 

Start the Concept List Viewer with Tools => Concept List Viewer. Load the first 
Concept List with File => Open File and navigate to the directory containing the 
tmbg-noThes.csv (the file without the thesaurus applied). Next we will compare this 
with the second file. From the pull-down menu select Edit => Compare File and 
navigate to the direcoty containing tmbg.csv (the file with the thesaurus applied). 



The concepts with white backgrounds are found in both files. The concepts with red 
backgrounds are found only in the original file. The concepts in green are found 
only in the newly compared file. 

The cells with the yellow backgrounds are concepts found in both files (e.g. 
concepts on white backgrounds) but they have different values. Notice on the 
image below the arrow hovering over the frequency value for John. In the original 
file John had a value of 4 . The tooltip displays a value of 2 which is the value in the 
compared file. 


95 













































Message Log Window 

After making a comparison AutoMap will display the statistics of the comparison in 
the Message Log Window. It will display added (green), deleted (red), and altered 
(yellow). 


08 SEP 09 



The Compare File functions is implemented in many of the tools: Delete List 
Editor, Thesauri Editor, Concept List Viewer, and Table Viewer. It will 
compare the currently loaded file with a second file on disk and display if an entry is 
contained in both files (white background), originally loaded file (red background), 
or the compared file (green background). 

NOTE : The example uses thesauri files but the color coding is identical across all 
the included tools. 

The Files 

Below are the files used in this lesson. They can be copied and saved and used for 
your examples. Be sure to save them in the .csv format.

Comparing a sub-set file 

From the editor pull-down menu select File => Compare Files. Select the file 
a.csv. This file contains a single concept from the original abc.csv file. 



The line a,alpha in white shows this concept is found in both files. The next two 
lines b,beta; c,charlie show these concepts are found in the original file but not in 
the compared file. 

Compare to an exclusive file 

From the pull-down menu select File => Compare Files and select the file 
xyz.csv. The xyz.csv file contains no concepts that are found in the abc.csv file. 



The green lines for x,x-ray; y,yankee; z,zulu show these concepts are only found 
in the new file. The red lines for a,alpha; b,beta; c,charlie show these concepts 
were found in the original file but are absent from the compared file.

Different values 


From the pull-down menu select File => Compare Files and select the file a- 
caps.csv. The compared file contains only one similar term to the original file but 
the key_concept is different. 

There will be times when the same concept has different values in each file. This is 
defined by a yellow background. The value will display what is in the original file. By 
hovering over the cell it will display in a tooltip the value contained in the compared 
file. 



A Mixed Thesaurus 

The most common comparison will be a mixture of terms that appear, or are 
missing from, each file. 

From the pull-down menu select File => Compare Files and select the file az.csv. 
This file contains all the concepts from the abc.csv plus three additional concepts. 



The white line for a,alpha shows this concept was found in both the original and 
compared files. The red lines b,beta; c,charlie show these concepts were found in 
the original file but not the compared file. The green line z,zulu shows this concept 
exists only in the compared file. 


21 AUG 09 



Remove Items 


Description 

Removing unwanted, or unneeded, items is important to reduce the amount of data 
to analyze. This include white space, punctuation, numbers and symbols. 


98 



























Remove Extra White Spaces 



In many texts there are extra white spaces inserted between words or before and 
after punctuation. This is partly a holdover from the days of the typewriter of 
double spacing after a period. But with proporional fonts it's now an unnecessary 
practice. AutoMap finds instances of multiple spaces and replaces them a single 
space. Below is a text with varying number of white spaces between words. 

spaces.txt 


one space, two spaces, three spaces, four spaces. 

After AutoMap removes extra white spaces it's much easier to read. 

one space, two spaces, three spaces, four spaces. 



Remove Punctuation 


Punctuation is mainly for use in making sure the reader understands how the words 
are expressed. During analysis they are somewhat unnecessary as the words 
themselves are more important. The Remove Punctuation function removes the 
following punctuation from the text: "()!?-. AutoMap will remove the 

punctuation and either close up the sapce between or insert a white space as a 
placemarker. 

punctuation, txt 

"English" is hard (so very hard)!?! What's with all these 
commas (,), semi-colons (;), and colons (:). 

Removing Punctuation and inserting white space 

English is hard so very hard What s with all these 
commas semi colons and colons 

Removing Punctuation and NOT inserting white space 

English is hard so very hard Whats with all these commas 
semicolons and colons 



Remove Symbols 


Symbols are parts of language which are not concepts but assist in understanding 
the language. Occasionally these symbols need to be removed to make semantic 
networks and meta-networks better understood. 


99 


Removing the Default List of Symbols 


AutoMap has a default list of symbols that can be removed: 

~'@#$%' v &*_+ = {}[]\|/<>.

Remove Numbers 


Removing numbers will remove not only numbers as individual concepts but also 
removes numbers embedded within concepts. 


100 


Remove Options 

There are two options for removing numbers. 

1. Replacing the number(s) with a space 

2. Removing the number(s) and closing the distance between the letters before 
and after. 

Examples 

Remove numbers as individual concepts. 

buckleMyShoe. txt 

1 , 2, buckle my shoe! 3, 4, shut the door 

Text after RemoveNumber: 

, , buckle my shoe! , , shut the door. 

Numbers within other concepts and closing up distance.

Scripts can be created in AutoMap and saved or directly in the ScriptRunner GUI. 


101 










From AutoMap 

Import a text file in AutoMap. For this lesson I'll be using Julius Caesar's Act 4 act 

l.txt. Now either press the Quick Launch Delete List button or select 
PreProcess > Apply Delete List and apply a Delete List. For the Delete List I'll 

use juliusCaesar_DL.txt. 

When AutoMap is finished processing select from the menu File > Save Script 
File. Navigate to a directory to save your script. 

Start the ScriptRunner by selecting from the menu Tools > ScriptRunner. 

NOTE : If you don't have the newset .NET installed you will get a .NET Framework 
error. Just press OK - it will start. 

First you need to create a temp directory to store processing results. It also 
contains all the files ScriptRunner generates. The temp directory differs from the 
Output directory as the temp directory is where AM3 stores it's work file. Output 
directories are created by AM3 on an individual basis for each type of output 
generated. 

From the main menu select File > Load Script File. Navigate to the directory 
where the file just created was saved, select it, and click OK. 

Click the Parameters tab and review the procedures from the loaded script. You will 
see one line containing the parameters of the file to use: 

tempWorkSpace : Displays the pathway for ScriptRunner's work area. 

textDirection : LT, RT, LB, RB 

textDirectory : The pathway to the file(s) loaded. 

textEncoding : Displays how ScriptRunner will load the file. In our example 
this is autoDetect 

Click the Preprocessing tab. You will see the one process performed from 
AutoMap, Apply Delete List. In this simple script this is the only item under the 
Preprocessing tab. 

adjacency : Value can be r - rhetoric or d - direct. 

deleteListLocation : Display the pathway for the Delete List. This pathway 
shows where the Delete List resides when we created the script in AutoMap. 

inputDirectory : Allows you to specify a different directory to use to for your 
input files. Useful if you want to test something on a subset of files. When 


102 


using a script created in AutoMap this does not have to be filled in. 
ScriptRunner will use the directory used by AutoMap. 

NOTE : If you designate an input directory that doesn't exist the script will fail and 
you will see the dialog box with the little bomb. 

outputDirectory : Allows you to change the final destination for output files 
written. When using a script created in AutoMap this does not have to be filled 
in. ScriptRunner will use the directory used by AutoMap. 

NOTE : If creating a script in ScriptRunner then you will have to specify these two 
directories else you might not know where your files are being written. AM3 won't 
create directories for you. It will only browse. This makes you decide where you 
want to store the results. 

For some reason you may want to either remind yourself of some fact about this 
Delete list or tell a new user something they may need to know. You can insert a 
comment or print a message. 



Display Message : The message typed in the text box will be displayed in 
a dialog box when the script is run. Primarily used to send a message to 
the user. 



Insert Comment : Usually used to annotate the script. Primarily used to 
remind the creator of the script the purpose of any particular action. 


Insert a Comment does not display anything on screen. It is for you to annotate 
what you did. When other people open your script they won't have to guess why 
you chose to do a certain action. It's also helpful when you come back to a script to 
jog your memory as to your reasons for how it was constructed. 

When creating more complicated scripts you can drag and drop any of the buttons 
to the canvas to add items. You can also delete any item by clicking the Red X. You 
can also modify the order of the items however you want. 


103 



Above shows how to place a message that will be displayed in a dialog box for the 
user. You can type whatever you want displayed in the text box. 

NOTE : Yes could also drag-and-drop a second Delete List as duplicate processes 
can be executed twice in a row. This is usually done when you have multiple Delete 
Lists for specific purposes. 

Running External Programs 

Used to extend ScriptRunner's usage by running other applications (i.e. 

@ the NotePad application). Primarily used if you need to adjust some data 
or result before allowing the script to proceed. 


Add New Programs 


Fills in the pathway to the program and also inserts a new button at the 
bottom of the quick launch pane. 


104 





























NOTE : This function requires you have NET Framework 4.0 installed. If not 
installed then pressing the button will have no effect. 



Working with Large Thesauri 


Description 

When working with a large amount of documents, each one being large themselves, 
you will find your thesauri growing increasing large. There are several items which 
you should be aware of in this circumstance. 

The Order of the Thesaurus 

The order of the thesaurus entries can have an impact on your results. Better 
results will be obtained if the thesaurus is in a descending length order. 

The Sort Thesaurus function can assist in ordering your thesauri. From the pull¬ 
down menu select Procedures => Sort Thesaurus. Navigate to the thesaurus 
you want to sort. Then give it a new name, and if you want, a new location and 
save it. 

The Sort Thesaurus functions sorts by number of words in an entry. The order of 
entries with the same number of words will not change. 

See The AutoMap GUI > Procedures Menu for more information 

Conflicts in Data 

A problem can occur when you have more than one agent or location with the same 
name. In the beginning the text may specifically refer to John Smith and John 
Doe but afterwards you might find that a person is only referred to as John. 
AutoMap will use the first occurrence of John it finds when making substitutions. 

AutoMap processes a thesaurus from top to bottom. This is why it's important to 
sort a thesaurus by the length of the entries. 

Sequence of Operations 

Mohammed abd al-Sha'bai 

This name contains both punctuation and symbols. Depending on the order of the 
preprocessing you could end up with any of the following three: 

Mohammed abd al Sha bai 
Mohammed abd al-Sha'bai 
Mohammed abd alShabai 


105 










How General Is Too General? 


If you start with a 2,000 page text set, you will probably be unable to read all of 
the text prior to starting the processing. One of the problems you may encounter in 
such situations relates to common names and terms. For example, a preliminary 
review of the text may reveal that the documents contain an individual named Joe. 
Given that this is very common name, the data may contain several other 
individuals named Joe. Should this occur the program will incorrectly process all 
Joes as if they were the first Joe. Users need to exhibit caution before including 
common names and common terms in their thesauri. 

If your text contains two names, Joe smith and Joe Jones and a thesaurus entry 
for the name Joe then AutoMap will substitute all Joes for the first entry in the 
thesaurus. 

Using the ThesauriContentOnly option 

You create a Meta-Network (Carley, 200) with the one-grams dog, cow, and farm. 
If you are going to use the UseThesauriContentOnly option then those three 
terms need to be in your General Thesaurus also. If they are not in the thesaurus 
then they will be eliminated from the output and the Meta-Network will not see 
them to tag them. 

Positive or Negative Links 

AutoMap creates links between nodes. But AutoMap does not differentiate between 
positive and negative links. After processing that is up to the analyst. 

The U.S. lacks formal diplomatic relations with North Korea, 
Bhutan, and Cuba, but has close relationships with Canada and 
the U.K. 

Using a large window will create a fully connected graph with all links the same 
type. It will also make connections for all the countries involved. The reality is that 
there should be positive links to Canada and the U.K. and negative links to North 
Korea, Bhutan, and Cuba. 

Using a small window size would create a link set that is wrong: 

US => North Korea => Bhutan => Cuba => Canada => UK 

right: 

negative links: US => North Korea; US => Bhutan; US => Cuba 
positive links: US => Canada; US => UK

Extracting a Semantic Network 


Description 

Text files have connections but they are sometimes difficult to see. You can use 
AutoMap and process them to create semantic networks which can be viewed in 
ORA. 

This lesson details processing text files in AutoMap to extract a Semantic Network, 
how to view it in ORA. Other lessons will detail specific reports that can prove 
useful. 

What is a Semantic Network? 

Semantic networks are knowledge representation schemes involving nodes and 
links between nodes. It is a way of representing relationships between concepts. 
The nodes represent concepts and the links represent relations between nodes. The 
links are directed and labeled; thus, a semantic network is a directed graph. 

Procedure 

This lesson will use the file: JC_summary-l.txt. 

Load text document into AutoMap 

Place all the text files for conversion into a single folder. From the Pull Down Menu 
select File => Import Text Files. The first text will be displayed in the main 
window and the filename will appear in the Filename Box. Using the File Navigation 
Buttons you can navigate through the loaded files. 

Build a General Thesauri 

Many people, places and things are made up of two or more words. For example 
Julius Caesar, Brutus's House, status of Caesar. Before producing any files usable in 
ORA it's necessary to combine these multi-word concepts into key concepts. 

NOTE : Some concepts include the definite article in their name and should be 
included in the thesaurus. 

If you have no previous thesaurus then one will need to be created from scratch. 
This will require going through the text files and finding those multi-word concepts 
and creating a list of key concepts. The format for this is multi word 
concept, key_concept. 


107 










NOTE : Be sure NOT to leave any spaces before or after the comma. 

Below is part of the Generalization Thesaurus that is used for this lesson. It 
contains concepts from the Julius Caesar text. 

juliusCaesar-Gen Thes. csv 

Ides of March,Ides of March 
Julius Caesar,Julius_Caesar 
Julius Caesar's,Julius_Caesar 

Julius Caesar's status,statue_of_Julius_Caesar 

kill Caesar,kill Caesar 

kills herself,commit suicide 

king,emperor 

letter,forged_letters 

Apply a General Thesauri 

After the thesaurus is created it is time to apply it to the text. From the Pull Down 
Menu select Preprocess => Apply Generalization Thesauri. Navigate to the 
directory where the thesauri is saved and click [Select]. Next a dialog box will 
appears asking if you want to use Thesaurus Content Only. Leave the response 

as No. 

See Content => Thesaurus Content Only for more information. 

Notes about Thesaurus Building: 

1. In large texts there may be multiple person with the same first 
name. 

2. The definite article in the concept like the USDA would be placed 
in the Thesaurus instead of being deleted in the Delete List. 


Create the Concept Lists 

Next we need to create a Delete List. One way is to first create a Concept List and 
use this to help in creating a Delete List. The frequency attribute will assist in 
finding unneeded and unwanted terms. 

From the main menu select Generate => Concept List => Concept List (Per 
Text). Navigate to the directory to save the files and click [Select]. AutoMap will 
ask if you want to create a Union Concept List. Click [No] as you only have one 
file loaded. 

NOTE : With multiple files loaded you would select Generate => Concept List => 
Concept List (Union Only). This creates one list for all files currently loaded. 

Build a Delete List 

Open the Concept List Viewer by selecting Tools => Concept List Viewer. From 
the viewer menu select File => Open File. Now navigate to the directory 
containing the newly created Concept List and click [OK]. 


108 



Click the header Frequency. This will sort the concepts by the number of 
occurrences in the file(s). To build a Delete List place a check mark in the Selected 
column for all the concepts you wish to place in the Delete List. When you are 
finished select File => Save Delete List. Navigate to the folder you want to save 
the Delete List file. Close the Viewer. 

Apply a Delete List 

From the main menu select Preprocess => Apply Delete List. Navigate to the 
directory with your newly created file and click [OK]. You will be asked whether 
you want Rhetorical (replaces deleted concepts with a placeholder xxx) or Direct 
(removes the concept entirely) adjacency. For this lesson I choose rhetorical. 

NOTE : The placeholder xxx will not output to the DyNetML file as a concept. 

Create a DyNetML file 

Now it's time to generate the DyNetML. From the Pull Down Menu select Generate 
= > Concept List => Concept Network (Per Text) for separate DyNetML files or 
Generate => Concept List => Concept Network (Union Only) to create one 
file with concepts from all files. AutoMap will output XML file(s) usable directly in 
ORA. You will directed to select the destination folder for these file(s). 

NOTE : When processing multiple files and selecting the Per Text function 
AutoMap will ask if you want to create a Union of all Semantic Network files. 

The DyNetML file(s) will contain one NodeClass of Concepts. After loading into ORA 
Nodes can be separated into individual NodeClasses and links can be created to 
form Networks.

Description 


All of AutoMap's functions can be accessed through the script. The two required 
files are the AM3Script (The AutoMap program) and a .config file (designed by the 
user). Additional files could include Delete Lists, Thesauri, or other list files 
necessary by the program. 

Create a Workspace 

A good starting point is creating a project directory, a place where all your input 
(your text files), output (files AutoMap writes), and support (required files by 
certain functions) files will reside. This helps prevent files from getting lost. One 


109 










suggestion is to create a top level project directory then create input, output, and 
support directories within that directory. 


C:\My Documents\dave\project\input 
C:\My Documents\dave\project\output 
C:\My Documents\dave\project\support 

The .config file 

Find the blank .config file in the AutoMap directory and make a copy. Rename this 
to something regarding your project. Open it in your text editor to begin editing the 
file. The blank .config file will appear as below. 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 

<Script> 

<Settings> 

AutoMap textDirectory="" tempWorkspace="" textEncoding=""/> 

</Settings> 

<Utilities> 

<PreProcessing> 

</PreProcessing> 

<Processing> 

</Processing> 

<PostProcessing> 

</PostProcessing> 

</Utilities> 

</Script> 

Initial Setup 

The first thing to do is tell AutoMap where your input files are and where you want 
the output files to be written. 

<Settings> 

AutoMap textDirectory="C:\My Documents\dave\project\input" 
tempWorkspace="C:\My Documents\dave\project\output" 
textEncoding="" /> 

</Settings> 

Preprocessing Functions 

Now decide which functions of AutoMap you need to run on your files. These are 
divided into three areas: Preprocessing, Processing, and Postprocessing. 
Review the documentation on the various functions to decide which functions you 
need to run on your text. 


110 


A Generalization Thesaurus 


Usually a Generalization Thesaurus is the first file to create. This can be done in 
either a text editor or spreadsheet. Create a list of single/multi word concepts from 
the text and the key concepts they should be translated to. 

In a text editor create each pair on a single line separated by a comma. Make sure 
to NOT leave a space between the comma and the two items. 

United States of America,United_States_of_America 

Save this file as a .csv file. 

In a spreadsheet program place the single/multi word concept in the first column 
and the key concept in the second column. 


MM 

MM 

United States of America 

United States of America 


Save this file as a .csv file. 

In your project .config file in the Preprocessing section insert the command for 
applying a Generalization Thesaurus. Place the pathway to the newly created 
thesaurus in the thesauriLocation parameter and choose whether to use the 

thesauriContentOnly option. 

NOTE : thesauriContentOnly is set to y (put only concepts from the thesaurus in 
the output file) or n (use all concepts form the text files). 

<PreProcessing> 

Generalization thesauriLocation="C:\My 
Documents\dave\proj ect\support\thesauri.csv" 
useThesauriContentOnly="y" /> 

</PreProcessing> 


Save the file. 

A Delete List 

After all the key concepts have been identified it's time to find the unneeded and 
unwanted concepts. A Delete List removes these concepts and reduces the overall 
number of concepts to analyze. The procedure for applying a Delete List is similar 
to applying a thesaurus. 

In a text editor create a list of concepts to be removed from the text. Each line 
should contain only one concept which consists of a single word. There should be no 
extra spaces or punctuation included. 


Ill 









and 

the 

but 


Save this file as a .csv file. 

In a spreadsheet program place each concept to delete in a single cell in the first 
column 



Save this file as a .csv file. 

In your project .config file in the Preprocessing section insert the command for 
applying a Delete List. Put the pathway to the newly created Delete List in the 
deleteListLocation parameter and choose whether to use the saveTexts option. 

<PreProcessing> 

Generalization thesauriLocation="C:\My 
Documents\dave\proj ect\support\thesauri.csv" 
useThesauriContentOnly="y" /> 

<DeleteList adjacency="r" deleteListLocation="C:\My 
Documents\dave\project\support\deleteList.txt" saveTexts="y"/> 
</PreProcessing> 


Save the file. 

Other Preprocessing Functions 

Any number of the preprocessing functions can be included in the script file in 
whatever order you need them. Insert the commands within the < Preprocessing 
tags in the order you need them performed. 

NOTE : am3script will perform these function in the order they are placed in the 
script. Make sure you know what order you need to perform each task. 

Processing Functions 

Next thing to consider are the steps to take after the preprocessing is finished. 
These include most of the functions that output files and are based on the text after 
preprocessing. To run a Processing function the command is placed between the 

<Processing> tags. 


112 











Processing functions with no parameters 

Processing functions which take no parameters include Anaphora, ConceptList, 
UnionConceptList, and NGramExtraction. Placing these tags between the 
<Processing> tags automatically performs these functions in the order that order. 


<Processing> 

<ConceptList /> 

<UnionConceptList /> 

</Processing> 

Processing functions with parameters 

All other Processing functions require parameters to set for successful completion. 
This is either the location of a support file or parameters necessary to complete the 
function. The parameters follow the tag and are separated by a space and the value 
is enclosed in quotes. 


<Processing> 

<SemanticNetworkList directional="U" resetNumber="1" 
textUnit="S" windowsize="5" /> 

</Processing> 


If a tag requires a file to work then the pathway needs to be placed in the location 
parameter. An incorrect pathway will cause the AutoMap function to fail. 

<Processing> 

<Meta-Network thesauriLocation="C:\My 
Documents\dave\project\support\thesauri.csv" /> 

</Processing> 

Postprocessing Functions 

The last step is to determine which, if any, postprocessing functions are needed. 
These are used to alter the DyNetML before running in ORA. They include 
addAttribute, addAttribute3Col, and UnionDynetml. The addAttribute and 
addAttribute3Col both take an external file with a list of attributes to add. The 
UnionDynetml requires the unionType to create either a s semantic or m Meta- 
Network (Carley, 2002) output file. 

<PostProcessing> 

<addAttribute attributeFile="C:\My 

Documents\dave\project\support\attribute.csv" /> 

<unionDynetml unionType="s" /> 

</PostProcessing> 


Output files will be written to the designated output directory. 


113 


Running the Script 

After all the Preprocessing and Processing tags are completed the script can now be 
run. 

Open a Command Window from the Start menu and navigate to the directory 
containing AM3Script. Move your .config file to this directory. At the command 
prompt type am3script project.config. Am3script will execute using the .config 
specified. Output files will be found in the directory specified in the tempWorkspace 
parameter. 

<Settings> 

AutoMap textDirectory="" tempWorkspace="" textEncoding=""/> 

</Settings> 

NOTE : Be sure to leave a space between am3script and the name of your config 
file.
