1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: A, 
B, C, D, E, cind L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class to 
which it belongs. Class A, C, D, cind E tests are executcdile. Class B and 
class L tests are expected to produce errors at conpile time and link time, 
respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result when they 
are executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, 
and the procedure CHECK FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT 
also provides a set of Identity functions used to defeat some compiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a coitpiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the conpiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada inplementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately compiled units. Errors 
are expected at link time, and execution is attenpted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values — for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this inpleraentation is provided in Appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and 
implementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this implementation are described in section 2.3. 


1-2 





INTRODUCTIC^J 


For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by the 
AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications described in 
the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see section 2.1), and 
possibly removing some inapplicable tests (see section 2.2 and tUG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada inplementation must process each test of 
the customized test suite according to the Ada Steuidard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are irrelevant 
for a given Ada implementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may 
be supported by documents issued by the ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and consnonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Commentaries are included as 
appropriate. 


2-1 





IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


The following 201 tests have floating-point type declarations 
requiring more digits than SYSTEM.MAX_DIGITS: 


C24113L..Y (14 tests) 
C35706L..Y (14 tests) 
C35708L..Y (14 tests) 
C45241L..Y (14 tests) 
C45421L..Y (14 tests) 
C45524L..Z (15 tests) 
C45641L..Y (14 tests) 


C35705L..Y (14 tests) 
C35707L..Y (14 tests) 
C35802L..Z (15 tests) 
C45321L..Y (14 tests) 
C45521L..Z (15 tests) 
C45621L..Z (15 tests) 
C46012L..Z (15 tests) 


C35713B, C45423B, B86001T, and C86006H chec)c for the predefined type 
SHORT_FLCiAT; for this implementation, there is no such type. 

C35713C, B86001U, 2 uid C86006G check for the predefined type 
LCX4G_FLQAT; for this implementation, there is no such type. 

C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with a 
name other than FLOAT, LONG_FLQAT, or SHORT_FLQAT; for this 
implementation, there is no such type. 

A35801E checks that FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST may be used as a range 
constraint in a floating-point type declaration; for this 
implementation, that range exceeds the reinge of safe numbers of the 
largest predefined floating-point type and must be rejected. (See 
section 2.3.) 


C45423A, C45523A, and C45622A check that the proper exception is 
raised if MACHINE_OVERFLOWS is TRUE and the results of various 
floating-point operations lie outside the range of the base type; for 
this inplementation, MACHINE_OVERFIvOWS is FALSE. 

C45531M..P emd C45532M..P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations for 
types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or greater; for this 
implementation, MAXJIANTISSA is less than 47. 

B86001Y uses the name of a predefined fixed-point type other than type 
DURATION; for this implementation, there is no such type. 

CA2009C and CA2009F check v^ether a generic unit can be instantiated 
before its body (and any of its subunits) is compiled; this 
implementation creates a dependence on generic units as allowed by 
AI-00408 and Al-00506 such that the compilation of the generic unit 
bodies makes the instantiating units obsolete. (See section 2.3.) 

LA3004A..B, EA3004C..D, and CA3004E..F (6 tests) check pragma INLINE 
for procedures and functions; this implementation does not support 
pragma INLINE. 

GD1009C checks whether a length clause can specify a non-default size 
for a floating-point type; this implementation does not support such 
sizes. 


2-2 





IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


CD2A84A, CT)2a84e, a)2A84l..J (2 tests), eind CD2A840 use length clauses 
to specify non-default sizes for access types; this implementation 
does not support such sizes. 

BD8001A, BD8003A, BD8004A..B (2 tests), and AD8011A use machine code 
insertions; this implementation provides no pac)cage MACHINE_CODE. 

AE2101C cind EE2201D..E (2 tests) use instantiations of package 
SEQUEOTIAL_IO with unconstrained array types and record types with 
discriminants without defaults; these instantiations are rejected by 
this compiler. 

AE2101H, EE2401D, and EE2401G use insteintiations of package DIRECT_IO 
with unconstrained array types and record types with discriminants 
without defaults; these instantiations are rejected by this compiler. 

The tests listed in the following teible check that USE_ERROR is raised 
if the given file operations are not supported for the given 
combination of mode and access method; this implementation supports 
these operations.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


CE2203A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of cin 
external sequential file is exceeded; this implementation cannot 
restrict file capacity. 

CE2403A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of an 
external direct file is exceeded; this implementation ceuinot restrict 
file capacity. 

CE3304A checks that SET_LINE^LENGTH and SET_PAGE_LENGTH raise 
USE_ERROR if they specify an Tnappropriate value for the external 
file; there are no inappropriate values for this implementation. 

CE3413B checks that PAGE raises LAYOUT ERROR when the value of the 
page number exceeds COUNT'LAST; for this Tirplementation, the value of 
COUNT'LAST is greater than 150000, making the checking of this 
objective impractical. 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for nine tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
inplementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the 
way expected by the original tests. 

B22003A B83033A B85013D 

A35801E was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by 
the AVO. The compiler rejects the use of the range 
FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST as the range constraint of a floating-point type 
declaration because the bounds lie outside of the range of safe numbers 
(cf. LRM 3.5.7:12). 

EA1003B was graded passed by Processing Modification as directed by the 
AVO. This test checks \diether legal vinits of a compilation are accepted 
if one of the compilation units is illegal. This test was processed with 
the compiler option "-fl", vdiich forces the compiler to generate code for 
legal units of a compilation. 

cy^009C and CA2009F were graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as 
directed by the AVO. These tests contain instantiations of a generic mit 
prior to the compilation of that unit's body; as allowed by Al-00408 and 
AI-00506, the compilation of the generic unit bodies makes the compilation 
unit that contains the insteintiations obsolete. 

BC3204C amd BC3205D were graded passed by Processing Modification as 
directed by the AVO. These tests check that instantiations of generic 
units with unconstrained types as generic actual parameters are illegal if 
the generic bodies contain uses of the types that require a constraint. 
However, the generic bodies are compiled after the units that contain the 
instantiations, auid this implementation creates a dependence of the

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


instcuitiating units on the generic lonits as allowed by AI-00408 and 
AI-00506 such that the compilation of the generic bodies makes the 
instantiating units obsolete—no errors are detected. The processing of 
these tests was modified by re-compiling the obsolete units; all intended 
errors were then detected by the conpiler.

PROCESSING INFORMATION 


3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Inplenventation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming 
Language Standard, v^ether the test is applicable or inapplicable; 
otherwise, the Ada Implementation fails the ACVC [Pro90). 

For all processed tests (inapplicaible and applicable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard. 

The list of items below gives the number of ACVC tests in various 
categories. All tests were processed, except those that were withdrawn 
because of test errors (item b; see section 2.1), those that require a 
floating-point precision that exceeds the implementation's m 2 uciinum 
precision (item e; see section 2.2), and those that depend on the support 
of a file system — if none is supported (item d). All tests passed, 
except those that are listed in sections 2.1 and 2.2 (counted in items b 
cutid f, below). 


a) Total Number of ^plicable Tests 3786 

b) Total Number of Withdrawn Tests 95 

c) Processed Inapplicable Tests 88 

d) Non-Processed I/O Tests 0 

e) Non-Processed Floating-Point 

Precision Tests 201 

f) Total Number of Inapplicable Tests 289 (c+d+e) 

g) Total Number of Tests for ACVC 1.11 4170 (a+b+f) 


3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were loaded directly onto the host computer. 


After the test files were loaded onto the host con^niter, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 


Testing was performed using commcind scripts provided by the customer and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a complete listing of 
the processing options for this implementation. It also indicates the 
default options. The options invoked explicitly for validation testing 
during this test were; 

Switch Effect 

-fE Generate error file for the Ada listing utility.

PROCESSING INFORMATION 


-fl Ignore conipilation errors and continue generating 

code for legal units within the same compilation file 
(for test EA1003B). 

-fQ Suppress "added to library" and "Generating code for" 

information messages. 

-fw Suppress informative warning messages. 

-c Produce continuous form Ada listings (no page headers). 

-p Ctoey PRAO^ PAGE directives within program even though 

the -c flag says not to generate page breaks. 

-s Output Ada listing to the standard output file instead 

of to a disk file. 


Test output, conpiler and linker listings, and job logs were captured on 
magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. nfie listings examined on-site by 
the validation team were also archived.

APPENDIX A 


MACRO PARAMETERS 


This appendix contains the macro parameters used for customizing the ACVC. 
The meaning and purpose of these parameters are explained in tUG89]. The 
parameter values are presented in two tables. The first table lists the 
values that are defined in terms of the maximum input-line length, which is 
the value for $MAX_IN_LEN—also listed here. These values are expressed 
here as Ada string aggregates, v^ere "V" represents the maximum input-line 
length.

APPENDIX B 


COMPILATIC»I SYSTEM OPTIONS 


The compiler options of this Ada implementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to compiler documentation euid 
not to this report. 


MERIDIAN ADA COMPILER OPTIONS 


-fD Generate debugging output. The -fD option causes the 
compiler to generate the appropriate code and data for 
operation with the Meridian Ada Debugger. 

-fe Annotate assembly language listing. The -fe option 
causes the compiler to cinnotate an assembly language 
output file. The output is supplemented by comments 
containing the Ada source statements corresponding to the 
assembly language code sections written by the code 
generator. To use this option, the -S option must also 
be specified, otherwise the annotated file is not emitted. 

-fE Generate error log file. The -fE option causes the 

compiler to generate a log file containing all the error 
messages and warning messages produced during compilation. 
The error log file has the same name as the source file, 
with the extension .err. For example, the error log file 
for simple.ada is simple.err. The error log file is 
placed in the current working directory. In the absence 
of the -fE option, the error log information is sent to 
the standard output streaim. 

-fl Ignore compilation errors and continue generating code 
for legal units within the same compilation file. 

-fL Generate exception location information. The -fL option 
causes location information (source file names and line 
numbers) to be maintained for internal checks. This 
information is useful for debugging in the event that ein 


B-1 






COMPILATICW SYSTEM OPTIONS 


"Exception never handled" message appears when ein 
exception propagates out of the main program. This flag 
causes the code to be somewhat larger. If -fL is not 
used, exceptions that propagate out of the main program 
will behave in the same way, but no location information 
will be printed with the "Exception never handled" 
message. 

-fN Suppress numeric checking. The -fN flag suppresses two 
kinds of numeric checks for the entire compilation: 
division check and overflow check. These checks are 
described in section 11.7 oT the LRM. This flag reduces 
the size of the code. 

-fQ Suppress "added to library" and "Generating code for" 
information messages normally output by the compiler. 

-fs Suppress all checks. The -fs flag suppresses all 

automatic checking, including numeric checking. This 
flag is equivalent to using pragma suppress on all checks. 
This flag reduces the size of the code, and is good for 
producing "production quality" code or for benchmarking 
the compiler. Note that there is a related ada option, 

-fN to suppress only certain kinds of numeric checks. 

-fU Inhibit library update. The -fU option inhibits library 
updates. This is of use in conjunction with the -S 
option. Certain restrictions apply to use of this option. 

-fv Compile verbosely. The compiler prints the name of each 
subprogram, package, or generic as it is compiled. 
Information about the symbol table space remaining 
following conpilation of the named entity is also printed 
in the form "[nK]". 

-fw Suppress warning messages. With this option, the 

compiler does not print warning messages about ignored 
pragmas, exceptions that are certain to be raised at 
run-time, or other potential problems that the compiler 
is otherwise forbidden to deem as errors by the LRM. 

-g The -g option instructs the compiler to run an additional 
optimization pass. The optimizer removes common 
sub-expressions, dead code and unnecessary junps. It 
also does loop optimizations. 

-K Keep internal form file. This option is used in 

conjunction with the Optimizer. Without this option, the 
compiler deletes internal form files following code 
generation. 

-Imodifiers 

Generate listing file. The -1 option causes the conpiler 
to create a listing. Optional modifiers can be given to 


B-2 





COMPILATICN SYSTEM OPTICWS 


affect the listing format. You can use none or any 
combination of the following modifiers: 

c Use continuous listing format. The listing by 

default contains a header on each page. Specifying 
-Ic suppresses both pagination and header output, 
producing a continuous listing. 

p Obey pragma page directives. Specifying -Ip is only 
meaningful if -Ic has also been given. Normally -Ic 
suppresses all pagination, whereas -Icp suppresses 
all pagination except where explicitly called for 
within the source file with a pragma page directive. 

s Use stcindard output. The listing by default is 
written to a file with the same name as the source 
file and the extension .1st, as in simple.1st from 
simple.ada. Specifying -Is causes the listing file 
to be written to the standard output stream instead, 

t Generate relevant text output only. The listing by 
default contains the entire source program as well 
as interspersed error messages and warning messages. 
Specifying -It causes the compiler to list only the 
source lines to vhich error messages or warning 
messages apply, followed by the messages themselves. 

The default listing file generated has the same name as 
the source file, with the extension .1st. For example, 
the default listing file produced for simple.ada has the 
name sinple.lst. The listing file is placed in the 
current working directory. Note: -1 also causes an 
error log file to be produced, as with the -fE option. 

L library-neime 

Default: ada.lib 

Use alternate library. The -L option specifies an 
alternative name for the program library. 

N No compile. This option causes the ada command to do a 
"dry run" of the compilation process. The command 
invoked for each processing step is printed. This is 
similar to the -P option, but no actual processing is 
performed. 

P Print compile. This option causes the ada command to 

print out the command invoked for each processing step 
as it is performed. 

S Produce assembly code. Causes the code generator to 
produce an assembly language source file and to halt 
further processing.

COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


LINKER OPTIONS 

The linker options of this Ada inplementation, as described in this 
i^)pendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to linker documentation and not 
to this report. 


MERIDIAN ADA LINKER OPTIONS 


-A Aggressively inline. This option instructs the optimizer 
to aggressively inline subprograms when used in addition 
to the -G option. Typically, this means that subprograms 
that are only called once are inlined. If only the -G 
option is used, only subprograms for which pragma inline 
has been specified are inlined. 

-c compiler-program-name 

Default; (as stored in program library) 

Use alternate compiler. The -c option specifies the 
conplete (non relative) directory path to the Meridian 
Ada compiler. This option overrides the compiler 
program name stored in the program library. The -c 
option is intended for use in cross-compiler 
configurations, although under such circumstances, an 
appropriate library configuration is normally used 
instead. 

-f Suppress main program generation step. The -f option 
suppresses the creation and additional code generation 
steps for the temporary main program file. The -f option 
can be used when a simple chcinge has been made to the 
body of a compilation unit. If unit elaboration order 
is changed, or if the specification of a unit is changed, 
or if new units are added, then this option should not be 
used. 

-g Perform global optimization only. The -g option causes 

bamp to invoke the global optimizer on your program. 
Compilation units to be optimized globally must have been 
compiled with the ada -K option. 

-G Perform global and local optimization. The -G option 

causes bamp to perform both global and local optimization 
on your program. This includes performing pragma inline. 
As with the -g option, compilation units to be optimized 
must have been conpiled with the ada -K option. 


B-4 




COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-I Link the proqram with a version of the tasking run-time 

which supports pre-emptive task scheduling. This option 
produces code which handles interrupts more quickly, but 
has a slight negative impact on performance in general. 

-L library-name 

Default: ada.lib 

Use alternate library. The -L option specifies the name 
of the program library to be consulted by the bamp 
program. This option overrides the default library name. 

-n No link. The -n option suppresses actual object file 

linkage, but creates and performs code generation on the 
main program file. 

-N No operations. The -N option causes the bamp commcind to 

do a "dry run"; it prints out the actions it takes to 
generate the executehle program, but does not actually 
perform those actions. The same kind of information is 
printed by the -P option. 

-o output-file-name 

Default: file 

Use alternate executable file output name. The -o option 
specifies the name of the executable program file written 
by the bamp command. This option overrides the default 
output file name. 

-P Print operations. The -P option causes the bamp command 

to print out the actions it takes to generate the 
executable program as the actions are performed. 

-V Link verbosely. The -v option causes the bamp commcind to 

print out information about what actions it takes in 
building the main program. 

-W Suppress warnings. This option allows you to suppress 

warnings from the optimizer.

APPENDIX C 


APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


The only allowed implementation dependencies correspond to 
inplementation-dependent pragmas, to certain machine-dependent conventions 
as mentioned in Chapter 13 of the Ada Standard, and to certain allowed 
restrictions on representation clauses. The implementation-dependent 
characteristics of this Ada implementation, as described in this Appendix, 
are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted otherwise, 
references in this Appendix are to compiler documentation and not to this 
report. Iinjlementation-specific portions of the package STANDARD, vhich 
are not a part of Appendix F, are; 


package STANDARD is

Appendix F Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


This appendix lists implementation-dependent characteristics of Meridian 
Ada. Note that there are no preceding appendices. This appendix is called 
Appendix F in order to comply with the Reference Manual for the Ada 
Programming Language* (LRM) ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A which states that 
this appendix be named Appendix F. 

Implemented Chapter 13 features include length clauses, enumeration 
representation clauses, record representation clauses, address clauses, 
interrupts, package system, machine code insertions, pragma interface, 
and imchecked programming. 


F. 1 Pragmas 


The implemented pre-defined pragmas are: 

elaborate 

See the LRM section 10.5 

interface 

See section F.1.1 

list 

See the LRM Appendix B 

pack. 

See section F.1.2

suppress 

See section F.1.3 

inline 

See the LRM section 6.3.2. This pragma is not actually effective 


unless you compile/link your program using the global 
optintizer. 

The remaining pre-defined pragmas are accepted, but presently ignored: 


controlled 

shared 


optimize system_naine 

storage_unit memory_size 


Named parameter notation for pragmas is not supported. 

When illegal parameter forms are encoimtered at compile time, the 
compiler issues a warning message rather than an error, as required by 
the Ada Imguage definition. Refer to the LRM Appendix B for additional 
information about the pre-defined pragmas. 


F. 1.1 Pragma Interface 

The form of pragma interface m Meridian Ada is; 
pragma interface! language, subprogram [, "link-name"] );

Appendix F Implementafion-Dependent Characteristics _____ 

where: 

language This is the interface language, one of the n«imes assembly, 
builtin, c, or internal, "nie names builtin and internal are 
reserved for use by Meridian compiler maintainers in 
nm-time support packages. 

subprogram This is the name of a subprogram to which the pragma 
interface applies. 

link-rmme This is an optional string literal specifying the name of the 
non-Ada subprogram corresponding to the Ada 
subprogram named in the second parameter. If link-name is 
omitted, then link-name defaults to the value of subprogram 
translated to lowercase. Depending on the language 
specified, some automatic modifications may made to 
the link-name to produce the actual object code symbol 
name that is generated whenever references are made to 
the corresponding Ada subprogram. The object code 
symbol generated for link-rmme is always translated to 
upper case. 

It is appropriate to use the optional link-rmme parameter to 
pragma interface only when the interface subprogram 
has a name that does not correspond at all to its Ada 
identifier or when the interface subprogram name cannot 
be given using rules for constructing Ada identifiers (e.g., 
if the name contains a '$' character). 

The characteristics of object code symbols generated for each interface 
language are; 

assembly The object code symbol is the same as link-rmme. 

builtin The object code symbol is the same as link-rmme, but prefixed with 

two underscore characters ("_"). This language interface 

is reserved for special interfaces defined by Meridian 
Software Systems, Inc. The builtin interface is presently 
used to declare certain low-level run-time operations 
whose names must not conflict with programmer-defined 
or language system defined names. 

c The object code symbol is othe same as link-rmme, but with one 

underscore character prepended. This is the 
convention used by the C compiler. 

internal No object code symbol is generated for an internal language 
interface; this language interface is reserved for special 
interfaces defined by Meridian Software Systems, Inc. The 
internal interface is presently used to declare certain 
machine-level bit operations. 

No automatic data conversions are performed on parameters of any 
interface subprograms. It is up to the programmer to ensvire that c^Ung 
conventions match and that any necessary data conversions take place 
when calling interface subprograms.

Attributes 


A pragma interface may appear within the same declarative part as 
the subprogram to which the pragma interface applies, following the 
subprogram declaration, and prior to the first use of ^e subprogram. A 
pragma interface that appUes to a subprogram declared in a package 
specification must occur within the same package specification as the 
subprogram declaration; the pragma interface may not appear in the 
package body in this case. A pragma interface declaration for either a 
private or nonprivate subprogram declaration may appear in the private 
part of a package specification. 

Pragma interface for library units is not supported. 

Refer to the LRM section 13.9 for additional information about pragma 
interface. 


F. 1.2 Pragma Pack 

Pragma pack is implemented for composite types (records and arrays). 

Pragma pack is permitted following the composite type declaration to 
which it applies, provided that die pragma occurs within the same 
declarative part as the composite type declaration, before any objects or 
components of the composite type are declared. 

Note that the declarative part restriction means that the type declaration 
and accompanying pragma pack cannot be split across a package 
specification and body. 

The effect of pragma pack is to minimize storage consumption by 
discrete component types whose ranges permit packing. Use of pragma 
pack does not defeat ^locations of alignment storage gaps for some 
record types. Pragma pack does not affect the representations of real 
types, pre-defined integer types, and access types. 


F.1.3 Pragma Suppress 

Pragma suppress is implemented as described in the LRM section 11.7, 
with these differences; 

• Presently, division_check and overflow_check must be suppressed 
via a compiler flag, -fN; pragma suppress is ignored for these two 
numeric checks. 

• The optional "CN =>" parameter name notation for pragma 
suppress is ignored. 

• The optional second parameter to pragma suppress is ignored; the 
pragma always applies to the entire scope in which it appears. 


F.2 Attributes 


All attributes described in the LRM Appendix A are supported.

F.3 Standard Types 

Additional standard types are defined in Meridiem Ada: 

• byte_integer 

• short_integer 

• long_integer 

The standard numeric types are defined as; 

type byte_integer is range -128 .. 127; 

type short_integer is range -32768 32767;

Restrictions on Representation Clauses 


.llllilililllWMWlMlllllWIIIIMlWMWIIIIWMMiMWMWMWMIMi^^ 

F.5 Restrictions on Representation Ciauses 

F.5.1 Length Clauses 


A size specification (t' size) is rejected if fewer bits are specified than 
can accommodate the type. The minimum size of a composite type may 
be subject to application of pragma paclc. It is permitted to specify 
precise sizes for unsigned integer ranges, e.g., 8 for the range 0. . 255. 
However, because of requirements imposed by the Ada language 
definition, a full 32-bit range of unsigned values, i.e. 0. . (2**32) -1, 
cannot be defined, even using a size specification. 

The specification of collection size (t' storage_size) is evaluated at 
rvm-time when the scope of the type to which the length clause applies is 
entered, cmd is therefore subject to rejection (via storage_error) based 
on available storage at the time the allocation is made. A collection may 
include storage used for run-time administration of the collection, and 
therefore should not be expected to accommodate a specific number of 
objects. Furthermore, certain classes of objects such as unconstrained 
discrimincmt array components of records may be allocated outside a 
given collection, so a collection may accommodate more objects than 
might be expected. 

The specification of storage for a task activation (t' storage_size) is 
evaluated at run-time when a task to which the length clause applies is 
activated, and is therefore subject to rejection (via storagejerror) 
based on available storage at ^e time the allocation is made. Storage 
reserved for a task activation is separate from storage needed for any 
collections defined within a task body. 

The specification of small for a fixed point type (t' small) is subject only 
to restrictions defined in the LRM section 13.2. 


F.5.2 Enumeration Representation Ciauses 

The internal code for the literal of an enumeration type named in an 
enumeration representation clause must be in the range of 
standard. integer. 

The value of an internal code may be obtained by applying an 
appropriate instantiation of unchecJced_conversion to an integer type. 


F.5.3 Record Representation Clauses 

The storage unit offset (the at static_simple_expression part) is given in 
terms of ^bit storage units and must be even. 

A bit position (the range part) applied to a discrete type component may 
be in the range 0.. 15, with 0 being the least significant bit of a 
component. A range specification may not specify a size smaller than can 
accommodate the component. A range specification for a component not 
accommodating bit packing may have a higher upper bound as 
appropriate (e.g., 0. . 31 for a discriminant string component). Refer to

the internal data representation of a given component in determining the 
component size and assigning offsets. 

Components of discrete types for which bit positions are specified may 
not straddle 16-bit word botmdaries. 

The value of an alignment clause (the optional at mod part) must evaluate 
to 1,2,4, or 8, and may not be smaller than the highest alignment 
required by any component of the record. On the UNIX operating system, 
this means that some records may not have alignment clauses smaller 
than 2. 


F.5.4 Address Clauses 

An address clause may be supplied for an object (whether constant or 
variable) or a task entry, but not for a subprogram, package, or task unit. 
The meaning of cm address clause suppli^ for a task entry is given in 
sechon F.5.5. 

An address expression for an object is a 32-bit segmented memory 
address of type system, address. 


F.5.5 Interrupts 

A task entry's address clause can be used to associate the entry with a 
UNIX signal. Values in the range 0.. 31 are meaningful, and represent 
the interrupts corresponding to those values. 

An interrupt entry may not have any parameters. 


F.5.6 Change of Representation 

There are no restrictions for changes of representation effected by means 
of type conversion. 


F.6 Implementation-Dependent Components 


No names are generated by the implementation to denote 
implementation-dependent components. 


F.7 Unchecked Conversions 


There are no restrictions on the use of unchecked_conversion. 
Conversions between objects whose sizes do not conform may result in 
storage areas with imdefined values.

F.8 Input-Output Packages 

A summary of the implementation-dependent input-output 
characteristics is; 

• In calls to open and create, iheprm parameter must be the empty 
string (the default value). 

• More than one internal file can be associated with a single external 
file for reading only. For writing, only one internal file may be 
associated with an external file; Do not use reset to get around this 
rule. 

• Temporary sequential and direct files are given names. Temporary 
files are deleted when they are closed. 

• File 1/O is buffered; text files associated with terminal devices are 
line-bviffered. 

• The packages aequential_io and direct_io cannot be 
instcintiated with unconstrained composite types or record types 
with discriminants without defaults.
