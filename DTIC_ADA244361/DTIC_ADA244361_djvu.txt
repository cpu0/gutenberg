CHAPTER 1 


INTRODUCTION 


The Ada implementation described above was tested according to the Ada 
Validation Procedures (Prc90] against the Ada Standard [Ada83] using the 
current Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC). This Validation Summary 
Report (VSR) gives an account of the testing of this Ada implementation. 

For any technical terms used in this report, the reader is referred to 
(Pro90]. A detailed description of the ACVC may be found in the current 
ACVC User's Guide [UG89].

1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: 

A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class 
to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B 
and class L tests are expected to produce errors at compile time and link 
time, respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result when they 
are executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, 
and the procedure CHECK_FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT 
also provides a set of identity functions used to defeat some compiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK FILE is used to check the contents of 
••ext files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately compiled units. Errors 
are expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values -- for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in Appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and 
implementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this implementation are described in section 2.3. 


1-2 





INTRODUCTION 


For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by the 
AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications described in 
the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see section 2.1) and, 
possibly some inapplicable tests (see Section 3.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each test of 
the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are irrelevant 
for a given Ada implementation. The inapplicability criteria for some 
tests are explained in documents issued by ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Issues and commonly referenced in the format Al-dddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were inapplicable for the reasons 
indicated: references to Ada Issues are included as appropriate.

C35702B, C35713C, B86001U, and C86006G check for the predefined type 
LONG FLOAT. 


C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with a 
name other than FLOAT, LONG FLOAT, or SHORT FLOAT. 


A73801E checks that FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST may be used as a range 
constraint in a floating-point type declaration; for this 
implementation, that range exceeds the range of safe numbers of the 
largest predefined floating-point type and must be rejected. (See 
section 2.3.) 


C45531M..P (4 tests) and C45532M..P (4 tests) check fixed-point 
operations for types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or 
greater. 

C45624A checks that the proper exception is raised if MACHINEOVERFLOWS 
is FALSE for floating point types with digits 5. For this 
implementation, MACHINEOVERFLOWS is TRUE. 

C45624B checks that the proper exception is raiseo if MACHINE_0VERFL0WS 
is FALSE for floating point types with digits 6. For this 
implementation, MACHINE_OVERFLOWS is TRUE. 

C86001F recompiles package SV^TEtl. making package TEXT_I0, and hence 
package REPORT, obsolete. For this implementation, the package TEXT_I0 
is dependent upon package SYSTEM. 

B86001Y checks for a predefined fixed-point type other than DURATION. 


C96005B checks for values of type DURATION'BASE that are outside the 
range of DURATION. There are no such values for this implementation. 


2-2 








IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


CD1009C uses a representation clause specifying a non-default size for a 
floating-point type. 

CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use representation 
clauses specifying non-default sizes for access types. 

BD8001A, BD8003A, BD8004A..B (2 tests), and AD8011A use machine code 
insertions. 

The tests listed in the following table are not applicable because the 
given file operations are supported for the given combination of mode 
and file access method.

CE2203A checks that VRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of the 
external file is exceeded for SEQUENTIALIO. This implementation does 
not restrict file capacity. 


CE2403A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of the 
external file is exceeded for DIRECT_IO. This implementation does not 
restrict file capacity. 


CE3304A checks that USE_ERR0R is raised if a call to SET_LINE_LENGTH or 
SET_PAGE_LENGTH specifies a value that is inappropriate for the external 
file. This implementation does not have inappropriate values for either 
line length or page length. 


2-3 








IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


CE3413B checks that PAGE raises LAYOUT_ERROR when the value of the page 
number exceeds COUNT'LAST. For this implementation, the value of 
COUNT'LAST is greater than 150000 making the checking of this objective 
impractical. 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 14 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
implementation did nof report the violations of the Ada Standard in the way 
expected by the original tests. 

B24009A B33301B B38003A B38003B B38009A B38009B 

B85008G B85008H BC1303F BC3005B BD2B03A BD2D03A 

BD4003A 

A35801E was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by 
the AVO. The compiler rejects the use of the range FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST 
as the range constraint of a floating-point type declaration because the 
bounds lie outside of the range of safe numbers (cf. LRM 3.5.7:12).

CHAPTER 3 


PROCESSING INFORMATION 


3.1 TESTING ENVIRONMENT 

The Ada implementation tested in this validation effort is described 
adequately by the information given in the initial pages of this report. 

For a point of contact for technical information about this Ada 
implementation system, see: 

Alliant Computer Systems Corporation 
One Monarch Drive 
Littleton MA 01460 

For a point of contact for sales information about this Ada implementation 
system, see: 


Alliant Computer Systems Corporation 
One Monarch Drive 
Littleton MA 01460 

Testing of this Ada implementation was conducted at the customer's site by 
a validation team from the AVF. 


3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming 
Language Standard, whether the test is applicable or inapplicable; 
otherwise, the Ada Implementation fails the AC^C [Pro90]. 


3-1 




PROCESSING INFORMATION 


For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard. 


a) Total Number of Applicable Tests 3809 

b) Total Number of Withdrawn Tests 83 

c) Processed Inapplicable Tests 77 

d) Non-Processed I/O Tests 0 

e) Non-Processed Floating-Point 

Precision Tests 201 

f) Total Number of Inapplicable Tests 278 


g) Total Number of Tests for ACVC 1.11 4170 

All I/O tests of the test suite were processed because this implementation 
supports a file system. The above number of floating-point tests were not 
processed because they used floating-point precision exceeding that 
supported by the implementation. When this compiler was tested, the tests 
listed in section 2.1 had been withdrawn because of test errors. 


3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

Version 1.11 of the ACVC comprises 4170 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, the tests listed in section 2.1 had been withdrawn because of test 
errors. The AVF determined that 278 tests were inapplicable to this 
implementation. All inapplicable tests were processed during validation 
testing except for 201 executable tests that use floating-point precision 
exceeding that supported by the implementation. In addition, the modified 
tests mentioned in section 2.3 were also processed. 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were loaded directly onto the host computer. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host computer, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the customer and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a complete listing of 
the processing options for this implementation. It also indicates the 
default options. The options invoked explicitly for validation testing 
during this test were: 

-w suppress warnings 

-M link the test into an executable image 


3-2 




PROCESSING INFORMATION 


Test output, compiler and linker listings, and job logs were captured on 
magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site by 
the validation team were also archived.

APPENDIX A 


MACRO PARAMETERS 


This appendix contains the macro parameters used for customizing the ACVC. 
The meaning and purpose of these parameters are explained in [UG89]. The 
following macro parameters are defined in terms of the value V of

B-1 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


NAME 


ada - FX/Ada-2800 compiler 
SYNOPSIS 

ada [options] [ada_source.a ...] [ld_options] [object!ile.o...] 
DESCRIPTION 

Compiles the specified Ada source files into object files and 
optionally (if -M is specified) links the object files into 
an executable file. Object files from previous Ada 
compilations are implicitly included as needed. Object files 
from non-Ada compilations can be explicitly included by 
specifying the names of the .o files. 

Source files must reside in directories that are FX/ADS 
libraries (see a.mklib); source file names must end in .a (a 
period followed by the letter a in lowercase). Output object 
files are placed in the invisible subdirectory .objects and 
are not visible as .o files in the FX/ADS library. Separate 
compilation information is placed in the invisible 
subdirectory .nets. 

If error processing (-e, -E, -el, -El, or -ev) is not 

specified, the raw error messages are written to standard 
error output. If you want to process the raw error messages 
with e.error, redirect standard error output to a file (>& 
filename at the end of the command line). 

OPTIONS 

-A Produces assembly listing from Ada compilation. The 
assembly file produced is in filenameO#.s (the sequence 
of the number 1,2,3 etc. is for each compilation unit in 
the file) or INSTXX#.s (a number determined by the Ada 
library manager) in the current directory. 

-a file_name.a 

(archive) Treats filename.a as an archive file rather 
than an Ada source file. 

-d (dependencies) Analyze the source file for dependencies 
only. No syntax analysis occurs and no object files are 
produced. Used by a.make to establish dependencies 
among new files. 

-e (error) Writes error lines and diagnostics to standard 
output. Only one of the -e or -E options should be used. 


B-2 






COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-E [file I directory] 

(error) Writes error lines and diagnostics to standard 
output and writes the raw error messages to the 
specified file. The name of the file defaults to 
ada_source.err; if a directory name is specified, the 
output is placed in ada_source.err in that directory. 
Only one of the -e or -E options should be used. 

-el (error listing) Writes a full listing with interspersed 
diagnostics to standard output, if any errors occur. 
Only one of the -el or -El options should be used. 

-El (file!directory] 

(error listing) Writes a full listing with interspersed 
diagnostics to standard output and writes the raw error 
messages to the specified file, if any errors occur. 
The name of the file defaults to ada_source.err; if a 
directory name is specified, the output is placed in 
ada source.err in that directory. Only one of the -el 
or -El options should be used. 

-ev (error vi) Embeds the raw error messages in the source 
file and calls vi on the source file. 

-g Turns on debugging (default). 

-L <library_path> 

(library) Specify a FX/ADS library besides the current 
working directory. 

-lx (link) Includes the library libx.a from /lib, /usr/lib, 
or /usr/local/lib. This option is a link option and\ 
must not precede the name of a file that references the 
library. See the Concentrix-2800 Id command. 

-M unit_name 

(main) Produces an executable program using the named 
program unit as the main program. The main program must 
be either a parameterless procedure or a parameterless 
function returning an integer. 

-M ada_source.a 

(main) Like -M unitname, except that the unit name is 
assumed to be the root name of the source file that 
follows 

-noieee 

Disables the ieee facility, which produces results 
conforming to a subset of the IEEE standard for all 
divide and square root operations. The program may run 
faster with the ieee facility disabled, but results may 
be less exact. 


B-3 




COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-o executable_file 

(output) Names the output executable file; by default, 
the executable file is named a.out. The -M option must 
also be specified. 

-Og Calls the global optimizer. 

-OS (super) Option to run fast. Suppresses checks, turns 
off ieee, runs uniproc, enables global optimizer, and 
turns off debug information. 

-pg Produces a program that (at program execution time) 
monitors the calling of routines and writes a gmon.out 
file. The Concentrix-2800 command gprof -A processes 
this file. 

-R library 

(recompile instantiation) Forces an analysis of all 
generic instantiations, causing reinstantiation of any 
that are out of date. 

-S (suppress) Applies the pragma SUPPRESS to the entire 

compilation. 

-sh (show) Shows the pathname of the tool actually called. 

-T (timing) Prints timing information for the compilation. 

-u (update) Updates the library ada.lib even if syntax 
errors are present. 

-uniproc 

Compiles and optimizes code for a single processor or 
for a detached processor. The -uniproc option disables 
concurrent optimization, optimizes code assuming that 
all data is in memory (which is cacheable in the i860 
on-chip cache). If you invoke the compiler with the 
paxc -uniproc command line option, -uniproc is set to 
TRUE for uniprocessing systems and FALSE for 
multiprocessing systems. 

-V (verbose) Prints the compiler version number, the date 
and time of compilation, and summary information 

concerning the compilation. 

-V same as -v. 

-V (warnings) Suppresses warning diagnostics. 

EXAMPLES 

The following example compiles the source file hello.a

ATTACHMENT V 

APPENDIX F. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 
FX/Ada-2800 release 1.0 Compiler 


1. "Implementation-Dependent Pragmas" 


INLINE_ONLY Pragma 

The INLINE_ONLY pragma, when used in the same way as 
pragma INLINE, indicates to the compiler that the sub¬ 
program must Iways be inlined. This pragma also 
suppresses the generation of a callable version of the 
routine which saves code space. 

BUILT_IN Pragma 

The BUILT_IN pragma is used in the implementation of 
some predefined Ada packages, 1 . provides no user 
access. It is used only to implement code bodies for 
which no actual Ada b'-ciy can be provided, for example 
the MACHINE_CODE package. 

RESOURCE Pragma 

The RESOURCE pragma specifies the resource class of the 
task (or tasks of a task type) or the resource class of 
the main program. It is used to force a task to exe¬ 
cute on a particular resource class when multiple pro¬ 
cessors are used to execute an Ada program. This 
pragma takes a static expression of the type 
RESOURCE_TYPE declared in package SYSTEM. This pragma 
is only allowed within the specification of a task unit 
or immediately within the outermost declarative part of 
a main program. 

SHARE_CODE Pragma 

The SHARE_CODE pragma is not recognized by the FX/Ada- 
2800 compiler. 

EXTERNAL_NAME Pragma 

The EXTERNAL_NAME pragm.a takes the name of a subprogram 
or variable defined in Ada and allows the user to 
specify an external name that may be used to reference 
the entity from other languages. The pragma is allowed 









3 


at the place of a declarative item in a package specif¬ 
ication and must apply to an object declared earlier in 
the same package specification. 

INTERFACE_NAME Pragma 

The INTERFACE_NAME pragma takes the name of a a vari¬ 
able defined in another language and allows it to be 
referenced directly in Ada. The pragma will replace 
all occurrences of the variable name with an external 
reference to the second, link_argument. The pragma is 
allowed at the place of a declarative item in a package 
specification and must apply to an object declared ear¬ 
lier in the same package specification. The object 
must be declared as a scalar or an access type. The 
object cannot be any of the following: 
a loop variable, 
a constant, 

an initialized variable, 
an array, or 
a record. 

The INTERFACE_NAME pragma is also used to provide an 
external link name to a subprogram which has been 
defined using the INTERFACE pragma. 

LINK_WITH Pragma 

The LINK_WITH pragma specifies a command to add to the 
a.Id link line. This pragma takes one argument, a 
string. 

IMPLICIT_CODE Pragma 

The IMPLICIT_CODE pragma is not recognized by the 
FX/Ada-2800 compiler. 

NON_REENTRANT 

This pragma takes one argument which can be the name of 
either a library subprogram or a subprogram declared 
immediately within a library package spec or body. It 
indicates to the compiler that the subprogram will not 
be called recursively allowing the compiler to perform 
specific optimizations. The pragma can be applied to a 
subprogram or a set of overloaded subprogram within a 
package spec or package body. 

NOT_ELABORATED 

This pragma can only appear in a library package 
specification. It indicates that the package will not 
be elaborated because it is either part of the RTS, a 
configuration package or an Ada package that is refer¬ 
enced from a language other than Ada. The presence of 




4 


this pragma suppresses the generation of elaboration 
code and issues warnings if elaboration code is 
required. 


2. Implementation of Predefined Pragmas 


CONTROLLED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has 
no effect. 

ELABORATE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B 
of the Ada RM. 

INLINE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B 
of the Ada RM. 

INTERFACE 

This pragma supports calls to 'C', Pascal, and FORTRAN 
functions. The Ada subprograms can be either functions 
or procedures. The types of parameters and the result 
type for functions must be scalar, access or the prede¬ 
fined type ADDRESS in SYSTEM. All parameters must have 
mode IN. Record and array objects can be passed by 
reference using the ADDRESS attribute. 


LIST 


This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B 
of the Ada RM. 

MEMORY_SIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The 
implementation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by 
means of pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recom¬ 
piled. 

OPTIMIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has 
no effect. 


PACK 


This pragma will cause the compiler to choose a non- 
aligned representation for composite types. It will not

causes objects to be packed at the bit level. 

PAGE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B 
of the Ada RM. 

PRIORITY 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B 
of the Ada RM. 

SHARED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has 
no effect. 

STORAGE_UNIT 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The 
implementation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by 
means of pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recom¬ 
piled. 

SUPPRESS 

This pragma is implemented as described, except that 
RANGE_CHECK and DIVISION_CHECK cannot be supressed. 

SYSTEM_NAME 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The 
implementation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by 
means of pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recom¬ 
piled.

6. Restrictions On Representation Clauses 


Pragma PACK 








9 


In the absence of pragma PACK record components are 
padded so as to provide for efficient access by the 
target hardware. Pragma PACK applied to a record elim¬ 
inates the padding where possible. Pragma PACK has no 
ot.her effect on the storage allocated for record com¬ 
ponents, so a record representation is required to make 
record components smaller. Bit packing is not sup¬ 
ported for components larger than STORAGE_UNIT. Com¬ 
ponents smaller than STCRAGZ^UNIT will be bit packed 
within a storage unit. Objects and larger components 
are packed to the nearest whole STORAGE_CINIT. 

Length Clauses 

For scalar types, a le.ngrh clause which is a size 
specification will compress storage to the niimber of 
bits required to represent the range of the subtype. 
For fixed, short_float, and access types, this is 32. 
For float, this is 64. 

A size specification applied to a composite type with 
components of composite types will not cause compres¬ 
sion of component storage. To allocate the minimal 
number of bits for records of composite types, an 
e.xplicit record represenoaticn clause must be given 
with length clauses fcr each component. An error will 
be issued if there is insufficient space allocated. 
Component clauses need not be aligned on STORAGE_DNIT 
boundaries. A component of a record representation 
clause may not specify fewer bits for a component type 
than would be used for va_ues of the type. 

Size specifications (T'SICE: are not supported for task 
types. Specifications of srorage for a task activation 
(T'STORAGE_SIZE) is supporred. The rainimtun storage 
size for task activations is 5120, but can be larger 
depending on the size of daoa objects declared in the 
task. 

The size specification T'3M.'.ll is not supported except 
when the representation specification is the same as 
the value 'SMALL for t.he base type. 

Specification of collection oize is supported. 


Address Clauses 

Address clauses are supporoec fcr uninitialized vari¬ 
ables and constants. They are not supported by the 
ccmpiler for subprograms, packages, and task units. 


Interrupts 


Interrupt entries are supported for JNIX signals. The 
Ada for clause gives the UNIX signal number. The fol¬ 
lowing is the meaning associated with the valid UNIX 
signals: 


1 

SIGHUP 

hangup 

2 

SIGINT 

interrupt 

3 

SIGQUIT 

quit 

4 

SIGILL 

illegal instruction (not reset when caught) 

5 

SIGTRAF 

trace trap (not reset when caught) 

6 

SIGIOT 

lOT instruction 

7 

SIGZMT 

EMT instruction 

8 

SIGFPE 

floating point exception 

9 

SIGKILL 

kill (cannot be caught or ignored) 

10 

SIGBUS 

bus error 

11 

SIGSEGV 

segmentation violation 

12 

SIGSXS 

bad argument to system call 

13 

SIGPIPE 

write on a pipe with no one to read it 

14 

SIGALRM 

alarm clock 

15 

SIGTERM 

software termination signal from kill 

16 

SIGURG 

urgent condition on 10 channel 

17 

SIGSTOP 

sendable stop signaU. not from tty 

18 

SIGTSTP 

stop signal from tty 

19 

SIGCONT 

continue a stopped process 

20 

SIGCHLD 

to parent on child stop or exit 

21 

SIGTTIN 

to readers pgrp upon background tty read 

22 

SIGTTOU 

like TTIN for output if (tp->t_local4LT0ST0P) 

23 

SIGIO 

input/output possible signal 

24 

SIGXCPU 

exceeded CPU time limit 

25 

SIGXFSZ 

exceeded file size limit 

26 

SIGVTALRM 

virtual time alarm 

27 

SIGPROF 

profiling time alarm 

28 

SIGWINCH 

window changed 




Representation Attributes 

The ADDRESS attribute is not supported for packages and 
task entries. The compiler issues a warning message 
and the value which is type SYSTEM-ADD^SS is 

system.no addr. 


Machine Code Insertions 

Machine code insertions are not supported by the 
FX/Ada-2800 compiler. 


7 . Conventions for Implementation-generated Names 


There are no implementation-generated names. 

8. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clauses 

Address clauses are supported for constants and vari¬ 
ables. Address clauses for interrupts are interpreted 
as described above. 

9. Restrictions on Unchecked Conversions 
None. 


10. Restrictions on Unchecked Deallocations 
None. 


11. Implementation Characteristics of I/O Packages 

The input output packages are implemented as specified 
in Chapter 14 of the LRM. 10 characteristics are dic¬ 
tated by the underlying Unix 10 subsystem which is 
bit-stream oriented for disc 10 and block oriented for 
tape 10. Other devices have additional characteris¬ 
tics . 

Ada 3equential_I0 and Direct__I0 is implemented such 
that reads and writes call the Unix system calls 
read(2) and write(2). If ycu instantiate Sequential_IO 
or Direct_I0 with a constrained type, there is a one- 
to-one correspondence between Ada read/writes to UNIX 
read/writes. Otherwise, there are 2 Unix reads/writes 
to one Ada read/write, one for the size and one for the 
data. 




12. Implementation Limits 

The following limits are actually enforced by the 
implementation. It is not intended to imply that 
resources up to or even near these limits are available 
to every program. 


Line Length 

The implementation supports a maximum line length of 
500 characters including the end of line character. 

Record and Array Sizes 

The maximum size of a statically sized array or record 
type is 4,000,000 x STORAGE^CJNITS. A record type or 
array type declaration that exceeds these limits will 
generate a warning message. 

Default Stack Size for Tasks 

In the absence cf an explicit STORAGE_SIZE length 

specification < /ery task except the main program is 
allocated a f'...ed size stack of 20,480 STORAGE__ONITS. 
This is tha .alue returned by T'STORAGE_SIZE for^a task 
type T. The minimum stack size for tasks is 10240. 

Default Collection Size 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGE__SIZE length 

attribute the default collection size for an access 
type is 100 times the size of the designated type. 
This is the value returned by T'STORAGE__SI2E for an 
access type T. 

Limit on Declared Objects 

There is an absolute limit of 6,000,000 x STORAGE_aNITS 
for objects declared statically within a con5)ilation 
unit. If this value is exceeded the compiler will ter¬ 
minate the compilation of the unit with a FATAL error 
message.
