ABSTRACT 

This paper describes Myanmar Alphabet Recognition 
System Based on Neural Network. Typical pattern 
recognition systems are designed using two parts. The 
first part is a feature extractor that finds features 
within the data, which are specific to the task being 
solved. Edge detection method is used to extract 
image’s features. It may be grouped into two 
categories, gradient and Laplacian. The gradient 
method (Roberts, Prewitt, Sobel) detects the edges by 
looking for the maximum and minimum in the first 
derivative of the image. In this paper, Sobel edge 
operator is chosen because it can generate the 
significant features for Myanmar Alphabet than other 
techniques. The second part is the classifier; 
Multilayer Perceptron Network is designed for 
recognition purpose. It is used to train the train data 
set and classify the test data set that it is shown with 
its result box and sound. These data sets are composed 
of all Myanmar alphabets. For programming and 
simulation of this paper, MATLAB Programming 
Language is used for implementation.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Character recognition is becoming more and more 
important in the modem world. It helps humans ease 
their jobs and solve more complex problems. It also is 
one of the popular application toolboxes. Toolboxes 
are comprehensive collections of MATLAB functions 
(M-files) that extend the MATLAB environment to 
solve particular classes of problem. Areas in which 
toolboxes are available include signal processing, 
control systems, neural network, fuzzy logic, 


wavelets, simulation, and many others Artificial 
Neural Networks is used to train and identify 
Myanmar alphabet. A Neural Networks is an 
information-processing paradigm that is inspired by 
the way biological nervous systems, such as brain, 
process information. There are different types of 
Neural Networks such as Perceptron's Network, 
Linear Network, Back propagation Network, 
Dynamic Network, Radial Basis Network, etc. 
Perceptron Network is chosen for this paper. 
Perceptron is the simplest form of Neural Networks 
and function as a pattern classifier. To simulate the 
recognition system, MATLAB programming 
language is studied. In this paper, firstly, Myanmar 
Alphabet image files are created and saved as xx.gif 
file. These files are separated as train data set and test 
data set. Textural features: pattern, spatial frequency, 
homogeneity, etc. The extracted feature sets are saved 
as xx.txt file format. Finally, the neural networks 
program is applied to train files set and classify the 
tests data files. 

II. PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION 
STEPS OF MYANMAR 
ALPHABET RECOGNITION 

The steps needed for the implementation of Myanmar 
alphabet recognition systems are described in the 
following articles. 

A. Database Creation 

Creating a database consisting of a train set and a test 
set. Table 1 shows file classes and numbers of train 
and test files.

B. Programming Parts 

There are two program parts in Software 
Implementation for Myanmar Alphabet Recognition 
System: feature extraction and Neural Networks 
programs. These programs are written in M-file of 
MATLAB. The user must be prepared a database 
consisting of train, test and target files before the 
programs start in MATLAB command window. In 
feature extraction portion, Robert, Prettwit and Sobel 
operators are testd to detect edges of images. By 
comparing the extracted features, Sobel operator is 
found that it can generate the most significant features 
for each alphabet. Table 2 shows the example of 
extracted features which are grouped in every 5 
degree bins for ka. gji and ga. nge alphabets. Based on 
these facts, sobel operator is selected in feature 
extraction program.

Sobel operator is shown in Figure 2.Neural Network 
Program executes the classification of images on the 
basis of the set of features have been extracted. This 
program applies Multilayer Perceptron Network 
because it is the simplest method for classification. 
The hard limit transfer function in this method is used 
to set the output and create neurons that classify 
inputs into two distinct categories. Figure 3 shows the 
flowchart of Neural Network Program.

III. EXPERIMENTAL PARAMETERS 

The purpose of this program is to extract features of 
images in train and test files. When this program runs, 
a menu box appears asking the user whether the user 
want to run the algorithm on test or train sets. If the 
user chooses train set, the second menu will appears 
for the user to choose the type of character files. 
These menu b oxes are shown in Figu re 4.

One type of character files is chosen and then the user 
must input the numbers of images in train file. A for 
loop is used to read an entire file of images as strings 
and store them in MATLAB’s memory. The image 
string is resized to 150x140 pixels. This size is the 
optimal for enough detail while keeping the 
processing time low. The original image and resized 
image of ka. gji are shown in Figure 5.

The next step is to detect the edges of images using 
Sobel operator. The images and this operator are 
convoluted in x- and y-directions, and the gradient of 
images is estimated. Then, the direction of gradient is 
calculated and the resulting matrix is rearranged into a 
column vector by using im2col MATLAB function. 
Finally, the column is converted from the radians to 
the degrees. The orientation magnitude is read every 5 
degrees and summed to form a bin for the orientation 
histograms. The numbers of histogram bin are 36 bins 
because the actual resolution of each bin is set to 5 
degree. These bins are stored in trainl.txt file to feed 
to the Neural Network. If the user chooses test set, the 
set but the features of test set is automatic stored in 
text file. MATLAB Programming develops this 
algorithm that is feature extraction method. 

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULT

steps in Neural Network program. If the user wants to 
run this program, the following command has to type 
in command window of MATLAB.

When the training process starts, the plot of sum- 
square error and epoch shown in Figure 7 can be seen. 
When the sum-square error reaches to zero or the 
training reach to the defined epochs as shown in 
Figure 8, the next processes can be performed.

After the training process, program asks the user to 
enter the test file name to be classified. If the user 
writes the invalid test file name, warning message box 
will appear as shown in Figure 9.

When the test file is in the valid range, the Multilayer 
Perceptron network classifies this file and the original 
image with the result box will appear. The classified 
image, ka. gji, and its result box are shown in Figure

V. CONCLUSIONS 

In this paper, pattern recognition systems are designed 
using two parts. The first part is a feature extractor 
that finds features within the data which are specific 
to the task being solved (finding pixels within an 
image for character recognition). When the feature 
extract program is tested with various operators, Sobel 
edge operator is found that it is the best one for 
Myanmar Alphabet Recognition System. Therefore, 
this operator is chosen. The performance of 
recognition can be increased when the input training 
data files are increased. The size of database set is 
present as an important role of the training section. 
For the second part, classification, the Multilayer 
Perceptron Neural Network is discussed and 
implemented in this paper. It can also be used for 
almost any image recognition applications. The 
network is a 3 layer configuration, with the required 
input and output layers, as well as a single hidden 
layer that choosing the number of hidden layers is a 
difficult task with no hard rules or guidelines. 
However, the size of a hidden layer is related to the 
features or distinguishing characteristics that are to be 
discerned from the data. Here, the network applies 
one hidden layer, which has 300 neurons. The output 
layer is where the output vector can be retrieved. Each 
neuron in this layer outputs a value between 0 and 1, 
which is guaranteed by the use of a hard limit transfer 
function when calculating each neuron’s output.
