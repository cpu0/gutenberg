Technical Report - FY11 Experiment Data Documentation 
Summary 

In this period of performance, we are continuing to develop the radar design, software, and 
software for the final demonstration. We are also ordering and building the final demonstration 
hardware. 

1.0 INTRODUCTION 

In this report we discuss progress in system development and experiments performed in FY11. 

1.1 Software design 

We continue to develop the software application at the receiver. Specifically, we are integrating 
a prior C program that was developed to acquire DGPS signal, with a compass, so that the 
position of the radar antenna can be estimated with ~2cm accuracy. We have completed the C- 
code that reports the DGPS readings through a serial interface, along with time stamps, and an 
indication of data quality. We show a screen shot of the reported GPS position below.

1.2 Experiments in FY011 

To date, we completed a wireless, laboratory based frequency synchronization experiment with 
the completed hardware.
