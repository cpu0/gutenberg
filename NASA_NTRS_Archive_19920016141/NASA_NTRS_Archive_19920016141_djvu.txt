TECHNICAL REPORT 





The RICIS Concept 



The University of Houston-Clear Lake established the Research Institute for 
Computing and Information Systems {RICIS] in 1986 to encourage the NASA 
Johnson Space Center (JSC) and local industry to actively support research 
in the computing and information sciences. As part of this endeavor, UHCL 
proposed a partnership with JSC to jointly define and manage an integrated 
program of research in advanced data processing technology needed for JSC’s 
main missions, Including administrative, engineering and science responsi- 
bilities. JSC agreed and entered into a continuing cooperative agreement 
with UHCL beginning in May 1986, to jointly plan and execute such research 
through RICIS. Additionally, under Cooperative Agreement NCC 9-16, 
computing and educational facilities are shared by the two institutions to 
conduct the research. 

The UHCL/RICIS mission is to conduct, coordinate, and disseminate research 
and professional level education in computing and information systems to 
serve the needs of the government, industry, community and academia. 
RICIS combines resources of UHCL and its gateway affiliates to research and 
develop materials, prototypes and publications on topics of mutual interest 
to its sponsors and researchers. Within UHCL, the mission is being 
implemented through interdisciplinary involvement of faculty and students 
from each of the four schools: Business and Public Administration, Educa- 
tion, Human Sciences and Humanities, and Natural and Applied Sciences. 
RICIS also collaborates with industry in a companion program. This program 
is focused on serving the research and advanced development needs of 
industry. 

Moreover, UHCL established relationships with other universities and re- 
search organizations, having common research Interests, to provide addi- 
tional sources of expertise to conduct needed research. For example, UHCL 
has entered into a special partnership with Texas A&M University to help 
oversee RICIS research and education programs, while other research 
organizations are Involved via the “gateway" concept 

A major role of RICIS then is to find the best match of sponsors, researchers 
and research objectives to advance knowledge in the computing and informa- 
tion sciences. RICIS, workingjolntly with its sponsors, advises on research 
needs, recommends principals for conducting the research, provides tech- 
nical and administrative support to coordinate the research and integrates 
technical results into the goaJs of UHCL, NASA/JSC and industry.

Repository-Based Software Engineering Program (RBSE) 

Final Report 
January 7, 1992 


Summary: Applied Expertise, Inc. (AE) has been under contract to the University of Houston, 
Clear Lake, since March 1, 1990. During this time AE has provided support to program 
managers at both Level 1 and Level 3 and to the program’s Chief Scientist. 

AE has delivered critical support in areas specified in its statement of work: client/customer 
liaison, research representation/outreach and program management support. Significant 
accomplishments include the following: 

Program Management Support 

In addition to providing rapid response to program management requests, AE has sought to 
provide proactive, long-term analyses that served to keep RBSE focused on a set of defined goals 
and objectives, established a framework for demonstrating the program’s value and provided 
vision for future directions. 

• Improved manapement control of pro gram expenditures and activities, 

o Saved $250,000 through significant analysis of AdaNET ADP acquisition 
alternatives in the fall of 1990. 

o Participated in the review and improvement of the Program Management Plan, 
o Developed program evaluation criteria. 

o Encouraged management to define a focus or niche that established the uniqueness 
of the RBSE program and how it fits with other government reuse efforts, 
o Participated in briefings to NASA HQ management. 

• Coordinated evaluations. 

o Developed briefing materials and draft agenda for formal program review, 

o Wrote program review summaries, 

o Tracked program review action items. 

• Drafted responses to congressional inquiries. In one case, the language of the response 
was adapted into law. 

• Developed preliminary concept for integration of AdaNET and the Technology Utilizatio n 
Network System. 

Liaison/Research Representation 

Our criteria for selecting meetings and organizations to target reflect our overall approach. Rather 
than choosing standard, well-attended events and well-known groups, we recommend events to 
our customer that most efficiently promote RBSE goals. These recommendations are based on 
the following: 


1/ ^ W K) 


Participation by potential AdaNET customers and sponsors, particularly those interested 
in safety-critical systems. 

Cost. 

Potential impact in promoting software engineering/reuse. 

The degree to which we can provide significant leadership. 

Potential for identifying the needs of AdaNET customers. 

Our activities under this UHCL contract serve to illustrate how AE’s approach has been applied: 

• Establishment of potentially high-impact cust omer/collaborator relationships ^ 

o At the American Society for Quality Control conference in October 1991, AE 
identified important potential clients in Bell Communications Research, Boeing 
Commercial Airlines, the ASQC Software Standards Committee, and Varian 
Medical Equipment. 

o AE identified NASA Code Q as a potential collaborator and held discussions with 
key executives, laying the groundwork for future efforts. 

• leadership in the Reuse Library Interoperability Group.. AE staff serve as Technical 
Committee Vice Chair and Secretary and as Chair of the Metrics Subcommittee (TC4). 
AE also drafted a problem statement for the RIG and has participated in efforts to expand 
the visibility and membership of the group. 

• Leadership in the POD System Acquisition and Software Reuse Working Group.. AE 
participated in the "Barriers and Incentives" task group, developed a work process that 
was presented by the conference chair and used by all five task groups, and developed 
a problem statement for the task group. 

• Reports on research and programs directly releva nt to RBSE goals and efforts ^ For 
instance, AE produced a report analyzing the impacts to program management, RBSE and 
economic competitiveness of the Software Engineering Institute’s updated Capability 
Maturity Model and its Technology Transition Plan. 

• Establishment of RBSE Chief Scient i st as reviewer of Bell Canada’s "Capability 
Assessment Methodology." 

Deliveries 

AE has delivered more than 90 products, including summaries of meetings, trips and contacts, 
and special reports and papers (see Attachment A). 

• Among its eight meeting summaries, AE delivered detailed reports on RIG meetings and 
on the first workshop held by the DOD Systems Acquisition and Software Reuse Working 

Group.

• Nine contact summaries included reports of discussions held with key people in software 
reuse and quality. These included talks with Jim Hess, special assistant for software to 
the Secretary of the Army, Don Sova of NASA Code Q, and many members of ASQC 
and its Software Standards Committee. 

• Special reports and reviews included reviews of AdaNET acquisition plans, of the 
Program Management Plan and Concept Document, a report on SEI’s Capability Maturity 
Model and a presentation of suggested program evaluation criteria. 

• AE also provided more than 60 copies of briefings, articles, research papers, memos and 
standards relevant to the program. Examples of these include: 

o Draft report of the Joint Logistics Commanders’ San Antonio I Reusability Panel 

o Draft of the ASSET Library Open Architecture Framework (ALOAF) 

o RAASP Library Usage Metrics 

o Briefings by Paul Strassmann 

o NASA software document standards and guidance 
o Bell Canada’s Capability Assessment Methodology 

Conclusion 

Applied Expertise, Inc. has consistently sought to identify opportunities for liaison and program 
management support that provide the highest possible impact with use of the fewest possible 
resources. Not only has the company targeted key individuals and organizations with the greatest 
potential for a positive impact on RBSE, it has sought to package the information gained in these 
liaison efforts into clear, concise reports that would offer the greatest utility to the Program 
Manager and the Chief Scientist. Attachment A includes a list of these deliverables, which AE 
has made during the period of contract performance.
