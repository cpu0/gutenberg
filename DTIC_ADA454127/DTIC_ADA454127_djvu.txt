Pipeline Optimization Program (PLOP) 

by Derek Wilson 


PURPOSE: This technical note describes the Pipeline Optimization Program (PLOP), a 
computer program that optimizes pipeline transport of slurry based on slurry pump performance, 
material characteristics, pipeline characteristics, and industrial standards. PLOP uses a rules- 
based programming language, C Language Integrated Production System (CLIPS). Rules-based 
languages are advantageous in addressing decision-making problems inherent to slurry pump and 
pipeline transport and are also consistent with the framework of the Dredging Operations 
Decision Support System (DODSS, https://dodss.wes.army.mi1/wiki/0). PLOP compiles industry 
standards and governing physical principles into a single executable file that makes decisions 
and processes output based solely on the initial input parameters. 

BACKGROUND: The decision-making process associated with pipeline slurry transport is vast 
and tedious. Simplifying this process with computer applications involves incorporating expert 
and heuristic knowledge into the application source code. CLIPS readily performs such 
operations as well as conventional numerical procedures. CLIPS is an open source expert 
systems program available at http://www.ghg.net/clips/CLIPS.html. CLIPS has been used in 
developing the PLOP program at the U.S. Army Research and Development Center (ERDC). 

CLIPS: C Language Integrated Production System (CLIPS) is a rules-based programming 
language. Rules-based languages input data as facts. Facts that correspond to certain conditions 
execute rules. These rules process the facts to produce output. Rules may be regarded as 
conditional elements found in procedural languages. However, there is no strict hierarchy or 
order in which these rules execute. Rules are executed whenever facts that meet the conditional 
elements are asserted. Because of this principle, CLIPS holds the advantage over procedural 
language for pattern matching. CLIPS does not need to iterate through all input data to 
determine a match. Rather, rules that specify matching conditions determine which input 
corresponds to these conditions and processes that input accordingly. 

When expert or heuristic knowledge is heavily involved in a programming application, CLIPS’ 
capability becomes readily apparent. Processing expert or heuristic knowledge is essentially 
pattern and criteria matching. Matching operations that span a vast amount of data would be 
unwieldy for procedural languages. 

CUTPRO ANALOGIES: CUTPRO was developed by Stephen Scott (1998, 2000) as a tool to 
monitor and predict cutterhead dredge efficiency. CUTPRO was written in FORTRAN 
procedural language. CUTPRO uses the principles governing solid transport with centrifugal 
pumps developed by Wilson et al. (1997). CUTPRO calculates the pump requirements given 
pipeline and material characteristics and the rate of transport. PLOP, however, determines the 
production rate of slurry transport given the pump hydraulic characteristics considered for the

operation as well as the pipeline and material characteristics. PLOP, therefore, solves for 
CUTPRO in reverse. 

PROGRAM METHODS: 

Input Format. The input data are stored as facts for CLIPS to process. Input data are divided 
into three categories: industrial standards data, pump characteristics data, and pipeline system 
and materials data. The industrial standards data, it is assumed, are relatively universal and are 
not subject to change. Pump characteristics data, although variable, are not considered subject to 
change within any given execution of the program. Pipeline and materials data are subject to the 
most change, since they will define the overall performance of the slurry transport application. 
This is what the user is expected to concentrate on when optimizing the pipeline system. 

The pipeline and material facts are input as the following variables: 

• Elevation difference (Az): Difference in elevation from the pump to the discharge point 
[meters] Default value is 10 m (32.8 ft). 

• Digging depth (Azrf): Depth of the pipe intake [meters]. Default value is 3 m (9.8 ft). 

• Pipeline length ( L ): Discharge length of the pipeline system [meters]. Default value is 
2,000 m (6,560 ft). 

• Pipeline diameter ( D ): Discharge diameter of the pipeline [meters]. Default value is 0.609 m 
(2 ft). 

• Equivalent length (L eq )\ Equivalent length of the pipeline superimposed on the pipeline 
system due to minor losses in the from the intake, elbows, and constrictions. Typical value is 
40 pipeline diameters [meters]. Default value is 25 m (82 ft). 

• Suction length (. L s ): Length of pipeline from the intake to the pump [meters]. Default value 
is 10 m (32.8 ft). 

• Suction diameter ( D s ): Diameter of the pipeline along this length [meters]. Default value is 
0.609 m (2 ft). 

Figure 1 illustrates the relationships among these variables. The material data define the 
pertinent material characteristics as follows: 


• dso: Average particle size of dredged material [meters]. Default value is 0.25 mm. 

• dss: Particle diameter in which 85 percent of all particles are finer than [meters]. Default 
value is 0.5 mm. 

• Xh: Mass fraction of silt and clay. Default value is 0.0. 

• S m : Maximum slurry relative density expected in the pipeline system. Default value is 1.32.

If the system data or material data are asserted without specific values for these slots, the default 
values are automatically applied. 

Pump characteristic data are stored as multiple pump-characteristic facts. These facts store the 
pump curve data as follows: 

• Pump number: The pump identification name or number. 

• Flow rate: Volumetric flow rate through the pump (m 3 /s). 

• Head: Dynamic head delivered by the pump at the corresponding flow rate (meters of 
slurry). 

• NPSHR: Net Positive Suction Pressure Head required at pump intake to prevent cavitation 
(meters of slurry). 

• RPM: Angular velocity of the pump impellor (RPM). 

• Efficiency: Pump output efficiency (percent). 

• Acceptability: Boolean expression stating whether or not the values for this pump 
performance point are practical for the pipeline and material characteristics specified. 

Industrial standards data are obtained from Wilson et al. (1997) for their extensive research 
conducted with slurry pump design and implementation. These facts relate the minimum and 
maximum acceptable pump flow rates as a function of particle diameter, mixture density, and 
pump casing shell type. The data as published by Wilson et al. are used to determine the 
acceptability of the pump facts. The industrial standards data are formatted into the pump-op- 
limits and shell-type-limits fact templates as follows: 

(deftemplate pump-op-limits (slot class) 

(slot max-discharge-vel) 

(slot max-suction-vel) 

(slot max-impeller-prph-speed))

(deftemplate shell-type-limits-of-Qbep 
(slot class) 

(slot shell-type) 

(multislot min-max-percent-QBEP)) 
The parameters for these templates are described as follows: 










Class: Scale from 1 to 4 

based on the slurry density 
and average particle size. A 
higher pump class value 
indicates more abrasive 
slurry. The pump class value 
relationship is illustrated in 
Figure 2. 

Max-discharge-velocity: 

Maximum slurry velocity 
through the discharge of the 
pump. 

Max- suction-velocity: 

Maximum allowable slurry 
velocity through the intake of 
the pump. 

Max-impeller-prph-speed: 

Maximum impellor tip speed; essentially the product of the RPM and pump diameter. A 
typical 0.8m impellor diameter is automatically assumed for simplicity. 



Figure 2. Pump class as a function of d 50 and S m (from Wilson 
et al. (1977)) 


• Shell-type: Characterizes the pump shell geometry as annular, volute, or semi-volute (see 
Figure 3). Semi-Volute is automatically the assumed shell type. 



• Min-max-percent-QBEP: Each pump has a flow rate that produces maximum pump 
efficiency (approximately 85 percent). This is referred to as the best efficiency point (BEP). 
In the interest of acceptable wear rate on the pump, industrial standards dictate that the flow 


4 

















ERDC TN-D0ER-T5 
August 2006 

rate through the slurry pump cannot exceed or recede a specified percentage of the flow rate 
corresponding to the BEP. 

Pump Acceptability Rules. The facts for pump performance, industrial standards and 
pipeline and material characteristics are processed by pump acceptability rules to determine the 
industrial practicality range of each pump. The pump performance facts acceptability slot is 
labeled as either yes (acceptable) or no (unacceptable). Acceptability is processed on the pump- 
curve facts for the following criteria: 

• Flow rate for a pump-curve fact corresponds at less than or equal to the maximum acceptable 
discharge and suction velocity (V max ). 

• Efficiency for a pump-curve fact corresponds within the range of minimum and maximum 
acceptable pump efficiency. 

• Rotational speed (RPM) for a pump-curve fact corresponds at less than or equal to the 
maximum permissible rotational velocity. 

The pump performance envelope produced by these rules is illustrated in Figure 4. 



Figure 4. Pump performance envelope 


PLOP Program Input Validity. When creating system-data facts for the program to process, 
it is important to make sure that the input is valid (i.e. not outside the scope for this pipeline 
application). Parameters that are not acceptable for the pumps considered are illustrated in the 
examples in Appendix A.

System Performance Output. System curves form the relation between flow-rate and head 
for a slurry of a given specific gravity. System-curve facts contain the data that composes the 
system curves for a slurry pump system. Each slurry density will form its own system curve 
calculated from the governing principles determined by Wilson et al. The intersection between a 
pump curve and a system curve represents the performance point where a pump will operate for 
a given material and pipe system. These system curves and performance points are illustrated in 
Figure 5. System curve facts also contain the data for available net positive suction head 
(NPSHA) or the absolute pressure head computed at the pump intake. NPSHA must be greater 
than the required net positive suction head (NPSHR) for a given pump to prevent the onset of 
cavitation. 



Figure 5. System and pump curves and their corresponding performance points 

System rules on acceptable pump-data facts produce corresponding system-curve-data facts 
calculating the following variables: 

• System head: Dynamic pressure head required to pump the slurry through the pipeline 
system at the given flow rate and slurry density. 

• NPSHA: Net positive suction head available (NPSHA). Pressure head at the pump intake 
for the given flow rate and slurry density. 

• Head difference: The difference between the system head and pump head at the given flow 
rate and density. 

A head difference greater than zero signifies that the system requires more head than the 
pump can produce at a given flow rate and slurry density and vice versa. The system will 
perform where the system and pump head are equal (i.e., head-difference = 0). However, no 


6 










ERDC TN-D0ER-T5

fact will likely compute zero head difference. Therefore, the performance point must be 
interpolated. 

Interpolation is performed on the two system curve data facts that have positive and negative 
head-difference values closest to zero and the pump-data facts with the corresponding flow 
rates as illustrated in Figure 6. 



Figure 6. Pump performance interpolation 

Performance flow rate, head, efficiency, NPSHR, and NPSHA are all interpolated from these 
facts from one rule. The performance points for the pump and pipeline setup are then 
asserted as pump-performance facts that store each performance point according to: 

o Sm 

o Pump number 
o Flow rate 
o Head 
o Power 
o eff 
o RPM 
o NPSHA 
o NPSHR 
o SEC 

o Acceptability

• Power: Power required to pump the slurry at the given flow rate and density. Power is 
typically measured in horsepower. 

• SEC: Specific energy consumption (SEC). Measurement of the power used to transport dry 
solid material at the given flow rate over the given pipeline length. SEC is typically 
measured in Hp-Hr/ton-mi. 


Performance points are then checked for 
cavitation. A rule is executed to identify pump- 
performance facts where the NPSHA is less than 
the NPSHR. Facts that satisfy this requirement 
are labeled as unacceptable and are output to the 
cavitation-output file in Table 1. 

This output information will signify which pump 
settings (RPM and S m ) for a particular pump will 
induce cavitation. 


Pump-performance facts that are not susceptible to cavitation are output as the acceptable pump 
performance points shown in Appendix B. PLOP produces the performance points for each 
pump at each pump RPM for each slurry relative density. 


To optimize pipeline operation efficiency, the 
pump RPM that produces the minimum 
specific energy consumption (SEC) for a 
given relative density is determined by 
PLOP. A rule within the PLOP program 
filters out the pump-performance fact for 
each pump at each relative density whose 
RPM corresponds to the minimum SEC 
value. These facts are then output as the 
optimum pump RPB settings shown in 
Table 2. Pump-performance facts that have 
insufficient NPSHA to prevent cavitation are 
omitted from this table even though they may 
correspond to a lower SEC. This output 
tabulates the optimum output efficiency that a 
pump can produce for a given pipeline 
system and slurry density. The SEC is 
defaulted to 999 for slurry relative densities 
of 1.0 since clear water would correspond to 
infinite specific energy consumption. 

Maximum pump efficiency does not necessarily correspond to minimum specific energy 
consumption. Slurry pumps, however, are designed to minimize this imbalance, and maximum 
attainable efficiency can correspond to the minimum SEC.

PLOP PROGRAM INPUT 
VALIDITY: The slurry transport 
text by Wilson el al. (1997) 
presents an example slurry pump 
curve that was used to verify the 
validity of the PLOP program by 
comparing the pump performance 
results obtained by both the PLOP 
program and by manual analytic 
solution. The example pump 
curve is shown in Figure 7. The 
example pipeline and material 
characteristics are as follows:

1.0 mm

Pipeline length

938 m 

Suction length 

= 

10 m 

Equivalent length 

= 

45.8 m 



For simplicity, the flow rate for the 
example is fixed at 1.9 m 3 /s. The pump 
performance parameters, shown in 
Table 3, were determined analytically and 
by the PLOP program. 


PLOP determined higher performance 
values for the example pump due to 
limitations associated with interpolation. 

However, the general consistency of the 
two solutions suggests the accuracy and validity of the PLOP program to a reasonable degree. 
The pump performance example is discussed in greater detail in Appendix C. 

RESULTS: Pipeline and slurry pump governing principles and theories were successfully 
implemented in the PLOP program. PLOP output was consistent with the example problem 
presented by Wilson et al. (1997) despite some variation. These results form an encouraging 
cornerstone in advancing the implementation of DODSS.

PLOP Capabilities/Limitations. Rules-based programming is the primary advantage of 
CLIPS towards this application. Slurry transport using centrifugal pumps is inherently a complex 
decision-making process. It is based not only on physical principles but also on widely accepted 
standards set by the industry. Expert languages such as CLIPS simplify decision-making 
programming through rules-based execution of input. CLIPS source code can be easily 
expanded upon without having to modify the existing source code. The PLOP program can be 
developed far more effectively and efficiently by building on the existing source code. The 
CLIPS source code for PLOP is shown in Appendix D. 

Further Developments. PLOP is suited for the decision-making process of slurry transport 
applications. Such decision-making parameters are quite vast in pipeline dredging. Further 
expansion of PLOP capability would be to include pipeline dredge factors included in CUTPRO 
such as bank efficiency and dredge efficiency (How much time and effort is actually spent 
transporting solids). Cost-effectiveness is an inherent decision-making process that considers 
cost factors other than transport efficiency such as unit cost/hour and mobilization/ 
demobilization costs. Such factors would be useful in determining the optimization for an entire 
pipeline operation. 

Currently, CLIPS is not capable of graphics output that is often helpful with pump applications. 
Any future endeavor to incorporate a graphic output associated with PLOP would require 
integrating the current PLOP program with graphical software. 

CONCLUSIONS: Studies conducted at ERDC have shown that in addition to performing 
conventional numerical procedures, CLIPS is capable of incorporating expert and heuristic 
knowledge into an application source code. Preliminary testing of PLOP indicates that further 
development of this program is warranted and the outline for future development is apparent.

;Description: 

;This CLIPS Code defines templates and facts for pump type suitability based on Wilson et al. Table 8.1. This defines the 
parameters in which certain pumps ;should operate based on industry standards. The main attributes associated with 
pump suitability are the maximum permissible discharge and suction ;velocities [m/s], deviation from the Best Efficiency 
Point (%), ;and impeller periphreal speed [m/s](speed at tip of impeller). The factors determining ;these parameters are 
the pump service ;class (1,2, 3, 4) and shell type (annular, semi-volute, etc.).FACTS ARE CALLED FROM PUMP- 
SHELL-ATTRIBUTES. FACTS
