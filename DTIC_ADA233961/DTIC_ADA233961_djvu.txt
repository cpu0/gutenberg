CHAPTER 1 


INTRODUCTION 


The Ada implementation described above was tested according to the 
Ada Validation Procedures [Pro90j against the Ada Standard [Ada83] 
using the current Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC). This 
Validation Summary Report (VSR) gives an account of the testing of 
this Ada implementation. For any technical terms used in this 
report, the reader is referred to [Pro90]. A detailed description 
of the ACVC may be found in the current ACVC User's Guide [UG8yj.

1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. 
The ACVC contains a collection of test programs structured into six 
test classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test 
name identifies the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and 
E tests are executable. Class B and class L tests are expected to 
produce errors at compile time and link time, respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and 
produce a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result when they are executed. Three Ada library units, the 
packages REPORT and SPPRT13, and the procedure CHECK_FILE are used 
for this purpose. The package REPORT also provides a set of 
identity functions used to defeat some compiler optimizations 
allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test objective. 
The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the Ad? 
Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents 
of text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 
of the Ada Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. If these units are not 
operating correctly, validation testing is discontinued. Class B 
tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled 
and the resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that 
all violations of the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class 
B tests contain legal Ada code which must not be flagged illegal 
by the compiler. This behavior is also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects 
violation of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately 
compiled units. Errors are expected at link time, and execution 
is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be 
replaced by implementation-specific values — for example, the 
largest integer. A list of the values used for this implementation 
is provided in Appendix A. In addition to these anticipated test 
modifications, additional changes may be required to remove 
unforeseen conflicts between the tests and implementation-dependent 
characteristics. The modifications required for this 
implementation are described in section 2.3. 

For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced 
by the AVF. This customization consists of making the 





modifications described in the preceding paragraph, removing 
withdrawn tests (see section 2.1) and, possibly some inapplicable 
tests (see Section 3.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each 
test of tne customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


2.1 WITHDRAWN TESTS 

Some tests are withdrawn by the AVO from the ACVC because they do 
not conform to the Ada Standard. The following 81 tests had been 
withdrawn by the Ada Validation Organization (AVO) at the time of 
validation testing. The rationale for withdrawing each test is 
available from either the AVO or the AVF. Tne publication date for 
this list of withdrawn tests is 90-10-12.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are 
irrelevant for a given Ada implementation. The inapplicability 
criteria for some tests are explained in documents issued by ISO 
and the AJPO known as Ada Issues and commonly referenced in the 
format Al-dddd. For this implementation, the following tests were 
inapplicable for the reasons indicated; references to Ada Issues 
are included as appropriate.

(603) 881-0247 

Testing of this Ada implementation was conducted at the 
customer's ~Ite by a validation team from the AVF. 

3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes 
each test of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada 
Programming Language Standard, whether the test is applicable or 
inapplicable; otherwise, the Ada Implementation fails the ACVC 
(Pro90]. 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result 
was obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language 
Standard. 


a) Total Number of Applicable Tests 3987 


3-1 





b) Total Number of Withdrawn Tests 81 

c) Processed Inapplicable Tests 102 

d) Non-Processed I/O Tests 0 

e) Non-Processed Floating-Point 

Precision Tests 0 


f) Total Number of Inapplicable Tests 102 (c+d+e) 

g) Total Number of Tests for ACVC 1.11 4170 (a+b+f) 


All I/O tests of the test suite were processed because this 
implementation supports a file system. All floating-point 
precision tests were processed because this implementation supports 
floating-point precision to the extent that was tested. When this 
compiler was tested, the tests listed in section 2.1 had been 
withdrawn because of test errors. 


3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

Version 1.11 of the ACVC comprises 4170 tests. When this 
compiler was tested, the tests listed in section 2.1 had been 
withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF determined that 102 
tests were inapplicable to this implementation. All inapplicable 
tests were processed during validation testing. 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 
1.3) was taken on-site by the validation team for processing. 
The contents of the magnetic tape were loaded directly onto the 
host computer. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host computer, the full 
set of tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 

The tests were compiled and linked on the host computer system, 
as appropriate. The executable images were executed on the 
host/target computer system. The results were captured on the 
host computer system. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the 
customer and reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for 
a complete listing of the processing options for this 
implementation. It also indicates the default options. The 
options invoked explicitly for validation testing during this 
test were: 

/NOANALYSIS_DATA 

/CHECK 

/C0PY_S0URCE 

/NODEBUG 

/NODESIGN

/LIBRARY=ADA$LIB 

/LIST 

/LOAD 

/NOMACHINE_CODE 

/NOTE_SOURCE 

/OPTIMIZE 

/NOSHOW 

/NOSYNTAX_ONLY 

/WARNINGS=default 


Test output, compiler and linker listings, and job logs were 
captured on magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. Selected 
listings examined on-site by the validation team were also 
archived.

APPENDIX A 


MACRO PARAMETERS 


This appendix contains the macro parameters used for customizing the 
ACVC. The meaning and purpose of these parameters are explained in 
[UG89]. The parameter values are presented in two tables. The first 
table lists the values that are defined in terms of the maximum input¬ 
line length, which is 255 the value for $MAX_IN_LEN—also listed here. 
These values are expressed here as Ada string aggregates, where "V" 
represents the maximum input-line length.

APPENDIX B 


COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


The compiler options of this Ada implementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to compiler documentation 
and not to this report. 

. /ANALYSIS_DATA or /NOANALYSIS_DATA 

Controls whether a data analysis file containing source code cross- 
referencing and static analysis information is created. The default 
is /NOANALYSIS_DATA. 

/CHECK or /NOCHECK 

Controls whether run-time error checking is suppressed. (Use of 
/NOCHECK is equivalent to giving all possible suppress pragmas in the 
source program.) The default is /CHECK (error checking is not 
suppressed except by pragma). 

/COPY_SOURCE or /NOCOPY_SOURCE 

Controls whether the source being compiled is copied into the 
compilation library for a successful compilation. The default is 
/COPY_SOURCE. 

/DEBUG or /NODEBUG or /DEBUG=option 
where option is one of 

ALL, SYMBOLS or NOSYMBOLS, TRACEBACK or NOTRACEBACK, or NONE 

Controls the inclusion of debugging symbol table information in the 
compiled object module. The default is /DEBUG or, equivalently, 
/DEBUG=ALL. 

/DESIGN or /NODESIGN 

Controls whether the input file is processed as a design or compiled 
as an Ada source. The default is /NODESIGN, in which case the file 
is compiled. 

/DIAGNOSTICS, /DIAGNOCTICS=filename, or /NODIAGNOSTICD 

Controls whether a special diagnostics file is produced for use with 
the VAX Language-Sensitive Editor (a separate DIGITAL product). The 


B-l 






default is /NODIAGNOSTICS. 

/ERROR_LIMIT=n 

Controls the number of error level diagnostics that are allowed within 
a single compilation unit before the compilation is aborted. The 
default is /ERROR_LIMIT=30. 

/LIBRARY=directory-name 

Specifies the name of the Ada compilation library to be used as the 
context for the compilation. The default is the library last 
established by the ACS SET LIBRARY command. 

/LIST, /LIST=filename, or /NOLIST 

Controls whether a listing file is produced. /LIST without a filename 
uses a default filename of the form sourcename.LIS, where sourcename 
is the name of the source file being compiled. The default is /NOLIST 
(for both interactive and batch mode). 

/LOAD or /NOLOAD 

Controls whether the current program library is updated with 
succesfully processed units contained in the source file. The default 
is /LOAD. 

/MACHINE_CODE or /NOMACHINE_CODE 

Controls whether generated machine code (approximating assembler 
notation) is included in the listing file, if produced. The default 
is /NOMACHINE_CODE. 

/NOTE_SOURCE or /NONOTE_SOURCE 

Controls whither the file specification of the current source file is 
noted in the compilation library. (This copy is used for certain 
automated (re)compilation features.) The default is /NOTE_SOURCE. 

/OPTIMIZE or /NOOPTIMIZE 

Controls whether full or minimal optimization is applied in producing 
the compiled code. The default is /OPTIMIZE. (/NOOPTIMIZE is 
primarily of use in combination with /DEBUG.) 


B-2 








/SYNTAX or /NOSYNTAX_ONLY 

Controls whether a syntax check only is performed. The default is 
/NOSYNTAX_ONLY, which indicates that full processing is done. 

/SHOW=PORTABILITY or /NOSHOW 

Controls whether a portability summary is included in the listing. 
The default is /SHOW=PORTABILITY. 

/WARNINGS=(category:destination,...) 

Specifies which categories of informational and warning level messages 
are displayed for which destinations. The categories can be WARNINGS, 
WEAK_WARNINGS, SUPPLEMENTAL, COMPILATION_NOTES AND STATUS. The 
destinations can be ALL, NONE or combinations of TERMINAL, LISTING or 
DIAGNOSTICS. The default is 

/WARNINGS=(WARN:ALL,WEAK:ALL,SUPP:ALL,COMP:NONE,STAT: LIST) 


B-3 





LINKER OPTIONS

Predefined Language Pragmas 


This annex defines the pragmas LIST, PAGE, and OPTIMIZE, and summarizes 
the definitions given elsewhere of the remaining language-defined pragmas. 

The VAX Ada pragmas IDENT and TITLE are also defined in this annex. 


Pragma Meaning 

AST_ENTRY Takes the simple name of a single 

entry as the single argument; at most 
one AST_ENTRY pragma is allowed 
for any given entry. This pragma 
must be used in combination with the 
AST_ENTRY attribute, and is only 
allowed after the entry declaration and 
in the same task type specification or 
single task as the entry to which it 
applies. This pragma specifies that the 
given entry may be used to handle a 
VMS asynchronous system trap (AST) 
resulting from a VMS system service 
call. The pragma does not affect 
normal use of the entry (see 9.12a). 

CONTROLLED Takes the simple name of an access 

type as the single argument. This 
pragma is only allowed immediately 
within the declarative part or package 
specification that contains the 
declaration of the access type; the 
declaration must occur before the 
pragma. This pragma is not allowed for 


Predefined Language Pragmas 1-1 







a derived type. This pragma specifies 
that automatic storage reclamation 
must not be performed for objects 
designated by values of the access type, 
except upon leaving the innermost 
block statement, subprogram body, or 
task body that encloses the access type 
declaration, or after leaving the main 
program (see 4.8). 

3 ELABORATE Takes one or more simple names 

denoting library units as arguments. 
This pragma is only allowed 
immediately after the context clause 
of a compilation unit (before the 
subsequent library unit or secondary 
unit). Each argument must be 
the simple name of a library unit 
mentioned by the context clause. 

This pragma specifies that the 
corresponding library unit body 
must be elaborated before the 
given compilation unit. If the given 
compilation unit is a subunit, the 
library unit body must be elaborated 
before the body of the ancestor library 
unit of the subunit (see 10.5). 

EXPORT_EXCEPTION Takes an internal name denoting 

an exception, and optionally takes 
an external designator (the name 
of a VMS Linker global symbol), 
a form (ADA or VMS), and a code 
(a static integer expression that is 
interpreted as a VAX condition code) 
as arguments. A code value must be 
specified when the form is VMS (the 
default if the form is not specified). 

This pragma is only allowed at the 
place of a declarative item, and must 
apply to an exception declared by 
an earlier declarative item of the 
same declarative part or package 
specification; it is not allowed for an 
exception declared with a renaming 
declaration or for an exception declared 


1-2 Predefined Language Pragmas 





in a generic unit. This pragma permits 
an Ada exception to be handled 
by programs written in other VAX 
languages (see 13.9a.3.2). 

Takes an internal name denoting 
a function, and optionally takes an 
external designator (the name of a 
VMS Linker global symbol), parameter 
types, and result type as arguments. 
This pragma is only allowed at the 
place of a declarative item, and 
must apply to a function declared 
by an earlier declarative item of the 
same declarative part or package 
specification. In the case of a function 
declared as a compilation unit, the 
pragma is only allowed after the 
function declaration and before any 
subsequent compilation unit. This 
pragma is not allowed for a function 
declared with a renaming declaration, 
and it is not allowed for a generic 
function (it may be given for a generic 
instantiation). This pragma permits 
an Ada function to be called from 
a program written in another VAX 
language (see 13.9a.l.4). 

Takes an internal name denoting an 
object, and optionally takes an external 
designator (the name of a VMS Linker 
global symbol) and size designator 
(a VMS Linker global symbol whose 
value is the size, in bytes, of the 
exported object) as arguments. This 
pragma is only allowed at the place of 
a declarative item at the outermost 
level of a library package specification 
or body, and must apply to a variable 
declared by an earlier declarative 
item of the same package specification 
or body, the variable must be of a 
type or subtype that has a constant 
size at compile time. This pragma is 
not allowed for objects declared with 


Predefined Language Pragmas 1-3 






a renaming declaration, and is not 
allowed in a generic unit. This pragma 
permits an Ada object to be referred to 
by a routine written in another VAX 
language (see 13.9a.2.2). 

EXPORT_PROCEDURE Takes an internal name denoting 

a procedure, and optionally takes 
an external designator (the name 
of a VMS Linker global symbol) 
and parameter types as arguments. 
This pragma is only allowed at the 
place of a declarative item, and must 
apply to a procedure declared by 
an earlier declarative item of the 
same declarative part or package 
specification. In the case of a procedure 
declared as a compilation unit, the 
pragma is only allowed after the 
procedure declaration and before 
any subsequent compilation unit. 

This pragma is not allowed for a 
procedure declared with a renaming 
declaration, and is not allowed for a 
generic procedure (it may be given for 
a generic instantiation). This pragma 
permits an Ada routine to be called 
from a program written in another VAX 
language (see 13.9a.l.4). 

EXPORT_VALUED_PROCEDURE Takes an internal name denoting 

a procedure, and optionally takes 
an external designator (the name 
of a VMS Linker global symbol) 
and parameter types as arguments. 
This pragma is only allowed at the 
place of a declarative item, and must 
apply to a procedure declared by 
an earlier declarative item of the 
same declarative part or package 
specification. In the case of a procedure 
declared as a compilation unit, the 
pragma is only allowed after the 
procedure declaration and before any 
subsequent compilation unit. The first 
(or only) parameter of the procedure 


1-4 Predefined Language Pragmas 







IDENT 


IMPORT 


must be of mode out. This pragma is 
not allowed for a procedure declared 
with a renaming declaration and is not 
allowed for a generic procedure (it may 
be given for a generic instantiation). 
This pragma permits an Ada procedure 
to behave as a function that both 
returns a value and causes side effects 
on its parameters when it is called 
from a routine written in another VAX 
language (see 13.9a.l.4). 

Takes a string literal of 31 or fewer 
characters as the single argument. The 
pragma IDENT has the following form: 

pragma IDENT (string_literal); 

This pragma is allowed only in 
the outermost declarative part or 
declarative items of a compilation unit. 
The given string is used to identify 
the object module associated with the 
compilation unit in which the pragma 
IDENT occurs. 

EXCEPTION Takes an internal name denoting an 

exception, and optionally takes an 
external designator (the name of a 
VMS Linker global symbol), a form 
(ADA or VMS), and a code (a static 
integer expression that is interpreted 
as a VAX condition code) as arguments. 
A code value is allowed only when the 
form is VMS (the default if the form 
is not specified). This pragma is only 
allowed at the place of a declarative 
item, and must apply to an exception 
declared by an earlier declarative item 
of the same declarative part or package 
specification; it is not allowed for an 
exception declared with a renaming 
declaration. This pragma permits a 
non-Ada exception (most notably, a 
VAX condition) to be handled by an 
Ada program (see 13.9a.3.1). 


Predefined Language Pragmas 1-5 





Takes an internal name denoting 
a function, and optionally takes an 
external designator (the name of a 
VMS Linker global symbol), parameter 
types, parameter mechanisms, result 
mechanism, and a first optional 
parameter as arguments. The pragma 
INTERFACE must be used with this 
pragma (see 13.9). This pragma is only 
allowed at the place of a declarative 
item, and must apply to a function 
declared by an earlier declarative 
item of the same declarative part or 
package specification. In the case of 
a function declared as a compilation 
unit, the pragma is only allowed after 
the function declaration and before 
any subsequent compilation unit. 

This pragma is allowed for a function 
declared with a renaming declaration; 
it is not allowed for a generic function 
or a generic function instantiation. 

This pragma permits a non-Ada 
routine to be used as an Ada function 
(see 13.9a.l.l). 

Takes an internal name denoting an 
object, and optionally takes an external 
designator (the name of a VMS Linker 
global symbol) and size (a VMS Linker 
global symbol whose value is the 
size in bytes of the imported object) 
as arguments. This pragma is only 
allowed at the place of a declarative 
item at the outermost level of a library 
package specification or body, and must 
apply to a variable declared by an 
earlier declarative item of the same 
package specification or body; the 
variable must be of a type or subtype 
that has a constant size at compile 
time. This pragma is not allowed 
for objects declared with a renaming 
declaration, and is not allowed in a 
generic unit. This pragma permits 
storage declared in a non-Ada routine 



IMPORT_PROCEDURE 


to be referred to by an Ada program 
(see 13.9a.2.1). 

Takes an internal name denoting a 
procedure, and optionally takes an 
external designator (the name of a 
VMS Linker global symbol), parameter 
types, parameter mechanisms, and a 
first optional parameter as arguments. 
The pragma INTERFACE must be 
used with this pragma (see 13.9). 

This pragma is only allowed at the 
place of a declarative item, and must 
apply to a procedure declared by 
an earlier declarative item of the 
same declarative part or package 
specification. In the case of a procedure 
declared as a compilation unit, the 
pragma is only allowed after the 
procedure declaration and before any 
subsequent compilation unit. This 
pragma is allowed for a procedure 
declared with a renaming declaration; 
it is not allowed for a generic procedure 
or a generic procedure instantiation. 
This pragma permits a non-Ada routine 
to be used as an Ada procedure (see 
13.9a.l.l). 

IMPORT_VALUED_PROCEDURE Takes an internal name denoting a 

procedure, and optionally takes an 
external designator (the name of a 
VMS Linker global symbol), parameter 
types, parameter mechanisms, and a 
first optional parameter as arguments. 
The pragma INTERFACE must be 
used with this pragma (see 13.9). 

This pragma is only allowed at the 
place of a declarative item, and must 
apply to a procedure declared by 
an earlier declarative item of the 
same declarative part or package 
specification. In the case of a procedure 
declared as a compilation unit, the 
pragma is only allowed after the 
procedure declaration and before any 


Predefined Language Pragmas 1-7 






INLINE 


INLINE. 


subsequent compilation unit. The first 
(or only) parameter of the procedure 
must be of mode out. This pragma 
is allowed for a procedure declared 
with a renaming declaration; it is not 
allowed for a generic procedure. This 
pragma permits a non-Ada routine that 
returns a value and causes side effects 
on its parameters to be used as an Ada 
procedure (see 13.9a.1.1). 

Takes one or more names as 
arguments; each name is either the 
name of a subprogram or the name of 
a generic subprogram. This pragma 
is only allowed at the place of a 
declarative item in a declarative part 
or package specification, or after a 
library unit in a compilation, but before 
any subsequent compilation unit. This 
pragma specifies that the subprogram 
bodies should be expanded inline at 
each call whenever possible; in the case 
of a generic subprogram, the pragma 
applies to calls of its instantiations (see 
6.3.2). 

GENERIC Takes one or more names as 

arguments; each name is either the 
name of a generic declaration or the 
name of an instance of a generic 
declaration. This pragma is only 
allowed at the place of a declarative 
item in a declarative part or package 
specification, or after a library unit 
in a compilation, but before any 
subsequent compilation unit. Each 
argument must be the simple name 
of a generic subprogram or package, 
or a (nongeneric) subprogram or 
package that is an instance of a generic 
subprogram or package declared by 
an earlier declarative item of the 
same declarative part or package 
specification. This pragma specifies 
that inline expansion of the generic

LONG.FLOAT 


body is desired for each instantiation 
of the named generic declarations or 
of the particular named instances; 
the pragma does not apply to calls of 
instances of generic subprograms (see 
12.1a). 

Takes a language name and a 
subprogram name as arguments. This 
pragma is allowed at the place of a 
declarative item, and must apply in 
this case to a subprogram declared 
by an earlier declarative item of the 
same declarative part or package 
specification. This pragma is also 
allowed for a library unit; in this case 
the pragma must appear after the 
subprogram declaration, and before 
any subsequent compilation unit. This 
pragma specifies the other language 
(and thereby the calling conventions) 
and informs the compiler that an 
object module will be supplied for the 
corresponding subprogram (see 13.9). 

In VAX Ada, the pragma INTERFACE 
is required in combination with the 
pragmas IMPORT.FUNCTION, 
IMPORT.PROCEDURE, and 
IMPORTVALUED.PROCEDURE 
when any of those pragmas are used 
(see 13.9a.l). 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or 
OFF as the single argument. This 
pragma is allowed anywhere a pragma 
is allowed. It specifies that listing of 
the compilation is to be continued or 
suspended until a LIST pragma with 
the opposite argument is given within 
the same compilation. The pragma 
itself is always listed if the compiler is 
producing a listing. 

Takes either D_FLOAT or G_FLOAT 
as the single argument. The default 
is G_FLOAT. This pragma is only 


Predefined Language Pragmas 1-9 






allowed at the start of a compilation, 
before the first compilation unit (if 
any) of the compilation. It specifies 
the choice of representation to be used 
for the predefined type LONG_FLOAT 
in the package STANDARD, and for 
floating point type declarations with 
digits specified in the range 7.. 15 (see 
3.5.7a). 

Takes one or two nonnegative static 
simple expressions of some integer type 
as arguments. This pragma is only 
allowed in the outermost declarative 
part of a library subprogram; at most 
one such pragma is allowed in a library 
subprogram. It has an effect only when 
the subprogram to which it applies is 
used as a main program. This pragma 
causes a fixed-size stack to be created 
for a main task (the task associated 
with a main program), and determines 
the number of storage units (bytes) 
to be allocated for the stack working 
storage area or guard pages or both. 
The value specified for either or both 
the working storage area and guard 
pages is rounded up to an integral 
number of pages. A value of zero for 
the working storage area results in the 
use of a default size; a value of zero for 
the guard pages results in no guard 
storage. A negative value for either 
working storage or guard pages causes 
the pragma to be ignored (see 13.2b). 

Takes a numeric literal as the single 
argument. This pragma is only allowed 
at the start of a compilation, before the 
first compilation unit (if any) of the 
compilation. The effect of this pragma 
is to use the value of the specified 
numeric literal for the definition of the 
named number MEMORY_SIZE (see 
13.7). 






OPTIMIZE 


PACK 


PAGE 


PRIORITY 


PSECT.OBJECT 


Takes one of the identifiers TIME 
or SPACE as the single argument. 

This pragma is only allowed within a 
declarative part and it applies to the 
block or body enclosing the declarative 
part. It specifies whether time or space 
is the primary optimization criterion. 

In VAX Ada, this pragma is only 
allowed immediately within a 
declarative part of a body declaration. 

Takes the simple name of a record or 
array type as the single argument. The 
allowed positions for this pragma, and 
the restrictions on the named type, 
are governed by the same rules as for 
a representation clause. The pragma 
specifies that storage minimization 
should be the main criterion when 
selecting the representation of the 
given type (see 13.1). 

This pragma has no argument, and is 
allowed anywhere a pragma is allowed. 
It specifies that the program text which 
follows the pragma should start on a 
new Dape ''if th? comniler is currently 
producing a listing). 

Takes a static expression of the 
predefined integer subtype PRIORITY 
as the single argument. This pragma is 
only allowed within the specification of 
a task unit or immediately within the 
outermost declarative part of a main 
program. It specifies the priority of the 
task (or tasks of the task type) or the 
priority of the main program (see 9.8). 

Takes an internal name denoting 
an object, and optionally takes an 
external designator (the name of a 
program section) and a size (a VMS 
Linker global symbol whose value 
is interpreted as the size, in bytes, 
of the exported/imported object) as 
arguments. This pragma is only 


Predefined Language Pragmas 1-11 





i2 SHARED 


SHARE.GENERIC 


allowed at the place of a declarative 
item at the outermost level of a library 
package specification or body, and must 
apply to a variable declared by an 
earlier declarative item of the same 
package specification or body; the 
variable must be of a type or subtype 
that has a constant size at compile 
time. This pragma is not allowed for 
an object declared with a renaming 
declaration, and is not allowed in a 
generic unit. This pragma enables the 
shared use of objects that are stored 
in overlaid program sections (see 
13.9a.2.3). 

Takes the simple name of a variable as 
the single argument. This pragma is 
allowed only for a variable declared by 
an object declaration and whose type 
is a scalar or access type; the variable 
declaration and the pragma must 
both occur (in this order) immediately 
within the same declarative part or 
package specification. This pragma 
specifies that every read or update of 
the variable is a synchronization point 
for that variable. An implementation 
must restrict the objects for which 
this pragma is allowed to objects 
for which each of direct reading and 
direct updating is implemented as an 
indivisible operation (see 9.11). 

Takes one or more names as 
arguments; each name is either the 
name of a generic declaration or the 
name of an instance of a generic 
declaration. This pragma is only 
allowed at the place of a declarative 
item in a declarative part or package 
specification, or after a library unit 
in a compilation, but before any 
subsequent compilation unit. Each 
argument must be the simple name 
of a generic subprogram or package. 


1-12 Predefined Language Pragmas 







3 STORAGE_UNIT 


SUPPRESS 


or a (nongeneric) subprogram or 
package that is an instance of a generic 
subprogram or package declared by 
an earber declarative item of the 
same declarative part or package 
specification. This pragma specifies 
that generic code sharing is desired for 
each instantiation of the named generic 
declarations or of the particular named 
instances (see 12.1b). 

Takes a numeric literal as the single 
argument. This pragma is only allowed 
at the start of a compilation, before the 
first compilation unit (if any) of the 
compilation. The effect of this pragma 
is to use the value of the specified 
numeric literal for the definition of the 
named number STORAGE_UNIT (see 
13.7). 

In VAX Ada, the only argument 
allowed for this pragma is 8 (bits). 

Takes as arguments the identifier 
of a check and optionally also the 
name of either an object, a type or 
subtype, a subprogram, a task unit, or 
a generic unit. This pragma is only 
allowed either immediately within a 
declarative part or immediately within 
a package specification. In the latter 
case, the only allowed form is with a 
name that denotes an entity (or several 
overloaded subprograms) declared 
immediately within the package 
specification. The permission to omit 
the given check extends from the 
place of the pragma to the end of the 
declarative region associated with the 
innermost enclosing block statement or 
program unit. For a pragma given in a 
package specification, the permission 
extends to the end of the scope of the 
named entity. 


Predefined Language Pragmas 1-13 




SUPPRESS. ALL 


SYSTEM.NAME 


TASK.STORAGE 


If the pragma includes a name, the 
permission to omit the given check 
is further restricted: it is given only 
for operations on the named object 
or on all objects of the base type of a 
named type or subtype; for calls of a 
named subprogram; for activations of 
tasks of the named task type; or for 
instantiations of the given generic unit 
(see 11.7). 

This pragma has no argument and is 
only allowed following a compilation 
unit. This pragma specifies that 
all run-time checks in the unit are 
suppressed (see 11.7). 

Takes an enumeration literal as the 
single argument. This pragma is only 
allowed at the start of a compilation, 
before the first compilation unit (if 
any) of the compilation. The effect of 
this pragma is to use the enumeration 
literal with the specified identifier 
for the definition of the constant 
SYSTEM.NAME. This pragma is 
only allowed if the specified identifier 
corresponds to one of the literals of the 
type NAME declared in the package 
SYSTEM 
(see 13.7). 

Takes the simple name of a task 
type and a static expression of some 
integer type as arguments. This 
pragma is allowed anywhere that a 
task storage specification is allowed; 
that is, the declaration of the task 
type to which the pragma applies and 
the pragma must both occur (in this 
order) immediately within the same 
declarative part, package specification, 
or task specification. The effect of 
this pragma is to use the value of the 
expression as the number of storage 
units (bytes) to be allocated as guard 
storage. The value is rounded up to 


1-14 Predefined Language Pragmas 






an integral number of pages: a value 
of zero results in no guard storage; a 
negative value causes the pragma to be 
ignored (see 13.2a). 


Predefined Language Pragmas 1-15 






TIME.SLICE 


TITLE 


VOLATILE 


1-16 Predefined Language Pragmas 


Takes a static expression of the 
predefined fixed point type DURATION 
(in the package STANDARD) as the 
single argument. This pragma is only 
allowed in the outermost declarative 
part of a library subprogram, and at 
most one such pragma is allowed in a 
library subprogram. It has an effect 
only when the subprogram to which 
it applies is used as a main program. 
This pragma specifies the nominal 
amount of elapsed time permitted for 
the execution of a task when other 
tasks of the same priority are also 
eligible for execution. A positive, 
nonzero value of the static expression 
enables round-robin scheduling for all 
tasks in the subprogram; a negative or 
zero value disables it (see 9.8a). 

Takes a title or a subtitle string, or 
both, as arguments. The pragma 
TITLE has the following form: 

pragma TITLE (titling-option 
[,titling-option]); 

titling-option := 

[TITLE =>] string_literal 
I [SUBTITLE =>] string_literal 

This pragma is allowed anywhere a 
pragma is allowed; the given strings 
supersede the default title and/or 
subtitle portions of a compilation 
listing. 

Takes the simple name of a variable 
as the single argument. This pragma 
is only allowed for a variable declared 
by an object declaration. The variable 
declaration and the pragma must 
both occur (in this order) immediately 
within the same declarative part or 
package specification. The pragma 
must appear before any occurrence 
of the name of the variable other 
than in an address clause or in one 
of the VAX Ada pragmas IMPORT_ 






OBJECT, EXPORT_OBJECT, or 
PSECT_OBJECT. The variable cannot 
be declared by a renaming declaration. 
The pragma VOLATILE specifies 
that the variable may be modified 
asynchronously. This pragma instructs 
the compiler to obtain the value of a 
variable from memory each time it is 
used (see 9.11).

F.4 Restrictions on Representation Clauses 

The representation clauses allowed in VAX Ada are length, enumeration, 
record representation, and address clauses. 

In VAX Ada, a representation clause for a generic formal type or a type that 
depends on a generic formal type is not allowed. In addition, a representation 
clause for a composite type that has a component or subcomponent of a generic 
formal type or a type derived from a generic formal type is not allowed. 

F.5 Restrictions on Unchecked Type Conversions 

VAX Ada supports the generic function UNCHECKED_CONVERSION with 
the following restrictions on the class of types involved: 

■ The actual subtype corresponding to the formal type TARGET must not be 
an unconstrained array type. 

■ The actual subtype corresponding to the formal type TARGET must not be 
an unconstrained type with discriminants. 


Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 2-7 





Further, when the target type is a type with discriminants, the value resulting 
from a call of the conversion function resulting from an instantiation of 
UNCHECKED_CONVERSION is checked to ensure that the discriminants 
satisfy the constraints of the actual subtype. 

If the size of the source value is greater than the size of the target subtype, 
then the high order bits of the value are ignored (truncated); if the size of 
the source value is less than the size of the target subtype, then the value is 
extended with zero bits to form the result value. 

F.6 Conventions for Implementation-Generated Names 
Denoting Implementation-Dependent Components in 
Record Representation Clauses 

VAX Ada does not allocate implementation-dependent components in records. 

F.7 Interpretation of Expressions Appearing in Address 
Clauses 

Expressions appearing in address clauses must be of the type ADDRESS 
defined in the package SYSTEM (see 13.7a.l and F.3). In VAX Ada, values 
of type SYSTEMADDRESS are interpreted as virtual addresses in the VAX 
address space. 

VAX Ada allows address clauses for objects (see 13.5). 

VAX Ada does not support interrupts as defined in section 13.5.1. VAX Ada 
does provide the pragma AST_ENTRY and the AST_ENTRY attribute as 
alternative mechanisms for handling asynchronous interrupts from the VMS 
operating system (see 9.12a). 

F.8 Implementation-Dependent Characteristics of 
Input-Output Packages 

The VAX Ada predefined packages and their operations are implemented 
using VMS Record Management Services (RMS) file organizations and 
facilities, lb give users the maximum benefit of the underlying VMS RMS 
input-output facilities, VAX Ada provides packages in addition to the packages 
SEQUENTLALJO, DIRECT.IO, TEXTJO. and IO.EXCEPTIONS, and VAX 
Ada accepts VMS RMS File Definition Language (FDL) statements in form 
strings. The following sections summarize the implementation-dependent 
characteristics of the VAX Ada input-output packages. The VAX Ada Run-Time 
Reference Manual discusses these characteristics in more detail. 


2-® Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 






F.8.1 Additional VAX Ada Input-Output Packages 

In addition to the language-defined input-output packages (SEQUENTIAL JO, 
DIRECT_IO, and TEXT_IO), VAX Ada provides the following input-output 
packages: 

■ RELATIVEJO (see 14.2a.3). 

■ INDEXEDJO (see 14.2a.5). 

a SEQUENTIAL_MIXED_IO (see 14.2b.4). 
a DIRECT JrfEXED JO (see 14.2b.6). 
a RELATIVE_MIXEDJO (see 14.2b.8). 
a INDEXED_MIXEDJO (see 14.2b. 10). 

VAX Ada does not provide the package LOW_LEVEL_IO. 

F.8.2 Auxiliary input-Output Exceptions 

VAX Ada defines the exceptions needed by the packages RELATIVE_IO, 
INDEXEDJO, RELATIVE.MIXEDJO, and INDEXED_MIXED_IO in the 
package AUXJO.EXCEPTIONS (see 14.5a). 

F.8.3 Interpretation of the FORM Parameter 

The value of the FORM parameter for the OPEN and CREATE procedures of 
each input-output package may be a string whose value is interpreted as a 
sequence of statements of the VAX Record Management Services (RMS) File 
Definition Language (FDL), or it may be a string whose value is interpreted as 
the name of an external file containing FDL statements. 

The use of the FORM parameter is described for each input-output package in 
chapter 14. For information on the default FORM parameters for each VAX 
Ada input-output package and for information on using the FORM parameter 
to specify ex' .mal file attributes, see the VAX Ada Run-Time Reference 
Manual. For information on FDL, see the Guide to VMS File Applications and 
the VMS File Definition Language Facility Manual. 

F.8.4 Implementation-Dependent Input-Output Error 
Conditions 

As specified in section 14.4, VAX Ada raises the following language-defined 
exceptions for error conditions that occur during input-output operations: 
STATUS.ERROR, MODE.ERROR, NAME.ERROR, USE.ERROR, END_ 
ERROR, DATAJSRROR, and LAYOUTJSRROR. In addition, VAX Ada raises 
the following exceptions for relative and indexed input-output operations: 
LOCKJERROR, EXISTENCE.ERROR, and KEY.ERROR. VAX Ada does not 
raise the language-defined exception DEVICE_ERROR; device-related error 
conditions cause the exception USEJSRROR to be raised. 


Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 2-9 







The exception USE_ERROR is raised under the following conditions: 

■ If the capacity of the external file has been exceeded. 

■ In all CREATE operations if the mode specified is IN_FILE. 

■ In all CREATE operations if the file attributes specified by the FORM 
parameter are not supported by the package. 

■ In all CREATE, OPEN, DELETE, and RESET operations if, for the 
specified mode, the environment does not support the operation for an 
external file. 

■ In all NAME operations if the file has no name. 

■ In the WRITE operations on relative or indexed files if the element in the 
position indicated has already been written. 

■ In the DELETE_ELEMENT operations on relative and indexed files if the 
current element is undefined at the start of the operation. 

■ In the UPDATE operations on indexed files if the current element is 
undefined or if the specified key violates the external file attributes. 

■ In the SET_LINE_LENGTH and SET_PAGE_LENGTH operations on text 
files if the lengths specified are inappropriate for the external file. 

• In text files if an operation is attempted that is not possible for reasons 
that depend on characteristics of the external file. 

The exception NAME_ERROR is raised as specified in section 14.4: by a call 
of a CREATE or OPEN procedure if the string given for the NAME parameter 
does not allow the identification of an external file. In VAX Ada, the value of 
a NAME parameter can be a string that denotes a VMS file specification or 
a VMS logical name (in either case, the string names an external file). For a 
CREATE procedure, the value of a NAME parameter can also be a null string, 
in which case it names a temporary external file that is deleted when the main 
program exits. The VAX Ada Run-Time Reference Manual explains the naming 
of external files in more detail. 

F.9 Other Implementation Characteristics 

Implementation characteristics relating to the definition of a main program, 
various numeric ranges, and implementation limits are summarized in the 
following sections. 


2-10 Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 






F.9.1 Definition of a Main Program 

A main program can be a library unit subprogram under the following 
conditions: 

■ If it is a procedure with no formal parameters. In this case, the status 
returned to the VMS environment upon normal completion of the procedure 
is the value 1. 

■ If it is a function with no formal parameters whose returned value is of a 
discrete type. In this case, the status returned to the VMS environment 
upon normal completion of the function is the function value. 

a If it is a procedure declared with the pragma EXPORT_VALUED_ 
PROCEDURE, and it has one formal out parameter that is of a discrete 
type. In this case, the status returned to the VMS environment upon 
normal completion of the procedure is the value of the first (and only) 
parameter. 

Note that when a main function or a main procedure declared with the pragma 
EXPORT_VALUED_PROCEDURE returns a discrete value whose size is less 
than 32 bits, the value is zero- or sign-extended as appropriate. 

F.9.2 Values of Integer Attributes 

The ranges of values for integer types declared in the package STANDARD are 
as follows: 

SHORT_SHORT_INTEGER -128 .. 127 

SHORTJNTEGER -32768 .. 32767 

INTEGER -2147483648 .. 2147483647 

For the packages DIRECTJO, RELATIVE.IO, SEQUENTIAL_MIXED_IO, 
DIRECT.MIXEDJO, RELATIVE_MIXED_IO, INDEXED_MIXED_IO, and 
TEXT_IO, the ranges of values for the types COUNT and POSITIVE_COUNT 
are as follows: 

COUNT 0 .. 2147483647 

POSITIVE.COUNT 1 .. 2147483647 

For the package TEXT_IO, the range of values for the type FIELD is as follows: 
FIELD 0 .. 2147483647
