Introduction 

One of the claims made fcy proponents of Ada is that Ada software is 
highly reusable. The fact that specifications are compiled and 
accessible would make reusability seen easily achievable. However, 
specifications give only a limited amount of information about a 
package; moreover, a specification cannot help determine whether a 
package "worked", or how well it worked. 

This problem has led to the concept of "certifying” Ada, parts for 
reuse; that is, determining the worthiness of a part as a reusable 
component. This paper addresses issues that are critical to reuse: 
the characterization of part performance, design for reuse, and 
correct utilization of parts. Ohe paper will then address current 
areas of study beneficial in the development of a certification 
process.

Characteri zation of Part Performance 


Ada has two features which support reusability: specification 

compilation and the ability to declare instantiations of generic 
units. Ada specifications allow a part's interfaces to be defined, 
but are not sufficient for defining reuse. It is important to have 
information about a part's performance in a reuse operation to 
determine computational requirements, accuracy of calculations, etc. 

Performance is not something that is easily quantified; however, 
attributes associated with performance are definable. A part's 
performance is definable fcy its behavior, or intended function, and 
the computational resources it extracts from the system when 
executing. These attributes are directly related, and not 
independent. They must be considered in the soope of both normal 
processing and exception handling. 

The explicit separation of exception handling and normal processing 
is essential for modularization. Without exceptions, nested flags 
are required for error recovery management. This leads to the 
intermingling of error (i.e. exceptions) and normal processing, 
which leads to unmanageable code. Ada provides for the separation 
of exception handling and normal processing, and this separation is 
mandatory for parts reuse. 

Exception handling consists of three steps: exception detection, 

correction, and recovery. These steps should be handled at 
different places in a software system. The exceptions that are 
raised, and the method of handling those exceptions, are not 
contained in a package specification. This information is essential 
to the part certification process. 

Row exceptions are handled determines the behavior of an Ada part 
and affects the performance of that part. The detection, 
correction, and recovery philosophy of a system has direct bearing 
on the computational requirements of that qrstem, as does frequency 
of exceptions. Subjects such as recovery vs. restart and process 
synchronization must be addressed. Exception handling 
standardization could be an important factor in the certification 
process. 

GENERICS 

Generic programming seems to provide a logical approach to the 
certification of reusable software. However, sane obstacles to 
reusability, such as exception handling, still exist. 
Specifications for generics give no more information concerning the 
behavior or performance of the corresponding body than 
specifications of packages, subprograms, or tasks. Since Ada does 
not allow exceptions to be passed as parameters for the 
instantiation of generic parts, the use of a generic as a reusable 
part is somewhat constrained. The usual exception declaration 
interface between a system and a generic package is the package 
specification. Thus the identity and meaning of the exception is 


E.l.2.2 



determined by the generic package, not the host program. This 
constitutes a reversal of accepted top down design techniques. 

Another way of interfacing exceptions and reusable generic parts is 
to have both the system and the generic unit depend on a 
specif action package of exception declarations. This technique 
would be consistent with top down methodologies, but would require a 
high degree of cooperation between system implementers and the 
designers of reusable parts. 

A third technique of exception interfacing involves the 
implementation of subprograms which raise exceptions. The 
subprograms would be elaborated in the system's declarative 
environment and passed as actual parameters to generic 
instantiations. This technique solves the problem, but at the cost 
of efficiency, elegance, and design clarity. 

(ENSIEERAT3DN OF TIMING 

Another factor affecting certification of reusable parts is the hard 
timing requirements of a part. This information is not extractable 
from a package specification, and varies frcm %rsten to qrstem. In 
early computer architectures, timing was a fairly easily calculated 
quantity. However, multitasking software systems and new 
architectures which use cache, floating point accelerators, and 
other features, have direct influence on timing. In fact, non- 
package constraints such as context switch times have become as 
important as package timing itself. 

Since parts can be viewed as tree structures with many branches; 
where exception handling and timing must be considered, the 
characterization of a part's performance and its certification are 
indeed very complex.

II. 


Constraints in Design for Parts Reuse 


Die design of software parts must be done in a context independent 
manner; that is, no assumptions should be made about input 
conditions. All possible error conditions should be anticipated and 
treated as exceptions. The exception handling implementation must 
be explicitly documented. 

The Ada compiler run time default error checking features should not 
be used, except as a redundant check. If run time error checking is 
turned off for speed reasons, then flaws potentially exist in the 
system. Therefore, error conditions must be handled by the package. 
This philosophy, unfortunately, can lead to speed impacts within the 
system. 

If there are time constraints placed upon a part, then a "cost" 
analysis must be performed on that part prior to its implementation, 
and the results of that analysis must be captured for later use. A 
hierarchical fintional decomposition methodology, such as data flow 
or Petri nets, can be used in the analysis process. As will be 
discussed later, expert system technology can be applied to the 
performance of the "cost" analysis. 

It should also be mentioned that there exists a potentially large 
number of specific coding and design practices that can adversely 
impact reusability at both the system and part level. Tb fully 
identify these practices and address their relative impact will take 
time and experience, and such a discussion is beyond the scope of 
this paper.

III. Certificat ion and Reuse 


Ideally, a certified "part" should be a reusable part. However, it 
is probable that parts that are considered to be 100% certified are 
going to be small secpnents of oode with limited application. The 
process of certifying large segments of code is extremely complex. 

This paper has made several points concerning the reuse of Ada 
parts: 

o Ada specification packages are insufficient for determining 
reuse 

o Behavior and performance of a part must be explicitly defined 
and extractable 

o Exception handling is an important factor in both behavior and 
performance 

o Generics offer a logical approach to certification of reusable 
parts but have certain constraints 

o Hard timing requirements must be stated, and are subject to 
variations created by hardware and software environments 

o Run time implementations must be considered as influencing a 
part's behavior 

Artificial Intelligence can provide some technology to reduce the 
complexity of analysis for reuse. In particular, expert system 
technology and object-oriented design can be applied to the problem. 
Object-oriented design is a term used to define a methodolgy of 
software development in which data items in a software system are 
defined in terms of their attributes, as well as in terms of their 
relationship to other data items in the system. Object-orientation 
has led to the aonoept of "frames", which sure used extensively in 
expert systems for knowledge representation. If software parts are 
thought of as objects, a frame-based system can be built which 
contains declarative and procedural information about parts. 

The knowledge contained in such a frame would be symbolically 
stated, using a formal grammar. The grammar of the frame will state 
the f motion of the part, such as number and types of exceptions, 
real-time requirements, accuracy, etc. If a hierarchical 
representation is used to describe the ^stem, attributes of parts 
can be "inherited" from other parts at a higher level in the 
hierarchy. An expert system can then be built to compare 
requirements to information about parts, yielding a probabalistic 
measure of applicability of a part to a problem. The more 
information available about a part, the better a measure of 
applicability can be determined. 

Another technology that can be applied to reusability is that of 
Archetyping. (1) Archetype comes from the latin archetyp un for 
"first molded as a pattern; exemplary". In this case, software 


E.l.2.5 



special ists capture software soon after it has been tested and 
delivered, work with users of the software system, and sketch out 
future requirements for systems of this type . Thus, a team of 
software and domain experts develops a pattern frcm which future 
qr stems can be generated. The result of an archetyped software 
astern is a tanplate that requires a tool to "fill in the blanks" to 
customize the software for an application. One such tool is the 
DARTS technology, offered ty General Eynamics. Archetyped software 
overcomes all the limitations fond with Ada generics. Archetyped 
part elements, ocmbined with a formal granmar, will provide context- 
sensitive expansion of specifications into compilable Ada source 
code. 

It is the conclusion of this paper that absolute certification is a 
desirable but extremely difficult to achieve goal. Partial 
certification is a more realistic goal and is attainable with 
existing technologies. 

Moreover, in order to use parts "as is”, they must be kept snail and 
uncomplicated, otherwise the process of certification becomes very 
oomptLex. A methodology, such as archetyping, combined with the 
proper tools, can make parts adaptable, reduce complexity, and allow 
for reuse of larger bodies of code.
