CHAPTER 1 


INTRODUCTION 


^This Validation Summary Report S-VSR-} "describes the extent to which a 
specific Ada compiler conforms to the Ada Standard, ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A. 
This report explains all technical terms used within it and thoroughly 
reports the results o f testi ng this compiler using the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability , r ACVC K - An Ada compiler must be implemented 
according to the Ada Standard, and any implementation-dependent features 
must conform to the requirements of the Ada Standard. The Ada Standard 
must be implemented in its entirety, and nothing can be implemented that is 
not in the Standard. 


Even though all validated Ada compilers conform to the Ada Standard, it 
must be understood that some differences do exist between implementations. 
The Ada Standard permits some implementation dependencies—for example, the 
maximum length of identifiers or the maximum values of integer types. 
Other differences between compilers result from the characteristics of 
particular operating systems, hardware, or implementation strategies. All 
the dependencies observed during the process of testing this compiler are 
given in this report. 


The information in this report is derived from the test results produced 
during validation testing. The validation process includes submitting a 
suite of standardized tests, the ACVC, as inputs to an Ada compiler and 
evaluating the results. The purpose of validating is to ensure conformity 
of the compiler to the Ada Standard by testing that the compiler properly 
implements legal language constructs and that it identifies and rejects 
illegal language constructs. The testing also identifies behavior that is 
implementation dependent, but is permitted by the Ada Standard. Six 
classes of tests are used. These tests are designed to perform checks at 
compile time, at link time, and during execution. 


1.1 PURPOSE OF THIS VALIDATION SUMMARY REPORT 

This tfSR documents the results of the validation testing performed on an 
Ada compiler. Testing was carried out for the following purposes: 


1-1 











INTRODUCTION 


. To attempt to identify any language constructs supported by the 
compiler that do not conform to the Ada standard 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs not supported by 
the compiler but required by the Ada Standard 

. To determine that the implementation-dependent behavior is allowed 
by the Ada Standard 


Testing of this compiler was conducted by SofTech, Inc., under the 
direction of the AVF according to procedures established by the Ada Joint 
Program Office and administered by the Ada Validation Organization (AVO). 
On-site testing was completed 18 November 1988 at Verdix Corporation, 
Western Operations, Aloha OR.

INTRODUCTION 


Inapplicable An ACVC test that uses features of the language that a 
test compiler is not required to support or may legitimately 

support in a way other than the one expected by the test. 


Passed test An ACVC test for which a compiler generates the expected 

result. 

Target The computer which executes the code generated by the 

compiler. 

Test A program that checks a compiler's conformity regarding a 

particular feature or a combination of features to the Ada 
Standard. In the context of this report, the term is used to 
designate a single test, which may comprise one or more 
files. 


Withdrawn An ACVC test found to be incorrect and not used to check 

test conformity to the Ada Standard. A test may be incorrect 

because it has an invalid test objective, fails to meet its 
test objective, or contains illegal or erroneous use of the 
language. 


1.5 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conformity to the Ada Standard is measured using the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains both legal and illegal Ada programs structured into six test 
classes: A, 3, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies 
the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable, 
and special program units are used to report their results during 
execution. Class B tests are expected to produce compilation errors. 
Class L tests are expected to produce errors because of the way in which a 
program library is used at link time. 

Class A tests ensure the successful compilation and execution of legal Ada 
programs with certain language constructs which cannot be verified at run 
time. There are no explicit program components in a Class A test to check 
semantics. For example, a Class A test checks that reserved words of 
another language (other than those already reserved in the Ada language) 
are not treated as reserved words by an Ada compiler. A Class A test is 
passed if no errors are detected at compile time and the program executes 
to produce a PASSED message. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. 
Class B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and 
the resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that every syntax 
or semantic error in the test is detected. A Class B test is passed if 
every illegal construct that it contains is detected by the compiler.

INTRODUCTION 


Class C tests check the run time system to ensure that legal Ada programs 
can be correctly compiled and executed. Each Class C test is self-checking 
and produces a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result when it is executed. 

Class D tests check the compilation and execution capacities of a compiler. 
Since there are no capacity requirements placed on a compiler by the Ada 
Standard for some parameters—for example, the number of identifiers 
permitted in a compilation or the number of units in a library—a compiler 
may refuse to compile a Class D test and still be a conforming compiler. 
Therefore, if a Class D test fails to compile because the capacity of the 
compiler is exceeded, the test is classified as inapplicable. If a Class D 
test compiles successfully, it is self-checking and produces a PASSED or 
FAILED message during execution. 

Class E tests are expected to execute successfully and check 
implementation-dependent options and resolutions of ambiguities in the Ada 
Standard. Each Class E test is self-checking and produces a NOT 
APPLICABLE, PASSED, or FAILED message when it is compiled and executed. 
However, the Ada Standard permits an implementation to reject programs 
containing some features addressed by Class E tests during compilation. 
Therefore, a Class E test is passed by a compiler if it is compiled 
successfully and executes to produce a PASSED message, or if it is rejected 
by the compiler for an allowable reason. 

Class L tests check that incomplete or illegal Ada programs involving 
multiple, separately compiled units are detected and not allowed to 
execute. Class L tests are compiled separately and execution is attempted. 
A Class L test passes if it is rejected at link time—that is, an attempt 
to execute the main program must generate an error message before any 
declarations in the main program or any units referenced by the main 
program are elaborated. In some cases, an implementation may legitimately 
detect errors during compilation of the test. 

Two library units, the package REPORT and the procedure CHECK_FILE, support 
the self-checking features of the executable tests. The package REPORT 
provides the mechanism by which executable tests report PASSED, FAILED, or 
NOT APPLICABLE results. It also provides a set of identity functions used 
to defeat some compiler optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that 
would circumvent a test objective. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to 
check the contents of text files written by some of the Class C tests for 
Chapter 14 of the Ada Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. These tests produce messages that 
are examined to verify that the units are operating correctly. If these 
units are not operating correctly, then the validation is not attempted. 

The text of each test in the ACVC follows conventions that are intended to 
ensure that the tests are reasonably portable without modification. For 
example, the tests make use of only the basic set of 55 characters, contain 
lines with a maximum length of 72 characters, use small numeric values, and 
place features that may not be supported by all implementations in separate 
tests. However, some tests contain values that require the test to be 


1-5 








INTRODUCTION 


customized according to implementation-specific values—for example, an 
illegal file name. A list of the values used for this validation is 
provided in Appendix C. 

A compiler must correctly process each of the tests in the suite and 
demonstrate conformity to the Ada Standard by either meeting the pass 
criteria given for the test or by showing that the test is inapplicable to 
the implementation. The applicability of a test to an implementation is 
considered each time the implementation is validated. A test that is 
inapplicable for one validation is not necessarily inapplicable for a 
subsequent validation. Any test that was determined to contain an illegal 
language construct or an erroneous language construct is withdrawn from the 
ACVC and, therefore, is not used in testing a compiler. The tests 
withdrawn at the time of this validation are given in Appendix D.

CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 

2.1 CONFIGURATION TESTED 

The candidate compilation system for this validation was tested under the 
following configuration:

Operating System: HP-UX 6.2 Version B 


Memory Size: 


16 Megabytes 











CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


2.2 IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS 

One of the purposes of validating compilers is to determine the behavior of 
a compiler in those areas of the Ada Standard that permit implementations 
to differ. Class D and E tests specifically check for such implementation 
differences. However, tests in other classes also characterize an 
implementation. The tests demonstrate the following characteristics: 


a. Capacities. 

(1) The compiler correctly processes a compilation containing 723 
variables in the same declarative part. (See test D29002K.) 

(2) The compiler correctly processes tests containing loop 

statements nested to 65 levels. (See tests D55A03A..H (8 
tests).) 

(3) The compiler correctly processes tests containing block 

statements nested to 65 levels. (See test D56001B.) 

(4) The compiler correctly processes tests containing recursive 
procedures separately compiled as subunits nested to 17 
levels. (See tests D64005E..G (3 tests).) 


b. Predefined types. 

(1) This implementation supports the additional predefined types 
SHORT.INTEGER, TINY_INTEGER, and SHORT_FLOAT in the package 
STANDARD. (See tests B86001T..Z (7 tests).) 


c. Based literals. 

(1) An implementation is allowed to reject a based literal with a 
value exceeding SYSTEM.MAX_INT during compilation, or it may 
raise NUMERIC_ERROR or CONSTRAINT_ERROR during execution. 
This implementation raises CONSTRAINT_ERROR during execution. 
(See test E24201A.) 


d. Expression evaluation. 

The order in which expressions are evaluated and the time at which 
constraints are checked are not defined oy the language. While 
the ACVC tests do not specifically attempt to determine the order 
of evaluation of expressions, test results indicate the following: 


2-2 










CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(1) All of the default initialization expressions for record 
components are evaluated before any value is checked for 
membership in a component's subtype. (See test C32117A.) 

(2) Assignments for subtypes are performed with the same precision 
as the base type. (See test C35712E.) 

(3) This implementation uses no extra bits for extra precision and 
uses all extra bits for extra range. (See test C35903A.) 

(4) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised when an integer literal operand in 
a comparison or membership test is outside the range of the 
base type. (See test C45232A.) 

(5) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when a literal operand in a 
fixed-point comparison or membership test is outside the range 
of the base type. (See test C45252A.) 

(6) Underflow is gradual. (See tests C45524A..Z (26 tests).) 


Rounding. 

The method by which values are rounded in type conversions is not 
defined by the language. While the ACVC tests do not specifically 
attempt to determine the method of rounding, the test results 
indicate the following: 

(1) The method used for rounding to integer is round to even. 
(See tests C46012A..Z (26 tests).) 

(2) The method used for rounding to longest integer is round to 
even. (See tests C46012A..Z (26 tests).) 

(3) The method used for rounding to integer in static universal 
real expressions is round to even. (See test C4A014A.) 


A' types. 

An .ementation is allowed to raise NUMERIC_ERROR or 
’.ONSr.iAINT_ERROR for an array having a 'LENGTH that exceeds 
S .VNEARD.INTEGER'LAST and/or SYSTEM.MAXJENT. For this 
implementation: 

(1) Declaration of an array type or subtype declaration with more 
than SYSTEM.MAX INT components raises no exception. (See test 
C36003A.) 


2-3 









CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(2) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when 'LENGTH is applied to an array 
type with INTEGER'LAST 2 components. (See test C36202A.) 

(3) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when ’LENGTH is applied to an ar-ay 
type with SYSTEM.MAX_INT + 2 components. (See test C36202B.) 

(4) A packed BOOLEAN array having a 'LENGTH exceeding INTEGER’LAST 
raises NUMERIC_ERROR when the array type is declared. (See 
test C52103X.) 

(5) A packed two-dimensional BOOLEAN array with more than 

INTEGER'LAST components raises NUMERIC_ERROR when the array 
objects are declared. (See test C52104Y.) 

(6) A null array with one dimension of length greater than 

INTEGER'LAST may raise NUMERIC_ERROR or CONSTRAINT_ERROR 
either when declared or assigned. Alternatively, an 
implementation may accept the declaration. However, lengths 
must match in array slice assignments. This implementation 
raises NUMERIC ERROR when the array type is declared. (See 
test E52103Y.) 

(7) In assigning one-dimensional array types, the expression is 

evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

(8) In assigning two-dimensional array types, the expression is 

not evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is 
raised when checking whether the expression's subtype is 
compatible with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


g. Discriminated types. 

(1) In assigning record types with discriminants, the expression 
is evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


h. Aggregates. 

(1) In the evaluation of a multi-dimensional aggregate, the test 
results indicate that all choices are evaluated before 
checking against the index type. (See tests C43207A and 
C43207B.) 


2-4 










CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(2) In the evaluation of an aggregate containing subaggregates, 
all choices are evaluated before being checked for identical 
bounds. (See test E43212B.) 

(3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised before all choices are evaluated 
when a bound in a non-null range of a non-null aggregate does 
not belong to an index subtype. (See test E43211B.) 


i. Pragmas. 

(1) The pragna INLINE is supported for functions or procedures. 
(See tests LA3004A..B (2 tests), EA3004C..D (2 tests), and 

CA3004E..F (2 tests).) 


j. Generics. 

(1) Generic specifications and bodies can be compiled in separate 
compilations. (See tests CA1012A, CA2009C, CA2009F, BC3204C, 
and BC3205D.) 

(2) Generic unit bodies and their subunits can be compiled in 

separate compilations. (See test CA3011A.) 

(3) Generic subprogram declarations and bodies can be compiled in 
separate compilations. (See tests CA1012A and CA2009F.) 

(4) Generic library subprogram specifications and bodies can be 
compiled in separate compilations. (See test CA1012A.) 

(5) Generic non-library subprogram bodies can be compiled in 

separate compilations from their stubs. (See test CA2009F.) 

(6) Generic package declarations and bodies can be compiled in 

separate compilations. (See tests CA2009C, BC3204C, and 

3C3205D.) 

(7) Generic library package specifications and bodies can be 
compiled in separate compilations. (See tests BC3204C and 
BC3205D.) 

(8) Generic non-library package bodies as subunits can be compiled 
in separate compilations. (See test CA2009C.) 

(9) Generic unit bodies and their subunits can be compiled in 

separate compilations. (See test CA3011A.)

CHAPTER 3 


TEST INFORMATION 


3.1 TEST RESULTS 

Version 1.10 of the ACVC comprises 3717 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, 25 tests had been withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF 
determined that 331 tests were inapplicable to this implementation. All 
inapplicable tests were processed during validation testing except for 201 
executable tests that use floating-point precision exceeding that supported 
by the implementation Modifications to the code, processing, or grading for 
8 tests were required to successfully demonstrate the test objective. (See 
section 3.6.) 

The AVF concludes that the testing results demonstrate acceptable 
conformity to the Ada Standard.

See Appendix D for the reason that each of these tests was withdrawn. 


3.5 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

Some tests do not apply to all compilers because they make use of features 
that a compiler is not required by the Ada Standard to support. Others may 
depend on the result of another test that is either inapplicable or 
withdrawn. The applicability of a test to an implementation is considered 
each time a validation is attempted. A test that is inapplicable for one 
validation attempt is not necessarily inapplicable for a subsequent 
attempt. For this validation attempt, 331 tests were inapplicable for the 
reasons indicated: 


3-2 









TEST INFORMATION 


a. The following 201 tests are not applicable because they have 
floating-point type declarations requiring more digits than 
SYSTEM.MAX DIGITS:

3.6 TEST, PROCESSING, AND EVALUATION MODIFICATIONS 

It is expected that some tests will require modifications of code, 
processing, or evaluation in order to compensate for legitimate 
implementation behavior. Modifications are made by the AVF in cases where 
legitimate implementation behavior prevents the successful completion of an 
(otherwise) applicable test. Examples of such modifications include: 
adding a length clause to alter the default size of a collection; splitting 
a Class B test into subtests so that all errors are detected; and 
confirming that messages produced by an executable test demonstrate 
conforming behavior that was not anticipated by the test (such as raising 


3-5 










TEST INFORMATION 


one exception instead of another). 
Modifications were required for 8 tests. 


The following tests were split because syntax errors at one point resulted 
in the compiler not detecting other errors in the test: 


B24009A B33301B B38003A B38003B B380D9A 

B38009B BC1303F BC3005B 


3.7 ADDITIONAL TESTING INFORMATION 
3.7.1 Prevalidation 

Prior to validation, a set of test results for ACVC Version 1.10 produced 
by the VAda-110-1515, Version V5.7 was submitted to the AVF by the 
applicant for review. Analysis of these results demonstrated that the 
compiler successfully passed all applicable tests, and the compiler 
exhibited the expected behavior on all inapplicable tests. 


3.7.2 Test Method 

Testing of the VAda-110-1515, Version V5.7 using ACVC Version 1.10 was 
conducted on-site by a validation team from the AVF. The configuration in 
which the testing was performed is described by the following designations 
of hardware and software components: 

Host computer: Hewlett Packard 9000/350 

Host operating system: HP-UX 6.2 Version B 

Target computer: Same as Host 

Compiler: VAda-110-1515, Version V5.7 

A magnetic tape containing all tests except for withdrawn tests and tests 
requiring unsupported floating-point precision was taken on-site by the 
validation team for processing. Tests that make use of 
implementation-specific values were customized before being written to the 
magnetic tape. Tests requiring modifications during the prevalidation 
testing were included in their modified form on the magnetic tape. 

The contents of the magnetic tape were loaded directly onto the host 
computer. The test tape was read onto a VAX 11/750 to the drive unit 
/vc/tape and copied via RCP over ethernet to the ACVC directories on the 
host machine. 


3-6 









TEST INFORMATION 


After the test files were loaded to disk, the full set of tests was 
compiled, linked, and all executable tests were run on the Hewlett Packard 
9000/350. Results were printed from the host computer. 

The compiler was tested using command scripts provided by Verdix 
Corporation and reviewed by the validation team. 

Tests were compiled, linked, and executed (as appropriate) using two HP 
9000/350 computers. Test output, compilation listings, and job logs were 
captured on magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined 
on-site by the validation team were also archived. 


3.7.3 Test Site 

Testing was conducted at Verdix Corporation, Western Operations, Aloha OR 
and was completed on 18 November 1988 .

ATTACHMENT I 


APPENDIX F. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


1. Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 

1.1. INLINE ONLY Pragma 

The INLINE_ONLY pragma, when used in the same way as pragma INLINE, indicates to the compiler 
that the subprogram must always be iniined. This pragma also suppresses the generation of a callable 
version of the routine which save code space. 

1.2. BUTLT_IN Pragma 

The BUILTJN pragma is used in the implementation of some predefined Ada packages, but provides 
no user access. It is used only to implement code bodies for which no actual Ada body can be pro¬ 
vided, for example the MACHINE_CODE package. 

1J. SHARE_CODE Pragma 

The SHARE_CODE pragma takes the name of a generic instantiation or a generic unit as the first argu¬ 
ment and one of the identifiers TRUE or FALSE as the second argument. This pragma is only allowed 
immediately at the place of a declarative item in a declarative pan or package specification, or after a 
library unit in a compilation, but before any subsequent compilation unit. 

When the first argument is a generic unit the pragma applies to all instantiations of that generic. When 
the first argument is the name of a generic instantiation the pragma applies only to the specified instan¬ 
tiation, or overloaded instantiations. 

If the second argument is TRUE the compiler will try to share code generated for a generic instantia¬ 
tion with code generated for other instantiations of the same generic. When the second argument is 
FALSE each instantiation will get a unique copy of the generated code. The extent to which code is 
shared between instantiations depends on this pragma and the kind of generic formal parameters 
declared for the generic unit. 

The name pragma SKAREJ30DY is also recognized by the implementation and has the same effect as 
SHARE_CODE. It is included for comparability with earlier versions of VADS. 

1.4. NO IMAGE Pragma 

The pragma suppresses the generation of the image array used for the IMAGE attribute of enumeration 
types. This eliminates the overhead required to store the array in the executable image. 

1-5. EXTERNAL_N'AME Pragma 

The EXTERNAL_NAME pragma takes the name of a subprogram or variable defined in Ada and 
allows the user to specify a different external name that may be used to reference the entity from other 
languages. The pragma is allowed at the place of a declarative item in a package specification and 
must apply to an object declared earlier in the same package specification. 

1.6. INTERFACE OBJECT Pragma 

The INTERFACE_OBJECT pragma takes the name of a a variable defined in another language and 
allows it to be referenced directly in Ada. The pragma will replace all occurrences of the variable 
name with an external reference to the second, link_argument. The pragma is allowed at the place of a 
declarative item in a package specification and must apply to an object declared earlier in the same 
package specification. The object must be declared as a scalar or an access type. The object cannot be 


B-2 










any of Che following: 

a loop variable, 
a constant, 

an initialized variable, 
an array, or 
a record. 

1.7. IMPLICIT_CODE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argument. This pragma is only allowed within a 
machine code procedure. It specifies that implicit code generated by the compiler be allowed or disal¬ 
lowed. A warning is issued if OFF is used and any implicit code needs to be generated. The default is 
ON. 

2. Implementation of Predefined Pragmas 
2.L CONTROLLED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no effect. 

2.2. ELABORATE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the Ada RM. 

2-3. INLINE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the Ada RM. 

2.4. INTERFACE 

This pragma supports calls to ’C and FORTRAN functions. The Ada subprograms can be either func¬ 
tions or procedures. The types of parameters and the result type for functions must be scalar, access or 
the predefined type ADDRESS in SYSTEM. An optional third argument overrides the default link 
name. All parameters must have mode IN. Record and array objects can be passed by reference using 
the ADDRESS attribute. 

2-5. LIST 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the Ada RM. 

2.6. MEMORYJ5IZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The implementation does not allow SYSTEM to be 
modified by means of pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.7. NON_REENTRANT 

This pragma takes one argument which can be the name of either a library subprogram or a subprogram 
declared immediately within a library package spec or body. It indicates to the compiler that the sub¬ 
program will not be called recursively allowing the compiler to perform specific optimizations. The 
pragma can be applied to a subprogram or a set of overloaded subprograsm within a package spec or 
package body. 

2A NOT ELABORATED 

This pragma can only appear in a library package specification. It indicates that the package will not 
be elaborated because it is either pan of the RTS, a configuration package or an Ada package that is 
referenced from a language other than Ada. The presence of this pragma suppresses the generation of 
elaboration code and issues warnings if elaboration code is required. 










X9. OPTIMIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no effect. 

2.10. PACK 

This pragma will cause the compiler to choose a non-aligned representation for composite types. It will 
not causes objects to be packed at the bit level. 

2.11. PAGE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the Ada RM. 

2.12. PASSIVE 

The pragma has three forms : 

PRAGMA PASSIVE; 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(SEMAPHORE); 

PRAGMA PASSrVEfINTERRUPT, <number>); 

This pragma Pragma passive can be applied to a task or task type declared immediately within a library 
package spec or body. The pragma directs the compiler to optimize certain tasking operations. It is 
possible that the statements in a task body will prevent the intended optimization, in these cases a warn¬ 
ing will be generated at compile dme and will raise TASKXNG_£RROR at runtime. 

2.13. PRIORITY 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the Ada RM. 

2.14. SHARED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no effect. 

2.15. ST OR AGE_UNTT 

This pragma is recognized by the implementadon. The implementation does not allow SYSTEM to be 
modified by means of pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.16. SUPPRESS 

This pragma is implemented as described, except that RANGE_CHECK and DIVTSION_CHECK can¬ 
not be supressed. 

2.17. SYSTEM_NAME 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The implementadon does not allow SYSTEM to be 
modified by means of pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

3. Implementation-Dependent Attributes 
3.1. P’REF 

For a prefix that denotes an object, a program unit, a label, or an entry: 

This attribute denotes the effective address of the first of the storage units allocated to P. For a subpro¬ 
gram, package, task unit, or label, it refen to the address of the machine code associated with the 
corresponding body or statement. For an entry for which an address clause has been given, it refers to 
the corresponding hardware interrupt. The attribute is of the type OPERAND defined in the package 
MACHINE_CODE. The attribute is only allowed within a machine code procedure. 

See secdon F.4.8 for more informadon on the use of this attribute. 









'(for a package, task unit, or entry, the ’REF attribute is not supported.)

5. Restrictions On Representation Clauses 
5.1. Pragma PACK 

In the absence of pragma PACK record components are padded so as to provide for efficient access by 
the target hardware, pragma PACK applied to a record eliminate the padding where possible. Pragma 
PACK has no other effect on the storage allocated for record components a record r ep r esentation is 
required. 

5JL Record Representation Clauses 

For scalar types a represenation clause will pack to the number of bits required to represent the range of 
the subtype. A record representation applied to a composite type will not cause the object to be packed 
to fit in the space required. An explicit representation clause must be given for the component type. An 


B-5 
















.error will be issued if there is insufficient space allocated. 

5 3. Address Clauses 

Address clauses are supported for variables and constants. 

5.4. Interrupts 

Imerupt entries are not supported. 

5 S. Representation Attributes 

The ADDRESS attribute is not supported for the following entities: 

Packages 

Tasks 

Labels 

Entries 

5.6. Machine Code Insertions 
Machine code insertions are supported. 

The general definition of the package MACHINE_CODE provides an assembly language interface for 
the target machine. It provides the necessary record type(s) needed in the code statement, an enumera¬ 
tion type of all the opcode mneumonics, a set of register definitions, and a set of addressing mode func¬ 
tions. 

The general syntax of a machine code statement is as follows: 

CODE_n’( opcode, operand {, operand] ); 
where n indicates the number of operands in the aggregate. 

A special case arises for a variable number of operands. The operands are listed within a subaggregate. 
The format is as follows: 

CODE_N’( opcode, (operand {, operand }) ); 

For those opcodes that require no operands, named notation must be used (cf. RM 4.3(4)). 

CODE_0’( op -> opcode ); 

The opcode must be an enumeration literal (i.e. it cannot be an object, attribute, or a rename). 

An operand can only be an entity defined in MACHINE_CODE or the ’REF attribute. 

The arguments to any of the functions defined in MACHINE_CODE must be static expressions, string 
literals, or the functions defined in MACHINE_CODE. The ’REF attribute may not be used as an argu¬ 
ment in any of these functions. 

Inline expansion of machine code procedures is supported.

6, Conventions for Implementation-generated Names 
There are no implementation-generated names. 

7. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clauses 
Address clauses are supported for constants and variables. 


8. Restrictions on Unchecked Conversions 
None. 

9. Restrictions on Unchecked Deallocations 
None. 

10. Implementation Characteristics of I/O Packages 

Instantiations of DDRECT_IO use the value MAX_REC_SZZE as the record sue (expressed in 
STORAGEJJNTTS) when the sue of ELEMENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For example for uncon¬ 
strained arrays such as string where ELEMENT_TYPE ’ SIZE is very large, MAX_R£C_SIZH is used 
instead. MAX_RECORD_SIZE is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a program before 
instantiating DIRECT_IO to provide an upper limit on the record size. In any case the maximum size 
supported is 1024 x 1024 x STORAGE_UNIT bits. DIRECT_IO will raise USE_ERROR if 
MAX_REC_SIZE exceeds this absolute limit. 

Instantiations of SEQUENTLAL_IO use the value MAX_REC_SIZE as the record size (expressed in 
STORaGE_UNITS) when the size of ELEMENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For example for uncon¬ 
strained arrays such as string where ELEMENT_TYPE’ SIZE is very large, MAX_REC_SIZE is used 
instead. MAX_R£CORD_SIZE is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a program before 
instantiating INTEGER_ICf to provide an upper limit on the record size. SEQUENTIAL_IO imposes no 
limit on MAX_REC_SIZE. 


11. Implementation Limits 

The following limits are actually enforced by the implementation. It is not intended to imply that 
resources up to or even near these limits are available to every program. 


11.1. Line Length 

The implementation supports a maximum line length of characters including the end of line charac¬ 
ter. 


1L2. Record and Array Sizes 

The maximum size of a statically sized array type is 4,000,000 x STQRAGE_UNITS. The maximum 
size of a statically sized record type is 4,000.000 x STORAGE_UNTTS. A record type or array type 
declaration that exceeds these limits will generate a warning message. 

11J. Default Stack Size for Tasks 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGE_SlZh length specification every task except the main program 
is allocated a fixed size stack of 10,240 STORAGE UNITS. This is the value returned by 
T’ STORAGE_SIZE for a task type T. 

11.4. Default Collection Size 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGE_SIZE length attribute the default collection size for an access 
type is 100 times the size of the designated type. This is the vaiue returned by TSTORAGE_SIZE for 


B-7 








- an access type T. 

11J. Limit on Declared Objects 

There is an absolute limit of 6,000.000 x STORaGEJJNITS for objects declared statically witnin a 
compilation unit. If this value is exceeded the compiler "will terminate the compilation of the unit with a 
FATAL error message.

TEST PARAMETERS 


Certain tests in the ACVC make use of implementation-dependent values, such 
as the maximum length of an input line and invalid file names. A test that 
makes use of such values is identified by the extension .TST in its file 
name. Actual values to be substituted are represented by names that begin 
with a dollar sign. A value must be substituted for each of these names 
before the test is run. The values used for this validation are given 
below:

APPENDIX D 


WITHDRAWN TESTS 


Seme tests are withdrawn from the ACVC because they do not conform to the 
Ada Standard. The following 25 tests had been withdrawn at the time of 
validation testing for the reasons indicated. A reference of the form 
Al-ddddd is to an Ada Commentary. 


a. A39005G: This test unreasonably expects a component clause to 
pack an array component into a minimum size (line 30). 

b. B97102E: This test contains an unintended illegality: a select 

statement contains a null statement at the place of a selective 
wait alternative (line 3D. 

c. CD2A62D: This test wrongly requires that an array object's size 
be no greater than 10, although its subtype's size was specified 
to be 40 (line 137). 

d. CD2A63B and D, CD2A66B and D, CD2A73A..D, CD2A76A..D [12 tests]: 
These tests wrongly attempt to check the size of objects of a 
derived type (for which a 'SIZE length clause is given) by passing 
them to a derived subprogram (which implicitly converts them to 
the parent type (Ada standard 3*4:14)). Additionally, they use 
the 'SIZE length clause and attribute, whose interpretation is 
considered problematic by the WG9 ARG. 

e. CD2A81G and CD2A83G: These tests assume that dependent tasks will 

terminate while the main program executes a loop that simply tests 
for task termination; this is not the case, and the main program 

may loop indefinitely (lines 74, 85, 86 and 96, 86 and 96, and 58, 

respectivly). 

f. CD2B15C and CD7205C: These tests expect that a ’ST0RAGE_3IZE 

length clause provides precise control over the number of 
designated objects in a collection; the Ada standard 13*2:15 

allows that such control must not be expected. 


D-1 







WITHDRAWN TESTS 


g. CD7105A: This test requires that successive calls to 

CALENDAR.CLOCK change by at least SYSTEM.TICK; however, by 
Commentary AI-00201, it is only the expected frequency of change 
that must be at least SYSTEM.TICK—particular instances of change 
may be less (line 29). 

h. CD7205D: This test checks an invalid test objective: it treats 

the specification of storage to be reserved for a task's 
activation as though it were like the specification of storage for 
a collection. 

i. CE2107I: This test requires that objects of two similar scalar 
types be distinguished when read from a file—DATA_ERROR is 
expected to be raised by an attempt to read one object as of the 
other type. However, it is not clear exactly how the Ada standard 
14.2.4:4 is to be interpreted; thus, this test objective is not 
considered valid, (line 90) 

j. CE3111C: This test requires certain behavior when two files are 

associated with the same external file; however, this is not 
required by the Ada standard. 

k. CE3301A: This test contains several calls to END_0F_LINE and 

END_OF_PAGE that have no parameter: these calls were intended to 
specify a file, not to refer to STANDARD_INPUT (lines 103, 107, 

118, 132, and 136). 

l. CE3411B: This test requires that a text file's column number be 

set to COUNT'LAST in order to check that LAY0UT_ERR0R is raised by 
a subsequent PUT operation. But the former operation will 
generally raise an exception due to a lack of available disk 
space, and the test would thus encumber validation testing.
