x-archive-meta-description: A study carried out by Serendipity Associates is described. The purpose was to summarize the objectives of the study as a whole, to describe the method employed to carry out the study, and to present recommendations for further work. Research reports presented include: (1) a simple model of a man-machine development cycle; (2) a simple calculus for discrete systems; (3) system development activities concerned with putting man in an aerospace system; (4) development of man-machine system: some concepts and guidelines; and (5) an approach for determining the optimal role of man and allocation of functions in an aerospace system. Implications for future work are discussed.
