1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: A, 
B, C, D, E, auid L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class to 
vhich it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B and 
class L tests are expected to produce errors at compile time and link time, 
respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking nanner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result vhen they 
are executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, 
and the procedure CHECK FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT 
also provides a set of Identity functions used to defeat some compiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ma Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a conpiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is ccxnpiled emd the 
resulting coitpilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Stemdard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the ccmpiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately conpiled units. Errors 
are expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values — for exaitple, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in Appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and 
implementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this implementation are described in section 2.3. 


1-2 





iNnmjCTioN 


For each Ada inplementation, a customized test suite is produced by the 
AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications described in 
the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see section 2.1), and 
possibly removing some inapplicable tests (see section 2.2 and (UG891). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada inplementation must process each test of 
the custOTiized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are irrelevemt 
for a given Ada inplementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may 
be supported by documents issued by the ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and commonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Commentaries are included as 
appropriate.

C35713C, B86001U, and C86006G chec)c for the predefined type 

L(M3_FLCIAT; for this inplementation, there is no such type. 


C35713D and B86001Z checlt for a predefined floating-point type with a 
name other than FLOAT, La4G_FLOAT, or SHORT_FLQAT; for this 
implementation, there is no such type. 

A35801E checks that FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST may be used as a range 
constraint in a floating-point type declaration; for this 
inplementation, that range exceeds the range of safe numbers of the 
largest predefined floating-point type and must be rejected. (See 
section 2.3.) 

C45531M..P cind C45532M..P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations for 
types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or greater; for this 
inplementation, MAX_MANTISSA is less them 47. 

C45624A..B (2 tests) check that the proper exception is raised if 
MACHlNE_OVERFLCWS is FALSE for floating point types and the results of 
various floating-point operations lie outside the remge of the laase 
type; for this inplementation, MACHINEjCfVERFLCWS is TRUE. 

B86001Y uses the name of a predefined fixed-point type other than type 
DURATION; for this inplementation, there is no such type. 

C96005B uses values of type DURATION'S base type that are outside the 
range of type DURATION; for this inplementation, the ranges are the 
same. 


CD1009C checks whether a length clause can specify a non-default size 
for a floating-point type; this implementation does not support such 
sizes.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


CD2a 84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), emd CD2A840 use length clauses 
to specify non-default sizes for access types; this inplementation 
does not support such sizes. 

The tests listed in the following table check that USE_ERROR is raised 
if the given file operations are not supported for the given 
combination of mode eind access method; this inplementation supports 
these operations.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

McxJifications (see section 1.3) were required for 22 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
implementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the 
way expected by the original tests. 

B24009A B33301B B38003A B38003B B38009A B38009B 

B85008G B85008H BC1303F BC3005B BD2B03A BD2D03A 

BD4003A 

A35801E was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by 
the AVO. The compiler rejects the use of the range 

FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST as the range constraint of a floating-point type 
declaration because the bounds lie outside of the remge of safe numbers 
(cf. LRM 3.5.7:12). 

CD1009A, CD1009I, CD1C03A, CD2A24A, and CD2A31A..C (3 tests) were graded 
passed by E^/aluation Modification as directed by the AVO. These tests use 
instantiations of the support procedure LENGTH_CHECK, which uses 
Unchecked_Conversion according to the interpretation given in AI-00590. 

The AVO ruled that this interpretation is not binding under ACVC 1.11; the 
tests are ruled to be passed if they produce Failed messages only frcxn the 
instances of LENGTH_CHECK—i.e, the allowed Report.Failed messages have 
the general form: 

" * CHECK ON REPRESENTATI(»l FOR <TYPE_ID> FAILED." 

AD9001B was graded passed by Test Modification as directed by the AVO. 

This test checks that no bodies are recjuired for interfaced .subprograms; 
among the procedures that it uses is one with a parameter of mode OUT 
(line 36). This implementation does not support pragma INTERFACE for 
procedures with parameters of mode OUT. The test was modified by 
commenting out line 36; the modified test was passed.

Testing of this Ada implementation was conducted at the customer's site by 
a validation team from the AVF. 


3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming 
Language Standard, whether the test is applicable or inapplicable; 
otherwise, the Ada Inplementation fails the ACVC [Pro90]. 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard. 

Ihe list of items below gives the number of ACVC tests in various 
categories. /dl tests were processed, except those that were withdrawn 
because of test errors (item b; see section 2.1), those that require a 
floating-point precision that exceeds the inplementation's meucimum 
precision (item e; see section 2.2), and those that depend on the support 
of a file system — if none is supported (item d). All tests passed, 
except those that are listed in sections 2.1 and 2.2 (counted in items b 
and f, below).

3.3 TEST EXECUTIOJ 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were not loaded directly onto the host ccm^Juter. The tape 
was loaded onto a Sun Workstation, and the tests were copied over Ethernet 
to the host machine. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host con^>uter, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada inplementation. 

The tests were conpiled and linked on the host conpater system, as 
appropriate. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the customer and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a complete listing of 
the processing options for this inplementation. It also indicates the 
default options. 

Test output, compiler and linker listings, and job logs were captured on 
magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site by 
the validation team were also archived.

COMPILATICW SYSTEM OPTIONS 


Hie conpiler options of this Ada implementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to compiler documentation and 
not to this report. 


B-1 






CXDMPILATIW SYSTEM OPTIONS 


ada VADS Reference ada 

ada - invoke the Ada conpiler 
SYNTAX 

ada [options! [source_file]... [object_file.o}... 

OPTIONS 

-# identifier type value (define) Define an identifier of a 
specified type emd value. See VADS ADA PREPROCESSOR REFERENCE. 

-A (disassemble) disassemble the units in the source file after conpiling 
them. -A can be followed by arguments that further define the 
disassembly display (e.g. -Aa, -Ab, -Ad, -Af, -Al, -As): 

a add hexadecimal display of instruction bytes to disassembly 
listing 

b disassemble the unit body (default) 
d print the data section (if present) as well 
f use the alternative format for output 

1 put the disassembly output in file "file_name.das" 

s disassemble the unit spec 

-a file_name (archive) Treat file_name as an object 
archive file created by ar. Since some archive files end 
with .a, -a is used to distinguish archive files from Ada 
source files. 

-DG (debug flag) Force frong end to write out the gnrx.lib 
file in ASCII format. To use this option, you must 
conpile a file that changes the gnrx.lib file. 

-d (dependencies) Analyze for dependencies only. Do not do 
semantic analysis or code generation. Update the library, 
marking any defined units as unconpiled. The -d option is 
used by a.make to ested^lish dependencies among new files. 

-e (error) Process conpilation error messages using a.error 
and send it to standard output. Only the source lines 
containing errors are listed. Only one -e or -E option 
should be used. 

-E 

-E file 

-E directory (error output) Without a file or directory 
argument, ada processes error messages using a.error and 
directs a brief output to standard output; the raw error 
messages are left in ada_source.err. If a file pathname is 
given, the raw error messages are placed in that file. If a 
directory argument is supplied, the raw error output is 
placed in dir/source.err. The file of raw error messages can 
be used as input to a.error 


B—2 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-el (error listing) Intersperse error messages among source 
lines and direct to standard output. 


-El 

-El file 

-El directory (error listing) Same as the -E option, except 
that source listing with errors is produced. 

-ev (error vi(l)) Process syntax error messages using 
a.error, embed them in the source file, and call the 
environment editor ERROR_EDITOR. (If ERROR_EDITOR is 
defined, the environment variable ERROR_PATTERN should also 
be defined. ERROR_PATTERN is an editor search command that 
locates the first occurrence of '###' in the error file.) If 
no editor is specified, vi(l) is invo)ced. 

-K (keep) Keep the intermediate language (IL) file 
produced by the compiler front end. The IL file will be 
placed in the .objects directory, with the file name 
Ada_source.i 

-L library_name (library) Operate in VADS library 
library_name (Default: current working directory) 

-lfile_abbreviation (library search) Ihis is an option 
passed to the UNIX linker, ld(l) telling it to search the 
specified library file. (No space between the -1 and the 
file abbreviation.) 

For a description of the file abbreviations, see also 
Operating system documentation, ld(l). 

-M unit_name (main) Produce an executable program 
linking the named xanit as the main program. unit_neune must 
already be conpiled. It must be either a parameterless 
procedure or a parameterless function returning an integer. 

The executable program will be named a.out unless overridden 
with the -o option. 

-M source_file (main) Produce an executable program by 
conpiling and linking source_file. The main unit of the 
program is assumed to be the root name of the .a file (for 
foo.a the xinit is foo). Only one .a file may be preceded by 
-M. The executable program will be named a.out (self-hosted) or 
a.vox (cross-developnent) xmless overridden with the -o option. 

-o executable file (output) This option is to be used in 
conjunction wTth the -M option. executable_file is the name 
of the executable rather than the default a.out. 

-0(0-9] (optimize) Invoke the code optimizer. An optional digit 
(there is no space before the digit) provides the level of 
optimization. The default is -04. 

B-3 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-O full optimization 
-OO prevents optimization 
-01 no hoisting 

-02 no hoisting but more passes 
-03 no hoisting but even more passes 
-04 hoisting from loops 

-05 hoisting from loops but more passes (and instruction 
scheduling, if available) 

-06 hoisting from loops with naximum passes (and instruction 
scheduling, if available) 

-07 hoisting from loops and branches (and instruction) 
scheduling, if available) 

-08 hoisting from loops and branches, more passes (and 
instruction scheduling, if available) 

-09 hoisting from loops and breuiches, maximum passes (and 
instruction scheduling, if available) 

Hoisting from branches (and cases alternatives) can be slow 
and does not always provide significemt performance gains so 
it can be suppressed. 

For more information about optimization, see COMPILING ADA 
PROGRAMS, Conpiler Optimizations. See also pragma 
OPTIMIZE_CODE(OFF). 

-P Invoke the Ada Preprocessor. See VADS ADA PREPROCESSOR 
REFERENCE. 

-R VADS_library (recotr^jile instantiation) Force analysis 
of all generic instantiations, causing reinstantiation of 
any that are out of date. 

-S (suppress) ^ply pragma SUPPRESS to the entire 
compilation for all suppressible checks. (See also pragma 
SUPPRESS(ALL_CHECKS). 

-sh (show) Display the name of the tool executable but do 
not execute it. 

-T (timing) Print timing information for the compilation. 

-V (verbose) Print compiler version number, date emd time 
of compilation, name of file compiled, command input line, 
total compilation time, and error summary line. Storage 
usage information about the object file is provided. 

-w (warnings) Suppress warning diagnostics. 

DESCRIPTION 

The command ada executes the Ada compiler and compiles the 
named Ada source file, ending with the .a suffix. The file 
must reside in a VADS library directory. The ada.lib file in 


B-4 




COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIWS 


this directory is modified after each Ada unit is conpiled. 

By default, ada produces only object and net files. If the 
-M option is used, the compiler automatically invokes a.Id 
and builds a conplete program with the named library unit as 
the main program. 

Non-Ada object files (.o files produced by a compiler for 
another language) may be given as arguments to ada. These 
files will be passed on to the linker and will be linked 
with the specified Ada object files. 

Command line options may be specified in any order, but the 
order of compilation and the order of the files to be passed 
to the linker can be significant- 

Several VADS conpilers may be simultaneously availeible on a 
single system. Because the ada comnicind in any 
VADS location/bin on a system will execute the correct 
compiler cortponents based upon visible library directives, 
the option -sh is provided to print the name of the 
conponents actually executed. 

Program listings with a disassembly of machine code 
instructions are generated by a.db or a.das. 

See also a.das, a.db, a.error, a.Id, a.mklib, and Operating 
System reference documentation for the ld(l) utility. 

DIAGNOSTICS 

The diagnostics produced by the VADS compiler are intended 
to be self-explanatory. Most refer to the RM. Each RM 
reference includes a section number eind optionally, a paragraph 
number enclosed in parentheses.

DESCRIPTIW 

a.Id collects the object files needed to make unit_name a main 
progreun and calls the UNIX linker ld(l) to link together all Ada 
and other language objects required to produce em executable image 
in a.out (self-hosted) or a.vox (cross- development). unit_name is 
the main program and must name a non-generic subprogram. If unit name 
is a function, it must return a value of the type STANDARD.INTEGER. 

This integer result will be passed back to the UNIX shell as the status 
code of the execution. The utility uses the net files produced by the Ada 


B-6 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


compiler to check dependency information, a.Id produces an exception 
mapping table and a unit elaboration table and passes this information 
to the linker. The elaboration list generated by a.Id does not include 
library level packages that do not need elaboration. In addition, 
packages that contain no code that can raise an exception will no longer 
have exception te±)les. 

a.Id reads instructions for generating executables from the ada.lib file 
in the VADS libraries on the search list. Besides information generated 
by the ccxnpiler, these directives also include WllUn directives that 
allow the automatic linking of object modules compiled from other 
languages or Ada object modules not named in context clauses in the Ada 
source. Any number of WiTHn directives may be placed into a library, but 
they must be numbered contiguously beginning at WITHl. The directives 
are recorded in the library's ada.lib file and have the following form. 

WITHl:LINK:object_file: 

WITH2:LINK:archive file: 


WiTHn directives may be placed in the local Ada libraries or in any 
VADS library on the search list. 

A WiTHn directive in a local VADS library or earlier on the library 
search list will hide the same numbered WiTHn directive in a library 
later in the library search list. 

Use the tool a.info to change or report library directives in the 
current library. 

All arguments after unit_namp aro passed on to the linker. These may 
be options for it, archive libraries, library abbreviations, or 
object files. 


VADS_location/bin/a.ld is a wrapper program that executes the correct 
executable based upon directives visible in the ada.lib file. This 
permits multiple VADS compilers to exist on the same host. The -sh 
option prints the name of the actual executable file.

end STANDARD; 


C-1 









APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


APPENDIX F. Inplementation-Dependent Characteristics 


1, Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 

1.1. INLINE_C»JLY Pragma 

The INLINE_CM1,Y pragma, v^en used in the same way as pragma 
INLINE, indicates to the compiler that the subprogram must 
always be inlined. This pragma also suppresses the genera¬ 
tion of a callable version of the routine v^ich saves code 
space. If a user erroneously makes an INLINE_0NLY subpro¬ 
gram recursive a warning message will be emitted and an 
PROGRAM_ERROR will be raised at run time. 

1.2. INITIALIZE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers STATIC or DYNAMIC as the single 
argument. This pragma is only allowed within a library- 
level package spec or body. It specifies that all objects 
in the package be initialized as requested by the pragma 
(i.e. statically or dynamically). Only library-level 
objects are subject to static initialization; all objects 
within procedures are always (by definition) dynamic. If 
pragma INITIALIZE(STATIC) is used, and em object cannot be 
initialized statically, code will be generated to initialize 
the object and a warning message will be generated. 

1.3. BUILT_IN Pragma 

The BUILT IN pragma is used in the implementation of some 
predefineH Ada packages, but provides no user access. It is 
used only to inplement code bodies for which no actual Ada 
body can be provided, for example the MACHINE_CC»E package. 

1.4. SHARE_CODE Pragma 

The SHARE_CODE pragma takes the name of a generic instantia¬ 
tion or a generic unit as the first argument and one of the 
identifiers TRUE or FALSE as the second argument. This 
pragma is only allowed immediately at the place of a 
declarative item in a declarative part or package specifica- 


C-2 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


tion, or after a library lonit in a compilation, but before 
any subsequent compilation unit. 

When the first argument is a generic unit the pragma applies 
to all instantiations of that generic. When the first argu¬ 
ment is the name of a generic instantiation the pragma 
applies only to the specified instantiation, or overloaded 
instantiations. 

If the second argument is TRUE the compiler will try to 
share code generated for a generic instantiation with code 
generated for other instantiations of the same generic. 
When the second argument is FALSE each instantiation will 
get a unique copy of the generated code. The extent to 
which code is shared between instantiations depends on this 
pragma and the kind of generic formal parameters declared 
for the generic unit. 

The name pragma SHARE_BODY is also recognized by the imple¬ 
mentation and has the same effect as SHARE_CODE. It is 
included for compatability with earlier versions of VADS. 

1.5. NO_IMAGE Pragma 

The pragma suppresses the generation of the image array used 
for the IMAGE attribute of enumeration types. This elim¬ 
inates the overhead required to store the array in the exe¬ 
cutable image. An attenpt to use the IMAGE attribute on a 
type whose image array has been suppressed will result in a 
conpilation warning and PROGRAM_ERROR raised at run time. 

1.6. EXTERNAL_NAME Pragma 

The EXTERNAL NAME pragma takes the name of a subprogram or 
variable defined in Ada euid allows the user to specify a 
different external name that may be used to reference the 
entity from other languages. Ihe pragma is allowed at the 
place of a declarative item in a package specification and 
must apply to an object declared earlier in the same package 
specification. 

1.7. INTERFACE_NAME Pragma 

The INTERFACE_NAME pragma takes the name of a a varieible or 
subprogram defined in another lemguage emd allows it to be 
referenced directly in Ada. The pragma will replace all 
occurrences of the varieJole or subprogram ncune with an 
external reference to the second, link_argument. The pragma 
is allowed at the place of a declarative item in a package 
specification and must apply to an object or subprogreun 
declared earlier in the same package specification. The 
object must be declared as a scalar or an access type. The 
object ceuinot be euiy of the following: 


C-3 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


a loop variable, 
a constant, 

an initialized variable, 
an array, or 
a record. 

1.8. lMPLIClT_ca)E Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies that iirplicit code generated by the 
compiler be allowed or disallowed. A warning is issued if 
OFF is used and ciny implicit code needs to be generated. 
The default is W. 

1.9. OPTIMIZE_CODE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies vhether the code should be optim¬ 
ized by the compiler. The default is ON. When OFF is 
specified, the conpiler will generate the code as specified. 

2. Inplementation of Predefined Pragmas 

2.1. COTTROLLED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 

2.2. ELABORATE 

This pragma is inplemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.3. INLINE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.4. INTERFACE 

This pragma supports calls to 'C' and FORTRAN functions. The 
Ada subprograms can be either functions or procedures. The 
types of parameters and the result type for functions must 
be scalar, access or the predefined type ADDRESS in SYSTEM. 
All parameters nnist have mode IN. Record and array objects 
can be passed by reference using the ADDRESS attribute. 

2.5. LIST 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 


C-4 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


2.6. MEMORY_SIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.7. NON_REENTRANT 

This pragma takes one argument which can be the name of 
either a library subprogram or a subprogreun declared immedi¬ 
ately within a library package spec or body. It indicates 
to the compiler that the subprogram will not be called 
recursively allowing the conpiler to perform specific optim¬ 
izations. The pragma can be applied to a subprogram or a 
set of overloaded subprograsm within a package spec or pack¬ 
age body. 

2.8. NOT_ELABORATED 

This pragma can only appear in a library package specifica¬ 
tion. It indicates that the package will not be elaborated 
because it is either part of the RTS, a configuration pack¬ 
age or an Ada package that is referenced from a language 
other than Ada. The presence of this pragma suppresses the 
generation of elaboration code and issues warnings if ela¬ 
boration code is required. 

2.9. OPTIMIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 


2.10. PACK 

This pragma will cause the compiler to choose a non-aligned 
representation for composite types. It will not causes 
objects to be packed at the bit level. 

2.11. PAGE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.12. PASSIVE 

The pragma has three forms : 

PRAOIA PASSIVE; 

PRAGMA PASSIVE (SEMAPHORE); 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(INTERRUPT, <number>); 


Itiis pragma Pragma passive can be applied to a task or task

type declared imnediately within a library package spec or 
body. The pragma directs the conpiler to optimize certain 
tasking operations. It is possible that the statements in a 
task body will prevent the intended optimization, in these 
cases a warning will be generated at compile time euv3 will 
raise TASKING_ERROR at runtime. 

2.13. PRIORITY 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.14. SHARED 

This pragma is recognized by the inplementation but has no 
effect. 

2.15. STORAGE_UNIT 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.16. SUPPRESS 

This pragma is inplemented as described, except that 
DIVISION CHECK and in some cases OVERFLOW_CHECK cannot be 
supresse3. 

2.17. SYSTEM_NAME 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by meeuns of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

3. Implementation-Dependent Attributes 

3.1. P'REF 

For a prefix that denotes an object, a program unit, a 
ledsel, or an entry; 

This attribute denotes the effective address of the first of 
the storage units allocated to P. For a subprogreun, pack¬ 
age, task unit, or ledDel, it refers to the address of the 
machine code associated with the corresponding body or 
statement. For an entry for which an address clause has 
been given, it refers to the corresponding hardware inter¬ 
rupt. The attribute is of the type OPERAND defined in the 
package MACHINE_CODE. The attribute is only allowed within 
a machine code procedure. 

See section F.4.8 for more information on the use of this

attribute. 

(For a package, task unit, or entry, the 'REF attribute is 
not supported.) 

3.2. T'TASKID 


For a task object or a value T, T'TASK_ID yields the unique 
task id associated with a task. The value of this attribute 
is of the type ADDRESS in the package SYSTEM.

5. Restrictions On Representation Clauses 

5.1. Pragma PACK 

In the e±)sence of pragma PACK record conponents are padded 
so as to provide for efficient access by the target 
hardware, pragma PACK applied to a record eliminate the pad¬ 
ding where possible. Pragma PACK has no other effect on the 
storage allocated for record conponents a record representa¬ 
tion is required. 

5.2. Size Clauses 

For scalar types a representation clause will pack to the 
number of bits required to represent the range of the sub- 
type. A size clause applied to a record type will not cause 
packing of components; aui explicit record repre;.entation 
clause must be given to specify the packing of the com¬ 
ponents. A size clause applied to a record type will cause 
packing of components only vrtien the coitponent type is a 
discrete type. An error will be issued if there is insuffi¬ 
cient space allocated. The SIZE attribute is not supported 
for task, access, or floating point types. 

5.3. Address Clauses 

Address clauses are only supported for variables. Since 
default initialization of a variedsle requires evaluation of 
the variable address elaboration ordering requirements 
prohibit inititalization of a variables which have address 
clauses. The specified address indicates the physical 
address associated with the varie±)le. 

5.4. Interrupts 

Interrupt entries are supported with the following interpre¬ 
tation and restrictions: 

An interrupt entry may not have any parameters. 

A passive task that contains one or more interrupt entries 
must always be trying to accept each interrupt entry, unless 
it is heuidling the interrupt. The task must be executing 
either an accept for the entry (if there is only one) or a 
select statement where the interrupt entry accept alterna¬ 
tive is open as defined by Ada RM 9.7.1(4). This is not a 
restriction on normal tasks (i.e., signal ISRs). 


C-9 






APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


An interrupt acts as a conditional entry call in that inter¬ 
rupts are not queued (see the last sentence of Ada RM 
13.5.1(2) and 13.5.1(6)). 

No additional requirements are inposed for a select state¬ 
ment containing both a terminate alternative and an accept 
alternative for an interrupt entry (see Ada RM 13.5.1(3)). 

Direct calls to an interrupt entry from cinother task are 
allowed and are treated as a normal task rendezvous. 

Interrupts are not queued. 

The address clause for an interrupt entry does not specify 
the priority of the interrupt. It sinply specifies the 
interrupt vector number. For passive ISRs, the nnn of the 
passive(interrupt,nnn) pragma specifies the interrupt prior¬ 
ity of the task. 

5.5. Representation Attributes 

The ADDRESS attribute is not supported for the following 
entities; 

Packages 

Tasks 

Labels 

Entries 

5.6. Machine Code Insertions 
Machine code insertions are supported. 

The general definition of the package MAC:hine_C(X)E provides 
an assembly language interface for the target machine. It 
provides the necessary record type(s) needed in the code 
statement, an enumeration type of all the opcode mneumonics, 
a set of register definitions, euid a set of addressing mode 
functions. 

The general synteix of a machine code statement is as fol¬ 
lows; 


CODE_n'( opcode, operand {, operand) ); 

where n indicates the number of operands in the aggregate. 

A special case arises for a variable number of operands. 
The operands are listed within a subaggregate. The format 
is as follows; 

CODE_N'( opcode, (operand {, operand)) ); 


C-10 






APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


For those opcodes that require no operands, named notation 
must be used (cf. RM 4.3(4)). 

CODE_0'( op => opcode ); 

The opcode must be an enumeration literal (i.e. it cannot be 
an object, attribute, or a rename). 

An operand can only be an entity defined in MACHINE_CCX)E or 
the 'REF attribute. 

The arguments to any of the functions defined in 
MACHINE_CODE must be static expressions, string literals, or 
the functions defined in MACHINEjCODE. The 'REF attribute 
may not be used as an argument in any of these functions. 

Inline expansion of machine code procedures is supported. 

6. Conventions for Inplementation-generated Names 
There are no inplementation-generated names. 

7. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clauses 

Address expressions in an address clause are interpreted as 
physical addresses. 

8. Restrictions on Unchecked Conversions 
None. 

9. Restrictions on Unchecked Deallocations 
None. 


10. Inplementation Characteristics of I/O Packages 

Instantiations of DIRECT_IO use the value MAX_REC_SIZE as 
the record size (expressed in STORAGE_UNITS) when the size 
of ELEMENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For example for uncon¬ 
strained arrays such as string where ELEMENT_TYPE'SIZE is 
very large, MAX_REC_SIZE is used instead. MAX_RECORD_SIZE 
is defined in SYSTEM and ceui be changed lay a program before 
instantiating DIRECT_IO to provide an upper limit on the 
record size. In any case the meucimum size supported is 1024 
X 1024 X STORAGE_UNIT bits. DIRECT_IO will raise USE_ERROR 
if MAX_REC_SIZE exceeds this absolute limit. 

Instantiations of SEQUn^IAL_IO use the value MAX_REC_SIZE 
as the record size (expressed in STORAGE_UNITS) vrtien the 
size of ELEMENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For example for 
unconstrained arrays such as string where ELEMENr_TYPE'SIZE 
is very large, MAX_REC_SIZE is used instead. 


C-11 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


MAX_RECORD SIZE is defined in SYSTEM and cein be changed by a 
program beTore instantiating INTEGER_IO to provide an upper 
limit on the record size. SEQUENTIAL_IO irtposes no limit on 
MAX_REC_SIZE. 

11. Inplementation Limits 

The following limits are actually enforced by the implemen¬ 
tation. It is not intended to inply that resources up to or 
even near these limits are available to every program. 

11.1. Line Length 

The implementation supports a maximum line length of 500 
characters including the end of line character. 

11.2. Record and Array Sizes 

The maximum size of a statically sized array type is 
4,000,000 X STORAGE_UNITS. The maximum size of a statically 
sized record type is 4,000,000 x STORAGE_UNITS. A record 
type or array type declaration that exceeds these limits 
will generate a warning message. 

11.3. Default Stack Size for Tasks 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGE_SIZE length specifica¬ 
tion every task except the main program is allocated a fixed 
size stack of 10,240 STORAGE_UNITS. This is the value 
returned by T'STORAGE_SIZE for a task type T. 

11.4. Default Collection Size 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGE_SIZE length attribute 
the default collection size for an access type is 100 times 
the size of the designated type. This is the value returned 
by T'STORAGE_SIZE for an access type T. 

11.5. Limit on Declared Objects 

There is an absolute limit of 6,000,000 x STORAGE_UNITS for 
objects declared statically within a compilation unit. If 
this value is exceeded the coitpiler will terminate the com¬ 
pilation of the unit with a FATAL error message.
