Simulation of Devices with Molecular Potentials 
Reporting period: 04/01/07- 11/30/13 


1 Problems Studied 

The objectives of this project were (1) to design, implement, and analyze novel optimization 
algorithms for generating the coordinate space trajectories of molecules that are undergo¬ 
ing conformational transformations as a result of light-induced excitations and subsequent 
relaxation processes and (2) to improve the PFs existing Wigner-Poisson code to enable 
simulations of devices with more complex barrier structures. 

In the period of this report the project has supported three Ph. D. students: David 
Mokrauer, who hnished his Ph. D. in 2012, Anne Costolanski, who hnished her Ph. D. in 
2013, and James Nance. 

Publications from the project include a book [16], seven journal papers [5,14,17,18,27, 
29,30] two Ph. D. theses [4,31], two articles in refereed proceedings [6,28], one submitted 
journal paper [35], and a Sandia technical report [7]. 

2 Important Results 

2.1 Molecular Confirmation and Dynamics 

The objective in this part of the project was to design an efficient algorithm for simulation 
of light-induced molecular transformations. The simulation seeks to follow the relaxation 
path of a molecule after excitation by light. The simulator is a predictive tool to see if light 
excitation and subsequent return to the unexcited or ground state will produce a different 
conhguration than the initial one. 

We simulate the results of the excitation, rather than the excitation itself. The excitation 
will change the quantum state of a molecule. Our objective is to design software that will 
let one explore the possible changes in a molecule after a sequence of excitations. 

The goals of the simulation are not only to identify the end point, but to report the 
entire path in an high-dimensional conhguration space so that one can look for nearby paths 
to interesting conhgurations and examine the energy landscape near the path to see if low 
energy barriers make jumping to a different path possible. We will describe the hnal version 
of the algorithm from [31]. This version represents an evolution of the ideas from earlier 
versions of the algorithm [28-30]. The software has also been applied to sensors in [3]. 

As pointed out in these earlier papers, previous work on this type of problem (see [26,32, 
36], for example) did not address the general simulation issue, but rather were investigations 
of specihc reactions using Gaussian scans of the surface for the particular molecule of interest. 
We are the hrst to address the general problem for more than a single degree of freedom. 
Our approach uses the Smolyak sparse interpolation [34] method to build a surrogate model 


1 



of an expensive molecular dynamics code (in our particular case Gaussian [11]), and uses 
that model to drive a numerical ODE integrator. 

We begin in § 2.1.1 with a precise statement of the problem and the stages of model 
reduction we will need to make a solution computationally tractable. 


2.1.1 Background 

The task is to develop a design tool which will simulate molecular changes after excitation. 
Ideally, we would do this by computing the ground state, simulating excitation with a quan¬ 
tum chemistry code (in our case Gaussian [11]), and then following the gradient descent path 
in molecular conhguration space (bond lengths, valence angles, and torsion angles). 

Molecules of interest can have hundreds of atoms and degrees of freedom. One cannot 
vary all of the degrees of freedom at once in a dynamic simulation because the simulator is 
too computationally costly. Hence, we must apply several layers of model reduction. 

The hrst of these is to isolate a few molecular coordinates of particular interest and vary 
only those in the dynamic simulation. The simulator computes an energy S£{p) as a function 
of a vector of conhguration variables (torsion and bond angles) p G and the quantum 
state £ = 0,1,.... We split 



into a low-dimensional vector of design variables x and the remainder Given i, we compute 
the energy Ei{x) as a function of x alone via 


Ee^x) 


minSf, 



( 1 ) 


Gaussian approximates the solution of the optimization problem in (1) with a variant of the 
the BEGS [1,8,9,12,15,33] algorithm. The objective of this project is to simulate excitation 
of a molecule from one quantum state ^ to another and the subsequent relaxation to a local 
minimum of E^/. The simulator will do this repeatedly for a sequence of states, beginning 
and ending at £ = 0. We seek a sequence of states for which the initial conhguration at the 
ground state {£ = 0) is diherent from the one at the end of the sequence of excitations. 

For each £, we would ideally compute the local minimum with the gradient descent 
method, i. e. integrate the dynamics 


X = -VEe{x) (2) 

with initial data given either by the ground state conhguration (for £ = 0 at the start of 
the simulation) or by the result of excitation from a local minimum at another state. The 
evaluation of VEi is too expensive to drive the numerical solution of (2), so we apply a 
second level of model reduction and replace Eg with a piecewise polynomial interpolant. 
This is sufficient, if done carefully, to solve simple problems with as many as two degrees 
of freedom [i. e. £ G R^), and we report on results with a simple two-dimensional spline 
interpolation in [28,29]. The problems with such an interpolation are that the number of 


2 



nodes increases exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom (the size of x) and one 
must take care with the ordering of the evaluation of the nodes to make sure that the internal 
optimization has a sufficiently good initial iteration. The internal optimization in Gaussian 
can fail if one does not pay attention to the latter problem. 

Our solution to this complexity problem was to use a sparse grid [34] for the interpolation 
nodes. The size of the grid grows polynomially with the dimension. Moreover the grids for 
given orders of accuracy are nested, enabling us to perform error estimation and control. 

2.1.2 Results 

Mokrauer defended his thesis [31] and graduated in August 2012. His research with the PI 
was the hrst to use sparse interpolation as a surrogate model for molecular potential energy 
functionals. This is important as it enables one to remove calls to a quantum chemistry 
simulator from a dynamic simulation of light-induced molecular transition dynamics. The 
papers from his thesis [27-30,30] have all appeared. Mokrauer’s LITES code has been used 
in [3,27,30] for simulation of Butene, Stilbene, and Azo-benzene. 

The algorithm in the LITES code builds the interpolation adaptively, iterpolating over 
patches in conhguration space as the integration of the dynamics progresses. While this 
worked well, we are not rethinking that approach as we hnd ways to interpolate an entire 
energy landscape with a single interpolation. 

The Azo-Benzene simulation encountered difficulties because two energy surfaces inter¬ 
sected. James Nance, the final student on the project, was working on making the evaluation 
of the sparse interpolant more efficient so we can simultaneously track multiple conforma¬ 
tional paths from different initial points. 

When the project ended, the PI found new funding for Nance and we hope to continue 
the work. This will not only be useful in understanding what happens near local maxima 
after a drop from an excited state to a lower one, but also what happens when a path crosses 
an intersection of energy surfaces. We must also, of course, devise an efficient and robust 
approach to detecting intersections. Our hrst approach at this will be simply to look for a 
sign change in the difference of energies on the two paths as the integration progresses. 

Nance and the PI have made improvements to the algorithms in Mokrauer’s work. The 
simulation is now fast enough to run ensembles of trajectories in conhguration space to 
capture the ehects of thermal huctuations. 

2.2 Wigner-Poisson Solver 

In § 2.2.1 we will describe the problem and the older work of the PI and others. In § 2.2.2 
we will summarize the results obtained in this project. 

2.2.1 Background 

The Wigner-Poisson equation [37] is an integro-diherential equation that models the quantum 
transport of electrons in a semiconductor device, such as an resonant tunneling diode [2,10, 


3 



38,39]. The steady-state equation is for the distribution function f{x,k), which depends 
on space x and momentum k. The steady-state problem is of interest in its own right, and 
for analysis of dynamic stability of solutions of the time-dependent problem. We write the 
equation using the notation from [38] as 

W(f) = Df + P(f)+(^] =0. (3) 

\ ^ / coll 


The linear term Df on the right side of (3) represents the kinetic energy effects on the 
distribution and is given by 

_i^dl 

27 rm* dx 

In (4), h is Planck’s constant and m* is the effective mass of the electron. The second term, 
P{f), is the nonlinear term in the equation and accounts for the potential energy effects on 
the distribution

equations for /o differ both in form and in analytic properties from those for the nonzero-bias 
case. 

Boundary conditions are imposed at the device edges to describe the distribution of 
electrons entering the device. On the left (x = 0), we have for k > 0 (electrons with positive 
momentum that are moving right)

potential u{x). The electrostatic potential is the solution of Poisson’s equation

In (10), q is the charge of the electron, e is the dielectric constant, and Nd{x) is the doping 
prohle. Nd is piecewise constant, with a small number (< 10) of discontinuities. The 
boundary conditions for (10) are 


d'^u _ 
dx'^ e 


n(0) = 0,u{L) = -Vbias, (11) 

where Vbias > 0 is the applied voltage (bias). The potential U is given by 

U{x) = u{x) + Ac{x), (12) 

where Ac{x) is piecewise constant with a small number of discontinuities. 

We will assume that the structure is symmetric about x = ^, i. e. 

Nd{x) = Nd{L - x) and Ac(a;) = Ac(T - x). (13) 

To evalnate the integral in (6) we must extend U outside of the interval [0,L]. We do this 
by dehning U{x) = U (L) for a; > L and U{x) = U (0) for a; < 0. With this dehnition, U is 
a piecewise smooth function of x, having discontinuities where Ac does, /o is the solution 
to the zero-bias problem (Vbias = 0), which differs from the nonzero-bias (Vbias > 0) case in 
that the collision term is missing from the integro-partial differential eqnation, resnlting in 

W(f) = Df + P(f) = 0, (14) 

and = 0 in the boundary conditions (11) for the Poisson equation. 

Unlike [38], where the momentnm was nnbonnded, older work [20,21,23-25,40] of the 
PI and his collaborators limited k. The reasons for this were that the standard discretiza¬ 
tion [2, 38] has been found to fail to converge as the number of grid points in momentnm 
increases [19], whereas limiting A to a physically reasonable value enable not only nnmerical 
observations of convergence, bnt also a proof [19,24]. 

2.2.2 Results 

The work in the current project [4-6] began by correcting some errors in the discretizations 
in the fortran codes. This led to a signihcant improvement in accuracy [5], which the PI 
improved further with a grid that was nonuniform in both space and momentnm. Costolanski 
and the PI implemented these ideas in a matlab code. The matlab code was promising enough 
to motivate us to implement the new discretization in C-I--I- and parallelize the algorithm 
using the Sandia Trilinos [13] framework. 

Costolanski’s hnal C-I--I- code has non-nniform grids in both space and momentum [6]. 
Costolanski gradnated in August 2013. Her thesis reports on numerical to determine the 


5 



difference between the discretizations from [10,38] and those from [22-24], grid refinement 
studies, stability analysis, and continuation results. Her work corrected several errors in 
previous simulators and, at least numerically, gave new insights into the dynamic stability 
of the Wigner-Poisson model.
