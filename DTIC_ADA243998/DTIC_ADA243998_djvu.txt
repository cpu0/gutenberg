1. INTRODUCTION 












The use of compilers and tools that support modem software engineering practices has the 
potential to greatly increase programmer productivity. Many U, S. and European companies are 
offering off-the-shelf products that support some aspect of the software engineering process with 
choices of design and development paradigms, and implementation language. The Department of 
Defense (DoD) is interested in the status of maricet offerings for software engineering environments 
to support the software life cycle. 

The Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) was tasked by the Director of Defense 
Information, Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense (C3I) to identify, analyze, and report on (1) 
compiler and automated engineering tools that can support and supplement current software 
development, integration, test, and support functions of Ada and C-h- programming languages, and 
(2) associated training and education available for each language. This report will be one of several 
information sources used by the DoD in the development of a business case to determine whether 
any waivers to the Ada requirement for business systems may be warranted. 


1.1 BACKGROUND 

The Ada programming language, standardized in 1983, is Congressionally mandated for 
software development within the DoD. The 1983 standard, informally known as Ada83, is currently 
under revision in the normal American National Standards Institute (ANSI) process. IWo important 
changes planned are an extension of Ada’s data abstracticm c^abilities, adding object-oriented 
programming features, and improved ctmtrol over concurrency for real-time applications. The DoD 
has also established a rigorous conq)iler testing and validation process used in the U. S. and Europe 
as a mechanism for determining conformity to the standard. 

C++ is an incremental addition to the C language that includes type checking and provides 
object-oriented programming features. The C language was standardized in 1989 but there is no 
standard for C++ and no formal compQer testing and validation process for C or C++. Thus, there 
could be considerable variation among the C++ products reported in this study; time constraints 
preclude conducting an in-depth analysis of this variability.

12 SCOPE 


This report documents a five-week effort to collect and analyze informaticm on the market 
availability of Ada and C++ compilers, tools, education, and training. We have eliminated from 
discussion such application domains as artificial intelligence, computer-aided design, and 
embedded systems because the primary focus of this study is on business systems. We also excluded 
Fourth Generation Languages (4GLs) as a category of Computer-aided Software Engineering 
(CASE) tools because 4GLs are for the most part proprietary, non-procedural languages that have 
limited utility during the maintenance phase of a large, complex business application. Where they 
were reported, we made note of extended compiler libraries that provide interfaces or bindings to 
other Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) languages and protocols and to International 
Organization for Standards (ISO) libraries. For the purpose of this report, we considered operating 
system services and utilities generally provided with computer systems as basic extensions to the 
capabilities of a software engineering environment. Finally, only commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) 
products available from U. S. vendors were considered in this study. 


13 DEFINITION OF TERMS 

TTiere are many tool vendors who offer products for specific jobs during software 
development. Some tools are designed for use with a particular programming language, with a 
particular program development method, or during a specific part of the software life cycle. In this 
report, we have investigated the availability of tools that are coupled with compilers and those that 
extend software engineering support of certain phases of the software life cycle. For the purpose of 
this report, the following definitions of terms apply: 

• Tool: A tool is a software product or package which serves a quite specific and narrow 
purpose for programming such as, for example, a source code editor or a static debugger. 

• CASE: CASE tools are collections of tools that support specific task activities 
performed during the software life cycle, such as requirements analysis, preliminary 
design, program testing, or verification. 

• Environment An environment is used here to mean computer and communications 
hardware and software, including operating systems and a tool set for supporting tasks 
during the software life cycle. Some degree of interoperability among tools may exist 
but the general translation of data structures and their semantics among tools and 
environments without loss of information requires further research and development. 




1.4 APPROACH 


' Commercial suppliers of Ada and C++ con^ilers, CASE tools, and training in the use of 

Ada and C++ were contacted by telephone to solicit the information used in this study. The source 
of information concerning commercial suppliers was lists published by the Association for 
Computer Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Ada (SIGAda), Ada Joint Program Office 
1 (AJPO), journals and data collected by IDA in connection with several other tasks such as Ada 

Technology Insertion and the Strategic Defense Initiative Office (SDIO) Software Technology Plan. 
Data collected during the survey was analyzed to determine current status and indications of trends 
of significance to information business systems. Since the information on specific products and 
1 ^ training collected during this study may be of interest to others concerned with the application of 

Ada and C++, it is documented in Appendices A-H.

2. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION 




2.1 Ada COMPILERS AND TOOLS 

There are 28 companies located in the U. S. that have Ada compilers with current validated 
status. The official list of validated Ada compilers published by the AJPO and National Institute of 
Science and Technology (NIST) pairs Ada compiler names with the computer systems that make 
up a validated Ada implementation. 

For this survey, the following information was solicited from compiler vendors: 

• products (how the compiler is marketed and any other tools) 

• prices 

• maturity (earliest validation date) 

• education/training (includes courses and consulting) 

• other languages (specifically C++) 

• customer base 

Table 1 provides the names of companies contacted during this survey along with data on 
platform type, prices, and primary business of the company. 

Appendix A documents the information provided by the coiiq)iler vendors.

2.1.1 Ada programming tools are available with the compiler or as extra options. 

All of the vendors provide a minimal set of tools for Ada code development which includes 
the compiler, editor, debugger, library manager, and runtime environment. Beyond this minimal set, 
vendors also pffer an optimizer, profiler, language-sensitive editor, cross referencer, math library, 
and simulator (if a cross-compilation system). The major variability of these offerings is whether 
the tools are bundled in the compiler price or are sold separately. Special tools, such as the language- 
sensitive editor or profiler, are often part of a package of software engineering tools that can be 
purchased separately. Bindings to software products such as IBM’s database (IMS), graphical data 
display, and interactive program development facility are provided by several vendors who supply 
the IBM mainframe Ada environment for business applications. Compiler vendors are beginning to 
provide bindings to standards such as X-Windows, Stmctured (Juery Language (SQL), 
Programmer’s Hierarchical Interactive Graphics (PHIGS), and MOTIF to facilitate development of 
user interfaces to applications and data. 


2.1.2 Ada compilers and tools are hosted on a variety of computer manufacturer equipment 
and widely available operating systems. 

Compilers and environments are offered for personal computers (PCs), woricstations, and 
mainframes that are available on General Services Administration (GSA) schedules, DoD 
requirements contracts, or are part of the government’s installed inventory of general purpose 
computers. Industry promotion of Motorola and Intel processors has resulted in the availability of 
compilers that are compatible with PCs and workstations sold under many brand names. The 
enduring popularity of MS/DOS and UNIX for PCs and workstations is also reflected in the 
availability of Ada compilers from more than one vendor. For example, four Ada compiler vendors 
provide compilers for PCs operating under MS/DOS 3.0 or higher while eight vendors provide 
compilers for UNIX-based operating systems for PCs, woricstations (including Reduced Instruction 
Set Computer (RISC) machines), and mainfimie computers. The installed customer base of Digital 
Equipment Coporation (DEC) in the U. S. is reflected in the number of Ada compiler vendors (six) 
who provide compilers and tools for DEC’s VMS operating system. Three vendors provide 
compilers and tools for IBM’s mainframe operating systems. TVo vendors also provide Ada 
compilers and tools for the Macintosh. 

Ada compiler vendors are sensitive to commercial demand for a particular computer and/ 
or operating system. Watching what a compiler vendor drops from his validation schedule is a 
perceived weakness in commercial demand for a computer system. The cost of obsolescence is 
unknown; however, it is true that the government must pay higher than typical maintenance fees for 





equipment, operating systems, and Ada environments that have been made obsolescent by 
technology advances. One conq)iler vendor stated that the maintenance fee is $50,000 per year for 
a compiler version that is not a current product. It has been estimated by several compiler vendors 
that they spend approximately $100,000 for each compiler version that successfully completes the 
Ada validation process every two years. Naturally, vendors intend to maximize their return on 
investment by targeting growing industry markets. However, government users may not be able to 
find an Ada compiler for vintage Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) and operating 
systems without paying a compiler vendor to customize a compiler for them. 


2.13 There are two major vendor cat^ories: compiler developers and system vendors. 

The Ada compiler developers (12 of 28) are those that build Ada compilers as their primary 
business activity. They build compilers (and tools) for a variety of hosts and target computers with 
cross-compilation support suitable for real-time and embedded applications. The second category 
of system vendors (16 of 28) are those that build systems and provide an Ada compiler for their 
hardware systems. In some cases, the system vendors have obtained a compiler from an Ada 
compiler developer. 

During the survey, one vendor indicated that he believed that almost all the system vendors 
had their compilers originally developed by one of the “Ada compiler developers.” It appears that 
these developers and at least one of the system vendors (DEQ were the commercial source of the 
Ada compiler technology. For example, Telesoft does about $1 million in business a year with Cray 
to maintain the Ada compiler on that machine, though the compiler is marketed through Cray only. 
Thus, many of the system vendors are actually customers of the compiler developers, and the same 
compiler can in some cases be obtained from either the system vendor or the developer. 


2.1.4 Compiler purchase prices range firom $249 for a PC to $400,000 for a multi-user 
mainframe. 

The average price for an environment is $7500 for a network file server. For a PC, there are 
compilers ranging from $249 to $3000, depending on the number of tools provided and the power 
of the PC. Discounts of 20-30% are negotiable and at least two vendors provide discounts to 
academic users. The price of software for mainframes is the highest and also provides a richer 
environment than is possible for a PC or worirstation. Some vendors provide monthly lease cations 
and separate maintenance contracts. A maintenance contract witfi the compiler vendor includes 
software problems/enors fixes and product improvements in successively validated versions of the 
compiler.

2.1^ Three Ada vendors support IBM business system environments. 

Historically, business systems maintain corporate data bases and financial systems on IBM 
equipment or Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) compatible computers. The following is a profile 
of the tools and interface packages available for mainframes and IBM operating systems (i.e., VM/ 
SP, VM/XA, VM/ESA, MVS/SP): 

• on-line publication system 

• source-code formatter 

• library manager 

• source-level debugger 

• profiler (run-time performance measurements) 

• dependency lister 

• cross-reference utility 

• interface to graphical data display (IBM environment) 

• interface to interactive program development facility (IBM environment) 

• interface to Infonnation Management System (IMS) (IBM environment) 

• standard math fimetions, including ISO Numerics Working Group (NUMWG) 

Information provided by IBM indicates that Ada is a major product strategy and that 
implementing bindings and protocols to access products inq)lementing other standards is being 
pushed (e.g., SQL, PHIGS, Portable Operating System Interface for Computing Environments 
(POSDQ). In addition to IBM, Ada compilers for IBM system environments are provided by 
Intermetrics and Alsys. 


2.1.6 StabUity and maturity characterize Ada vendors. 

Most of the vendors (20 of 28) have provided validated conqrilers for mwe fiian 5 years. 
That is a relatively mature group of vendors, given that the Ada language standard dates from 1983. 
In the past three years, vendors have enlarged the basic con^iler tool set to include design, 
documentation and testing tools and are now offering some bindings to FIPS and industry standards 
(e.g., X-Windows, MOTIF). 










Information concerning the customer base was either not available or companies were 
unwilling to disclose these numbers. From the information obtained, there appears to be a wide 
variance in the size of the customer base. If the vendor (such as Alliant) makes siq)ercomputers, 
then its customer base may only be a handful. Conversely, a vendor of DOS-based systems (such 
as Meridian) may claim a customer base of several thousand. 


2.1.7 Ada compilers provide interfaces to other languages. 

The pre-defined pragma interface is a feature of the Ada language that has caused concern 
about the uniformity of “openness” among Ada compilers. A review of recent validation documents 
for the 150 conq)ilers fonnally tested under Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC) 1.11 
shows that almost all compilers support pragma interface to assembler languages of various sorts, 
C, and Fortran languages. Several provide an interface to Pascal and one to Cobol. The ability to 
import and export names and objects permits programmers to reuse non-Ada programs and 
operating systems or run-time services. (See Appendix B for interface names.) 


2.1.8 New developments 

For a handiiil of vendors (DEC, IBM, Verdix), there is a movement towards providing an 
“integrated development envirorunent” that encompasses most phases of the software development 
life cycle. For the implementation phase, there are tool sets offered with the compiler. For the phases 
of requirements definition and design, this environment supports various off-the-shelf CASE tools. 
The objective is to eliminate some of the redundant work in going from requirements to design and 
from design to implementation. Both DEC and Verdix have either a database or “object repository” 
that maintains those objects. 


2.2 C-H-COMPILERS AND TOOLS 

Eighteen out of the 22 vendors surveyed market C++ products on the commercial mariret 
as well. One of the 22 vendors sells only to other software vendors and 3 conq)anies claimed to not 
have the C++ products. Table 2 is a summary of the data collected and documented in Appendix C.

2 J.1 C-H- vendors provide programming environments composed of products that are 
differentiated by features and implementation strategy. 

» 

The two kinds of development products that accept C++ programs are compilers and 
translators. For the purpose of this survey, a Compiler is a process which accepts a C++ source file 
as input and produces a file containing an executable or linkable program for some computer. 

^ Whereas, a translator is a process which accepts a C++ source file and produces a C language source 

file that can be input to a C compiler. Vendors provide compilers or translators with or without class 
libraries and various development tools. 

Differences among C++ development products include operating systems and hardware 
platforms on which they function and the availability of other compatible product features. These 
^ features include operating environments and tools as well as language elements. Descriptions of 

some C++ product features follows. 

AT&T provides a product called “cftont” which is a front end or preprocessor for C++ 
source code. This product has been adopted by some as a standard for the C++ language semantics. 
* While there continues to be no formal C++ standard, several vendors offer products which began 

as licensed versions of “cfront” or are fully compatible with its semantics. In the survey of C++ 
vendors, nearly half claim such compatibility. 

A feature of the C++ language is its facility for inheritance by an object fix>m a parent object 
^ or object class. To augment this facility, vendors may supply libraries of object classes with their 

products: more than half the vendors surveyed do so. An ANSI committee, seeking to define C++ 
standards, plans to describe the minimum list of required classes for a class library. 

An in:q)lementation of a C++ development product generally provides either command line 
^ execution or an integrated development environment (IDE) or both. An IDE is a facility to 

interactively connect a source editor, a compiler or translator, and a runtime environment. Usually 
the IDE is centered around a user interface such as a windowing c^ability. From the IDE a 
developer can maintain the connection among the edit, compile or translate, and execute processes. 
In other words, a user who is editing the source of a program can tell the environment to compile 
and execute the program. The IDE will then provide the necessary ctHinections among the source 
file, the compiler, the runtime environment and any other tools or libraries needed. Most of the C++ 
vendors claim to have an IDE. 

Inheritance of attributes by an object from another object is a feature of object-oriented 
^ programming (OOP) and the C++ language. For an object to inherit from a single parent is called 

single inheritance: to be able to inherit some features firom one parent and scane from another is 
called multiple inheritance. Multiple inheritance is more powerful but is considered more difiScult 
for programmers. Users of C++ do not agree on whether multiple inheritance should be included in 
’ the language; however, most of the vendors surveyed cl^ to provide multiple inheritance. 


13 




Vendors provide several features which, for purposes of this survey, are called version 
control. Version control includes the ability to keep track of previous versions of various levels of 
program elements such as source code, relocatable objects, and executable modules. In the software 
development area version control includes archiving previous versions, providing release 
descriptions, controlling which modules need to be compiled before linking (called the “make” 
feature), etc. Nearly half the vendors surveyed claim to provide some kind of version control. 

Cross compilation is a process which executes on one platform producing an executable 
program that runs on a different target platform. As an example, a Fortran or Pascal compiler 
running on a DEC VAX computer may produce output which will execute on an IBM PC. Some of 
the vendors surveyed claimed to provide cross compilers. 

C++ compilers accept source program input which adheres to some description of C++ 
syntax and semantics. A subset of C++ is some version of the C language, but not necessarily ANSI 
C. A feature of a C++ compiler is its ability to accept and correctly conq>ile any source file which 
complies with the ANSI C standard. Most vendors surveyed claim to be ANSI C compatible. 

A C++ development product may provide the capability to use other languages in several 
ways. The product may allow instructions in another language, usually assembler, to be included 
within the source file along with the C++ statements. In C++ this capability is called in-line code. 
Another way other languages can be used is by providing a way to link the ou^ut of another 
compiler or assembler with the output of the C++ compiler: In the DOS product world it is not 
unconunon for a vendor to provide such compatibility for some of its own products and some 
limited number of other products. In addition, many vendors include assemblers with their C++ 
products to provide programmers the ability to develop their own additional fimctions. This last 
case seemed to be most common among the vendors surveyed since about half claim to provide an 
assembler with their products. 

Many vendors provide debugging tools. A profiler is a more advanced debugger whidi 
provides a link between an executing program running under debug mode and the source statements 
from which each instruction came. Most vendors provide some form of debugger, a few claim to 
have profilers. 


2,2,2 The minority of C-i-f products are for PCs and workstations. 

The largest number of product offerings are for IBM PC-conq)atible systems running DOS 
and workstations running UNIX. For several other platforms there are individual offerings by 
platform vendors and by third party suppliers, such as prodticts that run on VAX/VMS fiom Digital 
Equipment Corporation and Bull/GCOS from Honeywell. 




The large mainframe manufacturers are not yet offering C++ for their systems. Thus, C++ 
compilers and translators are only available on small multi-user systems (e.g., AT&T B2). 


223 Most vendors are software distributors who have recently entered the market 

C++ development products, like Ada products, are available from both computer vendors 
and third party software vendors. The clear majority of currently available products are from 
software vendors. However, several computer companies have development efforts imderway. 
Some may develop their own products. Others are prone to license existing products from compiler 
development companies. Most vendors claim to have delivered their C++ development product 
within the past two years. About half of those have been on the market for a year or less. 


2,2.4 Purchase prices range from $150 to $20,000 for PC’s and small multi-user systems. 

With most software products like compilers, prices vary with the category of platform. In 
general, products divide along the lines of PC compatibles, workstations, and shared systems such 
as minicomputers and mainframes. This appears to hold for C++ development products. Products 
which run under DOS on PC compatibles are typically priced under $500. Workstation products 
tend to be under $2000. Some products for small, multi-user systems are priced up to $20,000. 
These prices tend to be in line with prices of other language compilers for the same platforms. 


2.2.5 Efforts are being organized to deveiop a C++ standard for the language and the class 
library. 

The companies are currently working on establishing ANSI and ISO standards for C++ are 
listed in Appendbi D. These standards will be in two areas, the language and the class library. 
Although the participants represent many companies and the committees are currently active, 
adoption of a standard is not expected in the immediate future. At present the committee appears to 
have the beginnings of a working document for the language but may not have begun to construct 
one for the library. 


22.6 Vendors of low cost C++ development products have a relatively large customer base. 

Gaims of installed base vary from very few to a high of around 350,000. These figures were 
not available from most vendors. The ones that were seem to be estimates and may not be accurate. 
There is, however, a trend which tends to indicate substantial sales of at least two products for DOS 



systems, Zortec C++ with 200,000 copies and Borland C++ with 350,000 copies, as well as some 
considerable activity in the workstation maiket. The estimated installed base figures show both 
interest by the development community and enough sales to indicate acceptance of the products. 
The apparent flurry of computer companies to provide C++ products for their systems indicates 
some acceptance of C++ as a programming language. 


22.1 C++ products provide interfaces to other software impiemented in C or assembler. 

External interfaces to other software products are available from some vendors. In 
particular, vendors tend to provide access to an assembler and in some cases other language 
interfaces. Other accesses are available to data base management systems and user interfaces like 
X-windows. It appears that almost any product available to a vendor’s C language product is also 
available to its C++ produa. 


2.2.8 New developments target mainfi'ame hardware systems. 

Although C++ development products are now on the market for PCs, workstations and 
shared systems, many more are on the way. As with most previous languages, computer vendors are 
anxious to provide C++ products which will take advantage of their own platform configurations. 
C++ projects are now underway at IBM, Honeywell, Hewlett-Packard, and many other companies. 
Expectations are that the language will be available for most major platforms in the United States. 


23 AVAILABILITY OF Ada AND C++ TRAINING AND EDUCATION 

In preparing this analysis, the following sources were used: 

• Ada Software Engineering Education and IVaining (ASEET) Data Base 

• The Journal for Object-Oriented Programming 

• Contacts within the academic and DoD areas 

Appendix E includes the updated ASEET database and sources for C++ training. The 
database includes the types of courses taught, and when available the cost and a point of contact 


16 






23.1 There are more sources of training and/or education for Ada usage than for C-m-. 


Since 1983, when Ada was adopted as an ANSI standard, the AJPO has emphasized the 
need for Ada education and training within the DoD, industry, and academia. One of the first 
initiatives was to encourage the creation of numerous Ada courses by both government and 
commercial organizations. Today, Ada training is available throughout the country, at least one 
university in every state teaching Ada. All three military academies offer Ada in their computer 
courses. We were not able to find any DoD facilities that taught C++; however, we have been told 
that the Naval Postgraduate School does use C++. In fact, most said they used Ada when teaching 
object-oriented design. The results of the survey on C++ in the universities is incomplete since most 
of the time was spent gathering information from C++ training vendors. Ada compiler vendors 
provide training for system designers and programmers in a classroom setting or as self-study books 
and software. 

Recent programmer interest in C++ parallels some of the developments of object-oriented 
system design methods and object-oriented data base products. Object-oriented programming 
(OOP) is an engineering technique used to solve problems that can be expressed in terms of objects, 
classes of objects, inherited properties, and state data. The superiority of OOP for all types of 
systems is yet to be demonstrated but it is a convenient solution when the environment is based upon 
UNIX and C. On the other hand, Ada is being used by computer scientists and programmers to 
implement systems that require solutions to a range of problems (i.e., temporal, function, and 
structure). See Appendix F for discussion of design paradigm needs.

232 There is some disparity between Ada and C++ training providers. 

In addition to university and compiler vendor courses, there are several Ada education and 
training vendors who specialize in teaching software engineering with Ada. The courses vary firom 
two-to-four hour introduction courses for managers to a one-or-two week long intensive Ada 
programming course. Some vendors charge a flat fee ($10,000) and limit the course to 12-20 people, 
while others charge per student ($ 1100/each). These courses may be taught either at the customer’s 
site or at a public seminar or a the vendor’s site. Most of the hands-on workshops do limit the 
number of participants, while a course such as the executive overview is left open. 

Most of the listings for C++ were independent training vendors. Many are small consulting 
firms that offer training only on the customer’s site. The average course is five days long and 
includes some type of hands-on lab. Most claim to provide hands-on for any type of platform for 
which C++ products are sold, although one firm stated that they only teach C++ on the Macintosh 
(Arbor Intelligent Systems, Inc.). The cost of these courses varies and does not include the travel 
and living expenses of the instructor. The student cost ranges from $695/each for a two-day course 
to $1,200/each for a five-day course to a set price of $9,900 for a four-day course with a maximum 
number of 20 students. Vendors always indicated that they could develop or customize a C++ for 








their customer if needed. Most of the companies are small (i.e., two to five people) and some of the 
vendors listed in the November-December 1990 issue of Journal of Object-Oriented Programming 
appear to have already gone out of business. 


2.4 STATUS OF CASE TOOLS. 

From a list of 200 commercial vendors of products, informally known as CASE tools, data 
was collected on 155 with 44 being classified by our definition as CASE tools. Tools that support 
particular design or analysis methodologies are not usually influenced by the choice of 
implementation language, but the majority of these CASE tools is not completely language 
independent because most generate code. Appendix G provides ten tables that consolidate 
descriptive information about CASE tools. Appendix H docaiiiviiiis, in more detail, the information 
collected on the 44 CASE tools. The following findings indicate the status of CASE tools. 


2.4.1 Structured Analysis (SA) and Structured Design (SD) are the most widely supported 
software development methods, although increasing support for object-oriented 
approaches is evident 

Methods for software design and then analysis fall into two groups; process-oriented 
methods to support the development of information systems, and behavior- or state-oriented 
methods for process-control systems. This distinction has blurred as the most popular, process- 
oriented methods, SA and SD, have been augmented with techniques for expressing behavior. In 
the last few years, an object orientation to software development has evolved. 

Over 65 % of CASE tools provide support for SA and SD and three quarters of these include 
the augmentations for expressing behavior. Over one quarter support OOD, and a quarter of these 
also support OOA. Nearly a fifth support both SA/SD and object-oriented approaches. More details 
on the method support offered by particular CASE tools ate presented in Appendix G, Tbble 2. 
Information on operating environments, breadth of use, report generation, adaptability, etc., can be 
found in Appendix G, Table 3. 




2.42 CASE tools for the development of information systems differ from those that support 
the development of other types of software. 

Roughly half as many CASE tools are intended for the development of information systems 
as for other types of software systems (for example, real-time and process control systems). The 
distinction between these two groups of CASE tools is evidenced in several ways. For example, 


20 



only those CASE tools intended for the development of information systems typically support data 
base design and, in the few cases where prototyping is provided, it supports user interface (forms 
and screen) design. Again, only information system-oriented CASE tools typically support business 
analysis and planning activities. On the other hand, CASE tools in the second group are more likely 
to support simulation and requirements tracing activities and to provide the users with a selection 
of development methods. 


2.43 Support for CASE tool customization is limited. 

Over 65% of CASE tools provide free-form or customizable graphics. Tailoring of the 
underlying development methods is much less frequent and generally requires the user to develop 
new code. Three vendors market tools that support rule-based customization of their CASE tool, 
two offer tools specifically intended to the user screens or menus, and one markets a meta-CASE 
tool that can be used to develop CASE software. See Table 4, Appendix G. 


2.4.4 The majority of CASE tools support source code generation. 

Virtually all CASE tools generate some type of code, though those that support the 
development of information systems may only generate data handling or user interface code. The 
language(s) generated varies, depending on the type of CASE tool considered: 

• CASE tools supporting the development of information systems either include tool 
components that generate code or link with independent application generators for this 
frmction. In the first case, code generators typically produce Cobol and C, and the 
introduction of Ada and C-h- has had little impact. In the second case, application 
generators (see Table 5, Appendix G) are traditionally devoted to the production of 
Cobol; although no application generators that support Ada have been identified, some 
support for C++ is evident. 

• Code generation for other types of software systems (e.g., process control, embedded, 
real time) favors (in descending order) C, Ada, Pascal, Fortran, C++, PL/I, and Jovial. 
The entire source code is not necessarily generated and some tools provide user- 
customizable templates that govern this partial generation. Support for C++ is one of the 
most frequently cited planned tool enhancements and C++ is expected to follow Ada in 
popularity within the next 18 months. 


21 



2.4^ C is being used by CASE tool developers. 

In terms of tool implementation language, the majority of CASE tools are implemented in 
C. However, over 20% of the vendors already have, or plan to, reimplement their products in C++. 
Fewer tools have been developed or reimplemented in Ada. Reasons for using C or C++ for tools 
may be based on economics. For example, C compilers are relatively inexpensive (no validation 
costs, smaller language, etc.) and existing C interfaces to windows and UNIX facilities reduces 
effort. 


2.4.6 Workstations are the favored hardware platform. 

The majority of CASE tools operate on woricstations and are capable of supporting multiple 
concurrent users over a network. Roughly two thirds are also supported on PCs, and roughly one 
third are also supported on mainframes. PCs and mainframes are rarely the only operating platform. 
The dependence of these tools on the underlying programming support environment is restricted to 
a language compiler and related language-sensitive tools. 


2.4.7 CASE vendors say they support open systems and interoperability. 

Roughly half of the CASE tool vendors state that their tools exist in an open environment. 
Many vendors further support interoperability by conforming with the de facto industry standard X- 
Windows. Support for the CASE Data Interchange Format (CDIF) (Electronics Industry 
Association) standard is less prevalent but increasingly apparent 


2.4.8 CASE vendors offer relatively mature products. 

While six tools are major extensions or reworks of products developed in the late 1970s and 
early 1980s, roughly half of the currently marketed CASE tools were introduced between 1984 and 
1987. Tools continue to be introduced. The initial focus on support for development of information 
systems has gradually changed and the majority of recent offerings support the development of real¬ 
time software systems. 

Some vendors report the number of licenses they have sold, whereas others measure us^e 
in terms of the number of installations. Until recently, information system-oriented CASE tools 
have been the most widely used, with installations and licenses numbering in the thousands. Over 
the last few years, increased awareness of software engineering and, peihaps, better marketing of 


22 





CASE products have led to wide usage of CASE tools supporting the development of other types 
of software systems. Table 1 (Appendix G) lists product introduction date and estimated customer 
base. 


2.4.9 Future lyends 

Bridges between CASE tools are increasingly used to extend the scope of software 
development activities supported by particular tools. Roughly one third of the CASE tools have 
vendor-supported bridges that exploit the capabilities of other CASE tools. While the majority of 
current bridges only support a one-way transition between tools, some bi-directional bridges are 
beginning to appear. In addition to allowing the use of specialized tools as required, these bridges 
can facilitate the reuse of software products developed using different tools. Table 6 (Appendix G) 
identifies the available bridges. 


2.4.10 CASE tools continually increase their coverage of software development activities. 

Early CASE tools focused on software analysis and design activities. Initial extensions 
focused on earlier development activities and led to the provision of requirements traceability 
capabilities. Roughly half the CASE tools provide this capability, the majority of which do so as an 
integral part of the tool. Another area of early extension was the provision of system specification 
and simulation capabilities. Roughly one third of the tools support system simulation, usually via a 
separately purchasable option. 

In the last few years, vendors have been introducing support for reverse engineering to 
facilitate software maintenance and, to some extent, reuse. Roughly half the CASE tools have this 
capability, and several more expect it within the next 18 months. Although usually provided as an 
integral part of the CASE tool, reverse engineering tools are also available as separately purchasable 
options and as stand-alone tools. Roughly equivalent numbers of tools are available for reverse 
engineering of Ada and C++. See Table 7 (Appendix G). 

A few CASE vendors are starting to support software testing. This capability is generally 
provided through separately purchasable options, primarily for Ada and C code. The stand-alone 
testing tools identified. See Table 8 (Appendix G), predominantly support Ada, although one vendor 
does offer support for C++. 


23 



2.4.11 CASE vendors talk about migration to repositories. 

Early CASE tools used a data dictionary to store definitions of the various data flows, 
processes, data stores, etc., specified as part of software analysis and design activities. A repository, 
in simple terms, is a central database that contains all information pertaining to a development 
effort It provides better support for information sharing among team members, tool integration, and 
new development paradigms such as Boehm’s risk-driven approach. An object-oriented repository, 
in particular, provides the flexibility to facilitate CASE customization and extension. All CASE 
tools introduced in the last couple of years en^loy repositories. A significant number of early tools 
have recently switched to a repository. 


2.4.12 Integration frameworks are increasingly preferred as a mechanism for integrating 
project management and similar tools with CASE tools. 

Repositories have led to the development of integration frameworks that provide a 
consolidation of the underlying information architecture to offer a disciplined approach to tool 
integration. They allow CASE tools to be integrated into a base set of capabilities supporting, for 
exan^le, resource management, change management, and access to multiple databases. Identified 
repositories are listed in Table 9 (Appendix G). 

IBM’s announced integration framework, AD/Cycle, is expected to have a a significant 
impact on CASE tool evolution, and the majority of vendors plan to ensure compatibility with AD/ 
Cycle as it becomes available. 


2J CONCLUSIONS 

Conclusions based on the limited scope of the survey and analysis of findings are: 

• Ada compilers are available for PCs, workstations, and mainframes, including the 
mainframe computers most often used for large business ^plications. C++ products are 
available for PCs and some multi-user engineering worirstations but not in general for 
mainframes. 

• There is stability and maturity among Ada compiler vendors with the majority of Ada 
companies providing validated compilers for five or more years. The majority of C++ 
vendors have entered the market during the last two years although many have provided 
C compilers for many years. 


24 




There is considerable variability among C++ products in the language features they 
support, the libraries provided, and strategy for language support The standardization 
effort for C++ and libraries is just beginning. The Ada 9X standard with its object- 
oriented programming support is expected to be adopted by ANSI and ISO by the time 
the C++ standardization effort results in an adopted standard. 

The wide availability of Ada training and education reflects DoD efforts to prcmiote Ada 
as a way to teach software engineering methods. Currently, Ada is being tai^ht and used 
in university computer science departments. Most Ada conq>iler vendors are a source of 
training materials and instruction while C++ training and education is in limited supply. 

CASE tools exist to support both Ada and C++. Structured analysis and structured 
design are the most widely supported development methods but object-oriented design 
and analysis are just entering the picture. CASE tools marketed for business ^plications 
do not contain features such as requirements tracing and simulation and choices among 
design paradigms. Future plans among CASE and compiler vendors call for an 
integration firamework so that tools can be distributed as commercial-off-the-shelf 
products for a variety of platforms.

APPENDIX B 

Ada Compiler Support for Pragma Interface 
(validated under AC VC 1.11) 




This is a survey of validated implementations’ support of pragma INTERFACE. Not all of 
the 160 or so implementations that have been tested under ACVC 1.11 have been analyzed, but all 
of those that are not included below will likely be similar to ones that are (e.g., Vbrdix-based or Tele- 
Soft-based implementations have similar support, generally). All, or nearly all of the implementa¬ 
tions provide a pragma that enables non-Ada identifiers to be specified for the name of the 
interfaced external subprogram or object 


»> BOOl supports INTERFACE for C & FORTRAN. Pragmas INTERFACE_NAME & 
EXTERNAL_NAME are provided, as well as package MACHINE_CODE. NB: All verdix 
& Verdix-based compilers matdi this, with one possible difference in pragma names- 
’TNTERFACE_NAME” vs. “INTERFACE^OBJECT’ (e.g., see entry for BOlO, MIPS, & 
B014, Silicon Graphics, and B028, Convex). 

»> B(X)2 through BOO? match BOOl. 

»> BOOS supports INTERFACE for C & assembler. Pragma EXTERNAL_NAME is also 
provided, to provide the external name for linkage (this differs fi-om other implementations’ 
“Extemal_Name”s, which make Ada objects visible to other routines-vs. giving the name 
of an external object). 

>» B009 supports INTERFACE for “VMS” & assembler. Pragma EXTERNAL_NAME is 

also provided, to provide die external name for linkage (this differs from other 
implementations’ “Extenial_Name”s, which make Ada objects visible to other routines— 
vs. giving the name of an external object). 

»> BOlO supports INTERFACE for C & FORTRAN. Pragmas INTERFACE_OBJECT & 
EXTERNAL_NAME, are provided, as well as package MACHINE_CODE. 

»> BOll matches BOlO. 

»> B012 supports INTERFACE for Assembly, C, UNIX, & FORTRAN. Pragmas 

LINK_NAME & INTERFACE_INFORMATION are provided to oxi^lemait 
INTERFACE. Package MACHINE_CODE is provided. 

»> B013 supports INTERFACE for C & Assembler. Pragma INTERFACE_NAME is 

provided to conqilement INTERFACE. 




»> B014 through B016 match BOIO. 

>» B017 through B026 match BOOl. 

»> B027 supports INTERFACE for assembler, C, & FORTRAN. Pragmas INTER- 

FACE_NAME & EXTERNAL_NAME, and package MACHINE_CODE are provided. 

>» B028 supports INTERFACE for C & FORTRAN. Pragmas INTERFACE_OBJECr, 

INTERFACE_SHARED_OBJECT, & EXTERNAL_NAME are provided, as well as 
package MACHINE_CODE. 

»> B029 matches B028. 

»> B030 supports INTERFACE for “ASM,” presumably an 88K assembly language. Pragmas 
INTERFACE_PACKAGE & EXTERNAL_SUBPROGRAM_NAME are provided. 

>» B031 supports INTERFACE for C & Assembly. Here, INTERFACE is implemented with 

an optional (and non-language-defined!) third parameter, which may be used to specify a 
“link name”. 

>» B032 matches B031. 

»> B033 matches B031. 

»> B034 is like B031, but also interfaces to “microsoft_c” (and “C”). Package 

MACHINE_CODE is provided. 

»> B035 matches B034. 

>» B036 matches B034. 

»> B037 matches B031, but also provides package MACHINE_CODE. 

»> B038 matches B037. 

»> B039 matches BOIO. 

»> B040 and B041 match B(X)9. 

»> B042 supports INTERFACE for Assembler. Ihere are a number of inter- face-related 

pragmas defined by the implementation: EXP0RT_EXCEPT10N, EXPORT_FUNCnON, 
EXPORT_OBJECr, EXPORT_PROCEDlJRE, and corresponding “IMPOFT_” pragmas 
fOT each of the “EXPORT_” ones. Package MACHINE- _CODE is inx)vided. 





»> B043..8 support INTERFACE to various of (the AppJ is general) the languages 

Assembler, C, FORTRAN, or Pascal. Pragmas INTERFACE_NAME, 
EXTERNAL_NAME, & EXPORT are also interface related. 

»> For B044 through B048, see B043. 

»> B049 supports INTERFACE to HP 68K Assembly, C, Pascal, & FORTRAN 77. Pragmas 

INTERFACE_NAME, EXPORT, & EXPORT_NAME are also provided. 

»> B050 supports INTERFACE for “VMS”—which is an “A-code” language that is used by 

the compiler. Pragma INTERFACE_SPELLING is provided. The package 
MACHINE_CODE is provided. 

»> B051 supports INTERFACE for at least “AS,” presumably an assembly language for the 

68K. Pragma INTERFACE_SPELLING is provided. The package MACHINE_CODE is 
provided. 

»> B052 supports INTERFACE for C & Fortran. Pragmas INTERFACE_NAME & 

EXTERNAL_NAME are also provided. Package MACHINE_CODE is provided. (But for 
“I..._NAME” vs. “I..._OBJECr’, this matches B039.) 

»> B053 supports INTERFACE for Fortran, and probably other languages, although this is not 

explicitly stated. I remember a dispute iiom DEC in which the presumed bogus language 
name “ZZZZZ” was accepted: the DEC implementation made some sort of general 
interface when the name wasn’t recognized. There are a number of interface-related 
pragmas defined by the implementation; EXPORT_EXCHPT10N, EXPORT_FUNCnON, 
EXPORT_OBJECr, EXPORT_PROCEDURE, EXPORT_VALUED_PROCEDURE, and 
corresponding “IMPORTJ’ pragmas for each of the “EXPORT_” wies. 

»> B054 matches B053. 

»> B055..9 support INTERFACE for Assembler, Ada, & C (the use of “Ada” isn’t explained 

in App.F). Pragma INTERFACE_NAME is a complement 

»> B056 through B059 match B055. 

»> B060 through B063 likely match B03 l—there was no App.F for these. 


B-5 





»> B064 supports INTERFACE for “occam.” It also provides the pragma 

INTERFACE_NAME. 

»> B065 matches B064. 

»> For B066 through B070, see B043. 

»> B071 supports INTERFACE for “Assembler.” It also provides pragmas 

INTERFACE_NAME, EXTERNAL_NAME, & EXPORT—the latter two enabling Ada. 
objects to be visible to external routines. 

»> B072 matches B071. 

»> B073 does not support INTERFACE, but violates 2.8(8) in providing an implementation- 

defined pragma LIBNAME with a similar function! 

»> B074’s App.F doesn’t explicitly describe INTERFACE, but it implies support for 

“ASM86”"Intel assembly language? There is extensive text the use of MACHINE_CODE. 
B074 offers pragmas INTERFACE_SPELLING & EXTERNAL_NAME. 

>» B075’s App.F doesn’t explicitly describe INTERFACnE, but one can see e.g.s of support for 

“C86”-a version of C. Ihere is extensive text the use of MACHINE_CODE, so one might 
guess that it’s expected that machine-code insertions are used vice interfacing to assembler 
B075 offers pragmas INTERFACE_SPELLING, EXTERNAL_NAME, and 
SHARED_DATA -this last being used to place static package data in a shared data segment 
for use by other programs. 

»> B076’s App.F doesn’t describe its support of INTERFACE; apparently, interface to “AS”- 

-which might be a mnemonic for Sun/68K assembler- is supported (“AS” was macro 
$INTERFACE_LANGUAGE’s value). Package MACHINE_CODE is supported. 

»> B077 through B079 matche B074. 

»> B080 matches B042. 

»> B081 supports INTERFACE for assembler (“ASM”). Complementary (and needed, for 

interface effect!) pragmas IMPORT-FUNCTION, IMPORT_OBJECT, 
IMPORT_PROCEDURE, & corresponding “EXPORT_” ones are also provided. 


B-6 






>» B082 matches B081, but has the additional complementaiy pragma 

IMPORT_VALUED_PROCEDURE (with no corresponding EXPORr_ pragma). 

»> B083 matches B082. 

»> B084 does NOT support INTERFACE (the Rational RIOOO is pure Ada!). 


»> B085 supports INTERFACE for assembler, C, & FORTRAN. Pragma LINKNAME is 

provided. 


»> 

»> 

»> 

»> 


B086 supports INTERFACE for C. Pragma INTERFACE_NAME is provided. 

B087 supports INTERFACE for “MASM”. Pragma INTERFACE_NAME is provided. 
B088 matches B087. 

B089 matches B086. 


»> B090 supports INTERFACE for assembly, C, FORTRAN, & Pascal. Pragmas 

INTERFACE_INFORMATION & LINKNAME are provided. (LINKNAME is provided 
solely for compatibility with other TeleSoft compilers that have it but no pragma 
INTERFACE_INFORMATION.) Package MACHINE_CODE is provided. 

»> B091 supports INTERFACE to "assemblyT’assembler”, & Fortran (the first two 

presumably being synonyms). Pragma INTERFACE_INFORMATION is also provided, 
with parameters Name, Link_name, Mechanism, Parameters, & Clobbered_regs. (It is 
interesting—irksome, to this reviewer—to note that the macro $INTERFACE_LANGUAGE 
has the value "C’: either the value is wrong, or else AppE has omitted one language.) 

>» B092 matches B091. 


»> 

»> 


»> 


»> 


B107 supports INTERFACE for assembler & C. Pragma EXTERNAL_NAME is also 
provided. 

B108 supports INTERFACE for assembly & FORTRAN; INTERFACE is extended 
(beyond Ada!) to use an optional third parameter to designate that a procedure (Ada) is 
interfaced to a function (which might be necessary if the external function has parameters 
that are effectively “out” or “in out” in mode. Pragma EXTERNAL_NAME is also 
provided. 

B109 matches BIOS, with the difference that an additional form of INTERFACE, for 
“FORTRAN_FUNCmON”, is provided (presumably to avoid the reaUy illegal extensicm 
of using a third parameter-but that form is still available). 

BllO matches B107.

Bill supports INTERFACE for Assembler & COBOL. Pragma EXTERNAL_NAME is 
also provided. 

•

B114 supports INTERFACE for Ada, C, FORTRAN, & Pascal. Pragmas INTER- 
FACE_NAME & EXTERNAL_NAME, and package MACHINE_CODE are provided. 

• 

»> 

B115 matches B114. 


»> 

B118 supports INTERFACE to (?)"a general form? It is stated that the interfaced external 
subprogram must conform to the calling conventions of the compiler. Pragma 
LINKAGE_NAME is a complementary pragma. Pragma FOREIGN_BODY is a 
competing-and thus illegal (2.8:8)- pragma. 

# 

»> 

B119 matches B118, with the addition of package MACHINE_CODE. 

• 

»> 

B120 matches B119; there is an indication that Tartan intends to have the <language-name> 
parameter identify the calling mechanism—either of “use-call” or “use-bal” [branch-and- 
link] (but that feature is not yet implemented). 


»> 

B121 through B123 matche B120. 

# 

»> 

B141 supports INTERFACE for assembler & “AIE_assembler”; pragma LINK_NAME is 
provided to interface with non-Ada identifiers. 


»> 

B142 supports INTERFACE for “AIE_assembler” & “unspecified_language” (which 
presumably uses general calling & parameter-passing conventions); pragma LINK_NAME 
is also provided. 

• 

»> 

B143 matches B142. 


»> 

B145 supports INTERFACE for assembly, Ada, C, & Intrinsic. Pragmas EXPORT, 
EXTERNAL_NAME, FOREIGN, & INTERFACE.NAME (INTERFACE_NAME’s

Appendix F - 

Software Design Paradigms 


F-l 





Software engineering currently employs a variety of paradigms in the development of 
software. A “paradigm” is a mechanism that illustrates a concept through the use of an example or 
idea that is commonly understood. These paradigms, which are used throughout the software 
lifecycle, provide a particular perspective of the software process. A couple of issues arise in the 
use of these paradigms. Is there an advantage to using the same paradigm consistently throughout 
the lifecycle? And secondly, is there a paradigm for software development that is superior to the 
others? 

There are three major categories of paradigms we are considering: (1) object-oriented, (2) 
process-oriented, and (3) behavior or state-oriented. The object-oriented paradigm allows the 
software engineer to structure software around the conceptual objects of the system. Objects 
possess attributes and have specific functions associated with them. A process-oriented paradigm 
takes a functional view, highlighting system processes and data flows between those processes. A 
behavior-oriented paradigm provides a view based upon the system states. Objects and processes 
do not have to be explicitly defined in a state-based notation. 

The idea of three complementary views or paradigms has been noted in both the design and 
requirements community. Buhr (Buhr,91) notes the existence of the stmctural, functional, and 
temporal “domains.” These domains correspond to the categories of paradigms, where the structural 
is the object-oriented, the functional is the process-oriented, and the temporal is the behavior- 
oriented. Rumbaugh (Rumbaugh,91) also notes that a system can be viewed with an “object model, 
dynamic model, or functional model.” 

Techniques within the object-oriented paradigm are object-oriented design 
(OOD)(Booch,87) and object-oriented requirements analysis (00A) (Coad,90). Popular techniques 
within the process-oriented paradigm are structured analysis (Yot]rdon,89) and structured design. 
Behavior-oriented techniques include finite state machines, Statecharts (Harel,87) and Petri nets. 

One of the major advantages of using Ada is the ability to design software in an object- 
oriented fashion. This approach allows a software engineer to produce software that hides many of 
the “implementation details.” Given the use of OOD, should we employ an object-oriented 
perspective during requirements? Not entirely. The object-oriented paradigm serves a useful role in 
managing software complexity during the design and implementation stages. However, an object- 
oriented perspective alone is not sufficient to describe requirements adeqtiately. OOA, like its 
counterpart. Structured Analysis, provides the requirements reader a picture of the system objects 
and processes. While this is useful, we still need a way of describing the behaviors required by the 
implemented system. For this, we use a state machine or Petri net. Structured Analysis and OOA 
use some form of a state machine (finite state machine, state-event-response table) for defining the 
timing and behavioral requirements of a system. This use of a state machine is not part of the 
primary notation for either of these techniques but is an augmentation. 


F-3 





In addition, the goals for the different phases are not the same. During design, we want to 
define a structure to our software that hides unnecessary detail, promotes reliability by defining 
interfaces explicitly, and supports modifiability by localizing the possible changes. During 
requirements, we want to ascertain and describe all the desired fimctionality, features, and behaviors 
of a system that are externally visible to the user(s) andJca to other systems. From a pure 
requirements standpoint, we should not know how the system will be implemented (Davis, 90). 

Thus, we should employ a variety paradigms (i.e., perspectives) during the requirements 
definition phase. And the choice of paradigms(s) should be based upon the demands of the system 
itself, not necessarily the intended design and implementation technique.

Systematica Ltd./VSF 


Information From; Chuck Williams (301) 224-3710 

Tool Summary: The Virtual Software Factory (VSF) is a meta-CASE tool. Intended to 

support integration at the information level rather than the tool level. 
Addresses method and design database integration. Providing for 
verifiabiltiy, traceability, and tailorability across the life cycle. Available 
instances: HOOD-SF and SSADM-SF. Other methods implemented by 
Systematica and VSF users include CORE requirement capture method, 
and Mascot3/Ada (British MOD standard for real-time systems 
development). 

Supports meta-modeling constructs such as multiple inheritance across 
hierarchies, multiple design databases, automatic translation between 
methodologies, and specification and enforcement of rules for 
methodologies. Schemas can be described using the VSF formalisms. 
Engineer specifies: (1) required documentation, say 2167, via MWB; (2) 
traceability model between design objects or earlier/later project phases; (3) 
filter mechanism to implement checking rules for static diagnostics, 
underlying formalism is a decidable second-order logic. VSF comes with a 
high-level, internal logic specification language resembling PROLOG, 
supports beliefs, belief generation rules, pre/post-conditions, etc. No 
simulation. Built-in file manager, design databases created by VSF are 
stored in a VSF specific-format. Documents stored/retrieved using a 
hypertext approach. Design fragments can be conserved to another tool 
whose output can then be merged (with conflict checking) back into the 
workbench. Host environment is a shell around VSF, user uses the 
configuration and project management tools available in the host 
environment. Not multi-user. Does merge design information into a central 
database via VSF merge facility.
