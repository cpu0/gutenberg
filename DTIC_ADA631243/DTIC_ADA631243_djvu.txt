Engineering Decision: Transport Layer Protocol 


Transport layer protocol defines interfaces available to applications that 
allow end-to-end communications; TCP is the most familiar 

• TCP provides reliable transmission - data guaranteed to reach destination 
in correct order and without duplication. 

• TCP is suited for situations with reliable transmission (solid network 
infrastructure) 

• Not suited to situations where packet loss, mis-ordering, or garbling are 
more common 

We selected UDP as the preferred protocol for: 

• better for time-sensitive applications 

• but UDP does not provide error correction

Engineering Decision: Message Protocol 


SOA uses two common messaging protocols 

• Traditional WS-* based web services employing SOAP messages 

• Representational State Transfer (REST) web services using URI’s, and 
HTTP operations 

REST is simpler and increasingly more common 

• Better support on the Android platform 

• Close tie to HTTP and therefore TCP meant we could not use it 

We selected SOAP also hoping to take advantage of well-defined 

specifications, open source implementations, and support for security.

Engineering Decision: SOAP Engine 


SOAP is a platform/language independent XML-based protocol for encoding 
messages 

• Variety of open source SOAP engines that serialize in-memory data structures 
to XML messages and vice versa 

• Machines at the other end of the wire perform inverse operation 

SOAP engines selected 

• gSOAP on the CoT router-side supports SOAP over UDP and C++ development 

• We modified kSOAP on the Android side to support UDP, but problems remain 

— We had to manually develop code to marshal/unmarshal Java objects to 
SOAP messages 

— kSOAP for Android omits important features (XML attributes, limited parsing, 
WS-Addressing) 

Reduced bandwidth on GPRS networks later necessitated a change to a 
binary format

Engineering Decision: Security 


Typical strategy for web services over the internet is 

• Network level security (encryption) based on IPsec 

• Transport level security built on transport mechanisms such as HTTP 

• Application level security strategies such as WS-Security 

We considered WS-Security, but rejected it due to lack of kSOAP support 

Our approach 

• Network level security: existing internet and wireless protocol WPA/WPA2 with 
pre-shared key (PSK) 

• Transport level security: Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) was 
immature when we evaluated it 

• Application level security: AES-256 bit encryption with WPA2 passphrase 
generation 

Not perfect, but this solution provides a reasonable level of security

Test 1 - HTTP/TCP MJPEG Video Viewer App 




• Trendnet wireless IP Camera and Nexus One 
smartphone are connected to RTSS wireless 
network 

• The smartphone receives video in Motion 
JPEG (MJPEG) format over a wireless 
HTTP/TCP connection

Test 2 - UDP MJPEG Video Viewer App 




• Trendnet wireless IP Camera is connected to a 
Windows machine running a TCP to UDP MJPEG 
converter (C++) through a wired Ethernet network 

• The TCP to UDP converter gets MJPEG image 
data over TCP and retransmits that same data 
using UDP to the RTSS Lab wireless network. 

• The Android smartphone is connected to the RTSS 
lab wireless network and can receive these 
MJPEG frames over UDP and display it using an 
Android application

Fixed Station - Tactical 
Operation Center {TOC) 



• Assets (UAVs, cars) track a hostile vehicle 
and post CoT messages (video, location etc) 
to the CoT SOAP Server 

• CoT SOAP Server consume raw CoT 
messages and provides CoT data as SOAP- 
over-UDP web service 

• Android phone consume SOAP messages, 
processes and displays them

“Warfighers” disguised as civilian tourists have 
Android phones that are connected to a Wi-Fi 
access point (connected to a wave relay via 
ethernet) on a mobile station (car) 

Phones consume CoT Messages from other 
assets (UAV)

Prototype 3 - CoT SOAP UDP App V2 (Camp Roberts August 2010 
TNT) - Two-way Video over VPN 



IP camera and Android phones (inside the TOC, 
Camp Roberts) capture video frames and convert 
them into SOAP-over-UDP CoT messages. 

These SOAP messages are sent to both local 
service consumers (other phones and CoT 
display) as well as remote service consumers 
(phones inside the RTSS lab network, Pittsburgh) 
Remote Phones (inside the RTSS lab) can also 
broadcast live video feeds as SOAP-over-UDP 
CoT messages to the TOC in Camp Roberts via 
the RTSS Lab VPN connection

Prototype 4 - CoT UDP, Binary Protocol, GPRS (Camp Roberts 
October 2010 TNT) 


Assets & 
Sensors 



Smartphone 
(Android 2 2 ) 


CoT data including imagery 
sent to and from Android 
phones are transmitted via an 
LBS Tactical Base Station 
using GPRS 

Due to reduced bandwidth, 
real-time video was not 
attempted, only still imagery 
(snapshots) were sent. 
Performance with still images 
was quite good (approximately 
30-40 kbits/sec) 


F Software Engineering Institute Carnegie Mellon 




















Summary of Observations 


Security overhead 

• 256 bit AES encryption and decryption at line speed 

• Accelerated by use of “native” code 

• Significantly less as compared to interoperability overhead (SOAP/XML 
serialization de-serialization overhead) 

Variation in processing time (especially for Java only function such as 
parsing) is due to 

• JVM automatic garbage collection 

• Variation in message size for video frames 

• Potential problem with kSOAP implementation

IRAD Results - Technical , 


A subset of SOA is practical in tactical environments where bandwidth is high 

• Performance of video feeds (using SOAP-based CoT format) is comparable 
(visually) with the video feed on a standard desktop machine for a threshold of 
video feeds 

To make SOA practical in these situations, we had to make some non-typical 
SOA choices 

• UDP rather than customary TCP to improve video performance 

• SOAP vs. REST based web services 

— Currently, REST is built on HTTP/TCP, but there has been some work on 
REST-UDP 

• Use of WS-Security is not easy since implementations are lacking 

Moved to binary formats in situations with low bandwidth

IRAD Results - Technical 2 


Smartphone (Nexus One) far exceeded our expectations 

• Roughly as powerful as a circa 2000 desktop 

• Sophisticated software development platform 

• Phones with dual core processors are now being developed and released 
Our current solution does not address 

• Architectural changes to the way CoT data is distributed (that may be need to improve 
performance) 

— Video frame size (with UDP) 

— UDP is not reliable - not a problem of real-time video but is a problem for text 

— Current phone hardware can be overwhelmed by too many video feeds 

— Not clear if the parsing overhead can be fixed using a better implementation or 
modifying the existing parser on the phone 

• Non-software issues in the field - screen visibility in bright light, radio interference

IRAD Results - Non-technical 



May 2010 TNT (Camp Roberts) 

• Good feedback from Special Forces personnel 

• Requested for more features 

August 2010 TNT (Camp Roberts) 

• General feeling that we were ahead of others in our development of smartphone 
capabilities for situational awareness 

• By November 2010, we were leapfrogged 

• Other consumers of CoT data using our CoT web service 

October/November 2010 


• Worked with NPS, Naval Special Warfare (NSW) experts to make technology 
available on proprietary GPRS network 

• GPRS sufficient for single images but not for video

Lessons Learned - Mobile Computing 


W 


Android is good and open development platform 
However, the platform is still evolving 

• Performance improvements with new OS versions 

• User interface needs to be more responsive 

• Lack for hardware-base support for security, but this changing all the time 

Architecture must take into account constraints of mobile devices 

• The CoT architecture mayneed to be adapted to support constrained 
devices 

— For example, “on demand” video feeds can reduce bandwidth usage as 
well as unwanted processing on the phone 


Software Engineering Institute Carnegie Mellon 


Joe Seibel :SATURN 2011

23 




Lessons Learned - SOA on Smartphones 


Immaturity of SOAP implementations 

• kSOAP 

— Lack of support of generated code from WSDL 
— Many key XML features missing or are not directly supported 
— No support for UDP transport, security and other WS standards 

• gSOAP 

— Poor architecture for supporting applications that need low-level networking 
control 

— Problems with UDP support 

Reduction in Development time 

• Using SOAP can reduce development time by reusing services only if mature 
implementations are available for the target platform(s) 

• Using SOAP can result in unacceptable performance for some class of 
applications
