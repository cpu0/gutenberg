CHAPTER 1 



INTRODUCTION 


This Validation Summary Report -(VSR^ describes the extent to which a 
specific Ada compiler conforms to the Ada Standard, ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A. 
This report explains all technical terms used within it and thoroughly 
reports the results of-—testing this compiler using the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability, (ACVG>*\ An Ada compiler must be implemented 
according to the Ada Standard, and any implementation-dependent features 
must conform to the requirements of the Ada Standard. The Ada Standard 
must be implemented in its entirety, and nothing can be implemented that is 
not in the Standard."', 


Even thoughall validated Ada compilers conform to the Ada Standard, it 
must be understood that some differences do exist between implementations. 
The Ada Standard permits some implementation dependencies—for example, the 
maximum length of identifiers or the maximum values of integer types. 
Other differences between compilers result from the characteristics of 
particular operating systems, hardware, or implementation strategies. All 
the dependencies observed during the process of testing this compiler are 
given in this report. ^ 

The information in this report is derived from the test results produced 
during validation testing. The validation process includes submitting a 
suite of standardized tests, the ACVC, as inputs to an Ada compiler and 
evaluating the results.N The purpose of validating is to ensure conformity 
of the compiler to the ^da Standard by testing that the compiler properly 
implements legal language constructs and that it identifies and rejects 
illegal language constructs. The testing also identifies behavior that is 
implementation-dependent blit is permitted by the Ada Standard. Six classes 
of tests are used. These\ tests are designed to perform checks at compile 
time, at link time, and during execution.

INTRODUCTION 


1.1 PURPOSE OF THIS VALIDATION SUMMARY REPORT 

This VSR documents the results of the validation testing performed on an 
Ada compiler. Testing vas carried out for the following purposes: 


. To attempt to identify any language constructs supported by the 
compiler that do not conform to the Ada Standard 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs not supported by 
the compiler but required by the Ada Standard 

. To determine that the implementation-dependent behavior is allowed 
by the Ada Standard 

Testing of this compiler was conducted by SofTech, Inc. under the 
direction of the AVF according to procedures established by the Ada Joint 
Program Office and administered by the Ada Validation Organization (AVO). 
On-site testing was completed 13 February 1990 at Torrance CA.

INTRODUCTION 


An ACVC test for which the compiler generates a result that 
demonstrates nonconformity to the Ada Standard. 

The computer on which the compiler resides. 

An ACVC test that uses features of the language that a 
compiler is not required to support or may legitimately 
support in a way other than the one expected by the test. 

An ACVC test for which a compiler generates the expected 
result. 

The computer for which a compiler generates code. 

A program that checks a compiler's conformity regarding a 
particular feature or a combination of features to the Ada 
Standard. In the context of this report, the term is used to 
designate a single test, which may comprise one or more 
files. 

An ACVC test found to be incorrect and not used to check 
conformity to the Ada Standard. A test may be incorrect 
because it has an Invalid test objective, fails to meet its 
test objective, or contains illegal or erroneous use of the 
language. 


1.5 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conformity to the Ada Standard is measured using the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains both legal and illegal Ada programs structured into six test 
classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies 
the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable, 
and special program units are used to report their results during 
execution. Class B tests are expected to produce compilation errors. 
Class L tests are expected to produce compilation or link errors because of 
the way in which a program library is used at link time. 

Class A tests ensure the successful compilation of legal Ada programs with 
certain language constructs which cannot be verified at compile time. 
There are no explicit program components in a Class A test to check 
semantics. For example, a Class A test checks that reserved words of 
another language (other than those already reserved in the Ada language) 
are not treated as reserved words by an Ada compiler. A Class A test is 
passed if no errors are detected at compile time and the program executes 
to produce a PASSED message. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that every syntax or 
semantic error in the test is detected. A Class B test is passed if every 
illegal construct that it contains is detected by the compiler.

INTRODUCTION 


Class C tests check the run time system to ensure that legal Ada programs 
can be correctly compiled and executed. Each Class C test is self-checking 
and produces a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result when it is executed. 


Class D tests check the compilation and execution capacities of a compiler. 
Since there are no capacity requirements placed on a compiler by the Ada 
Standard for some parameters—for example, the number of identifiers 
permitted in a compilation or the number of units in a library—a compiler 
may refuse to compile a Class D test and still be a conforming compiler. 
Therefore, if a Class D test fails to compile because the capacity of the 
compiler is exceeded, the test is classified as inapplicable. If a Class D 
test compiles successfully, it is self-checking and produces a PASSED or 
FAILED message during execution. 


Class E tests are expected to execute successfully and check 
implementation-dependent options and resolutions of ambiguities in the Ada 
Standard. Each Class E test is self-checking and produces a NOT 
APPLICABLE, PASSED, or FAILED message when it is compiled and executed. 
Hovever, the Ada Standard permits an implementation to reject programs 
containing some features addressed by Class E tests during compilation. 
Therefore, a Class E test is passed by a compiler if it is compiled 
successfully and executes to produce a PASSED message, or if it is rejected 
by the compiler for an allowable reason. 


Class L tests check that incomplete or illegal Ada programs involving 
multiple, separately compiled units are detected and not allowed to 
execute. Class L tests are compiled separately and execution is attempted. 
A Class L test passes if it is rejected at link time—that is, an attempt 
to execute the main program must generate an error message before any 
declarations in the main program or any units referenced by the main 
program are elaborated. In some cases, an implementation may legitimately 
detect errors during compilation of the test. 


Two library units, the package REPORT and the procedure CHECK_FILE, support 
the self-checking features of the executable tests. The package REPORT 
provides the mechanism by which executable tests report PASSED, FAILED, or 
NOT APPLICABLE results. It also provides a set of identity functions used 
to defeat some compiler optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that 
would circumvent a test objective. The procedure CHECK FILE is used to 
check the contents of text files written by some of the Class C tests for 
chapter 14 of the Ada Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. These tests produce messages that 
are examined to verify that the units are operating correctly. If these 
units are not operating correctly, then the validation is not attempted. 


The text of each test in the ACVC follows conventions that are intended to 
ensure that the tests are reasonably portable without modification. For 
example, the tests make use of only the basic set of 55 characters, contain 
lines with a maximum length of 72 characters, use small numeric values, and 
place features that may not be supported by all implementations in separate 
tests. However, some tests contain values that require the test to be

INTRODUCTION 


customized according to implementation-specific values—for example, an 
illegal file name. A list of the values used for this validation is 
provided in Appendix C. 

A compiler must correctly process each of the tests in the suite and 
demonstrate conformity to the Ada Standard by either meeting the pass 
criteria given for the test or by showing that the test is inapplicable to 
the implementation. The applicability of a test to an implementation is 
considered each time the implementation is validated. A test that is 
inapplicable for one validation is not necessarily inapplicable for a 
subsequent validation. Any test that was determined to contain an illegal 
language construct or an erroneous language construct is withdrawn from the 
ACVC and, therefore, is not used in testing a compiler. The tests 
withdrawn at the time of this validation are given in Appendix D.

2-1 




CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


2.2 IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS 

One of the purposes of validating compilers is to determine the behavior of 
a compiler in those areas of the Ada Standard that permit implementations 
to differ. Class D and E tests specifically check for such implementation 
differences. However, tests in other classes also characterize an 
implementation. The tests demonstrate the following characteristics: 


a. Capacities. 


(1) The compiler correctly processes a compilation containing 723 
variables in the same declarative part. (See test D29002K.) 

(2) The compiler correctly processes tests containing loop 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See tests D55A03A..H (8 
tests).) 

(3) The compiler correctly processes tesfs containing block 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See test D56001B.) 

(4) The compiler correctly processes tests containing recursive 
procedures separately compiled as subunits nested to six 
levels. (See tests D64005E..G (3 tests).) 


b. Predefined types. 

(1) This implementation supports the additional predefined types 
LONG INTEGER and L0NG_FL0AT in package STANDARD. (See tests 
B860&LT..Z (7 tests).) 


c. Expression evaluation. 

The order in which expressions are evaluated and the time at which 
constraints are checked are not defined by the language. While 
the ACVC tests do not specifically attempt to determine the order 
of evaluation of expressions, test results indicate the following: 

(1) Some of the default initialization expressions for record 
components are evaluated before any value is checked for 
membership in a component's subtype. (See test C32117A.) 

(2> Assignments for subtypes are performed with less precision 
than the base type. (See test C35712B.) 


2-2 





CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(3) This implementation uses no extra bits for extra precision and 
uses all extra bits for extra range. (See test C35903A.) 

(4) Sometimes NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when an integer literal 
operand in a comparison or membership test is outside the 
range of the base type. (See test C45232A.) 

(5) No exception is raised when a literal operand in a fixed-point 
comparison or membership test is outside the range of the base 
type. (See test C45252A.) 

(6) Underflow is gradual. (See tests C45524A..Z (26 tests).) 


d. Rounding. 

The method by which values are rounded in type conversions is not 
defined by the language. While the ACVC tests do not specifically 
attempt to determine the method of rounding, the test results 
indicate the following: 

(1) The method used for rounding to integer is round away from 
zero. (See tests C46012A..Z (26 tests).) 

(2) The method used for rounding to longest integer is round away 
from zero. (See tests C46012A..Z (26 tests).) 

(3) The method used for rounding to integer in static universal 
real expressions is round away from zero. (See test C4A014A.) 


e. Array types. 

An implementation is alloved to raise NUMERIC_ERROR or 

CONSTRAINT_ERROR for an array having a 'LENGTH that exceeds 

STANDARD.INTEGER'LAST and/or SYSTEM.MAX_INT. 

For this implementation: 

(1) Declaration of an array type or subtype declaration with more 
than SYSTEM.MAX INT components raises NUMERIC_ERROR sometimes. 
(See test C36003A.) 

(2) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised when 'LENGTH is applied to an array 

type with INTEGER'LAST + 2 components with each component 

being a null array. (See test C36202A.) 

(3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised when 'LENGTH is applied to an array 
type with” SYSTEM.MAX_INT + 2 components with each component 
being a null array. (See test C36202B.) 


2-3 






CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(4) A packed BOOLEAN array having a 'LENGTH exceeding INTEGER'LAST 
raises CONSTRAINT_ERR0R when the array objects are declared. 
(See test C52103X.) 

(5) A packed two-dimensional BOOLEAN array with more than 
INTEGER'LAST components raises CONSTRAINT_ERROR when the array 
objects are declared. (See test CS2104Y.) 

(6) A null array with one dimension of length greater than 
INTEGER'LAST may raise NUMERIC_ERROR or CONSTRAINT_ERROR 
either when declared or assigned. Alternatively, an 
implementation may accept the declaration. However, lengths 
must match in array slice assignments. This implementation 
raises no exception. (See test E52103Y.) 

(7) In assigning one-dimensional array types, the expression is 
evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

(8) In assigning two-dimensional array types, the expression is 
evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


£. Discriminated types. 

(1) In assigning record types with discriminants, the expression 
is evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


g. Aggregates. 

(1) In the evaluation of a multi-dimensional aggregate, index 
subtype checks are made as choices are evaluated. (See tests 
C43207A and C43207B.) 

(2) In the evaluation of an aggregate containing subaggregates, 
not all choices are evaluated before being checked for 
identical bounds. (See test E43212B.) 

(3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised before all choices are evaluated 
when a bound in a non-null range of a non-null aggregate does 
not belong to an index subtype. (See test E43211B.) 


2-4 






CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


h. Pragmas• 

(1) The pragma INLINE is not supported for functions or 
procedures. (See tests LA3004A..B (2 tests), EA3004C..D (2 
tests), and CA3004E..F (2 tests).) 


i. Generics. 

(1) Generic specifications and bodies can be compiled in separate 
compilations. (See tests CA1012A, CA2009C, CA2009F, BC3204C, 
and BC3205D.) 

(2) Generic unit bodies and their subunits can be compiled in 
separate compilations. (See test CA3011A.) 


j. Input and output. 

(1) The package SEQUENTIAL_IO can be instantiated with 
unconstrained array types~and record types with discriminants 
without defaults. (See tests AE2101C, EE2201D, and EE2201E.) 

(2) The package DIRECT_I0 can be instantiated with unconstrained 
array types and record types with discriminants without 
defaults. (See tests AE2101H, EE2401D,and EE2401G.) 


(3) The Director, AJPO, has determined (AI-00332) that every call 
to OPEN and CREATE must raise USE_ERROR or NAME_ERR0R if file 
input/output is not supported. This implementation exhibits 
this behavior for SEQUENTIAL_IO, DIRECT_IO, and TEXT__IO. 


2-5 











CHAPTER 3 


TEST INFORMATION 


3.1 TEST RESULTS 

Version 1.10 o£ Che ACVC comprises 3717 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, 44 tests had been withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF 
determined that 799 tests were inapplicable to this implementation. All 
inapplicable tests were processed during validation testing except for 285 
executable tests that use floating-point precision exceeding that supported 
by the implementation and 242 executable tests that use file operations not 
supported by the implementation. Modifications to the code, processing, or 
grading for 8 tests were required to successfully demonstrate the test 
objective. 

The AVF concludes that the testing results demonstrate acceptable 
conformity to the Ada Standard.

3.5 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

Some tests do not apply to all compilers because they make use of features 
that a compiler is not required by the Ada Standard to support. Others may 
depend on the result of another test that is either inapplicable or 
withdrawn. The applicability of a test to an implementation is considered 
each time a validation is attempted. A test that is inapplicable for one 
validation attempt is not necessarily inapplicable for a subsequent 
attempt. For this validation attempt, 799 tests were inapplicable for the 
reasons indicated: 


a. The following 285 tests are not 
floating-point type declarations 
SYSTEM.MAX DIGITS: 


applicable because they have 
requiring more digits than 


C24113F..Y (20 tests) 
C35706F..Y (20 tests) 
C35708F..Y (20 tests)

implementation does not support any predefined integer type with a 
name other than INTEGER, L0NG_INTEGER, or SH0RT_INTEGER. 

f. C45531M..P (4 tests) and C45532M..P (4 tests) are not applicable 

because the value of SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA is less than 48. 

g. D64005F and D64005G are not applicable because this implementation 
does not support nesting 10 levels of recursive procedure calls. 

h. C86001F is not applicable because, for this implementation, the 
package TEXT_I0 is dependent upon package SYSTEM. This test 
recompiles pickage SYSTEM, making package TEXT_I0, and hence 
package REPORT, obsolete. 

i. B86001Y is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined fixed-point type other than DURATION.

o. The tests CE2103A, CE2103B, and CE3107A do not allow the 
implementation to raise USE_ERROR for external file CREATE and 
OPEN operations when these operations are not supported by the 
implementation. An unhandled USE_ERROR exception was raised by 
these tests. 


3.6 TEST, PROCESSING, AND EVALUATION MODIFICATIONS 

It is expected that some tests will require modifications of code, 
processing, or evaluation in order to compensate for legitimate 
implementation behavior. Modifications are made by the AVF in cases where 
legitimate implementation behavior prevents the successful completion of an 
(otherwise) applicable test. Examples of such modifications include: 
adding a length clause to alter the default size of a collection; splitting 
a Class B test into subtests so that all errors are detected; and 
confirming that messages produced by an executable test demonstrate 
conforming behavior that wasn't anticipated by the test (such as raising 
one exception instead of another). 

Modifications were required for 8 tests. 


3-5 







TEST INFORMATION 


The following tests were split because syntax errors at one point resulted 
in the compiler not detecting other errors in the test: 

B24009A B44004D B49003A B49005A B49009C B59001E 


Test AD7006A was modified because the Type SYSTEM.MEMORY_SIZE needed to be 
explicitly converted to type INTEGER. The modification was made so that 
line 23 was changed to: 

I :- INTEGER (SYSTEM.MEMORY SIZE - MYMSIZE +1); 


At the recommendation of the AVO, the expression "2**T'MANTISSA - 1" on 
line 262 of test CC1223A was changed to "(2**(T'MANTISSA-1)-1 + 
2**(T'MANTISSA-1))" since the previous expression causes an unexpected 
exception to be raised. 


3.7 ADDITIONAL TESTING INFORMATION 


3.7.1 Prevalidation 

Prior to validation, a set of test results for ACVC Version 1.10 produced 
by the TLD VAX/MIL-STD-1750A Ada Compiler System, Version 1.4.0 compiler 
was submitted to the AVF by the applicant for review. Analysis of these 
results demonstrated that the compiler successfully passed all applicable 
tests, and the compiler exhibited the expected behavior on all inapplicable 
tests. 


3.7.2 Test Method 


Testing of the TLD VAX/MIL-STD-1750A Ada Compiler System, Version 1.4.0 
compiler using ACVC Version 1.10 was conducted on-site by a validation team 
from the AVF. The configuration in which the testing was performed is 
described by the following designations of hardware and software 
components:

TEST INFORMATION 


The host and target computers were linked via Ethernet - 802. 

A magnetic tape containing all tests except for withdrawn tests and tests 
requiring unsupported floating-point precisions was taken on-site by the 
validation team for processing. Tests that make use of 
implementation-specific values were customized before being written to the 
magnetic tape. Tests requiring modifications during the prevalidation 
testing were included in their modified form on the magnetic tape. 

The contents of the magnetic tape were loaded directly onto the host 
computer. 

After the test files were loaded to disk, the full set of tests was 
compiled and linked on the MicroVAX II; then all executable images were 
transferred to the Tektronix 8540/PACE MIL-STD-1750A Emulator via Ethernet 
- 802 and run. Results were printed from the host computer. 

The compiler was tested using command scripts provided by TLD Systems, Ltd. 
and reviewed by the validation team. The compiler was tested using the 
following option settings: 


No_Exception Info Suppress generation of Debug string's 

in relocatable object code for unhandled 
exception 

No_Phase Suppress displaying of phase times during 

compilation 


Tests were compiled, linked, and executed (as appropriate) using a single 
host and target computer. Test output, compilation listings, and job logs 
were captured on magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings 
examined on-site by the validation team were also archived. 


3.7.3 Test Site 

Testing was conducted at Torrance CA and was completed on 13 February 1990.

APPENDIX B 

APPENDIX P OF THE Ada STANDARD 


The only allowed implementation dependencies correspond to 
implementation-dependent pragmas, to certain machine-dependent conventions 
as mentioned in Chapter 13 of the Ada Standard, and to certain allowed 
restrictions on representation clauses. The implementation-dependent 
characteristics of the TLD VAX/MIL-STD-1750A Ada Compiler System, Version 
1.4.0 compiler, as described in this Appendix, are provided by TLD Systems, 
Ltd. Unless specifically noted otherwise, references in this Appendix are 
to compiler documentation and not to this report. Implementation-specific 
portions of the package STANDARD, which are not a part of Appendix F, are: 


package STANDARD is 


type INTEGER is range -32768 .. 32767; 

type L0NG_INTEGER is range -2147483648 .. 2147483647; 

type FLOAT is digits 6 range -1.0*2.0**127 .. 0.999999*2.0**127; 

type L0NG_FL0AT is digits 9 range -1.0*2.0**127 .. 0.999999999*2.0**127; 

type DURATION is delta 2.0**(-14) range -86400.0 .. 86400.0; 


end STANDARD; 







The Ada language definicion allows for certain machine_dependencies in a 
controlled manner. No machine -dependent syntax or semantic extensions or 
restrictions are allowed. The only allowed implementation-dependencies 
correspond to implementaton-dependent pragmas and attributes, certain 
machine-dependent conventions as mentioned in chapter 13, and certain allowed 
restrictions on representation clauses. 

The full definition of the implementation-dependent characteristics of the 
TLD VAX/MIL-STD-1750A Ada Compiler System is presented in this Appendix F. 

Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 

The TLD ACS supports the following implementation dependent pragmas. 


Pragma Collect (type_name, attribute); 

This pragma tells the compiler to collect all objects of specified type_name 
and subtypes of type_name into unmapped control sections. An "unmapped 
control section” is allocated a physical memory location not covered by a 
page register. Unmapped control sections are accessed from a device by DMA 
or by IBM GVSC extended instructions. 


Pragma Control_Section (USECT,UNMAPPED,object_name(,object_name...)) ; 

This pragma specifies data objects that will be put into unmapped control 
sections. The first two parameters must be USECT and UNMAPPED and the 
remaining parameters are the names of Ada objects. An "unmapped control 
section" is allocated a physical memory location not covered by a page 
register. Unmapped control sections are accessed from a device by DMA or by 
IBM GVSC extended instructions. 


Pragma Export (Language_name, Ada_entity_name, (String)); 

This pragma is a complement to Pragma Interface and instructs the compiler to 
make the entity named available for reference by a foreign language module. 
The language name identifies the language in which the foreign module is 
coded. The only foreign language presently supported is Assembly. Ada and 
JOVIAL are permitted and presently mean the same as Assembly but the 
semantics of their use are subject to redefinition by future releases of the 
compiler. If the optional third parameter is present, the string provides 
the name by which the entity may be referenced by the foreign module. The 
contents of this string must conform to the conventions for the indicated 
foreign language and the linker being used. No check is made by the compiler 
to insure that these conventions are obeyed. 

Only objects having static allocation and subprograms are supported by pragma 
Export. If the Ada entity named is a subprogram, this pragma must be placed 


B-2 







within the declarative region of the named subprogram. If the name is that 
of an object, the pragma must be placed within the same declarative region 
and following the object declaration. It is the responsibility of the 
programmer to insure that the subprogram and object are elaborated before the 
reference is made. 


pragma If (Compile_Time_Expression); 
pragma Elsif (Compile_Time_Expression); 
pragma Else; 
pragma Endif; 

These source directives may be used to enclose conditionally compiled source 
to enhance program portability and configuration adaptation. These 
directives may occur at tha place that language defined pragmas, statements, 
or declarations may occur. Source code following these pragmas will be 
compiled or ignored similar to the semantics of the corresponding Ada 
statements depending upon whether the Compile_Time_Expression is true or 
false, respectively. The primary difference between these pragmas and the 
corresponding Ada statements are that the pragmas may enclose declarations 
and other pragmas. 


Pragma Interrupt_Kind (Entry_Name, Entry_Type{, Duration)); 

This pragma must appear in the task specification and must appear after the 
Entry_Name is declared. Allowed Entry_Types are Ordinary, Timed, and 
Conditional. The optional parameter Duration is applicable only to timed 
entries and is the time to wait for an accept. 

For an Ordinary entry, if the accept is not ready, the task is queued. 

For a Timed entry, if the accept is not ready, the program waits for the 
period of time specified by the Duration. If the accept does not become 
ready in that period, the interrupt is ignored. 

For a Conditional entry, if the accept is not ready, the interrupt is 
ignored. 


Pragma Monitor; 

Pragma Monitor can eliminate tasking context overhead. The pragma identifies 
Ada tasks that obey certain restrictions (listed below), allowing efficient 
invocaton by the compiler. With Pragma Monitor, a simple procedure call is 
used to invoke task entry. 

The pragma only applies to tasks that have the following restrictions: 
o Monitor tasks must only be declared in library level non-generic packages. 


B-3 





o Monitor tasks may contain data declarations only within the accept 
statement. 

o A monitor task consists of an infinite loop containing one select 
statement. 

o The "when condition" is not allowed in the select alternative of the 
select statement. 

o The only selective wait alternative allowed in the select statement is the 
accept alternative. 

o All executable statements of a monitor task must occur within an accept 
statement. 

o Only one accept statement is allowed for each entry declared in the task 
specification. 

If a task body violates restrictions placed on monitor tasks, it is 

identified as erroneous and the compilation fails. 


pragma No_Default_Initialization; 

pragma No_Defaul^Initialization (typename, {,typename ...}); 

The LRM requires initialization of certain data structures even though no 
explicit initialization is coded. For example, the LRM requires access_type 
objects to have an initial value of "NULL." The No_Default_Initialization 
pragma would prevent this default initialization. 

In addition, initialization declared in a type statement is suppressed by 
this pragma. 

The TLD implementation of packed records or records with representation 
clauses includes default initialization of filler bits, i.e., bits within the 
allocated size of a variant that are not associated with a record component 
for the variant. No_Default_Initialization prevents this default 
initialization. 

No_Default_Initialization must be placed in the declaration region of the 
package, before any declarations that require elaboration code. The pragma 
remains in effect until the end of the compilation unit. 


Pragma No_Elaboration; 

Pragma No_Elaboration is used to prevent the generation of elaboration code 
for the containing scope. The pragma must be placed in the declaration 
region of the affected scope before any declaration that would otherwise 


B—4 








produce elaboration code. 


Pragma No_Elaboration prevents otherwise unnecessary initialization of 
packages that are initialized by ocher non-Ada operations. Examples are ROM 
data and Real Time Kernel initialization. It is used to maintain the TLD Run 
Time Library (TLDrcl) and is not intended for general use. 


Implementation-Dependent Attributes 
None. 


Representation Clause Restrictions 
Pragma Pack is not supported. 

Length clauses are not supported for 'SIZE except when applied to task 
types. 

Length clauses are not supported for 'Storage_Size when applied to access 
types. 

Length clauses are supported for ’Storage_Size when applied to a cask type 
and denote the number of words of stack to be allocated to the cask. 

Length clauses are not supported for 'Small. 

Enumeration representation clauses are supported for value ranges of 
Integer'First to Integer'Lasc. 

Record representation clauses are supported to arrange record components 
within a record. Record components may not be specified to cross a word 
boundary unless they are arranged to encompass two or more whole words. A 
record component of type record chat has itself been "rep specificationed" 
may only be allocated at bit 0. Bits are numbered from left to right with 
bit 0 indicating the sign bit. 

The alignment clause is not supported. 

Address clauses are supported for variable objects and designate the virtual 
address of the object. The TLD Ada Compiler System treats the address 
specification as a means to access objects allocated by ocher chan Ada means 
and accordingly does not treat the clause as a request to allocate the object 
at the indicated address. 

Address clauses are not supported for constant objects, packages, casks, or 
cask entries. 


B-5 









Implementation-Generated Names 


The TLD Ada Compiler System defines no implementation dependent names for 
compiler generated components. 


Address Clause Expressions 

Address expression values and type Address represent a location in logical 
memory (in the program's current address state). For objects, the address 
specifies a location within the 64K word logical operand space. The 'Address 
attribute applied to a subprogram represents a 16 bit word address within the 
logical instruction space. 


Unchecked Conversion Restrictions 
None 


I/O Package Characteristics 

The following implementation-defined types are declared in Text_Io. 
subtype Count is integer range 0 .. 511; 
subtype Field is Integer range 0 .. 127; 


Package Standard 

The implementation-defined types of package Standard are: 

type Integer is range -32_768 .. 32_767; 

type Lon g Integer is range -2_147_483_648 .. 2_147_483_647; 

type Float is digits 6 range -1.0*2.0**127 .. 0.999999*2.0**127; 

type Long_Float is digits 9 range -1.0*2.0**127 .. 0.999999999*2.0**127; 

type Duration is delta 2.0**(-14) range -86_400.0..86_400.0;

Ocher System Dependencies 
LRM Chapter 1. 

None. 

LRM Chapter 2. 

Maximum source line length -- 120 characters. 

Source line terminator -- Determined by the Editor used. 

Maximum name length -- 120 characters. 

External representation of name characters. 

Maximum String literal -- 120 characters. 

LRM Chapter 3. 

LRM defined pragmas are recognized and processed as follows: 

Controlled -- Has no effect. 

Elaborate -- As described in the LRM. 

Inline -- Not presently supported. 

Interface -- Supported as a means of importing foreign language 
components into the Ada Program Library. May be applied either to a 
subprogram declaration as being specially implemented, -- read Interface 
as Import --, or to an object that has been declared elsewhere. 
Interface languages supported are System for producing a call obeying 
the standard calling conventions except that the BEX instruction is used 
to cause a software interrupt into the kernel supervisor mode; Assembly 
for calling assembly language routines; and Mil-Std-1750A for defining 
built in instruction procedures. An optional third parameter is used to 
define a name other than the name of the Ada subprogram for interfacing 
with the linker. 

List --As defined in the LRM. 

Memory Size -- Has no effect. 

Optimize -- Has no effect. Optimization controlled by compiler command 
option. 

Pack -- Has no effect. 

Page --As defined in the LRM. 


B-7 







Priority --As defined in the LRM. Priority may range from 0 to 16366. 
Default priority is 1. 

Shared --As defined in the LRM. May be applied to scalar objects only. 
Storage Unit -- Has no effect. 

Suppress -- As defined in the LRM for suppressing checks; all standard 
checks may be suppressed individually as well as "Exception_Info" and 
"All_Checks". Suppression of Exception_Info eliminates data used to 
provide symbolic debug information in the event of an unhandled 
exception. The All_Checks selection eliminates all checks with a single 
pragma. In addition to the pragma, the compiler permits control of 
check suppression by command line option without the necessity of source 
changes. 

System Name -- Has no effect. 

Number declarations are not assigned addresses and their names are not 
permitted as a prefix to the 'address attribute. (Clarification only). 

Objects are allocated by the compiler t? occupy one or more 16 bit 1750A 
words. Only in the presence record representation clauses are objects 
allocated to less than a word. 

Except for access objects, uninitialized objects contain an undefined value. 
An attempt to reference the value of an uninitialized object is not detected. 

The maximum number of enumeration literals of all types is limited only by 
available symbol table space. 

The predefined integer types are: 

Integer range -32_768 .. 32_767 and is implemented as a 1750A single 

precision fixed point data. 

Long Integer range -2_147_483_648 .. 2_147_483_647 and implemented as 
1750A double precision data. 

Short_Integer is not supported. 

System.Min_Int is -2_147_483_648. 

System.Max_Int is 2_147_483_647. 

The predefined real types are: 

Float digits 6. 

Long_Float digits 9. 

Short_Float is not presently supported. 

System.Max_Digits is presently 9 and is implemented as 1750A 48-bit 
floating point data. 


B-8 






Fixed poinC is implemented as 17S0A single and double precision data as is 
appropriate for the range and delta. 


On the 1750A, index constraints as well as other address values such as 
access types are limited to an unsigned range of 0 65_536 or a signed 
range of -32_768 .. 32_767. 

The maximum array size is limited to the size of virtual memory -- 64K words. 
The maximum String length is the same as for other arrays. 

Access objects are implemented as an unsigned 16 bit 1750A integer. The 
access literal Null is implementated as one word of zero on the 1750A. 

There is no limit on the number of dimensions of an array type. Array types 
are passed as parameters opposite unconstrained formal parameters using a 3 
word dope vector illustrated below: 


| Word address of first element | 
j Low bound value of first dimension j 
j Upper bound value of first dimension | 


Additional dimension bounds follow immediately for arrays with more than one 
dimension. 

LRM Chapter 4. 

Machine_Overflows is True for the 1750A. 

Pragma Controlled has no effect for the TLD VAX/1750A Compiler since garbage 
collection is never performed. 

LRM Chapter 5. 

The maximum number of statements in an Ada source program is undefined and 
limited only by Symbol Table space. 

Case statements unless they are quite sparse, are allocated as indexed jump 
vectors and are, therefore, quite fast. 

Loop statements with a for implementation scheme are implemented most 
efficiently on the 1750A if the range is in reverse and down to zero. 

Data declared in block statements on the 1750A is elaborated as part of its 
containing scope. 


B-9 









LRM Chapter 6. 

Arrays, records and task types are passed on the 1750A by reference. 

Pragma Inline Is not presently supported for subprograms. 

LRM Chapter 7. 

Package elaboration is performed dynamically permitting a warm restart 
without the necessity to reload the program. 

LRM Chapter 8. 

LRM Chapter 9. 

Task objects are implemented as access types pointing to a Task Information 
Block (TIB). 

Type Time in package Calendar is declared as a record containing two double 
precision integer values: the date in days and the real time clock. 

Pragma Priority is supported with a value of 1 to 16366. 

Pragma Shared is supported for scalar objects. 

LRM Chapter 10. 

Multiple Ada Program Libraries are supported with each library containing an 
optional ancester library. The predefined packages are contained in the TLD 
standard library, ADA.LIB. 

LRM Chapter 11. 

Exceptions are implemented by the TLD Ada Compiler System to take advantage 
of the normal policy in embedded computer system design to reserve 50% of the 
duty cycle. By executing a small number of instructions in the prologue of a 
procedure or block containing an exception handler, a branch may be taken, at 
the occurrence of an exception, directly to a handier rather than performing 
the time consuming code of unwinding procedure calls and stack frames. The 
philosophy taken is that an exception signals an exceptional condition, 
perhaps a serious one involving recovery or reconfiguration, and that quick 
response in this situation is more important and worth the small throughput 
tradeoff in a real time environment. 


B-IO 





LRM Chapter 12. 

A single generic instance is generated for a generic body. Generic 
specifications and bodies need not be compiled together nor need a body be 
compiled prior to the compilation of an instantiation. Because of the single 
expansion, this implementation of generics tend to be more favorable on the 
1750A because of the usual space savings achieved. To achieve this tradeoff, 
the instantiations must by nature be more general and are, therefore, 
somewhat less efficient timewise. 

LRM Chapter 13. 

Representation clause support and restrictions are defined above. 

A comprehensive Machine_Code package is provided and supported. 

Unchecked_Deallocation and Unchecked_Conversion are supported. 

The implementation dependent attributes are all supported except 
'Storage_Size for an access type. 

LRM Chapter 14. 

File I/O operations are not supported for the 1750A. Text_Io and 
Low_Level_Io are supported.

APPENDIX D 


WITHDRAWN TESTS 


Some tests are vithdravn from the ACVC because they do not conform to the 
Ada Standard. The folloving 44 tests had been vithdravn at the time of 
validation testing for the reasons indicated. A reference of the form 
Al-ddddd is to an Ada Commentary. 


a. E28005C: This test expects that the string "— TOP OF PAGE. —63" of 
line 204 vill appear at the top of the listing page due to a pragma 
PAGE in line 203; but line 203 contains text that follovs the pragma, 
and it is this text that must appear at the top of the page. 

b. A39005G: This test unreasonably expects a component clause to pack an 
array component into a minimum size (line 30). 

c. B97102E: This test contains an unintended illegality: a select 
statement contains a null statement at the place of a selective vait 
alternative (line 31). 

d. C97116A: This test contains race conditions, and it assumes that 

guards are evaluated indivisibly. A conforming implementation may use 
interleaved execution in such a vay that the evaluation of the guards 
at lines 50 & 54 and the execution of task CHANGING 0F_THE_GUARD 

results in a call to REPORT.FAILED at one of lines 52 or 56. 

e. BC3009B: This test vrongly expects that circular instantiations vill 
be detected in several compilation units even though none of the units 
is illegal vith respect to the units it depends on; by AI-00256, the 
illegality need not be detected until execution is attempted (line 
95). 

f. CD2A62D: This test vrongly requires that an array object's size be no 
greater than 10 although its subtype's size vas specified to be 40 
(line 137). 


D-l 





WITHDRAWN TESTS 


g. CD2A63A..D, CD2A66A..D, CD2A73A..D, and CD2A76A..D (16 tests): These 
tests wrongly attempt to check the size of objects of a derived type 
(for which a 'SIZE length clause is given) by passing them to a 
derived subprogram (which implicitly converts them to the parent type 
(Ada standard 3.4:14)). Additionally, they use the 'SIZE length 
clause and attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic 
by the WG9 ARG. 

h. CD2A81G, CD2A83G, CD2A84M..N, and CD50110 (5 tests): These tests 

assume that dependent tasks will terminate while the main program 
executes a loop that simply tests for task termination; this is not 
the case, and the main program may loop indefinitely (lines 74, 85, 
86, 96, and 58, respectively). 

i. CD2B15C and CD7205C: These tests expect that a 'STORAGE_SIZE length 
clause provides precise control over the number of designated objects 
in a collection; the Ada standard 13.2:15 allows that such control 
must not be expected. 

j. CD2D11B: This test gives a SMALL representation clause for a derived 
fixed-point type (at line 30) that defines a set of model numbers that 
are not necessarily represented in the parent type; by Commentary 
AI-00099, all model numbers of a derived fixed-point type must be 
representable values of the parent type. 

k. CD5007B: This test wrongly expects an implicitly declared subprogram 
to be at the address that is specified for an unrelated subprogram 
(line 303). 

l. ED7004B, ED7005C..D, and ED7006C..D (5 tests): These tests check 
various aspects of the use of the three SYSTEM pragmas; the AVO 
withdraws these tests as being inappropriate for validation. 

m. CD7105A: This test requires that successive calls to CALENDAR.CLOCK 
change by at least SYSTEM.TICK; however, by Commentary AI-00201, it is 
only the expected frequency of change that must be at least 
SYSTEM.TICK—particular instances of change may be less (line 29). 

n. CD7203B and CD7204B: These tests use the 'SIZE length clause and 
attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic by the WG9 
ARG. 

o. CD7205D: This test checks an invalid test objective: it treats the 
specification of storage to be reserved for a task's activation as 
though it were like the specification of storage for a collection. 


D-2 



WITHDRAWN TESTS 


p. CE2107I: This test requires that objects of two similar scalar types 
be distinguished when read from a file—DATA_ERROR is expected to be 
raised by an attempt to read one object as of the other type. 
However, it is not clear exactly how the Ada standard 14.2.4:4 is to 
be interpreted; thus, this test objective is not considered valid 
(line 90). 

q. CE3111C: This test requires certain behavior, when two files are 
associated with the same external file, that is not required by the 
Ada standard. 

r. CE3301A: This test contains several calls to END_0F_LINE and 

END_OF_PAGE that have no parameter: these calls were intended to 
specify a file, not to refer to STANDARD INPUT (lines 103, 107, 118, 
132, and 136). 

s. CE3411B: This test requires that a text file's column number be set to 
COUNT'LAST in order to check that LAY0UT_ERR0R is raised by a 
subsequent PUT operation. But the former operation will generally 
raise an exception due to a lack of available disk space, and the test 
would thus encumber validation testing.

compiler in a syntax checking mode only. 

Keywords are used for selecting various compiler options. The 
complement keyword, if it exists, is used to disable a compiler option 
ar.d is formed by prefixing the switch keyword with "no_". 

Switches may be abbreviated to the number of characters required to 
uniquely identify the switch. For example, the switch "elaborator" 
(explained in the list, below) may be uniquely identified by th* 
abbreviation "el." Of course, the entire name may be used. If sn 
option is not specified by Che user, a default setting is assumed. All 
specified compiler options apply to a single invocation of the compiler. 

The default setting of a switch and its meaning are defined In the table 
below. The meaning of the comp lament fora can be derived by 
complementing the meaning of the switch. For some switches, the 
complement meaning is not obvious; these complement switch keywords are 
listed separately. 

In the description of the switches, the target dependent name <targeo 
is used. The value of this symbol is determined by the value of the 
eargec avicch. 

Compiler generated file specifications generally conform to host 
conventions. For example: 

The generated file name is the source filename appended with Che default 
file suffix. If the user specifies en output fils name, no default 
suffix is provided.

lffbador 

32bador -- default 

The 32BADDR option causes address computations to be performed 
using 1750A double precision fixed point data words. If 
16BADDR is selected, address computations will be performed 
using single precision fixed point data words ignoring the 
possibility of a 1750A Fixed Point Overflow Interrupt due to 
computation of an address greater than 7FFF hex. Applicable 
to 1750A target only.

The TLD defined cheek^identifier exception_info is explained 
below. 

TLDada generates a string in the relocatable object code that 
is the full path name of the fils being compiled. TLDada also 
generates extra instructions in the relocatable code that are 
used by the Run Time System to inform the programmer where an 
unhandled exception is raised. The no_checks-excepeion_info 
switch will suppress both the string and extra instructions, 
whereas Che pragma will only suppress the extra instructions.
