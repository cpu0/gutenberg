PILOT bug -- 30-Jan-80 


A bug exists in the current version of Atari PILOi? which 
produces unpredictable results when string indirection is used 
as the target of an I/O operation using the READ: and A: 
commands. The two forms which fail are shown below: 


A:$$<string name) 

READ:<device>,$$<string name) 


All other uses of string indirection work as advertised; for 
example: 


A:$$<string name>=<text expression) 
C:$$<string name)=<text expression) 
$$<string name) within a <text expression) 


The bug is easily avoided by doing the indirect assignments in 
two steps as shown below: 


A: $TEMP 

C: $$TARGET=$TEMP 


READ:<device>,$TEMP 
C:$ $TARGET=$TEMP 












PILOT BEHAVIORS 


22—DEC—80 


THERE ARE SEVERAL UNEXPECTED BEHAVIORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE l-DEC-80 VERS3B 
OF PILOT; THESE ARE EXPLAINED IN THE PARAGRAPHS THAT FOLLOW- 

1. 7.Z BUGS — THERE ARE TWO KNOWN BUGS RELATING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 
THE SPECIAL VARIABLE 7.Z. THE FIRST BUG IS THAT WHEN A LINE SEGMENT IS 
DRAWN WHICH LEAVES THE SCREEN (DRAW, DRAWTO, FILL OR FILLTO), 7.Z WILL 
RETURN THE VALUE OF THE POINT AT WHICH THE LINE SEGMENT ENDS (WITHIN 
THE SCREEN). THIS PROBLEM MAY BE RESOLVED BY ADDING A 'GR:GO 0" BETijg 
THE LINE DRAW AND THE 7.Z USAGE. 


THE SECOND BUG IS THAT THERE IS AN INTERACTION BETWEEN STRING VARIABLE 
ACCESSES AND 7.Z SUCH THAT 7.Z WILL RETURN AN INVALID VALUE WHENEVER 
THERE IS A STRING ACCESS BETWEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE GRAPHICS 
CURSOR POSITION AND THE USE OF 7.Z. THIS PROBLEM MAY BE RESOLVED BY 
ADDING A 'GR: GO 0' JUST PRIOR TO THE 7.Z USAGE. THE PROBLEM IS C0MPLI3 
IF THE USER WANTS TO USE 7.Z AS PART OF A STRING ASSIGNMENT OR IN ANY 
TEXT EXPRESSION CONTAINING A STRING VARIABLE,_ IN THIS CASE THE PROBLEl 
IS RESOLVED BY ASSIGNING 7.Z TO A NUMERIC VARIABLE PRIOR TO ITS INTENDS 
USE. 


THE EXAMPLES BELOW SHOW THE RECOMMENDED RESOLUTIONS FOR THE PROBLEMS 
MENTIONED ABOVE: 


GR:TURN ?; DRAW 
GR:GO 0 
T: 7.Z 


i COULD BE OFF THE SCREEN. 

Z FORCES CORRECT CURSOR POSITION. 


GR:PEN UP; GOTO #X,#Y 
T:HELLO $NAME 
GR: GO 0 
T: 7.Z 


Z CLOBBERS 7.Z'S CURSOR POSITION. 

Z REESTABLISHES 7.Z 'S CURSOR POSITION. 


GR:PEN UP; GOTO #X,#Y 
C: #Z=7.Z 

C;$FIFO=$FIFO, ttZ. 



PILOT CHANGES 


IB-Dec-80 


The following changes have been incorporated into Atari PILOT 
starting with the Ol-Dec-80 version. 

J. The execution of a Load command while in run mode nov; clears 
the Use stack. 

2. The Write statement syntax has been changed from: 

<Write operand> ::= <device><sep><texp> 

<sep> ::= , |<space>|<sep><sep> 


to 


<Write operand> ::= <device><wsep><texp> 

<wsep> ::= ,|<space> 

This means that leading commas and spaces may now be written to 
a device using a text literal within the text expression; prior 
to this change, leading spaces and commas were ignored. 

3. The Auto-number screen color and luminance are now alterable 
by the user; the default values are setup in RAM at power-up 
time and are not altered by the PILOT interpreter thereafter 
except by command of the operator, as shown below. 

C:@B134=<background color/lum value> 

C:@B]35=<letter 1urn value>
