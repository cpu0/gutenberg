SNAPSHOTS OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 
APPLICATIONS WITHIN THE 
SPACE STATION FREEDOM PROGRAM 









SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND ADA TRAINING 


o SOFTECH (RICIS) 1987 SURVEY OF NASA: 

. OVER 150 ADA PROJECTS WITHIN 5 YEARS 
. MINIMAL EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL 
. MUCH SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND ADA TRAINING 
NEEDED 

- FEW WRITTEN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT POLICIES 

o TRAINING RECEIVING MUCH MORE ATTENTION 
(but its still too little and maybe too late) 

EXAMPLES: 

- EXPANDED COMPUTER-BASED AND CLASS ROOM 
TRAINING FROM SSE 

- TOP MANAGEMENT ATTENTION 



SOFTWARE REUSE 


o WANT TO CAPITALIZE ON RESEARCH AND EXPERIENCE 
TO DATE 

- EXAMPLES: o ARMY ’RAPID’ TOOL FOR 

LIBRARY MANAGEMENT 
o UNIVERSITY TAXONOMY/ 
ATTRIBUTES WORK 


o POLICY WILL ENCOURAGE REUSE 

- COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT 

- TRY DURING RAPID PROTOTYPING 

o PIVOT POINTS 

- CONTRACTOR INCENTIVES 

- ACCOUNTABILITY AND LIABILITY

PROGRAM CHARACTERISTICS 

DISTRIBUTED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT & MAINTENANCE 



INTEGRATED, INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS 

(HOW MUCH IS NECESSARY FOR SPACE STATION FREEDOM PROGRAM ?) 


o ESA, NASDA, AND CANADA WILL PROVIDE MISSION/LIFE 
CRITICAL FLIGHT SOFTWARE 

. QUALITY OF PARTNER DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS 
UNKNOWN AND UNCONTROLLED 
. LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN MAN-RATED, COMPLEX 
SOFTWARE 

° HOW COMMON OR INTEROPERABLE MUST BE THE DEVELOPMENT 
ENVIRONMENTS? AND HOW DO WE ANSWER THAT QUESTION? 

- WRITE TIGHT INTERFACE SPECS? 

HOW CAN WE DETERMINE NECESSARY 
** DATA EXCHANGES? 

- PROVIDE THE SSE TO THE PARTNERS? 

— ^ TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER (?) 

- SHARE A CRITICAL SUBSET? 

^ STANDARDS? TOOLS? ALL OR PART? 

ENVIRONMENTS ARE TIGHTLY INTEGRATED 


THIS ISSUE MUST BE SETTLED SOON
