INTRODUCTION 


"A Programming Language" (APL) is a precise, concise, and powerful 
computer programming language. It was developed by K. E. Iverson, while 
he was at Harvard, and described in a 1962 Wiley publication. In 1966 
an APL experiment time-sharing system was implemented for the IBM 360. 
Shortly thereafter APL gained wide acceptance by mathematicians, 
scientists, engineers, and statisticians to assist them with their work. 
APL is presently available on the IBM 360/95 at the Goddard Space Flight 
Center (GSFC) . 

Several features make APL useful to managers and other potential 
computer users. APL is interactive; therefore, the user can communicate 
with his program or data base in near real-time. This, coupled with 
the fact that APL has excellent debugging features, reduces program 
checkout time to minutes or hours rather than days or months. Of partic- 
ular importance is the fact that APL can be utilized as a management 
science tool using such techniques as operations research, statistical 
analysis, and forecasting. 

The gap between the scientist and the manager could be narrowed by 
showing how APL can be used to do what the scientists and the manager 
each need to do, retrieve information. Sometimes, the information needs 
to be retrieved rapidly. In this case APL is ideally suited for this 
challenge. 

The National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) at GSFC has developed 
a computer program called IRA (Information Retrieval using APL). This 
program accesses a data base containing information relating to space 
science experiments and to the phenomena being measured. IRA is a tool 
for retrieving information in response to requests made by the scientific 
community. IRA is executed from a remote terminal (to the IBM 360/95) 
and results are achieved in seconds. 

This report describes the data base, the general search requirement, 
and explains how to use the system. 


THE DATA BASE 


Large amounts of data from scientific satellites and space probes 
are sent to NSSDC for the purpose of making them available to the inter- 
national scientific community. The data come from a wide variety of 
devices measuring: (a) outgoing terrestrial and planetary radiations in 

the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV), and radio waves, (b) solar and 
cosmic radio waves, UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray radiations, (c) ionospheric 


1 



composition and dynamics, (d) atmospheric composition arid dynamics, (e) solar 
and galactic cosmic rays, (f) magnetospheric plasma, particles, and magnetic 
and electric fields, (g) interplanetary plasma, and electric and magnetic 
fields, (h) micrometeorites, and (i) lunar and planetary terrain features. 

Any one space science experiment may actually study more than one phenomenon; 
therefore, more than one keyword string may be associated with an experiment 
(with a limit of 10 such strings). 

The data base is composed of the following two files. The Experiment 
File provides information common to all strings, and the Phenomenon File 
provides information unique for a particular string. 


THE EXPERIMENT FILE 

The Experiment File contains information common to all keyword strings 
(phenomena studied) associated with the experiment. The file includes (but 
is not limited to) the following information: 

1. NSSDC Experiment ID Code 

The NSSDC Experiment ID is a 10-character 
code that uniquely identifies each experiment. 

2. Experiment Identification 

The Experiment Identification is a 42-character field 
that contains the spacecraft common name, the experiment 
name, and the principal investigator's last name. 

3. Experiment Agent (EAG) ID Code 

EAG is a three-character field for the initials or 
mnemonic of the acquisition scientist to whom the experi- 
ment is currently assigned at NSSDC. 

4. NSSDC Date 

NSSDC Dates are the earliest and latest dates of coverage 
for any data identified by NSSDC to be from a given experiment.

PHENOMENON FILE 


The Phenomenon File provides ja string of information pertaining to 
a particular phenomenon being measured by an experiment aboard a space- 
craft. Some experiments study several different phenomena; therefore, 
one experiment may have several springs of keywords describing each 
phenomenon measured. A keyword string consists of 22 fields, 15 of which 
are two-letter codes (Cl through G15). Two fields are floating point 
numbers N1 and N2, and the remaining five fields are dates T1 through 
T5. T1 through T5 are common to ill strings for a given experiment. 

Of the 15 two-character codes used in each keyword string, the first 
six (Cl - C6) are used to answer ihe question "what is measured?" The 
next four (C7 - CIO) answer the question "where are the measurements 
taken or what remote sources are sensed?" The next four (Cll - C14) 
are mode status indicators or data usefulness codes. The last one (C15)* 
identifies the meaning of floating point fields N1 and N2, which 
are used to specify a particle energy range or electromagnetic radiation 
frequency range, or the like. Thj> five date fields (Experiment Operation 
History (EOH)) record the time history of the major operating modes of the 
experiment. These dates are related to the Cll - C14 fields in that the 
status of operation of the mode in the time interval T1 to T2 is given 
in Cll, T2 to T3 in C12, etc. Fewer than five dates may be used. 

Figure 1 shows the phenomenon keywords that may be used.

The user inputs search criteria to interrogate the data base. The 
criteria may consist of a series of "AND" relationships between the dif- 
ferent field conditions being considered. 

For example: Cl = CP AND C2 = PN. 

A single field may also have a choice of values to be matched, as for 
Cl in Cl = CP OR EM AND C2 = PN. 

If fields C7 through CIO are to be examined, only C7 = xx should be 
entered as all of the fields as a set will be checked for a match with xx. 

For field CIS (units indicator) enter CE and respond to the range 
boundary questions asked by the program. 

The terminal prompts the user with a series of questions or requests. 

1. "What Search Requirement?" 

These are the conditions on Cl through C7 and Cl 5. If CIS 
is not chosen in the search requirement, then the terminal skips 
responses 2 and 3 following. 

2. "Enter Lower, Upper Limit of Nl" 

The user supplies a range of values in which Nl must fall. 

The lower and upper limit are separated by a space. 

3. "Enter Lower, Upper Limit of N2" 

The user supplies a range of values in which N2 must fall. 

The lower and upper limit are separated by a space. (If the user 
is not interested in N1/N2 range, enter 0 1E38 at the N1/N2 prompt.) 

4. "Is a Time Period Desired? Yes or No" 

If the user response is "No," then the terminal skips 
responses 5 and 6. 

5. "Enter Lower and Upper Limit of Time Period (YYMMDD YYMMDD)" 

The user supplies the time range in which he is interested. 

The lower and, upper limits of the time period are separated by a 
space. 

6. "What Condition on Data Usefulness? ULN, UL, N, ETC?" 

The user supplies the conditions for Cll through C14. The 
permissible entries are U, L, or N or any combination thereof. 


The interplay between these conditions, the time period desired (last 
question), and the EOH are described in more detail in the following 
section. Output. 


5 



When these questions have been answered, IRA responds with the 
number of strings that satisfied the request and then, asks if the user 
wishes to list the strings. If the answer is yes, then the user has 
the option of choosing a short form or a standard form for the output. 


THE OUTPUT 

The standard form for the output is a one-line-per-Phenomenon string 
report. Fields are chosen from both Phenomenon File and Experiment File 
with each line containing the following information. 

1. NSSDC ID 

2. 42-character "ID" (spacecraft, experiment, and experimenter names) 

3. N1 

4. N2 

5. C15 

6. TA* 

7. TB* 

8. NSSDC Data 

9. EAGENT 

TA* and TB* are defined as the first date of the first interval and 
the second date of the last interval in which the original search criteria 
are satisfied. For example, if the EOH contains five dates (Tl, T2, T3, T4, 
and T5), and if TA (first date of requester- specif ied interval) falls between 
Tl and T2, and TB (last date of requester specified interval) falls between 
T3 and T4, and also if Cll and C13 satisfy the criteria placed on them, 
then TA* = Tl and TB* = T4. However, if Cll and C12 satisfy their criteria 
but 03 does not, then TA* = Tl and TB* = T3. If EOH has fewer than five 

dates and there is one fewer of the columns Cll - 04. filled in than EOH 

has dates, the experiment has terminated, and TA* and TB* are selected as 
described earlier. However, if EOH has fewer than five dates and there are 
as many of the columns Cll - 04 filled in as EOH has dates, the following 
applies: If TB (last date of interest to requester) precedes the last given 

EOH date, then TB* is determined as before; but, if TB is later than the last 

given EOH date and if the last date usefulness code (this could be Cll or 

02 or 03 or 04) satisfies its condition, TB* is printed PRESENT. 

If TA precedes Tl, then TA* = Tl (if Cll meets criteria). 

If TB follows T5, then TB* = T5 (if 04 meets criteria). 

If the user prefers the short form for the output, then each line 
merely contains the NSSDC ID and the 42-character Experiment Identification. 


HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM 


To sign on to the system, the user must first dial extension 34, wait for 
the whistle, place receiver in appropriate spot, type )2222, and wait for the 


6 



response. After the computer responds, type in )L0AD BETH. The appropriate 
software is now in the active workspace. To initiate a request, the user types 
in ASK. From then on, IRA prompts the user. In this section several 
examples are given to show the user how to use the system. The examples 
given are taken from the actual data base, which consists of about 3000 
strings of experiment phenomena keywords. 


Example 1 

Determine the number of phenomenon strings that measure 
Charged Particles.

Since there were so many strings that satisfied this request, the 
user did not choose to list the strings. The next sample is an attempt 
to narrow the number of strings that satisfy the request.
