LO OTV EXTENSION STUDY OVERVIEW 

This activity is an extension of the Orbital Transfer Vehicle Concept Definition and System 
Analysis Study that was initially awarded in July, 1984. The original study established the OTV 
design, operations and basing concepts that were most effective in the situation where: 1) Shuttle 
capability is growing aggressively; 2) Space Station is being phased in; 3) Decisions are to be 
justified by a conservative mission model; and 4) Any large lift capability development is to be 
justified by high earth orbit transport benefits. This extension scenario establishes changes to the 
OTV program that would result from: 1) A wide variety of aggressive mission models; and 2) A 
large cargo vehicle capability whose DDT&E is not charged to the OTV program. Thus the 
extension study opens the scope of potential recommendations by introducing a variety of 
ambitious programs, and by making the large cargo vehicle reconmiended by the Space 
Transportation Architecture Studies available at no acquisition cost to the OTV program. It is a 
further objective of the extension study to evaluate the sensitivity of OTV program 
recommendations to scenario variations such as different mission models, different launch vehicle 
availability, and different space station availability. 

We conducted this study in two primary parts, the first culnunating in the midterm review 
and the second in the final review and this final report The activities conducted in the first part, as 
shown in Figure 1, were primarily those that could be accomplished without a definition of the

large cargo vehicle. When this definition became available from the ST AS studies after the midterm 
review, the activities that were dependant on this information were conducted. These primarily 
delved into the effect of the availability of the large cargo vehicle on the preferred OTV program. 
Requirements assessments were ongoing throughout the whole study, as the definition of mission 
requirements is always in a continuous state of change. Operations and acconmiodations 
assessments were also continuous, and supported all study activities as required. Final extension 
study output includes definition of a baseline cargo vehicle supported OTV program and an 
assessment of the sensitivity of this baseline program selection to mission model options, to launch 
vehicle availability, and to variations in the space station development scenario. Finally, 
recommendations relative to the OTV development activities that should be followed were made. 



10 SUMMARY OF EXTENSION STUDY 

11 EXTENSION STUDY OBJECTIVES 

The purpose of this extension to the OTV Concept Definition and System Analysis Study 
was to improve our understanding of the OTV program that will be most beneficial to the nation in 
the 1995 - 2010 timeframe. This activity built on the effort completed in prior study effort It 
investigated the implications of the missions defined for, and launch vehicle defmed by, the Space 
Transportation Architecture Study (ST AS). It delved more deeply into selected concerns. 

The key new mission requirements identified for STAS reflect a desire for greater early 
capability and more ambitious growth capability. The four key technical objectives and related 
issues addressed are: 1) To update and expand prior study activities; 2) To investigate the impact of 
a Large Cargo Vehicle (LCV); 3) To optimize OTV operations and space based OTV 
accommodations; and 4) To investigate program alternatives applicable to different use scenarios. 
We have updated the OTV program approach previously selected in the area of vehicle design. 
New mission requirements, evolving space station definition, and proposed new launch vehicles 
were evaluated. We enhanced our analyses of selected areas including aeroshield design, proximity 
operations and the balance of EVA and IVA operations used in support of the OTV at the space 
base. 

These activities led to an improved definition of an OTV program that should receive 
favorable consideration for an early new start An important aspect of this effort was developing a 
thorough understanding of the sensitivity of the OTV program selection to changes in use, 
economic environment and technology development We conducted sensitivity studies to establish 
how the OTV program should be tailored to meet changing circumstances. 

2,2 CONCLUSIONS - RESULTS 

This extension study has assessed the impact that the existence of a Large Cargo Vehicle and 
a variety of aggressive mission models would have on the preferred Orbital Transfer Vehicle 
program. We find that the low Earth-to-Orbit transportation cost provided by the LCV, nominally 
$70M to deliver 150,000 pounds to low earth orbit (LEO), is a significant benefit to carrying out 
any high earth orbit program. We prefer an OTV program supported by a large cargo vehicle 
whose acquisition cost is not charged to the OTV program. We find that an aeroassisted reusable 
OTV remains the preferred design approach in the stipulated LCV, aggressive mission model 
scenario. An OTV designed to operate from the LCV is different than one designed to be supported 
by the existing Orbiter. We prefer a three in-line engine configuration that achieves engine-out 



capability with a short configuration, and provides a convenient growth path from unmanned 
ground based operations to manned space based operations. We find a two vehicle fleet provides 
cost effective support of the nominal civil and DoD mission models defined for use by the Space 
Transportation Architecture Study (STAS). The ground based configuration should not be 
man-rated, and should be used through the operational period The larger space based OTV should 
support all GEO and lunar missions, which encompass all man-rated requirements. 

A space based OTV capability is key to the operation of advanced missions such as the lunar 
base and manned Mars initiatives that have been suggested by the National Commission On Space. 
It is also highly beneficial to the operation of the manned GEO missions that are expected to begin 
shortly after the turn of the century. Our analyses show that the space based OTV cost per flight 
will be 10 % lower than ground based cost per flight We believe it is possible for the space based 
OTV to be economically competitive with a totally ground based program on a discounted life cycle 
cost basis, but it is necessary to take care in constituting a space based program and to credit all the 
potential benefits of the space based program to achieve this goal. The development cost of 
achieving a space based capability must be controlled Cost sharing of facilities with the OMV 
program is necessary, and the development of an efficient propellant storage facility that is matched 
with Space Station reboost system propellant requirements is encouraged We find that the low 
cost of the LCV tends to reduce the economic advantage of space basing over ground basing, in 
comparison with the advantage that exists in a scenario supported completely by the existing Orbiter 
system enhanced by an Aft Cargo Carrier based propellant scavenging system. In both cases, the 
operational economy of space basing stems from more efficient utilization of the launch vehicle. 
We found that most OTV propellant requirements could be provided by scavenged propeilants in 
the Orbiter supported (low flight rate) scenario, and that the cost advantage of scavenged 
propeilants over Orbiter transported propeilants was very large. In the case of the lower cost LCV, 
the cost advantage of '^hitchhiked" propeilants was less, but still significant A corollary advantage 
of space basing is that the more efficient utilization of the launch vehicle results in fewer Earth to 
LEO launches and consequent lower use of a reusable, or partially reusable, launch vehicle. 
Launch vehicle replacement cost is thus reduced. When these cost advantages are incorporated in 
to the economic comparison of ground and space based OTV programs, they become very close on 
a discounted life cycle cost basis, and the advantage lies with the space based concept in constant 
year dollars. 

We found further advantages to space basing OTV that make development of this capability 
desirable beyond its potential for lower future operational cost 

1) Space basing assures access to GEO by providing an alternative transfer capability; 



2) Space basing decouples launch and transfer activity , enabling GEO payload launch to 
LEO by foreign/commercial vehicles and yielding greater mission flexibility; 

3) Fewer ground launches are required, reducing the risk of launch area contamination and 
the possibility of catastrophic accidents; 

4) Space station based GEO transfer operations enable reduced payload losses through 
checkout, bum-in, and repair at LEO - which will lead to lower insurance rates; 

5) A space based operation will reduce vulnerability to some low technology threat classes. 

We found that the high traffic mission scenarios suggested by the strategic defense initiative 
and nuclear waste disposal justify adding a small OTV that is efficiently tailored to support these 
mission options. We found that the aggressive expansion of the civil mission scenario into very 
large GEO spacecraft and advanced lunar base support did not justify development of a very large 
OTV configuration. Rather, it proved more economical to use multi-stage configurations 
comprised of smaller OTVs, or spacecraft segmentation. We also found an ancillary advantage of 
space basing in the fact that it tends to desensitize the cost of HEO space operations to the cost of 
the launch vehicle. 

23 RECOMMENDATIONS 

We recommend that an unmanned, ground based OTV capability be developed in the mid 
1990's, and that this capability be retained throughout the foreseeable future. Development of this 
vehicle as an aeroassisted reusable vehicle is economically justified, even in the most modest 
projected mission scenarios. We believe that, even though it is difficult to justify on a discounted 
life cycle cost basis, the lower operational cost of space based OTV missions and the ancillary 
operational benefits justify investment in space basing. We recommend directing further Phase A 
effort at identifying an initial OTV that will be useful whether or not a large cargo vehicle program 
is initiated in the near future, and one that has a good growth path to space based capability. We 
believe the key to meeting this objective is to develop a concept that can fly in an Aft Cargo Carrier 
or a large cargo vehicle with minimal design penalty. After this concept is delineated, an extended 
Phase B should optimize the concept, and a full scale development directed at achieving a mid 90's 
initial operational capability should be undertaken. The scheduling of the full capability , space 
based OTV development program depends on the progress of the Space Station program, but we 
recommend undertaking this development as soon as possible. 



3.0 MISSION AND LAUNCH VEHICLE DRIVEN REQUIREMENTS 

The STAS mission model defines four program options for both the civilian and the DoD 
program. Our studies were ground ruled to deal with five of the 16 possible combinations as 
shown in Figure 2, Scenario 2, representing the baseline civil and the normal growth DoD options 
was used for all design decisions and recommendations. The impacts of the other Scenario 
requirements summarized were studied as sensitivities. The major differences from Scenario 2 are 
as follows: 

• Scenario 1 has no manned or lunar missions. Its traffic level is roughly equivalent to 
the Revision 8 Nominal Model that was used in the 1984/85 portion of this study, 

• The OTV portion of Scenario 3 is changed little from Scenario 2, but does have three 
additional large planetary missions, 

• Scenario 4 has a large increase in DoD traffic to low altitude, mid-inclination orbits. 

• Scenario 5 reflects the new Lunar Base and Manned Mars initiatives suggested by the 
National Commission on Space, and a large number of nuclear waste disposal missions.

The major characteristics of the three launch vehicle options considered in the extension 
study, the shuttle, a large cargo vehicle and STS n, are summarized in Figure 3. Nominal payload 
capability, cargo bay size and cost are shown ~ as are variations considered fix>m a sensitivity point 
of view. The nominal availability date for the large cargo vehicle is 1995, the STS n availability 
date is 2002. Consideration is also given to a sensitivity scenario where advanced launch vehicle 
availability dates are delayed. Note that, unlike the groundrule used during the first part of this 
study, these capabilities are available without sharing the development and build cost required to 
acquire them.

4.0 STS BASED CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT 

The initial portion of the extension to the Orbital Transfer Vehicle Extension Study was used 
to update Phase 1 vehicle designs to reflect changing mission and system requirements, to conduct 
a common basis trade of candidate aeroassist devices, and to conduct a trade study to identify the 
preferred STS Cargo Bay OTV design concept 

4.1 UPDATE OF PHASE 1 VEHICLES 

Our 1984/85 studies established that tiie Revision 8 Low Mission Model justified an OTV 
fleet comprised of two vehicles: An unmanned, ground based, cryogenic OTV designed to be 
lifted to orbit in tiie Aft Cargo Carrier, and a man-rated, cryogenic OTV permanently based at the 
Space Station. Both configurations used a four-propellant-tank concept. Since the ground based 
configuration was not man-rated, it used one main engine. This engine incorporated new 
technology, but pressed it only to a performance level of 475 seconds specific impulse to reduce 
development risk. This same engine is used in a dual installation in tiie space based configuration. 
The propellant capacity of the ground based configuration was 45,000 pounds. In tiie Revision 8 
scenario, the space based configuration must retrieve a 7500 pound manned capsule. Its 55,000 
pound propellant capacity and its 44 foot aerobrake diameter were sized to meet tiiis requirement. 
Botii configurations used composite structure ~ graphite epoxy for the cool structure and graphite 
polyimide for the hot aerobrake support structure. The selected program was justified by the 
Revision 8 Low Mission Model. The IOC for die ground based system was 1984, and the space 
based IOC was 1999. This scenario justified development of the ACC scavenging system rather 
than a new large capability propellant tanker. The space based vehicle, altiiough not initially 
man-rated, had all tiie equipment installed that was required to make this possible. The only 
additional requirement to achieve man rating was validated flight experience, which was to be 
gained during the early unmanned years of space based operation. 



12 



Figure 4 shows an updated version of the ground based OTV recommended by the 1984/85 
study effort. Updates were required to meet the improved definition of the low altitude debris 
model currently available, and to meet the vibration environment anticipated in the ACC. The 
resulting updates are: Beefed up structure to provide a margin for possible load increases and the 
ACC vibration environment anticipated; And the addition of debris shielding to die propellant tanks. 
We also redesigned the aerobrake to more faithfully implement the blunted cone aerobrake shape 
proven on the Viking Mars landers. In the initial design, aerobrake ribs were curved to fit more 
readily into the dedicated ACC. In the updated design, the fold is moved outboard to enable the 
incorporation of straight ribs. The resulting weight increases are reflected in the figure.

The primary updates to the space based cryogenic OTV concept developed in the 1984/85 
study effort are with regard to overall sizing and additional meteoroid and debris protection. The 
revision in overall sizing results from the updated mission model being used for this study (Rev. 
9). This mission model requires a 74 Klb propellant capacity OTV to perform the 12,000 pound 
up, 10,000 pound return manned GEO Sortie and GEO Shack Logistics missions. Therefore, the 
vehicle has been scaled up in size from the 55 Klb propellant capacity required in the earlier effort. 
The revised conifiguration and associated weight statement is shown in Figure 5.

A comprehensive, common basis, design comparison was developed for the three basic 
aeroassist concepts under consideration. The concepts are illustrated in Figure 6 « the rigid 
aerobrake, the flex aerobrake, and the ballute. The design evaluations were completely 
comparable, and used Martin Marietta estinmting factors throughout The design was selected to 
perform the maximum GEO round trip mission as defined early in the extension study -- a 13, 300 
pound up, 1 1,300 pound down mission with a 23 foot length. This payload is slightly heavier and 
longer than the one defined by MSFC after the midterm review (12K up, lOK down and 15 feet 
long). It still suffices on a common reference condition, but does drive the ballute design to a 
larger diameter to achieve aerodynamic stability. Selection criteria included program cost, vehicle 
performance, growth potential and flexibility.

Figure 7 shows the weight and cost data derived for each of the space based OTV concepts 
considered during this trade study. The results indicate that production and development costs 
cannot be used as significant discriminators in comparing the vehicle concepts. The major cost item 
is the operational cost of providing propellant for the OTV and maintaining the vehicle in space. 
The propellant required is primarily a function of the vehicle dry weight shown. The data shows 
that the ballute is only effective with the 1500T backwall temperature - which could have an 
impact on retrieval spacecraft thermal protection. With the 1500T backwall temperature, the ballute 
is competitive with the rigid brake. The flex brake design at a L/D = 0.12 is the lightest. Included

in the operational costs are the servicing operations of removing and replacing the aeroassist 
devices on each of the OTV concepts. This particular operation is the only discernible difference in 
space based maintenance of the three concepts and is still relatively minute in comparison to the 
propellant launch costs. 

The preferred flex brake design is summarized in Figure 8. The central 14.5 foot diameter is 
fabricated using shuttle tiles set on a graphite polyimide honeycomb cone with engine doors 
incorporated in it This structure forms a base for the graphite polyimide ribs that support tiie 
flexible portion. The flexible portion is a multi-ply Nicalon faced Q felt and NEXTEL blanket 
which is sealed with RTV sealant on the cool (600* F) inside surface. The ribs are glued to the 
blanket to provide torsional stiffness. An inflated torus provides required curvature at the periphery 
of the brake, and stiffens the edge. As noted, this is the lightest design approach to a low L/D 
aerobrake. 

This flexible material is in a developmental stage, and its operational characteristics are not 
well understood. In lieu of definitive data, its operational life has been estimated at five uses - 
shorter than the rigid brake at 20 uses, but longer than die single mission life of the ballute which 
must be repeatedly flexed during use. The data being developed by die Ames Research Center is 
promising, but needs to be pursued further. Therefore, our recommendation - use the concept but 
continue to support the materials technology program.

4.3 CARGO BAY VEHICLE TRADE 

The concepts considered in the cargo bay trade study include various configurations of 
storable and cryogenic propellant vehicles. Cryogenic propellant concepts were sized for the three 
tankage configurations shown in Figure 9. In addition, the concepts were sized for two aerobrake 
types (ballute and flexible folding fabric brakes) for each of the tankages. Each of these cryogenic 
concepts is intended to be fully reusable with the exception of the acrobrakcs which may be 
replaced after each mission.

The storable propellant concepts include a liquid expendable stage and a reusable liquid 
perigee stage with a solid apogee kick stage. These were conceived to compare lengths and total 
costs with the most attractive cryogenic configurations. 

Cost comparisons were made on the basis of the 35 ground based missions in the low 
Revision 8 mission model. Vehicles were sized to perform a 15,000 pound GEO delivery mission 
(slightly over the 14.5 Klb mission that appears early in the Revision 9 mission model). This 
sizing provides a stage that can perform all early model missions, even though the launch mode 
could be complex if STS payload growth is not achieved. The criteria used to select between these 
options includes the cost parameters indicated in Figure 9, and consideration of the flexibility the 
configuration provides for growth to larger energy applications. Launch cost is strongly influenced 
by configuration length and the impact it has on the STS charge algorithm in non-weight-limited 
manifest.

Figure 10 shows the selection data for the ground based OTV candidates. Gross weight and 
length data reflect vehicle sizing to perform a 15,000 pound delivery mission; adeqxiate to support 
near term Revision 9 model delivery requirements. The primary evaluation criteria of interest is 
cost associated with STS flights for OTVs and their payloads. Length of each concept in the cargo 
bay is the large driver in determining STS flights required when vehicle gross weight is not limited. 
This was assumed to be the case in determining the number of flights required shown in Figure 10. 
Although production and development costs may not be significant in terms of decision making, 
they are accounted for.

Consideration must also be given to overall flexibility for flying higher energy missions as 
well as adapting to the possible new generation booster vehicles. In addition, a smooth transition 
from a ground based vehicle to space based is a desirable feature, providing that this growth path is 
cost effective for a given vehicle concept 

Torus flex, torus ballute, and the two storable configurations are competitive cost options. 
The storables were eliminated because they were too heavy to fly in any version of STS anticipated. 
While the cost of the ballute design is competitive, we selected the flex brake concept because of its 
superior characteristics relative to tiie space based application. We recognize the torus tank concept 
is difficult to grow to a 2 engine man-rated configuration. This ground based vehicle need not be 
man-rated. Its cost advantage over the tandem tank configuration is sufficientiy important to allow 
a concept change when transitioning to manned, space based operation.

Figure 11 Recommended Concept - Cai^o Bay OTV 

The main contributor to the short length of the vehicle is the incorporation of a toroidal LO2 

tank which surrounds the main engine package. Emphasis on short length while maintaining high 
performance (maximum payload capability at minimum gross weight) is the reason for the selection 
of this concept. Stage length plus ASE should not exceed 30 ft (according to the mission model 
assessment) in order to minimize STS launch costs. In other words, 30 ft payload capability along 
with sufficient performance are the major characteristics desired from a cargo bay OTV. This stage 
meets these criteria with its 26.5 ft length and packaging characteristics with its ASE. 

Two growth concerns exist with this concept - how to install two engines for man rating, 
and how to achieve growth to the ultimate requirement of a 25,000 pound delivery. We believe the 
growth from the ACC configuration to the ultimate space based vehicle is to be preferred over 
growth from a cargo bay vehicle.

5.0 CARGO VEHICLE BASED OTV CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT 
5.1 ROLE OF REUSABILITY 

The first step in evolving the preferred cargo vehicle based OTV was to review the thought 
process that established aeroassisted-reusable as the preferred option in the STS supported use 
scenario, and and to apply it to the situation where a large unmanned cargo vehicle is available. 
Figure 12 sununarizes the trades conducted to assess the role of reuse in the large cargo vehicle era.

Figure 12 Reuse Mode Options (Cargo Vehicle, Ground Based) 

The current technology expendable family, a new all-propulsive reusable concept, and a new high 
technology expendable concept were compared with the aeroassisted reusable approach. The 
current technology expendable and all-propulsive reusable concepts were compared on the basis of 
the 160 civil GEO missions in the Scenario 2 mission model. These missions included large 
spacecraft retrieval missions, and were judged to be most representative of the traffic targeted for 
OTV. I>oD missions and non-GEO missions increase the use base of OTV, and would tend to 
make the new aeroassist technology more readily justifiable. Since the basis used supported 
aeroassist, we felt a larger mission sampling could only reinforce our conclusion. 

We also investigated the general parameters associated with development of a high 
technology expendable. Since we did not have the resources to conceive and thoroughly 



20 



investigate the high tech possibilities, we settied for establishing the cost parameters that would 
have to be achieved to make this approach a winner. 

The criteria used to discriminate between options is identified in Figure 12. Cost factors 
include front end and operational cost, as well as life cycle cost viewed in constant and discounted 
dollars. Technology and growth implications were also subjectively evaluated We feel that 
developmental concept that yields lowest cost per flight and breaks even in discounted dollars 
should be considered a highly desirable approach. 

Comparison of the three concepts identified with a two member family of aeroassisted 
vehicles shows the following; (1) The current technology upper stages, while saving 
approximately $1B in development cost, require that 292 stages be built and expended, require that 
130 more flights be manifested on a launch vehicle, and lose in life cycle cost by $13.8B in 
constant year dollars ($L7b in 10% discounted dollars); (2) The all propulsive approach, while 
saving approximately $0.2B in development cost, costs $24M more per flight to operate, and loses 
in life cycle cost by $2.2B in constant year dollars, ($0.2B in 10% discounted dollars); (3) The 
high tech expendable approach has to achieve a build cost of $32M per article to be competitive. 
This comparison was based on weights associated with light weight design techniques. Should 
lightweight design be sacrificed for low cost design, this target cost would grow rapidly because of 
increased propellant logistics requirements. Two ways this goal could be achieved are: Through a 
strong learning curve developed over a 15 year buy; And through an as yet unidentified technical 
breakthrough in design or manufacture. It is not clear that either possibility can be achieved. 

The aeroassisted reusable approach is to be preferred over expendable and all-propulsive 
reusable operational modes in the cargo vehicle era as well as it was in the STS era. We feel there 
is limited potential for a cost competitive high-tech expendable approach to be achieved. As a 
consequence, aeroassist research technology should be pursued vigorously. Generic R&T in low 
cost expendable upper stage technology should be avoided. Response to good original ideas that 
have potential of reaching the cost improvement criteria identified would be, of course,appropriate. 
The possibility of multi-year contracting for expendable vehicles should be explored. Success in 
these areas could impact our preference for reusable vehicles. 

52 SCENARIO 2 VEHICLE SELECTION 

One of the main changes in the program scenario to be considered in this extension study is 
the possibility of using a large cargo vehicle on an operational cost basis - the development is sunk 
cost on the part of other users. The series of trade studies summarized here developed a definition 
of the preferred configuration of an OTV designed for use in conjunction with the large cargo 
vehicle. The key questions to be answered are: What diameter; How many engines; And what 

21 



array of vehicles in an OTV fleet The possibilities are sketched in Figure 13. The key 
discriminating factors are summarized. We found that, for the payloads and cargo bays defined, 
stage length remains a concern for ground based vehicles. The number of engines selected depends 
on reliability and spares concerns. We found three in line engines attractive because they afforded a 
one engine out capability that did not require large engine gimbal angles and increased stage length. 
The number of members in the vehicle family is a concern that is established by the bottom line - 
the various segments of cost

The summary results of our cargo vehicle trades are shown in Figure 14. The details 
backing up this summary arc included in Volume EX. The engine trade results are tabulated This 
cost analysis includes engine spare requirements, manifested launch cost, and mission loss cost. 
The dominant goals are to keep the configuration short, and to keep the configuration reliable. The 
best net situation is 3 engines for a cargo vehicle concept. 2 engines remains the preferred space 
based concept, but the best evolutionary concept appears to stay with 3 engines in the era where a 
no-DDT&E cargo vehicle exists. 

The bar charts in Figure 14 show life cycle cost in 1985 and discounted dollars for 
configurations with 15 foot and large cargo vehicle diameters. The problem with 15 feet is that the 
configurations are long. The problem with cargo bay diameters is returning the whole vehicle in 
the ground based mode if it has to come back in the STS cargo bay. These data indicate that it is

preferable to disassemble tankage and throw it away if it won't jfit in the STS bay rather than use a 
long configuration. It is doubtful that a no-DDT&E large return cargo capacity would be better if 
its recurring cost is the projected $15M/flight These analyses are based on the concept that down 
rides on the STS are readily available and that the only transportation charges are an up charge for 
ASE and on-orbit operations charge for disassembly and stowage. 

The final trade data in Figure 14 shows that for 160 GEO missions, the basis used for most 
of our space basing estimates, a two vehicle family is prefenred. We elected to go with the 74/52 
family rather than the 74/50 family because there is virtually no cost discriminator, and fewer stages 
in the inventory results in a simpler operation. 

The L/D selected for the OTV aeroassist device has a significant impact on OTV weight, 
performance and cost effectiveness. We extended our research into the selection of the optimum 
L/D for the OTV, and have succeeded in validating our recommendation of an L/D of 0. 12. The 
minimum requirement of L/D is to provide maneuver capability adequate to control aeroassist 
maneuver exit apogee accurately in the face of expected navigation tolerances and variations in 
upper atmosphere density. An additional consideration exists -- the possibility that proper use of a 
higher L/D could ease aerobrake design requirements in aerodynamic heating and deceleration 
g-level, and result in a lower weight These possibilities were investigated. In prior study phases, 



23 



it was established that energy savings resulting from performing a part of the geostationary return 
plane change is not beneficial, so this possibility was not investigated further. 

We have run a large number of control authority test cases using a four degree of freedom 
simulation of our lifting aerobrake control scheme. Aeromaneuver passes through fourteen STS 
measured atmospheres, incorporating various entry dispersions generated by guidance and 
navigation errors, were simulated for various candidate aerobrakes. The table on the left of 
Figurel5 sununarizes some of the results. Excellent apogee altitude control is exhibited by L/D 
down to 0,08 — 0.06 is beginning to become inadequate. As a result of these studies and 
companion studies by NASA and other contractors, we feel confident that an L/D of 0. 12 is 
adequate to control the aeropass maneuver. 

Although L/D = 0.12 is adequate for control purposes, we also investigated whether a higher 
L/D of 0.30 could result in a lighter brake due to an alleviated heating or loading environment The 
upper table on the right side of Figure 15 compares the JSC rigid brake flown at various altitudes 
in the control corridor. When flown as high in the coiridor as control requirements permit, the 
column labeled 0.3(-!-), heating rate was reduced, total heat was increased, and peak g-load was 
reduced. When flown low in the corridor, the colunm labeled 0.3(-), the opposite changes were 
observed. Tile weight increases as aeromaneuver altitude is lowered, since the impact of total heat

on insulation requirements is dominant. Structural weight increases as aeromaneuver altitude is 
decreased, due to the increasing g-loading. Our data shows a weight optimum very near the center 
of the corridor - there appears to be no weight benefit from increased L/D. In the case of the flex 
brake, as shown in the table in the lower right of Figure 15, the dominant factor is the increased 
diameter of the aeroshield that results from the wake impingement issue on our relatively long 
"thrust axis parallel to the aerodynamic axis'* configuration. Again the clearly superior approach, 
by a larger margin, is the lowest L/D acceptable from the control point of view. 

We reconmiend incorporating an aeroassist device into the OTV that has a 0. 12 L/D. This 
selection will provide adequate aeromaneuver control, results in a less severe total heating 
environment, and yields a lighter aerobrake design. The possible adverse consequence of this 
approach is that it provides less margin for possible growth in atmospheric uncertainty and 
guidance and navigation dispersions. It is our opinion that these parameters will be well 
understood before the design is conrmiitted to hardware, and if an increase becomes warranted, it 
should be incorporated at the time it is confirmed. The principal sensitivity issue is as follows. 
There are, at this point, uncertainties in the aerothermal environment that will become better 
understood after the aeroassist flight experiment is flown, and still better understood as operational 
flight experience is gained. The first flight aerobrake will be flown with conservatisms in design 
that win protect against these 

uncertainties - for example larger diameters and thicker insulation. Our data indicates that the low 
L/D design will show a smaller weight penalty to accommodate these uncertainties than will the 
higher L/D design. From this point of view, the low L/D design is to be preferred. 

The conceptual design of the OTVs selected for use in conjunction with the cargo vehicle is 
illustrated in Figure 16. The smaller unmanned vehicle has a 52,000 propellant capacity. 
Cylindrical propellant tanks with square-root-of-two domes were selected to fit into the 25 foot 
diameter of the nominal cargo vehicle payload shroud A larger cargo diameter, sufficient to 
support spherical tanks, would be beneficial due to the resulting lower tank gauges. The forward 
ends of the LH2 tanks (not shown) and LO2 tanks are placed at the same station. The tank 

diameters are selected so the three in line engines can be mounted between the LO2 tank bottoms 

and the heat shield when the nozzles are retracted, while the LH2 tanks extend as closely as 

possible to the aerobrake. The central core, including the center section of the aerobrake, is 14.5 
feet in diameter, so it can be returned to earth in the 15 foot diameter STS cargo bay. The same 
materials as were used in the 1984/85 study configurations were selected. Aluminum lithium 
tanks, graphite epoxy cool structure and graphite polyimide hot structure was used. The 32 foot 
diameter aerobrake uses shuttie tiles for its 14,5 foot diameter center section and engine doors, 
while the outer flexible section is the Nicalon, Q-felt and RTV sealed NEXTEL blanket Propellant

tanks are expended or retrieved on a Shuttle space available basis. Avionics are packaged on the 
structural bulkheads at the forward end of the vehicle. Trusswork provides the central structural 
core. This configuration is only 19.7 feet long, and manifests efficiently with payloads.

Figure 16 Cargo Vehicle OTV Recommendation 

The propellant capacity of the large man rated configuration is increased to 74,000 pounds to 
enable performance of the 12,000 pounds up, 10,000 pounds down Manned Geo Sortie and GEO 
Shack Logistics missions. This increased size is achieved by stretching the propellant tanks at the 
same diameter. The longer stage and spacecraft retrieval combine to require use of a 38 foot 
diameter aerobrake. Total stage length increases to 25.5 feet Otherwise, the configuration is 
essentially similar to the smaller unmanned vehicle. This stage can be extended to space based 
service by deleting the SOFI insulation on the hydrogen tanks and adding more MLI, adding 
meteoroid protection, and adding engine quick disconnects and other space base servicing aids. 



26 



The pertinent sensitivities associated with these vehicles are indicated. If down space were 
not readily available as assumed, the cost of ground basing these configurations would escalate - 
making space basing more attractive. As previously noted, a cargo bay large enough to 
accommodate spherical tanks would make the vehicle lighter and result in lower transportation 
charges to perform the mission model. 

5 J ALTERNATIVE VEHICLE ANALYSES 

We tested the possibility that some of the mission scenarios could justify additional members 
to the OTV family just identified. Our initial thought was that the SDI mission in Scenario 4 might 
justify a storable propellant selection, since the mission velocity requirements were so low. As it 
turned out, the mission weights were so high the higher I~ continued to be preferred. We did 

investigate a smaller, 40,000 pound propellant capacity stage that could be used to perform the 
indicated mission array instead of the 52,000 pound stage already in the fanuly. We found that a 
crossover of 420 missions would justify the additional DDT&E. Therefore, Scenario 4 (SDI 
missions) or Scenario 5 (Nuclear Waste) in conjunction with the smaller missions in the model 
could justify development of the additional stage size. 

We also investigated the use of a large, 240,000 pound propellant capacity stage to perform 
the very large missions in Scenario 5, rather than segmenting the large GEO nussion and 
performing the large lunar and planetary nussions with multi-stage, propellant module approaches 
contrived from the stage elements akeady identified We found that the development of a very large 
stage was not justified. 

5.4 OPERATIONS ALTERNATIVES 

The degree to which EVA operations wUl figiu-e in OTV space basing operations and the 
most effective means for performing OTV flight operations in proximity to the Space Station are 
two of the more significant operations issues examined during tiiis extension study. The EVA 
versus IVA issue bears on the balance between space station crew utilization and the cost of 
software and equipment that would allow space based OTV operations to be conducted with a 
minimum of participation on the part of the limited space station crew. The candidates investigated 
include the spectrum from primarily EVA activity to remote manipulation with an IVA operator to 
automated operation with only manned supervision. EVA operation normally requires two EVA 
crewmen and an IVA operator at all times when there is a crewman outside. Remote manipulation 
involves one fuUtime crewman. Automated operation supervision would allow an operator to 
manage more than one task simultaneously. There is a clear trade between development cost, 
operational cost and crew dedication. 

27 



We also investigated flight operations that must be conducted in close proximity to the space 
station. The candidates investigated were: (1) Adding OTV systems that would enable 'driving' up 
to space station docking with the OTV; (2) Adding limited systems to both OTV and OMV that 
would enable them to act as a total unit capable of achieving a space station docking approach; And 
(3) A technique involving separating OTV and any returning payload so the OMV could dock to the 
OTV payload interface, or to the separated payload at the OTV interface, and perform separate 
docking approaches to the space station totally under control of the OMV. The criteria forjudging 
these approaches include vehicle complexity, operations complexity, and cost considerations. 

Figure 17 illustrates the trade between operational and developmental costs that exists as the 
OTV maintenance concept shifts from EVA towards continually more automated operations. This 
comparison is based on our experience that was gained from IR&D and contract activities involving 
our Space Operations Simulation and Artificial Intelligence laboratories. It is clear that a cost 
optimum exists where no EVA is involved in normal operations. The appropriate degree of 
automation will probably fall short of only supervisory control. In addition to this cost oriented 
comparison, we laid out objective and subjective comparisons of the operational attributes of the 
various approaches and scored them. The scoring results indicated that a proper balance would 
probably lie on the fully automated side of IV A/Remote operations, rather than the EVA side.

Figure 17 Operations Evaluation

In the proximity operations arena, we identified the changes that would have to be made to 
baseline OTV and OMV designs to accommodate the three major proximity operations candidates 
identified. Only in the third case shown in Figure 17 were no system changes required. This 
approach does involve more operations and more operations cost than the other two. We, 
representing the OTV interest, would prefer this option because it involves no developmental 
impact on the OTV program. The best approach requires participation of all involved parties: OTV; 
OMV; and Space Station. 

We recommend that no EVA activity be included in normal OTV operations at the space base 
for the reasons cited, although EVA contingency backup of all operations is necessary. Initial 
capability probably should include less automation than the ultimate system, to minimize the cost 
and risk involved with getting started. 

The OTV program would benefit from conducting all operations in proximity to the space 
station with the OMV, but this may not be the overall best approach. We recommend that an OTV / 
OMV / Space Station working group be constituted to evolve the overall best approach to proximity 
operations.

6.0 SPACE BASED VS GROUND BASED TRADE 

We clearly established that space basing OTV is the prefeired operational concept in the STS 
supported scenario studied last year. We have revisited this issue in the large cargo vehicle 
supported scenario being investigated in this extension study. A comparative evaluation was 
conducted on the basis of the 160 civil GEO missions in the Scenario 2 mission model. 

In the ground based scenario, all missions were launched on a large cargo vehicle, one 
mission per flight, with launch charge based on the STS charge algorithm (3/4 length or weight 
load factor results in a full launch cost charge). This ground based scenario reflected our 25 foot 
diameter OTV for ascent, and a down volume restricted to the 15 X 60 foot orbiter bay. Any 
tankage that could not be packaged for retrieval in this volume was discarded, and added to the 
build cost for the next flight One retrieval per STS flight was assumed, with the only retrieval 
charge being for any retrieval ASE required. 

In the space based scenario, the same 160 civil GEO missions were launched from a space 
base. The remaining missions in the Scenario 2 mission model were assumed to continue to be 
ground based. Propellant 'hitchhiking' was assumed feasible with no transportation charge to the 
OTV program for the hitchhiked propellants. Cost of the hitchhiking system, propellant tanks and 
operations, were charged to the OTV program. Space Station support to the OTV program was 
charged to OTV. OTV flight operations when away fix)m the Space Station were assumed to cost 
the same when either ground or space based. 

A full cost assessment was evolved. The major sensitivity factors investigated were launch 
vehicle cost, acconunodations acquisition cost, hitchhiking efficiency, and cargo vehicle 
replacement cost Evaluation criteria included discounted and non-discounted life cycle cost , cost 
per flight, and non-cost factors. Some of the non-cost factors that influence the desirability of 
acquiring a space based OTV capability are as follows: 

1) Launch/Transfer Coupling: Space basing decouples the launch vehicle and its associated 
prelaunch and flight operations from the equivalent operations associated with the Orbital 
Transfer Vehicle. One benefit of this decoupling is that any launch vehicle ( Shuttle, 
Titan IV, or Ariane) can provide payload transportation to LEO with OTV providing 
deployment to mission orbit This is likely to be attractive to a certain segment of customers. 
On the other hand, the time from spacecraft rollout at the factory to on orbit operation is 
likely to be longer. Some customers will prefer space basing, and some will not. 



30 



2) Mission Flexibility Impact : Space basing has an advantage because it can support buildup 
of missions that are larger than one launch vehicle can carry. This would be important in the 
early mission years if launch capability were limited to existing shuttle capability. If a large 
cargo vehicle were developed, the capability would be advantageous when the nation 
undertakes the anticipated lunar base and manned Mars initiatives. Conversely, ground 
basing has a significant performance advantage for high inclination missions that would 
require large orbital turns if launched from the currently envisioned Space Station. 

3) Frequency of Ground Launch : Higher load factors ace expected for launches supporting 
Space Station since propellant hitchhiking will fill capability remaining after 'hard* payloads 
have been manifested. Fewer launches means less contamination of the launch area 
environment from SRB and other exhaust products, as well as less possibility of a 
catastrophic failure of the launch system. This is a distinct advantage for the space based 
system. 

4) OTV Logistics : The space based system requires neither OTV transportation from ground 
to LEO nor partial OTV disassembly for return to the ground in the orbiter bay on every 
mission. However, the space based system must be maintained under what are currentiy 
unfamiliar coiiditions. The cost of maintenance operations has been estimated and reflected 
in our assessments, but there remains an element of risk in space based operation that must 
be considered in the decision process. 

5) OTV & Spacecraft Checkout : Space basing requires development of a capability to check 
out systems in the space environment Once developed, this capability enables checkout of 
both spacecraft and OTV after passage through the launch environment, which is generally 
the most severe envirorunent either will encounter. Coupled with a maintenance capability, 
this offers a potential for recovering from infant mortality, and occasionally achieving a 
significant cost benefit. 

6) Launch Cost Sensitivity : The cost of delivering 'hitchhiked' propellants to the Space 
Station is assumed to involve only the cost of the hitchhike system (tanks and operations), 
and not to involve transportation charges. This tends to decouple the cost of OTV operations 
from launch vehicle cost in the space based mode. If the launch costs escalate, the cost of 
OTV operations does not escalate in response. On the other hand, the benefit of 
breakthroughs in launch vehicle technology will not as directly influence the cost of OTV 
operation. 



31 



7) Technology Advance : Space basing potentially offers the dual advantages of enhanced 
international prestige and the synergisms that can follow the development of new 
technologies. These benefits are not readily quantifiable, but are certainly not possible 
without venturing into a new arena* Conversely, if nothing is ventured, nothing is lost 
Eliminating the new space based technology reduces cost and schedule risk for most users. 

It is clear that both operational modes have significant advantages. If a space based capability is 
developed, we do not believe it should supplant a ground based capability - it would be desirable 
for both to coexist throughout the foreseeable future. There are significant advantages to 
possessing the space based OTV launch capability that can justify the developmental investment. 



The key econonuc issues that will establish the economic feasibility of space basing OTV are: 
The cost advantage resulting from fully utilizing the large cargo vehicle lift capability by filling out 
the cargo manifest with ^hitchhiked' propellants; The cost of acquiring OTV accommodations at the 
space base; And the benefit of reducing launch vehicle use that results from the space based 
operational mode. 

We conducted an evaluation to establish what portion of OTV propellant requirements could 
likely be provided by the 'hitchhike' concept Historically, shuttie manifesting analyses have 
shown that a 75% load factor is to be expected. We applied this factor to the large cargo vehicle, 
conceived a discrete array of tankage to use the leftover lift capability, and investigated planned 
cargo vehicle and OTV flight schedules to establish the resulting 'hitchhike' capability. We found 
that 70% of the unused space could be utilized The fuel carrying capability is compared with the 
OTV requirement in Figure 18. It appears that 63% of OTV propellant requirements can be met by 
the concept Our ground rules state that there is no transportation charge for hitchhiked propellants, 
but that the system of tankage and operations is to be charged. These ground rules are reflected in 
subsequent analyses, and the quantity of propellants available has been treated parametrically.

Figure 18 Availability of Hitchhiked Propeilant 

We conducted an evaluation of the possible cost of OTV accommodations at the Space 
Station. This item is discussed in more detail in Volume DC. It is believed that the cost of initial 
space based OTV accommodations can be reduced from the $936M estimated last year to in the 
neighborhood of $41 8M by sharing the cost of accommodations with OMV, reflecting more 
reahstic software development cost, down sizing the hangar and propeilant farm, and launching 
elements with the lower cost large cargo vehicle. We also believe the space based mode should be 
given credit for a reduction in launch vehicle replacement cost resulting from fewer launch vehicle 
uses. We anticipate 52 fewer large cargo vehicle flights will be necessary to support the space 
based scenario than are required to support the ground based scenario, since the launch vehicle is 
more efficientiy manifested. The 52 flights represent 25% of the reusable booster stage's design 
lifetime, and thus a $400M prorated replacement build cost savings. 

Figure 19 shows a typical spread of space based program cost compared with ground based 
program cost. This particular set of space based data reflects: Space Station accommodations costs 
at $418M; Crediting the space based program with the booster build cost benefit associated with 
fewer large cargo vehicle launches; and 0%, 50%, and 100% of space based OTV propeilant 
requirements provided by 'hitchhiked' propellants. The associated cost per flight data is also 
tabulated. This type of data were generated for a parametric set of conditions, and used to bound 
the range of possible space based programs.

Figure 19 Typical Discounted Cost: Ground Based vs Space Based 

Figure 20 summarizes the effects of several parameters influencing the economic viability of 
space based OTV operations. The cost of a large cargo vehicle flight is fixed at $70M for this 
figure, and the data reflects conducting the 160 civil GEO missions in the Scenario 2 mission model 
from the space base. Conducting more missions from the space base would provide more cost 
benefit. The data is shown on carpet plots that depict the life cycle savings (or loss) associated with 
conducting the 160 missions from the space base as opposed to conducting them with a purely 
ground based program. The two caipets to the left depict the cost picture in constant dollars, the 
two to the right reflect discounted dollars. Each carpet depicts variation of two space basing cost 
parameters: Space base OTV accommodations acquisition cost; And the percent of OTV propellant 
requirements that are provided by Tiitchhiked' propellants. Maximum hitchhiked propellants and 
lowest accommodations acquisition cost yields the highest cost advantage for space basing. The 
upper carpet in each pair summarizes the GB/SB cost comparison with the launch vehicle build 
benefit, the lower shows the same comparison witiiout this launch vehicle benefit The position 
where we feel the program stands is indicated with the circled data point.

Figure 20 Space Basing Cost Sensitivity 

It is clear that it is far more difficult to achieve economical space based operations on a 
discounted cost basis than it is with constant dollars. We believe the space based program will save 
$1B over the 160 flights in constant dollars, while the equivalent circumstances will show no net 
difference in discounted dollars. In all cases, operations costs will be reduced, once the 
development cost has been written off. 

We recommend developing a space based OTV launch capability. It is difficult to show a 
cost savings for space basing on a discounted cost basis. Consequendy, it is important to keep 
initial acquisition cost as low as possible, and to maximize the efficiency of the 'hitchhiked' 
propellant concept Once the capability is acquired, operational cost is reduced, and other 
operational benefits become available. We believe the capability is important for the nation, and 
that it is worth the investment

7.0 CARGO VEHICLE BASED OTV PROGRAM 



7.1 BASELINE PROGRAM DESCRIPTION 



We have concluded that the preferred Orbital Transfer Vehicle program in the era where a 
large cargo vehicle is available and Scenario 2 missions are to be performed will be as summarized 
in Figure 2 1 . It will comprise two types of orbital transfer vehicles. A three in-line engine, four 
side-by side tank, unmanned, ground based vehicle with a 52,000 pound propellant capacity will 
support initial missions. This vehicle will be used throughout the operational period. A generally 
similar manned, space based vehicle with a 74,000 pound propellant capacity will be made 
operational as soon as it can be supported by the Space Station. All manned missions will be 
launched from a space base, but the space based vehicle can be launched from the ground as well. 
Its initial mission will be ground based - returning to residence at the Space Station upon return.

program ATP in January, 1990 (Figure 24) supports an Initial Operational Capability in January 
1996. It is currently anticipated that this is the earliest space based operational capability that can be 
supported, and that an initial capability near the turn of the century would be more likely to occur.

12 PROGRAM SENSITIVITIES 

The major characteristics of the five mission scenarios investigated are shown in Figure 25. 
Scenario 1 does not present a driver for space basing, particularly because it contains no manned 
GEO missions. Scenario 2 justifies the nominal OTV program just discussed. Scenario 3 requires 
nothing different from the OTV program, assimiing that the limited SDI mission activity is not 
multiple-launched on OTVs. Scenario 4 justifies a specialized OTV directed at the low 
mid-inclination and other DoD traffic. Scenario 5 justifies a specialized nuclear waste OTV which 
has a strong possibility of being able to perform selected DoD missions more effectively as well. 
This scenario also requires build-up of multi-stage OTVs at the space base and requires that more 
OTVs be resident in space.

Figure 25 Mission Model Impact On OTV Program 



The major characteristics of the five launch scenarios investigated are shown in Figure 26. It 
is uncertain how much STS growth can be expected If the OTV program is limited to the use of a 
shutde with a 65,000 pound (or less) payload capability, many of the early missions in all the 
models will involve multiple launches with attendant operational problems. In this scenario, space 
basing has even more virtue than in the cargo vehicle supported era we concentrated on in this 
extension study. The large cargo vehicle without retrieval capability results in the recommended 
OTV program previously discussed The preferred OTV configuration for this case has been 
shown to be the wide body configuration. This approach leads to the operational complexities cited 

39 



in the ground based case. We would, of course prefer the wide-body retrieval capability if only its 
operational cost is involved. The justification of the development cost of this capability is beyond 
the scope of this OTV study. Propellant hitchhiking and scavenging are the economic savior of the 
space based OTV concept This justification is real, but will likely prove upsetting to the users that 
are paying the launch bill. They would likely prefer to share in the cost benefit. The impact of STS 
n on OTV program selection appears to be minimal.

Figure 26 Launch Vehicle Impact On OTV Program 



Four possible space basing scenarios are identified in the Figure 27, With no space based 
support, missions that cannot be launched from the ground on a single flight require complex 
Orbiter support operations. For example, launching a manned GEO mission would require two 
current capability Orbiter launches on one week centers with Orbiter supported on-orbit mission 
assembly. With a 65,000 pound capability STS, the occurrence of this problem is frequent. With 
a large cargo vehicle, the problem will eventually occur. Space tending with the Space Station 
would ease this problem, but the timing would still be constrained unless the ability to top 
propellants were provided as a part of die space tending package. This approach does not enable 
acquiring tiie potential benefit of the hitchhiked propellant concept. The nominal space based 
approach achieves all the operational benefits previously discussed, and mitigates the cost of this 
capabUity witii the benefit of hitchhiked propellants. If space station were delayed until the manned 
missions are scheduled, the impact would be: The large early missions would require either 
complex ground based operations or more pay load segmentation; And the operational base that is 
required to pay off developmental cost would be beyond the horizon of this study.

Figure 27 Space Basing Impact On OTV Program 

Development of the reusable OTV is economically justified, even in the most modest 
projected mission scenarios. We believe that, even though it is difficult to justify on a discounted 
life cycle cost basis, the lower operational cost of space based OTV missions and the ancillary 
operational benefits justify investment in space basing. Further Phase A effort should be directed at 
identifying an initial OTV that will be useful whether or not a large cargo vehicle program is 
initiated in the near future, and one that has a good growth path to space based capability. We 
believe the key to meeting this objective is to develop a concept that can fly in an Aft Cargo Carrier 
or a large cargo vehicle with minimal design penalty. After this concept is delineated, an extended 
Phase B should optimize the concept, and a full scale development directed at achieving a mid 90's 
initial operational capability should be undertaken.
