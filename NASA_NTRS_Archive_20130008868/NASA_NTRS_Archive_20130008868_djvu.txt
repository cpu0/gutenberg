I am finishing up my internship with the Application & Simulation group at NASA Kennedy Space 


Center (KSC). During this internship I was working with the Plant Habitat development team. The Plant 
Habitat provides a large enclosed, environmentally controlled chamber designed to support commercial 
and fundamental plant research onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The work that I did was 
for the prototype of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) display. This display is used by the scientists to 
monitor the system health, start new experiment configurations, and get real-time information about 
the experiment as its being run. This display is developed using the Qt Framework Integrated 
Development Environment (IDE) and the programming language C++. 

The display prototype was originally started by the intern that preceded me. He created a 
dummy display that conformed to the ISS display standards. My goal was to create a backend system 
that would translate data coming down from the ISS using a piece of software called the Telescience 
Resource Kit (TReK) and pass it to the front end of the GUI using TCP/IP. (See Figure 1)

The first step in this process was to learn more about the Qt Framework. As I have never had to 


use this set of tools before I needed to dig into how it worked. I was able to use Amazon Kindle along 
with Books 24x7 to find material that allowed me to learn how to use the framework. My next step was 
to focus specifically on the TCP/IP connections. Qt Framework has a couple of libraries specifically for 
that function called QtNetwork and QtSocket. Using these two libraries I was able to open a socket 
between the Backend and the Frontend and transmit a continuous stream of packets that randomly 
changed the data within the GUI. (See Figure 2)

My final step was to create a dialog that allowed the user to command the Temp Set Point to a 
specific value. When a user inputs a correct value (incorrect values are restricted by the Qt Framework) 


the value is sent to the server and the GUI is updated to reflect that change. (See Figure 3 and Figure 4)

This was as far as I was able to go with this specific project as there were a few unanswered 
questions that needed to be resolved by the project's team before this prototype could be developed 
further. These questions included: 


1. What is the packet definition (the specific order the measurements and values will be received 
in) for the information coming down from the ISS? 

2. Have the future developers used a different set of tools for module development in the past 
that would work better? 


Besides the GUI that I was developing I had a few other side tasks that I worked on. I helped review 
the Software Requirements Specification (SRR) and the Software Design Document (SDD). I attended 
multiple meetings during the internship ranging from software development meetings to avionics 



meetings. I also participated in display development for the Launch Control System (LCS) for the Space 


Launch System. These displays will be used to replace the ground control and monitoring displays that 
were used during the Space Shuttle program. 

I also was able to participate in many different learning opportunities. I was able to tour many of 
the facilities used here at KSC and how they are being refitted and changed for the next generation of 
space vehicles. Another learning activity that I was able to participate in were brown bag lunches, where 
different project leaders at KSC came in and talked to the Interns about what they were doing. Also I 
participated in multiple retirement activities for Discovery and Atlantis. 

This internship opportunity overall was a huge learning experience. I was able to put to use the 
skills I learned at school along with learning new skills on the job. I got the chance to tour some amazing 
facilities that I never thought I would have the chance to see. This was a great once in a lifetime 


opportunity.
