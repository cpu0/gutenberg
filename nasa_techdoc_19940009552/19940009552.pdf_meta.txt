x-archive-meta-description: During the contract period, work concentrated on four main components. Data from the UAH silver pin hole camera was analyzed for determination of the mean Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) satellite attitude and stability in orbit, to include pitch and yaw. Chemical testing performed on the AO-114 hot plate determined the form and locus of absorption of cosmogenic beryllium-7. Reaction rates of atomic oxygen with Kapton and other polymeric solids integrated over the whole LDEF orbital lifetime were analyzed. These rates were compared with the JSC estimated values for Space Station exposures. Metal and polymer films exposed on A0114 (C-9 and C-3 plates) were also analyzed.
