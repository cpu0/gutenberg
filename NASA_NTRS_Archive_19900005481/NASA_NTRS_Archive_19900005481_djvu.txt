REUSE RESEARCH PLANS AT LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER 

Susan Voigt and Carrie Walker 
NASA Langley Research Center 


The reuse activities at Langley have centered on the development of the Eli system by SPS, as 
already described. The development of a computer systems design environment at Langley 
was described as a target application for the future Eli system. This environment combines 
software development tools with an architecture design and analysis tool. Specifically, a 
Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) system, under development at Charles Stark 
Draper Laboratory for Langley, is being used to generate Ada code for use in architecture 
functional simulations using the Architecture Design and Assessment System (ADAS). The Eli 
system will be included in this tool set and will be used to organize and promote reuse of the 
functional simulation code modules.
