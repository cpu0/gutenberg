15. COMPUTER PRODUCT ABSTRACT 

The Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC) is a suite of tests 
designed to determine an Ada compiler's conformance to MIL-STD-1815A, 
•^he Ada Language Reference Manual (LRM). Version 1.9 was released 
in December 1986 and became the official ACVC version, replacing 
1.8, in June 1987. ACVC version 1.9 will be the official version until 
June 1988 when it will be replace by ACVC version 1.10. 

Each of the 3122 tests in the ACVC 1.9 is designed to test 
a single test objective specified in the Ada Implementor's Guide 
(AIG), a document enumerating the LRM into discrete test objectives 
in order to aid compiler development... Software Description: The 
model is written in the ADA programming language for implementa¬ 
tion on a DEC VAX-11/780 Computer using the VMS operating system. 
Memory requirement is, .-3P— .K bytes.
