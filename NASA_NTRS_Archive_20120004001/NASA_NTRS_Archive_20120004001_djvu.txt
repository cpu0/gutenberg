Since its inception almost 8 years ago, NASA’s Short-term Prediction Research and 
Transition (SPoRT) Center has integrated NASA data into the National Weather 
Service’s decision support system (DSS) - the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing 
System (AWIPS). SPoRT has, in some instances, had to shape and transform data sets 
into various formats and manipulate configurations to visualize them in AWIPS. With the 
advent of the next generation of DSS, AWIPS II, developers will be able to develop their 
own plugins - to handle any type of data. Raytheon is developing AWIPS II to be a more 
extensible package written mainly in Java, and built around a Service Oriented 
Architecture. A plugin architecture will allow users to install their own code modules, 
and (if all the rules have been properly followed) they will work hand-in-hand with 
AWIPS II as if it were originally built in. Users can bring in new datasets with existing 
plugins, tweak plugins to handle a nuance or desired new functionality, or create an 
entirely new visualization layout for a new dataset. SPoRT is developing plugins to 
ensure its existing NASA data will be ready for AWIPS II when it is delivered, and to 
prepare for the future of new instruments on upcoming satellites.
