Abstract 

Some observations suggest that the volcanic aerosols produced by the Mt. Pinatubo eruption 
may have altered cirrus properties. We look for evidence that such modification of cirrus is 
extensive enough to be climatically significant by comparing three satellite-based cirrus datasets 
produced by the ISCCP analysis, the "split-window" analysis, and 31 analysis. Since the former 
two have not been compared in detail before, we conduct such a comparison here. When applied 
to AVHRR data, both the ISCCP and split-window analyses identify about 0.2 - 0.3 cirrus cloud 
amount in tropical latitudes; however, there are detailed differences of classification for about 
half of these clouds. The discrepancies are attributed to the simplified assumptions made by both 
methods. The latter two datasets are derived from infrared radiances, so they are much less 
sensitive to volcanic aerosols than the ISCCP analysis. After the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, the 
ISCCP resuhs indicate a dramatic decrease of thin cirrus (cloud top pressure < 440 mb and visible 
optical thickness < 1.3) over ocean, accompanied by a comparable increase of altocumulus and 
cumulus clouds; over land, there are no significant changes. In contrast, results from the split- 
window and 31 analyses show little change in thin cirrus amount over either ocean or land that is 
associated with the volcanic eruption. The ISCCP results can, therefore, be understood as a 
misclassification of thin cirrus because the additional reflected sunlight by the volcanic aerosol 
makes the cirrus clouds appear to be optically thicker. Examination of the split-window signature 
and the infrared emissivities from 31 show no significant change in infrared emissivity (or optical 
thickness). These results indicate that the Mt. Pinatubo volcanic aerosol did not have a significant 
systematic effect on tropical cirrus properties, but rather produced only temporary, local effects. 
Hence, these results indicate that there was no significant climate feedback produced by aerosol- 
cirrus-radiative interactions. 



1. Introduction 

Cirrus clouds are high-level (upper troposphere), optically thin, ice clouds with both 
low solar reflectivities and low emissivities (Liou 1986). Globally, they cover around 
20% of the earth's surface (Rossow and Schiffer 1999), but there may be another 5 - 
10% of very thin cirrus present (Jin et al. 1996; Liao et al. 1995; Stubenrauch et al. 
1999a). Unlike most other clouds, cirrus with cloud tops higher than the effective 
emission level of the clear atmosphere cause net radiative heating of the earth-atmosphere 
system because they reflect sunlight less than they decrease the outgoing longwave 
radiation. This warming effect is reversed as cirrus cloud optical thickness increases 
(Stephen et al. 1990). Through their radiative effects cirrus clouds modulate the general 
circulation of the atmosphere (Randall et al. 1989; Ramanathan et al. 1983). 

There are many ways to observe cirrus properties and behavior; however, only 
satellites provide the global overview of cloud systems at the scale of the synoptic 
weather systems in which they form (Rossow 1989). The past two decades have 
witnessed numerous studies of cirrus clouds using satellite instruments. Inoue (1985) 
showed the feasibility of cirrus detection using the "split-window" data (wavelengths 
around 1 1 ^m and 12 urn) of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) 
on board NOAA-7 and derived the temperature and the emissivity of cirrus clouds. 
Furthermore, based on a threshold technique in two-dimensional brightness temperature 
histograms, he developed a method that could be used to identify several types of clouds 
(Inoue 1987). ISCCP was established in 1982 to produce a globally uniform satellite 
cloud climatology (Schiffer and Rossow 1983; Rossow and Schiffer 1991). In the 
second version of the cloud product, sensitivity to cirrus is increased and biases in cirrus 



cloud optical thickness and cloud top temperature are reduced (Rossow and Schiffer 
1999). Wylie et al. (1994) applied the CO2 slicing technique, which makes use of 
infrared radiances at wavelengths from 13 to 15 ^im from the High Resolution Infrared 
Sounder (HIRS) data from NOAA polar-orbiting satellites, to derive four years of high 
cloud climatology. Their new study extends the climatology to eight years (Wylie and 
Menzel 1999). More recently, Stubenrauch et al. (1999 b) developed a new improved 
initialization inversion (31) algorithm and used it to convert TIROS-N Operational 
Vertical Sounder (TOVS) observations from NOAA polar-orbiting environmental 
satellites into atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles, as well as cloud and 
svirface properties. Cirrus clouds are separated from high opaque clouds by their lower 
emissivities. 

Volcanic activities may alter cirrus properties. Jensen and Toon (1992) suggested the 
potential effect of volcanic aerosols on cirrus cloud microphysics using simulations, 
while Sassen et al. (1992, 1995) proposed a volcano-cirrus-climate feedback mechanism 
based on analysis of data from the First ISCCP Regional Experiment (FIRE). Moreover, 
Song et al. (1996) examined the interannual variability of high-level cloudiness (HC) 
index and foimd a widespread increase of the HC index up to 0.1 after major volcanoes. 
However, ISCCP results suggest that the production of large amount of stratospheric 
aerosol by Mt. Pinatubo is associated with a decrease in cirrus cloud amount by 0.02 - 
0.04 and an increase in their average optical thickness (Rossow and Schiffer 1999). How 
exactly did Mt. Pinatubo volcano affect cirrus properties? We explore this question by 
comparing the ISCCP products with two other cloud datasets derived from the "split- 
window" method and 31 cloud algorithm (Stubenrauch et al. 1999b). 



In the first half of the paper, we report a systematic comparison between cirrus 
retrieved by ISCCP and the split-window method. This comparison study serves as a 
preparation for the second half of the paper, which addresses how Mt. Pinatubo eruption 
affected cirrus properties. First, a radiative transfer model is used to analyze the two 
algorithms, because the split-window method is based on the identification of clusters in 
multidimensional radiance space, while the ISCCP cloud scheme relies on a radiative 
transfer model to retrieve cloud properties. Second, retrieved cloud information is 
compared in light of the model simulation results. Cirrus from the 31 cloud dataset have 
been compared to those from ISCCP by Stubenrauch et al. (1999a). 

In the second half of the paper, we make use of the different sensitivities of the three 
cloud retrieval algorithms to explore the influence of the Mt. Pinatubo volcano on cirrus 
properties. One major difference between the split-window method, 31 cloud algorithm, 
and the ISCCP cloud scheme is that the former two use radiances at infrared 
wavelengths, while the latter utilizes one infrared and one visible radiance. Since 
absorption in the infrared is less sensitive to aerosols than reflection in the visible, the 
split-window method and 31 cloud algorithm do a better job of monitoring thin cirrus 
even when stratospheric aerosol concentration is relatively high, such as after a large 
volcanic eruption. The ISCCP cloud scheme, which depends on visible reflectance to 
derive cloud optical thickness, could attribute the additional visible reflectance caused by 
aerosols to clouds, thus introducing errors in the cloud retrieval (Rossow and Schiffer 
1999). Hence, there may be artifacts in the changes of ISCCP retrieved cirrus after Mt. 
Pinatubo volcano, whereas cirrus retrieved by the split-window method and 31 cloud 
algorithm are less likely to be affected by the event. 



This paper is divided into five sections. Section 2 gives a short description of the 
datasets and cloud retrieval techniques used in the study. Section 3 presents a 
comparison of the split-window and ISCCP cloud algorithms, using both simulations and 
observations. In section 4, cloud datasets from ISCCP, split-window method, and 31 are 
examined to find out the influence of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption on cirrus properties. 
Section 5 summarizes the main findings. 



2. Data and Analysis Methodologies 

a. A VHRR datasets and split-window method 

Channel 4 (~ 1 1 |jm) and channel 5 (~ 12 jim) data from AVHRR on NOAA-7 were 
used by Inoue (1987; 1989) to implement his "split-window" method. In this paper, we 
continue to use AVHRR data (sampled and saved in ISCCP DX products) from NOAA- 
1 1 for the period from January 1989 to December 1993, covering both the pre- and post- 
eruption period (Mt. Pinatubo volcano erupted in June 1991). AVHRR also has two solar 
channels (wavelengths of 0.6 \im and 0.7 \im, respectively) and one near infrared channel 
(wavelength of 3.7 |xm). The spatial resolution of the global AVHRR product is 4.0 km 
and the imaging fi-equency is twice daily at lower latitudes. To save data volume, the 
ISCCP data is spatially sampled to intervals of approximately 30 km (Schiffer and 
Rossow 1985). 

Inoue (1985) has shown that cirrus clouds can be identified by inspection of the 
images constructed from the brightness temperature difference (BTD) measured at 1 1 (im 



and 12 ^m. In his following papers, Inoue proposed an objective cloud type 
classification method based on a threshold technique in a two-dimensional histogram 
(Inoue 1987; 1989). Following Inoue (1989), we call this method the split-window 
method, in which cloud types are classified by the brightness temperature (TBB) at 1 1 
|im and the BTD (1 1 |im minus 12 |xm) as in Figure la. TBB is used to separate high- 
level clouds from low-level clouds, while BTD is a good indicator for distinguishing 
between optically thick and optically thin clouds. In this paper, we modify the original 
classification thresholds of the split-vdndow method in such a way as to facilitate the 
comparison with ISCCP data and to take advantage of more information. For example, 
cloudy or clear in the new version of the split-window method is decided based on the 
ISCCP cloud/clear decision. Accordingly, the clear BTD is calculated wherever ISCCP 
sees clear conditions. This is justified because our main interest is in the comparison of 
cirrus retrieved by the two cloud schemes and also because the original split-wdndow 
method utilizes a much simpler threshold test to separate cloudy scenes from clear ones 
than does ISCCP. Another main modification is that the threshold for high-level clouds 
is changed from a constant TBB (-20 °C in Figure la) to a variable TBB corresponding to 
a constant cloud top pressure, namely 440 mb (the average temperature at this level in the 
tropics and mid-latitudes ranges from about -1 5*^C to -25°C). This is consistent with the 
cloud classification in the ISCCP cloud scheme (see section 2b). The modified version 
of cloud classification of the split-window method is shown in Figure lb. 

b. ISCCP method 

ISCCP collects and analyzes infi-ared (~ 1 1 |xm) and visible (~ 0.6 ^m) radiances 
measured by the imaging instruments on all the operational weather satellites. In this 



paper, we only consider the results from NOAA-11 AVHRR. ISCCP cloud analysis 
procedure consists of three principal steps: cloud detection, radiative model analysis, and 
statistical analysis (Rossow and Schiffer 1991). Cloud detection is achieved in two 
passes through the whole dataset (Rossow and Garder 1993). First, a series of spatial and 
temporal tests are performed to estimate clear values of visible and infrared radiances for 
each field-of-view (FOV); second, the whole radiance dataset is examined again and each 
radiance is compared with the corresponding clear value. If either the infrared radiance is 
smaller than the clear value by more than some threshold amount or the visible radiance 
is larger than the clear value by more than some threshold amount, the pixel is labeled 
cloudy. After pixels are classified as clear and cloudy, the measured radiances are 
compared to radiative transfer model calculations to retrieve cloud top temperature (Tc) 
and visible optical thickness (Tau) for cloudy pixels, and surface reflectance and surface 
temperature for clear pixels. Clouds are represented in the radiative model as a single, 
thin layer, uniformly covering the image pixel with a specified average particle size and 
size distribution. When cloud optical thickness is small enough (as for thin cirrus), such 
that a significant portion of radiation from the surface and atmosphere below is 
transmitted, the retrieved value of Tc is reevaluated to accoimt for this transmission. For 
clouds colder than 260 K, the cloud microphysical model is an ice cloud composed of 30 
p,m poly crystals (Rossow and Schiffer 1999). 

Clouds are classified in ISCCP according to cloud-top pressure (Pc) and optical 
thickness (Figure 2). In section 3, simulations employing a radiative transfer model will 
be used to relate the ISCCP cloud scheme and the split-window method. 

c. 31 cloud scheme and dataset 



The Improved Initialization Inversion (31) procedure is a physical-statistical algorithm 
for retrieving atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles as well as cloud and 
surface properties from TOVS observations, using HIRS and Microwave Sounding Unit 
(MSU) (Chedin et al. 1985). The original 31 cloud scheme was based on a combination 
of the "CO2 slicing" method and the "coherence-of-effective-cloud-amount" method, 
using channels within the CO2 absorption band around 14 nm (Wahiche et al. 1986, 
Stubenrauch et al. 1996). Comparison with ISCCP led to an improved 31 cloud retrieval 
scheme based on a weighted-x^ method which estimates the coherence of effective cloud 
amount at different pressure levels. The introduction of weights taking account of 
temperature profile uncertainty yields imbiased cloud parameters at all cloud heights for 
homogeneous cloud types (Stubenrauch et al. 1999b). 31 cloud properties (cloud-top 
pressure Pc and effective cloud amount Nsdd) are determined fi-om averaged radiances 
over all cloudy pixels within each 100 km by 100 km box, assuming a single, 
homogeneous cloud layer. Cirrus are defined as cloud with Pc < 440 mb and Nedd < 0.9. 

Cirrus from the 31 cloud dataset have been compared with those from ISCCP by 
Stubenrauch et al. (1999a). Resuhs show that 31 identifies 10% more cirrus than ISCCP 
DX over mid- and low latitude ocean; over tropical land, the difference is 20%. These 
discrepancies can be explained in part by the different detection sensitivities for their 
cirrus (c.f Liao et al. 1995 and Jin et al. 1996) and in part by small-scale horizontal and 
vertical heterogeneities to which the two datasets respond differently due to differences in 
spatial and spectral resolutions (Stubenrauch et al. 1999c). 



3. Comparison of Cloud Retrieval Techniques and Observations 



We present a comparison of the split-window and ISCCP results, since this has not 
been done before; a detailed comparison of 31 and ISCCP is given in Stubenrauch et al. 
(1999a; 1999c). 

The split-window method is based on the identification of clusters in a two- 
dimensional brightness temperature histogram of TBB and BTD. The ISCCP cloud 
analysis relies on a radiative model to retrieve cloud-top pressure (Pc) and cloud optical 
thickness (Tau) explicitly for each pixel and then uses these properties for a cloud 
classification. Therefore, a radiative transfer model. Streamer (Key 1996), is used as a 
bridge to compare these two cloud classifications. 

a. Radiative transfer model description 

Streamer (version 2.5p) is used to simulate AVHRR split-window channel radiances 
under clear and different cloudy conditions. Streamer can be used for computing either 
radiances (intensities) or irradiances (fluxes) for any viewing geometry in 24 shortwave 
and 105 longwave bands under a wide variety of atmospheric and surface conditions 
(Key 1996). A discrete ordinate solver (Stamnes et al. 1988) is used to compute 
radiances. Four absorbing gases are considered: water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, and 
oxygen. Seven standard atmospheric profiles are built-in but any other profile can be 
specified. Cloud optical properties are based on three different parameterization 
schemes: water cloud scheme (Hu and Stamnes 1993), ice cloud shortwave scheme (Fu 
and Liou 1993), and ice cloud longwave scheme (parameterized single scattering 
properties of ice spheres using Mie theory). Aerosol amounts can be distributed vertically 
either by a user-supplied profile or one of the internal standard profiles. In Streamer, 
"each computation is done for a scene, where the scene can be a mixture of up to 10 

8 



cloud types occurring individually, up to 10 overlapping cloud sets of up to 10 clouds 
each, and the clear sky, all over some combination of up to three surface types" (Key 
1996). 

Streamer's accuracy in clear-sky conditions has been tested by comparing 
computations to other models in the Intercomparison of Radiation Codes in Climate 
Models (ICRCCM) (Ellingson et al. 1991). In all five standard cases, ranging from 
tropical to subarctic winter atmosphere, the longwave fluxes computed by Streamer were 
within 5% and one standard deviation of the mean of all the models (Jin and Rossow 
1997). Pinto et al. (1997) compared the Streamer's modeled downwelling broadband 
longwave irradiance with that of the observation and found a bias of 3W/m . 

b. Comparison of cloud retrieval techniques 

AVHRR radiances from split-window charmels are simulated using Streamer for clear 
and different types of clouds represented by their Pc and Tau values, consistent with the 
ISCCP cloud classification (see Fig 2). Microphysical properties such as cloud particle 
effective radius (10 |xm for water clouds and 30 p.m for ice clouds) and water content are 
specified to be the same as in the ISCCP retrieval model. Since the split-window method 
makes no explicit assumptions about the microphysics (with one exception noted below), 
we choose this approach to focus solely on cloud classification differences. 

Figure 3 and 4 show a series of simulations of BTD as a function of cloud-top pressure 
(Pc) and optical thickness (Tau) for the Air Force Geophysical Laboratories (AFGL) 
reference tropical profile (McClatchey et al. 1971). Besides Pc and Tau, BTD is also 
sensitive to cloud phase, cloud particle size distribution, and a few other microphysical 
properties (Wu 1987; Parol et al. 1991; Giraud et al. 2001). Replacing the single 



scattering properties of ice spheres by those of ice polycrystals (Mitchell et al. 1996) in 
these calculations (not shown) decreases the BTD by about 0.5K, but the structure of the 
figure stays the same. The upper panels of the two figures assume all clouds are 
composed of ice particles, while the middle panels assume all clouds are water clouds. 
The lower panels combine these two cases so that clouds above 440 mb level are ice and 
clouds below that are liquid. The simulations are done for two different satellite zenith 
angles covering the extremes for AVHRR. 

Generally, these simulations show that cirrus clouds, which are at high altitude and 
optically thin, have larger BTD values compared with other types of clouds and clear sky 
(BTD is not zero for clear sky because of the spectral dependence of water vapor 
absorption; see Figure 5). However, there is one unexpected feature: besides thin cirrus, 
a second local maximum of BTD exists where PC is around 500 mb and TAU is about 
1.3, depending on satellite zenith angle. This second maximum is caused by two 
competing effects that combine to determine the BTD values. On the one hand, water 
clouds have larger BTD values than ice clouds (see Fig 3 and 4), because BTD tends to 
be larger for clouds with smaller particle size (Wu 1987; Giraud et al. 2001). On the 
other hand, BTD also exhibits a larger value for higher and optically thinner clouds, 
because these clouds (such as cirrus) generate a larger difference in emissivity between 
the two split-window channels (Inoue 1985). For these reasons, cirrus clouds have larger 
BTD because they are high and optically thin, while thin liquid altocumulus clouds also 
have relatively large BTD because they consist of small particles and are also high and 
thin enough. Thus, there is potential for confusion between the thinnest midlevel water 
clouds and higher-level ice clouds. 



10 



In addition to BTD, TBB has also been simulated as a function of Pc and Tau (not 
shown). Based on the two cloud classification schemes (Fig 1 and Fig 2) and the 
simulations of BTD and TBB, we find out the link between the two cloud classifications: 
Figure 6 shows how clouds classified by ISCCP are categorized by the split-window 
method, depending on satellite zenith angle. For example, at nadir thin cirrus seen by 
the split-window method corresponds to almost all the cirrus seen by ISCCP, plus some 
cirrostratus, midlevel clouds and very thin low clouds. Thick and dense cirrus defined by 
the split-window method almost all fall into the cirrostratus category defined by ISCCP. 
However, as satellite zenith angle increases, the two methods agree better on cirrus. 
Therefore, Figure 6 provides the basis for comparing cirrus retrieved by ISCCP and the 
split-window methods in the next subsection. 

c. Comparison of retrieved cloud information 

For each pixel in the ISCCP DX dataset, the clear-sky TBB and BTD, and 
cloudy/clear decision already inferred by the analysis are used by the split-window 
method to retrieve clouds from the cloudy-sky radiances. We compare the two cloud 
retrieval techniques by showing cloud type fi-equency distributions of each cloud type 
classified by one technique as a function of the classification by the other. The resulting 
table is like a two-dimensional probability density function. Five years of data have been 
processed: results are similar for all years. We show the tables derived from two regions 
where cirrus clouds prevail: warm pool ocean (western Pacific) and African tropical land 
(see Table 1 and Table 2). Numbers in the tables represent the cloud amount (CA) 
frequency distribution. 



11 



In the warm pool area, both methods identify about 20 to 30 percent cirrus; however, 
they do not agree exactly on which clouds are cirrus. More than half of the cirrus clouds 
identified by the split-window method are called cirrus by ISCCP and the rest are 
distributed between mid-level and low-level thin clouds. A similar distribution is 
obtained, when surface observations are used to identify cirrus for corresponding ISCCP 
scenes (Hahn et al. 2001). Likewise, more than three fourths of cirrus identified by 
ISCCP are called cirrus by the split-window method, but some are classified as other 
clouds such as N-type (partial cloud cover, non-black low-level clouds, and low-level 
black clouds overlaid by thin cirrus) and cumulonimbus clouds by the split-window 
method. Over Afi-ican tropical land, similar results are found, except that both method 
find less cirrus there than in the warm pool ocean. 

The radiative model studies in the previous part have shown that the cirrus defined by 
the split-window method may include some optically thin, liquid, mid-level clouds. 
ISCCP also retrieves cloud-top temperatures that are too large when cirrus overlies 
lower-level clouds, thus mistakenly labeling some cirrus as altocumulus (Jin et al. 1996; 
Stubenrauch et al. 1999c). It is hard to tell which effect dominates based only on the data 
we have. Further work is needed to separate clouds that are falsely detected as 
altocumulus by ISCCP from those that are real altocumulus. One possible way might be 
to make use of collocated radiance data at other wavelengths, such as the 6.7 i^m water 
vapor band, to check the signature of real cirrus, since radiances at 6.7 nm saturate for 
midlevel clouds but are still sensitive to cirrus. 

4. Application to the Mt. Pinatubo case 



12 



We make use of the differences of the several cloud retrieval algorithms to find out 
whether the Mt. Pinatubo volcano affected cirrus. 

In the ISCCP analysis, the 0.6 nm visible channel, which is important in determining 
cloud optical thickness, is also sensitive to the scattering by atmospheric aerosols, 
especially when their optical thickness is larger than normal like following the Mt. 
Pinatubo eruption. However, aerosol effects are not included in the ISCCP radiative 
model. Therefore, they will affect the analysis of clouds (Rossow et al. 1996). This effect 
is negligible in normal conditions when the optical thickness of stratospheric aerosol is of 
order 10"^. However, after the large volcanic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in June 1991, the 
situation was very different. By late 1991 the stratospheric aerosol optical thickness (at 
0.5 |im wavelength) determined from SAGE II over the equatorial region was aroimd 0.2 
or larger, while the value inferred from AVHRR was as large as 0.45 (Stenchikov et al. 
1998). An optical thickness of 0.2 is already large enough to affect the retrieval of thin 
cirrus in the ISCCP analysis as we show later. The split-window method, on the other 
hand, is not easily affected by stratospheric aerosols since it utilizes the radiances from 
two much longer infrared wavelengths, which are not scattered effectively by the very 
small stratospheric particles. We also examine the 31 cloud data, which, like the split- 
window method, utilizes only IR radiances for cloud property retrieval (there is one cloud 
test out of eight during daytime that uses visible radiances). 

a. "Pinatubo-Cirrus " story and one apparent discrepancy 

Jensen et al. (1992) studied the possibility that volcanic aerosols may significantly 
alter the concentration of ice crystals which nucleate in cirrus and assessed the potential 
impact of these processes on the evolution and radiative properties of cirrus. Their model 

13 



simulations suggest that under certain conditions the effect on cirrus of volcanic sulfate 
aerosols transported down into the upper troposphere could be to increase the 
concentration of ice crystals by as much as a factor of 5 and increase the surface warming 
of certain types of cirrus near the tropopause by as much as 8 W/m . Nevertheless, 
Jensen et al. (1994) found that cirrus properties are generally much less sensitive to the 
number of condensation nuclei (CN) present than to other factors such as temperature, 
cooling rate, and vertical wind speed. 

Sassen et al. (1992, 1995) studied a jet stream cirrus case during the FIRE II Intensive 
Field Observations (IFO) and suggested that Pinatubo aerosols might be influencing the 
cirrus properties. The field observations were carried out in south Kansas on 5 and 6 
December 1991 during a period of moist subtropical flow when a strong jet stream swept 
cirrus clouds through the area. Observed tropopause folding was believed to be the 
mechanism for injecting stratospheric aerosols of volcanic origin into the troposphere. 
Unusual cirrus cloud microphysical properties, such as "abnormally high ice crystal 
concentration, perhaps unique radial ice crystal shapes, and relatively large haze particles 
in cirrus uncinus", suggested the alteration of cirrus by contamination from decaying 
volcanic debris within six months of the Mt. Pinatubo volcano (Sassen et al. 1995). 
They also pointed out the possible climatic implications. Although the Mt. Pinatubo 
aerosol is estimated to have cooled the earth's surface temperature by less than 1 C by 
direct reflection of incoming solar radiation, the additional effects of perturbed cirrus 
clouds could provide either a competing or reinforcing climatic adjustment in the years 
following the eruption. 



14 



Wylie and Menzel described a gradual increase of high-level cloud amount in tropics 
and northern mid-latitudes by about 0.005/yr from 1989 to 1997. They employed a cloud 
retrieval technique, called the CO2 slicing method, which is capable of correctly 
identifying most of transmissive clouds using the HIRS infrared bands v^^ith partial CO2 
absorption (Wylie et al. 1994). The CO2 slicing technique using the HIRS instrument is 
more sensitive to the very thin cirrus than ISCCP, finding almost twice as much thin 
cirrus as the first version of ISCCP (C-series) did (Jin et al. 1996). A study by 
Stubenrauch et al. (1999a) shows an improvement of cirrus frequencies by 10-20% from 
CX to DX due to increased sensitivity to cirrus over land in the DX analysis and a better 
treatment of ice clouds in the DX radiative model. On the other hand, the CO2 slicing 
technique is sensitive to surface temperature errors. Positive surface temperature errors 
cause detection of more thin cirrus. Jin et al. (1996) found that in the old HIRS analysis 
(Wylie et al. 1994) SST values are about 2 K warmer than the blended satellite ship 
values, but its surface temperature is significantly underestimated over high topography 
causing an under-detection of cirrus. 

Figure 7 shows the global changes of cirrus detected by ISCCP during a period of five 
years: fi-om January 1989 to December 1993. In contrast with Wylie and Sassen's 
findings, ISCCP sees a decrease in thin cirrus (defined below) cloud amount by 0.02 - 
0.04 globally after the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. However, the corresponding and 
opposite change of cumulus cloud amounts shown in the same figure, together with the 
fact that both changes occur preferentially over oceans, suggests that these changes may 
be caused by the effect of the aerosol in the satellite visible radiances instead of real 
changes of the clouds (Rossow and Schiffer 1999). During the same period of time, a 



15 



slight increase in the average optical thickness of cirrus is also found in the ISCCP 
dataset, which still might be consistent with Sassen and Jensen's studies. 

What actually happened to cirrus after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption? To answer this 
question, we check other satellite observations that are not as sensitive to volcanic 
aerosols. 

b. Most likely scenario for the changes of cirrus properties after Mt. Pinatubo volcano 

Mt. Pinatubo volcano erupted on Luzon Island in Philippines (15. ION, 120.40E), with 
the strongest explosion on June 15, 1991. Following the June 15 eruption, the evolving 
cloud of water vapor, sulphurous gases and aerosol spread out both longitudinally and 
latitudinally and occupied a latitude band of approximately 20S to 30N within a few 
months (McCormick et al. 1995). Figure 8 shows the zonal mean total stratospheric 
aerosol extinction as a function of latitude and time observed from SAGE II (cf Fig. 3 in 
Stenchikov et al. 1998). Total stratospheric aerosol extinction at 1.02 |xm wavelength 
was about 0.05/km or even higher in tropical and subtropical regions from one or two 
months after the volcano to aroimd one and half a year later, which is greater than the 
pre-emption level by about a factor of 50. Stenchikov et al. (1998) calculated aerosol 
optical thickness from these data: at 0.525 (xm wavelength values exceeded 0.2. 

The influence of the volcanic event on the amounts of various cloud types as seen by 
ISCCP and the split-window data are shown in Figure 9 and 10. These two figures show 
the zonal mean cloud amount as a function of latitude and time, starting from the 
beginning of 1989 to the end of 1993. To isolate the influence of the volcano, the mean 
seasonal cycle has been removed from the original data. Similar to the data manipulation 
in the previous section, each cloudy pixel is processed according to the two cloud 

16 



retrieval methods, and then cloud amount is calculated in a large region by counting the 
fraction of cloudy pixels. The original ISCCP cirrus cloud classification is further 
divided into two groups: thin cirrus (Tau < 1.3) and thick cirrus (1.3 < Tau < 3.6). Such 
division is justified by their different responses to the volcanic eruption as will be shown. 
Over tropical and subtropical oceans, ISCCP sees a dramatic decrease of thin cirrus 
clouds after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, decreasing from a normal value around 0.1 to 
below 0.02 and not fiilly recovering until late 1993. Similar changes are not observed for 
thin cirrus over land. In the ISCCP dataset, there is also a slight increase in thick cirrus 
over both ocean and land. On the other hand, observations from the split-window 
analysis do not show any significant changes of thin or thick cirrus associated with the 
volcanic eruption over either ocean or land. 

Since the optically thinnest, high-level clouds are usually detected by the IR threshold, 
the aerosol will not significantly affect cloud detections (Rossow and Schiffer 1999). 
However, because the ISCCP radiative model does not include aerosol effects, any 
additional reflectance caused by aerosols is combined with that by clouds, thus increasing 
the retrieved cloud optical thickness. In this situation, the thinnest cirrus may be 
misclassified as some other type. In the ISCCP analysis, the clear-sky visible reflectance 
over ocetm is constrained by a model of ocean surface reflectance, so that the additional 
visible reflectance caused by volcanic aerosols is included with the clouds; but over land, 
the clear-sky reflectance is calculated from the data each month, so, the volcanic aerosols 
increase the land surface visible reflectance and not the clouds (Rossow and Schiffer 
1999). Thus, the Pinatubo aerosols increase the ISCCP retrieved average optical 
thickness of cirrus over ocean as first pointed out by B. Soden (private communication). 



17 



Furthennore, the sub-micron-sized aerosols have a smaller asymmetry parameter, thus 
they are better reflectors of incoming solar radiation than the larger cirrus particles. As a 
result, their contributions to the retrieved cloud optical thickness are even greater than 
their nominal optical thickness values. All these effects are negligible in normal 
conditions, because the optical thickness of background aerosol is of order 10' . But 
during the Pinatubo event, aerosol layers as thick as 0.2 are comparable to some thin 
cirrus clouds. In the ISCCP analysis, cloud top pressure is adjusted for optically thin 
clouds to account for transmitted IR radiation. This adjustment process is very sensitive 
to the optical thickness value used for the thinnest clouds; indeed, for those cirrus with 
optical thickness less than 1, sensitivity tests show that the magnitude of the reflectivity 
increase by the volcanic aerosol may cause the ISCCP analysis to retrieve cloud top 
temperature tens of degrees higher. Therefore, the extra visible reflectance added to the 
thin cirrus cloud layers by the Pinatubo aerosols causes the reassignment of thin cirrus to 
lower-level cloud types. Figure 9 shows an increase of altocumulus and cumulus clouds 
in the ISCCP results as expected from this analysis. Moreover, the split-window method, 
which is not so sensitive to volcanic aerosols, shows little change in thin cirrus amount. 

Figure 1 1 compares the variation of cirrus cloud amount with time from the ISCCP 
and 31 datasets, covering a few years before and after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. The 
observations used in this analysis of the 31 dataset are from NOAA-11 satellite; only 
daytime observations are shown. Again, seasonal cycles are removed from the original 
data. Generally, thin cirrus (Pc < 440 mb and NEdd < 0.5) and thick cirrus (Pc < 440 mb 
and 0.5 < Nscid < 0.9) as seen by 31 do not show any significant changes that are 
associated with Mt. Pinatubo eruption. There are some changes of cirrus over tropical 



18 



and subtropical land, but they are probably caused by the shifting orbit of NOAA-11, 
which has a larger effect on cloud sampling over land where the diurnal cycle of clouds 
may be stronger. 31 cloud datasets should in general not be affected by the volcanic 
aerosols due to the use of IR radiances; however, there is one cloud test out of eight 
during daytime that uses visible radiances. Therefore, a small increase about 0.02 of thin 
cirrus over subtropical and tropical oceans may be attributable to such an effect 
(Stubenrauch and Eddounia 2001). Thin cirrus as seen by ISCCP decrease dramatically 
and abruptly in the tropics (up to 0.08 decrease within a few months) and thick cirrus 
increase gradually after the Mt. Pinatubo volcanic eruption. So, this comparison shows 
the same contrast in changes of cirrus after Mt. Pinatubo volcano, as in the ISCCP-split 
window comparison. 

In fact, comparing Figure 8 with Figure 9, 10, and 1 1 provides further support for our 
interpretation. The aerosol patterns derived from SAGE II and thin cirrus distributions 
seen by ISCCP are spatially and temporally very similar, with a correlation coefficient as 
high as -0.85 in the tropics. In contrast, the correlation between the 31 thin cirrus and the 
SAGE 11 aerosol is 0.35 in the same region; the correlation between the thin cirrus 
identified by the split-window method and the SAGE II is only 0.09. This appears to be 
consistent with the relative sensitivities of these methods to aerosols. 

Besides coverage, cloud optical thickness is another important cloud property that 
determines cloud radiative effects. If cirrus cloud amount has not undergone significant 
changes after the Mt. Pinatubo volcano, their microphysical properties and their optical 
thickness may still have been affected by volcanic aerosols. Since the optical thickness 
reported by ISCCP includes the contribution from aerosols, we look at the BTD between 



19 



11 and 12 mn as a surrogate. Figure 12 and 13 show the BTD for tropical and 
subtropical cirrus-like clouds identified by both ISCCP and the split-window method as a 
function of latitude and time (only tropical and subtropical BTDs are shown because the 
split-window method works better at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes). Similar to 
figure 9 and 10, the mean seasonal cycle has been removed from the original data. BTD 
for clear sky is also shown for comparison in figure 13. Generally, BTDs for cirrus do 
not change significantly after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. (Because the ISCCP temperature 
digitization is about 0.5° to 0.8° for the temperature range relevant here, any temperature 
anomaly lower than that is not considered significant.) There is a slight decrease of BTD 
for the ISCCP identified thick cirrus and cirrostratus, starting in 1992. According to 
simulations (see Fig. 3 and 4), this may be made possible by increasing cloud top 
pressure or increasing cloud optical thickness (except for tropopause cirrus). In other 
words, thick cirrus and cirrostratus may have thickened and moved to lower altitude after 
Mt. Pinatubo eruption. However, this change is only marginally detectable. 
Furthermore, since the change starts more than one year after the volcanic event, there 
may be other reasons for this change than an indirect effect of volcanic aerosols. 
Therefore, we conclude that Mt. Pinatubo eruption did not have a significant effect on 
cirrus cloud optical properties over the temporal and spatial scales by which our data are 
analyzed. However, our results should not be taken as contradictory to those by Sassen 
(1995) because Sassen et al. looked at changes of cirrus in a particular meteorological 
event. It is still possible that the Pinatubo aerosols have a local influence on the cirrus, 
like that observed by Sassen et al., but we did not find any systematic effect on both 
cirrus amount and cirrus optical properties.

5. Summary and Discussion 

In the first half of the paper, we compared cirrus retrieved by ISCCP and the spHt- 
window method. By using a radiative transfer model, Streamer, a series of simulations 
have been carried out, showing that cirrus clouds, defined in ISCCP as Pc < 440 mb and 
Tau < 3.6, have a large BTD, which is used by the split-window method to isolate cirrus. 
However, the simulations also show that some thin mid-level clouds with small liquid 
particles could exhibit BTD values large enough to be included in the thin cirrus 
category. When applied to AVHRR, both ISCCP and the split-window method identify 
around 20 to 30 percent cirrus clouds in the tropical oceanic and terrestrial regions; 
however, there is detailed disagreement in classification for half of these clouds (see Fig. 
6). These discrepancies are attributed to the simplifying assumptions made by both 
methods. For example, the split-window method does not consider water clouds that may 
show a similar signature as high-level clouds. ISCCP, on the other hand, may retrieve a 
cloud top temperature that is too large for some cirrus because of small errors in the 
retrieved optical thickness. Collocated 6.7 |im water vapor channel radiances, which are 
sensitive to high-level clouds, but not to mid-level clouds, would be helpful in resolving 
some of these discrepancies. 

In the second half of the paper, we make use of different sensitivities of several cloud 
retrieval techniques to find out what actually happened to cirrus after the Mt. Pinatubo 
volcanic eruption. The datasets taken into consideration are the ISCCP data, the split- 
window observations, and 31 cloud data. Because the latter two datasets are derived from 
infrared radiances, they are much less sensitive to volcanic aerosols than the ISCCP data 

21 



(although daytime 31 resuhs have some sensitivity to visible reflectivity increase by 
aerosols). After Mt. Pinatubo eruption, ISCCP detects a dramatic decrease of thin cirrus 
(Pc < 440 mb; Tau < 1 .3) over ocean by a factor of five compared with their normal 
amount, accompanied by a comparable increase of altocumulus and cumulus clouds; over 
land no significant changes of thin cirrus have been observed in ISCCP. On the contrary, 
results from the split-window observations and 31 data show little change in thin cirrus 
that is associated with the volcanic eruption over both ocean and land. According to 31 
data, there is a slight increase of thin cirrus amount by 0.02 in the subtropics and tropics. 
Careful examination of ISCCP cloud algorithm suggests that the apparent large decrease 
of thin cirrus in ISCCP data is probably an artifact due to the additional visible reflection 
by volcanic aerosols hanging around in the stratosphere (Rossow and Schiffer 1999). 
This would affect both cloud optical thickness and adjustment of cloud top height; thus, 
thin cirrus could be classified as other clouds. Over land, the volcanic aerosols just 
increase land surface visible reflectance (as found). Therefore, the most likely scenario is 
close to what has been observed by 31 data and the split-window observations. Besides 
cirrus cloud coverage, another possible influence on cirrus of Mt. Pinatubo volcano is 
some alteration of cloud microphysical and optical properties. However, by looking at 
the changes of the BTD as a surrogate of cloud optical thickness, it is suggested that the 
Pinatubo aerosols did not systematically and significantly influence cirrus optical 
properties on the global scale, either. Previous studies showing some changes are 
probably isolated local effects. Thus, there is no indication in these results of a 
climatically significant feedback where aerosol-altered cirrus produced an additional 
climate effect beyond the direct aerosol-radiative effect.
