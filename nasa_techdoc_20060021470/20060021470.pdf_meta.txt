x-archive-meta-description: Code generators for realistic application domains are not directly verifiable in practice. Certifiable code generation is an alternative approach, where the the generator is extended to generate logical annotations (i.e., pre- and post-conditions and loop invariants) along with the programs, allowing &fly automated program safety proofs. However, it is difficult to implement and maintain because it requires access to the generator sources, and because the annotations are cross-cutting concerns, both on the object-level (i.e., in the generated code) and on the meta-level (i.e., in the generator). We describe a generic post-generation annotation inference algorithm to circumvent these problems. It exploits the fact that the output of a code generator is highly idiomatic, so that patterns can be used to describe all code constructs that require annotations, in a way which is largely independent of the code generator The algorithm then uses techniques similar to aspect-oriented programming to add the annotations to the generated code. The generic algorithm is implemented and instantiated for two generators; the instantiations are applied successfully to fully automatically certify initialization safety for the generated programs.
