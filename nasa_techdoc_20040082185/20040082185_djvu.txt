ABSTRACT 

We survey the relative abundances of elements with 1 < Z < 82 in solar energetic 
particle (SEP) events observed at 2-10 MeV amu'^ during nearly 9 years aboard the Wind 
spacecraft, with special emphasis on enhanced abundances of elements with ^34. 
Abundances of Fe/0 again show a bimodal distribution with distinct contributions from 
impulsive and gradual SEP events as seen in earlier solar cycles. Periods with greatly 
enhanced abundances of (50<Z<56)/O, like those with enhanced ^He/He, fall promi- 
nently in the Fe-rich population of the impulsive SEP events. In a sample of the 39 
largest impulsive events, 25 have measurable enhancements in (50<Z<56)/O and 
(76<Z<B2)/0, relative to coronal values, ranging from --I00 to 10,000. By contrast, in a 
sample of 45 large gradual events the corresponding enhancements vary from -0.2 to 20. 
However, the magnitude of the heavy-element enhancements in impulsive events is less 
striking than their strong correlation with the Fe spectral index and flare size, with the 
largest enhancements occurring in flares with the steepest Fe spectra, the smallest Fe 
fluence, and the lowest X-ray intensity, as reported here for the first time Thus it seems 
that small events with low energy input can produce only steep spectra of the dominant 
species but accelerate rare heavy elements with great efficiency, probably by selective 
absorption of resonant waves in the flare plasma. With increased energy input, enhance- 
ments diminish, as heavy ions are depleted, and spectra of the dominant species harden.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Relative abundances of elements and isotopes have proven to be a rich sotirce of in- 
formation on the origin and history of populations of energetic ions we have encoimtered 
throughout the heliosphere (e.g. Reames 1999). In the solar energetic particle (SEP) 
events, abundances have aided in distinguishing two underlying mechanisms of particle 
acceleration that contribute to "gradxial" and "impulsive" SEP events (see reviews 
Reames 1990, 1995b, 1999, 2002; Kahler 1992, 1994, 2001; Gosling 1993; Lee 1997; 
TyDca 2001), In the large gradual SEP events, abundances of elements up to Fe at a few 
MeV amu' are, on average, similar to those of the solar corona and solar wind (Meyer 
1985; Reames 1995a, 1999) from which ions are accelerated by shock waves driven out 
from the sun by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). In contrast, the impulsive SEP events 
associated with solar flares have 1000-fold enhancements of ^He/*He and enhancements 
in heavier elements that increase with decreasing charge-to-mass ratio Q/A of the ions at 
coronal ten^eratures (e.g. Reames, Meyer, & von Rosenvinge 1994). The pattem of en- 
hancements in impulsive SEP events is generally believed to result from resonant wave- 
particle interactions in the turbulent flare plasma (Fisk 1978; Temerin & Roth 1992; 
Miller & Vinas 1993; Roth & Temerin 1997; Miller 1998). In some large SEP events, 
however, intermediate abundances may result when remnant suprathermal ions from im- 
pulsive events contribute to the material accelerated by CME-driven shock waves (Mason 
et al 1999; Tylka et al 2001; Desai et al 2003). In addition, the effects of particle trans- 
port from the source can caxise abundances to vary with particle energy and with space 
and time during gradual events (Ng, Reames, & Tylka 2003). 

For elements with atomic number Z > 34, solar abundances decrease precipitously 
by as much as -6 to 8 orders of magnitude below that of O (Grevesse & Sauval 1998), 
and early instruments were unable to collect enough ions to make regular measurements 
of abundances in this region. The earliest measurements of heavy-element abundances in 
SEP events were made using particle tracks collected in a glass window of the Apollo 16 
command module (Shirk & Price 1972). In recent years, however, regular measurements 
of abundances of the elements throughout the periodic table above Fe have begun to con- 
tribute to the study of SEP events (Reames 2000; Reames, Ng, & Tylka 2001; Tylka et al. 
2002; Mason et al 2004). For inqjulsive events, 2/64-dependent enhancements continue 
into the region of heavy elements, producing -1000-fold enhancements for (Z > 50)/O. 
For gradxial events, however, ions with Z > 34 often have coronal abundances or only 
modest enhancements that follow a ten:5)oral behavior similar to that of Fe/O and show 
high-energy spectral rollovers with the same gZ4 -dependence as the elements up through 
Fe (Reames et al. 2001). Most of the recent measurements of ions with 34 < Z < 82 men- 
tioned above have been made in the 3.3 to 10 MeV amu"^ region with the large-geometry 
Low-Energy Matrix Telescope (LEMT) on the Wind spacecraft that we discuss herein. 
Recently, however, time-of- flight-based measurements in the 0.1 to 1 MeV amu'^ region 
showing similar heavy-element enhancements in ^He-rich events have been reported by 
Mason et al. (2004). 

The previous heavy-element observations from LEMT were reported for Hmited 
time periods or in selected SEP events. In this paper we extend those results significantly 
by surveying all such measurements from 1994 November 4 through 2003 September 28. 
This allows us to study the statistical properties of heavy element abundances in a large 



sample of SEP events of various kinds. Properties of the LEMT telescope have been de- 
scribed by von Rosenvinge et al. (1995) and its response to heavy elements has been 
described in detail by Reames (2000). 

2. THE SYNOPTIC VIEW. 

A classical way to provide an overall view of the systematic variations of element 
and isotopic abundances has been to divide the entire sample period into daily averages 
and to plot the pattern of intensities of one species against another on a day-to-day basis. 
This technique allows one to view the fiill sweep of abundance variations with no bias as 
to the selection of "events" for study; each day is an "event". Reames (1988) made plots 
of daily- averaged Fe v^. O at -2 MeV amu'^ and found a bimodal distribution corre- 
sponding to the presence of impulsive and gradual SEP events. Distinguishing the points 
in the plot of Fe v^. O by their corresponding ^He/He, proton/electron, or He/H ratios, 
the underlying properties of the contributing impulsive and gradual events were further 
identified 

Owing to the greater sensitivity of LEMT, we have divided the present data set into 
8-hour intervals and show in Figure 1 Fe V5. O intensities for each of those intervals in 
the -9-year study period. In the upper panel of the figure, the color and size of the sym- 
bols varies with the ^He/'^He ratio at 2.1-2.5 MeV amu"^ during each interval, while 
symbols in the lower panel depend upon the (50<Z<56)/O abundance ratio at 3.3-10 MeV 
amu'\ The approximate intensity of background anomalous cosmic ray (ACR) O during 
solar minimum is marked on the panels. This represents an approximate lower bound for 
the O intensity for the years 1994-1998 (see Reames & McDonald 2003) during which 
many small SEP events occur. Each panel in Figure 1 contains about 4900 points. 

In the upper panel of Figure 1, it is not difficult to follow the locus of the distribu- 
tions we identify with impulsive and gradual SEP events at or slightly above the lines of 
Fe/0=1 and 0.1, respectively. The ^He-rich intervals cluster near the line with Fe/0=1 at 
moderate intensities but are deflected below that line at very low intensities when back- 
ground from ACR O is present to depress Fe/0 from the impulsive events. At higher 
intensities of Fe or O, ^He/^He in impulsive events decreases to values below 0.2 that are 
not easily measured by LEMT because of its limited resolution (Reames et al. 1997). 
However, the track of impulsive event intervals seems to end where the intensities of Fe 
or O reach -10'^ particles cm'^ sr"^ s"^ MeV'^ amu. Intervals during gradual events are 
distributed about the line Fe/O=0.1 at low and moderate intensities, but generally rise 
above Fe/O=0.1 at high intensities; many of these high-intensity intervals occur early 
during large SEP events when Fe/O is elevated by transport-dominated effects (e.g. 
Tylka, Reames, & Ng 1999; Ng, Reames, & Tylka 1999; Reames, Ng, & Tylka 2000), 
including those in the large "Bastille-day" event of 2000 July 14 (Reames, Ng, & Tylka 
2001). Note that, at the very lowest Fe intensities, a few of the 8-hr intervals distributed 
near Fe/O-O.l actually correspond to ions from corotating interacting regions for which 
abundances are also un-enhanced (see e.g. Reames 1999). 

In the lower panel of Figure 1, (50<Z<56)/O ratios highlight the points. Intervals 
with large values of this ratio are seen to cluster along the track of Fe/0=1. At the low- 
est intensities, of course, elements with 50<Z<56 can only be seen when these ions are 
greatly enhanced relative to the coronal (50<Z<56)/O ratio taken as 2.90x10"^ (Grevesse 



& Sauval 1998; see Reames 2000). Near the top of the impulsive region where Fe or O 
reach --^10"'^ particles cm'^ sr"^ s"^ MeV'^ amu, near-coronal abundances of (50<Z<56)/O 
would be measurable, but 100- and 1000-fold enhancements of (50<Z<56)/O are seen. 
These large enhancements along the impulsive track contrast with nearly coronal values 
in the gradual region nearby. Occasional instances of significantly enhanced 
(50<Z<56)/O in the gradual population (Fe/O-0.1) at intermediate intensities usually cor- 
respond to intervals where both impulsive and gradual events contribute, as we shall see 
in Section 4 below. 

Superficially it may seem that ^He- and Z>50 ion enhancements occupy nearly ex- 
clusive regions of the Fe/O-1, impulsive-event track. However, instrument sensitivity 
limits the observation of even greatly enhanced Z>50 ions in small events and "^HeAle 
ratios decrease in large events, probably because the supply of ^He ions in the flare vol- 
ume is becoming exhausted (Reames 1999), These two facts conspire to limit the 
observational overlap of ^He- and Z^50 ion enhancements. We believe that the apparent 
separation of impulsive events with ^He- and Z>50 enhancements is entirely instrumen- 
tal. 

Finally, we point out that the 8-hr averaging of the data in Figure 1 distorts the rela- 
tive probabihty of impulsive and gradual events. Gradual events, lasting several days, are 
sampled several times while more than one impulsive event may contribute to a single 
point in the figure. 

3. IMPULSrVE EVENTS 



5.7 Preliminary Impulsive Event Selection 

To place the heavy-element abundances in the general context of impulsive events, 
we have begun by scanning hourly-averaged data to select a preliminary list of events 
using two different criteria: 1) events where ^He/^He>0.5 and intensities of ^He or "^He 
exceed 10"^ particles cm'"^ sr"^ s'^ MeV"^ amu, and 2) events where Fe/O>0.5 and intensi- 
ties of Fe intensities exceed 10'^ particles cm'^ sr'^ s'^ MeV'^ amu. The second criterion 
for impulsive events is clearly guided by the distributions of particle abundances shown 
in Figure L A total of 133 events were foxmd, 80 met the ^He-rich criteria, 82 met the 
Fe-rich criteria and 29 met both criteria. Note that ^He-rich events can occur in intervals 
that need not contribute to Figure 1 because the events are too small to have measurable 
Fe and O intensities. Relaxing the criteria on the intensities of ^He and ^He or their ratio 
would have produced hundreds of candidate events. However, determining that intensity 
increases are truly new event onsets becomes difficult for smaller events, so we have 
used conservative criteria. 

Intensity-time profiles for events with a v^iety of properties are compared in Fig- 
ure 2. Events 1 and 2 in the figure are ^He-rich (^He/^He --10) events of moderate 
intensity for which the intensities of Fe and O are too low for measurement. The latter is 
completely obscured by the ACR O that runs across the panel Events 3 and 4 are some- 
what larger though they occur in a high backgroxmd of H and "^He fi-om a gradual event 
much earlier. These events have similar intensities of ^He, but Event 4 has more ^He and 
clear increases in O and Fe. Event 5 is similar to Event 4, but shows a small increase of 



associated heavy elements. Events 6 and 7 have higher intensities of ^He, Fe and O and 
significant numbers of heavy elements. ^He/^He is substantially reduced in both events, 
although it is measurable in Event 7. Events 8 and 9 have similar intensities of H, "^He, O 
and Fe, but Event 9 has a substantial number of heavy ions and measurable ^He. Events 
10-13 are a series of large impulsive events that sometimes occur when the spacecraft is 
inside the CME following a gradual event and is thus magnetically well-connected to an 
active region where flares are likely (see Reames 2000 for a similar example). 

The rate of occurrence of impulsive events increases with the solar cycle (e.g. 
Reames et al. 1994). However, near solar maximum, these small events are obscured by 
the presence of large gradual events. During the years 2000, 2001, and 2002, for exam- 
ple, the 2.6-3.2 MeV amu"^ O intensity is above 10^ particles cm'^ sr"^ s"^ MeV~^ amu for 
37% of the time, making it difficult to see and measure Fe and O in impulsive events with 
this intensity or less. During the same 3 years the 2.0-2.4 MeV amu'^ "^He intensity is 
above 10"^ particles cm"^ sr"^ s'^ MeV"^ amu for 68% of the time, making the observation 
of small ^He-rich events even more difficult. During these years, the 2.1-2.5 MeV H in- 
tensity is above the extremely high value of 1 particle cm'^ sr'^ s"^ MeV'^ for 43% of the 
time. 

3.2 ''Large " Impulsive Events - Abundances 

Clearly, as seen from Figure 1, heavy ions are most likely to be found in the most 
intense Fe-rich impulsive SEP events. Therefore, from the original sample of Fe-rich 
impulsive events we select a subset of "large" impulsive events with Fe intensity above 
10^ particles cm"^ sr'^ s"^ MeV"^ amu. Properties of the 39 large impulsive events se- 
lected are shown in Table 1. Of the 39 events, 33 events have Z>34 ions and 25 events 
have Z>50 ions. (All of the 14 events with Fe intensity above 10"^ particles cm'^ sf^ s'^ 
MeV"^ amu have heavy elements.) 

In Figure 3 we show the time-integrated heavy-element enhancements as a ftmction 
of the corresponding enhancement of Fe/0 for the sample of 39 large impulsive events 
defined above. The coronal abundance ratios for Fe/0, (34<Z<40)/O, (50<Z<56)/O, and 
(76<Z<82)/0 are taken as 0.134, 2.22x10'^ 2.90x10"^, and 1.01x10"^, respectively. The 
enhancement factors cluster around -10, -100, -1000, and -1000 for the four species, 
respectively, and there is little evidence of any correlated behavior when we consider 
only impulsive events. This is consistent with the poor correlations found in the event-to- 
event abundance variations for elements up to Fe (Reames et al. 1994). 

To summarize the heavy element abundances in impulsive events, we have aver- 
aged the element abundances over all of the 39 "large" impulsive-event periods, whether 
they had heavy elements or not. The average abundance enhancements of the elements in 
these events are shown in Figure 4 as sohd circles as functions of Z and of Q/A using the 
equilibrium Q at a temperature of -3 MK. Open circles in the Figure 4 supplement these 
measurements with the average enhancements of other elements determined in the same 
energy range in earlier studies of impulsive events (Reames et al. 1994; Reames 1995a, 
1999). Ionization states at a coronal temperature of -3 MK have been shown to organize 
element abundances in impulsive events (Reames et al. 1994). Values of g at a tempera- 
ture of -3 MK for the elements were found from Amaud & Rothenflug (1985) for Z< 26, 
from Amaud and Raymond (1992) for Z= 26 and from Post et al (1977) for Z>26. 



3.2 ''Large " Impulsive Events - Spectra 

Figure 5 shows energy spectra for "^He, C, O, Ne, Si, Fe, and for ions with 34<Z<40 
and 50<Z<56 in 3 of the large impulsive SEP events that have significant intensities of 
heavy elements. The spectra of different elements can be seen to differ in slope within a 
given event and to some extent they depart from a power law behavior. This is not sur- 
prising since theoretical spectra (Miller 1998) and theoretical fits to observations (Mason 
et al. 2003) have shown con:5)lex behavior. However, to illustrate the range of variation, 
we find least-squares power-law spectral indices for "^He, C, O, Ne, Si, Fe and 34<Z<40 
of -2.59±0.18, -3.10±0.12, -3.17±0.12, -3.33±0.16, 3.04±0.13, -2.77± 0.16, and - 
2.17±0.71, respectively in the 2001 April 14 event. The corresponding spectral indices 
for the 2002 August 20 event are -2.51±0.16, -2.15±0.08, -1.88±0.06, -1.93± 0.07, - 
1.91±0.06, -1.80±0.11, and -1.50±0.33. A difference in the spectra of different elements 
means that their relative abundances, and enhancements, will vary with energy. For these 
two events there is a tendency for (34<Z<40)/O to rise almost linearly with energy, al- 
though the errors in this determination are large. 

The sample spectra above show considerable variation in spectral slope among the 
species shown. In particular, they suggest that the spectrum of Fe can be harder than that 
of O in an event, and perhaps the spectra of heavier ions can be harder than the spectra of 
Fe. Measurement statistics do not allow us to study the systematic behavior of heavy 
element spectra, but we can con5)are the spectral indices of Fe and O in all 39 large im- 
pulsive events (see Table 1) as shown in Figure 6. Most events fell below the dashed 
diagonal line in the figxire showing that Fe spectra are systematically harder than O spec- 
tra. As the spectra become softer the points fall increasingly below the diagonal line, 
and the difference between Fe and O becomes greater. This trend is also shown by the 
soHd least-squares fit line. 

Armed with this information on the impulsive event spectra, we plot in Figure 7 the 
enhancement in (34<Z<40)/O, (50<Z<56)/O, and (76<Z<82)/0 abundances, relative to 
the corona, as a function of the Fe spectral index for the large impulsive events. For 
clarity, we have omitted from the figure events with abundances that are only upper Um- 
its or have large errors. A high degree of correlation is seen in the figure and the 
correlation coefficients increase as Z of the heavy elements increases. Poorer correlations 
are found when the spectral index of replaces that of Fe. 

Anticipating that steep spectra might be associated with small events with reduced 
energy input, we plot in the left panel of Figure 8 events with well-determined enhance- 
ment in (50<Z<56)/O V5. the Fe fluence. Of course, the fluence will depend upon how 
magnetically well connected the events are and in a few cases the time integration of Fe 
is truncated by the onset of a new event. Nevertheless, small events have greater en- 
hancements of (50<Z<56)/O. The enhancements are plotted vs. the NOAA/GOES soft 
X-ray peak flux for each event in the right panel of Figure 8. Most of the events come 
from C- and M-class flares. Soft X-rays represent heating of the flare plasma, and is 
more sensitive to acceleration of electrons than ions. Nevertheless, a substantial correla- 
tion is found here as well. Reames et al (1988) found a similar behavior for ^He/^He in 
impulsive events; ^He/^He decreased as hard and soft X-ray fluxes and Km type EI radio 
intensities increased. 



4. GRADUAL EVENTS 

For comparison with the impulsive events described above, we have selected a 
sample of large gradual events. Guided by Figure 1, we chose as gradual all events in 
which the intensity of 2.6-3.2 MeV amu"^ O exceeded 10'^ particles cm'^ sr'^ s"^ MeV"^ 
amu; 48 large events met this criterion. Properties of these events are shown in Table 2. 

Figure 9 shows intensities of various ion species and enhancements relative to cor- 
onal abundances for Fe/0, (34<Z<40)/O, and (50<Z<56)/O as a function of time during 
three gradual events. These events, from CME sources at three different solar longitudes, 
show enhancements in (34<Z<40)/O that are only modestly larger than those in Fe/0, and 
have a similar time dependence. Despite the high intensities of lighter ions in the large 
events in Figure 9, which exceed those of impulsive events by orders of magnitude (com- 
pare Figure 2), ions with Z>50 are sufficiently rare that we cannot follow their time 
dependence. Data leading to similar conclusions has been shown in other gradual events 
(Reames 2000; Reames et al. 2001). 

In Figure 10 we show the time-integrated heavy-element enhancements as a func- 
tion of the enhancement of Fe/0 for the sample of 48 large gradual SEP events defined 
above. Here the average enhancement factors are quite modest, in contrast with those for 
impulsive events shown in Figure 3. The (34<Z<40)/O enhancements shown in Figure 
10 are correlated with those of Fe/0 with a correlation coefficient, r=0.86, and the least- 
squares fit line passes close to the un-enhanced coronal abundances for both species. 
Strong correlation of element abundances in gradual SEP events is common (e.g. Reames 
1995a, 1999). The heavier elements in Figure 10 are sufficiently rare, despite the high 
fluence of Fe ions, that correlations cannot be established. Upper limits on the enhance- 
ments of Z>34 ions are suppressed in Figure 10, but are Hsted in Table 2; these limits 
confine the enhancements to very modest values. Analysis of the time evolution of the 
large gradual events suggest that some of the Z>50 ions arrive late in the events, after the 
time of shock passage when they might come from small impulsive SEP events that are 
otherwise obscured by high intensities of elements with Z<26 (an example occurs during 
the event of 2001 November 23 shown in Figure 9). 

5. DISCUSSION 

The overall pattem of the intensities of Fe and O and other species in the region of 
-1-10 MeV amu"^ supports the earher findings (Reames 1988) of a bimodal distribution 
reflecting both impulsive and gradual SEP events. The two classes of events are clearly 
present, although they are not fully resolved by Fe/O alone. These event classes, origi- 
nally distinguished by the time-scale of the associated soft X-ray events, have come to 
differentiate the effects of the physical mechanism of resonant stochastic acceleration in 
flares from that of shock acceleration at CME-driven shock waves (Reames 1999, 2002). 

Variations of abundances with energy may make patterns, that are obvious in our 
energy region, become obscured in other regions. Differences in the spectral indices of 
different species that we see will cause abundance variations to be greatly magnified at 
higher energies. When we attempt to re-plot Figure 1 using O and Fe intensities near 10 
MeV amu'\ we find that the distinction between impulsive and gradual events becomes 



blurred and loses its bimodal character. Therefore, abundances measured above 10 MeV 
amu'^ may be completely useless in distinguishing impulsive and gradual SEP events. 

There are certainly mechanisms that could blur the resolution of impulsive and 
gradual events at other energies. Below 1 MeV amu'\ abundances may be strongly af- 
fected by differing transport (e.g. Ng et aL 2003) and magnetic connections (Mazur et aL 
2000) during the long transit times of many hours or days from the source to the ob- 
server. Above 10 MeV amu'\ energy-dependent differences in the trapping and 
acceleration of ions in the soxxrce region must become important. Perhaps these same 
mechanisms cause the abundances to vary with energy as we observe. However, poor 
discrimination of impulsive and gradual events at other energies does not negate the bi- 
modal abundance pattern that we have seen for 3 solar cycles in the region of a few MeV 
amu'\ 

When we examine the heavy element events listed by Mason et al. (2004), we find 
that many of the events have low values of ^He/^He (<0.01) and Fe/0 (<0.5). We believe 
these are likely to be gradual events, although criteria may differ in the 0.1- 1.0 MeV 
amu' region. If we focus on the 9 events listed with positive measurements of 
(m>100)/Fe (amd enhancement factors of 600-5000), all have Fe/0>1 (1.49-4.55) and are 
surely impulsive events. Of these, 5 are also found on our list of 39 large impulsive 
events described above; the remaining 4 events show httle or no increase in Fe above 2 
MeV amu"^ suggesting that these events have sufficiently steep spectra that they are too 
small to be seen at high energies. The Mason et al. (2004) hst contains events with inten- 
sities of Fe >0.1 ions cm'^ sr"^ s"^ MeV^ amu above 100 keV amu'^ while our final list 
contains events with intensities of Fe >10^ ions cm'^ sr'^ s'^ MeV^ amu above 2 MeV 
amu"^ Small events with differential energy spectra steeper than ~E^ could be seen by 
Mason et aL (2004) but not by us. The 4 events on the Mason et aL (2004) list that are 
too steep to be seen by LEMT include the 3 highest values of (m>100)/Fe enhancement 
that they report, supporting our finding that the events with the steepest spectra have the 
greatest heavy element enhancements. The 5 events we have in common have Fe spec- 
tral indices between -1.8 and -3.4. 

Fe spectral indices of our 39 large impulsive events range from -1.8 to -4.4 with a 
mean value of -3.1. There is a correlation (r=0.81) between the (50<Z<56)/O enhance- 
ment and the Fe spectral index so that events with steeper Fe spectra have greater 
(50<Z<56)/O enhancements. Over the observed spectral range, enhancements vary from 
-10 to --lO"^ and a similar range of enhancements is seen for (76<Z<82)/0. Differences 
in spectra are an essential factor in the enhancement of heavy elements. Furthermore, 
small events, as measured by the Fe fluence, have greater enhancements. The Fe spectral 
index is only weakly correlated (r=0.46) with the Fe fluence for the 39 events. 

Fe fluence is one measure of impulsive event size and soft X-ray flux is another; 
both suggest that small events with less energy input have the greatest heavy-element en- 
hancements. A similar result was found for enhancements in ^He/^He (Reames et al 
1988). 

QuaUtatively the heavy element and spectral behavior may be understood based 
upon the model of cascading waves (e.g. Miller 1998) in which waves generated at long 
wavelengths (low wave nimiber k\ by magnetic reconnection in a flare, cascade toward 
higher k, passing through resonance with ions of increasing gyro frequency or Q/A as they 
go. When the energy in waves is low, most of it can be absorbed by the ions at highest Z 



10 



(lowest Q/A) causing greater enhancements, but steeper spectra, because of the limited 
available energy, especially at lower Z. In larger flares more energy is available to pro- 
duce harder spectra and wave absorption by the limited numbers of heavy ions is 
inadequate to stem the flood of cascading waves. Unfortunately, however, we do not yet 
have a quantitative model that explains the full range of observations. 

The above arguments suggest that saturation in the magnitude of heavy element 
enhancements becomes important as the flare energy increases. In the flare plasma, there 
are only --2 ions with 50<Z<56 for every 10^^ H ions (Grevesse & Sauval 1998). Ulti- 
mately, once all the Z>50 ions in the flare volume have been accelerated, additional 
energy can only go into lighter ions so the enhancements begin to decrease. This kind of 
saturation of heavy-element enhancements may explain why enhancements in 
(76<Z<82)/0 do not exceed those in (50<Z<56)/O. Depletion of ^He in the flare volume 
has been invoked to explain the systematic decrease in ^He/'^He in impulsive SEP events 
with increasing particle fluences (Reames 1999). With reasonable approximations, the 
number of energetic ^He ions in space was found to be a significant jfraction of the num- 
ber available in a flare volume. Although the abundance of ^He exceeds that of Z>50 
ions in the flare plasma, ^He is presumably accelerated preferentially because it resonates 
with electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves that peak near the ^He gyro frequency (Temerin 
& Roth 1992; Roth & Temerin 1997) while the acceleration of Z >50 ions involves cas- 
cading Alf^en turbulence. 

The strong coupling between spectra and abundances in impulsive SEP events, 
seen for both ^He (Mason et al. 2002) and for Z >50, seems to argue against a 2-phase 
process (e.g. Fisk 1978) where a selective heating mechanism determines the enhance- 
ments while a separate acceleration mechanism determines the spectra. The observations 
seem to favor acceleration and enhancement of all ions by a single resonant process, al- 
though different wave modes may resonate preferentially with different ions. 

6. CONCLUSIONS 

Element abundances of 2-10 MeV amu'^ ions from SEP events show a bimodal pat- 
tern reflecting the underlying contributions of impulsive and gradual SEP events that 
result from two different acceleration mechanisms. Flare-associated impulsive events 
have enhancements in ions with Z>50 by factors of 100-10,000, relative to coronal abun- 
dances while the corresponding enhancements in the shock-accelerated particles from 
gradual events are only 0.2- 20. 

The enhancements in Z>50 ions in impulsive events are uncorrelated with Fe/0 but 
are strongly correlated with the energy spectral index of Fe, with the Fe fluence, and with 
the soft X-ray flux from the flare. Smaller events and those with steeper energy spectra 
have greater heavy element enhancements. This suggests that when the flare energy 
available for acceleration is small, much of it is absorbed first by rare heavy elements 
(and ^He) leaving only enough to produce steep energy spectra for the more abundant 
ions. As the energy input increases, the supply of heavy elements is depleted and more 
energy flows into the abundant element species at higher Q/A, accelerating them in 
greater numbers with increasingly hard spectra. 

We thank G. M. Mason for helpftil discussions of the Mason et al. (2004) results.

FIGURE CAPTIONS 

Figure L In both panels, particle intensities of Fe are plotted vs, those of O for all 8-hour 
intervals in the 9-year study period where Fe and O are measurable. The indi- 
cated intensity of ACR O forms a lower bound on the O intensity during solar 
minimiuTL The symbols used for points in the upper panel indicate the average 
value of ^He/^He during each interval, as indicated in the scale to the right of the 
panel Symbols in the lower panel denote the (50<Z<56)/O abundance ratio 
shown in the right-hand scale. Lines drawn along Fe/0 =1 and 0.1, approxi- 
mately track the locus expected for impulsive and gradual SEP events. 

Figure 2, Intensities of various ion species v^. time are con:5)ared for 13 impulsive SEP 
events spanning a wide variety of intensities and element abxmdances (see text). 

Figure 3. The enhancements in the heavy elements abundance ratios (34<Z<40)/O, 
(50<Z<56)/O, and (76<Z<82)/0, relative to coronal abundance ratios, are shown 
vs. the corresponding enhancement in Fe/0 for a sanple of 39 large impulsive 
events. 

Figure 4, Abundance enhancements in average "large" impulsive events, relative to cor- 
onal abundances, are shown as a function of Z and of Q/A at -3 MK for the 
present (solid circles) study and for other elements measured in previous (open 
circles) studies (see text). 

Figure 5. Energy spectra are shown for "^He, C, O, Ne, Si, Fe, and for ions with 34<Z<40 
and 50<Z<56 in 3 impulsive SEP events with measurable heavy elements. 

Figure 6. A cross-plot of the absolute values of the power-law spectral indices of O and 
Fe is shown for the 39 large impulsive SEP events of our study. The least-squares 
fit line (solid) is shown and the diagonal line (dashed) identifies events with equal 
Fe and O spectral indices. The spectra of Fe tend to be flatter than those of O, es- 
pecially when both spectra are steep. 

Figure 7. The enhancements in the (34<Z<40)/O, (50<Z<56)/O, and (76<Z<82)/0, abun- 
dances, relative to the corona, are shown as a fimction of the Fe spectral index for 
the large impulsive events where the abundances are well determined. The corre- 
lation coefficients and least-squares fit lines are shown. 

Figure 8. The enhancements in the (50<Z<56)/O abundances are plotted as a fimction of 
the 2.4-3.2 MeV amu'^ fluence of Fe (left panel) and the GOES soft X ray peak 
flux (right panel) for the large impulsive events where the abundances are well 
determined. Least-squares fit lines and the correlation coefficients are shown. 

Figure 9, The upper panels show the intensities of three large gradual events as a func- 
tion of time. Lower panels show the enhancements in the abundance ratios Fe/0, 
(34<Z<40)/O, and (50<Z<56)/O, relative to coronal abundance ratios, vs. time. 

Figure 10. The enhancements in the heavy elements abundance ratios (34<Z<40)/O, 
(50<Z<56)/O, and (76<Z<82)/0, relative to coronal abundance ratios, are shown 
v^. the corresponding enhancement in Fe/O for a sample of 48 large gradual 
events. Correlation coefficient (r) and least squares fit line are shown in the lower 



18 



panel. Average enhancements are substantially smaller in these gradual events 
than in the impulsive events shown in Figure 3.
