Preface 



Introduction to Programming Using Java is a free introductory computer programming 
textbook that uses Java as the language of instruction. It is suitable for use in an introductory 
programming course and for people who are trying to learn programming on their own. There 
are no prerequisites beyond a general familiarity with the ideas of computers and programs. 
There is enough material for a full year of college-level programming. Chapters 1 through 7 
can be used as a textbook in a one-semester college-level course or in a year-long high school 
course. The remaining chapters can be covered in a second course. 

The Sixth Edition of the book covers "Java 5.0", along with a few features that were 
introduced in Java 6 and Java 7. While Java 5.0 introduced major new features that need to be 
covered in an introductory programming course, Java 6 and Java 7 did not. Whenever the text 
covers a feature that was not present in Java 5.0, that fact is explicitly noted. Note that Java 
applets appear throughout the pages of the on-line version of this book. Most of the applets 
require Java 5.0 or higher. 

The home web site for this book is http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/. The page at that 
address contains links for downloading a copy of the web site and for downloading PDF versions 
of the book.

In style, this is a textbook rather than a tutorial. That is, it concentrates on explaining 
concepts rather than giving step-by-step how-to-do-it guides. I have tried to use a conversational 
writing style that might be closer to classroom lecture than to a typical textbook. You'll find 
programming exercises at the end of each chapter, except for Chapter 1. For each exercise, 
there is a web page that gives a detailed solution for that exercise, with the sort of discussion 
that I would give if I presented the solution in class. (Solutions to the exercises can be found 
only in the web version of the textbook.) I strongly advise that you read the exercise solutions 
if you want to get the most out of this book. 

This is certainly not a Java reference book, and it is not a comprehensive survey of all 
the features of Java. It is not written as a quick introduction to Java for people who already 
know another programming language. Instead, it is directed mainly towards people who are 
learning programming for the first time, and it is as much about general programming concepts 
as it is about Java in particular. I believe that Introduction to Programming using Java is 
fully competitive with the conventionally published, printed programming textbooks that are 
available on the market. (Well, all right, I'll confess that I think it's better.) 

There are several approaches to teaching Java. One approach uses graphical user interface 
programming from the very beginning. Some people believe that object oriented programming 
should also be emphasized from the very beginning. This is not the approach that I take. The 
approach that I favor starts with the more basic building blocks of programming and builds 
from there. After an introductory chapter, I cover procedural programming in Chapters 2, 3, 
and 4. Object-oriented programming is introduced in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 covers the closely

related topic of event-oriented programming and graphical user interfaces. Arrays are covered 
in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 is a short chapter that marks a turning point in the book, moving 
beyond the fundamental ideas of programming to cover more advanced topics. Chapter 8 
is about writing robust, correct, and efficient programs. Chapters 9 and 10 cover recursion 
and data structures, including the Java Collection Framework. Chapter 11 is about files and 
networking. Chapter 12 covers threads and parallel processing. Finally, Chapter 13 returns 
to the topic of graphical user interface programming to cover some of Java's more advanced 
capabilities. 

* * * 

Major changes were made for the previous (fifth) edition of this book. Perhaps the most 
significant change was the use of parameterized types in the chapter on generic programming. 
Parameterized types — Java's version of templates — were the most eagerly anticipated new fea- 
ture in Java 5.0. Other new features in Java 5.0 were also introduced in the fifth edition, 
including enumerated types, formatted output, the Scanner class, and variable arity methods. 
In addition, Javadoc comments were covered for the first time. 

The changes in this sixth edition are much smaller. The major change is a new chapter 
on threads, Chapter 12. Material about threads from the previous edition has been moved to 
this chapter, and a good deal of new material has been added. Other changes include some 
coverage of features added to Java in versions 6 and 7 and the inclusion of a glossary. There 
are also smaller changes throughout the book.

Chapter 1 

Overview: The Mental Landscape 



When you begin a journey, it's a good idea to have a mental map of the terrain you'll 
be passing through. The same is true for an intellectual journey, such as learning to write 
computer programs. In this case, you'll need to know the basics of what computers are and 
how they work. You'll want to have some idea of what a computer program is and how one is 
created. Since you will be writing programs in the Java programming language, you'll want to 
know something about that language in particular and about the modern, networked computing 
environment for which Java is designed. 

As you read this chapter, don't worry if you can't understand everything in detail. (In fact, 
it would be impossible for you to learn all the details from the brief expositions in this chapter.) 
Concentrate on learning enough about the big ideas to orient yourself, in preparation for the 
rest of the book. Most of what is covered in this chapter will be covered in much greater detail 
later in the book. 

1.1 The Fetch and Execute Cycle: Machine Language 

A COMPUTER IS A COMPLEX SYSTEM consisting of many different components. But at the (online) 
heart — or the brain, if you want — of the computer is a single component that does the actual 
computing. This is the Central Processing Unit, or CPU. In a modern desktop computer, 
the CPU is a single "chip" on the order of one square inch in size. The job of the CPU is to 
execute programs. 

A program is simply a list of unambiguous instructions meant to be followed mechanically 
by a computer. A computer is built to carry out instructions that are written in a very simple 
type of language called machine language. Each type of computer has its own machine 
language, and the computer can directly execute a program only if the program is expressed in 
that language. (It can execute programs written in other languages if they are first translated 
into machine language.) 

When the CPU executes a program, that program is stored in the computer's main mem- 
ory (also called the RAM or random access memory). In addition to the program, memory 
can also hold data that is being used or processed by the program. Main memory consists of a 
sequence of locations. These locations are numbered, and the sequence number of a location 
is called its address. An address provides a way of picking out one particular piece of informa- 
tion from among the millions stored in memory. When the CPU needs to access the program 
instruction or data in a particular location, it sends the address of that information as a sig- 
nal to the memory; the memory responds by sending back the data contained in the specified 



1 



CHAPTER 1. THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE 



2 



location. The CPU can also store information in memory by specifying the information to be 
stored and the address of the location where it is to be stored. 

On the level of machine language, the operation of the CPU is fairly straightforward (al- 
though it is very complicated in detail). The CPU executes a program that is stored as a 
sequence of machine language instructions in main memory. It does this by repeatedly reading, 
or fetching, an instruction from memory and then carrying out, or executing, that instruc- 
tion. This process — fetch an instruction, execute it, fetch another instruction, execute it, and so 
on forever — is called the fetch- and- execute cycle. With one exception, which will be covered 
in the next section, this is all that the CPU ever does. 

The details of the fetch-and-execute cycle are not terribly important, but there are a few 
basic things you should know. The CPU contains a few internal registers, which are small 
memory units capable of holding a single number or machine language instruction. The CPU 
uses one of these registers — the program counter, or PC — to keep track of where it is in the 
program it is executing. The PC stores the address of the next instruction that the CPU should 
execute. At the beginning of each fetch-and-execute cycle, the CPU checks the PC to see which 
instruction it should fetch. During the course of the fetch-and-execute cycle, the number in the 
PC is updated to indicate the instruction that is to be executed in the next cycle. (Usually, 
but not always, this is just the instruction that sequentially follows the current instruction in 
the program.) 

* * * 

A computer executes machine language programs mechanically — that is without under- 
standing them or thinking about them — simply because of the way it is physically put together. 
This is not an easy concept. A computer is a machine built of millions of tiny switches called 
transistors, which have the property that they can be wired together in such a way that an 
output from one switch can turn another switch on or off. As a computer computes, these 
switches turn each other on or off in a pattern determined both by the way they are wired 
together and by the program that the computer is executing. 

Machine language instructions are expressed as binary numbers. A binary number is made 
up of just two possible digits, zero and one. So, a machine language instruction is just a sequence 
of zeros and ones. Each particular sequence encodes some particular instruction. The data that 
the computer manipulates is also encoded as binary numbers. A computer can work directly 
with binary numbers because switches can readily represent such numbers: Turn the switch on 
to represent a one; turn it off to represent a zero. Machine language instructions are stored 
in memory as patterns of switches turned on or off. When a machine language instruction 
is loaded into the CPU, all that happens is that certain switches are turned on or off in the 
pattern that encodes that particular instruction. The CPU is built to respond to this pattern 
by executing the instruction it encodes; it does this simply because of the way all the other 
switches in the CPU are wired together. 

So, you should understand this much about how computers work: Main memory holds 
machine language programs and data. These are encoded as binary numbers. The CPU fetches 
machine language instructions from memory one after another and executes them. It does 
this mechanically, without thinking about or understanding what it does — and therefore the 
program it executes must be perfect, complete in all details, and unambiguous because the CPU 
can do nothing but execute it exactly as written. Here is a schematic view of this first-stage 
understanding of the computer:

1.2 Asynchronous Events: Polling Loops and Interrupts 

The CPU SPENDS ALMOST ALL of its time fetching instructions from memory and executing (online) 
them. However, the CPU and main memory are only two out of many components in a real 
computer system. A complete system contains other devices such as: 

• A hard disk for storing programs and data files. (Note that main memory holds only 
a comparatively small amount of information, and holds it only as long as the power is 
turned on. A hard disk is used for permanent storage of larger amounts of information, 
but programs have to be loaded from disk into main memory before they can actually be 
executed.) 

• A keyboard and mouse for user input. 

• A monitor and printer which can be used to display the computer's output. 

• An audio output device that allows the computer to play sounds. 

• A network interface that allows the computer to communicate with other computers 
that are connected to it on a network, either wirelessly or by wire. 

• A scanner that converts images into coded binary numbers that can be stored and 
manipulated on the computer. 

The list of devices is entirely open ended, and computer systems are built so that they can 
easily be expanded by adding new devices. Somehow the CPU has to communicate with and 
control all these devices. The CPU can only do this by executing machine language instructions 
(which is all it can do, period). The way this works is that for each device in a system, there 
is a device driver, which consists of software that the CPU executes when it has to deal 
with the device. Installing a new device on a system generally has two steps: plugging the 
device physically into the computer, and installing the device driver software. Without the 
device driver, the actual physical device would be useless, since the CPU would not be able to 
communicate with it. 



* * * 



CHAPTER 1. THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE

A computer system consisting of many devices is typically organized by connecting those 
devices to one or more busses. A bus is a set of wires that carry various sorts of information 
between the devices connected to those wires. The wires carry data, addresses, and control 
signals. An address directs the data to a particular device and perhaps to a particular register 
or location within that device. Control signals can be used, for example, by one device to alert 
another that data is available for it on the data bus. A fairly simple computer system might 
be organized like this:

Now, devices such as keyboard, mouse, and network interface can produce input that needs 
to be processed by the CPU. How does the CPU know that the data is there? One simple idea, 
which turns out to be not very satisfactory, is for the CPU to keep checking for incoming data 
over and over. Whenever it finds data, it processes it. This method is called polling, since 
the CPU polls the input devices continually to see whether they have any input data to report. 
Unfortunately, although polling is very simple, it is also very inefficient. The CPU can waste 
an awful lot of time just waiting for input. 

To avoid this inefficiency, interrupts are often used instead of polling. An interrupt is 
a signal sent by another device to the CPU. The CPU responds to an interrupt signal by 
putting aside whatever it is doing in order to respond to the interrupt. Once it has handled 
the interrupt, it returns to what it was doing before the interrupt occurred. For example, when 
you press a key on your computer keyboard, a keyboard interrupt is sent to the CPU. The 
CPU responds to this signal by interrupting what it is doing, reading the key that you pressed, 
processing it, and then returning to the task it was performing before you pressed the key. 

Again, you should understand that this is a purely mechanical process: A device signals an 
interrupt simply by turning on a wire. The CPU is built so that when that wire is turned on, 
the CPU saves enough information about what it is currently doing so that it can return to 
the same state later. This information consists of the contents of important internal registers 
such as the program counter. Then the CPU jumps to some predetermined memory location 
and begins executing the instructions stored there. Those instructions make up an interrupt 
handler that does the processing necessary to respond to the interrupt. (This interrupt handler 
is part of the device driver software for the device that signalled the interrupt.) At the end of 



CHAPTER 1. THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE 



5 



the interrupt handler is an instruction that tells the CPU to jump back to what it was doing; 
it does that by restoring its previously saved state. 

Interrupts allow the CPU to deal with asynchronous events. In the regular fetch-and- 
execute cycle, things happen in a predetermined order; everything that happens is "synchro- 
nized" with everything else. Interrupts make it possible for the CPU to deal efficiently with 
events that happen "asynchronously," that is, at unpredictable times. 

As another example of how interrupts are used, consider what happens when the CPU needs 
to access data that is stored on the hard disk. The CPU can access data directly only if it is 
in main memory. Data on the disk has to be copied into memory before it can be accessed. 
Unfortunately, on the scale of speed at which the CPU operates, the disk drive is extremely 
slow. When the CPU needs data from the disk, it sends a signal to the disk drive telling it 
to locate the data and get it ready. (This signal is sent synchronously, under the control of 
a regular program.) Then, instead of just waiting the long and unpredictable amount of time 
that the disk drive will take to do this, the CPU goes on with some other task. When the disk 
drive has the data ready, it sends an interrupt signal to the CPU. The interrupt handler can 
then read the requested data. 

* * * 

Now, you might have noticed that all this only makes sense if the CPU actually has several 
tasks to perform. If it has nothing better to do, it might as well spend its time polling for input 
or waiting for disk drive operations to complete. All modern computers use multitasking to 
perform several tasks at once. Some computers can be used by several people at once. Since the 
CPU is so fast, it can quickly switch its attention from one user to another, devoting a fraction 
of a second to each user in turn. This application of multitasking is called timesharing. But a 
modern personal computer with just a single user also uses multitasking. For example, the user 
might be typing a paper while a clock is continuously displaying the time and a file is being 
downloaded over the network. 

Each of the individual tasks that the CPU is working on is called a thread. (Or a process; 
there are technical differences between threads and processes, but they are not important here, 
since it is threads that are used in Java.) Many CPUs can literally execute more than one 
thread simultaneously — such CPUs contain multiple "cores," each of which can run a thread — 
but there is always a limit on the number of threads that can be executed at the same time. 
Since there are often more threads than can be executed simultaneously, the computer has to be 
able switch its attention from one thread to another, just as a timesharing computer switches 
its attention from one user to another. In general, a thread that is being executed will continue 
to run until one of several things happens: 

• The thread might voluntarily yield control, to give other threads a chance to run. 

• The thread might have to wait for some asynchronous event to occur. For example, the 
thread might request some data from the disk drive, or it might wait for the user to press 
a key. While it is waiting, the thread is said to be blocked, and other threads, if any, have 
a chance to run. When the event occurs, an interrupt will "wake up" the thread so that 
it can continue running. 

• The thread might use up its allotted slice of time and be suspended to allow other threads 
to run. Not all computers can "forcibly" suspend a thread in this way; those that can 
are said to use preemptive multitasking. To do preemptive multitasking, a computer 
needs a special timer device that generates an interrupt at regular intervals, such as 100 
times per second. When a timer interrupt occurs, the CPU has a chance to switch from 



CHAPTER 1. THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE 



6 



one thread to another, whether the thread that is currently running likes it or not. All 
modern desktop and laptop computers use preemptive multitasking. 

Ordinary users, and indeed ordinary programmers, have no need to deal with interrupts and 
interrupt handlers. They can concentrate on the different tasks or threads that they want the 
computer to perform; the details of how the computer manages to get all those tasks done are 
not important to them. In fact, most users, and many programmers, can ignore threads and 
multitasking altogether. However, threads have become increasingly important as computers 
have become more powerful and as they have begun to make more use of multitasking and 
multiprocessing. In fact, the ability to work with threads is fast becoming an essential job skill 
for programmers. Fortunately, Java has good support for threads, which are built into the Java 
programming language as a fundamental programming concept. Programming with threads 
will be covered in Chapter 12. 

Just as important in Java and in modern programming in general is the basic concept of 
asynchronous events. While programmers don't actually deal with interrupts directly, they do 
often find themselves writing event handlers, which, like interrupt handlers, are called asyn- 
chronously when specific events occur. Such "event-driven programming" has a very different 
feel from the more traditional straight-through, synchronous programming. We will begin with 
the more traditional type of programming, which is still used for programming individual tasks, 
but we will return to threads and events later in the text, starting in Chapter 6 

* * * 

By the way, the software that does all the interrupt handling, handles communication with 
the user and with hardware devices, and controls which thread is allowed to run is called the 
operating system. The operating system is the basic, essential software without which a 
computer would not be able to function. Other programs, such as word processors and World 
Wide Web browsers, are dependent upon the operating system. Common operating systems 
include Linux, Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Mac OS. 

1.3 The Java Virtual Machine 

Machine language consists of very simple instructions that can be executed directly by (online) 
the CPU of a computer. Almost all programs, though, are written in high-level programming 
languages such as Java, Pascal, or C++. A program written in a high-level language cannot 
be run directly on any computer. First, it has to be translated into machine language. This 
translation can be done by a program called a compiler. A compiler takes a high-level-language 
program and translates it into an executable machine-language program. Once the translation 
is done, the machine-language program can be run any number of times, but of course it can only 
be run on one type of computer (since each type of computer has its own individual machine 
language). If the program is to run on another type of computer it has to be re-translated, 
using a different compiler, into the appropriate machine language. 

There is an alternative to compiling a high-level language program. Instead of using a 
compiler, which translates the program all at once, you can use an interpreter, which translates 
it instruction-by-instruction, as necessary. An interpreter is a program that acts much like a 
CPU, with a kind of fetch-and-execute cycle. In order to execute a program, the interpreter 
runs in a loop in which it repeatedly reads one instruction from the program, decides what is 
necessary to carry out that instruction, and then performs the appropriate machine-language 
commands to do so. 



CHAPTER 1. THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE 



7 



One use of interpreters is to execute high-level language programs. For example, the pro- 
gramming language Lisp is usually executed by an interpreter rather than a compiler. However, 
interpreters have another purpose: they can let you use a machine-language program meant 
for one type of computer on a completely different type of computer. For example, there is a 
program called "Virtual PC" that runs on Mac OS computers. Virtual PC is an interpreter that 
executes machine-language programs written for IBM-PC-clone computers. If you run Virtual 
PC on your Mac OS, you can run any PC program, including programs written for Windows. 
(Unfortunately, a PC program will run much more slowly than it would on an actual IBM 
clone. The problem is that Virtual PC executes several Mac OS machine-language instructions 
for each PC machine-language instruction in the program it is interpreting. Compiled programs 
are inherently faster than interpreted programs.) 

* * * 

The designers of Java chose to use a combination of compilation and interpretation. Pro- 
grams written in Java are compiled into machine language, but it is a machine language for 
a computer that doesn't really exist. This so-called "virtual" computer is known as the Java 
Virtual Machine, or JVM. The machine language for the Java Virtual Machine is called Java 
bytecode. There is no reason why Java bytecode couldn't be used as the machine language of a 
real computer, rather than a virtual computer. But in fact the use of a virtual machine makes 
possible one of the main selling points of Java: the fact that it can actually be used on any 
computer. All that the computer needs is an interpreter for Java bytecode. Such an interpreter 
simulates the JVM in the same way that Virtual PC simulates a PC computer. (The term JVM 
is also used for the Java bytecode interpreter program that does the simulation, so we say that 
a computer needs a JVM in order to run Java programs. Technically, it would be more correct 
to say that the interpreter implements the JVM than to say that it is a JVM.) 

Of course, a different Java bytecode interpreter is needed for each type of computer, but 
once a computer has a Java bytecode interpreter, it can run any Java bytecode program. And 
the same Java bytecode program can be run on any computer that has such an interpreter. 
This is one of the essential features of Java: the same compiled program can be run on many 
different types of computers.

Why, you might wonder, use the intermediate Java bytecode at all? Why not just distribute 
the original Java program and let each person compile it into the machine language of whatever 
computer they want to run it on? There are many reasons. First of all, a compiler has to 
understand Java, a complex high-level language. The compiler is itself a complex program. A 
Java bytecode interpreter, on the other hand, is a fairly small, simple program. This makes it 
easy to write a bytecode interpreter for a new type of computer; once that is done, that computer

8 



can run any compiled Java program. It would be much harder to write a Java compiler for the 
same computer. 

Furthermore, many Java programs are meant to be downloaded over a network. This leads 
to obvious security concerns: you don't want to download and run a program that will damage 
your computer or your files. The bytecode interpreter acts as a buffer between you and the 
program you download. You are really running the interpreter, which runs the downloaded 
program indirectly. The interpreter can protect you from potentially dangerous actions on the 
part of that program. 

When Java was still a new language, it was criticized for being slow: Since Java bytecode was 
executed by an interpreter, it seemed that Java bytecode programs could never run as quickly 
as programs compiled into native machine language (that is, the actual machine language of the 
computer on which the program is running). However, this problem has been largely overcome 
by the use of just-in-time compilers for executing Java bytecode. A just-in-time compiler 
translates Java bytecode into native machine language. It does this while it is executing the 
program. Just as for a normal interpreter, the input to a just-in-time compiler is a Java bytecode 
program, and its task is to execute that program. But as it is executing the program, it also 
translates parts of it into machine language. The translated parts of the program can then be 
executed much more quickly than they could be interpreted. Since a given part of a program is 
often executed many times as the program runs, a just-in-time compiler can significantly speed 
up the overall execution time. 

I should note that there is no necessary connection between Java and Java bytecode. A pro- 
gram written in Java could certainly be compiled into the machine language of a real computer. 
And programs written in other languages could be compiled into Java bytecode. However, it is 
the combination of Java and Java bytecode that is platform-independent, secure, and network- 
compatible while allowing you to program in a modern high-level object-oriented language. 

(In the past few years, it has become fairly common to create new programming languages, 
or versions of old languages, that compile into Java bytecode. The compiled bytecode programs 
can then be executed by a standard JVM. New languages that have been developed specifically 
for programming the JVM include Groovy, Clojure, and Processing. Jython and JRuby are 
versions of older languages, Python and Ruby, that target the JVM. These languages make it 
possible to enjoy many of the advantages of the JVM while avoiding some of the technicalities 
of the Java language. In fact, the use of other languages with the JVM has become important 
enough that several new features have been added to the JVM in Java Version 7 specifically to 
add better support for some of those languages.) 

* * * 

I should also note that the really hard part of platform-independence is providing a "Graph- 
ical User Interface" — with windows, buttons, etc. — that will work on all the platforms that 
support Java. You'll see more about this problem in Section 1.6. 

1.4 Fundamental Building Blocks of Programs 

There are two basic aspects of programming: data and instructions. To work with (online) 
data, you need to understand variables and types; to work with instructions, you need to 
understand control structures and subroutines. You'll spend a large part of the course 
becoming familiar with these concepts. 

A variable is just a memory location (or several locations treated as a unit) that has been 
given a name so that it can be easily referred to and used in a program. The programmer only 



CHAPTER 1. THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE 



9 



has to worry about the name; it is the compiler's responsibility to keep track of the memory 
location. The programmer does need to keep in mind that the name refers to a kind of "box" 
in memory that can hold data, even if the programmer doesn't have to know where in memory 
that box is located. 

In Java and in many other programming languages, a variable has a type that indicates 
what sort of data it can hold. One type of variable might hold integers — whole numbers such as 
3, -7, and — while another holds floating point numbers — numbers with decimal points such as 
3.14, -2.7, or 17.0. (Yes, the computer does make a distinction between the integer 17 and the 
floating-point number 17.0; they actually look quite different inside the computer.) There could 
also be types for individual characters ('A', ';', etc.), strings ("Hello", "A string can include 
many characters", etc.), and less common types such as dates, colors, sounds, or any other kind 
of data that a program might need to store. 

Programming languages always have commands for getting data into and out of variables 
and for doing computations with data. For example, the following "assignment statement," 
which might appear in a Java program, tells the computer to take the number stored in the 
variable named "principal", multiply that number by 0.07, and then store the result in the 
variable named "interest": 

interest = principal * 0.07; 

There are also "input commands" for getting data from the user or from files on the computer's 
disks and "output commands" for sending data in the other direction. 

These basic commands — for moving data from place to place and for performing 
computations — are the building blocks for all programs. These building blocks are combined 
into complex programs using control structures and subroutines. 

* * * 

A program is a sequence of instructions. In the ordinary "flow of control," the computer 
executes the instructions in the sequence in which they appear, one after the other. However, 
this is obviously very limited: the computer would soon run out of instructions to execute. 
Control structures are special instructions that can change the flow of control. There are 
two basic types of control structure: loops, which allow a sequence of instructions to be repeated 
over and over, and branches, which allow the computer to decide between two or more different 
courses of action by testing conditions that occur as the program is running. 

For example, it might be that if the value of the variable "principal" is greater than 10000, 
then the "interest" should be computed by multiplying the principal by 0.05; if not, then the 
interest should be computed by multiplying the principal by 0.04. A program needs some 
way of expressing this type of decision. In Java, it could be expressed using the following "if 
statement" : 

if (principal > 10000) 

interest = principal * 0.05; 

else 

interest = principal * 0.04; 

(Don't worry about the details for now. Just remember that the computer can test a condition 
and decide what to do next on the basis of that test.) 

Loops are used when the same task has to be performed more than once. For example, 
if you want to print out a mailing label for each name on a mailing list, you might say, "Get 
the first name and address and print the label; get the second name and address and print 
the label; get the third name and address and print the label. . . " But this quickly becomes 



CHAPTER 1. THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE 



10 



ridiculous — and might not work at all if you don't know in advance how many names there are. 
What you would like to say is something like "While there are more names to process, get the 
next name and address, and print the label." A loop can be used in a program to express such 
repetition. 

* * * 

Large programs are so complex that it would be almost impossible to write them if there 
were not some way to break them up into manageable "chunks." Subroutines provide one way to 
do this. A subroutine consists of the instructions for performing some task, grouped together 
as a unit and given a name. That name can then be used as a substitute for the whole set of 
instructions. For example, suppose that one of the tasks that your program needs to perform 
is to draw a house on the screen. You can take the necessary instructions, make them into 
a subroutine, and give that subroutine some appropriate name — say, "drawHouseQ" . Then 
anyplace in your program where you need to draw a house, you can do so with the single 
command: 

drawHouseQ ; 

This will have the same effect as repeating all the house-drawing instructions in each place. 

The advantage here is not just that you save typing. Organizing your program into sub- 
routines also helps you organize your thinking and your program design effort. While writing 
the house-drawing subroutine, you can concentrate on the problem of drawing a house without 
worrying for the moment about the rest of the program. And once the subroutine is written, 
you can forget about the details of drawing houses — that problem is solved, since you have a 
subroutine to do it for you. A subroutine becomes just like a built-in part of the language which 
you can use without thinking about the details of what goes on "inside" the subroutine. 

* * * 

Variables, types, loops, branches, and subroutines are the basis of what might be called 
"traditional programming." However, as programs become larger, additional structure is needed 
to help deal with their complexity. One of the most effective tools that has been found is object- 
oriented programming, which is discussed in the next section. 

1.5 Objects and Object-oriented Programming 

PROGRAMS MUST be DESIGNED. No one can just sit down at the computer and compose a (online) 
program of any complexity. The discipline called software engineering is concerned with 
the construction of correct, working, well- written programs. The software engineer tries to 
use accepted and proven methods for analyzing the problem to be solved and for designing a 
program to solve that problem. 

During the 1970s and into the 80s, the primary software engineering methodology was 
structured programming. The structured programming approach to program design was 
based on the following advice: To solve a large problem, break the problem into several pieces 
and work on each piece separately; to solve each piece, treat it as a new problem which can itself 
be broken down into smaller problems; eventually, you will work your way down to problems 
that can be solved directly, without further decomposition. This approach is called top-down 
programming . 

There is nothing wrong with top-down programming. It is a valuable and often-used ap- 
proach to problem-solving. However, it is incomplete. For one thing, it deals almost entirely 
with producing the instructions necessary to solve a problem. But as time went on, people 



CHAPTER 1. THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE 



11 



realized that the design of the data structures for a program was at least as important as the 
design of subroutines and control structures. Top-down programming doesn't give adequate 
consideration to the data that the program manipulates. 

Another problem with strict top-down programming is that it makes it difficult to reuse 
work done for other projects. By starting with a particular problem and subdividing it into 
convenient pieces, top-down programming tends to produce a design that is unique to that 
problem. It is unlikely that you will be able to take a large chunk of programming from another 
program and fit it into your project, at least not without extensive modification. Producing 
high-quality programs is difficult and expensive, so programmers and the people who employ 
them are always eager to reuse past work. 

* * * 

So, in practice, top-down design is often combined with bottom-up design. In bottom-up 
design, the approach is to start "at the bottom," with problems that you already know how to 
solve (and for which you might already have a reusable software component at hand). From 
there, you can work upwards towards a solution to the overall problem. 

The reusable components should be as "modular" as possible. A module is a component of a 
larger system that interacts with the rest of the system in a simple, well-defined, straightforward 
manner. The idea is that a module can be "plugged into" a system. The details of what goes on 
inside the module are not important to the system as a whole, as long as the module fulfills its 
assigned role correctly. This is called information hiding , and it is one of the most important 
principles of software engineering. 

One common format for software modules is to contain some data, along with some sub- 
routines for manipulating that data. For example, a mailing-list module might contain a list of 
names and addresses along with a subroutine for adding a new name, a subroutine for printing 
mailing labels, and so forth. In such modules, the data itself is often hidden inside the module; 
a program that uses the module can then manipulate the data only indirectly, by calling the 
subroutines provided by the module. This protects the data, since it can only be manipulated 
in known, well-defined ways. And it makes it easier for programs to use the module, since they 
don't have to worry about the details of how the data is represented. Information about the 
representation of the data is hidden. 

Modules that could support this kind of information-hiding became common in program- 
ming languages in the early 1980s. Since then, a more advanced form of the same idea has 
more or less taken over software engineering. This latest approach is called object-oriented 
programming, often abbreviated as OOP. 

The central concept of object-oriented programming is the object, which is a kind of module 
containing data and subroutines. The point-of-view in OOP is that an object is a kind of self- 
sufficient entity that has an internal state (the data it contains) and that can respond to 
messages (calls to its subroutines). A mailing list object, for example, has a state consisting 
of a list of names and addresses. If you send it a message telling it to add a name, it will 
respond by modifying its state to reflect the change. If you send it a message telling it to print 
itself, it will respond by printing out its list of names and addresses. 

The OOP approach to software engineering is to start by identifying the objects involved in 
a problem and the messages that those objects should respond to. The program that results is 
a collection of objects, each with its own data and its own set of responsibilities. The objects 
interact by sending messages to each other. There is not much "top-down" in the large-scale 
design of such a program, and people used to more traditional programs can have a hard time 
getting used to OOP. However, people who use OOP would claim that object-oriented programs 



CHAPTER 1. THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE 



12 



tend to be better models of the way the world itself works, and that they are therefore easier 
to write, easier to understand, and more likely to be correct. 

* * * 

You should think of objects as "knowing" how to respond to certain messages. Different 
objects might respond to the same message in different ways. For example, a "print" message 
would produce very different results, depending on the object it is sent to. This property of 
objects — that different objects can respond to the same message in different ways — is called 
polymorphism . 

It is common for objects to bear a kind of "family resemblance" to one another. Objects 
that contain the same type of data and that respond to the same messages in the same way 
belong to the same class. (In actual programming, the class is primary; that is, a class is 
created and then one or more objects are created using that class as a template.) But objects 
can be similar without being in exactly the same class. 

For example, consider a drawing program that lets the user draw lines, rectangles, ovals, 
polygons, and curves on the screen. In the program, each visible object on the screen could be 
represented by a software object in the program. There would be five classes of objects in the 
program, one for each type of visible object that can be drawn. All the lines would belong to 
one class, all the rectangles to another class, and so on. These classes are obviously related; 
all of them represent "drawable objects." They would, for example, all presumably be able to 
respond to a "draw yourself message. Another level of grouping, based on the data needed 
to represent each type of object, is less obvious, but would be very useful in a program: We 
can group polygons and curves together as "multipoint objects," while lines, rectangles, and 
ovals are "two-point objects." (A line is determined by its endpoints, a rectangle by two of its 
corners, and an oval by two corners of the rectangle that contains it.) We could diagram these 
relationships as follows: 



DrawableObject 



MultipointObject 


TwoPointObject 






Polygon Curve Line 


Rectangle 



DrawableObject, MultipointObject, and TwoPointObject would be classes in the program. 
MultipointObject and TwoPointObject would be subclasses of DrawableObject. The class 
Line would be a subclass of TwoPointObject and (indirectly) of DrawableObject. A subclass of 
a class is said to inherit the properties of that class. The subclass can add to its inheritance and 
it can even "override" part of that inheritance (by defining a different response to some method). 
Nevertheless, lines, rectangles, and so on are drawable objects, and the class DrawableObject 
expresses this relationship. 

Inheritance is a powerful means for organizing a program. It is also related to the problem 
of reusing software components. A class is the ultimate reusable component. Not only can it 
be reused directly if it fits exactly into a program you are trying to write, but if it just almost 



CHAPTER 1. THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE 



13 



fits, you can still reuse it by denning a subclass and making only the small changes necessary 
to adapt it exactly to your needs. 

So, OOP is meant to be both a superior program-development tool and a partial solution 
to the software reuse problem. Objects, classes, and object-oriented programming will be 
important themes throughout the rest of this text. You will start using objects that are built 
into the Java language in the next chapter, and in Chapter 5 you will begin creating your own 
classes and objects. 

1.6 The Modern User Interface 

When computers were first introduced, ordinary people — including most programmers — (online) 
couldn't get near them. They were locked up in rooms with white-coated attendants who would 
take your programs and data, feed them to the computer, and return the computer's response 
some time later. When timesharing — where the computer switches its attention rapidly from 
one person to another — was invented in the 1960s, it became possible for several people to 
interact directly with the computer at the same time. On a timesharing system, users sit at 
"terminals" where they type commands to the computer, and the computer types back its re- 
sponse. Early personal computers also used typed commands and responses, except that there 
was only one person involved at a time. This type of interaction between a user and a computer 
is called a command-line interface. 

Today, of course, most people interact with computers in a completely different way. They 
use a Graphical User Interface, or GUI. The computer draws interface components on the 
screen. The components include things like windows, scroll bars, menus, buttons, and icons. 
Usually, a mouse is used to manipulate such components. Assuming that you have not just 
been teleported in from the 1970s, you are no doubt already familiar with the basics of graphical 
user interfaces! 

A lot of GUI interface components have become fairly standard. That is, they have similar 
appearance and behavior on many different computer platforms including Mac OS, Windows, 
and Linux. Java programs, which are supposed to run on many different platforms without 
modification to the program, can use all the standard GUI components. They might vary a 
little in appearance from platform to platform, but their functionality should be identical on 
any computer on which the program runs. 

Shown below is an image of a very simple Java program — actually an "applet" , since it is 
meant to appear on a Web page — that shows a few standard GUI interface components. There 
are four components that the user can interact with: a button, a checkbox, a text field, and a 
pop-up menu. These components are labeled. There are a few other components in the applet. 
The labels themselves are components (even though you can't interact with them). The right 
half of the applet is a text area component, which can display multiple lines of text. And a 
scrollbar component appears alongside the text area when the number of lines of text becomes 
larger than will fit in the text area. And in fact, in Java terminology, the whole applet is itself 
considered to be a "component."

Now, Java actually has two complete sets of GUI components. One of these, the AWT or 
Abstract Windowing Toolkit, was available in the original version of Java. The other, which 
is known as Swing, is included in Java version 1.2 or later, and is used in preference to the 
AWT in most modern Java programs. The applet that is shown above uses components that 
are part of Swing. If Java is not installed in your Web browser or if your browser uses a very old 
version of Java, you might get an error when the browser tries to load the applet. Remember 
that most of the applets in this textbook require Java 5.0 (or higher). 

When a user interacts with the GUI components in this applet, an "event" is generated. 
For example, clicking a push button generates an event, and pressing return while typing in a 
text field generates an event. Each time an event is generated, a message is sent to the applet 
telling it that the event has occurred, and the applet responds according to its program. In 
fact, the program consists mainly of "event handlers" that tell the applet how to respond to 
various types of events. In this example, the applet has been programmed to respond to each 
event by displaying a message in the text area. In a more realistic example, the event handlers 
would have more to do. 

The use of the term "message" here is deliberate. Messages, as you saw in the previous sec- 
tion, are sent to objects. In fact, Java GUI components are implemented as objects. Java 
includes many predefined classes that represent various types of GUI components. Some of 
these classes are subclasses of others. Here is a diagram showing some of Swing's GUI classes 
and their relationships: 







JComboBox 




J Scroll bar 




JTextComponent 




Don't worry about the details for now, but try to get some feel about how object-oriented 
programming and inheritance are used here. Note that all the GUI classes are subclasses, 
directly or indirectly, of a class called JComponent, which represents general properties that are 
shared by all Swing components. Two of the direct subclasses of JComponent themselves have 
subclasses. The classes JTextArea and JTextField, which have certain behaviors in common, 
are grouped together as subclasses of JTextComponent. Similarly JButton and JToggleButton 



CHAPTER 1. THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE 



15 



are subclasses of JAbstractButton, which represents properties common to both buttons and 
checkboxes. (JComboBox, by the way, is the Swing class that represents pop- up menus.) 

Just from this brief discussion, perhaps you can see how GUI programming can make effec- 
tive use of object-oriented design. In fact, GUI's, with their "visible objects," are probably a 
major factor contributing to the popularity of OOP. 

Programming with GUI components and events is one of the most interesting aspects of 
Java. However, we will spend several chapters on the basics before returning to this topic in 
Chapter 6. 

1.7 The Internet and Beyond 

Computers can be connected together on networks. A computer on a network can (online) 
communicate with other computers on the same network by exchanging data and files or by 
sending and receiving messages. Computers on a network can even work together on a large 
computation. 

Today, millions of computers throughout the world are connected to a single huge network 
called the Internet. New computers are being connected to the Internet every day, both 
by wireless communication and by physical connection using technologies such as DSL, cable 
modems, or Ethernet. 

There are elaborate protocols for communication over the Internet. A protocol is simply a 
detailed specification of how communication is to proceed. For two computers to communicate 
at all, they must both be using the same protocols. The most basic protocols on the Internet are 
the Internet Protocol (IP), which specifies how data is to be physically transmitted from one 
computer to another, and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which ensures that 
data sent using IP is received in its entirety and without error. These two protocols, which are 
referred to collectively as TCP/IP, provide a foundation for communication. Other protocols 
use TCP/IP to send specific types of information such as web pages, electronic mail, and data 
files. 

All communication over the Internet is in the form of packets. A packet consists of some 
data being sent from one computer to another, along with addressing information that indicates 
where on the Internet that data is supposed to go. Think of a packet as an envelope with an 
address on the outside and a message on the inside. (The message is the data.) The packet 
also includes a "return address," that is, the address of the sender. A packet can hold only 
a limited amount of data; longer messages must be divided among several packets, which are 
then sent individually over the net and reassembled at their destination. 

Every computer on the Internet has an IP address, a number that identifies it uniquely 
among all the computers on the net. The IP address is used for addressing packets. A computer 
can only send data to another computer on the Internet if it knows that computer's IP address. 
Since people prefer to use names rather than numbers, most computers are also identified by 
names, called domain names. For example, the main computer of the Mathematics Depart- 
ment at Hobart and William Smith Colleges has the domain name math.hws.edu. (Domain 
names are just for convenience; your computer still needs to know IP addresses before it can 
communicate. There are computers on the Internet whose job it is to translate domain names 
to IP addresses. When you use a domain name, your computer sends a message to a domain 
name server to find out the corresponding IP address. Then, your computer uses the IP address, 
rather than the domain name, to communicate with the other computer.) 

The Internet provides a number of services to the computers connected to it (and, of course, 



CHAPTER 1. THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE 



16 



to the users of those computers). These services use TCP/IP to send various types of data over 
the net. Among the most popular services are instant messaging, file sharing, electronic mail, 
and the World-Wide Web. Each service has its own protocols, which are used to control 
transmission of data over the network. Each service also has some sort of user interface, which 
allows the user to view, send, and receive data through the service. 

For example, the email service uses a protocol known as SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer 
Protocol) to transfer email messages from one computer to another. Other protocols, such as 
POP and IMAP, are used to fetch messages from an email account so that the recipient can 
read them. A person who uses email, however, doesn't need to understand or even know about 
these protocols. Instead, they are used behind the scenes by computer programs to send and 
receive email messages. These programs provide the user with an easy-to-use user interface to 
the underlying network protocols. 

The World-Wide Web is perhaps the most exciting of network services. The World-Wide 
Web allows you to request pages of information that are stored on computers all over the 
Internet. A Web page can contain links to other pages on the same computer from which it 
was obtained or to other computers anywhere in the world. A computer that stores such pages 
of information is called a web server. The user interface to the Web is the type of program 
known as a web browser. Common web browsers include Internet Explorer and Firefox. You 
use a Web browser to request a page of information. The browser sends a request for that 
page to the computer on which the page is stored, and when a response is received from that 
computer, the web browser displays it to you in a neatly formatted form. A web browser is just 
a user interface to the Web. Behind the scenes, the web browser uses a protocol called HTTP 
(HyperText Transfer Protocol) to send each page request and to receive the response from the 
web server. 

* * * 

Now just what, you might be thinking, does all this have to do with Java? In fact, Java 
is intimately associated with the Internet and the World-Wide Web. As you have seen in the 
previous section, special Java programs called applets are meant to be transmitted over the 
Internet and displayed on Web pages. A Web server transmits a Java applet just as it would 
transmit any other type of information. A Web browser that understands Java — that is, that 
includes an interpreter for the Java Virtual Machine — can then run the applet right on the Web 
page. Since applets are programs, they can do almost anything, including complex interaction 
with the user. With Java, a Web page becomes more than just a passive display of information. 
It becomes anything that programmers can imagine and implement. 

But applets are only one aspect of Java's relationship with the Internet, and not the major 
one. In fact, as both Java and the Internet have matured, applets have become much less 
important. At the same time, however, Java has increasingly been used to write complex, 
stand-alone applications that do not depend on a Web browser. Many of these programs are 
network- related. For example many of the largest and most complex web sites use web server 
software that is written in Java. Java includes excellent support for network protocols, and 
its platform independence makes it possible to write network programs that work on many 
different types of computer. You will learn about Java's network support in Chapter 11. 

Its association with the Internet is not Java's only advantage. But many good programming 
languages have been invented only to be soon forgotten. Java has had the good luck to ride on 
the coattails of the Internet's immense and increasing popularity. 

* * * 

As Java has matured, its applications have reached far beyond the Net. The standard version 



CHAPTER 1. THE MENTAL LANDSCAPE 



17 



of Java already comes with support for many technologies, such as cryptography and data 
compression. Free extensions are available to support many other technologies such as advanced 
sound processing and three-dimensional graphics. Complex, high-performance systems can be 
developed in Java. For example, Hadoop, a system for large scale data processing, is written in 
Java. Hadoop is used by Yahoo, Facebook, and other Web sites to process the huge amounts 
of data generated by their users. 

Furthermore, Java is not restricted to use on traditional computers. Java can be used to 
write programs for many smartphones (though not for the iPhone). It is the primary develop- 
ment language for Blackberries and Android-based phones such as the Verizon Droid. Mobile 
devices such as smartphones use a version of Java called Java ME ("Mobile Edition"). It's 
the same basic language as the standard edition, but the set of classes that is included as a 
standard part of the language is different. Java ME is also the programming language for the 
Amazon Kindle eBook reader and for interactive features on Blu-Ray video disks. 

At this time, Java certainly ranks as one of the most widely used programming languages. 
It is a good choice for almost any programming project that is meant to run on more than one 
type of computing device, and is a reasonable choice even for many programs that will run on 
only one device. It is probably the most widely taught language at Colleges and Universities. 
It is similar enough to other popular languages, such as C, C++, and C#, that knowing it 
will give you a good start on learning those languages as well. Overall, learning Java is a great 
starting point on the road to becoming an expert programmer. I hope you enjoy the journey!

Chapter 2 



Programming in the Small I: 
Names and Things 

On A BASIC level (the level of machine language), a computer can perform only very simple 
operations. A computer performs complex tasks by stringing together large numbers of such 
operations. Such tasks must be "scripted" in complete and perfect detail by programs. Creating 
complex programs will never be really easy, but the difficulty can be handled to some extent by 
giving the program a clear overall structure. The design of the overall structure of a program 
is what I call "programming in the large." 

Programming in the small, which is sometimes called coding, would then refer to filling in 
the details of that design. The details are the explicit, step-by-step instructions for performing 
fairly small-scale tasks. When you do coding, you are working fairly "close to the machine," 
with some of the same concepts that you might use in machine language: memory locations, 
arithmetic operations, loops and branches. In a high-level language such as Java, you get to 
work with these concepts on a level several steps above machine language. However, you still 
have to worry about getting all the details exactly right. 

This chapter and the next examine the facilities for programming in the small in the Java 
programming language. Don't be misled by the term "programming in the small" into thinking 
that this material is easy or unimportant. This material is an essential foundation for all types 
of programming. If you don't understand it, you can't write programs, no matter how good 
you get at designing their large-scale structure. 

The last section of this chapter discusses programming environments. That section 
contains information about how to compile and run Java programs, and you might want to 
take a look at it before trying to write and use your own programs. 

2.1 The Basic Java Application 

A PROGRAM IS A SEQUENCE of instructions that a computer can execute to perform some (online) 
task. A simple enough idea, but for the computer to make any use of the instructions, they 
must be written in a form that the computer can use. This means that programs have to be 
written in programming languages. Programming languages differ from ordinary human 
languages in being completely unambiguous and very strict about what is and is not allowed 
in a program. The rules that determine what is allowed are called the syntax of the language. 
Syntax rules specify the basic vocabulary of the language and how programs can be constructed 
using things like loops, branches, and subroutines. A syntactically correct program is one that 



19 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



20 



can be successfully compiled or interpreted; programs that have syntax errors will be rejected 
(hopefully with a useful error message that will help you fix the problem). 

So, to be a successful programmer, you have to develop a detailed knowledge of the syntax 
of the programming language that you are using. However, syntax is only part of the story. It's 
not enough to write a program that will run — you want a program that will run and produce 
the correct result! That is, the meaning of the program has to be right. The meaning of a 
program is referred to as its semantics . A semantically correct program is one that does what 
you want it to. 

Furthermore, a program can be syntactically and semantically correct but still be a pretty 
bad program. Using the language correctly is not the same as using it well. For example, a 
good program has "style." It is written in a way that will make it easy for people to read and 
to understand. It follows conventions that will be familiar to other programmers. And it has 
an overall design that will make sense to human readers. The computer is completely oblivious 
to such things, but to a human reader, they are paramount. These aspects of programming are 
sometimes referred to as pragmatics. 

When I introduce a new language feature, I will explain the syntax, the semantics, and 
some of the pragmatics of that feature. You should memorize the syntax; that's the easy part. 
Then you should get a feeling for the semantics by following the examples given, making sure 
that you understand how they work, and maybe writing short programs of your own to test 
your understanding. And you should try to appreciate and absorb the pragmatics — this means 
learning how to use the language feature well, with style that will earn you the admiration of 
other programmers. 

Of course, even when you've become familiar with all the individual features of the language, 
that doesn't make you a programmer. You still have to learn how to construct complex programs 
to solve particular problems. For that, you'll need both experience and taste. You'll find hints 
about software development throughout this textbook. 

* * * 

We begin our exploration of Java with the problem that has become traditional for such 
beginnings: to write a program that displays the message "Hello World!". This might seem like 
a trivial problem, but getting a computer to do this is really a big first step in learning a new 
programming language (especially if it's your first programming language). It means that you 
understand the basic process of: 

1. getting the program text into the computer, 

2. compiling the program, and 

3. running the compiled program. 

The first time through, each of these steps will probably take you a few tries to get right. I 
won't go into the details here of how you do each of these steps; it depends on the particular 
computer and Java programming environment that you are using. See Section 2.6 for informa- 
tion about creating and running Java programs in specific programming environments. But in 
general, you will type the program using some sort of text editor and save the program in a file. 
Then, you will use some command to try to compile the file. You'll either get a message that the 
program contains syntax errors, or you'll get a compiled version of the program. In the case of 
Java, the program is compiled into Java bytecode, not into machine language. Finally, you can 
run the compiled program by giving some appropriate command. For Java, you will actually use 
an interpreter to execute the Java bytecode. Your programming environment might automate 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



21 



some of the steps for you — for example, the compilation step is often done automatically — but 
you can be sure that the same three steps are being done in the background. 

Here is a Java program to display the message "Hello World!". Don't expect to understand 
what's going on here just yet; some of it you won't really understand until a few chapters from 
now: 

// A program to display the message 
// "Hello World!" on standard output 

public class HelloWorld { 

public static void main(String [] args) { 
System. out. printlnC'Hello World! ") ; 

> 

} // end of class HelloWorld 

The command that actually displays the message is: 

System. out. printlnC'Hello World! ") ; 

This command is an example of a subroutine call statement. It uses a "built-in subroutine" 
named System, out .print In to do the actual work. Recall that a subroutine consists of the 
instructions for performing some task, chunked together and given a name. That name can be 
used to "call" the subroutine whenever that task needs to be performed. A built-in subroutine 
is one that is already defined as part of the language and therefore automatically available for 
use in any program. 

When you run this program, the message "Hello World!" (without the quotes) will be 
displayed on standard output. Unfortunately, I can't say exactly what that means! Java is 
meant to run on many different platforms, and standard output will mean different things on 
different platforms. However, you can expect the message to show up in some convenient place. 
(If you use a commanddine interface, like that in Oracle's Java Development Kit, you type in 
a command to tell the computer to run the program. The computer will type the output from 
the program, Hello World!, on the next line. In an integrated development environment such 
as Eclipse, the output might appear somewhere in one of the environment's windows.) 

You must be curious about all the other stuff in the above program. Part of it consists of 
comments. Comments in a program are entirely ignored by the computer; they are there for 
human readers only. This doesn't mean that they are unimportant. Programs are meant to be 
read by people as well as by computers, and without comments, a program can be very difficult 
to understand. Java has two types of comments. The first type, used in the above program, 
begins with // and extends to the end of a line. The computer ignores the // and everything 
that follows it on the same line. Java has another style of comment that can extend over many 
lines. That type of comment begins with /* and ends with */. 

Everything else in the program is required by the rules of Java syntax. All programming in 
Java is done inside "classes." The first line in the above program (not counting the comments) 
says that this is a class named HelloWorld. "HelloWorld," the name of the class, also serves as 
the name of the program. Not every class is a program. In order to define a program, a class 
must include a subroutine named main, with a definition that takes the form: 

public static void main(String [] args) { 
(statements ) 

} 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



22 



When you tell the Java interpreter to run the program, the interpreter calls this main() 
subroutine, and the statements that it contains are executed. These statements make up the 
script that tells the computer exactly what to do when the program is executed. The main() 
routine can call subroutines that are defined in the same class or even in other classes, but it is 
the mainQ routine that determines how and in what order the other subroutines are used. 

The word "public" in the first line of main ( ) means that this routine can be called from out- 
side the program. This is essential because the main() routine is called by the Java interpreter, 
which is something external to the program itself. The remainder of the first line of the routine 
is harder to explain at the moment; for now, just think of it as part of the required syntax. 
The definition of the subroutine — that is, the instructions that say what it does — consists of 
the sequence of "statements" enclosed between braces, { and }. Here, I've used (statements) as 
a placeholder for the actual statements that make up the program. Throughout this textbook, 
I will always use a similar format: anything that you see in (this style of text) (italic in angle 
brackets) is a placeholder that describes something you need to type when you write an actual 
program. 

As noted above, a subroutine can't exist by itself. It has to be part of a "class" . A program 
is defined by a public class that takes the form: 

public class (program-name) { 

(optional-variable-declarations-and-subroutines ) 

public static void main (String [] args) { 
(statements ) 

> 

(optional-variable-declarations-and-subroutines ) 

} 

The name on the first line is the name of the program, as well as the name of the class. 
(Remember, again, that (program-name) is a placeholder for the actual name!) If the name of 
the class is Hello World, then the class must be saved in a file called HelloWorld. java. When 
this file is compiled, another file named HelloWorld. class will be produced. This class file, 
HelloWorld. class, contains the translation of the program into Java bytecode, which can be 
executed by a Java interpreter. HelloWorld. java is called the source code for the program. 
To execute the program, you only need the compiled class file, not the source code. 

The layout of the program on the page, such as the use of blank lines and indentation, is 
not part of the syntax or semantics of the language. The computer doesn't care about layout — 
you could run the entire program together on one line as far as it is concerned. However, 
layout is important to human readers, and there are certain style guidelines for layout that are 
followed by most programmers. These style guidelines are part of the pragmatics of the Java 
programming language. 

Also note that according to the above syntax specification, a program can contain other 
subroutines besides main(), as well as things called "variable declarations." You'll learn more 
about these later, but not until Chapter 4. 

2.2 Variables and the Primitive Types 

Names are fundamental to programming. In programs, names are used to refer to many (online) 
different sorts of things. In order to use those things, a programmer must understand the rules 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



23 



for giving names to things and the rules for using the names to work with those things. That 
is, the programmer must understand the syntax and the semantics of names. 

According to the syntax rules of Java, a name is a sequence of one or more characters. It must 
begin with a letter or underscore and must consist entirely of letters, digits, and underscores. 
("Underscore" refers to the character '_'.) For example, here are some legal names: 

N n rate xl5 quite_a_long_name HelloWorld 

No spaces are allowed in identifiers; HelloWorld is a legal identifier, but "Hello World" is 
not. Upper case and lower case letters are considered to be different, so that HelloWorld, 
helloworld, HELLOWORLD, and hElloWorLD are all distinct names. Certain names are reserved 
for special uses in Java, and cannot be used by the programmer for other purposes. These 
reserved words include: class, public, static, if, else, while, and several dozen other 
words. 

Java is actually pretty liberal about what counts as a letter or a digit. Java uses the 
Unicode character set, which includes thousands of characters from many different languages 
and different alphabets, and many of these characters count as letters or digits. However, I will 
be sticking to what can be typed on a regular English keyboard. 

The pragmatics of naming includes style guidelines about how to choose names for things. 
For example, it is customary for names of classes to begin with upper case letters, while names 
of variables and of subroutines begin with lower case letters; you can avoid a lot of confusion 
by following the same convention in your own programs. Most Java programmers do not use 
underscores in names, although some do use them at the beginning of the names of certain kinds 
of variables. When a name is made up of several words, such as HelloWorld or interestRate, 
it is customary to capitalize each word, except possibly the first; this is sometimes referred 
to as camel case, since the upper case letters in the middle of a name are supposed to look 
something like the humps on a camel's back. 

Finally, I'll note that things are often referred to by compound names which consist 
of several ordinary names separated by periods. (Compound names are also called qualified 
names.) You've already seen an example: System, out .println. The idea here is that things 
in Java can contain other things. A compound name is a kind of path to an item through one 
or more levels of containment. The name System, out .println indicates that something called 
"System" contains something called "out" which in turn contains something called "println". 
Non-compound names are called simple identifiers. I'll use the term identifier to refer to 
any name — simple or compound — that can be used to refer to something in Java. (Note that 
the reserved words are not identifiers, since they can't be used as names for things.) 

2.2.1 Variables 

Programs manipulate data that are stored in memory. In machine language, data can only 
be referred to by giving the numerical address of the location in memory where it is stored. 
In a high-level language such as Java, names are used instead of numbers to refer to data. It 
is the job of the computer to keep track of where in memory the data is actually stored; the 
programmer only has to remember the name. A name used in this way — to refer to data stored 
in memory — is called a variable. 

Variables are actually rather subtle. Properly speaking, a variable is not a name for the 
data itself but for a location in memory that can hold data. You should think of a variable as 
a container or box where you can store data that you will need to use later. The variable refers 
directly to the box and only indirectly to the data in the box. Since the data in the box can 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



24 



change, a variable can refer to different data values at different times during the execution of 
the program, but it always refers to the same box. Confusion can arise, especially for beginning 
programmers, because when a variable is used in a program in certain ways, it refers to the 
container, but when it is used in other ways, it refers to the data in the container. You'll see 
examples of both cases below. 

(In this way, a variable is something like the title, "The President of the United States." 
This title can refer to different people at different times, but it always refers to the same office. 
If I say "the President is playing basketball," I mean that Barack Obama is playing basketball. 
But if I say "Sarah Palin wants to be President" I mean that she wants to fill the office, not 
that she wants to be Barack Obama.) 

In Java, the only way to get data into a variable — that is, into the box that the variable 
names — is with an assignment statement. An assignment statement takes the form: 

(variable) = (expression); 

where (expression) represents anything that refers to or computes a data value. When the 
computer comes to an assignment statement in the course of executing a program, it evaluates 
the expression and puts the resulting data value into the variable. For example, consider the 
simple assignment statement 

rate = 0.07; 

The (variable) in this assignment statement is rate, and the (expression) is the number 0.07. 
The computer executes this assignment statement by putting the number 0.07 in the variable 
rate, replacing whatever was there before. Now, consider the following more complicated 
assignment statement, which might come later in the same program: 

interest = rate * principal; 

Here, the value of the expression "rate * principal" is being assigned to the variable 
interest. In the expression, the * is a "multiplication operator" that tells the computer 
to multiply rate times principal. The names rate and principal are themselves variables, 
and it is really the values stored in those variables that are to be multiplied. We see that when 
a variable is used in an expression, it is the value stored in the variable that matters; in this 
case, the variable seems to refer to the data in the box, rather than to the box itself. When 
the computer executes this assignment statement, it takes the value of rate, multiplies it by 
the value of principal, and stores the answer in the box referred to by interest. When a 
variable is used on the left-hand side of an assignment statement, it refers to the box that is 
named by the variable. 

(Note, by the way, that an assignment statement is a command that is executed by the 
computer at a certain time. It is not a statement of fact. For example, suppose a program 
includes the statement "rate = 0.07;". If the statement "interest = rate * principal;" 
is executed later in the program, can we say that the principal is multiplied by 0.07? No! 
The value of rate might have been changed in the meantime by another statement. The 
meaning of an assignment statement is completely different from the meaning of an equation 
in mathematics, even though both use the symbol "=".) 

2.2.2 Types and Literals 

A variable in Java is designed to hold only one particular type of data; it can legally hold that 
type of data and no other. The compiler will consider it to be a syntax error if you try to 
violate this rule. We say that Java is a strongly typed language because it enforces this rule. 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



25 



There are eight so-called primitive types built into Java. The primitive types are named 
byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean. The first four types hold integers 
(whole numbers such as 17, -38477, and 0). The four integer types are distinguished by the 
ranges of integers they can hold. The float and double types hold real numbers (such as 3.6 and 
-145.99). Again, the two real types are distinguished by their range and accuracy. A variable 
of type char holds a single character from the Unicode character set. And a variable of type 
boolean holds one of the two logical values true or false. 

Any data value stored in the computer's memory must be represented as a binary number, 
that is as a string of zeros and ones. A single zero or one is called a bit. A string of eight 
bits is called a byte. Memory is usually measured in terms of bytes. Not surprisingly, the byte 
data type refers to a single byte of memory. A variable of type byte holds a string of eight 
bits, which can represent any of the integers between -128 and 127, inclusive. (There are 256 
integers in that range; eight bits can represent 256 — two raised to the power eight — different 
values.) As for the other integer types, 

• short corresponds to two bytes (16 bits). Variables of type short have values in the range 
-32768 to 32767. 

• int corresponds to four bytes (32 bits). Variables of type int have values in the range 
-2147483648 to 2147483647. 

• long corresponds to eight bytes (64 bits). Variables of type long have values in the range 
-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. 

You don't have to remember these numbers, but they do give you some idea of the size of 
integers that you can work with. Usually, for representing integer data you should just stick to 
the int data type, which is good enough for most purposes. 

The float data type is represented in four bytes of memory, using a standard method for 
encoding real numbers. The maximum value for a float is about 10 raised to the power 38. 
A float can have about 7 significant digits. (So that 32.3989231134 and 32.3989234399 would 
both have to be rounded off to about 32.398923 in order to be stored in a variable of type 
float.) A double takes up 8 bytes, can range up to about 10 to the power 308, and has about 
15 significant digits. Ordinarily, you should stick to the double type for real values. 

A variable of type char occupies two bytes in memory. The value of a char variable is a 
single character such as A, *, x, or a space character. The value can also be a special character 
such a tab or a carriage return or one of the many Unicode characters that come from different 
languages. When a character is typed into a program, it must be surrounded by single quotes; 
for example: 'A', or 'x'. Without the quotes, A would be an identifier and * would be a 
multiplication operator. The quotes are not part of the value and are not stored in the variable; 
they are just a convention for naming a particular character constant in a program. 

A name for a constant value is called a literal. A literal is what you have to type in a 
program to represent a value. 'A' and are literals of type char, representing the character 
values A and *. Certain special characters have special literals that use a backslash, \, as an 
"escape character" . In particular, a tab is represented as ' \t ' , a carriage return as ' \r ' , a 
linefeed as ' \n ' , the single quote character as ' \ ' ' , and the backslash itself as ' \\ ' . Note that 
even though you type two characters between the quotes in ' \t ' , the value represented by this 
literal is a single tab character. 

Numeric literals are a little more complicated than you might expect. Of course, there 
are the obvious literals such as 317 and 17.42. But there are other possibilities for expressing 
numbers in a Java program. First of all, real numbers can be represented in an exponential 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



26 



form such as 1.3el2 or 12.3737e-108. The "el2" and "e-108" represent powers of 10, so that 
1.3el2 means 1.3 times 10 12 and 12.3737e-108 means 12.3737 times 10~ 108 . This format can 
be used to express very large and very small numbers. Any numerical literal that contains a 
decimal point or exponential is a literal of type double. To make a literal of type float, you 
have to append an "F" or "f to the end of the number. For example, "1.2F" stands for 1.2 
considered as a value of type float. (Occasionally, you need to know this because the rules of 
Java say that you can't assign a value of type double to a variable of type float, so you might be 
confronted with a ridiculous-seeming error message if you try to do something like "x = 1.2;" 
when x is a variable of type float. You have to say "x = 1 . 2F ; " . This is one reason why I 
advise sticking to type double for real numbers.) 

Even for integer literals, there are some complications. Ordinary integers such as 177777 
and -32 are literals of type byte, short, or int, depending on their size. You can make a literal 
of type long by adding "L" as a suffix. For example: 17L or 728476874368L. As another 
complication, Java allows octal (base-8) and hexadecimal (base- 16) literals. I don't want to 
cover base-8 and base- 16 in detail, but in case you run into them in other people's programs, 
it's worth knowing a few things: Octal numbers use only the digits through 7. In Java, a 
numeric literal that begins with a is interpreted as an octal number; for example, the literal 
045 represents the number 37, not the number 45. Hexadecimal numbers use 16 digits, the 
usual digits through 9 and the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F. Upper case and lower case letters 
can be used interchangeably in this context. The letters represent the numbers 10 through 15. 
In Java, a hexadecimal literal begins with Ox or OX, as in 0x45 or 0xFF7A. 

Hexadecimal numbers are also used in character literals to represent arbitrary Unicode 
characters. A Unicode literal consists of \u followed by four hexadecimal digits. For example, 
the character literal , \u00E9 ) represents the Unicode character that is an "e" with an acute 
accent. 

Java 7 introduces a couple of minor improvements in numeric literals. First of all, nu- 
meric literals in Java 7 can include the underscore character ("_"), which can be used to 
separate groups of digits. For example, the integer constant for one billion could be writ- 
ten 1_000_000_000, which is a good deal easier to decipher than 1000000000. There is no rule 
about how many digits have to be in each group. Java 7 also supports binary numbers, using 
the digits and 1 and the prefix 0b (or 0B). For example: OblOllO or 0bl010_1100_1011. 

For the type boolean, there are precisely two literals: true and false. These literals are 
typed just as I've written them here, without quotes, but they represent values, not variables. 
Boolean values occur most often as the values of conditional expressions. For example, 

rate > 0.05 

is a boolean-valued expression that evaluates to true if the value of the variable rate is greater 
than 0.05, and to false if the value of rate is not greater than 0.05. As you'll see in Chapter 3, 
boolean-valued expressions are used extensively in control structures. Of course, boolean values 
can also be assigned to variables of type boolean. 

Java has other types in addition to the primitive types, but all the other types represent 
objects rather than "primitive" data values. For the most part, we are not concerned with 
objects for the time being. However, there is one predefined object type that is very important: 
the type String. A String is a sequence of characters. You've already seen a string literal: 
"Hello World!". The double quotes are part of the literal; they have to be typed in the 
program. However, they are not part of the actual string value, which consists of just the 
characters between the quotes. Within a string, special characters can be represented using 
the backslash notation. Within this context, the double quote is itself a special character. For 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



27 



example, to represent the string value 

I said, "Are you listening!" 
with a linefeed at the end, you would have to type the string literal: 

"I said, V'Are you listening ! \"\n" 

You can also use \t, \r, \\, and Unicode sequences such as \u00E9 to represent other 
special characters in string literals. Because strings are objects, their behavior in programs is 
peculiar in some respects (to someone who is not used to objects). I'll have more to say about 
them in the next section. 

2.2.3 Variables in Programs 

A variable can be used in a program only if it has first been declared. A variable declaration 
statement is used to declare one or more variables and to give them names. When the computer 
executes a variable declaration, it sets aside memory for the variable and associates the variable's 
name with that memory. A simple variable declaration takes the form: 

(type-name ) (variable-name-or-names ) ; 

The (variable-name-or-names) can be a single variable name or a list of variable names 
separated by commas. (We'll see later that variable declaration statements can actually be 
somewhat more complicated than this.) Good programming style is to declare only one variable 
in a declaration statement, unless the variables are closely related in some way. For example: 

int numberOf Students ; 
String name ; 
double x, y; 
boolean isFinished; 

char f irstlnitial , middlelnitial , lastlnitial; 

It is also good style to include a comment with each variable declaration to explain its 
purpose in the program, or to give other information that might be useful to a human reader. 
For example: 

double principal; // Amount of money invested. 

double interestRate ; // Rate as a decimal, not percentage. 

In this chapter, we will only use variables declared inside the main() subroutine of a pro- 
gram. Variables declared inside a subroutine are called local variables for that subroutine. 
They exist only inside the subroutine, while it is running, and are completely inaccessible from 
outside. Variable declarations can occur anywhere inside the subroutine, as long as each variable 
is declared before it is used in any expression. Some people like to declare all the variables at 
the beginning of the subroutine. Others like to wait to declare a variable until it is needed. My 
preference: Declare important variables at the beginning of the subroutine, and use a comment 
to explain the purpose of each variable. Declare "utility variables" which are not important to 
the overall logic of the subroutine at the point in the subroutine where they are first used. Here 
is a simple program using some variables and assignment statements: 

/** 

* This class implements a simple program that 

* will compute the amount of interest that is 

* earned on $17,000 invested at an interest 

* rate of 0.07 for one year. The interest and 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



28 



* the value of the investment after one year are 

* printed to standard output . 
*/ 



public class Interest { 



public static void main (String [] args) { 



/* Declare the variables. */ 



double principal; 
double rate; 
double interest; 



// The value of the investment. 
// The annual interest rate. 
// Interest earned in one year. 



/* Do the computations. */ 

principal = 17000; 
rate = 0.07; 

interest = principal * rate; // Compute the interest. 

principal = principal + interest; 

// Compute value of investment after one year, with interest. 
// (Note: The new value replaces the old value of principal.) 

/* Output the results. */ 

System. out .print ("The interest earned is $"); 
System. out .println(interest) ; 

System. out .print ("The value of the investment after one year is $"); 
System. out .println (principal) ; 

} // end of mainO 

y II end of class Interest 



This program uses several subroutine call statements to display information to the user of the 
program. Two different subroutines are used: System, out .print and System, out .println. 
The difference between these is that System, out .println adds a linefeed after the end of the 
information that it displays, while System, out .print does not. Thus, the value of interest, 
which is displayed by the subroutine call "System. out .println(interest) ;", follows on the 
same line after the string displayed by the previous System, out .print statement. Note that 
the value to be displayed by System, out .print or System, out .println is provided in paren- 
theses after the subroutine name. This value is called a parameter to the subroutine. A 
parameter provides a subroutine with information it needs to perform its task. In a subroutine 
call statement, any parameters are listed in parentheses after the subroutine name. Not all 
subroutines have parameters. If there are no parameters in a subroutine call statement, the 
subroutine name must be followed by an empty pair of parentheses. 

All the sample programs for this textbook are available in separate source code files in the 
on-line version of this text at http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/source. They are also included 
in the downloadable archives of the web site. The source code for the Interest program, for 
example, can be found in the file Interest.java. 



2.3 Strings, Objects, Enums, and Subroutines 



The previous section introduced the eight primitive data types and the type String. There (online) 
is a fundamental difference between the primitive types and the String type: Values of type 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



29 



String are objects. While we will not study objects in detail until Chapter 5, it will be useful 
for you to know a little about them and about a closely related topic: classes. This is not 
just because strings are useful but because objects and classes are essential to understanding 
another important programming concept, subroutines. 

Another reason for considering classes and objects at this point is so that we can introduce 
enums. An enum is a data type that can be created by a Java programmer to represent a 
small collection of possible values. Technically, an enum is a class and its possible values are 
objects. Enums will be our first example of adding a new type to the Java language. We will 
look at them later in this section. 

2.3.1 Built-in Subroutines and Functions 

Recall that a subroutine is a set of program instructions that have been chunked together and 
given a name. In Chapter 4, you'll learn how to write your own subroutines, but you can 
get a lot done in a program just by calling subroutines that have already been written for 
you. In Java, every subroutine is contained in a class or in an object. Some classes that are 
standard parts of the Java language contain predefined subroutines that you can use. A value 
of type String, which is an object, contains subroutines that can be used to manipulate that 
string. These subroutines are "built into" the Java language. You can call all these subroutines 
without understanding how they were written or how they work. Indeed, that's the whole point 
of subroutines: A subroutine is a "black box" which can be used without knowing what goes 
on inside. 

Classes in Java have two very different functions. First of all, a class can group together 
variables and subroutines that are contained in that class. These variables and subroutines 
are called static members of the class. You've seen one example: In a class that defines a 
program, the main() routine is a static member of the class. The parts of a class definition that 
define static members are marked with the reserved word "static" , just like the main() routine 
of a program. However, classes have a second function. They are used to describe objects. In 
this role, the class of an object specifies what subroutines and variables are contained in that 
object. The class is a type — in the technical sense of a specification of a certain type of data 
value — and the object is a value of that type. For example, String is actually the name of a 
class that is included as a standard part of the Java language. String is also a type, and literal 
strings such as "Hello World" represent values of type String. 

So, every subroutine is contained either in a class or in an object. Classes contain sub- 
routines, which are called static member subroutines. Classes also describe objects and the 
subroutines that are contained in those objects. 

This dual use can be confusing, and in practice most classes are designed to perform pri- 
marily or exclusively in only one of the two possible roles. For example, although the String 
class does contain a few rarely-used static member subroutines, it exists mainly to specify a 
large number of subroutines that are contained in objects of type String. Another standard 
class, named Math, exists entirely to group together a number of static member subroutines 
that compute various common mathematical functions. 

* * * 

To begin to get a handle on all of this complexity, let's look at the subroutine 
System. out. print as an example. As you have seen earlier in this chapter, this subroutine 
is used to display information to the user. For example, System, out .print ("Hello World") 
displays the message, Hello World. 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



30 



System is one of Java's standard classes. One of the static member variables in this class is 
named out. Since this variable is contained in the class System, its full name — which you have 
to use to refer to it in your programs — is System. out. The variable System. out refers to an 
object, and that object in turn contains a subroutine named print. The compound identifier 
System. out. print refers to the subroutine print in the object out in the class System. 

(As an aside, I will note that the object referred to by System, out is an object of the class 
PrintStream. PrintStream is another class that is a standard part of Java. Any object of type 
PrintStream is a destination to which information can be printed; any object of type PrintStream 
has a print subroutine that can be used to send information to that destination. The object 
System. out is just one possible destination, and System, out .print is the subroutine that 
sends information to that particular destination. Other objects of type PrintStream might send 
information to other destinations such as files or across a network to other computers. This is 
object-oriented programming: Many different things which have something in common — they 
can all be used as destinations for information — can all be used in the same way — through a 
print subroutine. The PrintStream class expresses the commonalities among all these objects.) 

Since class names and variable names are used in similar ways, it might be hard to tell 
which is which. Remember that all the built-in, predefined names in Java follow the rule 
that class names begin with an upper case letter while variable names begin with a lower case 
letter. While this is not a formal syntax rule, I strongly recommend that you follow it in your 
own programming. Subroutine names should also begin with lower case letters. There is no 
possibility of confusing a variable with a subroutine, since a subroutine name in a program is 
always followed by a left parenthesis. 

As one final general note, you should be aware that subroutines in Java are often referred to 
as methods. Generally, the term "method" means a subroutine that is contained in a class or 
in an object. Since this is true of every subroutine in Java, every subroutine in Java is a method 
(with one very technical exception). The same is not true for other programming languages. 
Nevertheless, the term "method" is mostly used in the context of object-oriented programming, 
and until we start doing real object-oriented programming in Chapter 5, I will prefer to use the 
more general term, "subroutine." However, I should note that some people prefer to use the 
term "method" from the beginning. 

* * * 

Classes can contain static member subroutines, as well as static member variables. For 
example, the System class contains a subroutine named exit. In a program, of course, this 
subroutine must be referred to as System. exit. Calling this subroutine will terminate the 
program. You could use it if you had some reason to terminate the program before the end 
of the main routine. For historical reasons, this subroutine takes an integer as a parameter, 
so the subroutine call statement might look like "System. exit (0) ;" or "System. exit (1) ;". 
(The parameter tells the computer why the program was terminated. A parameter value of 
indicates that the program ended normally. Any other value indicates that the program was 
terminated because an error was detected. But in practice, the value of the parameter is usually 
ignored.) 

Every subroutine performs some specific task. For some subroutines, that task is to compute 
or retrieve some data value. Subroutines of this type are called functions. We say that a 
function returns a value. Generally, the returned value is meant to be used somehow in the 
program. 

You are familiar with the mathematical function that computes the square root of a num- 
ber. Java has a corresponding function called Math.sqrt. This function is a static member 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



31 



subroutine of the class named Math. If x is any numerical value, then Math.sqrt(x) computes 
and returns the square root of that value. Since Math.sqrt(x) represents a value, it doesn't 
make sense to put it on a line by itself in a subroutine call statement such as 

Math. sqrt (x) ; // This doesn't make sense! 

What, after all, would the computer do with the value computed by the function in this case? 
You have to tell the computer to do something with the value. You might tell the computer to 
display it: 

System. out. print ( Math. sqrt (x) ); // Display the square root of x. 

or you might use an assignment statement to tell the computer to store that value in a variable: 
lengthOfSide = Math. sqrt (x) ; 

The function call Math, sqrt (x) represents a value of type double, and it can be used anyplace 
where a numeric literal of type double could be used. 

The Math class contains many static member functions. Here is a list of some of the more 
important of them: 

• Math.abs(x), which computes the absolute value of x. 

• The usual trigonometric functions, Math. sin (x), Math. cos (x), and Math. tan (x). (For 
all the trigonometric functions, angles are measured in radians, not degrees.) 

• The inverse trigonometric functions arcsin, arccos, and arctan, which are written as: 
Math.asin(x), Math.acos(x), and Math. atan(x) . The return value is expressed in radi- 
ans, not degrees. 

• The exponential function Math.exp(x) for computing the number e raised to the power 
x, and the natural logarithm function Math. log (x) for computing the logarithm of x in 
the base e. 

• Math.pow(x,y) for computing x raised to the power y. 

• Math.floor(x), which rounds x down to the nearest integer value that is less than or 
equal to x. Even though the return value is mathematically an integer, it is returned 
as a value of type double, rather than of type int as you might expect. For example, 
Math. floor (3. 76) is 3.0. The function Math. round(x) returns the integer that is closest 
to x. 

• Math . random () , which returns a randomly chosen double in the range 0.0 <= 
Math . random ( ) < 1.0. (The computer actually calculates so-called "pseudorandom" 
numbers, which are not truly random but are random enough for most purposes.) 

For these functions, the type of the parameter — the x or y inside the parentheses — can be 
any value of any numeric type. For most of the functions, the value returned by the function 
is of type double no matter what the type of the parameter. However, for Math.abs(x), the 
value returned will be the same type as x; if x is of type int, then so is Math.abs(x). So, for 
example, while Math, sqrt (9) is the double value 3.0, Math.abs(9) is the int value 9. 

Note that Math . random ( ) does not have any parameter. You still need the parentheses, even 
though there's nothing between them. The parentheses let the computer know that this is a sub- 
routine rather than a variable. Another example of a subroutine that has no parameters is the 
function System. currentTimeMillisO , from the System class. When this function is executed, 
it retrieves the current time, expressed as the number of milliseconds that have passed since a 
standardized base time (the start of the year 1970 in Greenwich Mean Time, if you care). One 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



32 



millisecond is one-thousandth of a second. The return value of System. currentTimeMillis () 
is of type long (a 64-bit integer). This function can be used to measure the time that it takes 
the computer to perform a task. Just record the time at which the task is begun and the time 
at which it is finished and take the difference. 

Here is a sample program that performs a few mathematical tasks and reports the time 
that it takes for the program to run. On some computers, the time reported might be zero, 
because it is too small to measure in milliseconds. Even if it's not zero, you can be sure that 
most of the time reported by the computer was spent doing output or working on tasks other 
than the program, since the calculations performed in this program occupy only a tiny fraction 
of a second of a computer's time. 

/** 

* This program performs some mathematical computations and displays 

* the results . It then reports the number of seconds that the 

* computer spent on this task. 
*/ 

public class TimedComputation { 

public static void main(String [] args) { 

long startTime; // Starting time of program, in milliseconds. 

long endTime; // Time when computations are done, in milliseconds. 

double time; // Time difference, in seconds. 

startTime = System. currentTimeMillis () ; 

double width, height, hypotenuse; // sides of a triangle 
width = 42.0; 
height = 17.0; 

hypotenuse = Math.sqrt( width*width + height*height ); 

System. out .print ("A triangle with sides 42 and 17 has hypotenuse "); 

System. out .println(hypotenuse) ; 

System. out .println("\nMathematically, sin(x) *sin(x) + " 

+ "cos(x)*cos(x) - 1 should be 0."); 
System. out .printlnC'Let ' s check this for x = 1:"); 
System. out. print(" sin(l) *sin(l) + cos (1) *cos (1) - 1 is "); 

System. out .print In ( Math. sin(l) *Math. sin(l) 

+ Math. cos(l)*Math. cos(l) - 1 ); 
System. out .printlnC (There can be round-off errors when" 

+ " computing with real numbers!)"); 

System. out. print ( "\nHere is a random number: "); 
System. out .printlnC Math.randomO ); 

endTime = System. currentTimeMillis () ; 
time = (endTime - startTime) / 1000.0; 

System. out. print ( "\nRun time in seconds was: "); 
System. out .println(time) ; 

} // end mainO 



} // end class TimedComputation

2.3.2 Operations on Strings 

A value of type String is an object. That object contains data, namely the sequence of characters 
that make up the string. It also contains subroutines. All of these subroutines are in fact 
functions. For example, every string object contains a function named length that computes 
the number of characters in that string. Suppose that advice is a variable that refers to a 
String. For example, advice might have been declared and assigned a value as follows: 

String advice; 

advice = "Seize the day!"; 

Then advice . length () is a function call that returns the number of characters in the string 
"Seize the day!" . In this case, the return value would be 14. In general, for any string variable 
str, the value of str . length () is an int equal to the number of characters in the string that is 
the value of str. Note that this function has no parameter; the particular string whose length 
is being computed is the value of str. The length subroutine is defined by the class String, 
and it can be used with any value of type String. It can even be used with String literals, which 
are, after all, just constant values of type String. For example, you could have a program count 
the characters in "Hello World" for you by saying 

System. out. print ("The number of characters in "); 
System. out. print ("the string V'Hello WorldV is "); 
System. out .println( "Hello World" . lengthO ); 

The String class defines a lot of functions. Here are some that you might find useful. Assume 
that si and s2 refer to values of type String: 

• si . equals (s2) is a function that returns a boolean value. It returns true if si consists 
of exactly the same sequence of characters as s2, and returns false otherwise. 

• si . equalsIgnoreCase (s2) is another boolean-valued function that checks whether si 
is the same string as s2, but this function considers upper and lower case letters 
to be equivalent. Thus, if si is "cat", then si . equals ("Cat ") is false, while 
sl.equalsIgnoreCase("Cat") is true. 

• si . length () , as mentioned above, is an integer- valued function that gives the number of 
characters in si. 

• si . char At (N) , where N is an integer, returns a value of type char. It returns the N- 
th character in the string. Positions are numbered starting with 0, so sl.charAt(O) is 
actually the first character, si. char At (1) is the second, and so on. The final position is 
si. length () - 1. For example, the value of "cat" .charAt(l) is 'a'. An error occurs if 
the value of the parameter is less than zero or greater than si. length () - 1. 

• si . substring (N,M) , where N and M are integers, returns a value of type String. The 
returned value consists of the characters of si in positions N, N+l,. . . , M-l. Note that the 
character in position M is not included. The returned value is called a substring of si. The 
subroutine si . substring (N) returns the substring of si consisting of characters starting 
at position N up until the end of the string. 

• si . indexOf (s2) returns an integer. If s2 occurs as a substring of si, then the returned 
value is the starting position of that substring. Otherwise, the returned value is -1. You 
can also use si . indexOf (ch) to search for a particular character, ch, in si. To find the 
first occurrence of x at or after position N, you can use si . indexOf (x,N) . 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



34 



• si . compareTo (s2) is an integer-valued function that compares the two strings. If the 
strings are equal, the value returned is zero. If si is less than s2, the value returned 
is a number less than zero, and if si is greater than s2, the value returned is some 
number greater than zero. (If both of the strings consist entirely of lower case letters, or 
if they consist entirely of upper case letters, then "less than" and "greater than" refer to 
alphabetical order. Otherwise, the ordering is more complicated.) 

• si . toUpperCase ( ) is a String- valued function that returns a new string that is equal to si, 
except that any lower case letters in si have been converted to upper case. For example, 
"Cat" .toUpperCaseO is the string "CAT". There is also a function si .toLowerCaseO . 

• si .trim () is a String- valued function that returns a new string that is equal to si except 
that any non-printing characters such as spaces and tabs have been trimmed from the 
beginning and from the end of the string. Thus, if si has the value "fred ", then 
sl.trimO is the string "fred", with the spaces at the end removed. 

For the functions si . toUpperCase () , si .toLowerCaseO , and sl.trimO, note that the 
value of si is not modified. Instead a new string is created and returned as the value of 
the function. The returned value could be used, for example, in an assignment statement 
such as "smallLetters = si .toLowerCaseO ;"• To change the value of si, you could use an 
assignment "si = si .toLowerCaseO ;". 

* * * 

Here is another extremely useful fact about strings: You can use the plus operator, +, to 
concatenate two strings. The concatenation of two strings is a new string consisting of all the 
characters of the first string followed by all the characters of the second string. For example, 
"Hello" + "World" evaluates to "HelloWorld". (Gotta watch those spaces, of course — if you 
want a space in the concatenated string, it has to be somewhere in the input data, as in 
"Hello " + "World".) 

Let's suppose that name is a variable of type String and that it already refers to the name 
of the person using the program. Then, the program could greet the user by executing the 
statement: 

System. out. println( "Hello, " + name + ". Pleased to meet you!"); 

Even more surprising is that you can actually concatenate values of any type onto a String 
using the + operator. The value is converted to a string, just as it would be if you printed it to 
the standard output, and then it is concatenated onto the string. For example, the expression 
"Number" + 42 evaluates to the string "Number42". And the statements 

System. out. print ("After "); 
System . out . print (years) ; 

System. out. print (" years, the value is "); 
System . out . print (principal) ; 

can be replaced by the single statement: 

System. out. print ("After " + years + 

" years, the value is " + principal); 

Obviously, this is very convenient. It would have shortened some of the examples presented 
earlier in this chapter.

2.3.3 Introduction to Enums 

Java comes with eight built-in primitive types and a large set of types that are defined by 
classes, such as String. But even this large collection of types is not sufficient to cover all the 
possible situations that a programmer might have to deal with. So, an essential part of Java, 
just like almost any other programming language, is the ability to create new types. For the 
most part, this is done by defining new classes; you will learn how to do that in Chapter 5. But 
we will look here at one particular case: the ability to define enums (short for enumerated 
types). Enums are a recent addition to Java. They were only added in Version 5.0. Many 
programming languages have something similar, and many people believe that enums should 
have been part of Java from the beginning. 

Technically, an enum is considered to be a special kind of class, but that is not important 
for now. In this section, we will look at enums in a simplified form. In practice, most uses of 
enums will only need the simplified form that is presented here. 

An enum is a type that has a fixed list of possible values, which is specified when the enum 
is created. In some ways, an enum is similar to the boolean data type, which has true and 
false as its only possible values. However, boolean is a primitive type, while an enum is not. 

The definition of an enum type has the (simplified) form: 
enum {enum- type-name) { (list-of-enum-values) } 

This definition cannot be inside a subroutine. You can place it outside the main() routine 
of the program. The (enum-type-name) can be any simple identifier. This identifier becomes 
the name of the enum type, in the same way that "boolean" is the name of the boolean type 
and "String" is the name of the String type. Each value in the (list-of-enum-values) must be a 
simple identifier, and the identifiers in the list are separated by commas. For example, here is 
the definition of an enum type named Season whose values are the names of the four seasons 
of the year: 

enum Season { SPRING, SUMMER, FALL, WINTER } 

By convention, enum values are given names that are made up of upper case letters, but 
that is a style guideline and not a syntax rule. Enum values are not variables. Each value is 
a constant that always has the same value. In fact, the possible values of an enum type are 
usually referred to as enum constants. 

Note that the enum constants of type Season are considered to be "contained in" Season, 
which means — following the convention that compound identifiers are used for things that are 
contained in other things — the names that you actually use in your program to refer to them 
are Season. SPRING, Season. SUMMER, Season. FALL, and Season. WINTER. 

Once an enum type has been created, it can be used to declare variables in exactly the same 
ways that other types are used. For example, you can declare a variable named vacation of 
type Season with the statement: 
Season vacation; 

After declaring the variable, you can assign a value to it using an assignment statement. The 
value on the right-hand side of the assignment can be one of the enum constants of type Season. 
Remember to use the full name of the constant, including "Season"! For example: 

vacation = Season. SUMMER; 

You can print out an enum value with an output statement such as System . out . print (vacation) 
The output value will be the name of the enum constant (without the "Season."). In this case, 
the output would be "SUMMER" . 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



36 



Because an enum is technically a class, the enum values are technically objects. As ob- 
jects, they can contain subroutines. One of the subroutines in every enum value is named 
ordinal (). When used with an enum value, it returns the ordinal number of the value in 
the list of values of the enum. The ordinal number simply tells the position of the value in 
the list. That is, Season. SPRING. ordinal () is the int value 0, Season. SUMMER. ordinal () is 
1, Season. FALL. ordinal () is 2, and Season. WINTER. ordinal () is 3. (You will see over and 
over again that computer scientists like to start counting at zero!) You can, of course, use 
the ordinalO method with a variable of type Season, such as vacation. ordinal () in our 
example. 

Right now, it might not seem to you that enums are all that useful. As you work though 
the rest of the book, you should be convinced that they are. For now, you should at least 
appreciate them as the first example of an important concept: creating new types. Here is a 
little example that shows enums being used in a complete program: 

public class EnumDemo { 

// Define two enum types — remember that the definitions 
// go OUTSIDE The mainO routine! 

enum Day { SUNDAY , MONDAY , TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY > 

enum Month { JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC > 

public static void main(String [] args) { 

Day tgif ; // Declare a variable of type Day. 

Month libra; // Declare a variable of type Month. 

tgif = Day. FRIDAY; // Assign a value of type Day to tgif. 
libra = Month. OCT; // Assign a value of type Month to libra. 

System. out .print ("My sign is libra, since I was born in "); 

System. out .println (libra) ; // Output value will be: OCT 

System. out .print ("That ' s the "); 

System. out .print ( libra. ordinalO ); 

System. out .println("-th month of the year."); 

System. out .println (" (Counting from 0, of course!)"); 

System. out .print ("Isn't it nice to get to "); 

System. out .println (tgif ) ; // Output value will be: FRIDAY 

System. out .println ( tgif + " is the " + tgif . ordinal () 

+ "-th day of the week."); 
// You can concatenate enum values onto Strings! 



2.4 Text Input and Output 

For some unfathomable reason, Java has never made it very easy to read data typed (online) 
in by the user of a program. You've already seen that output can be displayed to the user 
using the subroutine System, out .print. This subroutine is part of a pre-defined object called 
System. out. The purpose of this object is precisely to display output to the user. There is 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



37 



a corresponding object called System, in that exists to read data input by the user, but it 
provides only very primitive input facilities, and it requires some advanced Java programming 
skills to use it effectively. 

Java 5.0 finally made input from any source a little easier with a new Scanner class. How- 
ever, it requires some knowledge of object-oriented programming to use this class, so it's not 
appropriate for use here at the beginning of this course. Java 6 introduced the Console class, 
specifically for communicating with the user, but again, using Console requires more knowledge 
about objects than you have at this point. (Furthermore, in my opinion, Scanner and Console 
still don't get things quite right. Nevertheless, I will introduce Scanner briefly at the end of 
this section, in case you want to start using it now.) 

There is some excuse for this lack of concern with input, since Java is meant mainly to 
write programs for Graphical User Interfaces, and those programs have their own style of 
input/output, which is implemented quite well in Java. However, basic support is needed for 
input/output in old-fashioned non-GUI programs. Fortunately, it is possible to extend Java 
by creating new classes that provide subroutines that are not available in the standard part of 
the language. As soon as a new class is available, the subroutines that it contains can be used 
in exactly the same way as built-in routines. 

Along these lines, I've written a class called TextIO that defines subroutines for reading 
values typed by the user of a non-GUI program. The subroutines in this class make it possible 
to get input from the standard input object, System, in, without knowing about the advanced 
aspects of Java that are needed to use Scanner or to use System. in directly. TextIO also 
contains a set of output subroutines. The output subroutines are similar to those provided in 
System. out, but they provide a few additional features. For displaying output to the user, you 
can use either System. out or TextIO, and you can even mix them in the same program. 

To use the TextIO class, you must make sure that the class is available to your program. 
What this means depends on the Java programming environment that you are using. In general, 
you just have to add the source code file, TextIO .java, to the same directory that contains your 
main program. See Section 2.6 for more information about how to use TextIO. 

2.4.1 A First Text Input Example 

The input routines in the TextIO class are static member functions. (Static member functions 
were introduced in the previous section.) Let's suppose that you want your program to read 
an integer typed in by the user. The TextIO class contains a static member function named 
getlnlnt that you can use for this purpose. Since this function is contained in the TextIO class, 
you have to refer to it in your program as TextIO. getlnlnt. The function has no parameters, 
so a complete call to the function takes the form "TextIO. get lnlntO". This function call 
represents the int value typed by the user, and you have to do something with the returned 
value, such as assign it to a variable. For example, if userlnput is a variable of type int 
(created with a declaration statement "int userlnput;"), then you could use the assignment 
statement 

userlnput = TextIO . getlnlnt () ; 

When the computer executes this statement, it will wait for the user to type in an integer 
value. That value will then be returned by the function, and it will be stored in the variable, 
userlnput. Here is a complete program that uses TextIO .getlnlnt to read a number typed 
by the user and then prints out the square of the number that the user types: 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



38 



/** 

* A program that reads an integer that is typed in by the 

* user and computes and prints the square of that integer. 
*/ 

public class PrintSquare { 

public static void main(String [] args) { 

int userlnput ; / / The number input by the user . 

int square; // The userlnput, multiplied by itself. 

System. out .print ("Please type a number: "); 
userlnput = TextIO . getlnlnt () ; 
square = userlnput * userlnput; 

System. out .print ("The square of that number is "); 
System. out .println (square) ; 

} // end of mainO 

} //end of class PrintSquare 

When you run this program, it will display the message "Please type a number:" and will 
pause until you type a response, including a carriage return after the number. 

2.4.2 Text Output 

The TextIO class contains static member subroutines TextIO. put and TextIO. putln that can 
be used in the same way as System, out .print and System, out .println. For example, al- 
though there is no particular advantage in doing so in this case, you could replace the two 
lines 

System. out. print ("The square of that number is "); 
System. out .println (square) ; 

with 

TextIO. put ("The square of that number is "); 
TextIO .putln(square) ; 

For the next few chapters, I will use TextIO for input in all my examples, and I will often use 
it for output. Keep in mind that TextIO can only be used in a program if it is available to that 
program. It is not built into Java in the way that the System class is. 

Let's look a little more closely at the built-in output subroutines System, out .print and 
System. out .println. Each of these subroutines can be used with one parameter, where the 
parameter can be a value of any of the primitive types byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, 
or boolean. The parameter can also be a String, a value belonging to an enum type, or indeed 
any object. That is, you can say "System. out. print (x) ;" or "System. out. println(x) ;" , 
where x is any expression whose value is of any type whatsoever. The expression can be a con- 
stant, a variable, or even something more complicated such as 2*distance*time. Now, in fact, 
the System class actually includes several different subroutines to handle different parameter 
types. There is one System. out .print for printing values of type double, one for values of 
type int, another for values that are objects, and so on. These subroutines can have the same 
name since the computer can tell which one you mean in a given subroutine call statement, 
depending on the type of parameter that you supply. Having several subroutines of the same 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



39 



name that differ in the types of their parameters is called overloading . Many programming 
languages do not permit overloading, but it is common in Java programs. 

The difference between System, out .print and System, out .print In is that the println 
version outputs a carriage return after it outputs the specified parameter value. There is a 
version of System, out .println that has no parameters. This version simply outputs a carriage 
return, and nothing else. A subroutine call statement for this version of the subroutine looks like 
"System, out. println ();", with empty parentheses. Note that "System, out .println (x) ;" is 
exactly equivalent to "System. out .print (x) ; System, out .printlnQ ;"; the carriage return 
comes after the value of x. (There is no version of System, out .print without parameters. 
Do you see why?) 

As mentioned above, the TextIO subroutines TextlO.put and TextlO.putln can be used 
as replacements for System, out .print and System, out .println. The TextIO functions work 
in exactly the same way as the System functions, except that, as we will see below, TextIO can 
also be used to write to other destinations. 

2.4.3 TextIO Input Functions 

The TextIO class is a little more versatile at doing output than is System. out. However, it's 
input for which we really need it. 

With TextIO, input is done using functions. For example, TextIO. getlnlntQ, which was 
discussed above, makes the user type in a value of type int and returns that input value so that 
you can use it in your program. TextIO includes several functions for reading different types of 
input values. Here are examples of the ones that you are most likely to use: 

j = TextIO . getlnlnt () ; // Reads a value of type int. 

y = TextIO . getlnDouble () ; // Reads a value of type double. 

a = TextIO . getlnBooleanO ; // Reads a value of type boolean. 

c = TextI0.getlnCh.arO ; // Reads a value of type char. 

w = TextIO . getlnWordO ; // Reads one "word" as a value of type String. 

s = TextIO . getlnO ; // Reads an entire input line as a String. 

For these statements to be legal, the variables on the left side of each assignment statement 
must already be declared and must be of the same type as that returned by the function on 
the right side. Note carefully that these functions do not have parameters. The values that 
they return come from outside the program, typed in by the user as the program is running. 
To "capture" that data so that you can use it in your program, you have to assign the return 
value of the function to a variable. You will then be able to refer to the user's input value by 
using the name of the variable. 

When you call one of these functions, you are guaranteed that it will return a legal value of 
the correct type. If the user types in an illegal value as input — for example, if you ask for an 
int and the user types in a non-numeric character or a number that is outside the legal range 
of values that can be stored in a variable of type int — then the computer will ask the user to 
re-enter the value, and your program never sees the first, illegal value that the user entered. For 
TextIO .getlnBooleanO , the user is allowed to type in any of the following: true, false, t, f, yes, 
no, y, n, 1, or 0. Furthermore, they can use either upper or lower case letters. In any case, the 
user's input is interpreted as a true/false value. It's convenient to use TextIO . getlnBooleanO 
to read the user's response to a Yes/No question. 

You'll notice that there are two input functions that return Strings. The first, getlnWordO , 
returns a string consisting of non-blank characters only. When it is called, it skips over any 
spaces and carriage returns typed in by the user. Then it reads non-blank characters until it gets 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



40 



to the next space or carriage return. It returns a String consisting of all the non-blank characters 
that it has read. The second input function, getlnQ, simply returns a string consisting of all 
the characters typed in by the user, including spaces, up to the next carriage return. It gets an 
entire line of input text. The carriage return itself is not returned as part of the input string, 
but it is read and discarded by the computer. Note that the String returned by this function 
might be the empty string, "", which contains no characters at all. You will get this return 
value if the user simply presses return, without typing anything else first. 

All the other input functions listed — getlnlntO, getlnDouble () , getlnBooleanO , and 
getlnChar () — behave like getlnWordO in that they will skip past any blanks and carriage 
returns in the input before reading a value. 

Furthermore, if the user types extra characters on the line after the input value, all the 
extra characters will be discarded, along with the carriage return at the end of the 
line. If the program executes another input function, the user will have to type in another line 
of input. It might not sound like a good idea to discard any of the user's input, but it turns out 
to be the safest thing to do in most programs. Sometimes, however, you do want to read more 
than one value from the same line of input. TextIO provides the following alternative input 
functions to allow you to do this: 

j = TextID . getlnt () ; // Reads a value of type int. 

y = TextID. getDoubleO ; // Reads a value of type double. 

a = TextID . getBooleanO ; // Reads a value of type boolean. 

c = TextID . getCharO ; // Reads a value of type char. 

w = TextID . getWordO ; // Reads one "word" as a value of type String. 

The names of these functions start with "get" instead of "getln" . "Getln" is short for "get 
line" and should remind you that the functions whose names begin with "getln" will get an 
entire line of data. A function without the "In" will read an input value in the same way, but 
will then save the rest of the input line in a chunk of internal memory called the input buffer. 
The next time the computer wants to read an input value, it will look in the input buffer before 
prompting the user for input. This allows the computer to read several values from one line 
of the user's input. Strictly speaking, the computer actually reads only from the input buffer. 
The first time the program tries to read input from the user, the computer will wait while the 
user types in an entire line of input. TextIO stores that line in the input buffer until the data 
on the line has been read or discarded (by one of the "getln" functions). The user only gets to 
type when the buffer is empty. 

Clearly, the semantics of input is much more complicated than the semantics of output! 
Fortunately, for the majority of applications, it's pretty straightforward in practice. You only 
need to follow the details if you want to do something fancy. In particular, I strongly advise 
you to use the "getln" versions of the input routines, rather than the "get" versions, unless you 
really want to read several items from the same line of input, precisely because the semantics 
of the "getln" versions is much simpler. 

Note, by the way, that although the TextIO input functions will skip past blank spaces and 
carriage returns while looking for input, they will not skip past other characters. For example, 
if you try to read two ints and the user types "2,3", the computer will read the first number 
correctly, but when it tries to read the second number, it will see the comma. It will regard this 
as an error and will force the user to retype the number. If you want to input several numbers 
from one line, you should make sure that the user knows to separate them with spaces, not 
commas. Alternatively, if you want to require a comma between the numbers, use getCharO 
to read the comma before reading the second number. 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



41 



There is another character input function, TextIO . getAnyChar () , which does not skip past 
blanks or carriage returns. It simply reads and returns the next character typed by the user, 
even if it's a blank or carriage return. If the user typed a carriage return, then the char returned 
by getAnyChar () is the special linefeed character '\n'. There is also a function, TextIO. peek(), 
that lets you look ahead at the next character in the input without actually reading it. After 
you "peek" at the next character, it will still be there when you read the next item from input. 
This allows you to look ahead and see what's coming up in the input, so that you can take 
different actions depending on what's there. 

The TextIO class provides a number of other functions. To learn more about them, you can 
look at the comments in the source code file, TextlO.java. 

(You might be wondering why there are only two output routines, print and println, 
which can output data values of any type, while there is a separate input routine for each data 
type. As noted above, in reality there are many print and println routines, one for each data 
type. The computer can tell them apart based on the type of the parameter that you provide. 
However, the input routines don't have parameters, so the different input routines can only be 
distinguished by having different names.) 

* * * 

Using TextIO for input and output, we can now improve the program from Section 2.2 for 
computing the value of an investment. We can have the user type in the initial value of the 
investment and the interest rate. The result is a much more useful program — for one thing, it 
makes sense to run it more than once! 

/** 

* This class implements a simple program that will compute 

* the amount of interest that is earned on an investment over 

* a period of one year. The initial amount of the investment 

* and the interest rate are input by the user . The value of 

* the investment at the end of the year is output. The 

* rate must be input as a decimal, not a percentage (for 

* example, 0.05 rather than 5). 
*/ 

public class Interest2 { 

public static void main(String[] args) { 

double principal; // The value of the investment. 

double rate; // The annual interest rate. 

double interest; // The interest earned during the year. 

Text 10. put ("Enter the initial investment: "); 
principal = TextIO . getlnDouble () ; 

TextIO .put ("Enter the annual interest rate (decimal, not percentage!): "); 
rate = TextIO . getlnDouble () ; 

interest = principal * rate; // Compute this year's interest, 

principal = principal + interest; // Add it to principal. 

TextIO .put ("The value of the investment after one year is $"); 
TextIO . putln (principal) ; 

} // end of mainO 

} // end of class Interest2

2.4.4 Formatted Output 

If you ran the preceding Interest2 example, you might have noticed that the answer is not 
always written in the format that is usually used for dollar amounts. In general, dollar amounts 
are written with two digits after the decimal point. But the program's output can be a number 
like 1050.0 or 43.575. It would be better if these numbers were printed as 1050.00 and 43.58. 

Java 5.0 introduced a formatted output capability that makes it much easier than it used 
to be to control the format of output numbers. A lot of formatting options are available. I will 
cover just a few of the simplest and most commonly used possibilities here. 

You can use the function System. out. printf to produce formatted output. (The name 
"printf," which stands for "print formatted," is copied from the C and C++ programming 
languages, which have always had a similar formatting capability). System, out .printf takes 
two or more parameters. The first parameter is a String that specifies the format of the output. 
This parameter is called the format string . The remaining parameters specify the values that 
are to be output. Here is a statement that will print a number in the proper format for a dollar 
amount, where amount is a variable of type double: 

System, out .printf ( "7,1. 2f", amount ); 

TextIO can also do formatted output. The function TextlO.putf has the same 
functionality as System, out .printf . Using TextIO, the above example would be: 
TextIO .putf ("°/„l . 2f" .amount) ; and you could say TextIO .putf ("°/„l . 2f" , principal) ; in- 
stead of TextIO .putln (principal) ; in the Interest2 program to get the output in the right 
format. 

The output format of a value is specified by a format specifier. The format string (in 
the simple cases that I cover here) contains one format specifier for each of the values that is 
to be output. Some typical format specifiers are °/ d, °/ 12d, °/ 10s, %1.2f, °/„15.8e and %1.8g. 
Every format specifier begins with a percent sign (%) and ends with a letter, possibly with some 
extra formatting information in between. The letter specifies the type of output that is to be 
produced. For example, in %d and %12d, the "d" specifies that an integer is to be written. The 
"12" in °/ 12d specifies the minimum number of spaces that should be used for the output. If 
the integer that is being output takes up fewer than 12 spaces, extra blank spaces are added 
in front of the integer to bring the total up to 12. We say that the output is "right-justified 
in a field of length 12." The value is not forced into 12 spaces; if the value has more than 12 
digits, all the digits will be printed, with no extra spaces. The specifier %d means the same as 
°/ ld — that is, an integer will be printed using just as many spaces as necessary. (The "d," by 
the way, stands for "decimal" — that is, base-10 — numbers. You can replace the "d" with an 
"x" to output an integer value in hexadecimal form.) 

The letter "s" at the end of a format specifier can be used with any type of value. It 
means that the value should be output in its default format, just as it would be in unformatted 
output. A number, such as the "10" in %10s can be added to specify the (minimum) number 
of characters. The "s" stands for "string," meaning that the value is converted into a String 
value in the usual way. 

The format specifiers for values of type double are even more complicated. An "f, as 
in %1.2f, is used to output a number in "floating-point" form, that is with digits after the 
decimal point. In °/ 1.2f, the "2" specifies the number of digits to use after the decimal point. 
The "1" specifies the (minimum) number of characters to output, which effectively means that 
just as many characters as are necessary should be used. Similarly, °/ 12.3f would specify a 
floating-point format with 3 digits after the decimal point, right-justified in a field of length 12. 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



43 



Very large and very small numbers should be written in exponential format, such as 
6.00221415e23, representing "6.00221415 times 10 raised to the power 23." A format speci- 
fier such as %15.8e specifies an output in exponential form, with the "8" telling how many 
digits to use after the decimal point. If you use "g" instead of "e", the output will be in 
floating-point form for small values and in exponential form for large values. In %1.8g, the 
8 gives the total number of digits in the answer, including both the digits before the decimal 
point and the digits after the decimal point. 

For numeric output, the format specifier can include a comma (","), which will cause the 
digits of the number to be separated into groups, to make it easier to read big numbers. In 
the United States, groups of three digits are separated by commas. For example, if x is one 
billion, then System, out .printf ("%,d" ,x) will output 1,000,000,000. In other countries, the 
separator character and the number of digits per group might be different. The comma should 
come at the beginning of the format specifier, before the field width; for example: %, 12.3f . 

In addition to format specifiers, the format string in a printf statement can include other 
characters. These extra characters are just copied to the output. This can be a convenient way 
to insert values into the middle of an output string. For example, if x and y are variables of 
type int, you could say 

System, out .printf ( "The product of 7 d and °/d is 7 d" , x, y, x*y) ; 

When this statement is executed, the value of x is substituted for the first %d in the string, the 
value of y for the second °/ d, and the value of the expression x*y for the third, so the output 
would be something like "The product of 17 and 42 is 714" (quotation marks not included in 
output!). 

2.4.5 Introduction to File I/O 

System. out sends its output to the output destination known as "standard output." But stan- 
dard output is just one possible output destination. For example, data can be written to a file 
that is stored on the user's hard drive. The advantage to this, of course, is that the data is 
saved in the file even after the program ends, and the user can print the file, email it to someone 
else, edit it with another program, and so on. 

TextIO has the ability to write data to files and to read data from files. When you write 
output using the put, putln, or putf method in TextIO, the output is sent to the current 
output destination. By default, the current output destination is standard output. However, 
TextIO has some subroutines that can be used to change the current output destination. To 
write to a file named "result.txt", for example, you would use the statement: 

TextIO . writeFile ( "result . txt " ) ; 

After this statement is executed, any output from TextIO output statements will be sent to the 
file named "result.txt" instead of to standard output. The file should be created in the same 
directory that contains the program. Note that if a file with the same name already exists, its 
previous contents will be erased! In many cases, you want to let the user select the file that 
will be used for output. The statement 

TextIO. writeUserSelectedFile () ; 

will open a typical graphical-user-interface file selection dialog where the user can specify the 
output file. If you want to go back to sending output to standard output, you can say 

TextIO .writeStandardOutput () ; 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



44 



You can also specify the input source for TextlO's various "get" functions. The default input 
source is standard input. You can use the statement TextIO.readFileCdata.txt") to read 
from a file named "data.txt" instead, or you can let the user select the input file by saying 
TextlO.readUserSelectedFileQ. You can go back to reading from standard input with 
Text 10 . readStandardlnput () . 

When your program is reading from standard input, the user gets a chance to correct any 
errors in the input. This is not possible when the program is reading from a file. If illegal data 
is found when a program tries to read from a file, an error occurs that will crash the program. 
(Later, we will see that it is possible to "catch" such errors and recover from them.) Errors can 
also occur, though more rarely, when writing to files. 

A complete understanding of file input/output in Java requires a knowledge of object ori- 
ented programming. We will return to the topic later, in Chapter 11. The file I/O capabilities 
in TextIO are rather primitive by comparison. Nevertheless, they are sufficient for many appli- 
cations, and they will allow you to get some experience with files sooner rather than later. 

As a simple example, here is a program that asks the user some questions and outputs the 
user's responses to a file named "profile.txt" : 

public class CreateProf ile { 

public static void main (String [] args) { 

String name; // The user's name. 

String email; // The user's email address, 

double salary; // the user's yearly salary. 

String favColor; // The user's favorite color. 

TextIO .putlnC'Good Afternoon! This program will create"); 
TextIO .put In ("your profile file, if you will just answer"); 
TextIO .putln( "a few simple questions."); 
TextIO. put In ; 

/* Gather responses from the user. */ 

TextIO .put ("What is your name? "); 
name = TextIO . getlnO ; 

Text 10. put ("What is your email address? "); 
email = TextIO . getlnO ; 

Text 10. put ("What is your yearly income? "); 
salary = TextlO.getlnDoubleO ; 
Text 10. put ("What is your favorite color? "); 
favColor = TextIO . getlnO ; 

/* Write the user's information to the file named profile.txt. */ 

TextIO. writeFileC'prof ile. txt") ; // subsequent output goes to the file 

TextIO .put In ("Name : " + name); 

TextIO .put In ("Email : " + email); 

TextIO .putlnC'Favorite Color: " + favColor); 

TextIO. putf( "Yearly Income: 7„,1.2f\n", salary); 

// The "/n" in the previous line is a carriage return, and the 
// comma in °/ ,1.2f adds separators between groups of digits. 

/* Print a final message to standard output. */ 

TextIO. writeStandardOutput () ; 

TextIO .put In ("Thank you. Your profile has been written to profile.txt.");

2.4.6 Using Scanner for Input 

TextIO makes it easy to get input from the user. However, since it is not a standard class, you 
have to remember to add TextIO. java to a program that uses it. One advantage of using the 
Scanner class for input is that it's a standard part of Java and so is always there when you 
want it. 

It's not that hard to use a Scanner for user input, but doing so requires some syntax that 
will not be introduced until Chapter 4 and Chapter 5. I'll tell you how to do it here, without 
explaining why it works. You won't understand all the syntax at this point. (Scanners will be 
covered in more detail in Subsection 11.1.5.) 

First, you should add the following line to your program at the beginning of the source code 
file, before the "public class. . .": 

import java. util. Scanner; 

Then include the following statement at the beginning of your main() routine: 

Scanner stdin = new Scanner ( System. in ); 

This creates a variable named stdin of type Scanner. (You can use a different name for the 
variable if you want; "stdin" stands for "standard input.") You can then use stdin in your 
program to access a variety of subroutines for reading user input. For example, the function 
stdin. nextlnt () reads one value of type int from the user and returns it. It is almost the 
same as TextIO . getlnt () except for two things: If the value entered by the user is not a legal 
int, then stdin. nextlnt () will crash rather than prompt the user to re-enter the value. And 
the integer entered by the user must be followed by a blank space or by an end-of-line, whereas 
TextIO .getlnt () will stop reading at any character that is not a digit. 

There are corresponding methods for reading other types of data, including 
stdin. nextDouble () , stdin. nextLong () , and stdin. nextBooleanO . (stdin. nextBooleanO 
will only accept "true" or "false" as input.) The method stdin. nextLineO is equivalent to 
TextIO .getln() , and stdin. next(), like TextIO . getWordO , returns a string of non-blank 
characters. 

As a simple example, here is a version of the sample program Interest2.java that uses Scanner 
instead of TextIO for user input: 

import java. util .Scanner; // Make the Scanner class available. 

public class Interest2WithScanner ■[ 

public static void main(String[] args) { 

Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System, in ); // Create the Scanner. 

double principal; // The value of the investment. 

double rate; // The annual interest rate. 

double interest; // The interest earned during the year. 

System. out. print ("Enter the initial investment: "); 
principal = stdin. nextDouble () ; 

System. out. print ("Enter the annual interest rate (decimal, not percent!): "); 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



46 



rate = stdin.nextDoubleO ; 

interest = principal * rate; // Compute this year's interest, 

principal = principal + interest; // Add it to principal. 

System. out .print ("The value of the investment after one year is $"); 
System. out . println (principal) ; 

} // end of mainO 

} // end of class Interest2With Scanner 

Note the inclusion of the two lines given above and the substitution of stdin.nextDoubleO 
for TextIO . getlnDouble () . (In fact, stdin.nextDoubleO is really equivalent to 
TextID .getDoubleO rather than to the "getln" version, but this will not affect the behav- 
ior of the program as long as the user types just one number on each line of input.) 

I will continue to use TextIO for input for the time being, but I will give a few more examples 
of using Scanner in the on-line solutions to the end-of-chapter exercises. There will be more 
detailed coverage of Scanner later in the book. 

2.5 Details of Expressions 

This section takes a closer look at expressions. Recall that an expression is a piece of (online) 
program code that represents or computes a value. An expression can be a literal, a variable, 
a function call, or several of these things combined with operators such as + and >. The value 
of an expression can be assigned to a variable, used as a parameter in a subroutine call, or 
combined with other values into a more complicated expression. (The value can even, in some 
cases, be ignored, if that's what you want to do; this is more common than you might think.) 
Expressions are an essential part of programming. So far, these notes have dealt only informally 
with expressions. This section tells you the more-or-less complete story (leaving out some of 
the less commonly used operators). 

The basic building blocks of expressions are literals (such as 674, 3.14, true, and 'X'), 
variables, and function calls. Recall that a function is a subroutine that returns a value. You've 
already seen some examples of functions, such as the input routines from the TextIO class and 
the mathematical functions from the Math class. 

The Math class also contains a couple of mathematical constants that are useful in math- 
ematical expressions: Math. PI represents ir (the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its 
diameter), and Math.E represents e (the base of the natural logarithms). These "constants" 
are actually member variables in Math of type double. They are only approximations for the 
mathematical constants, which would require an infinite number of digits to specify exactly. 

Literals, variables, and function calls are simple expressions. More complex expressions 
can be built up by using operators to combine simpler expressions. Operators include + for 
adding two numbers, > for comparing two values, and so on. When several operators appear 
in an expression, there is a question of precedence, which determines how the operators are 
grouped for evaluation. For example, in the expression "A + B * C", B*C is computed first 
and then the result is added to A. We say that multiplication (*) has higher precedence 
than addition (+). If the default precedence is not what you want, you can use parentheses to 
explicitly specify the grouping you want. For example, you could use "(A + B) * C" if you 
want to add A to B first and then multiply the result by C. 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



47 



The rest of this section gives details of operators in Java. The number of operators in Java 
is quite large, and I will not cover them all here. Most of the important ones are here; a few 
will be covered in later chapters as they become relevant. 

2.5.1 Arithmetic Operators 

Arithmetic operators include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They are 
indicated by +, -, *, and /. These operations can be used on values of any numeric type: byte, 
short, int, long, float, or double. (They can also be used with values of type char, which 
are treated as integers in this context; a char is converted into its Unicode code number when 
it is used with an arithmetic operator.) When the computer actually calculates one of these 
operations, the two values that it combines must be of the same type. If your program tells 
the computer to combine two values of different types, the computer will convert one of the 
values from one type to another. For example, to compute 37.4 + 10, the computer will convert 
the integer 10 to a real number 10.0 and will then compute 37.4 + 10.0. This is called a type 
conversion. Ordinarily, you don't have to worry about type conversion in expressions, because 
the computer does it automatically. 

When two numerical values are combined (after doing type conversion on one of them, if 
necessary), the answer will be of the same type. If you multiply two ints, you get an int; if you 
multiply two doubles, you get a double. This is what you would expect, but you have to be 
very careful when you use the division operator /. When you divide two integers, the answer 
will always be an integer; if the quotient has a fractional part, it is discarded. For example, the 
value of 7/2 is 3, not 3.5. If N is an integer variable, then N/100 is an integer, and 1/N is equal 
to zero for any N greater than one! This fact is a common source of programming errors. You 
can force the computer to compute a real number as the answer by making one of the operands 
real: For example, when the computer evaluates 1.0/N, it first converts N to a real number in 
order to match the type of 1.0, so you get a real number as the answer. 

Java also has an operator for computing the remainder when one integer is divided by 
another. This operator is indicated by %. If A and B are integers, then A °/ B represents the 
remainder when A is divided by B. (However, for negative operands, % is not quite the same as 
the usual mathematical "modulus" operator, since if one of A or B is negative, then the value 
of A % B will be negative.) For example, 7 7, 2 is 1, while 34577 % 100 is 77, and 50 % 8 is 
2. A common use of % is to test whether a given integer is even or odd: N is even if N °/ 2 is 
zero, and it is odd if N % 2 is 1. More generally, you can check whether an integer N is evenly 
divisible by an integer M by checking whether N % M is zero. 

Finally, you might need the unary minus operator, which takes the negative of a number. 
For example, -X has the same value as (-1)*X. For completeness, Java also has a unary plus 
operator, as in +X, even though it doesn't really do anything. 

By the way, recall that the + operator can also be used to concatenate a value of any 
type onto a String. This is another example of type conversion. In Java, any type can be 
automatically converted into type String. 

2.5.2 Increment and Decrement 

You'll find that adding 1 to a variable is an extremely common operation in programming. 
Subtracting 1 from a variable is also pretty common. You might perform the operation of 
adding 1 to a variable with assignment statements such as: 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



48 



counter = counter + 1; 
goalsScored = goalsScored + 1; 

The effect of the assignment statement x = x + 1 is to take the old value of the variable 
x, compute the result of adding 1 to that value, and store the answer as the new value of 
x. The same operation can be accomplished by writing x++ (or, if you prefer, ++x). This 
actually changes the value of x, so that it has the same effect as writing "x = x + 1" . The two 
statements above could be written 

counter++; 
goalsScored++ ; 

Similarly, you could write x — (or — x) to subtract 1 from x. That is, x — performs the same 
computation as x = x - 1. Adding 1 to a variable is called incrementing that variable, 
and subtracting 1 is called decrementing. The operators ++ and — are called the increment 
operator and the decrement operator, respectively. These operators can be used on variables 
belonging to any of the numerical types and also on variables of type char. 

Usually, the operators ++ or — are used in statements like "x++;" or "x — ;". These state- 
ments are commands to change the value of x. However, it is also legal to use x++, ++x, x — , 
or — x as expressions, or as parts of larger expressions. That is, you can write things like: 

y = x++; 
y = ++x; 

TextIO .putln( — x) ; 
z = (++x) * (y— ) ; 

The statement "y = x++;" has the effects of adding 1 to the value of x and, in addition, assigning 
some value to y. The value assigned to y is the value of the expression x++, which is defined 
to be the old value of x, before the 1 is added. Thus, if the value of x is 6, the statement "y 
= x++;" will change the value of x to 7, but it will change the value of y to 6 since the value 
assigned to y is the old value of x. On the other hand, the value of ++x is defined to be the 
new value of x, after the 1 is added. So if x is 6, then the statement "y = ++x;" changes the 
values of both x and y to 7. The decrement operator, — , works in a similar way. 

This can be confusing. My advice is: Don't be confused. Use ++ and — only in stand-alone 
statements, not in expressions. I will follow this advice in almost all examples in these notes. 

2.5.3 Relational Operators 

Java has boolean variables and boolean-valued expressions that can be used to express con- 
ditions that can be either true or false. One way to form a boolean-valued expression is 
to compare two values using a relational operator. Relational operators are used to test 
whether two values are equal, whether one value is greater than another, and so forth. The 
relational operators in Java are: ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=. The meanings of these operators are: 



A 


== B 


Is 


A 


"equal to" B? 




A 


!= B 


Is 


A 


"not equal to" B? 




A 


< B 


Is 


A 


"less than" B? 




A 


> B 


Is 


A 


"greater than" B? 




A 


<= B 


Is 


A 


"less than or equal to 1 


1 B? 


A 


>= B 


Is 


A 


"greater than or equal 


to" B? 



These operators can be used to compare values of any of the numeric types. They can also be 
used to compare values of type char. For characters, < and > are defined according the numeric 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



49 



Unicode values of the characters. (This might not always be what you want. It is not the same 
as alphabetical order because all the upper case letters come before all the lower case letters.) 

When using boolean expressions, you should remember that as far as the computer is con- 
cerned, there is nothing special about boolean values. In the next chapter, you will see how to 
use them in loop and branch statements. But you can also assign boolean-valued expressions 
to boolean variables, just as you can assign numeric values to numeric variables. 

By the way, the operators == and != can be used to compare boolean values. This is 
occasionally useful. For example, can you figure out what this does: 

boolean sameSign; 

sameSign = ((x > 0) == (y > 0)); 

One thing that you cannot do with the relational operators <, >, <=, and <= is to use them 
to compare values of type String. You can legally use == and != to compare Strings, but 
because of peculiarities in the way objects behave, they might not give the results you want. 
(The == operator checks whether two objects are stored in the same memory location, rather 
than whether they contain the same value. Occasionally, for some objects, you do want to make 
such a check — but rarely for strings. I'll get back to this in a later chapter.) Instead, you should 
use the subroutines equalsQ, equalsIgnoreCase () , and compareToO, which were described 
in Section 2.3, to compare two Strings. 

2.5.4 Boolean Operators 

In English, complicated conditions can be formed using the words "and", "or", and "not." For 
example, "If there is a test and you did not study for it...". "And", "or", and "not" are 
boolean operators, and they exist in Java as well as in English. 

In Java, the boolean operator "and" is represented by kk. The kk operator is used to 
combine two boolean values. The result is also a boolean value. The result is true if both 
of the combined values are true, and the result is false if either of the combined values is 
false. For example, "(x == 0) kk (y == 0)" is true if and only if both x is equal to and 
y is equal to 0. 

The boolean operator "or" is represented by I I . (That's supposed to be two of the vertical 
line characters, I .) The expression "A | | B" is true if either A is true or B is true, or if both 
are true. "A | | B" is false only if both A and B are false. 

The operators kk and I I are said to be short-circuited versions of the boolean operators. 
This means that the second operand of && or I I is not necessarily evaluated. Consider the test 

(x != 0) kk (y/x > 1) 

Suppose that the value of x is in fact zero. In that case, the division y/x is undefined math- 
ematically. However, the computer will never perform the division, since when the computer 
evaluates (x != 0), it finds that the result is false, and so it knows that ((x != 0) kk any- 
thing) has to be false. Therefore, it doesn't bother to evaluate the second operand, (y/x > 1) . 
The evaluation has been short-circuited and the division by zero is avoided. Without the short- 
circuiting, there would have been a division by zero. (This may seem like a technicality, and it 
is. But at times, it will make your programming life a little easier.) 

The boolean operator "not" is a unary operator. In Java, it is indicated by ! and is written 
in front of its single operand. For example, if test is a boolean variable, then 

test = ! test; 

will reverse the value of test, changing it from true to false, or from false to true. 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



50 



2.5.5 Conditional Operator 

Any good programming language has some nifty little features that aren't really necessary but 
that let you feel cool when you use them. Java has the conditional operator. It's a ternary 
operator — that is, it has three operands — and it comes in two pieces, ? and :, that have to be 
used together. It takes the form 

(boolean-expression) ? (expressionl) : (expression2) 

The computer tests the value of {boolean-expression) . If the value is true, it evaluates 
(expressionl); otherwise, it evaluates (expression2) . For example: 

next = (N 7, 2 == 0) ? (N/2) : (3*N+1) ; 

will assign the value N/2 to next if N is even (that is, if N % 2 == is true), and it will assign 
the value (3*N+1) to next if N is odd. (The parentheses in this example are not required, but 
they do make the expression easier to read.) 

2.5.6 Assignment Operators and Type-Casts 

You are already familiar with the assignment statement, which uses the symbol "=" to assign 
the value of an expression to a variable. In fact, = is really an operator in the sense that an 
assignment can itself be used as an expression or as part of a more complex expression. The 
value of an assignment such as A=B is the same as the value that is assigned to A. So, if you 
want to assign the value of B to A and test at the same time whether that value is zero, you 
could say: 

if ( (A=B) == ) . . . 

Usually, I would say, don't do things like that! 

In general, the type of the expression on the right-hand side of an assignment statement 
must be the same as the type of the variable on the left-hand side. However, in some cases, 
the computer will automatically convert the value computed by the expression to match the 
type of the variable. Consider the list of numeric types: byte, short, int, long, float, double. 
A value of a type that occurs earlier in this list can be converted automatically to a value that 
occurs later. For example: 



The idea is that conversion should only be done automatically when it can be done without 
changing the semantics of the value. Any int can be converted to a double with the same 
numeric value. However, there are int values that lie outside the legal range of shorts. There 
is simply no way to represent the int 100000 as a short, for example, since the largest value of 
type short is 32767. 

In some cases, you might want to force a conversion that wouldn't be done automatically. 
For this, you can use what is called a type cast. A type cast is indicated by putting a type 
name, in parentheses, in front of the value you want to convert. For example, 



int A; 
double X; 
short B; 



A = 17; 
X = A; 
B = A; 



// OK; A is converted to a double 
// illegal; no automatic conversion 
// from int to short 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



51 



int A; 
short B; 
A = 17; 

B = (short)A; // DK; A is explicitly type cast 
// to a value of type short 

You can do type casts from any numeric type to any other numeric type. However, you should 
note that you might change the numeric value of a number by type-casting it. For example, 
(short) 100000 is -31072. (The -31072 is obtained by taking the 4-byte int 100000 and throwing 
away two of those bytes to obtain a short — you've lost the real information that was in those 
two bytes.) 

As another example of type casts, consider the problem of getting a random integer between 
1 and 6. The function Math . random ( ) gives a real number between 0.0 and 0.9999. . . , and so 
6*Math.random() is between 0.0 and 5.999. . . . The type-cast operator, (int), can be used to 
convert this to an integer: (int) (6*Math.random()). A real number is cast to an integer by 
discarding the fractional part. Thus, (int) (6*Math.random() ) is one of the integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 
4, and 5. To get a number between 1 and 6, we can add 1: "(int) (6*Math. randomO ) + 1". 
(The parentheses around 6*Math. random () are necessary because of precedence rules; without 
the parentheses, the type cast operator would apply only to the 6.) 

You can also type-cast between the type char and the numeric types. The numeric value 
of a char is its Unicode code number. For example, (char)97 is 'a', and (int)'+' is 43. 
(However, a type conversion from char to int is automatic and does not have to be indicated 
with an explicit type cast.) 

Java has several variations on the assignment operator, which exist to save typing. For 
example, "A += B" is defined to be the same as "A = A + B". Every operator in Java that 
applies to two operands gives rise to a similar assignment operator. For example: 



X 


-= y; 


// 


same 


as : 


X 


= X 




y; 








X 


*= y; 


// 


same 


as : 


X 


= X 


* 


y; 








X 


/= y; 


// 


same 


as : 


X 


= X 


/ 


y; 








X 


'/.= y; 


// 


same 


as : 


X 


= X 


% 


y; 


(for 


integers 


x and y) 


q 


&&= p; 


// 


same 


as : 


q 


= q 


ki 


t p; 


(for 


booleans 


q and p) 



The combined assignment operator += even works with strings. Recall that when the + operator 
is used with a string as one of the operands, it represents concatenation. Since str += x is 
equivalent to str = str + x, when += is used with a string on the left-hand side, it appends 
the value on the right-hand side onto the string. For example, if str has the value "tire", then 
the statement str += 'd' ; changes the value of str to "tired". 

2.5.7 Type Conversion of Strings 

In addition to automatic type conversions and explicit type casts, there are some other cases 
where you might want to convert a value of one type into a value of a different type. One 
common example is the conversion of a String value into some other type, such as converting 
the string "10" into the int value 10 or the string "17.42e-2" into the double value 0.1742. In 
Java, these conversions are handled by built-in functions. 

There is a standard class named Integer that contains several subroutines and variables 
related to the int data type. (Recall that since int is not a class, int itself can't contain 
any subroutines or variables.) In particular, if str is any expression of type String, then 
Integer .parselnt (str) is a function call that attempts to convert the value of str into a 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



52 



value of type int. For example, the value of Integer. parselnt("10") is the int value 10. If 
the parameter to Integer .parselnt does not represent a legal int value, then an error occurs. 

Similarly, the standard class named Double includes a function Double .parseDouble that 
tries to convert a parameter of type String into a value of type double. For example, the 
value of the function call Double. parseDouble ("3. 14") is the double value 3.14. (Of course, 
in practice, the parameter used in Double .parseDouble or Integer .parselnt would be a 
variable or expression rather than a constant string.) 

Type conversion functions also exist for converting strings into enumerated type values. 
(Enumerated types, or enums, were introduced in Subsection 2.3.3.) For any enum type, a 
predefined function named valueOf is automatically defined for that type. This is a function 
that takes a string as parameter and tries to convert it to a value belonging to the enum. The 
valueOf function is part of the enum type, so the name of the enum is part of the full name of 
the function. For example, if an enum Suit is defined as 

enum Suit { SPADE, DIAMOND, CLUB, HEART } 

then the name of the type conversion function would be Suit .valueOf . The value of the 
function call Suit . valueOf ("CLUB") would be the enumerated type value Suit. CLUB. For the 
conversion to succeed, the string must exactly match the simple name of one of the enumerated 
type constants (without the "Suit." in front). 



2.5.8 Precedence Rules 

If you use several operators in one expression, and if you don't use parentheses to explicitly 
indicate the order of evaluation, then you have to worry about the precedence rules that deter- 
mine the order of evaluation. (Advice: don't confuse yourself or the reader of your program; 
use parentheses liberally.) 

Here is a listing of the operators discussed in this section, listed in order from highest 
precedence (evaluated first) to lowest precedence (evaluated last): 

Unary operators: ++, — , !, unary - and +, type-cast 

Multiplication and division: *, /, °/ 

Addition and subtraction: +, 

Relational operators: <, >, <=, >= 

Equality and inequality: ==, != 

Boolean and: && 

Boolean or : II 

Conditional operator: ?: 

Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= 

Operators on the same line have the same precedence. When operators of the same precedence 
are strung together in the absence of parentheses, unary operators and assignment operators are 
evaluated right-to-left, while the remaining operators are evaluated left-to-right. For example, 
A*B/C means (A*B)/C, while A=B=C means A=(B=C). (Can you see how the expression A=B=C 
might be useful, given that the value of B=C as an expression is the same as the value that is 
assigned to B?) 



2.6 Programming Environments 

Although the Java language is highly standardized, the procedures for creating, compil- (online) 
ing, and editing Java programs vary widely from one programming environment to another. 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



53 



There are two basic approaches: a command line environment, where the user types com- 
mands and the computer responds, and an integrated development environment (IDE), 
where the user uses the keyboard and mouse to interact with a graphical user interface. While 
there is just one common command line environment for Java programming, there is a wide 
variety of IDEs. 

I cannot give complete or definitive information on Java programming environments in this 
section, but I will try to give enough information to let you compile and run the examples from 
this textbook, at least in a command line environment. There are many IDEs, and I can't 
cover them all here. I will concentrate on Eclipse, one of the most popular IDEs for Java 
programming, but some of the information that is presented will apply to other IDEs as well. 

One thing to keep in mind is that you do not have to pay any money to do Java programming 
(aside from buying a computer, of course). Everything that you need can be downloaded for 
free on the Internet. 

2.6.1 Java Development Kit 

The basic development system for Java programming is usually referred to as the JDK (Java 
Development Kit). It is a part of Java SE, the Java "Standard Edition" (as opposed to Java 
for servers or for mobile devices). This book requires Java Version 5.0 or higher. Confusingly, 
the JDKs that are part of Java Versions 5, 6, and 7 are sometimes referred to as JDK 1.5, 1.6, 
and 1.7. Note that Java SE comes in two versions, a Development Kit version (the JDK) and 
a Runtime Environment version (the JRE). The Runtime can be used to run Java programs 
and to view Java applets in Web pages, but it does not allow you to compile your own Java 
programs. The Development Kit includes the Runtime and adds to it the JDK which lets you 
compile programs. You need a JDK for use with this textbook. 

Java was developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc., which is now a part of the Oracle corporation. 
Oracle makes the JDK for Windows and Linux available for free download at its Java Web site, 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java. If you have a Windows computer, it might have 
come with a Java Runtime, but you might still need to download the JDK. Some versions of 
Linux come with the JDK either installed by default or on the installation media. If you need 
to download and install the JDK, be sure to get JDK 5.0 (or higher). As of August 2010, the 
current version of the JDK is JDK 6, and it can be downloaded from 

http : //www . oracle . com/technetwork/ j ava/ j avase/ downloads/ index . html 

Mac OS comes with Java. Recent versions of Mac OS come with Java Version 5 or Version 
6, so you will not need to download anything. 

If a JDK is properly installed on your computer, you can use the command line environment 
to compile and run Java programs. Most IDEs also require Java to be installed, so even if you 
plan to use an IDE for programming, you probably still need a JDK, or at least a JRE. 

2.6.2 Command Line Environment 

Many modern computer users find the command line environment to be pretty alien and unin- 
tuitive. It is certainly very different from the graphical user interfaces that most people are used 
to. However, it takes only a little practice to learn the basics of the command line environment 
and to become productive using it. 

To use a command line programming environment, you will have to open a window where 
you can type in commands. In Windows, you can open such a command window by running 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



54 



the program named cmd. In recent versions of Windows, it can be found in the "Accessories" 
submenu of the Start menu, under the name "Command Prompt". Alternatively, you can run 
cmd by using the "Run Program" feature in the Start menu, and entering "cmd" as the name of 
the program. In Mac OS, you want to run the Terminal program, which can be found in the 
Utilities folder inside the Applications folder. In Linux, there are several possibilities, including 
an old program called xterm. In Ubuntu Linux, you can use the "Terminal" command under 
"Accessories" in the "Applications" menu. 

No matter what type of computer you are using, when you open a command window, it 
will display a prompt of some sort. Type in a command at the prompt and press return. The 
computer will carry out the command, displaying any output in the command window, and will 
then redisplay the prompt so that you can type another command. One of the central concepts 
in the command line environment is the current directory which contains the files to which 
commands that you type apply. (The words "directory" and "folder" mean the same thing.) 
Often, the name of the current directory is part of the command prompt. You can get a list of 
the files in the current directory by typing in the command dir (on Windows) or Is (on Linux 
and Mac OS). When the window first opens, the current directory is your home directory, 
where all your files are stored. You can change the current directory using the cd command 
with the name of the directory that you want to use. For example, to change into your Desktop 
directory, type in the command cd Desktop and press return. 

You should create a directory (that is, a folder) to hold your Java work. For example, create a 
directory named javawork in your home directory. You can do this using your computer's GUI; 
another way to do it is to open a command window and enter the command mkdir j avawork. 
When you want to work on programming, open a command window and enter the command 
cd javawork to change into your work directory. Of course, you can have more than one 
working directory for your Java work; you can organize your files any way you like. 

* * * 

The most basic commands for using Java on the command line are javac and java; javac 
is used to compile Java source code, and java is used to run Java stand-alone applications. If a 
JDK is correctly installed on your computer, it should recognize these commands when you type 
them in on the command line. Try typing the commands java -version and javac -version 
which should tell you which version of Java is installed. If you get a message such as "Command 
not found," then Java is not correctly installed. If the "java" command works, but "javac" does 
not, it means that a Java Runtime is installed rather than a Development Kit. (On Windows, 
after installing the JDK, you need to modify the Windows PATH variable to make this work. 
See the JDK installation instructions for information about how to do this.) 

To test the javac command, place a copy of TextlO.java into your working directory. (If you 
downloaded the Web site of this book, you can find it in the directory named source; you can 
use your computer's GUI to copy-and-paste this file into your working directory. Alternatively, 
you can navigate to TextlO.java on the book's Web site and use the "Save As" command in 
your Web browser to save a copy of the file into your working directory.) Type the command: 

javac TextlO.java 

This will compile Text 10 .java and will create a bytecode file named Text 10 .class in the same 
directory. Note that if the command succeeds, you will not get any response from the computer; 
it will just redisplay the command prompt to tell you it's ready for another command. 

To test the java command, copy sample program Interest2. java from this book's source 
directory into your working directory. First, compile the program with the command 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



55 



javac Interest2. java 

Remember that for this to succeed, TextIO must already be in the same directory. Then you 
can execute the program using the command 

java Interest2 

Be careful to use just the name of the program, Interest2, with the java command, not the 
name of the Java source code file or the name of the compiled class file. When you give this 
command, the program will run. You will be asked to enter some information, and you will 
respond by typing your answers into the command window, pressing return at the end of the 
line. When the program ends, you will see the command prompt, and you can enter another 
command. 

You can follow the same procedure to run all of the examples in the early sections of this 
book. When you start work with applets, you will need a different way to run the applets. 
That will be discussed later in the book. 

* * * 

To create your own programs, you will need a text editor. A text editor is a computer 
program that allows you to create and save documents that contain plain text. It is important 
that the documents be saved as plain text, that is without any special encoding or formatting 
information. Word processor documents are not appropriate, unless you can get your word 
processor to save as plain text. A good text editor can make programming a lot more pleasant. 
Linux comes with several text editors. On Windows, you can use notepad in a pinch, but you 
will probably want something better. For Mac OS, you might download the free TextWrangler 
application. One possibility that will work on any platform is to use jedit, a good programmer's 
text editor that is itself written in Java and that can be downloaded for free from www.jedit.org. 

To create your own programs, you should open a command line window and cd into the 
working directory where you will store your source code files. Start up your text editor program, 
such as by double-clicking its icon or selecting it from a Start menu. Type your code into the 
editor window, or open an existing source code file that you want to modify. Save the file. 
Remember that the name of a Java source code file must end in ".java", and the rest of the 
file name must match the name of the class that is defined in the file. Once the file is saved in 
your working directory, go to the command window and use the javac command to compile it, 
as discussed above. If there are syntax errors in the code, they will be listed in the command 
window. Each error message contains the line number in the file where the computer found the 
error. Go back to the editor and try to fix the errors, save your changes, and then try the 
javac command again. (It's usually a good idea to just work on the first few errors; sometimes 
fixing those will make other errors go away.) Remember that when the javac command finally 
succeeds, you will get no message at all. Then you can use the java command to run your 
program, as described above. Once you've compiled the program, you can run it as many times 
as you like without recompiling it. 

That's really all there is to it: Keep both editor and command-line window open. Edit, 
save, and compile until you have eliminated all the syntax errors. (Always remember to save 
the file before compiling it — the compiler only sees the saved file, not the version in the editor 
window.) When you run the program, you might find that it has semantic errors that cause it 
to run incorrectly. In that case, you have to go back to the edit /save/compile loop to try to 
find and fix the problem. 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



56 



2.6.3 IDEs and Eclipse 

In an Integrated Development Environment, everything you need to create, compile, and run 
programs is integrated into a single package, with a graphical user interface that will be familiar 
to most computer users. There are many different IDEs for Java program development, ranging 
from fairly simple wrappers around the JDK to highly complex applications with a multitude 
of features. For a beginning programmer, there is a danger in using an IDE, since the difficulty 
of learning to use the IDE, on top of the difficulty of learning to program, can be overwhelming. 
However, for my own programming, I generally use the Eclipse IDE, and I introduce my 
students to it after they have had some experience with the command line. Eclipse has a 
variety of features that are very useful for a beginning programmer. And even though it has 
many advanced features, its design makes it possible to use Eclipse without understanding its 
full complexity. Eclipse is used by many professional programmers and is probably the most 
commonly used Java IDE. 

Eclipse is itself written in Java. It requires Java 1.4 or higher to run, and Java 5.0 or 
higher is recommended. For use with this book, you should be running Eclipse with Java 5.0 or 
higher. Eclipse requires a Java Runtime Environment, not necessarily a JDK. You should make 
sure that the JRE or JDK, Version 5.0 or higher is installed on your computer, as described 
above, before you install Eclipse. Eclipse can be downloaded for free from eclipse.org. You 
can download the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers." 

Another popular choice of IDE is Netbeans , which provides many of the same capabilities 
as Eclipse. Netbeans can be downloaded from netbeans.org, and Oracle offers downloads of 
Netbeans on its Java web site. I like Netbeans a little less than Eclipse, and I won't say much 
about it here. It is, however, quite similar to Eclipse. 

The first time you start Eclipse, you will be asked to specify a workspace, which is the 
directory where all your work will be stored. You can accept the default name, or provide one 
of your own. When startup is complete, the Eclipse window will be filled by a large "Welcome" 
screen that includes links to extensive documentation and tutorials. You can close this screen, 
by clicking the "X" next to the word "Welcome"; you can get back to it later by choosing 
"Welcome" from the "Help" menu. 

The Eclipse GUI consists of one large window that is divided into several sections. Each 
section contains one or more views. If there are several views in one section, then there will 
be tabs at the top of the section to select the view that is displayed in that section. Each view 
displays a different type of information. The whole set of views is called a perspective. Eclipse 
uses different perspectives, that is different sets of views of different types of information, for 
different tasks. For compiling and running programs, the only perspective that you will need 
is the "Java Perspective," which is the default. As you become more experiences, you might 
want to the use the "Debug Perspective," which has features designed to help you find semantic 
errors in programs. 

The Java Perspective includes a large area in the center of the window where you will create 
and edit your Java programs. To the left of this is the Package Explorer view, which will 
contain a list of your Java projects and source code files. To the right are some other views 
that I don't find very useful, and I suggest that you close them by clicking the small "X" next 
to the name of each view. Several other views that will be useful while you are compiling and 
running programs appear in a section of the window below the editing area. If you accidently 
close one of the important views, such as the Package Explorer, you can get it back by selecting 
it from the "Show View" submenu of the "Window" menu. 



* * * 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



57 



To do any work in Eclipse, you need a project. To start a Java project, go to the "New" 
submenu in the "File" menu, and select the "Java Project" command. In the window that 
pops up, it is only necessary to fill in a "Project Name" for the project and click the "Finish" 
button. The project name can be anything you like. The project should appear in the "Package 
Explorer" view. Click on the small triangle next to the project name to see the contents of the 
project. Assuming that you use the default settings, there should be a directory named "src," 
which is where your Java source code files will go. It also contains the "JRE System Library" ; 
this is the collection of standard built-in classes that come with Java. 

To run the TextIO based examples from this textbook, you must add the source code file 
TextlO.java to your project. If you have downloaded the Web site of this book, you can find 
a copy of TextlO.java in the source directory. Alternatively, you can navigate to the file on- 
line and use the "Save As" command of your Web browser to save a copy of the file onto 
your computer. The easiest way to get TextIO into your project is to locate the source code 
file on your computer and drag the file icon onto the project name in the Eclipse window. 
If that doesn't work, you can try using copy-and-paste: Right-click the file icon (or control- 
click on Mac OS), select "Copy" from the pop- up menu, right-click the project name in the 
Eclipse window, and select "Paste". If you also have trouble with that, you can try using the 
"Import" command in Eclipse's "File" menu; select "File System" (under "General") in the 
window that pops up, click "Next" , and provide the necessary information in the next window. 
(Unfortunately, using the file import window is rather complicated. If you find that you have 
to use it, you should consult the Eclipse documentation about it.) In any case, TextIO should 
appear in the src directory of your project, inside a package named "default package". Once 
a file is in this list, you can open it by double-clicking it; it will appear in the editing area of 
the Eclipse window. 

To run any of the Java programs from this textbook, copy the source code file into your 
Eclipse Java project in the same way that you did for TextlO.java. To run the program, right- 
click the file name in the Package Explorer view (or control-click in Mac OS). In the menu that 
pops up, go to the "Run As" submenu, and select "Java Application". The program will be 
executed. If the program writes to standard output, the output will appear in the "Console" 
view, in the area of the Eclipse window below the editing area. If the program uses TextIO for 
input, you will have to type the required input into the "Console" view — click the "Console" 
view before you start typing, so that the characters that you type will be sent to the 
correct part of the window. (Note that if you don't like doing I/O in the "Console" view, 
you can use an alternative version of TextlO.java that opens a separate window for I/O. You 
can find this "GUI" version of TextIO in a directory named Text ID -GUI inside this textbook's 
source directory.) 

You can have more than one program in the same Eclipse project, or you can create addi- 
tional projects to organize your work better. Remember to place a copy of TextlO.java in any 
project that requires it. 

* * * 

To create your own Java program, you must create a new Java class. To do this, right-click 
the Java project name in the "Project Explorer" view. Go to the "New" submenu of the popup 
menu, and select "Class" . (Alternatively, there is a small icon at the top of the Eclipse window 
that you can click to create a new Java class.) In the window that opens, type in the name of 
the class, and click the "Finish" button. The class name must be a legal Java identifier. Note 
that you want the name of the class, not the name of the source code file, so don't add ".java" 
at the end of the name. The class should appear inside the "default package," and it should

automatically open in the editing area so that you can start typing in your program. 

Eclipse has several features that aid you as you type your code. It will underline any syntax 
error with a jagged red line, and in some cases will place an error marker in the left border of 
the edit window. If you hover the mouse cursor over the error marker or over the error itself, 
a description of the error will appear. Note that you do not have to get rid of every error 
immediately as you type; some errors will go away as you type in more of the program. If an 
error marker displays a small "light bulb," Eclipse is offering to try to fix the error for you. 
Click the light bulb to get a list of possible fixes, then double click the fix that you want to 
apply. For example, if you use an undeclared variable in your program, Eclipse will offer to 
declare it for you. You can actually use this error-correcting feature to get Eclipse to write 
certain types of code for you! Unfortunately, you'll find that you won't understand a lot of the 
proposed fixes until you learn more about the Java language, and it is not a good idea to apply 
a fix that you don't understand — often that will just make things worse in the end. 

Eclipse will also look for spelling errors in comments and will underline them with jagged 
red lines. Hover your mouse over the error to get a list of possible correct spellings. 

Another essential Eclipse feature is content assist. Content assist can be invoked by typing 
Control-Space. It will offer possible completions of whatever you are typing at the moment. For 
example, if you type part of an identifier and hit Control-Space, you will get a list of identifiers 
that start with the characters that you have typed; use the up and down arrow keys to select one 
of the items in the list, and press Return or Enter. (Or hit Escape to dismiss the list.) If there 
is only one possible completion when you hit Control-Space, it will be inserted automatically. 
By default, Content Assist will also pop up automatically, after a short delay, when you type 
a period or certain other characters. For example, if you type "Text 10." and pause for just a 
fraction of a second, you will get a list of all the subroutines in the TextIO class. Personally, I 
find this auto- activation annoying. You can disable it in the Eclipse Preferences. (Look under 
Java / Editor / Content Assist, and turn off the "Enable auto activation" option.) You can 
still call up Code Assist manually with Control-Space. 

Once you have an error-free program, you can run it as described above, by right-clicking its 
name in the Package Explorer and using "Run As / Java Application" . You can also right-click 
on the program itself in an editor window. If you find a problem when you run it, it's very easy 
to go back to the editor, make changes, and run it again. Note that using Eclipse, there is no 
explicit "compile" command. The source code files in your project are automatically compiled, 
and are re-compiled whenever you modify them. 

If you use Netbeans instead of Eclipse, the procedures are similar. You still have to create 
new project (of type "Java Application"). You can add an existing source code file to a project 
by dragging the file onto the "Source Packages" folder in the project, and you can create 
your own classes by right-clicking the project name and selecting New/ Java Class. To run a 
program, right-click the file that contains the main routine, and select the "Run File" command. 
Netbeans has a "Code Completion" feature that is similar to Eclipse's "Content Assist." One 
thing that you have to watch with Netbeans is that it might want to create classes in (non- 
default) packages; when you create a New Java Class, make sure that the "Package" input box 
is left blank. 

2.6.4 The Problem of Packages 

Every class in Java is contained in something called a package. Classes that are not explicitly 
put into a different package are in the "default" package. Almost all the examples in this 



CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS 



59 



textbook are in the default package, and I will not even discuss packages in any depth until 
Section 4.5. However, some IDEs might force you to pay attention to packages. 

When you create a class in Eclipse, you might notice a message that says that "The use 
of the default package is discouraged." Although this is true, I have chosen to use it anyway, 
since it seems easier for beginning programmers to avoid the whole issue of packages, at least at 
first. Some IDEs, like Netbeans, are even less willing than Eclipse to use the default package: 
Netbeans inserts a package name automatically in the class creation dialog, and you have to 
delete that name if you want to create the class in the default package. If you do create a class 
in a package, the source code starts with a line that specifies which package the class is in. For 
example, if the class is in a package named test .pkg, then the first line of the source code will 
be 

package test. pkg; 

In an IDE, this will not cause any problem unless the program you are writing depends on 
TextlO. You will not be able to use TextIO in a program unless TextIO is in the same package 
as the program. You can put TextIO in a named, non-default package, but you have to modify 
the source code file TextlO.java to specify the package: Just add a package statement like the 
one shown above to the very beginning of the file, with the appropriate package name. (The 
IDE might do this for you, if you copy TextlO.java into a non-default package.) Once you've 
done this, the example should run in the same way as if it were in the default package. 

By the way, if you use packages in a command- line environment, other complications arise. 
For example, if a class is in a package named test .pkg, then the source code file must be in a 
subdirectory named "pkg" inside a directory named "test" that is in turn inside your main Java 
working directory. Nevertheless, when you compile or execute the program, you should be in 
the main directory, not in a subdirectory. When you compile the source code file, you have to 
include the name of the directory in the command: Use "javac test/pkg/ClassName . java" 
on Linux or Mac OS, or "javac test \pkg\ClassName . java" on Windows. The command 
for executing the program is then "java test. pkg. ClassName", with a period separating the 
package name from the class name. However, you will not need to worry about any of that 
when working with almost all of the examples in this book.

2. Write a program that simulates rolling a pair of dice. You can simulate rolling one die by (solution) 
choosing one of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 at random. The number you pick represents 
the number on the die after it is rolled. As pointed out in Section 2.5, The expression 

(int) (Math. random 0*6) + 1 

does the computation you need to select a random integer between 1 and 6. You can 
assign this value to a variable to represent one of the dice that are being rolled. Do this 
twice and add the results together to get the total roll. Your program should report the 
number showing on each die as well as the total roll. For example:

4. Write a program that helps the user count his change. The program should ask how many (solution) 
quarters the user has, then how many dimes, then how many nickels, then how many 

pennies. Then the program should tell the user how much money he has, expressed in 
dollars.

how many extra eggs are left over. 

A gross of eggs is equal to 144 eggs. Extend your program so that it will tell the user 
how many gross, how many dozen, and how many left over eggs she has. For example, if 
the user says that she has 1342 eggs, then your program would respond with 



Your number of eggs is 9 gross, 3 dozen, and 10

Chapter 3 



Programming in the Small II: 
Control 

The basic building blocks of programs — variables, expressions, assignment statements, and 
subroutine call statements — were covered in the previous chapter. Starting with this chapter, 
we look at how these building blocks can be put together to build complex programs with more 
interesting behavior. 

Since we are still working on the level of "programming in the small" in this chapter, we are 
interested in the kind of complexity that can occur within a single subroutine. On this level, 
complexity is provided by control structures. The two types of control structures, loops and 
branches, can be used to repeat a sequence of statements over and over or to choose among two 
or more possible courses of action. Java includes several control structures of each type, and 
we will look at each of them in some detail. 

This chapter will also begin the study of program design. Given a problem, how can you 
come up with a program to solve that problem? We'll look at a partial answer to this question 
in Section 3.2. 

3.1 Blocks, Loops, and Branches 

The ability of a computer to perform complex tasks is built on just a few ways of (online) 

combining simple commands into control structures. In Java, there are just six such structures 

that are used to determine the normal flow of control in a program — and, in fact, just three 

of them would be enough to write programs to perform any task. The six control structures 

are: the block, the while loop, the do.. while loop, the for loop, the if statement, and the 

switch statement. Each of these structures is considered to be a single "statement," but each 

is in fact a structured statement that can contain one or more other statements inside itself. 

3.1.1 Blocks 

The block is the simplest type of structured statement. Its purpose is simply to group a 
sequence of statements into a single statement. The format of a block is: 

{ 

(statements } 

} 



63 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



64 



That is, it consists of a sequence of statements enclosed between a pair of braces, "{" and "}" . 
In fact, it is possible for a block to contain no statements at all; such a block is called an empty 
block, and can actually be useful at times. An empty block consists of nothing but an empty 
pair of braces. Block statements usually occur inside other statements, where their purpose is 
to group together several statements into a unit. However, a block can be legally used wherever 
a statement can occur. There is one place where a block is required: As you might have already 
noticed in the case of the main subroutine of a program, the definition of a subroutine is a 
block, since it is a sequence of statements enclosed inside a pair of braces. 

I should probably note again at this point that Java is what is called a free-format language. 
There are no syntax rules about how the language has to be arranged on a page. So, for example, 
you could write an entire block on one line if you want. But as a matter of good programming 
style, you should lay out your program on the page in a way that will make its structure as 
clear as possible. In general, this means putting one statement per line and using indentation 
to indicate statements that are contained inside control structures. This is the format that I 
will generally use in my examples. 

Here are two examples of blocks: 

{ 

System. out .print ("The answer is "); 
System. out .println(ans) ; 

} 

{ // This block exchanges the values of x and y 

int temp; // A temporary variable for use in this block, 

temp = x; // Save a copy of the value of x in temp, 

x = y; // Copy the value of y into x. 

y = temp; // Copy the value of temp into y. 

} 

In the second example, a variable, temp, is declared inside the block. This is perfectly legal, 
and it is good style to declare a variable inside a block if that variable is used nowhere else 
but inside the block. A variable declared inside a block is completely inaccessible and invisible 
from outside that block. When the computer executes the variable declaration statement, it 
allocates memory to hold the value of the variable. When the block ends, that memory is 
discarded (that is, made available for reuse). The variable is said to be local to the block. 
There is a general concept called the "scope" of an identifier. The scope of an identifier is the 
part of the program in which that identifier is valid. The scope of a variable defined inside a 
block is limited to that block, and more specifically to the part of the block that comes after 
the declaration of the variable. 

3.1.2 The Basic While Loop 

The block statement by itself really doesn't affect the flow of control in a program. The five 
remaining control structures do. They can be divided into two classes: loop statements and 
branching statements. You really just need one control structure from each category in order to 
have a completely general-purpose programming language. More than that is just convenience. 
In this section, I'll introduce the while loop and the if statement. I'll give the full details of 
these statements and of the other three control structures in later sections. 

A while loop is used to repeat a given statement over and over. Of course, it's not likely 
that you would want to keep repeating it forever. That would be an infinite loop, which is 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



65 



generally a bad thing. (There is an old story about computer pioneer Grace Murray Hopper, 
who read instructions on a bottle of shampoo telling her to "lather, rinse, repeat." As the story 
goes, she claims that she tried to follow the directions, but she ran out of shampoo. (In case 
you don't get it, this is a joke about the way that computers mindlessly follow instructions.)) 
To be more specific, a while loop will repeat a statement over and over, but only so long 
as a specified condition remains true. A while loop has the form: 

while ((boolean-expression)) 
(statement ) 

Since the statement can be, and usually is, a block, many while loops have the form: 

while ((boolean-expression)) { 
(statements ) 

y 

Some programmers think that the braces should always be included as a matter of style, even 
when there is only one statement between them, but I don't always follow that advice myself. 

The semantics of the while statement go like this: When the computer comes to a while 
statement, it evaluates the (boolean-expression) , which yields either true or false as its value. 
If the value is false, the computer skips over the rest of the while loop and proceeds to the 
next command in the program. If the value of the expression is true, the computer executes 
the (statement) or block of (statements) inside the loop. Then it returns to the beginning of 
the while loop and repeats the process. That is, it re-evaluates the (boolean-expression) , ends 
the loop if the value is false, and continues it if the value is true. This will continue over 
and over until the value of the expression is false; if that never happens, then there will be an 
infinite loop. 

Here is an example of a while loop that simply prints out the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5: 

int number; // The number to be printed, 
number =1; // Start with 1. 

while ( number < 6 ) { // Keep going as long as number is < 6. 
System. out . println (number) ; 

number = number + 1 ; // Go on to the next number . 

} 

System. out .printlnC'Done ! ") ; 

The variable number is initialized with the value 1. So the first time through the while loop, 
when the computer evaluates the expression "number < 6" , it is asking whether 1 is less than 
6, which is true. The computer therefore proceeds to execute the two statements inside the 
loop. The first statement prints out "1". The second statement adds 1 to number and stores the 
result back into the variable number; the value of number has been changed to 2. The computer 
has reached the end of the loop, so it returns to the beginning and asks again whether number is 
less than 6. Once again this is true, so the computer executes the loop again, this time printing 
out 2 as the value of number and then changing the value of number to 3. It continues in this 
way until eventually number becomes equal to 6. At that point, the expression "number < 6" 
evaluates to false. So, the computer jumps past the end of the loop to the next statement 
and prints out the message "Done!". Note that when the loop ends, the value of number is 6, 
but the last value that was printed was 5. 

By the way, you should remember that you'll never see a while loop standing by itself 
in a real program. It will always be inside a subroutine which is itself defined inside some 
class. As an example of a while loop used inside a complete program, here is a little program 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



GO 



that computes the interest on an investment over several years. This is an improvement over 
examples from the previous chapter that just reported the results for one year: 

/** 

* This class implements a simple program that will compute the amount of 

* interest that is earned on an investment over a period of 5 years. The 

* initial amount of the investment and the interest rate are input by the 

* user. The value of the investment at the end of each year is output. 
*/ 

public class Interest3 { 

public static void main(String[] args) { 

double principal; // The value of the investment, 
double rate; // The annual interest rate. 

/* Get the initial investment and interest rate from the user. */ 

System. out. print ("Enter the initial investment: "); 
principal = TextlD.getlnDoubleO ; 

System, out .printlnO ; 

System. out .printlnC'Enter the annual interest rate."); 
System. out .print ("Enter a decimal, not a percentage: "); 
rate = TextlO.getlnDoubleO ; 
System, out .printlnO ; 

/* Simulate the investment for 5 years. */ 

int years; // Counts the number of years that have passed. 

years = 0; 

while (years < 5) { 

double interest; // Interest for this year. 

interest = principal * rate; 

principal = principal + interest; // Add it to principal, 

years = years + 1 ; // Count the current year . 
System. out .print ("The value of the investment after "); 
System. out .print (years) ; 
System. out .print (" years is $"); 
System, out .printf ("7 1 . 2f " , principal) ; 
System, out .printlnO ; 
} // end of while loop 

} // end of mainO 

} // end of class Interest3 

You should study this program, and make sure that you understand what the computer does 
step- by-step as it executes the while loop. 

3.1.3 The Basic If Statement 

An if statement tells the computer to take one of two alternative courses of action, depending 
on whether the value of a given boolean-valued expression is true or false. It is an example of 
a "branching" or "decision" statement. An if statement has the form: 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



67 



if ( (boolean-expression) ) 
(statement ) 

else 

(statement ) 

When the computer executes an if statement, it evaluates the boolean expression. If the value 
is true, the computer executes the first statement and skips the statement that follows the 
"else". If the value of the expression is false, then the computer skips the first statement and 
executes the second one. Note that in any case, one and only one of the two statements inside 
the if statement is executed. The two statements represent alternative courses of action; the 
computer decides between these courses of action based on the value of the boolean expression. 

In many cases, you want the computer to choose between doing something and not doing 
it. You can do this with an if statement that omits the else part: 

if ( (boolean-expression) ) 
(statement ) 

To execute this statement, the computer evaluates the expression. If the value is true, the 
computer executes the (statement) that is contained inside the if statement; if the value is 
false, the computer skips over that (statement). 

Of course, either or both of the (statements) in an if statement can be a block, and again 
many programmers prefer to add the braces even when they contain just a single statement. 
So an if statement often looks like: 

if ( (boolean-expression) ) { 
(statements ) 

y 

else { 

(statements ) 

} 

or: 

if ( (boolean-expression) ) { 
(statements ) 

} 

As an example, here is an if statement that exchanges the value of two variables, x and y, 
but only if x is greater than y to begin with. After this if statement has been executed, we 
can be sure that the value of x is definitely less than or equal to the value of y: 

if ( x > y ) { 

int temp; // A temporary variable for use in this block, 

temp = x; // Save a copy of the value of x in temp, 

x = y; // Copy the value of y into x. 

y = temp; // Copy the value of temp into y. 

} 

Finally, here is an example of an if statement that includes an else part. See if you can 
figure out what it does, and why it would be used: 

if ( years > 1 ) { // handle case for 2 or more years 

System. out .print ("The value of the investment after "); 
System. out .print (years) ; 
System. out .print (" years is $"); 

} 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



GS 



else { // handle case for 1 year 

System. out .print ("The value of the investment after 1 year is $"); 
} // end of if statement 

System. out .printf ("7,1 . 2f" , principal); // this is done in any case 

I'll have more to say about control structures later in this chapter. But you already know 
the essentials. If you never learned anything more about control structures, you would already 
know enough to perform any possible computing task. Simple looping and branching are all 
you really need! 

3.2 Algorithm Development 

Programming is difficult (like many activities that are useful and worthwhile — and like (online) 
most of those activities, it can also be rewarding and a lot of fun). When you write a program, 
you have to tell the computer every small detail of what to do. And you have to get everything 
exactly right, since the computer will blindly follow your program exactly as written. How, 
then, do people write any but the most simple programs? It's not a big mystery, actually. It's 
a matter of learning to think in the right way. 

A program is an expression of an idea. A programmer starts with a general idea of a task 
for the computer to perform. Presumably, the programmer has some idea of how to perform 
the task by hand, at least in general outline. The problem is to flesh out that outline into a 
complete, unambiguous, step-by-step procedure for carrying out the task. Such a procedure is 
called an "algorithm." (Technically, an algorithm is an unambiguous, step-by-step procedure 
that terminates after a finite number of steps; we don't want to count procedures that go on 
forever.) An algorithm is not the same as a program. A program is written in some particular 
programming language. An algorithm is more like the idea behind the program, but it's the idea 
of the steps the program will take to perform its task, not just the idea of the task itself. When 
describing an algorithm, the steps don't necessarily have to be specified in complete detail, as 
long as the steps are unambiguous and it's clear that carrying out the steps will accomplish the 
assigned task. An algorithm can be expressed in any language, including English. Of course, 
an algorithm can only be expressed as a program if all the details have been filled in. 

So, where do algorithms come from? Usually, they have to be developed, often with a lot of 
thought and hard work. Skill at algorithm development is something that comes with practice, 
but there are techniques and guidelines that can help. I'll talk here about some techniques and 
guidelines that are relevant to "programming in the small," and I will return to the subject 
several times in later chapters. 

3.2.1 Pseudocode and Stepwise Refinement 

When programming in the small, you have a few basics to work with: variables, assignment 
statements, and input/output routines. You might also have some subroutines, objects, or 
other building blocks that have already been written by you or someone else. (Input /output 
routines fall into this class.) You can build sequences of these basic instructions, and you can 
also combine them into more complex control structures such as while loops and if statements. 

Suppose you have a task in mind that you want the computer to perform. One way to 
proceed is to write a description of the task, and take that description as an outline of the 
algorithm you want to develop. Then you can refine and elaborate that description, gradually 
adding steps and detail, until you have a complete algorithm that can be translated directly 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



69 



into programming language. This method is called stepwise refinement, and it is a type of 
top-down design. As you proceed through the stages of stepwise refinement, you can write out 
descriptions of your algorithm in pseudocode — informal instructions that imitate the structure 
of programming languages without the complete detail and perfect syntax of actual program 
code. 

As an example, let's see how one might develop the program from the previous section, which 
computes the value of an investment over five years. The task that you want the program to 
perform is: "Compute and display the value of an investment for each of the next five years, 
where the initial investment and interest rate are to be specified by the user." You might then 
write — or at least think — that this can be expanded as: 

Get the user's input 

Compute the value of the investment after 1 year 

Display the value 

Compute the value after 2 years 

Display the value 

Compute the value after 3 years 

Display the value 

Compute the value after 4 years 

Display the value 

Compute the value after 5 years 

Display the value 

This is correct, but rather repetitive. And seeing that repetition, you might notice an 
opportunity to use a loop. A loop would take less typing. More important, it would be more 
general: Essentially the same loop will work no matter how many years you want to process. 
So, you might rewrite the above sequence of steps as: 

Get the user's input 

while there are more years to process: 

Compute the value after the next year 
Display the value 

Following this algorithm would certainly solve the problem, but for a computer we'll have 
to be more explicit about how to "Get the user's input," how to "Compute the value after the 
next year," and what it means to say "there are more years to process." We can expand the 
step, "Get the user's input" into 

Ask the user for the initial investment 
Read the user's response 
Ask the user for the interest rate 
Read the user's response 

To fill in the details of the step "Compute the value after the next year," you have to 
know how to do the computation yourself. (Maybe you need to ask your boss or professor for 
clarification?) Let's say you know that the value is computed by adding some interest to the 
previous value. Then we can refine the while loop to: 

while there are more years to process: 
Compute the interest 
Add the interest to the value 
Display the value 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



70 



As for testing whether there are more years to process, the only way that we can do that is 
by counting the years ourselves. This displays a very common pattern, and you should expect 
to use something similar in a lot of programs: We have to start with zero years, add one each 
time we process a year, and stop when we reach the desired number of years. So the while 
loop becomes: 

years = 

while years < 5: 

years = years + 1 

Compute the interest 

Add the interest to the value 

Display the value 

We still have to know how to compute the interest. Let's say that the interest is to be 
computed by multiplying the interest rate by the current value of the investment. Putting 
this together with the part of the algorithm that gets the user's inputs, we have the complete 
algorithm: 

Ask the user for the initial investment 

Read the user's response 

Ask the user for the interest rate 

Read the user's response 

years = 

while years < 5: 

years = years + 1 

Compute interest = value * interest rate 
Add the interest to the value 
Display the value 

Finally, we are at the point where we can translate pretty directly into proper programming- 
language syntax. We still have to choose names for the variables, decide exactly what we want 
to say to the user, and so forth. Having done this, we could express our algorithm in Java as: 

double principal, rate, interest; // declare the variables 
int years ; 

System. out. print ("Type initial investment: "); 

principal = TextlO.getlnDoubleO ; 

System. out. print ("Type interest rate: "); 

rate = TextlO.getlnDoubleO; 

years = 0; 

while (years < 5) { 

years = years + 1; 

interest = principal * rate; 

principal = principal + interest; 

System. out .println (principal) ; 

} 

This still needs to be wrapped inside a complete program, it still needs to be commented, 
and it really needs to print out more information in a nicer format for the user. But it's 
essentially the same program as the one in the previous section. (Note that the pseudocode 
algorithm uses indentation to show which statements are inside the loop. In Java, indentation 
is completely ignored by the computer, so you need a pair of braces to tell the computer which 
statements are in the loop. If you leave out the braces, the only statement inside the loop would 
be "years = years + 1 ; " . The other statements would only be executed once, after the loop 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



71 



ends. The nasty thing is that the computer won't notice this error for you, like it would if you 
left out the parentheses around "(years < 5)". The parentheses are required by the syntax of 
the while statement. The braces are only required semantically. The computer can recognize 
syntax errors but not semantic errors.) 

One thing you should have noticed here is that my original specification of the problem — 
"Compute and display the value of an investment for each of the next five years" — was far from 
being complete. Before you start writing a program, you should make sure you have a complete 
specification of exactly what the program is supposed to do. In particular, you need to know 
what information the program is going to input and output and what computation it is going 
to perform. Here is what a reasonably complete specification of the problem might look like in 
this example: 

"Write a program that will compute and display the value of 
an investment for each of the next five years. Each year, interest 
is added to the value. The interest is computed by multiplying 
the current value by a fixed interest rate. Assume that the initial 
value and the rate of interest are to be input by the user when the 
program is run." 

3.2.2 The 3N+1 Problem 

Let's do another example, working this time with a program that you haven't already seen. The 
assignment here is an abstract mathematical problem that is one of my favorite programming 
exercises. This time, we'll start with a more complete specification of the task to be performed: 

"Given a positive integer, N, define the '3N+1' sequence start- 
ing from N as follows: If N is an even number, then divide N by 
two; but if N is odd, then multiply N by 3 and add 1. Continue 
to generate numbers in this way until N becomes equal to 1. For 
example, starting from N = 3, which is odd, we multiply by 3 and 
add 1, giving N = 3*3+1 = 10. Then, since N is even, we divide 
by 2, giving N = 10/2 = 5. We continue in this way, stopping 
when we reach 1, giving the complete sequence: 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 
2, 1. 

"Write a program that will read a positive integer from the 
user and will print out the 3N+1 sequence starting from that 
integer. The program should also count and print out the number 
of terms in the sequence." 

A general outline of the algorithm for the program we want is: 

Get a positive integer N from the user. 

Compute, print, and count each number in the sequence. 

Output the number of terms . 

The bulk of the program is in the second step. We'll need a loop, since we want to keep 
computing numbers until we get 1. To put this in terms appropriate for a while loop, we need 
to know when to continue the loop rather than when to stop it: We want to continue as long 
as the number is not 1. So, we can expand our pseudocode algorithm to: 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



72 



Get a positive integer N from the user; 
while N is not 1: 

Compute N = next term; 

Output N; 

Count this term; 
Output the number of terms; 

In order to compute the next term, the computer must take different actions depending on 
whether N is even or odd. We need an if statement to decide between the two cases: 

Get a positive integer N from the user; 
while N is not 1: 

if N is even: 

Compute N = N/2; 

else 

Compute N = 3 * N + 1; 
Output N; 
Count this term; 
Output the number of terms; 

We are almost there. The one problem that remains is counting. Counting means that you 
start with zero, and every time you have something to count, you add one. We need a variable 
to do the counting. (Again, this is a common pattern that you should expect to see over and 
over.) With the counter added, we get: 

Get a positive integer N from the user; 
Let counter = 0; 
while N is not 1: 

if N is even: 

Compute N = N/2; 

else 

Compute N = 3 * N + 1; 
Output N; 
Add 1 to counter; 
Output the counter; 

We still have to worry about the very first step. How can we get a positive integer from the 
user? If we just read in a number, it's possible that the user might type in a negative number 
or zero. If you follow what happens when the value of N is negative or zero, you'll see that the 
program will go on forever, since the value of N will never become equal to 1. This is bad. In 
this case, the problem is probably no big deal, but in general you should try to write programs 
that are foolproof. One way to fix this is to keep reading in numbers until the user types in a 
positive number: 

Ask user to input a positive number; 
Let N be the user's response; 
while N is not positive: 
Print an error message; 
Read another value for N; 
Let counter = 0; 
while N is not 1: 
if N is even: 

Compute N = N/2; 
else 

Compute N = 3 * N + 1; 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



73 



Output N; 
Add 1 to counter; 
Output the counter; 

The first while loop will end only when N is a positive number, as required. (A common 
beginning programmer's error is to use an if statement instead of a while statement here: "If 
N is not positive, ask the user to input another value." The problem arises if the second number 
input by the user is also non-positive. The if statement is only executed once, so the second 
input number is never tested, and the program proceeds into an infinite loop. With the while 
loop, after the second number is input, the computer jumps back to the beginning of the loop 
and tests whether the second number is positive. If not, it asks the user for a third number, 
and it will continue asking for numbers until the user enters an acceptable input.) 

Here is a Java program implementing this algorithm. It uses the operators <= to mean "is 
less than or equal to" and != to mean "is not equal to." To test whether N is even, it uses 
"N % 2 == 0". All the operators used here were discussed in Section 2.5. 

/** 

* This program prints out a 3N+1 sequence starting from a positive 

* integer specified by the user. It also counts the number of 

* terms in the sequence, and prints out that number. 
*/

public static void main(String [] args) { 

int N; // for computing terms in the sequence 

int counter; // for counting the terms

N = TextlO.getlnlntO ; 
while (N <= 0) { 

Text 10. put ("The starting point must be positive. Please try again: ");

if (N 7. 2 == 0)

TextlO. put (counter) ; 

TextlO.putlnO' terms in the sequence."); 
} // end of mainO 
y II end of class ThreeNl 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



74 



Two final notes on this program: First, you might have noticed that the first term of the 
sequence — the value of N input by the user — is not printed or counted by this program. Is 
this an error? It's hard to say. Was the specification of the program careful enough to decide? 
This is the type of thing that might send you back to the boss/professor for clarification. The 
problem (if it is one!) can be fixed easily enough. Just replace the line "counter = 0" before 
the while loop with the two lines: 

TextIO .putln(N) ; // print out initial term 
counter = 1 ; // and count it 

Second, there is the question of why this problem is at all interesting. Well, it's interesting 
to mathematicians and computer scientists because of a simple question about the problem that 
they haven't been able to answer: Will the process of computing the 3N+1 sequence finish after 
a finite number of steps for all possible starting values of N? Although individual sequences are 
easy to compute, no one has been able to answer the general question. To put this another 
way, no one knows whether the process of computing 3N+1 sequences can properly be called 
an algorithm, since an algorithm is required to terminate after a finite number of steps! (This 
discussion assumes that the value of N can take on arbitrarily large integer values, which is not 
true for a variable of type int in a Java program. When the value of N in the program becomes 
too large to be represented as a 32-bit int, the values output by the program are no longer 
mathematically correct. See Exercise 8.2) 

3.2.3 Coding, Testing, Debugging 

It would be nice if, having developed an algorithm for your program, you could relax, press a 
button, and get a perfectly working program. Unfortunately, the process of turning an algorithm 
into Java source code doesn't always go smoothly. And when you do get to the stage of a working 
program, it's often only working in the sense that it does something. Unfortunately not what 
you want it to do. 

After program design comes coding: translating the design into a program written in Java 
or some other language. Usually, no matter how careful you are, a few syntax errors will creep 
in from somewhere, and the Java compiler will reject your program with some kind of error 
message. Unfortunately, while a compiler will always detect syntax errors, it's not very good 
about telling you exactly what's wrong. Sometimes, it's not even good about telling you where 
the real error is. A spelling error or missing "{" on line 45 might cause the compiler to choke 
on line 105. You can avoid lots of errors by making sure that you really understand the syntax 
rules of the language and by following some basic programming guidelines. For example, I 
never type a "{" without typing the matching "}". Then I go back and fill in the statements 
between the braces. A missing or extra brace can be one of the hardest errors to find in a large 
program. Always, always indent your program nicely. If you change the program, change the 
indentation to match. It's worth the trouble. Use a consistent naming scheme, so you don't 
have to struggle to remember whether you called that variable interestrate or interestRate. 
In general, when the compiler gives multiple error messages, don't try to fix the second error 
message from the compiler until you've fixed the first one. Once the compiler hits an error in 
your program, it can get confused, and the rest of the error messages might just be guesses. 
Maybe the best advice is: Take the time to understand the error before you try to fix it. 
Programming is not an experimental science. 

When your program compiles without error, you are still not done. You have to test the 
program to make sure it works correctly. Remember that the goal is not to get the right output 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



75 



for the two sample inputs that the professor gave in class. The goal is a program that will 
work correctly for all reasonable inputs. Ideally, when faced with an unreasonable input, it 
should respond by gently chiding the user rather than by crashing. Test your program on a 
wide variety of inputs. Try to find a set of inputs that will test the full range of functionality 
that you've coded into your program. As you begin writing larger programs, write them in 
stages and test each stage along the way. You might even have to write some extra code to 
do the testing — for example to call a subroutine that you've just written. You don't want to 
be faced, if you can avoid it, with 500 newly written lines of code that have an error in there 
somewhere. 

The point of testing is to find bugs — semantic errors that show up as incorrect behavior 
rather than as compilation errors. And the sad fact is that you will probably find them. Again, 
you can minimize bugs by careful design and careful coding, but no one has found a way to 
avoid them altogether. Once you've detected a bug, it's time for debugging . You have to 
track down the cause of the bug in the program's source code and eliminate it. Debugging is a 
skill that, like other aspects of programming, requires practice to master. So don't be afraid of 
bugs. Learn from them. One essential debugging skill is the ability to read source code — the 
ability to put aside preconceptions about what you think it does and to follow it the way the 
computer does — mechanically, step-by-step — to see what it really does. This is hard. I can still 
remember the time I spent hours looking for a bug only to find that a line of code that I had 
looked at ten times had a "1" where it should have had an "i", or the time when I wrote a 
subroutine named WindowClosing which would have done exactly what I wanted except that 
the computer was looking for windowClosing (with a lower case "w"). Sometimes it can help 
to have someone who doesn't share your preconceptions look at your code. 

Often, it's a problem just to find the part of the program that contains the error. Most 
programming environments come with a debugger, which is a program that can help you find 
bugs. Typically, your program can be run under the control of the debugger. The debugger 
allows you to set "breakpoints" in your program. A breakpoint is a point in the program where 
the debugger will pause the program so you can look at the values of the program's variables. 
The idea is to track down exactly when things start to go wrong during the program's execution. 
The debugger will also let you execute your program one line at a time, so that you can watch 
what happens in detail once you know the general area in the program where the bug is lurking. 

I will confess that I only occasionally use debuggers myself. A more traditional approach to 
debugging is to insert debugging statements into your program. These are output statements 
that print out information about the state of the program. Typically, a debugging statement 
would say something like 

System. out .println(" At start of while loop, N = " + N) ; 

You need to be able to tell from the output where in your program the output is coming from, 
and you want to know the value of important variables. Sometimes, you will find that the 
computer isn't even getting to a part of the program that you think it should be executing. 
Remember that the goal is to find the first point in the program where the state is not what 
you expect it to be. That's where the bug is. 

And finally, remember the golden rule of debugging: If you are absolutely sure that every- 
thing in your program is right, and if it still doesn't work, then one of the things that you are 
absolutely sure of is wrong. 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



76 



3.3 The while and do.. while Statements 

Statements in Java can be either simple statements or compound statements. Simple (online) 
statements, such as assignment statements and subroutine call statements, are the basic building 
blocks of a program. Compound statements, such as while loops and if statements, are used to 
organize simple statements into complex structures, which are called control structures because 
they control the order in which the statements are executed. The next five sections explore 
the details of control structures that are available in Java, starting with the while statement 
and the do. .while statement in this section. At the same time, we'll look at examples of 
programming with each control structure and apply the techniques for designing algorithms 
that were introduced in the previous section. 

3.3.1 The while Statement 

The while statement was already introduced in Section 3.1. A while loop has the form 

while ( (boolean-expression) ) 
(statement ) 

The (statement) can, of course, be a block statement consisting of several statements grouped 
together between a pair of braces. This statement is called the body of the loop. The body 
of the loop is repeated as long as the (boolean- expression) is true. This boolean expression is 
called the continuation condition, or more simply the test, of the loop. There are a few 
points that might need some clarification. What happens if the condition is false in the first 
place, before the body of the loop is executed even once? In that case, the body of the loop is 
never executed at all. The body of a while loop can be executed any number of times, including 
zero. What happens if the condition is true, but it becomes false somewhere in the middle of 
the loop body? Does the loop end as soon as this happens? It doesn't, because the computer 
continues executing the body of the loop until it gets to the end. Only then does it jump back 
to the beginning of the loop and test the condition, and only then can the loop end. 

Let's look at a typical problem that can be solved using a while loop: finding the average 
of a set of positive integers entered by the user. The average is the sum of the integers, divided 
by the number of integers. The program will ask the user to enter one integer at a time. It 
will keep count of the number of integers entered, and it will keep a running total of all the 
numbers it has read so far. Here is a pseudocode algorithm for the program: 

Let sum =0 // The sum of the integers entered by the user. 
Let count =0 // The number of integers entered by the user, 
while there are more integers to process: 

Read an integer 

Add it to the sum 

Count it 

Divide sum by count to get the average 
Print out the average 

But how can we test whether there are more integers to process? A typical solution is to 
tell the user to type in zero after all the data have been entered. This will work because we 
are assuming that all the data are positive numbers, so zero is not a legal data value. The zero 
is not itself part of the data to be averaged. It's just there to mark the end of the real data. 
A data value used in this way is sometimes called a sentinel value. So now the test in the 
while loop becomes "while the input integer is not zero". But there is another problem! The 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



77 



first time the test is evaluated, before the body of the loop has ever been executed, no integer 
has yet been read. There is no "input integer" yet, so testing whether the input integer is zero 
doesn't make sense. So, we have to do something before the while loop to make sure that the 
test makes sense. Setting things up so that the test in a while loop makes sense the first time 
it is executed is called priming the loop. In this case, we can simply read the first integer 
before the beginning of the loop. Here is a revised algorithm: 

Let sum = 

Let count = 

Read an integer 

while the integer is not zero: 

Add the integer to the sum 

Count it 

Read an integer 
Divide sum by count to get the average 
Print out the average 

Notice that I've rearranged the body of the loop. Since an integer is read before the loop, the 
loop has to begin by processing that integer. At the end of the loop, the computer reads a new 
integer. The computer then jumps back to the beginning of the loop and tests the integer that 
it has just read. Note that when the computer finally reads the sentinel value, the loop ends 
before the sentinel value is processed. It is not added to the sum, and it is not counted. This 
is the way it's supposed to work. The sentinel is not part of the data. The original algorithm, 
even if it could have been made to work without priming, was incorrect since it would have 
summed and counted all the integers, including the sentinel. (Since the sentinel is zero, the sum 
would still be correct, but the count would be off by one. Such so-called off-by-one errors 
are very common. Counting turns out to be harder than it looks!) 

We can easily turn the algorithm into a complete program. Note that the program cannot 
use the statement "average = sum/count;" to compute the average. Since sum and count 
are both variables of type int, the value of sum/ count is an integer. The average should be 
a real number. We've seen this problem before: we have to convert one of the int values to 
a double to force the computer to compute the quotient as a real number. This can be done 
by type-casting one of the variables to type double. The type cast "(double)sum" converts 
the value of sum to a real number, so in the program the average is computed as "average = 
( (double) sum) / count;". Another solution in this case would have been to declare sum to 
be a variable of type double in the first place. 

One other issue is addressed by the program: If the user enters zero as the first input value, 
there are no data to process. We can test for this case by checking whether count is still equal 
to zero after the while loop. This might seem like a minor point, but a careful programmer 
should cover all the bases. 

Here is the program: 

/** 

* This program reads a sequence of positive integers input 

* by the user, and it will print out the average of those 

* integers. The user is prompted to enter one integer at a 

* time. The user must enter a to mark the end of the 

* data. (The zero is not counted as part of the data to 

* be averaged.) The program does not check whether the 

* user's input is positive, so it will actually add up 

* both positive and negative input values.

public class ComputeAverage { 

public static void main (String [] args) {

TextlO. putf ("Their average is 7 1.3f.\n", average); 

} 

} // end mainO 
} // end class ComputeAverage 



3.3.2 The do..while Statement 

Sometimes it is more convenient to test the continuation condition at the end of a loop, instead 
of at the beginning, as is done in the while loop. The do. .while statement is very similar 
to the while statement, except that the word "while," along with the condition that it tests, 
has been moved to the end. The word "do" is added to mark the beginning of the loop. A 
do . . while statement has the form 

do 

(statement ) 
while ( (boolean-expression) ); 

or, since, as usual, the (statement) can be a block, 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



79 



do { 

(statements } 
} while ( (boolean-expression) ); 

Note the semicolon, ';', at the very end. This semicolon is part of the statement, just as 
the semicolon at the end of an assignment statement or declaration is part of the statement. 
Omitting it is a syntax error. (More generally, every statement in Java ends either with a 
semicolon or a right brace, '}'.) 

To execute a do loop, the computer first executes the body of the loop — that is, the statement 
or statements inside the loop — and then it evaluates the boolean expression. If the value of 
the expression is true, the computer returns to the beginning of the do loop and repeats the 
process; if the value is false, it ends the loop and continues with the next part of the program. 
Since the condition is not tested until the end of the loop, the body of a do loop is always 
executed at least once. 

For example, consider the following pseudocode for a game-playing program. The do loop 
makes sense here instead of a while loop because with the do loop, you know there will be at 
least one game. Also, the test that is used at the end of the loop wouldn't even make sense at 
the beginning: 

do { 

Play a Game 

Ask user if he wants to play another game 
Read the user's response 
} while ( the user's response is yes ); 

Let's convert this into proper Java code. Since I don't want to talk about game playing at the 
moment, let's say that we have a class named Checkers, and that the Checkers class contains 
a static member subroutine named playGameQ that plays one game of checkers against the 
user. Then, the pseudocode "Play a game" can be expressed as the subroutine call statement 
"Checkers .playGameO ;". We need a variable to store the user's response. The TextIO class 
makes it convenient to use a boolean variable to store the answer to a yes/no question. The 
input function TextIO. getlnBooleanO allows the user to enter the value as "yes" or "no". 
"Yes" is considered to be true, and "no" is considered to be false. So, the algorithm can be 
coded as 

boolean wantsToContinue ; // True if user wants to play again, 
do { 

Checkers. playGameO ; 

TextIO .put ("Do you want to play again? "); 
wantsToContinue = TextIO . getlnBooleanO ; 
} while (wantsToContinue == true) ; 

When the value of the boolean variable is set to false, it is a signal that the loop should end. 
When a boolean variable is used in this way — as a signal that is set in one part of the program 
and tested in another part — it is sometimes called a flag or flag variable (in the sense of a 
signal flag). 

By the way, a more-than-usually-pedantic programmer would sneer at the test 
"while (wantsToContinue == true)". This test is exactly equivalent to "while 
(wantsToContinue)". Testing whether "wantsToContinue == true" is true amounts to the 
same thing as testing whether "wantsToContinue" is true. A little less offensive is an expression 
of the form "flag == f alse" , where flag is a boolean variable. The value of "flag == false" 
is exactly the same as the value of "!flag", where ! is the boolean negation operator. So 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



80 



you can write "while (!flag)" instead of "while (flag == false)", and you can write 
"if (!f lag)" instead of "if (flag == false)". 

Although a do. .while statement is sometimes more convenient than a while statement, 
having two kinds of loops does not make the language more powerful. Any problem that can be 
solved using do. .while loops can also be solved using only while statements, and vice versa. 
In fact, if {do Something) represents any block of program code, then 

do { 

(doSomething ) 
} while ( (boolean-expression) ); 

has exactly the same effect as 
(doSomething ) 

while ( (boolean-expression) ) { 
(doSomething ) 

y 



Similarly, 



while ( (boolean-expression) ) { 
(doSomething ) 

y 

can be replaced by 

if ( (boolean-expression) ) { 
do { 

(doSomething) 
y while ( (boolean-expression) ); 

} 

without changing the meaning of the program in any way. 



3.3.3 break and continue 

The syntax of the while and do. .while loops allows you to test the continuation condition at 
either the beginning of a loop or at the end. Sometimes, it is more natural to have the test 
in the middle of the loop, or to have several tests at different places in the same loop. Java 
provides a general method for breaking out of the middle of any loop. It's called the break 
statement, which takes the form 

break; 

When the computer executes a break statement in a loop, it will immediately jump out 
of the loop. It then continues on to whatever follows the loop in the program. Consider for 
example: 

while (true) { // looks like it will run forever! 
TextlD. put ("Enter a positive number: "); 
N = TextlO.getlnlntO ; 

if (N > 0) // input is OK; jump out of loop 
break; 

Text ID .put In ("Your answer must be > 0."); 

} 

// continue here after break 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



81 



If the number entered by the user is greater than zero, the break statement will be executed 
and the computer will jump out of the loop. Otherwise, the computer will print out "Your 
answer must be > 0." and will jump back to the start of the loop to read another input value. 

The first line of this loop, "while (true)" might look a bit strange, but it's perfectly 
legitimate. The condition in a while loop can be any boolean- valued expression. The computer 
evaluates this expression and checks whether the value is true or false. The boolean literal 
"true" is just a boolean expression that always evaluates to true. So "while (true)" can be 
used to write an infinite loop, or one that will be terminated by a break statement. 

A break statement terminates the loop that immediately encloses the break statement. It 
is possible to have nested loops, where one loop statement is contained inside another. If you 
use a break statement inside a nested loop, it will only break out of that loop, not out of 
the loop that contains the nested loop. There is something called a labeled break statement 
that allows you to specify which loop you want to break. This is not very common, so I will 
go over it quickly. Labels work like this: You can put a label in front of any loop. A label 
consists of a simple identifier followed by a colon. For example, a while with a label might 
look like "mainloop: while. . .". Inside this loop you can use the labeled break statement 
"break mainloop;" to break out of the labeled loop. For example, here is a code segment that 
checks whether two strings, si and s2, have a character in common. If a common character is 
found, the value of the flag variable nothinglnCommon is set to false, and a labeled break is 
used to end the processing at that point: 

boolean nothinglnCommon; 

nothinglnCommon = true; // Assume si and s2 have no chars in common, 
int i,j; // Variables for iterating through the chars in si and s2. 

i = 0; 

bigloop: while (i < si. length ()) { 
j = 0; 

while (j < s2.1ength()) { 

if (si . charAt (i) == s2 . charAt ( j ) ) { // si and s2 have a common char. 
nothinglnCommon = false; 

break bigloop; // break out of BOTH loops 

> 

j++; // Go on to the next char in s2. 

> 

i++; //Go on to the next char in si. 

} 

The continue statement is related to break, but less commonly used. A continue state- 
ment tells the computer to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop. However, instead 
of jumping out of the loop altogether, it jumps back to the beginning of the loop and continues 
with the next iteration (including evaluating the loop's continuation condition to see whether 
any further iterations are required). As with break, when a continue is in a nested loop, it 
will continue the loop that directly contains it; a "labeled continue" can be used to continue 
the containing loop instead. 

break and continue can be used in while loops and do. .while loops. They can also be 
used in for loops, which are covered in the next section. In Section 3.6, we'll see that break can 
also be used to break out of a switch statement. A break can occur inside an if statement, 
but in that case, it does not mean to break out of the if. Instead, it breaks out of the loop or 
switch statement that contains the if statement. If the if statement is not contained inside a 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



<S2 



loop or switch, then the if statement cannot legally contain a break. A similar consideration 
applies to continue statements inside if s. 

3.4 The for Statement 

We turn in this section to another type of loop, the for statement. Any for loop is (online) 
equivalent to some while loop, so the language doesn't get any additional power by having for 
statements. But for a certain type of problem, a for loop can be easier to construct and easier 
to read than the corresponding while loop. It's quite possible that in real programs, for loops 
actually outnumber while loops. 

3.4.1 For Loops 

The for statement makes a common type of while loop easier to write. Many while loops have 
the general form: 

(initialization) 

while ( (continuation-condition) ) { 
(statements ) 
(update) 

} 

For example, consider this example, copied from an example in Section 3.2: 

years =0; // initialize the variable years 

while ( years < 5 ) { // condition for continuing loop 

interest = principal * rate; // 

principal += interest; // do three statements 

System. out .println (principal) ; // 

years++; // update the value of the variable, years 

} 

This loop can be written as the following equivalent for statement: 

for ( years = 0; years < 5; years++ ) { 
interest = principal * rate; 
principal += interest; 
System. out .println (principal) ; 

} 

The initialization, continuation condition, and updating have all been combined in the first line 
of the for loop. This keeps everything involved in the "control" of the loop in one place, which 
helps make the loop easier to read and understand. The for loop is executed in exactly the 
same way as the original code: The initialization part is executed once, before the loop begins. 
The continuation condition is executed before each execution of the loop, and the loop ends 
when this condition is false. The update part is executed at the end of each execution of the 
loop, just before jumping back to check the condition. 
The formal syntax of the for statement is as follows: 

for ( (initialization); (continuation-condition); (update) ) 
(statement ) 

or, using a block statement: 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



83 



for ( (initialization); (continuation-condition); (update) ) { 
(statements ) 

} 

The (continuation- condition) must be a boolean-valued expression. The (initialization) is usu- 
ally a declaration or an assignment statement, but it can be any expression that would be 
allowed as a statement in a program. The (update) can be any expression statement, but is 
usually an increment, a decrement, or an assignment statement. Any of the three can be empty. 
If the continuation condition is empty, it is treated as if it were "true," so the loop will be 
repeated forever or until it ends for some other reason, such as a break statement. (Some 
people like to begin an infinite loop with "for (; ;)" instead of "while (true)".) 

Usually, the initialization part of a for statement assigns a value to some variable, and the 
update changes the value of that variable with an assignment statement or with an increment 
or decrement operation. The value of the variable is tested in the continuation condition, and 
the loop ends when this condition evaluates to false. A variable used in this way is called a 
loop control variable. In the for statement given above, the loop control variable is years. 

Certainly, the most common type of for loop is the counting loop, where a loop control 
variable takes on all integer values between some minimum and some maximum value. A 
counting loop has the form 

for ( (variable) = (min) ; (variable) <= (max); (variable)++ ) { 
(statements ) 

y 

where (min) and (max) are integer-valued expressions (usually constants). The (variable) takes 
on the values (min), (mm) + l, (min) +2, . . . , (max). The value of the loop control variable is 
often used in the body of the loop. The for loop at the beginning of this section is a counting 
loop in which the loop control variable, years, takes on the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Here is an even 
simpler example, in which the numbers 1, 2, . . . , 10 are displayed on standard output: 

for ( N = 1 ; N <= 10 ; N++ ) 
System. out . println( N ); 

For various reasons, Java programmers like to start counting at instead of 1, and they 
tend to use a "<" in the condition, rather than a "<=". The following variation of the above 
loop prints out the ten numbers 0, 1, 2, . . . , 9: 

for ( N = ; N < 10 ; N++ ) 
System. out .println( N ); 

Using < instead of <= in the test, or vice versa, is a common source of off- by-one errors in 
programs. You should always stop and think, Do I want the final value to be processed or not? 

It's easy to count down from 10 to 1 instead of counting up. Just start with 10, decrement 
the loop control variable instead of incrementing it, and continue as long as the variable is 
greater than or equal to one. 

for ( N = 10 ; N >= 1 ; N — ) 
System. out . println( N ); 

Now, in fact, the official syntax of a for statement actually allows both the initialization 
part and the update part to consist of several expressions, separated by commas. So we can 
even count up from 1 to 10 and count down from 10 to 1 at the same time! 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



84 



for ( i=l, j=10; i <= 10; i++, j— ) { 

System. out .printf ("%5d" , i) ; // Output i in a 5-character wide column. 
System. out .printf ("%5d" , j); // Output j in a 5-character column 
System. out .printlnO ; // and end the line. 

} 

As a final introductory example, let's say that we want to use a for loop that prints out 
just the even numbers between 2 and 20, that is: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20. There are 
several ways to do this. Just to show how even a very simple problem can be solved in many 
ways, here are four different solutions (three of which would get full credit): 

(1) // There are 10 numbers to print. 
// Use a for loop to count 1, 2, 
// . . . , 10. The numbers we want 

// to print are 2*1, 2*2, ... 2*10. 

for (N = 1; N <= 10; N++) { 
System. out .println( 2*N ); 

} 

(2) // Use a for loop that counts 
II 2, 4, 20 directly by 

// adding 2 to N each time through 
// the loop. 

for (N = 2; N <= 20; N = N + 2) { 
System. out .println( N ); 

} 

(3) // Count off all the numbers 
// 2, 3, 4, . . . , 19, 20, but 
// only print out the numbers 
// that are even. 

for (N = 2; N <= 20; N++) { 

if (I'/,2 = 0) // is N even? 
System. out .println( N ); 

} 

(4) // Irritate the professor with 
// a solution that follows the 

// letter of this silly assignment 
// while making fun of it . 

for (N = 1; N <= 1; N++) { 

System. out. println("2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20"); 

} 

Perhaps it is worth stressing one more time that a for statement, like any statement, never 
occurs on its own in a real program. A statement must be inside the main routine of a program 
or inside some other subroutine. And that subroutine must be defined inside a class. I should 
also remind you that every variable must be declared before it can be used, and that includes 
the loop control variable in a for statement. In all the examples that you have seen so far in 
this section, the loop control variables should be declared to be of type int. It is not required 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



85 



that a loop control variable be an integer. Here, for example, is a for loop in which the variable, 
ch, is of type char, using the fact that the ++ operator can be applied to characters as well as 
to numbers: 

/ / Print out the alphabet on one line of output . 
char ch; // The loop control variable; 

// one of the letters to be printed, 

for ( ch = 'A'; ch <= >Z' ; ch++ ) 

System. out .print (ch) ; 
System, out .printlnO ; 

3.4.2 Example: Counting Divisors 

Let's look at a less trivial problem that can be solved with a for loop. If N and D are positive 
integers, we say that D is a divisor of N if the remainder when D is divided into N is zero. 
(Equivalently, we could say that N is an even multiple of D.) In terms of Java programming, D 
is a divisor of N if N % D is zero. 

Let's write a program that inputs a positive integer, N, from the user and computes how 
many different divisors N has. The numbers that could possibly be divisors of N are 1, 2, . . . , N. 
To compute the number of divisors of N, we can just test each possible divisor of N and count 
the ones that actually do divide N evenly. In pseudocode, the algorithm takes the form 

Get a positive integer, N, from the user 
Let divisorCount = 

for each number, testDivisor, in the range from 1 to N: 
if testDivisor is a divisor of N: 

Count it by adding 1 to divisorCount 
Output the count 

This algorithm displays a common programming pattern that is used when some, but not all, 
of a sequence of items are to be processed. The general pattern is 

for each item in the sequence: 
if the item passes the test: 
process it 

The for loop in our divisor-counting algorithm can be translated into Java code as 

for (testDivisor = 1; testDivisor <= N; testDivisor++) { 
if ( N °/o testDivisor == ) 
divisorCount++ ; 

} 

On a modern computer, this loop can be executed very quickly. It is not impossible to run 
it even for the largest legal int value, 2147483647. (If you wanted to run it for even larger 
values, you could use variables of type long rather than int.) However, it does take a significant 
amount of time for very large numbers. So when I implemented this algorithm, I decided to 
output a dot every time the computer has tested one million possible divisors. In the improved 
version of the program, there are two types of counting going on. We have to count the number 
of divisors and we also have to count the number of possible divisors that have been tested. 
So the program needs two counters. When the second counter reaches 1000000, the program 
outputs a ' . ' and resets the counter to zero so that we can start counting the next group of one 
million. Reverting to pseudocode, the algorithm now looks like 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



Get a positive integer, N, from the user 

Let divisorCount =0 // Number of divisors found. 

Let numberTested =0 // Number of possible divisors tested 

// since the last period was output, 

for each number, testDivisor, in the range from 1 to N: 
if testDivisor is a divisor of N: 

Count it by adding 1 to divisorCount 
Add 1 to numberTested 
if numberTested is 1000000: 
print out a ' . ' 
Reset numberTested to 
Output the count 

Finally, we can translate the algorithm into a complete Java program: 
/** 

* This program reads a positive integer from the user. 

* It counts how many divisors that number has, and 

* then it prints the result . 
*/ 

public class CountDivisors { 

public static void main(String[] args) { 

int N; II A positive integer entered by the user. 

// Divisors of this number will be counted. 

int testDivisor; // A number between 1 and N that is a 
// possible divisor of N. 

int divisorCount; // Number of divisors of N that have been found. 

int numberTested; // Used to count how many possible divisors 
// of N have been tested. When the number 
// reaches 1000000, a period is output and 
// the value of numberTested is reset to zero. 

/* Get a positive integer from the user. */ 

while (true) { 

System. out .print ("Enter a positive integer: "); 
N = TextlO.getlnlntO ; 
if (N > 0) 
break; 

System. out .println( "That number is not positive. Please try again. 

} 

/* Count the divisors, printing a "." after every 1000000 tests. */ 

divisorCount = 0; 
numberTested = 0; 

for (testDivisor = 1; testDivisor <= N; testDivisor++) { 
if ( N % testDivisor == ) 

divisorCount++ ; 
numberTested++ ; 

if (numberTested == 1000000) { 
System . out . print ('.'); 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



87 



numberTested = 0; 

} 

} 

/* Display the result. */ 
System, out .printlnO ; 

System. out .print In ("The number of divisors of " + N 
+ " is " + divisorCount) ; 

} // end mainO 
} // end class CountDivisors 



3.4.3 Nested for Loops 

Control structures in Java are statements that contain statements. In particular, control struc- 
tures can contain control structures. You've already seen several examples of if statements 
inside loops, and one example of a while loop inside another while, but any combination of one 
control structure inside another is possible. We say that one structure is nested inside another. 
You can even have multiple levels of nesting, such as a while loop inside an if statement inside 
another while loop. The syntax of Java does not set a limit on the number of levels of nesting. 
As a practical matter, though, it's difficult to understand a program that has more than a few 
levels of nesting. 

Nested for loops arise naturally in many algorithms, and it is important to understand how 
they work. Let's look at a couple of examples. First, consider the problem of printing out a 
multiplication table like this one:

The data in the table are arranged into 12 rows and 12 columns. The process of printing them 
out can be expressed in a pseudocode algorithm as 

for each rowNumber = 1, 2, 3, 12: 

Print the first twelve multiples of rowNumber on one line 
Output a carriage return 

The first step in the for loop can itself be expressed as a for loop. We can expand "Print the 
first twelve multiples of rowNumber on one line" as: 

for N = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 12: 
Print N * rowNumber 

so a refined algorithm for printing the table has one for loop nested inside another: 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



88 



for each rowNumber = 1, 2, 3, 12: 
for N = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 12: 

Print N * rowNumber 
Output a carriage return 

We want to print the output in neat columns, with each output number taking up four spaces. 
This can be done using formatted output with format specifier °/ 4d. Assuming that rowNumber 
and N have been declared to be variables of type int, the algorithm can be expressed in Java as 

for ( rowNumber = 1; rowNumber <= 12; rowNumber++ ) { 
for ( N = 1; N <= 12; N++ ) { 

// print in 4-character columns 
System, out .printf ( "°/ 4d", N * rowNumber ); //No carriage return ! 

} 

System. out .printlnO ; // Add a carriage return at end of the line. 

} 

This section has been weighed down with lots of examples of numerical processing. For our 
next example, let's do some text processing. Consider the problem of finding which of the 26 
letters of the alphabet occur in a given string. For example, the letters that occur in "Hello 
World" are D, E, H, L, O, R, and W. More specifically, we will write a program that will list all 
the letters contained in a string and will also count the number of different letters. The string 
will be input by the user. Let's start with a pseudocode algorithm for the program. 

Ask the user to input a string 

Read the response into a variable, str 

Let count = (for counting the number of different letters) 
for each letter of the alphabet: 
if the letter occurs in str: 

Print the letter 

Add 1 to count 
Output the count 

Since we want to process the entire line of text that is entered by the user, we'll use 
Text ID .getln() to read it. The line of the algorithm that reads "for each letter of the al- 
phabet" can be expressed as "for (letter =, A'; letter<='Z ) ; letter++)". But the body 
of this for loop needs more thought. How do we check whether the given letter, letter, occurs 
in str? One idea is to look at each character in the string in turn, and check whether that 
character is equal to letter. We can get the i-th character of str with the function call 
str . char At (i) , where i ranges from to str. length () - 1. 

One more difficulty: A letter such as 'A' can occur in str in either upper or lower case, 'A' 
or 'a'. We have to check for both of these. But we can avoid this difficulty by converting str 
to upper case before processing it. Then, we only have to check for the upper case letter. We 
can now flesh out the algorithm fully: 

Ask the user to input a string 

Read the response into a variable, str 

Convert str to upper case 

Let count = 

for letter = 'A' , >B' , . . . , 'Z' : 

for i = 0, 1, str.lengthO-1: 
if letter == str . charAt (i) : 
Print letter 
Add 1 to count 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



89 



break // jump out of the loop, to avoid counting letter twice 
Output the count 

Note the use of break in the nested for loop. It is required to avoid printing or counting a given 
letter more than once (in the case where it occurs more than once in the string). The break 
statement breaks out of the inner for loop, but not the outer for loop. Upon executing the 
break, the computer continues the outer loop with the next value of letter. You should try 
to figure out exactly what count would be at the end of this program, if the break statement 
were omitted. 

Here is the complete program: 

/** 

* This program reads a line of text entered by the user. 

* It prints a list of the letters that occur in the text, 

* and it reports how many different letters were found. 
*/ 

public class ListLetters { 

public static void main(String[] args) { 

String str; // Line of text entered by the user. 

int count; // Number of different letters found in str. 

char letter; // A letter of the alphabet. 

TextIO .putln( "Please type in a line of text."); 
str = TextIO .getlnO ; 

str = str . toUpperCase () ; 

count = ; 

TextIO. putln( "Your input contains the following letters:"); 
TextIO. put In ; 
TextIO. put (" "); 

for ( letter = 'A'; letter <= 'Z' ; letter++ ) {

In fact, there is actually an easier way to determine whether a given letter occurs in a string, 
str. The built-in function str. indexOf (letter) will return -1 if letter does not occur in 
the string. It returns a number greater than or equal to zero if it does occur. So, we could 
check whether letter occurs in str simply by checking "if (str . indexOf (letter) >= 0)". 
If we used this technique in the above program, we wouldn't need a nested for loop. This gives 
you a preview of how subroutines can be used to deal with complexity. 

3.4.4 Enums and for-each Loops 

Java 5.0 introduced a new "enhanced" form of the for loop that is designed to be convenient 
for processing data structures. A data structure is a collection of data items, considered as 
a unit. For example, a list is a data structure that consists simply of a sequence of items. 
The enhanced for loop makes it easy to apply the same processing to every element of a list 
or other data structure. Data structures are a major topic in computer science, but we won't 
encounter them in any serious way until Chapter 7. However, one of the applications of the 
enhanced for loop is to enum types, and so we consider it briefly here. (Enums were introduced 
in Subsection 2.3.3.) 

The enhanced for loop can be used to perform the same processing on each of the enum 
constants that are the possible values of an enumerated type. The syntax for doing this is: 

for ( {enum- type-name) {variable-name) : {enum- type-name) .values () ) 
{statement ) 

or 

for ( {enum- type-name) {variable-name) : {enum- type-name) .values () ) { 
{statements ) 

} 

If MyEnum is the name of any enumerated type, then My Enum. values () is a function call that 
returns a list containing all of the values of the enum. (values () is a static member function 
in MyEnum and of any other enum.) For this enumerated type, the for loop would have the 
form: 

for ( MyEnum {variable-name) : MyEnum. values () ) 
{statement ) 

The intent of this is to execute the {statement) once for each of the possible values of the 
MyEnum type. The {variable-name) is the loop control variable. In the {statement), it repre- 
sents the enumerated type value that is currently being processed. This variable should not be 
declared before the for loop; it is essentially being declared in the loop itself. 

To give a concrete example, suppose that the following enumerated type has been defined 
to represent the days of the week: 

enum Day { MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY } 
Then we could write: 

for ( Day d : Day. values () ) { 
System. out .print ( d ); 
System. out .print (" is day number "); 
System. out .println( d. ordinal () ); 

} 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



91 



Day. values () represents the list containing the seven constants that make up the enumerated 
type. The first time through this loop, the value of d would be the first enumerated type value 
Day . MONDAY, which has ordinal number 0, so the output would be "MONDAY is day number 0" . 
The second time through the loop, the value of d would be Day. TUESDAY, and so on through 
Day. SUNDAY. The body of the loop is executed once for each item in the list Day. values (), 
with d taking on each of those values in turn. The full output from this loop would be: 

MONDAY is day number 
TUESDAY is day number 1 
WEDNESDAY is day number 2 
THURSDAY is day number 3 
FRIDAY is day number 4 
SATURDAY is day number 5 
SUNDAY is day number 6 

Since the intent of the enhanced for loop is to do something "for each" item in a data 
structure, it is often called a for-each loop. The syntax for this type of loop is unfortunate. It 
would be better if it were written something like "foreach Day d in Day. values ()", which 
conveys the meaning much better and is similar to the syntax used in other programming 
languages for similar types of loops. It's helpful to think of the colon (:) in the loop as meaning 
"in." 

3.5 The if Statement 

The first of the two branching statements in Java is the if statement, which you (online) 
have already seen in Section 3.1. It takes the form 

if ((boolean-expression)) 
(statement-1 ) 

else 

(statement -2) 

As usual, the statements inside an if statement can be blocks. The if statement represents 
a two-way branch. The else part of an if statement — consisting of the word "else" and the 
statement that follows it — can be omitted. 

3.5.1 The Dangling else Problem 

Now, an if statement is, in particular, a statement. This means that either (statement-1) 
or (statement-2) in the above if statement can itself be an if statement. A problem arises, 
however, if (statement-1) is an if statement that has no else part. This special case is 
effectively forbidden by the syntax of Java. Suppose, for example, that you type 

if ( x > ) 
if (y > 0) 

System. out .printlnC'First case") ; 

else 

System. out . println(" Second case" ) ; 

Now, remember that the way you've indented this doesn't mean anything at all to the computer. 
You might think that the else part is the second half of your "if (x > 0)" statement, but 
the rule that the computer follows attaches the else to "if (y > 0)", which is closer. That 
is, the computer reads your statement as if it were formatted: 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



92 



if ( x > ) 
if (y > 0) 

System. out .printlnO'First case") ; 
else 

System. out .printlnC'Second case") ; 

You can force the computer to use the other interpretation by enclosing the nested if in a 
block: 

if ( x > ) { 
if (y > 0) 

System. out .printlnO'First case") ; 

} 

else 

System. out .printlnC'Second case" ) ; 

These two if statements have different meanings: In the case when x <= 0, the first statement 
doesn't print anything, but the second statement prints "Second case" . 



3.5.2 The if.. .else if Construction 

Much more interesting than this technicality is the case where {statement- 2) , the else part 
of the if statement, is itself an if statement. The statement would look like this (perhaps 
without the final else part): 

if ((boolean-expression-1)) 
(statement-1 ) 

else 

if ((boolean-expression-2)) 
(statement-2) 

else 

(statement-3) 

However, since the computer doesn't care how a program is laid out on the page, this is almost 
always written in the format: 

if ((boolean-expression-l)) 

(statement-1 ) 
else if ((boolean-expression-2)) 

(statement-2) 

else 

(statement-3) 

You should think of this as a single statement representing a three-way branch. When the 
computer executes this, one and only one of the three statements — (statement-1) , (statement- 
2), or (statement-3) — will be executed. The computer starts by evaluating (boolean- expression- 
1). If it is true, the computer executes (statement-1 ) and then jumps all the way to the end of 
the outer if statement, skipping the other two (statements. If (boolean-expression-1) is false, 
the computer skips (statement-1) and executes the second, nested if statement. To do this, 
it tests the value of (boolean-expression-2) and uses it to decide between (statement-2) and 
(statement-3) . 

Here is an example that will print out one of three different messages, depending on the 
value of a variable named temperature: 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



93 



if (temperature < 50) 

System. out .printlnC'It ' s cold. ") ; 
else if (temperature < 80) 

System. out .printlnC'It ' s nice . ") ; 
else 

System. out .printlnC'It ' s hot . ") ; 

If temperature is, say, 42, the first test is true. The computer prints out the message "It's 
cold" , and skips the rest — without even evaluating the second condition. For a temperature of 
75, the first test is false, so the computer goes on to the second test. This test is true, so 
the computer prints "It's nice" and skips the rest. If the temperature is 173, both of the tests 
evaluate to false, so the computer says "It's hot" (unless its circuits have been fried by the 
heat, that is). 

You can go on stringing together "else-if's" to make multi-way branches with any number 
of cases: 

if ((boolean-expression-1)) 

(statement-1 } 
else if ((boolean-expression-2)) 

(statement-2) 
else if ((boolean-expression-3)) 

(statement -3) 

. II (more cases) 

else if ((boolean-expression-N)) 
(statement-N) 

else 

(statement- (N+l) ) 

The computer evaluates boolean expressions one after the other until it comes to one that is 
true. It executes the associated statement and skips the rest. If none of the boolean expressions 
evaluate to true, then the statement in the else part is executed. This statement is called 
a multi-way branch because only one of the statements will be executed. The final else part 
can be omitted. In that case, if all the boolean expressions are false, none of the statements 
are executed. Of course, each of the statements can be a block, consisting of a number of 
statements enclosed between { and }. (Admittedly, there is lot of syntax here; as you study 
and practice, you'll become comfortable with it.) 

3.5.3 If Statement Examples 

As an example of using if statements, lets suppose that x, y, and z are variables of type int, 
and that each variable has already been assigned a value. Consider the problem of printing out 
the values of the three variables in increasing order. For examples, if the values are 42, 17, and 
20, then the output should be in the order 17, 20, 42. 

One way to approach this is to ask, where does x belong in the list? It comes first if it's 
less than both y and z. It comes last if it's greater than both y and z. Otherwise, it comes in 
the middle. We can express this with a 3-way if statement, but we still have to worry about 
the order in which y and z should be printed. In pseudocode, 

if (x < y && x < z) { 

output x, followed by y and z in their correct order 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



94 



} 

else if (x > y && x > z) { 

output y and z in their correct order, followed by x 

} 

else { 

output x in between y and z in their correct order 

} 

Determining the relative order of y and z requires another if statement, so this becomes 

if (x < y && x < z) { // x comes first 

if (y < z) 

System. out. println( x + " " + y + " " + z ); 
else 

System. out. println( x + " " + z + " " + y ); 

} 

else if (x > y && x > z) { // x comes last 
if (y < z) 

System. out. println( y + " " + z + " " + x ); 
else 

System. out. println( z + " " + y + " " + x ); 

} 

else { // x in the middle 

if (y < z) 

System. out. println( y + " " + x + " " + z) ; 
else 

System. out. println( z + " " + x + " " + y) ; 

} 

You might check that this code will work correctly even if some of the values are the same. If 
the values of two variables are the same, it doesn't matter which order you print them in. 

Note, by the way, that even though you can say in English "if x is less than y and z," you 
can't say in Java "if (x < y && z)". The && operator can only be used between boolean 
values, so you have to make separate tests, x<y and x<z, and then combine the two tests with 
&&. 

There is an alternative approach to this problem that begins by asking, "which order should 
x and y be printed in?" Once that's known, you only have to decide where to stick in z. This 
line of thought leads to different Java code: 

if ( x < y ) { //x comes before y 
if ( z < x ) //z comes first 

System. out. println( z + " " + x + " " + y) ; 
else if ( z > y ) //z comes last 

System. out. println( x + " " + y + " " + z) ; 
else // z is in the middle 

System. out. println( x + " " + z + " " + y) ; 

} 

else { // y comes before x 

if ( z < y ) //z comes first 

System. out. println( z + " " + y + " " + x) ; 
else if ( z > x ) //z comes last 

System. out. println( y + " " + x + " " + z) ; 
else // z is in the middle 

System. out. println( y + " " + z + " " + x) ; 

} 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



95 



Once again, we see how the same problem can be solved in many different ways. The two 
approaches to this problem have not exhausted all the possibilities. For example, you might 
start by testing whether x is greater than y. If so, you could swap their values. Once you've 
done that, you know that x should be printed before y. 

* * * 

Finally, let's write a complete program that uses an if statement in an interesting way. I 
want a program that will convert measurements of length from one unit of measurement to 
another, such as miles to yards or inches to feet. So far, the problem is extremely under- 
specified. Let's say that the program will only deal with measurements in inches, feet, yards, 
and miles. It would be easy to extend it later to deal with other units. The user will type in 
a measurement in one of these units, such as "17 feet" or "2.73 miles". The output will show 
the length in terms of each of the four units of measure. (This is easier than asking the user 
which units to use in the output.) An outline of the process is 

Read the user's input measurement and units of measure 
Express the measurement in inches, feet, yards, and miles 
Display the four results 

The program can read both parts of the user's input from the same line by using 
TextIO .getDoubleO to read the numerical measurement and TextID .getlnWordO to read 
the unit of measure. The conversion into different units of measure can be simplified by first 
converting the user's input into inches. From there, the number of inches can easily be con- 
verted into feet, yards, and miles. Before converting into inches, we have to test the input to 
determine which unit of measure the user has specified: 

Let measurement = TextIO. getDoubleO 
Let units = TextIO . getlnWordO 
if the units are inches 

Let inches = measurement 
else if the units are feet 

Let inches = measurement * 12 // 12 inches per foot 

else if the units are yards 

Let inches = measurement * 36 // 36 inches per yard 

else if the units are miles 

Let inches = measurement * 12 * 5280 // 5280 feet per mile 
else 

The units are illegal! 

Print an error message and stop processing 
Let feet = inches / 12.0 
Let yards = inches / 36 . 
Let miles = inches / (12.0 * 5280.0) 
Display the results 

Since units is a String, we can use units, equals ("inches") to check whether the spec- 
ified unit of measure is "inches". However, it would be nice to allow the units to be spec- 
ified as "inch" or abbreviated to "in". To allow these three possibilities, we can check if 
(units. equals ("inches") || units . equals ("inch") || units. equals ("in")). It would 
also be nice to allow upper case letters, as in "Inches" or "IN". We can do this by converting 
units to lower case before testing it or by substituting the function units . equalsIgnoreCase 
for units . equals. 

In my final program, I decided to make things more interesting by allowing the user to 
repeat the process of entering a measurement and seeing the results of the conversion for each 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



96 



measurement. The program will end only when the user inputs 0. To do this, I just have to 
wrap the above algorithm inside a while loop, and make sure that the loop ends when the user 
inputs a 0. Here's the complete program: 

/** 

* This program will convert measurements expressed in inches, 

* feet, yards, or miles into each of the possible units of 

* measure. The measurement is input by the user, followed by 

* the unit of measure. For example: "17 feet", "1 inch", or 

* "2.73 mi". Abbreviations in, ft, yd, and mi are accepted. 

* The program will continue to read and convert measurements 

* until the user enters an input of 0.

(Note that this program uses formatted output with the "g" format specifier. In this pro- 
gram, we have no control over how large or how small the numbers might be. It could easily 
make sense for the user to enter very large or very small measurements. The "g" format will 
print a real number in exponential form if it is very large or very small, and in the usual decimal 
form otherwise. Remember that in the format specification °/ 12.5g, the 5 is the total number 
of significant digits that are to be printed, so we will always get the same number of significant 
digits in the output, no matter what the size of the number. If we had used an "f format 
specifier such as °/ 12.5f, the output would be in decimal form with 5 digits after the decimal 
point. This would print the number 0.000000000745482 as 0.00000, with no significant digits 
at all! With the "g" format specifier, the output would be 7.4549e-10.) 

3.5.4 The Empty Statement 

As a final note in this section, I will mention one more type of statement in Java: the empty 
statement. This is a statement that consists simply of a semicolon and which tells the computer 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



98 



to do nothing. The existence of the empty statement makes the following legal, even though 
you would not ordinarily see a semicolon after a } : 

if (x < 0) { 
x = -x; 

}; 

The semicolon is legal after the }, but the computer considers it to be an empty statement, 
not part of the if statement. Occasionally, you might find yourself using the empty statement 
when what you mean is, in fact, "do nothing." For example, the rather contrived if statement 

if ( done ) 

; // Empty statement 
else 

System. out .println( "Not done yet."); 

does nothing when the boolean variable done is true, and prints out "Not done yet" when 
it is false. You can't just leave out the semicolon in this example, since Java syntax requires 
an actual statement between the if and the else. I prefer, though, to use an empty block, 
consisting of { and } with nothing between, for such cases. 

Occasionally, stray empty statements can cause annoying, hard-to-find errors in a program. 
For example, the following program segment prints out "Hello" just once, not ten times: 

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) ; 

System. out . println( "Hello" ) ; 

Why? Because the ";" at the end of the first line is a statement, and it is this statement that is 
executed ten times. The System. out .println statement is not really inside the for statement 
at all, so it is executed just once, after the for loop has completed. 

3.6 The switch Statement 

The second branching statement in Java is the switch statement, which is introduced (online) 
in this section. The switch statement is used far less often than the if statement, but it is 
sometimes useful for expressing a certain type of multi-way branch. 

3.6.1 The Basic switch Statement 

A switch statement allows you to test the value of an expression and, depending on that value, 
to jump directly to some location within the switch statement. Only expressions of certain 
types can be used. The value of the expression can be one of the primitive integer types int, 
short, or byte. It can be the primitive char type. Or, as we will see later in this section, it 
can be an enumerated type. In Java 7, Strings are also allowed. In particular, the expression 
cannot be a real number, and prior to Java 7, it cannot be a String. The positions that you 
can jump to are marked with case labels that take the form: "case {constant):" . This marks 
the position the computer jumps to when the expression evaluates to the given (constant). As 
the final case in a switch statement you can, optionally, use the label "default:", which provides 
a default jump point that is used when the value of the expression is not listed in any case 
label. 

A switch statement, as it is most often used, has the form: 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



99 



switch ({expression)) { 
case {constant-1) : 

(statements-1 ) 

break; 
case {constant-2) : 

(statements-2) 

break; 

// (more cases) 

case {constant-N) : 
(statements-N) 
break; 

default: // optional default case 
(statements- (N+l) ) 
y II end of switch statement 

The break statements are technically optional. The effect of a break is to make the computer 
jump to the end of the switch statement. If you leave out the break statement, the computer 
will just forge ahead after completing one case and will execute the statements associated with 
the next case label. This is rarely what you want, but it is legal. (I will note here — although 
you won't understand it until you get to the next chapter — that inside a subroutine, the break 
statement is sometimes replaced by a return statement.) 

Note that you can leave out one of the groups of statements entirely (including the break). 
You then have two case labels in a row, containing two different constants. This just means 
that the computer will jump to the same place and perform the same action for each of the two 
constants. 

Here is an example of a switch statement. This is not a useful example, but it should be 
easy for you to follow. Note, by the way, that the constants in the case labels don't have to be 
in any particular order, as long as they are all different: 

switch ( N ) { // (Assume N is an integer variable.) 
case 1 : 

System. out .printlnC'The number is 1."); 

break; 
case 2: 
case 4: 
case 8: 

System. out .printlnC'The number is 2, 4, or 8."); 

System. out. println(" (That's a power of 2!)"); 

break; 
case 3: 
case 6: 
case 9: 

System. out .printlnC'The number is 3, 6, or 9."); 
System. out. printlnC (That's a multiple of 3!)"); 
break; 
case 5: 

System. out .printlnC'The number is 5."); 
break; 
default : 

System. out .printlnC'The number is 7 or is outside the range 1 to 9."); 

} 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



100 



The switch statement is pretty primitive as control structures go, and it's easy to make mis- 
takes when you use it. Java takes all its control structures directly from the older programming 
languages C and C++. The switch statement is certainly one place where the designers of Java 
should have introduced some improvements. 



3.6.2 Menus and switch Statements 

One application of switch statements is in processing menus. A menu is a list of options. 
The user selects one of the options. The computer has to respond to each possible choice in a 
different way. If the options are numbered 1, 2, . . . , then the number of the chosen option can 
be used in a switch statement to select the proper response. 

In a TexiVO-based program, the menu can be presented as a numbered list of options, and 
the user can choose an option by typing in its number. Here is an example that could be used 
in a variation of the LengthConverter example from the previous section: 

int optionNumber ; // Option number from menu, selected by user, 
double measurement; Ilk numerical measurement, input by the user. 

// The unit of measurement depends on which 

// option the user has selected, 
double inches; // The same measurement, converted into inches. 

/* Display menu and get user's selected option number. */ 

TextlO.putlnC'What unit of measurement does your input use?"); 
TextlO.putlnO ; 

TextlO.putlnO' 1. inches"); 

TextlO.putlnO' 2. feet"); 

TextlO.putlnO' 3. yards"); 

TextlO.putlnO' 4. miles"); 

TextlO.putlnO ; 

TextIO .putlnO'Enter the number of your choice: "); 
optionNumber = TextIO . getlnlnt () ; 

/* Read user's measurement and convert to inches. */ 

switch ( optionNumber ) { 
case 1 : 

TextIO .putlnO'Enter the number of inches: "); 
measurement = TextIO . getlnDouble () ; 
inches = measurement; 
break; 
case 2: 

TextIO .putlnO'Enter the number of feet: "); 
measurement = TextIO. getlnDouble () ; 
inches = measurement * 12; 
break; 
case 3: 

TextIO .putlnO'Enter the number of yards: "); 
measurement = TextIO . getlnDouble () ; 
inches = measurement * 36; 
break; 
case 4: 

TextIO .putlnO'Enter the number of miles: "); 
measurement = TextIO. getlnDouble () ; 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



101 



inches = measurement * 12 * 5280; 
break; 
default : 

Text 10 .put In ("Error ! Illegal option number! I quit!"); 
System. exit (1) ; 
} // end switch 

/* Now go on to convert inches to feet, yards, and miles... */ 

In Java 7, this example might be rewritten using a String in the switch statement: 

String units; // Unit of measurement, entered by user, 

double measurement; //A numerical measurement, input by the user, 
double inches; // The same measurement, converted into inches. 

/* Read the user's unit of measurement. */ 

TextIO .putlnC'What unit of measurement does your input use?"); 
Text 10. put ("inches, feet, yards, or miles ?"); 
units = TextIO .getlnO .toLowerCaseO ; 

/* Read user's measurement and convert to inches. */ 

Text 10. put ("Enter the number of " + units + ": "); 
measurement = TextIO . getlnDouble () ; 

switch ( units ) { // Requires Java 7 or higher! 
case "inches" : 

inches = measurement; 

break; 
case "feet": 

inches = measurement * 12; 

break; 
case "yards": 

inches = measurement * 36; 

break; 
case "miles": 

inches = measurement * 12 * 5280; 

break; 
default : 

TextIO .putln( "Wait a minute! Illegal unit of measure! I quit!"); 
System. exit (1) ; 
} // end switch 

3.6.3 Enums in switch Statements 

The type of the expression in a switch can be an enumerated type. In that case, the constants 
in the case labels must be values from the enumerated type. For example, if the type of the 
expression is the enumerated type Season defined by 

enum Season { SPRING, SUMMER, FALL, WINTER } 

then the constants in the case label must be chosen from among the values Season. SPRING, 
Season. SUMMER, Season. FALL, or Season. WINTER. However, there is another quirk in the syn- 
tax: when an enum constant is used in a case label, only the simple name, such as "SPRING" 
can be used, not the full name "Season. SPRING". Of course, the computer already knows that 
the value in the case label must belong to the enumerated type, since it can tell that from the 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



102 



type of expression used, so there is really no need to specify the type name in the constant. As 
an example, suppose that currentSeason is a variable of type Season. Then we could have the 
switch statement: 

switch ( currentSeason ) { 

case WINTER: // ( NOT Season. WINTER ! ) 

System. out. printlnC'December, January, February"); 

break; 
case SPRING: 

System. out .printlnC "March, April, May"); 

break; 
case SUMMER: 

System. out. printlnC June, July, August"); 

break; 
case FALL : 

System. out . printlnC "September , October, November"); 
break; 

} 

3.6.4 Definite Assignment 

As a somewhat more realistic example, the following switch statement makes a ran- 
dom choice among three possible alternatives. Recall that the value of the expression 
(int) (3*Math. random () ) is one of the integers 0, 1, or 2, selected at random with equal 
probability, so the switch statement below will assign one of the values "Rock", "Scissors", 
"Paper" to computerMove, with probability 1/3 for each case. Although the switch statement 
in this example is correct, this code segment as a whole illustrates a subtle syntax error that 
sometimes comes up: 

String computerMove; 
switch ( (int) (3*Math.random()) ) { 
case 0: 

computerMove = "Rock"; 

break; 
case 1: 

computerMove = "Scissors"; 

break; 
case 2: 

computerMove = "Paper"; 

break; 

} 

System. out .printlnC'Computer ' s move is " + computerMove); // ERROR! 

You probably haven't spotted the error, since it's not an error from a human point of view. 
The computer reports the last line to be an error, because the variable computerMove might 
not have been assigned a value. In Java, it is only legal to use the value of a variable if a 
value has already been definitely assigned to that variable. This means that the computer 
must be able to prove, just from looking at the code when the program is compiled, that the 
variable must have been assigned a value. Unfortunately, the computer only has a few simple 
rules that it can apply to make the determination. In this case, it sees a switch statement in 
which the type of expression is int and in which the cases that are covered are 0, 1, and 2. For 
other values of the expression, computerMove is never assigned a value. So, the computer thinks 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



103 



computerMove might still be undefined after the switch statement. Now, in fact, this isn't true: 
0, 1, and 2 are actually the only possible values of the expression (int) (3*Math.random()), 
but the computer isn't smart enough to figure that out. The easiest way to fix the problem 
is to replace the case label case 2 with default. The computer can then see that a value is 
assigned to computerMove in all cases. 

More generally, we say that a value has been definitely assigned to a variable at a given 
point in a program if every execution path leading from the declaration of the variable to that 
point in the code includes an assignment to the variable. This rule takes into account loops 
and if statements as well as switch statements. For example, the following two if statements 
both do the same thing as the switch statement given above, but only the one on the right 
definitely assigns a value to computerMove: 

String computerMove; String computerMove; 

int rand; int rand; 

rand = (int) (3*Math. random ()) ; rand = (int) (3*Math.random()) ; 

if ( rand == ) if ( rand == ) 

computerMove = "Rock"; computerMove = "Rock"; 

else if ( rand == 1 ) else if ( rand == 1 ) 

computerMove = "Scissors"; computerMove = "Scissors"; 

else if ( rand == 2 ) else 

computerMove = "Paper"; computerMove = "Paper"; 

In the code on the left, the test "if ( rand == 2 )" in the final else clause is unnecessary 
because if rand is not or 1, the only remaining possibility is that rand == 2. The computer, 
however, can't figure that out. 



3.7 Introduction to Exceptions and try.. catch 

In addition to the control structures that determine the normal flow of control in a pro- (online) 
gram, Java has a way to deal with "exceptional" cases that throw the flow of control off its 
normal track. When an error occurs during the execution of a program, the default behavior 
is to terminate the program and to print an error message. However, Java makes it possible to 
"catch" such errors and program a response different from simply letting the program crash. 
This is done with the try.. catch statement. In this section, we will take a preliminary, incom- 
plete look at using try. .catch to handle errors. Error handling is a complex topic, which we 
will return to in Chapter 8. 



3.7.1 Exceptions 

The term exception is used to refer to the type of error that one might want to handle with 
a try. .catch. An exception is an exception to the normal flow of control in the program. 
The term is used in preference to "error" because in some cases, an exception might not be 
considered to be an error at all. You can sometimes think of an exception as just another way 
to organize a program. 

Exceptions in Java are represented as objects of type Exception. Actual exceptions are de- 
fined by subclasses of Exception. Different subclasses represent different types of exceptions. 
We will look at only two types of exception in this section: NumberFormatException and Ille- 
gal ArgumentException. 

A NumberFormatException can occur when an attempt is made to convert a string 
into a number. Such conversions are done by the functions Integer .parselnt 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



104 



and Double .parseDouble. (See Subsection 2.5.7.) Consider the function call 
Integer .parselnt(str) where str is a variable of type String. If the value of str is the 
string "42", then the function call will correctly convert the string into the int 42. However, 
if the value of str is, say, "fred", the function call will fail because "fred" is not a legal 
string representation of an int value. In this case, an exception of type NumberFormatException 
occurs. If nothing is done to handle the exception, the program will crash. 

An HlegalArgumentException can occur when an illegal value is passed as a parameter to a 
subroutine. For example, if a subroutine requires that a parameter be greater than or equal to 
zero, an HlegalArgumentException might occur when a negative value is passed to the subroutine. 
How to respond to the illegal value is up to the person who wrote the subroutine, so we 
can't simply say that every illegal parameter value will result in an HlegalArgumentException. 
However, it is a common response. 

One case where an HlegalArgumentException can occur is in the valueOf function of an 
enumerated type. Recall from Subsection 2.3.3 that this function tries to convert a string into 
one of the values of the enumerated type. If the string that is passed as a parameter to valueOf 
is not the name of one of the enumerated type's values, then an HlegalArgumentException occurs. 
For example, given the enumerated type 

emim Toss { HEADS, TAILS } 

Toss . valueOf ( "HEADS" ) correctly returns the value Toss . HEADS, while Toss . valueOf ( "FEET" ) 
results in an HlegalArgumentException. 

3.7.2 try.xatch 

When an exception occurs, we say that the exception is "thrown". For example, we say that 
Integer .parselnt (str) throws an exception of type NumberFormatException when the value 
of str is illegal. When an exception is thrown, it is possible to "catch" the exception and 
prevent it from crashing the program. This is done with a try.. catch statement. In somewhat 
simplified form, the syntax for a try. . catch is: 

try { 

{statements-1 ) 

} 

catch ( {exception-class-name) (variable-name) ) { 
(statements -2) 

y 

The (exception- class-name) could be NumberFormatException, HlegalArgumentException, or 
some other exception class. When the computer executes this statement, it executes the state- 
ments in the try part. If no error occurs during the execution of (statements-1), then the 
computer just skips over the catch part and proceeds with the rest of the program. However, 
if an exception of type (exception-class-name) occurs during the execution of (statements-1), 
the computer immediately jumps to the catch part and executes (statements- 2), skipping any 
remaining statements in (statements-1) . During the execution of (statements- 2), the (variable- 
name) represents the exception object, so that you can, for example, print it out. At the end 
of the catch part, the computer proceeds with the rest of the program; the exception has been 
caught and handled and does not crash the program. Note that only one type of exception is 
caught; if some other type of exception occurs during the execution of (statements-1), it will 
crash the program as usual. 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



105 



By the way, note that the braces, { and }, are part of the syntax of the try. .catch 
statement. They are required even if there is only one statement between the braces. This is 
different from the other statements we have seen, where the braces around a single statement 
are optional. 

As an example, suppose that str is a variable of type String whose value might or might 
not represent a legal real number. Then we could say: 

try { 

double x; 

x = Double. parseDouble (str) ; 

System. out .println( "The number is " + x ); 

} 

catch ( NumberFormatException e ) { 

System. out .println( "Not a legal number." ); 

} 

If an error is thrown by the call to Double. parseDouble (str), then the output statement in 
the try part is skipped, and the statement in the catch part is executed. 

It's not always a good idea to catch exceptions and continue with the program. Often that 
can just lead to an even bigger mess later on, and it might be better just to let the exception 
crash the program at the point where it occurs. However, sometimes it's possible to recover 
from an error. For example, suppose that we have the enumerated type 

enum Day { MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY } 

and we want the user to input a value belonging to this type. TextIO does not know about this 
type, so we can only read the user's response as a string. The function Day.valueOf can be 
used to convert the user's response to a value of type Day. This will throw an exception of type 
IHegalArgumentException if the user's response is not the name of one of the values of type Day, 
but we can recover from the error easily enough by asking the user to enter another response. 
Here is a code segment that does this. (Converting the user's response to upper case will allow 
responses such as "Monday" or "monday" in addition to "MONDAY".) 

Day weekday; // User's response as a value of type Day. 
while ( true ) { 

String response; // User's response as a String. 

System. out .print ("Please enter a day of the week: "); 

response = TextIO . getlnO ; 

response = response .toUpperCaseO ; 

try { 

weekday = Day .valueOf (response) ; 
break; 

} 

catch ( IHegalArgumentException e ) { 

System. out .println( response + " is not the name of a day of the week." ); 

} 

} 

// At this point, a legal value has definitely been assigned to weekday. 

The break statement will be reached only if the user's response is acceptable, and so the loop 
will end only when a legal value has been assigned to weekday. 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



106 



3.7.3 Exceptions in TextIO 

When TextIO reads a numeric value from the user, it makes sure that the user's response is 
legal, using a technique similar to the while loop and try. .catch in the previous example. 
However, TextIO can read data from other sources besides the user. (See Subsection 2.4.5.) 
When it is reading from a file, there is no reasonable way for TextIO to recover from an illegal 
value in the input, so it responds by throwing an exception. To keep things simple, TextIO only 
throws exceptions of type HlegalArgumentException, no matter what type of error it encounters. 
For example, an exception will occur if an attempt is made to read from a file after all the data 
in the file has already been read. In TextIO, the exception is of type HlegalArgumentException. If 
you have a better response to file errors than to let the program crash, you can use a try . . catch 
to catch exceptions of type HlegalArgumentException. 

For example, suppose that a file contains nothing but real numbers, and we want a program 
that will read the numbers and find their sum and their average. Since it is unknown how many 
numbers are in the file, there is the question of when to stop reading. One approach is simply 
to try to keep reading indefinitely. When the end of the file is reached, an exception occurs. 
This exception is not really an error — it's just a way of detecting the end of the data, so we 
can catch the exception and finish up the program. We can read the data in a while (true) 
loop and break out of the loop when an exception occurs. This is an example of the somewhat 
unusual technique of using an exception as part of the expected flow of control in a program. 

To read from the file, we need to know the file's name. To make the program more general, 
we can let the user enter the file name, instead of hard-coding a fixed file name in the program. 
However, it is possible that the user will enter the name of a file that does not exist. When 
we use TextIO . readfile to open a file that does not exist, an exception of type HlegalArgu- 
mentException occurs. We can catch this exception and ask the user to enter a different file 
name. Here is a complete program that uses all these ideas: 

/** 

* This program reads numbers from a file. It computes the sum and 

* the average of the numbers that it reads. The file should contain 

* nothing but numbers of type double; if this is not the case, the 

* output will be the sum and average of however many numbers were 

* successfully read from the file. The name of the file will be 

* input by the user. 
*/ 

public class ReadNumbersFromFile { 

public static void main(String [] args) { 
while (true) { 

String fileName; // The name of the file, to be input by the user. 
TextIO. put ("Enter the name of the file: "); 
fileName = TextIO . getlnO ; 
try { 

TextIO . readFile ( fileName ); // Try to open the file for input, 
break; //If that succeeds, break out of the loop. 

} 

catch ( HlegalArgumentException e ) { 

TextIO. putlnO'Can't read from the file \"" + fileName + "\"."); 
TextIO .putlnC'Please try again. \n"); 

} 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



107 



} 

// At this point, TextIO is reading from the file. 

double number; // A number read from the data file, 
double sum; // The sum of all the numbers read so far. 

int count; // The number of numbers that were read. 

sum = ; 
count = ; 

try { 

while (true) { // Loop ends when an exception occurs, 
number = TextIO. getDouble () ; 

count ++; // This is skipped when the exception occurs 
sum += number; 

} 

} 

catch ( IllegalArgumentException e ) { 

//We expect this to occur when the end-of-file is encountered. 
//We don't consider this to be an error, so there is nothing to do 
// in this catch clause. Just proceed with the rest of the program. 

} 

// At this point, we've read the entire file. 
TextIO. putlnO ; 

TextIO. putln( "Number of data values read: " + count); 
TextIO. putln( "The sum of the data values: " + sum); 
if ( count == ) 

TextIO. putlnC'Can't compute an average of values."); 
else

3.8 Introduction to GUI Programming 

For the PAST TWO CHAPTERS, you've been learning the sort of programming that is done (online) 
inside a single subroutine. In the rest of the text, we'll be more concerned with the larger 
scale structure of programs, but the material that you've already learned will be an important 
foundation for everything to come. 

In this section, before moving on to programming-in-the-large, we'll take a look at how 
programming- in-the-small can be used in other contexts besides text-based, command- line- 
style programs. We'll do this by taking a short, introductory look at applets and graphical 
programming. The point here is not so much to understand GUI programming as it is to 
illustrate that a knowledge of programming-in-the-small applies to writing the guts of any 
subroutine, not just main(). 

An applet is a Java program that runs on a Web page. An applet is not a stand-alone 
application, and it does not have a main() routine. In fact, an applet is an object rather than 
a class. When Java first appeared on the scene, applets were one of its major appeals. Since 
then, they have become much less important, although they can still be very useful. When 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



108 



we study GUI programming in Chapter 6, we will concentrate on stand-alone GUI programs 
rather than on applets, but applets are a good place to start for our first look at the subject. 

When an applet is placed on a Web page, it is assigned a rectangular area on the page. It 
is the job of the applet to draw the contents of that rectangle. When the region needs to be 
drawn, the Web page calls a subroutine in the applet to do so. This is not so different from 
what happens with stand-alone programs. When such a program needs to be run, the system 
calls the main() routine of the program. Similarly, when an applet needs to be drawn, the 
Web page calls a subroutine in the applet. The programmer specifies what happens when this 
routine is called by filling in the body of the routine. Programming in the small! Applets can 
do other things besides draw themselves, such as responding when the user clicks the mouse on 
the applet. Each of the applet's behaviors is defined by a subroutine. The programmer specifies 
how the applet behaves by filling in the bodies of the appropriate subroutines. 

To define an applet, you need a class that is a subclass of the built-in class named Applet. 
To avoid some technicalities in this section as well as to make things a little more interesting, 
we will not work with the Applet class directly. Instead, we will work with a class that I wrote 
named AnimationBase, which is itself a subclass of Applet. AnimationBase makes it easy to 
write simple animations. A computer animation is really just a sequence of still images, 
which are called the frames of the animation. The computer displays the images one after the 
other. Each image differs a bit from the preceding image in the sequence. If the differences are 
not too big and if the sequence is displayed quickly enough, the eye is tricked into perceiving 
continuous motion. To create the animation, you just have to say how to draw each individual 
frame. When using AnimationBase, you do that by filling in the inside of a subroutine named 
drawFrameO . More specifically, to create an animation using AnimationBase, you have write a 
class of the form: 

import j ava . awt . * ; 

public class {name-of -class) extends AnimationBase { 

public void drawFrame (Graphics g) { 
(statements ) 

y 

y 

where {name- of- class) is an identifier that names the class, and the (statements) are the code 
that actually draws the content of one of the frames of the animation. This looks similar to the 
definition of a stand-alone program, but there are a few things here that need to be explained, 
starting with the first line. 

When you write a program, there are certain built-in classes that are available for you to use. 
These built-in classes include System and Math. If you want to use one of these classes, you don't 
have to do anything special. You just go ahead and use it. But Java also has a large number of 
standard classes that are there if you want them but that are not automatically available to your 
program. (There are just too many of them.) If you want to use these classes in your program, 
you have to ask for them first. The standard classes are grouped into so-called "packages." One 
of these packages is called "java.awt". The directive "import java.awt.*;" makes all the classes 
from the package java.awt available for use in your program. The java.awt package contains 
classes related to graphical user interface programming, including a class called Graphics. The 
Graphics class is referred to in the drawFrame () routine above and will be used for drawing 
the frame. 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



109 



The definition of the class above says that the class "extends AnimationBase." The Ani- 
mationBase class includes all the basic properties and behaviors of applet objects (since it is a 
subclass of Applet). It also defines the basic properties and behaviors of animations — it "ex- 
tends" class Applet by adding in this extra stuff. When you extend AnimationBase, you inherit 
all these properties and behaviors, and you can add even more stuff, in particular the drawing 
commands that you want to use to create your animation. 

(One more thing needs to be mentioned — and this is a point where Java's syntax gets 
unfortunately confusing. You can skip this explanation until Chapter 5 if you want. Applets are 
objects, not classes. Instead of being static members of a class, the subroutines that define the 
applet's behavior are part of the applet object. We say that they are "non-static" subroutines. 
Of course, objects are related to classes because every object is described by a class. Now here 
is the part that can get confusing: Even though a non-static subroutine is not actually part of 
a class (in the sense of being part of the behavior of the class itself) , it is nevertheless defined 
in a class (in the sense that the Java code that defines the subroutine is part of the Java code 
that defines the class). Many objects can be described by the same class. Each object has its 
own non-static subroutine. But the common definition of those subroutines — the actual Java 
source code — is physically part of the class that describes all the objects. To put it briefly: 
static subroutines in a class definition say what the class does; non-static subroutines say what 
all the objects described by the class do. The drawFrameO routine is an example of a non- 
static subroutine. A stand-alone program's main() routine is an example of a static subroutine. 
The distinction doesn't really matter too much at this point: When working with stand-alone 
programs, mark everything with the reserved word, "static"; leave it out when working with 
applets. However, the distinction between static and non-static will become more important 
later in the course.) 

* * * 

Let's write an applet based on AnimationBase. In order to draw the content, we'll need 
to know some basic subroutines that are already available for drawing, just as in writing text- 
oriented programs we need to know what subroutines are available for reading and writing text. 
In Java, the built-in drawing subroutines are found in objects of the class Graphics, one of the 
classes in the java.awt package. In our applet's drawFrameO routine, we can use the Graphics 
object g for drawing. (This object is provided as a parameter to the drawFrameO routine when 
that routine is called.) Graphics objects contain many subroutines. I'll mention just three of 
them here. You'll encounter more of them in Chapter 6. 

• g. setColor (c) , is called to set the color that is used for drawing. The parameter, c is 
an object belonging to a class named Color, another one of the classes in the java.awt 
package. About a dozen standard colors are available as static member variables in 
the Color class. These standard colors include Color. BLACK, Color. WHITE, Color. RED, 
Color. GREEN, and Color. BLUE. For example, if you want to draw in red, you would say 
"g. setColor (Color. RED) ;". The specified color is used for all subsequent drawing oper- 
ations up until the next time setColor () is called. 

• g.drawRect(x,y,w,h) draws the outline of a rectangle. The parameters x, y, w, and h 
must be integers or integer-valued expressions. This subroutine draws the outline of the 
rectangle whose top-left corner is x pixels from the left edge of the applet and y pixels 
down from the top of the applet. The width of the rectangle is w pixels, and the height 
is h pixels. The color that is used is black, unless a different color has been set by calling 
setColor () . 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



110 



• g.f illRect (x,y , w,h) is similar to drawRect except that it fills in the inside of the rect- 
angle instead of just drawing an outline. 

This is enough information to write an applet that will draw the following image on a Web 
page: 



] 



Although the applet is defined as an animation, you don't see any movement because all the 
frames that are drawn are identical! This is rather silly, and we will fix it in the next example. 
But for now, we are just interested in seeing how to use drawing routines to draw a picture. 

The applet first fills its entire rectangular area with red. Then it changes the drawing color 
to black and draws a sequence of rectangles, where each rectangle is nested inside the previous 
one. The rectangles can be drawn with a while loop, which draws the rectangles starting from 
the outside and moving in. Each time through the loop, the rectangle that is drawn is smaller 
than the previous one and is moved down and over a bit. We'll need variables to hold the 
width and height of the rectangle and a variable to record how far the top-left corner of the 
rectangle is inset from the edges of the applet. The while loop ends when the rectangle shrinks 
to nothing. In general outline, the algorithm for drawing the applet is 

Set the drawing color to red (using the g.setColor subroutine) 
Fill in the entire applet (using the g.fillRect subroutine) 
Set the drawing color to black 
Set the top-left corner inset to be 

Set the rectangle width and height to be as big as the applet 
while the width and height are greater than zero: 

draw a rectangle (using the g. drawRect subroutine) 

increase the inset 

decrease the width and the height 

In my applet, each rectangle is 15 pixels away from the rectangle that surrounds it, so the 
inset is increased by 15 each time through the while loop. The rectangle shrinks by 15 pixels 
on the left and by 15 pixels on the right, so the width of the rectangle shrinks by 30 each time 
through the loop. The height also shrinks by 30 pixels each time through the loop. 

It is not hard to code this algorithm into Java and use it to define the drawFrameQ method 
of the applet. I've assumed that the applet has a height of 160 pixels and a width of 300 pixels. 
The size is actually set in the source code of the Web page where the applet appears. In order 
for an applet to appear on a page, the source code for the page must include a command that 
specifies which applet to run and how big it should be. (We'll see how to do that later; see 
Exercise 3.6 and Section 6.2.) It's not a great idea to assume that we know how big the applet 
is going to be, as I do here; I'll address that issue before the end of this section. But for now, 
here is the source code for the applet:

rectHeight -=30; // height decreases by 15 pixels on top and 15 on bottom 

} 

} // end paint () 

} // end class StaticRects 

(You might wonder why the initial rectWidth is set to 299, instead of to 300, since the 
width of the applet is 300 pixels. It's because rectangles are drawn as if with a pen whose nib 
hangs below and to the right of the point where the pen is placed. If you run the pen exactly 
along the right edge of the applet, the line it draws is actually outside the applet and therefore 
is not seen. So instead, we run the pen along a line one pixel to the left of the edge of the 
applet. The same reasoning applies to rectHeight. Careful graphics programming demands 
attention to details like these.) 

* * * 

When you write an animation applet, you get to build on AnimationBase which in turn 
builds on the work of the people who wrote the Applet class. The AnimationBase class provides 
a framework on which you can hang your own work. Any programmer can create additional 
frameworks that can be used by other programmers as a basis for writing specific types of 
applets or stand-alone programs. This makes it possible for other programmers to build on 
their work even without understanding in detail what goes on "inside" the code that they 
wrote. This type of thing is the key to building complex systems! 

Let's continue our example by animating the rectangles in our applet. You can see the 
animation in action at the bottom of the on-line version of this section. 

In the animation, rectangles shrink continually towards the center of the applet, while new 
rectangles appear at the edge. The perpetual motion is, of course, an illusion. If you think 
about it, you'll see that the animation loops through the same set of images over and over. 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



112 



In each image, there is a gap between the borders of the applet and the outermost rectangle. 
This gap gets wider and wider until a new rectangle appears at the border. Only it's not a new 
rectangle. You are seeing a picture that is identical to the first picture that was drawn. What 
has really happened is that the animation has started over again with the first image in the 
sequence. 

In order to create motion in the animation, drawFrameO will have to draw a different 
picture each time it is called. How can it do that? The picture that should be drawn will 
depend on the frame number, that is, how many frames have been drawn so far. To find out 
the current frame number, we can use a function that is built into the AnimationBase class. This 
class provides the function named getFrameNumber () that you can call to find out the current 
frame number. This function returns the current frame number as an integer value. If the value 
returned is 0, you are supposed to draw the first frame; if the value is 1, you are supposed to 
draw the second frame, and so on. Depending on the frame number, the drawFrameO method 
will draw different pictures. 

In the animation that we are writing, the thing that differs from one frame to another is 
the distance between the edges of the applet and the outermost rectangle. Since the rectangles 
are 15 pixels apart, this distance increases from to 14 and then jumps back to when a 
"new" rectangle appears. The appropriate value can be computed very simply from the frame 
number, with the statement "inset = getFrameNumber ( ) °/ 15;". The value of the expression 
getFrameNumber () % 15 is always between and 14. When the frame number reaches 15 or 
any multiple of 15, the value of getFrameNumber () % 15 jumps back to 0. 

Drawing one frame in the sample animated applet is very similar to drawing the single image 
of the original StaticRects applet. We only have to make a few changes to the drawFrameO 
method. I've chosen to make one additional improvement: The StaticRects applet assumes that 
the applet is exactly 300 by 160 pixels. The new version, MovingRects, will work for any applet 
size. To implement this, the drawFrameO routine has to know how big the applet is. There are 
two functions that can be called to get this information. The function getWidthO returns an 
integer value representing the width of the applet, and the function getHeightO returns the 
height. These functions are inherited from the Applet class. The width and height, together 
with the frame number, are used to compute the size of the first rectangle that is drawn. Here 
is the complete source code: 

import j ava . awt . * ; 

public class MovingRects extends AnimationBase { 

public void initO { 

// The initO method is called when the applet is first 
// created and can be used to initialize the applet. 
// Here, it is used to change the number of milliseconds 
// per frame from the default 100 to 30. The faster 
// animation looks better. 
setMillisecondsPerFrame (30) ; 

} 

public void drawFrame (Graphics g) { 

// Draw one frame in the animation by filling in the background 
// with a solid red and then drawing a set of nested black 
// rectangles. The frame number tells how much the first 
// rectangle is to be inset from the borders of the applet. 



CHAPTER 3. CONTROL 



113 



int width; // Width of the applet, in pixels, 
int height; // Height of the applet, in pixels. 

int inset; // Gap between borders of applet and a rectangle. 

// The inset for the outermost rectangle goes from to 

// 14 then back to 0, and so on, as the frameNumber varies. 

int rectWidth, rectHeight; // the size of one of the rectangles 

width = getWidthO ; // find out the size of the drawing area 
height = getHeightO; 

g. setColor (Color. red) ; // fill the frame with red 
g.f illRect(0,0, width, height) ; 

g. setColor (Color .black) ; // switch color to black 

inset = getFrameNumber () % 15; // get the inset for the outermost rect 

rectWidth = width - 2*inset - 1; // set size of the outermost rect 
rectHeight = height - 2*inset - 1; 

while (rectWidth >= && rectHeight >= 0) { 

g. drawRect (inset , inset .rectWidth, rectHeight) ; 
inset +=15; // rects are 15 pixels apart 

rectWidth -=30; // width decreases by 15 pixels on left and 15 on right 
rectHeight -=30; // height decreases by 15 pixels on top and 15 on bottom 

} 

} // end drawFrameO 

} // end class MovingRects 

The main point here is that by building on an existing framework, you can do interesting 
things using the type of local, inside-a-subroutine programming that was covered in Chapter 2 
and Chapter 3. As you learn more about programming and more about Java, you'll be able 
to do more on your own — but no matter how much you learn, you'll always be dependent on 
other people's work to some extent.

Exercises for Chapter 3 

1. How many times do you have to roll a pair of dice before they come up snake eyes? You (solution) 
could do the experiment by rolling the dice by hand. Write a computer program that 
simulates the experiment. The program should report the number of rolls that it makes 

before the dice come up snake eyes. (Note: "Snake eyes" means that both dice show a 
value of 1.) Exercise 2.2 explained how to simulate rolling a pair of dice. 

2. Which integer between 1 and 10000 has the largest number of divisors, and how many (solution) 
divisors does it have? Write a program to find the answers and print out the results. It is 

possible that several integers in this range have the same, maximum number of divisors. 
Your program only has to print out one of them. An example in Subsection 3.4.2 discussed 
divisors. The source code for that example is CountDivisors.java. 

You might need some hints about how to find a maximum value. The basic idea is 
to go through all the integers, keeping track of the largest number of divisors that you've 
seen so far. Also, keep track of the integer that had that number of divisors. 

3. Write a program that will evaluate simple expressions such as 17 + 3 and 3.14159 * 4.7. (solution) 
The expressions are to be typed in by the user. The input always consist of a number, 

followed by an operator, followed by another number. The operators that are allowed are 
+ , -, *, and /. You can read the numbers with TextlD.getDoubleO and the operator 
with TextlO. get Char (). Your program should read an expression, print its value, read 
another expression, print its value, and so on. The program should end when the user 
enters as the first number on the line. 

4. Write a program that reads one line of input text and breaks it up into words. The (solution) 
words should be output one per line. A word is defined to be a sequence of letters. Any 
characters in the input that are not letters should be discarded. For example, if the user 

inputs the line 

He said, "That's not a good idea." 
then the output of the program should be 
He 

said 
That 
s 

not 
a 

good 
idea 

An improved version of the program would list "that's" as a single word. An apostrophe 
can be considered to be part of a word if there is a letter on each side of the apostrophe. 

To test whether a character is a letter, you might use (ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z') I I 
(ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z'). However, this only works in English and similar languages. 
A better choice is to call the standard function Character . isLetter(ch), which returns 
a boolean value of true if ch is a letter and false if it is not. This works for any Unicode 
character.

5. Suppose that a file contains information about sales figures for a company in various cities. (solution) 
Each line of the file contains a city name, followed by a colon (:) followed by the data for 

that city. The data is a number of type double. However, for some cities, no data was 
available. In these lines, the data is replaced by a comment explaining why the data is 
missing. For example, several lines from the file might look like: 

San Francisco: 19887.32 
Chicago: no report received 
New York: 298734.12 

Write a program that will compute and print the total sales from all the cities together. 
The program should also report the number of cities for which data was not available. 
The name of the file is "sales.dat". 

To complete this program, you'll need one fact about file input with TextIO that was 
not covered in Subsection 2.4.5. Since you don't know in advance how many lines there 
are in the file, you need a way to tell when you have gotten to the end of the file. When 
TextIO is reading from a file, the function TextIO. eof () can be used to test for end of 
file. This boolean-valued function returns true if the file has been entirely read and 
returns false if there is more data to read in the file. This means that you can read the 
lines of the file in a loop while (TextIO . eof () == false) .... The loop will end when 
all the lines of the file have been read. 

Suggestion: For each line, read and ignore characters up to the colon. Then read the 
rest of the line into a variable of type String. Try to convert the string into a number, and 
use try. . catch to test whether the conversion succeeds. 

6. Write an applet that draws a checkerboard. Write your solution as a subclass of Anima- (solution) 
tionBase, even though all the frames that it draws will be the same. Assume that the size 

of the applet is 160 by 160 pixels. Each square in the checkerboard is 20 by 20 pixels. The 
checkerboard contains 8 rows of squares and 8 columns. The squares are red and black. 
Here is a tricky way to determine whether a given square should be red or black: If the 
row number and the column number are either both even or both odd, then the square 
is red. Otherwise, it is black. Note that a square is just a rectangle in which the height 
is equal to the width, so you can use the subroutine g.fillRectQ to draw the squares. 
Here is an image of the checkerboard: 



Exercises

(To run an applet, you need a Web page to display it. A very simple page will do. 
Assume that your applet class is called Checkerboard, so that when you compile it you 
get a class file named Checkerboard, class Make a file that contains only the lines: 

<applet code=" Checkerboard. class" width=160 height=160> 
</applet> 

Call this file Checkerboard.html. This is the source code for a simple Web page that 
shows nothing but your applet. The compiled class file, Checkerboard, class, must 
be in the same directory with the Web-page file, Checkerboard.html. Furthermore, 
since your program depends on the non-standard class AnimationBase, you also have to 
make that class available to your program. To do this, you should compile the source 
code, AnimationBase.java. You can find a copy on the Source Code page of the on- 
line version of this book. The result will be two class files, AnimationBase . class and 
AnimationBase$l . class. Place both of these class files in the same directory, together 
with Checkerboard.html and Checkerboard, class. Now, to run the applet, simply open 
Checkerboard.html in a web browser. Alternatively, on the command line, you can use 
the command 

appletviewer Checkerboard.html 

The appletviewer command, like java and javac is part of a standard installation of 
the JDK. 

If you are using the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment, you should add 
AnimationBase.java to the project where you want to write Checkerboard, java. You 
can then simply right-click the name of the source code file in the Package Explorer. In 
the pop-up menu, go to "Run As" then to "Java Applet". This will open the window in 
which the applet appears. The default size for the window is bigger than 160-by-160, so 
the drawing of the checkerboard will not fill the entire window.) 

7. Write an animation applet that shows a checkerboard pattern in which the even numbered (solution) 
rows slide to the left while the odd numbered rows slide to the right. You can assume 
that the applet is 160 by 160 pixels. Each row can be offset towards the left or right 
from its usual position by the amount getFrameNumber () % 40. Hints: Anything you 
draw outside the boundaries of the applet will be invisible, so you can draw more than 
8 squares in a row. You can use negative values of x in g.f illRect(x,y,w,h). (Before 
trying to do this exercise, it would be a good idea to look at a working applet, which can 
be found in the on-line version of this book.) 

As with Exercise 3.6, you can write your class as a subclass of AnimationBase. Compile 
and run the program in the same way, as described in that exercise. Assuming that the 
name of your class is SlidingCheckerboard, then the source file for the Web page this 
time should contain the lines: 

<applet code="SlidingCheckerboard. class" width=160 height=160> 
</applet>

Chapter 4 



Programming in the Large I: 
Subroutines 

One way to break up a complex PROGRAM into manageable pieces is to use subroutines. 
A subroutine consists of the instructions for carrying out a certain task, grouped together and 
given a name. Elsewhere in the program, that name can be used as a stand-in for the whole set 
of instructions. As a computer executes a program, whenever it encounters a subroutine name, 
it executes all the instructions necessary to carry out the task associated with that subroutine. 

Subroutines can be used over and over, at different places in the program. A subroutine 
can even be used inside another subroutine. This allows you to write simple subroutines and 
then use them to help write more complex subroutines, which can then be used in turn in other 
subroutines. In this way, very complex programs can be built up step- by-step, where each step 
in the construction is reasonably simple. 

As mentioned in Section 3.8, subroutines in Java can be either static or non-static. This 
chapter covers static subroutines only. Non-static subroutines, which are used in true object- 
oriented programming, will be covered in the next chapter. 

4.1 Black Boxes 

A subroutine consists of instructions for performing some task, chunked together and (online) 
given a name. "Chunking" allows you to deal with a potentially very complicated task as 
a single concept. Instead of worrying about the many, many steps that the computer might 
have to go though to perform that task, you just need to remember the name of the subroutine. 
Whenever you want your program to perform the task, you just call the subroutine. Subroutines 
are a major tool for dealing with complexity. 

A subroutine is sometimes said to be a "black box" because you can't see what's "inside" 
it (or, to be more precise, you usually don't want to see inside it, because then you would 
have to deal with all the complexity that the subroutine is meant to hide). Of course, a black 
box that has no way of interacting with the rest of the world would be pretty useless. A black 
box needs some kind of interface with the rest of the world, which allows some interaction 
between what's inside the box and what's outside. A physical black box might have buttons 
on the outside that you can push, dials that you can set, and slots that can be used for passing 
information back and forth. Since we are trying to hide complexity, not create it, we have the 
first rule of black boxes: 



119 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



120 



The interface of a black box should be fairly straight- 
forward, well-defined, and easy to understand. 

Are there any examples of black boxes in the real world? Yes; in fact, you are surrounded 
by them. Your television, your car, your mobile phone, your refrigerator. . . . You can turn your 
television on and off, change channels, and set the volume by using elements of the television's 
interface — dials, remote control, don't forget to plug in the power — without understanding 
anything about how the thing actually works. The same goes for a mobile phone, although the 
interface in that case is a lot more complicated. 

Now, a black box does have an inside — the code in a subroutine that actually performs 
the task, all the electronics inside your television set. The inside of a black box is called its 
implementation. The second rule of black boxes is that: 

To use a black box, you shouldn't need to know any- 
thing about its implementation; all you need to know is 
its interface. 

In fact, it should be possible to change the implementation, as long as the behavior of the 
box, as seen from the outside, remains unchanged. For example, when the insides of TV sets 
went from using vacuum tubes to using transistors, the users of the sets didn't even need to 
know about it — or even know what it means. Similarly, it should be possible to rewrite the 
inside of a subroutine, to use more efficient code, for example, without affecting the programs 
that use that subroutine. 

Of course, to have a black box, someone must have designed and built the implementation 
in the first place. The black box idea works to the advantage of the implementor as well as 
the user of the black box. After all, the black box might be used in an unlimited number of 
different situations. The implementor of the black box doesn't need to know about any of that. 
The implementor just needs to make sure that the box performs its assigned task and interfaces 
correctly with the rest of the world. This is the third rule of black boxes: 

The implementor of a black box should not need to 
know anything about the larger systems in which the box 
will be used. 

In a way, a black box divides the world into two parts: the inside (implementation) and the 
outside. The interface is at the boundary, connecting those two parts. 

* * * 

By the way, you should not think of an interface as just the physical connection between 
the box and the rest of the world. The interface also includes a specification of what the 
box does and how it can be controlled by using the elements of the physical interface. It's not 
enough to say that a TV set has a power switch; you need to specify that the power switch is 
used to turn the TV on and off! 

To put this in computer science terms, the interface of a subroutine has a semantic as well 
as a syntactic component. The syntactic part of the interface tells you just what you have 
to type in order to call the subroutine. The semantic component specifies exactly what task 
the subroutine will accomplish. To write a legal program, you need to know the syntactic 
specification of the subroutine. To understand the purpose of the subroutine and to use it 
effectively, you need to know the subroutine's semantic specification. I will refer to both parts 
of the interface — syntactic and semantic — collectively as the contract of the subroutine. 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



121 



The contract of a subroutine says, essentially, "Here is what you have to do to use me, 
and here is what I will do for you, guaranteed." When you write a subroutine, the comments 
that you write for the subroutine should make the contract very clear. (I should admit that 
in practice, subroutines' contracts are often inadequately specified, much to the regret and 
annoyance of the programmers who have to use them.) 

For the rest of this chapter, I turn from general ideas about black boxes and subroutines 
in general to the specifics of writing and using subroutines in Java. But keep the general ideas 
and principles in mind. They are the reasons that subroutines exist in the first place, and they 
are your guidelines for using them. This should be especially clear in Section 4.6, where I will 
discuss subroutines as a tool in program development. 

* * * 

You should keep in mind that subroutines are not the only example of black boxes in 
programming. For example, a class is also a black box. We'll see that a class can have a 
"public" part, representing its interface, and a "private" part that is entirely inside its hidden 
implementation. All the principles of black boxes apply to classes as well as to subroutines. 

4.2 Static Subroutines and Static Variables 

Every subroutine in Java must be defined inside some class. This makes Java rather (online) 
unusual among programming languages, since most languages allow free-floating, independent 
subroutines. One purpose of a class is to group together related subroutines and variables. 
Perhaps the designers of Java felt that everything must be related to something. As a less 
philosophical motivation, Java's designers wanted to place firm controls on the ways things are 
named, since a Java program potentially has access to a huge number of subroutines created by 
many different programmers. The fact that those subroutines are grouped into named classes 
(and classes are grouped into named "packages" ) helps control the confusion that might result 
from so many different names. 

A subroutine that is a member of a class is often called a method, and "method" is the 
term that most people prefer for subroutines in Java. I will start using the term "method" 
occasionally; however, I will continue to prefer the more general term "subroutine" in this 
chapter, at least for static subroutines. This chapter will deal with static subroutines almost 
exclusively. We'll turn to non-static methods and object-oriented programming in the next 
chapter. 

4.2.1 Subroutine Definitions 

A subroutine definition in Java takes the form: 

(modifiers) (return-type) (subroutine-name) ( (parameter-list) ) { 
(statements ) 

y 

It will take us a while — most of the chapter — to get through what all this means in detail. Of 
course, you've already seen examples of subroutines in previous chapters, such as the main() 
routine of a program and the drawFrameQ routine of the animation applets in Section 3.8. So 
you are familiar with the general format. 

The (statements) between the braces, { and }, in a subroutine definition make up the body 
of the subroutine. These statements are the inside, or implementation part, of the "black box", 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



122 



as discussed in the previous section. They are the instructions that the computer executes when 
the method is called. Subroutines can contain any of the statements discussed in Chapter 2 
and Chapter 3. 

The (modifiers) that can occur at the beginning of a subroutine definition are words that 
set certain characteristics of the subroutine, such as whether it is static or not. The modifiers 
that you've seen so far are "static" and "public". There are only about a half-dozen possible 
modifiers altogether. 

If the subroutine is a function, whose job is to compute some value, then the (return-type) is 
used to specify the type of value that is returned by the function. We'll be looking at functions 
and return types in some detail in Section 4.4. If the subroutine is not a function, then the 
(return-type) is replaced by the special value void, which indicates that no value is returned. 
The term "void" is meant to indicate that the return value is empty or non-existent. 

Finally, we come to the (parameter-list) of the method. Parameters are part of the interface 
of a subroutine. They represent information that is passed into the subroutine from outside, 
to be used by the subroutine's internal computations. For a concrete example, imagine a class 
named Television that includes a method named change Channel () . The immediate question 
is: What channel should it change to? A parameter can be used to answer this question. Since 
the channel number is an integer, the type of the parameter would be int, and the declaration 
of the changeChannel () method might look like 

public void changeChannel (int channelNum) { . . . } 

This declaration specifies that changeChannel () has a parameter named channelNum of type 
int. However, channelNum does not yet have any particular value. A value for channelNum is 
provided when the subroutine is called; for example: changeChannel (17) ; 

The parameter list in a subroutine can be empty, or it can consist of one or more parameter 
declarations of the form (type) (parameter-name). If there are several declarations, they are 
separated by commas. Note that each declaration can name only one parameter. For example, 
if you want two parameters of type double, you have to say "double x, double y", rather 
than "double x, y". 

Parameters are covered in more detail in the next section. 

Here are a few examples of subroutine definitions, leaving out the statements that define 
what the subroutines do: 

public static void playGameO { 

// "public" and "static" are modifiers; "void" is the 
// return-type; "playGame" is the subroutine-name; 
// the parameter-list is empty. 

. . . // Statements that define what playGame does go here. 

} 

int getNextN(int N) { 

// There are no modifiers; "int" in the return-type; 
// "getNextN" is the subroutine-name; the parameter-list 
// includes one parameter whose name is "N" and whose 
// type is "int". 

. . . // Statements that define what getNextN does go here. 

} 

static boolean lessThan (double x, double y) { 
// "static" is a modifier; "boolean" is the 
// return-type; "lessThan" is the subroutine-name; 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



123 



// the parameter-list includes two parameters whose names are 
// "x" and "y" , and the type of each of these parameters 
// is "double". 

. . . // Statements that define what lessThan does go here. 

} 

In the second example given here, getNextN is a non-static method, since its definition does 
not include the modifier "static" — and so it's not an example that we should be looking at in 
this chapter! The other modifier shown in the examples is "public". This modifier indicates 
that the method can be called from anywhere in a program, even from outside the class where 
the method is defined. There is another modifier, "private", which indicates that the method 
can be called only from inside the same class. The modifiers public and private are called 
access specifiers. If no access specifier is given for a method, then by default, that method 
can be called from anywhere in the "package" that contains the class, but not from outside 
that package. (Packages were introduced in Subsection 2.6.4, and you'll learn more about them 
later in this chapter, in Section 4.5.) There is one other access modifier, protected, which will 
only become relevant when we turn to object-oriented programming in Chapter 5. 

Note, by the way, that the main() routine of a program follows the usual syntax rules for 
a subroutine. In 

public static void main(String [] args) { . . . } 

the modifiers are public and static, the return type is void, the subroutine name is main, and 
the parameter list is "String [] args" . The only question might be about "String [] " , which 
has to be a type if it is to match the syntax of a parameter list. In fact, String [] represents 
a so-called "array type", so the syntax is valid. We will cover arrays in Chapter 7. (The 
parameter, args, represents information provided to the program when the main() routine is 
called by the system. In case you know the term, the information consists of any "command-line 
arguments" specified in the command that the user typed to run the program.) 

You've already had some experience with filling in the implementation of a subroutine. In 
this chapter, you'll learn all about writing your own complete subroutine definitions, including 
the interface part. 

4.2.2 Calling Subroutines 

When you define a subroutine, all you are doing is telling the computer that the subroutine 
exists and what it does. The subroutine doesn't actually get executed until it is called. (This 
is true even for the main() routine in a class — even though you don't call it, it is called by the 
system when the system runs your program.) For example, the playGameO method given as 
an example above could be called using the following subroutine call statement: 

playGame () ; 

This statement could occur anywhere in the same class that includes the definition of 
playGame (), whether in a main() method or in some other subroutine. Since playGame () 
is a public method, it can also be called from other classes, but in that case, you have to tell 
the computer which class it comes from. Since playGame () is a static method, its full name 
includes the name of the class in which it is defined. Let's say, for example, that playGame () is 
defined in a class named Poker. Then to call playGame () from outside the Poker class, you 
would have to say 

Poker . playGame ( ) ; 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



124 



The use of the class name here tells the computer which class to look in to find the method. It 
also lets you distinguish between Poker .playGameO and other potential playGameO methods 
defined in other classes, such as Roulette .playGameO or Blackjack. playGameO ■ 

More generally, a subroutine call statement for a static subroutine takes the form 

(subroutine-name) ((parameters)) ; 

if the subroutine that is being called is in the same class, or 

(class-name) . (subroutine-name) ((parameters)) ; 

if the subroutine is defined elsewhere, in a different class. (Non-static methods belong to objects 
rather than classes, and they are called using object names instead of class names. More on 
that later.) Note that the parameter list can be empty, as in the playGameO example, but the 
parentheses must be there even if there is nothing between them. The number of parameters 
that you provide when you call a subroutine must match the number listed in the parameter 
list in the subroutine definition, and the types of the parameters in the call statement must 
match the types in the subroutine definition. 

4.2.3 Subroutines in Programs 

It's time to give an example of what a complete program looks like, when it includes other 
subroutines in addition to the main() routine. Let's write a program that plays a guessing 
game with the user. The computer will choose a random number between 1 and 100, and the 
user will try to guess it. The computer tells the user whether the guess is high or low or correct. 
If the user gets the number after six guesses or fewer, the user wins the game. After each game, 
the user has the option of continuing with another game. 

Since playing one game can be thought of as a single, coherent task, it makes sense to write 
a subroutine that will play one guessing game with the user. The main() routine will use a 
loop to call the playGameO subroutine over and over, as many times as the user wants to play. 
We approach the problem of designing the playGameO subroutine the same way we write a 
main() routine: Start with an outline of the algorithm and apply stepwise refinement. Here is 
a short pseudocode algorithm for a guessing game routine: 

Pick a random number 
while the game is not over: 
Get the user's guess 

Tell the user whether the guess is high, low, or correct. 

The test for whether the game is over is complicated, since the game ends if either the user 
makes a correct guess or the number of guesses is six. As in many cases, the easiest thing to 
do is to use a "while (true)" loop and use break to end the loop whenever we find a reason 
to do so. Also, if we are going to end the game after six guesses, we'll have to keep track of the 
number of guesses that the user has made. Filling out the algorithm gives: 

Let computersNumber be a random number between 1 and 100 
Let guessCount = 
while (true) : 

Get the user's guess 

Count the guess by adding 1 to guess count 
if the user's guess equals computersNumber: 

Tell the user he won 

break out of the loop 
if the number of guesses is 6: 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



125 



Tell the user he lost 

break out of the loop 
if the user's guess is less than computersNumber : 

Tell the user the guess was low 
else if the user's guess is higher than computersNumber: 

Tell the user the guess was high 

With variable declarations added and translated into Java, this becomes the definition of the 
playGameO routine. A random integer between 1 and 100 can be computed as (int) (100 * 
Math . random () ) + 1. I've cleaned up the interaction with the user to make it flow better. 

static void playGameO { 

int computersNumber; // A random number picked by the computer. 

int usersGuess; // A number entered by user as a guess. 

int guessCount; // Number of guesses the user has made. 

computersNumber = (int) (100 * Math.randomO ) + 1; 

// The value assigned to computersNumber is a randomly 
// chosen integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. 

guessCount = 0; 

TextlD.putlnO ; 

Text ID. put ("What is your first guess? "); 
while (true) { 

usersGuess = TextIO . getlnt () ; // Get the user's guess. 

guessCount ++ ; 

if (usersGuess == computersNumber) { 

TextIO. putlnC'You got it in " + guessCount 

+ " guesses ! My number was " + computersNumber) ; 
break; // The game is over; the user has won. 

} 

if (guessCount == 6) { 

TextIO .putlnC'You didn't get the number in 6 guesses."); 
TextIO .putlnC'You lose. My number was " + computersNumber); 
break; // The game is over; the user has lost. 

} 

// If we get to this point, the game continues. 

// Tell the user if the guess was too high or too low. 

if (usersGuess < computersNumber) 

Text 10. put ("That's too low. Try again: "); 
else if (usersGuess > computersNumber) 

Text 10. put ("That's too high. Try again: "); 

} 

TextlD.putlnO ; 
} // end of playGameO 

Now, where exactly should you put this? It should be part of the same class as the main() 
routine, but not inside the main routine. It is not legal to have one subroutine physically 
nested inside another. The main() routine will call playGameO, but not contain it physically. 
You can put the definition of playGameO either before or after the main() routine. Java is not 
very picky about having the members of a class in any particular order. 

It's pretty easy to write the main routine. You've done things like this before. Here's what 
the complete program looks like (except that a serious program needs more comments than I've 
included here). 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



126 



public class GuessingGame { 

public static void main (String [] args) { 

TextIO .putln( "Let's play a game. I'll pick a number between"); 
TextlO.putlnC'l and 100, and you try to guess it."); 
boolean playAgain; 
do { 

playGameO; // call subroutine to play one game 
TextIO. put ("Would you like to play again? "); 
playAgain = TextIO . getlnBooleanO ; 
y while (playAgain) ; 

TextIO. putln( "Thanks for playing. Goodbye."); 
} // end of mainO 

static void playGameO { 

int computersNumber ; // A random number picked by the computer. 

int usersGuess; // A number entered by user as a guess. 

int guessCount; // Number of guesses the user has made. 

computersNumber = (int) (100 * Math . random () ) + 1; 

// The value assigned to computersNumber is a randomly 
// chosen integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. 

guessCount = 0; 

TextIO. put In ; 

TextIO .put ("What is your first guess? "); 
while (true) { 

usersGuess = TextIO .getlnt () ; // Get the user's guess. 

guessCount++; 

if (usersGuess == computersNumber) { 

TextIO .putlnC'You got it in " + guessCount 

+ " guesses! My number was " + computersNumber); 
break; // The game is over; the user has won. 

> 

if (guessCount == 6) { 

TextIO .putlnC'You didn't get the number in 6 guesses."); 
TextIO .putlnC'You lose. My number was " + computersNumber); 
break; // The game is over; the user has lost. 

} 

// If we get to this point, the game continues. 

// Tell the user if the guess was too high or too low. 

if (usersGuess < computersNumber) 

TextIO. put ("That's too low. Try again: "); 
else if (usersGuess > computersNumber) 

Text 10. put ("That's too high. Try again: "); 

} 

TextIO. put In ; 
} // end of playGameO 

} // end of class GuessingGame 

Take some time to read the program carefully and figure out how it works. And try to 
convince yourself that even in this relatively simple case, breaking up the program into two 
methods makes the program easier to understand and probably made it easier to write each 
piece. 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



127 



4.2.4 Member Variables 

A class can include other things besides subroutines. In particular, it can also include variable 
declarations. Of course, you can declare variables inside subroutines. Those are called local 
variables. However, you can also have variables that are not part of any subroutine. To 
distinguish such variables from local variables, we call them member variables , since they 
are members of a class. 

Just as with subroutines, member variables can be either static or non-static. In this 
chapter, we'll stick to static variables. A static member variable belongs to the class itself, and 
it exists as long as the class exists. Memory is allocated for the variable when the class is first 
loaded by the Java interpreter. Any assignment statement that assigns a value to the variable 
changes the content of that memory, no matter where that assignment statement is located in 
the program. Any time the variable is used in an expression, the value is fetched from that 
same memory, no matter where the expression is located in the program. This means that the 
value of a static member variable can be set in one subroutine and used in another subroutine. 
Static member variables are "shared" by all the static subroutines in the class. A local variable 
in a subroutine, on the other hand, exists only while that subroutine is being executed, and is 
completely inaccessible from outside that one subroutine. 

The declaration of a member variable looks just like the declaration of a local variable 
except for two things: The member variable is declared outside any subroutine (although it 
still has to be inside a class), and the declaration can be marked with modifiers such as static, 
public, and private. Since we are only working with static member variables for now, every 
declaration of a member variable in this chapter will include the modifier static. They might 
also be marked as public or private. For example: 

static String usersName; 

public static int numberOf Players ; 

private static double velocity, time; 

A static member variable that is not declared to be private can be accessed from outside 
the class where it is defined, as well as inside. When it is used in some other class, it must be 
referred to with a compound identifier of the form (class-name) .(variable-name) . For example, 
the System class contains the public static member variable named out, and you use this 
variable in your own classes by referring to System, out. Similarly, Math. PI is a public member 
variable in the Math whose value is the mathematical constant it. If numberOf Players is a 
public static member variable in a class named Poker, then subroutines in the Poker class 
would refer to it simply as numberOf Players, while subroutines in another class would refer to 
it as Poker .numberOf Players. 

As an example, let's add a static member variable to the GuessingGame class that we wrote 
earlier in this section. This variable will be used to keep track of how many games the user wins. 
We'll call the variable gamesWon and declare it with the statement "static int gamesWon;". 
In the playGameO routine, we add 1 to gamesWon if the user wins the game. At the end of the 
main() routine, we print out the value of gamesWon. It would be impossible to do the same 
thing with a local variable, since we need access to the same variable from both subroutines. 

When you declare a local variable in a subroutine, you have to assign a value to that variable 
before you can do anything with it. Member variables, on the other hand are automatically 
initialized with a default value. For numeric variables, the default value is zero. For boolean 
variables, the default is false. And for char variables, it's the unprintable character that has 
Unicode code number zero. (For objects, such as Strings, the default initial value is a special 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



128 



value called null, which we won't encounter officially until later.) 

Since it is of type int, the static member variable gamesWon automatically gets assigned an 
initial value of zero. This happens to be the correct initial value for a variable that is being 
used as a counter. You can, of course, assign a different value to the variable at the beginning 
of the main() routine if you are not satisfied with the default initial value. 

Here's a revised version of GuessingGame. java that includes the gamesWon variable. The 
changes from the above version are shown in italic: 

public class GuessingGame2 { 

static int gamesWon; // The number of games won by 

// the user. 

public static void main (String [] args) { 

gamesWon = 0; // This is actually redundant, since is 

// the default initial value. 

TextIO .putlnC'Let ' s play a game. I'll pick a number between"); 
TextlO.putlnC'l and 100, and you try to guess it."); 
boolean play Again; 
do { 

playGameO; // call subroutine to play one game 

TextIO. put ("Would you like to play again? "); 

playAgain = TextIO .getlnBooleanO ; 
} while (playAgain) ; 
TextIO. put ln() ; 

TextIO. putln( "You won " + gamesWon + " games."); 
TextIO .put In ("Thanks for playing. Goodbye."); 
} // end of mainO 

static void playGameO { 

int computersNumber ; // A random number picked by the computer. 

int usersGuess; //A number entered by user as a guess. 

int guessCount; // Number of guesses the user has made. 

computersNumber = (int) (100 * Math.randomO) + 1; 

// The value assigned to computersNumber is a randomly 
// chosen integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. 

guessCount = 0; 

Text 10. put In ; 

Text 10. put ("What is your first guess? "); 
while (true) { 

usersGuess = TextIO . getlnt () ; // Get the user's guess. 

guessCount++; 

if (usersGuess == computersNumber) { 

Text 10. put In ("You got it in " + guessCount 

+ " guesses! My number was " + computersNumber); 
gamesWon++ ; // Count this game by incrementing gamesWon. 
break; // The game is over; the user has won. 

} 

if (guessCount == 6) { 

Text 10. put In ("You didn't get the number in 6 guesses."); 
Text 10. put In ("You lose. My number was " + computersNumber); 
break; // The game is over; the user has lost. 

} 

// If we get to this point, the game continues.

// Tell the user if the guess was too high or too low. 
if (usersGuess < computersNumber) 

TextlD. put ("That's too low. Try again: ");

} // end of class GuessingGame2 



4.3 Parameters 

If A SUBROUTINE IS A BLACK BOX, then a parameter is something that provides a mechanism (online) 
for passing information from the outside world into the box. Parameters are part of the interface 
of a subroutine. They allow you to customize the behavior of a subroutine to adapt it to a 
particular situation. 

As an analogy, consider a thermostat — a black box whose task it is to keep your house 
at a certain temperature. The thermostat has a parameter, namely the dial that is used to 
set the desired temperature. The thermostat always performs the same task: maintaining a 
constant temperature. However, the exact task that it performs — that is, which temperature 
it maintains — is customized by the setting on its dial. 



4.3.1 Using Parameters 

As an example, let's go back to the "3N+1" problem that was discussed in Subsection 3.2.2. 
(Recall that a 3N+1 sequence is computed according to the rule, "if N is odd, multiply it by 
3 and add 1; if N is even, divide it by 2; continue until N is equal to 1." For example, starting 
from N=3 we get the sequence: 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.) Suppose that we want to write a 
subroutine to print out such sequences. The subroutine will always perform the same task: 
Print out a 3N+1 sequence. But the exact sequence it prints out depends on the starting value 
of N. So, the starting value of N would be a parameter to the subroutine. The subroutine could 
be written like this: 

/** 

* This subroutine prints a 3N+1 sequence to standard output, using 

* startingValue as the initial value of N. It also prints the number 

* of terms in the sequence. The value of the parameter, startingValue, 

* must be a positive integer. 
*/ 

static void print3NSequence (int startingValue) { 

int N; // One of the terms in the sequence, 

int count ; // The number of terms . 

N = startingValue; // The first term is whatever value 
// is passed to the subroutine as 
// a parameter. 

count =1; //We have one term, the starting value, so far. 

System. out .println( "The 3N+1 sequence starting from " + N) ; 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



130 



System. out .printlnO ; 

System. out .println(N) ; // print initial term of sequence 

while (N > 1) { 

if (N % 2 == 1) // is N odd? 

N = 3 * N + 1; 
else 

N = N / 2; 
count ++; // count this term 
System. out .println(N) ; // print this term 

} 

System. out .printlnO ; 

System. out .println( "There were " + count + " terms in the sequence."); 

} // end print3NSequence 

The parameter list of this subroutine, "(int startingValue)", specifies that the subroutine 
has one parameter, of type int. Within the body of the subroutine, the parameter name can 
be used in the same way as a variable name. However, the parameter gets its initial value 
from outside the subroutine. When the subroutine is called, a value must be provided for 
this parameter in the subroutine call statement. This value will be assigned to the parameter 
startingValue before the body of the subroutine is executed. For example, the subroutine 
could be called using the subroutine call statement "print3NSequence(17) ;". When the com- 
puter executes this statement, the computer first assigns the value 17 to startingValue and 
then executes the statements in the subroutine. This prints the 3N+1 sequence starting from 
17. If K is a variable of type int, then when the computer executes the subroutine call state- 
ment "print3NSequence (K) ; " , it will take the value of the variable K, assign that value to 
startingValue, and execute the body of the subroutine. 

The class that contains print3NSequence can contain a main() routine (or other subrou- 
tines) that call print3NSequence. For example, here is amain() program that prints out 3N+1 
sequences for various starting values specified by the user: 

public static void main(String [] args) { 

System. out .println( "This program will print out 3N+1 sequences"); 
System. out .printlnC'f or starting values that you specify."); 
System. out .printlnO ; 

int K; // Input from user; loop ends when K < 0. 
do { 

System. out .printlnC'Enter a starting value."); 
System. out .print ("To end the program, enter 0: "); 
K = TextIO . getlnt () ; // Get starting value from user, 
if (K > 0) // Print sequence, but only if K is > 0. 
print3NSequence (K) ; 
> while (K > 0) ; // Continue only if K > 0. 
} // end main 

Remember that before you can use this program, the definitions of main and of 
print3NSequence must both be wrapped inside a class definition. 

4.3.2 Formal and Actual Parameters 

Note that the term "parameter" is used to refer to two different, but related, concepts. There 
are parameters that are used in the definitions of subroutines, such as startingValue in the 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



131 



above example. And there are parameters that are used in subroutine call statements, such 
as the K in the statement "print3NSequence (K) ;". Parameters in a subroutine definition are 
called formal parameters or dummy parameters. The parameters that are passed to a 
subroutine when it is called are called actual parameters or arguments. When a subroutine 
is called, the actual parameters in the subroutine call statement are evaluated and the values 
are assigned to the formal parameters in the subroutine's definition. Then the body of the 
subroutine is executed. 

A formal parameter must be a name, that is, a simple identifier. A formal parameter is 
very much like a variable, and — like a variable — it has a specified type such as int, boolean, or 
String. An actual parameter is a value, and so it can be specified by any expression, provided 
that the expression computes a value of the correct type. The type of the actual parameter must 
be one that could legally be assigned to the formal parameter with an assignment statement. 
For example, if the formal parameter is of type double, then it would be legal to pass an int as 
the actual parameter since ints can legally be assigned to doubles. When you call a subroutine, 
you must provide one actual parameter for each formal parameter in the subroutine's definition. 
Consider, for example, a subroutine 

static void doTask(int N, double x, boolean test) { 
// statements to perform the task go here 

} 

This subroutine might be called with the statement 
doTask(17, Math. sqrt(z+l) , z >= 10); 

When the computer executes this statement, it has essentially the same effect as the block of 
statements: 

{ 

int N; // Allocate memory locations for the formal parameters, 

double x; 
boolean test; 

N = 17; // Assign 17 to the first formal parameter, N. 

x = Math. sqrt(z+l) ; // Compute Math.sqrt(z+1) , and assign it to 

// the second formal parameter, x. 
test = (z >= 10); // Evaluate "z >= 10" and assign the resulting 

// true/false value to the third formal 

// parameter, test. 
// statements to perform the task go here 

} 

(There are a few technical differences between this and "doTask(17,Math.sqrt(z+l) ,z>=10) ;" 
— besides the amount of typing — because of questions about scope of variables and what hap- 
pens when several variables or parameters have the same name.) 

Beginning programming students often find parameters to be surprisingly confusing. Call- 
ing a subroutine that already exists is not a problem — the idea of providing information to the 
subroutine in a parameter is clear enough. Writing the subroutine definition is another matter. 
A common beginner's mistake is to assign values to the formal parameters at the beginning of 
the subroutine, or to ask the user to input their values. This represents a fundamental mis- 
understanding. When the statements in the subroutine are executed, the formal parameters 
have already been assigned initial values! The values come from the subroutine call statement. 
Remember that a subroutine is not independent. It is called by some other routine, and it is 
the calling routine's responsibility to provide appropriate values for the parameters. 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



132 



4.3.3 Overloading 

In order to call a subroutine legally, you need to know its name, you need to know how many 
formal parameters it has, and you need to know the type of each parameter. This information is 
called the subroutine's signature. The signature of the subroutine doTask, used as an example 
above, can be expressed as: doTask ( int , double, boolean). Note that the signature does not 
include the names of the parameters; in fact, if you just want to use the subroutine, you don't 
even need to know what the formal parameter names are, so the names are not part of the 
interface. 

Java is somewhat unusual in that it allows two different subroutines in the same class to 
have the same name, provided that their signatures are different. (The language C++ on 
which Java is based also has this feature.) When this happens, we say that the name of the 
subroutine is overloaded because it has several different meanings. The computer doesn't get 
the subroutines mixed up. It can tell which one you want to call by the number and types 
of the actual parameters that you provide in the subroutine call statement. You have already 
seen overloading used with System. out. This object includes many different methods named 
println, for example. These methods all have different signatures, such as: 

println(int) println(double) 
println (String) println (char) 

println (boolean) printlnO 

The computer knows which of these subroutines you want to use based on the type of the 
actual parameter that you provide. System, out .print In (17) calls the subroutine with signa- 
ture println ( int ) , while System, out .println ("Hello") calls the subroutine with signature 
println (String) . Of course all these different subroutines are semantically related, which is 
why it is acceptable programming style to use the same name for them all. But as far as the 
computer is concerned, printing out an int is very different from printing out a String, which is 
different from printing out a boolean, and so forth — so that each of these operations requires 
a different method. 

Note, by the way, that the signature does not include the subroutine's return type. It is 
illegal to have two subroutines in the same class that have the same signature but that have 
different return types. For example, it would be a syntax error for a class to contain two 
methods defined as: 

int getlnO { . . . } 
double getlnO { . . . } 

So it should be no surprise that in the Text 10 class, the methods for reading different types 
are not all named getlnO. In a given class, there can only be one routine that has the name 
getln and has no parameters. So, the input routines in TextIO are distinguished by having 
different names, such as getlnlntO and getlnDouble () . 

Java 5.0 introduced another complication: It is possible to have a single subroutine that 
takes a variable number of actual parameters. You have already used subroutines that do 
this — the formatted output routines System. out .printf and TextIO. putf. When you call 
these subroutines, the number of parameters in the subroutine call can be arbitrarily large, so 
it would be impossible to have different subroutines to handle each case. Unfortunately, writing 
the definition of such a subroutine requires some knowledge of arrays, which will not be covered 
until Chapter 7. When we get to that chapter, you'll learn how to write subroutines with a 
variable number of parameters. For now, we will ignore this complication. 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



133 



4.3.4 Subroutine Examples 

Let's do a few examples of writing small subroutines to perform assigned tasks. Of course, 
this is only one side of programming with subroutines. The task performed by a subroutine is 
always a subtask in a larger program. The art of designing those programs — of deciding how to 
break them up into subtasks — is the other side of programming with subroutines. We'll return 
to the question of program design in Section 4.6. 

As a first example, let's write a subroutine to compute and print out all the divisors of a 
given positive integer. The integer will be a parameter to the subroutine. Remember that the 
syntax of any subroutine is: 

(modifiers) (return-type) (subroutine-name) ( (parameter-list) ) { 
(statements ) 

y 

Writing a subroutine always means filling out this format. In this case, the statement of the 
problem tells us that there is one parameter, of type int, and it tells us what the statements 
in the body of the subroutine should do. Since we are only working with static subroutines 
for now, we'll need to use static as a modifier. We could add an access modifier (public or 
private), but in the absence of any instructions, I'll leave it out. Since we are not told to 
return a value, the return type is void. Since no names are specified, we'll have to make up 
names for the formal parameter and for the subroutine itself. I'll use N for the parameter and 
printDivisors for the subroutine name. The subroutine will look like 

static void printDivisors ( int N ) { 
(statements ) 

} 

and all we have left to do is to write the statements that make up the body of the routine. This 
is not difficult. Just remember that you have to write the body assuming that N already has 
a value! The algorithm is: "For each possible divisor D in the range from 1 to N, if D evenly 
divides N, then print D." Written in Java, this becomes: 

/** 

* Print all the divisors of N. 

* We assume that N is a positive integer. 
*/ 

static void printDivisors ( int N ) { 

int D; // One of the possible divisors of N. 
System. out .println( "The divisors of " + N + " are:"); 
for ( D = 1; D <= N; D++ ) { 

if ( N X D = ) // Dose D evenly divide N? 
System. out .println(D) ; 

} 

} 

I've added a comment before the subroutine definition indicating the contract of the 
subroutine — that is, what it does and what assumptions it makes. The contract includes the 
assumption that N is a positive integer. It is up to the caller of the subroutine to make sure 
that this assumption is satisfied. 

As a second short example, consider the problem: Write a subroutine named printRow. It 
should have a parameter ch of type char and a parameter N of type int. The subroutine should 
print out a line of text containing N copies of the character ch. 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



134 



Here, we are told the name of the subroutine and the names of the two parameters, so we 
don't have much choice about the first line of the subroutine definition. The task in this case is 
pretty simple, so the body of the subroutine is easy to write. The complete subroutine is given 
by 

/** 

* Write one line of output containing N copies of the 

* character ch. If N <= 0, an empty line is output. 
*/ 

static void printRow( char ch, int N ) { 

int i; // Loop-control variable for counting off the copies, 
for ( i = 1; i <= N; i++ ) { 
System. out .print ( ch ); 

} 

System, out .printlnO ; 

} 

Note that in this case, the contract makes no assumption about N, but it makes it clear what 
will happen in all cases, including the unexpected case that N < 0. 

Finally, let's do an example that shows how one subroutine can build on another. Let's write 
a subroutine that takes a String as a parameter. For each character in the string, it should 
print a line of output containing 25 copies of that character. It should use the printRowO 
subroutine to produce the output. 

Again, we get to choose a name for the subroutine and a name for the parameter. I'll call 
the subroutine printRowsFromString and the parameter str. The algorithm is pretty clear: 
For each position i in the string str, call printRow(str . charAt (i) ,25) to print one line of 
the output. So, we get: 

/** 

* For each character in str, write a line of output 

* containing 25 copies of that character. 
*/ 

static void printRowsFromString ( String str ) { 

int i; // Loop-control variable for counting off the chars, 
for ( i = 0; i < str . length () ; i++ ) { 
printRow( str . charAt (i) , 25 ); 

> 

} 

We could use printRowsFromString in a mainO routine such as 

public static void main (String [] args) { 

String inputLine; // Line of text input by user. 
Text ID. put ("Enter a line of text: "); 
inputLine = TextIO . getlnO ; 
TextlO.putlnO ; 

printRowsFromString ( inputLine ); 

} 

Of course, the three routines, main(), printRowsFromString () , and printRowO, would 
have to be collected together inside the same class. The program is rather useless, but it does 
demonstrate the use of subroutines. You'll find the program in the file RowsOfChars.java, if 
you want to take a look. 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



135 



4.3.5 Throwing Exceptions 

I have been talking about the "contract" of a subroutine. The contract says what the subroutine 
will do, provided that the caller of the subroutine provides acceptable values for subroutine's 
parameters. The question arises, though, what should the subroutine do when the caller violates 
the contract by providing bad parameter values? 

We've already seen that some subroutines respond to bad parameter values by throw- 
ing exceptions. (See Section 3.7.) For example, the contract of the built-in subroutine 
Double .parseDouble says that the parameter should be a string representation of a num- 
ber of type double; if this is true, then the subroutine will convert the string into the equivalent 
numeric value. If the caller violates the contract by passing an invalid string as the actual 
parameter, the subroutine responds by throwing an exception of type NumberFormatException. 

Many subroutines throw HlegalArgumentExceptions in response to bad parameter values. 
You might want to take this response in your own subroutines. This can be done with a throw 
statement. An exception is an object, and in order to throw an exception, you must create 
an exception object. You won't officially learn how to do this until Chapter 5, but for now, you 
can use the following syntax for a throw statement that throws an HlegalArgumentException: 

throw new HlegalArgumentException ( (error-message) ); 

where (error-message) is a string that describes the error that has been detected. (The word 
"new" in this statement is what creates the object.) To use this statement in a subroutine, 
you would check whether the values of the parameters are legal. If not, you would throw the 
exception. For example, consider the print3NSequence subroutine from the beginning of this 
section. The parameter of print3NSequence is supposed to be a positive integer. We can 
modify the subroutine definition to make it throw an exception when this condition is violated: 

static void print3NSequence (int startingValue) { 

if (startingValue <= 0) // The contract is violated! 

throw new IllegalArgumentException( "Starting value must be positive. " ); 

// (The rest of the subroutine is the same as before.) 

If the start value is bad, the computer executes the throw statement. This will immediately 
terminate the subroutine, without executing the rest of the body of the subroutine. Further- 
more, the program as a whole will crash unless the exception is "caught" and handled elsewhere 
in the program by a try. . catch statement, as discussed in Section 3.7. 

4.3.6 Global and Local Variables 

I'll finish this section on parameters by noting that we now have three different sorts of vari- 
ables that can be used inside a subroutine: local variables declared in the subroutine, formal 
parameter names, and static member variables that are declared outside the subroutine but 
inside the same class as the subroutine. 

Local variables have no connection to the outside world; they are purely part of the internal 
working of the subroutine. Parameters are used to "drop" values into the subroutine when it 
is called, but once the subroutine starts executing, parameters act much like local variables. 
Changes made inside a subroutine to a formal parameter have no effect on the rest of the 
program (at least if the type of the parameter is one of the primitive types — things are more 
complicated in the case of objects, as we'll see later). 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



136 



Things are different when a subroutine uses a variable that is defined outside the subroutine. 
That variable exists independently of the subroutine, and it is accessible to other parts of the 
program, as well as to the subroutine. Such a variable is said to be global to the subroutine, 
as opposed to the local variables defined inside the subroutine. The scope of a global variable 
includes the entire class in which it is defined. Changes made to a global variable can have effects 
that extend outside the subroutine where the changes are made. You've seen how this works 
in the last example in the previous section, where the value of the global variable, gamesWon, 
is computed inside a subroutine and is used in the main() routine. 

It's not always bad to use global variables in subroutines, but you should realize that the 
global variable then has to be considered part of the subroutine's interface. The subroutine 
uses the global variable to communicate with the rest of the program. This is a kind of sneaky, 
back-door communication that is less visible than communication done through parameters, 
and it risks violating the rule that the interface of a black box should be straightforward and 
easy to understand. So before you use a global variable in a subroutine, you should consider 
whether it's really necessary. 

I don't advise you to take an absolute stand against using global variables inside subroutines. 
There is at least one good reason to do it: If you think of the class as a whole as being a kind 
of black box, it can be very reasonable to let the subroutines inside that box be a little sneaky 
about communicating with each other, if that will make the class as a whole look simpler from 
the outside. 

4.4 Return Values 

A SUBROUTINE THAT RETURNS A VALUE is called a function. A given function can only (online) 
return a value of a specified type, called the return type of the function. A function call 
generally occurs in a position where the computer is expecting to find a value, such as the right 
side of an assignment statement, as an actual parameter in a subroutine call, or in the middle 
of some larger expression. A boolean-valued function can even be used as the test condition in 
an if, while, for or do. .while statement. 

(It is also legal to use a function call as a stand-alone statement, just as if it were a 
regular subroutine. In this case, the computer ignores the value computed by the subrou- 
tine. Sometimes this makes sense. For example, the function TextlO.getlnO, with a return 
type of String, reads and returns a line of input typed in by the user. Usually, the line that 
is returned is assigned to a variable to be used later in the program, as in the statement 
"name = TextlO.getlnO ;"• However, this function is also useful as a subroutine call state- 
ment "TextlO.getlnO ;", which still reads all input up to and including the next carriage 
return. Since the return value is not assigned to a variable or used in an expression, it is simply 
discarded. So, the effect of the subroutine call is to read and discard some input. Sometimes, 
discarding unwanted input is exactly what you need to do.) 

4.4.1 The return statement 

You've already seen how functions such as Math.sqrtO and TextIO . getlnt () can be used. 
What you haven't seen is how to write functions of your own. A function takes the same form 
as a regular subroutine, except that you have to specify the value that is to be returned by the 
subroutine. This is done with a return statement, which has the following syntax: 

return (expression) ; 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



137 



Such a return statement can only occur inside the definition of a function, and the type 
of the (expression) must match the return type that was specified for the function. (More 
exactly, it must be legal to assign the expression to a variable whose type is specified by the 
return type.) When the computer executes this return statement, it evaluates the expression, 
terminates execution of the function, and uses the value of the expression as the returned value 
of the function. 

For example, consider the function definition 

static double pythagoras (double x, double y) { 

// Computes the length of the hypotenuse of a right 
// triangle, where the sides of the triangle are x and y. 
return Math.sqrt( x*x + y*y ); 

} 

Suppose the computer executes the statement "totalLength = 17 + pythagoras (12,5) ;". 
When it gets to the term pythagoras (12, 5), it assigns the actual parameters 12 and 5 to 
the formal parameters x and y in the function. In the body of the function, it evaluates 
Math . sqrt ( 12 . 0*12 . + 5 . 0*5 . 0) , which works out to 13 . 0. This value is "returned" by the 
function, so the 13.0 essentially replaces the function call in the assignment statement, which 
then has the same effect as the statement "totalLength = 17+13.0" . The return value is 
added to 17, and the result, 30.0, is stored in the variable, totalLength. 

Note that a return statement does not have to be the last statement in the function 
definition. At any point in the function where you know the value that you want to return, you 
can return it. Returning a value will end the function immediately, skipping any subsequent 
statements in the function. However, it must be the case that the function definitely does return 
some value, no matter what path the execution of the function takes through the code. 

You can use a return statement inside an ordinary subroutine, one with declared return 
type "void". Since a void subroutine does not return a value, the return statement does not 
include an expression; it simply takes the form "return ; " . The effect of this statement is to 
terminate execution of the subroutine and return control back to the point in the program from 
which the subroutine was called. This can be convenient if you want to terminate execution 
somewhere in the middle of the subroutine, but return statements are optional in non- function 
subroutines. In a function, on the other hand, a return statement, with expression, is always 
required. 

4.4.2 Function Examples 

Here is a very simple function that could be used in a program to compute 3N+1 sequences. 
(The 3N+1 sequence problem is one we've looked at several times already, including in the 
previous section.) Given one term in a 3N+1 sequence, this function computes the next term 
of the sequence: 

static int nextN(int currentN) { 

if (currentN °/ 2 == 1) // test if current N is odd 

return 3*currentN +1; // if so, return this value 
else 

return currentN / 2; //if not, return this instead 

} 

This function has two return statements. Exactly one of the two return statements is executed 
to give the value of the function. Some people prefer to use a single return statement at the 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



138 



very end of the function when possible. This allows the reader to find the return statement 
easily. You might choose to write nextNQ like this, for example: 

static int nextN(int currentN) { 

int answer; // answer will be the value returned 

if (currentN 7„ 2 == 1) // test if current N is odd 

answer = 3*currentN+l ; // if so, this is the answer 
else 

answer = currentN / 2; // if not, this is the answer 
return answer; // (Don't forget to return the answer!) 

} 

Here is a subroutine that uses this nextN function. In this case, the improvement from the 
version of this subroutine in Section 4.3 is not great, but if nextN () were a long function that 
performed a complex computation, then it would make a lot of sense to hide that complexity 
inside a function: 

static void print3NSequence (int startingValue) { 

int N; // One of the terms in the sequence, 

int count; // The number of terms found. 

N = startingValue; // Start the sequence with startingValue. 
count = 1 ; 

System. out .println( "The 3N+1 sequence starting from " + N) ; 
System. out .printlnO ; 

System. out .println(N) ; // print initial term of sequence 
while (N > 1) { 

N = nextN ( N ) ; // Compute next term, using the function nextN. 
count ++; // Count this term. 

System. out .println(N) ; // Print this term. 

} 

System. out .printlnO ; 

System. out .println( "There were " + count + " terms in the sequence."); 

} 

* * * 

Here are a few more examples of functions. The first one computes a letter grade corre- 
sponding to a given numerical grade, on a typical grading scale: 

/** 

* Returns the letter grade corresponding to the numerical 

* grade that is passed to this function as a parameter. 
*/ 

static char letterGrade(int numGrade) { 
if (numGrade >= 90) 

return 'A'; // 90 or above gets an A 
else if (numGrade >= 80) 

return 'B'; // 80 to 89 gets a B 
else if (numGrade >= 65) 

return 'C ; II 65 to 79 gets a C 
else if (numGrade >= 50) 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



139 



return 'D'; // 50 to 64 gets a D 
else 

return 'F'; // anything else gets an F 

} // end of function letterGrade 

The type of the return value of letterGrade () is char. Functions can return values of any 
type at all. Here's a function whose return value is of type boolean. It demonstrates some 
interesting programming points, so you should read the comments: 

/** 

* The function returns true if N is a prime number. A prime number 

* is an integer greater than 1 that is not divisible by any positive 

* integer, except itself and 1. If N has any divisor, D, in the range 

* 1 < D < N, then it has a divisor in the range 2 to Math. sqrt(N) , namely 

* either D itself or N/D. So we only test possible divisors from 2 to 

* Math.sqrt(N) . 
*/ 

static boolean isPrime(int N) { 

int divisor; // A number we will test to see whether it evenly divides N. 
if (N <= 1) 

return false; // No number <= 1 is a prime. 

int maxToTry; // The largest divisor that we need to test. 

maxToTry = (int)Math.sqrt(N) ; 

//We will try to divide N by numbers between 2 and maxToTry. 
// If N is not evenly divisible by any of these numbers, then 
// N is prime. (Note that since Math.sqrt(N) is defined to 
// return a value of type double, the value must be typecast 
// to type int before it can be assigned to maxToTry.) 

for (divisor = 2; divisor <= maxToTry; divisor++) { 

if ( N '/, divisor == ) // Test if divisor evenly divides N. 
return false; // If so, we know N is not prime. 

//No need to continue testing! 

> 

// If we get to this point, N must be prime. Otherwise, 
// the function would already have been terminated by 
// a return statement in the previous loop. 

return true; // Yes, N is prime. 

} // end of function isPrime 

Finally, here is a function with return type String. This function has a String as parameter. 
The returned value is a reversed copy of the parameter. For example, the reverse of "Hello 
World" is "dlroW olleH". The algorithm for computing the reverse of a string, str, is to 
start with an empty string and then to append each character from str, starting from the last 
character of str and working backwards to the first: 

static String reverse (String str) { 
String copy; // The reversed copy, 
int i; // One of the positions in str, 

// from str.lengthO - 1 down to 0. 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



140 



copy = ""; // Start with an empty string, 
for ( i = str. length () - 1; i >= 0; i— ) { 
// Append i-th char of str to copy, 
copy = copy + str.charAt(i) ; 

} 

return copy; 

} 

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards and forwards, such as "radar" . The 
reverse () function could be used to check whether a string, word, is a palindrome by testing 
"if (word . equals (reverse (word) ) ) " . 

By the way, a typical beginner's error in writing functions is to print out the answer, instead 
of returning it. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding. The task of a function 
is to compute a value and return it to the point in the program where the function was called. 
That's where the value is used. Maybe it will be printed out. Maybe it will be assigned to a 
variable. Maybe it will be used in an expression. But it's not for the function to decide. 

4.4.3 3N+1 Revisited 

I'll finish this section with a complete new version of the 3N+1 program. This will give me a 
chance to show the function nextNO, which was defined above, used in a complete program. 
I'll also take the opportunity to improve the program by getting it to print the terms of the 
sequence in columns, with five terms on each line. This will make the output more presentable. 
The idea is this: Keep track of how many terms have been printed on the current line; when 
that number gets up to 5, start a new line of output. To make the terms line up into neat 
columns, I use formatted output. 

/** 

* A program that computes and displays several 3N+1 sequences. Starting 

* values for the sequences are input by the user. Terms in the sequence 

* are printed in columns, with five terms on each line of output. 

* After a sequence has been displayed, the number of terms in that 

* sequence is reported to the user. 
*/ 

public class ThreeN2 { 

public static void main(String[] args) { 

TextlO.putlnC'This program will print out 3N+1 sequences"); 
TextlO.putlnC'for starting values that you specify."); 
TextlO.putlnO ; 

int K; // Starting point for sequence, specified by the user, 
do { 

TextlO.putlnO'Enter a starting value;"); 
TextlO.putO'To end the program, enter 0: "); 
K = TextlO.getlntO ; // get starting value from user 
if (K > 0) // print sequence, but only if K is > 

print3NSequence (K) ; 
} while (K > 0) ; // continue only if K > 

} // end main 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



/**

* startingValue as the initial value of N. It also prints the number

*/ 

static void print3NSequence (int startingValue) {

if (currentN 7„ 2 == 1) 

return 3 * currentN + 1 ; 
else 

return currentN / 2 ;

You should read this program carefully and try to understand how it works. (Try using 27 
the starting value!)

4.5 APIs, Packages, and Javadoc 

As computers and their user interfaces have become easier to use, they have also (online) 
become more complex for programmers to deal with. You can write programs for a simple 
console-style user interface using just a few subroutines that write output to the console and 
read the user's typed replies. A modern graphical user interface, with windows, buttons, scroll 
bars, menus, text-input boxes, and so on, might make things easier for the user, but it forces 
the programmer to cope with a hugely expanded array of possibilities. The programmer sees 
this increased complexity in the form of great numbers of subroutines that are provided for 
managing the user interface, as well as for other purposes. 

4.5.1 Toolboxes 

Someone who wanted to program for Macintosh computers — and to produce programs that 
look and behave the way users expect them to — had to deal with the Macintosh Toolbox, a 
collection of well over a thousand different subroutines. There are routines for opening and 
closing windows, for drawing geometric figures and text to windows, for adding buttons to 
windows, and for responding to mouse clicks on the window. There are other routines for 
creating menus and for reacting to user selections from menus. Aside from the user interface, 
there are routines for opening files and reading data from them, for communicating over a 
network, for sending output to a printer, for handling communication between programs, and 
in general for doing all the standard things that a computer has to do. Microsoft Windows 
provides its own set of subroutines for programmers to use, and they are quite a bit different 
from the subroutines used on the Mac. Linux has several different GUI toolboxes for the 
programmer to choose from. 

The analogy of a "toolbox" is a good one to keep in mind. Every programming project 
involves a mixture of innovation and reuse of existing tools. A programmer is given a set of 
tools to work with, starting with the set of basic tools that are built into the language: things 
like variables, assignment statements, if statements, and loops. To these, the programmer can 
add existing toolboxes full of routines that have already been written for performing certain 
tasks. These tools, if they are well-designed, can be used as true black boxes: They can be called 
to perform their assigned tasks without worrying about the particular steps they go through to 
accomplish those tasks. The innovative part of programming is to take all these tools and apply 
them to some particular project or problem (word-processing, keeping track of bank accounts, 
processing image data from a space probe, Web browsing, computer games, . . . ). This is called 
applications programming . 

A software toolbox is a kind of black box, and it presents a certain interface to the program- 
mer. This interface is a specification of what routines are in the toolbox, what parameters they 
use, and what tasks they perform. This information constitutes the API, or Applications 
Programming Interface, associated with the toolbox. The Macintosh API is a specification 
of all the routines available in the Macintosh Toolbox. A company that makes some hard- 
ware device — say a card for connecting a computer to a network — might publish an API for 
that device consisting of a list of routines that programmers can call in order to communicate 
with and control the device. Scientists who write a set of routines for doing some kind of 
complex computation — such as solving "differential equations," say — would provide an API to 
allow others to use those routines without understanding the details of the computations they 
perform. 

* * * 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



143 



The Java programming language is supplemented by a large, standard API. You've seen 
part of this API already, in the form of mathematical subroutines such as Math.sqrtO, the 
String data type and its associated routines, and the System, out .print () routines. The 
standard Java API includes routines for working with graphical user interfaces, for network 
communication, for reading and writing files, and more. It's tempting to think of these routines 
as being built into the Java language, but they are technically subroutines that have been 
written and made available for use in Java programs. 

Java is platform-independent. That is, the same program can run on platforms as diverse as 
Mac OS, Windows, Linux, and others. The same Java API must work on all these platforms. 
But notice that it is the interface that is platform-independent; the implementation varies 
from one platform to another. A Java system on a particular computer includes implementations 
of all the standard API routines. A Java program includes only calls to those routines. When 
the Java interpreter executes a program and encounters a call to one of the standard routines, 
it will pull up and execute the implementation of that routine which is appropriate for the 
particular platform on which it is running. This is a very powerful idea. It means that you only 
need to learn one API to program for a wide variety of platforms. 

4.5.2 Java's Standard Packages 

Like all subroutines in Java, the routines in the standard API are grouped into classes. To 
provide larger-scale organization, classes in Java can be grouped into packages, which were 
introduced briefly in Subsection 2.6.4. You can have even higher levels of grouping, since 
packages can also contain other packages. In fact, the entire standard Java API is implemented 
in several packages. One of these, which is named "java", contains several non-GUI packages 
as well as the original AWT graphics user interface classes. Another package, "javax", was 
added in Java version 1.2 and contains the classes used by the Swing graphical user interface 
and other additions to the API. 

A package can contain both classes and other packages. A package that is contained in 
another package is sometimes called a "sub-package." Both the java package and the javax 
package contain sub-packages. One of the sub-packages of java, for example, is called "awt". 
Since awt is contained within j ava, its full name is actually j ava . awt . This package contains 
classes that represent GUI components such as buttons and menus in the AWT. AWT is the 
older of the two Java GUI toolboxes and is no longer widely used. However, j ava . awt also 
contains a number of classes that form the foundation for all GUI programming, such as the 
Graphics class which provides routines for drawing on the screen, the Color class which repre- 
sents colors, and the Font class which represents the fonts that are used to display characters 
on the screen. Since these classes are contained in the package java. awt, their full names 
are actually j ava . awt . Graphics, j ava . awt . Color, and j ava . awt . Font. (I hope that by now 
you've gotten the hang of how this naming thing works in Java.) Similarly, javax contains a 
sub-package named javax. swing, which includes such GUI classes as javax. swing. JButton, 
j avax . swing . JMenu, and javax. swing. JFrame. The GUI classes in javax. swing, together 
with the foundational classes in java. awt, are all part of the API that makes it possible to 
program graphical user interfaces in Java. 

The java package includes several other sub-packages, such as java. io, which provides fa- 
cilities for input /output, java.net, which deals with network communication, and java.util, 
which provides a variety of "utility" classes. The most basic package is called java.lang. This 
package contains fundamental classes such as String, Math, Integer, and Double. 

It might be helpful to look at a graphical representation of the levels of nesting in the

java package, its sub-packages, the classes in those sub-packages, and the subroutines in those 
classes. This is not a complete picture, since it shows only a very few of the many items in each 
element:

The official documentation for the standard Java 6 API lists 203 different packages, including 
sub-packages, and it lists 3793 classes in these packages. Many of these are rather obscure or 
very specialized, but you might want to browse through the documentation to see what is 
available. As I write this, the documentation for the complete API can be found at 

http : //download . oracle . com/ j avase/6/ docs/api/ 

Even an expert programmer won't be familiar with the entire API, or even a majority of it. In 
this book, you'll only encounter several dozen classes, and those will be sufficient for writing a 
wide variety of programs. 

4.5.3 Using Classes from Packages 

Let's say that you want to use the class java. awt . Color in a program that you are writing. 
Like any class, java. awt. Color is a type, which means that you can use it to declare variables 
and parameters and to specify the return type of a function. One way to do this is to use the 
full name of the class as the name of the type. For example, suppose that you want to declare 
a variable named rectColor of type java. awt . Color. You could say: 

java. awt .Color rectColor; 

This is just an ordinary variable declaration of the form " (type-name) {variable-name} ;" . Of 
course, using the full name of every class can get tiresome, so Java makes it possible to avoid 
using the full name of a class by importing the class. If you put 

import java. awt. Color; 

at the beginning of a Java source code file, then, in the rest of the file, you can abbreviate the 
full name java. awt. Color to just the simple name of the class, Color. Note that the import 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



145 



line comes at the start of a file and is not inside any class. Although it is sometimes referred 
to as a statement, it is more properly called an import directive since it is not a statement 
in the usual sense. The import directive "import java.awt. Color" would allow you to say 

Color rectColor; 

to declare the variable. Note that the only effect of the import directive is to allow you to use 
simple class names instead of full "package. class" names. You aren't really importing anything 
substantial; if you leave out the import directive, you can still access the class — you just have 
to use its full name. There is a shortcut for importing all the classes from a given package. You 
can import all the classes from j ava . awt by saying 

import j ava . awt . * ; 

The "*" is a wildcard that matches every class in the package. (However, it does not match 
sub-packages; you cannot import the entire contents of all the sub-packages of the j ava package 
by saying import java.*.) 

Some programmers think that using a wildcard in an import statement is bad style, since 
it can make a large number of class names available that you are not going to use and might 
not even know about. They think it is better to explicitly import each individual class that 
you want to use. In my own programming, I often use wildcards to import all the classes from 
the most relevant packages, and use individual imports when I am using just one or two classes 
from a given package. 

In fact, any Java program that uses a graphical user interface is likely to use many 
classes from the java.awt and javax. swing packages as well as from another package named 
j ava . awt . event , and I often begin such programs with 

import j ava . awt . * ; 
import j ava . awt . event . * ; 
import j avax . swing . * ; 

A program that works with networking might include the line "import java.net.*;", while 
one that reads or writes files might use "import java.io.*;". (But when you start importing 
lots of packages in this way, you have to be careful about one thing: It's possible for two classes 
that are in different packages to have the same name. For example, both the java. awt package 
and the java.util package contain classes named List. If you import both java.awt.* and 
java.util . *, the simple name List will be ambiguous. If you try to declare a variable of type 
List, you will get a compiler error message about an ambiguous class name. The solution is 
simple: Use the full name of the class, either java. awt .List or java.util. List. Another 
solution, of course, is to use import to import the individual classes you need, instead of 
importing entire packages.) 

Because the package java.lang is so fundamental, all the classes in java.lang are auto- 
matically imported into every program. It's as if every program began with the statement 
"import java.lang.*;". This is why we have been able to use the class name String instead 
of java. lang. String, and Math.sqrtO instead of java. lang. Math, sqrt () . It would still, 
however, be perfectly legal to use the longer forms of the names. 

Programmers can create new packages. Suppose that you want some classes that you are 
writing to be in a package named utilities. Then the source code file that defines those 
classes must begin with the line 

package utilities; 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



146 



This would come even before any import directive in that file. Furthermore, as mentioned in 
Subsection 2.6.4, the source code file would be placed in a folder with the same name as the 
package. A class that is in a package automatically has access to other classes in the same 
package; that is, a class doesn't have to import the package in which it is defined. 

In projects that define large numbers of classes, it makes sense to organize those classes 
into packages. It also makes sense for programmers to create new packages as toolboxes that 
provide functionality and APIs for dealing with areas not covered in the standard Java API. 
(And in fact such "toolmaking" programmers often have more prestige than the applications 
programmers who use their tools.) 

However, with just a couple of exceptions, I will not be creating packages in this textbook. 
For the purposes of this book, you need to know about packages mainly so that you will be able 
to import the standard packages. These packages are always available to the programs that 
you write. You might wonder where the standard classes are actually located. Again, that can 
depend to some extent on the version of Java that you are using, but in recent standard versions, 
they are stored in jar files in a subdirectory named lib inside the Java Runtime Environment 
installation directory. A jar (or "Java archive") file is a single file that can contain many classes. 
Most of the standard classes can be found in a jar file named rt . jar. In fact, Java programs 
are generally distributed in the form of jar files, instead of as individual class files. 

Although we won't be creating packages explicitly, every class is actually part of a package. 
If a class is not specifically placed in a package, then it is put in something called the default 
package, which has no name. Almost all the examples that you see in this book are in the 
default package. 

4.5.4 Javadoc 

To use an API effectively, you need good documentation for it. The documentation for most 
Java APIs is prepared using a system called Javadoc. For example, this system is used to 
prepare the documentation for Java's standard packages. And almost everyone who creates a 
toolbox in Java publishes Javadoc documentation for it. 

Javadoc documentation is prepared from special comments that are placed in the Java 
source code file. Recall that one type of Java comment begins with /* and ends with */. A 
Javadoc comment takes the same form, but it begins with /** rather than simply /*. You 
have already seen comments of this form in some of the examples in this book, such as this 
subroutine from Section 4.3: 

/** 

* This subroutine prints a 3N+1 sequence to standard output, using 

* startingValue as the initial value of N. It also prints the number 

* of terms in the sequence. The value of the parameter, startingValue, 

* must be a positive integer. 
*/ 

static void print3NSequence (int startingValue) { ... 

Note that the Javadoc comment must be placed just before the subroutine that it is com- 
menting on. This rule is always followed. You can have Javadoc comments for subroutines, for 
member variables, and for classes. The Javadoc comment always immediately precedes the 
thing it is commenting on. 

Like any comment, a Javadoc comment is ignored by the computer when the file is compiled. 
But there is a tool called javadoc that reads Java source code files, extracts any Javadoc 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



147 



comments that it finds, and creates a set of Web pages containing the comments in a nicely 
formatted, interlinked form. By default, javadoc will only collect information about public 
classes, subroutines, and member variables, but it allows the option of creating documentation 
for non-public things as well. If javadoc doesn't find any Javadoc comment for something, it 
will construct one, but the comment will contain only basic information such as the name and 
type of a member variable or the name, return type, and parameter list of a subroutine. This 
is syntactic information. To add information about semantics and pragmatics, you have to 
write a Javadoc comment. 

As an example, you can look at the documentation Web page for TextlO. The documentation 
page was created by applying the javadoc tool to the source code file, TextlO.java. If you 
have downloaded the on-line version of this book, the documentation can be found in the 
TextlCLJavadoc directory, or you can find a link to it in the on-line version of this section. 

In a Javadoc comment, the *'s at the start of each line are optional. The javadoc tool will 
remove them. In addition to normal text, the comment can contain certain special codes. For 
one thing, the comment can contain HTML mark-up commands. HTML is the language that 
is used to create web pages, and Javadoc comments are meant to be shown on web pages. The 
javadoc tool will copy any HTML commands in the comments to the web pages that it creates. 
You'll learn some basic HTML in Section 6.2, but as an example, you can add <p> to indicate 
the start of a new paragraph. (Generally, in the absence of HTML commands, blank lines and 
extra spaces in the comment are ignored. Furthermore, the characters & and < have special 
meaning in HTML and should not be used in Javadoc comments except with those meanings; 
they can be written as & and felt;.) 

In addition to HTML commands, Javadoc comments can include doc tags, which are 
processed as commands by the javadoc tool. A doc tag has a name that begins with the 
character @. I will only discuss three tags: Oparam, ©return, and ©throws. These tags are used 
in Javadoc comments for subroutines to provide information about its parameters, its return 
value, and the exceptions that it might throw. These tags must be placed at the end of the 
comment, after any description of the subroutine itself. The syntax for using them is: 

@param (parametei — name) (description-of -parameter) 

Sreturn (description-of -return-value) 

@throws (exception-class-name) (description-of -exception) 

The (descriptions) can extend over several lines. The description ends at the next doc tag or at 
the end of the comment. You can include a @param tag for every parameter of the subroutine 
and a ©throws for as many types of exception as you want to document. You should have 
a ©return tag only for a non-void subroutine. These tags do not have to be given in any 
particular order. 

Here is an example that doesn't do anything exciting but that does use all three types of 
doc tag: 

/** 

* This subroutine computes the area of a rectangle, given its width 

* and its height. The length and the width should be positive numbers. 

* Oparam width the length of one side of the rectangle 

* Oparam height the length the second side of the rectangle 

* Oreturn the area of the rectangle 

* Othrows IllegalArgumentException if either the width or the height 

* is a negative number. 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



148 



*/ 

public static double areaOf Rectangle ( double length, double width ) { 
if ( width < II height < ) 

throw new IllegalArgumentExceptionC "Sides must have positive length."); 
double area; 
area = width * height; 
return area; 

} 

I will use Javadoc comments for many of my examples. I encourage you to use them in your 
own code, even if you don't plan to generate Web page documentation of your work, since it's 
a standard format that other Java programmers will be familiar with. 

If you do want to create Web-page documentation, you need to run the javadoc tool. This 
tool is available as a command in the Java Development Kit that was discussed in Section 2.6. 
You can use javadoc in a command line interface similarly to the way that the javac and java 
commands are used. Javadoc can also be applied in the Eclipse integrated development environ- 
ment that was also discussed in Section 2.6: Just right-click the class, package, or entire project 
that you want to document in the Package Explorer, select "Export," and select "Javadoc" in 
the window that pops up. I won't go into any of the details here; see the documentation. 

4.6 More on Program Design 

Understanding how programs work is one thing. Designing a program to perform some (online) 
particular task is another thing altogether. In Section 3.2, I discussed how pseudocode and 
stepwise refinement can be used to methodically develop an algorithm. We can now see how 
subroutines can fit into the process. 

Stepwise refinement is inherently a top-down process, but the process does have a "bottom," 
that is, a point at which you stop refining the pseudocode algorithm and translate what you 
have directly into proper program code. In the absence of subroutines, the process would 
not bottom out until you get down to the level of assignment statements and very primitive 
input/output operations. But if you have subroutines lying around to perform certain useful 
tasks, you can stop refining as soon as you've managed to express your algorithm in terms of 
those tasks. 

This allows you to add a bottom-up element to the top-down approach of stepwise re- 
finement. Given a problem, you might start by writing some subroutines that perform tasks 
relevant to the problem domain. The subroutines become a toolbox of ready-made tools that 
you can integrate into your algorithm as you develop it. (Alternatively, you might be able to 
buy or find a software toolbox written by someone else, containing subroutines that you can 
use in your project as black boxes.) 

Subroutines can also be helpful even in a strict top-down approach. As you refine your 
algorithm, you are free at any point to take any sub-task in the algorithm and make it into a 
subroutine. Developing that subroutine then becomes a separate problem, which you can work 
on separately. Your main algorithm will merely call the subroutine. This, of course, is just 
a way of breaking your problem down into separate, smaller problems. It is still a top-down 
approach because the top-down analysis of the problem tells you what subroutines to write. 
In the bottom-up approach, you start by writing or obtaining subroutines that are relevant to 
the problem domain, and you build your solution to the problem on top of that foundation of 
subroutines. 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



149 



4.6.1 Preconditions and Postconditions 

When working with subroutines as building blocks, it is important to be clear about how a 
subroutine interacts with the rest of the program. This interaction is specified by the contract 
of the subroutine, as discussed in Section 4.1. A convenient way to express the contract of a 
subroutine is in terms of preconditions and postconditions . 

A precondition of a subroutine is something that must be true when the subroutine is called, 
if the subroutine is to work correctly. For example, for the built-in function Math.sqrt(x), a 
precondition is that the parameter, x, is greater than or equal to zero, since it is not possible 
to take the square root of a negative number. In terms of a contract, a precondition represents 
an obligation of the caller of the subroutine. If you call a subroutine without meeting its 
precondition, then there is no reason to expect it to work properly. The program might crash 
or give incorrect results, but you can only blame yourself, not the subroutine. 

A postcondition of a subroutine represents the other side of the contract. It is something 
that will be true after the subroutine has run (assuming that its preconditions were met — and 
that there are no bugs in the subroutine). The postcondition of the function Math.sqrtO is 
that the square of the value that is returned by this function is equal to the parameter that is 
provided when the subroutine is called. Of course, this will only be true if the precondition — 
that the parameter is greater than or equal to zero — is met. A postcondition of the built-in 
subroutine System . out . print (x) is that the value of the parameter has been displayed on the 
screen. 

Preconditions most often give restrictions on the acceptable values of parameters, as in the 
example of Math, sqrt (x) . However, they can also refer to global variables that are used in 
the subroutine. The postcondition of a subroutine specifies the task that it performs. For a 
function, the postcondition should specify the value that the function returns. 

Subroutines are sometimes described by comments that explicitly specify their preconditions 
and postconditions. When you are given a pre-written subroutine, a statement of its precon- 
ditions and postconditions tells you how to use it and what it does. When you are assigned 
to write a subroutine, the preconditions and postconditions give you an exact specification of 
what the subroutine is expected to do. I will use this approach in the example that constitutes 
the rest of this section. The comments are given in the form of Javadoc comments, but I will 
explicitly label the preconditions and postconditions. (Many computer scientists think that 
new doc tags ©precondition and ©postcondition should be added to the Javadoc system for 
explicit labeling of preconditions and postconditions, but that has not yet been done.) 

4.6.2 A Design Example 

Let's work through an example of program design using subroutines. In this example, we will 
use pre-written subroutines as building blocks and we will also design new subroutines that we 
need to complete the project. 

Suppose that I have found an already-written class called Mosaic. This class allows a 
program to work with a window that displays little colored rectangles arranged in rows and 
columns. The window can be opened, closed, and otherwise manipulated with static member 
subroutines defined in the Mosaic class. In fact, the class defines a toolbox or API that can be 
used for working with such windows. Here are some of the available routines in the API, with 
Javadoc-style comments: 

/** 

* Opens a "mosaic" window on the screen. 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



150 



* 

* Precondition: The parameters rows, cols, w, and h are positive integers. 

* Postcondition: A window is open on the screen that can display rows and 

* columns of colored rectangles. Each rectangle is w pixels 

* wide and h pixels high. The number of rows is given by 

* the first parameter and the number of columns by the 

* second. Initially, all rectangles are black. 



* Note: The rows are numbered from to rows - 1, and the columns are 

* numbered from to cols - 1. 
*/ 

public static void opendnt rows, int cols, int w, int h) 
/** 

* Sets the color of one of the rectangles in the window. 



* Precondition: row and col are in the valid range of row and column numbers, 

* and r, g, and b are in the range to 255, inclusive. 

* Postcondition: The color of the rectangle in row number row and column 

* number col has been set to the color specified by r, g, 

* and b. r gives the amount of red in the color with 

* representing no red and 255 representing the maximum 

* possible amount of red. The larger the value of r, the 

* more red in the color, g and b work similarly for the 

* green and blue color components . 
*/ 



public static void setColordnt row, int col, int r, int g, int b) 
/** 

* Gets the red component of the color of one of the rectangles. 
* 

* Precondition: row and col are in the valid range of row and column numbers. 

* Postcondition: The red component of the color of the specified rectangle is 

* returned as an integer in the range to 255 inclusive. 
*/ 

public static int getReddnt row, int col) 
/** 

* Like getRed, but returns the green component of the color. 
*/ 

public static int getGreendnt row, int col) 
/** 

* Like getRed, but returns the blue component of the color. 
*/ 

public static int getBluednt row, int col) 
/** 

* Tests whether the mosaic window is currently open. 
* 

* Precondition: None. 

* Postcondition: The return value is true if the window is open when this 

* function is called, and it is false if the window is 

* closed. 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



151 



*/ 

public static boolean isOpenO 
/** 

* Inserts a delay in the program (to regulate the speed at which the colors 

* are changed, for example) . 
* 

* Precondition: milliseconds is a positive integer. 

* Postcondition: The program has paused for at least the specified number 

* of milliseconds, where one second is equal to 1000 

* milliseconds. 
*/ 

public static void delay (int milliseconds) 

Remember that these subroutines are members of the Mosaic class, so when they are called 
from outside Mosaic, the name of the class must be included as part of the name of the routine. 
For example, we'll have to use the name Mosaic . isOpenO rather than simply isOpenO. 

You'll notice that the comments on the subroutine don't specify what happens when the 
preconditions are not met. Although a subroutine is not really obligated by its contract to 
do anything particular in that case, it would be good to know what happens. For example, 
if the precondition, "row and col are in the valid range of row and column numbers," on 
the setColorQ or getRedO routine is violated, an Illegal 'ArgumentException will be thrown. 
Knowing that fact would allow you to write programs that catch and handle the exception. 
Other questions remain about the behavior of the subroutines. For example, what happens if 
you call Mosaic . open () and there is already a mosaic window open on the screen? (In fact, 
the old one will be closed, and a new one will be created.) It's difficult to fully document the 
behavior of a piece of software — sometimes, you just have to experiment or look at the full 
source code. 

* * * 

My idea for a program is to use the Mosaic class as the basis for a neat animation. I want 
to fill the window with randomly colored squares, and then randomly change the colors in a 
loop that continues as long as the window is open. "Randomly change the colors" could mean 
a lot of different things, but after thinking for a while, I decide it would be interesting to have 
a "disturbance" that wanders randomly around the window, changing the color of each square 
that it encounters. Here's a picture showing what the contents of the window might look like 
at one point in time: 




With basic routines for manipulating the window as a foundation, I can turn to the specific 
problem at hand. A basic outline for my program is 

Open a Mosaic window 

Fill window with random colors; 

Move around, changing squares at random. 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



152 



Filling the window with random colors seems like a nice coherent task that I can work on 
separately, so let's decide to write a separate subroutine to do it. The third step can be 
expanded a bit more, into the steps: Start in the middle of the window, then keep moving 
to new squares and changing the color of those squares. This should continue as long as the 
mosaic window is still open. Thus we can refine the algorithm to: 

Open a Mosaic window 

Fill window with random colors; 

Set the current position to the middle square in the window; 
As long as the mosaic window is open: 

Randomly change color of the square at the current position; 

Move current position up, down, left, or right, at random; 

I need to represent the current position in some way. That can be done with two int variables 
named currentRow and currentColumn that hold the row number and the column number of 
the square where the disturbance is currently located. I'll use 10 rows and 20 columns of squares 
in my mosaic, so setting the current position to be in the center means setting currentRow to 5 
and currentColumn to 10. I already have a subroutine, Mosaic . open() , to open the window, 
and I have a function, Mosaic . isOpenO , to test whether the window is open. To keep the 
main routine simple, I decide that I will write two more subroutines of my own to carry out 
the two tasks in the while loop. The algorithm can then be written in Java as: 

Mosaic. open (10, 20, 15, 15) 
f illWithRandomColors () ; 

currentRow =5; // Middle row, halfway down the window. 

currentColumn =10; // Middle column, 
while ( Mosaic . isOpenO ) { 

changeToRandomColor (currentRow, currentColumn) ; 

randomMove () ; 

} 

With the proper wrapper, this is essentially the mainQ routine of my program. It turns out I 
have to make one small modification: To prevent the animation from running too fast, the line 
"Mosaic . delay (20) ;" is added to the while loop. 

The main() routine is taken care of, but to complete the program, I still have to write the 
subroutines f illWithRandomColors () , changeToRandomColor (int, int), and randomMove () . 
Writing each of these subroutines is a separate, small task. The f illWithRandomColors () 
routine is defined by the postcondition that "each of the rectangles in the mosaic has been 
changed to a random color." Pseudocode for an algorithm to accomplish this task can be given 
as: 

For each row: 

For each column: 

set the square in that row and column to a random color 

"For each row" and "for each column" can be implemented as for loops. We've already planned 
to write a subroutine changeToRandomColor that can be used to set the color. (The possi- 
bility of reusing subroutines in several places is one of the big payoffs of using them!) So, 
f illWithRandomColors () can be written in proper Java as: 

static void f illWithRandomColors () { 
for (int row = 0; row < 10; row++) 

for (int column = 0; column < 20; column++) 
changeToRandomColor (row, column) ; 

} 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



153 



Turning to the changeToRandomColor subroutine, we already have a method in the Mosaic 
class, Mosaic . setColor () , that can be used to change the color of a square. If we want a ran- 
dom color, we just have to choose random values for r, g, and b. According to the precondition 
of the Mosaic . setColor () subroutine, these random values must be integers in the range from 
to 255. A formula for randomly selecting such an integer is "(int) (256*Math. random ())". 
So the random color subroutine becomes: 

static void changeToRandomColor (int rowNum, int colNum) { 
int red = (int) (256*Math . randomO ) ; 
int green = (int) (256*Math.random()) ; 
int blue = (int) (256*Math.random()) ; 
mosaic . setColor (rowNum, colNum, red, green, blue) ; 

} 

Finally, consider the randomMove subroutine, which is supposed to randomly move the 
disturbance up, down, left, or right. To make a random choice among four directions, we 
can choose a random integer in the range to 3. If the integer is 0, move in one direction; 
if it is 1, move in another direction; and so on. The position of the disturbance is given 
by the variables currentRow and currentColumn. To "move up" means to subtract 1 from 
currentRow. This leaves open the question of what to do if currentRow becomes -1, which 
would put the disturbance above the window (which would violate the precondition of several of 
the Mosaic subroutines that the row and column numbers must be in the valid range). Rather 
than let this happen, I decide to move the disturbance to the opposite edge of the applet 
by setting currentRow to 9. (Remember that the 10 rows are numbered from to 9.) An 
alternative to jumping to the opposite edge would be to simply do nothing in this case. Moving 
the disturbance down, left, or right is handled similarly. If we use a switch statement to decide 
which direction to move, the code for randomMove becomes: 

int directionNum; 

directionNum = (int) (4*Math.random()) ; 
switch (directionNum) { 
case 0: // move up 
currentRow — ; 

if (currentRow < 0) // CurrentRow is outside the mosaic; 

currentRow =9; // move it to the opposite edge, 
break; 
case 1 : // move right 
currentColumn++ ; 
if (currentColumn >= 20) 

currentColumn = 0; 
break; 
case 2 : // move down 
currentRow++; 
if (currentRow >= 10) 

currentRow = ;

4.6.3 The Program 

Putting this all together, we get the following complete program. Note that I've added Javadoc- 
style comments for the class itself and for each of the subroutines. The variables currentRow 
and currentColumn are defined as static members of the class, rather than local variables, 
because each of them is used in several different subroutines. This program actually depends 
on two other classes, Mosaic and another class called MosaicCanvas that is used by Mosaic. 
If you want to compile and run this program, both of these classes must be available to the 
program.

* moves randomly around in the window, randomly changing the color of each 

* square that it visits. The program runs until the user closes the window.

4.7 The Truth About Declarations 

Names are fundamental to programming, as I said a few chapters ago. There are a lot (online) 

of details involved in declaring and using names. I have been avoiding some of those details. 

In this section, I'll reveal most of the truth (although still not the full truth) about declaring 

and using variables in Java. The material in the subsections "Initialization in Declarations" 

and "Named Constants" is particularly important, since I will be using it regularly in future 

chapters. 

4.7.1 Initialization in Declarations 

When a variable declaration is executed, memory is allocated for the variable. This memory 
must be initialized to contain some definite value before the variable can be used in an expres- 
sion. In the case of a local variable, the declaration is often followed closely by an assignment 
statement that does the initialization. For example, 

int count; // Declare a variable named count, 
count =0; // Give count its initial value. 

However, the truth about declaration statements is that it is legal to include the initializa- 
tion of the variable in the declaration statement. The two statements above can therefore be 
abbreviated as 

int count =0; // Declare count and give it an initial value. 

The computer still executes this statement in two steps: Declare the variable count, then assign 
the value to the newly created variable. The initial value does not have to be a constant. It 
can be any expression. It is legal to initialize several variables in one declaration statement. 
For example, 

char firstlnitial = 'D', secondlnitial = 'E' ; 

int x, y = 1; // DK, but only y has been initialized! 

int N = 3 , M = N+2; // OK, N is initialized 

// before its value is used. 

This feature is especially common in for loops, since it makes it possible to declare a loop control 
variable at the same point in the loop where it is initialized. Since the loop control variable 
generally has nothing to do with the rest of the program outside the loop, it's reasonable to 
have its declaration in the part of the program where it's actually used. For example: 

for ( int i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) { 
System. out .println(i) ; 

} 

Again, you should remember that this is simply an abbreviation for the following, where I've 
added an extra pair of braces to show that i is considered to be local to the for statement and 
no longer exists after the for loop ends: 

{ 

int i ; 

for ( i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) { 
System. out .println(i) ; 

} 

} 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



157 



(You might recall, by the way, that for "for-each" loops, the special type of for statement 
that is used with enumerated types, declaring the variable in the for is required. See Subsec- 
tion 3.4.4.) 

A member variable can also be initialized at the point where it is declared, just as for a 
local variable. For example: 

public class Bank { 

static double interestRate = 0.05; 
static int maxWithdrawal = 200; 

// More variables and subroutines. 

} 

A static member variable is created as soon as the class is loaded by the Java interpreter, and 
the initialization is also done at that time. In the case of member variables, this is not simply 
an abbreviation for a declaration followed by an assignment statement. Declaration statements 
are the only type of statement that can occur outside of a subroutine. Assignment statements 
cannot, so the following is illegal: 

public class Bank { 

static double interestRate; 
interestRate =0.05; // ILLEGAL: 

// Can't be outside a subroutine! : 



Because of this, declarations of member variables often include initial values. In fact, as 
mentioned in Subsection 4.2.4, if no initial value is provided for a member variable, then a 
default initial value is used. For example, when declaring an integer member variable, count, 
"static int count;" is equivalent to "static int count = 0;". 

4.7.2 Named Constants 

Sometimes, the value of a variable is not supposed to change after it is initialized. For example, 
in the above example where interestRate is initialized to the value 0.05, it's quite possible 
that 0.05 is meant to be the value throughout the entire program. In this case, the programmer 
is probably defining the variable, interestRate, to give a meaningful name to the otherwise 
meaningless number, 0.05. It's easier to understand what's going on when a program says 
"principal += principal*interestRate;" rather than "principal += principal*0.05;". 

In Java, the modifier "final" can be applied to a variable declaration to ensure that the 
value stored in the variable cannot be changed after the variable has been initialized. For 
example, if the member variable interestRate is declared with 

final static double interestRate = 0.05; 

then it would be impossible for the value of interestRate to change anywhere else in the 
program. Any assignment statement that tries to assign a value to interestRate will be 
rejected by the computer as a syntax error when the program is compiled. 

It is legal to apply the final modifier to local variables and even to formal parameters, 
but it is most useful for member variables. I will often refer to a static member variable that 
is declared to be final as a named constant, since its value remains constant for the whole 
time that the program is running. The readability of a program can be greatly enhanced by 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



158 



using named constants to give meaningful names to important quantities in the program. A 
recommended style rule for named constants is to give them names that consist entirely of 
upper case letters, with underscore characters to separate words if necessary. For example, the 
preferred style for the interest rate constant would be 

final static double INTEREST_RATE = 0.05; 

This is the style that is generally used in Java's standard classes, which define many named 
constants. For example, we have already seen that the Math class contains a variable Math. PI. 
This variable is declared in the Math class as a "public final static" variable of type double. 
Similarly, the Color class contains named constants such as Color. RED and Color. YELLOW 
which are public final static variables of type Color. Many named constants are created just to 
give meaningful names to be used as parameters in subroutine calls. For example, the standard 
class named Font contains named constants Font. PLAIN, Font. BOLD, and Font . ITALIC. These 
constants are used for specifying different styles of text when calling various subroutines in the 
Font class. 

Enumerated type constants (see Subsection 2.3.3) are also examples of named constants. 
The enumerated type definition 

enum Alignment { LEFT, RIGHT, CENTER > 

defines the constants Alignment . LEFT, Alignment . RIGHT, and Alignment . CENTER. Technically, 
Alignment is a class, and the three constants are public final static members of that class. 
Defining the enumerated type is similar to defining three constants of type, say, int: 

public static final int ALIGNMENT_LEFT = 0; 
public static final int ALIGNMNENT_RIGHT = 1; 
public static final int AL I GNMENT .CENTER = 2; 

In fact, this is how things were generally done before the introduction of enumerated types, 
and it is what is done with the constants Font . PLAIN, Font . BOLD, and Font . ITALIC mentioned 
above. Using the integer constants, you could define a variable of type int and assign it the 
values ALIGNMENTJLEFT, ALIGNMENT _RIGHT, or AL I GNMENT_CENTER to represent different types 
of alignment. The only problem with this is that the computer has no way of knowing that you 
intend the value of the variable to represent an alignment, and it will not raise any objection if 
the value that is assigned to the variable is not one of the three valid alignment values. 

With the enumerated type, on the other hand, the only values that can be assigned to 
a variable of type Alignment are the constant values that are listed in the definition of the 
enumerated type. Any attempt to assign an invalid value to the variable is a syntax error 
which the computer will detect when the program is compiled. This extra safety is one of the 
major advantages of enumerated types. 

* * * 

Curiously enough, one of the major reasons to use named constants is that it's easy to 
change the value of a named constant. Of course, the value can't change while the program 
is running. But between runs of the program, it's easy to change the value in the source code 
and recompile the program. Consider the interest rate example. It's quite possible that the 
value of the interest rate is used many times throughout the program. Suppose that the bank 
changes the interest rate and the program has to be modified. If the literal number 0.05 were 
used throughout the program, the programmer would have to track down each place where 
the interest rate is used in the program and change the rate to the new value. (This is made 
even harder by the fact that the number 0.05 might occur in the program with other meanings 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



159 



besides the interest rate, as well as by the fact that someone might have, say, used 0.025 to 
represent half the interest rate.) On the other hand, if the named constant INTEREST.RATE is 
declared and used consistently throughout the program, then only the single line where the 
constant is initialized needs to be changed. 

As an extended example, I will give a new version of the RandomMosaicWalk program from 
the previous section. This version uses named constants to represent the number of rows in 
the mosaic, the number of columns, and the size of each little square. The three constants are 
declared as final static member variables with the lines: 

final static int ROWS =30; // Number of rows in mosaic, 

final static int COLUMNS =30; // Number of columns in mosaic, 

final static int SQUARE_SIZE = 15; // Size of each square in mosaic. 

The rest of the program is carefully modified to use the named constants. For example, in 
the new version of the program, the Mosaic window is opened with the statement 

Mosaic. open (ROWS, COLUMNS, SQUARE_SIZE, SQUARE_SIZE) ; 

Sometimes, it's not easy to find all the places where a named constant needs to be used. If 
you don't use the named constant consistently, you've more or less defeated the purpose. It's 
always a good idea to run a program using several different values for any named constant, to 
test that it works properly in all cases. 

Here is the complete new program, RandomMosaicWalk2, with all modifications from the 
previous version shown in italic. I've left out some of the comments to save space. 

public class RandomMosaicWalk2 { 

final static int ROWS = 30; // Number of rows in mosaic, 

final static int COLUMNS = 30; // Number of columns in mosaic, 

final static int SQUARE_SIZE = 15; // Size of each square in mosaic. 

static int currentRow; // Row currently containing the disturbance, 
static int currentColumn; // Column currently containing the disturbance. 

public static void main(String [] args) { 

Mosaic. open( ROWS, COLUMNS, SQUARE.SIZE, SQUARE.SIZE ) ; 
f illWithRandomColorsQ ; 

currentRow = ROWS / 2; II start at center of window 
currentColumn = COLUMNS / 2; 
while (Mosaic . isOpenO ) { 

changeToRandomColor (currentRow, currentColumn) ; 

randomMove ( ) ; 

Mosaic. delay (20) ; 

} 

} // end main 

static void f illWithRandomColors () { 

for {int row=0; row < ROWS; row++) { 

for {int column=0; column < COLUMNS; column++) { 
changeToRandomColor (row, column); 

} 

} 

} // end f illWithRandomColors 

static void changeToRandomColor (int rowNum, int colNum) { 

int red = (int) (256*Math.random() ) ; // Choose random levels in range 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 160 



int green = (int) (256*Math.random()) ; // to 255 for red, green, 

int blue = (int) (256*Math.random()) ; // and blue color components. 

Mosaic . setColor (rowNum, colNum, red, green, blue) ; 
} // end changeToRandomColor 

static void randomMove () { 

int directionNum; // Randomly set to 0, 1, 2, or 3 to choose direction. 
directionNum = (int) (4*Math. random ()) ; 
switch (directionNum) { 
case 0: // move up 
currentRow — ; 
if (currentRow < 0) 

currentRow = ROWS - 1; 
break; 
case 1 : // move right 
currentColumn++ ; 
if (currentColumn >= COLUMNS) 

currentColumn = ; 
break; 
case 2 : // move down 
currentRow ++; 
if (currentRow >= ROWS) 

currentRow = ; 
break; 
case 3: // move left 
currentColumn — ; 
if (currentColumn < 0) 

currentColumn = COLUMNS - 1; 
break; 

} 

y II end randomMove 
} // end class RandomMosaicWalk2 

4.7.3 Naming and Scope Rules 

When a variable declaration is executed, memory is allocated for that variable. The variable 
name can be used in at least some part of the program source code to refer to that memory or 
to the data that is stored in the memory. The portion of the program source code where the 
variable name is valid is called the scope of the variable. Similarly, we can refer to the scope 
of subroutine names and formal parameter names. 

For static member subroutines, scope is straightforward. The scope of a static subroutine 
is the entire source code of the class in which it is defined. That is, it is possible to call the 
subroutine from any point in the class, including at a point in the source code before the point 
where the definition of the subroutine appears. It is even possible to call a subroutine from 
within itself. This is an example of something called "recursion," a fairly advanced topic that 
we will return to in Chapter 9. 

For a variable that is declared as a static member variable in a class, the situation is similar, 
but with one complication. It is legal to have a local variable or a formal parameter that has 
the same name as a member variable. In that case, within the scope of the local variable or 
parameter, the member variable is hidden. Consider, for example, a class named Game that 
has the form: 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



161 



public class Game { 

static int count; // member variable 

static void playGameO { 

int count; // local variable 

// Some statements to define playGameO 

} 

// More variables and subroutines. 
} // end Game 

In the statements that make up the body of the playGameO subroutine, the name "count" 
refers to the local variable. In the rest of the Game class, "count" refers to the member variable 
(unless hidden by other local variables or parameters named count). However, there is one 
further complication. The member variable named count can also be referred to by the full 
name Game . count. Usually, the full name is only used outside the class where count is defined. 
However, there is no rule against using it inside the class. The full name, Game, count, can 
be used inside the playGameO subroutine to refer to the member variable instead of the local 
variable. So, the full scope rule is that the scope of a static member variable includes the entire 
class in which it is defined, but where the simple name of the member variable is hidden by a 
local variable or formal parameter name, the member variable must be referred to by its full 
name of the form {className).(variableName). (Scope rules for non-static members are similar 
to those for static members, except that, as we shall see, non-static members cannot be used 
in static subroutines.) 

The scope of a formal parameter of a subroutine is the block that makes up the body of the 
subroutine. The scope of a local variable extends from the declaration statement that defines 
the variable to the end of the block in which the declaration occurs. As noted above, it is 
possible to declare a loop control variable of a for loop in the for statement, as in "for (int 
i=0; i < 10; The scope of such a declaration is considered as a special case: It is 

valid only within the for statement and does not extend to the remainder of the block that 
contains the for statement. 

It is not legal to redefine the name of a formal parameter or local variable within its scope, 
even in a nested block. For example, this is not allowed: 

void badSub(int y) { 
int x; 

while (y > 0) { 

int x; // ERROR: x is already defined. 



y 

y 

In many languages, this would be legal; the declaration of x in the while loop would hide 
the original declaration. It is not legal in Java; however, once the block in which a variable is 
declared ends, its name does become available for reuse in Java. For example: 



CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES 



162 



void goodSub(int y) { 
while (y > 10) { 
int x; 



// The scope of x ends here. 

} 

while (y > 0) { 

int x; //OK: Previous declaration of x has expired. 



} 

} 

You might wonder whether local variable names can hide subroutine names. This can't 
happen, for a reason that might be surprising. There is no rule that variables and subroutines 
have to have different names. The computer can always tell whether a name refers to a variable 
or to a subroutine, because a subroutine name is always followed by a left parenthesis. It's 
perfectly legal to have a variable called count and a subroutine called count in the same class. 
(This is one reason why I often write subroutine names with parentheses, as when I talk about 
the main() routine. It's a good idea to think of the parentheses as part of the name.) Even 
more is true: It's legal to reuse class names to name variables and subroutines. The syntax 
rules of Java guarantee that the computer can always tell when a name is being used as a class 
name. A class name is a type, and so it can be used to declare variables and formal parameters 
and to specify the return type of a function. This means that you could legally have a class 
called Insanity in which you declare a function 

static Insanity Insanity( Insanity Insanity ){...} 

The first Insanity is the return type of the function. The second is the function name, the 
third is the type of the formal parameter, and the fourth is the name of the formal parameter. 
However, please remember that not everything that is possible is a good idea! 



Exercises 



163 



Exercises for Chapter 4 

1. To "capitalize" a string means to change the first letter of each word in the string to upper (solution) 
case (if it is not already upper case). For example, a capitalized version of "Now is the time 

to act!" is "Now Is The Time To Act!". Write a subroutine named printCapitalized 
that will print a capitalized version of a string to standard output. The string to be printed 
should be a parameter to the subroutine. Test your subroutine with a main() routine that 
gets a line of input from the user and applies the subroutine to it. 

Note that a letter is the first letter of a word if it is not immediately preceded in 
the string by another letter. Recall that there is a standard boolean-valued function 
Character . isLetter (char) that can be used to test whether its parameter is a letter. 
There is another standard char-valued function, Character. toUpperCase( char), that 
returns a capitalized version of the single character passed to it as a parameter. That is, 
if the parameter is a letter, it returns the upper-case version. If the parameter is not a 
letter, it just returns a copy of the parameter. 

2. The hexadecimal digits are the ordinary, base-10 digits '0' through '9' plus the letters 'A' (solution) 
through 'F'. In the hexadecimal system, these digits represent the values through 15, 
respectively. Write a function named hexValue that uses a switch statement to find the 
hexadecimal value of a given character. The character is a parameter to the function, and 

its hexadecimal value is the return value of the function. You should count lower case 
letters 'a' through T as having the same value as the corresponding upper case letters. 
If the parameter is not one of the legal hexadecimal digits, return -1 as the value of the 
function. 

A hexadecimal integer is a sequence of hexadecimal digits, such as 34A7, FF8, 174204, 
or FADE. If str is a string containing a hexadecimal integer, then the corresponding 
base-10 integer can be computed as follows: 

value = ; 

for ( i = 0; i < str . length () ; i++ ) 

value = value*16 + hexValue( str . charAt (i) ); 

Of course, this is not valid if str contains any characters that are not hexadecimal digits. 
Write a program that reads a string from the user. If all the characters in the string are 
hexadecimal digits, print out the corresponding base-10 value. If not, print out an error 
message. 

3. Write a function that simulates rolling a pair of dice until the total on the dice comes up (solution) 
to be a given number. The number that you are rolling for is a parameter to the function. 

The number of times you have to roll the dice is the return value of the function. The 
parameter should be one of the possible totals: 2, 3, . . . , 12. The function should throw 
an HlegalArgumentException if this is not the case. Use your function in a program that 
computes and prints the number of rolls it takes to get snake eyes. (Snake eyes means 
that the total showing on the dice is 2.) 

4. This exercise builds on Exercise 4.3. Every time you roll the dice repeatedly, trying to (solution) 
get a given total, the number of rolls it takes can be different. The question naturally 

arises, what's the average number of rolls to get a given total? Write a function that 
performs the experiment of rolling to get a given total 10000 times. The desired total is 



Exercises 



164 



a parameter to the subroutine. The average number of rolls is the return value. Each 
individual experiment should be done by calling the function you wrote for Exercise 4.3. 
Now, write a main program that will call your function once for each of the possible totals 
(2, 3, 12). It should make a table of the results, something like: 

Total On Dice Average Number of Rolls 

2 35.8382 

3 18.0607 



5. The sample program RandomMosaicWalk.java from Section 4.6 shows a "disturbance" (solution) 
that wanders around a grid of colored squares. When the disturbance visits a square, the 

color of that square is changed. The applet at the bottom of Section 4.7 in the on-line 
version of this book shows a variation on this idea. In this applet, all the squares start out 
with the default color, black. Every time the disturbance visits a square, a small amount 
is added to the green component of the color of that square. Write a subroutine that 
will add 25 to the green component of one of the squares in the mosaic. The row and 
column numbers of the square should be given as parameters to the subroutine. Recall 
that you can discover the current green component of the square in row r and column c 
with the function call Mosaic . getGreen(r , c) . Use your subroutine as a substitute for the 
changeToRandomColor () subroutine in the program RandomMosaicWalk2.java. (This is 
the improved version of the program from Section 4.7 that uses named constants for the 
number of rows, number of columns, and square size.) Set the number of rows and the 
number of columns to 80. Set the square size to 5. 

Don't forget that you will need Mosaic.java and Mosaic Canvas, java to compile and run 
your program, since they define non-standard classes that are required by the program. 

6. For this exercise, you will do something even more interesting with the Mosaic class that (solution) 
was discussed in Section 4.6. (Again, don't forget that you will need Mosaic.java and 
MosaicCanvas.j ava. ) 

The program that you write for this exercise should start by filling a mosaic with 
random colors. Then repeat the following until the user closes the mosaic window: Se- 
lect one of the rectangles in the mosaic at random. Then select one of the neighboring 
rectangles — above it, below it, to the left of it, or to the right of it. Copy the color of the 
originally selected rectangle to the selected neighbor, so that the two rectangles now have 
the same color. 

As this process is repeated over and over, it becomes more and more likely that neigh- 
boring squares will have the same color. The result is to build up larger color patches. On 
the other hand, once the last square of a given color disappears, there is no way for that 
color to ever reappear (extinction is forever!). If you let the program run long enough, 
eventually the entire mosaic will be one uniform color. 

You can find an applet version of the program in the on-line version of this page. Here 
is a picture of what the mosaic looks like after the program has been running for a while: 



Exercises 



165 




After doing each color conversion, your program should insert a very short delay. You 
can try running the program without the delay; it will work, but it might be a little glitchy. 

7. This is another Mosaic exercise, (using Mosaic.java and MosaicCanvas.java as discussed (solution) 
in Section 4.6). While the program does not do anything particularly interesting, it's 
interesting as a programming problem. An applet that does the same thing as the program 
can be seen in the on-line version of this book. Here is a picture showing what it looks 
like at several different times: 




The program will show a square that grows from the center of the applet to the edges. 
As it grows, the part added around the edges gets brighter, so that in the end the color 
of the square fades from white at the edges to dark gray at the center. 

The whole picture is made up of the little rectangles of a mosaic. You should first write 
a subroutine that draws the outline of a rectangle on a Mosaic window. More specifically, 
write a subroutine named out lineRect angle such that the subroutine call statement 

outlineRectangle (top , left , height , width , r , g , b) ; 

will call Mosaic . setColor (row, col ,r,g,b) for each little square that lies on the outline 
of a rectangle. The topmost row of the rectangle is specified by top. The number of 
rows in the rectangle is specified by height (so the bottommost row is top+height-l). 
The leftmost column of the rectangle is specified by left. The number of columns in 
the rectangle is specified by width (so the rightmost column is lef t+width-1.) For the 
specific program that you are writing, the width and the height of the rectangle will always 
be equal, but it's nice to have the more general-purpose routine. 

The animation loops through the same sequence of steps over and over. In each step, 
the outline of a rectangle is drawn in gray (that is, with all three color components having 
the same value). There is a pause of 200 milliseconds so the user can see the picture. 
Then the variables giving the top row, left column, size, and color level of the rectangle 
are adjusted to get ready for the next step. In my applet, the color level starts at 50 
and increases by 10 after each step. When the rectangle gets to the outer edge of the 
applet, the loop ends, and the picture is erased by filling the mosaic with black. Then, 
after a delay of one second, the animation starts again at the beginning of the loop. You

might want to make an additional subroutine to do one loop through the steps of the basic 
animation. 

The main() routine simply opens a Mosaic window and then does the animation loop 
over and over until the user closes the window. There is a 1000 millisecond delay between 
one animation loop and the next. Use a Mosaic window that has 41 rows and 41 columns. 
(I advise you not to use named constants for the numbers of rows and columns, since the 
problem is complicated enough already.)

Programming in the Large II: 
Objects and Classes 

Whereas a subroutine represents a single task, an object can encapsulate both data (in 
the form of instance variables) and a number of different tasks or "behaviors" related to that 
data (in the form of instance methods). Therefore objects provide another, more sophisticated 
type of structure that can be used to help manage the complexity of large programs. 

This chapter covers the creation and use of objects in Java. Section 5.5 covers the central 
ideas of object-oriented programming: inheritance and polymorphism. However, in this text- 
book, we will generally use these ideas in a limited form, by creating independent classes and 
building on existing classes rather than by designing entire hierarchies of classes from scratch. 
Section 5.6 and Section 5.7 cover some of the many details of object oriented programming in 
Java. Although these details are used occasionally later in the book, you might want to skim 
through them now and return to them later when they are actually needed. 

5.1 Objects, Instance Methods, and Instance Variables 

Object-oriented programming (OOP) represents an attempt to make programs more (online) 
closely model the way people think about and deal with the world. In the older styles of 
programming, a programmer who is faced with some problem must identify a computing task 
that needs to be performed in order to solve the problem. Programming then consists of 
finding a sequence of instructions that will accomplish that task. But at the heart of object- 
oriented programming, instead of tasks we find objects — entities that have behaviors, that hold 
information, and that can interact with one another. Programming consists of designing a set 
of objects that somehow model the problem at hand. Software objects in the program can 
represent real or abstract entities in the problem domain. This is supposed to make the design 
of the program more natural and hence easier to get right and easier to understand. 

To some extent, OOP is just a change in point of view. We can think of an object in standard 
programming terms as nothing more than a set of variables together with some subroutines for 
manipulating those variables. In fact, it is possible to use object-oriented techniques in any 
programming language. However, there is a big difference between a language that makes OOP 
possible and one that actively supports it. An object-oriented programming language such as 
Java includes a number of features that make it very different from a standard language. In 
order to make effective use of those features, you have to "orient" your thinking correctly.

CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



169 



5.1.1 Objects, Classes, and Instances 

Objects are closely related to classes. We have already been working with classes for several 
chapters, and we have seen that a class can contain variables and subroutines. If an object is 
also a collection of variables and subroutines, how do they differ from classes? And why does it 
require a different type of thinking to understand and use them effectively? In the one section 
where we worked with objects rather than classes, Section 3.8, it didn't seem to make much 
difference: We just left the word "static" out of the subroutine definitions! 

I have said that classes "describe" objects, or more exactly that the non-static portions of 
classes describe objects. But it's probably not very clear what this means. The more usual 
terminology is to say that objects belong to classes, but this might not be much clearer. (There 
is a real shortage of English words to properly distinguish all the concepts involved. An object 
certainly doesn't "belong" to a class in the same way that a member variable "belongs" to a 
class.) From the point of view of programming, it is more exact to say that classes are used 
to create objects. A class is a kind of factory — or blueprint — for constructing objects. The 
non-static parts of the class specify, or describe, what variables and subroutines the objects will 
contain. This is part of the explanation of how objects differ from classes: Objects are created 
and destroyed as the program runs, and there can be many objects with the same structure, if 
they are created using the same class. 

Consider a simple class whose job is to group together a few static member variables. For 
example, the following class could be used to store information about the person who is using 
the program: 

class UserData { 

static String name; 
static int age; 

} 

In a program that uses this class, there is only one copy of each of the variables UserData. name 
and UserData. age. There can only be one "user," since we only have memory space to store 
data about one user. The class, UserData, and the variables it contains exist as long as the 
program runs. (That is essentially what it means to be "static") Now, consider a similar class 
that includes non-static variables: 

class PlayerData { 
String name ; 
int age ; 

} 

In this case, there is no such variable as PlayerData. name or PlayerData. age, since name and 
age are not static members of PlayerData. So, there is nothing much in the class at all — 
except the potential to create objects. But, it's a lot of potential, since it can be used to create 
any number of objects! Each object will have its own variables called name and age. There 
can be many "players" because we can make new objects to represent new players on demand. 
A program might use this class to store information about multiple players in a game. Each 
player has a name and an age. When a player joins the game, a new PlayerData object can 
be created to represent that player. If a player leaves the game, the PlayerData object that 
represents that player can be destroyed. A system of objects in the program is being used to 
dynamically model what is happening in the game. You can't do this with static variables! 

In Section 3.8, we worked with applets, which are objects. The reason they didn't seem to 
be any different from classes is because we were only working with one applet in each class that 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



170 



we looked at. But one class can be used to make many applets. Think of an applet that scrolls 
a message across a Web page. There could be several such applets on the same page, all created 
from the same class. If the scrolling message in the applet is stored in a non-static variable, 
then each applet will have its own variable, and each applet can show a different message. The 
situation is even clearer if you think about windows on the screen, which, like applets, are 
objects. As a program runs, many windows might be opened and closed, but all those windows 
can belong to the same class. Here again, we have a dynamic situation where multiple objects 
are created and destroyed as a program runs. 

* * * 

An object that belongs to a class is said to be an instance of that class. The variables that 
the object contains are called instance variables . The subroutines that the object contains 
are called instance methods. (Recall that in the context of object-oriented programming, 
method is a synonym for "subroutine". From now on, since we are doing object-oriented 
programming, I will prefer the term "method.") For example, if the PlayerData class, as 
defined above, is used to create an object, then that object is an instance of the PlayerData 
class, and name and age are instance variables in the object. It is important to remember that 
the class of an object determines the types of the instance variables; however, the actual data 
is contained inside the individual objects, not the class. Thus, each object has its own set of 
data. 

An applet that scrolls a message across a Web page might include a subroutine named 
scroll (). Since the applet is an object, this subroutine is an instance method of the applet. 
The source code for the method is in the class that is used to create the applet. Still, it's better 
to think of the instance method as belonging to the object, not to the class. The non-static 
subroutines in the class merely specify the instance methods that every object created from the 
class will contain. The scroll () methods in two different applets do the same thing in the 
sense that they both scroll messages across the screen. But there is a real difference between 
the two scroll () methods. The messages that they scroll can be different. You might say that 
the method definition in the class specifies what type of behavior the objects will have, but 
the specific behavior can vary from object to object, depending on the values of their instance 
variables. 

As you can see, the static and the non-static portions of a class are very different things and 
serve very different purposes. Many classes contain only static members, or only non-static. 
However, it is possible to mix static and non-static members in a single class, and we'll see 
a few examples later in this chapter where it is reasonable to do so. You should distinguish 
between the source code for the class, and the class itself. The source code determines both 
the class and the objects that are created from that class. The "static" definitions in the source 
code specify the things that are part of the class itself, whereas the non-static definitions in the 
source code specify things that will become part of every instance object that is created from 
the class. By the way, static member variables and static member subroutines in a class are 
sometimes called class variables and class methods, since they belong to the class itself, 
rather than to instances of that class. 

5.1.2 Fundamentals of Objects 

So far, I've been talking mostly in generalities, and I haven't given you much of an idea about 
what you have to put in a program if you want to work with objects. Let's look at a specific 
example to see how it works. Consider this extremely simplified version of a Student class, 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



171 



which could be used to store information about students taking a course: 
public class Student { 

public String name; // Student's name. 

public double testl, test2, test3; // Grades on three tests. 

public double getAverageO { // compute average test grade 
return (testl + test2 + test3) / 3; 

> 

} // end of class Student 

None of the members of this class are declared to be static, so the class exists only for 
creating objects. This class definition says that any object that is an instance of the Student 
class will include instance variables named name, testl, test2, and test3, and it will include an 
instance method named getAverageO. The names and tests in different objects will generally 
have different values. When called for a particular student, the method getAverageO will 
compute an average using that student's test grades. Different students can have different 
averages. (Again, this is what it means to say that an instance method belongs to an individual 
object, not to the class.) 

In Java, a class is a type, similar to the built-in types such as int and boolean. So, a class 
name can be used to specify the type of a variable in a declaration statement, the type of a 
formal parameter, or the return type of a function. For example, a program could define a 
variable named std of type Student with the statement 

Student std; 

However, declaring a variable does not create an object! This is an important point, which is 
related to this Very Important Fact: 

In Java, no variable can ever hold an object. 
A variable can only hold a reference to an object. 

You should think of objects as floating around independently in the computer's memory. In 
fact, there is a special portion of memory called the heap where objects live. Instead of holding 
an object itself, a variable holds the information necessary to find the object in memory. This 
information is called a reference or pointer to the object. In effect, a reference to an object 
is the address of the memory location where the object is stored. When you use a variable of 
object type, the computer uses the reference in the variable to find the actual object. 

In a program, objects are created using an operator called new, which creates an object 
and returns a reference to that object. For example, assuming that std is a variable of type 
Student, declared as above, the assignment statement 

std = new Student (); 

would create a new object which is an instance of the class Student, and it would store a 
reference to that object in the variable std. The value of the variable is a reference, or pointer, 
to the object, not the object itself. It is not quite true, then, to say that the object is the 
"value of the variable std" (though sometimes it is hard to avoid using this terminology). It 
is certainly not at all true to say that the object is "stored in the variable std." The proper 
terminology is that "the variable std refers to or points to the object," and I will try to 
stick to that terminology as much as possible. 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



172 



So, suppose that the variable std refers to an object belonging to the class Student. That 
object has instance variables name, testl, test 2, and test 3. These instance variables can 
be referred to as std. name, std. testl, std.test2, and std.test3. This follows the usual 
naming convention that when B is part of A, then the full name of B is A.B. For example, a 
program might include the lines 

System. out. println( "Hello, " + std. name + ". Your test grades are:"); 
System. out . println(std. testl) ; 
System. out .println(std.test2) ; 
System. out .println(std.test3) ; 

This would output the name and test grades from the object to which std refers. Simi- 
larly, std can be used to call the getAverageQ instance method in the object by saying 
std.getAverageQ. To print out the student's average, you could say: 

System. out .println( "Your average is " + std. get Average () ); 

More generally, you could use std. name any place where a variable of type String is legal. 
You can use it in expressions. You can assign a value to it. You can even use it to call subroutines 
from the String class. For example, std. name . length () is the number of characters in the 
student's name. 

It is possible for a variable like std, whose type is given by a class, to refer to no object at 
all. We say in this case that std holds a null pointer or null reference. The null pointer is 
written in Java as "null" . You can store a null reference in the variable std by saying 



null is an actual value that is stored in the variable, not a pointer to something else. You could 
test whether the value of std is null by testing 

if (std == null) . . . 

If the value of a variable is null, then it is, of course, illegal to refer to instance variables 
or instance methods through that variable — since there is no object, and hence no instance 
variables to refer to! For example, if the value of the variable std is null, then it would be 
illegal to refer to std. testl. If your program attempts to use a null pointer illegally in this 
way, the result is an error called a null pointer exception. When this happens while the 
program is running, an exception of type NullPointerException is thrown. 

Let's look at a sequence of statements that work with objects: 

Student std, stdl, // Declare four variables of 



std = null; 



std3 = null ; 



std2, std3; 
std = new Student (); 



stdl = new Student (); 



std2 = stdl; 



// type Student . 

// Create a new object belonging 

// to the class Student, and 

// store a reference to that 

// object in the variable std. 

// Create a second Student object 

// and store a reference to 

// it in the variable stdl. 

// Copy the reference value in stdl 

// into the variable std2 . 

// Store a null reference in the 

// variable std3 . 



std. name = "John Smith"; // Set values of some instance variables, 
stdl. name = "Mary Jones"; 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



173 



// (Other instance variables have default 
// initial values of zero.) 

After the computer executes these statements, the situation in the computer's memory looks 
like this: 



std 
stdl 
std2 
std3 




Object (class Student) 



name: 




testl: 





test2: 





test3: 






(getAverageQ) 



1 



Object (class Student) 


name: 






• 




testl: 







test2: 







test3: 







(getAverageO) 




Object (class String) 
"Mary Jones" 



Object (class String) 
"John Smith" 



This picture shows variables as little boxes, labeled with the names of the variables. Objects 
are shown as boxes with round corners. When a variable contains a reference to an object, the 
value of that variable is shown as an arrow pointing to the object. The variable std3, with a 
value of null, doesn't point anywhere. The arrows from stdl and std2 both point to the same 
object. This illustrates a Very Important Point: 

When one object variable is assigned 
to another, only a reference is copied. 
The object referred to is not copied. 

When the assignment "std2 = stdl;" was executed, no new object was created. Instead, std2 
was set to refer to the very same object that stdl refers to. This is to be expected, since the 
assignment statement just copies the value that is stored in stdl into std2, and that value 
is a pointer, not an object. But this has some consequences that might be surprising. For 
example, stdl. name and std2.name are two different names for the same variable, namely 
the instance variable in the object that both stdl and std2 refer to. After the string "Mary 
Jones" is assigned to the variable stdl. name, it is also true that the value of std2.name is 
"Mary Jones". There is a potential for a lot of confusion here, but you can help protect yourself 
from it if you keep telling yourself, "The object is not in the variable. The variable just holds 
a pointer to the object." 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



174 



You can test objects for equality and inequality using the operators == and ! =, but 
here again, the semantics are different from what you are used to. When you make a test 
"if (stdl == std2)", you are testing whether the values stored in stdl and std2 are the 
same. But the values are references to objects, not objects. So, you are testing whether 
stdl and std2 refer to the same object, that is, whether they point to the same location 
in memory. This is fine, if its what you want to do. But sometimes, what you want to 
check is whether the instance variables in the objects have the same values. To do that, you 
would need to ask whether "stdl .test 1 == std2.testl && stdl.test2 == std2.test2 && 
stdl.test3 == std2.test3 && stdl .name . equals (std2 .name)" . 

I've remarked previously that Strings are objects, and I've shown the strings "Mary Jones" 
and "John Smith" as objects in the above illustration. A variable of type String can only hold 
a reference to a string, not the string itself. This explains why using the == operator to test 
strings for equality is not a good idea. Suppose that greeting is a variable of type String, 
and that it refers to the string "Hello". Then would the test greeting == "Hello" be true? 
Well, maybe, maybe not. The variable greeting and the String literal "Hello" each refer to a 
string that contains the characters H-e-l-l-o. But the strings could still be different objects, that 
just happen to contain the same characters, and in that case, greeting == "Hello" would be 
false. The function greeting, equals ("Hello") tests whether greeting and "Hello" contain 
the same characters, which is almost certainly the question you want to ask. The expres- 
sion greeting == "Hello" tests whether greeting and "Hello" contain the same characters 
stored in the same memory location. (Of course, a String variable such as greeting can 
also contain the special value null, and it would make sense to use the == operator to test 
whether "greeting == null".) 

* * * 

The fact that variables hold references to objects, not objects themselves, has a couple of 
other consequences that you should be aware of. They follow logically, if you just keep in mind 
the basic fact that the object is not stored in the variable. The object is somewhere else; the 
variable points to it. 

Suppose that a variable that refers to an object is declared to be final. This means that 
the value stored in the variable can never be changed, once the variable has been initialized. 
The value stored in the variable is a reference to the object. So the variable will continue to 
refer to the same object as long as the variable exists. However, this does not prevent the data 
in the object from changing. The variable is final, not the object. It's perfectly legal to say 

final Student stu = new Student (); 

stu.name = "John Doe"; // Change data in the object; 

// The value stored in stu is not changed! 
//It still refers to the same object. 

Next, suppose that obj is a variable that refers to an object. Let's consider what happens 
when obj is passed as an actual parameter to a subroutine. The value of obj is assigned to 
a formal parameter in the subroutine, and the subroutine is executed. The subroutine has no 
power to change the value stored in the variable, obj . It only has a copy of that value. However, 
that value is a reference to an object. Since the subroutine has a reference to the object, it can 
change the data stored in the object. After the subroutine ends, obj still points to the same 
object, but the data stored in the object might have changed. Suppose x is a variable of type 
int and stu is a variable of type Student. Compare: 

void dontChange (int z) { void change (Student s) { 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



175 



z = 42; 



s .name = "Fred" ' 



The lines: 
x = 17; 

dontChange (x) ; 
System. out .println(x) ; 

output the value 17. 

The value of x is not 
changed by the subroutine, 
which is equivalent to 

z = x; 
z = 42; 



The lines: 

stu.name = "Jane"; 
change (stu) ; 

System. out .println(stu.name) ; 

output the value "Fred". 

The value of stu is not 
changed, but stu.name is. 
This is equivalent to 

s = stu; 

s.name = "Fred"; 



5.1.3 Getters and Setters 

When writing new classes, it's a good idea to pay attention to the issue of access control. Recall 
that making a member of a class public makes it accessible from anywhere, including from 
other classes. On the other hand, a private member can only be used in the class where it is 
defined. 

In the opinion of many programmers, almost all member variables should be declared 
private. This gives you complete control over what can be done with the variable. Even 
if the variable itself is private, you can allow other classes to find out what its value is by pro- 
viding a public accessor method that returns the value of the variable. For example, if your 
class contains a private member variable, title, of type String, you can provide a method 

public String getTitleO { 
return title; 

} 

that returns the value of title. By convention, the name of an accessor method for a variable 
is obtained by capitalizing the name of variable and adding "get" in front of the name. So, for 
the variable title, we get an accessor method named "get" + "Title", or getTitleO. Because 
of this naming convention, accessor methods are more often referred to as getter methods. A 
getter method provides "read access" to a variable. 

You might also want to allow "write access" to a private variable. That is, you might 
want to make it possible for other classes to specify a new value for the variable. This is done 
with a setter method. (If you don't like simple, Anglo-Saxon words, you can use the fancier 
term mutator method.) The name of a setter method should consist of "set" followed by a 
capitalized copy of the variable's name, and it should have a parameter with the same type as 
the variable. A setter method for the variable title could be written 

public void setTitle( String newTitle ) { 
title = newTitle; 

} 

It is actually very common to provide both a getter and a setter method for a private 
member variable. Since this allows other classes both to see and to change the value of the 
variable, you might wonder why not just make the variable public? The reason is that getters 
and setters are not restricted to simply reading and writing the variable's value. In fact, they 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



176 



can take any action at all. For example, a getter method might keep track of the number of 
times that the variable has been accessed: 

public String getTitleO { 

titleAccessCount++; // Increment member variable titleAccessCount . 
return title; 

} 

and a setter method might check that the value that is being assigned to the variable is legal: 

public void setTitle( String newTitle ) { 

if ( newTitle == null ) // Don't allow null strings as titles! 

title = "(Untitled)"; // Use an appropriate default value instead, 
else 

title = newTitle; 

} 

Even if you can't think of any extra chores to do in a getter or setter method, you might change 
your mind in the future when you redesign and improve your class. If you've used a getter and 
setter from the beginning, you can make the modification to your class without affecting any of 
the classes that use your class. The private member variable is not part of the public interface 
of your class; only the public getter and setter methods are, and you are free to change their 
implementations without changing the public interface of your class. If you haven't used get 
and set from the beginning, you'll have to contact everyone who uses your class and tell them, 
"Sorry guys, you'll have to track down every use that you've made of this variable and change 
your code to use my new get and set methods instead." 

A couple of final notes: Some advanced aspects of Java rely on the naming convention 
for getter and setter methods, so it's a good idea to follow the convention rigorously. And 
though I've been talking about using getter and setter methods for a variable, you can define 
get and set methods even if there is no variable. A getter and/or setter method defines a 
property of the class, that might or might not correspond to a variable. For example, if a class 
includes a public void instance method with signature setValue (double) , then the class has 
a "property" named value of type double, and it has this property whether or not the class 
has a member variable named value. 

5.2 Constructors and Object Initialization 

Object types in Java are very different from the primitive types. Simply declaring a variable (online) 
whose type is given as a class does not automatically create an object of that class. Objects 
must be explicitly constructed. For the computer, the process of constructing an object means, 
first, finding some unused memory in the heap that can be used to hold the object and, second, 
filling in the object's instance variables. As a programmer, you don't care where in memory 
the object is stored, but you will usually want to exercise some control over what initial values 
are stored in a new object's instance variables. In many cases, you will also want to do more 
complicated initialization or bookkeeping every time an object is created. 

5.2.1 Initializing Instance Variables 

An instance variable can be assigned an initial value in its declaration, just like any other 
variable. For example, consider a class named PairOfDice. An object of this class will represent 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



177 



a pair of dice. It will contain two instance variables to represent the numbers showing on the 
dice and an instance method for rolling the dice: 

public class PairOfDice { 

public int diel = 3; // Number showing on the first die. 
public int die2 = 4; // Number showing on the second die. 

public void rollO { 

// Roll the dice by setting each of the dice to be 

// a random number between 1 and 6 . 
diel = (int) (Math. random 0*6) + 1; 
die2 = (int) (Math. random()*6) + 1; 

} 

} // end class PairOfDice 

The instance variables diel and die 2 are initialized to the values 3 and 4 respectively. These 
initializations are executed whenever a PairOfDice object is constructed. It's important to 
understand when and how this happens. There can be many PairOfDice objects. Each time one 
is created, it gets its own instance variables, and the assignments "diel = 3" and "die2 = 4" 
are executed to fill in the values of those variables. To make this clearer, consider a variation 
of the PairOfDice class: 

public class PairOfDice { 

public int diel = (int) (Math. random 0*6) + 1; 
public int die2 = (int) (Math. random()*6) + 1; 

public void rollO { 

diel = (int) (Math. random()*6) + 1; 
die2 = (int) (Math. random 0*6) + 1; 

} 

} // end class PairOfDice 

Here, the dice are initialized to random values, as if a new pair of dice were being thrown onto 
the gaming table. Since the initialization is executed for each new object, a set of random initial 
values will be computed for each new pair of dice. Different pairs of dice can have different 
initial values. For initialization of static member variables, of course, the situation is quite 
different. There is only one copy of a static variable, and initialization of that variable is 
executed just once, when the class is first loaded. 

If you don't provide any initial value for an instance variable, a default initial value is pro- 
vided automatically. Instance variables of numerical type (int, double, etc.) are automatically 
initialized to zero if you provide no other values; boolean variables are initialized to false; and 
char variables, to the Unicode character with code number zero. An instance variable can also 
be a variable of object type. For such variables, the default initial value is null. (In particular, 
since Strings are objects, the default initial value for String variables is null.) 

5.2.2 Constructors 



Objects are created with the operator, new. For example, a program that wants to use a 
PairOfDice object could say: 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



178 



PairOfDice dice; // Declare a variable of type PairOfDice. 

dice = new PairOfDice () ; // Construct a new object and store a 

// reference to it in the variable. 

In this example, "new PairOfDice ()" is an expression that allocates memory for the object, 
initializes the object's instance variables, and then returns a reference to the object. This 
reference is the value of the expression, and that value is stored by the assignment statement in 
the variable, dice, so that after the assignment statement is executed, dice refers to the newly 
created object. Part of this expression, "PairOfDice ()", looks like a subroutine call, and that 
is no accident. It is, in fact, a call to a special type of subroutine called a constructor. This 
might puzzle you, since there is no such subroutine in the class definition. However, every class 
has at least one constructor. If the programmer doesn't write a constructor definition in a class, 
then the system will provide a default constructor for that class. This default constructor 
does nothing beyond the basics: allocate memory and initialize instance variables. If you want 
more than that to happen when an object is created, you can include one or more constructors 
in the class definition. 

The definition of a constructor looks much like the definition of any other subroutine, with 
three exceptions. A constructor does not have any return type (not even void). The name 
of the constructor must be the same as the name of the class in which it is defined. And the 
only modifiers that can be used on a constructor definition are the access modifiers public, 
private, and protected. (In particular, a constructor can't be declared static.) 

However, a constructor does have a subroutine body of the usual form, a block of statements. 
There are no restrictions on what statements can be used. And it can have a list of formal 
parameters. In fact, the ability to include parameters is one of the main reasons for using 
constructors. The parameters can provide data to be used in the construction of the object. 
For example, a constructor for the PairOfDice class could provide the values that are initially 
showing on the dice. Here is what the class would look like in that case: 

public class PairOfDice { 

public int diel; // Number showing on the first die. 
public int die2; // Number showing on the second die. 

public PairOfDice (int vail, int val2) { 

// Constructor. Creates a pair of dice that 
// are initially showing the values vail and val2. 
diel = vail; // Assign specified values 
die2 = val2; // to the instance variables. 

> 

public void rollO { 

// Roll the dice by setting each of the dice to be 

// a random number between 1 and 6 . 
diel = (int) (Math. random()*6) + 1; 
die2 = (int) (Math. random()*6) + 1; 

} 

} // end class PairOfDice 

The constructor is declared as "public PairOfDice (int vail, int val2) ...",withno 
return type and with the same name as the name of the class. This is how the Java com- 
piler recognizes a constructor. The constructor has two parameters, and values for these 
parameters must be provided when the constructor is called. For example, the expression 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



179 



"new Pair0fDice(3,4)" would create a PairOfDice object in which the values of the instance 
variables diel and die2 are initially 3 and 4. Of course, in a program, the value returned by 
the constructor should be used in some way, as in 

PairOfDice dice; // Declare a variable of type PairOfDice. 

dice = new PairOfDice (1 , 1) ; // Let dice refer to a new PairOfDice 

// object that initially shows 1, 1. 

Now that we've added a constructor to the PairOfDice class, we can no longer create an 
object by saying "new PairOfDiceO"! The system provides a default constructor for a class 
only if the class definition does not already include a constructor, so there is only one con- 
structor in the class, and it requires two actual parameters. However, this is not a big problem, 
since we can add a second constructor to the class, one that has no parameters. In fact, you 
can have as many different constructors as you want, as long as their signatures are different, 
that is, as long as they have different numbers or types of formal parameters. In the PairOfDice 
class, we might have a constructor with no parameters which produces a pair of dice showing 
random numbers: 

public class PairOfDice { 

public int diel; // Number showing on the first die. 
public int die2; // Number showing on the second die. 

public PairOfDiceO { 

// Constructor. Rolls the dice, so that they initially 
// show some random values. 
rollO; // Call the rollO method to roll the dice. 

> 

public PairOfDice (int vail, int val2) { 

// Constructor. Creates a pair of dice that 
// are initially showing the values vail and val2. 
diel = vail; // Assign specified values 
die2 = val2; // to the instance variables. 

> 

public void rollO { 

// Roll the dice by setting each of the dice to be 

// a random number between 1 and 6 . 
diel = (int) (Math. randomO*6) + 1; 
die2 = (int) (Math. random()*6) + 1; 

> 

} // end class PairOfDice 

Now we have the option of constructing a PairOfDice object either with "new PairOfDiceO" 
or with "new PairOfDice(x,y)", where x and y are int-valued expressions. 

This class, once it is written, can be used in any program that needs to work with one 
or more pairs of dice. None of those programs will ever have to use the obscure incantation 
"(int) (Math. randomO *6)+l" , because it's done inside the PairOfDice class. And the pro- 
grammer, having once gotten the dice-rolling thing straight will never have to worry about it 
again. Here, for example, is a main program that uses the PairOfDice class to count how many 
times two pairs of dice are rolled before the two pairs come up showing the same value. This 
illustrates once again that you can create several instances of the same class: 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



180 



public class RollTwoPairs { 

public static void main (String [] args) { 

PairOfDice firstDice; // Refers to the first pair of dice. 
firstDice = new PairOf DiceO ; 

PairOfDice secondDice; // Refers to the second pair of dice. 
secondDice = new PairOf Dice () ; 

int countRolls; // Counts how many times the two pairs of 
// dice have been rolled. 

int totall; // Total showing on first pair of dice, 

int total2; // Total showing on second pair of dice. 

countRolls = 0; 

do { // Roll the two pairs of dice until totals are the same. 

firstDice . roll () ; // Roll the first pair of dice, 
totall = firstDice . diel + firstDice . die2 ; // Get total. 
System. out .printlnC'First pair comes up " + totall); 

secondDice . roll () ; // Roll the second pair of dice. 
total2 = secondDice . diel + secondDice . die2 ; // Get total. 
System. out .printlnC Second pair comes up " + total2) ; 

countRolls++ ; // Count this roll. 

System. out .printlnO ; // Blank line. 

} while (totall != total2) ; 

System. out . printlnC It took " + countRolls 

+ " rolls until the totals were the same."); 

} // end mainO 
} // end class RollTwoPairs 

* * * 

Constructors are subroutines, but they are subroutines of a special type. They are certainly 
not instance methods, since they don't belong to objects. Since they are responsible for creating 
objects, they exist before any objects have been created. They are more like static member 
subroutines, but they are not and cannot be declared to be static. In fact, according to the 
Java language specification, they are technically not members of the class at all! In particular, 
constructors are not referred to as "methods." 

Unlike other subroutines, a constructor can only be called using the new operator, in an 
expression that has the form 

new (class-name) ( (parameter-list) ) 

where the (parameter-list) is possibly empty. I call this an expression because it computes and 
returns a value, namely a reference to the object that is constructed. Most often, you will store 
the returned reference in a variable, but it is also legal to use a constructor call in other ways, 
for example as a parameter in a subroutine call or as part of a more complex expression. Of 
course, if you don't save the reference in a variable, you won't have any way of referring to the 
object that was just created. 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



181 



A constructor call is more complicated than an ordinary subroutine or function call. It is 
helpful to understand the exact steps that the computer goes through to execute a constructor 
call: 

1. First, the computer gets a block of unused memory in the heap, large enough to hold an 
object of the specified type. 

2. It initializes the instance variables of the object. If the declaration of an instance variable 
specifies an initial value, then that value is computed and stored in the instance variable. 
Otherwise, the default initial value is used. 

3. The actual parameters in the constructor, if any, are evaluated, and the values are assigned 
to the formal parameters of the constructor. 

4. The statements in the body of the constructor, if any, are executed. 

5. A reference to the object is returned as the value of the constructor call. 

The end result of this is that you have a reference to a newly constructed object. You can 
use this reference to get at the instance variables in that object or to call its instance methods. 

* * * 

For another example, let's rewrite the Student class that was used in Section 1. I'll add a 
constructor, and I'll also take the opportunity to make the instance variable, name, private. 

public class Student { 

private String name; // Student's name, 

public double testl, test2, test3; // Grades on three tests. 

Student (String theName) { 

// Constructor for Student objects; 
// provides a name for the Student, 
name = theName ; 

} 

public String getNameQ { 

// Getter method for reading the value of the private 
// instance variable, name, 
return name ; 

} 

public double getAverageO { 

// Compute average test grade, 
return (testl + test2 + test3) / 3; 

> 

} // end of class Student 

An object of type Student contains information about some particular student. The con- 
structor in this class has a parameter of type String, which specifies the name of that student. 
Objects of type Student can be created with statements such as: 

std = new Student ( "John Smith"); 
stdl = new Student ("Mary Jones"); 



In the original version of this class, the value of name had to be assigned by a program after 
it created the object of type Student. There was no guarantee that the programmer would 
always remember to set the name properly. In the new version of the class, there is no way to 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



182 



create a Student object except by calling the constructor, and that constructor automatically 
sets the name. The programmer's life is made easier, and whole hordes of frustrating bugs are 
squashed before they even have a chance to be born. 

Another type of guarantee is provided by the private modifier. Since the instance variable, 
name, is private, there is no way for any part of the program outside the Student class to get at 
the name directly. The program sets the value of name, indirectly, when it calls the constructor. 
I've provided a getter function, getNameO, that can be used from outside the class to find out 
the name of the student. But I haven't provided any setter method or other way to change the 
name. Once a student object is created, it keeps the same name as long as it exists. (It would 
be legal to declare the variable name to be "final" in this class. An instance variable can be 
final provided it is either assigned a value in its declaration or is assigned a value in every 
constructor in the class. It is illegal to assign a value to a final instance variable, except inside 
a constructor.) 

5.2.3 Garbage Collection 

So far, this section has been about creating objects. What about destroying them? In Java, 
the destruction of objects takes place automatically. 

An object exists in the heap, and it can be accessed only through variables that hold 
references to the object. What should be done with an object if there are no variables that 
refer to it? Such things can happen. Consider the following two statements (though in reality, 
you'd never do anything like this in consecutive statements): 

Student std = new Student ("John Smith"); 
std = null; 

In the first line, a reference to a newly created Student object is stored in the variable std. 
But in the next line, the value of std is changed, and the reference to the Student object is 
gone. In fact, there are now no references whatsoever to that object, in any variable. So there 
is no way for the program ever to use the object again! It might as well not exist. In fact, the 
memory occupied by the object should be reclaimed to be used for another purpose. 

Java uses a procedure called garbage collection to reclaim memory occupied by objects 
that are no longer accessible to a program. It is the responsibility of the system, not the 
programmer, to keep track of which objects are "garbage." In the above example, it was very 
easy to see that the Student object had become garbage. Usually, it's much harder. If an 
object has been used for a while, there might be several references to the object stored in several 
variables. The object doesn't become garbage until all those references have been dropped. 

In many other programming languages, it's the programmer's responsibility to delete the 
garbage. Unfortunately, keeping track of memory usage is very error-prone, and many serious 
program bugs are caused by such errors. A programmer might accidently delete an object even 
though there are still references to that object. This is called a dangling pointer error, and 
it leads to problems when the program tries to access an object that is no longer there. Another 
type of error is a memory leak, where a programmer neglects to delete objects that are no 
longer in use. This can lead to filling memory with objects that are completely inaccessible, 
and the program might run out of memory even though, in fact, large amounts of memory are 
being wasted. 

Because Java uses garbage collection, such errors are simply impossible. Garbage collection 
is an old idea and has been used in some programming languages since the 1960s. You might 
wonder why all languages don't use garbage collection. In the past, it was considered too slow 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



183 



and wasteful. However, research into garbage collection techniques combined with the incredible 
speed of modern computers have combined to make garbage collection feasible. Programmers 
should rejoice. 

5.3 Programming with Objects 

There are several ways in which object-oriented concepts can be applied to the process (online) 
of designing and writing programs. The broadest of these is object-oriented analysis and 
design which applies an object-oriented methodology to the earliest stages of program devel- 
opment, during which the overall design of a program is created. Here, the idea is to identify 
things in the problem domain that can be modeled as objects. On another level, object-oriented 
programming encourages programmers to produce generalized software components that 
can be used in a wide variety of programming projects. 

Of course, for the most part, you will experience "generalized software components" by 
using the standard classes that come along with Java. We begin this section by looking at some 
built-in classes that are used for creating objects. At the end of the section, we will get back 
to generalities. 

5.3.1 Some Built-in Classes 

Although the focus of object-oriented programming is generally on the design and implementa- 
tion of new classes, it's important not to forget that the designers of Java have already provided 
a large number of reusable classes. Some of these classes are meant to be extended to produce 
new classes, while others can be used directly to create useful objects. A true mastery of Java 
requires familiarity with a large number of built-in classes — something that takes a lot of time 
and experience to develop. In the next chapter, we will begin the study of Java's GUI classes, 
and you will encounter other built-in classes throughout the remainder of this book. But let's 
take a moment to look at a few built-in classes that you might find useful. 

A string can be built up from smaller pieces using the + operator, but this is not always effi- 
cient. If str is a String and ch is a character, then executing the command "str = str + ch;" 
involves creating a whole new string that is a copy of str, with the value of ch appended onto 
the end. Copying the string takes some time. Building up a long string letter by letter would 
require a surprising amount of processing. The class StringBuffer makes it possible to be effi- 
cient about building up a long string from a number of smaller pieces. To do this, you must 
make an object belonging to the StringBufFer class. For example: 

StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuf f er () ; 

(This statement both declares the variable buffer and initializes it to refer to a newly created 
StringBuffer object. Combining declaration with initialization was covered in Subsection 4.7.1 
and works for objects just as it does for primitive types.) 

Like a String, a StringBuffer contains a sequence of characters. However, it is possible to 
add new characters onto the end of a StringBuffer without making a copy of the data that 
it already contains. If x is a value of any type and buffer is the variable defined above, then 
the command buf f er . append(x) will add x, converted into a string representation, onto the 
end of the data that was already in the buffer. This command actually modifies the buffer, 
rather than making a copy, and that can be done efficiently. A long string can be built up 
in a StringBuffer using a sequence of append () commands. When the string is complete, the 
function buf f er . toStringO will return a copy of the string in the buffer as an ordinary value 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



184 



of type String. The StringBuffer class is in the standard package java.lang, so you can use its 
simple name without importing it. 

A number of useful classes are collected in the package java.util. For example, this 
package contains classes for working with collections of objects. We will encounter an example 
in Section 5.5, and we will study the collection classes extensively in Chapter 10. Another class 
in this package, java.util .Date, is used to represent times. When a Date object is constructed 
without parameters, the result represents the current date and time, so an easy way to display 
this information is: 

System, out .println( new DateO ); 

Of course, since it is in the package java.util, in order to use the Date class in 
your program, you must make it available by importing it with one of the statements 
"import java.util. Date;" or "import java.util.*;" at the beginning of your program. 
(See Subsection 4.5.3 for a discussion of packages and import.) 

I will also mention the class java.util .Random. An object belonging to this class is a 
source of random numbers (or, more precisely pseudorandom numbers). The standard function 
Math. random () uses one of these objects behind the scenes to generate its random numbers. 
An object of type Random can generate random integers, as well as random real numbers. If 
randGen is created with the command: 

Random randGen = new Random () ; 

and if N is a positive integer, then randGen . nextlnt (N) generates a random integer in the range 
from to N-l. For example, this makes it a little easier to roll a pair of dice. Instead of say- 
ing "die 1 = (int) (6*Math.random())+l;", one can say "diel = randGen.nextInt(6)+l;". 
(Since you also have to import the class java.util .Random and create the Random object, you 
might not agree that it is actually easier.) An object of type Random can also be used to generate 
so-called Gaussian distributed random real numbers. 

The main point here, again, is that many problems have already been solved, and the 
solutions are available in Java's standard classes. If you are faced with a task that looks like 
it should be fairly common, it might be worth looking through a Java reference to see whether 
someone has already written a class that you can use. 

5.3.2 Wrapper Classes and Autoboxing 

We have already encountered the classes Double and Integer in Subsection 2.5.7. These classes 
contain the static methods Double .parseDouble and Integer .parselnteger that are used 
to convert strings to numerical values. We have also encountered the Character class in some 
examples, with static methods such as Character . isLetter, which can be used to test whether 
a given value of type char is a letter. There is a similar class for each of the other primitive types, 
Long, Short, Byte, Float, and Boolean. These classes are called wrapper classes. Although 
they contain useful static members, they have another use as well: They are used for creating 
objects that represent primitive type values. 

Remember that the primitive types are not classes, and values of primitive type are not 
objects. However, sometimes it's useful to treat a primitive value as if it were an object. You 
can't do that literally, but you can "wrap" the primitive type value in an object belonging to 
one of the wrapper classes. 

For example, an object of type Double contains a single instance variable, of type double. 
The object is a wrapper for the double value. For example, you can create an object that wraps 
the double value 6.0221415e23 with 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



185 



Double d = new Double (6 . 0221415e23) ; 

The value of d contains the same information as the value of type double, but it is an object. If 
you want to retrieve the double value that is wrapped in the object, you can call the function 
d.doubleValue(). Similarly, you can wrap an int in an object of type Integer, a boolean value 
in an object of type Boolean, and so on. (As an example of where this would be useful, the 
collection classes that will be studied in Chapter 10 can only hold objects. If you want to add 
a primitive type value to a collection, it has to be put into a wrapper object first.) 

Since Java 5.0, wrapper classes have been even easier to use. Java 5.0 introduced automatic 
conversion between a primitive type and the corresponding wrapper class. For example, if 
you use a value of type int in a context that requires an object of type Integer, the int will 
automatically be wrapped in an Integer object. For example, you can say 

Integer answer = 42; 
and the computer will silently read this as if it were 

Integer answer = new Integer (42); 

This is called autoboxing. It works in the other direction, too. For example, if d refers to an 
object of type Double, you can use d in a numerical expression such as 2*d. The double value 
inside d is automatically unboxed and multiplied by 2. Autoboxing and unboxing also apply 
to subroutine calls. For example, you can pass an actual parameter of type int to a subroutine 
that has a formal parameter of type Integer. In fact, autoboxing and unboxing make it possible 
in many circumstances to ignore the difference between primitive types and objects. 

* * * 

The wrapper classes contain a few other things that deserve to be mentioned. Integer, for 
example, contains constants Integer .MIN_VALUE and Integer .MAX_VALUE, which are equal to 
the largest and smallest possible values of type int, that is, to -2147483648 and 2147483647 
respectively. It's certainly easier to remember the names than the numerical values. There are 
similar named constants in Long, Short, and Byte. Double and Float also have constants named 
MIN.VALUE and MAX.VALUE. MAX_VALUE still gives the largest number that can be represented 
in the given type, but MIN.VALUE represents the smallest possible positive value. For type 
double, Double . MIN_VALUE is 4.9 times 10~ 324 . Since double values have only a finite accuracy, 
they can't get arbitrarily close to zero. This is the closest they can get without actually being 
equal to zero. 

The class Double deserves special mention, since doubles are so much more complicated than 
integers. The encoding of real numbers into values of type double has room for a few special val- 
ues that are not real numbers at all in the mathematical sense. These values are given by named 
constants in class Double: Double .POSITIVE.INFINITY, Double . NEGATIVE_INFINITY, and 
Double . NaN. The infinite values can occur as the values of certain mathematical expressions. For 
example, dividing a positive number by zero will give the result Double. POSITIVE.INFINITY. 
(It's even more complicated than this, actually, because the double type includes a value 
called "negative zero", written -0.0. Dividing a positive number by negative zero gives 
Double. NEGATIVE_INFINITY.) You also get Double . P0SITIVE_INFINITY whenever the mathe- 
matical value of an expression is greater than Double . MAX_VALUE. For example, Ie200*le200 
is considered to be infinite. The value Double . NaN is even more interesting. "NaN" stands for 
Not a Number, and it represents an undefined value such as the square root of a negative 
number or the result of dividing zero by zero. Because of the existence of Double . NaN, no math- 
ematical operation on real numbers will ever throw an exception; it simply gives Double. NaN 
as the result. 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



186 



You can test whether a value, x, of type double is infinite or undefined by calling the 
boolean- valued static functions Double . islnf inite (x) and Double . isNaM(x) . (It's especially 
important to use Double . isNaNQ to test for undefined values, because Double. NaN has re- 
ally weird behavior when used with relational operators such as ==. In fact, the values of 
x == Double. NaN and x != Double. NaN are always both false — no matter what the value 
of x is — so you can't use these expressions to test whether x is Double. NaN.) 

5.3.3 The class "Object" 

We have already seen that one of the major features of object-oriented programming is the 
ability to create subclasses of a class. The subclass inherits all the properties or behaviors of 
the class, but can modify and add to what it inherits. In Section 5.5, you'll learn how to create 
subclasses. What you don't know yet is that every class in Java (with just one exception) is 
a subclass of some other class. If you create a class and don't explicitly make it a subclass of 
some other class, then it automatically becomes a subclass of the special class named Object. 
(Object is the one class that is not a subclass of any other class.) 

Class Object defines several instance methods that are inherited by every other class. These 
methods can be used with any object whatsoever. I will mention just one of them here. You 
will encounter more of them later in the book. 

The instance method toStringO in class Object returns a value of type String that is 
supposed to be a string representation of the object. You've already used this method implicitly, 
any time you've printed out an object or concatenated an object onto a string. When you use 
an object in a context that requires a string, the object is automatically converted to type 
String by calling its toStringO method. 

The version of toString that is defined in Object just returns the name of the class that 
the object belongs to, concatenated with a code number called the hash code of the object; 
this is not very useful. When you create a class, you can write a new toStringO method for 
it, which will replace the inherited version. For example, we might add the following method 
to any of the PairOfDice classes from the previous section: 

/** 

* Return a String representation of a pair of dice, where diel 

* and die2 are instance variables containing the numbers that are 

* showing on the two dice. 
*/ 

public String toStringO { 
if (diel == die2) 

return "double " + diel; 
else 

return diel + " and " + die2; 

} 

If dice refers to a PairOfDice object, then dice . toStringO will return strings such as 
"3 and 6", "5 and 1", and "double 2", depending on the numbers showing on the dice. This 
method would be used automatically to convert dice to type String in a statement such as 

System. out .println( "The dice came up " + dice ); 

so this statement might output, "The dice came up 5 and 1" or "The dice came up double 2". 
You'll see another example of a toStringO method in the next section.

5.3.4 Object-oriented Analysis and Design 

Every programmer builds up a stock of techniques and expertise expressed as snippets of code 
that can be reused in new programs using the tried-and-true method of cut-and-paste: The old 
code is physically copied into the new program and then edited to customize it as necessary. 
The problem is that the editing is error-prone and time-consuming, and the whole enterprise is 
dependent on the programmer's ability to pull out that particular piece of code from last year's 
project that looks like it might be made to fit. (On the level of a corporation that wants to 
save money by not reinventing the wheel for each new project, just keeping track of all the old 
wheels becomes a major task.) 

Well-designed classes are software components that can be reused without editing. A well- 
designed class is not carefully crafted to do a particular job in a particular program. Instead, 
it is crafted to model some particular type of object or a single coherent concept. Since objects 
and concepts can recur in many problems, a well-designed class is likely to be reusable without 
modification in a variety of projects. 

Furthermore, in an object-oriented programming language, it is possible to make subclasses 
of an existing class. This makes classes even more reusable. If a class needs to be customized, 
a subclass can be created, and additions or modifications can be made in the subclass without 
making any changes to the original class. This can be done even if the programmer doesn't 
have access to the source code of the class and doesn't know any details of its internal, hidden 
implementation. 

* * * 

The PairOfDice class in the previous section is already an example of a generalized software 
component, although one that could certainly be improved. The class represents a single, 
coherent concept, "a pair of dice." The instance variables hold the data relevant to the state 
of the dice, that is, the number showing on each of the dice. The instance method represents 
the behavior of a pair of dice, that is, the ability to be rolled. This class would be reusable in 
many different programming projects. 

On the other hand, the Student class from the previous section is not very reusable. It 
seems to be crafted to represent students in a particular course where the grade will be based 
on three tests. If there are more tests or quizzes or papers, it's useless. If there are two people 
in the class who have the same name, we are in trouble (one reason why numerical student ID's 
are often used). Admittedly, it's much more difficult to develop a general-purpose student class 
than a general-purpose pair-of-dice class. But this particular Student class is good mostly as 
an example in a programming textbook. 

* * * 

A large programming project goes through a number of stages, starting with specification 
of the problem to be solved, followed by analysis of the problem and design of a program 
to solve it. Then comes coding, in which the program's design is expressed in some actual 
programming language. This is followed by testing and debugging of the program. After that 
comes a long period of maintenance, which means fixing any new problems that are found 
in the program and modifying it to adapt it to changing requirements. Together, these stages 
form what is called the software life cycle. (In the real world, the ideal of consecutive stages 
is seldom if ever achieved. During the analysis stage, it might turn out that the specifications 
are incomplete or inconsistent. A problem found during testing requires at least a brief return 
to the coding stage. If the problem is serious enough, it might even require a new design. 
Maintenance usually involves redoing some of the work from previous stages. . . .) 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



188 



Large, complex programming projects are only likely to succeed if a careful, systematic 
approach is adopted during all stages of the software life cycle. The systematic approach to 
programming, using accepted principles of good design, is called software engineering. The 
software engineer tries to efficiently construct programs that verifiably meet their specifications 
and that are easy to modify if necessary. There is a wide range of "methodologies" that can 
be applied to help in the systematic design of programs. (Most of these methodologies seem to 
involve drawing little boxes to represent program components, with labeled arrows to represent 
relationships among the boxes.) 

We have been discussing object orientation in programming languages, which is relevant to 
the coding stage of program development. But there are also object-oriented methodologies for 
analysis and design. The question in this stage of the software life cycle is, How can one discover 
or invent the overall structure of a program? As an example of a rather simple object-oriented 
approach to analysis and design, consider this advice: Write down a description of the problem. 
Underline all the nouns in that description. The nouns should be considered as candidates for 
becoming classes or objects in the program design. Similarly, underline all the verbs. These 
are candidates for methods. This is your starting point. Further analysis might uncover the 
need for more classes and methods, and it might reveal that subclassing can be used to take 
advantage of similarities among classes. 

This is perhaps a bit simple-minded, but the idea is clear and the general approach can be 
effective: Analyze the problem to discover the concepts that are involved, and create classes to 
represent those concepts. The design should arise from the problem itself, and you should end 
up with a program whose structure reflects the structure of the problem in a natural way. 

5.4 Programming Example: Card, Hand, Deck 

In this section, we look at some specific examples of object-oriented design in a domain that 
is simple enough that we have a chance of coming up with something reasonably reusable. 
Consider card games that are played with a standard deck of playing cards (a so-called "poker" 
deck, since it is used in the game of poker) . 

5.4.1 Designing the classes 

In a typical card game, each player gets a hand of cards. The deck is shuffled and cards are 
dealt one at a time from the deck and added to the players' hands. In some games, cards can 
be removed from a hand, and new cards can be added. The game is won or lost depending 
on the value (ace, 2, . . . , king) and suit (spades, diamonds, clubs, hearts) of the cards that a 
player receives. If we look for nouns in this description, there are several candidates for objects: 
game, player, hand, card, deck, value, and suit. Of these, the value and the suit of a card are 
simple values, and they might just be represented as instance variables in a Card object. In a 
complete program, the other five nouns might be represented by classes. But let's work on the 
ones that are most obviously reusable: card, hand, and deck. 

If we look for verbs in the description of a card game, we see that we can shuffle a deck and 
deal a card from a deck. This gives use us two candidates for instance methods in a Deck class: 
shuffle () and dealCardQ . Cards can be added to and removed from hands. This gives two 
candidates for instance methods in a Hand class: addCardO and removeCardO . Cards are 
relatively passive things, but we need to be able to determine their suits and values. We will 
discover more instance methods as we go along. 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



189 



First, we'll design the deck class in detail. When a deck of cards is first created, it contains 
52 cards in some standard order. The Deck class will need a constructor to create a new deck. 
The constructor needs no parameters because any new deck is the same as any other. There will 
be an instance method called shuffle () that will rearrange the 52 cards into a random order. 
The dealCardO instance method will get the next card from the deck. This will be a function 
with a return type of Card, since the caller needs to know what card is being dealt. It has no 
parameters — when you deal the next card from the deck, you don't provide any information to 
the deck; you just get the next card, whatever it is. What will happen if there are no more 
cards in the deck when its dealCardO method is called? It should probably be considered an 
error to try to deal a card from an empty deck, so the deck can throw an exception in that case. 
But this raises another question: How will the rest of the program know whether the deck is 
empty? Of course, the program could keep track of how many cards it has used. But the deck 
itself should know how many cards it has left, so the program should just be able to ask the 
deck object. We can make this possible by specifying another instance method, cardsLef t () , 
that returns the number of cards remaining in the deck. This leads to a full specification of all 
the subroutines in the Deck class: 

Constructor and instance methods in class Deck: 

/** 

* Constructor. Create an unshuffled deck of cards. 
*/ 

public DeckO 
/** 

* Put all the used cards back into the deck, 

* and shuffle it into a random order. 
*/ 

public void shuffleO 
/** 

* As cards are dealt from the deck, the number of 

* cards left decreases . This function returns the 

* number of cards that are still left in the deck. 
*/ 

public int cardsLef t() 
/** 

* Deals one card from the deck and returns it. 

* Othrows IllegalStateException if no more cards are left. 
*/ 

public Card dealCardO 

This is everything you need to know in order to use the Deck class. Of course, it doesn't tell 
us how to write the class. This has been an exercise in design, not in coding. In fact, writing 
the class involves a programming technique, arrays, which will not be covered until Chapter 7. 
Nevertheless, you can look at the source code, Deck.java, if you want. Even though you won't 
understand the implementation, the Javadoc comments give you all the information that you 
need to understand the interface. With this information, you can use the class in your programs 
without understanding the implementation. 

We can do a similar analysis for the Hand class. When a hand object is first created, it 
has no cards in it. An addCardO instance method will add a card to the hand. This method 
needs a parameter of type Card to specify which card is being added. For the removeCardO 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



190 



method, a parameter is needed to specify which card to remove. But should we specify the 
card itself ("Remove the ace of spades"), or should we specify the card by its position in the 
hand ("Remove the third card in the hand")? Actually, we don't have to decide, since we can 
allow for both options. We'll have two removeCardO instance methods, one with a parameter 
of type Card specifying the card to be removed and one with a parameter of type int specifying 
the position of the card in the hand. (Remember that you can have two methods in a class 
with the same name, provided they have different numbers or types of parameters.) Since a 
hand can contain a variable number of cards, it's convenient to be able to ask a hand object 
how many cards it contains. So, we need an instance method getCardCount () that returns 
the number of cards in the hand. When I play cards, I like to arrange the cards in my hand so 
that cards of the same value are next to each other. Since this is a generally useful thing to be 
able to do, we can provide instance methods for sorting the cards in the hand. Here is a full 
specification for a reusable Hand class: 

Constructor and instance methods in class Hand: 

/** 

* Constructor. Create a Hand object that is initially empty. 
*/ 

public HandO 
/** 

* Discard all cards from the hand, making the hand empty. 
*/ 

public void clear () 
/** 

* Add the card c to the hand. c should be non-null. 

* Qthrows NullPointerException if c is null. 
*/ 

public void addCard(Card c) 
/** 

* If the specified card is in the hand, it is removed. 
*/ 

public void removeCard(Card c) 
/** 

* Remove the card in the specified position from the 

* hand. Cards are numbered counting from zero. 

* Qthrows IllegalArgumentException if the specified 

* position does not exist in the hand. 
*/ 

public void removeCard(int position) 
/** 

* Return the number of cards in the hand. 
*/ 

public int getCardCount () 
/** 

* Get the card from the hand in given position, where 

* positions are numbered starting from 0. 

* Othrows IllegalArgumentException if the specified 

* position does not exist in the hand. 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



191 



*/ 

public Card getCard(int position) 
/** 

* Sorts the cards in the hand so that cards of the same 

* suit are grouped together, and within a suit the cards 

* are sorted by value . 
*/ 

public void sortBySuitO 
/** 

* Sorts the cards in the hand so that cards are sorted into 

* order of increasing value. Cards with the same value 

* are sorted by suit. Note that aces are considered 

* to have the lowest value. 
*/ 

public void sortByValue () 

Again, you don't yet know enough to implement this class. But given the source code, 
Hand.java, you can use the class in your own programming projects. 

5.4.2 The Card Class 

We have covered enough material to write a Card class. The class will have a constructor 
that specifies the value and suit of the card that is being created. There are four suits, which 
can be represented by the integers 0, 1, 2, and 3. It would be tough to remember which 
number represents which suit, so I've defined named constants in the Card class to represent 
the four possibilities. For example, Card. SPADES is a constant that represents the suit, spades. 
(These constants are declared to be public final static ints. It might be better to use 
an enumerated type, but for now we will stick to integer-valued constants. I'll return to the 
question of using enumerated types in this example at the end of the chapter.) The possible 
values of a card are the numbers 1,2,..., 13, with 1 standing for an ace, 11 for a jack, 12 for 
a queen, and 13 for a king. Again, I've defined some named constants to represent the values 
of aces and face cards. (When you read the Card class, you'll see that I've also added support 
for Jokers.) 

A Card object can be constructed knowing the value and the suit of the card. For example, 
we can call the constructor with statements such as: 

cardl = new Card( Card. ACE, Card. SPADES ); // Construct ace of spades. 
card2 = new Card( 10, Card. DIAMONDS ); // Construct 10 of diamonds. 
card3 = new Card( v, s ); // This is OK, as long as v and s 

// are integer expressions. 

A Card object needs instance variables to represent its value and suit. I've made these 
private so that they cannot be changed from outside the class, and I've provided getter methods 
getSuit () and getValue () so that it will be possible to discover the suit and value from outside 
the class. The instance variables are initialized in the constructor, and are never changed after 
that. In fact, I've declared the instance variables suit and value to be final, since they are 
never changed after they are initialized. (An instance variable can be declared final provided 
it is either given an initial value in its declaration or is initialized in every constructor in the 
class.) 

Finally, I've added a few convenience methods to the class to make it easier to print out 
cards in a human-readable form. For example, I want to be able to print out the suit of a 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



192 



card as the word "Diamonds", rather than as the meaningless code number 2, which is used 
in the class to represent diamonds. Since this is something that I'll probably have to do in 
many programs, it makes sense to include support for it in the class. So, I've provided instance 
methods getSuitAsStringO and getValueAsStringO to return string representations of the 
suit and value of a card. Finally, I've defined the instance method toStringO to return a 
string with both the value and suit, such as "Queen of Hearts". Recall that this method will 
be used automatically whenever a Card needs to be converted into a String, such as when the 
card is concatenated onto a string with the + operator. Thus, the statement 

System. out .println( "Your card is the " + card ); 
is equivalent to 

System. out .println( "Your card is the " + card.toStringO ); 

If the card is the queen of hearts, either of these will print out "Your card is the Queen of 
Hearts" . 

Here is the complete Card class. It is general enough to be highly reusable, so the work that 
went into designing, writing, and testing it pays off handsomely in the long run. 

/** 

* An object of type Card represents a playing card from a 

* standard Poker deck, including Jokers. The card has a suit, which 

* can be spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs, or joker. A spade, heart, 

* diamond, or club has one of the 13 values: ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 

* 8, 9, 10, jack, queen, or king. Note that "ace" is considered to be 

* the smallest value. A joker can also have an associated value; 

* this value can be anything and can be used to keep track of several 

* different jokers.

5.4.3 Example: A Simple Card Game 

I will finish this section by presenting a complete program that uses the Card and Deck classes. 
The program lets the user play a very simple card game called HighLow. A deck of cards is 
shuffled, and one card is dealt from the deck and shown to the user. The user predicts whether 
the next card from the deck will be higher or lower than the current card. If the user predicts 
correctly, then the next card from the deck becomes the current card, and the user makes 
another prediction. This continues until the user makes an incorrect prediction. The number 
of correct predictions is the user's score. 

My program has a static method that plays one game of HighLow. This method has a 
return value that represents the user's score in the game. The main() routine lets the user play 
several games of HighLow. At the end, it reports the user's average score. 

I won't go through the development of the algorithms used in this program, but I encourage 
you to read it carefully and make sure that you understand how it works. Note in particular 
that the subroutine that plays one game of HighLow returns the user's score in the game as its 
return value. This gets the score back to the main program, where it is needed. Here is the 
program: 

/** 

* This program lets the user play HighLow, a simple card game 

* that is described in the output statements at the beginning of 

* the mainO routine. After the user plays several games, 

* the user's average score is reported.

A CLASS REPRESENTS A SET OF OBJECTS which share the same structure and behaviors. (online) 
The class determines the structure of objects by specifying variables that are contained in each 
instance of the class, and it determines behavior by providing the instance methods that express 
the behavior of the objects. This is a powerful idea. However, something like this can be done 
in most programming languages. The central new idea in object-oriented programming — the 
idea that really distinguishes it from traditional programming — is to allow classes to express 
the similarities among objects that share some, but not all, of their structure and behavior. 
Such similarities can be expressed using inheritance and polymorphism. 

5.5.1 Extending Existing Classes 

The topics covered in later subsections of this section are relatively advanced aspects of object- 
oriented programming. Any programmer should know what is meant by subclass, inheritance, 
and polymorphism. However, it will probably be a while before you actually do anything with 
inheritance except for extending classes that already exist. In the first part of this section, we 
look at how that is done. 

In day-to-day programming, especially for programmers who are just beginning to work 
with objects, subclassing is used mainly in one situation: There is an existing class that can be 
adapted with a few changes or additions. This is much more common than designing groups of 
classes and subclasses from scratch. The existing class can be extended to make a subclass. 
The syntax for this is 

public class {sub class -name) extends (existing-class-name) { 
// Changes and additions. 

} 

As an example, suppose you want to write a program that plays the card game, Blackjack. 
You can use the Card, Hand, and Deck classes developed in Section 5.4. However, a hand in the 
game of Blackjack is a little different from a hand of cards in general, since it must be possible 
to compute the "value" of a Blackjack hand according to the rules of the game. The rules are 
as follows: The value of a hand is obtained by adding up the values of the cards in the hand. 
The value of a numeric card such as a three or a ten is its numerical value. The value of a Jack, 
Queen, or King is 10. The value of an Ace can be either 1 or 11. An Ace should be counted 
as 11 unless doing so would put the total value of the hand over 21. Note that this means that 
the second, third, or fourth Ace in the hand will always be counted as 1. 

One way to handle this is to extend the existing Hand class by adding a method that 
computes the Blackjack value of the hand. Here's the definition of such a class: 

public class BlackjackHand extends Hand { 

/** 

* Computes and returns the value of this hand in the game 

* of Blackjack. 
*/ 

public int getBlackjackValueO { 

int val; // The value computed for the hand, 

boolean ace; // This will be set to true if the 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



199 



// hand contains an ace . 
int cards; // Number of cards in the hand. 

val = 0; 
ace = false; 

cards = getCardCount () ; // (method defined in class Hand.) 

for ( int i = 0; i < cards; i++ ) { 

// Add the value of the i-th card in the hand. 
Card card; // The i-th card; 

int cardVal; // The blackjack value of the i-th card, 
card = getCard(i) ; 

cardVal = card.getValueO ; // The normal value, 1 to 13. 
if (cardVal > 10) { 

cardVal =10; // For a Jack, Queen, or King. 

} 

if (cardVal == 1) { 

ace = true; // There is at least one ace. 

} 

val = val + cardVal ; 

} 

// Now, val is the value of the hand, counting any ace as 1. 
//If there is an ace, and if changing its value from 1 to 
// 11 would leave the score less than or equal to 21, 
// then do so by adding the extra 10 points to val. 

if ( ace == true && val + 10 <= 21 ) 
val = val + 10; 

return val ; 

} // end getBlackjackValueO 

} // end class BlackjackHand 

Since BlackjackHand is a subclass of Hand, an object of type BlackjackHand contains 
all the instance variables and instance methods defined in Hand, plus the new in- 
stance method named getBlackjackValueO. For example, if bjh is a variable of type 
BlackjackHand, then the following are all legal: bjh. getCardCount (), bjh.removeCard(O) , 
and bjh. getBlackjackValueO. The first two methods are defined in Hand, but are inherited 
by BlackjackHand. 

Variables and methods from the Hand class are inherited by BlackjackHand, and they can 
be used in the definition of BlackjackHand just as if they were actually defined in that class 
(except for any that are declared to be private, which prevents access even by subclasses). 
The statement "cards = getCardCount () ;" in the above definition of getBlackj ackValue () 
calls the instance method getCardCount () , which was defined in Hand. 

Extending existing classes is an easy way to build on previous work. We'll see that many 
standard classes have been written specifically to be used as the basis for making subclasses. 

* * * 

Access modifiers such as public and private are used to control access to members of a 
class. There is one more access modifier, protected, that comes into the picture when subclasses 
are taken into consideration. When protected is applied as an access modifier to a method or 
member variable in a class, that member can be used in subclasses — direct or indirect — of the 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



200 



class in which it is defined, but it cannot be used in non-subclasses. (There is an exception: 
A protected member can also be accessed by any class in the same package as the class that 
contains the protected member. Recall that using no access modifier makes a member accessible 
to classes in the same package, and nowhere else. Using the protected modifier is strictly more 
liberal than using no modifier at all: It allows access from classes in the same package and from 
subclasses that are not in the same package.) 

When you declare a method or member variable to be protected, you are saying that it 
is part of the implementation of the class, rather than part of the public interface of the class. 
However, you are allowing subclasses to use and modify that part of the implementation. 

For example, consider a PairOfDice class that has instance variables diel and die2 to 
represent the numbers appearing on the two dice. We could make those variables private to 
make it impossible to change their values from outside the class, while still allowing read access 
through getter methods. However, if we think it possible that PairOfDice will be used to create 
subclasses, we might want to make it possible for subclasses to change the numbers on the dice. 
For example, a GraphicalDice subclass that draws the dice might want to change the numbers 
at other times besides when the dice are rolled. In that case, we could make diel and die2 
protected, which would allow the subclass to change their values without making them public 
to the rest of the world. (An even better idea would be to define protected setter methods for 
the variables. A setter method could, for example, ensure that the value that is being assigned 
to the variable is in the legal range 1 through 6.) 

5.5.2 Inheritance and Class Hierarchy 

The term inheritance refers to the fact that one class can inherit part or all of its structure 
and behavior from another class. The class that does the inheriting is said to be a subclass of 
the class from which it inherits. If class B is a subclass of class A, we also say that class A is a 
superclass of class B. (Sometimes the terms derived class and base class are used instead 
of subclass and superclass; this is the common terminology in C++.) A subclass can add to the 
structure and behavior that it inherits. It can also replace or modify inherited behavior (though 
not inherited structure). The relationship between subclass and superclass is sometimes shown 
by a diagram in which the subclass is shown below, and connected to, its superclass, as shown 
on the left below: 



class A 
(superclass) 




class B 




class C 




class D 



class B 
(subclass) 



class E 



In Java, to create a class named "B" as a subclass of a class named "A" , you would write 
class B extends A { 



// additions to, and modifications of, 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



201 



// stuff inherited from class A 



} 



Several classes can be declared as subclasses of the same superclass. The subclasses, which 
might be referred to as "sibling classes," share some structures and behaviors — namely, the ones 
they inherit from their common superclass. The superclass expresses these shared structures 
and behaviors. In the diagram shown on the right above, classes B, C, and D are sibling classes. 
Inheritance can also extend over several "generations" of classes. This is shown in the diagram, 
where class E is a subclass of class D which is itself a subclass of class A. In this case, class E 
is considered to be a subclass of class A, even though it is not a direct subclass. This whole set 
of classes forms a small class hierarchy. 

5.5.3 Example: Vehicles 

Let's look at an example. Suppose that a program has to deal with motor vehicles, including 
cars, trucks, and motorcycles. (This might be a program used by a Department of Motor 
Vehicles to keep track of registrations.) The program could use a class named Vehicle to 
represent all types of vehicles. Since cars, trucks, and motorcycles are types of vehicles, they 
would be represented by subclasses of the Vehicle class, as shown in this class hierarchy diagram: 




Car 




Truck 




Motorcycle 



The Vehicle class would include instance variables such as registrationNumber and owner and 
instance methods such as transf erOwnershipO . These are variables and methods common 
to all vehicles. The three subclasses of Vehicle — Car, Truck, and Motorcycle — could then be 
used to hold variables and methods specific to particular types of vehicles. The Car class 
might add an instance variable numberOfDoors, the Truck class might have numberOf Axles, 
and the Motorcycle class could have a boolean variable hasSidecar. (Well, it could in theory 
at least, even if it might give a chuckle to the people at the Department of Motor Vehicles.) 
The declarations of these classes in a Java program would look, in outline, like this (although 
in practice, they would probably be public classes, defined in separate files): 

class Vehicle { 

int registrationNumber; 

Person owner; // (Assuming that a Person class has been defined!) 
void transf erOwnership (Person newOwner) { 



class Car extends Vehicle { 
int numberOfDoors ; 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



202 



} 

class Truck extends Vehicle { 
int numberOf Axles ; 

} 

class Motorcycle extends Vehicle { 
boolean hasSidecar; 

} 

Suppose that myCar is a variable of type Car that has been declared and initialized with the 
statement 

Car myCar = new Car(); 

Given this declaration, a program could refer to myCar. numberOf Doors, since numberOf Doors 
is an instance variable in the class Car. But since class Car extends class Vehicle, a car also 
has all the structure and behavior of a vehicle. This means that myCar . registrationNumber, 
myCar. owner, and myCar .transferOwnershipO also exist. 

Now, in the real world, cars, trucks, and motorcycles are in fact vehicles. The same is true 
in a program. That is, an object of type Car or Truck or Motorcycle is automatically an object 
of type Vehicle too. This brings us to the following Important Fact: 

A variable that can hold a reference 
to an object of class A can also hold a reference 
to an object belonging to any subclass of A. 

The practical effect of this in our example is that an object of type Car can be assigned to a 
variable of type Vehicle. That is, it would be legal to say 
Vehicle myVehicle = myCar; 

or even 

Vehicle myVehicle = new Car() ; 

After either of these statements, the variable myVehicle holds a reference to a Vehicle object 
that happens to be an instance of the subclass, Car. The object "remembers" that it is in fact 
a Car, and not just a Vehicle. Information about the actual class of an object is stored as part 
of that object. It is even possible to test whether a given object belongs to a given class, using 
the instanceof operator. The test: 

if (myVehicle instanceof Car) . . . 

determines whether the object referred to by myVehicle is in fact a car. 
On the other hand, the assignment statement 
myCar = myVehicle; 

would be illegal because myVehicle could potentially refer to other types of vehicles that are 
not cars. This is similar to a problem we saw previously in Subsection 2.5.6: The computer 
will not allow you to assign an int value to a variable of type short, because not every int is a 
short. Similarly, it will not allow you to assign a value of type Vehicle to a variable of type Car 
because not every vehicle is a car. As in the case of ints and shorts, the solution here is to use 
type-casting. If, for some reason, you happen to know that myVehicle does in fact refer to a 
Car, you can use the type cast (Car) myVehicle to tell the computer to treat myVehicle as if 
it were actually of type Car. So, you could say 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



203 



myCar = (Car)myVehicle ; 

and you could even refer to ( (Car)myVehicle) .numberOf Doors. (The parentheses are 
necessary because of precedence. The "." has higher precedence than the type-cast, so 
(Car)myVehicle .numberOf Doors would try to type-cast the int myVehicle .numberOf Doors 
into a Vehicle, which is impossible.) 

As an example of how this could be used in a program, suppose that you want to print out 
relevant data about the Vehicle referred to by myVehicle. If it's a car, you will want to print 
out the car's numberOf Doors, but you can't say myVehicle .numberOf Doors, since there is no 
numberOf Doors in the Vehicle class. But you could say: 

System. out .printlnC'Vehicle Data: ") ; 
System. out .println( "Registration number: " 

+ myVehicle . registrationNumber) ; 
if (myVehicle instanceof Car) { 

System. out .println( "Type of vehicle: Car"); 

Car c ; 

c = (Car) myVehicle ; // Type-cast to get access to numberOf Doors ! 
System. out .println( "Number of doors: " + c .numberOf Doors) ; 

} 

else if (myVehicle instanceof Truck) { 

System. out .println( "Type of vehicle: Truck"); 
Truck t ; 

t = (Truck)myVehicle ; // Type-cast to get access to numberOf Axles ! 
System. out .printlnC'Number of axles: " + t .numberOf Axles) ; 

} 

else if (myVehicle instanceof Motorcycle) { 

System. out .println( "Type of vehicle: Motorcycle"); 
Motorcycle m; 

m = (Motorcycle)myVehicle ; // Type-cast to get access to hasSidecar! 
System. out .println( "Has a sidecar: " + m. hasSidecar) ; 

} 

Note that for object types, when the computer executes a program, it checks whether 
type-casts are valid. So, for example, if myVehicle refers to an object of type Truck, then 
the type cast (Car)myVehicle would be an error. When this happens, an exception of type 
ClassCastException is thrown. This check is done at run time, not compile time, because the 
actual type of the object referred to by myVehicle is not known when the program is compiled. 

5.5.4 Polymorphism 

As another example, consider a program that deals with shapes drawn on the screen. Let's say 
that the shapes include rectangles, ovals, and roundrects of various colors. (A "roundrect" is 
just a rectangle with rounded corners.) 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



204 




o 






Rectangles 



Ovals 



RoundRects 



Three classes, Rectangle, Oval, and RoundRect, could be used to represent the three types of 
shapes. These three classes would have a common superclass, Shape, to represent features that 
all three shapes have in common. The Shape class could include instance variables to represent 
the color, position, and size of a shape, and it could include instance methods for changing the 
color, position, and size. Changing the color, for example, might involve changing the value of 
an instance variable, and then redrawing the shape in its new color: 

class Shape { 



Color color; // Color of the shape. (Recall that class Color 
// is defined in package java.awt. Assume 
// that this class has been imported.) 

void setColor (Color newColor) { 

// Method to change the color of the shape, 
color = newColor; // change value of instance variable 
redrawO ; // redraw shape, which will appear in new color 



} // end of class Shape 

Now, you might see a problem here with the method redraw (). The problem is that each 
different type of shape is drawn differently. The method setColor () can be called for any type 
of shape. How does the computer know which shape to draw when it executes the redraw ()? 
Informally, we can answer the question like this: The computer executes redraw () by asking 
the shape to redraw itself. Every shape object knows what it has to do to redraw itself. 

In practice, this means that each of the specific shape classes has its own redraw () method: 

class Rectangle extends Shape { 



> 



void redraw () { 

// method for drawing the shape 
? ? ? // what commands should go here? 

> 



// more instance variables and methods 



void redrawO { 



// commands for drawing a rectangle 



> 



. // possibly, more methods and variables 



} 



class Oval extends Shape { 
void redrawO { 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



205 



. . . // commands for drawing an oval 

} 

. . . // possibly, more methods and variables 

} 

class RoundRect extends Shape { 
void redraw () { 

. . . // commands for drawing a rounded rectangle 

} 

. . . // possibly, more methods and variables 

} 

If oneShape is a variable of type Shape, it could refer to an object of any of the types 
Rectangle, Oval, or RoundRect. As a program executes, and the value of oneShape changes, it 
could even refer to objects of different types at different times! Whenever the statement 

oneShape . redraw ( ) ; 

is executed, the redraw method that is actually called is the one appropriate for the type of 
object to which oneShape actually refers. There may be no way of telling, from looking at the 
text of the program, what shape this statement will draw, since it depends on the value that 
oneShape happens to have when the program is executed. Even more is true. Suppose the 
statement is in a loop and gets executed many times. If the value of oneShape changes as the 
loop is executed, it is possible that the very same statement "oneShape . redraw () ;" will call 
different methods and draw different shapes as it is executed over and over. We say that the 
redraw () method is polymorphic. A method is polymorphic if the action performed by the 
method depends on the actual type of the object to which the method is applied. Polymorphism 
is one of the major distinguishing features of object-oriented programming. 

Perhaps this becomes more understandable if we change our terminology a bit: In object- 
oriented programming, calling a method is often referred to as sending a message to an object. 
The object responds to the message by executing the appropriate method. The statement 
"oneShape . redraw () ;" is a message to the object referred to by oneShape. Since that object 
knows what type of object it is, it knows how it should respond to the message. From this point 
of view, the computer always executes "oneShape .redraw () ;" in the same way: by sending 
a message. The response to the message depends, naturally, on who receives it. From this 
point of view, objects are active entities that send and receive messages, and polymorphism is 
a natural, even necessary, part of this view. Polymorphism just means that different objects 
can respond to the same message in different ways. 

One of the most beautiful things about polymorphism is that it lets code that you write do 
things that you didn't even conceive of, at the time you wrote it. Suppose that I decide to add 
beveled rectangles to the types of shapes my program can deal with. A beveled rectangle has 
a triangle cut off each corner: 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



206 




BeveledRects 

To implement beveled rectangles, I can write a new subclass, BeveledRect, of class Shape 
and give it its own redraw () method. Automatically, code that I wrote previously — such as 
the statement oneShape . redraw () — can now suddenly start drawing beveled rectangles, even 
though the beveled rectangle class didn't exist when I wrote the statement! 

In the statement "oneShape. redrawO ;", the redraw message is sent to the object 
oneShape. Look back at the method in the Shape class for changing the color of a shape: 

void setColor (Color newColor) { 

color = newColor; // change value of instance variable 
redrawO; // redraw shape, which will appear in new color 

} 

A redraw message is sent here, but which object is it sent to? Well, the setColor method is 
itself a message that was sent to some object. The answer is that the redraw message is sent to 
that same object, the one that received the setColor message. If that object is a rectangle, 
then it contains a redrawO method for drawing rectangles, and that is the one that is executed. 
If the object is an oval, then it is the redrawO method from the Oval class. This is what you 
should expect, but it means that the "redrawO ;" statement in the setColor () method does 
not necessarily call the redrawO method in the Shape class! The redrawO method that is 
executed could be in any subclass of Shape. This is just another case of polymorphism. 

Again, this is not a real surprise if you think about it in the right way. Remember that 
an instance method is always contained in an object. The class only contains the source code 
for the method. When a Rectangle object is created, it contains a redrawO method. The 
source code for that method is in the Rectangle class. The object also contains a setColor () 
method. Since the Rectangle class does not define a setColor () method, the source code for 
the rectangle's setColor () method comes from the superclass, Shape, but the method itself 
is in the object of type Rectangle. Even though the source codes for the two methods are in 
different classes, the methods themselves are part of the same object. When the rectangle's 
setColor () method is executed and calls redrawO, the redrawO method that is executed is 
the one in the same object. 

5.5.5 Abstract Classes 

Whenever a Rectangle, Oval, or RoundRect object has to draw itself, it is the redrawO method in 
the appropriate class that is executed. This leaves open the question, What does the redrawO 
method in the Shape class do? How should it be defined? 

The answer may be surprising: We should leave it blank! The fact is that the class Shape 
represents the abstract idea of a shape, and there is no way to draw such a thing. Only 
particular, concrete shapes like rectangles and ovals can be drawn. So, why should there 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



207 



even be a redraw () method in the Shape class? Well, it has to be there, or it would be 
illegal to call it in the setColorQ method of the Shape class, and it would be illegal to write 
"oneShape . redraw () ;" . The compiler would complain that oneShape is a variable of type 
Shape and there's no redraw () method in the Shape class. 

Nevertheless the version of redraw () in the Shape class itself will never actually be called. 
In fact, if you think about it, there can never be any reason to construct an actual object of 
type Shape] You can have variables of type Shape, but the objects they refer to will always 
belong to one of the subclasses of Shape. We say that Shape is an abstract class. An abstract 
class is one that is not used to construct objects, but only as a basis for making subclasses. An 
abstract class exists only to express the common properties of all its subclasses. A class that 
is not abstract is said to be concrete. You can create objects belonging to a concrete class, 
but not to an abstract class. A variable whose type is given by an abstract class can only refer 
to objects that belong to concrete subclasses of the abstract class. 

Similarly, we say that the redraw () method in class Shape is an abstract method, since 
it is never meant to be called. In fact, there is nothing for it to do — any actual redrawing is 
done by redraw () methods in the subclasses of Shape. The redraw () method in Shape has 
to be there. But it is there only to tell the computer that all Shapes understand the redraw 
message. As an abstract method, it exists merely to specify the common interface of all the 
actual, concrete versions of redraw () in the subclasses. There is no reason for the abstract 
redraw () in class Shape to contain any code at all. 

Shape and its redraw () method are semantically abstract. You can also tell the computer, 
syntactically, that they are abstract by adding the modifier "abstract" to their definitions. 
For an abstract method, the block of code that gives the implementation of an ordinary method 
is replaced by a semicolon. An implementation must then be provided for the abstract method 
in any concrete subclass of the abstract class. Here's what the Shape class would look like as 
an abstract class: 

public abstract class Shape { 

Color color; // color of shape. 

void setColor (Color newColor) { 

// method to change the color of the shape 
color = newColor; // change value of instance variable 
redrawO ; // redraw shape, which will appear in new color 

> 

abstract void redraw (); 

// abstract method must be defined in 

// concrete subclasses 

. . . // more instance variables and methods 

} // end of class Shape 

Once you have declared the class to be abstract, it becomes illegal to try to create actual 
objects of type Shape, and the computer will report a syntax error if you try to do so. 

Note, by the way, that the Vehicle class discussed above would probably also be an abstract 
class. There is no way to own a vehicle as such — the actual vehicle has to be a car or a truck 
or a motorcycle, or some other "concrete" type of vehicle. 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



208 



Recall from Subsection 5.3.3 that a class that is not explicitly declared to be a subclass of 
some other class is automatically made a subclass of the standard class Object. That is, a class 
declaration with no "extends" part such as 

public class myClass { . . . 

is exactly equivalent to 

public class myClass extends Object { . . . 

This means that class Object is at the top of a huge class hierarchy that includes every 
other class. (Semantically, Object is an abstract class, in fact the most abstract class of all. 
Curiously, however, it is not declared to be abstract syntactically, which means that you can 
create objects of type Object. What you would do with them, however, I have no idea.) 

Since every class is a subclass of Object, a variable of type Object can refer to any object 
whatsoever, of any type. Java has several standard data structures that are designed to hold 
Objects, but since every object is an instance of class Object, these data structures can actually 
hold any object whatsoever. One example is the "ArrayList" data structure, which is defined by 
the class ArrayList in the package java.util. (ArrayList is discussed more fully in Section 7.3.) 
An ArrayList is simply a list of Objects. This class is very convenient, because an ArrayList can 
hold any number of objects, and it will grow, when necessary, as objects are added to it. Since 
the items in the list are of type Object, the list can actually hold objects of any type. 

A program that wants to keep track of various Shapes that have been drawn on the screen 
can store those shapes in an ArrayList. Suppose that the ArrayList is named listOf Shapes. A 
shape, such as oneShape, can be added to the end of the list by calling the instance method 
"listOf Shapes . add(oneShape) ;". The shape can be removed from the list with the instance 
method "listOf Shapes . remove (oneShape) ;". The number of shapes in the list is given by 
the function "listOf Shapes. size ()". And it is possible to retrieve the i-th object from the 
list with the function call "listOf Shapes . get (i)" . (Items in the list are numbered from to 
listOf Shapes . size() - 1.) However, note that this method returns an Object, not a Shape. 
(Of course, the people who wrote the ArrayList class didn't even know about Shapes, so the 
method they wrote could hardly have a return type of Shapel) Since you know that the items 
in the list are, in fact, Shapes and not just Objects, you can type-cast the Object returned by 
listOf Shapes, get (i) to be a value of type Shape: 

oneShape = (Shape) listOf Shapes . get (i) ; 

Let's say, for example, that you want to redraw all the shapes in the list. You could do 
this with a simple for loop, which is a lovely example of object-oriented programming and of 
polymorphism: 

for (int i = 0; i < listOf Shapes . size () ; i++) { 

Shape s; // i-th element of the list, considered as a Shape 
s = (Shape) listOf Shapes . get (i) ; 

s.redrawO; // What is drawn here depends on what type of shape s is! 

} 

* * * 

The sample source code file ShapeDraw.java uses an abstract Shape class and an ArrayList 
to hold a list of shapes. The file defines an applet in which the user can add various shapes to 
a drawing area. Once a shape is in the drawing area, the user can use the mouse to drag it 
around. 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



209 



You might want to look at this file, even though you won't be able to understand all of it 
at this time. Even the definitions of the shape classes are somewhat different from those that 
I have described in this section. (For example, the draw() method has a parameter of type 
Graphics. This parameter is required because of the way Java handles all drawing.) I'll return 
to similar examples in later chapters when you know more about GUI programming. However, 
it would still be worthwhile to look at the definition of the Shape class and its subclasses in the 
source code. You might also check how an ArrayList is used to hold the list of shapes. 

In the applet, the only time when the actual class of a shape is used is when that shape is 
added to the screen. Once the shape has been created, it is manipulated entirely as an abstract 
shape. The routine that implements dragging, for example, works with variables of type Shape 
and makes no reference to any of its subclasses. As the shape is being dragged, the dragging 
routine just calls the shape's draw method each time the shape has to be drawn, so it doesn't 
have to know how to draw the shape or even what type of shape it is. The object is responsible 
for drawing itself. If I wanted to add a new type of shape to the program, I would define a 
new subclass of Shape, add another button to the applet, and program the button to add the 
correct type of shape to the screen. No other changes in the programming would be necessary. 

If you want to try out the applet, you can find it at the end of the on-line version of this 
section. 

5.6 this and super 

Although the basic ideas of object-oriented programming are reasonably simple and clear, (online) 
they are subtle, and they take time to get used to. And unfortunately, beyond the basic ideas 
there are a lot of details. This section and the next cover more of those annoying details. You 
should not necessarily master everything in these two sections the first time through, but you 
should read it to be aware of what is possible. For the most part, when I need to use this 
material later in the text, I will explain it again briefly, or I will refer you back to it. In this 
section, we'll look at two variables, this and super, that are automatically defined in any 
instance method. 

5.6.1 The Special Variable this 

What does it mean when you use a simple identifier such as amount or process () to refer to a 
variable or method? The answer depends on scope rules that tell where and how each declared 
variable and method can be accessed in a program. Inside the definition of a method, a simple 
variable name might refer to a local variable or parameter, if there is one "in scope," that is, 
one whose declaration is in effect at the point in the source code where the reference occurs. If 
not, it must refer to a member variable of the class in which the reference occurs. Similarly, a 
simple method name must refer to a method in the same class. 

A static member of a class has a simple name that can only be used inside the class 
definition; for use outside the class, it has a full name of the form (class-name) .(simple-name) . 
For example, "Math. PI" is a static member variable with simple name "PI" in the class 11 Math" . 
It's always legal to use the full name of a static member, even within the class where it's defined. 
Sometimes it's even necessary, as when the simple name of a static member variable is hidden 
by a local variable or parameter of the same name. 

Instance variables and instance methods also have simple names. The simple name of such 
an instance member can be used in instance methods in the class where the instance member 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



210 



is defined (but not in static methods). Instance members also have full names — but remember 
that instance variables and methods are actually contained in objects, not classes. The full name 
of an instance member starts with a reference to the object that contains the instance member. 
For example, if std is a variable that refers to an object of type Student, then std.testl could 
be the full name of an instance variable named testl that is contained in that object. Inside 
the Student class, the same variable could be referred to simply as testl. But when just the 
simple name is used, where is the object that contains the variable? As an instance variable, 
testl is not a part of the Student class itself; any actual testl variable has to be contained in 
some object of type student. 

The solution to this riddle is simple: Suppose that the reference to "testl" occurs in 
the definition of some instance method. As with instance variables, only the definition of the 
instance method is in the class; the actual method that gets executed has to be thought of as 
belonging to some particular object of type Student. When that method gets executed, the 
occurrence of the name "testl" refers to the testl variable in that same object. (This 
is why simple names of instance members cannot be used in static methods — when a static 
method is executed, there is no object around and hence no actual instance members to refer 
to!) 

This leaves open the question of full names for instance members inside the same class 
where they are defined. We need a way to refer to "the object that contains this method." 
Java defines a special variable named this for just this purpose, which is used in the source 
code of an instance method to refer to the object that contains the method. This intent of 
the name, "this," is to refer to "this object," the one right here that this very method is in. 
If var is an instance variable in the same object as the method, then "this.var" is a full 
name for that variable. If otherMethodO is an instance method in the same object, then 
this . otherMethodO could be used to call that method. Whenever the computer executes an 
instance method, it automatically sets the variable this to refer to the object that contains the 
method. 

One common use of this is in constructors. For example: 

public class Student { 

private String name; // Name of the student. 

public Student (String name) { 

// Constructor. Create a student with specified name, 
this. name = name; 

> 

// More variables and methods. 

} 

In the constructor, the instance variable called name is hidden by a formal parameter. However, 
the instance variable can still be referred to by its full name, this. name. In the assignment 
statement "this. name = name", the value of the formal parameter, name, is assigned to the 
instance variable, this. name. This is considered to be acceptable style: There is no need 
to dream up cute new names for formal parameters that are just used to initialize instance 
variables. You can use the same name for the parameter as for the instance variable. 

There are other uses for this. Sometimes, when you are writing an instance method, you 
need to pass the object that contains the method to a subroutine, as an actual parameter. In 
that case, you can use this as the actual parameter. For example, if you wanted to print out a 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



211 



string representation of the object, you could say "System, out .print In (this) ; " . If you want 
to add it to an ArrayList 1st, you could say 1st . add(this) . Or you could assign the value of 
this to another variable in an assignment statement. In fact, you can do anything with this 
that you could do with any other variable, except change its value. 

5.6.2 The Special Variable super 

Java also defines another special variable, named "super", for use in the definitions of instance 
methods. The variable super is for use in a subclass. Like this, super refers to the object 
that contains the method. But it's forgetful. It forgets that the object belongs to the class you 
are writing, and it remembers only that it belongs to the superclass of that class. The point is 
that the class can contain additions and modifications to the superclass, super doesn't know 
about any of those additions and modifications; it can only be used to refer to methods and 
variables in the superclass. 

Let's say that the class that you are writing contains an instance method named 
doSomethingO . Consider the subroutine call statement super . doSomethingO . Now, super 
doesn't know anything about the doSomethingO method in the subclass. It only knows 
about things in the superclass, so it tries to execute a method named doSomethingO from 
the superclass. If there is none — if the doSomethingO method was an addition rather than a 
modification — you'll get a syntax error. 

The reason super exists is so you can get access to things in the superclass that are hidden 
by things in the subclass. For example, super . var always refers to an instance variable named 
var in the superclass. This can be useful for the following reason: If a class contains an instance 
variable with the same name as an instance variable in its superclass, then an object of that 
class will actually contain two variables with the same name: one defined as part of the class 
itself and one defined as part of the superclass. The variable in the subclass does not replace 
the variable of the same name in the superclass; it merely hides it. The variable from the 
superclass can still be accessed, using super. 

When you write a method in a subclass that has the same signature as a method in its 
superclass, the method from the superclass is hidden in the same way. We say that the method 
in the subclass overrides the method from the superclass. Again, however, super can be used 
to access the method from the superclass. 

The major use of super is to override a method with a new method that extends the 
behavior of the inherited method, instead of replacing that behavior entirely. The new method 
can use super to call the method from the superclass, and then it can add additional code to 
provide additional behavior. As an example, suppose you have a PairOfDice class that includes 
a roll() method. Suppose that you want a subclass, GraphicalDice, to represent a pair of 
dice drawn on the computer screen. The roll() method in the GraphicalDice class should do 
everything that the roll() method in the PairOfDice class does. We can express this with a 
call to super . roll () , which calls the method in the superclass. But in addition to that, the 
roll() method for a GraphicalDice object has to redraw the dice to show the new values. The 
GraphicalDice class might look something like this: 

public class GraphicalDice extends PairOfDice { 

public void rollO { 

// Roll the dice, and redraw them, 
super .roll () ; // Call the roll method from PairOfDice. 
redrawO ; // Call a method to draw the dice. 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



212 



} 

// More stuff, including definition of redraw () . 

} 

Note that this allows you to extend the behavior of the roll() method even if you don't know 
how the method is implemented in the superclass! 

Here is a more complete example. The applet at the end of Section 4.7 in the on-line version 
of this book shows a disturbance that moves around in a mosaic of little squares. As it moves, 
each square that it visits becomes a brighter shade of green. The result looks interesting, but 
I think it would be prettier if the pattern were symmetric. A symmetric version of the applet 
is shown at the bottom of Section 5.7 (the on-line version). The symmetric applet can be 
programmed as an easy extension of the original applet. 

In the symmetric version, each time a square is brightened, the squares that can be obtained 
from that one by horizontal and vertical reflection through the center of the mosaic are also 
brightened. This picture might make the symmetry idea clearer: 




The four red squares in the picture, for example, form a set of such symmetrically placed 
squares, as do the purple squares and the green squares. (The blue square is at the center of 
the mosaic, so reflecting it doesn't produce any other squares; it's its own reflection.) 

The original applet is defined by the class RandomBrighten. In that class, the actual task 
of brightening a square is done by a method called brightenQ. If row and col are the row 
and column numbers of a square, then "brighten (row, col) ;" increases the brightness of that 
square. All we need is a subclass of RandomBrighten with a modified brighten () routine. 
Instead of just brightening one square, the modified routine will also brighten the horizontal 
and vertical reflections of that square. But how will it brighten each of the four individual 
squares? By calling the brighten () method from the original class! It can do this by calling 
super . brighten () . 

There is still the problem of computing the row and column numbers of the horizontal 
and vertical reflections. To do this, you need to know the number of rows and the number 
of columns. The RandomBrighten class has instance variables named ROWS and COLUMNS to 
represent these quantities. Using these variables, it's possible to come up with formulas for the 
reflections, as shown in the definition of the brighten () method below. 

Here's the complete definition of the new class: 

public class SymmetricBrighten extends RandomBrighten { 
/** 

* Brighten the specified square, at position (row, col) and its 

* horizontal and vertical reflections. This overrides the 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



213 



* brightenO method from the RandomBrighten class, which just 

* brightens one square. 
*/ 

void brighten(int row, int col) { 
super .brighten (row, col); 
super .brighten (ROWS - 1 - row, col); 
super .brighten (row, COLUMNS - 1 - col); 
super .brighten (ROWS - 1 - row, COLUMNS - 1 - col); 

} 

} // end class SymmetricBrighten 
This is the entire source code for the applet! 

5.6.3 Constructors in Subclasses 

Constructors are not inherited. That is, if you extend an existing class to make a subclass, the 
constructors in the superclass do not become part of the subclass. If you want constructors in 
the subclass, you have to define new ones from scratch. If you don't define any constructors 
in the subclass, then the computer will make up a default constructor, with no parameters, for 
you. 

This could be a problem, if there is a constructor in the superclass that does a lot of 
necessary work. It looks like you might have to repeat all that work in the subclass! This could 
be a real problem if you don't have the source code to the superclass, and don't know how 
it works. It might look like an impossible problem, if the constructor in the superclass uses 
private member variables that you don't even have access to in the subclass! 

Obviously, there has to be some fix for this, and there is. It involves the special variable, 
super. As the very first statement in a constructor, you can use super to call a constructor 
from the superclass. The notation for this is a bit ugly and misleading, and it can only be used 
in this one particular circumstance: It looks like you are calling super as a subroutine (even 
though super is not a subroutine and you can't call constructors the same way you call other 
subroutines anyway). As an example, assume that the PairOfDice class has a constructor that 
takes two integers as parameters. Consider a subclass: 

public class GraphicalDice extends PairOfDice { 

public GraphicalDice () { // Constructor for this class. 

super(3,4); // Call the constructor from the 

// PairOfDice class, with parameters 3, 4. 

initializeGraphics () ; // Do some initialization specific 

// to the GraphicalDice class. 

} 

// More constructors, methods, variables... 

} 

The statement "super (3, 4) ;" calls the constructor from the superclass. This call must 
be the first line of the constructor in the subclass. Note that if you don't explicitly call a 
constructor from the superclass in this way, then the default constructor from the superclass, 
the one with no parameters, will be called automatically. (And if no such constructor exists in 
the superclass, the compiler will consider it to be a syntax error.) 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



214 



This might seem rather technical, but unfortunately it is sometimes necessary. By the way, 
you can use the special variable this in exactly the same way to call another constructor in the 
same class. This can be useful since it can save you from repeating the same code in several 
different constructors. 

5.7 Interfaces, Nested Classes, and Other Details 

THIS SECTION simply pulls together a few more miscellaneous features of object oriented 
programming in Java. Read it now, or just look through it and refer back to it later when you 
need this material. (You will need to know about the first topic, interfaces, almost as soon as 
we begin GUI programming.) 

5.7.1 Interfaces 

Some object-oriented programming languages, such as C++, allow a class to extend two or 
more superclasses. This is called multiple inheritance. In the illustration below, for example, 
class E is shown as having both class A and class B as direct superclasses, while class F has 
three direct superclasses. 




class F 



Multiple inheritance (NOT allowed in Java) 



Such multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java. The designers of Java wanted to keep the 
language reasonably simple, and felt that the benefits of multiple inheritance were not worth the 
cost in increased complexity. However, Java does have a feature that can be used to accomplish 
many of the same goals as multiple inheritance: interfaces. 

We've encountered the term "interface" before, in connection with black boxes in general and 
subroutines in particular. The interface of a subroutine consists of the name of the subroutine, 
its return type, and the number and types of its parameters. This is the information you need 
to know if you want to call the subroutine. A subroutine also has an implementation: the block 
of code which defines it and which is executed when the subroutine is called. 

In Java, interface is a reserved word with an additional, technical meaning. An 
"interface" in this sense consists of a set of instance method interfaces, without any as- 
sociated implementations. (Actually, a Java interface can contain other things as well, but we 
won't discuss them here.) A class can implement an interface by providing an implemen- 
tation for each of the methods specified by the interface. Here is an example of a very simple 
Java interface: 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



215 



public interface Drawable { 

public void draw(Graphics g) ; 

} 

This looks much like a class definition, except that the implementation of the draw() method is 
omitted. A class that implements the interface Drawable must provide an implementation for 
this method. Of course, the class can also include other methods and variables. For example, 

public class Line implements Drawable { 
public void draw (Graphics g) { 

. . . // do something presumably, draw a line 

} 

. . . // other methods and variables 

} 

Note that to implement an interface, a class must do more than simply provide an implemen- 
tation for each method in the interface; it must also state that it implements the interface, 
using the reserved word implements as in this example: "public class Line implements 
Drawable" . Any class that implements the Drawable interface defines a draw() instance method. 
Any object created from such a class includes a draw() method. We say that an object im- 
plements an interface if it belongs to a class that implements the interface. For example, any 
object of type Line implements the Drawable interface. 

While a class can extend only one other class, it can implement any number of interfaces. 
In fact, a class can both extend one other class and implement one or more interfaces. So, we 
can have things like 

class FilledCircle extends Circle 

implements Drawable, Fillable { 

} 

The point of all this is that, although interfaces are not classes, they are something very 
similar. An interface is very much like an abstract class, that is, a class that can never be used 
for constructing objects, but can be used as a basis for making subclasses. The subroutines 
in an interface are abstract methods, which must be implemented in any concrete class that 
implements the interface. You can compare the Drawable interface with the abstract class 

public abstract class AbstractDrawable -[ 
public abstract void draw(Graphics g) ; 

} 

The main difference is that a class that extends AbstractDrawable cannot extend any other 
class, while a class that implements Drawable can also extend some class. As with abstract 
classes, even though you can't construct an object from an interface, you can declare a variable 
whose type is given by the interface. For example, if Drawable is an interface, and if Line and 
FilledCircle are classes that implement Drawable, then you could say: 

Drawable figure; // Declare a variable of type Drawable. It can 
// refer to any object that implements the 
// Drawable interface. 

figure = new LineO; // figure now refers to an object of class Line 
f igure . draw(g) ; // calls drawO method from class Line 

figure = new FilledCircle () ; // Now, figure refers to an object 

// of class FilledCircle. 
f igure . draw (g) ; // calls drawO method from class FilledCircle 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



216 



A variable of type Drawable can refer to any object of any class that implements the Drawable 
interface. A statement like figure . draw(g) , above, is legal because figure is of type Drawable, 
and any Drawable object has a draw() method. So, whatever object figure refers to, that 
object must have a draw() method. 

Note that a type is something that can be used to declare variables. A type can also be 
used to specify the type of a parameter in a subroutine, or the return type of a function. In 
Java, a type can be either a class, an interface, or one of the eight built-in primitive types. 
These are the only possibilities. Of these, however, only classes can be used to construct new 
objects. 

You are not likely to need to write your own interfaces until you get to the point of writing 
fairly complex programs. However, there are several interfaces that are used in important ways 
in Java's standard packages. You'll learn about some of these standard interfaces in the next 
few chapters, and you will write classes that implement them. 

5.7.2 Nested Classes 

A class seems like it should be a pretty important thing. A class is a high-level building block 
of a program, representing a potentially complex idea and its associated data and behaviors. 
I've always felt a bit silly writing tiny little classes that exist only to group a few scraps of data 
together. However, such trivial classes are often useful and even essential. Fortunately, in Java, 
I can ease the embarrassment, because one class can be nested inside another class. My trivial 
little class doesn't have to stand on its own. It becomes part of a larger more respectable class. 
This is particularly useful when you want to create a little class specifically to support the work 
of a larger class. And, more seriously, there are other good reasons for nesting the definition of 
one class inside another class. 

In Java, a nested class is any class whose definition is inside the definition of another 
class. Nested classes can be either named or anonymous. I will come back to the topic of 
anonymous classes later in this section. A named nested class, like most other things that occur 
in classes, can be either static or non-static. 

The definition of a static nested class looks just like the definition of any other class, except 
that it is nested inside another class and it has the modifier static as part of its declaration. 
A static nested class is part of the static structure of the containing class. It can be used inside 
that class to create objects in the usual way. If it has not been declared private, then it can 
also be used outside the containing class, but when it is used outside the class, its name must 
indicate its membership in the containing class. This is similar to other static components of 
a class: A static nested class is part of the class itself in the same way that static member 
variables are parts of the class itself. 

For example, suppose a class named WireFrameModel represents a set of lines in three- 
dimensional space. (Such models are used to represent three-dimensional objects in graphics 
programs.) Suppose that the WireFrameModel class contains a static nested class, Line, that 
represents a single line. Then, outside of the class WireFrameModel, the Line class would be 
referred to as WireFrameModel . Line. Of course, this just follows the normal naming convention 
for static members of a class. The definition of the WireFrameModel class with its nested Line 
class would look, in outline, like this: 

public class WireFrameModel { 

. . . // other members of the WireFrameModel class 
static public class Line { 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



217 



// Represents a line from the point (xl,yl,zl) 

// to the point (x2,y2,z2) in 3-dimensional space. 

double xl, yl, zl; 

double x2, y2, z2; 
} // end class Line 

. . . // other members of the WireFrameModel class 

} // end WireFrameModel 

Inside the WireFrameModel class, a Line object would be created with the constructor "new 
LineO". Outside the class, "new WireFrameModel . Line ()" would be used. 

A static nested class has full access to the static members of the containing class, even to the 
private members. Similarly, the containing class has full access to the members of the nested 
class. This can be another motivation for declaring a nested class, since it lets you give one 
class access to the private members of another class without making those members generally 
available to other classes. Note also that a nested class can itself be private, meaning that it 
can only be used inside the class in which it is nested. 

When you compile the above class definition, two class files will be created. Even though 
the definition of Line is nested inside WireFrameModel, the compiled Line class is stored in a 
separate file. The name of the class file for Line will be WireFrameModel$Line . class. 

* * * 

Non-static nested classes are referred to as inner classes. Inner classes are not, in practice, 
very different from static nested classes, but a non-static nested class is actually associated with 
an object rather than to the class in which it is nested. This can take some getting used to. 

Any non-static member of a class is not really part of the class itself (although its source 
code is contained in the class definition). This is true for inner classes, just as it is for any other 
non-static part of a class. The non-static members of a class specify what will be contained in 
objects that are created from that class. The same is true — at least logically — for inner classes. 
It's as if each object that belongs to the containing class has its own copy of the nested class. 
This copy has access to all the instance methods and instance variables of the object, even to 
those that are declared private. The two copies of the inner class in two different objects differ 
because the instance variables and methods they refer to are in different objects. In fact, the 
rule for deciding whether a nested class should be static or non-static is simple: If the nested 
class needs to use any instance variable or instance method from the containing class, make the 
nested class non-static. Otherwise, it might as well be static. 

From outside the containing class, a non-static nested class has to be referred to using a 
name of the form (variableName) .{NestedClassName) , where (variableName) is a variable that 
refers to the object that contains the class. This is actually rather rare, however. A non-static 
nested class is generally used only inside the class in which it is nested, and there it can be 
referred to by its simple name. 

In order to create an object that belongs to an inner class, you must first have an object 
that belongs to the containing class. (When working inside the class, the object "this" is used 
implicitly.) The inner class object is permanently associated with the containing class object, 
and it has complete access to the members of the containing class object. Looking at an example 
will help, and will hopefully convince you that inner classes are really very natural. Consider 
a class that represents poker games. This class might include a nested class to represent the 
players of the game. This structure of the PokerGame class could be: 

public class PokerGame { // Represents a game of poker. 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



218 



class Player { // Represents one of the players in this game. 



} // end class Player 



private Deck deck; 
private int pot ; 



// A deck of cards for playing the game. 
/ / The amount of money that has been bet . 



} // end class PokerGame 

If game is a variable of type PokerGame, then, conceptually, game contains its own copy of 
the Player class. In an instance method of a PokerGame object, a new Player object would 
be created by saying "new Player ()", just as for any other class. (A Player object could be 
created outside the PokerGame class with an expression such as "game. new Player ()". Again, 
however, this is rare.) The Player object will have access to the deck and pot instance variables 
in the PokerGame object. Each PokerGame object has its own deck and pot and Players. 
Players of that poker game use the deck and pot for that game; players of another poker game 
use the other game's deck and pot. That's the effect of making the Player class non-static. 
This is the most natural way for players to behave. A Player object represents a player of 
one particular poker game. If Player were a static nested class, on the other hand, it would 
represent the general idea of a poker player, independent of a particular poker game. 

5.7.3 Anonymous Inner Classes 

In some cases, you might find yourself writing an inner class and then using that class in just a 
single line of your program. Is it worth creating such a class? Indeed, it can be, but for cases 
like this you have the option of using an anonymous inner class. An anonymous class is 
created with a variation of the new operator that has the form 



This constructor defines a new class, without giving it a name, and it simultaneously creates 
an object that belongs to that class. This form of the new operator can be used in any statement 
where a regular "new" could be used. The intention of this expression is to create: "a new object 
belonging to a class that is the same as {superclass- or-interf ace) but with these (methods-and- 
variables) added." The effect is to create a uniquely customized object, just at the point in 
the program where you need it. Note that it is possible to base an anonymous class on an 
interface, rather than a class. In this case, the anonymous class must implement the interface 
by defining all the methods that are declared in the interface. If an interface is used as a base, 
the (parameter-list) must be empty. Otherwise, it can contain parameters for a constructor in 
the (superclass). 

Anonymous classes are often used for handling events in graphical user interfaces, and we 
will encounter them several times in the chapters on GUI programming. For now, we will look 
at one not-very-plausible example. Consider the Drawable interface, which is defined earlier in 




CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



219 



this section. Suppose that we want a Drawable object that draws a filled, red, 100-pixel square. 
Rather than defining a new, separate class and then using that class to create the object, we 
can use an anonymous class to create the object in one statement: 

Drawable redSquare = new Drawable () { 
void draw (Graphics g) { 
g . setColor (Color . red) ; 
g.fillRect(10,10,100,100) ; 

} 

}; 

The semicolon at the end of this statement is not part of the class definition. It's the semicolon 
that is required at the end of every declaration statement. 

When a Java class is compiled, each anonymous nested class will produce a separate 
class file. If the name of the main class is MainClass, for example, then the names of the 
class files for the anonymous nested classes will be MainClass$l . class, MainClass$2 . class, 
MainClass$3 . class, and so on. 

5.7.4 Mixing Static and Non-static 

Classes, as I've said, have two very distinct purposes. A class can be used to group together a set 
of static member variables and static methods. Or it can be used as a factory for making objects. 
The non-static variables and methods in the class definition specify the instance variables and 
methods of the objects. In most cases, a class performs one or the other of these roles, not 
both. 

Sometimes, however, static and non-static members are mixed in a single class. In this 
case, the class plays a dual role. Sometimes, these roles are completely separate. But it is also 
possible for the static and non-static parts of a class to interact. This happens when instance 
methods use static member variables or call static member subroutines. An instance method 
belongs to an object, not to the class itself, and there can be many objects with their own 
versions of the instance method. But there is only one copy of a static member variable. So, 
effectively, we have many objects sharing that one variable. 

Suppose, for example, that we want to write a PairOfDice class that uses the Random class 
mentioned in Section 5.3 for rolling the dice. To do this, a PairOfDice object needs access to 
an object of type Random. But there is no need for each PairOfDice object to have a separate 
Random object. (In fact, it would not even be a good idea: Because of the way random number 
generators work, a program should, in general, use only one source of random numbers.) A 
nice solution is to have a single Random variable as a static member of the PairOfDice class, 
so that it can be shared by all PairOfDice objects. For example: 

import java.util .Random; 

public class PairOfDice { 

private static Random randGen = new Random () ; 

public int diel; // Number showing on the first die. 
public int die2; // Number showing on the second die. 

public PairOfDice () { 

II Constructor. Creates a pair of dice that 
// initially shows random values. 
rollO ; 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



220 



> 

public void rollO { 

// Roll the dice by setting each of the dice to be 

// a random number between 1 and 6 . 
diel = randGen. nextlnt (6) + 1; // Use the static variable! 
die2 = randGen. nextlnt (6) + 1; 

> 

} // end class PairOfDice 

As another example, let's rewrite the Student class that was used in Section 5.2. I've added 
an ID for each student and a static member called nextUniquelD. Although there is an ID 
variable in each student object, there is only one nextUniquelD variable. 

public class Student { 

private String name; // Student's name. 

private int ID; // Unique ID number for this student. 

public double testl, test2, test3; // Grades on three tests. 

private static int nextUniquelD = 0; 

// keep track of next available unique ID number 

Student (String theName) { 

// Constructor for Student objects; provides a name for the Student, 

// and assigns the student a unique ID number, 
name = theName ; 
next Unique ID++ ; 
ID = nextUniquelD; 

> 

public String getNameO { 

// Accessor method for reading the value of the private 
// instance variable, name, 
return name ; 

> 

public int getlDQ { 

// Accessor method for reading the value of ID. 
return ID ; 

> 

public double get Aver age () { 

// Compute average test grade, 
return (testl + test2 + test3) / 3; 

} 

} // end of class Student 

Since nextUniquelD is a static variable, the initialization "nextUniquelD = 0" is done 
only once, when the class is first loaded. Whenever a Student object is constructed and the 
constructor says "nextUniqueID++;", it's always the same static member variable that is being 
incremented. When the very first Student object is created, nextUniquelD becomes 1. When 
the second object is created, nextUniquelD becomes 2. After the third object, it becomes 3. 
And so on. The constructor stores the new value of nextUniquelD in the ID variable of the 
object that is being created. Of course, ID is an instance variable, so every object has its own 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



221 



individual ID variable. The class is constructed so that each student will automatically get a 
different value for its ID variable. Furthermore, the ID variable is private, so there is no way 
for this variable to be tampered with after the object has been created. You are guaranteed, 
just by the way the class is designed, that every student object will have its own permanent, 
unique identification number. Which is kind of cool if you think about it. 

(Unfortunately, if you think about it a bit more, it turns out that the guarantee isn't quite 
absolute. The guarantee is valid in programs that use a single thread. But, as a preview of the 
difficulties of parallel programming, I'll note that in multi-threaded programs, where several 
things can be going on at the same time, things can get a bit strange. In a multi-threaded 
program, it is possible that two threads are creating Student objects at exactly the same time, 
and it becomes possible for both objects to get the same ID number. We'll come back to this 
in Subsection 12.1.3, where you will learn how to fix the problem.) 

5.7.5 Static Import 

The import directive makes it possible to refer to a class such as java. awt . Color using its 
simple name, Color. All you have to do is say import j ava . awt . Color or import j ava . awt . *. 
But you still have to use compound names to refer to static member variables such as 
System. out and to static methods such as Math.sqrt. 

Java 5.0 introduced a new form of the import directive that can be used to import static 
members of a class in the same way that the ordinary import directive imports classes from a 
package. The new form of the directive is called a static import, and it has syntax 

import static (package-name) . (class-name) . (static-membe 1 ) — name); 

to import one static member name from a class, or 

import static (package-name) . (class-name) .* ; 

to import all the public static members from a class. For example, if you preface a class 
definition with 

import static java. Icing. System, out; 

then you can use the simple name out instead of the compound name System, out. This means 
you can use out . println instead of System . out . pr intln. If you are going to work extensively 
with the Math class, you can preface your class definition with 

import static j ava . lang . Math . * ; 

This would allow you to say sqrt instead of Math.sqrt, log instead of Math. log, PI instead 
of Math. PI, and so on. 

Note that the static import directive requires a (package-name), even for classes in the 
standard package java. lang. One consequence of this is that you can't do a static import from 
a class in the default package. In particular, it is not possible to do a static import from my 
Text 10 class — if you wanted to do that, you would have to move Text 10 into a package. 

5.7.6 Enums as Classes 

Enumerated types were introduced in Subsection 2.3.3. Now that we have covered more material 
on classes and objects, we can revisit the topic (although still not covering enumerated types 
in their full complexity). 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



222 



Enumerated types are actually classes, and each enumerated type constant is a public, 
final, static member variable in that class (even though they are not declared with these 
modifiers). The value of the variable is an object belonging to the enumerated type class. There 
is one such object for each enumerated type constant, and these are the only objects of the 
class that can ever be created. It is really these objects that represent the possible values of 
the enumerated type. The enumerated type constants are actually variables that refer to these 
objects. 

When an enumerated type is defined inside another class, it is a nested class inside the 
enclosing class. In fact, it is a static nested class, whether you declare it to be static or not. 
But it can also be declared as a non-nested class, in a file of its own. For example, we could 
define the following enumerated type in a file named Suit . j ava: 

public enum Suit { 

SPADES, HEARTS, DIAMONDS, CLUBS 

} 

This enumerated type represents the four possible suits for a playing card, and it could have 
been used in the example Card.java from Subsection 5.4.2. 

Furthermore, in addition to its list of values, an enumerated type can contain some of 
the other things that a regular class can contain, including methods and additional member 
variables. Just add a semicolon (;) at the end of the list of values, and then add definitions 
of the methods and variables in the usual way. For example, we might make an enumerated 
type to represent the possible values of a playing card. It might be useful to have a method 
that returns the corresponding value in the game of Blackjack. As another example, suppose 
that when we print out one of the values, we'd like to see something different from the default 
string representation (the identifier that names the constant). In that case, we can override the 
toStringO method in the class to print out a different string representation. This would give 
something like: 

public enum CardValue { 

ACE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, 
NINE, TEN, JACK, QUEEN, KING; 

/** 

* Return the value of this CardValue in the game of Blackjack. 

* Note that the value returned for an ace is 1. 
*/ 

public int blackJackValueO { 

if (this == JACK I I this == QUEEN I I this == KING) 

return 10; 
else 

return 1 + ordinal (); 

> 

/** 

* Return a String representation of this CardValue, using numbers 

* for the numerical cards and names for the ace and face cards. 
*/ 

public String toStringO { 

switch (this) { // "this" is one of the enumerated type values 

case ACE: 



CHAPTER 5. OBJECTS AND CLASSES 



223 



return "Ace"; 
case JACK: 

return "Jack"; 
case QUEEN : 

return "Queen"; 
case KING: 

return "King"; 
default: // it's a numeric card value 

int numericValue = 1 + ordinalO; 

return "" + numericValue; 

> 

} // end CardValue 

The methods black jackValue () and toStringO are instance methods in Card- 
Value. Since CardValue . JACK is an object belonging to that class, you can call 
CardValue . JACK .black jackValue () . Suppose that cardVal is declared to be a variable 
of type CardValue, so that it can refer to any of the values in the enumerated type. We 
can call cardVal. black jackValue () to find the Blackjack value of the CardValue object to 
which cardVal refers, and System, out .print In (cardVal) will implicitly call the method 
cardVal . toStringO to obtain the print representation of that CardValue. (One other thing to 
keep in mind is that since CardValue is a class, the value of cardVal can be null, which means 
it does not refer to any object.) 

Remember that ACE, TWO, . . . , KING are the only possible objects of type CardValue, so in an 
instance method in that class, this will refer to one of those values. Recall that the instance 
method ordinal ( ) is defined in any enumerated type and gives the position of the enumerated 
type value in the list of possible values, with the count starting from zero. 

(If you find it annoying to use the class name as part of the name of every enumerated 
type constant, you can use static import to make the simple names of the constants directly 
available — but only if you put the enumerated type into a package. For example, if the enu- 
merated type CardValue is defined in a package named cardgames, then you could place 

import static cardgames . CardValue .* ; 

at the beginning of a source code file. This would allow you, for example, to use the name JACK 
in that file instead of CardValue . JACK.) 



Exercises

Exercises for Chapter 5 

1. In all versions of the PairOfDice class in Section 5.2, the instance variables diel and die2 (solution) 
are declared to be public. They really should be private, so that they would be protected 

from being changed from outside the class. Write another version of the PairOfDice class 
in which the instance variables diel and die2 are private. Your class will need "getter" 
methods that can be used to find out the values of diel and die2. (The idea is to protect 
their values from being changed from outside the class, but still to allow the values to be 
read.) Include other improvements in the class, if you can think of any. Test your class 
with a short program that counts how many times a pair of dice is rolled, before the total 
of the two dice is equal to two. 

2. A common programming task is computing statistics of a set of numbers. (A statistic is (solution) 
a number that summarizes some property of a set of data.) Common statistics include 

the mean (also known as the average) and the standard deviation (which tells how spread 
out the data are from the mean). I have written a little class called StatCalc that can 
be used to compute these statistics, as well as the sum of the items in the dataset and 
the number of items in the dataset. You can read the source code for this class in the 
file StatCalc.java. If calc is a variable of type StatCalc, then the following methods are 
defined: 

• calc . enter (item) where item is a number, adds the item to the dataset. 

• calc . getCount () is a function that returns the number of items that have been 
added to the dataset. 

• calc . getSumO is a function that returns the sum of all the items that have been 
added to the dataset. 

• calc . getMeanQ is a function that returns the average of all the items. 

• calc . getStandardDeviationQ is a function that returns the standard deviation 
of the items. 

Typically, all the data are added one after the other by calling the enter () method 
over and over, as the data become available. After all the data have been entered, any 
of the other methods can be called to get statistical information about the data. The 
methods getMeanO and getStandardDeviationO should only be called if the number 
of items is greater than zero. 

Modify the current source code, StatCalc.java, to add instance methods getMaxO and 
getMinO . The getMaxO method should return the largest of all the items that have been 
added to the dataset, and getMinO should return the smallest. You will need to add two 
new instance variables to keep track of the largest and smallest items that have been seen 
so far. 

Test your new class by using it in a program to compute statistics for a set of non-zero 
numbers entered by the user. Start by creating an object of type StatCalc: 

StatCalc calc; // Object to be used to process the data, 
calc = new StatCalcO; 

Read numbers from the user and add them to the dataset. Use as a sentinel value 
(that is, stop reading numbers when the user enters 0). After all the user's non-zero 



Exercises 



225 



numbers have been entered, print out each of the six statistics that are available from 
calc. 

3. This problem uses the PairOfDice class from Exercise 5.1 and the StatCalc class from (solution) 
Exercise 5.2. 

The program in Exercise 4.4 performs the experiment of counting how many times a 
pair of dice is rolled before a given total comes up. It repeats this experiment 10000 times 
and then reports the average number of rolls. It does this whole process for each possible 
total (2, 3, 12). 

Redo that exercise. But instead of just reporting the average number of rolls, you 
should also report the standard deviation and the maximum number of rolls. Use a 
PairOfDice object to represent the dice. Use a StatCalc object to compute the statistics. 
(You'll need a new StatCalc object for each possible total, 2, 3, . . . , 12. You can use a 
new pair of dice if you want, but it's not necessary.) 

4. The BlackjackHand class from Subsection 5.5.1 is an extension of the Hand class from Sec- (solution) 
tion 5.4. The instance methods in the Hand class are discussed in that section. In addition 

to those methods, BlackjackHand includes an instance method, getBlackjackValueO , 
that returns the value of the hand for the game of Blackjack. For this exercise, you will 
also need the Deck and Card classes from Section 5.4. 

A Blackjack hand typically contains from two to six cards. Write a program to test the 
BlackjackHand class. You should create a BlackjackHand object and a Deck object. Pick 
a random number between 2 and 6. Deal that many cards from the deck and add them to 
the hand. Print out all the cards in the hand, and then print out the value computed for 
the hand by getBlackjackValueO. Repeat this as long as the user wants to continue. 

In addition to TextlO.java, your program will depend on Card.java, Deck.java, 
Hand.java, and BlackjackHand.java. 

5. Write a program that lets the user play Blackjack. The game will be a simplified version (solution) 
of Blackjack as it is played in a casino. The computer will act as the dealer. As in 

the previous exercise, your program will need the classes defined in Card.java, Deck.java, 
Hand.java, and BlackjackHand.java. (This is the longest and most complex program that 
has come up so far in the exercises.) 

You should first write a subroutine in which the user plays one game. The subroutine 
should return a boolean value to indicate whether the user wins the game or not. Return 
true if the user wins, false if the dealer wins. The program needs an object of class 
Deck and two objects of type BlackjackHand, one for the dealer and one for the user. 
The general object in Blackjack is to get a hand of cards whose value is as close to 21 as 
possible, without going over. The game goes like this. 

• First, two cards are dealt into each player's hand. If the dealer's hand has a value of 
21 at this point, then the dealer wins. Otherwise, if the user has 21, then the user 
wins. (This is called a "Blackjack".) Note that the dealer wins on a tie, so if both 
players have Blackjack, then the dealer wins. 

• Now, if the game has not ended, the user gets a chance to add some cards to her 
hand. In this phase, the user sees her own cards and sees one of the dealer's two 
cards. (In a casino, the dealer deals himself one card face up and one card face down. 
All the user's cards are dealt face up.) The user makes a decision whether to "Hit", 



Exercises 



226 



which means to add another card to her hand, or to "Stand", which means to stop 
taking cards. 

• If the user Hits, there is a possibility that the user will go over 21. In that case, the 
game is over and the user loses. If not, then the process continues. The user gets to 
decide again whether to Hit or Stand. 

• If the user Stands, the game will end, but first the dealer gets a chance to draw cards. 
The dealer only follows rules, without any choice. The rule is that as long as the 
value of the dealer's hand is less than or equal to 16, the dealer Hits (that is, takes 
another card). The user should see all the dealer's cards at this point. Now, the 
winner can be determined: If the dealer has gone over 21, the user wins. Otherwise, 
if the dealer's total is greater than or equal to the user's total, then the dealer wins. 
Otherwise, the user wins. 

Two notes on programming: At any point in the subroutine, as soon as you know who 
the winner is, you can say "return true;" or "return false;" to end the subroutine 
and return to the main program. To avoid having an overabundance of variables in your 
subroutine, remember that a function call such as userHand.getBlackjackValueO can 
be used anywhere that a number could be used, including in an output statement or in 
the condition of an if statement. 

Write a main program that lets the user play several games of Blackjack. To make 
things interesting, give the user 100 dollars, and let the user make bets on the game. If 
the user loses, subtract the bet from the user's money. If the user wins, add an amount 
equal to the bet to the user's money. End the program when the user wants to quit or 
when she runs out of money. 

An applet version of this program can be found in the on-line version of this exercise. 
You might want to try it out before you work on the program. 

6. Subsection 5.7.6 discusses the possibility of representing the suits and values of playing (solution) 
cards as enumerated types. Rewrite the Card class from Subsection 5.4.2 to use these 
enumerated types. Test your class with a program that prints out the 52 possible playing 
cards. Suggestions: You can modify the source code file Card.java, but you should leave 
out support for Jokers. In your main program, use nested for loops to generated cards of 
all possible suits and values; the for loops will be "for-each" loops of the type discussed 
in Subsection 3.4.4. It would be nice to add a toStringO method to the Suit class from 
Subsection 5.7.6, so that a suit prints out as "Spades" or "Hearts" instead of "SPADES" 
or "HEARTS".

Introduction to GUI Programming 



Computer users today expect to interact with their computers using a graphical user 
interface (GUI). Java can be used to write GUI programs ranging from simple applets which 
run on a Web page to sophisticated stand-alone applications. 

GUI programs differ from traditional "straight-through" programs that you have encoun- 
tered in the first few chapters of this book. One big difference is that GUI programs are 
event- driven. That is, user actions such as clicking on a button or pressing a key on the 
keyboard generate events, and the program must respond to these events as they occur. Event- 
driven programming builds on all the skills you have learned in the first five chapters of this 
text. You need to be able to write the methods that respond to events. Inside those meth- 
ods, you are doing the kind of programming- in-the-small that was covered in Chapter 2 and 
Chapter 3. 

And of course, objects are everywhere in GUI programming. Events are objects. Colors 
and fonts are objects. GUI components such as buttons and menus are objects. Events are 
handled by instance methods contained in objects. In Java, GUI programming is object-oriented 
programming. 

This chapter covers the basics of GUI programming. The discussion will continue in 
Chapter 13 with more details and with more advanced techniques. 

6.1 The Basic GUI Application 

There are two basic types of GUI program in Java: stand-alone applications and (online) 
applets. An applet is a program that runs in a rectangular area on a Web page. Applets are 
generally small programs, meant to do fairly simple things, although there is nothing to stop 
them from being very complex. Applets were responsible for a lot of the initial excitement about 
Java when it was introduced, since they could do things that could not otherwise be done on 
Web pages. However, there are now easier ways to do many of the more basic things that can 
be done with applets, and they are no longer the main focus of interest in Java. Nevertheless, 
there are still some things that can be done best with applets, and they are still somewhat 
common on the Web. We will look at applets in the next section. 

A stand-alone application is a program that runs on its own, without depending on a 
Web browser. You've been writing stand-alone applications all along. Any class that has a 
main() routine defines a stand-alone application; running the program just means executing 
this main() routine. However, the programs that you've seen up till now have been "command- 
line" programs, where the user and computer interact by typing things back and forth to each 



229 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



230 



other. A GUI program offers a much richer type of user interface, where the user uses a mouse 
and keyboard to interact with GUI components such as windows, menus, buttons, check boxes, 
text input boxes, scroll bars, and so on. The main routine of a GUI program creates one or 
more such components and displays them on the computer screen. Very often, that's all it does. 
Once a GUI component has been created, it follows its own programming — programming that 
tells it how to draw itself on the screen and how to respond to events such as being clicked on 
by the user. 

A GUI program doesn't have to be immensely complex. We can, for example, write a very 
simple GUI "Hello World" program that says "Hello" to the user, but does it by opening a 
window where the greeting is displayed: 

import j avax. swing. JOptionPane; 

public class HelloWorldGUIl { 

public static void main (String [] args) { 

JOptionPane . showMessageDialog( null, "Hello World!" ); 

} 

} 

When this program is run, a window appears on the screen that contains the message 
"Hello World!". The window also contains an "OK" button for the user to click after reading 
the message. When the user clicks this button, the window closes and the program ends. By 
the way, this program can be placed in a file named HelloWorldGUIl. java, compiled, and run 
just like any other Java program. 

Now, this program is already doing some pretty fancy stuff. It creates a window, it draws 
the contents of that window, and it handles the event that is generated when the user clicks 
the button. The reason the program was so easy to write is that all the work is done by 
showMessageDialogO , a static method in the built-in class JOptionPane. (Note that the 
source code "imports" the class j avax. swing. JOptionPane to make it possible to refer to the 
JOptionPane class using its simple name. See Subsection 4.5.3 for information about importing 
classes from Java's standard packages.) 

If you want to display a message to the user in a GUI program, this is a good way to do it: 
Just use a standard class that already knows how to do the work! And in fact, JOptionPane is 
regularly used for just this purpose (but as part of a larger program, usually). Of course, if you 
want to do anything serious in a GUI program, there is a lot more to learn. To give you an idea 
of the types of things that are involved, we'll look at a short GUI program that does the same 
things as the previous program — open a window containing a message and an OK button, and 
respond to a click on the button by ending the program — but does it all by hand instead of by 
using the built-in JOptionPane class. Mind you, this is not a good way to write the program, 
but it will illustrate some important aspects of GUI programming in Java. 

Here is the source code for the program. You are not expected to understand it yet. I 
will explain how it works below, but it will take the rest of the chapter before you will really 
understand completely. In this section, you will just get a brief overview of GUI programming. 

import j ava . awt . * ;

} 

6.1.1 JFrame and JPanel 

In a Java GUI program, each GUI component in the interface is represented by an object in 
the program. One of the most fundamental types of component is the window. Windows have 
many behaviors. They can be opened and closed. They can be resized. They have "titles" that 
are displayed in the title bar above the window. And most important, they can contain other 
GUI components such as buttons and menus. 

Java, of course, has a built-in class to represent windows. There are actually several different 
types of window, but the most common type is represented by the JFrame class (which is 
included in the package javax. swing). A JFrame is an independent window that can, for 
example, act as the main window of an application. One of the most important things to 
understand is that a JFrame object comes with many of the behaviors of windows already 
programmed in. In particular, it comes with the basic properties shared by all windows, such 
as a titlebar and the ability to be opened and closed. Since a JFrame comes with these behaviors, 
you don't have to program them yourself! This is, of course, one of the central ideas of object- 
oriented programming. What a JFrame doesn't come with, of course, is content, the stuff that 
is contained in the window. If you don't add any other content to a JFrame, it will just display 
a blank area. You can add content either by creating a JFrame object and then adding the 
content to it or by creating a subclass of JFrame and adding the content in the constructor of 
that subclass. 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



232 



The main program above declares a variable, window, of type JFrame and sets it to refer to 
a new window object with the statement: 

JFrame window = new JFrameO'GUI Test"); 

The parameter in the constructor, "GUI Test", specifies the title that will be displayed in the 
titlebar of the window. This line creates the window object, but the window itself is not yet 
visible on the screen. Before making the window visible, some of its properties are set with 
these statements: 

window. setContentPane (content) ; 
window . setSize (250 , 100) ; 
window. setLocation(100 , 100) ; 

The first line here sets the content of the window. (The content itself was created earlier in the 
main program.) The second line says that the window will be 250 pixels wide and 100 pixels 
high. The third line says that the upper left corner of the window will be 100 pixels over from 
the left edge of the screen and 100 pixels down from the top. Once all this has been set up, the 
window is actually made visible on the screen with the command: 

window. setVisible (true) ; 

It might look as if the program ends at that point, and, in fact, the main() routine does end. 
However, the window is still on the screen and the program as a whole does not end until the 
user clicks the OK button. Once the window was opened, a new thread was created to manage 
the graphical user interface, and that thread continues to run even after mainQ has finished. 

* * * 

The content that is displayed in a JFrame is called its content pane. (In addition to its 
content pane, a JFrame can also have a menu bar, which is a separate thing that I will talk 
about later.) A basic JFrame already has a blank content pane; you can either add things 
to that pane or you can replace the basic content pane entirely. In my sample program, 
the line window. setContentPane (content) replaces the original blank content pane with a 
different component. (Remember that a "component" is just a visual element of a graphical 
user interface.) In this case, the new content is a component of type JPanel. 

JPanel is another of the fundamental classes in Swing. The basic JPanel is, again, just 
a blank rectangle. There are two ways to make a useful JPanel: The first is to add other 
components to the panel; the second is to draw something in the panel. Both of these 
techniques are illustrated in the sample program. In fact, you will find two JPanels in the 
program: content, which is used to contain other components, and displayPanel, which is 
used ELS ct drawing surface. 

Let's look more closely at displayPanel. This variable is of type HelloWorldDisplay, which 
is a nested static class inside the HelloWorldGUI2 class. (Nested classes were introduced in 
Subsection 5.7.2.) This class defines just one instance method, paintComponent () , which 
overrides a method of the same name in the JPanel class: 

private static class HelloWorldDisplay extends JPanel { 
public void paintComponent (Graphics g) { 
super . paintComponent (g) ; 
g.drawString( "Hello World!", 20, 30 ); 

> 

} 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



233 



The paintComponent () method is called by the system when a component needs to be painted 
on the screen. In the JPanel class, the paintComponent method simply fills the panel with the 
panel's background color. The paintComponent () method in HelloWorldDisplay begins by call- 
ing super .paintComponent (g). This calls the version of paintComponent () that is defined in 
the superclass, JPanel; that is, it fills the panel with the background color. (See Subsection 5.6.2 
for a discussion of the special variable super.) Then it calls g.drawStringO to paint the string 
"Hello World!" onto the panel. The net result is that whenever a HelloWorldDisplay is shown 
on the screen, it displays the string "Hello World!". 

We will often use JPanels in this way, as drawing surfaces. Usually, when we do this, we will 
define a nested class that is a subclass of JPanel and we will write a paintComponent method 
in that class to draw the desired content in the panel. 

6.1.2 Components and Layout 

Another way of using a JPanel is as a container to hold other components. Java has many 
classes that define GUI components. Before these components can appear on the screen, they 
must be added to a container. In this program, the variable named content refers to a JPanel 
that is used as a container, and two other components are added to that container. This is 
done in the statements: 

content . add (displayPanel , BorderLayout . CENTER) ; 
content . add(okButton, BorderLayout . SOUTH) ; 

Here, content refers to an object of type JPanel; later in the program, this panel becomes the 
content pane of the window. The first component that is added to content is displayPanel 
which, as discussed above, displays the message, "Hello World!". The second is okButton which 
represents the button that the user clicks to close the window. The variable okButton is of 
type JButton, the Java class that represents push buttons. 

The "BorderLayout" stuff in these statements has to do with how the two components are 
arranged in the container. When components are added to a container, there has to be some way 
of deciding how those components are arranged inside the container. This is called "laying out" 
the components in the container, and the most common technique for laying out components 
is to use a layout manager. A layout manager is an object that implements some policy for 
how to arrange the components in a container; different types of layout manager implement 
different policies. One type of layout manager is defined by the BorderLayout class. In the 
program, the statement 

content . setLayout (new BorderLayout () ) ; 

creates a new BorderLayout object and tells the content panel to use the new object as its layout 
manager. Essentially, this line determines how components that are added to the content panel 
will be arranged inside the panel. We will cover layout managers in much more detail later, but 
for now all you need to know is that adding okButton in the BorderLayout . SOUTH position puts 
the button at the bottom of the panel, and putting displayPanel in the BorderLayout . CENTER 
position makes it fill any space that is not taken up by the button. 

This example shows a general technique for setting up a GUI: Create a container and assign 
a layout manager to it, create components and add them to the container, and use the container 
as the content pane of a window or applet. A container is itself a component, so it is possible 
that some of the components that are added to the top-level container are themselves containers, 
with their own layout managers and components. This makes it possible to build up complex 
user interfaces in a hierarchical fashion, with containers inside containers inside containers. . . 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



234 



6.1.3 Events and Listeners 

The structure of containers and components sets up the physical appearance of a GUI, but 
it doesn't say anything about how the GUI behaves. That is, what can the user do to the 
GUI and how will it respond? GUIs are largely event- driven; that is, the program waits 
for events that are generated by the user's actions (or by some other cause). When an event 
occurs, the program responds by executing an event-handling method. In order to program 
the behavior of a GUI, you have to write event-handling methods to respond to the events that 
you are interested in. 

The most common technique for handling events in Java is to use event listeners. A 
listener is an object that includes one or more event-handling methods. When an event is 
detected by another object, such as a button or menu, the listener object is notified and it 
responds by running the appropriate event-handling method. An event is detected or generated 
by an object. Another object, the listener, has the responsibility of responding to the event. 
The event itself is actually represented by a third object, which carries information about the 
type of event, when it occurred, and so on. This division of responsibilities makes it easier to 
organize large programs. 

As an example, consider the OK button in the sample program. When the user clicks the 
button, an event is generated. This event is represented by an object belonging to the class 
ActionEvent. The event that is generated is associated with the button; we say that the button 
is the source of the event. The listener object in this case is an object belonging to the class 
ButtonHandler, which is defined as a nested class inside HelloWorldGUI2: 

private static class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener { 
public void actionPerf ormed (ActionEvent e) { 
System. exit (0) ; 

} 

} 

This class implements the ActionListener interface — a requirement for listener objects that 
handle events from buttons. (Interfaces were introduced in Subsection 5.7.1.) The event- 
handling method is named actionPerf ormed, as specified by the ActionListener interface. This 
method contains the code that is executed when the user clicks the button; in this case, the 
code is a call to System. exit () , which will terminate the program. 

There is one more ingredient that is necessary to get the event from the button to the 
listener object: The listener object must register itself with the button as an event listener. 
This is done with the statement: 

okButton . addActionListener (listener ) ; 

This statement tells okButton that when the user clicks the button, the ActionEvent that is 
generated should be sent to listener. Without this statement, the button has no way of 
knowing that some other object would like to listen for events from the button. 

This example shows a general technique for programming the behavior of a GUI: Write 
classes that include event-handling methods. Create objects that belong to these classes and 
register them as listeners with the objects that will actually detect or generate the events. When 
an event occurs, the listener is notified, and the code that you wrote in one of its event-handling 
methods is executed. At first, this might seem like a very roundabout and complicated way to 
get things done, but as you gain experience with it, you will find that it is very flexible and 
that it goes together very well with object oriented programming. (We will return to events 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



235 



and listeners in much more detail in Section 6.3 and later sections; I do not expect you to 
completely understand them at this time.) 

6.2 Applets and HTML 

Although stand-alone applications are much more important than applets at this point (online) 

in the history of Java, applets are still widely used. They can do things on Web pages that can't 

easily be done with other technologies. It is easy to distribute applets to users: The user just 

has to open a Web page, and the applet is there, with no special installation required (although 

the user must have an appropriate version of Java installed on their computer). And of course, 

applets are fun; now that the Web has become such a common part of life, it's nice to be able 

to see your work running on a web page. 

The good news is that writing applets is not much different from writing stand-alone appli- 
cations. The structure of an applet is essentially the same as the structure of the JFrames that 
were introduced in the previous section, and events are handled in the same way in both types 
of program. So, most of what you learn about applications applies to applets, and vice versa. 

Of course, one difference is that an applet is dependent on a Web page, so to use applets 
effectively, you have to learn at least a little about creating Web pages. Web pages are written 
using a language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language). In Subsection 6.2.3, below, 
you'll learn how to use HTML to create Web pages that display applets. 

6.2.1 JApplet 

The JApplet class (in package j avax . swing) can be used as a basis for writing applets in the 
same way that JFrame is used for writing stand-alone applications. The basic JApplet class 
represents a blank rectangular area. Since an applet is not a stand-alone application, this area 
must appear on a Web page, or in some other environment that knows how to display an applet. 
Like a JFrame, a JApplet contains a content pane (and can contain a menu bar). You can add 
content to an applet either by adding content to its content pane or by replacing the content 
pane with another component. In my examples, I will generally create a JPanel and use it as a 
replacement for the applet's content pane. 

To create an applet, you will write a subclass of JApplet. The JApplet class defines several 
instance methods that are unique to applets. These methods are called by the applet's environ- 
ment at certain points during the applet's "life cycle." In the JApplet class itself, these methods 
do nothing; you can override these methods in a subclass. The most important of these special 
applet methods is 

public void initO 

An applet's init () method is called when the applet is created. You can use the init () method 
as a place where you can set up the physical structure of the applet and the event handling 
that will determine its behavior. (You can also do some initialization in the constructor for 
your class, but there are certain aspects of the applet's environment that are set up after its 
constructor is called but before the initO method is called, so there are a few operations 
that will work in the initO method but will not work in the constructor.) The other applet 
life-cycle methods are start (), stopO, and destroy (). I will not use these methods for the 
time being and will not discuss them here except to mention that destroy () is called at the 
end of the applet's lifetime and can be used as a place to do any necessary cleanup, such as 
closing any windows that were opened by the applet. 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



236 



With this in mind, we can look at our first example of a JApplet. It is, of course, an applet 
that says "Hello World!". To make it a little more interesting, I have added a button that 
changes the text of the message, and a state variable, currentMessage, that holds the text of the 
current message. This example is very similar to the stand-alone application Hello WorldGUI2 
from the previous section. It uses an event-handling class to respond when the user clicks the 
button, a panel to display the message, and another panel that serves as a container for the 
message panel and the button. The second panel becomes the content pane of the applet. Here 
is the source code for the applet; again, you are not expected to understand all the details at 
this time: 

import j ava . awt . * ; 
import j ava . awt . event . * ; 
import j avax . swing . * ; 

/** 

* A simple applet that can display the messages "Hello World" 

* and "Goodbye World". The applet contains a button, and it 

* switches from one message to the other when the button is 

* clicked. 
*/ 

public class HelloWorldApplet extends JApplet { 

private String currentMessage = "Hello World!"; // Currently displayed message, 
private MessageDisplay displayPanel ; // The panel where the message is displayed. 

private class MessageDisplay extends JPanel { // Defines the display panel, 
public void paintComponent (Graphics g) { 
super .paintComponent(g) ; 
g.drawString(currentMessage, 20, 30); 

} 

> 

private class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener { // The event listener, 
public void actionPerf ormed(ActionEvent e) { 
if (currentMessage. equals ("Hello World!")) 

currentMessage = "Goodbye World!"; 
else 

currentMessage = "Hello World!"; 
displayPanel . repaint () ; // Paint display panel with new message. 

} 

> 

/** 

* The applet's initO method creates the button and display panel and 

* adds them to the applet, and it sets up a listener to respond to 

* clicks on the button. 
*/ 

public void init { 

displayPanel = new MessageDisplay () ; 

JButton changeMessageButton = new JButton( "Change Message"); 
ButtonHandler listener = new ButtonHandler () ; 
changeMessageButton. addActionListener (listener) ; 

JPanel content = new JPanelO; 
content . setLayout (new BorderLayout ( ) ) ; 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



237 



content . add(displayPanel , BorderLayout . CENTER) ; 
content . add (changeMessageButton, BorderLayout . SOUTH) ; 

setContentPane (content) ; 

> 

} 

You should compare this class with Hello WorldGUI2 Java from the previous section. One 
subtle difference that you will notice is that the member variables and nested classes in this 
example are non-static. Remember that an applet is an object. A single class can be used to 
make several applets, and each of those applets will need its own copy of the applet data, so 
the member variables in which the data are stored must be non-static instance variables. Since 
the variables are non-static, the two nested classes, which use those variables, must also be 
non-static. (Static nested classes cannot access non-static member variables in the containing 
class; see Subsection 5.7.2.) Remember the basic rule for deciding whether to make a nested 
class static: If it needs access to any instance variable or instance method in the containing 
class, the nested class must be non-static; otherwise, it can be declared to be static. 

(By the way, JApplet is a subclass of a more basic class, named Applet and found in the 
package java. applet. JApplet is part of the Swing GUI framework Applet is part of the older 
AWT and is no longer commonly used directly for writing applets.) 

6.2.2 Reusing Your JPanels 

Both applets and frames can be programmed in the same way: Design a JPanel, and use it to 
replace the default content pane in the applet or frame. This makes it very easy to write two 
versions of a program, one which runs as an applet and one which runs as a frame. The idea is 
to create a subclass of JPanel that represents the content pane for your program; all the hard 
programming work is done in this panel class. An object of this class can then be used as the 
content pane either in a frame or in an applet — or both. Only a very simple main() program 
is needed to show your panel in a frame, and only a very simple applet class is needed to show 
your panel in an applet, so it's easy to make both versions. 

As an example, we can rewrite HelloWorldApplet by writing a subclass of JPanel. That class 
can then be reused to make a frame in a standalone application. This class is very similar to 
HelloWorldApplet, but now the initialization is done in a constructor instead of in an initO 
method: 

import j ava . awt . * ; 

import j ava . awt . event . * ; 

import j avax . swing . * ; 

public class HelloWorldPanel extends JPanel { 

private String currentMessage = "Hello World!"; // Currently displayed message, 
private MessageDisplay displayPanel ; // The panel where the message is displayed. 

private class MessageDisplay extends JPanel { // Defines the display panel, 
public void paintComponent (Graphics g) { 
super .paintComponent(g) ; 
g.drawString(currentMessage, 20, 30); 

} 

> 

private class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener { // The event listener. 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



238 



public void actionPerf ormed(ActionEvent e) { 
if (currentMessage. equals ("Hello World!")) 

currentMessage = "Goodbye World!"; 
else 

currentMessage = "Hello World!"; 
displayPanel . repaint () ; // Paint display panel with new message. 

} 

} 

/** 

* The constructor creates the components that will be contained inside this 

* panel, and then adds those components to this panel. 
*/ 

public HelloWorldPanelO { 

displayPanel = new MessageDisplay () ; // Create the display subpanel. 

JButton changeMessageButton = new JButton( "Change Message"); // The button. 
ButtonHandler listener = new ButtonHandler () ; 
changeMessageButton. addActionListener (listener) ; 

setLayout (new BorderLayout () ) ; // Set the layout manager for this panel. 
add(displayPanel , BorderLayout . CENTER) ; // Add the display panel. 
add(changeMessageButton, BorderLayout . SOUTH) ; // Add the button. 

> 

} 

Once this class exists, it can be used in an applet. The applet class only has to create an object 
of type HelloWorldPanel and use that object as its content pane: 

import j avax . swing . JApplet ; 

public class HelloWorldApplet2 extends JApplet { 
public void initO { 

HelloWorldPanel content = new HelloWorldPanelO; 
setContentPane (content) ; 

} 

} 

Similarly, it's easy to make a frame that uses an object of type HelloWorldPanel as its content 
pane: 

import j avax . swing . JFrame ; 

public class HelloWorldGUI3 { 

public static void main(String [] args) { 
JFrame window = new JFrameC'GUI Test"); 
HelloWorldPanel content = new HelloWorldPanelO; 
window. setContentPane (content) ; 
window. setSize(250, 100) ; 
window. setLocation(100 , 100) ; 

window. setDef aultCloseOperation( JFrame . EXIT_0N_CLDSE ); 
window. setVisible (true) ; 

} 



} 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



239 



One new feature of this example is the line 

window. setDef aultCloseOperation( JFrame . EXIT_0N_CL0SE ); 

This says that when the user closes the window by clicking the close box in the title bar of the 
window, the program should be terminated. This is necessary because no other way is provided 
to end the program. Without this line, the default close operation of the window would simply 
hide the window when the user clicks the close box, leaving the program running even though 
nothing is visible on the screen. This brings up one of the difficulties of reusing the same panel 
class both in an applet and in a frame: There are some things that a stand-alone application 
can do that an applet can't do. Terminating the program is one of those things. If an applet 
calls System. exit () , it has no effect except to generate an error. 

Nevertheless, in spite of occasional minor difficulties, many of the GUI examples in this 
book will be written as subclasses of JPanel that can be used either in an applet or in a frame. 

6.2.3 Basic HTML 

Before you can actually use an applet that you have written, you need to create a Web page 
on which to place the applet. Such pages are themselves written in a language called HTML 
(HyperText Markup Language). An HTML document describes the contents of a page. A Web 
browser interprets the HTML code to determine what to display on the page. The HTML code 
doesn't look much like the resulting page that appears in the browser. The HTML document 
does contain all the text that appears on the page, but that text is "marked up" with commands 
that determine the structure and appearance of the text and determine what will appear on 
the page in addition to the text. 

HTML has become a rather complicated language, and it is only one of the languages that 
you need to be familiar with if you want to write sophisticated modern web pages. Many 
aspects of the visual style of a page can be controlled using a language called CSS (cascading 
style sheets). Web pages can be dynamic and interactive, and their behavior can be programmed 
using a programming language called JavaScript (which is only very distantly related to Java). 
Furthermore, interactive web pages often work with programs that run on the Web server, 
which can be written in Java or in several other languages. Programming for the web has 
become very complicated indeed! 

Nevertheless, it's fairly easy to write basic web pages using only plain HTML. In this section, 
I will cover just the most basic aspects of the language. You can easily find more information 
on the Web, if you want to learn more. Although there are many Web-authoring programs 
that make it possible to create Web pages without ever looking at the underlying HTML code, 
it is possible to write an HTML page using an ordinary text editor, typing in all the mark-up 
commands by hand, and it is worthwhile to learn how to create at least simple pages in this 
way. 

There is a strict syntax for HTML documents (although in practice Web browsers will do 
their best to display a page even if it does not follow the syntax strictly). Leaving out optional 
features, an HTML document has the form: 

<html> 
<head> 

<t±tle> (do cument-t it le )</title> 

</head> 

<body> 

(document-content ) 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



240 



</body> 
</html> 

The (document-title) is text that will appear in the title bar of the Web browser window when 
the page is displayed. The {document- content) is what is displayed on the page itself. The rest 
of this section describes some of the things that can go into the (document- content) section of 
an HTML document. 

* * * 

The mark-up commands used by HTML are called tags. Examples include <html> and 
<title> in the document outline given above. An HTML tag takes the form 

<(tag-name ) (optional-modifiers )> 

where the (tag-name) is a word that specifies the command, and the (optional-modifiers), if 
present, are used to provide additional information for the command (much like parameters in 
subroutines). A modifier takes the form 

(modifier-name) = (value) 

Usually, the (value) is enclosed in quotes, and it must be if it is more than one word long or if 
it contains certain special characters. There are a few modifiers which have no value, in which 
case only the name of the modifier is present. HTML is case insensitive, which means that 
you can use upper case and lower case letters interchangeably in tags and modifiers. (However, 
lower case is generally used because XHTML, a successor language to HTML, requires lower 
case.) 

A simple example of a tag is <hr>, which draws a line — also called a "horizontal rule"— 
across the page. The hr tag can take several possible modifiers such as width and align. For 
example, a horizontal line that extends halfway across the page could be generated with the 
tag: 

<hr width="50°/."> 

The width here is specified as 50% of the available space, meaning a line that extends halfway 
across the page. The width could also be given as a fixed number of pixels. 
Many tags require matching closing tags, which take the form 

</ (tag-name)> 

For example, the <html> tag at the beginning of an HTML document must be matched 
by a closing </html> tag at the end of the document. As another example, the tag <pre> 
must always have a matching closing tag </pre> later in the document. An opening/closing 
tag pair applies to everything that comes between the opening tag and the closing tag. The 
<pre> tag tells a Web browser to display everything between the <pre> and the </pre> just as 
it is formatted in the original HTML source code, including all the spaces and carriage returns. 
(But tags between <pre> and </pre> are still interpreted by the browser.) "Pre" stands for 
Preformatted text. All of the sample programs in the on-line version of this book are formatted 
using the <pre> command. 

It is important for you to understand that when you don't use <pre>, the computer will 
completely ignore the formatting of the text in the HTML source code. The only thing it pays 
attention to is the tags. Five blank lines in the source code have no more effect than one blank 
line or even a single blank space. Outside of <pre>, if you want to force a new line on the 
Web page, you can use the tag <br>, which stands for "break". For example, I might give my 
address as:

Hobart and William Smith Colleges<br> 
Geneva, NY 14456<br> 

If you want extra vertical space in your web page, you can use several <br>'s in a row. 

Similarly, you need a tag to indicate how the text should be broken up into paragraphs. 
This is done with the <p> tag, which should be placed at the beginning of every paragraph. 
The <p> tag has a matching </p>, which should be placed at the end of each paragraph. The 
closing </p> is technically optional, but it is considered good form to use it. If you want all the 
lines of the paragraph to be shoved over to the right, you can use <p align=right> instead of 
<p>. (This is mostly useful when used with one short line, or when used with <br> to make 
several short lines.) You can also use <p align=center> for centered lines. 

By the way, if tags like <p> and <hr> have special meanings in HTML, you might wonder 
how to get them to appear literally on a web page. To get certain special characters to appear 
on the page, you have to use an entity name in the HTML source code. The entity name 
for < is felt ; , and the entity name for > is &gt ; . Entity names begin with & and end with 
a semicolon. The character & is itself a special character whose entity name is &amp ; . There 
are also entity names for nonstandard characters such as an accented "e" , which has the entity 
name feeacute; and the Greek letter ir, which is written as π . 

There are several useful tags that change the appearance of text. To get italic text, enclose 
the text between <i> and </i>. For example, 

<i>Introduction to Programming using Java</i> 

in an HTML document gives Introduction to Programming using Java in italics when the 
document is displayed as a Web page. The tags <b>, <u>, and <tt> can be used in a similar 
way for bold, underlined , and typewriter-style ("monospace") text. 

A headline, with very large text, can be made by placing the text between <hl> and </hl>. 
Headlines with smaller text can be made using <h2> or <h3> instead of <hl>. Note that these 
headline tags stand on their own; they are not used inside paragraphs. You can add the modifier 
align=center to center the headline, and you can right-justify it with align=right. You can 
include break tags (<br>) in a headline to break it up into multiple lines. For example, the 
following HTML code will produce a medium-sized, centered, two-line headline: 

<h2 align=center>Chapter 6 : <br>Introduction to GUI Programming</h2> 

* * * 

The most distinctive feature of HTML is that documents can contain links to other docu- 
ments. The user can follow links from page to page and in the process visit pages from all over 
the Internet. 

The <a> tag is used to create a link. The text between the <a> and its matching </a> 
appears on the page as the text of the link; the user can follow the link by clicking on this 
text. The <a> tag uses the modifier href to say which document the link should connect to. 
The value for href must be a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). A URL is a coded set of 
instructions for finding a document on the Internet. For example, the URL for my own "home 
page" is 

http : //math . hws . edu/eck/ 

To make a link to this page, I would use the HTML source code 

<a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/">David , s Home Page</a> 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING

The best place to find URLs is on existing Web pages. Web browsers display the URL for the 
page you are currently viewing, and many browsers will display the URL of a link if you point 
to the link with the mouse. 

If you are writing an HTML document and you want to make a link to another document 
that is in the same directory, you can use a relative URL. The relative URL consists of just the 
name of the file. For example, to create a link to a file named "si. html" in the same directory 
as the HTML document that you are writing, you could use 

<a href="sl .html">Section K/a> 

There are also relative URLs for linking to files that are in other directories. Using relative 
URLs is a good idea, since if you use them, you can move a whole collection of files without 
changing any of the links between them (as long as you don't change the relative locations of 
the files). 

When you type a URL into a Web browser, you can omit the "http:/ /" at the beginning of 
the URL. However, in an <a> tag in an HTML document, the "http://" can only be omitted if 
the URL is a relative URL. For a normal URL, it is required. 

* * * 

You can add images to a Web page with the <img> tag. (This is a tag that has no matching 
closing tag.) The actual image must be stored in a separate file from the HTML document. 
The <img> tag has a required modifier, named src, to specify the URL of the image file. For 
most browsers, the image should be in one of the formats PNG (with a file name ending in 
".png"), JPEG (with a file name ending in ".jpeg" or ".jpg"), or GIF (with a file name ending 
in ".gif"). Usually, the image is stored in the same place as the HTML document, and a relative 
URL — that is, just the name of the file — is used to specify the image file. 

The <img> tag also has several optional modifiers. It's a good idea to always include the 
height and width modifiers, which specify the size of the image in pixels. Some browsers 
handle images better if they know in advance how big they are. The align modifier can be 
used to affect the placement of the image: "align=right" will shove the image to the right edge 
of the page, and the text on the page will flow around the image; "align=left" works similarly. 
(Unfortunately, "align=center" doesn't have the meaning you would expect. Browsers treat 
images as if they are just big characters. Images can occur inside paragraphs, links, and 
headings, for example. Alignment values of center, top, and bottom are used to specify how 
the image should line up with other characters in a line of text: Should the baseline of the text 
be at the center, the top, or the bottom of the image? Alignment values of right and left 
were added to HTML later, but they are the most useful values. If you want an image centered 
on the page, put it inside a <p align=center> tag.) 

For example, here is HTML code that will place an image from a file named figurel.png on 
the page. 

<img src="f igurel .png" align=right height=150 width=100> 

The image is 100 pixels wide and 150 pixels high, and it will appear on the right edge of the 
page. 

6.2.4 Applets on Web Pages 

The main point of this whole discussion of HTML is to learn how to use applets on the Web. 
The <applet> tag can be used to add a Java applet to a Web page. This tag must have a 
matching </applet>. A required modifier named code gives the name of the compiled class 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



243 



file that contains the applet class. The modifiers height and width are required to specify the 
size of the applet, in pixels. If you want the applet to be centered on the page, you can put the 
applet in a paragraph with center alignment. So, an applet tag to display an applet named 
HelloWorldApplet centered on a Web page would look like this: 

<p align=center> 

<applet code="HelloWorldApplet. class" height=100 width=250> 

</applet> 

</p> 

This assumes that the file HelloWorldApplet . class is located in the same directory with 
the HTML document. If this is not the case, you can use another modifier, codebase, to give 
the URL of the directory that contains the class file. The value of code itself is always just a 
class, not a URL. 

If the applet uses other classes in addition to the applet class itself, then those class files 
must be in the same directory as the applet class (always assuming that your classes are all in 
the "default package"; see Subsection 2.6.4; if not, they must be in subdirectories). If an applet 
requires more than one or two class files, it's a good idea to collect all the class files into a single 
jar file. Jar files are "archive files" which hold a number of smaller files. If your class files are 
in a jar archive, then you have to specify the name of the jar file in an archive modifier in the 
<applet> tag, as in 

<applet code="HelloWorldApplet . class" archive="HelloWorld. jar" height=50... 

I will have more to say about creating and using jar files at the end of this chapter. 

Applets can use applet parameters to customize their behavior. Applet parameters are 
specified by using <param> tags, which can only occur between an <applet> tag and the closing 
</applet>. The param tag has required modifiers named name and value, and it takes the 
form 

<param name=" (param-name } " value=" {param-value ) "> 

The parameters are available to the applet when it runs. An applet uses the predefined method 
getParameter () to check for parameters specified in param tags. The getParameter () method 
has the following interface: 

String getParameter (String paramName) 

The parameter paramName corresponds to the (param-name) in a param tag. If the specified 
paramName actually occurs in one of the param tags, then getParameter (paramName) returns 
the associated (param-value) . If the specified paramName does not occur in any param tag, then 
getParameter (paramName) returns the value null. Parameter names are case-sensitive, so you 
cannot use "size" in the param tag and ask for "Size" in getParameter. The getParameter () 
method is often called in the applet's initO method. It will not work correctly in the applet's 
constructor, since it depends on information about the applet's environment that is not available 
when the constructor is called. 

Here is an example of an applet tag with several params: 

<applet code="ShowMessage . class" width=200 height=50> 

<param name="message" value=" Goodbye World! "> 

<param name="f ont" value= " Serif "> 

<param name="size" value="36"> 
</ applet> 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



244 



The ShowMessage applet would presumably read these parameters in its init() method, 
which could go something like this: 

String message; // Instance variable: message to be displayed. 
String fontName; // Instance variable: font to use for display, 
int fontSize; // Instance variable: size of the display font. 

public void initO { 
String value ; 

value = getParameter ("message") ; // Get message param, if any. 
if (value == null) 

message = "Hello World!"; // Default value, if no param is present, 
else 

message = value; // Value from PARAM tag. 
value = getParameter ("f ont") ; 
if (value == null) 

fontName = "SansSerif"; // Default value, if no param is present, 
else 

fontName = value; 
value = getParameter (" size" ) ; 
try { 

fontSize = Integer .parselnt (value) ; // Convert string to number. 

} 

catch (NumberFormatException e) { 

fontSize =20; // Default value, if no param is present, or if 
y II the parameter value is not a legal integer. 



Elsewhere in the applet, the instance variables message, fontName, and fontSize would be 
used to determine the message displayed by the applet and the appearance of that message. 
Note that the value returned by getParameter () is always a String. If the param represents 
a numerical value, the string must be converted into a number, as is done here for the size 
parameter. 

6.3 Graphics and Painting 

Everything you see on a computer screen has to be drawn there, even the text. The (online) 
Java API includes a range of classes and methods that are devoted to drawing. In this section, 
I'll look at some of the most basic of these. 

The physical structure of a GUI is built of components. The term component refers to a 
visual element in a GUI, including buttons, menus, text-input boxes, scroll bars, check boxes, 
and so on. In Java, GUI components are represented by objects belonging to subclasses of the 
class java. awt . Component. Most components in the Swing GUI — although not top-level com- 
ponents like J Applet and JFrame — belong to subclasses of the class j avax . swing . JComponent, 
which is itself a subclass of j ava . awt . Component. Every component is responsible for drawing 
itself. If you want to use a standard component, you only have to add it to your applet or frame. 
You don't have to worry about painting it on the screen. That will happen automatically, since 
it already knows how to draw itself. 

Sometimes, however, you do want to draw on a component. You will have to do this 
whenever you want to display something that is not included among the standard, pre-defined 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



245 



component classes. When you want to do this, you have to define your own component class 
and provide a method in that class for drawing the component. I will always use a subclass 
of JPanel when I need a drawing surface of this kind, as I did for the MessageDisplay class in 
the example Hello World Applet Java in the previous section. A JPanel, like any JComponent, 
draws its content in the method 

public void paintComponent (Graphics g) 

To create a drawing surface, you should define a subclass of JPanel and provide a custom 
paintComponent () method. Create an object belonging to this class and use it in your applet 
or frame. When the time comes for your component to be drawn on the screen, the system 
will call its paintComponent () to do the drawing. That is, the code that you put into the 
paintComponent () method will be executed whenever the panel needs to be drawn on the 
screen; by writing this method, you determine the picture that will be displayed in the panel. 

Note that the paintComponent () method has a parameter of type Graphics. The Graphics 
object will be provided by the system when it calls your method. You need this object to 
do the actual drawing. To do any drawing at all in Java, you need a graphics context. A 
graphics context is an object belonging to the class java. awt .Graphics. Instance methods 
are provided in this class for drawing shapes, text, and images. Any given Graphics object 
can draw to only one location. In this chapter, that location will always be a GUI component 
belonging to some subclass of JPanel. The Graphics class is an abstract class, which means 
that it is impossible to create a graphics context directly, with a constructor. There are actually 
two ways to get a graphics context for drawing on a component: First of all, of course, when 
the paintComponent () method of a component is called by the system, the parameter to that 
method is a graphics context for drawing on the component. Second, every component has 
an instance method called getGraphics () . This method is a function that returns a graphics 
context that can be used for drawing on the component outside its paintComponent () method. 
The official line is that you should not do this, and I will almost always avoid it. But I have 
found it convenient to use getGraphics () in a few examples. 

The paintComponent () method in the JPanel class simply fills the panel with the panel's 
background color. When defining a subclass of JPanel for use as a drawing surface, you will 
usually want to fill the panel with the background color before drawing other content onto 
the panel (although it is not necessary to do this if the drawing commands in the method 
cover the background of the component completely). This is traditionally done with a call to 
super. paintComponent (g), so most paintComponent () methods that you write will have the 
form: 

public void paintComponent (g) { 
super . paintComponent (g) ; 

. . . / / Draw the content of the component . 

} 

* * * 

Most components do, in fact, do all drawing operations in their paintComponent () methods. 
What happens if, in the middle of some other method, you realize that the content of the 
component needs to be changed? You should not call paintComponent () directly to make the 
change; this method is meant to be called only by the system. Instead, you have to inform 
the system that the component needs to be redrawn, and let the system do its job by calling 
paintComponent () . You do this by calling the component's repaint () method. The method 

public void repaint (); 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



246 



is defined in the Component class, and so can be used with any component. You should call 
repaint () to inform the system that the component needs to be redrawn. It is important to 
understand that the repaint () method returns immediately, without doing any painting itself. 
The system will call the component's paintComponent () method later, as soon as it gets a 
chance to do so, after processing other pending events if there are any. 

Note that the system can also call paintComponent () for other reasons. It is called when 
the component first appears on the screen. It will also be called if the size of the component 
changes, which can happen when the user resizes the window that contains the component. In 
versions of Java earlier than Java 6, paintComponent () is also called if the component is covered 
up and then uncovered, since the system did not automatically save a copy of the content. (And 
even in Java 6, the content is not automatically saved if is drawn with a graphics context created 
by getGraphics () , as I will do in some examples.) In any case, paintComponent () should be 
capable of redrawing the content of the component on demand. As you will see, however, some 
of our early examples will not be able to do this correctly. 

This means that, to work properly, the paintComponent () method must be smart enough 
to correctly redraw the component at any time. To make this possible, a program should store 
data in its instance variables about the state of the component. These variables should contain 
all the information necessary to redraw the component completely. The paintComponent () 
method should use the data in these variables to decide what to draw. When the program 
wants to change the content of the component, it should not simply draw the new content. It 
should change the values of the relevant variables and call repaint ( ) . When the system calls 
paintComponent () , that method will use the new values of the variables and will draw the 
component with the desired modifications. This might seem a roundabout way of doing things. 
Why not just draw the modifications directly? There are at least two reasons. First of all, it 
really does turn out to be easier to get things right if all drawing is done in one method. Second, 
even if you do make modifications directly, you still have to make the paintComponent () 
method aware of them in some way so that it will be able to redraw the component correctly 
on demand. 

You will see how all this works in practice as we work through examples in the rest of this 
chapter. For now, we will spend the rest of this section looking at how to get some actual 
drawing done. 

6.3.1 Coordinates 

The screen of a computer is a grid of little squares called pixels . The color of each pixel can be 
set individually, and drawing on the screen just means setting the colors of individual pixels. 



x = 



x = width 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



247 



A graphics context draws in a rectangle made up of pixels. A position in the rectangle 
is specified by a pair of integer coordinates, (x,y). The upper left corner has coordinates 
(0,0). The x coordinate increases from left to right, and the y coordinate increases from top 
to bottom. The illustration shows a 16-by-10 pixel component (with very large pixels). A small 
line, rectangle, and oval are shown as they would be drawn by coloring individual pixels. (Note 
that, properly speaking, the coordinates don't belong to the pixels but to the grid lines between 
them.) 

For any component, you can find out the size of the rectangle that it occupies by calling 
the instance methods getWidthO and getHeight () , which return the number of pixels in the 
horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. In general, it's not a good idea to assume that 
you know the size of a component, since the size is often set by a layout manager and can 
even change if the component is in a window and that window is resized by the user. This 
means that it's good form to check the size of a component before doing any drawing on that 
component. For example, you can use a paint Component () method that looks like: 

public void paintComponent (Graphics g) { 
super .paintComponent(g) ; 

int width = getWidthO; // Find out the width of this component, 
int height = getHeightO; // Find out its height. 
. . . // Draw the content of the component. 

} 

Of course, your drawing commands will have to take the size into account. That is, they 
will have to use (x,y) coordinates that are calculated based on the actual height and width of 
the component. 

6.3.2 Colors 

You will probably want to use some color when you draw. Java is designed to work with 
the RGB color system. An RGB color is specified by three numbers that give the level 
of red, green, and blue, respectively, in the color. A color in Java is an object of the class, 
java. awt . Color. You can construct a new color by specifying its red, blue, and green compo- 
nents. For example, 

Color myColor = new Color (r,g,b) ; 

There are two constructors that you can call in this way. In the one that I almost al- 
ways use, r, g, and b are integers in the range to 255. In the other, they are num- 
bers of type float in the range 0.0F to 1.0F. (Recall that a literal of type float is written 
with an "F" to distinguish it from a double number.) Often, you can avoid constructing 
new colors altogether, since the Color class defines several named constants representing com- 
mon colors: Color. WHITE, Color. BLACK, Color. RED, Color. GREEN, Color. BLUE, Color. CYAN, 
Color. MAGENTA, Color . YELLOW, Color. PINK, Color . ORANGE, Color. LIGHT.GRAY, Color. GRAY, 
and Color .DARK.GRAY. (There are older, alternative names for these constants that use lower 
case rather than upper case constants, such as Color. red instead of Color. RED, but the upper 
case versions are preferred because they follow the convention that constant names should be 
upper case.) 

An alternative to RGB is the HSB color system. In the HSB system, a color is specified by 
three numbers called the hue, the saturation, and the brightness . The hue is the basic color, 
ranging from red through orange through all the other colors of the rainbow. The brightness is 
pretty much what it sounds like. A fully saturated color is a pure color tone. Decreasing the 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



248 



saturation is like mixing white or gray paint into the pure color. In Java, the hue, saturation 
and brightness are always specified by values of type float in the range from 0.0F to 1.0F. The 
Color class has a static member function named getHSBColor for creating HSB colors. To 
create the color with HSB values given by h, s, and b, you can say: 

Color myColor = Color . getHSBColor (h, s ,b) ; 

For example, to make a color with a random hue that is as bright and as saturated as possible, 
you could use: 

Color randomColor = Color .getHSBColor ( (f loat) Math. random () , 1.0F, 1 . OF ); 

The type cast is necessary because the value returned by Math. random () is of type double, 
and Color .getHSBColor () requires values of type float. (By the way, you might ask why 
RGB colors are created using a constructor while HSB colors are created using a static member 
function. The problem is that we would need two different constructors, both of them with 
three parameters of type float. Unfortunately, this is impossible. You can have two constructors 
only if the number of parameters or the parameter types differ.) 

The RGB system and the HSB system are just different ways of describing the same set of 
colors. It is possible to translate between one system and the other. The best way to understand 
the color systems is to experiment with them. In the on-line version of this section, you will 
find an applet that you can use to experiment with RGB and HSB colors. 

One of the properties of a Graphics object is the current drawing color, which is used for 
all drawing of shapes and text. If g is a graphics context, you can change the current drawing 
color for g using the method g. setColor(c) , where c is a Color. For example, if you want 
to draw in green, you would just say g.setColor (Color. GREEN) before doing the drawing. 
The graphics context continues to use the color until you explicitly change it with another 
setColorO command. If you want to know what the current drawing color is, you can call the 
function g.getColor () , which returns an object of type Color. This can be useful if you want 
to change to another drawing color temporarily and then restore the previous drawing color. 

Every component has an associated foreground color and background color. Generally, 
the component is filled with the background color before anything else is drawn (although some 
components are "transparent," meaning that the background color is ignored). When a new 
graphics context is created for a component, the current drawing color is set to the foreground 
color. Note that the foreground color and background color are properties of the component, 
not of a graphics context. 

The foreground and background colors can be set by instance methods setForeground(c) 
and setBackground(c) , which are defined in the Component class and therefore are available 
for use with any component. This can be useful even for standard components, if you want 
them to use colors that are different from the defaults. 

6.3.3 Fonts 

A font represents a particular size and style of text. The same character will appear different 
in different fonts. In Java, a font is characterized by a font name, a style, and a size. The 
available font names are system dependent, but you can always use the following four strings as 
font names: "Serif, "SansSerif , "Monospaced", and "Dialog". (A "serif is a little decoration 
on a character, such as a short horizontal line at the bottom of the letter i. "SansSerif means 
"without serifs." "Monospaced" means that all the characters in the font have the same width. 
The "Dialog" font is the one that is typically used in dialog boxes.) 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



249 



The style of a font is specified using named constants that are defined in the Font class. 
You can specify the style as one of the four values: 

• Font. PLAIN, 

• Font. ITALIC, 

• Font . BOLD, or 

• Font . BOLD + Font . ITALIC. 

The size of a font is an integer. Size typically ranges from about 10 to 36, although larger 
sizes can also be used. The size of a font is usually about equal to the height of the largest 
characters in the font, in pixels, but this is not an exact rule. The size of the default font is 12. 

Java uses the class named j ava . awt . Font for representing fonts. You can construct a new 
font by specifying its font name, style, and size in a constructor: 

Font plainFont = new Font (" Serif " , Font. PLAIN, 12); 
Font bigBoldFont = new Font ( "SansSerif " , Font. BOLD, 24); 

Every graphics context has a current font, which is used for drawing text. You can change 
the current font with the setFontO method. For example, if g is a graphics context and 
bigBoldFont is a font, then the command g. setFont (bigBoldFont) will set the current font 
of g to bigBoldFont. The new font will be used for any text that is drawn after the setFont () 
command is given. You can find out the current font of g by calling the method g.getFontO, 
which returns an object of type Font. 

Every component has an associated font. It can be set with the instance method 
setFont (font) , which is defined in the Component class. When a graphics context is cre- 
ated for drawing on a component, the graphic context's current font is set equal to the font of 
the component. 

6.3.4 Shapes 

The Graphics class includes a large number of instance methods for drawing various shapes, 
such as lines, rectangles, and ovals. The shapes are specified using the (x,y) coordinate system 
described above. They are drawn in the current drawing color of the graphics context. The 
current drawing color is set to the foreground color of the component when the graphics context 
is created, but it can be changed at any time using the setColorO method. 

Here is a list of some of the most important drawing methods. With all these commands, 
any drawing that is done outside the boundaries of the component is ignored. Note that all 
these methods are in the Graphics class, so they all must be called through an object of type 
Graphics. 

• drawString (String str, int x, int y) — Draws the text given by the string str. 
The string is drawn using the current color and font of the graphics context, x specifies 
the position of the left end of the string, y is the y-coordinate of the baseline of the 
string. The baseline is a horizontal line on which the characters rest. Some parts of the 
characters, such as the tail on a y or g, extend below the baseline. 

• drawLine(int xl, int yl, int x2, int y2) — Draws a line from the point (xl.yl) 
to the point (x2,y2). The line is drawn as if with a pen that hangs one pixel to the 
right and one pixel down from the (x,y) point where the pen is located. For example, if 
g refers to an object of type Graphics, then the command g.drawLine(x,y,x,y), which 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



250 



corresponds to putting the pen down at a point, colors the single pixel with upper left 
corner at the point (x,y). 

• drawRect (int x, int y, int width, int height) — Draws the outline of a rectangle. 
The upper left corner is at (x,y), and the width and height of the rectangle are as 
specified. If width equals height, then the rectangle is a square. If the width or the 
height is negative, then nothing is drawn. The rectangle is drawn with the same pen 
that is used for drawLine(). This means that the actual width of the rectangle as drawn 
is width+1, and similarly for the height. There is an extra pixel along the right edge and 
the bottom edge. For example, if you want to draw a rectangle around the edges of the 
component, you can say "g. drawRect (0, 0, getWidthO -1 , getHeight () -1) ;", where 
g is a graphics context for the component. If you use "g. drawRect (0, 0, getWidthO , 
getHeight ()) ;", then the right and bottom edges of the rectangle will be drawn outside 
the component and will not appear on the screen. 

• draw0val(int x, int y, int width, int height) — Draws the outline of an oval. 
The oval is one that just fits inside the rectangle specified by x, y, width, and height. If 
width equals height, the oval is a circle. 

• drawRoundRect (int x, int y, int width, int height, int xdiam, int ydiam) - 

Draws the outline of a rectangle with rounded corners. The basic rectangle is specified by 
x, y, width, and height, but the corners are rounded. The degree of rounding is given by 
xdiam and ydiam. The corners are arcs of an ellipse with horizontal diameter xdiam and 
vertical diameter ydiam. A typical value for xdiam and ydiam is 16, but the value used 
should really depend on how big the rectangle is. 

• draw3DRect (int x, int y, int width, int height, boolean raised) — Draws the 
outline of a rectangle that is supposed to have a three-dimensional effect, as if it is raised 
from the screen or pushed into the screen. The basic rectangle is specified by x, y, width, 
and height. The raised parameter tells whether the rectangle seems to be raised from the 
screen or pushed into it. The 3D effect is achieved by using brighter and darker versions 
of the drawing color for different edges of the rectangle. The documentation recommends 
setting the drawing color equal to the background color before using this method. The 
effect won't work well for some colors. 

• drawArc(int x, int y, int width, int height, int startAngle, int arcAngle) - 

Draws part of the oval that just fits inside the rectangle specified by x, y, width, and 
height. The part drawn is an arc that extends arcAngle degrees from a starting angle 
at startAngle degrees. Angles are measured with degrees at the 3 o'clock position (the 
positive direction of the horizontal axis). Positive angles are measured counterclockwise 
from zero, and negative angles are measured clockwise. To get an arc of a circle, make 
sure that width is equal to height. 

• fillRect(int x, int y, int width, int height) — Draws a filled- in rectangle. This 
fills in the interior of the rectangle that would be drawn by drawRect (x,y, width, height) . 
The extra pixel along the bottom and right edges is not included. The width and 
height parameters give the exact width and height of the rectangle. For example, if you 
wanted to fill in the entire component, you could say "g.f illRect(0, 0, getWidthO , 
getHeight ());" 

• fill0val(int x, int y, int width, int height) — Draws a filled-in oval. 

• f illRoundRect (int x, int y, int width, int height, int xdiam, int ydiam) - 

Draws a filled-in rounded rectangle. 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



251 



• f ill3DRect (int x, int y, int width, int height, boolean raised) - - Draws a 
filled-in three-dimensional rectangle. 

• fillArc(int x, int y, int width, int height, int startAngle, int arcAngle) - 

Draw a filled-in arc. This looks like a wedge of pie, whose crust is the arc that would be 
drawn by the drawArc method. 

6.3.5 Graphics2D 

All drawing in Java is done through an object of type Graphics. The Graphics class provides 
basic commands for such things as drawing shapes and text and for selecting a drawing color. 
These commands are adequate in many cases, but they fall far short of what's needed in a 
serious computer graphics program. Java has another class, Graphics2D, that provides a larger 
set of drawing operations. Graphics2D is a sub-class of Graphics, so all the methods from the 
Graphics class are also available in a Graphics2D. 

The paintComponent () method of a JComponent gives you a graphics context of type 
Graphics that you can use for drawing on the component. In fact, the graphics context actually 
belongs to the sub-class Graphics2D (in Java version 1.2 and later), and can be type-cast to 
gain access to the advanced Graphics2D drawing methods: 

public void paintComponent (Graphics g) { 
super . paintComponent (g) ; 
Graphics2D g2; 
g2 = (Graphics2D)g; 

. // Draw on the component using g2. 

} 

Drawing in Graphics2D is based on shapes, which are objects that implement an interface 
named Shape. Shape classes include Line2D, Rectangle2D, Ellipse2D, Arc2D, and GeneralPath, 
among others; all these classes are defined in the package java. awt . geom. Graphics2D has 
methods draw(Shape) and fill (Shape) for drawing the outline of a shape and for filling its 
interior. Advanced capabilities include: lines that are more than one pixel thick, dotted and 
dashed lines, filling a shape with a texture (that is, with a repeated image), filling a shape with 
a gradient, and so-called "anti-aliased" drawing (which cuts down on the jagged appearance 
along a slanted line or curve). 

In the Graphics class, coordinates are specified as integers and are based on pixels. The 
shapes that are used with Graphics2D use real numbers for coordinates, and they are not neces- 
sarily bound to pixels. In fact, you can change the coordinate system and use any coordinates 
that are convenient to your application. In computer graphics terms, you can apply a "transfor- 
mation" to the coordinate system. The transformation can be any combination of translation, 
scaling, and rotation. 

I mention Graphics2D here for completeness. I will not use any of the advanced capabilities 
of Graphics2D in this chapter, but I will cover a few of them in Section 13.2. 

6.3.6 An Example 

Let's use some of the material covered in this section to write a subclass of JPanel for use as 
a drawing surface. The panel can then be used in either an applet or a frame, as discussed in 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



252 



Subsection 6.2.2. All the drawing will be done in the paintComponent () method of the panel 
class. The panel will draw multiple copies of a message on a black background. Each copy of 
the message is in a random color. Five different fonts are used, with different sizes and styles. 
The message can be specified in the constructor; if the default constructor is used, the message 
is the string "Java!". The panel works OK no matter what its size. Here is what the panel 
looks like: 




There is one problem with the way this class works. When the panel's paintComponent () 
method is called, it chooses random colors, fonts, and locations for the messages. The informa- 
tion about which colors, fonts, and locations are used is not stored anywhere. The next time 
paintComponent () is called, it will make different random choices and will draw a different 
picture. A better approach would be to compute the contents of the picture elsewhere, outside 
the paintComponent () method. Information about the picture would be stored in instance 
variables, and the paintComponent () method would use that information to draw the picture. 
If paintComponent () is called twice, it should draw the same picture twice, unless the data 
has changed in the meantime. Unfortunately, to store the data for the picture in this applet, 
we would need to use either arrays, which will not be covered until Chapter 7, or off-screen 
images, which will not be covered until Chapter 13. Other examples in this chapter will suffer 
from the same problem. 

The source for the panel class is shown below. I use an instance variable called message to 
hold the message that the panel will display. There are five instance variables of type Font that 
represent different sizes and styles of text. These variables are initialized in the constructor and 
are used in the paintComponent () method. 

The paintComponent () method for the panel simply draws 25 copies of the message. For 
each copy, it chooses one of the five fonts at random, and it calls g.setFontQ to select that 
font for drawing the text. It creates a random HSB color and uses g. setColor () to select that 
color for drawing. It then chooses random (x,y) coordinates for the location of the message. 
The x coordinate gives the horizontal position of the left end of the string. The formula used 
for the x coordinate, "-50 + (int) (Math. random () * (width+40) )" gives a random integer 
in the range from -50 to width-10. This makes it possible for the string to extend beyond the 
left edge or the right edge of the panel. Similarly, the formula for y allows the string to extend 
beyond the top and bottom of the applet. 

Here is the complete source code for the RandomStringsPanel:

import j ava . awt . Font ;

This class defines a panel, which is not something that can stand on its own. To see it on the 
screen, we have to use it in an applet or a frame. Here is a simple applet class that uses a 
RandomStringsPanel as its content pane: 

import j avax . swing . JApplet ; 

/**

* fonts, and positions for the copies. The message can be specified as the

* "message" is present, then the default message "Java!" is displayed. 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



255 



* The actual content of the applet is an object of type RandomStringsPanel . 
*/ 

public class RandomStringsApplet extends JApplet { 

public void initO { 

String message = getParameter ( "message" ) ; // If null, "Java" is used. 
RandomStringsPanel content = new RandomStringsPanel (message) ; 
setContentPane (content) ; 

} 

} 

Note that the message to be displayed in the applet can be set using an applet parameter when 
the applet is added to an HTML document. Using applets on Web pages was discussed in Sub- 
section 6.2.4. Remember that to use the applet on a Web page, you must include both the panel 
class file, RandomStringsPanel . class, and the applet class file, RandomStringsApplet . class, 
in the same directory as the HTML document (or, alternatively, bundle the two class files into 
a jar file, and put the jar file in the document directory). 

Instead of writing an applet, of course, we could use the panel in the window of a stand- 
alone application. You can find the source code for a main program that does this in the file 
RandomStrings App .j ava. 

6.4 Mouse Events 

Events are central to programming for a graphical user interface. A GUI program doesn't (online) 
have a main() routine that outlines what will happen when the program is run, in a step- by-step 
process from beginning to end. Instead, the program must be prepared to respond to various 
kinds of events that can happen at unpredictable times and in an order that the program doesn't 
control. The most basic kinds of events are generated by the mouse and keyboard. The user 
can press any key on the keyboard, move the mouse, or press a button on the mouse. The user 
can do any of these things at any time, and the computer has to respond appropriately. 

In Java, events are represented by objects. When an event occurs, the system collects all 
the information relevant to the event and constructs an object to contain that information. 
Different types of events are represented by objects belonging to different classes. For example, 
when the user presses one of the buttons on a mouse, an object belonging to a class called 
MouseEvent is constructed. The object contains information such as the source of the event 
(that is, the component on which the user clicked), the (x,y) coordinates of the point in the 
component where the click occurred, the exact time of the click, and which button on the mouse 
was pressed. When the user presses a key on the keyboard, a KeyEvent is created. After the 
event object is constructed, it is passed as a parameter to a designated method. By writing 
that method, the programmer says what should happen when the event occurs. 

As a Java programmer, you get a fairly high-level view of events. There is a lot of processing 
that goes on between the time that the user presses a key or moves the mouse and the time that 
a subroutine in your program is called to respond to the event. Fortunately, you don't need to 
know much about that processing. But you should understand this much: Even though your 
GUI program doesn't have a mainQ routine, there is a sort of main routine running somewhere 
that executes a loop of the form 

while the program is still running: 
Wait for the next event to occur 
Call a subroutine to handle the event 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



256 



This loop is called an event loop. Every GUI program has an event loop. In Java, you 
don't have to write the loop. It's part of "the system." If you write a GUI program in some 
other language, you might have to provide a main routine that runs the event loop. 

In this section, we'll look at handling mouse events in Java, and we'll cover the framework 
for handling events in general. The next section will cover keyboard-related events and timer 
events. Java also has other types of events, which are produced by GUI components. These 
will be introduced in Section 6.6. 

6.4.1 Event Handling 

For an event to have any effect, a program must detect the event and react to it. In order to 
detect an event, the program must "listen" for it. Listening for events is something that is done 
by an object called an event listener. An event listener object must contain instance methods 
for handling the events for which it listens. For example, if an object is to serve as a listener for 
events of type MouseEvent, then it must contain the following method (among several others): 

public void mousePressed (MouseEvent evt) { . . . } 

The body of the method defines how the object responds when it is notified that a mouse button 
has been pressed. The parameter, evt, contains information about the event. This information 
can be used by the listener object to determine its response. 

The methods that are required in a mouse event listener are specified in an interface 
named MouseListener. To be used as a listener for mouse events, an object must implement 
this MouseListener interface. Java interfaces were covered in Subsection 5.7.1. (To review 
briefly: An interface in Java is just a list of instance methods. A class can "implement" an 
interface by doing two things. First, the class must be declared to implement the interface, as in 
"class MouseHandler implements MouseListener" or "class MyApplet extends JApplet 
implements MouseListener". Second, the class must include a definition for each instance 
method specified in the interface. An interface can be used as the type for a variable or 
formal parameter. We say that an object implements the MouseListener interface if it belongs 
to a class that implements the MouseListener interface. Note that it is not enough for the object 
to include the specified methods. It must also belong to a class that is specifically declared to 
implement the interface.) 

Many events in Java are associated with GUI components. For example, when the user 
presses a button on the mouse, the associated component is the one that the user clicked on. 
Before a listener object can "hear" events associated with a given component, the listener object 
must be registered with the component. If a MouseListener object, mListener, needs to hear 
mouse events associated with a Component object, comp, the listener must be registered with 
the component by calling 

comp . addMouseListener (mListener) ; 

The addMouseListener () method is an instance method in class Component, and so can be 
used with any GUI component object. In our first few examples, we will listen for events on a 
JPanel that is being used (IS (\ drawing surface. 

The event classes, such as MouseEvent, and the listener interfaces, such as MouseListener, are 
defined in the package j ava . awt . event. This means that if you want to work with events, you 
should either include the line "import j ava . awt . event . * ; " at the beginning of your source 
code file or import the individual classes and interfaces. 

Admittedly, there is a large number of details to tend to when you want to use events. To 
summarize, you must 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



257 



1. Put the import specification "import java. awt . event . *; " (or individual imports) at 
the beginning of your source code; 

2. Declare that some class implements the appropriate listener interface, such as MouseLis- 
tener; 

3. Provide definitions in that class for the methods specified by the interface; 

4. Register the listener object with the component that will generate the events by calling 
a method such as addMouseListener () in the component. 

Any object can act as an event listener, provided that it implements the appropriate in- 
terface. A component can listen for the events that it itself generates. A panel can listen for 
events from components that are contained in the panel. A special class can be created just 
for the purpose of defining a listening object. Many people consider it to be good form to use 
anonymous inner classes to define listening objects (see Subsection 5.7.3). You will see all of 
these patterns in examples in this textbook. 

6.4.2 MouseEvent and MouseListener 

The MouseListener interface specifies five different instance methods: 

public void mousePressed (MouseEvent evt) ; 

public void mouseReleased (MouseEvent evt) ; 

public void mouseClicked (MouseEvent evt); 

public void mouseEntered (MouseEvent evt); 

public void mouseExited(MouseEvent evt) ; 

The mousePressed method is called as soon as the user presses down on one of the mouse 
buttons, and mouseReleased is called when the user releases a button. These are the two 
methods that are most commonly used, but any mouse listener object must define all five 
methods; you can leave the body of a method empty if you don't want to define a response. 
The mouseClicked method is called if the user presses a mouse button and then releases 
it, without moving the mouse. (When the user does this, all three routines — mousePressed, 
mouseReleased, and mouseClicked — will be called in that order.) In most cases, you should 
define mousePressed instead of mouseClicked. The mouseEntered and mouseExited methods 
are called when the mouse cursor enters or leaves the component. For example, if you want the 
component to change appearance whenever the user moves the mouse over the component, you 
could define these two methods. 

As a first example, we will look at a small addition to the RandomStringsPanel example from 
the previous section. In the new version, the panel will repaint itself when the user clicks on it. 
In order for this to happen, a mouse listener should listen for mouse events on the panel, and 
when the listener detects a mousePressed event, it should respond by calling the repaint () 
method of the panel. 

For the new version of the program, we need an object that implements the MouseListener 
interface. One way to create the object is to define a separate class, such as: 

import j ava . awt . Component ; 
import j ava . awt . event . * ; 

/** 

* An object of type Repaint OnClick is a MouseListener that 

* will respond to a mousePressed event by calling the repaint () 

* method of the source of the event. That is, a RepaintOnClick 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



258 



* object can be added as a mouse listener to any Component; 

* when the user clicks that component, the component will be 

* repainted. 
*/ 

public class RepaintOnClick implements MouseListener { 

public void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt) { 

Component source = (Component) evt . getSource () ; 

source . repaint () ; // Call repaintO on the Component that was clicked. 

} 

public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent evt) { } 
public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent evt) { } 
public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent evt) { } 
public void mouseExited(MouseEvent evt) { } 

} 

This class does three of the four things that we need to do in order to handle mouse events: 
First, it imports j ava . awt . event . * for easy access to event-related classes. Second, it is 
declared that the class "implements MouseListener". And third, it provides definitions for 
the five methods that are specified in the MouseListener interface. (Note that four of the five 
event-handling methods have empty definitions. We really only want to define a response to 
mousePressed events, but in order to implement the MouseListener interface, a class must 
define all five methods.) 

We must do one more thing to set up the event handling for this example: We must register 
an event-handling object as a listener with the component that will generate the events. In 
this case, the mouse events that we are interested in will be generated by an object of type 
RandomStringsPanel. If panel is a variable that refers to the panel object, we can create a 
mouse listener object and register it with the panel with the statements: 

RepaintOnClick listener = new RepaintOnClick () ; // Create MouseListener object, 
panel. addMouseListener (listener) ; // Register MouseListener with the panel. 

Once this is done, the listener object will be notified of mouse events on the panel. When a 
mousePressed event occurs, the mousePressedO method in the listener will be called. The 
code in this method calls the repaintO method in the component that is the source of the 
event, that is, in the panel. The result is that the RandomStringsPanel is repainted with its 
strings in new random colors, fonts, and positions. 

Although we have written the RepaintOnClick class for use with our RandomStringsPanel 
example, the event-handling class contains no reference at all to the RandomStringsPanel class. 
How can this be? The mousePressedO method in class RepaintOnClick looks at the source 
of the event, and calls its repaintO method. If we have registered the RepaintOnClick object 
as a listener on a RandomStringsPanel, then it is that panel that is repainted. But the listener 
object could be used with any type of component, and it would work in the same way. 

Similarly, the RandomStringsPanel class contains no reference to the RepaintOnClick class — 
in fact, RandomStringsPanel was written before we even knew anything about mouse events! 
The panel will send mouse events to any object that has registered with it as a mouse listener. 
It does not need to know anything about that object except that it is capable of receiving mouse 
events. 

The relationship between an object that generates an event and an object that responds 
to that event is rather loose. The relationship is set up by registering one object to listen for 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



259 



events from the other object. This is something that can potentially be done from outside 
both objects. Each object can be developed independently, with no knowledge of the internal 
operation of the other object. This is the essence of modular design: Build a complex system 
out of modules that interact only in straightforward, easy to understand ways. Then each 
module is a separate design problem that can be tackled independently. Java's event-handling 
framework is designed to offer strong support for modular design. 

To make this clearer, consider the application version of the ClickableRandomStrings 
program. I have included RepaintOnClick as a nested class, although it could just as easily be 
a separate class. The main point is that this program uses the same RandomStringsPanel class 
that was used in the original program, which did not respond to mouse clicks. The mouse 
handling has been "bolted on" to an existing class, without having to make any changes at all 
to that class: 

import j ava . awt . Component ; 

import j ava . awt . event . MouseEvent ; 

import java. awt . event . MouseListener ; 

import j avax . swing . JFrame ; 

/** 

* Displays a window that shows 25 copies of the string "Java!" in 

* random colors, fonts, and positions. The content of the window 

* is an object of type RandomStringsPanel. When the user clicks 

* the window, the content of the window is repainted, with the 

* strings in newly selected random colors, fonts, and positions. 
*/ 

public class ClickableRandomStringsApp { 

public static void main(String[] args) { 

JFrame window = new JFrame ( "Random Strings"); 
RandomStringsPanel content = new RandomStringsPanel () ; 

content . addMouseListener ( new RepaintOnClickO ); //Register mouse listener. 
window. setContentPane (content) ; 

window. setDef aultCloseOperat ion (JFrame . EXIT_0N_CL0SE) ; 
window. setLocation(100 , 75) ;

public void mouseEntered (MouseEvent evt) { } 
public void mouseExited (MouseEvent evt) { } 



} 

} 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



260 



6.4.3 Mouse Coordinates 

Often, when a mouse event occurs, you want to know the location of the mouse cursor. This 
information is available from the MouseEvent parameter to the event-handling method, which 
contains instance methods that return information about the event. If evt is the parame- 
ter, then you can find out the coordinates of the mouse cursor by calling evt.getXO and 
evt.getYQ. These methods return integers which give the x and y coordinates where the 
mouse cursor was positioned at the time when the event occurred. The coordinates are ex- 
pressed in the coordinate system of the component that generated the event, where the top left 
corner of the component is (0,0). 

The user can hold down certain modifier keys while using the mouse. The possible modifier 
keys include: the Shift key, the Control key, the Alt key (called the Option key on the Mac), 
and the Meta key (called the Command or Apple key on the Mac). You might want to respond 
to a mouse event differently when the user is holding down a modifier key. The boolean- 
valued instance methods evt . isShif tDown() , evt . isControlDownO , evt . isAltDownO , and 
evt . isMetaDownQ can be called to test whether the modifier keys are pressed. 

You might also want to have different responses depending on whether the user presses 
the left mouse button, the middle mouse button, or the right mouse button. Now, not every 
mouse has a middle button and a right button, so Java handles the information in a peculiar 
way. It treats pressing the right button as equivalent to holding down the Meta key while 
pressing the left mouse button. That is, if the right button is pressed, then the instance 
method evt . isMetaDownO will return true (even if the Meta key is not pressed). Similarly, 
pressing the middle mouse button is equivalent to holding down the Alt key. In practice, what 
this really means is that pressing the right mouse button under Windows or Linux is equivalent 
to holding down the Command key while pressing the mouse button on the Mac. A program 
tests for either of these by calling evt . isMetaDownQ . 

As an example, consider a JPanel that does the following: Clicking on the panel with the left 
mouse button will place a red rectangle on the panel at the point where the mouse was clicked. 
Clicking with the right mouse button (or holding down the Command key while clicking on a 
Mac) will place a blue oval on the applet. Holding down the Shift key while clicking will clear 
the panel by removing all the shapes that have been placed. 

There are several ways to write this example. There could be a separate class to handle 
mouse events, as in the previous example. However, in this case, I decided to let the panel itself 
respond to mouse events. Any object can be a mouse listener, as long as it implements the 
MouseListener interface. In this case, the panel class implements the MouseListener interface, 
so the object that represents the main panel of the program can be the mouse listener for the 
program. The constructor for the panel class contains the statement 

addMouseListener (this) ; 

which is equivalent to saying this . addMouseListener (this) . Now, the ordinary way to 
register a mouse listener is to say X. addMouseListener (Y) where Y is the listener and X is the 
component that will generate the mouse events. In the statement addMouseListener (this) , 
both roles are played by this; that is, "this object" (the panel) is generating mouse events 
and is also listening for those events. Although this might seem a little strange, you should get 
used to seeing things like this. In a large program, however, it's usually a better idea to write a 
separate class to do the listening in order to have a more organized division of responsibilities. 

The source code for the panel class is shown below. You should check how the instance 
methods in the MouseEvent object are used. You can also check for the Four Steps of Event

g. setColor (Color. BLUE) ; // Blue interior. 

g.fillOvaK x - 30, y - 15, 60, 30 ); 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



262 



g. setColor (Color. BLACK) ; // Black outline. 
g.drawOvaK x - 30 , y - 15 , 60 , 30 ) ; 

} 

else { 

// User left-clicked (or middle-clicked) at (x,y) . 

// Draw a red rectangle centered at (x,y). 
g. setColor (Color .RED) ; // Red interior. 
g.fillRect( x - 30, y - 15, 60, 30 ); 
g. setColor (Color . BLACK) ; // Black outline. 
g.drawRect( x - 30 , y - 15 , 60 , 30 ) ; 

} 

g.disposeO; // We are finished with the graphics context, so dispose of it. 
} // end mousePressedO ; 

// The next four empty routines are required by the MouseListener interface. 
// They don't do anything in this class, so their definitions are empty. 

public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent evt) { } 
public void mouseExited(MouseEvent evt) { } 
public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent evt) { } 
public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent evt) { } 

} // end class SimpleStamperPanel 

Note, by the way, that this class violates the rule that all drawing should be done 
in a paintComponent () method. The rectangles and ovals are drawn directly in the 
mousePressedO routine. To make this possible, I need to obtain a graphics context by saying 
"g = getGraphicsO". After using g for drawing, I call g.disposeO to inform the operating 
system that I will no longer be using g for drawing. It is a good idea to do this to free the 
system resources that are used by the graphics context. I do not advise doing this type of direct 
drawing if it can be avoided, but you can see that it does work in this case, and at this point 
we really have no other way to write this example. 

6.4.4 MouseMotionListeners and Dragging 

Whenever the mouse is moved, it generates events. The operating system of the computer 
detects these events and uses them to move the mouse cursor on the screen. It is also possible 
for a program to listen for these "mouse motion" events and respond to them. The most 
common reason to do so is to implement dragging . Dragging occurs when the user moves the 
mouse while holding down a mouse button. 

The methods for responding to mouse motion events are defined in an interface named 
MouseMotionListener. This interface specifies two event-handling methods: 

public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent evt); 
public void mouseMoved(MouseEvent evt) ; 

The mouseDragged method is called if the mouse is moved while a button on the mouse 
is pressed. If the mouse is moved while no mouse button is down, then mouseMoved is called 
instead. The parameter, evt, is an object of type MouseEvent. It contains the x and y coordi- 
nates of the mouse's location. As long as the user continues to move the mouse, one of these 
methods will be called over and over. (So many events are generated that it would be inefficient 
for a program to hear them all, if it doesn't want to do anything in response. This is why the 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



263 



mouse motion event-handlers are denned in a separate interface from the other mouse events: 
You can listen for the mouse events defined in MouseListener without automatically hearing all 
mouse motion events as well.) 

If you want your program to respond to mouse motion events, you must create an object 
that implements the MouseMotionListener interface, and you must register that object to listen 
for events. The registration is done by calling a component's addMouseMotionListener () 
method. The object will then listen for mouseDragged and mouseMoved events associated with 
that component. In most cases, the listener object will also implement the MouseListener 
interface so that it can respond to the other mouse events as well. 

To get a better idea of how mouse events work, you should try the SimpleTrackMouseApplet 
in the on-line version of this section. The applet is programmed to respond to any of the seven 
different kinds of mouse events by displaying the coordinates of the mouse, the type of event, and 
a list of the modifier keys that are down (Shift, Control, Meta, and Alt). You can experiment 
with the applet to see what happens when you use the mouse on the applet. (Alternatively, 
you could run the stand-alone application version of the program, SimpleTrackMouse.java.) 

The source code for the program can be found in SimpleTrackMousePanel.java, which defines 
the panel that is used as the content pane, and in SimpleTrackMouseApplet Java, which defines 
the applet class. The panel class includes a nested class, MouseHandler, that defines the mouse- 
handling object. I encourage you to read the source code. You should now be familiar with all 
the techniques that it uses. 

It is interesting to look at what a program needs to do in order to respond to dragging op- 
erations. In general, the response involves three methods: mousePressedO , mouseDragged () , 
and mouseReleasedO . The dragging gesture starts when the user presses a mouse button, 
it continues while the mouse is dragged, and it ends when the user releases the button. This 
means that the programming for the response to one dragging gesture must be spread out over 
the three methods! Furthermore, the mouseDragged () method can be called many times as the 
mouse moves. To keep track of what is going on between one method call and the next, you 
need to set up some instance variables. In many applications, for example, in order to process 
a mouseDragged event, you need to remember the previous coordinates of the mouse. You can 
store this information in two instance variables prevX and prevY of type int. It can also be 
useful to save the starting coordinates, where the original mousePressed event occurred, in 
instance variables. I also suggest having a boolean variable, dragging, which is set to true 
while a dragging gesture is being processed. This is necessary because in many applications, 
not every mousePressed event starts a dragging operation to which you want to respond. The 
mouseDragged and mouseReleased methods can use the value of dragging to check whether 
a drag operation is actually in progress. You might need other instance variables as well, but 
in general outline, a class that handles mouse dragging looks like this: 

import j ava . awt . event . * ; 

public class MouseDragHandler implements MouseListener, MouseMotionListener { 

private int startX, startY; // Point where the original mousePress occurred, 
private int prevX, prevY; // Most recently processed mouse coords, 
private boolean dragging; // Set to true when dragging is in process. 
. . . // other instance variables for use in dragging 

public void mousePressed (MouseEvent evt) { 
if ( we-want-to-start-dragging ) { 
dragging = true ; 

startX = evt.getXO; // Remember starting position. 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



264 



startY = evt.getYO; 

prevX = startX; // Remember most recent coords. 

prevY = startY; 

. // Other processing. 

} 

} 

public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent evt) { 

if ( dragging == false ) // First, check if we are 

return; // processing a dragging gesture, 

int x = evt.getXO; // Current position of Mouse, 
int y = evt.getYO; 

// Process a mouse movement from (prevX, prevY) to (x,y). 

prevX = x; // Remember the current position for the next call. 
prevY = y; 

} 

public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent evt) { 

if ( dragging == false ) // First, check if we are 

return; // processing a dragging gesture, 

dragging = false; // We are done dragging. 

// Other processing and clean-up. 

> 

} 

As an example, let's look at a typical use of dragging: allowing the user to sketch a curve by 
dragging the mouse. This example also shows many other features of graphics and mouse pro- 
cessing. In the program, you can draw a curve by dragging the mouse on a large white drawing 
area, and you can select a color for drawing by clicking on one of several colored rectangles 
to the right of the drawing area. The complete source code can be found in SimplePaint.java, 
which can be run as a stand-alone application, and you can find an applet version in the on-line 
version of this section. Here is a picture of the program: 




CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



265 



I will discuss a few aspects of the source code here, but I encourage you to read it carefully 
in its entirety. There are lots of informative comments in the source code. (The source code 
uses one unusual technique: It defines a subclass of JApplet, but it also includes a main() 
routine. The mainO routine has nothing to do with the class's use as an applet, but it makes it 
possible to run the class as a stand-alone application. When this is done, the application opens 
a window that shows the same panel that would be shown in the applet version. This example 
thus shows how to write a single file that can be used either as a stand-alone application or as 
an applet.) 

The panel class for this example is designed to work for any reasonable size, that is, unless 
the panel is too small. This means that coordinates are computed in terms of the actual 
width and height of the panel. (The width and height are obtained by calling getWidthO and 
getHeight () .) This makes things quite a bit harder than they would be if we assumed some 
particular fixed size for the panel. Let's look at some of these computations in detail. For 
example, the large white drawing area extends from y = 3 to y = height - 3 vertically and 
from x = 3 to x = width - 56 horizontally. These numbers are needed in order to interpret 
the meaning of a mouse click. They take into account a gray border around the panel and the 
color palette along the right edge of the panel. The gray border is 3 pixels wide. The colored 
rectangles are 50 pixels wide. Together with the 3-pixel border around the panel and a 3-pixel 
divider between the drawing area and the colored rectangles, this adds up to put the right edge 
of the drawing area 56 pixels from the right edge of the panel. 

A white square labeled "CLEAR" occupies a 50-by-50 pixel region beneath the colored rect- 
angles on the right edge of the panel. Allowing for this square, we can figure out how much 
vertical space is available for the seven colored rectangles, and then divide that space by 7 to 
get the vertical space available for each rectangle. This quantity is represented by a variable, 
colorSpace. Out of this space, 3 pixels are used as spacing between the rectangles, so the height 
of each rectangle is colorSpace - 3. The top of the N-th rectangle is located (N*colorSpace 
+ 3) pixels down from the top of the panel, assuming that we count the rectangles starting 
with zero. This is because there are N rectangles above the N-th rectangle, each of which uses 
colorSpace pixels. The extra 3 is for the border at the top of the panel. After all that, we can 
write down the command for drawing the N-th rectangle: 

g.fillRect (width - 53, N*colorSpace + 3, 50, colorSpace - 3); 

That was not easy! But it shows the kind of careful thinking and precision graphics that are 
sometimes necessary to get good results. 

The mouse in this program is used to do three different things: Select a color, clear the 
drawing, and draw a curve. Only the third of these involves dragging, so not every mouse 
click will start a dragging operation. The mousePressedO method has to look at the (x,y) 
coordinates where the mouse was clicked and decide how to respond. If the user clicked on 
the CLEAR rectangle, the drawing area is cleared by calling repaint (). If the user clicked 
somewhere in the strip of colored rectangles, the corresponding color is selected for drawing. 
This involves computing which color the user clicked on, which is done by dividing the y 
coordinate by colorSpace. Finally, if the user clicked on the drawing area, a drag operation is 
initiated. In this case, a boolean variable, dragging, is set to true so that the mouseDragged 
and mouseReleased methods will know that a curve is being drawn. The code for this follows 
the general form given above. The actual drawing of the curve is done in the mouseDragged () 
method, which draws a line from the previous location of the mouse to its current location. 
Some effort is required to make sure that the line does not extend beyond the white drawing area 
of the panel. This is not automatic, since as far as the computer is concerned, the border and 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



266 



the color bar are part of the drawing surface. If the user drags the mouse outside the drawing 
area while drawing a line, the mouseDraggedO routine changes the x and y coordinates to 
make them lie within the drawing area. 

6.4.5 Anonymous Event Handlers and Adapter Classes 

As I mentioned above, it is a fairly common practice to use anonymous inner classes to define 
listener objects. As discussed in Subsection 5.7.3, a special form of the new operator is used to 
create an object that belongs to an anonymous class. For example, a mouse listener object can 
be created with an expression of the form: 

new MouseListener () { 

public void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt) { . . . } 
public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent evt) { . . . } 
public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent evt) { . . . } 
public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent evt) { . . . } 
public void mouseExited(MouseEvent evt) { . . . } 

} 

This is all just one long expression that both defines an unnamed class and creates an object 
that belongs to that class. To use the object as a mouse listener, it can be passed as the 
parameter to some component's addMouseListener () method in a command of the form: 



component . addMouseListener ( new MouseListener () { 

public void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt) { . . . } 

public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent evt) { . . . } 

public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent evt) { . . . } 

public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent evt) { . . . } 

public void mouseExited(MouseEvent evt) { . . . } 

} ); 



Now, in a typical application, most of the method definitions in this class will be empty. 
A class that implements an interface must provide definitions for all the methods in that 
interface, even if the definitions are empty. To avoid the tedium of writing empty method 
definitions in cases like this, Java provides adapter classes. An adapter class implements 
a listener interface by providing empty definitions for all the methods in the interface. An 
adapter class is useful only as a basis for making subclasses. In the subclass, you can define just 
those methods that you actually want to use. For the remaining methods, the empty definitions 
that are provided by the adapter class will be used. The adapter class for the MouseListener 
interface is named MouseAdapter. For example, if you want a mouse listener that only responds 
to mouse-pressed events, you can use a command of the form: 

component . addMouseListener ( new MouseAdapter () { 

public void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt) { . . . } 

} ); 

To see how this works in a real example, let's write another version of the ClickableRandom- 
StringsApp application from Subsection 6.4.2. This version uses an anonymous class based on 
MouseAdapter to handle mouse events: 

import j ava . awt . Component ; 

import j ava . awt . event . MouseAdapter ; 

import j ava . awt . event . MouseEvent ; 

import java. awt . event .MouseListener; 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



267 



import j avax . swing . JFrame ; 

public class ClickableRandomStringsApp { 

public static void main (String [] args) { 

JFrame window = new JFrame ( "Random Strings"); 
RandomStringsPanel content = new RandomStringsPanelO ; 

content . addMouseListener( new MouseAdapterO { 

// Register a mouse listener that is defined by an anonymous subclass 
// of MouseAdapter. This replaces the RepaintOnClick class that was 
// used in the original version, 
public void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt) { 

Component source = (Component) evt . getSourceO ; 
source. repaint () ; 

} 

> ;,• 

window. setContentPane (content) ; 

window. setDef aultCloseOperation( JFrame . EXIT_0N_CL0SE) ; 
window. setLocation(100 , 75) ; 
window . setSize (300 , 240) ; 
window. setVisible (true) ; 

> 



There is also an adapter class for mouse motion listeners, MouseMotion Adapter, which imple- 
ments MouseMotionListener and defines empty versions of mouseDraggedO and mouseMovedO . 
In Java 6 and later, the MouseAdapter class actually implements MouseMotionListener as well 
as MouseListener, so there is less use for MouseMotionAdapter. 

Anonymous inner classes can be used for other purposes besides event handling. For ex- 
ample, suppose that you want to define a subclass of JPanel to represent a drawing surface. 
The subclass will only be used once. It will redefine the paint Component () method, but will 
make no other changes to JPanel. It might make sense to define the subclass as an anony- 
mous inner class. As an example, I present HelloWorldGUI4.java. This version is a variation 
of Hello WorldGUI2.java that uses anonymous inner classes where the original program uses 
ordinary, named nested classes: 

import j ava . awt . * ; 
import j ava . awt . event . * ; 
import j avax . swing . * ; 

/** 

* A simple GUI program that creates and opens a JFrame containing 

* the message "Hello World" and an "OK" button. When the user clicks 

* the OK button, the program ends. This version uses anonymous 

* classes to define the message display panel and the action listener 

* object. Compare to HelloWorldGUI2 , which uses nested classes. 
*/ 

public class HelloWorldGUI4 { 
/** 

* The main program creates a window containing a display panel 

* and a button that will end the program when the user clicks it. 
*/ 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



268 



public static void main (String [] args) { 

JPanel displayPanel = new JPanelO { 

// An anonymous subclass of JPanel that displays "Hello World!", 
public void paintComponent (Graphics g) { 
super. paintComponent (g) ; 
g . drawString ( "Hello World!", 20, 30 ); 

} 

>; 

JButton okButton = new JButtonO'OK") ; 

okButton. addActionListener( new ActionListenerO { 

//An anonymous class that defines the listener object, 
public void actionPerf ormed(ActionEvent e) { 
System. exit (0) ; 

y 

} ); 

JPanel content = new JPanelO; 
content . setLayout (new BorderLayout () ) ; 
content . add (displayPanel , BorderLayout . CENTER) ; 
content . add (okButton, BorderLayout . SOUTH) ; 

JFrame window = new JFrameO'GUI Test"); 
window. setContentPane (content) ; 
window. setSize(250, 100) ; 
window. setLocation(100 , 100) ; 
window. setVisible (true) ; 

> 

} 



6.5 Timers, KeyEvents, and State Machines 

Not every event is generated by an action on the part of the user. Events can also be (online) 

generated by objects as part of their regular programming, and these events can be monitored 

by other objects so that they can take appropriate actions when the events occur. One example 

of this is the class javax. swing. Timer. A Timer generates events at regular intervals. These 

events can be used to drive an animation or to perform some other task at regular intervals. 

We will begin this section with a look at timer events and animation. We will then look at 

another type of basic user-generated event: the KeyEvents that are generated when the user 

types on the keyboard. The example at the end of the section uses both a timer and keyboard 

events to implement a simple game and introduces the important idea of state machines . 

6.5.1 Timers and Animation 

An object belonging to the class javax. swing. Timer exists only to generate events. A Timer, 
by default, generates a sequence of events with a fixed delay between each event and the next. 
(It is also possible to set a Timer to emit a single event after a specified time delay; in that case, 
the timer is being used as an "alarm.") Each event belongs to the class ActionEvent. An object 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



269 



that is to listen for the events must implement the interface ActionListener, which defines just 
one method: 

public void actionPerf ormed(ActionEvent evt) 

To use a Timer, you must create an object that implements the ActionListener interface. That 
is, the object must belong to a class that is declared to "implement ActionListener", and 
that class must define the actionPerf ormed method. Then, if the object is set to listen for 
events from the timer, the code in the listener's actionPerf ormed method will be executed 
every time the timer generates an event. 

Since there is no point to having a timer without having a listener to respond to its events, 
the action listener for a timer is specified as a parameter in the timer's constructor. The time 
delay between timer events is also specified in the constructor. If timer is a variable of type 
Timer, then the statement 

timer = new Timer ( millisDelay, listener ); 

creates a timer with a delay of millisDelay milliseconds between events (where 1000 mil- 
liseconds equal one second). Events from the timer are sent to the listener. (millisDelay 
must be of type int, and listener must be of type ActionListener.) Note that a timer is not 
guaranteed to deliver events at precisely regular intervals. If the computer is busy with some 
other task, an event might be delayed or even dropped altogether. 

A timer does not automatically start generating events when the timer object is created. 
The start () method in the timer must be called to tell the timer to start generating events. 
The timer's stopO method can be used to turn the stream of events off — it can be restarted 
by calling start () again. 

* * * 

One application of timers is computer animation. A computer animation is just a sequence 
of still images, presented to the user one after the other. If the time between images is short, 
and if the change from one image to another is not too great, then the user perceives continuous 
motion. The easiest way to do animation in Java is to use a Timer to drive the animation. Each 
time the timer generates an event, the next frame of the animation is computed and drawn on 
the screen — the code that implements this goes in the actionPerf ormed method of an object 
that listens for events from the timer. 

Our first example of using a timer is not exactly an animation, but it does display a new 
image for each timer event. The program shows randomly generated images that vaguely 
resemble works of abstract art. In fact, the program draws a new random image every time 
its paintComponent () method is called, and the response to a timer event is simply to call 
repaint () , which in turn triggers a call to paintComponent. The work of the program is done 
in a subclass of JPanel, which starts like this: 

import j ava . awt . * ; 
import j ava . awt . event . * ; 
import j avax . swing . * ; 

public class RandomArt Panel extends JPanel ■[ 
/** 

* A RepaintAction object calls the repaint method of this panel each 

* time its actionPerf ormedO method is called. An object of this 

* type is used as an action listener for a Timer that generates an 

* ActionEvent every four seconds. The result is that the panel is 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



270 



* redrawn every four seconds. 
*/ 

private class RepaintAction implements ActionListener -[ 
public void actionPerf ormed(ActionEvent evt) { 

repaint (); // Call the repaint () method in the panel class. 

} 

} 

/** 

* The constructor creates a timer with a delay time of four seconds 

* (4000 milliseconds), and with a RepaintAction object as its 

* ActionListener. It also starts the timer running. 
*/ 

public RandomArtPanelO { 

RepaintAction action = new RepaintActionO ; 
Timer timer = new Timer (4000, action); 
timer . start () ; 

> 

/** 

* The paintComponent () method fills the panel with a random shade of 

* gray and then draws one of three types of random "art". The type 

* of art to be drawn is chosen at random. 
*/ 

public void paintComponent (Graphics g) { 

// The rest of the class is omitted 

You can find the full source code for this class in the file RandomArtPanel.java; An application 
version of the program is RandomArt.java, while the applet version is RandomArtApplet.java. 
You can see the applet version in the on-line version of this section. 

Later in this section, we will use a timer to drive the animation in a simple computer game. 

6.5.2 Keyboard Events 

In Java, user actions become events in a program. These events are associated with GUI 
components. When the user presses a button on the mouse, the event that is generated is 
associated with the component that contains the mouse cursor. What about keyboard events? 
When the user presses a key, what component is associated with the key event that is generated? 

A GUI uses the idea of input focus to determine the component associated with keyboard 
events. At any given time, exactly one interface element on the screen has the input focus, 
and that is where all keyboard events are directed. If the interface element happens to be a 
Java component, then the information about the keyboard event becomes a Java object of type 
KeyEvent, and it is delivered to any listener objects that are listening for KeyEvents associated 
with that component. The necessity of managing input focus adds an extra twist to working 
with keyboard events. 

It's a good idea to give the user some visual feedback about which component has the input 
focus. For example, if the component is the typing area of a word-processor, the feedback is 
usually in the form of a blinking text cursor. Another common visual clue is to draw a brightly 
colored border around the edge of a component when it has the input focus, as I do in the 
examples given later in this section. 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



271 



A component that wants to have the input focus can call the method requestFocus () , 
which is defined in the Component class. Calling this method does not absolutely guarantee 
that the component will actually get the input focus. Several components might request the 
focus; only one will get it. This method should only be used in certain circumstances in any 
case, since it can be a rude surprise to the user to have the focus suddenly pulled away from 
a component that the user is working with. In a typical user interface, the user can choose to 
give the focus to a component by clicking on that component with the mouse. And pressing 
the tab key will often move the focus from one component to another. 

Some components do not automatically request the input focus when the user clicks on 
them. To solve this problem, a program has to register a mouse listener with the compo- 
nent to detect user clicks. In response to a user click, the mousePressedO method should 
call requestFocus () for the component. This is true, in particular, for the components that 
are used as drawing surfaces in the examples in this chapter. These components are defined 
as subclasses of JPanel, and JPanel objects do not receive the input focus automatically. If 
you want to be able to use the keyboard to interact with a JPanel named drawingSurf ace, 
you have to register a listener to listen for mouse events on the drawingSurf ace and call 
drawingSurf ace . requestFocus () in the mousePressedO method of the listener object. 

As our first example of processing key events, we look at a simple program in which the 
user moves a square up, down, left, and right by pressing arrow keys. When the user hits the 
'R', 'G', 'B', or 'K' key, the color of the square is set to red, green, blue, or black, respectively. 
Of course, none of these key events are delivered to the panel unless it has the input focus. 
The panel in the program changes its appearance when it has the input focus: When it does, 
a cyan-colored border is drawn around the panel; when it does not, a gray-colored border is 
drawn. Also, the panel displays a different message in each case. If the panel does not have 
the input focus, the user can give the input focus to the panel by clicking on it. The complete 
source code for this example can be found in the file Keyboard AndFocusDemo Java. I will 
discuss some aspects of it below. After reading this section, you should be able to understand 
the source code in its entirety. Here is what the program looks like in its focused state: 



Arrow Keys Move Square 
K, R, C, B Change Color 




In Java, keyboard event objects belong to a class called KeyEvent. An object that needs to 
listen for KeyEvents must implement the interface named KeyListener. Furthermore, the object 
must be registered with a component by calling the component's addKeyListener () method. 
The registration is done with the command "component . addKeyListener (listener) ;" where 
listener is the object that is to listen for key events, and component is the object that will 
generate the key events (when it has the input focus). It is possible for component and listener 
to be the same object. All this is, of course, directly analogous to what you learned about mouse 
events in the previous section. The KeyListener interface defines the following methods, which 
must be included in any class that implements KeyListener: 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



272 



public void keyPressed(KeyEvent evt) ; 
public void keyReleased(KeyEvent evt) ; 
public void keyTyped(KeyEvent evt) ; 

Java makes a careful distinction between the keys that you press and the characters that 
you type. There are lots of keys on a keyboard: letter keys, number keys, modifier keys such as 
Control and Shift, arrow keys, page up and page down keys, keypad keys, function keys, and 
so on. In many cases, pressing a key does not type a character. On the other hand, typing 
a character sometimes involves pressing several keys. For example, to type an uppercase 'A', 
you have to press the Shift key and then press the A key before releasing the Shift key. On my 
Mac OS computer, I can type an accented e, by holding down the Option key, pressing the E 
key, releasing the Option key, and pressing E again. Only one character was typed, but I had 
to perform three key-presses and I had to release a key at the right time. In Java, there are 
three types of KeyEvent. The types correspond to pressing a key, releasing a key, and typing 
a character. The keyPressed method is called when the user presses a key, the keyReleased 
method is called when the user releases a key, and the keyTyped method is called when the 
user types a character (whether that's done with one key press or several). Note that one 
user action, such as pressing the E key, can be responsible for two events, a keyPressed event 
and a keyTyped event. Typing an upper case 'A' can generate two keyPressed events, two 
keyReleased events, and one keyTyped event. 

Usually, it is better to think in terms of two separate streams of events, one consisting of 
keyPressed and keyReleased events and the other consisting of keyTyped events. For some 
applications, you want to monitor the first stream; for other applications, you want to monitor 
the second one. Of course, the information in the keyTyped stream could be extracted from 
the keyPressed/keyReleased stream, but it would be difficult (and also system-dependent 
to some extent). Some user actions, such as pressing the Shift key, can only be detected as 
keyPressed events. I used to have a computer solitaire game that highlighted every card that 
could be moved, when I held down the Shift key. You can do something like that in Java by 
hiliting the cards when the Shift key is pressed and removing the highlight when the Shift key 
is released. 

There is one more complication. Usually, when you hold down a key on the keyboard, that 
key will auto-repeat. This means that it will generate multiple keyPressed events, as long 
as it is held down. It can also generate multiple keyTyped events. For the most part, this will 
not affect your programming, but you should not expect every keyPressed event to have a 
corresponding keyReleased event. 

Every key on the keyboard has an integer code number. (Actually, this is only true 
for keys that Java knows about. Many keyboards have extra keys that can't be used with 
Java.) When the keyPressed or keyReleased method is called, the parameter, evt, contains 
the code of the key that was pressed or released. The code can be obtained by calling the 
function evt .getKeyCodeO . Rather than asking you to memorize a table of code numbers, 
Java provides a named constant for each key. These constants are defined in the KeyEvent 
class. For example the constant for the shift key is KeyEvent . VK_SHIFT. If you want to test 
whether the key that the user pressed is the Shift key, you could say "if (evt . getKeyCode () 
== KeyEvent. VK_SHTFT)". The key codes for the four arrow keys are KeyEvent . VKJLEFT, 
KeyEvent . VK.RIGHT, KeyEvent . VK_UP, and KeyEvent .VK.DOWN. Other keys have similar codes. 
(The "VK" stands for "Virtual Keyboard". In reality, different keyboards use different key 
codes, but Java translates the actual codes from the keyboard into its own "virtual" codes. 
Your program only sees these virtual key codes, so it will work with various keyboards on 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



273 



various platforms without modification.) 

In the case of a keyTyped event, you want to know which character was typed. This 
information can be obtained from the parameter, evt, in the keyTyped method by calling 
the function evt . getKeyChar () . This function returns a value of type char representing the 
character that was typed. 

In the KeyboardAndFocusDemo program, I use the keyPressed routine to respond when the 
user presses one of the arrow keys. The applet includes instance variables, squareLeft and 
squareTop, that give the position of the upper left corner of the movable square. When the 
user presses one of the arrow keys, the keyPressed routine modifies the appropriate instance 
variable and calls repaint () to redraw the panel with the square in its new position. Note 
that the values of squareLeft and squareTop are restricted so that the square never moves 
outside the white area of the panel: 

/** 

* This is called each time the user presses a key while the panel has 

* the input focus. If the key pressed was one of the arrow keys, 

* the square is moved (except that it is not allowed to move off the 

* edge of the panel, allowing for a 3-pixel border). 
*/ 

public void keyPressed (KeyEvent evt) { 

int key = evt . getKeyCode () ; // keyboard code for the pressed key 

if (key == KeyEvent .VK_LEFT) { // left-arrow key; move the square left 
squareLeft -= 8; 
if (squareLeft < 3) 

squareLeft = 3; 
repaint () ; 

} 

else if (key == KeyEvent .VK_RIGHT) { // right-arrow key; move the square right 
squareLeft += 8; 

if (squareLeft > getWidthO - 3 - SQUARE.SIZE) 

squareLeft = getWidthO - 3 - SQUARE.SIZE; 
repaint () ; 

} 

else if (key == KeyEvent .VK_UP) { // up-arrow key; move the square up 
squareTop -= 8 ; 
if (squareTop < 3) 

squareTop = 3; 
repaint () ; 

} 

else if (key == KeyEvent .VK_D0WN) { // down-arrow key; move the square down 
squareTop += 8; 

if (squareTop > getHeightO - 3 - SQUARE.SIZE) 

squareTop = getHeightO - 3 - SQUARE_SIZE; 
repaint () ; 

} 

} // end keyPressedO 

Color changes — which happen when the user types the characters 'Ft', 'G', 'B', and 'K', or 
the lower case equivalents — are handled in the keyTyped method. I won't include it here, since 
it is so similar to the keyPressed method. Finally, to complete the KeyListener interface, the 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



274 



keyReleased method must be defined. In the sample program, the body of this method is 
empty since the applet does nothing in response to keyReleased events. 

6.5.3 Focus Events 

If a component is to change its appearance when it has the input focus, it needs some way to 
know when it has the focus. In Java, objects are notified about changes of input focus by events 
of type FocusEvent. An object that wants to be notified of changes in focus can implement the 
FocusListener interface. This interface declares two methods: 

public void f ocusGained(FocusEvent evt) ; 
public void focusLost (FocusEvent evt); 

Furthermore, the addFocusListener () method must be used to set up a listener for the 
focus events. When a component gets the input focus, it calls the f ocusGainedO method of 
any object that has been registered with that component as a FocusListener. When it loses the 
focus, it calls the listener's focusLost () method. Sometimes, it is the component itself that 
listens for focus events. 

In the sample KeyboardAndFocusDemo program, the response to a focus event is simply 
to redraw the panel. The paintComponent () method checks whether the panel has the input 
focus by calling the boolean-valued function hasFocusO, which is defined in the Component 
class, and it draws a different picture depending on whether or not the panel has the input 
focus. The net result is that the appearance of the panel changes when the panel gains or loses 
focus. The methods from the FocusListener interface are defined simply as: 

public void f ocusGained(FocusEvent evt) { 

// The panel now has the input focus. 
repaintO; // will redraw with a new message and a cyan border 

} 

public void focusLost (FocusEvent evt) { 

// The panel has now lost the input focus. 
repaintO; // will redraw with a new message and a gray border 

} 

The other aspect of handling focus is to make sure that the panel gets the focus when the 
user clicks on it. To do this, the panel implements the MouseListener interface and listens for 
mouse events on itself. It defines a mousePressed routine that asks that the input focus be 
given to the panel: 

public void mousePressed (MouseEvent evt) { 
requestFocus () ; 

} 

The other four methods of the mouseListener interface are defined to be empty. Note that the 
panel implements three different listener interfaces, KeyListener, FocusListener, and MouseLis- 
tener, and the constructor in the panel class registers itself to listen for all three types of events 
with the statements: 

addKeyListener (this) ; 
addFocusListener (this) ; 
addMouseListener (this) ; 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



275 



There are, of course, other ways to organize this example. It would be possible, for example, to 
use a nested class to define the listening object. Or anonymous classes could be used to define 
separate listening objects for each type of event. In my next example, I will take the latter 
approach. 

6.5.4 State Machines 

The information stored in an object's instance variables is said to represent the state of that 
object. When one of the object's methods is called, the action taken by the object can depend 
on its state. (Or, in the terminology we have been using, the definition of the method can look 
at the instance variables to decide what to do.) Furthermore, the state can change. (That 
is, the definition of the method can assign new values to the instance variables.) In computer 
science, there is the idea of a state machine, which is just something that has a state and 
can change state in response to events or inputs. The response of a state machine to an event 
or input depends on what state it's in. An object is a kind of state machine. Sometimes, this 
point of view can be very useful in designing classes. 

The state machine point of view can be especially useful in the type of event-oriented 
programming that is required by graphical user interfaces. When designing a GUI program, 
you can ask yourself: What information about state do I need to keep track of? What events 
can change the state of the program? How will my response to a given event depend on the 
current state? Should the appearance of the GUI be changed to reflect a change in state? How 
should the paintComponent () method take the state into account? All this is an alternative to 
the top-down, step-wise-refinement style of program design, which does not apply to the overall 
design of an event-oriented program. 

In the Keyboard And FocusDemo program, shown above, the state of the program is recorded 
in the instance variables squareColor, squareLef t, and squareTop. These state variables are 
used in the paintComponent () method to decide how to draw the panel. Their values are 
changed in the two key-event-handling methods. 

In the rest of this section, we'll look at another example, where the state plays an even 
bigger role. In this example, the user plays a simple arcade-style game by pressing the arrow 
keys. The main panel of the program is defined in the source code file SubKillerPanel.java. 
An applet that uses this panel can be found in SubKillerApplet.java, while the stand-alone 
application version is SubKiller.java. You can try out the applet in the on-line version of this 
section. Here is what it looks like: 




You have to click on the panel to give it the input focus. The program shows a black 
submarine" near the bottom of the panel. While the panel has the input focus, this submarine 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



276 



moves back and forth erratically near the bottom. Near the top, there is a blue "boat." You 
can move this boat back and forth by pressing the left and right arrow keys. Attached to the 
boat is a red "bomb" (or "depth charge" ) . You can drop the bomb by hitting the down arrow 
key. The objective is to blow up the submarine by hitting it with the bomb. If the bomb falls 
off the bottom of the screen, you get a new one. If the submarine explodes, a new sub is created 
and you get a new bomb. Try it! Make sure to hit the sub at least once, so you can see the 
explosion. 

Let's think about how this game can be programmed. First of all, since we are doing object- 
oriented programming, I decided to represent the boat, the depth charge, and the submarine 
as objects. Each of these objects is defined by a separate nested class inside the main panel 
class, and each object has its own state which is represented by the instance variables in the 
corresponding class. I use variables boat, bomb, and sub in the panel class to refer to the boat, 
bomb, and submarine objects. 

Now, what constitutes the "state" of the program? That is, what things change from time 
to time and affect the appearance or behavior of the program? Of course, the state includes 
the positions of the boat, submarine, and bomb, so I need variables to store the positions. 
Anything else, possibly less obvious? Well, sometimes the bomb is falling, and sometimes it's 
not. That is a difference in state. Since there are two possibilities, I represent this aspect of the 
state with a boolean variable in the bomb object, bomb . isFalling. Sometimes the submarine is 
moving left and sometimes it is moving right. The difference is represented by another boolean 
variable, sub . isMovingLef t. Sometimes, the sub is exploding. This is also part of the state, 
and it is represented by a boolean variable, sub. isExploding. However, the explosions require 
a little more thought. An explosion is something that takes place over a series of frames. While 
an explosion is in progress, the sub looks different in each frame, as the size of the explosion 
increases. Also, I need to know when the explosion is over so that I can go back to moving and 
drawing the sub as usual. So, I use an integer variable, sub . explosionFrameNumber to record 
how many frames have been drawn since the explosion started; the value of this variable is used 
only when an explosion is in progress. 

How and when do the values of these state variables change? Some of them seem to change 
on their own: For example, as the sub moves left and right, the state variables that specify 
its position change. Of course, these variables are changing because of an animation, and that 
animation is driven by a timer. Each time an event is generated by the timer, some of the state 
variables have to change to get ready for the next frame of the animation. The changes are 
made by the action listener that listens for events from the timer. The boat, bomb, and sub 
objects each contain an updateForNextFrame () method that updates the state variables of the 
object to get ready for the next frame of the animation. The action listener for the timer calls 
these methods with the statements 

boat . updateForNewFrame ( ) ; 
bomb . updateForNewFrame ( ) ; 
sub.updateForNewFrameO ; 

The action listener also calls repaint ( ) , so that the panel will be redrawn to reflect its new 
state. There are several state variables that change in these update methods, in addition to 
the position of the sub: If the bomb is falling, then its y-coordinate increases from one frame 
to the next. If the bomb hits the sub, then the isExploding variable of the sub changes to 
true, and the isFalling variable of the bomb becomes false. The isFalling variable also 
becomes false when the bomb falls off the bottom of the screen. If the sub is exploding, then 
its explosionFrameNumber increases from one frame to the next, and when it reaches a certain 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



277 



value, the explosion ends and isExploding is reset to false. At random times, the sub switches 
between moving to the left and moving to the right. Its direction of motion is recorded in the 
sub's isMovingLeft variable. The sub's updateForNewFrame () method includes the lines 

if ( Math.randomO < 0.04 ) 

isMovingLeft = ! isMovingLeft; 

There is a 1 in 25 chance that Math.randomO will be less than 0.04, so the statement 
"isMovingLeft = ! isMovingLeft" is executed in one in every twenty-five frames, on av- 
erage. The effect of this statement is to reverse the value of isMovingLeft, from false to true 
or from true to false. That is, the direction of motion of the sub is reversed. 

In addition to changes in state that take place from one frame to the next, a few state 
variables change when the user presses certain keys. In the program, this is checked in a 
method that responds to user keystrokes. If the user presses the left or right arrow key, the 
position of the boat is changed. If the user presses the down arrow key, the bomb changes 
from not-falling to falling. This is coded in the keyPressedO method of a KeyListener that is 
registered to listen for key events on the panel; that method reads as follows: 

public void keyPressed(KeyEvent evt) { 

int code = evt .getKeyCodeO ; // which key was pressed, 
if (code == KeyEvent . VK_LEFT) { 

// Move the boat left. (If this moves the boat out of the frame, its 
// position will be adjusted in the boat . updateForNewFrame () method.) 
boat . centerX -= 15; 

> 

else if (code == KeyEvent .VKJUGHT) { 

// Move the boat right. (If this moves boat out of the frame, its 
// position will be adjusted in the boat . updateForNewFrame () method.) 
boat.centerX += 15; 

} 

else if (code == KeyEvent .VKJDOWN) { 

// Start the bomb falling, if it is not already falling, 
if ( bomb. isFalling == false ) 
bomb . isFalling = true; 

} 

} 

Note that it's not necessary to call repaint () when the state changes, since this panel shows 
an animation that is constantly being redrawn anyway. Any changes in the state will become 
visible to the user as soon as the next frame is drawn. At some point in the program, I have 
to make sure that the user does not move the boat off the screen. I could have done this in 
keyPressedO , but I choose to check for this in another routine, in the boat object. 

I encourage you to read the source code in SubKillerPanel.java. Although a few points are 
tricky, you should with some effort be able to read and understand the entire program. Try to 
understand the program in terms of state machines. Note how the state of each of the three 
objects in the program changes in response to events from the timer and from the user. 

You should also note that the program uses four listeners, to respond to action events from 
the timer, key events from the user, focus events, and mouse events. (The mouse is used only to 
request the input focus when the user clicks the panel.) The timer runs only when the panel has 
the input focus; this is programmed by having the focus listener start the timer when the panel 
gains the input focus and stop the timer when the panel loses the input focus. All four listeners 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



278 



are created in the constructor of the SubKillerPanel class using anonymous inner classes. (See 
Subsection 6.4.5.) 

While it's not at all sophisticated as arcade games go, the SubKiller game does use some 
interesting programming. And it nicely illustrates how to apply state-machine thinking in 
event-oriented programming. 

6.6 Basic Components 

In PRECEDING SECTIONS, you've seen how to use a graphics context to draw on the screen (online) 
and how to handle mouse events and keyboard events. In one sense, that's all there is to 
GUI programming. If you're willing to program all the drawing and handle all the mouse and 
keyboard events, you have nothing more to learn. However, you would either be doing a lot 
more work than you need to do, or you would be limiting yourself to very simple user interfaces. 
A typical user interface uses standard GUI components such as buttons, scroll bars, text-input 
boxes, and menus. These components have already been written for you, so you don't have to 
duplicate the work involved in developing them. They know how to draw themselves, and they 
can handle the details of processing the mouse and keyboard events that concern them. 

Consider one of the simplest user interface components, a push button. The button has a 
border, and it displays some text. This text can be changed. Sometimes the button is disabled, 
so that clicking on it doesn't have any effect. When it is disabled, its appearance changes. When 
the user clicks on the push button, the button changes appearance while the mouse button is 
pressed and changes back when the mouse button is released. In fact, it's more complicated 
than that. If the user moves the mouse outside the push button before releasing the mouse 
button, the button changes to its regular appearance. To implement this, it is necessary to 
respond to mouse exit or mouse drag events. Furthermore, on many platforms, a button can 
receive the input focus. The button changes appearance when it has the focus. If the button 
has the focus and the user presses the space bar, the button is triggered. This means that the 
button must respond to keyboard and focus events as well. 

Fortunately, you don't have to program any of this, provided you use an object belonging 
to the standard class javax. swing. JButton. A JButton object draws itself and processes 
mouse, keyboard, and focus events on its own. You only hear from the JButton when the 
user triggers it by clicking on it or pressing the space bar while the button has the input 
focus. When this happens, the JButton object creates an event object belonging to the class 
java. awt . event . ActionEvent. The event object is sent to any registered listeners to tell them 
that the button has been pushed. Your program gets only the information it needs — the fact 
that a button was pushed. 

* * * 

The standard components that are defined as part of the Swing graphical user interface 
API are defined by subclasses of the class JComponent, which is itself a subclass of Component. 
(Note that this includes the J Panel class that we have already been working with extensively.) 
Many useful methods are defined in the Component and JComponent classes and so can be used 
with any Swing component. We begin by looking at a few of these methods. Suppose that comp 
is a variable that refers to some JComponent. Then the following methods can be used: 

• comp.getWidthQ and comp . getHeight () are functions that give the current size of the 
component, in pixels. One warning: When a component is first created, its size is zero. 
The size will be set later, probably by a layout manager. A common mistake is to check 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



279 



the size of a component before that size has been set, such as in a constructor. 

• comp . setEnabled(true) and comp . setEnabled(f alse) can be used to enable and disable 
the component. When a component is disabled, its appearance might change, and the user 
cannot do anything with it. There is a boolean- valued function, comp . isEnabledO that 
you can call to discover whether the component is enabled. 

• comp. setVisible (true) and comp. setVisible (false) can be called to hide or show the 
component. 

• comp . setFont (font) sets the font that is used for text displayed on the component. See 
Subsection 6.3.3 for a discussion of fonts. 

• comp . setBackground (color) and comp . setForeground( color) set the background and 
foreground colors for the component. See Subsection 6.3.2. 

• comp. setOpaque (true) tells the component that the area occupied by the component 
should be filled with the component's background color before the content of the com- 
ponent is painted. By default, only JLabels are non-opaque. A non-opaque, or "trans- 
parent", component ignores its background color and simply paints its content over the 
content of its container. This usually means that it inherits the background color from its 
container. 

• comp . setToolTipText (string) sets the specified string as a "tool tip" for the component. 
The tool tip is displayed if the mouse cursor is in the component and the mouse is not 
moved for a few seconds. The tool tip should give some information about the meaning 
of the component or how to use it. 

• comp . setPref erredSize (size) sets the size at which the component should be displayed, 
if possible. The parameter is of type java. awt . Dimension, where an object of type Di- 
mension has two public integer- valued instance variables, width and height. A call to this 
method usually looks something like "setPref erredSize ( new Dimension(100,50) )". 
The preferred size is used as a hint by layout managers, but will not be respected in all 
cases. Standard components generally compute a correct preferred size automatically, but 
it can be useful to set it in some cases. For example, if you use a JPanel as a drawing 
surface, it is usually a good idea to set a preferred size for it. 

Note that using any component is a multi-step process. The component object must be 
created with a constructor. It must be added to a container. In many cases, a listener must 
be registered to respond to events from the component. And in some cases, a reference to the 
component must be saved in an instance variable so that the component can be manipulated by 
the program after it has been created. In this section, we will look at a few of the basic standard 
components that are available in Swing. In the next section we will consider the problem of 
laying out components in containers. 

6.6.1 JButton 

An object of class JButton is a push button that the user can click to trigger some action. You've 
already seen buttons used in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2, but we consider them in much more 
detail here. To use any component effectively, there are several aspects of the corresponding 
class that you should be familiar with. For JButton, as an example, I list these aspects explicitly: 

• Constructors: The JButton class has a constructor that takes a string as a parameter. 
This string becomes the text displayed on the button. For example: stopGoButton = 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



280 



new JButton("Go") . This creates a button object that will display the text, "Go" (but 
remember that the button must still be added to a container before it can appear on the 
screen) . 

• Events: When the user clicks on a button, the button generates an event of type Action- 
Event. This event is sent to any listener that has been registered with the button as an 
Action Listener. 

• Listeners: An object that wants to handle events generated by buttons must imple- 
ment the ActionListener interface. This interface defines just one method, "public void 
actionPerf ormed(ActionEvent evt)", which is called to notify the object of an action 
event. 

• Registration of Listeners: In order to actually receive notification of an event from a 
button, an ActionListener must be registered with the button. This is done with the but- 
ton's addActionListener () method. For example: stopGoButton. addActionListener ( 
buttonHandler ) ; 

• Event methods: When actionPerf ormed(evt) is called by the button, the parameter, 
evt, contains information about the event. This information can be retrieved by calling 
methods in the ActionEvent class. In particular, evt . getActionCommandO returns a 
String giving the command associated with the button. By default, this command is the 
text that is displayed on the button, but it is possible to set it to some other string. The 
method evt.getSourceO returns a reference to the Object that produced the event, 
that is, to the JButton that was pressed. The return value is of type Object, not JButton, 
because other types of components can also produce ActionEvents. 

• Component methods: Several useful methods are defined in the JButton class. For 
example, stopGoButton. setText ("Stop") changes the text displayed on the button to 
"Stop". And stopGoButton. setActionCommand("sgb") changes the action command 
associated with this button for action events. 

Of course, JButtons also have all the general Component methods, such as setEnabledO 
and setFont () . The setEnabledO and setText () methods of a button are particularly useful 
for giving the user information about what is going on in the program. A disabled button is 
better than a button that gives an obnoxious error message such as "Sorry, you can't click on 
me now!" 

6.6.2 JLabel 

JLabel is certainly the simplest type of component. An object of type JLabel exists just to 
display a line of text. The text cannot be edited by the user, although it can be changed by 
your program. The constructor for a JLabel specifies the text to be displayed: 

JLabel message = new JLabel ( "Hello World!"); 

There is another constructor that specifies where in the label the text is located, if there is 
extra space. The possible alignments are given by the constants JLabel . LEFT, JLabel . CENTER, 
and JLabel. RIGHT. For example, 

JLabel message = new JLabel ("Hello World!", JLabel . CENTER) ; 

creates a label whose text is centered in the available space. You can change the text displayed 
in a label by calling the label's setText () method: 

message . setText ("Goodbye World ! ") ; 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



281 



Since the JLabel class is a subclass of JComponent, you can use methods such as 
setForegroundO and setFontQ with labels. If you want the background color to have any 
effect, you should call setOpaque (true) on the label, since otherwise the JLabel might not fill 
in its background. For example: 

JLabel message = new JLabel ( "Hello World!", JLabel . CENTER) ; 
message. setForeground (Color. RED) ; // Display red text... 
message . setBackground (Color .BLACK) ; // on a black background... 
message . setFont (new Font ("Serif ", Font .BOLD, 18) ) ; // in a big bold font, 
message . setOpaque (true) ; // Make sure background is filled in. 

6.6.3 JCheckBox 

A JCheckBox is a component that has two states: selected or unselected. The user can change 
the state of a check box by clicking on it. The state of a checkbox is represented by a boolean 
value that is true if the box is selected and is false if the box is unselected. A checkbox has 
a label, which is specified when the box is constructed: 

JCheckBox showTime = new JCheckBox ("Show Current Time"); 

Usually, it's the user who sets the state of a JCheckBox, but you can also set the state 
in your program. The current state of a checkbox is set using its setSelected (boolean) 
method. For example, if you want the checkbox showTime to be checked, you would say 
"showTime . setSelected(true) ". To uncheck the box, say "showTime . setSelected(f alse) ". 
You can determine the current state of a checkbox by calling its isSelectedO method, which 
returns a boolean value. 

In many cases, you don't need to worry about events from checkboxes. Your program can 
just check the state whenever it needs to know it by calling the isSelectedO method. However, 
a checkbox does generate an event when its state is changed by the user, and you can detect this 
event and respond to it if you want something to happen at the moment the state changes. When 
the state of a checkbox is changed by the user, it generates an event of type ActionEvent. If you 
want something to happen when the user changes the state, you must register an ActionListener 
with the checkbox by calling its addActionListener () method. (Note that if you change 
the state by calling the setSelected () method, no ActionEvent is generated. However, there 
is another method in the JCheckBox class, doClickO, which simulates a user click on the 
checkbox and does generate an ActionEvent.) 

When handling an ActionEvent, you can call evt . getSource () in the actionPerf ormed() 
method to find out which object generated the event. (Of course, if you are only listening for 
events from one component, you don't have to do this.) The returned value is of type Object, 
but you can type-cast it to another type if you want. Once you know the object that generated 
the event, you can ask the object to tell you its current state. For example, if you know that 
the event had to come from one of two checkboxes, cbl or cb2, then your actionPerf ormed() 
method might look like this: 

public void actionPerf ormed(ActionEvent evt) { 
Object source = evt .getSource () ; 
if (source == cbl) { 

boolean newState = cbl . isSelectedO ; 
... // respond to the change of state 

} 

else if (source == cb2) { 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



282 



boolean newState = cb2 . isSelectedO ; 
... // respond to the change of state 

} 

> 

Alternatively, you can use evt . getActionCommandO to retrieve the action command asso- 
ciated with the source. For a JCheckBox, the action command is, by default, the label of the 
checkbox. 

6.6.4 JTextField and JTextArea 

The JTextField and JTextArea classes represent components that contain text that can be edited 
by the user. A JTextField holds a single line of text, while a JTextArea can hold multiple lines. 
It is also possible to set a JTextField or JTextArea to be read-only so that the user can read the 
text that it contains but cannot edit the text. Both classes are subclasses of an abstract class, 
JTextComponent, which defines their common properties. 

JTextField and JTextArea have many methods in common. The instance method setText () , 
which takes a parameter of type String, can be used to change the text that is displayed in an 
input component. The contents of the component can be retrieved by calling its getTextO 
instance method, which returns a value of type String. If you want to stop the user from 
modifying the text, you can call setEditable (false) . Call the same method with a parameter 
of true to make the input component user-editable again. 

The user can only type into a text component when it has the input focus. The user can 
give the input focus to a text component by clicking it with the mouse, but sometimes it is 
useful to give the input focus to a text field programmatically. You can do this by calling its 
requestFocus () method. For example, when I discover an error in the user's input, I usually 
call requestFocus () on the text field that contains the error. This helps the user see where 
the error occurred and lets the user start typing the correction immediately. 

By default, there is no space between the text in a text component and the edge of the 
component, which usually doesn't look very good. You can use the setMarginQ method of 
the component to add some blank space between the edge of the component and the text. 
This method takes a parameter of type java. awt . Insets which contains four integer instance 
variables that specify the margins on the top, left, bottom, and right edge of the component. 
For example, 

textComponent . setMargin( new Insets (5, 5, 5, 5) ); 

adds a five-pixel margin between the text in textComponent and each edge of the component. 

* * * 

The JTextField class has a constructor 
public JTextField(int columns) 

where columns is an integer that specifies the number of characters that should be visible in the 
text field. This is used to determine the preferred width of the text field. (Because characters 
can be of different sizes and because the preferred width is not always respected, the actual 
number of characters visible in the text field might not be equal to columns.) You don't have to 
specify the number of columns; for example, you might use the text field in a context where it 
will expand to fill whatever space is available. In that case, you can use the default constructor 
JTextFieldO , with no parameters. You can also use the following constructors, which specify 
the initial contents of the text field: 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



283 



public JTextField (String contents) ; 

public JTextField (String contents, int columns); 

The constructors for a JTextArea are 
public JTextAreaO 

public JTextArea(int rows, int columns) 
public JTextArea(String contents) 

public JTextArea(String contents, int rows, int columns) 

The parameter rows specifies how many lines of text should be visible in the text area. This 
determines the preferred height of the text area, just as columns determines the preferred width. 
However, the text area can actually contain any number of lines; the text area can be scrolled 
to reveal lines that are not currently visible. It is common to use a JTextArea as the CENTER 
component of a BorderLayout. In that case, it is less useful to specify the number of lines and 
columns, since the Text Area will expand to fill all the space available in the center area of the 
container. 

The JTextArea class adds a few useful methods to those inherited from JTextComponent. 
For example, the instance method append (moreText ) , where moreText is of type String, adds 
the specified text at the end of the current content of the text area. (When using append () 
or setTextO to add text to a JTextArea, line breaks can be inserted in the text by using the 
newline character, J \n'.) And setLineWrap(wrap) , where wrap is of type boolean, tells what 
should happen when a line of text is too long to be displayed in the text area. If wrap is true, 
then any line that is too long will be "wrapped" onto the next line; if wrap is false, the line will 
simply extend outside the text area, and the user will have to scroll the text area horizontally 
to see the entire line. The default value of wrap is false. 

Since it might be necessary to scroll a text area to see all the text that it contains, you might 
expect a text area to come with scroll bars. Unfortunately, this does not happen automatically. 
To get scroll bars for a text area, you have to put the JTextArea inside another component, 
called a JScrollPane. This can be done as follows: 

JTextArea input Area = new JTextAreaO ; 

JScrollPane scroller = new JScrollPane ( inputArea ); 

The scroll pane provides scroll bars that can be used to scroll the text in the text area. The 
scroll bars will appear only when needed, that is when the size of the text exceeds the size of the 
text area. Note that when you want to put the text area into a container, you should add the 
scroll pane, not the text area itself, to the container. See the short example Text AreaDemo Java 
for an example of using a text area. 

* * * 

When the user is typing in a JTextField and presses return, an ActionEvent is generated. 
If you want to respond to such events, you can register an ActionListener with the text field, 
using the text field's addActionListener () method. (Since a JTextArea can contain multiple 
lines of text, pressing return in a text area does not generate an event; it simply begins a new 
line of text.) 

JTextField has a subclass, J Password Field, which is identical except that it does not reveal 
the text that it contains. The characters in a JPasswordField are all displayed as asterisks (or 
some other fixed character). A password field is, obviously, designed to let the user enter a 
password without showing that password on the screen. 

Text components are actually quite complex, and I have covered only their most basic 
properties here. I will return to the topic of text components in Subsection 13.4.4. 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



284 



6.6.5 JComboBox 

The JComboBox class provides a way to let the user select one option from a list of options. 
The options are presented as a kind of pop-up menu, and only the currently selected option is 
visible on the screen. 

When a JComboBox object is first constructed, it initially contains no items. An item 
is added to the bottom of the list of options by calling the combo box's instance method, 
addltem(str) , where str is the string that will be displayed in the menu. 

For example, the following code will create an object of type JComboBox that contains the 
options Red, Blue, Green, and Black: 

JComboBox colorChoice = new JComboBoxO ; 
colorChoice.addltemC'Red") ; 
colorChoice . addltemC'Blue") ; 
colorChoice . addltem( "Green") ; 
colorChoice . addltem( "Black") ; 

You can call the getSelectedlndexO method of a JComboBox to find out which item 
is currently selected. This method returns an integer that gives the position of the selected 
item in the list, where the items are numbered starting from zero. Alternatively, you can call 
getSelectedltemQ to get the selected item itself. (This method returns a value of type Object, 
since a JComboBox can actually hold other types of objects besides strings.) You can change 
the selection by calling the method setSelectedlndex(n), where n is an integer giving the 
position of the item that you want to select. 

The most common way to use a JComboBox is to call its getSelectedlndexO method when 
you have a need to know which item is currently selected. However, like other components that 
we have seen, JComboBox components generate ActionEvents when the user selects an item. 
You can register an ActionListener with the JComboBox if you want to respond to such events 
as they occur. 

JComboBoxes have a nifty feature, which is probably not all that useful in practice. You can 
make a JComboBox "editable" by calling its method setEditable (true) . If you do this, the 
user can edit the selection by clicking on the JComboBox and typing. This allows the user to 
make a selection that is not in the pre-configured list that you provide. (The "Combo" in the 
name "JComboBox" refers to the fact that it's a kind of combination of menu and text-input 
box.) If the user has edited the selection in this way, then the getSelectedlndexO method 
will return the value -1, and getSelectedltemO will return the string that the user typed. 
An ActionEvent is triggered if the user presses return while typing in the JComboBox. 



6.6.6 JSlider 

A JSlider provides a way for the user to select an integer value from a range of possible values. 
The user does this by dragging a "knob" along a bar. A slider can, optionally, be decorated 
with tick marks and with labels. This picture shows three sliders with different decorations and 
with different ranges of values: 



2000 



2050 



2100 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



285 



Here, the second slider is decorated with ticks, and the third one is decorated with labels. It's 
possible for a single slider to have both types of decorations. 

The most commonly used constructor for JSliders specifies the start and end of the range 
of values for the slider and its initial value when it first appears on the screen: 

public JSlider (int minimum, int maximum, int value) 

If the parameters are omitted, the values 0, 100, and 50 are used. By default, a slider is horizon- 
tal, but you can make it vertical by calling its method setOrientation( JSlider . VERTICAL) . 
The current value of a JSlider can be read at any time with its get Value () method, which 
returns a value of type int. If you want to change the value, you can do so with the method 
setValue(n), which takes a parameter of type int. 

If you want to respond immediately when the user changes the value of a slider, you can 
register a listener with the slider. JSliders, unlike other components we have seen, do not 
generate ActionEvents. Instead, they generate events of type ChangeEvent. ChangeEvent and 
related classes are defined in the package j avax . swing . event rather than j ava . awt . event , so 
if you want to use ChangeEvents, you should import j avax . swing . event . * at the beginning 
of your program. You must also define some object to implement the ChangeListener interface, 
and you must register the change listener with the slider by calling its addChangeListener () 
method. A ChangeListener must provide a definition for the method: 

public void stateChanged (ChangeEvent evt) 

This method will be called whenever the value of the slider changes. Note that it will also 
be called when you change the value with the setValueQ method, as well as when the user 
changes the value. In the stateChanged () method, you can call evt . getSource () to find 
out which object generated the event. If you want to know whether the user generated the 
change event, call the slider's getValuelsAdjustingO method, which returns true if the user 
is dragging the knob on the slider. 

Using tick marks on a slider is a two-step process: Specify the interval between the tick 
marks, and tell the slider that the tick marks should be displayed. There are actually two 
types of tick marks, "major" tick marks and "minor" tick marks. You can have one or 
the other or both. Major tick marks are a bit longer than minor tick marks. The method 
setMinorTickSpacing(i) indicates that there should be a minor tick mark every i units along 
the slider. The parameter is an integer. (The spacing is in terms of values on the slider, not 
pixels.) For the major tick marks, there is a similar command, setMajorTickSpacing(i) . 
Calling these methods is not enough to make the tick marks appear. You also have to call 
setPaintTicks (true) . For example, the second slider in the above picture was created and 
configured using the commands: 

slider2 = new JSliderO; // (Uses default min, max, and value.) 
slider2 . addChangeListener (this) ; 
slider2 . setMaj orTickSpacing (25) ; 
slider2 . setMinorTickSpacing(5) ; 
slider2 . setPaintTicks (true) ; 

Labels on a slider are handled similarly. You have to specify the labels and tell the slider to 
paint them. Specifying labels is a tricky business, but the JSlider class has a method to simplify 
it. You can create a set of labels and add them to a slider named sldr with the command: 

sldr.setLabelTable( sldr . createStandardLabels (i) ); 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



286 



where i is an integer giving the spacing between the labels. To arrange for the labels to be 
displayed, call setPaintLabels (true) . For example, the third slider in the above picture was 
created and configured with the commands: 

slider3 = new JSlider (2000, 2100, 2006) ; 
slider3 . addChangeListener (this) ; 

slider3 . setLabelTable ( slider3 . createStandardLabels (50) ); 
slider3 . setPaintLabels (true) ; 



6.7 Basic Layout 

Components are the fundamental building blocks of a graphical user interface. But you have (online) 

to do more with components besides create them. Another aspect of GUI programming is 

laying out components on the screen, that is, deciding where they are drawn and how big 

they are. You have probably noticed that computing coordinates can be a difficult problem, 

especially if you don't assume a fixed size for the drawing area. Java has a solution for this, as 

well. 

Components are the visible objects that make up a GUI. Some components are containers, 
which can hold other components. Containers in Java are objects that belong to some subclass 
of java. awt . Container. The content pane of a J Applet or JFrame is an example of a container. 
The standard class JPanel, which we have mostly used as a drawing surface up until now, is 
another example of a container. 

Because a JPanel object is a container, it can hold other components. Because a JPanel is 
itself a component, you can add a JPanel to another JPanel. This makes complex nesting of 
components possible. JPanels can be used to organize complicated user interfaces, as shown in 
this illustration: 




Three panels, shown in color, 
containing six other components, 
shown in gray. 



The components in a container must be "laid out," which means setting their sizes and 
positions. It's possible to program the layout yourself, but layout is ordinarily done by a 
layout manager. A layout manager is an object associated with a container that implements 
some policy for laying out the components in that container. Different types of layout manager 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



287 



implement different policies. In this section, we will cover the three most common types of 
layout manager, and then we will look at several programming examples that use components 
and layout. 

Every container has a default layout manager and has an instance method, setLayout () , 
that takes a parameter of type LayoutManager and that is used to specify a different layout 
manager for the container. Components are added to a container by calling an instance method 
named add() in the container object. There are actually several versions of the add() method, 
with different parameter lists. Different versions of add() are appropriate for different layout 
managers, as we will see below. 

6.7.1 Basic Layout Managers 

Java has a variety of standard layout managers that can be used as parameters in the 
setLayout () method. They are defined by classes in the package java.awt. Here, we will 
look at just three of these layout manager classes: FlowLayout, BorderLayout, and GridLayout. 

A FlowLayout simply lines up components in a row across the container. The size of each 
component is equal to that component's "preferred size." After laying out as many items as will 
fit in a row across the container, the layout manager will move on to the next row. The default 
layout for a JPanel is a FlowLayout; that is, a JPanel uses a FlowLayout unless you specify a 
different layout manager by calling the panel's setLayout () method. 

The components in a given row can be either left-aligned, right-aligned, or centered within 
that row, and there can be horizontal and vertical gaps between components. If the default 
constructor, "new FlowLayout ()", is used, then the components on each row will be centered 
and both the horizontal and the vertical gaps will be five pixels. The constructor 

public FlowLayout (int align, int hgap, int vgap) 

can be used to specify alternative alignment and gaps. The possible values of align are 
FlowLayout . LEFT, FlowLayout .RIGHT, and FlowLayout . CENTER. 

Suppose that cntr is a container object that is using a FlowLayout as its layout manager. 
Then, a component, comp, can be added to the container with the statement 

cntr . add (comp) ; 

The FlowLayout will line up all the components that have been added to the container in this 
way. They will be lined up in the order in which they were added. For example, this picture 
shows five buttons in a panel that uses a FlowLayout: 



1 Button Number 1 j ^ Button Number 2 ) ( Button Number 3 1 
( Button Number 4~ | ( Button Number 5 ) 



Note that since the five buttons will not fit in a single row across the panel, they are arranged 
in two rows. In each row, the buttons are grouped together and are centered in the row. The 
buttons were added to the panel using the statements: 

panel . add(buttonl) ; 
panel . add(button2) ; 
panel . add(button3) ; 
panel . add (button4) ; 
panel . add(button5) ; 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



288 



When a container uses a layout manager, the layout manager is ordinarily responsible for 
computing the preferred size of the container (although a different preferred size could be 
set by calling the container's setPref erredSize method). A Flow/Layout prefers to put its 
components in a single row, so the preferred width is the total of the preferred widths of all 
the components, plus the horizontal gaps between the components. The preferred height is the 
maximum preferred height of all the components. 

* * * 

A BorderLayout layout manager is designed to display one large, central component, with up 
to four smaller components arranged along the edges of the central component. If a container, 
cntr, is using a BorderLayout, then a component, comp, should be added to the container using 
a statement of the form 

cntr.add( comp, borderLayoutPosition ); 

where borderLayoutPosition specifies what position the component should occupy in the 
layout and is given as one of the constants BorderLayout . CENTER, BorderLayout . NORTH, 
BorderLayout . SOUTH, BorderLayout . EAST, or BorderLayout . WEST. The meaning of the five 
positions is shown in this diagram: 



North 



Center 



South 



Note that a border layout can contain fewer than five components, so that not all five of the 
possible positions need to be filled. It would be very unusual, however, to have no center 
component. 

A BorderLayout selects the sizes of its components as follows: The NORTH and SOUTH com- 
ponents (if present) are shown at their preferred heights, but their width is set equal to the full 
width of the container. The EAST and WEST components are shown at their preferred widths, 
but their height is set to the height of the container, minus the space occupied by the NORTH 
and SOUTH components. Finally, the CENTER component takes up any remaining space. The 
preferred size of the CENTER component is ignored when the layout is done, but it is taken 
into account when the preferred size of the container is computed. You should make sure that 
the components that you put into a BorderLayout are suitable for the positions that they will 
occupy. A horizontal slider or text field, for example, would work well in the NORTH or SOUTH 
position, but wouldn't make much sense in the EAST or WEST position. 

The default constructor, new BorderLayout () , leaves no space between components. If you 
would like to leave some space, you can specify horizontal and vertical gaps in the constructor 
of the BorderLayout object. For example, if you say 

panel . setLayout (new BorderLayout (5,7)) ; 

then the layout manager will insert horizontal gaps of 5 pixels between components and vertical 
gaps of 7 pixels between components. The background color of the container will show through 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



289 



in these gaps. The default layout for the original content pane that comes with a JFrame or 
JApplet is a BorderLayout with no horizontal or vertical gap. 

* * * 

Finally, we consider the GridLayout layout manager. A grid layout lays out components in 
a grid containing rows and columns of equal sized rectangles. This illustration shows how the 
components would be arranged in a grid layout with 3 rows and 2 columns: 



#1 


#2 


#3 


#4 


#5 


#6 



If a container uses a GridLayout, the appropriate add method for the container takes a single 
parameter of type Component (for example: cntr . add(comp) ). Components are added to the 
grid in the order shown; that is, each row is filled from left to right before going on the next 
row. 

The constructor for a GridLayout takes the form "new GridLayout (R,C)", where R is the 
number of rows and C is the number of columns. If you want to leave horizontal gaps of H pixels 
between columns and vertical gaps of V pixels between rows, use "new GridLayout(R,C,H,V)" 
instead. 

When you use a GridLayout, it's probably good form to add just enough components to fill 
the grid. However, this is not required. In fact, as long as you specify a non-zero value for the 
number of rows, then the number of columns is essentially ignored. The system will use just as 
many columns as are necessary to hold all the components that you add to the container. If you 
want to depend on this behavior, you should probably specify zero as the number of columns. 
You can also specify the number of rows as zero. In that case, you must give a non-zero number 
of columns. The system will use the specified number of columns, with just as many rows as 
necessary to hold the components that are added to the container. 

Horizontal grids, with a single row, and vertical grids, with a single column, are very com- 
mon. For example, suppose that buttonl, button2, and button3 are buttons and that you'd 
like to display them in a horizontal row in a panel. If you use a horizontal grid for the panel, 
then the buttons will completely fill that panel and will all be the same size. The panel can be 
created as follows: 

JPanel buttonBar = new JPanelO; 

buttonBar . setLayout ( new GridLayout (1,3) ); 

// (Note: The "3" here is pretty much ignored, and 

// you could also say "new GridLayout ( 1, 0) " . 

// To leave gaps between the buttons, you could use 

// "new GridLayout(l,0,5,5)".) 
buttonBar . add (buttonl) ; 
buttonBar . add (button2) ; 
buttonBar . add (button3) ; 

You might find this button bar to be more attractive than the one that uses the default FlowLay- 
out layout manager. 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



290 



6.7.2 Borders 

We have seen how to leave gaps between the components in a container, but what if you would 
like to leave a border around the outside of the container? This problem is not handled by 
layout managers. Instead, borders in Swing are represented by objects. A Border object can be 
added to any JComponent, not just to containers. Borders can be more than just empty space. 
The class javax. swing. BorderFactory contains a large number of static methods for creating 
border objects. For example, the function 

BorderFactory . createLineBorder (Color . BLACK) 

returns an object that represents a one-pixel wide black line around the outside of a component. 
If comp is a JComponent, a border can be added to comp using its setBorder () method. For 
example: 

comp. setBorder ( BorderFactory. createLineBorder (Color .BLACK) ); 

Once a border has been set for a JComponent, the border is drawn automatically, without 
any further effort on the part of the programmer. The border is drawn along the edges of the 
component, just inside its boundary. The layout manager of a JPanel or other container will 
take the space occupied by the border into account. The components that are added to the 
container will be displayed in the area inside the border. I don't recommend using a border on 
a JPanel that is being used as a drawing surface. However, if you do this, you should take the 
border into account. If you draw in the area occupied by the border, that part of your drawing 
will be covered by the border. 

Here are some of the static methods that can be used to create borders: 

• BorderFactory . createEmptyBorder (top, left , bottom, right) — leaves an empty bor- 
der around the edges of a component. Nothing is drawn in this space, so the background 
color of the component will appear in the area occupied by the border. The parameters 
are integers that give the width of the border along the top, left, bottom, and right edges 
of the component. This is actually very useful when used on a JPanel that contains other 
components. It puts some space between the components and the edge of the panel. It 
can also be useful on a JLabel, which otherwise would not have any space between the 
text and the edge of the label. 

• BorderFactory . createLineBorder (color, thickness) — draws a line around all four 
edges of a component. The first parameter is of type Color and specifies the color of the 
line. The second parameter is an integer that specifies the thickness of the border, in 
pixels. If the second parameter is omitted, a line of thickness 1 is drawn. 

• BorderFactory . createMatteBorder (top, left .bottom, right , color) -- is similar to 
createLineBorder, except that you can specify individual thicknesses for the top, left, 
bottom, and right edges of the component. 

• BorderFactory . createEtchedBorder () - - creates a border that looks like a groove 
etched around the boundary of the component. The effect is achieved using lighter and 
darker shades of the component's background color, and it does not work well with every 
background color. 

• BorderFactory . createLoweredBevelBorder () — gives a component a three-dimensional 
effect that makes it look like it is lowered into the computer screen. As with an Etched- 
Border, this only works well for certain background colors. 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



291 



• BorderFactory . createRaisedBevelBorder () — similar to a LoweredBevelBorder, but 
the component looks like it is raised above the computer screen. 

• BorderFactory. createTitledBorder (title) — creates a border with a title. The title is 
a String, which is displayed in the upper left corner of the border. 

There are many other methods in the BorderFactory class, most of them providing vari- 
ations of the basic border styles given here. The following illustration shows six components 
with six different border styles. The text in each component is the command that created the 
border for that component: 



BorderFaaory.creareLirieBorder(Color.R.ED,2) 



BorderFactory.createMatteBorder(2,2,5,5,Color.RED) 




(The source code for the applet that produced this picture can be found in BorderDemo.java.) 



6.7.3 SliderAndComboBoxDemo 

Now that we have looked at components and layouts, it's time to put them together into some 
complete programs. We start with a simple demo that uses a JLabel, a JComboBox, and a 
couple of JSIiders, all laid out in a GridLayout, as shown in this picture: 



Hello World! 



-TV 



Bold Font 



The sliders in this applet control the foreground and background color of the label, and the 
combo box controls its font style. Writing this program is a matter of creating the components, 
laying them out, and programming listeners to respond to events from the sliders and combo 
box. In my program, I define a subclass of JPanel which will be used for the applet's content 
pane. This class implements ChangeListener and ActionListener, so the panel itself can act as 
the listener for change events from the sliders and action events from the combo box. In the 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



292 



constructor, the four components are created and configured, a GridLayout is installed as the 
layout manager for the panel, and the components are added to the panel: 

/* Create the sliders, and set up this panel to listen for 
ChangeEvents that are generated by the sliders. */ 

bgColorSlider = new JSlider (0,255, 100) ; 
bgColorSlider . addChangeListener (this) ; 

fgColorSlider = new JSlider (0,255, 200) ; 
f gColorSlider . addChangeListener (this) ; 

/* Create the combo box, and add four items to it, listing 
different font styles. Set up the panel to listen for 
ActionEvents from the combo box. */ 

f ontStyleSelect = new JComboBoxO ; 

fontStyleSelect.addItem( "Plain Font") ; 

f ontStyleSelect. addltemC Italic Font") ; 

f ontStyleSelect. addltem( "Bold Font") ; 

f ontStyleSelect. addltem( "Bold Italic Font"); 

f ontStyleSelect . setSelectedlndex (2) ; 

f ontStyleSelect . addActionListener (this) ; 

/* Create the display label, with properties to match the 

values of the sliders and the setting of the combo box. */ 

displayLabel = new JLabeK "Hello World!", JLabel . CENTER) ; 
displayLabel . setOpaque (true) ; 

displayLabel . setBackground( new Color (100, 100, 100) ); 
displayLabel . setForeground( new Color(255, 200, 200) ); 
displayLabel. setFont( new Font ("Serif " , Font. BOLD, 30) ); 

/* Set the layout for the panel, and add the four components. 
Use a GridLayout with 4 rows and 1 column. */ 

setLayout (new GridLayout (4, 1) ) ; 
add(displayLabel) ; 
add (bgColorSlider) ; 
add(fgColorSlider) ; 
add(f ontStyleSelect) ; 

The class also defines the methods required by the ActionListener and ChangeListener inter- 
faces. The actionPerf ormedQ method is called when the user selects an item in the combo 
box. This method changes the font in the JLabel, where the font depends on which item is 
currently selected in the combo box, f ontStyleSelect: 

public void actionPerf ormed(ActionEvent evt) { 

switch ( f ontStyleSelect .getSelectedlndexO ) { 
case 0: 

displayLabel. setFont( new Font ("Serif " , Font. PLAIN, 30) ); 
break; 
case 1: 

displayLabel. setFont( new Font ("Serif " , Font. ITALIC, 30) ); 
break; 
case 2: 

displayLabel. setFont( new Font ("Serif " , Font. BOLD, 30) ); 
break; 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



293 



case 3: 

displayLabel. setFont( new Font ("Serif " , Font. BOLD + Font. ITALIC, 30) ); 
break; 

} 

} 

And the stateChangedO method, which is called when the user manipulates one of the sliders, 
uses the value on the slider to compute a new foreground or background color for the label. 
The method checks evt . getSource () to determine which slider was changed: 

public void stateChanged(ChangeEvent evt) { 
if (evt. getSource () == bgColorSlider) { 
int bgVal = bgColorSlider . getValue () ; 

displayLabel . setBackground( new Color (bgVal ,bgVal ,bgVal) ); 
// NOTE: The background color is a shade of gray, 
// determined by the setting on the slider. 

} 

else { 

int fgVal = fgColorSlider . getValue () ; 

displayLabel . setForeground( new Color( 255, fgVal, fgVal) );

// white as the slider value increases from to 255.

6.7.4 A Simple Calculator 

As our next example, we look briefly at an example that uses nested subpanels to build a more 
complex user interface. The program has two JTextFields where the user can enter two numbers, 
four JButtons that the user can click to add, subtract, multiply, or divide the two numbers, and 
a JLabel that displays the result of the operation: 



x = 37.2 



y= 4.311 



x *y = 160.3692 



Like the previous example, this example uses a main panel with a GridLayout that has four rows 
and one column. In this case, the layout is created with the statement: 

setLayout (new GridLayout (4,1,3,3)) ; 

which allows a 3-pixel gap between the rows where the gray background color of the panel is 
visible. The gray border around the edges of the panel is added with the statement 

setBorder( BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(5,5,5,5) ); 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



294 



The first row of the grid layout actually contains two components, a JLabel displaying the 
text "x =" and a JTextField. A grid layout can only have one component in each position. In 
this case, that component is a JPanel, a subpanel that is nested inside the main panel. This 
subpanel in turn contains the label and text field. This can be programmed as follows: 

xlnput = new JTextField( "0" , 10); // Create a text field sized to hold 10 chars. 

JPanel xPanel = new JPanel (); // Create the subpanel. 

xPanel. add( new JLabelC x = ")); // Add a label to the subpanel. 

xPanel . add (xlnput ) ; // Add the text field to the subpanel 

mainPanel . add(xPanel) ; // Add the subpanel to the main panel. 

The subpanel uses the default FlowLayout layout manager, so the label and text field are simply 
placed next to each other in the subpanel at their preferred size, and are centered in the 
subpanel. 

Similarly, the third row of the grid layout is a subpanel that contains four buttons. In this 
case, the subpanel uses a GridLayout with one row and four columns, so that the buttons are 
all the same size and completely fill the subpanel. 

One other point of interest in this example is the actionPerf ormed() method that responds 
when the user clicks one of the buttons. This method must retrieve the user's numbers from the 
text field, perform the appropriate arithmetic operation on them (depending on which button 
was clicked), and set the text of the label (named answer) to represent the result. However, the 
contents of the text fields can only be retrieved as strings, and these strings must be converted 
into numbers. If the conversion fails, the label is set to display an error message: 

public void actionPerf ormed(ActionEvent evt) { 

double x, y; // The numbers from the input boxes, 
try { 

String xStr = xlnput . getText () ; 
x = Double .parseDouble(xStr) ; 

} 

catch (NumberFormatException e) { 

// The string xStr is not a legal number, 
answer. setText(" Illegal data for x."); 
xlnput . requestFocus () ; 
return; 

} 

try { 

String yStr = ylnput . getText () ; 
y = Double. parseDouble (yStr) ; 

} 

catch (NumberFormatException e) { 

// The string yStr is not a legal number, 
answer. setText(" Illegal data for y."); 
ylnput . requestFocus () ; 
return; 

} 

/* Perform the operation based on the action command from the 
button. The action command is the text displayed on the button. 
Note that division by zero produces an error message. */ 

String op = evt . getActionCommandO ; 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



295 



if (op.equals("+")) 

answer . setText ( "x + y = " + (x+y) ); 
else if (op.equalsO'-")) 

answer . setText ( "x - y = " + (x-y) ); 
else if (op. equals ("*")) 

answer . setText ( "x * y = " + (x*y) ); 
else if (op. equals ("/")) { 

if (y == 0) 

answer . setText ("Can't divide by zero!"); 

else 

answer . setText ( "x / y = " + (x/y) ); 

} 

} // end actionPerf ormedO 
(The complete source code for this example can be found in SimpleCalc.java.) 

6.7.5 Using a null Layout 

As mentioned above, it is possible to do without a layout manager altogether. For our next 
example, we'll look at a panel that does not use a layout manager. If you set the layout manager 
of a container to be null, by calling container . setLayout (null) , then you assume complete 
responsibility for positioning and sizing the components in that container. 
If comp is any component, then the statement 

comp.setBounds(x, y, width, height); 

puts the top left corner of the component at the point (x,y) , measured in the coordinate system 
of the container that contains the component, and it sets the width and height of the component 
to the specified values. You should only set the bounds of a component if the container that 
contains it has a null layout manager. In a container that has a non-null layout manager, the 
layout manager is responsible for setting the bounds, and you should not interfere with its job. 

Assuming that you have set the layout manager to null, you can call the setBoundsO 
method any time you like. (You can even make a component that moves or changes size while 
the user is watching.) If you are writing a panel that has a known, fixed size, then you can 
set the bounds of each component in the panel's constructor. Note that you must also add the 
components to the panel, using the panel's add (component) instance method; otherwise, the 
component will not appear on the screen. 

Our example contains four components: two buttons, a label, and a panel that displays a 
checkerboard pattern: 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



296 



Click "New Game" to begin a game. 



This is just an example of using a null layout; it doesn't do anything, except that clicking the 
buttons changes the text of the label. (We will use this example in Section 7.5 as a starting 
point for a checkers game.) 

For its content pane, this example uses a main panel that is defined by a class named 
NullLayoutPanel. The four components are created and added to the panel in the constructor 
of the NullLayoutPanel class. Then the setBoundsO method of each component is called to set 
the size and position of the component: 

public NullLayoutPanel () { 

setLayout (null) ; // I will do the layout myself! 

setBackground(new Color(0, 150,0)) ; // A dark green background. 

setBorder( BorderFactory.createEtchedBorderO ); 

setPref erredSize( new Dimension(350,240) ); 

//I assume that the size of the panel is, in fact, 350-by-240 . 

/* Create the components and add them to the content pane. If you 
don't add them to a container, they won't appear, even if 
you set their bounds ! */ 

board = new CheckerboardO ; 

// (Checkerboard is a subclass of JPanel, defined elsewhere.) 
add (board) ; 

newGameButton = new JButtonC'New Game"); 
newGameButton. addActionListener (this) ; 
add (newGameButton) ; 

resignButton = new JButton ( "Resign" ) ; 
resignButton. addActionListener (this) ; 
add (resignButton) ; 

message = new JLabelC'Click V'New Game\" to begin a game."); 
message . setForeground( new Color (100, 255, 100) ); // Light green, 
message. setFont (new Font ("Serif ", Font. BOLD, 14)); 
add (message) ; 



/* Set the position and size of each component by calling 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



297 



its setBounds () method. */ 

board . setBounds (20 , 20 , 164 , 164) ; 
newGameButton. setBounds (210, 60, 120, 30); 
resignButton. setBounds (210, 120, 120, 30); 
message. setBounds (20, 200, 330, 30); 

} // end constructor 

It's reasonably easy, in this case, to get an attractive layout. It's much more difficult 
to do your own layout if you want to allow for changes of size. In that case, you have to 
respond to changes in the container's size by recomputing the sizes and positions of all the 
components that it contains. If you want to respond to changes in a container's size, you can 
register an appropriate listener with the container. Any component generates an event of type 
ComponentEvent when its size changes (and also when it is moved, hidden, or shown). You 
can register a ComponentListener with the container and respond to size change events by 
recomputing the sizes and positions of all the components in the container. Consult a Java 
reference for more information about ComponentEvent s. However, my real advice is that if you 
want to allow for changes in the container's size, try to find a layout manager to do the work 
for you. 

(The complete source code for this example is in NullLayoutDemo.java.) 
6.7.6 A Little Card Game 

For a final example, let's look at something a little more interesting as a program. The example 
is a simple card game in which you look at a playing card and try to predict whether the next 
card will be higher or lower in value. (Aces have the lowest value in this game.) You've seen a 
text-oriented version of the same game in Subsection 5.4.3. Section 5.4 also introduced Deck, 
Hand, and Card classes that are used in the game program. In this GUI version of the game, 
you click on a button to make your prediction. If you predict wrong, you lose. If you make 
three correct predictions, you win. After completing one game, you can click the "New Game" 
button to start a new game. Here is what the game looks like: 




Gotitrightl Try for 3. 









Q Higher } Lower } 


^ New Came ) 



The game is implemented in a subclass of JPanel that is used as the content pane in the applet. 
The source code for the panel is HighLowGUIPanel.java. Applet and standalone versions of 
the program are defined by HighLowGUI Applet Java and HighLowGUI.java. You can try out 
the game in the on-line version of this section, or by running the program as a stand-alone 
application. 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



298 



The overall structure of the main panel in this example should be clear: It has three buttons 
in a subpanel at the bottom of the main panel and a large drawing surface that displays the cards 
and a message. (The cards and message are not themselves components in this example; they 
are drawn in the panel's paintComponent () method.) The main panel uses a BorderLayout. 
The drawing surface occupies the CENTER position of the border layout. The subpanel that 
contains the buttons occupies the SOUTH position of the border layout, and the other three 
positions of the layout are empty. 

The drawing surface is defined by a nested class named CardPanel, which is a subclass of 
JPanel. I have chosen to let the drawing surface object do most of the work of the game: 
It listens for events from the three buttons and responds by taking the appropriate actions. 
The main panel is defined by HighLowGUIPanel itself, which is another subclass of JPanel. 
The constructor of the HighLowGUIPanel class creates all the other components, sets up event 
handling, and lays out the components: 

public HighLowGUIPanel () { // The constructor. 

setBackground( new Color(130,50,40) ); 

setLayout( new BorderLayout (3, 3) ); // BorderLayout with 3-pixel gaps. 

CardPanel board = new CardPanel (); // Where the cards are drawn, 
add (board , BorderLayout . CENTER) ; 

JPanel buttonPanel = new JPanelO; // The subpanel that holds the buttons. 
buttonPanel. setBackground( new Color(220,200, 180) ); 
add (buttonPanel , BorderLayout . SOUTH) ; 

JButton higher = new JButton( "Higher" ) ; 

higher . addActionListener (board) ; // The CardPanel listens for events. 
buttonPanel . add (higher) ; 

JButton lower = new JButton( "Lower" ); 
lower. addActionListener (board) ; 
buttonPanel . add(lower) ; 

JButton newGame = new JButton( "New Game" ) ; 
newGame . addActionListener (board) ; 
buttonPanel . add (newGame) ; 

setBorder (BorderFactory . createLineBorder ( new Color (130, 50, 40) , 3) ); 
} // end constructor 

The programming of the drawing surface class, CardPanel, is a nice example of thinking 
in terms of a state machine. (See Subsection 6.5.4.) It is important to think in terms of the 
states that the game can be in, how the state can change, and how the response to events 
can depend on the state. The approach that produced the original, text-oriented game in 
Subsection 5.4.3 is not appropriate here. Trying to think about the game in terms of a process 
that goes step-by-step from beginning to end is more likely to confuse you than to help you. 

The state of the game includes the cards and the message. The cards are stored in an 
object of type Hand. The message is a String. These values are stored in instance variables. 
There is also another, less obvious aspect of the state: Sometimes a game is in progress, and 
the user is supposed to make a prediction about the next card. Sometimes we are between 
games, and the user is supposed to click the "New Game" button. It's a good idea to keep 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



299 



track of this basic difference in state. The CardPanel class uses a boolean instance variable 
named gamelnProgress for this purpose. 

The state of the game can change whenever the user clicks on a button. The CardPanel 
class implements the ActionListener interface and defines an actionPerf ormedO method to 
respond to the user's clicks. This method simply calls one of three other methods, doHigher () , 
doLowerO, or newGameO, depending on which button was pressed. It's in these three event- 
handling methods that the action of the game takes place. 

We don't want to let the user start a new game if a game is currently in progress. That would 
be cheating. So, the response in the newGameO method is different depending on whether the 
state variable gamelnProgress is true or false. If a game is in progress, the message instance 
variable should be set to show an error message. If a game is not in progress, then all the state 
variables should be set to appropriate values for the beginning of a new game. In any case, the 
board must be repainted so that the user can see that the state has changed. The complete 
newGameO method is as follows: 

/** 

* Called by the CardPanel constructor, and called by actionPerf ormedO if 

* the user clicks the "New Game" button. Start a new game. 
*/ 

void doNewGameO { 

if (gamelnProgress) { 

//If the current game is not over, it is an error to try 
// to start a new game, 
message = "You still have to finish this game!"; 
repaint () ; 
return; 

> 

deck = new DeckO; // Create the deck and hand to use for this game, 
hand = new HandO ; 
deck. shuf f le() ; 

hand . addCard ( deck.dealCardO ); // Deal the first card into the hand, 
message = "Is the next card higher or lower?"; 
gamelnProgress = true; 
repaint () ; 
} // end doNewGameO 

The doHigher () and doLowerO methods are almost identical to each other (and could 
probably have been combined into one method with a parameter, if I were more clever). Let's 
look at the doHigher () routine. This is called when the user clicks the "Higher" button. This 
only makes sense if a game is in progress, so the first thing doHigher () should do is check the 
value of the state variable gamelnProgress. If the value is false, then doHigher () should just 
set up an error message. If a game is in progress, a new card should be added to the hand and 
the user's prediction should be tested. The user might win or lose at this time. If so, the value 
of the state variable gamelnProgress must be set to false because the game is over. In any 
case, the board is repainted to show the new state. Here is the doHigher () method: 

/** 

* Called by actionPerf ormedO when user clicks "Higher" button. 

* Check the user's prediction. Game ends if user guessed 

* wrong or if the user has made three correct predictions. 
*/ 

void doHigher () { 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



300 



if (gamelnProgress == false) { 

// If the game has ended, it was an error to click "Higher", 
// So set up an error message and abort processing. 

message = "Click V'New Game\" to start a new game!"; 

repaint () ; 

return; 

} 

hand . addCard ( deck.dealCardO ); // Deal a card to the hand, 

int cardCt = hand.getCardCountO ; 

Card thisCard = hand.getCard( cardCt - 1 ); // Card just dealt. 
Card prevCard = hand.getCard( cardCt - 2 ); // The previous card, 
if ( thisCard. get Value () < prevCard. getValueO ) { 

gamelnProgress = false; 

message = "Too bad! You lose."; 

} 

else if ( thisCard. getValueO == prevCard. getValueO ) { 
gamelnProgress = false; 

message = "Too bad! You lose on ties."; 

} 

else if ( cardCt == 4) { 
gamelnProgress = false; 

message = "You win! You made three correct guesses."; 

} 

else { 

message = "Got it right! Try for " + cardCt + "."; 

} 

repaint () ; 
} // end doHigherO 

The paintComponent () method of the CardPanel class uses the values in the state variables 
to decide what to show. It displays the string stored in the message variable. It draws each 
of the cards in the hand. There is one little tricky bit: If a game is in progress, it draws an 
extra face-down card, which is not in the hand, to represent the next card in the deck. Drawing 
the cards requires some care and computation. I wrote a method, "void drawCard (Graphics 
g, Card card, int x, int y)", which draws a card with its upper left corner at the point 
(x,y). The paintComponent () routine decides where to draw each card and calls this routine 
to do the drawing. You can check out all the details in the source code, HighLowGUIPanel.java. 
(The playing cards used in this program are not very impressive. A version of the program 
with images that actually look like cards can be found in Subsection 13.1.3.) 



6.8 Menus and Dialogs 

We have already encountered many of the basic aspects of GUI programming, but (online) 
professional programs use many additional features. We will cover some of the advanced features 
of Java GUI programming in Chapter 13, but in this section we look briefly at a few more basic 
features that are essential for writing GUI programs. I will discuss these features in the context 
of a "MosaicDraw" program that is shown in this picture: 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



301 



Control Color Tools 




As the user clicks-and-drags the mouse in the large drawing area of this program, it leaves a 
trail of little colored squares. There is some random variation in the color of the squares. (This 
is meant to make the picture look a little more like a real mosaic, which is a picture made out of 
small colored stones in which there would be some natural color variation.) There is a menu bar 
above the drawing area. The "Control" menu contains commands for filling and clearing the 
drawing area, along with a few options that affect the appearance of the picture. The "Color" 
menu lets the user select the color that will be used when the user draws. The "Tools" menu 
affects the behavior of the mouse. Using the default "Draw" tool, the mouse leaves a trail of 
single squares. Using the "Draw 3x3" tool, the mouse leaves a swath of colored squares that is 
three squares wide. There are also "Erase" tools, which let the user set squares back to their 
default black color. 

The drawing area of the program is a panel that belongs to the MosaicPanel class, a subclass 
of JPanel that is defined in MosaicPanel. java. MosaicPanel is a highly reusable class for repre- 
senting mosaics of colored rectangles. It does not directly support drawing on the mosaic, but 
it does support setting the color of each individual square. The MosaicDraw program installs a 
mouse listener on the panel; the mouse listener responds to mousePressed and mouseDragged 
events on the panel by setting the color of the square that contains the mouse. This is a nice 
example of applying a listener to an object to do something that was not programmed into the 
object itself. 

Most of the programming for MosaicDraw can be found in MosaicDrawController.java. (It 
could have gone into the MosaicPanel class, if I had not decided to use that pre-existing class 
in unmodified form.) It is the MosaicDrawController class that creates a MosaicPanel object 
and adds a mouse listener to it. It also creates the menu bar that is shown at the top of 
the program and implements all the commands in the menu bar. It has an instance method 
getMosaicPanel () that returns a reference to the mosaic panel that it has created, and it 
has another instance method getMenuBarQ that returns a menu bar for the program. These 
methods are used to obtain the panel and menu bar so that they can be added to an applet or 
a frame. 

To get a working program, an object of type JApplet or JFrame is needed. The files 
MosaicDrawApplet.java and MosaicDrawFrame.java define the applet and frame versions of 
the program. These are rather simple classes; they simply create a MosaicDrawController 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



302 



object and use its mosaic panel and menu bar. I urge you to study these files, along with 
MosaicDrawController.java. I will not be discussing all aspects of the code here, but you 
should be able to understand it all after reading this section. As for MosaicPanel.java, it uses 
some techniques that you would not understand at this point, but I encourage you to at least 
read the comments in this file to learn about the API for mosaic panels. 

6.8.1 Menus and Menubars 

MosaicDraw is the first example that we have seen that uses a menu bar. Fortunately, menus 
are very easy to use in Java. The items in a menu are represented by the class JMenultem (this 
class and other menu-related classes are in package j avax . swing) . Menu items are used in 
almost exactly the same way as buttons. In fact, JMenultem and J Button are both subclasses 
of a class, AbstractButton, that defines their common behavior. In particular, a JMenultem is 
created using a constructor that specifies the text of the menu item, such as: 

JMenultem fillCommand = new JMenuItemC'Fill") ; 

You can add an ActionListener to a JMenultem by calling the menu item's addActionListener () 
method. The actionPerf ormed() method of the action listener is called when the user selects 
the item from the menu. You can change the text of the item by calling its setText (String) 
method, and you can enable it and disable it using the setEnabled (boolean) method. All this 
works in exactly the same way as for a JButton. 

The main difference between a menu item and a button, of course, is that a menu item 
is meant to appear in a menu rather than in a panel. A menu in Java is represented by 
the class JMenu. A JMenu has a name, which is specified in the constructor, and it has an 
add (JMenultem) method that can be used to add a JMenultem to the menu. So, the "Tools" 
menu in the MosaicDraw program could be created as follows, where listener is a variable of 
type ActionListener: 

JMenu toolsMenu = new JMenu( "Tools" ) ; // Create a menu with name "Tools" 

JMenultem drawCommand = new JMenultem ( "Draw" ) ; // Create a menu item. 
drawCommand. addActionListener (listener) ; // Add listener to menu item. 

toolsMenu. add (drawCommand) ; // Add menu item to menu. 



Once a menu has been created, it must be added to a menu bar. A menu bar is represented 
by the class JMenuBar. A menu bar is just a container for menus. It does not have a name, 
and its constructor does not have any parameters. It has an add (JMenu) method that can 
be used to add menus to the menu bar. The name of the menu then appears in the menu 
bar. For example, the MosaicDraw program uses three menus, controlMenu, colorMenu, and 
toolsMenu. We could create a menu bar and add the menus to it with the statements: 

JMenuBar menuBar = new JMenuBar (); 
menuBar . add (controlMenu) ; 
menuBar . add (colorMenu) ; 
menuBar . add (toolsMenu) ; 



JMenultem eraseCommand = new JMenuItem( "Erase" ) ; 
eraseCommand . addActionListener (listener ) ; 
toolsMenu. add (eraseCommand) ; 



// Create a menu item. 

// Add listener to menu item. 

// Add menu item to menu. 



// Create and add other menu items. 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



303 



The final step in using menus is to use the menu bar in a J Applet or JFrame. We have already 
seen that an applet or frame has a "content pane." The menu bar is another component of the 
applet or frame, not contained inside the content pane. Both the JApplet and the JFrame 
classes include an instance method setMenuBar ( JMenuBar) that can be used to set the menu 
bar. (There can only be one, so this is a "set" method rather than an "add" method.) In the 
MosaicDraw program, the menu bar is created by a MosaicDrawController object and can be 
obtained by calling that object's getMenuBarQ method. Here is the basic code that is used (in 
somewhat modified form) to set up the interface both in the applet and in the frame version of 
the program: 

MosaicDrawController controller = new MosaicDrawController () ; 
MosaicPanel content = controller . getMosaicPanel () ; 

setContentPane ( content ); // Use panel from controller as content pane. 
JMenuBar menuBar = controller .getMenuBarO ; 

set JMenuBar ( menuBar ); // Use the menu bar from the controller. 

Using menus always follows the same general pattern: Create a menu bar. Create menus 
and add them to the menu bar. Create menu items and add them to the menus (and set up 
listening to handle action events from the menu items). Use the menu bar in a JApplet or 
JFrame by calling the set JMenuBar () method of the applet or frame. 

* * * 

There are other kinds of menu items, defined by subclasses of JMenultem, that can be added 
to menus. One of these is JCheckBoxMenultem, which represents menu items that can be in one 
of two states, selected or not selected. A JCheckBoxMenultem has the same functionality and is 
used in the same way as a JCheckBox (see Subsection 6.6.3). Three JCheckBoxMenultems are 
used in the "Control" menu of the MosaicDraw program. One can be used to turn the random 
color variation of the squares on and off. Another turns a symmetry feature on and off; when 
symmetry is turned on, the user's drawing is reflected horizontally and vertically to produce a 
symmetric pattern. And the third checkbox menu item shows and hides the "grouting" in the 
mosaic; the grouting is the gray lines that are drawn around each of the little squares in the 
mosaic. The menu item that corresponds to the "Use Randomness" option in the "Control" 
menu could be set up with the statements: 

JMenultem useRandomnessToggle = new JCheckBoxMenuItemC'Use Randomness"); 
useRandomnessToggle . addActionListener (listener) ; // Set up a listener. 
useRandomnessToggle . setSelected (true) ; // Randomness is initially turned on. 
controlMenu. add (useRandomnessToggle) ; // Add the menu item to the menu. 

The "Use Randomness" JCheckBoxMenultem corresponds to a boolean-valued instance vari- 
able named useRandomness in the MosaicDrawController class. This variable is part of the state 
of the controller object. Its value is tested whenever the user draws one of the squares, to decide 
whether or not to add a random variation to the color of the square. When the user selects 
the "Use Randomness" command from the menu, the state of the JCheckBoxMenultem is re- 
versed, from selected to not-selected or from not-selected to selected. The ActionListener for 
the menu item checks whether the menu item is selected or not, and it changes the value of 
useRandomness to match. Note that selecting the menu command does not have any immediate 
effect on the picture that is shown in the window. It just changes the state of the program so 
that future drawing operations on the part of the user will have a different effect. The "Use 
Symmetry" option in the "Control" menu works in much the same way. The "Show Grouting" 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



304 



option is a little different. Selecting the "Show Grouting" option does have an immediate effect: 
The picture is redrawn with or without the grouting, depending on the state of the menu item. 

My program uses a single ActionListener to respond to all of the menu items in all the 
menus. This is not a particularly good design, but it is easy to implement for a small program 
like this one. The actionPerf ormed() method of the listener object uses the statement 

String command = evt . getActionCommandO ; 

to get the action command of the source of the event; this will be the text of the menu item. 
The listener tests the value of command to determine which menu item was selected by the user. 
If the menu item is a JCheckBoxMenultem, the listener must check the state of the menu item. 
The menu item is the source of the event that is being processed. The listener can get its hands 
on the menu item object by calling evt.getSourceQ. Since the return value of getSourceO 
is of type Object, the return value must be type-cast to the correct type. Here, for example, is 
the code that handles the "Use Randomness" command: 

if (command. equals ("Use Randomness")) { 

// Set the value of useRandomness depending on the menu item's state. 
JCheckBoxMenultem toggle = (JCheckBoxMenultem) evt .getSourceO ; 
useRandomness = toggle . isSelectedO ; 

} 

(The actionPerf ormed() method uses a rather long if. .then, .else statement to check all 
the possible action commands. This would be a natural place to use a switch statement with 
command as the selector and all the possible action commands as cases. However, this can only 
be done if you are sure that the program will be run using Java 7 or later, since Strings were 
not allowed in switch statements in earlier versions of Java.) 

* * * 

In addition to menu items, a menu can contain lines that separate the menu items into 
groups. In the MosaicDraw program, the "Control" menu contains such a separator. A JMenu 
has an instance method addSeparator () that can be used to add a separator to the menu. For 
example, the separator in the "Control" menu was created with the statement: 

controlMenu. addSeparator () ; 

A menu can also contain a submenu. The name of the submenu appears as an item in the 
main menu. When the user moves the mouse over the submenu name, the submenu pops up. 
(There is no example of this in the MosaicDraw program.) It is very easy to do this in Java: 
You can add one JMenu to another JMenu using a statement such as mainMenu. add (submenu). 

6.8.2 Dialogs 

One of the commands in the "Color" menu of the MosaicDraw program is "Custom Color. . . ". 
When the user selects this command, a new window appears where the user can select a color. 
This window is an example of a dialog or dialog box. A dialog is a type of window that is 
generally used for short, single purpose interactions with the user. For example, a dialog box 
can be used to display a message to the user, to ask the user a question, to let the user select a 
file to be opened, or to let the user select a color. In Swing, a dialog box is represented by an 
object belonging to the class JDialog or to a subclass. 

The JDialog class is very similar to JFrame and is used in much the same way. Like a 
frame, a dialog box is a separate window. Unlike a frame, however, a dialog is not completely 
independent. Every dialog is associated with a frame (or another dialog), which is called 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



305 



its parent window. The dialog box is dependent on its parent. For example, if the parent is 
closed, the dialog box will also be closed. It is possible to create a dialog box without specifying 
a parent, but in that case an invisible frame is created by the system to serve as the parent. 

Dialog boxes can be either modal or modeless . When a modal dialog is created, its parent 
frame is blocked. That is, the user will not be able to interact with the parent until the dialog 
box is closed. Modeless dialog boxes do not block their parents in the same way, so they seem 
a lot more like independent windows. In practice, modal dialog boxes are easier to use and are 
much more common than modeless dialogs. All the examples we will look at are modal. 

Aside from having a parent, a J Dialog can be created and used in the same way as a 
JFrame. However, I will not give any examples here of using JDialog directly. Swing has many 
convenient methods for creating common types of dialog boxes. For example, the color choice 
dialog that appears when the user selects the "Custom Color" command in the MosaicDraw 
program belongs to the class JColorChooser, which is a subclass of JDialog. The JColorChooser 
class has a static method that makes color choice dialogs very easy to use: 

Color JColorChooser . showDialog (Component parentComp, 

String title, Color initialColor) 

When you call this method, a dialog box appears that allows the user to select a color. The 
first parameter specifies the parent of the dialog; the parent window of the dialog will be the 
window (if any) that contains parentComp; this parameter can be null and it can itself be 
a frame or dialog object. The second parameter is a string that appears in the title bar of 
the dialog box. And the third parameter, initialColor, specifies the color that is selected 
when the color choice dialog first appears. The dialog has a sophisticated interface that allows 
the user to change the selected color. When the user presses an "OK" button, the dialog box 
closes and the selected color is returned as the value of the method. The user can also click a 
"Cancel" button or close the dialog box in some other way; in that case, null is returned as 
the value of the method. This is a modal dialog, and the showDialog () does not return until 
the user dismisses the dialog box in some way. By using this predefined color chooser dialog, 
you can write one line of code that will let the user select an arbitrary color. Swing also has a 
JFileChooser class that makes it almost as easy to show a dialog box that lets the user select a 
file to be opened or saved. 

The JOptionPane class includes a variety of methods for making simple dialog boxes that 
are variations on three basic types: a "message" dialog, a "confirm" dialog, and an "input" 
dialog. (The variations allow you to provide a title for the dialog box, to specify the icon that 
appears in the dialog, and to add other components to the dialog box. I will only cover the 
most basic forms here.) The on-line version of this section includes an applet that demonstrates 
JOptionPane as well as JColorChooser. 

A message dialog simply displays a message string to the user. The user (hopefully) reads 
the message and dismisses the dialog by clicking the "OK" button. A message dialog can be 
shown by calling the static method: 

void JOptionPane . showMessageDialog (Component parentComp, String message) 

The message can be more than one line long. Lines in the message should be separated by 
newline characters, \n. New lines will not be inserted automatically, even if the message is very 
long. 

An input dialog displays a question or request and lets the user type in a string as a response. 
You can show an input dialog by calling: 

String JOptionPane . showInputDialog (Component parentComp, String question) 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



306 



Again, the question can include newline characters. The dialog box will contain an input box, 
an "OK" button, and a "Cancel" button. If the user clicks "Cancel" , or closes the dialog box 
in some other way, then the return value of the method is null. If the user clicks "OK", then 
the return value is the string that was entered by the user. Note that the return value can be 
an empty string (which is not the same as a null value), if the user clicks "OK" without typing 
anything in the input box. If you want to use an input dialog to get a numerical value from 
the user, you will have to convert the return value into a number; see Subsection 3.7.2. 

Finally, a confirm dialog presents a question and three response buttons: "Yes" , "No" , and 
"Cancel" . A confirm dialog can be shown by calling: 

int JOptionPane . showConf irmDialog (Component parentComp, String question) 
The return value tells you the user's response. It is one of the following constants: 

• JOptionPane. YESJDPTION — the user clicked the "Yes" button 

• JOptionPane. NCL0PTI0N — the user clicked the "No" button 

• JOptionPane. CANCEL_0PTI0N — the user clicked the "Cancel" button 

• JOptionPane . CL0SE_0PTI0N — the dialog was closed in some other way. 

By the way, it is possible to omit the Cancel button from a confirm dialog by calling one of 
the other methods in the JOptionPane class. Just call: 

JOptionPane . showConf irmDialog ( 

parent, question, title, JOptionPane . YES_N0_0PTI0N ) 

The final parameter is a constant which specifies that only a "Yes" button and a "No" button 
should be used. The third parameter is a string that will be displayed as the title of the dialog 
box window. 

If you would like to see how dialogs are created and used in the sample applet, you can find 
the source code in the file SimpleDialogDemo.java. 

6.8.3 Fine Points of Frames 

In previous sections, whenever I used a frame, I created a JFrame object in a main() routine 
and installed a panel as the content pane of that frame. This works fine, but a more object- 
oriented approach is to define a subclass of JFrame and to set up the contents of the frame 
in the constructor of that class. This is what I did in the case of the MosaicDraw program. 
MosaicDrawFrame is defined as a subclass of JFrame. The definition of this class is very short, 
but it illustrates several new features of frames that I want to discuss: 

public class MosaicDrawFrame extends JFrame { 

public static void main(String[] args) { 
JFrame window = new MosaicDrawFrame () ; 
window. setDef aultCloseOperat ion (JFrame . EXIT_0N_CL0SE) ; 
window. setVisible (true) ; 

} 

public MosaicDrawFrame () { 
super ("Mosaic Draw"); 

MosaicDrawController controller = new MosaicDrawController () ; 
setContentPane( controller .getMosaicPanelO ); 
setJMenuBar( controller .getMenuBarO ); 
packO ; 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



307 



Dimension screensize = Toolkit . getDef aultToolkit (). getScreenSize () ; 
setLocation( (screensize .width - getWidth())/2, 

(screensize .height - getHeight () ) /2 ); 

} 

} 

The constructor in this class begins with the statement super ("Mosaic Draw") , which calls 
the constructor in the superclass, J Frame. The parameter specifies a title that will appear in 
the title bar of the window. The next three lines of the constructor set up the contents of the 
window; a MosaicDrawController is created, and the content pane and menu bar of the window 
are obtained from the controller. The next line is something new. If window is a variable of 
type J Frame (or J Dialog), then the statement window, pack () will resize the window so that its 
size matches the preferred size of its contents. (In this case, of course, "packQ" is equivalent 
to "this .packO"; that is, it refers to the window that is being created by the constructor.) 
The pack() method is usually the best way to set the size of a window. Note that it will only 
work correctly if every component in the window has a correct preferred size. This is only a 
problem in two cases: when a panel is used as a drawing surface and when a panel is used as 
a container with a null layout manager. In both these cases there is no way for the system to 
determine the correct preferred size automatically, and you should set a preferred size by hand. 
For example: 

panel . setPref erredSize ( new Dimension (400 , 250) ); 

The last two lines in the constructor position the window so that it is exactly centered on 
the screen. The line 

Dimension screensize = Toolkit . getDef aultToolkit (). getScreenSize () ; 

determines the size of the screen. The size of the screen is screensize .width pixels in the hor- 
izontal direction and screensize .height pixels in the vertical direction. The setLocationO 
method of the frame sets the position of the upper left corner of the frame on the screen. The 
expression "screensize. width - getWidthO" is the amount of horizontal space left on the 
screen after subtracting the width of the window. This is divided by 2 so that half of the empty 
space will be to the left of the window, leaving the other half of the space to the right of the 
window. Similarly, half of the extra vertical space is above the window, and half is below. 

Note that the constructor has created the window and set its size and position, but that 
at the end of the constructor, the window is not yet visible on the screen. (More exactly, the 
constructor has created the window object, but the visual representation of that object on the 
screen has not yet been created.) To show the window on the screen, it will be necessary to 
call its instance method, window. setVisible (true) . 

In addition to the constructor, the MosaicDrawFrame class includes a main() routine. This 
makes it possible to run MosaicDrawFrame as a stand-alone application. (The main() routine, as 
a static method, has nothing to do with the function of a MosaicDrawFrame object, and it could 
(and perhaps should) be in a separate class.) The main() routine creates a MosaicDrawFrame 
and makes it visible on the screen. It also calls 

window. setDef aultCloseOperation( JFrame . EXIT_0N_CL0SE) ; 

which means that the program will end when the user closes the window. Note that this is 
not done in the constructor because doing it there would make MosaicDrawFrame less flexible. 
It is possible, for example, to write a program that lets the user open multiple MosaicDraw 
windows. In that case, we don't want to end the program just because the user has closed one 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



308 



of the windows. Furthermore, it is possible for an applet to create a frame, which will open as 
a separate window on the screen. An applet is not allowed to "terminate the program" (and 
it's not even clear what that should mean in the case of an applet), and attempting to do so 
will produce an exception. There are other possible values for the default close operation of a 
window: 

• JFrame . D0_N0THING_0N_CL0SE — the user's attempts to close the window by clicking its 
close box will be ignored. 

• JFrame . HIDE_0N_CLDSE — when the user clicks its close box, the window will be hidden 
just as if window. setVisible (false) were called. The window can be made visible again 
by calling window . setVisible (true) . This is the value that is used if you do not specify 
another value by calling setDef aultCloseOperation. 

• JFrame .DISP0SE_0N_CL0SE — the window is closed and any operating system resources 
used by the window are released. It is not possible to make the window visible again. 
(This is the proper way to permanently get rid of a window without ending the program. 
You can accomplish the same thing by calling the instance method window. dispose ().) 

I've written an applet version of the MosaicDraw program that appears on a Web page as a 
single button. When the user clicks the button, the applet opens a MosaicDrawFrame. In this 
case, the applet sets the default close operation of the window to JFrame . DISPDSE_DN_CLOSE. 
You can try the applet in the on-line version of this section. 

The file MosaicDrawLauncher Applet Java contains the source code for the applet. One 
interesting point in the applet is that the text of the button changes depending on whether a 
window is open or not. If there is no window, the text reads "Launch MosaicDraw". When 
the window is open, it changes to "Close MosaicDraw", and clicking the button will close the 
window. The change is implemented by attaching a Window/Listener to the window. The listener 
responds to WindowEvents that are generated when the window opens and closes. Although I 
will not discuss window events further here, you can look at the source code for an example of 
how they can be used. 

6.8.4 Creating Jar Files 

As the final topic for this chapter, we look again at jar files. Recall that a jar file is a "java 
archive" that can contain a number of class files. When creating a program that uses more 
than one class, it's usually a good idea to place all the classes that are required by the program 
into a jar file. If that is done, then a user will only need that one file to run the program. 
Subsection 6.2.4 discusses how a jar file can be used for an applet. Jar files can also be used 
for stand-alone applications. In fact, it is possible to make a so-called executable jar file. A 
user can run an executable jar file in much the same way as any other application, usually by 
double-clicking the icon of the jar file. (The user's computer must have a correct version of Java 
installed, and the computer must be configured correctly for this to work. The configuration is 
usually done automatically when Java is installed, at least on Windows and Mac OS.) 

The question, then, is how to create a jar file. The answer depends on what programming 
environment you are using. The two basic types of programming environment — command line 
and IDE — were discussed in Section 2.6. Any IDE (Integrated Programming Environment) for 
Java should have a command for creating jar files. In the Eclipse IDE, for example, it can be 
done as follows: In the Package Explorer pane, select the programming project (or just all the 
individual source code files that you need). Right-click on the selection, and choose "Export" 



CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING 



309 



from the menu that pops up. In the window that appears, select "JAR file" and click "Next" . 
In the window that appears next, enter a name for the jar file in the box labeled "JAR file". 
(Click the "Browse" button next to this box to select the file name using a file dialog box.) The 
name of the file should end with ".jar". If you are creating a regular jar file, not an executable 
one, you can hit "Finish" at this point, and the jar file will be created. You could do this, for 
example, if the jar file contains an applet but no main program. To create an executable file, 
hit the "Next" button twice to get to the "Jar Manifest Specification" screen. At the bottom 
of this screen is an input box labeled "Main class". You have to enter the name of the class 
that contains the main() routine that will be run when the jar file is executed. If you hit the 
"Browse" button next to the "Main class" box, you can select the class from a list of classes 
that contain main() routines. Once you've selected the main class, you can click the "Finish" 
button to create the executable jar file. (Note that newer versions of Eclipse also have an option 
for exporting an executable Jar file in fewer steps.) 

It is also possible to create jar files on the command line. The Java Development Kit includes 
a command-line program named jar that can be used to create jar files. If all your classes are 
in the default package (like most of the examples in this book), then the jar command is easy 
to use. To create a non-executable jar file on the command line, change to the directory that 
contains the class files that you want to include in the jar. Then give the command 

jar cf JarFileName . jar *. class 

where JarFileName can be any name that you want to use for the jar file. The "*" in "* . class" 
is a wildcard that makes * . class match every class file in the current directory. This means 
that all the class files in the directory will be included in the jar file. If you want to include 
only certain class files, you can name them individually, separated by spaces. (Things get more 
complicated if your classes are not in the default package. In that case, the class files must be 
in subdirectories of the directory in which you issue the jar command. See Subsection 2.6.4.) 

Making an executable jar file on the command line is more complicated. There has to be 
some way of specifying which class contains the main() routine. This is done by creating a 
manifest file. The manifest file can be a plain text file containing a single line of the form 

Main-Class: ClassName 

where ClassName should be replaced by the name of the class that contains the main() routine. 
For example, if the main() routine is in the class MosaicDrawFrame, then the manifest file should 
read "Main-Class: MosaicDrawFrame". You can give the manifest file any name you like. 
Put it in the same directory where you will issue the jar command, and use a command of the 
form 

jar cmf Manif estFileName JarFileName . jar *. class 

to create the jar file. (The jar command is capable of performing a variety of different opera- 
tions. The first parameter to the command, such as "cf" or "cmf", tells it which operation to 
perform.) 

By the way, if you have successfully created an executable jar file, you can run it on the 
command line using the command "java -jar". For example: 

java -jar JarFileName . jar

Exercises for Chapter 6 

1. In the SimpleStamperPanel example from Subsection 6.4.2, a rectangle or oval is drawn (solution) 
on the panel when the user clicks the mouse, except that when the user shift-clicks, the 
panel is cleared instead. Modify this class so that the modified version will continue to 
draw figures as the user drags the mouse. That is, the mouse will leave a trail of figures 
as the user drags. However, if the user shift-clicks, the panel should simply be cleared and 
no figures should be drawn even if the user drags the mouse after shift-clicking. Use your 
panel either in an applet or in a stand-alone application (or both). Here is a picture of 
my solution: 




The source code for the original panel class is SimpleStamperPanel.java. An applet 
that uses this class can be found in SimpleStamperApplet.java, and a main program that 
uses the panel in a frame is in SimpleStamper.java. See the discussion of dragging in 
Subsection 6.4.4. (Note that in the original version, I drew a black outline around each 
shape. In the modified version, I decided that it would look better to draw a gray outline 
instead.) 

If you want to make the problem a little more challenging, when drawing shapes during 
a drag operation, make sure that the shapes that are drawn are at least, say, 5 pixels apart. 
To implement this, you have to keep track of the position of the last shape that was drawn. 

2. Write a panel that shows a small red square and a small blue square. The user should be (solution) 
able to drag either square with the mouse. (You'll need an instance variable to remember 

which square the user is dragging.) The user can drag the square off the applet if she 
wants; if she does this, there is no way to get it back. Use your panel in either an applet 
or a stand-alone application. 

Note that for this exercise, you should do all the drawing in the paintComponent () 
method (as indeed you should whenever possible). 

3. Write a panel that shows a pair of dice. When the user clicks on the panel, the dice should (solution) 
be rolled (that is, the dice should be assigned newly computed random values). Each die 

should be drawn as a square showing from 1 to 6 dots. Since you have to draw two dice, 
its a good idea to write a subroutine, "void drawDie (Graphics g, int val, int x, 
int y)", to draw a die at the specified (x,y) coordinates. The second parameter, val, 
specifies the value that is showing on the die. Assume that the size of the panel is 100 



Exercises 



311 



by 100 pixels. Also write an applet that uses your panel as its content pane. Here is a 
picture of the applet: 




4. In Exercise 6.3, you wrote a pair-of-dice panel where the dice are rolled when the user (solution) 
clicks on the panel. Now make a pair-of-dice program in which the user rolls the dice 

by clicking a button. The button should appear under the panel that shows the dice. 
Also make the following change: When the dice are rolled, instead of just showing the 
new value, show a short animation during which the values on the dice are changed in 
every frame. The animation is supposed to make the dice look more like they are actually 
rolling. Write your program as a stand-alone application. 

5. In Exercise 3.6, you drew a checkerboard. For this exercise, write a checkerboard applet (solution) 
where the user can select a square by clicking on it. Highlight the selected square by 

drawing a colored border around it. When the applet is first created, no square is selected. 
When the user clicks on a square that is not currently selected, it becomes selected (and 
the previously selected square, if any, is unselected). If the user clicks the square that is 
selected, it becomes unselected. Assume that the size of the applet is exactly 160 by 160 
pixels, so that each square on the checkerboard is 20 by 20 pixels. 

6. For this exercise, you should modify the SubKiller game from Subsection 6.5.4. You can (solution) 
start with the existing source code, from the file SubKillerPanel.java. Modify the game 

so it keeps track of the number of hits and misses and displays these quantities. That 
is, every time the depth charge blows up the sub, the number of hits goes up by one. 
Every time the depth charge falls off the bottom of the screen without hitting the sub, the 
number of misses goes up by one. There is room at the top of the panel to display these 
numbers. To do this exercise, you only have to add a half-dozen lines to the source code. 
But you have to figure out what they are and where to add them. To do this, you'll have 
to read the source code closely enough to understand how it works. 

7. Exercise 5.2 involved a class, StatCalc.java, that could compute some statistics of a set of (solution) 
numbers. Write a program that uses the StatCalc class to compute and display statistics 

of numbers entered by the user. The panel will have an instance variable of type StatCalc 
that does the computations. The panel should include a JTextField where the user enters 
a number. It should have four labels that display four statistics for the numbers that have 
been entered: the number of numbers, the sum, the mean, and the standard deviation. 
Every time the user enters a new number, the statistics displayed on the labels should 
change. The user enters a number by typing it into the JTextField and pressing return. 
There should be a "Clear" button that clears out all the data. This means creating a new 
StatCalc object and resetting the displays on the labels. My panel also has an "Enter" 
button that does the same thing as pressing the return key in the JTextField. (Recall that 
a JTextField generates an ActionEvent when the user presses return, so your panel should 



Exercises 



312 



register itself to listen for ActionEvents from the JTextField.) Write your program as a 
stand-alone application. Here is a picture of my solution to this problem: 



Enter a number, press return: 




Enter Clear 


Number of Entries; 


Sum; 


0.0 


Average; 


undefined 


Standard Deviation: undefined 



8. Write a panel with a JTextArea where the user can enter some text. The panel should (solution) 
have a button. When the user clicks on the button, the panel should count the number 
of lines in the user's input, the number of words in the user's input, and the number of 
characters in the user's input. This information should be displayed on three labels in 
the panel. Recall that if textlnput is a JTextArea, then you can get the contents of the 
JTextArea by calling the function textlnput .getText () . This function returns a String 
containing all the text from the text area. The number of characters is just the length 
of this String. Lines in the String are separated by the new line character, '\n', so the 
number of lines is just the number of new line characters in the String, plus one. Words 
are a little harder to count. Exercise 3.4 has some advice about finding the words in a 
String. Essentially, you want to count the number of characters that are first characters 
in words. Don't forget to put your JTextArea in a JScrollPane, and add the scroll pane to 
the container, not the text area. Scrollbars should appear when the user types more text 
than will fit in the available area. Here is a picture of my solution: 

To watch his woods fill up with snow. 

My little horse must think it queer 
To stop without a farmhouse near 
Between the woods and frozen lake 
The darkest evening of the year. 

He gives his harness bells a shake 
To ask if there is some mistake. 



Process the Text 



Number of Lines: 18 



Number of Words: 108 



Number of Chars: 554 



9. Write a GUI Blackjack program that lets the user play a game of Blackjack, with the (solution) 
computer as the dealer. The applet should draw the user's cards and the dealer's cards, 



Exercises 



313 



just as was done for the graphical HighLow card game in Subsection 6.7.6. You can use 
the source code for that game, HighLowGUI.java, for some ideas about how to write 
your Blackjack game. The structures of the HighLow panel and the Blackjack panel are 
very similar. You will certainly want to use the drawCardO method from the HighLow 
program. 

You can find a description of the game of Blackjack in Exercise 5.5. Add the following 
rule to that description: If a player takes five cards without going over 21, that player wins 
immediately. This rule is used in some casinos. For your program, it means that you only 
have to allow room for five cards. You should assume that the panel is just wide enough 
to show five cards, and that it is tall enough show the user's hand and the dealer's hand. 

Note that the design of a GUI Blackjack game is very different from the design of the 
text-oriented program that you wrote for Exercise 5.5. The user should play the game by 
clicking on "Hit" and "Stand" buttons. There should be a "New Game" button that can 
be used to start another game after one game ends. You have to decide what happens 
when each of these buttons is pressed. You don't have much chance of getting this right 
unless you think in terms of the states that the game can be in and how the state can 
change. 

Your program will need the classes defined in Card.java, Hand.java, Deck.java, and 
B lackj ackHand.j ava . 

10. In the Blackjack game from Exercise 6.9, the user can click on the "Hit", "Stand", and (solution) 
"NewGame" buttons even when it doesn't make sense to do so. It would be better if the 
buttons were disabled at the appropriate times. The "New Game" button should be dis- 
abled when there is a game in progress. The "Hit" and "Stand" buttons should be disabled 
when there is not a game in progress. The instance variable gamelnProgress tells whether 
or not a game is in progress, so you just have to make sure that the buttons are properly 
enabled and disabled whenever this variable changes value. I strongly advise writing a sub- 
routine that can be called whenever it is necessary to set the value of the gamelnProgress 
variable. Then the subroutine can take responsibility for enabling and disabling the but- 
tons. Recall that if bttn is a variable of type JButton, then bttn. setEnabled(f alse) 
disables the button and bttn. setEnabled (true) enables the button. 

As a second (and more difficult) improvement, make it possible for the user to place 
bets on the Blackjack game. When the applet starts, give the user $100. Add a JTextField 
to the strip of controls along the bottom of the applet. The user can enter the bet in 
this JTextField. When the game begins, check the amount of the bet. You should do this 
when the game begins, not when it ends, because several errors can occur: The contents 
of the JTextField might not be a legal number. The bet that the user places might be 
more money than the user has, or it might be <= 0. You should detect these errors and 
show an error message instead of starting the game. The user's bet should be an integral 
number of dollars. 

It would be a good idea to make the JTextField uneditable while the game is in progress. 
If betlnput is the JTextField, you can make it editable and uneditable by the user with 
the commands betlnput . setEditable (true) and betlnput . setEditable (false) . 

In the paintComponent () method, you should include commands to display the 
amount of money that the user has left. 

There is one other thing to think about: Ideally, the applet should not start a new 
game when it is first created. The user should have a chance to set a bet amount before 
the game starts. So, in the constructor for the drawing surface class, you should not call

Arrays 



Computers get a lot of their power from working with data structures. A data 
structure is an organized collection of related data. An object is a data structure, but this 
type of data structure — consisting of a fairly small number of named instance variables — is just 
the beginning. In many cases, programmers build complicated data structures by hand, by 
linking objects together. We'll look at these custom-built data structures in Chapter 9. But 
there is one type of data structure that is so important and so basic that it is built into every 
programming language: the array. 

An array is a data structure consisting of a numbered list of items, where all the items are 
of the same type. In Java, the items in an array are always numbered from zero up to some 
maximum value, which is set when the array is created. For example, an array might contain 
100 integers, numbered from zero to 99. The items in an array can belong to one of Java's 
primitive types. They can also be references to objects, so that you could, for example, make 
an array containing all the buttons in a GUI program. 

This chapter discusses how arrays are created and used in Java. It also covers the standard 
class java.util . ArrayList. An object of type ArrayList is very similar to an array of Objects, 
but it can grow to hold any number of items. 

7.1 Creating and Using Arrays 

When a number of data items are chunked together into a unit, the result is a data (online) 
structure. Data structures can be very complex, but in many applications, the appropriate 
data structure consists simply of a sequence of data items. Data structures of this simple variety 
can be either arrays or records. 

The term "record" is not used in Java. A record is essentially the same as a Java object 
that has instance variables only, but no instance methods. Some other languages, which do not 
support objects in general, nevertheless do support records. The C programming language, for 
example, is not object-oriented, but it has records, which in C go by the name "struct." The 
data items in a record — in Java, an object's instance variables — are called the fields of the 
record. Each item is referred to using a field name. In Java, field names are just the names 
of the instance variables. The distinguishing characteristics of a record are that the data items 
in the record are referred to by name and that different fields in a record are allowed to be of 
different types. For example, if the class Person is defined as: 

class Person { 
String name ; 



317 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



318 



int icLmimber ; 
Date birthday; 
int age ; 

} 

then an object of class Person could be considered to be a record with four fields. The field 
names are name, idjiumber, birthday, and age. Note that the fields are of various types: 
String, int, and Date. 

Because records are just a special type of object, I will not discuss them further. 

7.1.1 Arrays 

Like a record, an array is a sequence of items. However, where items in a record are referred 
to by name, the items in an array are numbered, and individual items are referred to by their 
position number. Furthermore, all the items in an array must be of the same type. The 
definition of an array is: a numbered sequence of items, which are all of the same type. The 
number of items in an array is called the length of the array. The position number of an item 
in an array is called the index of that item. The type of the individual items in an array is 
called the base type of the array. 

The base type of an array can be any Java type, that is, one of the primitive types, or a class 
name, or an interface name. If the base type of an array is int, it is referred to as an "array of 
ints." An array with base type String is referred to as an "array of Strings." However, an array 
is not, properly speaking, a list of integers or strings or other values. It is better thought of 
as a list of variables of type int, or a list of variables of type String, or of some other type. As 
always, there is some potential for confusion between the two uses of a variable: as a name for 
a memory location and as a name for the value stored in that memory location. Each position 
in an array acts as a variable. Each position can hold a value of a specified type (the base type 
of the array). The value can be changed at any time. Values are stored in an array. The array 
is the container, not the values. 

The items in an array — really, the individual variables that make up the array — are more 
often referred to as the elements of the array. In Java, the elements in an array are always 
numbered starting from zero. That is, the index of the first element in the array is zero. If the 
length of the array is N, then the index of the last element in the array is N-l. Once an array 
has been created, its length cannot be changed. 

Java arrays are objects. This has several consequences. Arrays are created using a special 
form of the new operator. No variable can ever hold an array; a variable can only refer to an 
array. Any variable that can refer to an array can also hold the value null, meaning that it 
doesn't at the moment refer to anything. Like any object, an array belongs to a class, which like 
all classes is a subclass of the class Object. The elements of the array are, essentially, instance 
variables in the array object, except that they are referred to by number rather than by name. 

Nevertheless, even though arrays are objects, there are differences between arrays and other 
kinds of objects, and there are a number of special language features in Java for creating and 
using arrays. 

7.1.2 Using Arrays 

Suppose that A is a variable that refers to an array. Then the element at index k in A is referred 
to as A[k]. The first element is A[0], the second is A[l], and so forth. "A[k]" is really a 
variable, and it can be used just like any other variable. You can assign values to it, you can 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



319 



use it in expressions, and you can pass it as a parameter to a subroutine. All of this will be 
discussed in more detail below. For now, just keep in mind the syntax 

(array-variable) [ (integei — expression) ] 

for referring to an element of an array. 

Although every array, as an object, belongs to some class, array classes never have to be 
defined. Once a type exists, the corresponding array class exists automatically. If the name 
of the type is BaseType, then the name of the associated array class is BaseType[]. That is 
to say, an object belonging to the class BaseType[] is an array of items, where each item is a 
variable of type BaseType. The brackets, "[]", are meant to recall the syntax for referring to 
the individual items in the array. "BaseType[]" is read as "array of BaseType" or "BaseType 
array." It might be worth mentioning here that if ClassA is a subclass of ClassB, then the class 
ClassA[] is automatically a subclass of ClassB[]. 

The base type of an array can be any legal Java type. From the primitive type int, the 
array type int[] is derived. Each element in an array of type int[] is a variable of type int, which 
holds a value of type int. From a class named Shape, the array type Shape[] is derived. Each 
item in an array of type Shape[] is a variable of type Shape, which holds a value of type Shape. 
This value can be either null or a reference to an object belonging to the class Shape. (This 
includes objects belonging to subclasses of Shape.) 

* * * 

Let's try to get a little more concrete about all this, using arrays of integers as our first 
example. Since int[] is a class, it can be used to declare variables. For example, 

int [] list; 

creates a variable named list of type int[ ]. This variable is capable of referring to an array 
of ints, but initially its value is null (if list is a member variable in a class) or undefined (if 
list is a local variable in a method). The new operator is used to create a new array object, 
which can then be assigned to list. The syntax for using new with arrays is different from the 
syntax you learned previously. As an example, 

list = new int [5] ; 

creates an array of five integers. More generally, the constructor "new BaseType [N] " is used to 
create an array belonging to the class BaseType[]. The value N in brackets specifies the length 
of the array, that is, the number of elements that it contains. Note that the array "knows" 
how long it is. The length of the array is an instance variable in the array object. In fact, the 
length of an array, list, can be referred to as list .length. (However, you are not allowed to 
change the value of list. length, so it's really a "final" instance variable, that is, one whose 
value cannot be changed after it has been initialized.) 

The situation produced by the statement "list = new int [5] ;" can be pictured like this: 



list: 

The statement 
"list = new int[5];" 
creates an array 
that can hold five 
ints, and sets list 
to refer to it. 



(5) 


list . length 





list[ ] 





list[ 1 ] 





list[2 ] 





list[ 3 ] 





list[4] 



The array object contains 
five integers, which are 
referred to as list[0], list[1], 
and so on. It also contains 
list.length, which gives the 
number of items in the array, 
list.length can't be changed. 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



320 



Note that the newly created array of integers is automatically filled with zeros. In Java, a 
newly created array is always filled with a known, default value: zero for numbers, false for 
boolean, the character with Unicode number zero for char, and null for objects. 

The elements in the array, list, are referred to as list [0] , list [1] , list [2] , list [3] , 
and list [4] . (Note again that the index for the last item is one less than list . length.) 
However, array references can be much more general than this. The brackets in an array 
reference can contain any expression whose value is an integer. For example if indx is a 
variable of type int, then list [indx] and list [2*indx+7] are syntactically correct references 
to elements of the array list. Thus, the following loop would print all the integers in the array, 
list, to standard output: 

for (int i = 0; i < list. length; i++) { 
System. out .println( list [i] ); 

} 

The first time through the loop, i is 0, and list[i] refers to list[0]. So, it is the value 
stored in the variable list [0] that is printed. The second time through the loop, i is 1, and 
the value stored in list [1] is printed. The loop ends after printing the value of list [4], 
when i becomes equal to 5 and the continuation condition "i < list. length" is no longer 
true. This is a typical example of using a loop to process an array. I'll discuss more examples 
of array processing throughout this chapter. 

Every use of a variable in a program specifies a memory location. Think for a moment 
about what the computer does when it encounters a reference to an array element, list [k] , 
while it is executing a program. The computer must determine which memory location is being 
referred to. To the computer, list [k] means something like this: "Get the pointer that is 
stored in the variable, list. Follow this pointer to find an array object. Get the value of k. 
Go to the k-th position in the array, and that's the memory location you want." There are two 
things that can go wrong here. Suppose that the value of list is null. If that is the case, 
then list doesn't even refer to an array. The attempt to refer to an element of an array that 
doesn't exist is an error that will cause an exception of type NullPointerException to be thrown. 
The second possible error occurs if list does refer to an array, but the value of k is outside the 
legal range of indices for that array. This will happen if k < or if k >= list . length. This 
is called an "array index out of bounds" error. When an error of this type occurs, an exception 
of type ArraylndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. When you use arrays in a program, you 
should be mindful that both types of error are possible. However, array index out of bounds 
errors are by far the most common error when working with arrays. 

7.1.3 Array Initialization 

For an array variable, just as for any variable, you can declare the variable and initialize it in 
a single step. For example, 

int [] list = new int [5] ; 
If list is a local variable in a subroutine, then this is exactly equivalent to the two statements: 

int [] list; 

list = new int [5] ; 

(If list is an instance variable, then of course you can't simply replace "int [] list = new 
int [5];" with "int [] list; list = new int [5];" since the assignment statement "list = 
new int [5] ;" is only legal inside a subroutine.) 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



321 



The new array is filled with the default value appropriate for the base type of the array — zero 
for int and null for class types, for example. However, Java also provides a way to initialize an 
array variable with a new array filled with a specified list of values. In a declaration statement 
that creates a new array, this is done with an array initializer. For example, 

int[] list = { 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49 }; 

creates a new array containing the seven values 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49, and sets list to 
refer to that new array. The value of list [0] will be 1, the value of list [1] will be 4, and so 
forth. The length of list is seven, since seven values are provided in the initializer. 

An array initializer takes the form of a list of values, separated by commas and enclosed 
between braces. The length of the array does not have to be specified, because it is implicit in 
the list of values. The items in an array initializer don't have to be constants. They can be 
variables or arbitrary expressions, provided that their values are of the appropriate type. For 
example, the following declaration creates an array of eight Colors. Some of the colors are given 
by expressions of the form "new Color (r,g,b)" instead of by constants: 

Color [] palette = { 

Color. BLACK, 
Color .RED, 
Color. PINK, 

new Color (0, 180,0) , // dark green 
Color .GREEN, 
Color .BLUE, 

new Color(180, 180,255) , // light blue 
Color. WHITE 

>; 

A list initializer of this form can be used only in a declaration statement, to give an 
initial value to a newly declared array variable. It cannot be used in an assignment statement 
to assign a value to a variable that has been previously declared. However, there is another, 
similar notation for creating a new array that can be used in an assignment statement or passed 
as a parameter to a subroutine. The notation uses another form of the new operator to both 
create and initialize a new array object at the same time. (The rather odd syntax is similar to 
the syntax for anonymous classes, which were discussed in Subsection 5.7.3.) For example to 
assign a new value to an array variable, list, that was declared previously, you could use: 

list = new int [] { 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343 }; 

The general syntax for this form of the new operator is 

new (base-type) [ ] { (list-of -values) } 

This is actually an expression whose value is a reference to a newly created array object. This 
means that it can be used in any context where an object of type (base-type) [] is expected. 
For example, if makeButtons is a method that takes an array of Strings as a parameter, you 
could say: 

makeButtons ( new StringG { "Stop", "Go", "Next", "Previous" } ); 

Being able to create and use an array "in place" in this way can be very convenient, in the 
same way that anonymous nested classes are convenient. 

By the way, it is perfectly legal to use the "new BaseType [] { ... }" syntax instead of 
the array initializer syntax in the declaration of an array variable. For example, instead of 
saying: 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



322 



int[] primes = { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 }; 

you can say, equivalently, 

int [] primes = new int [] { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19 }; 

In fact, rather than use a special notation that works only in the context of declaration state- 
ments, I prefer to use the second form. 

* * * 

One final note: For historical reasons, an array declaration such as 
int [] list; 
can also be written as 
int list [] ; 

which is a syntax used in the languages C and C++. However, this alternative syntax does not 
really make much sense in the context of Java, and it is probably best avoided. After all, the 
intent is to declare a variable of a certain type, and the name of that type is "int[]". It makes 
sense to follow the 11 (type-name) (variable-name);" syntax for such declarations. 

7.2 Programming With Arrays 

Arrays are the most basic and the most important type of data structure, and tech- (online) 
niques for processing arrays are among the most important programming techniques you can 
learn. Two fundamental array processing techniques — searching and sorting — will be covered 
in Section 7.4. This section introduces some of the basic ideas of array processing in general. 

7.2.1 Arrays and for Loops 

In many cases, processing an array means applying the same operation to each item in the 
array. This is commonly done with a for loop. A loop for processing all the elements of an 
array A has the form: 

// do any necessary initialization 
for (int i = 0; i < A. length; i++) { 
. . . // process A[i] 

} 

Suppose, for example, that A is an array of type double[]. Suppose that the goal is to add 
up all the numbers in the array. An informal algorithm for doing this would be: 

Start with sum = ; 

Add A[0] to sum; (process the first item in A) 
Add A[l] to sum; (process the second item in A) 



Add A[ A. length - 1 ] to sum; (process the last item in A) 
Putting the obvious repetition into a loop, this becomes: 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



323 



double sum; // The sum of the numbers in A. 

sum =0; // Start with 0. 

for (int i = 0; i < A. length; i++) 

sum += A[i] ; // add A[i] to the sum, for 

// i = 0, 1, A. length - 1 

Note that the continuation condition, "i < A. length", implies that the last value of i that 
is actually processed is A. length- 1, which is the index of the final item in the array. It's 
important to use "<" here, not "<=", since "<=" would give an array index out of bounds error. 
There is no element at position A . length in A. 

Eventually, you should just about be able to write loops similar to this one in your sleep. 
I will give a few more simple examples. Here is a loop that will count the number of items in 
the array A which are less than zero: 

int count; // For counting the items, 
count =0; // Start with items counted, 
for (int i = 0; i < A. length; i++) { 

if (A[i] < 0.0) //if this item is less than zero... 
count++; // . . .then count it 

} 

// At this point, the value of count is the number 
// of items that have passed the test of being < 

Replace the test "A[i] < 0.0", if you want to count the number of items in an array that 
satisfy some other property. Here is a variation on the same theme. Suppose you want to count 
the number of times that an item in the array A is equal to the item that follows it. The item 
that follows A[i] in the array is A[i+1], so the test in this case is "if (A[i] == A[i+1])". 
But there is a catch: This test cannot be applied when A [i] is the last item in the array, since 
then there is no such item as A [i+1] . The result of trying to apply the test in this case would 
be an ArraylndexOutOfBoundsException. This just means that we have to stop one item short 
of the final item: 

int count = ; 

for (int i = 0; i < A. length - 1; i++) { 
if (A[i] == A [i+1]) 
count++; 

} 

Another typical problem is to find the largest number in A. The strategy is to go through 
the array, keeping track of the largest number found so far. We'll store the largest number 
found so far in a variable called max. As we look through the array, whenever we find a number 
larger than the current value of max, we change the value of max to that larger value. After the 
whole array has been processed, max is the largest item in the array overall. The only question 
is, what should the original value of max be? One possibility is to start with max equal to A [0] , 
and then to look through the rest of the array, starting from A[l] , for larger items: 

double max = A [0] ; 

for (int i = 1; i < A. length; i++) { 
if (A[i] > max) 
max = A [i] ; 

} 

// at this point, max is the largest item in A 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



324 



(There is one subtle problem here. It's possible in Java for an array to have length zero. In 
that case, A [0] doesn't exist, and the reference to A [0] in the first line gives an array index out 
of bounds error. However, zero-length arrays are normally something that you want to avoid 
in real problems. Anyway, what would it mean to ask for the largest item in an array that 
contains no items at all?) 

As a final example of basic array operations, consider the problem of copying an array. To 
make a copy of our sample array A, it is not sufficient to say 

doubled B = A; 

since this does not create a new array object. All it does is declare a new array variable and 
make it refer to the same object to which A refers. (So that, for example, a change to A [i] will 
automatically change B[i] as well.) Remember that arrays are objects, and array variables 
hold pointers to objects; the assignment B = A just copies a pointer. To make a new array that 
is a copy of A, it is necessary to make a new array object and to copy each of the individual 
items from A into the new array: 

doubled B = new double [A. length] ; // Make a new array object, 

// the same size as A. 

for (int i = 0; i < A. length; i++) 

B[i] = A[i] ; // Copy each item from A to B. 

Copying values from one array to another is such a common operation that Java has a 
predefined subroutine to do it. The subroutine, System. arraycopyQ , is a static method in 
the standard System class. Its declaration has the form 

public static void arraycopy (Object sourceArray, int sourceStartlndex, 
Object destArray, int destStartlndex, int count) 

where sourceArray and destArray can be arrays with any base type. Values are copied from 
sourceArray to destArray. The count tells how many elements to copy. Values are taken from 
sourceArray starting at position sourceStartlndex and are stored in destArray starting at 
position destStartlndex. For example, to make a copy of the array, A, using this subroutine, 
you would say: 

double B = new double [A . length] ; 

System. arraycopy ( A, 0, B, 0, A. length ); 

7.2.2 Arrays and for-each Loops 

Java 5.0 introduced a new form of the for loop, the "for-each loop" that was discussed in 
Subsection 3.4.4. The for-each loop is meant specifically for processing all the values in a data 
structure. When used to process an array, a for-each loop can be used to perform the same 
operation on each value that is stored in the array. If anArray is an array of type BaseType[], 
then a for-each loop for anArray has the form: 

for ( BaseType item : anArray ) { 
// process the item 



} 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



325 



In this loop, item is the loop control variable. It is being declared as a variable of type BaseType, 
where BaseType is the base type of the array. (In a for-each loop, the loop control variable must 
be declared in the loop.) When this loop is executed, each value from the array is assigned 
to item in turn and the body of the loop is executed for each value. Thus, the above loop is 
exactly equivalent to: 

for ( int index = 0; index < anArray. length; index++ ) { 
BaseType item; 

item = anArray [index] ; // Get one of the values from the array 
// process the item 

} 

For example, if A is an array of type int[], then we could print all the values from A with 
the for-each loop: 

for ( int item : A ) 

System. out .println( item ); 

and we could add up all the positive integers in A with: 

int sum =0; // This will be the sum of all the positive numbers in A 
for ( int item : A ) { 
if (item > 0) 

sum = sum + item; 

} 

The for-each loop is not always appropriate. For example, there is no simple way to use it 
to process the items in just a part of an array. However, it does make it a little easier to process 
all the values in an array, since it eliminates any need to use array indices. 

It's important to note that a for-each loop processes the values in the array, not the 
elements (where an element means the actual memory location that is part of the array). For 
example, consider the following incorrect attempt to fill an array of integers with 17's: 

int [] intList = new int [10]; 

for ( int item : intList ) { // INCORRECT! DOES NOT MODIFY THE ARRAY! 
item = 17; 

} 

The assignment statement item = 17 assigns the value 17 to the loop control variable, item. 
However, this has nothing to do with the array. When the body of the loop is executed, the 
value from one of the elements of the array is copied into item. The statement item = 17 
replaces that copied value but has no effect on the array element from which it was copied; the 
value in the array is not changed. 

7.2.3 Array Types in Subroutines 

Any array type, such as double[], is a full-fledged Java type, so it can be used in all the ways 
that any other Java type can be used. In particular, it can be used as the type of a formal 
parameter in a subroutine. It can even be the return type of a function. For example, it might 
be useful to have a function that makes a copy of an array of double: 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



326 



/** 

* Create a new array of doubles that is a copy of a given array. 

* @param source the array that is to be copied; the value can be null 

* Sreturn a copy of source; if source is null, then the return value is also null 
*/ 

public static doubled copy( double [] source ) { 
if ( source == null ) 

return null ; 
doubled cpy; //A copy of the source array, 
cpy = new double [source . length] ; 

System. arraycopy( source, 0, cpy, 0, source . length ); 
return cpy; 

} 

The main() routine of a program has a parameter of type String[]. You've seen this used 
since all the way back in Section 2.1, but I haven't really been able to explain it until now. 
The parameter to the main ( ) routine is an array of Strings. When the system calls the main ( ) 
routine, it passes an actual array of strings, which becomes the value of this parameter. Where 
do the strings come from? The strings in the array are the command-line arguments from 
the command that was used to run the program. When using a command-line interface, the user 
types a command to tell the system to execute a program. The user can include extra input in 
this command, beyond the name of the program. This extra input becomes the command-line 
arguments. For example, if the name of the class that contains the main() routine is myProg, 
then the user can type "java myProg" to execute the program. In this case, there are no 
command- line arguments. But if the user types the command 

java myProg one two three 

then the command-line arguments are the strings "one" , "two" , and "three" . The system puts 
these strings into an array of Strings and passes that array as a parameter to the mainQ routine. 
Here, for example, is a short program that simply prints out any command line arguments 
entered by the user: 

public class CLDemo { 

public static void main(String [] args) { 

System. out .printlnC'You entered " + args. length 

+ " command-line arguments"); 

if (args. length > 0) { 

System. out .printlnO'They were : " ) ; 
for (int i = 0; i < args. length; i++) 
System, out .printlnC " + args[i]); 

} 

} // end mainO 
} // end class CLDemo 

Note that the parameter, args, is never null when main() is called by the system, but it might 
be an array of length zero. 

In practice, command-line arguments are often the names of files to be processed by the 
program. I will give some examples of this in Chapter 11, when I discuss file processing.

7.2.4 Random Access 

So far, all my examples of array processing have used sequential access. That is, the elements 
of the array were processed one after the other in the sequence in which they occur in the array. 
But one of the big advantages of arrays is that they allow random access. That is, every 
element of the array is equally accessible at any given time. 

As an example, let's look at a well-known problem called the birthday problem: Suppose 
that there are N people in a room. What's the chance that there are two people in the room 
who have the same birthday? (That is, they were born on the same day in the same month, 
but not necessarily in the same year.) Most people severely underestimate the probability. We 
will actually look at a different version of the question: Suppose you choose people at random 
and check their birthdays. How many people will you check before you find one who has the 
same birthday as someone you've already checked? Of course, the answer in a particular case 
depends on random factors, but we can simulate the experiment with a computer program and 
run the program several times to get an idea of how many people need to be checked on average. 

To simulate the experiment, we need to keep track of each birthday that we find. There are 
365 different possible birthdays. (We'll ignore leap years.) For each possible birthday, we need 
to keep track of whether or not we have already found a person who has that birthday. The 
answer to this question is a boolean value, true or false. To hold the data for all 365 possible 
birthdays, we can use an array of 365 boolean values: 

boolean [] used; 

used = new boolean [365] ; 

The days of the year are numbered from to 364. The value of used [i] is true if someone 
has been selected whose birthday is day number i. Initially, all the values in the array, used, 
are false. When we select someone whose birthday is day number i, we first check whether 
used[i] is true. If it is true, then this is the second person with that birthday. We are done. If 
used[i] is false, we set used[i] to be true to record the fact that we've encountered someone 
with that birthday, and we go on to the next person. Here is a subroutine that carries out 
the simulated experiment (of course, in the subroutine, there are no simulated people, only 
simulated birthdays): 

/** 

* Simulate choosing people at random and checking the day of the year they 

* were born on. If the birthday is the same as one that was seen previously, 

* stop, and output the number of people who were checked. 
*/ 

private static void birthdayProblemO ■{ 

boolean [] used; // For recording the possible birthdays 

// that have been seen so far. A value 
// of true in used[i] means that a person 
// whose birthday is the i-th day of the 
// year has been found. 

int count; // The number of people who have been checked. 

used = new boolean [365] ; // Initially, all entries are false. 

count = 0; 

while (true) { 

// Select a birthday at random, from to 364. 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



328 



//If the birthday has already been used, quit. 

// Otherwise, record the birthday as used, 
int birthday; // The selected birthday, 
birthday = (int) (Math. randomO *365) ; 
count++; 

if ( used [birthday] ) // This day was found before; It's a duplicate. 

break; 
used [birthday] = true ; 

} 

System. out .println( "A duplicate birthday was found after " 

+ count + " tries."); 

} // end birthdayProblemO 

This subroutine makes essential use of the fact that every element in a newly created array of 
boolean is set to be false. If we wanted to reuse the same array in a second simulation, we 
would have to reset all the elements in it to be false with a for loop: 

for (int i = 0; i < 365; i++) 
used[i] = false; 

The sample program that uses this subroutine is BirthdayProblemDemo.java. An applet 
version of the program can be found in the online version of this section. 

7.2.5 Arrays of Objects 

One of the examples in Subsection 6.4.2 was an applet that shows multiple copies of a message 
in random positions, colors, and fonts. When the user clicks on the applet, the positions, colors, 
and fonts are changed to new random values. Like several other examples from that chapter, 
the applet had a flaw: It didn't have any way of storing the data that would be necessary to 
redraw itself. Arrays provide us with one possible solution to this problem. We can write a new 
version of the RandomStrings applet that uses an array to store the position, font, and color of 
each string. When the content pane of the applet is painted, this information is used to draw 
the strings, so the applet will paint itself correctly whenever it has to be redrawn. When the 
user clicks on the applet, the array is filled with new random values and the applet is repainted 
using the new data. So, the only time that the picture will change is in response to a mouse 
click. 

In this applet, the number of copies of the message is given by a named constant, 
MESSAGE_C0UNT. One way to store the position, color, and font of MESSAGE_C0UNT strings would 
be to use four arrays: 

int [] x = new int [MESSAGE_C0UNT] ; 
int [] y = new int [MESSAGE_C0UNT] ; 
Color [] color = new Color [MESSAGE.COUNT] ; 
Font [] font = new Font [MESSAGE_C0UNT] ; 

These arrays would be filled with random values. In the paintComponent () method, the i-th 
copy of the string would be drawn at the point (x[i] ,y[i]). Its color would be given by 
color [i] . And it would be drawn in the font font[i]. This would be accomplished by the 
paintComponent () method 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



329 



public void paintComponent (Graphics g) { 

super. paintComponentO ; // (Fill with background color.) 
for (int i = 0; i < MESSAGE_C0UNT ; i++) { 

g.setColor( color [i] ); 

g.setFont( font[i] ); 

g.drawString( message, x[i], y[i] ); 

} 

} 

This approach is said to use parallel arrays. The data for a given copy of the message is 
spread out across several arrays. If you think of the arrays as laid out in parallel columns — 
array x in the first column, array y in the second, array color in the third, and array font 
in the fourth — then the data for the i-th string can be found along the i-th row. There is 
nothing wrong with using parallel arrays in this simple example, but it does go against the 
object-oriented philosophy of keeping related data in one object. If we follow this rule, then we 
don't have to imagine the relationship among the data, because all the data for one copy of 
the message is physically in one place. So, when I wrote the applet, I made a simple class to 
represent all the data that is needed for one copy of the message: 

/** 

* An object of this type holds the position, color, and font 

* of one copy of the string. 
*/ 

private static class StringData { 

int x, y; // The coordinates of the left end of baseline of string. 

Color color; // The color in which the string is drawn. 
Font font; // The font that is used to draw the string. 

} 

(This class is actually defined as a static nested class in the main applet class.) To store the data 
for multiple copies of the message, I use an array of type StringData[ ]. The array is declared 
as an instance variable, with the name StringData: 

StringData [] StringData; 

Of course, the value of StringData is null until an actual array is created and assigned to it. 
This is done in the init() method of the applet with the statement 

StringData = new StringData [MESSAGE_C0UNT] ; 

The base type of this array is StringData, which is a class. We say that StringData is an array 
of objects. This means that the elements of the array are variables of type StringData. Like 
any object variable, each element of the array can either be null or can hold a reference to an 
object. (Note that the term "array of objects" is a little misleading, since the objects are not 
in the array; the array can only contain references to objects.) When the StringData array is 
first created, the value of each element in the array is null. 

The data needed by the RandomStrings program will be stored in objects of type StringData, 
but no such objects exist yet. All we have so far is an array of variables that are capable of 
referring to such objects. I decided to create the StringData objects in the applet's init method. 
(It could be done in other places — just so long as we avoid trying to use an object that doesn't 
exist. This is important: Remember that a newly created array whose base type is an object 
type is always filled with null elements. There are no objects in the array until you put them 
there.) The objects are created with the for loop 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



330 



for (int i = 0; i < MESSAGE.COUNT ; i++) 
stringData[i] = new StringDataO ; 

For the RandomStrings applet, the idea is to store data for the i-th copy of the 
message in the variables stringData[i] . x, stringData [i] .y, stringData[i] . color, and 
stringData [i] .font. Make sure that you understand the notation here: stringData [i] 
refers to an object. That object contains instance variables. The notation stringData [i] .x 
tells the computer: "Find your way to the object that is referred to by stringData [i] . Then 
go to the instance variable named x in that object." Variable names can get even more com- 
plicated than this, so it is important to learn how to read them. Using the array, stringData, 
the paintComponent () method for the applet could be written 

public void paintComponent (Graphics g) { 

super .paintComponent (g) ; // (Fill with background color.) 
for (int i = 0; i < MESSAGE_C0UNT ; i++) { 

g.setColor( stringData [i] .color ); 

g.setFont( stringData [i] . font ); 

g.drawString( message, stringData[i] .x, stringData [i] . y ); 

} 

} 

However, since the for loop is processing every value in the array, an alternative would be to 
use a for-each loop: 

public void paintComponent (Graphics g) { 
super . paintComponent (g) ; 
for ( StringData data : stringData) { 

// Draw a copy of the message in the position, color, 
// and font stored in data. 
g.setColor( data. color ); 
g.setFont( data. font ); 

g.drawString( message, data.x, data.y ); 

} 

} 

In this loop, the loop control variable, data, holds a copy of one of the values from the array. 
That value is a reference to an object of type StringData, which has instance variables named 
color, font, x, and y. Once again, the use of a for-each loop has eliminated the need to work 
with array indices. 

There is still the matter of filling the array, data, with random values. If you are interested, 
you can look at the source code for the applet, RandomStrings WithArray.java. 

* * * 

The RandomStrings applet uses one other array of objects. The font for a given copy of 
the message is chosen at random from a set of five possible fonts. In the original version of the 
applet, there were five variables of type Font to represent the fonts. The variables were named 
fontl, f ont2, f ont3, font4, and font5. To select one of these fonts at random, a switch 
statement could be used: 

Font randomFont ; // One of the 5 fonts, chosen at random, 
int rand; // A random integer in the range to 4. 

rand = (int) (Math. random () * 5); 
switch (rand) { 
case 0: 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



331 



randomFont = fontl; 

break; 
case 1: 

randomFont = font2; 

break; 
case 2: 

randomFont = font3; 

break; 
case 3: 

randomFont = font4; 

break; 
case 4: 

randomFont = font5; 

break; 

} 

In the new version of the applet, the five fonts are stored in an array, which is named fonts. 
This array is declared as an instance variable of type Font[] 

Font [] fonts; 

The array is created in the init() method of the applet, and each element of the array is set 
to refer to a new Font object: 

fonts = new Font [5] ; // Create the array to hold the five fonts. 

fonts [0] = new Font ("Serif " , Font. BOLD, 14); 

fonts [1] = new FontC'SansSerif " , Font. BOLD + Font. ITALIC, 24); 
fonts [2] = new Font ( "Monospaced" , Font. PLAIN, 20); 
fonts [3] = new Font ( "Dialog" , Font. PLAIN, 30); 
fonts [4] = new Font ("Serif " , Font. ITALIC, 36); 

This makes it much easier to select one of the fonts at random. It can be done with the 
statements 

Font randomFont; // One of the 5 fonts, chosen at random, 
int font Index; // A random number in the range to 4. 
fontlndex = (int) (Math. random () * 5); 
randomFont = fonts [ fontlndex ]; 

The switch statement has been replaced by a single line of code. In fact, the preceding four 
lines could be replaced by the single line: 

Font randomFont = fonts [ (int) (Math. random () * 5) ] ; 

This is a very typical application of arrays. Note that this example uses the random access 
property of arrays: We can pick an array index at random and go directly to the array element 
at that index. 

Here is another example of the same sort of thing. Months are often stored as numbers 1, 2, 
3, . . . , 12. Sometimes, however, these numbers have to be translated into the names January, 
February, . . . , December. The translation can be done with an array. The array can be declared 
and initialized as 

static Stringf] monthName = { "January", "February", "March", 

"April", "May", "June", 

" July " , " August " , " Sept ember " , 

"October", "November", "December" }; 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



332 



If mnth is a variable that holds one of the integers 1 through 12, then monthName [mnth-1] is the 
name of the corresponding month. We need the because months are numbered starting 
from 1, while array elements are numbered starting from 0. Simple array indexing does the 
translation for us! 

7.2.6 Variable Arity Methods 

Arrays are used in the implementation of a feature that was introduced in Java 5.0. Before 
version 5.0, every method in Java had a fixed arity. (The arity of a subroutine is defined 
as the number of parameters in a call to the method.) In a fixed arity method, the number 
of parameters must be the same in every call to the method. Java 5.0 introduced variable 
arity methods. In a variable arity method, different calls to the method can have differ- 
ent numbers of parameters. For example, the formatted output method System. out .printf, 
which was introduced in Subsection 2.4.4, is a variable arity method. The first parameter of 
System. out .printf must be a String, but it can have any number of additional parameters, of 
any types. 

Calling a variable arity method is no different from calling any other sort of method, but 
writing one requires some new syntax. As an example, consider a method that can compute 
the average of any number of values of type double. The definition of such a method could 
begin with: 

public static double average ( double... numbers ) { 

Here, the . . . after the type name, double, indicates that any number of values of type 
double can be provided when the subroutine is called, so that for example average (1,4,9,16), 
average(3. 14,2. 17), average (0 . 375) , and even averageO are all legal calls to this method. 
Note that actual parameters of type int can be passed to average. The integers will, as usual, 
be automatically converted to real numbers. 

When the method is called, the values of all the actual parameters that correspond to the 
variable arity parameter are placed into an array, and it is this array that is actually passed to 
the method. That is, in the body of a method, a variable arity parameter of type T actually 
looks like an ordinary parameter of type T[]. The length of the array tells you how many 
actual parameters were provided in the method call. In the average example, the body of the 
method would see an array named numbers of type double[]. The number of actual parameters 
in the method call would be numbers . length, and the values of the actual parameters would 
be numbers [0] , numbers [1] , and so on. A complete definition of the method would be: 

public static double average ( double... numbers ) { 

double sum; // The sum of all the actual parameters, 

double average; // The average of all the actual parameters, 
sum = ; 

for (int i = 0; i < numbers . length; i++) { 

sum = sum + numbers [i] ; // Add one of the actual parameters to the sum. 

} 

average = sum / numbers . length; 
return average ; 

} 

Note that the " . . . " can be applied only to the last formal parameter in a method definition. 
Note also that it is possible to pass an actual array to the method, instead of a list of individual 
values. For example, if salesData is a variable of type double[], then it would be legal to call 
average (salesData) , and this would compute the average of all the numbers in the array. 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



333 



As another example, consider a method that can draw a polygon through any number of 
points. The points are given as values of type Point, where an object of type Point has two 
instance variables, x and y, of type int. In this case, the method has one ordinary parameter — 
the graphics context that will be used to draw the polygon — in addition to the variable arity 
parameter: 

public static void drawPolygon (Graphics g, Point... points) { 

if (points . length > 1) { // (Need at least 2 points to draw anything.) 
for (int i = 0; i < points . length - 1; i++) { 

// Draw a line from i-th point to (i+l)-th point 

g.drawLine( points [i] .x, points [i].y, points [i+1] .x, points [i+1] . y ); 

} 

// Now, draw a line back to the starting point. 

g.drawLine( points [points . length-1] .x, points [points . length-1] .y, 
points [0] .x, points [0].y ); 

> 

} 

Because of automatic type conversion, a variable arity parameter of type "Object ..." can 
take actual parameters of any type whatsoever. Even primitive type values are allowed, because 
of autoboxing. (A primitive type value belonging to a type such as int is converted to an object 
belonging to a "wrapper" class such as Integer. See Subsection 5.3.2.) For example, the method 
definition for System, out .printf could begin: 

public void printf (String format, Object... values) { 

This allows the printf method to output values of any type. Similarly, we could write a method 
that strings together the string representations of all its parameters into one long string: 

public static String concat( Object... values ) { 

StringBuffer buffer; // Use a StringBuffer for more efficient concatenation, 
buffer = new StringBuf f er() ; // Start with an empty buffer. 

for ( Object obj : values ) { // A "for each" loop for processing the values, 
buf fer . append (obj ) ; // Add string representation of obj to the buffer. 

} 

return buf f er . toStringO ; // return the contents of the buffer 

} 



7.3 Dynamic Arrays and ArrayLists 

The size of an array is fixed when it is created. In many cases, however, the number of data (online) 

items that are actually stored in the array varies with time. Consider the following examples: 

An array that stores the lines of text in a word-processing program. An array that holds the list 

of computers that are currently downloading a page from a Web site. An array that contains 

the shapes that have been added to the screen by the user of a drawing program. Clearly, we 

need some way to deal with cases where the number of data items in an array is not fixed. 

7.3.1 Partially Full Arrays 

Consider an application where the number of items that we want to store in an array changes 
as the program runs. Since the size of the array can't actually be changed, a separate counter 
variable must be used to keep track of how many spaces in the array are in use. (Of course, 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



334 



every space in the array has to contain something; the question is, how many spaces contain 
useful or valid items?) 

Consider, for example, a program that reads positive integers entered by the user and stores 
them for later processing. The program stops reading when the user inputs a number that is 
less than or equal to zero. The input numbers can be kept in an array, numbers, of type int[ ]. 
Let's say that no more than 100 numbers will be input. Then the size of the array can be fixed 
at 100. But the program must keep track of how many numbers have actually been read and 
stored in the array. For this, it can use an integer variable, numCount. Each time a number is 
stored in the array, numCount must be incremented by one. As a rather silly example, let's write 
a program that will read the numbers input by the user and then print them in the reverse of 
the order in which they were entered. (This is, at least, a processing task that requires that 
the numbers be saved in an array. Remember that many types of processing, such as finding 
the sum or average or maximum of the numbers, can be done without saving the individual 
numbers.) 

public class ReverselnputNumbers { 

public static void main (String [] args) { 

int [] numbers; // An array for storing the input values, 
int numCount; // The number of numbers saved in the array, 
int num; // One of the numbers input by the user. 

numbers = new int [100]; // Space for 100 ints. 

numCount = ; //No numbers have been saved yet . 

TextlO.putlnC'Enter up to 100 positive integers; enter to end."); 

while (true) { // Get the numbers and put them in the array. 
TextI0.put("? "); 
num = TextID . getlnlnt () ; 
if (num <= 0) 
break; 

numbers [numCount] = num; 
numCount++ ; 

} 

TextI0.putln("\nYour numbers in reverse order are:\n"); 

for (int i = numCount - 1; i >= 0; i — ) { 
TextID. putln( numbers [i] ); 

} 

} // end mainO ; 

} // end class ReverselnputNumbers 

It is especially important to note that the variable numCount plays a dual role. It is the 
number of items that have been entered into the array. But it is also the index of the next 
available spot in the array. For example, if 4 numbers have been stored in the array, they 
occupy locations number 0, 1, 2, and 3. The next available spot is location 4. When the time 
comes to print out the numbers in the array, the last occupied spot in the array is location 
numCount - 1, so the for loop prints out values starting from location numCount - 1 and 
going down to 0. 

Let's look at another, more realistic example. Suppose that you write a game program, and 
that players can join the game and leave the game as it progresses. As a good object-oriented 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



335 



programmer, you probably have a class named Player to represent the individual players in 
the game. A list of all players who are currently in the game could be stored in an array, 
playerList, of type Player[]. Since the number of players can change, you will also need a 
variable, playerCt, to record the number of players currently in the game. Assuming that there 
will never be more than 10 players in the game, you could declare the variables as: 

Player [] playerList = new Player [10]; // Up to 10 players, 
int playerCt =0; //At the start, there are no players. 

After some players have joined the game, playerCt will be greater than 0, and 
the player objects representing the players will be stored in the array elements 
playerList [0] , playerList [1] , . . . , playerList [playerCt-1] . Note that the array element 
playerList [playerCt] is not in use. The procedure for adding a new player, newPlayer, to 
the game is simple: 

playerList [playerCt] = newPlayer; // Put new player in next 

// available spot. 

playerCt ++ ; / / And increment playerCt to count the new player . 

Deleting a player from the game is a little harder, since you don't want to leave a "hole" 
in the array. Suppose you want to delete the player at index k in playerList. If you are not 
worried about keeping the players in any particular order, then one way to do this is to move 
the player from the last occupied position in the array into position k and then to decrement 
the value of playerCt: 

playerList [k] = playerList [playerCt - 1] ; 
playerCt — ; 

The player previously in position k is no longer in the array. The player previously in position 
playerCt - 1 is now in the array twice. But it's only in the occupied or valid part of the array 
once, since playerCt has decreased by one. Remember that every element of the array has to 
hold some value, but only the values in positions through playerCt - 1 will be looked at or 
processed in any way. (By the way, you should think about what happens if the player that 
is being deleted is in the last position in the list. The code does still work in this case. What 
exactly happens?) 

Suppose that when deleting the player in position k, you'd like to keep the remaining players 
in the same order. (Maybe because they take turns in the order in which they are stored in the 
array.) To do this, all the players in positions k+1 and above must move down one position in 
the array. Player k+1 replaces player k, who is out of the game. Player k+2 fills the spot left 
open when player k+1 is moved. And so on. The code for this is 

for (int i = k+1; i < playerCt; i++) { 
playerList [i-1] = playerList [i] ; 

} 

playerCt — ; 

* * * 

It's worth emphasizing that the Player example deals with an array whose base type is a 
class. An item in the array is either null or is a reference to an object belonging to the class, 
Player. The Player objects themselves are not really stored in the array, only references to 
them. Note that because of the rules for assignment in Java, the objects can actually belong to 
subclasses of Player. Thus there could be different classes of players such as computer players, 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



336 



regular human players, players who are wizards, . . . , all represented by different subclasses of 
Player. 

As another example, suppose that a class Shape represents the general idea of a shape 
drawn on a screen, and that it has subclasses to represent specific types of shapes such as 
lines, rectangles, rounded rectangles, ovals, filled-in ovals, and so forth. (Shape itself would be 
an abstract class, as discussed in Subsection 5.5.5.) Then an array of type Shape[] can hold 
references to objects belonging to the subclasses of Shape. For example, the situation created 
by the statements 

Shaped shapes = new Shape [100]; // Array to hold up to 100 shapes. 
shapes[0] = new RectO; // Put some objects in the array. 

shapes[l] = new LineO; 
shapes [2] = new FilledOval () ; 

int shapeCt =3; // Keep track of number of objects in array, 
could be illustrated as: 




shapes: 



shapes . length 
shapes [ ] 
shapes [ 1 ] 
shapes [ 2 ] 
shapes [ 3 ] 
shapes [ 4 ] 




object of 
class FilledOval 



Such an array would be useful in a drawing program. The array could be used to hold a list 
of shapes to be displayed. If the Shape class includes a method, "void redraw (Graphics g)", 
for drawing the shape in a graphics context g, then all the shapes in the array could be redrawn 
with a simple for loop: 

for (int i = 0; i < shapeCt; i++) 
shapes [i] . redraw (g) ; 

The statement "shapes [i] .redraw(g) ;" calls the redrawO method belonging to the partic- 
ular shape at index i in the array. Each object knows how to redraw itself, so that repeated 
executions of the statement can produce a variety of different shapes on the screen. This is nice 
example both of polymorphism and of array processing. 

7.3.2 Dynamic Arrays 

In each of the above examples, an arbitrary limit was set on the number of items — 100 ints, 10 
Players, 100 Shapes. Since the size of an array is fixed, a given array can only hold a certain 
maximum number of items. In many cases, such an arbitrary limit is undesirable. Why should 
a program work for 100 data values, but not for 101? The obvious alternative of making an 
array that's so big that it will work in any practical case is not usually a good solution to the 
problem. It means that in most lot of computer memory will be wasted on unused space 

in the array. That memory might be better used for something else. And what if someone is 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



337 



using a computer that could handle as many data values as the user actually wants to process, 
but doesn't have enough memory to accommodate all the extra space that you've allocated for 
your huge array? 

Clearly, it would be nice if we could increase the size of an array at will. This is not possible, 
but what is possible is almost as good. Remember that an array variable does not actually 
hold an array. It just holds a reference to an array object. We can't make the array bigger, 
but we can make a new, bigger array object and change the value of the array variable so that 
it refers to the bigger array. Of course, we also have to copy the contents of the old array into 
the new array. The array variable then refers to an array object that contains all the data of 
the old array, with room for additional data. The old array will be garbage collected, since it 
is no longer in use. 

Let's look back at the game example, in which playerList is an array of type Player[] and 
playerCt is the number of spaces that have been used in the array. Suppose that we don't 
want to put a pre-set limit on the number of players. If a new player joins the game and the 
current array is full, we just make a new, bigger one. The same variable, playerList, will refer 
to the new array. Note that after this is done, playerList [0] will refer to a different memory 
location, but the value stored in playerList [0] will still be the same as it was before. Here is 
some code that will do this: 

// Add a new player, even if the current array is full. 

if (playerCt == playerList . length) { 

// Array is full. Make a new, bigger array, 

// copy the contents of the old array into it, 

// and set playerList to refer to the new array, 
int newSize = 2 * playerList . length; // Size of new array. 
Player [] temp = new Player [newSize] ; // The new array. 
System. arraycopy (playerList, 0, temp, 0, playerList . length) ; 
playerList = temp; // Set playerList to refer to new array. 

} 

// At this point, we KNOW there is room in the array. 

playerList [playerCt] = newPlayer; // Add the new player... 
playerCt ++; // ...and count it. 

If we are going to be doing things like this regularly, it would be nice to define a reusable 
class to handle the details. An array-like object that changes size to accommodate the amount 
of data that it actually contains is called a dynamic array. A dynamic array supports the 
same operations as an array: putting a value at a given position and getting the value that is 
stored at a given position. But there is no upper limit on the positions that can be used (except 
those imposed by the size of the computer's memory). In a dynamic array class, the put and 
get operations must be implemented as instance methods. Here, for example, is a class that 
implements a dynamic array of ints: 

/** 

* An object of type DynamicArrayOf Int acts like an array of int 

* of unlimited size. The notation A.get(i) must be used instead 

* of A[i], and A.set(i,v) must be used instead of A[i] = v. 
*/ 

public class DynamicArrayOf Int { 

private int [] data; // An array to hold the data. 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS

/**

* but the array size will be increased whenever a reference 

* is made to an array position that does not yet exist. 
*/ 

public Dynami c Array Of Int () { 
data = new int [1] ;

public int get (int position) { 
if (position >= data. length) 

return ;

return data [position] ;

// The specified position is outside the actual size of 
// the data array. Double the size, or if that still does 
// not include the specified position, set the new size 
// to 2*position. 
int newSize = 2 * data. length; 
if (position >= newSize) 

newSize = 2 * position; 
int [] newData = new int [newSize] ; 

System. arraycopy (data, 0, newData, 0, data. length) ;

// The following line is for demonstration purposes only !! 
System. out .printlnC'Size of dynamic array increased to " + newSize); 

} 

data [position] = value; 

} 

} // end class Dynamic Array Of Int 

The data in a DynamicArrayOflnt object is actually stored in a regular array, but that array 
is discarded and replaced by a bigger array whenever necessary. If numbers is a variable of 
type DynamicArrayOflnt, then the command numbers .put (pos ,val) stores the value val at 
position number pos in the dynamic array. The function numbers .get (pos) returns the value 
stored at position number pos. 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



339 



The first example in this section used an array to store positive integers input by the 
user. We can rewrite that example to use a DynamicArrayOflnt. A reference to numbers [i] 
is replaced by numbers. get (i). The statement "numbers [numCount] = num;" is replaced by 
"numbers . put (numCount , num) ; " . Here's the program: 

public class ReverseWithDynamicArray { 

public static void main (String [] args) { 

DynamicArrayOflnt numbers; // To hold the input numbers, 
int numCount; // The number of numbers stored in the array, 
int num; // One of the numbers input by the user. 

numbers = new DynamicArrayOflntO; 
numCount = ; 

TextIO .putln( "Enter some positive integers; Enter to end"); 
while (true) { // Get numbers and put them in the dynamic array. 

TextID.put("? "); 

num = TextIO . getlnlnt () ; 

if (num <= 0) 
break; 

numbers .put (numCount , num); // Store num in the dynamic array. 
numCount ++; 

} 

TextIO. putln( "\nYour numbers in reverse order are:\n"); 

for (int i = numCount - 1; i >= 0; i — ) { 

TextIO .putln( numbers . get (i) ); // Print the i-th number. 

} 

} // end mainO ; 
} // end class ReverseWithDynamicArray 
You can find an applet that simulates the program in the on-line version of this section. 

7.3.3 ArrrayLists 

The DynamicArrayOflnt class could be used in any situation where an array of int with no preset 
limit on the size is needed. However, if we want to store Shapes instead of ints, we would have 
to define a new class to do it. That class, probably named "DynamicArrayOfShape" , would look 
exactly the same as the DynamicArrayOflnt class except that everywhere the type "int" appears, 
it would be replaced by the type "S/jape" . Similarly, we could define a DynamicArrayOfDouble 
class, a DynamicArrayOfPlayer class, and so on. But there is something a little silly about this, 
since all these classes are close to being identical. It would be nice to be able to write some 
kind of source code, once and for all, that could be used to generate any of these classes on 
demand, given the type of value that we want to store. This would be an example of generic 
programming. Some programming languages, including C++, have had support for generic 
programming for some time. With version 5.0, Java introduced true generic programming, 
but even before that it had something that was very similar: One can come close to generic 
programming in Java by working with data structures that contain elements of type Object. 
We will first consider the almost-generic programming that has been available in Java from 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



340 



the beginning, and then we will look at the change that was introduced in Java 5.0. A full 
discussion of generic programming will be given in Chapter 10. 

In Java, every class is a subclass of the class named Object. This means that every object can 
be assigned to a variable of type Object. Any object can be put into an array of type Object[]. 
If we defined a DynamicArrayOfObject class, then we could store objects of any type. This is not 
true generic programming, and it doesn't apply to the primitive types such as int and double. 
But it does come close. In fact, there is no need for us to define a DynamicArrayOfObject class. 
Java already has a standard class named ArrayList that serves much the same purpose. The 
ArrayList class is in the package java.util, so if you want to use it in a program, you should 
put the directive "import java.util. ArrayList;" at the beginning of your source code file. 

The ArrayList class differs from my DynamicArrayOflnt class in that an ArrayList object 
always has a definite size, and it is illegal to refer to a position in the ArrayList that lies outside 
its size. In this, an ArrayList is more like a regular array. However, the size of an ArrayList can 
be increased at will. The ArrayList class defines many instance methods. I'll describe some of 
the most useful. Suppose that list is a variable of type ArrayList. Then we have: 

• list. size () — This function returns the current size of the ArrayList. The only valid 
positions in the list are numbers in the range to list. size ()-l. Note that the size can 
be zero. A call to the default constructor new ArrayList () creates an ArrayList of size 
zero. 

• list . add (obj ) — Adds an object onto the end of the list, increasing the size by 1. The 
parameter, obj, can refer to an object of any type, or it can be null. 

• list. get (N) — This function returns the value stored at position N in the ArrayList. N 
must be an integer in the range to list . size () -1. If N is outside this range, an error 
of type IndexOutOfBoundsException occurs. Calling this function is similar to referring 
to A[N] for an array, A, except that you can't use list. get (N) on the left side of an 
assignment statement. 

• list. set (N, obj) — Assigns the object, obj, to position N in the ArrayList, replacing 
the item previously stored at position N. The integer N must be in the range from to 
list. size ()-l. A call to this function is equivalent to the command A[N] = obj for an 
array A. 

• list, remove (obj) - - If the specified object occurs somewhere in the ArrayList, it is 
removed from the list. Any items in the list that come after the removed item are moved 
down one position. The size of the ArrayList decreases by 1. If obj occurs more than once 
in the list, only the first copy is removed. 

• list. remove (N) — For an integer, N, this removes the N-th item in the ArrayList. N must 
be in the range to list . size ()-l. Any items in the list that come after the removed 
item are moved down one position. The size of the ArrayList decreases by 1. 

• list . indexOf (obj ) — A function that searches for the object, obj, in the ArrayList. If 
the object is found in the list, then the position number where it is found is returned. If 
the object is not found, then -1 is returned. 

For example, suppose again that players in a game are represented by objects of type Player. 
The players currently in the game could be stored in an ArrayList named players. This variable 
would be declared as 

ArrayList players; 
and initialized to refer to a new, empty ArrayList object with 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



341 



players = new ArrayListO; 

If newPlayer is a variable that refers to a Player object, the new player would be added to the 
ArrayList and to the game by saying 

players . add (newPlayer) ; 

and if player number i leaves the game, it is only necessary to say 
players. removed) ; 

Or, if player is a variable that refers to the Player that is to be removed, you could say 
players. remove (player) ; 

All this works very nicely. The only slight difficulty arises when you use the function 
players . get (i) to get the value stored at position i in the ArrayList. The return type of 
this function is Object. In this case the object that is returned by the function is actually of 
type Player. In order to do anything useful with the returned value, it's usually necessary to 
type-cast it to type Player: 

Player plr = (Player)players .get (i) ; 

For example, if the Player class includes an instance method makeMoveO that is called to allow 
a player to make a move in the game, then the code for letting every player make a move is 

for (int i = 0; i < players . size () ; i++) { 
Player plr = (Player) players .get (i) ; 
plr .makeMove () ; 

} 

The two lines inside the for loop can be combined into a single line: 
( (Player) players . get (i) ) .makeMoveO ; 

This gets an item from the list, type-casts it, and then calls the makeMoveO method on the 
resulting Player. The parentheses around " (Player) players .get (i)" are required because 
of Java's precedence rules. The parentheses force the type-cast to be performed before the 
makeMoveO method is called. 

For-each loops work for ArrayLists just as they do for arrays. But note that since the items 
in an ArrayList are only known to be Objects, the type of the loop control variable must be 
Object. For example, the for loop used above to let each Player make a move could be written 
as the for-each loop 

for ( Object plrObj : players ) { 
Player plr = (Player) plrObj ; 
plr . makeMove ( ) ; 

} 

In the body of the loop, the value of the loop control variable, plrObj , is one of the objects 
from the list, players. This object must be type-cast to type Player before it can be used. 

* * * 

In Subsection 5.5.5, I discussed a program, ShapeDraw, that uses ArrayLists. Here is another 
version of the same idea, simplified to make it easier to see how ArrayList is being used. The 
program supports the following operations: Click the large white drawing area to add a colored 
rectangle. (The color of the rectangle is given by a "rainbow palette" along the bottom of the 
applet; click the palette to select a new color.) Drag rectangles using the right mouse button. 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



342 



Hold down the Alt key and click on a rectangle to delete it (or click it with the middle mouse 
button). Shift-click a rectangle to move it out in front of all the other rectangles. You can try 
an applet version of the program in the on-line version of this section. 

Source code for the main panel for this program can be found in SimpleDrawRects.java. 
You should be able to follow the source code in its entirety. (You can also take a look at the 
file RainbowPalette.java, which defines the color palette shown at the bottom of the applet, if 
you like.) Here, I just want to look at the parts of the program that use an ArrayList. 

The applet uses a variable named rects, of type ArrayList, to hold information about the 
rectangles that have been added to the drawing area. The objects that are stored in the list 
belong to a static nested class, Colored Rect, that is defined as 

/** 

* An object of type ColoredRect holds the data for one colored rectangle. 
*/ 

private static class ColoredRect { 

int x,y; // Upper left corner of the rectangle, 

int width, height ; // Size of the rectangle. 
Color color; // Color of the rectangle. 

} 

If g is a variable of type Graphics, then the following code draws all the rectangles that 
are stored in the list rects (with a black outline around each rectangle): 

for (int i = 0; i < rects . size () ; i++) { 

ColoredRect rect = (ColoredRect)rects . get (i) ; 
g.setColor( rect. color ); 

g.fillRect( rect.x, rect.y, rect. width, rect .height) ; 
g.setColor( Color. BLACK ); 

g.drawRect( rect.x, rect.y, rect. width - 1, rect. height - 1); 

} 

The i-th rectangle in the list is obtained by calling rects. get (i). Since this method returns 
a value of type Object, the return value must be typecast to its actual type, ColoredRect, to get 
access to the data that it contains. 

To implement the mouse operations, it must be possible to find the rectangle, if any, that 
contains the point where the user clicked the mouse. To do this, I wrote the function 

/** 

* Find the topmost rect that contains the point (x,y). Return null 

* if no rect contains that point . The rects in the ArrayList are 

* considered in reverse order so that if one lies on top of another, 

* the one on top is seen first and is returned. 
*/ 

ColoredRect findRect(int x, int y) { 

for (int i = rects. size () - 1; i >= 0; i — ) { 
ColoredRect rect = (ColoredRect) rects .get (i) ; 
if ( x >= rect.x && x < rect.x + rect. width 

&& y >= rect.y && y < rect.y + rect. height ) 
return rect; // (x,y) is inside this rect. 

} 

return null; // No rect containing (x,y) was found. 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



343 



The code for removing a ColoredRect, rect, from the drawing area is simply 
rects . remove (rect) (followed by a repaint ()). Bringing a given rectangle out in front of 
all the other rectangles is just a little harder. Since the rectangles are drawn in the order in 
which they occur in the ArrayList, the rectangle that is in the last position in the list is in front 
of all the other rectangles on the screen. So we need to move the selected rectangle to the 
last position in the list. This can most easily be done in a slightly tricky way using built-in 
ArrayList operations: The rectangle is simply removed from its current position in the list and 
then added back at the end of the list: 

void bringToFront (ColoredRect rect) { 
if (rect != null) { 

rects . remove (rect) ; // Remove rect from the list. 

rects . add(rect) ; // Add it back; it will be placed in the last position, 
repaint () ; 

} 

} 

This should be enough to give you the basic idea. You can look in the source code for more 
details. 

7.3.4 Parameterized Types 

The main difference between true generic programming and the ArrayList examples in the 
previous subsection is the use of the type Object as the basic type for objects that are stored 
in a list. This has at least two unfortunate consequences: First, it makes it necessary to use 
type-casting in almost every case when an element is retrieved from that list. Second, since 
any type of object can legally be added to the list, there is no way for the compiler to detect 
an attempt to add the wrong type of object to the list; the error will be detected only at run 
time when the object is retrieved from the list and the attempt to type-cast the object fails. 
Compare this to arrays. An array of type BaseType[] can only hold objects of type BaseType. 
An attempt to store an object of the wrong type in the array will be detected by the compiler, 
and there is no need to type-cast items that are retrieved from the array back to type BaseType. 

To address this problem, Java 5.0 introduced parameterized types. ArrayList is an ex- 
ample: Instead of using the plain "ArrayList" type, it is possible to use ArrayList<BaseType>, 
where BaseType is any object type, that is, the name of a class or of an interface. (BaseType 
cannot be one of the primitive types.) ArrayList<BaseType> can be used to create lists that 
can hold only objects of type BaseType. For example, 

ArrayList<ColoredRect> rects; 

declares a variable named rects of type Arrayl_ist<ColoredRect>, and 

rects = new ArrayList<ColoredRect> () ; 

sets rects to refer to a newly created list that can only hold objects belonging to the class 
ColoredRect (or to a subclass). The funny- looking name "ArrayList<ColoredRect>" is being 
used here in exactly the same way as an ordinary class name — don't let the "<ColoredRect>" 
confuse you; it's just part of the name of the type, just as it would be in the array type 
Colored Rect[]. When a statement such as rects. add(x) ; occurs in the program, the compiler 
can check whether x is in fact of type ColoredRect. If not, the compiler will report a syntax 
error. When an object is retrieved from the list, the compiler knows that the object must be 
of type ColoredRect, so no type-cast is necessary. You can say simply: 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



344 



ColoredRect rect = rects.get(i) 

You can even refer directly to an instance variable in the object, such as rects.get(i) .color. 
This makes using Arrayl_ist<ColoredRect> very similar to using Colored Rect[ ], with the added 
advantage that the list can grow to any size. Note that if a for-each loop is used to process the 
items in rects, the type of the loop control variable can be ColoredRect, and no type-cast is 
necessary. For example, when using ArrayList<ColoredRect> as the type for the list rects, the 
code for drawing all the rectangles in the list could be rewritten as: 

for ( ColoredRect rect : rects ) { 
g.setColor( rect. color ); 

g.fillRect( rect.x, rect.y, rect. width, rect. height ); 
g.setColor( Color. BLACK ); 

g.drawRect( rect.x, rect.y, rect. width - 1, rect. height - 1 ); 

} 

You can use Array List<ColoredRect> anyplace where you could use a normal type: to declare 
variables, as the type of a formal parameter in a subroutine, or as the return type of a subroutine. 
You can even create a subclass of ArrayList<ColoredRect>! (Nevertheless, technically speaking, 
ArrayList<ColoredRect> is not considered to be a separate class from ArrayList. An object of 
type Array List<ColoredRect> actually belongs to the class ArrayList, but the compiler restricts 
the type of objects that can be added to the list.) 

The only drawback to using parameterized types is that the base type cannot be a primitive 
type. For example, there is no such thing as "ArrayList<int>" . However, this is not such a 
big drawback as it might seem at first, because of the "wrapper types" and "autoboxing" that 
were introduced in Subsection 5.3.2. A wrapper type such as Double or Integer can be used as 
a base type for a parameterized type. An object of type Arrayl_ist<Double> can hold objects of 
type Double. Since each object of type Double holds a value of type double, it's almost like 
having a list of doubles. If numlist is declared to be of type ArrayList<Double> and if x is of 
type double, then the value of x can be added to the list by saying: 

numlist . add ( new Double(x) ); 

Furthermore, because of autoboxing, the compiler will automatically do double-to-Doivb/e and 
Dotvb/e-to-double type conversions when necessary. This means that the compiler will treat 
"numlist . add (x)" as being equivalent to "numlist . add ( new Double(x) )". So, behind the 
scenes, "numlist . add (x)" is actually adding an object to the list, but it looks a lot as if you 
are working with a list of doubles. 

* * * 

The sample program SimplePaint2.java demonstrates the use of parameterized types. In 
this program, the user can sketch curves in a drawing area by clicking and dragging with the 
mouse. The curves can be of any color, and the user can select the drawing color using a menu. 
The background color of the drawing area can also be selected using a menu. And there is a 
"Control" menu that contains several commands: An "Undo" command, which removes the 
most recently drawn curve from the screen, a "Clear" command that removes all the curves, 
and a "Use Symmetry" checkbox that turns a symmetry feature on and off. Curves that are 
drawn by the user when the symmetry option is on are reflected horizontally and vertically 
to produce a symmetric pattern. You can try an applet version of the program in the on-line 
version of this section. 

Unlike the original SimplePaint program in Subsection 6.4.4, this new version uses a data 
structure to store information about the picture that has been drawn by the user. This data 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



345 



is used in the paintComponent () method to redraw the picture whenever necessary. Thus, the 
picture doesn't disappear when, for example, the picture is covered and then uncovered. The 
data structure is implemented using ArrayLists. 

The main data for a curve consists of a list of the points on the curve. This data can be stored 
in an object of type Arrayl_ist<Point>, where java.awt .Point is one of Java's standard classes. 
(A Point object contains two public integer variables x and y that represent the coordinates of 
a point.) However, to redraw the curve, we also need to know its color, and we need to know 
whether the symmetry option should be applied to the curve. All the data that is needed to 
redraw the curve can be grouped into an object of type CurveData that is defined as 

private static class CurveData { 

Color color; // The color of the curve. 

boolean symmetric; // Are horizontal and vertical reflections also drawn? 
ArrayList<Point> points; // The points on the curve. 

} 

However, a picture can contain many curves, not just one, so to store all the data necessary to 
redraw the entire picture, we need a list of objects of type CurveData. For this list, we can use 
a variable curves declared as 

ArrayList<CurveData> curves = new ArrayList<CurveData> () ; 

Here we have a list of objects, where each object contains a list of points as part of its data! 
Let's look at a few examples of processing this data structure. When the user clicks the mouse 
on the drawing surface, it's the start of a new curve, and a new CurveData object must be 
created and added to the list of curves. The instance variables in the new CurveData object 
must also be initialized. Here is the code from the mousePressedO routine that does this: 

currentCurve = new CurveDataO; // Create a new CurveData object. 

currentCurve . color = currentColor ; // The color of the curve is taken from an 

// instance variable that represents the 
// currently selected drawing color. 

currentCurve . symmetric = useSymmetry; // The "symmetric" property of the curve 

// is also copied from the current value 
// of an instance variable, useSymmetry. 

currentCurve .points = new ArrayList<Point> () ; // Create a new point list object. 

currentCurve .points . add( new Point (evt .getXO , evt.getYO) ); 

// The point where the user pressed the mouse is the first point on 
// the curve. A new Point object is created to hold the coordinates 
// of that point and is added to the list of points for the curve. 

curves . add(currentCurve) ; // Add the CurveData object to the list of curves. 

As the user drags the mouse, new points are added to currentCurve, and repaint () is called. 
When the picture is redrawn, the new point will be part of the picture. 

The paintComponent () method has to use the data in curves to draw all the curves. The 
basic structure is a for-each loop that processes the data for each individual curve in turn. This 
has the form: 

for ( CurveData curve : curves ) { 

// Draw the curve represented by the object, curve, of type CurveData. 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



346 



} 

In the body of this loop, curve .points is a variable of type Arrayl_ist<Point> that holds the 
list of points on the curve. The i-th point on the curve can be obtained by calling the get() 
method of this list: curve. points. get (i). This returns a value of type Point which contains 
instance variables named x and y. We can refer directly to the x-coordinate of the i-th point 

as: 

curve. points. get (i) .x 

This might seem rather complicated, but it's a nice example of a complex name that specifies 
a path to a desired piece of data: Go to the object, curve. Inside curve, go to points. Inside 
points, get the i-th item. And from that item, get the instance variable named x. Here is the 
complete definition of the paintComponent () method: 

public void paintComponent (Graphics g) { 
super . paintComponent (g) ; 
for ( CurveData curve : curves) { 
g. setColor (curve . color) ; 

for (int i = 1; i < curve .points . size () ; i++) { 

// Draw a line segment from point number i-1 to point number i. 
int xl = curve. points. get (i-1) .x; 
int yl = curve. points. get (i-1) .y; 
int x2 = curve. points. get(i) .x; 
int y2 = curve. points. get (i) .y; 
g.drawLine(xl,yl,x2,y2) ; 
if (curve . symmetric) { 

// Also draw the horizontal and vertical reflections 
// of the line segment . 

int w = getWidthO ; 

int h = getHeightO; 

g.drawLine(w-xl,yl,w-x2,y2) ;

g. drawLine (w-xl ,h-yl ,w-x2 ,h-y2) ; 

} 

} 

} 

} // end paintComponent () 

I encourage you to read the full source code, SimplePaint2.java. In addition to serving as an 
example of using parameterized types, it also serves as another example of creating and using 
menus. 

7.3.5 Vectors 

The Array Li st class was introduced in Java version 1.2, as one of a group of classes designed 
for working with collections of objects. We'll look at these "collection classes" in Chapter 10. 
Early versions of Java did not include ArrayList, but they did have a very similar class named 
java.util .Vector. You can still see Vectors used in older code and in many of Java's standard 
classes, so it's worth knowing about them. Using a Vector is similar to using an ArrayList, except 
that different names are used for some commonly used instance methods, and some instance 
methods in one class don't correspond to any instance method in the other class. 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS

Like an Array List, a Vector is similar to an array of Objects that can grow to be as large as 
necessary. The default constructor, new Vector (), creates a vector with no elements. Suppose 
that vec is a Vector. Then we have: 

• vec. size () — a function that returns the number of elements currently in the vector. 

• vec . elementAt (N) — returns the N-th element of the vector, for an integer N. N must be 
in the range to vec. size ()-l. This is the same as get(N) for an ArrayList. 

• vec . setElementAt (obj ,N) — sets the N-th element in the vector to be obj. N must be 
in the range to vec . size ()-l. This is the same as set (N, obj) for an ArrayList. 

• vec . addElement (obj ) — adds the Object, obj , to the end of the vector. This is the same 
as the add() method of an ArrayList. 

• vec.removeElement(obj) — removes obj from the vector, if it occurs. Only the first 
occurrence is removed. This is the same as remove (obj) for an ArrayList. 

• vec . removeElement At (N) — removes the N-th element, for an integer N. N must be in 
the range to vec . size ()-l. This is the same as remove (N) for an ArrayList. 

• vec . setSize (N) — sets the size of the vector to N. If there were more than N elements in 
vec, the extra elements are removed. If there were fewer than N elements, extra spaces are 
filled with null. The ArrayList class, unfortunately, does not have a setSizeO method. 

The Vector class includes many more methods, but these are probably the most commonly 
used. Note that in Java 5.0, Vector can be used as a parameterized type in exactly the same 
way as ArrayList. That is, if BaseType is any class or interface name, then Vector<BaseType> 
represents vectors that can hold only objects of type BaseType. 

7.4 Searching and Sorting 

Two ARRAY PROCESSING TECHNIQUES that are particularly common are searching and sort- (online) 
ing. Searching here refers to finding an item in the array that meets some specified criterion. 
Sorting refers to rearranging all the items in the array into increasing or decreasing order (where 
the meaning of increasing and decreasing can depend on the context). 

Sorting and searching are often discussed, in a theoretical sort of way, using an array of 
numbers as an example. In practical situations, though, more interesting types of data are 
usually involved. For example, the array might be a mailing list, and each element of the array 
might be an object containing a name and address. Given the name of a person, you might 
want to look up that person's address. This is an example of searching, since you want to find 
the object in the array that contains the given name. It would also be useful to be able to sort 
the array according to various criteria. One example of sorting would be ordering the elements 
of the array so that the names are in alphabetical order. Another example would be to order 
the elements of the array according to zip code before printing a set of mailing labels. (This 
kind of sorting can get you a cheaper postage rate on a large mailing.) 

This example can be generalized to a more abstract situation in which we have an array 
that contains objects, and we want to search or sort the array based on the value of one of the 
instance variables in that array. We can use some terminology here that originated in work 
with "databases," which are just large, organized collections of data. We refer to each of the 
objects in the array as a record. The instance variables in an object are then called fields of 
the record. In the mailing list example, each record would contain a name and address. The 
fields of the record might be the first name, last name, street address, state, city and zip code. 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



348 



For the purpose of searching or sorting, one of the fields is designated to be the key field. 
Searching then means finding a record in the array that has a specified value in its key field. 
Sorting means moving the records around in the array so that the key fields of the record are 
in increasing (or decreasing) order. 

In this section, most of my examples follow the tradition of using arrays of numbers. But 
I'll also give a few examples using records and keys, to remind you of the more practical 
applications. 

7.4.1 Searching 

There is an obvious algorithm for searching for a particular item in an array: Look at each 
item in the array in turn, and check whether that item is the one you are looking for. If so, 
the search is finished. If you look at every item without finding the one you want, then you 
can be sure that the item is not in the array. It's easy to write a subroutine to implement this 
algorithm. Let's say the array that you want to search is an array of ints. Here is a method 
that will search the array for a specified integer. If the integer is found, the method returns 
the index of the location in the array where it is found. If the integer is not in the array, the 
method returns the value -1 as a signal that the integer could not be found: 

/** 

* Searches the array A for the integer N. If N is not in the array, 

* then -1 is returned. If N is in the array, then the return value is 

* the first integer i that satisfies A[i] == N. 
*/ 

static int find(int[] A, int N) { 

for (int index = 0; index < A. length; index++) { 
if ( A [index] == N ) 

return index; // N has been found at this index! 

} 

// If we get this far, then N has not been found 
// anywhere in the array. Return a value of -1. 

return -1; 

} 

This method of searching an array by looking at each item in turn is called linear search. 
If nothing is known about the order of the items in the array, then there is really no better 
alternative algorithm. But if the elements in the array are known to be in increasing or decreas- 
ing order, then a much faster search algorithm can be used. An array in which the elements are 
in order is said to be sorted. Of course, it takes some work to sort an array, but if the array 
is to be searched many times, then the work done in sorting it can really pay off. 

Binary search is a method for searching for a given item in a sorted array. Although 
the implementation is not trivial, the basic idea is simple: If you are searching for an item in 
a sorted list, then it is possible to eliminate half of the items in the list by inspecting a single 
item. For example, suppose that you are looking for the number 42 in a sorted array of 1000 
integers. Let's assume that the array is sorted into increasing order. Suppose you check item 
number 500 in the array, and find that the item is 93. Since 42 is less than 93, and since the 
elements in the array are in increasing order, we can conclude that if 42 occurs in the array 
at all, then it must occur somewhere before location 500. All the locations numbered 500 or 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



349 



above contain values that are greater than or equal to 93. These locations can be eliminated 
as possible locations of the number 42. 

The next obvious step is to check location 250. If the number at that location is, say, -21, 
then you can eliminate locations before 250 and limit further search to locations between 251 
and 499. The next test will limit the search to about 125 locations, and the one after that to 
about 62. After just 10 steps, there is only one location left. This is a whole lot better than 
looking through every element in the array. If there were a million items, it would still take 
only 20 steps for binary search to search the array! (Mathematically, the number of steps is 
approximately equal to the logarithm, in the base 2, of the number of items in the array.) 

In order to make binary search into a Java subroutine that searches an array A for an item 
N, we just have to keep track of the range of locations that could possibly contain N. At each 
step, as we eliminate possibilities, we reduce the size of this range. The basic operation is to 
look at the item in the middle of the range. If this item is greater than N, then the second 
half of the range can be eliminated. If it is less than N, then the first half of the range can 
be eliminated. If the number in the middle just happens to be N exactly, then the search is 
finished. If the size of the range decreases to zero, then the number N does not occur in the 
array. Here is a subroutine that returns the location of N in a sorted array A. If N cannot be 
found in the array, then a value of -1 is returned instead: 
/** 

* Searches the array A for the integer N. 

* Precondition: A must be sorted into increasing order. 

* Postcondition: If N is in the array, then the return value, i, 

* satisfies A[i] == N. If N is not in the array, then the 

* return value is -1. 
*/ 

static int binarySearch(int [] A, int N) { 

int lowestPossibleLoc = 0; 

int highestPossibleLoc = A. length - 1; 

while (highestPossibleLoc >= lowestPossibleLoc) { 

int middle = (lowestPossibleLoc + highestPossibleLoc) / 2; 
if (A [middle] == N) { 

// N has been found at this index! 
return middle; 

} 

else if (A [middle] > N) { 

// eliminate locations >= middle 
highestPossibleLoc = middle - 1; 

} 

else { 

// eliminate locations <= middle 
lowestPossibleLoc = middle + 1; 

} 

> 

// At this point, highestPossibleLoc < LowestPossibleLoc, 

// which means that N is known to be not in the array. Return 

// a -1 to indicate that N could not be found in the array. 

return -1: 



}

7.4.2 Association Lists 

One particularly common application of searching is with association lists. The standard 
example of an association list is a dictionary. A dictionary associates definitions with words. 
Given a word, you can use the dictionary to look up its definition. We can think of the dictionary 
as being a list of pairs of the form (w,d), where w is a word and d is its definition. A general 
association list is a list of pairs (k, v) , where k is some "key" value, and v is a value associated 
to that key. In general, we want to assume that no two pairs in the list have the same key. 
There are two basic operations on association lists: Given a key, k, find the value v associated 
with k, if any. And given a key, k, and a value v, add the pair (k,v) to the association list 
(replacing the pair, if any, that had the same key value). The two operations are usually called 
get and put. 

Association lists are very widely used in computer science. For example, a compiler has 
to keep track of the location in memory associated with each variable. It can do this with an 
association list in which each key is a variable name and the associated value is the address 
of that variable in memory. Another example would be a mailing list, if we think of it as 
associating an address to each name on the list. As a related example, consider a phone 
directory that associates a phone number to each name. We'll look at a highly simplified 
version of this example. And note that things can be done much more efficiently, as you'll learn 
in Chapter 10. 

The items in the phone directory's association list could be objects belonging to the class: 

class PhoneEntry { 
String name ; 
String phoneNum; 

} 

The data for a phone directory consists of an array of type PhoneEntry[] and an integer 
variable to keep track of how many entries are actually stored in the directory. The technique 
of "dynamic arrays" (Subsection 7.3.2) can be used in order to avoid putting an arbitrary limit 
on the number of entries that the phone directory can hold. Using an ArrayList would be another 
possibility. A PhoneDirectory class should include instance methods that implement the "get" 
and "put" operations. Here is one possible simple definition of the class: 

/** 

* A PhoneDirectory holds a list of names with a phone number for 

* each name. It is possible to find the number associated with 

* a given name, and to specify the phone number for a given name. 
*/ 

public class PhoneDirectory { 
/** 

* An object of type PhoneEntry holds one name/number pair. 
*/ 

private static class PhoneEntry { 
String name ; / / The name . 

String number; // The associated phone number. 

> 

private PhoneEntry!] data; // Array that holds the name/number pairs, 
private int dataCount; // The number of pairs stored in the array. 

/** 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



351 



* Constructor creates an initially empty directory. 
*/ 

public PhoneDirectory () { 
data = new PhoneEntry [1] ; 
dataCount = 0; 

} 

/** 

* Looks for a name/number pair with a given name. If found, the index 

* of the pair in the data array is returned. If no pair contains the 

* given name, then the return value is -1. This private method is 

* used internally in getNumberO and putNumberO . 
*/ 

private int find( String name ) { 

for (int i = 0; i < dataCount; i++) { 
if (data [i] . name . equals (name) ) 

return i; // The name has been found in position i. 

} 

return -1; // The name does not exist in the array. 

} 

/** 

* Finds the phone number, if any, for a given name. 

* Oreturn The phone number associated with the name; if the name does 

* not occur in the phone directory, then the return value is null. 
*/ 

public String getNumber( String name ) { 
int position = find(name); 
if (position == -1) 

return null; // There is no phone entry for the given name, 
else 

return data [position] .number; 

> 

/** 

* Associates a given name with a given phone number. If the name 

* already exists in the phone directory, then the new number replaces 

* the old one. Otherwise, a new name/number pair is added. The 

* name and number should both be non-null. An IllegalArgumentException 

* is thrown if this is not the case. 
*/ 

public void putNumber( String name, String number ) { 
if (name == null I I number == null) 

throw new IllegalArgumentException ("name and number cannot be null"); 
int i = find (name) ; 
if (i >= 0) { 

// The name already exists, in position i in the array. 
// Just replace the old number at that position with the new. 
data [i] .number = number; 

} 

else { 

// Add a new name/number pair to the array. If the array is 
// already full, first create a new, larger array, 
if (dataCount == data. length) { 

PhoneEntry [] newData = new PhoneEntry [ 2*data. length ]; 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



352 



System . arraycopy (dat a , , newDat a , , dataCount ) ; 
data = newData; 

} 

PhoneEntry newEntry = new PhoneEntryO ; // Create a new pair. 
newEntry . name = name ; 
newEntry . number = number ; 

data [dataCount] = newEntry; // Add the new pair to the array. 
dataCount ++ ; 

} 

} 

} // end class PhoneDirectory 

The class defines a private instance method, find(), that uses linear search to find the 
position of a given name in the array of name/number pairs. The find() method is used 
both in the getNumberQ method and in the putNumberO method. Note in particular that 
putNumber (name , number) has to check whether the name is in the phone directory. If so, it 
just changes the number in the existing entry; if not, it has to create a new phone entry and 
add it to the array. 

This class could use a lot of improvement. For one thing, it would be nice to use binary 
search instead of simple linear search in the getNumber method. However, we could only do 
that if the list of PhoneEntries were sorted into alphabetical order according to name. In fact, 
it's really not all that hard to keep the list of entries in sorted order, as you'll see in the next 
subsection. 

7.4.3 Insertion Sort 

We've seen that there are good reasons for sorting arrays. There are many algorithms available 
for doing so. One of the easiest to understand is the insertion sort algorithm. This method 
is also applicable to the problem of keeping a list in sorted order as you add new items to the 
list. Let's consider that case first: 

Suppose you have a sorted list and you want to add an item to that list. If you want to 
make sure that the modified list is still sorted, then the item must be inserted into the right 
location, with all the smaller items coming before it and all the bigger items after it. This will 
mean moving each of the bigger items up one space to make room for the new item. 

/* 

* Precondition: itemsInArray is the number of items that are 

* stored in A. These items must be in increasing order 

* (A[0] <= A[l] <= ... <= A[itemsInArray-l] ) . 

* The array size is at least one greater than itemsInArray. 

* Postcondition: The number of items has increased by one, 

* newltem has been added to the array, and all the items 

* in the array are still in increasing order. 

* Note: To complete the process of inserting an item in the 

* array, the variable that counts the number of items 

* in the array must be incremented, after calling this 

* subroutine. 
*/ 

static void insert(int[] A, int itemsInArray, int newltem) { 

int loc = itemsInArray - 1; // Start at the end of the array. 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



353 



/* Move items bigger than newltem up one space; 

Stop when a smaller item is encountered or when the 
beginning of the array (loc == 0) is reached. */ 

while (loc >= && A [loc] > newltem) { 

A [loc + 1] = A [loc] ; // Bump item from A [loc] up to loc+1. 
loc = loc - 1; // Go on to next location. 

} 

A [loc + 1] = newltem; // Put newltem in last vacated space. 

} 

Conceptually, this could be extended to a sorting method if we were to take all the items 
out of an unsorted array, and then insert them back into the array one-by-one, keeping the list 
in sorted order as we do so. Each insertion can be done using the insert routine given above. 
In the actual algorithm, we don't really take all the items from the array; we just remember 
what part of the array has been sorted: 

static void insertionSort (int [] A) { 

// Sort the array A into increasing order. 

int itemsSorted; // Number of items that have been sorted so far. 

for (itemsSorted = 1; itemsSorted < A. length; itemsSorted++) { 
// Assume that items A[0], A[l], ... A [itemsSorted-1] 
// have already been sorted. Insert A [itemsSorted] 
// into the sorted part of the list. 

int temp = A [itemsSorted] ; // The item to be inserted, 
int loc = itemsSorted - 1; // Start at end of list. 

while (loc >= && A [loc] > temp) { 

A [loc + 1] = A [loc]; // Bump item from A [loc] up to loc+1. 
loc = loc - 1; // Go on to next location. 

} 

A [loc + 1] = temp; // Put temp in last vacated space. 

} 

} 

The following is an illustration of one stage in insertion sort. It shows what happens during 
one execution of the for loop in the above method, when itemsSorted is 5:

Now, the sorted part of the list has 
increased in size by one item. 



7.4.4 Selection Sort 

Another typical sorting method uses the idea of finding the biggest item in the list and moving 
it to the end — which is where it belongs if the list is to be in increasing order. Once the biggest 
item is in its correct location, you can then apply the same idea to the remaining items. That is, 
find the next-biggest item, and move it into the next-to-last space, and so forth. This algorithm 
is called selection sort. It's easy to write: 

static void selectionSort (int [] A) { 

// Sort A into increasing order, using selection sort 

for (int lastPlace = A.length-1; lastPlace > 0; lastPlace — ) { 
// Find the largest item among A [0] , A[l], 
// A [lastPlace] , and move it into position lastPlace 
//by swapping it with the number that is currently 
// in position lastPlace. 

int maxLoc =0; // Location of largest item seen so far. 

for (int j =1; j <= lastPlace; j++) { 
if (A[j] > A [maxLoc] ) { 

// Since A[j] is bigger than the maximum we've seen 
// so far, j is the new location of the maximum value 
// we've seen so far. 
maxLoc = j ; 

} 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



355 



} 

int temp = A[maxLoc]; // Swap largest item with A [lastPlace] . 
A[maxLoc] = A [lastPlace] ; 
A [lastPlace] = temp; 

} // end of for loop 

} 

Insertion sort and selection sort are suitable for sorting fairly small arrays (up to a few hun- 
dred elements, say). There are more complicated sorting algorithms that are much faster than 
insertion sort and selection sort for large arrays. I'll discuss one such algorithm in Chapter 9. 

* * * 

A variation of selection sort is used in the Hand class that was introduced in Subsection 5.4.1. 
(By the way, you are finally in a position to fully understand the source code for both the Hand 
class and the Deck class from that section. See the source files Deck.java and Hand.java.) 

In the Hand class, a hand of playing cards is represented by an ArrayList. The objects 
stored in the ArrayList are of type Card. A Card object contains instance methods getSuitO 
and getValueO that can be used to determine the suit and value of the card. In my sorting 
method, I actually create a new list and move the cards one-by-one from the old list to the 
new list. The cards are selected from the old list in increasing order. In the end, the new 
list becomes the hand and the old list is discarded. This is certainly not the most efficient 
procedure! But hands of cards are so small that the inefficiency is negligible. Here is the code 
for sorting cards by suit: 

/** 

* Sorts the cards in the hand so that cards of the same suit are 

* grouped together, and within a suit the cards are sorted by value. 

* Note that aces are considered to have the lowest value, 1. 
*/ 

public void sortBySuitO { 

ArrayList newHand = new ArrayList (); 
while (hand.sizeO > 0) { 

int pos =0; // Position of minimal card. 
Card c = (Card)hand.get(O) ; // Minimal card, 
for (int i = 1; i < hand.sizeO; i++) { 
Card cl = (Card) hand. get (i) ; 
if ( cl.getSuitO < c.getSuitO II 

(cl .getSuitO == c.getSuitO && cl .getValueO < c .getValueO ) ) { 
pos = i; 
c = cl ; 

} 

} 

hand. remove (pos) ; 
newHand . add ( c ) ; 

} 

hand = newHand; 

} 

This example illustrates the fact that comparing items in a list is not usually as simple as 
using the operator "<". In this case, we consider one card to be less than another if the suit 
of the first card is less than the suit of the second, and also if the suits are the same and the 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



356 



value of the second card is less than the value of the first. The second part of this test ensures 
that cards with the same suit will end up sorted by value. 

Sorting a list of Strings raises a similar problem: the "<" operator is not defined for strings. 
However, the String class does define a compareTo method. If strl and str2 are of type String, 
then 

strl . compareTo (str2) 

returns an int that is when strl is equal to str2, is less than when strl precedes str2, 
and is greater than when strl follows str2. The definition of "succeeds" and "follows" for 
strings uses what is called lexicographic ordering, which is based on the Unicode values of 
the characters in the strings. Lexicographic ordering is not the same as alphabetical ordering, 
even for strings that consist entirely of letters (because in lexicographic ordering, all the upper 
case letters come before all the lower case letters). However, for words consisting strictly of 
the 26 lower case letters in the English alphabet, lexicographic and alphabetic ordering are 
the same. (The same holds true for uppercase letters.) Thus, if strl and str2 are strings 
containing only letters from the English alphabet, then the test 

strl .toLowerCase () . compareTo (str2 .toLowerCase () ) < 
is true if and only if strl comes before str2 in alphabetical order. 

7.4.5 Unsorting 

I can't resist ending this section on sorting with a related problem that is much less common, 
but is a bit more fun. That is the problem of putting the elements of an array into a random 
order. The typical case of this problem is shuffling a deck of cards. A good algorithm for 
shuffling is similar to selection sort, except that instead of moving the biggest item to the end 
of the list, an item is selected at random and moved to the end of the list. Here is a subroutine 
to shuffle an array of ints: 

/** 

* Postcondition: The items in A have been rearranged into a random order. 
*/ 

static void shuffle (int [] A) { 

for (int lastPlace = A.length-1; lastPlace > 0; lastPlace — ) { 
// Choose a random location from among , 1 lastPlace . 
int randLoc = (int) (Math. randomO * (lastPlace+1) ) ; 

// Swap items in locations randLoc and lastPlace. 
int temp = A [randLoc] ; 
A [randLoc] = A [lastPlace] ; 
A [lastPlace] = temp; 

} 

} 

7.5 Multi-dimensional Arrays 

Any type can be used as the base type of an array. You can have an array of ints, an (online) 
array of Strings, an array of Objects, and so on. In particular, since an array type is a first-class 
Java type, you can have an array of arrays. For example, an array of ints has type int[ ] . This 
means that there is automatically another type, int[][], which represents an "array of arrays of 
ints". Such an array is said to be a two-dimensional array. Of course once you have the 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



357 



type int[][], there is nothing to stop you from forming the type int[] [], which represents a 
three-dimensional array — and so on. There is no limit on the number of dimensions that an 
array type can have. However, arrays of dimension three or higher are fairly uncommon, and 
I concentrate here mainly on two-dimensional arrays. The type BaseType[][] is usually read 
"two-dimensional array of 6ase7ype" or "Base Type array array". 

7.5.1 Creating Two-dimensional Arrays 

The declaration statement "int [] [] A;" declares a variable named A of type int[ ][ ]. This 
variable can hold a reference to an object of type int[][]. The assignment statement 
"A = new int [3] [4] ;" creates a new two-dimensional array object and sets A to point to 
the newly created object. As usual, the declaration and assignment could be combined in a 
single declaration statement "int [] [] A = new int [3] [4] ;". The newly created object is an 
array of arrays-of-ints. The notation int [3] [4] indicates that there are 3 arrays-of-ints in 
the array A, and that there are 4 ints in each array-of-ints. However, trying to think in such 
terms can get a bit confusing — as you might have already noticed. So it is customary to think 
of a two-dimensional array of items as a rectangular grid or matrix of items. The notation 
"new int [3] [4]" can then be taken to describe a grid of ints with 3 rows and 4 columns. 
The following picture might help:

If you create an array A = new int[3][4], 
you should think of it as a "matrix" with 
3 rows and 4 columns. 



But in reality, A holds a reference to 
an array of 3 items, where each item 
is a reference to an array of 4 ints.

For the most part, you can ignore the reality and keep the picture of a grid in mind. 
Sometimes, though, you will need to remember that each row in the grid is really an array in 
itself. These arrays can be referred to as A[0] , A[l] , and A [2] . Each row is in fact a value of 
type int[ ] . It could, for example, be passed to a subroutine that asks for a parameter of type 
int[]. 

The notation A[l] refers to one of the rows of the array A. Since A[l] is itself an array of 
ints, you can use another subscript to refer to one of the positions in that row. For example, 
A[l] [3] refers to item number 3 in row number 1. Keep in mind, of course, that both rows 
and columns are numbered starting from zero. So, in the above example, A[l] [3] is 5. More

generally, A[i] [j] refers to the grid position in row number i and column number j. The 12 
items in A are named as follows: 

A[0][0] A[0][1] A[0][2] A[0][3] 

A[1][0] A[l][l] A[l][2] A[l][3] 

A[2][0] A[2][l] A [2] [2] A [2] [3] 

A[i] [j] is actually a variable of type int. You can assign integer values to it or use it in any 
other context where an integer variable is allowed. 

It might be worth noting that A . length gives the number of rows of A. To get the number 
of columns in A, you have to ask how many ints there are in a row; this number would be 
given by A[0] .length, or equivalently by A[l] .length or A [2] .length. (There is actually 
no rule that says that all the rows of an array must have the same length, and some advanced 
applications of arrays use varying-sized rows. But if you use the new operator to create an array 
in the manner described above, you'll always get an array with equal-sized rows.) 

Three-dimensional arrays are treated similarly. For example, a three-dimensional array of 
ints could be created with the declaration statement "int [] [] [] B = new int [7] [5] [11] ;". 
It's possible to visualize the value of B as a solid 7-by-5-by-ll block of cells. Each cell holds an 
int and represents one position in the three-dimensional array. Individual positions in the array 
can be referred to with variable names of the form B[i] [j] [k] . Higher-dimensional arrays 
follow the same pattern, although for dimensions greater than three, there is no easy way to 
visualize the structure of the array. 

It's possible to fill a multi-dimensional array with specified items at the time it is declared. 
Recall that when an ordinary one-dimensional array variable is declared, it can be assigned 
an "array initializer," which is just a list of values enclosed between braces, { and }. Array 
initializers can also be used when a multi-dimensional array is declared. An initializer for a 
two-dimensional array consists of a list of one-dimensional array initializers, one for each row 
in the two-dimensional array. For example, the array A shown in the picture above could be 
created with: 

int[] [] A = { { 1, 0, 12, -1 }, 
{ 7, -3, 2, 5 }, 
{ -5, -2, 2, -9 } 

}; 

If no initializer is provided for an array, then when the array is created it is automatically filled 
with the appropriate value: zero for numbers, false for boolean, and null for objects. 

7.5.2 Using Two-dimensional Arrays 

Just as in the case of one-dimensional arrays, two-dimensional arrays are often processed using 
for statements. To process all the items in a two-dimensional array, you have to use one for 
statement nested inside another. If the array A is declared as 

int [] [] A = new int [3] [4] ; 
then you could store a 17 into each location in A with: 

for (int row = 0; row < 3; row++) { 

for (int column = 0; column < 4; column++) { 
A [row] [column] = 17; 

> 

} 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



359 



The first time the outer for loop executes (with row = 0), the inner for loop fills in the 
four values in the first row of A, namely A[0] [0] = 17, A[0] [1] = 17, A[0] [2] = 17, and 
A[0] [3] = 17. The next execution of the outer for loop fills in the second row of A. And the 
third and final execution of the outer loop fills in the final row of A. 
Similarly, you could add up all the items in A with: 
int sum = ; 

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) 
for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) 
sum = sum + A[i] [j] ; 

This could even be done with nested for-each loops. Keep in mind that the elements in A are 
objects of type int[], while the elements in each row of A are of type int: 
int sum = ; 

for ( int [] row : A ) { // For each row in A. . . 

for ( int item : row ) // For each item in that row... 

sum = sum + item; // Add item to the sum. 

} 

To process a three-dimensional array, you would, of course, use triply nested for loops. 

* * * 

A two-dimensional array can be used whenever the data that is being represented can be 
arranged into rows and columns in a natural way. Often, the grid is built into the problem. 
For example, a chess board is a grid with 8 rows and 8 columns. If a class named ChessPiece 
is available to represent individual chess pieces, then the contents of a chess board could be 
represented by a two-dimensional array: 

ChessPiece [] [] board = new ChessPiece [8] [8] ; 

Or consider the "mosaic" of colored rectangles used in an example in Subsection 4.6.2. The 
mosaic is implemented by a class named MosaicCanvas.java. The data about the color of each 
of the rectangles in the mosaic is stored in an instance variable named grid of type Color[][]. 
Each position in this grid is occupied by a value of type Color. There is one position in the grid 
for each colored rectangle in the mosaic. The actual two-dimensional array is created by the 
statement: 

grid = new Color [ROWS] [COLUMNS] ; 

where ROWS is the number of rows of rectangles in the mosaic and COLUMNS is the number of 
columns. The value of the Color variable grid [i] [j] is the color of the rectangle in row number 
i and column number j. When the color of that rectangle is changed to some color, c, the value 
stored in grid[i] [j] is changed with a statement of the form "grid[i] [j] = c;". When the 
mosaic is redrawn, the values stored in the two-dimensional array are used to decide what color 
to make each rectangle. Here is a simplified version of the code from the MosaicCanvas class 
that draws all the colored rectangles in the grid. You can see how it uses the array: 

int rowHeight = getHeightO / ROWS; 
int colWidth = getWidthO / COLUMNS; 
for (int row = 0; row < ROWS; row++) { 

for (int col = 0; col < COLUMNS; col++) { 

g . setColor( grid [row] [col] ); // Get color from array. 
g.fillRect( col*colWidth, row*rowHeight , 

colWidth, rowHeight ); 

> 

} 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS

Sometimes two-dimensional arrays are used in problems in which the grid is not so visually 
obvious. Consider a company that owns 25 stores. Suppose that the company has data about 
the profit earned at each store for each month in the year 2010. If the stores are numbered 
from to 24, and if the twelve months from January '10 through December '10 are numbered 
from to 11, then the profit data could be stored in an array, profit, constructed as follows: 

double [][] profit = new double [25] [12] ; 

prof it [3] [2] would be the amount of profit earned at store number 3 in March, and 
more generally, profit [storeNum] [monthNum] would be the amount of profit earned in store 
number storeNum in month number monthNum. In this example, the one-dimensional array 
profit [storeNum] has a very useful meaning: It is just the profit data for one particular store 
for all the months in the whole year. 

Let's assume that the profit array has already been filled with data. This data can be 
processed in a lot of interesting ways. For example, the total profit for the company — for the 
whole year from all its stores — can be calculated by adding up all the entries in the array: 

double totalProfit; // Company's total profit in 2010. 

totalProfit = 0; 

for (int store = 0; store < 25; store++) { 
for (int month = 0; month < 12; month++) 
totalProfit += prof it [store] [month] ; 

} 

Sometimes it is necessary to process a single row or a single column of an array, not the 
entire array. For example, to compute the total profit earned by the company in December, 
that is, in month number 11, you could use the loop: 

double decemberProf it = 0.0; 

for (storeNum = 0; storeNum < 25; storeNum++) 
decemberProf it += prof it [storeNum] [11] ; 

Let's extend this idea to create a one-dimensional array that contains the total profit for each 
month of the year: 

doublet] monthlyProf it ; // Holds profit for each month. 
monthlyProf it = new double [12]; 

for (int month = 0; month < 12; month++) { 

// compute the total profit from all stores in this month. 

monthlyProf it [month] = 0.0; 

for (int store = 0; store < 25; store++) { 

// Add the profit from this store in this month 
// into the total profit figure for the month. 
monthlyProf it [month] += prof it [store] [month] ; 

> 

} 

As a final example of processing the profit array, suppose that we wanted to know which 
store generated the most profit over the course of the year. To do this, we have to add up the 
monthly profits for each store. In array terms, this means that we want to find the sum of each 
row in the array. As we do this, we need to keep track of which row produces the largest total. 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



361 



double maxProfit; // Maximum profit earned by a store, 
int bestStore; // The number of the store with the 
// maximum profit. 

double total; // Total profit for one store. 

// First compute the profit from store number 0. 

total = 0.0; 

for (month = 0; month < 12; month++) 
total += profit [0] [month] ; 

bestStore =0; // Start by assuming that the best 

maxProfit = total; // store is store number 0. 

// Now, go through the other stores, and whenever we 
// find one with a bigger profit than maxProfit, revise 
// the assumptions about bestStore and maxProfit. 

for (store = 1; store < 25; store++) { 

// Compute this store's profit for the year. 

total = 0.0; 

for (month = 0; month < 12; month++) 
total += prof it [store] [month] ; 

// Compare this store's profits with the highest 
// profit we have seen among the preceding stores. 

if (total > maxProfit) { 

maxProfit = total; // Best profit seen so far! 
bestStore = store; //It came from this store. 

> 

} // end for 

// At this point, maxProfit is the best profit of any 
// of the 25 stores, and bestStore is a store that 
// generated that profit. (Note that there could also be 
// other stores that generated exactly the same profit.) 

7.5.3 Example: Checkers 

For the rest of this section, we'll look at a more substantial example. We look at a program 
that lets two users play checkers against each other. A player moves by clicking on the piece 
to be moved and then on the empty square to which it is to be moved. The squares that the 
current player can legally click are highlighted. The square containing a piece that has been 
selected to be moved is surrounded by a white border. Other pieces that can legally be moved 
are surrounded by a cyan-colored border. If a piece has been selected, each empty square that 
it can legally move to is highlighted with a green border. The game enforces the rule that if 
the current player can jump one of the opponent's pieces, then the player must jump. When 
a player's piece becomes a king, by reaching the opposite end of the board, a big white "K" is 
drawn on the piece. You can try an applet version of the program in the on-line version of this 
section. Here is what it looks like: 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



362 




I will only cover a part of the programming of this applet. I encourage you to read the 
complete source code, Checkers.java. At over 750 lines, this is a more substantial example 
than anything you've seen before in this course, but it's an excellent example of state-based, 
event-driven programming. 

The data about the pieces on the board are stored in a two-dimensional array. Because of 
the complexity of the program, I wanted to divide it into several classes. In addition to the 
main class, there are several nested classes. One of these classes is CheckersData, which handles 
the data for the board. It is mainly this class that I want to talk about. 

The CheckersData class has an instance variable named board of type int [] [] . The value 
of board is set to "new int [8] [8] " , an 8-by-8 grid of integers. The values stored in the grid 
are defined as constants representing the possible contents of a square on a checkerboard: 



static final int 

EMPTY = 0, 
RED = 1, 
RED_KING = 2, 
BLACK = 3, 
BLACKJQNG = 4; 



// Value representing an empty square. 

// A regular red piece. 

// A red king. 

// A regular black piece. 

// A black king. 



The constants RED and BLACK are also used in my program (or, perhaps, misused) to represent 
the two players in the game. When a game is started, the values in the variable, board, are set 
to represent the initial state of the board. The grid of values looks like

A regular black piece can only move "down" the grid. That is, the row number of the square 
it moves to must be greater than the row number of the square it comes from. A regular red 
piece can only move up the grid. Kings of either color, of course, can move in both directions. 

One function of the CheckersData class is to take care of all the details of making moves 
on the board. An instance method named makeMove ( ) is provided to do this. When a player 
moves a piece from one square to another, the values stored at two positions in the array are 
changed. But that's not all. If the move is a jump, then the piece that was jumped is removed 
from the board. (The method checks whether the move is a jump by checking if the square to 
which the piece is moving is two rows away from the square where it starts.) Furthermore, a 
RED piece that moves to row or a BLACK piece that moves to row 7 becomes a king. This is 
good programming: the rest of the program doesn't have to worry about any of these details. 
It just calls this makeMove () method: 

/** 

* Make the move from (fromRow,fromCol) to (toRow,toCol) . It is 

* ASSUMED that this move is legal! If the move is a jump, the 

* jumped piece is removed from the board. If a piece moves 

* to the last row on the opponent's side of the board, the 

* piece becomes a king. 
*/ 

void makeMove (int fromRow, int fromCol, int toRow, int toCol) { 

board [toRow] [toCol] = board [fromRow] [fromCol] ; // Move the piece, 
board [fromRow] [fromCol] = EMPTY; 

if (fromRow - toRow == 2 I I fromRow - toRow == -2) { 

// The move is a jump. Remove the jumped piece from the board, 
int jumpRow = (fromRow + toRow) / 2; // Row of the jumped piece, 
int jumpCol = (fromCol + toCol) / 2; // Column of the jumped piece, 
board [jumpRow] [jumpCol] = EMPTY; 

} 

if (toRow == && board [toRow] [toCol] == RED) 

board [toRow] [toCol] = RED_KING; // Red piece becomes a king. 

if (toRow == 7 && board [toRow] [toCol] == BLACK) 

board [toRow] [toCol] = BLACK_KING; // Black piece becomes a king. 

} // end makeMove () 

An even more important function of the CheckersData class is to find legal moves on the 
board. In my program, a move in a Checkers game is represented by an object belonging to 
the following class: 

/** 

* A CheckersMove object represents a move in the game of 

* Checkers. It holds the row and column of the piece that is 

* to be moved and the row and column of the square to which 

* it is to be moved. (This class makes no guarantee that 

* the move is legal.) 
*/ 

private static class CheckersMove { 

int fromRow, fromCol; // Position of piece to be moved, 
int toRow, toCol; // Square it is to move to. 

CheckersMove (int rl, int cl, int r2, int c2) { 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



364 



// Constructor. Set the values of the instance variables. 
fromRow = rl; 
fromCol = cl; 
toRow = r2; 
toCol = c2; 

} 

boolean is Jump () { 

// Test whether this move is a jump. It is assumed that 
// the move is legal. In a jump, the piece moves two 
// rows. (In a regular move, it only moves one row.) 
return (fromRow - toRow == 2 I I fromRow - toRow == -2) ; 

} 

} // end class CheckersMove . 

The CheckersData class has an instance method which finds all the legal moves that are 
currently available for a specified player. This method is a function that returns an array 
of type CheckersMove[]. The array contains all the legal moves, represented as CheckersMove 
objects. The specification for this method reads 

/** 

* Return an array containing all the legal CheckersMoves 

* for the specified player on the current board. If the player 

* has no legal moves, null is returned. The value of player 

* should be one of the constants RED or BLACK; if not, null 

* is returned. If the returned value is non-null, it consists 

* entirely of jump moves or entirely of regular moves, since 

* if the player can jump, only jumps are legal moves. 
*/ 

CheckersMove [] getLegalMoves(int player) 
A brief pseudocode algorithm for the method is 

Start with an empty list of moves 

Find any legal jumps and add them to the list 

if there are no jumps: 

Find any other legal moves and add them to the list 
if the list is empty: 

return null 
else : 

return the list 

Now, what is this "list" ? We have to return the legal moves in an array. But since an array has 
a fixed size, we can't create the array until we know how many moves there are, and we don't 
know that until near the end of the method, after we've already made the list! A neat solution 
is to use an ArrayList instead of an array to hold the moves as we find them. In fact, I use an 
object defined by the parameterized type ArrayList<CheckersMove> so that the list is restricted 
to holding objects of type CheckersMove. As we add moves to the list, it will grow just as large 
as necessary. At the end of the method, we can create the array that we really want and copy 
the data into it: 

Let "moves" be an empty ArrayList<CheckersMove> 
Find any legal jumps and add them to moves 
if moves. size () is 0: 

Find any other legal moves and add them to moves 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



365 



if moves . size () is 0: 

return null 
else : 

Let moveArray be an array of CheckersMoves of length moves . size () 
Copy the contents of moves into moveArray 
return moveArray 

Now, how do we find the legal jumps or the legal moves? The information we need is in the 
board array, but it takes some work to extract it. We have to look through all the positions 
in the array and find the pieces that belong to the current player. For each piece, we have to 
check each square that it could conceivably move to, and check whether that would be a legal 
move. If we are looking for legal jumps, we want to look at squares that are two rows and 
two columns away from the piece. There are four squares to consider. Thus, the line in the 
algorithm that says "Find any legal jumps and add them to moves" expands to: 

For each row of the board: 

For each column of the board: 

if one of the player's pieces is at this location: 
if it is legal to jump to row + 2, column + 2 

add this move to moves 
if it is legal to jump to row - 2, column + 2 

add this move to moves 
if it is legal to jump to row + 2, column - 2 

add this move to moves 
if it is legal to jump to row - 2, column - 2 
add this move to moves 

The line that says "Find any other legal moves and add them to moves" expands to some- 
thing similar, except that we have to look at the four squares that are one column and one 
row away from the piece. Testing whether a player can legally move from one given square to 
another given square is itself non-trivial. The square the player is moving to must actually be 
on the board, and it must be empty. Furthermore, regular red and black pieces can only move 
in one direction. I wrote the following utility method to check whether a player can make a 
given non-jump move: 

/** 

* This is called by the getLegalMoves () method to determine 

* whether the player can legally move from (rl,cl) to (r2,c2). 

* It is ASSUMED that (rl.cl) contains one of the player's 

* pieces and that (r2,c2) is a neighboring square. 
*/ 

private boolean canMove(int player, int rl, int cl, int r2, int c2) { 

if (r2 < II r2 >= 8 II c2 < II c2 >= 8) 
return false; // (r2,c2) is off the board. 

if (board [r2] [c2] != EMPTY) 

return false; // (r2,c2) already contains a piece. 

if (player == RED) { 

if (board [rl] [cl] == RED && r2 > rl) 

return false; // Regular red piece can only move down, 
return true; // The move is legal. 

} 

else { 



CHAPTER 7. ARRAYS 



366 



if (board [rl] [cl] == BLACK && r2 < rl) 

return false; // Regular black piece can only move up. 
return true; // The move is legal. 

} 

} // end canMoveO 

This method is called by my getLegalMoves () method to check whether one of the possible 
moves that it has found is actually legal. I have a similar method that is called to check whether 
a jump is legal. In this case, I pass to the method the square containing the player's piece, 
the square that the player might move to, and the square between those two, which the player 
would be jumping over. The square that is being jumped must contain one of the opponent's 
pieces. This method has the specification: 

/** 

* This is called by other methods to check whether 

* the player can legally jump from (rl,cl) to (r3,c3). 

* It is assumed that the player has a piece at (rl,cl), that 

* (r3,c3) is a position that is 2 rows and 2 columns distant 

* from (rl,cl) and that (r2,c2) is the square between (rl,cl) 

* and (r3, c3) . 
*/ 

private boolean canJump(int player, int rl, int cl, 

int r2, int c2, int r3, int c3) { . . . 

Given all this, you should be in a position to understand the complete getLegalMoves () 
method. It's a nice way to finish off this chapter, since it combines several topics that we've 
looked at: one-dimensional arrays, ArrayLists, and two-dimensional arrays: 

CheckersMove [] getLegalMoves (int player) { 

if (player != RED && player != BLACK)

// Moves will be stored in this list. 

/* First, check for any possible jumps. Look at each square on

the moves ArrayList.

Exercises for Chapter 7 

1. An example in Subsection 7.2.4 tried to answer the question, How many random people do (solution) 
you have to select before you find a duplicate birthday? The source code for that program 

can be found in the file BirthdayProblemDemo.java. Here are some related questions: 

• How many random people do you have to select before you find three people who 
share the same birthday? (That is, all three people were born on the same day in 
the same month, but not necessarily in the same year.) 

• Suppose you choose 365 people at random. How many different birthdays will they 
have? (The number could theoretically be anywhere from 1 to 365). 

• How many different people do you have to check before you've found at least one 
person with a birthday on each of the 365 days of the year? 

Write three programs to answer these questions. Each of your programs should sim- 
ulate choosing people at random and checking their birthdays. (In each case, ignore the 
possibility of leap years.) 

2. Write a program that will read a sequence of positive real numbers entered by the user (solution) 
and will print the same numbers in sorted order from smallest to largest. The user will 

input a zero to mark the end of the input. Assume that at most 100 positive numbers will 
be entered. 

3. A polygon is a geometric figure made up of a sequence of connected line segments. The (solution) 
points where the line segments meet are called the vertices of the polygon. The Graph- 
ics class includes commands for drawing and filling polygons. For these commands, the 
coordinates of the vertices of the polygon are stored in arrays. If g is a variable of type 

Graphics then 

• g. drawPolygon(xCoords , yCoords , pointCt) will draw the outline of the polygon 
with vertices at the points (xCoords [0] , yCoords [0] ) , (xCoords [1] , yCoords [1] ) , 
. . . , (xCoords [pointCt-1] ,yCoords [pointCt-1] ) . The third parameter, pointCt, 
is an int that specifies the number of vertices of the polygon. Its value 
should be 3 or greater. The first two parameters are arrays of type 
int [] . Note that the polygon automatically includes a line from the last 
point, (xCoords [pointCt-1] , yCoords [pointCt-1] ) , back to the starting point 
(xCoords [0] , yCoords [0] ) . 

• g. f illPolygon(xCoords , yCoords, pointCt) fills the interior of the polygon with 
the current drawing color. The parameters have the same meaning as in the 
drawPolygonO method. Note that it is OK for the sides of the polygon to cross 
each other, but the interior of a polygon with self-intersections might not be exactly 
what you expect. 

Write a panel class that lets the user draw polygons, and use your panel as the content 
pane in an applet (or standalone application). As the user clicks a sequence of points, 
count them and store their x- and y-coordinates in two arrays. These points will be the 
vertices of the polygon. Also, draw a line between each consecutive pair of points to give 
the user some visual feedback. When the user clicks near the starting point, draw the 



Exercises 



369 



complete polygon. Draw it with a red interior and a black border. The user should then 
be able to start drawing a new polygon. When the user shift-clicks on the applet, clear it. 

For this exercise, there is no need to store information about the contents of the applet. 
Do the drawing directly in the mousePressedO routine, and use the getGraphics () 
method to get a Graphics object that you can use to draw the line. (Remember, though, 
that this is considered to be bad style.) You will not need a paintComponent () method, 
since the default action of filling the panel with its background color is good enough. 

Here is a picture of my solution after the user has drawn a few polygons: 



4. For this problem, you will need to use an array of objects. The objects belong to the class (solution) 
MovingBall, which I have already written. You can find the source code for this class in the 
file MovingBall.java. A MovingBall represents a circle that has an associated color, radius, 
direction, and speed. It is restricted to moving inside some rectangle in the (x,y) plane. 
It will "bounce back" when it hits one of the sides of this rectangle. A MovingBall does not 
actually move by itself. It's just a collection of data. You have to call instance methods to 
tell it to update its position and to draw itself. The constructor for the MovingBall class 
takes the form 

new MovingBall (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) 

where the parameters are integers that specify the limits on the x and y coordinates of 
the ball. (This sets the rectangle inside which the ball will stay.) In this exercise, you 
will want balls to bounce off the sides of the applet, so you will create them with the 
constructor call 

new MovingBall (0, getWidthO , 0, getHeight () ) 

The constructor creates a ball that initially is colored red, has a radius of 5 pixels, is 
located at the center of its range, has a random speed between 4 and 12, and is headed in 
a random direction. There is one problem here: You can't use this constructor until the 
width and height of the component are known. It would be OK to use it in the init() 
method of an applet, but not in the constructor of an applet or panel class. If you are using 
a panel class to display the ball, one slightly messy solution is to create the MovingBall 
objects in the panel's paintComponent () method the first time that method is called. You 





Exercises 



370 



can be sure that the size of the panel has been determined before paintComponent () is 
called. This is what I did in my own solution to this exercise. 

If ball is a variable of type MovingBall, then the following methods are available: 

• ball . draw (g) — draw the ball in a graphics context. The parameter, g, must be of 
type Graphics. (The drawing color in g will be changed to the color of the ball.) 

• ball . travel () — change the (x,y) -coordinates of the ball by an amount equal to 
its speed. The ball has a certain direction of motion, and the ball is moved in that 
direction. Ordinarily, you will call this once for each frame of an animation, so the 
speed is given in terms of "pixels per frame". Calling this routine does not move 
the ball on the screen. It just changes the values of some instance variables in the 
object. The next time the object's draw() method is called, the ball will be drawn 
in the new position. 

• ball.headTowards(x,y) — change the direction of motion of the ball so that it is 
headed towards the point (x,y). This does not affect the speed. 

These are the methods that you will need for this exercise. There are also methods for 
setting various properties of the ball, such as ball . setColor (color) for changing the 
color and ball . setRadius (radius) for changing its size. See the source code for more 
information. A nice variation on the exercise would be to use random colors and sizes for 
the balls. 

For this exercise, you should create an applet that shows an animation of balls bouncing 
around on a black background. Use a Timer to drive the animation. (See Subsection 6.5.1.) 
Use an array of type MovingBall [] to hold the data for the balls. In addition, your 
program should listen for mouse and mouse motion events. When the user presses the 
mouse or drags the mouse, call each of the ball's headTowards () methods to make the 
balls head towards the mouse's location. My solution uses 50 balls and a time delay of 50 
milliseconds for the timer. 

5. The sample program RandomArtPanel.java from Subsection 6.5.1 shows a different ran- (solution) 
dom "artwork" every four seconds. There are three types of "art", one made from lines, 
one from circles, and one from filled squares. However, the program does not save the data 
for the picture that is shown on the screen. As a result, the picture cannot be redrawn 
when necessary. In fact, every time paintComponent () is called, a new picture is drawn. 

Write a new version of RandomArtPanel.java that saves the data needed to redraw its 
pictures. The paintComponent () method should simply use the data to draw the picture. 
New data should be recomputed only every four seconds, in response to an event from the 
timer that drives the program. 

To make this interesting, write a separate class for each of the three different types of 
art. Also write an abstract class to serve as the common base class for the three classes. 
Since all three types of art use a random gray background, the background color can be 
defined in their superclass. The superclass also contains a draw() method that draws the 
picture; this is an abstract method because its implementation depends on the particular 
type of art that is being drawn. The abstract class can be defined as: 

private abstract class ArtData { 

Color backgroundColor ; // The background color for the art. 
ArtDataO { // Constructor sets background color to be a random gray, 
int x = (int) (256*Math.random()) ; 



Exercises 



371 



backgroundColor = new Color ( x, x, x ); 

> 

abstract void draw (Graphics g) ; // Draws this artwork. 

} 

Each of the three subclasses of ArtData must define its own draw() method. It must 
also define instance variables to hold the data necessary to draw the picture. I suggest 
that you should create random data for the picture in the constructor of the class, so that 
constructing the object will automatically create the data for the random artwork. (One 
problem with this is that you can't create the data until you know the size of the panel, 
so you can't create an ArtData object in the constructor of the panel. One solution is to 
create an ArtData object at the beginning of the paintComponent () method, if the object 
has not already been created.) In all three subclasses, you will need to use several arrays 
to store the data. 

The file RandomArtPanel.java only defines a panel class. A main program that uses 
this panel can be found in Random Art Java, and an applet that uses it can be found in 
RandomArtApplet.java. You only need to modify RandomArtPanel. 

6. Write a program that will read a text file selected by the user, and will make an alphabetical (solution) 
list of all the different words in that file. All words should be converted to lower case, and 
duplicates should be eliminated from the list. The list should be written to an output file 
selected by the user. As discussed in Subsection 2.4.5, you can use TextIO to read and write 
files. Use a variable of type Arrayl_ist<String> to store the words. (See Subsection 7.3.4.) 
It is not easy to separate a file into words as you are reading it. You can use the following 
method: 

/** 

* Read the next word from TextID, if there is one. First, skip past 

* any non-letters in the input. If an end-of-file is encountered before 

* a word is found, return null. Otherwise, read and return the word. 

* A word is defined as a sequence of letters. Also, a word can include 

* an apostrophe if the apostrophe is surrounded by letters on each side. 

* @return the next word from TextIO, or null if an end-of-file is 

* encountered 
*/ 

private static String readNextWordO { 

char ch = TextIO. peekO ; // Look at next character in input, 
while (ch != TextIO. EOF kk ! Character . isLetter(ch) ) { 
// Skip past non-letters. 
TextIO .getAnyChar () ; // Read the character, 
ch = TextIO .peekO ; // Look at the next character. 

> 

if (ch == TextIO. EOF) // Encountered end-of-file 
return null ; 

//At this point, we know the next character is a letter, so read a word. 
String word = " " ; // This will be the word that is read, 
while (true) { 

word += TextIO. get AnyChar () ; // Append the letter onto word. 

ch = TextIO .peekO ; // Look at next character. 

if ( ch == ' \ " ) { 

// The next character is an apostrophe. Read it, and 
// if the following character is a letter, add both the 



Exercises 



372 



// apostrophe and the letter onto the word and continue 
// reading the word. If the character after the apostrophe 
// is not a letter, the word is done, so break out of the loop. 
TextlO.getAnyCharO ; // Read the apostrophe. 

ch = TextIO .peekO ; // Look at char that follows apostrophe, 
if (Character . isLetter(ch) ) { 

word += "\>" + TextlO.getAnyCharO; 

ch = TextIO .peekO ; // Look at next char. 

> 

else 

break; 

} 

if ( ! Character . isLetter(ch) ) { 

//If the next character is not a letter, the word is 
// finished, so break out of the loop, 
break; 

} 

// If we haven't broken out of the loop, next char is a letter. 

} 

return word; // Return the word that has been read. 

} 

Note that this method will return null when the file has been entirely read. You can use 
this as a signal to stop processing the input file. 

7. The game of Go Moku (also known as Pente or Five Stones) is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe, (solution) 
except that it is played on a much larger board and the object is to get five squares in a 
row rather than three. Players take turns placing pieces on a board. A piece can be placed 
in any empty square. The first player to get five pieces in a row — horizontally, vertically, 
or diagonally — wins. If all squares are filled before either player wins, then the game is a 
draw. Write a program that lets two players play Go Moku against each other. 

Your program will be simpler than the Checkers program from Subsection 7.5.3. Play 
alternates strictly between the two players, and there is no need to highlight the legal 
moves. You will only need two classes, a short panel class to set up the interface and a 
Board class to draw the board and do all the work of the game. Nevertheless, you will 
probably want to look at the source code for the checkers program, Checkers.java, for 
ideas about the general outline of the program. 

The hardest part of the program is checking whether the move that a player makes is 
a winning move. To do this, you have to look in each of the four possible directions from 
the square where the user has placed a piece. You have to count how many pieces that 
player has in a row in that direction. If the number is five or more in any direction, then 
that player wins. As a hint, here is part of the code from my applet. This code counts 
the number of pieces that the user has in a row in a specified direction. The direction is 
specified by two integers, dirX and dirY. The values of these variables are 0, 1, or -1, and 
at least one of them is non-zero. For example, to look in the horizontal direction, dirX is 
1 and dirY is 0. 

int ct = 1 ; // Number of pieces in a row belonging to the player. 

int r , c ; //A row and column to be examined 

r = row + dirX; // Look at square in specified direction. 



Exercises

c = col + dirY; 

while ( r >= && r < 13 && c >= && c < 13 

&& board [r] [c] == player ) { 
// Square is on the board, and it 
// contains one of the players' pieces. 

ct++; 

r += dirX; // Go on to next square in this direction, 
c += dirY; 

} 

r = row - dirX; // Now, look in the opposite direction, 
c = col - dirY; 

while ( r >= && r < 13 && c >= && c < 13 

&& board [r] [c] == player ) { 

ct++; 

r -= dirX; // Go on to next square in this direction, 
c -= dirY; 

> 

Here is a picture of my program It uses a 13-by-13 board. You can do the same or use 
a normal 8-by-8 checkerboard.

Chapter 8 

Correctness, Robustness, Efficiency 



In PREVIOUS CHAPTERS, we have covered the fundamentals of programming. The chapters that 
follow this one will cover more advanced aspects of programming. The ideas that are presented 
will generally be more complex and the programs that use them a little more complicated. This 
relatively short chapter is a kind of turning point in which we look at the problem of getting 
such complex programs right. 

Computer programs that fail are much too common. Programs are fragile. A tiny error 
can cause a program to misbehave or crash. Most of us are familiar with this from our own 
experience with computers. And we've all heard stories about software glitches that cause 
spacecraft to crash, telephone service to fail, and, in a few cases, people to die. 

Programs don't have to be as bad as they are. It might well be impossible to guarantee 
that programs are problem-free, but careful programming and well-designed programming tools 
can help keep the problems to a minimum. This chapter will look at issues of correctness and 
robustness of programs. It also looks more closely at exceptions and the try. . catch statement, 
and it introduces assertions, another of the tools that Java provides as an aid in writing correct 
programs. 

We will also look at another issue that is important for programs in the real world: efficiency. 
Even a completely correct program is not very useful if it takes an unreasonable amount of 
time to run. The last section of this chapter introduces techniques for analyzing the run time 
of algorithms. 

8.1 Introduction to Correctness and Robustness 

A PROGRAM is correct if it accomplishes the task that it was designed to perform. It is robust (online) 

if it can handle illegal inputs and other unexpected situations in a reasonable way. For example, 

consider a program that is designed to read some numbers from the user and then print the 

same numbers in sorted order. The program is correct if it works for any set of input numbers. 

It is robust if it can also deal with non-numeric input by, for example, printing an error message 

and ignoring the bad input. A non-robust program might crash or give nonsensical output in 

the same circumstance. 

Every program should be correct. (A sorting program that doesn't sort correctly is pretty 
useless.) It's not the case that every program needs to be completely robust. It depends on 
who will use it and how it will be used. For example, a small utility program that you write 
for your own use doesn't have to be particularly robust. 

The question of correctness is actually more subtle than it might appear. A programmer 



376 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



377 



works from a specification of what the program is supposed to do. The programmer's work is 
correct if the program meets its specification. But does that mean that the program itself is 
correct? What if the specification is incorrect or incomplete? A correct program should be a 
correct implementation of a complete and correct specification. The question is whether the 
specification correctly expresses the intention and desires of the people for whom the program 
is being written. This is a question that lies largely outside the domain of computer science. 

8.1.1 Horror Stories 

Most computer users have personal experience with programs that don't work or that crash. In 
many cases, such problems are just annoyances, but even on a personal computer there can be 
more serious consequences, such as lost work or lost money. When computers are given more 
important tasks, the consequences of failure can be proportionately more serious. 

Just about a decade ago, the failure of two multi-million dollar space missions to Mars was 
prominent in the news. Both failures were probably due to software problems, but in both 
cases the problem was not with an incorrect program as such. In September 1999, the Mars 
Climate Orbiter burned up in the Martian atmosphere because data that was expressed in 
English units of measurement (such as feet and pounds) was entered into a computer program 
that was designed to use metric units (such as centimeters and grams). A few months later, 
the Mars Polar Lander probably crashed because its software turned off its landing engines too 
soon. The program was supposed to detect the bump when the spacecraft landed and turn 
off the engines then. It has been determined that deployment of the landing gear might have 
jarred the spacecraft enough to activate the program, causing it to turn off the engines when 
the spacecraft was still in the air. The unpowered spacecraft would then have fallen to the 
Martian surface. A more robust system would have checked the altitude before turning off the 
engines! 

There are many equally dramatic stories of problems caused by incorrect or poorly written 
software. Let's look at a few incidents recounted in the book Computer Ethics by Tom Forester 
and Perry Morrison. (This book covers various ethical issues in computing. It, or something 
like it, is essential reading for any student of computer science.) 

• In 1985 and 1986, one person was killed and several were injured by excess radiation, while 
undergoing radiation treatments by a mis-programmed computerized radiation machine. 
In another case, over a ten-year period ending in 1992, almost 1,000 cancer patients 
received radiation dosages that were 30% less than prescribed because of a programming 
error. 

• In 1985, a computer at the Bank of New York started destroying records of on-going 
security transactions because of an error in a program. It took less than 24 hours to fix 
the program, but by that time, the bank was out $5,000,000 in overnight interest payments 
on funds that it had to borrow to cover the problem. 

• The programming of the inertial guidance system of the F-16 fighter plane would have 
turned the plane upside-down when it crossed the equator, if the problem had not been 
discovered in simulation. The Mariner 18 space probe was lost because of an error in one 
line of a program. The Gemini V space capsule missed its scheduled landing target by 
a hundred miles, because a programmer forgot to take into account the rotation of the 
Earth. 

• In 1990, AT&T's long-distance telephone service was disrupted throughout the United 
States when a newly loaded computer program proved to contain a bug. 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY

Of course, there have been more recent problems. For example, computer software error 
contributed to the Northeast Blackout of 2003, one of the largest power outages in history. In 
2006, the Airbus A380 was delayed by software incompatibility problems, at a cost of perhaps 
billions of dollars. In 2007, a software problem grounded thousands of planes at the Los Angeles 
International Airport. On May 6, 2010, a flaw in an automatic trading program apparently 
resulted in a 1000-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 

These are just a few examples. Software problems are all too common. As programmers, 
we need to understand why that is true and what can be done about it. 

8.1.2 Java to the Rescue 

Part of the problem, according to the inventors of Java, can be traced to programming languages 
themselves. Java was designed to provide some protection against certain types of errors. How 
can a language feature help prevent errors? Let's look at a few examples. 

Early programming languages did not require variables to be declared. In such languages, 
when a variable name is used in a program, the variable is created automatically. You might 
consider this more convenient than having to declare every variable explicitly, but there is an 
unfortunate consequence: An inadvertent spelling error might introduce an extra variable that 
you had no intention of creating. This type of error was responsible, according to one famous 
story, for yet another lost spacecraft. In the FORTRAN programming language, the command "DO 
20 I = 1,5" is the first statement of a counting loop. Now, spaces are insignificant in FORTRAN, 
so this is equivalent to "D020I=1,5". On the other hand, the command "D020I=1.5", with a 
period instead of a comma, is an assignment statement that assigns the value 1 . 5 to the variable 
D020I. Supposedly, the inadvertent substitution of a period for a comma in a statement of this 
type caused a rocket to blow up on take-off. Because FORTRAN doesn't require variables to be 
declared, the compiler would be happy to accept the statement "D020I=1.5." It would just 
create a new variable named D020I. If FORTRAN required variables to be declared, the compiler 
would have complained that the variable D020I was undeclared. 

While most programming languages today do require variables to be declared, there are 
other features in common programming languages that can cause problems. Java has eliminated 
some of these features. Some people complain that this makes Java less efficient and less 
powerful. While there is some justice in this criticism, the increase in security and robustness is 
probably worth the cost in most circumstances. The best defense against some types of errors 
is to design a programming language in which the errors are impossible. In other cases, where 
the error can't be completely eliminated, the language can be designed so that when the error 
does occur, it will automatically be detected. This will at least prevent the error from causing 
further harm, and it will alert the programmer that there is a bug that needs fixing. Let's look 
at a few cases where the designers of Java have taken these approaches. 

An array is created with a certain number of locations, numbered from zero up to some 
specified maximum index. It is an error to try to use an array location that is outside of the 
specified range. In Java, any attempt to do so is detected automatically by the system. In some 
other languages, such as C and C++, it's up to the programmer to make sure that the index 
is within the legal range. Suppose that an array, A, has three locations, A [0] , A [1] , and A [2] . 
Then A [3] , A [4] , and so on refer to memory locations beyond the end of the array. In Java, 
an attempt to store data in A [3] will be detected. The program will be terminated (unless the 
error is "caught", as discussed in Section 3.7). In C or C++, the computer will just go ahead 
and store the data in memory that is not part of the array. Since there is no telling what that 
memory location is being used for, the result will be unpredictable. The consequences could 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



379 



be much more serious than a terminated program. (See, for example, the discussion of buffer 
overflow errors later in this section.) 

Pointers are a notorious source of programming errors. In Java, a variable of object type 
holds either a pointer to an object or the special value null. Any attempt to use a null value as 
if it were a pointer to an actual object will be detected by the system. In some other languages, 
again, it's up to the programmer to avoid such null pointer errors. In my old Macintosh 
computer, a null pointer was actually implemented as if it were a pointer to memory location 
zero. A program could use a null pointer to change values stored in memory near location zero. 
Unfortunately, the Macintosh stored important system data in those locations. Changing that 
data could cause the whole system to crash, a consequence more severe than a single failed 
program. 

Another type of pointer error occurs when a pointer value is pointing to an object of the 
wrong type or to a segment of memory that does not even hold a valid object at all. These 
types of errors are impossible in Java, which does not allow programmers to manipulate pointers 
directly. In other languages, it is possible to set a pointer to point, essentially, to any location 
in memory. If this is done incorrectly, then using the pointer can have unpredictable results. 

Another type of error that cannot occur in Java is a memory leak. In Java, once there are 
no longer any pointers that refer to an object, that object is "garbage collected" so that the 
memory that it occupied can be reused. In other languages, it is the programmer's responsibility 
to return unused memory to the system. If the programmer fails to do this, unused memory 
can build up, leaving less memory for programs and data. There is a story that many common 
programs for older Windows computers had so many memory leaks that the computer would 
run out of memory after a few days of use and would have to be restarted. 

Many programs have been found to suffer from buffer overflow errors. Buffer overflow 
errors often make the news because they are responsible for many network security problems. 
When one computer receives data from another computer over a network, that data is stored in 
a buffer. The buffer is just a segment of memory that has been allocated by a program to hold 
data that it expects to receive. A buffer overflow occurs when more data is received than will 
fit in the buffer. The question is, what happens then? If the error is detected by the program 
or by the networking software, then the only thing that has happened is a failed network 
data transmission. The real problem occurs when the software does not properly detect buffer 
overflows. In that case, the software continues to store data in memory even after the buffer is 
filled, and the extra data goes into some part of memory that was not allocated by the program 
as part of the buffer. That memory might be in use for some other purpose. It might contain 
important data. It might even contain part of the program itself. This is where the real security 
issues come in. Suppose that a buffer overflow causes part of a program to be replaced with 
extra data received over a network. When the computer goes to execute the part of the program 
that was replaced, it's actually executing data that was received from another computer. That 
data could be anything. It could be a program that crashes the computer or takes it over. A 
malicious programmer who finds a convenient buffer overflow error in networking software can 
try to exploit that error to trick other computers into executing his programs. 

For software written completely in Java, buffer overflow errors are impossible. The language 
simply does not provide any way to store data into memory that has not been properly allocated. 
To do that, you would need a pointer that points to unallocated memory or you would have 
to refer to an array location that lies outside the range allocated for the array. As explained 
above, neither of these is possible in Java. (However, there could conceivably still be errors in 
Java's standard classes, since some of the methods in these classes are actually written in the 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



380 



C programming language rather than in Java.) 

It's clear that language design can help prevent errors or detect them when they occur. 
Doing so involves restricting what a programmer is allowed to do. Or it requires tests, such as 
checking whether a pointer is null, that take some extra processing time. Some programmers 
feel that the sacrifice of power and efficiency is too high a price to pay for the extra security. In 
some applications, this is true. However, there are many situations where safety and security 
are primary considerations. Java is designed for such situations. 

8.1.3 Problems Remain in Java 

There is one area where the designers of Java chose not to detect errors automatically: numerical 
computations. In Java, a value of type int is represented as a 32-bit binary number. With 32 
bits, it's possible to represent a little over four billion different values. The values of type int 
range from -2147483648 to 2147483647. What happens when the result of a computation lies 
outside this range? For example, what is 2147483647 + 1? And what is 2000000000 * 2? The 
mathematically correct result in each case cannot be represented as a value of type int. These 
are examples of integer overflow . In most cases, integer overflow should be considered an 
error. However, Java does not automatically detect such errors. For example, it will compute 
the value of 2147483647 + 1 to be the negative number, -2147483648. (What happens is 
that any extra bits beyond the 32-nd bit in the correct answer are discarded. Values greater 
than 2147483647 will "wrap around" to negative values. Mathematically speaking, the result 
is always "correct modulo 2 32 .") 

For example, consider the 3N+1 program, which was discussed in Subsection 3.2.2. Starting 
from a positive integer N, the program computes a certain sequence of integers: 

while ( N != 1 ) { 

if ( N % 2 == ) // If N is even. . . 

N = N / 2; 
else 

N = 3 * N + 1; 
System. out .println(N) ; 

} 

But there is a problem here: If N is too large, then the value of 3*N+1 will not be mathematically 
correct because of integer overflow. The problem arises whenever 3* N+l > 2147483647, that is 
when N > 2147483646/3. For a completely correct program, we should check for this possibility 
before computing 3*N+1: 

while ( N != 1 ) { 

if ( N % 2 == ) // If N is even. . . 

N = N / 2; 
else { 

if (N > 2147483646/3) { 

System. out .println ("Sorry , but the value of N has become"); 
System. out .println ("too large for your computer!"); 
break; 

} 

N = 3 * N + 1; 

> 

System. out .println(N) ; 

} 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



381 



The problem here is not that the original algorithm for computing 3N+1 sequences was 
wrong. The problem is that it just can't be correctly implemented using 32-bit integers. Many 
programs ignore this type of problem. But integer overflow errors have been responsible for their 
share of serious computer failures, and a completely robust program should take the possibility 
of integer overflow into account. (The infamous "Y2K" bug was, in fact, just this sort of error.) 

For numbers of type double, there are even more problems. There are still overflow er- 
rors, which occur when the result of a computation is outside the range of values that can be 
represented as a value of type double. This range extends up to about 1.7 times 10 to the 
power 308. Numbers beyond this range do not "wrap around" to negative values. Instead, they 
are represented by special values that have no real numerical equivalent. The special values 
Double. POSITIVE.INFIMITY and Double . NEGATIVE_INFINITY represent numbers outside the 
range of legal values. For example, 20 * le308 is computed to be Double . POSITIVE_INFINITY. 
Another special value of type double, Double. NaN, represents an illegal or undefined result. 
("NaN" stands for "Not a Number".) For example, the result of dividing zero by zero or taking 
the square root of a negative number is Double . NaN. You can test whether a number x is this 
special not-a-number value by calling the boolean-valued function Double . isNaN(x) . 

For real numbers, there is the added complication that most real numbers can only be 
represented approximately on a computer. A real number can have an infinite number of digits 
after the decimal point. A value of type double is only accurate to about 15 digits. The real 
number 1/3, for example, is the repeating decimal 0.333333333333. . ., and there is no way to 
represent it exactly using a finite number of digits. Computations with real numbers generally 
involve a loss of accuracy. In fact, if care is not exercised, the result of a large number of such 
computations might be completely wrong! There is a whole field of computer science, known as 
numerical analysis, which is devoted to studying algorithms that manipulate real numbers. 

So you see that not all possible errors are avoided or detected automatically in Java. Fur- 
thermore, even when an error is detected automatically, the system's default response is to 
report the error and terminate the program. This is hardly robust behavior! So, a Java pro- 
grammer still needs to learn techniques for avoiding and dealing with errors. These are the 
main topics of the next three sections. 

8.2 Writing Correct Programs 

Correct programs don't just happen. It takes planning and attention to detail to avoid (online) 
errors in programs. There are some techniques that programmers can use to increase the 
likelihood that their programs are correct. 

8.2.1 Provably Correct Programs 

In some cases, it is possible to prove that a program is correct. That is, it is possible to 
demonstrate mathematically that the sequence of computations represented by the program 
will always produce the correct result. Rigorous proof is difficult enough that in practice it can 
only be applied to fairly small programs. Furthermore, it depends on the fact that the "correct 
result" has been specified correctly and completely. As I've already pointed out, a program 
that correctly meets its specification is not useful if its specification was wrong. Nevertheless, 
even in everyday programming, we can apply some of the ideas and techniques that are used 
in proving that programs are correct. 

The fundamental ideas are process and state. A state consists of all the information 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



382 



relevant to the execution of a program at a given moment during its execution. The state 
includes, for example, the values of all the variables in the program, the output that has been 
produced, any input that is waiting to be read, and a record of the position in the program 
where the computer is working. A process is the sequence of states that the computer goes 
through as it executes the program. From this point of view, the meaning of a statement in a 
program can be expressed in terms of the effect that the execution of that statement has on the 
computer's state. As a simple example, the meaning of the assignment statement "x = 7;" is 
that after this statement is executed, the value of the variable x will be 7. We can be absolutely 
sure of this fact, so it is something upon which we can build part of a mathematical proof. 

In fact, it is often possible to look at a program and deduce that some fact must be true at 
a given point during the execution of a program. For example, consider the do loop: 

do { 

TextIO .put ("Enter a positive integer: "); 
N = TextIO. getlnlnt () ; 
> while (N <= 0); 

After this loop ends, we can be absolutely sure that the value of the variable N is greater than 
zero. The loop cannot end until this condition is satisfied. This fact is part of the meaning of 
the while loop. More generally, if a while loop uses the test "while ((condition))" , then 
after the loop ends, we can be sure that the (condition) is false. We can then use this fact to 
draw further deductions about what happens as the execution of the program continues. (With 
a loop, by the way, we also have to worry about the question of whether the loop will ever end. 
This is something that has to be verified separately.) 

A fact that can be proven to be true after a given program segment has been executed 
is called a postcondition of that program segment. Postconditions are known facts upon 
which we can build further deductions about the behavior of the program. A postcondition 
of a program as a whole is simply a fact that can be proven to be true after the program has 
finished executing. A program can be proven to be correct by showing that the postconditions 
of the program meet the program's specification. 

Consider the following program segment, where all the variables are of type double: 

disc = B*B - 4*A*C; 

x = (-B + Math. sqrt (disc)) / (2*A) ; 

The quadratic formula (from high-school mathematics) assures us that the value assigned to x 
is a solution of the equation A*x 2 + B*x + C = 0, provided that the value of disc is greater 
than or equal to zero and the value of A is not zero. If we can assume or guarantee that 
B*B-4*A*C >= and that A ! = 0, then the fact that x is a solution of the equation becomes 
a postcondition of the program segment. We say that the condition, B*B-4*A*C >= is a 
precondition of the program segment. The condition that A ! = is another precondition. A 
precondition is defined to be a condition that must be true at a given point in the execution 
of a program in order for the program to continue correctly. A precondition is something that 
you want to be true. It's something that you have to check or force to be true, if you want your 
program to be correct. 

We've encountered preconditions and postconditions once before, in Subsection 4.6.1. That 
section introduced preconditions and postconditions as a way of specifying the contract of 
a subroutine. As the terms are being used here, a precondition of a subroutine is just a 
precondition of the code that makes up the definition of the subroutine, and the postcondition 
of a subroutine is a postcondition of the same code. In this section, we have generalized these 
terms to make them more useful in talking about program correctness. 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



383 



Let's see how this works by considering a longer program segment: 
do { 

Text 10. put In ( "Enter A, B, and C. B*B-4*A*C must be >= 0."); 

TextlO.putO'A = "); 

A = TextlO.getlnDoubleO ; 

TextlO.putO'B = "); 

B = TextlO.getlnDoubleO; 

TextlO.putC'C = ") ; 

C = TextlO.getlnDoubleO; 

if (A == II B*B - 4*A*C < 0) 

TextlO.putlnC'Your input is illegal. Try again."); 
> while (A == II B*B - 4*A*C < 0) ; 

disc = B*B - 4*A*C; 

x = (-B + Math. sqrt (disc)) / (2*A) ; 

After the loop ends, we can be sure that B*B-4*A*C >= and that A != 0. The preconditions 
for the last two lines are fulfilled, so the postcondition that x is a solution of the equation A*x 2 
+ B*x + C = is also valid. This program segment correctly and provably computes a solution 
to the equation. (Actually, because of problems with representing numbers on computers, this 
is not 100% true. The algorithm is correct, but the program is not a perfect implementation 
of the algorithm. See the discussion in Subsection 8.1.3.) 

Here is another variation, in which the precondition is checked by an if statement. In the 
first part of the if statement, where a solution is computed and printed, we know that the 
preconditions are fulfilled. In the other parts, we know that one of the preconditions fails to 
hold. In any case, the program is correct. 

TextIO .putlnC'Enter your values for A, B, and C."); 

TextlO.putO'A = ") ; 

A = TextlO.getlnDoubleO; 

TextIO. put ("B = ") ; 

B = TextlO.getlnDoubleO; 

TextlO.putC'C = ") ; 

C = TextlO.getlnDoubleO; 

if (A != && B*B - 4*A*C >= 0) { 
disc = B*B - 4*A*C; 
x = (-B + Math. sqrt (disc)) / (2*A) ; 

TextIO. putlnC'A solution of A*X*X + B*X + C = is " + x) ; 

} 

else if (A == 0) { 

TextIO .put In ("The value of A cannot be zero."); 

} 

else { 

TextIO. putlnC'Since B*B - 4*A*C is less than zero, the"); 
TextIO. putlnC'equation A*X*X + B*X + C = has no solution."); 

} 

Whenever you write a program, it's a good idea to watch out for preconditions and think 
about how your program handles them. Often, a precondition can offer a clue about how to 
write the program. 

For example, every array reference, such as A [i] , has a precondition: The index must 
be within the range of legal indices for the array. For A[i], the precondition is that <= i 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



384 



< A . length. The computer will check this condition when it evaluates A [i] , and if the condition 
is not satisfied, the program will be terminated. In order to avoid this, you need to make sure 
that the index has a legal value. (There is actually another precondition, namely that A is not 
null, but let's leave that aside for the moment.) Consider the following code, which searches 
for the number x in the array A and sets the value of i to be the index of the array element 
that contains x: 

i = 0; 

while (A[i] != x) { 
i++; 

} 

As this program segment stands, it has a precondition, namely that x is actually in the array. 
If this precondition is satisfied, then the loop will end when A[i] == x. That is, the value of 
i when the loop ends will be the position of x in the array. However, if x is not in the array, 
then the value of i will just keep increasing until it is equal to A. length. At that time, the 
reference to A [i] is illegal and the program will be terminated. To avoid this, we can add a 
test to make sure that the precondition for referring to A[i] is satisfied: 

i = 0; 

while (i < A. length && A[i] != x) { 
i++; 

} 

Now, the loop will definitely end. After it ends, i will satisfy either i == A. length or 
A [i] == x. An if statement can be used after the loop to test which of these conditions 
caused the loop to end: 

i = 0; 

while (i < A. length && A[i] != x) { 
i++; 

} 

if (i == A. length) 

System. out .printlnC'x is not in the array"); 
else 

System. out .printlnC'x is in position " + i) ; 
8.2.2 Robust Handling of Input 

One place where correctness and robustness are important — and especially difficult — is in the 
processing of input data, whether that data is typed in by the user, read from a file, or received 
over a network. Files and networking will be covered in Chapter 11, which will make essential 
use of material that will be covered in the next section of this chapter. For now, let's look at 
an example of processing user input. 

Examples in this textbook use my TextIO class for reading input from the user. This class 
has built-in error handling. For example, the function TextIO. getDoubleO is guaranteed to 
return a legal value of type double. If the user types an illegal value, then TextIO will ask 
the user to re-enter their response; your program never sees the illegal value. However, this 
approach can be clumsy and unsatisfactory, especially when the user is entering complex data. 
In the following example, I'll do my own error-checking. 

Sometimes, it's useful to be able to look ahead at what's coming up in the input without 
actually reading it. For example, a program might need to know whether the next item in 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



385 



the input is a number or a word. For this purpose, the TextIO class includes the function 
TextID .peek() . This function returns a char which is the next character in the user's input, 
but it does not actually read that character. If the next thing in the input is an end-of-line, 
then TextIO .peek() returns the new-line character, '\n'. 

Often, what we really need to know is the next non-blank character in the user's input. 
Before we can test this, we need to skip past any spaces (and tabs). Here is a function that does 
this. It uses TextID .peek () to look ahead, and it reads characters until the next character in the 
input is either an end-of-line or some non-blank character. (The function TextIO . getAnyChar () 
reads and returns the next character in the user's input, even if that character is a space. By 
contrast, the more common TextIO . getChar () would skip any blanks and then read and return 
the next non-blank character. We can't use TextIO .getCharQ here since the object is to skip 
the blanks without reading the next non-blank character.) 

/** 

* Reads past any blanks and tabs in the input . 

* Postcondition: The next character in the input is an 

* end-of-line or a non-blank character. 
*/ 

static void skipBlanksO { 
char ch ; 

ch = TextIO .peekO ; 

while (ch == ' ' II ch == ' \t ' ) { 

// Next character is a space or tab; read it 
// and look at the character that follows it. 
ch = TextlO.getAnyCharO ; 
ch = TextIO .peekO ; 

} 

} // end skipBlanksO 

(In fact, this operation is so common that it is built into the most recent version of TextIO. The 
method TextIO . skipBlanks () does essentially the same thing as the skipBlanksO method 
presented here.) 

An example in Subsection 3.5.3 allowed the user to enter length measurements such as "3 
miles" or "1 foot". It would then convert the measurement into inches, feet, yards, and miles. 
But people commonly use combined measurements such as "3 feet 7 inches". Let's improve the 
program so that it allows inputs of this form. 

More specifically, the user will input lines containing one or more measurements such as "1 
foot" or "3 miles 20 yards 2 feet". The legal units of measure are inch, foot, yard, and mile. 
The program will also recognize plurals (inches, feet, yards, miles) and abbreviations (in, ft, 
yd, mi). Let's write a subroutine that will read one line of input of this form and compute 
the equivalent number of inches. The main program uses the number of inches to compute the 
equivalent number of feet, yards, and miles. If there is any error in the input, the subroutine 
will print an error message and return the value -1. The subroutine assumes that the input 
line is not empty. The main program tests for this before calling the subroutine and uses an 
empty line as a signal for ending the program. 

Ignoring the possibility of illegal inputs, a pseudocode algorithm for the subroutine is 

inches =0 // This will be the total number of inches 
while there is more input on the line : 

read the numerical measurement 

read the units of measure 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



386 



add the measurement to inches 
return inches 

We can test whether there is more input on the line by checking whether the next non-blank 
character is the end-of-line character. But this test has a precondition: Before we can test the 
next non-blank character, we have to skip over any blanks. So, the algorithm becomes 

inches = 
skipBlanks () 

while TextIO .peekO is not '\n': 

read the numerical measurement 

read the unit of measure 

add the measurement to inches 

skipBlanks () 
return inches 

Note the call to skipBlanks () at the end of the while loop. This subroutine must be executed 
before the computer returns to the test at the beginning of the loop. More generally, if the test 
in a while loop has a precondition, then you have to make sure that this precondition holds at 
the end of the while loop, before the computer jumps back to re-evaluate the test, as well as 
before the start of the loop. 

What about error checking? Before reading the numerical measurement, we have to make 
sure that there is really a number there to read. Before reading the unit of measure, we have 
to test that there is something there to read. (The number might have been the last thing on 
the line. An input such as "3", without a unit of measure, is not acceptable.) Also, we have to 
check that the unit of measure is one of the valid units: inches, feet, yards, or miles. Here is 
an algorithm that includes error-checking: 

inches = 
skipBlanks () 

while TextIO .peekO is not '\n': 

if the next character is not a digit : 

report an error and return -1 
Let measurement = TextIO. getDouble () ; 

skipBlanksO // Precondition for the next test!! 
if the next character is end-of-line: 

report an error and return -1 
Let units = TextIO . getWordO 

if the units are inches: 

add measurement to inches 
else if the units are feet: 

add 12*measurement to inches 
else if the units are yards: 

add 36*measurement to inches 
else if the units are miles: 

add 12*5280*measurement to inches 

else 

report an error and return -1 
skipBlanks () 
return inches 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



387 



As you can see, error-testing adds significantly to the complexity of the algorithm. Yet 
this is still a fairly simple example, and it doesn't even handle all the possible errors. For 
example, if the user enters a numerical measurement such as le400 that is outside the legal 
range of values of type double, then the program will fall back on the default error-handling 
in TextlO. Something even more interesting happens if the measurement is "le308 miles" . The 
number le308 is legal, but the corresponding number of inches is outside the legal range of 
values for type double. As mentioned in the previous section, the computer will get the value 
Double. POSITIVE.INFINITY when it does the computation. 

Here is the subroutine written out in Java: 

/** 

* Reads the user's input measurement from one line of input. 

* Precondition: The input line is not empty. 

* Postcondition: If the user's input is legal, the measurement 

* is converted to inches and returned. If the 

* input is not legal, the value -1 is returned. 

* The end-of-line is NOT read by this routine. 
*/ 

static double readMeasurement () { 

double inches; // Total number of inches in user's measurement. 

double measurement ; / / One measurement , 

// such as the 12 in "12 miles" 
String units; // The units specified for the measurement, 

// such as "miles" 

char ch; // Used to peek at next character in the user's input. 

inches =0; //No inches have yet been read. 

skipBlanks () ; 

ch = TextlO .peekO ; 

/* As long as there is more input on the line, read a measurement and 
add the equivalent number of inches to the variable, inches. If an 
error is detected during the loop, end the subroutine immediately 
by returning -1 . */ 

while (ch != '\n') { 

/* Get the next measurement and the units. Before reading 

anything, make sure that a legal value is there to read. */ 

if ( ! Character . isDigit (ch) ) {

}

8.3 Exceptions and try.. catch 

Getting a PROGRAM to WORK under ideal circumstances is usually a lot easier than making (online) 
the program robust. A robust program can survive unusual or "exceptional" circumstances 
without crashing. One approach to writing robust programs is to anticipate the problems that 
might arise and to include tests in the program for each possible problem. For example, a 
program will crash if it tries to use an array element A [i] , when i is not within the declared 
range of indices for the array A. A robust program must anticipate the possibility of a bad index 
and guard against it. One way to do this is to write the program in a way that ensures (as a 
postcondition of the code that precedes the array reference) that the index is in the legal range. 
Another way is to test whether the index value is legal before using it in the array. This could 
be done with an if statement: 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



389 



if (i < I I i >= A. length) { 

... //Do something to handle the out-of -range index, i 

} 

else { 

... // Process the array element, A[i] 

} 

There are some problems with this approach. It is difficult and sometimes impossible to an- 
ticipate all the possible things that might go wrong. It's not always clear what to do when an 
error is detected. Furthermore, trying to anticipate all the possible problems can turn what 
would otherwise be a straightforward program into a messy tangle of if statements. 

8.3.1 Exceptions and Exception Classes 

We have already seen in Section 3.7 that Java (like its cousin, C++) provides a neater, more 
structured alternative technique for dealing with errors that can occur while a program is 
running. The technique is referred to as exception handling. The word "exception" is meant 
to be more general than "error." It includes any circumstance that arises as the program is 
executed which is meant to be treated as an exception to the normal flow of control of the 
program. An exception might be an error, or it might just be a special case that you would 
rather not have clutter up your elegant algorithm. 

When an exception occurs during the execution of a program, we say that the exception 
is thrown. When this happens, the normal flow of the program is thrown off-track, and the 
program is in danger of crashing. However, the crash can be avoided if the exception is caught 
and handled in some way. An exception can be thrown in one part of a program and caught 
in a different part. An exception that is not caught will generally cause the program to crash. 
(More exactly, the thread that throws the exception will crash. In a multithreaded program, 
it is possible for other threads to continue even after one crashes. We will cover threads in 
Chapter 12. In particular, GUI programs are multithreaded, and parts of the program might 
continue to function even while other parts are non- functional because of exceptions.) 

By the way, since Java programs are executed by a Java interpreter, having a program 
crash simply means that it terminates abnormally and prematurely. It doesn't mean that 
the Java interpreter will crash. In effect, the interpreter catches any exceptions that are not 
caught by the program. The interpreter responds by terminating the program. In many other 
programming languages, a crashed program will sometimes crash the entire system and freeze 
the computer until it is restarted. With Java, such system crashes should be impossible — which 
means that when they happen, you have the satisfaction of blaming the system rather than 
your own program. 

Exceptions were introduced in Section 3.7, along with the try. .catch statement, which is 
used to catch and handle exceptions. However, that section did not cover the complete syntax 
of try. . catch or the full complexity of exceptions. In this section, we cover these topics in full 
detail. 

* * * 

When an exception occurs, the thing that is actually "thrown" is an object. This object 
can carry information (in its instance variables) from the point where the exception occurs to 
the point where it is caught and handled. This information always includes the subroutine 
call stack, which is a list of the subroutines that were being executed when the exception was 
thrown. (Since one subroutine can call another, several subroutines can be active at the same 
time.) Typically, an exception object also includes an error message describing what happened 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



390 



to cause the exception, and it can contain other data as well. All exception objects must belong 
to a subclass of the standard class java.lang.Throwable. In general, each different type of 
exception is represented by its own subclass of Throwable, and these subclasses are arranged in 
a fairly complex class hierarchy that shows the relationship among various types of exception. 
Throwable has two direct subclasses, Error and Exception. These two subclasses in turn have 
many other predefined subclasses. In addition, a programmer can create new exception classes 
to represent new types of exception. 

Most of the subclasses of the class Error represent serious errors within the Java virtual 
machine that should ordinarily cause program termination because there is no reasonable way 
to handle them. In general, you should not try to catch and handle such errors. An example is 
a ClassFormatError, which occurs when the Java virtual machine finds some kind of illegal data 
in a file that is supposed to contain a compiled Java class. If that class was being loaded as 
part of the program, then there is really no way for the program to proceed. 

On the other hand, subclasses of the class Exception represent exceptions that are meant 
to be caught. In many cases, these are exceptions that might naturally be called "errors," but 
they are errors in the program or in input data that a programmer can anticipate and possibly 
respond to in some reasonable way. (However, you should avoid the temptation of saying, "Well, 
I'll just put a thing here to catch all the errors that might occur, so my program won't crash." 
If you don't have a reasonable way to respond to the error, it's best just to let the program 
crash, because trying to go on will probably only lead to worse things down the road — in the 
worst case, a program that gives an incorrect answer without giving you any indication that 
the answer might be wrong!) 

The class Exception has its own subclass, RuntimeException. This class groups together 
many common exceptions, including all those that have been covered in previous sections. For 
example, HlegalArgumentException and NullPointerException are subclasses of RuntimeException. 
A RuntimeException generally indicates a bug in the program, which the programmer should 
fix. RuntimeExceptions and Errors share the property that a program can simply ignore the 
possibility that they might occur. ("Ignoring" here means that you are content to let your 
program crash if the exception occurs.) For example, a program does this every time it uses 
an array reference like A [i] without making arrangements to catch a possible ArraylndexOut- 
OfBoundsException. For all other exception classes besides Error, RuntimeException, and their 
subclasses, exception-handling is "mandatory" in a sense that I'll discuss below. 

The following diagram is a class hierarchy showing the class Throwable and just a few of 
its subclasses. Classes that require mandatory exception-handling are shown in italic: 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



391 



Throwable 



Error 



RuntimeException 




EOFException SocketException 



Array IndexOutOfBoundsException 



IllegalArgumentException 



NumberfFormatException 



The class "Throwable" 
and some of 
its subclasses. 



The class Throwable includes several instance methods that can be used with any exception 
object. If e is of type Throwable (or one of its subclasses), then e .getMessageO is a function 
that returns a String that describes the exception. The function e .toStringO , which is used 
by the system whenever it needs a string representation of the object, returns a String that 
contains the name of the class to which the exception belongs as well as the same string that 
would be returned by e . getMessage () . And the method e .printStackTraceO writes a stack 
trace to standard output that tells which subroutines were active when the exception occurred. 
A stack trace can be very useful when you are trying to determine the cause of the problem. 
(Note that if an exception is not caught by the program, then the default response to the 
exception prints the stack trace to standard output.) 



8.3.2 The try Statement 

To catch exceptions in a Java program, you need a try statement. We have been using such 
statements since Section 3.7, but the full syntax of the try statement is more complicated than 
what was presented there. The try statements that we have used so far had a syntax similar 
to the following example: 

try { 

double determinant = M[0] [0]*M[1] [1] - M[0] [1]*M[1] [0] ; 
System. out .println( "The determinant of M is " + determinant); 

} 

catch ( ArraylndexOutOf BoundsException e ) { 

System. out .printlnC'M is the wrong size to have a determinant."); 
e .printStackTraceO ; 

} 

Here, the computer tries to execute the block of statements following the word "try" . If no 
exception occurs during the execution of this block, then the "catch" part of the statement 
is simply ignored. However, if an exception of type ArraylndexOutOfBoundsException occurs, 
then the computer jumps immediately to the catch clause of the try statement. This block 
of statements is said to be an exception handler for ArraylndexOutOfBoundsException. By 
handling the exception in this way, you prevent it from crashing the program. Before the body 
of the catch clause is executed, the object that represents the exception is assigned to the 
variable e, which is used in this example to print a stack trace. 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



392 



However, the full syntax of the try statement allows more than one catch clause. This 
makes it possible to catch several different types of exception with one try statement. In the 
above example, in addition to the possible ArraylndexOutOfBoundsException, there is a possible 
NullPointerException which will occur if the value of M is null. We can handle both possible 
exceptions by adding a second catch clause to the try statement: 

try { 

double determinant = M[0] [0]*M[1] [1] - M[0] [1]*M[1] [0] ; 
System. out .println( "The determinant of M is " + determinant); 

} 

catch ( ArraylndexOutOfBoundsException e ) { 

System. out .printlnC'M is the wrong size to have a determinant."); 

} 

catch ( NullPointerException e ) { 

System. out .print ("Programming error! M doesn't exist." + ); 

} 

Here, the computer tries to execute the statements in the try clause. If no error occurs, both 
of the catch clauses are skipped. If an ArraylndexOutOfBoundsException occurs, the computer 
executes the body of the first catch clause and skips the second one. If a NullPointerException 
occurs, it jumps to the second catch clause and executes that. 

Note that both ArraylndexOutOfBoundsException and NullPointerException are subclasses of 
RuntimeException. It's possible to catch all RuntimeExceptions with a single catch clause. For 
example: 

try { 

double determinant = M[0] [0]*M[1] [1] - M[0] [1]*M[1] [0] ; 
System. out .println( "The determinant of M is " + determinant); 

} 

catch ( RuntimeException err ) { 

System. out .printlnC'Sorry, an error has occurred."); 
System. out .println( "The error was: " + err); 

} 

The catch clause in this try statement will catch any exception belonging to class RuntimeEx- 
ception or to any of its subclasses. This shows why exception classes are organized into a class 
hierarchy. It allows you the option of casting your net narrowly to catch only a specific type 
of exception. Or you can cast your net widely to catch a wide class of exceptions. Because 
of subclassing, when there are multiple catch clauses in a try statement, it is possible that a 
given exception might match several of those catch clauses. For example, an exception of type 
NullPointerException would match catch clauses for NullPointerException, RuntimeException, 
Exception, or Throwable. In this case, only the first catch clause that matches the exception 
is executed. 

The example I've given here is not particularly realistic. You are not very likely to use 
exception- handling to guard against null pointers and bad array indices. This is a case where 
careful programming is better than exception handling: Just be sure that your program assigns 
a reasonable, non-null value to the array M. You would certainly resent it if the designers of 
Java forced you to set up a try. .catch statement every time you wanted to use an array! 
This is why handling of potential RuntimeExceptions is not mandatory. There are just too 
many things that might go wrong! (This also shows that exception-handling does not solve 
the problem of program robustness. It just gives you a tool that will in many cases let you 
approach the problem in a more organized way.) 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



393 



* * * 

I have still not completely specified the syntax of the try statement. There is one additional 
element: the possibility of a finally clause at the end of a try statement. The complete syntax 
of the try statement can be described as: 

try { 

{statements ) 

y 

(optional-catch-clauses ) 
(opt zonal- final ly-clause ) 

Note that the catch clauses are also listed as optional. The try statement can include zero or 
more catch clauses and, optionally, a finally clause. The try statement must include one 
or the other. That is, a try statement can have either a finally clause, or one or more catch 
clauses, or both. The syntax for a catch clause is 

catch ( (exception-class-name) (variable-name) ) { 
(statements ) 

y 

and the syntax for a finally clause is 

finally { 

(statements ) 

y 

The semantics of the finally clause is that the block of statements in the finally clause is 
guaranteed to be executed as the last step in the execution of the try statement, whether or not 
any exception occurs and whether or not any exception that does occur is caught and handled. 
The finally clause is meant for doing essential cleanup that under no circumstances should 
be omitted. One example of this type of cleanup is closing a network connection. Although 
you don't yet know enough about networking to look at the actual programming in this case, 
we can consider some pseudocode: 

try { 

open a network connection 

} 

catch ( IDException e ) { 
report the error 

return // Don't continue if connection can't be opened! 

} 

// At this point, we KNOW that the connection is open, 
try { 

communicate over the connection 

} 

catch ( IDException e ) { 
handle the error 

} 

finally { 

close the connection 

} 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



394 



The finally clause in the second try statement ensures that the network connection will 
definitely be closed, whether or not an error occurs during the communication. The first try 
statement is there to make sure that we don't even try to communicate over the network unless 
we have successfully opened a connection. The pseudocode in this example follows a general 
pattern that can be used to robustly obtain a resource, use the resource, and then release the 
resource. 

8.3.3 Throwing Exceptions 

There are times when it makes sense for a program to deliberately throw an exception. This 
is the case when the program discovers some sort of exceptional or error condition, but there 
is no reasonable way to handle the error at the point where the problem is discovered. The 
program can throw an exception in the hope that some other part of the program will catch 
and handle the exception. This can be done with a throw statement. You have already seen 
an example of this in Subsection 4.3.5. In this section, we cover the throw statement more 
fully. The syntax of the throw statement is: 

throw (exception-object) ; 

The (exception- object) must be an object belonging to one of the subclasses of Throwable. 
Usually, it will in fact belong to one of the subclasses of Exception. In most cases, it will be a 
newly constructed object created with the new operator. For example: 

throw new ArithmeticExceptionC'Division by zero"); 

The parameter in the constructor becomes the error message in the exception object; if e 
refers to the object, the error message can be retrieved by calling e . getMessage () . (You 
might find this example a bit odd, because you might expect the system itself to throw an 
ArithmeticException when an attempt is made to divide by zero. So why should a programmer 
bother to throw the exception? Recall that if the numbers that are being divided are of type 
int, then division by zero will indeed throw an ArithmeticException. However, no arithmetic 
operations with floating-point numbers will ever produce an exception. Instead, the special 
value Double . NaN is used to represent the result of an illegal operation. In some situations, you 
might prefer to throw an ArithmeticException when a real number is divided by zero.) 

An exception can be thrown either by the system or by a throw statement. The exception 
is processed in exactly the same way in either case. Suppose that the exception is thrown 
inside a try statement. If that try statement has a catch clause that handles that type of 
exception, then the computer jumps to the catch clause and executes it. The exception has 
been handled. After handling the exception, the computer executes the finally clause of 
the try statement, if there is one. It then continues normally with the rest of the program, 
which follows the try statement. If the exception is not immediately caught and handled, the 
processing of the exception will continue. 

When an exception is thrown during the execution of a subroutine and the exception is 
not handled in the same subroutine, then that subroutine is terminated (after the execution 
of any pending finally clauses). Then the routine that called that subroutine gets a chance 
to handle the exception. That is, if the subroutine was called inside a try statement that has 
an appropriate catch clause, then that catch clause will be executed and the program will 
continue on normally from there. Again, if the second routine does not handle the exception, 
then it also is terminated and the routine that called it (if any) gets the next shot at the 
exception. The exception will crash the program only if it passes up through the entire chain of 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



395 



subroutine calls without being handled. (In fact, even this is not quite true: In a multithreaded 
program, only the thread in which the exception occurred is terminated.) 

A subroutine that might generate an exception can announce this fact by adding a clause 
"throws {exception- class-name)" to the header of the routine. For example: 
/** 

* Returns the larger of the two roots of the quadratic equation 

* A*x*x + B*x + C = 0, provided it has any roots. If A == or 

* if the discriminant, B*B - 4*A*C, is negative, then an exception 

* of type IllegalArgumentException is thrown. 
*/ 

static public double root( double A, double B, double C ) 

throws IllegalArgumentException { 

if (A == 0) { 

throw new IllegalArgumentExceptionC'A can't be zero."); 

> 

else { 

double disc = B*B - 4*A*C; 
if (disc < 0) 

throw new IllegalArgumentExceptionC'Discriminant < zero."); 
return (-B + Math. sqrt (disc) ) / (2*A) ; 

} 

} 

As discussed in the previous section, the computation in this subroutine has the precon- 
ditions that A != and B*B-4*A*C >= 0. The subroutine throws an exception of type Ille- 
galArgumentException when either of these preconditions is violated. When an illegal condition 
is found in a subroutine, throwing an exception is often a reasonable response. If the program 
that called the subroutine knows some good way to handle the error, it can catch the exception. 
If not, the program will crash — and the programmer will know that the program needs to be 
fixed. 

A throws clause in a subroutine heading can declare several different types of exception, 
separated by commas. For example: 

void processArray (int [] A) throws NullPointerException, 

ArraylndexOutOf BoundsException { ... 

8.3.4 Mandatory Exception Handling 

In the preceding example, declaring that the subroutine root () can throw an IllegalArgumentEx- 
ception is just a courtesy to potential readers of this routine. This is because handling of II- 
legalArgumentExceptions is not "mandatory." A routine can throw an IllegalArgumentException 
without announcing the possibility. And a program that calls that routine is free either to catch 
or to ignore the exception, just as a programmer can choose either to catch or to ignore an 
exception of type NullPointerException. 

For those exception classes that require mandatory handling, the situation is different. If a 
subroutine can throw such an exception, that fact must be announced in a throws clause in 
the routine definition. Failing to do so is a syntax error that will be reported by the compiler. 
Exceptions that require mandatory handling are called checked exceptions. The compiler 
will check that such exceptions are handled by the program. 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



396 



Suppose that some statement in the body of a subroutine can generate a checked exception, 
one that requires mandatory handling. The statement could be a throw statement, which throws 
the exception directly, or it could be a call to a subroutine that can throw the exception. In 
either case, the exception must be handled. This can be done in one of two ways: The first 
way is to place the statement in a try statement that has a catch clause that handles the 
exception; in this case, the exception is handled within the subroutine, so that any caller of the 
subroutine will never see the exception. The second way is to declare that the subroutine can 
throw the exception. This is done by adding a "throws" clause to the subroutine heading, which 
alerts any callers to the possibility that an exception might be generated when the subroutine 
is executed. The caller will, in turn, be forced either to handle the exception in a try statement 
or to declare the exception in a throws clause in its own header. 

Exception-handling is mandatory for any exception class that is not a subclass of either 
Error or RuntimeException. These checked exceptions generally represent conditions that are 
outside the control of the programmer. For example, they might represent bad input or an 
illegal action taken by the user. There is no way to avoid such errors, so a robust program 
has to be prepared to handle them. The design of Java makes it impossible for programmers 
to ignore the possibility of such errors. 

Among the checked exceptions are several that can occur when using Java's input/output 
routines. This means that you can't even use these routines unless you understand something 
about exception-handling. Chapter 11 deals with input /output and uses mandatory exception- 
handling extensively. 

8.3.5 Programming with Exceptions 

Exceptions can be used to help write robust programs. They provide an organized and struc- 
tured approach to robustness. Without exceptions, a program can become cluttered with if 
statements that test for various possible error conditions. With exceptions, it becomes possible 
to write a clean implementation of an algorithm that will handle all the normal cases. The 
exceptional cases can be handled elsewhere, in a catch clause of a try statement. 

When a program encounters an exceptional condition and has no way of handling it im- 
mediately, the program can throw an exception. In some cases, it makes sense to throw an 
exception belonging to one of Java's predefined classes, such as UlegalArgumentException or 
lOException. However, if there is no standard class that adequately represents the exceptional 
condition, the programmer can define a new exception class. The new class must extend the 
standard class Throwable or one of its subclasses. In general, if the programmer does not want 
to require mandatory exception handling, the new class will extend RuntimeException (or one 
of its subclasses). To create a new checked exception class, which does require mandatory 
handling, the programmer can extend one of the other subclasses of Exception or can extend 
Exception itself. 

Here, for example, is a class that extends Exception, and therefore requires mandatory 
exception handling when it is used: 

public class ParseError extends Exception { 
public ParseError (String message) { 

// Create a ParseError object containing 
// the given message as its error message, 
super (message) ; 

> 

} 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



397 



The class contains only a constructor that makes it possible to create a ParseError object 
containing a given error message. (The statement "super (message)" calls a constructor in the 
superclass, Exception. See Subsection 5.6.3.) Of course the class inherits the getMessageO and 
printStackTrace () routines from its superclass. If e refers to an object of type ParseError, 
then the function call e . getMessage () will retrieve the error message that was specified in the 
constructor. But the main point of the ParseError class is simply to exist. When an object of 
type ParseError is thrown, it indicates that a certain type of error has occurred. (Parsing , by 
the way, refers to figuring out the syntax of a string. A ParseError would indicate, presumably, 
that some string that is being processed by the program does not have the expected form.) 

A throw statement can be used in a program to throw an error of type ParseError. The 
constructor for the ParseError object must specify an error message. For example: 

throw new ParseError ("Encountered an illegal negative number."); 

or 

throw new ParseError ("The word '" + word 

+ "' is not a valid file name."); 

If the throw statement does not occur in a try statement that catches the error, then the 
subroutine that contains the throw statement must declare that it can throw a ParseError by 
adding the clause "throws ParseError" to the subroutine heading. For example, 

void getUserDataO throws ParseError { 
} 

This would not be required if ParseError were defined as a subclass of RuntimeException instead 
of Exception, since in that case ParseErrors would not be checked exceptions. 

A routine that wants to handle ParseErrors can use a try statement with a catch clause 
that catches ParseErrors. For example: 

try { 

getUserDataO ; 
processUserDataO ; 

} 

catch (ParseError pe) { 

. . . / / Handle the error 

} 

Note that since ParseError is a subclass of Exception, a catch clause of the form "catch 
(Exception e)" would also catch ParseErrors, along with any other object of type Exception. 
Sometimes, it's useful to store extra data in an exception object. For example, 

class ShipDestroyed extends RuntimeException { 
Ship ship; // Which ship was destroyed. 

int where_x, where_y; // Location where ship was destroyed. 
ShipDestroyed (String message, Ship s, int x, int y) { 
// Constructor creates a ShipDestroyed object 
// carrying an error message plus the information 
// that the ship s was destroyed at location (x,y) 
// on the screen, 
super (message) ; 
ship = s ; 
where_x = x; 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



398 



where_y = y; 

} 

} 

Here, a ShipDestroyed object contains an error message and some information about a ship that 
was destroyed. This could be used, for example, in a statement: 

if ( userShip . isHit () ) 

throw new ShipDestroyed ("You've been hit!", userShip, xPos, yPos) ; 

Note that the condition represented by a ShipDestroyed object might not even be considered 
an error. It could be just an expected interruption to the normal flow of a game. Exceptions 
can sometimes be used to handle such interruptions neatly. 

* * * 

The ability to throw exceptions is particularly useful in writing general-purpose methods 
and classes that are meant to be used in more than one program. In this case, the person writing 
the method or class often has no reasonable way of handling the error, since that person has no 
way of knowing exactly how the method or class will be used. In such circumstances, a novice 
programmer is often tempted to print an error message and forge ahead, but this is almost 
never satisfactory since it can lead to unpredictable results down the line. Printing an error 
message and terminating the program is almost as bad, since it gives the program no chance 
to handle the error. 

The program that calls the method or uses the class needs to know that the error has 
occurred. In languages that do not support exceptions, the only alternative is to return some 
special value or to set the value of some variable to indicate that an error has occurred. For 
example, the readMeasurement () function in Subsection 8.2.2 returns the value -1 if the user's 
input is illegal. However, this only does any good if the main program bothers to test the 
return value. It is very easy to be lazy about checking for special return values every time a 
subroutine is called. And in this case, using -1 as a signal that an error has occurred makes it 
impossible to allow negative measurements. Exceptions are a cleaner way for a subroutine to 
react when it encounters an error. 

It is easy to modify the readMeasurement () function to use exceptions instead of a special 
return value to signal an error. My modified subroutine throws a ParseError when the user's 
input is illegal, where ParseError is the subclass of Exception that was defined above. (Arguably, 
it might be reasonable to avoid defining a new class by using the standard exception class 
HlegalArgumentException instead.) The changes from the original version are shown in italic: 

/** 

* Reads the user's input measurement from one line of input. 

* Precondition: The input line is not empty. 

* Postcondition: If the user's input is legal, the measurement 

* is converted to inches and returned. 

* @throws ParseError if the user's input is not legal. 
*/ 

static double readMeasurement () throws ParseError { 

double inches; // Total number of inches in user's measurement. 

double measurement ; / / One measurement , 

// such as the 12 in "12 miles." 
String units; // The units specified for the measurement, 

// such as "miles."

inches =0; //No inches have yet been read. 

skipBlanks () ; 

ch = TextIO .peekO ; 

/* As long as there is more input on the line, read a measurement and 
add the equivalent number of inches to the variable, inches. If an 
error is detected during the loop, end the subroutine immediately 
by throwing a ParseError. */ 

while (ch != '\n') { 

/* Get the next measurement and the units. Before reading 

anything, make sure that a legal value is there to read. */ 

if ( ! Character. isDigit(ch) ) { 

throw new ParseError ("Expected to find a number, but found " + ch) ; 

} 

measurement = TextIO . getDouble () ; 
skipBlanks () ; 

if (TextIO. peekO == '\n') { 

throw new ParseError ("Missing unit of measure at end of line."); 

}

units = units . toLowerCase () ;

The complete program can be found in the file LengthConverter3.java. From the user's 
point of view, this program has exactly the same behavior as the program LengthConverter2 
from the previous section. Internally, however, the programs are significantly different, since 
LengthConverter3 uses exception handling. 

8.4 Assertions and Annotations 

In THIS SHORT SECTION, we look briefly at two features of Java that are not covered or used (online) 
elsewhere in this textbook, assertions and annotations. They are included here for completeness, 
but they are mostly meant for more advanced programming. 

8.4.1 Assertions 

Recall that a precondition is a condition that must be true at a certain point in a program, for 
the execution of the program to continue correctly from that point. In the case where there is 
a chance that the precondition might not be satisfied — for example, if it depends on input from 
the user — then it's a good idea to insert an if statement to test it. But then the question arises, 
What should be done if the precondition does not hold? One option is to throw an exception. 
This will terminate the program, unless the exception is caught and handled elsewhere in the 
program. 

In many cases, of course, instead of using an if statement to test whether a precondition 
holds, a programmer tries to write the program in a way that will guarantee that the precondi- 
tion holds. In that case, the test should not be necessary, and the if statement can be avoided. 
The problem is that programmers are not perfect. In spite of the programmer's intention, the 
program might contain a bug that screws up the precondition. So maybe it's a good idea to 
check the precondition after all — at least during the debugging phase of program development. 

Similarly, a postcondition is a condition that is true at a certain point in the program as 
a consequence of the code that has been executed before that point. Assuming that the code 
is correctly written, a postcondition is guaranteed to be true, but here again testing whether a 
desired postcondition is actually true is a way of checking for a bug that might have screwed 
up the postcondition. This is something that might be desirable during debugging. 

The programming languages C and C++ have always had a facility for adding what are 
called assertions to a program. These assertions take the form "assert ((condition))" , where 
(condition) is a boolean-valued expression. This condition expresses a precondition or post- 
condition that should hold at that point in the program. When the computer encounters an 
assertion during the execution of the program, it evaluates the condition. If the condition is 
false, the program is terminated. Otherwise, the program continues normally. This allows the 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



401 



programmer's belief that the condition is true to be tested; if it is not true, that indicates that 
the part of the program that preceded the assertion contained a bug. One nice thing about 
assertions in C and C++ is that they can be "turned off' at compile time. That is, if the 
program is compiled in one way, then the assertions are included in the compiled code. If the 
program is compiled in another way, the assertions are not included. During debugging, the 
first type of compilation is used, with assertions turned on. The release version of the program 
is compiled with assertions turned off. The release version will be more efficient, because the 
computer won't have to evaluate all the assertions. 

Although early versions of Java did not have assertions, an assertion facility similar to the 
one in C/C++ has been available in Java since version 1.4. As with the C/C++ version, Java 
assertions can be turned on during debugging and turned off during normal execution. In Java, 
however, assertions are turned on and off at run time rather than at compile time. An assertion 
in the Java source code is always included in the compiled class file. When the program is 
run in the normal way, these assertions are ignored; since the condition in the assertion is not 
evaluated in this case, there is little or no performance penalty for having the assertions in 
the program. When the program is being debugged, it can be run with assertions enabled, as 
discussed below, and then the assertions can be a great help in locating and identifying bugs. 

* * * 

An assertion statement in Java takes one of the following two forms: 
assert {condition) ; 

or 

assert (condition) : (erroi — message) ; 

where (condition) is a boolean-valued expression and (error-message) is a string or an expres- 
sion of type String. The word "assert" is a reserved word in Java, which cannot be used as an 
identifier. An assertion statement can be used anyplace in Java where a statement is legal. 

If a program is run with assertions disabled, an assertion statement is equivalent to an 
empty statement and has no effect. When assertions are enabled and an assertion statement is 
encountered in the program, the (condition) in the assertion is evaluated. If the value is true, 
the program proceeds normally. If the value of the condition is false, then an exception of 
type java. lang . AssertionError is thrown, and the program will crash (unless the error is 
caught by a try statement). If the assert statement includes an (error-message) , then the 
error message string becomes the message in the AssertionError. 

So, the statement "assert (condition) : (error-message) ;" is similar to 

if ( (condition) == false ) 

throw new AssertionError ( (error-message) ); 

except that the if statement is executed whenever the program is run, and the assert state- 
ment is executed only when the program is run with assertions enabled. 

The question is, when to use assertions instead of exceptions? The general rule is to use 
assertions to test conditions that should definitely be true, if the program is written correctly. 
Assertions are useful for testing a program to see whether or not it is correct and for finding 
the errors in an incorrect program. After testing and debugging, when the program is used in 
the normal way, the assertions in the program will be ignored. However, if a problem turns 
up later, the assertions are still there in the program to be used to help locate the error. If 
someone writes to you to say that your program doesn't work when he does such-and-such, you 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



402 



can run the program with assertions enabled, do such-and-such, and hope that the assertions 
in the program will help you locate the point in the program where it goes wrong. 

Consider, for example, the root() method from Subsection 8.3.3 that calculates a root of 
a quadratic equation. If you believe that your program will always call this method with legal 
arguments, then it would make sense to write the method using assertions instead of exceptions: 

/** 

* Returns the larger of the two roots of the quadratic equation 

* A*x*x + B*x + C = 0, provided it has any roots. 

* Precondition: A != and B*B - 4*A*C >= 0. 
*/ 

static public double root( double A, double B, double C ) { 

assert A != : "Leading coefficient of quadratic equation cannot be zero."; 
double disc = B*B - 4*A*C; 

assert disc >= : "Discriminant of quadratic equation cannot be negative."; 
return (-B + Math. sqrt (disc)) / (2*A) ; 

} 

The assertions are not checked when the program is run in the normal way. If you are correct in 
your belief that the method is never called with illegal arguments, then checking the conditions 
in the assertions would be unnecessary. If your belief is not correct, the problem should turn 
up during testing or debugging, when the program is run with the assertions enabled. 

If the root () method is part of a software library that you expect other people to use, then 
the situation is less clear. Oracle's Java documentation advises that assertions should not be 
used for checking the contract of public methods: If the caller of a method violates the contract 
by passing illegal parameters, then an exception should be thrown. This will enforce the contract 
whether or not assertions are enabled. (However, while it's true that Java programmers expect 
the contract of a method to be enforced with exceptions, there are reasonable arguments for 
using assertions instead, in some cases.) One might say that assertions are for you, to help you 
in debugging your code, while exceptions are for people who use your code, to alert them that 
they are misusing it. 

On the other hand, it never hurts to use an assertion to check a postcondition of a method. 
A postcondition is something that is supposed to be true after the method has executed, and 
it can be tested with an assert statement at the end of the method. If the postcondition is 
false, there is a bug in the method itself, and that is something that needs to be found during 
the development of the method. 

* * * 

To have any effect, assertions must be enabled when the program is run. How to do this 
depends on what programming environment you are using. (See Section 2.6 for a discussion of 
programming environments.) In the usual command line environment, assertions are enabled by 
adding the option -enableassertions to the java command that is used to run the program. 
For example, if the class that contains the main program is RootFinder, then the command 

java -enableassertions RootFinder 

will run the program with assertions enabled. The -enableassertions option can be abbre- 
viated to -ea, so the command can alternatively be written as 

java -ea RootFinder 

In fact, it is possible to enable assertions in just part of a program. An option of the form 
"-ea: {class— name)" enables only the assertions in the specified class. Note that there are no 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



403 



spaces between the -ea, the and the name of the class. To enable all the assertions in a 
package and in its sub-packages, you can use an option of the form "-ea: {package-name) . . .". 
To enable assertions in the "default package" (that is, classes that are not specified to belong to 
a package, like almost all the classes in this book), use "-ea: . . .". For example, to run a Java 
program named "MegaPaint" with assertions enabled for every class in the packages named 
"paintutils" and "drawing", you would use the command: 

java -ea : paintutils .. . -ea : drawing. . . MegaPaint 

If you are using the Eclipse integrated development environment, you can specify the -ea 
option by creating a run configuration. Right-click the name of the main program class in the 
Package Explorer pane, and select "Run As" from the pop-up menu and then "Run. . . " from 
the submenu. This will open a dialog box where you can manage run configurations. The name 
of the project and of the main class will be already be filled in. Click the "Arguments" tab, and 
enter -ea in the box under "VM Arguments" . The contents of this box are added to the j ava 
command that is used to run the program. You can enter other options in this box, including 
more complicated enableassertions options such as -ea: paintutils .... When you click the 
"Run" button, the options will be applied. Furthermore, they will be applied whenever you run 
the program, unless you change the run configuration or add a new configuration. Note that it 
is possible to make two run configurations for the same class, one with assertions enabled and 
one with assertions disabled. 

8.4.2 Annotations 

The term "annotation" refers to notes added to or written alongside a main text, to help you 
understand or appreciate the text. An annotation might be a note that you make to yourself 
in the margin of a book. It might be a footnote added to an old novel by an editor to explain 
the historical context of some event. The annotation is metadata or "metatext," that is, text 
written about the main text rather than as part of the main text itself. 

Comments on a program are actually a kind of annotation. Since they are ignored by the 
compiler, they have no effect on the meaning of the program. They are there to explain that 
meaning to a human reader. It is possible, of course, for another computer program (not the 
compiler) to process comments. That's what done in the case of Javadoc comments, which are 
processed by a program that uses them to create API documentation. But comments are only 
one type of metadata that might be added to programs. 

In Java 5.0, a new feature called annotations was added to the Java language to make 
it easier to create new kinds of metadata for Java programs. This has made it possible for 
programmers to devise new ways of annotating programs, and to write programs that can read 
and use their annotations. 

Java annotations have no direct effect on the program that they annotate. But they do have 
many potential uses. Some annotations are used to make the programmer's intent more explicit. 
Such annotations might be checked by a compiler to make sure that the code is consistent with 
the programmer's intention. For example, ©Override is a standard annotation that can be 
used to annotate method definitions. It means that the method is intended to override (that 
is replace) a method with the same signature that was defined in some superclass. A compiler 
can check that the superclass method actually exists; if not, it can inform the programmer. An 
annotation used in this way is an aid to writing correct programs, since the programmer can 
be warned about a potential error in advance, instead of having to hunt it down later as a bug. 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



404 



To annotate a method definition with the ©Override annotation, simply place it in front of 
the definition. Syntactically, annotations are modifiers that are used in much the same way as 
built-in modifiers like "public" and "final." For example, 

©Override public void WindowClosed (WindowEvent evt) { . . . } 

If there is no "WindowClosed(WindowEvent) " method in any superclass, then the compiler 
can issue an error. In fact, this example is based on a hard-to-find bug that I once intro- 
duced when trying to override a method named "windowClosed" with a method that I called 
"WindowClosed" (with an upper case "W"). If the ©Override annotation had existed at that 
time — and if I had used it — the compiler would have rejected my code and saved me the trouble 
of tracking down the bug. 

(Annotations are a fairly advanced feature, and I might not have mentioned them in this 
textbook, except that the ©Override annotation can show up in code generated by Eclipse and 
other integrated development environments.) 

There are two other standard annotations. One is ©Deprecated, which can be used to mark 
deprecated classes, methods, and variables. (A deprecated item is one that is considered to be 
obsolete, but is still part of the Java language for backwards compatibility for old code.) Use of 
this annotation would allow a compiler to generate warnings when the deprecated item is used. 

The other standard annotation is ©SurpressWarnings, which can be used by a compiler 
to turn off warning messages that would ordinarily be generated when a class or method is 
compiled. ©SuppressWarnings is an example of an annotation that has a parameter. The 
parameter tells what class of warnings are to be suppressed. For example, when a class or 
method is annotated with 

@Suppr e s sWarnings ( " depr e cat i on " ) 

then no warnings about the use of deprecated items will be emitted when the class or method 
is compiled. There are other types of warning that can be suppressed; unfortunately the list of 
warnings and their names is not standardized and will vary from one compiler to another. 

Note, by the way, that the syntax for annotation parameters — especially for an annotation 
that accepts multiple parameters — is not the same as the syntax for method parameters. I 
won't cover the annotation syntax here. 

Programmers can define new annotations for use in their code. Such annotations are ignored 
by standard compilers and programming tools, but it's possible to write programs that can 
understand the annotations and check for their presence in source code. It is even possible to 
create annotations that will be retained at run-time and become part of the running program. 
In that case, a program can check for annotations in the actual compiled code that is being 
executed, and take actions that depend on the presence of the annotation or the values of its 
parameters. 

Annotations can help programmers to write correct programs. To use an example from the 
Java documentation, they can help with the creation of "boilerplate" code — that is, code that 
has a very standardized format and that can be generated mechanically. Often, boilerplate code 
is generated based on other code. Doing that by hand is a tedious and error-prone process. 
A simple example might be code to save certain aspects of a program's state to a file and to 
restore it later. The code for reading and writing the values of all the relevant state variables is 
highly repetitious. Instead of writing that code by hand, a programmer could use an annotation 
to mark the variables that are part of the state that is to be saved. A program could then be 
used to check for the annotations and generate the save-and-restore code. In fact, it would even 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



405 



be possible to do without that code altogether, if the program checks for the presence of the 
annotation at run time to decide which variables to save and restore. 

8.5 Analysis of Algorithms 

This chapter has concentrated mostly on correctness of programs. In practice, another (online) 
issue is also important: efficiency. When analyzing a program in terms of efficiency, we 
want to look at questions such as, "How long does it take for the program to run?" and "Is 
there another approach that will get the answer more quickly?" Efficiency will always be less 
important than correctness; if you don't care whether a program works correctly, you can make 
it run very quickly indeed, but no one will think it's much of an achievement! On the other 
hand, a program that gives a correct answer after ten thousand years isn't very useful either, 
so efficiency is often an important issue. 

The term "efficiency" can refer to efficient use of almost any resource, including time, 
computer memory, disk space, or network bandwidth. In this section, however, we will deal 
exclusively with time efficiency, and the major question that we want to ask about a program 
is, how long does it take to perform its task? 

It really makes little sense to classify an individual program as being "efficient" or "ineffi- 
cient." It makes more sense to compare two (correct) programs that perform the same task and 
ask which one of the two is "more efficient," that is, which one performs the task more quickly. 
However, even here there are difficulties. The running time of a program is not well-defined. 
The run time can be different depending on the number and speed of the processors in the 
computer on which it is run and, in the case of Java, on the design of the Java Virtual Machine 
which is used to interpret the program. It can depend on details of the compiler which is used 
to translate the program from high-level language to machine language. Furthermore, the run 
time of a program depends on the size of the problem which the program has to solve. It takes 
a sorting program longer to sort 10000 items than it takes it to sort 100 items. When the run 
times of two programs are compared, it often happens that Program A solves small problems 
faster than Program B, while Program B solves large problems faster than Program A, so that 
it is simply not the case that one program is faster than the other in all cases. 

In spite of these difficulties, there is a field of computer science dedicated to analyzing 
the efficiency of programs. The field is known as Analysis of Algorithms. The focus is 
on algorithms, rather than on programs as such, to avoid having to deal with multiple im- 
plementations of the same algorithm written in different languages, compiled with different 
compilers, and running on different computers. Analysis of Algorithms is a mathematical field 
that abstracts away from these down-and-dirty details. Still, even though it is a theoretical 
field, every working programmer should be aware of some of its techniques and results. This 
section is a very brief introduction to some of those techniques and results. Because this is not 
a mathematics book, the treatment will be rather informal. 

One of the main techniques of analysis of algorithms is asymptotic analysis. The term 
"asymptotic" here means basically "the tendency in the long run." An asymptotic analysis of 
an algorithm's run time looks at the question of how the run time depends on the size of the 
problem. The analysis is asymptotic because it only considers what happens to the run time 
as the size of the problem increases without limit; it is not concerned with what happens for 
problems of small size or, in fact, for problems of any fixed finite size. Only what happens in the 
long run, as the problem size increases without limit, is important. Showing that Algorithm A 
is asymptotically faster than Algorithm B doesn't necessarily mean that Algorithm A will run 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



406 



faster than Algorithm B for problems of size 10 or size 1000 or even size 1000000 — it only 
means that if you keep increasing the problem size, you will eventually come to a point where 
Algorithm A is faster than Algorithm B. An asymptotic analysis is only a first approximation, 
but in practice it often gives important and useful information. 

* * * 

Central to asymptotic analysis is Big- Oh notation. Using this notation, we might say, 
for example, that an algorithm has a running time that is 0(n 2 ) or 0(n) or O(log(n)). These 
notations are read "Big-Oh of n squared," "Big-Oh of n," and "Big-Oh of log n" (where log is a 
logarithm function). More generally, we can refer to 0(f(n)) ("Big-Oh of f of n"), where f(n) is 
some function that assigns a positive real number to every positive integer n. The "n" in this 
notation refers to the size of the problem. Before you can even begin an asymptotic analysis, 
you need some way to measure problem size. Usually, this is not a big issue. For example, if 
the problem is to sort a list of items, then the problem size can be taken to be the number of 
items in the list. When the input to an algorithm is an integer, as in the case of an algorithm 
that checks whether a given positive integer is prime, the usual measure of the size of a problem 
is the number of bits in the input integer rather than the integer itself. More generally, the 
number of bits in the input to a problem is often a good measure of the size of the problem. 

To say that the running time of an algorithm is 0(f(n)) means that for large values of 
the problem size, n, the running time of the algorithm is no bigger than some constant times 
f(n). (More rigorously, there is a number C and a positive integer M such that whenever n 
is greater than M, the run time is less than or equal to C*f(n).) The constant takes into 
account details such as the speed of the computer on which the algorithm is run; if you use 
a slower computer, you might have to use a bigger constant in the formula, but changing the 
constant won't change the basic fact that the run time is 0(f(n)). The constant also makes 
it unnecessary to say whether we are measuring time in seconds, years, CPU cycles, or any 
other unit of measure; a change from one unit of measure to another is just multiplication by 
a constant. Note also that 0(f(n)) doesn't depend at all on what happens for small problem 
sizes, only on what happens in the long run as the problem size increases without limit. 

To look at a simple example, consider the problem of adding up all the numbers in an array. 
The problem size, n, is the length of the array. Using A as the name of the array, the algorithm 
can be expressed in Java as: 

total = 0; 

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
total = total + A[i] ; 

This algorithm performs the same operation, total = total + A[i], n times. The total 
time spent on this operation is a*n, where a is the time it takes to perform the operation once. 
Now, this is not the only thing that is done in the algorithm. The value of i is incremented 
and is compared to n each time through the loop. This adds an additional time of b*n to the 
run time, for some constant b. Furthermore, i and total both have to be initialized to zero; 
this adds some constant amount c to the running time. The exact running time would then be 
(a+b)*n+c, where the constants a, b, and c depend on factors such as how the code is compiled 
and what computer it is run on. Using the fact that c is less than or equal to c*n for any 
positive integer n, we can say that the run time is less than or equal to (a+b+c)*n. That is, 
the run time is less than or equal to a constant times n. By definition, this means that the run 
time for this algorithm is 0(n). 

If this explanation is too mathematical for you, we can just note that for large values of 
n, the c in the formula (a+b)*n+c is insignificant compared to the other term, (a+b)*n. We 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



407 



say that c is a "lower order term." When doing asymptotic analysis, lower order terms can 
be discarded. A rough, but correct, asymptotic analysis of the algorithm would go something 
like this: Each iteration of the for loop takes a certain constant amount of time. There are 
n iterations of the loop, so the total run time is a constant times n, plus lower order terms 
(to account for the initialization). Disregarding lower order terms, we see that the run time is 
0(n). 

* * * 

Note that to say that an algorithm has run time 0(f(n)) is to say that its run time is no 
bigger than some constant times f(n) (for large values of n). 0(f(n)) puts an upper limit on 
the run time. However, the run time could be smaller, even much smaller. For example, if the 
run time is 0(n), it would also be correct to say that the run time is 0(n 2 ) or even 0(n 10 ). If 
the run time is less than a constant times n, then it is certainly less than the same constant 
times n 2 or n 10 . 

Of course, sometimes it's useful to have a lower limit on the run time. That is, we want to 
be able to say that the run time is greater than or equal to some constant times f(n) (for large 
values of n). The notation for this is il(f(n)), read "Omega of f of n." "Omega" is the name of 
a letter in the Greek alphabet, and is the upper case version of that letter. (To be technical, 
saying that the run time of an algorithm is 0(f(n)) means that there is a positive number C 
and a positive integer M such that whenever n is greater than M, the run time is greater than 
or equal to C*f(n).) 0(f(n)) tells you something about the maximum amount of time that you 
might have to wait for an algorithm to finish; f2(f(n)) tells you something about the minimum 
time. 

The algorithm for adding up the numbers in an array has a run time that is f2(n) as well as 
0(n). When an algorithm has a run time that is both fl(f(n)) and 0(f(n)), its run time is said 
to be 0(f(n)), read "Theta of f of n." (Theta is another letter from the Greek alphabet.) To 
say that the run time of an algorithm is 0(f(n)) means that for large values of n, the run time 
is between a*f(n) and b*f(n), where a and b are constants (with b greater than a, and both 
greater than 0). 

Let's look at another example. Consider the algorithm that can be expressed in Java in the 
following method: 

/** 

* Sorts the n array elements A[0], A[l], A[n-1] into increasing order. 

*/ 

public static simpleBubbleSort ( int [] A, int n ) { 
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { 

// Do n passes through the array. . . 
for (int j = 0; j < n-1; j++) { 
if ( A[j] > A[j+1] ) { 

// A[j] and A[j+1] are out of order, so swap them 
int temp = A [j] ; 
A[j] = A[j+1] j 
A[j+1] = temp; 

} 

} 

> 

} 

Here, the parameter n represents the problem size. The outer for loop in the method is executed 
n times. Each time the outer for loop is executed, the inner for loop is executed n-1 times, so 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



408 



the if statement is executed n*(n-l) times. This is n 2 -n, but since lower order terms are not 
significant in an asymptotic analysis, it's good enough to say that the if statement is executed 
about n 2 times. In particular, the test A [j] > A is executed about n 2 times, and this fact 

by itself is enough to say that the run time of the algorithm is f2(n 2 ), that is, the run time is 
at least some constant times n 2 . Furthermore, if we look at other operations — the assignment 
statements, incrementing i and j, etc. — none of them are executed more than n 2 times, so the 
run time is also 0(n 2 ), that is, the run time is no more than some constant times n 2 . Since it 
is both 0(n 2 ) and 0(n 2 ), the run time of the simpleBubbleSort algorithm is 0(n 2 ). 

You should be aware that some people use the notation 0(f(n)) as if it meant 0(f(n)). That 
is, when they say that the run time of an algorithm is 0(f(n)), they mean to say that the run 
time is about equal to a constant times f(n). For that, they should use 0(f(n)). Properly 
speaking, 0(f(n)) means that the run time is less than a constant times f(n), possibly much 
less. 

* * * 

So far, my analysis has ignored an important detail. We have looked at how run time 
depends on the problem size, but in fact the run time usually depends not just on the size of 
the problem but on the specific data that has to be processed. For example, the run time of a 
sorting algorithm can depend on the initial order of the items that are to be sorted, and not 
just on the number of items. 

To account for this dependency, we can consider either the worst case run time analysis 
or the average case run time analysis of an algorithm. For a worst case run time analysis, we 
consider all possible problems of size n and look at the longest possible run time for all such 
problems. For an average case analysis, we consider all possible problems of size n and look at 
the average of the run times for all such problems. Usually, the average case analysis assumes 
that all problems of size n are equally likely to be encountered, although this is not always 
realistic — or even possible in the case where there is an infinite number of different problems of 
a given size. 

In many cases, the average and the worst case run times are the same to within a constant 
multiple. This means that as far as asymptotic analysis is concerned, they are the same. That 
is, if the average case run time is 0(f(n)) or 0(f(n)), then so is the worst case. However, later in 
the book, we will encounter a few cases where the average and worst case asymptotic analyses 
differ. 

* * * 

So, what do you really have to know about analysis of algorithms to read the rest of this 
book? We will not do any rigorous mathematical analysis, but you should be able to follow 
informal discussion of simple cases such as the examples that we have looked at in this section. 
Most important, though, you should have a feeling for exactly what it means to say that the 
running time of an algorithm is 0(f(n)) or 0(f(n)) for some common functions f(n). The main 
point is that these notations do not tell you anything about the actual numerical value of the 
running time of the algorithm for any particular case. They do not tell you anything at all 
about the running time for small values of n. What they do tell you is something about the 
rate of growth of the running time as the size of the problem increases. 

Suppose you compare two algorithms that solve the same problem. The run time of one 
algorithm is 0(n 2 ), while the run time of the second algorithm is 0(n 3 ). What does this tell 
you? If you want to know which algorithm will be faster for some particular problem of size, 
say, 100, nothing is certain. As far as you can tell just from the asymptotic analysis, either 
algorithm could be faster for that particular case — or in any particular case. But what you can 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY

say for sure is that if you look at larger and larger problems, you will come to a point where the 
0(n 2 ) algorithm is faster than the 0(n 3 ) algorithm. Furthermore, as you continue to increase 
the problem size, the relative advantage of the 0(n 2 ) algorithm will continue to grow. There 
will be values of n for which the 0(n 2 ) algorithm is a thousand times faster, a million times 
faster, a billion times faster, and so on. This is because for any positive constants a and b, the 
function a*n 3 grows faster than the function b*n 2 as n gets larger. (Mathematically, the limit 
of the ratio of a*n 3 to b*n 2 is infinite as n approaches infinity.) 

This means that for "large" problems, a 0(n 2 ) algorithm will definitely be faster than a 
0(n 3 ) algorithm. You just don't know — based on the asymptotic analysis alone — exactly how 
large "large" has to be. In practice, in fact, it is likely that the 0(n 2 ) algorithm will be faster 
even for fairly small values of n, and absent other information you would generally prefer a 
0(n 2 ) algorithm to a 0(n 3 ) algorithm. 

So, to understand and apply asymptotic analysis, it is essential to have some idea of the 
rates of growth of some common functions. For the power functions n, n 2 , n 3 , n 4 , . . . , the larger 
the exponent, the greater the rate of growth of the function. Exponential functions such as 2" 
and 10™, where the n is in the exponent, have a growth rate that is faster than that of any power 
function. In fact, exponential functions grow so quickly that an algorithm whose run time grows 
exponentially is almost certainly impractical even for relatively modest values of n, because the 
running time is just too long. Another function that often turns up in asymptotic analysis is 
the logarithm function, log(n). There are actually many different logarithm functions, but the 
one that is usually used in computer science is the so-called logarithm to the base two, which is 
defined by the fact that log(2 x ) = x for any number x. (Usually, this function is written log2(n), 
but I will leave out the subscript 2, since I will only use the base- two logarithm in this book.) 
The logarithm function grows very slowly. The growth rate of log(n) is much smaller than the 
growth rate of n. The growth rate of n*log(n) is a little larger than the growth rate of n, but 
much smaller than the growth rate of n 2 . The following table should help you understand the 
differences among the rates of grows of various functions:

The reason that log(n) shows up so often is because of its association with multiplying and 
dividing by two: Suppose you start with the number n and divide it by 2, then divide by 2 
again, and so on, until you get a number that is less than or equal to 1. Then the number of 
divisions is equal (to the nearest integer) to log(n). 

As an example, consider the binary search algorithm from Subsection 7.4.1. This algorithm 
searches for an item in a sorted array. The problem size, n, can be taken to be the length of 
the array. Each step in the binary search algorithm divides the number of items still under 
consideration by 2, and the algorithm stops when the number of items under consideration is 
less than or equal to 1 (or sooner) . It follows that the number of steps for an array of length n 
is at most log(n). This means that the worst-case run time for binary search is 0(log(n)). (The 
average case run time is also 0(log(n)).) By comparison, the linear search algorithm, which 
was also presented in Subsection 7.4.1 has a run time that is 0(n). The notation gives us 



CHAPTER 8. CORRECTNESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY 



410 



a quantitative way to express and to understand the fact that binary search is "much faster" 
than linear search. 

In binary search, each step of the algorithm divides the problem size by 2. It often happens 
that some operation in an algorithm (not necessarily a single step) divides the problem size 
by 2. Whenever that happens, the logarithm function is likely to show up in an asymptotic 
analysis of the run time of the algorithm. 

Analysis of Algorithms is a large, fascinating field. We will only use a few of the most basic 
ideas from this field, but even those can be very helpful for understanding the differences among 
algorithms.

Exercises for Chapter 8 

1. Write a program that uses the following subroutine, from Subsection 8.3.3, to solve equa- (solution) 
tions specified by the user. 

/** 

* Returns the larger of the two roots of the quadratic equation 

* A*x*x + B*x + C = 0, provided it has any roots. If A == or 

* if the discriminant, B*B - 4*A*C, is negative, then an exception 

* of type IllegalArgumentException is thrown. 
*/ 

static public double root( double A, double B, double C ) 

throws IllegalArgumentException { 

if (A == 0) { 

throw new IllegalArgumentException( "A can't be zero."); 

} 

else { 

double disc = B*B - 4*A*C; 
if (disc < 0) 

throw new IllegalArgumentExceptionC'Discriminant < zero."); 
return (-B + Math. sqrt (disc)) / (2*A) ; 

} 

> 

Your program should allow the user to specify values for A, B, and C. It should call the 
subroutine to compute a solution of the equation. If no error occurs, it should print the 
root. However, if an error occurs, your program should catch that error and print an error 
message. After processing one equation, the program should ask whether the user wants 
to enter another equation. The program should continue until the user answers no. 

2. As discussed in Section 8.1, values of type int are limited to 32 bits. Integers that are too (solution) 
large to be represented in 32 bits cannot be stored in an int variable. Java has a standard 

class, java.math.Biglnteger, that addresses this problem. An object of type Biglnteger 
is an integer that can be arbitrarily large. (The maximum size is limited only by the 
amount of memory available to the Java Virtual Machine.) Since Biglntegers are objects, 
they must be manipulated using instance methods from the Biglnteger class. For example, 
you can't add two Biglntegers with the + operator. Instead, if N and M are variables that 
refer to Biglntegers, you can compute the sum of N and M with the function call N. add(M) . 
The value returned by this function is a new Biglnteger object that is equal to the sum of 
N and M. 

The Biglnteger class has a constructor new Biglnteger (str), where str is a string. 
The string must represent an integer, such as "3" or "39849823783783283733". If the string 
does not represent a legal integer, then the constructor throws a NumberFormatException. 

There are many instance methods in the Biglnteger class. Here are a few that you will 
find useful for this exercise. Assume that N and M are variables of type Biglnteger. 

• N.add(M) — a function that returns a Biglnteger representing the sum of N and M. 

• N. multiply (M) — a function that returns a Biglnteger representing the result of 
multiplying N times M. 



Exercises 



412 



• N . divide (M) — a function that returns a Biglnteger representing the result of divid- 
ing N by M, discarding the remainder. 

• N . signumO — a function that returns an ordinary int. The returned value represents 
the sign of the integer N. The returned value is 1 if N is greater than zero. It is -1 if 
N is less than zero. And it is if N is zero. 

• N . equals (M) — a function that returns a boolean value that is true if N and M have 
the same integer value. 

• N.toStringO — a function that returns a String representing the value of N. 

• N . testBit (k) — a function that returns a boolean value. The parameter k is an inte- 
ger. The return value is true if the k-th bit in N is 1, and it is false if the k-th bit is 0. 
Bits are numbered from right to left, starting with 0. Testing "if (N. testBit (0))" 
is an easy way to check whether N is even or odd. N. testBit (0) is true if and only 
if N is an odd number. 

For this exercise, you should write a program that prints 3N+1 sequences with starting 
values specified by the user. In this version of the program, you should use Biglntegers 
to represent the terms in the sequence. You can read the user's input into a String with 
the TextIO .getln() function. Use the input value to create the Biglnteger object that 
represents the starting point of the 3N+1 sequence. Don't forget to catch and handle the 
NumberFormatException that will occur if the user's input is not a legal integer! You 
should also check that the input number is greater than zero. 

If the user's input is legal, print out the 3N+1 sequence. Count the number of terms 
in the sequence, and print the count at the end of the sequence. Exit the program when 
the user inputs an empty line. 

A Roman numeral represents an integer using letters. Examples are XVII to represent 17, (solution) 
MCMLIII for 1953, and MMMCCCIII for 3303. By contrast, ordinary numbers such as 
17 or 1953 are called Arabic numerals. The following table shows the Arabic equivalent 
of all the single-letter Roman numerals: 

M 1000 X 10 

D 500 V 5 

C 100 II 
L 50 

When letters are strung together, the values of the letters are just added up, with the 
following exception. When a letter of smaller value is followed by a letter of larger value, 
the smaller value is subtracted from the larger value. For example, IV represents 5 - 1, or 
4. And MCMXCV is interpreted as M + CM + XC + V, or 1000 + (1000 - 100) + (100 - 
10) + 5, which is 1995. In standard Roman numerals, no more than three consecutive 
copies of the same letter are used. Following these rules, every number between 1 and 
3999 can be represented as a Roman numeral made up of the following one- and two-letter 
combinations: 

M 1000 X 10 

CM 900 IX 9 

D 500 V 5 

CD 400 IV 4 

C 100 II 

XC 90

L 50 
XL 40 

Write a class to represent Roman numerals. The class should have two constructors. 
One constructs a Roman numeral from a string such as "XVII" or "MCMXCV" . It should 
throw a NumberFormatException if the string is not a legal Roman numeral. The other 
constructor constructs a Roman numeral from an int. It should throw a NumberForma- 
tException if the int is outside the range 1 to 3999. 

In addition, the class should have two instance methods. The method toStringO 
returns the string that represents the Roman numeral. The method toIntO returns the 
value of the Roman numeral as an int. 

At some point in your class, you will have to convert an int into the string that 
represents the corresponding Roman numeral. One way to approach this is to gradually 
"move" value from the Arabic numeral to the Roman numeral. Here is the beginning of a 
routine that will do this, where number is the int that is to be converted: 

String roman = " " ; 
int N = number ; 
while (N >= 1000) { 

// Move 1000 from N to roman. 

roman += "M" ; 

N -= 1000; 

} 

while (N >= 900) { 

// Move 900 from N to roman. 
roman += "CM" ; 
N -= 900; 

} 

// Continue with other values from the above table. 

(You can save yourself a lot of typing in this routine if you use arrays in a clever way to 
represent the data in the above table.) 

Once you've written your class, use it in a main program that will read both Arabic 
numerals and Roman numerals entered by the user. If the user enters an Arabic numeral, 
print the corresponding Roman numeral. If the user enters a Roman numeral, print the 
corresponding Arabic numeral. (You can tell the difference by using TextIO .peekQ to 
peek at the first character in the user's input (see Subsection 8.2.2). If the first character 
is a digit, then the user's input is an Arabic numeral. Otherwise, it's a Roman numeral.) 
The program should end when the user inputs an empty line. 

4. The source code file Expr.java defines a class, Expr, that can be used to represent math- (solution) 
ematical expressions involving the variable x. The expression can use the operators +, -, 
*, /, and " (where " represents the operation of raising a number to a power). It can use 
mathematical functions such as sin, cos, abs, and In. See the source code file for full 
details. The Expr class uses some advanced techniques which have not yet been covered in 
this textbook. However, the interface is easy to understand. It contains only a constructor 
and two public methods. 

The constructor new Expr(def) creates an Expr object defined by a given expres- 
sion. The parameter, def, is a string that contains the definition. For example,

new Expr("x~2") or new Expr ("sin(x)+3*x") • If the parameter in the constructor call 
does not represent a legal expression, then the constructor throws an HlegalArgumentEx- 
ception. The message in the exception describes the error. 

If func is a variable of type Expr and num is of type double, then func . value (num) 
is a function that returns the value of the expression when the number num is substituted 
for the variable x in the expression. For example, if Expr represents the expression 3*x+l, 
then f unc . value (5) is 3*5+1, or 16. If the expression is undefined for the specified value 
of x, then the special value Double. NaN is returned; no exception is thrown. 

Finally, f unc . toStringO returns the definition of the expression. This is just the 
string that was used in the constructor that created the expression object. 

For this exercise, you should write a program that lets the user enter an expression. If 
the expression contains an error, print an error message. Otherwise, let the user enter some 
numerical values for the variable x. Print the value of the expression for each number that 
the user enters. However, if the expression is undefined for the specified value of x, print 
a message to that effect. You can use the boolean-valued function Double . isNaN(val) 
to check whether a number, val, is Double. NaN. 

The user should be able to enter as many values of x as desired. After that, the user 
should be able to enter a new expression. In the on-line version of this exercise, there is 
an applet that simulates my solution, so that you can see how it works. 

5. This exercise uses the class Expr, which was described in Exercise 8.4 and which is defined (solution) 
in the source code file Expr.java. For this exercise, you should write a GUI program that 
can graph a function, f (x) , whose definition is entered by the user. The program should 
have a text-input box where the user can enter an expression involving the variable x, 
such as x~2 or sin(x-3)/x. This expression is the definition of the function. When the 
user presses return in the text input box, the program should use the contents of the text 
input box to construct an object of type Expr. If an error is found in the definition, then 
the program should display an error message. Otherwise, it should display a graph of the 
function. (Note: A JTextField generates an ActionEvent when the user presses return.) 

The program will need a JPanel for displaying the graph. To keep things simple, 
this panel should represent a fixed region in the xy-plane, defined by -5 <= x <= 5 and 
-5 <= y <= 5. To draw the graph, compute a large number of points and connect them 
with line segments. (This method does not handle discontinuous functions properly; doing 
so is very hard, so you shouldn't try to do it for this exercise.) My program divides the 
interval -5 <= x <= 5 into 300 subintervals and uses the 301 endpoints of these subin- 
tervals for drawing the graph. Note that the function might be undefined at one of these 
x-values. In that case, you have to skip that point. 

A point on the graph has the form (x,y) where y is obtained by evaluating the 
user's expression at the given value of x. You will have to convert these real numbers to 
the integer coordinates of the corresponding pixel on the canvas. The formulas for the 
conversion are: 

a = (int) ( (x + 5)/10 * width ); 
b = (int)( (5 - y)/10 * height ); 

where a and b are the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the pixel, and width and 
height are the width and height of the panel. 

You can find an applet version of my solution in the on-line version of this exercise.

Chapter 9 



Linked Data Structures and 
Recursion 

In this chapter, we look at two advanced programming techniques, recursion and linked data 
structures, and some of their applications. Both of these techniques are related to the seemingly 
paradoxical idea of defining something in terms of itself. This turns out to be a remarkably 
powerful idea. 

A subroutine is said to be recursive if it calls itself, either directly or indirectly. What this 
means is that the subroutine is used in its own definition. Recursion can often be used to solve 
complex problems by reducing them to simpler problems of the same type. 

A reference to one object can be stored in an instance variable of another object. The 
objects are then said to be "linked." Complex data structures can be built by linking objects 
together. An especially interesting case occurs when an object contains a link to another object 
that belongs to the same class. In that case, the class is used in its own definition. Several 
important types of data structures are built using classes of this kind. 

9.1 Recursion 

At ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, you've probably been told that you can't define something in (online) 

terms of itself. Nevertheless, if it's done right, defining something at least partially in terms of 

itself can be a very powerful technique. A recursive definition is one that uses the concept 

or thing that is being defined as part of the definition. For example: An "ancestor" is either 

a parent or an ancestor of a parent. A "sentence" can be, among other things, two sentences 

joined by a conjunction such as "and." A "directory" is a part of a disk drive that can hold files 

and directories. In mathematics, a "set" is a collection of elements, which can themselves be 

sets. A "statement" in Java can be a while statement, which is made up of the word "while", 

a boolean-valued condition, and a statement. 

Recursive definitions can describe very complex situations with just a few words. A def- 
inition of the term "ancestor" without using recursion might go something like "a parent, or 
a grandparent, or a great-grandparent, or a great-great-grandparent, and so on." But saying 
"and so on" is not very rigorous. (I've often thought that recursion is really just a rigorous 
way of saying "and so on.") You run into the same problem if you try to define a "directory" 
as "a file that is a list of files, where some of the files can be lists of files, where some of those 
files can be lists of files, and so on." Trying to describe what a Java statement can look like, 
without using recursion in the definition, would be difficult and probably pretty comical. 



416 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



417 



Recursion can be used as a programming technique. A recursive subroutine is one that 
calls itself, either directly or indirectly. To say that a subroutine calls itself directly means 
that its definition contains a subroutine call statement that calls the subroutine that is being 
defined. To say that a subroutine calls itself indirectly means that it calls a second subroutine 
which in turn calls the first subroutine (either directly or indirectly). A recursive subroutine 
can define a complex task in just a few lines of code. In the rest of this section, we'll look at a 
variety of examples, and we'll see other examples in the rest of the book. 

9.1.1 Recursive Binary Search 

Let's start with an example that you've seen before: the binary search algorithm from Subsec- 
tion 7.4.1. Binary search is used to find a specified value in a sorted list of items (or, if it does 
not occur in the list, to determine that fact). The idea is to test the element in the middle of 
the list. If that element is equal to the specified value, you are done. If the specified value is 
less than the middle element of the list, then you should search for the value in the first half of 
the list. Otherwise, you should search for the value in the second half of the list. The method 
used to search for the value in the first or second half of the list is binary search. That is, you 
look at the middle element in the half of the list that is still under consideration, and either 
you've found the value you are looking for, or you have to apply binary search to one half of the 
remaining elements. And so on! This is a recursive description, and we can write a recursive 
subroutine to implement it. 

Before we can do that, though, there are two considerations that we need to take into 
account. Each of these illustrates an important general fact about recursive subroutines. First 
of all, the binary search algorithm begins by looking at the "middle element of the list." But 
what if the list is empty? If there are no elements in the list, then it is impossible to look 
at the middle element. In the terminology of Subsection 8.2.1, having a non-empty list is a 
"precondition" for looking at the middle element, and this is a clue that we have to modify 
the algorithm to take this precondition into account. What should we do if we find ourselves 
searching for a specified value in an empty list? The answer is easy: If the list is empty, we can 
be sure that the value does not occur in the list, so we can give the answer without any further 
work. An empty list is a base case for the binary search algorithm. A base case for a recursive 
algorithm is a case that is handled directly, rather than by applying the algorithm recursively. 
The binary search algorithm actually has another type of base case: If we find the element we 
are looking for in the middle of the list, we are done. There is no need for further recursion. 

The second consideration has to do with the parameters to the subroutine. The problem is 
phrased in terms of searching for a value in a list. In the original, non-recursive binary search 
subroutine, the list was given as an array. However, in the recursive approach, we have to be 
able to apply the subroutine recursively to just a part of the original list. Where the original 
subroutine was designed to search an entire array, the recursive subroutine must be able to 
search part of an array. The parameters to the subroutine must tell it what part of the array 
to search. This illustrates a general fact that in order to solve a problem recursively, it is often 
necessary to generalize the problem slightly. 

Here is a recursive binary search algorithm that searches for a given value in part of an 
array of integers: 

/** 

* Search in the array A in positions numbered lolndex to hilndex, 

* inclusive, for the specified value. If the value is found, return 

* the index in the array where it occurs. If the value is not found, 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



418 



* return -1. Precondition: The array must be sorted into increasing 

* order . 
*/ 

static int binarySearch(int [] A, int lolndex, int hilndex, int value) { 

if (lolndex > hilndex) { 

// The starting position comes after the final index, 
// so there are actually no elements in the specified 
// range. The value does not occur in this empty list! 
return -1; 

} 

else { 

// Look at the middle position in the list. If the 

// value occurs at that position, return that position. 

// Otherwise, search recursively in either the first 

// half or the second half of the list, 
int middle = (lolndex + hilndex) / 2; 
if (value == A [middle]) 

return middle; 
else if (value < A [middle]) 

return binarySearch(A , lolndex, middle - 1, value); 
else // value must be > A [middle] 

return binarySearch(A, middle + 1, hilndex, value); 

> 

} // end binarySearchO 

In this routine, the parameters lolndex and hilndex specify the part of the array that is 
to be searched. To search an entire array, it is only necessary to call binarySearch(A, 0, 
A. length - 1, value). In the two base cases — when there are no elements in the specified 
range of indices and when the value is found in the middle of the range — the subroutine can 
return an answer immediately, without using recursion. In the other cases, it uses a recursive 
call to compute the answer and returns that answer. 

Most people find it difficult at first to convince themselves that recursion actually works. 
The key is to note two things that must be true for recursion to work properly: There must 
be one or more base cases, which can be handled without using recursion. And when recursion 
is applied during the solution of a problem, it must be applied to a problem that is in some 
sense smaller — that is, closer to the base cases — than the original problem. The idea is that 
if you can solve small problems and if you can reduce big problems to smaller problems, then 
you can solve problems of any size. Ultimately, of course, the big problems have to be reduced, 
possibly in many, many steps, to the very smallest problems (the base cases). Doing so might 
involve an immense amount of detailed bookkeeping. But the computer does that bookkeeping, 
not you! As a programmer, you lay out the big picture: the base cases and the reduction of 
big problems to smaller problems. The computer takes care of the details involved in reducing 
a big problem, in many steps, all the way down to base cases. Trying to think through this 
reduction in detail is likely to drive you crazy, and will probably make you think that recursion 
is hard. Whereas in fact, recursion is an elegant and powerful method that is often the simplest 
approach to solving a complex problem. 

A common error in writing recursive subroutines is to violate one of the two rules: There 
must be one or more base cases, and when the subroutine is applied recursively, it must be 
applied to a problem that is smaller than the original problem. If these rules are violated, the 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



419 



result can be an infinite recursion, where the subroutine keeps calling itself over and over, 
without ever reaching a base case. Infinite recursion is similar to an infinite loop. However, 
since each recursive call to the subroutine uses up some of the computer's memory, a program 
that is stuck in an infinite recursion will run out of memory and crash before long. In Java, the 
program will crash with an exception of type StackOverf lowError. 

9.1.2 Towers of Hanoi 

We have been studying an algorithm, binary search, that can easily be implemented with a 
while loop, instead of with recursion. Next, we turn to a problem that is easy to solve with 
recursion but difficult to solve without it. This is a standard example known as "The Towers 
of Hanoi." The problem involves a stack of various-sized disks, piled up on a base in order of 
decreasing size. The object is to move the stack from one base to another, subject to two rules: 
Only one disk can be moved at a time, and no disk can ever be placed on top of a smaller disk. 
There is a third base that can be used as a "spare." The starting situation for a stack of ten 
disks is shown in the top half of the following picture. The situation after a number of moves 
have been made is shown in the bottom half of the picture. These pictures are from the applet 
at the end of Section 9.5 in the on-line version of this book, which displays an animation of the 
step-by-step solution of the problem. 




Stack stack 1 Stack 2 




The stacks after a number of moves. 



The problem is to move ten disks from Stack to Stack 1, subject to certain rules. Stack 
2 can be used as a spare location. Can we reduce this to smaller problems of the same type, 
possibly generalizing the problem a bit to make this possible? It seems natural to consider the 
size of the problem to be the number of disks to be moved. If there are N disks in Stack 0, we 
know that we will eventually have to move the bottom disk from Stack to Stack 1. But before 
we can do that, according to the rules, the first N-l disks must be on Stack 2. Once we've 
moved the N-th disk to Stack 1, we must move the other N-l disks from Stack 2 to Stack 1 to 
complete the solution. But moving N-l disks is the same type of problem as moving N disks, 
except that it's a smaller version of the problem. This is exactly what we need to do recursion! 
The problem has to be generalized a bit, because the smaller problems involve moving disks 
from Stack to Stack 2 or from Stack 2 to Stack 1, instead of from Stack to Stack 1. In the 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



420 



recursive subroutine that solves the problem, the stacks that serve as the source and destination 
of the disks have to be specified. It's also convenient to specify the stack that is to be used as 
a spare, even though we could figure that out from the other two parameters. The base case is 
when there is only one disk to be moved. The solution in this case is trivial: Just move the disk 
in one step. Here is a version of the subroutine that will print out step- by-step instructions for 
solving the problem: 

/** 

* Solve the problem of moving the number of disks specified 

* by the first parameter, from the stack specified by the 

* second parameter, to the stack specified by the third 

* parameter. The stack specified by the fourth parameter 

* is available for use as a spare. Stacks are specified by 

* number: 0, 1, or 2. Precondition: The number of disks is 

* a positive number. 
*/ 

static void TowersOf Hanoi (int disks, int from, int to, int spare) { 
if (disks == 1) { 

// There is only one disk to be moved. Just move it. 
System. out .println( "Move a disk from stack number " 
+ from + " to stack number " + to) ; 

} 

else { 

// Move all but one disk to the spare stack, then 

// move the bottom disk, then put all the other 

// disks on top of it. 
TowersOf Hanoi (disks-1 , from, spare, to); 
System. out .print In ("Move a disk from stack number " 

+ from + " to stack number " + to) ; 
TowersOf Hanoi (disks-1 , spare, to, from); 

} 

} 

This subroutine just expresses the natural recursive solution. The recursion works because 
each recursive call involves a smaller number of disks, and the problem is trivial to solve in 
the base case, when there is only one disk. To solve the "top level" problem of moving N disks 
from Stack to Stack 1, it should be called with the command TowersOf Hanoi (N , , 1 , 2) . The 
subroutine is demonstrated by the sample program TowersOfHanoi.java. 

Here, for example, is the output from the program when it is run with the number of disks 
set equal to 4:

The output of this program shows you a mass of detail that you don't really want to think 
about! The difficulty of following the details contrasts sharply with the simplicity and elegance 
of the recursive solution. Of course, you really want to leave the details to the computer. It's 
much more interesting to watch the applet from Section 9.5, which shows the solution graph- 
ically. That applet uses the same recursive subroutine, except that the System, out .println 
statements are replaced by commands that show the image of the disk being moved from one 
stack to another. (You might think about what happens when the precondition that the number 
of disks is positive is violated. The result is an example of infinite recursion.) 

There is, by the way, a story that explains the name of this problem. According to this 
story, on the first day of creation, a group of monks in an isolated tower near Hanoi were given 
a stack of 64 disks and were assigned the task of moving one disk every day, according to the 
rules of the Towers of Hanoi problem. On the day that they complete their task of moving all 
the disks from one stack to another, the universe will come to an end. But don't worry. The 
number of steps required to solve the problem for N disks is 2 N - 1, and 2 64 - 1 days is over 
50,000,000,000,000 years. We have a long way to go. 

(In the terminology of Section 8.5, the Towers of Hanoi algorithm has a run time that is 
0(2 n ), where n is the number of disks that have to be moved. Since the exponential function 
2 n grows so quickly, the Towers of Hanoi problem can be solved in practice only for a small 
number of disks.) 

* * * 

By the way, in addition to the graphical Towers of Hanoi applet at the end of this chapter, 
there are three other end-of-chapter applets in the on-line version of this text that use recursion. 
One, at the end of Section 12.5, is a visual implementation of the Quicksort algorithm that is 
discussed below. One is a maze-solving applet, at the end of Section 11.5. And the other is a 
pentominos applet, at the end of Section 10.5. 

The Maze applet first builds a random maze. It then tries to solve the maze by finding a 
path through the maze from the upper left corner to the lower right corner. This problem is 
actually very similar to a "blob-counting" problem that is considered later in this section. The 
recursive maze-solving routine starts from a given square, and it visits each neighboring square 
and calls itself recursively from there. The recursion ends if the routine finds itself at the lower 
right corner of the maze. 

The Pentominos applet is an implementation of a classic puzzle. A pentomino is a connected 
figure made up of five equal-sized squares. There are exactly twelve figures that can be made 
in this way, not counting all the possible rotations and reflections of the basic figures. The 
problem is to place the twelve pentominos on an 8-by-8 board in which four of the squares 
have already been marked as filled. The recursive solution looks at a board that has already 
been partially filled with pentominos. The subroutine looks at each remaining piece in turn. It 
tries to place that piece in the next available place on the board. If the piece fits, it calls itself 
recursively to try to fill in the rest of the solution. If that fails, then the subroutine goes on to 
the next piece. A generalized version of the pentominos applet with many more features can 
be found at http://math.hws.edu/xJava/PentominosSolver/. 

The applets are fun to watch, and they give nice visual representations of recursion.

9.1.3 A Recursive Sorting Algorithm 

Turning next to an application that is perhaps more practical, we'll look at a recursive algorithm 
for sorting an array. The selection sort and insertion sort algorithms, which were covered in 
Section 7.4, are fairly simple, but they are rather slow when applied to large arrays. Faster 
sorting algorithms are available. One of these is Quicksort, a recursive algorithm which turns 
out to be the fastest sorting algorithm in most situations. 

The Quicksort algorithm is based on a simple but clever idea: Given a list of items, select 
any item from the list. This item is called the pivot. (In practice, I'll just use the first item in 
the list.) Move all the items that are smaller than the pivot to the beginning of the list, and 
move all the items that are larger than the pivot to the end of the list. Now, put the pivot 
between the two groups of items. This puts the pivot in the position that it will occupy in the 
final, completely sorted array. It will not have to be moved again. We'll refer to this procedure 
as QuicksortStep. 

To apply QuicksortStep to a list of numbers, select one of the 
numbers, 23 in this case. Arrange the numbers so that numbers less 
than 23 lie to its left and numbers greater than 23 lie to its right. 

23 10 7 45 16 86 56 2 31 18 
18 10 7 2 16 23 86 56 31 45 

To finish sorting the list, sort the numbers to the left of 23, 
and sort the numbers to the right of 23. The nuber 23 itself is 
already in its final position and doesn't have to be moved again 

QuicksortStep is not recursive. It is used as a subroutine by Quicksort. The speed of 
Quicksort depends on having a fast implementation of QuicksortStep. Since it's not the main 
point of this discussion, I present one without much comment. 

/** 

* Apply QuicksortStep to the list of items in locations lo through, hi 

* in the array A. The value returned by this routine is the final 

* position of the pivot item in the array. 
*/ 

static int quicksortStep(int [] A, int lo, int hi) { 

int pivot = A[lo]; // Get the pivot value. 

// The numbers hi and lo mark the endpoints of a range 
//of numbers that have not yet been tested. Decrease hi 
// and increase lo until they become equal, moving numbers 
// bigger than pivot so that they lie above hi and moving 
// numbers less than the pivot so that they lie below lo. 
// When we begin, A [lo] is an available space, since its 
// value has been moved into the local variable, pivot. 

while (hi > lo) { 

while (hi > lo && A [hi] >= pivot) { 

// Move hi down past numbers greater than pivot. 
// These numbers do not have to be moved. 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



423 



hi—; 

} 

if (hi == lo) 
break; 

// The number A [hi] is less than pivot. Move it into 
// the available space at A[lo], leaving an available 
// space at A [hi] . 

A[lo] = A [hi] ; 
lo++; 

while (hi > lo && A[lo] <= pivot) { 

// Move lo up past numbers less than pivot. 
// These numbers do not have to be moved. 
lo++; 

} 

if (hi == lo) 
break; 

// The number A[lo] is greater than pivot. Move it into 
// the available space at A [hi], leaving an available 
// space at A[lo] . 

A [hi] = A[lo] ; 
hi—; 

} // end while 

// At this point, lo has become equal to hi, and there is 
// an available space at that position. This position lies 
// between numbers less than pivot and numbers greater than 
// pivot. Put pivot in this space and return its location. 

A[lo] = pivot; 
return lo ; 

} // end QuicksortStep 

With this subroutine in hand, Quicksort is easy. The Quicksort algorithm for sorting a list 
consists of applying QuicksortStep to the list, then applying Quicksort recursively to the items 
that lie to the left of the new position of the pivot and to the items that lie to the right of that 
position. Of course, we need base cases. If the list has only one item, or no items, then the list 
is already as sorted as it can ever be, so Quicksort doesn't have to do anything in these cases. 

/** 

* Apply quicksort to put the array elements between 

* position lo and position hi into increasing order. 
*/ 

static void quicksort (int [] A, int lo, int hi) { 
if (hi <= lo) { 

// The list has length one or zero. Nothing needs 
// to be done, so just return from the subroutine, 
return; 

} 

else { 

// Apply quicksortStep and get the new pivot position. 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



424 



// Then apply quicksort to sort the items that 

// precede the pivot and the items that follow it. 

int pivotPosition = quicksortStep(A, lo, hi); 

quicksort(A, lo, pivotPosition - 1); 

quicksort(A, pivotPosition + 1, hi); 

> 

} 

As usual, we had to generalize the problem. The original problem was to sort an array, but 
the recursive algorithm is set up to sort a specified part of an array. To sort an entire array, A, 
using the quicksort () subroutine, you would call quicksort (A, 0, A. length - 1). 

Quicksort is an interesting example from the point of view of the analysis of algorithms 
(Section 8.5), because its average case run time differs greatly from its worst case run time. 
Here is a very informal analysis, starting with the average case: Note that an application of 
quicksortStep divides a problem into two sub-problems. On the average, the subproblems will 
be of approximately the same size. A problem of size n is divided into two problems that are 
roughly of size n/2; these are then divided into four problems that are roughly of size n/4; 
and so on. Since the problem size is divided by 2 on each level, there will be approximately 
log(n) levels of subdivision. The amount of processing on each level is proportional to n. (On 
the top level, each element in the array is looked at and possibly moved. On the second level, 
where there are two subproblems, every element but one in the array is part of one of those 
two subproblems and must be looked at and possibly moved, so there is a total of about n 
steps in both subproblems combined. Similarly, on the third level, there are four subproblems 
and a total of about n steps in the four subproblems on that level. . . .) With a total of n steps 
on each level and approximately log(n) levels in the average case, the average case run time 
for Quicksort is 0(n*log(n)). This analysis assumes that quicksortStep divides a problem into 
two approximately equal parts. However, in the worst case, each application of quicksortStep 
divides a problem of size n into a problem of size and a problem of size n-1. This happens 
when the pivot element ends up at the beginning or end of the array. In this worst case, there 
are n levels of subproblems, and the worst-case run time is 0(n 2 ). The worst case is very 
rare — it depends on the items in the array being arranged in a very special way, so the average 
performance of Quicksort can be very good even though it is not so good in certain rare cases. 
There are sorting algorithms that have both an average case and a worst case run time of 
0(n*log(n)). One example is MergeSort, which you can look up if you are interested. 

9.1.4 Blob Counting 

The program Blobs .java displays a grid of small white and gray squares. The gray squares are 
considered to be "filled" and the white squares are "empty." For the purposes of this example, 
we define a "blob" to consist of a filled square and all the filled squares that can be reached 
from it by moving up, down, left, and right through other filled squares. If the user clicks on 
any filled square in the program, the computer will count the squares in the blob that contains 
the clicked square, and it will change the color of those squares to red. The program has several 
controls. There is a "New Blobs" button; clicking this button will create a new random pattern 
in the grid. A pop-up menu specifies the approximate percentage of squares that will be filled 
in the new pattern. The more filled squares, the larger the blobs. And a button labeled "Count 
the Blobs" will tell you how many different blobs there are in the pattern. You can try an applet 
version of the program in the on-line version of the book. Here is a picture of the program after 
the user has clicked one of the filled squares:

Count the Blobs 




New Blobs 






40% fill 





Recursion is used in this program to count the number of squares in a blob. Without 
recursion, this would be a very difficult thing to implement. Recursion makes it relatively easy, 
but it still requires a new technique, which is also useful in a number of other applications. 

The data for the grid of squares is stored in a two dimensional array of boolean values, 

boolean[][] filled; 

The value of filled [r] [c] is true if the square in row r and in column c of the grid is 
filled. The number of rows in the grid is stored in an instance variable named rows, and the 
number of columns is stored in columns. The program uses a recursive instance method named 
getBlobSizeO to count the number of squares in the blob that contains the square in a given 
row r and column c. If there is no filled square at position (r,c), then the answer is zero. 
Otherwise, getBlobSizeO has to count all the filled squares that can be reached from the 
square at position (r,c). The idea is to use getBlobSizeO recursively to get the number of 
filled squares that can be reached from each of the neighboring positions: (r+l,c), (r-l,c), 
(r,c+l), and (r,c-l). Add up these numbers, and add one to count the square at (r,c) 
itself, and you get the total number of filled squares that can be reached from (r,c). Here is 
an implementation of this algorithm, as stated. Unfortunately, it has a serious flaw: It leads to 
an infinite recursion! 

int getBlobSizednt r, int c) { //BUGGY, INCORRECT VERSION!! 
II This INCORRECT method tries to count all the filled 
// squares that can be reached from position (r,c) in the grid, 
if (r < I I r >= rows II c < II c >= columns) { 

// This position is not in the grid, so there is 
//no blob at this position. Return a blob size of zero, 
return ; 

} 

if (filled [r] [c] == false) { 

// This square is not part of a blob, so return zero, 
return ; 

> 

int size =1; // Count the square at this position, then count the 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



426 



// the blobs that are connected to this square 

// horizontally or vertically, 
size += getBlobSize (r-1 , c) ; 
size += getBlobSize (r+1 , c) ; 
size += getBlobSize (r , c-1) ; 
size += getBlobSize (r , c+1) ; 
return size; 
} // end INCORRECT getBlobSize () 

Unfortunately, this routine will count the same square more than once. In fact, it will try to 
count each square infinitely often! Think of yourself standing at position (r,c) and trying to 
follow these instructions. The first instruction tells you to move up one row. You do that, and 
then you apply the same procedure. As one of the steps in that procedure, you have to move 
down one row and apply the same procedure yet again. But that puts you back at position 
(r,c)! From there, you move up one row, and from there you move down one row. . . . Back 
and forth forever! We have to make sure that a square is only counted and processed once, so 
we don't end up going around in circles. The solution is to leave a trail of breadcrumbs — or on 
the computer a trail of boolean values — to mark the squares that you've already visited. Once 
a square is marked as visited, it won't be processed again. The remaining, unvisited squares 
are reduced in number, so definite progress has been made in reducing the size of the problem. 
Infinite recursion is avoided! 

A second boolean array, visited [r] [c] , is used to keep track of which squares have already 
been visited and processed. It is assumed that all the values in this array are set to false before 
getBlobSize () is called. As getBlobSize () encounters unvisited squares, it marks them as 
visited by setting the corresponding entry in the visited array to true. When getBlobSize () 
encounters a square that it has already visited, it doesn't count it or process it further. The 
technique of "marking" items as they are encountered is one that is used over and over in the 
programming of recursive algorithms. Here is the corrected version of getBlobSize (), with 
changes shown in italic: 

/** 

* Counts the squares in the blob at position (r,c) in the 

* grid. Squares are only counted if they are filled and 

* unvisited. If this routine is called for a position that 

* has been visited, the return value will be zero. 
*/ 

int getBlobSize (int r, int c) { 

if (r < II r >= rows II c < II c >= columns) { 

// This position is not in the grid, so there is 
//no blob at this position. Return a blob size of zero, 
return ; 

} 

if (f illed [r] [c] == false // visited [r] [c] == true) { 

// This square is not part of a blob, or else it has 
// already been counted, so return zero, 
return ; 

} 

visited [r] [c] = true; // Mark the square as visited so that 

// we won't count it again during the 
// following recursive calls. 

int size =1; // Count the square at this position, then count the 
// the blobs that are connected to this square 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



427 



// horizontally or vertically, 
size += getBlobSize (r-1 , c) 
size += getBlobSize (r+1 , c) 
size += getBlobSize (r , c-1) 
size += getBlobSize (r , c+1) 
return size; 
} // end getBlobSize () 

In the program, this method is used to determine the size of a blob when the user clicks 
on a square. After getBlobSize () has performed its task, all the squares in the blob are still 
marked as visited. The paintComponent () method draws visited squares in red, which makes 
the blob visible. The getBlobSize () method is also used for counting blobs. This is done by 
the following method, which includes comments to explain how it works: 

/** 

* When the user clicks the "Count the Blobs" button, find the 

* number of blobs in the grid and report the number in the 

* message label. 
*/ 

void countBlobsO { 

int count =0; // Number of blobs. 

/* First clear out the visited array. The getBlobSize () method 
will mark every filled square that it finds by setting the 
corresponding element of the array to true. Once a square 
has been marked as visited, it will stay marked until all the 
blobs have been counted. This will prevent the same blob from 
being counted more than once. */ 

for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) 

for (int c = 0; c < columns; C++) 
visited [r] [c] = false; 

/* For each position in the grid, call getBlobSize () to get the 
size of the blob at that position. If the size is not zero, 
count a blob. Note that if we come to a position that was part 
of a previously counted blob, getBlobSize () will return and 
the blob will not be counted again. */ 

for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) 

for (int c = 0; c < columns; C++) { 
if (getBlobSize (r,c) > 0) 
count++; 

} 

repaintO; // Note that all the filled squares will be red, 
// since they have all now been visited. 

message . setText ( "The number of blobs is " + count); 

} // end countBlobsO

9.2 Linked Data Structures 

Every useful object contains instance variables. When the type of an instance variable is (online) 
given by a class or interface name, the variable can hold a reference to another object. Such 
a reference is also called a pointer, and we say that the variable points to the object. (Of 
course, any variable that can contain a reference to an object can also contain the special value 
null, which points to nowhere.) When one object contains an instance variable that points to 
another object, we think of the objects as being "linked" by the pointer. Data structures of 
great complexity can be constructed by linking objects together. 

9.2.1 Recursive Linking 

Something interesting happens when an object contains an instance variable that can refer to 
another object of the same type. In that case, the definition of the object's class is recursive. 
Such recursion arises naturally in many cases. For example, consider a class designed to repre- 
sent employees at a company. Suppose that every employee except the boss has a supervisor, 
who is another employee of the company. Then the Employee class would naturally contain an 
instance variable of type Employee that points to the employee's supervisor: 

/** 

* An object of type Employee holds data about one employee. 
*/ 

public class Employee { 

String name; // Name of the employee. 

Employee supervisor; // The employee's supervisor. 

// (Other instance variables and methods.) 

} // end class Employee 

If emp is a variable of type Employee, then emp . supervisor is another variable of type 
Employee. If emp refers to the boss, then the value of emp . supervisor should be null to 
indicate the fact that the boss has no supervisor. If we wanted to print out the name of the 
employee's supervisor, for example, we could use the following Java statement: 

if ( emp . supervisor == null) { 

System. out .println( emp. name + " is the boss and has no supervisor!" ); 

} 

else { 

System. out .print ( "The supervisor of " + emp. name + " is " ) ; 
System. out .println( emp. supervisor. name ); 

} 

Now, suppose that we want to know how many levels of supervisors there are between a 
given employee and the boss. We just have to follow the chain of command through a series of 
supervisor links, and count how many steps it takes to get to the boss: 

if ( emp . supervisor == null ) { 

System. out .println( emp. name + " is the boss!" ); 

} 

else { 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



429 



Employee runner; // For "running" up the chain of command. 

runner = emp. supervisor; 

if ( runner . supervisor == null) { 

System. out .println( emp. name + " reports directly to the boss." ); 

} 

else { 

int count = ; 

while ( runner . supervisor != null ) { 

count++; // Count the supervisor on this level. 

runner = runner. supervisor; // Move up to the next level. 

} 

System. out .println( "There are " + count 

+ " supervisors between " + emp. name 
+ " and the boss. " ) ; 

} 

} 

As the while loop is executed, runner points in turn to the original employee (emp), then 
to emp's supervisor, then to the supervisor of emp's supervisor, and so on. The count 
variable is incremented each time runner "visits" a new employee. The loop ends when 
runner . supervisor is null, which indicates that runner has reached the boss. At that point, 
count has counted the number of steps between emp and the boss. 

In this example, the supervisor variable is quite natural and useful. In fact, data structures 
that are built by linking objects together are so useful that they are a major topic of study 
in computer science. We'll be looking at a few typical examples. In this section and the 
next, we'll be looking at linked lists. A linked list consists of a chain of objects of the same 
type, linked together by pointers from one object to the next. This is much like the chain of 
supervisors between emp and the boss in the above example. It's also possible to have more 
complex situations, in which one object can contain links to several other objects. We'll look 
at an example of this in Section 9.4.

When an object contains a reference to an object of the 
same type, then several objects can be linked together 
into a list. Each object refers to the next object.

9.2.2 Linked Lists 

For most of the examples in the rest of this section, linked lists will be constructed out of objects 
belonging to the class Node which is defined as follows: 

class Node { 
String item; 
Node next; 

} 

The term node is often used to refer to one of the objects in a linked data structure. Objects 
of type Node can be chained together as shown in the top part of the above picture. Each 
node holds a String and a pointer to the next node in the list (if any). The last node in such a 
list can always be identified by the fact that the instance variable next in the last node holds 
the value null instead of a pointer to another node. The purpose of the chain of nodes is to 
represent a list of strings. The first string in the list is stored in the first node, the second string 
is stored in the second node, and so on. The pointers and the node objects are used to build 
the structure, but the data that we want to represent is the list of strings. Of course, we could 
just as easily represent a list of integers or a list of JButtons or a list of any other type of data 
by changing the type of the item that is stored in each node. 

Although the Nodes in this example are very simple, we can use them to illustrate the 
common operations on linked lists. Typical operations include deleting nodes from the list, 
inserting new nodes into the list, and searching for a specified String among the items in the 
list. We will look at subroutines to perform all of these operations, among others. 

For a linked list to be used in a program, that program needs a variable that refers to the 
first node in the list. It only needs a pointer to the first node since all the other nodes in the list 
can be accessed by starting at the first node and following links along the list from one node to 
the next. In my examples, I will always use a variable named head, of type Node, that points 
to the first node in the linked list. When the list is empty, the value of head is null. 



head: 



For a list to be useful, there must be a variable 
that points to the first node in the list. Here, 
the variable head serves this purpose.

9.2.3 Basic Linked List Processing 

It is very common to want to process all the items in a linked list in some way. The common 
pattern is to start at the head of the list, then move from each node to the next by following 
the pointer in the node, stopping when the null that marks the end of the list is reached. If 
head is a variable of type Node that points to the first node in the list, then the general form 
of the code for processing all the items in a linked list is: 

Node runner; // A pointer that will be used to traverse the list, 
runner = head; // Start with runner pointing to the head of the list, 
while ( runner != null ) { // Continue until null is encountered. 

process ( runner. item ); //Do something with the item in the current node. 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



431 



runner = runner. next; // Move on to the next node in the list. 

} 

Our only access to the list is through the variable head, so we start by getting a copy of the 
value in head with the assignment statement runner = head. We need a copy of head because 
we are going to change the value of runner. We can't change the value of head, or we would 
lose our only access to the list! The variable runner will point to each node of the list in turn. 
When runner points to one of the nodes in the list, runner .next is a pointer to the next node 
in the list, so the assignment statement runner = runner. next moves the pointer along the 
list from each node to the next. We know that we've reached the end of the list when runner 
becomes equal to null. Note that our list-processing code works even for an empty list, since 
for an empty list the value of head is null and the body of the while loop is not executed at 
all. As an example, we can print all the strings in a list of Strings by saying: 

Node runner = head; 

while ( runner ! = null ) { 

System. out .println( runner . item ); 

runner = runner . next ; 

} 

The while loop can, by the way, be rewritten as a for loop. Remember that even though the 
loop control variable in a for loop is often numerical, that is not a requirement. Here is a for 
loop that is equivalent to the above while loop: 

for ( Node runner = head; runner != null; runner = runner. next ) { 
System. out .println( runner. item ); 

} 

Similarly, we can traverse a list of integers to add up all the numbers in the list. A linked 
list of integers can be constructed using the class 

public class IntNode { 

int item; // One of the integers in the list. 

IntNode next; // Pointer to the next node in the list. 

} 

If head is a variable of type IntNode that points to a linked list of integers, we can find the sum 
of the integers in the list using: 

int sum = ; 

IntNode runner = head; 

while ( runner ! = null ) { 

sum = sum + runner. item; // Add current item to the sum. 

runner = runner . next ; 

} 

System. out .println( "The sum of the list of items is " + sum); 

It is also possible to use recursion to process a linked list. Recursion is rarely the natural 
way to process a list, since it's so easy to use a loop to traverse the list. However, understanding 
how to apply recursion to lists can help with understanding the recursive processing of more 
complex data structures. A non-empty linked list can be thought of as consisting of two parts: 
the head of the list, which is just the first node in the list, and the tail of the list, which 
consists of the remainder of the list after the head. Note that the tail is itself a linked list and 
that it is shorter than the original list (by one node). This is a natural setup for recursion, 
where the problem of processing a list can be divided into processing the head and recursively 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



432 



processing the tail. The base case occurs in the case of an empty list (or sometimes in the case 
of a list of length one). For example, here is a recursive algorithm for adding up the numbers 
in a linked list of integers: 

if the list is empty then 

return (since there are no numbers to be added up) 
otherwise 

let listsum = the number in the head node 

let tailsum be the sum of the numbers in the tail list (recursively) 
add tailsum to listsum 
return listsum 

One remaining question is, how do we get the tail of a non-empty linked list? If head is a 
variable that points to the head node of the list, then head. next is a variable that points to 
the second node of the list — and that node is in fact the first node of the tail. So, we can view 
head. next as a pointer to the tail of the list. One special case is when the original list consists 
of a single node. In that case, the tail of the list is empty, and head. next is null. Since an 
empty list is represented by a null pointer, head . next represents the tail of the list even in this 
special case. This allows us to write a recursive list-summing function in Java as 

/** 

* Compute the sum of all the integers in a linked list of integers. 

* Sparam head a pointer to the first node in the linked list 
*/ 

public static int addltemsInList ( IntNode head ) { 
if ( head == null ) { 

// Base case: The list is empty, so the sum is zero, 
return ; 

} 

else { 

// Recursive case: The list is non-empty. Find the sum of 
// the tail list, and add that to the item in the head node. 
// (Note that this case could be written simply as 
// return head. item + addltemsInList ( head. next );) 
int listsum = head. item; 

int tailsum = addltemsInList ( head. next ); 
listsum = listsum + tailsum; 
return listsum; 

> 

} 

I will finish by presenting a list-processing problem that is easy to solve with recursion, but 
quite tricky to solve without it. The problem is to print out all the strings in a linked list of 
strings in the reverse of the order in which they occur in the list. Note that when we do this, 
the item in the head of a list is printed out after all the items in the tail of the list. This leads 
to the following recursive routine. You should convince yourself that it works, and you should 
think about trying to do the same thing without using recursion: 

public static void printReversed( Node head ) { 
if ( head == null ) { 

// Base case: The list is empty, and there is nothing to print, 
return; 

} 

else { 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



433 



// Recursive case: The list is non-empty. 
printReversed( head. next ); // Print strings from tail, in reverse order. 
System. out .println( head. item ); // Then print string from head node. 

} 

} 

* * * 

In the rest of this section, we'll look at a few more advanced operations on a linked list 
of strings. The subroutines that we consider are instance methods in a class, StringList. An 
object of type StringList represents a linked list of strings. The class has a private instance 
variable named head of type Node that points to the first node in the list, or is null if the list is 
empty. Instance methods in class StringList access head as a global variable. The source code 
for StringList is in the file StringList Java, and it is used in the sample program ListDemo.java. 

Suppose we want to know whether a specified string, searchltem, occurs somewhere in a 
list of strings. We have to compare searchltem to each item in the list. This is an example of 
basic list traversal and processing. However, in this case, we can stop processing if we find the 
item that we are looking for. 

/** 

* Searches the list for a specified item. 

* Oparam searchltem the item that is to be searched for 

* Oreturn true if searchltem is one of the items in the list or false if 

* searchltem does not occur in the list. 
*/ 

public boolean find(String searchltem) { 

Node runner; // A pointer for traversing the list. 

runner = head; // Start by looking at the head of the list. 

// (head is an instance variable! ) 

while ( runner ! = null ) { 

// Go through the list looking at the string in each 
// node. If the string is the one we are looking for, 
// return true, since the string has been found in the list, 
if ( runner . item. equals (searchltem) ) 
return true ; 

runner = runner. next; // Move on to the next node. 

> 

// At this point, we have looked at all the items in the list 
// without finding searchltem. Return false to indicate that 
// the item does not exist in the list. 

return false; 

} // end findO 

It is possible that the list is empty, that is, that the value of head is null. We should be 
careful that this case is handled properly. In the above code, if head is null, then the body 
of the while loop is never executed at all, so no nodes are processed and the return value is 
false. This is exactly what we want when the list is empty, since the searchltem can't occur 
in an empty list. 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



434 



9.2.4 Inserting into a Linked List 

The problem of inserting a new item into a linked list is more difficult, at least in the case 
where the item is inserted into the middle of the list. (In fact, it's probably the most difficult 
operation on linked data structures that you'll encounter in this chapter.) In the StringList 
class, the items in the nodes of the linked list are kept in increasing order. When a new item 
is inserted into the list, it must be inserted at the correct position according to this ordering. 
This means that, usually, we will have to insert the new item somewhere in the middle of the 
list, between two existing nodes. To do this, it's convenient to have two variables of type Node, 
which refer to the existing nodes that will lie on either side of the new node. In the following 
illustration, these variables are previous and runner. Another variable, newNode, refers to the 
new node. In order to do the insertion, the link from previous to runner must be "broken," 
and new links from previous to newNode and from newNode to runner must be added: 




Inserting a new node 
into the middle of a list 

Once we have previous and runner pointing to the right nodes, the command 
"previous .next = newNode;" can be used to make previous .next point to the new node, 
instead of to the node indicated by runner. And the command "newNode .next = runner" will 
set newNode. next to point to the correct place. However, before we can use these commands, 
we need to set up runner and previous as shown in the illustration. The idea is to start at 
the first node of the list, and then move along the list past all the items that are less than the 
new item. While doing this, we have to be aware of the danger of "falling off the end of the 
list." That is, we can't continue if runner reaches the end of the list and becomes null. If 
insertltem is the item that is to be inserted, and if we assume that it does, in fact, belong 
somewhere in the middle of the list, then the following code would correctly position previous 
and runner: 

Node runner, previous; 

previous = head; // Start at the beginning of the list, 

runner = head. next; 

while ( runner != null && runner . item. compareTo (insertltem) < ) { 
previous = runner; // "previous = previous .next" would also work 
runner = runner . next ; 

} 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



435 



(This uses the compareToO instance method from the String class to test whether the item in 
the node is less than the item that is being inserted. See Subsection 2.3.2.) 

This is fine, except that the assumption that the new node is inserted into the middle of 
the list is not always valid. It might be that insertltem is less than the first item of the list. 
In that case, the new node must be inserted at the head of the list. This can be done with the 
instructions 

newNode . next = head; // Make newNode . next point to the old head, 
head = newNode; // Make newNode the new head of the list. 

It is also possible that the list is empty. In that case, newNode will become the first and only 
node in the list. This can be accomplished simply by setting head = newNode. The following 
insert () method from the StringList class covers all of these possibilities: 
/** 

* Insert a specified item to the list, keeping the list in order. 

* Oparam insertltem the item that is to be inserted. 
*/ 

public void insert (String insertltem) { 

Node newNode; // A Node to contain the new item. 

newNode = new NodeO; 

newNode. item = insertltem; // (N.B. newNode. next is null.) 

if ( head == null ) { 

// The new item is the first (and only) one in the list. 
// Set head to point to it. 
head = newNode ; 

} 

else if ( head. item. compareTo (insertltem) >= ) { 

// The new item is less than the first item in the list, 
// so it has to be inserted at the head of the list. 

newNode. next = head; 

head = newNode ; 

} 

else { 

// The new item belongs somewhere after the first item 

// in the list. Search for its proper position and insert it. 

Node runner; // A node for traversing the list. 

Node previous; // Always points to the node preceding runner. 

runner = head. next; // Start by looking at the SECOND position. 

previous = head; 

while ( runner != null && runner. item. compareTo (insertltem) < ) { 
// Move previous and runner along the list until runner 
// falls off the end or hits a list element that is 
// greater than or equal to insertltem. When this 
// loop ends, previous indicates the position where 
// insertltem must be inserted. 

previous = runner; 

runner = runner . next ; 

} 

newNode. next = runner; // Insert newNode after previous, 

previous .next = newNode; 

} 

} // end insert () 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



436 



If you were paying close attention to the above discussion, you might have noticed that 
there is one special case which is not mentioned. What happens if the new node has to be 
inserted at the end of the list? This will happen if all the items in the list are less than the new 
item. In fact, this case is already handled correctly by the subroutine, in the last part of the 
if statement. If insertltem is greater than all the items in the list, then the while loop will 
end when runner has traversed the entire list and become null. However, when that happens, 
previous will be left pointing to the last node in the list. Setting previous .next = newNode 
adds newNode onto the end of the list. Since runner is null, the command newNode.next = 
runner sets newNode .next to null, which is exactly what is needed to mark the end of the list. 

9.2.5 Deleting from a Linked List 

The delete operation is similar to insert, although a little simpler. There are still special cases 
to consider. When the first node in the list is to be deleted, then the value of head has to be 
changed to point to what was previously the second node in the list. Since he ad. next refers to 
the second node in the list, this can be done by setting head = head. next. (Once again, you 
should check that this works when head. next is null, that is, when there is no second node in 
the list. In that case, the list becomes empty.) 

If the node that is being deleted is in the middle of the list, then we can set up previous and 
runner with runner pointing to the node that is to be deleted and with previous pointing to the 
node that precedes that node in the list. Once that is done, the command "previous .next = 
runner .next;" will delete the node. The deleted node will be garbage collected. I encourage 
you to draw a picture for yourself to illustrate this operation. Here is the complete code for the 
delete () method: 

/** 

* Delete a specified item from the list, if that item is present. 

* If multiple copies of the item are present in the list, only 

* the one that comes first in the list is deleted. 

* Oparam deleteltem the item to be deleted 

* Oreturn true if the item was found and deleted, or false if the item 

* was not in the list. 
*/ 

public boolean delete (String deleteltem) { 

if ( head == null ) { 

// The list is empty, so it certainly doesn't contain deleteString . 
return false; 

} 

else if ( head. item. equals (deleteltem) ) { 

// The string is the first item of the list. Remove it. 
head = head. next; 
return true; 

} 

else { 

// The string, if it occurs at all, is somewhere beyond the 

// first element of the list. Search the list. 
Node runner; // A node for traversing the list. 

Node previous; // Always points to the node preceding runner, 
runner = head. next; // Start by looking at the SECOND list node, 
previous = head; 

while ( runner != null && runner. item. compareTo (deleteltem) < ) { 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



437 



// Move previous and runner along the list until runner 
// falls off the end or hits a list element that is 
// greater than or equal to deleteltem. When this 
// loop ends, runner indicates the position where 
// deleteltem must be, if it is in the list. 

previous = runner; 

runner = runner . next ; 

} 

if ( runner != null && runner . item. equals (deleteltem) ) { 
// Runner points to the node that is to be deleted. 
// Remove it by changing the pointer in the previous node. 

previous .next = runner. next; 

return true ; 

} 

else { 

// The item does not exist in the list . 
return false; 

} 

> 

} // end delete () 



9.3 Stacks, Queues, and ADTs 

A LINKED LIST is a particular type of data structure, made up of objects linked together by (online) 

pointers. In the previous section, we used a linked list to store an ordered list of Strings, and 

we implemented insert, delete, and find operations on that list. However, we could easily 

have stored the list of Strings in an array or Array List, instead of in a linked list. We could still 

have implemented the same operations on the list. The implementations of these operations 

would have been different, but their interfaces and logical behavior would still be the same. 

The term abstract data type, or ADT, refers to a set of possible values and a set of 
operations on those values, without any specification of how the values are to be represented 
or how the operations are to be implemented. An "ordered list of strings" can be defined as an 
abstract data type. Any sequence of Strings that is arranged in increasing order is a possible 
value of this data type. The operations on the data type include inserting a new string, deleting 
a string, and finding a string in the list. There are often several different ways to implement the 
same abstract data type. For example, the "ordered list of strings" ADT can be implemented 
as a linked list or as an array. A program that only depends on the abstract definition of the 
ADT can use either implementation, interchangeably. In particular, the implementation of the 
ADT can be changed without affecting the program as a whole. This can make the program 
easier to debug and maintain, so ADTs are an important tool in software engineering. 

In this section, we'll look at two common abstract data types, stacks and queues. Both 
stacks and queues are often implemented as linked lists, but that is not the only possible 
implementation. You should think of the rest of this section partly as a discussion of stacks 
and queues and partly as a case study in ADTs. 

9.3.1 Stacks 

A stack consists of a sequence of items, which should be thought of as piled one on top of 
the other like a physical stack of boxes or cafeteria trays. Only the top item on the stack is 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



438 



accessible at any given time. It can be removed from the stack with an operation called pop. 
An item lower down on the stack can only be removed after all the items on top of it have been 
popped off the stack. A new item can be added to the top of the stack with an operation called 
push. We can make a stack of any type of items. If, for example, the items are values of type 
int, then the push and pop operations can be implemented as instance methods 

• void push (int newltem) — Add newltem to top of stack. 

• int pop() — Remove the top int from the stack and return it. 

It is an error to try to pop an item from an empty stack, so it is important to be able to tell 
whether a stack is empty. We need another stack operation to do the test, implemented as an 
instance method 

• boolean isEmptyO — Returns true if the stack is empty. 

This defines a "stack of ints" as an abstract data type. This ADT can be implemented in several 
ways, but however it is implemented, its behavior must correspond to the abstract mental image 
of a stack. 

In a stack, all operations take place at the 
"top" of the stack. The "push" operation 
adds an item to the top of the stack. 
The "pop" operation removes the item on 
the top of the stack and returns it.

Original stack. After pop(). After push(83). 

In the linked list implementation of a stack, the top of the stack is actually the node at the 
head of the list. It is easy to add and remove nodes at the front of a linked list — much easier 
than inserting and deleting nodes in the middle of the list. Here is a class that implements the 
"stack of ints" ADT using a linked list. (It uses a static nested class to represent the nodes of 
the linked list. If the nesting bothers you, you could replace it with a separate Node class.) 

public class StackOflnts { 

/** 

* An object of type Node holds one of the items in the linked list 

* that represents the stack. 
*/ 

private static class Node { 
int item; 
Node next ; 

} 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



439 



private Node top; // Pointer to the Node that is at the top of 
// of the stack. If top == null, then the 
// stack is empty. 

/** 

* Add N to the top of the stack. 
*/ 

public void push( int N ) { 

Node newTop; // A Node to hold the new item. 

newTop = new NodeO; 

newTop.item = N; // Store N in the new Node. 

newTop. next = top; // The new Node points to the old top. 

top = newTop; // The new item is now on top. 

> 

/** 

* Remove the top item from the stack, and return it. 

* Throws an IllegalStateException if the stack is empty when 

* this method is called. 
*/ 

public int pop() { 
if ( top == null ) 

throw new IllegalStateExceptionO'Can't pop from an empty stack."); 
int topltem = top. item; // The item that is being popped, 
top = top. next; // The previous second item is now on top. 

return topltem; 

} 

/** 

* Returns true if the stack is empty. Returns false 

* if there are one or more items on the stack. 
*/ 

public boolean isEmptyO { 
return (top == null) ; 

} 

} // end class StackOflnts 

You should make sure that you understand how the push and pop operations operate on the 
linked list. Drawing some pictures might help. Note that the linked list is part of the private 
implementation of the StackOflnts class. A program that uses this class doesn't even need to 
know that a linked list is being used. 

Now, it's pretty easy to implement a stack as an array instead of as a linked list. Since the 
number of items on the stack varies with time, a counter is needed to keep track of how many 
spaces in the array are actually in use. If this counter is called top, then the items on the stack 
are stored in positions 0, 1, . . . , top-1 in the array. The item in position is on the bottom 
of the stack, and the item in position top-1 is on the top of the stack. Pushing an item onto 
the stack is easy: Put the item in position top and add 1 to the value of top. If we don't want 
to put a limit on the number of items that the stack can hold, we can use the dynamic array 
techniques from Subsection 7.3.2. Note that the typical picture of the array would show the 
stack "upside down," with the bottom of the stack at the top of the array. This doesn't matter. 
The array is just an implementation of the abstract idea of a stack, and as long as the stack 
operations work the way they are supposed to, we are OK. Here is a second implementation of 
the StackOflnts class, using a dynamic array: 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



440 



public class StackOflnts { // (alternate version, using an array) 

private int [] items = new int [10] ; // Holds the items on the stack, 
private int top =0; // The number of items currently on the stack. 
/** 

* Add N to the top of the stack. 
*/ 

public void push( int N ) { 

if (top == items . length) { 

// The array is full, so make a new, larger array and 
// copy the current stack items into it. 
int [] newArray = new int [ 2*items . length ]; 
System. arraycopy( items , 0, newArray, 0, items . length) ; 
items = newArray; 

} 

items [top] = N; // Put N in next available spot. 
top++; // Number of items goes up by one. 

} 

/** 

* Remove the top item from the stack, and return it. 

* Throws an IllegalStateException if the stack is empty when 

* this method is called. 
*/ 

public int pop() { 
if ( top == ) 

throw new IllegalStateException( "Can't pop from an empty stack."); 
int topltem = items [top -1]; // Top item in the stack, 
top — ; // Number of items on the stack goes down by one. 
return topltem; 

> 

/** 

* Returns true if the stack is empty. Returns false 

* if there are one or more items on the stack. 
*/ 

public boolean isEmptyO { 
return (top == 0) ; 

> 

} // end class StackOflnts 

Once again, the implementation of the stack (as an array) is private to the class. The two 
versions of the StackOflnts class can be used interchangeably, since their public interfaces are 
identical. 

* * * 

It's interesting to look at the run time analysis of stack operations. (See Section 8.5). We 
can measure the size of the problem by the number of items that are on the stack. For the 
linked list implementation of a stack, the worst case run time both for the push and for the pop 
operation is 6(1). This just means that the run time is less than some constant, independent 
of the number of items on the stack. This is easy to see if you look at the code. The operations 
are implemented with a few simple assignment statements, and the number of items on the 
stack has no effect. 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



441 



For the array implementation, on the other hand, a special case occurs in the push operation 
when the array is full. In that case, a new array is created and all the stack items are copied 
into the new array. This takes an amount of time that is proportional to the number of items 
on the stack. So, although the run time for push is usually 6(1), the worst case run time is 
G(n), where n is the number of items on the stack. (However, the worst case occurs only rarely, 
and there is a natural sense in which the average case run time for the array implementation is 
still 6(1).) 

9.3.2 Queues 

Queues are similar to stacks in that a queue consists of a sequence of items, and there are 
restrictions about how items can be added to and removed from the list. However, a queue 
has two ends, called the front and the back of the queue. Items are always added to the queue 
at the back and removed from the queue at the front. The operations of adding and removing 
items are called enqueue and dequeue. An item that is added to the back of the queue will 
remain on the queue until all the items in front of it have been removed. This should sound 
familiar. A queue is like a "line" or "queue" of customers waiting for service. Customers are 
serviced in the order in which they arrive on the queue. 



In a queue, all operations take place at one end of the queue 
or the other. The "enqueue" operation adds an item to the 
"back" of the queue. The "dequeue" operation removes the 
item at the "front" of the queue and returns it.

A queue can hold items of any type. For a queue of ints, the enqueue and dequeue operations 
can be implemented as instance methods in a "QueueOflnts" class. We also need an instance 
method for checking whether the queue is empty: 

• void enqueue (int N) — Add N to the back of the queue. 

• int dequeue () — Remove the item at the front and return it. 

• boolean isEmptyO — Return true if the queue is empty. 

A queue can be implemented as a linked list or as an array. An efficient array implementation 
is a little trickier than the array implementation of a stack, so I won't give it here. In the linked 
list implementation, the first item of the list is at the front of the queue. Dequeueing an item 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



442 



from the front of the queue is just like popping an item off a stack. The back of the queue is 
at the end of the list. Enqueueing an item involves setting a pointer in the last node of the 
current list to point to a new node that contains the item. To do this, we'll need a command 
like "tail. next = newNode;", where tail is a pointer to the last node in the list. If head is 
a pointer to the first node of the list, it would always be possible to get a pointer to the last 
node of the list by saying: 

Node tail; // This will point to the last node in the list, 
tail = head; // Start at the first node, 
while (tail. next != null) { 

tail = tail. next; // Move to next node. 

} 

// At this point, tail. next is null, so tail points to 
// the last node in the list. 

However, it would be very inefficient to do this over and over every time an item is enqueued. 
For the sake of efficiency, we'll keep a pointer to the last node in an instance variable. This 
complicates the class somewhat; we have to be careful to update the value of this variable 
whenever a new node is added to the end of the list. Given all this, writing the QueueOflnts 
class is not all that difficult: 

public class QueueOflnts { 

/** 

* An object of type Node holds one of the items 

* in the linked list that represents the queue. 
*/ 

private static class Node { 
int item; 
Node next ; 

} 

private Node head = null; // Points to first Node in the queue. 

// The queue is empty when head is null. 

private Node tail = null; // Points to last Node in the queue. 

/** 

* Add N to the back of the queue. 
*/ 

public void enqueue ( int N ) { 

Node newTail = new NodeO; // A Node to hold the new item. 
newTail.item = N; 
if (head == null) { 

// The queue was empty. The new Node becomes 
// the only node in the list. Since it is both 
// the first and last node, both head and tail 
// point to it. 
head = newTail ; 
tail = newTail; 

} 

else { 

// The new node becomes the new tail of the list. 
// (The head of the list is unaffected.) 
tail. next = newTail; 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 443 
tail = newTail; 

} 

} 

/** 

* Remove and return the front item in the queue. 

* Throws an IllegalStateException if the queue is empty. 
*/ 

public int dequeue () { 
if ( head == null) 

throw new IllegalStateException( "Can't dequeue from an empty queue."); 
int firstltem = head. item; 

head = head. next; // The previous second item is now first. 

if (head == null) { 

// The queue has become empty. The Node that was 
// deleted was the tail as well as the head of the 
// list, so now there is no tail. (Actually, the 
// class would work fine without this step.) 
tail = null; 

} 

return firstltem; 

} 

/** 

* Return true if the queue is empty. 
*/ 

boolean isEmptyO { 

return (head == null) ; 

} 

} // end class QueueOflnts 

Queues are typically used in a computer (as in real life) when only one item can be processed 
at a time, but several items can be waiting for processing. For example: 

• In a Java program that has multiple threads, the threads that want processing time on 
the CPU are kept in a queue. When a new thread is started, it is added to the back of the 
queue. A thread is removed from the front of the queue, given some processing time, and 
then — if it has not terminated — is sent to the back of the queue to wait for another turn. 

• Events such as keystrokes and mouse clicks are stored in a queue called the "event queue" . 
A program removes events from the event queue and processes them. It's possible for 
several more events to occur while one event is being processed, but since the events are 
stored in a queue, they will always be processed in the order in which they occurred. 

• A web server is a program that receives requests from web browsers for "pages." It is easy 
for new requests to arrive while the web server is still fulfilling a previous request. Requests 
that arrive while the web server is busy are placed into a queue to await processing. Using 
a queue ensures that requests will be processed in the order in which they were received. 

Queues are said to implement a FIFO policy: First In, First Out. Or, as it is more 
commonly expressed, first come, first served. Stacks, on the other hand implement a LIFO 
policy: Last In, First Out. The item that comes out of the stack is the last one that was put 
in. Just like queues, stacks can be used to hold items that are waiting for processing (although 
in applications where queues are typically used, a stack would be considered "unfair"). 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



444 



* * * 

To get a better handle on the difference between stacks and queues, consider the sample 
program DepthBreadth.java. I suggest that you run the program or try the applet version 
that can be found in the on-line version of this section. The program shows a grid of squares. 
Initially, all the squares are white. When you click on a white square, the program will gradually 
mark all the squares in the grid, starting from the one where you click. To understand how the 
program does this, think of yourself in the place of the program. When the user clicks a square, 
you are handed an index card. The location of the square — its row and column — is written on 
the card. You put the card in a pile, which then contains just that one card. Then, you repeat 
the following: If the pile is empty, you are done. Otherwise, remove an index card from the 
pile. The index card specifies a square. Look at each horizontal and vertical neighbor of that 
square. If the neighbor has not already been encountered, write its location on a new index 
card and put the card in the pile. 

While a square is in the pile, waiting to be processed, it is colored red; that is, red squares 
have been encountered but not yet processed. When a square is taken from the pile and pro- 
cessed, its color changes to gray. Once a square has been colored gray, its color won't change 
again. Eventually, all the squares have been processed, and the procedure ends. In the index 
card analogy, the pile of cards has been emptied. 

The program can use your choice of three methods: Stack, Queue, and Random. In each 
case, the same general procedure is used. The only difference is how the "pile of index cards" is 
managed. For a stack, cards are added and removed at the top of the pile. For a queue, cards 
are added to the bottom of the pile and removed from the top. In the random case, the card to 
be processed is picked at random from among all the cards in the pile. The order of processing 
is very different in these three cases. 

You should experiment with the program to see how it all works. Try to understand how 
stacks and queues are being used. Try starting from one of the corner squares. While the process 
is going on, you can click on other white squares, and they will be added to the pile. When you 
do this with a stack, you should notice that the square you click is processed immediately, and 
all the red squares that were already waiting for processing have to wait. On the other hand, if 
you do this with a queue, the square that you click will wait its turn until all the squares that 
were already in the pile have been processed. 

* * * 

Queues seem very natural because they occur so often in real life, but there are times when 
stacks are appropriate and even essential. For example, consider what happens when a routine 
calls a subroutine. The first routine is suspended while the subroutine is executed, and it will 
continue only when the subroutine returns. Now, suppose that the subroutine calls a second 
subroutine, and the second subroutine calls a third, and so on. Each subroutine is suspended 
while the subsequent subroutines are executed. The computer has to keep track of all the 
subroutines that are suspended. It does this with a stack. 

When a subroutine is called, an activation record is created for that subroutine. The 
activation record contains information relevant to the execution of the subroutine, such as its 
local variables and parameters. The activation record for the subroutine is placed on a stack. 
It will be removed from the stack and destroyed when the subroutine returns. If the subroutine 
calls another subroutine, the activation record of the second subroutine is pushed onto the 
stack, on top of the activation record of the first subroutine. The stack can continue to grow 
as more subroutines are called, and it shrinks as those subroutines return. 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



445 



9.3.3 Postfix Expressions 

As another example, stacks can be used to evaluate postfix expressions. An ordinary mathe- 
matical expression such as 2+(15-12)*17 is called an infix expression. In an infix expression, 
an operator comes in between its two operands, as in "2 + 2" . In a postfix expression, an oper- 
ator comes after its two operands, as in "2 2 +". The infix expression "2+(15-12)*17" would 
be written in postfix form as "2 15 12 - 17 * +". The "-" operator in this expression applies 
to the two operands that precede it, namely "15" and "12". The "*" operator applies to the 
two operands that precede it, namely "15 12 -" and "17". And the "+" operator applies to 
"2" and "15 12 - 17 *". These are the same computations that are done in the original infix 
expression. 

Now, suppose that we want to process the expression "2 15 12 - 17 * +", from left to 
right and find its value. The first item we encounter is the 2, but what can we do with it? 
At this point, we don't know what operator, if any, will be applied to the 2 or what the other 
operand might be. We have to remember the 2 for later processing. We do this by pushing 
it onto a stack. Moving on to the next item, we see a 15, which is pushed onto the stack on 
top of the 2. Then the 12 is added to the stack. Now, we come to the operator, This 
operation applies to the two operands that preceded it in the expression. We have saved those 
two operands on the stack. So, to process the "-" operator, we pop two numbers from the 
stack, 12 and 15, and compute 15 - 12 to get the answer 3. This 3 must be remembered to be 
used in later processing, so we push it onto the stack, on top of the 2 that is still waiting there. 
The next item in the expression is a 17, which is processed by pushing it onto the stack, on top 
of the 3. To process the next item, we pop two numbers from the stack. The numbers are 
17 and the 3 that represents the value of "15 12 -". These numbers are multiplied, and the 
result, 51 is pushed onto the stack. The next item in the expression is a "+" operator, which is 
processed by popping 51 and 2 from the stack, adding them, and pushing the result, 53, onto 
the stack. Finally, we've come to the end of the expression. The number on the stack is the 
value of the entire expression, so all we have to do is pop the answer from the stack, and we 
are done! The value of the expression is 53. 

Although it's easier for people to work with infix expressions, postfix expressions have some 
advantages. For one thing, postfix expressions don't require parentheses or precedence rules. 
The order in which operators are applied is determined entirely by the order in which they 
occur in the expression. This allows the algorithm for evaluating postfix expressions to be 
fairly straightforward: 

Start with an empty stack 
for each item in the expression: 
if the item is a number: 

Push the number onto the stack 
else if the item is an operator: 

Pop the operands from the stack // Can generate an error 
Apply the operator to the operands 
Push the result onto the stack 
else 

There is an error in the expression 
Pop a number from the stack // Can generate an error 
if the stack is not empty: 

There is an error in the expression 
else : 

The last number that was popped is the value of the expression 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



446 



Errors in an expression can be detected easily. For example, in the expression "2 3 + *" , 
there are not enough operands for the "*" operation. This will be detected in the algorithm 
when an attempt is made to pop the second operand for "*" from the stack, since the stack 
will be empty. The opposite problem occurs in "2 3 4 +" . There are not enough operators for 
all the numbers. This will be detected when the 2 is left still sitting in the stack at the end of 
the algorithm. 

This algorithm is demonstrated in the sample program PostfixEval.java. This program lets 
you type in postfix expressions made up of non-negative real numbers and the operators "+", 
"/", and The "~" represents exponentiation. That is, "2 3 ~" is evaluated as 
2 3 . The program prints out a message as it processes each item in the expression. The stack 
class that is used in the program is defined in the file StackOfDouble.java. The StackOfDouble 
class is identical to the first StackOflnts class, given above, except that it has been modified to 
store values of type double instead of values of type int. 

The only interesting aspect of this program is the method that implements the postfix 
evaluation algorithm. It is a direct implementation of the pseudocode algorithm given above: 

/** 

* Read one line of input and process it as a postfix expression. 

* If the input is not a legal postfix expression, then an error 

* message is displayed. Otherwise, the value of the expression 

* is displayed. It is assumed that the first character on 

* the input line is a non-blank. 
*/

Postfix expressions are often used internally by computers. In fact, the Java virtual machine 
is a "stack machine" which uses the stack-based approach to expression evaluation that we have 
been discussing. The algorithm can easily be extended to handle variables, as well as constants. 
When a variable is encountered in the expression, the value of the variable is pushed onto the 
stack. It also works for operators with more or fewer than two operands. As many operands as 
are needed are popped from the stack and the result is pushed back onto the stack. For example, 
the unary minus operator, which is used in the expression "-x", has a single operand. We 
will continue to look at expressions and expression evaluation in the next two sections. 

9.4 Binary Trees 

We have seen in the two previous sections how objects can be linked into lists. When an (online) 
object contains two pointers to objects of the same type, structures can be created that are 
much more complicated than linked lists. In this section, we'll look at one of the most basic and 
useful structures of this type: binary trees. Each of the objects in a binary tree contains two 
pointers, typically called left and right. In addition to these pointers, of course, the nodes 
can contain other types of data. For example, a binary tree of integers could be made up of 
objects of the following type: 

class TreeNode { 

int item; // The data in this node. 

TreeNode left; // Pointer to the left subtree. 
TreeNode right; // Pointer to the right subtree. 

} 

The left and right pointers in a TreeNode can be null or can point to other objects of 
type TreeNode. A node that points to another node is said to be the parent of that node, and 
the node it points to is called a child. In the picture below, for example, node 3 is the parent 
of node 6, and nodes 4 and 5 are children of node 2. Not every linked structure made up of 
tree nodes is a binary tree. A binary tree must have the following properties: There is exactly 
one node in the tree which has no parent. This node is called the root of the tree. Every other 
node in the tree has exactly one parent. Finally, there can be no loops in a binary tree. That 
is, it is not possible to follow a chain of pointers starting at some node and arriving back at the 
same node.

A node that has no children is called a leaf. A leaf node can be recognized by the fact that 
both the left and right pointers in the node are null. In the standard picture of a binary tree, 
the root node is shown at the top and the leaf nodes at the bottom — which doesn't show much 
respect for the analogy to real trees. But at least you can see the branching, tree-like structure 
that gives a binary tree its name. 



9.4.1 Tree Traversal 

Consider any node in a binary tree. Look at that node together with all its descendants (that 
is, its children, the children of its children, and so on). This set of nodes forms a binary tree, 
which is called a subtree of the original tree. For example, in the picture, nodes 2, 4, and 5 
form a subtree. This subtree is called the left subtree of the root. Similarly, nodes 3 and 6 
make up the right subtree of the root. We can consider any non-empty binary tree to be made 
up of a root node, a left subtree, and a right subtree. Either or both of the subtrees can be 
empty. This is a recursive definition, matching the recursive definition of the TreeNode class. 
So it should not be a surprise that recursive subroutines are often used to process trees. 

Consider the problem of counting the nodes in a binary tree. (As an exercise, you might try 
to come up with a non-recursive algorithm to do the counting, but you shouldn't expect to find 
one easily.) The heart of the problem is keeping track of which nodes remain to be counted. 
It's not so easy to do this, and in fact it's not even possible without an auxiliary data structure 
such as a stack or queue. With recursion, however, the algorithm is almost trivial. Either the 
tree is empty or it consists of a root and two subtrees. If the tree is empty, the number of nodes 
is zero. (This is the base case of the recursion.) Otherwise, use recursion to count the nodes in 
each subtree. Add the results from the subtrees together, and add one to count the root. This 
gives the total number of nodes in the tree. Written out in Java: 

/** 

* Count the nodes in the binary tree to which root points, and 

* return the answer. If root is null, the answer is zero. 
*/ 

static int countNodes( TreeNode root ) { 
if ( root == null ) 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



450 



return 0; // The tree is empty. It contains no nodes, 
else { 

int count =1; // Start by counting the root. 

count += countNodes (root . left) ; // Add the number of nodes 

// in the left subtree, 

count += countNodes (root . right) ; // Add the number of nodes 

// in the right subtree, 
return count; // Return the total. 

} 

} // end countNodes () 

Or, consider the problem of printing the items in a binary tree. If the tree is empty, there 
is nothing to do. If the tree is non-empty, then it consists of a root and two subtrees. Print the 
item in the root and use recursion to print the items in the subtrees. Here is a subroutine that 
prints all the items on one line of output: 

/** 

* Print all the items in the tree to which root points. 

* The item in the root is printed first, followed by the 

* items in the left subtree and then the items in the 

* right subtree . 
*/ 

static void preorderPrint ( TreeNode root ) { 

if ( root != null ) { // (Otherwise, there's nothing to print.) 
System. out .print ( root . item + " " ); // Print the root item. 
preorderPrint ( root. left ); // Print items in left subtree. 
preorderPrint ( root. right ); // Print items in right subtree. 

} 

} // end preorderPrint () 

This routine is called "preorderPrint" because it uses a preorder traversal of the tree. 
In a preorder traversal, the root node of the tree is processed first, then the left subtree is 
traversed, then the right subtree. In a postorder traversal, the left subtree is traversed, then 
the right subtree, and then the root node is processed. And in an inorder traversal, the left 
subtree is traversed first, then the root node is processed, then the right subtree is traversed. 
Printing subroutines that use postorder and inorder traversal differ from preorderPrint only 
in the placement of the statement that outputs the root item: 

/** 

* Print all the items in the tree to which root points. 

* The item in the left subtree is printed first, followed 

* by the items in the right subtree and then the item 

* in the root node. 
*/ 

static void postorderPrint ( TreeNode root ) { 

if ( root != null ) { // (Otherwise, there's nothing to print.) 
postorderPrint ( root. left ); // Print items in left subtree. 
postorderPrint ( root. right ); // Print items in right subtree. 
System. out .print ( root. item + " " ); //Print the root item. 

y 

y II end postorderPrint () 
/** 

* Print all the items in the tree to which root points.

* by the item in the root node and then the items 

* in the right subtree.

static void inorderPrint ( TreeNode root ) { 

if ( root != null ) { // (Otherwise, there's nothing to print.) 
inorderPrint ( root. left ); // Print items in left subtree. 
System. out .print ( root. item + " " ); //Print the root item. 
inorderPrint ( root. right ); // Print items in right subtree. 

} 

} // end inorderPrint () 

Each of these subroutines can be applied to the binary tree shown in the illustration at the 
beginning of this section. The order in which the items are printed differs in each case: 

preorderPrint outputs: 12 4 5 3 6 

postorderPrint outputs: 4 5 2 6 3 1 

inorderPrint outputs: 4 2 5 13 6 

In preorderPrint, for example, the item at the root of the tree, 1, is output before anything 
else. But the preorder printing also applies to each of the subtrees of the root. The root item 
of the left subtree, 2, is printed before the other items in that subtree, 4 and 5. As for the right 
subtree of the root, 3 is output before 6. A preorder traversal applies at all levels in the tree. 
The other two traversal orders can be analyzed similarly. 

9.4.2 Binary Sort Trees 

One of the examples in Section 9.2 was a linked list of strings, in which the strings were kept 
in increasing order. While a linked list works well for a small number of strings, it becomes 
inefficient for a large number of items. When inserting an item into the list, searching for that 
item's position requires looking at, on average, half the items in the list. Finding an item in the 
list requires a similar amount of time. If the strings are stored in a sorted array instead of in a 
linked list, then searching becomes more efficient because binary search can be used. However, 
inserting a new item into the array is still inefficient since it means moving, on average, half of 
the items in the array to make a space for the new item. A binary tree can be used to store 
an ordered list of strings, or other items, in a way that makes both searching and insertion 
efficient. A binary tree used in this way is called a binary sort tree. 

A binary sort tree is a binary tree with the following property: For every node in the tree, 
the item in that node is greater than every item in the left subtree of that node, and it is less 
than or equal to all the items in the right subtree of that node. Here for example is a binary 
sort tree containing items of type String. (In this picture, I haven't bothered to draw all the 
pointer variables. Non-null pointers are shown as arrows.)

X j ud y ) 




A Binary Sort Tree ( joe ) 

Binary sort trees have this useful property: An inorder traversal of the tree will process the 
items in increasing order. In fact, this is really just another way of expressing the definition. 
For example, if an inorder traversal is used to print the items in the tree shown above, then the 
items will be in alphabetical order. The definition of an inorder traversal guarantees that all 
the items in the left subtree of "judy" are printed before "judy", and all the items in the right 
subtree of "judy" are printed after "judy". But the binary sort tree property guarantees that 
the items in the left subtree of "judy" are precisely those that precede "judy" in alphabetical 
order, and all the items in the right subtree follow "judy" in alphabetical order. So, we know 
that "judy" is output in its proper alphabetical position. But the same argument applies to 
the subtrees. "Bill" will be output after "alice" and before "fred" and its descendents. "Fred" 
will be output after "dave" and before "jane" and "joe". And so on. 

Suppose that we want to search for a given item in a binary search tree. Compare that item 
to the root item of the tree. If they are equal, we're done. If the item we are looking for is 
less than the root item, then we need to search the left subtree of the root — the right subtree 
can be eliminated because it only contains items that are greater than or equal to the root. 
Similarly, if the item we are looking for is greater than the item in the root, then we only need 
to look in the right subtree. In either case, the same procedure can then be applied to search 
the subtree. Inserting a new item is similar: Start by searching the tree for the position where 
the new item belongs. When that position is found, create a new node and attach it to the tree 
at that position. 

Searching and inserting are efficient operations on a binary search tree, provided that the 
tree is close to being balanced. A binary tree is balanced if for each node, the left subtree of 
that node contains approximately the same number of nodes as the right subtree. In a perfectly 
balanced tree, the two numbers differ by at most one. Not all binary trees are balanced, but if 
the tree is created by inserting items in a random order, there is a high probability that the tree 
is approximately balanced. (If the order of insertion is not random, however, it's quite possible 
for the tree to be very unbalanced.) During a search of any binary sort tree, every comparison 
eliminates one of two subtrees from further consideration. If the tree is balanced, that means 
cutting the number of items still under consideration in half. This is exactly the same as the 
binary search algorithm, and the result is a similarly efficient algorithm. 

In terms of asymptotic analysis (Section 8.5), searching, inserting, and deleting in a binary 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



453 



search tree have average case run time 0(log(n)). The problem size, n, is the number of items 
in the tree, and the average is taken over all the different orders in which the items could have 
been inserted into the tree. As long as the actual insertion order is random, the actual run 
time can be expected to be close to the average. However, the worst case run time for binary 
search tree operations is 0(n), which is much worse than 0(log(n)). The worst case occurs 
for particular insertion orders. For example, if the items are inserted into the tree in order of 
increasing size, then every item that is inserted moves always to the right as it moves down 
the tree. The result is a "tree" that looks more like a linked list, since it consists of a linear 
string of nodes strung together by their right child pointers. Operations on such a tree have 
the same performance as operations on a linked list. Now, there are data structures that are 
similar to simple binary sort trees, except that insertion and deletion of nodes are implemented 
in a way that will always keep the tree balanced, or almost balanced. For these data structures, 
searching, inserting, and deleting have both average case and worst case run times that are 
0(log(n)). Here, however, we will look at only the simple versions of inserting and searching. 

The sample program SortTreeDemo.java is a demonstration of binary sort trees. The pro- 
gram includes subroutines that implement inorder traversal, searching, and insertion. We'll 
look at the latter two subroutines below. The main() routine tests the subroutines by letting 
you type in strings to be inserted into the tree. 

In this program, nodes in the binary tree are represented using the following static nested 
class, including a simple constructor that makes creating nodes easier: 

/** 

* An object of type TreeNode represents one node in a binary tree of strings. 
*/ 

private static class TreeNode { 

String item; // The data in this node. 

TreeNode left; // Pointer to left subtree. 
TreeNode right; // Pointer to right subtree. 
TreeNode (String str) { 

// Constructor. Make a node containing str. 
item = str; 

> 

} // end class TreeNode 

A static member variable of type TreeNode points to the binary sort tree that is used by the 
program: 

private static TreeNode root; // Pointer to the root node in the tree. 

// When the tree is empty, root is null. 

A recursive subroutine named treeContains is used to search for a given item in the tree. This 
routine implements the search algorithm for binary trees that was outlined above: 

/** 

* Return true if item is one of the items in the binary 

* sort tree to which root points. Return false if not. 
*/ 

static boolean treeContains ( TreeNode root, String item ) { 
if ( root == null ) { 

// Tree is empty, so it certainly doesn't contain item, 
return false; 

} 

else if ( item. equals (root . item) ) { 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



454 



// Yes, the item has been found in the root node, 
return true; 

} 

else if ( item. compareTo (root . item) < ) { 

//If the item occurs, it must be in the left subtree, 
return treeContains ( root. left, item ); 

} 

else { 

//If the item occurs, it must be in the right subtree, 
return treeContains ( root. right, item ); 

} 

} // end treeContains () 

When this routine is called in the main() routine, the first parameter is the static member 
variable root, which points to the root of the entire binary sort tree. 

It's worth noting that recursion is not really essential in this case. A simple, non-recursive 
algorithm for searching a binary sort tree follows the rule: Start at the root and move down 
the tree until you find the item or reach a null pointer. Since the search follows a single path 
down the tree, it can be implemented as a while loop. Here is a non-recursive version of the 
search routine: 

private static boolean treeContainsNR( TreeNode root, String item ) { 
TreeNode runner; // For "running" down the tree, 
runner = root ; // Start at the root node . 
while (true) { 

if (runner == null) { 

// We've fallen off the tree without finding item, 
return false; 

} 

else if ( item. equals (node . item) ) { 
// We've found the item, 
return true ; 

> 

else if ( item. compareTo (node . item) < ) { 

//If the item occurs, it must be in the left subtree, 
// So, advance the runner down one level to the left, 
runner = runner . left ; 

} 

else { 

// If the item occurs, it must be in the right subtree. 
// So , advance the runner down one level to the right . 
runner = runner .right ; 

} 

} // end while 
} // end treeContainsNRO ; 

The subroutine for inserting a new item into the tree turns out to be more similar to the 
non-recursive search routine than to the recursive. The insertion routine has to handle the case 
where the tree is empty. In that case, the value of root must be changed to point to a node 
that contains the new item: 

root = new TreeNode ( newltem ); 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



455 



But this means, effectively, that the root can't be passed as a parameter to the subroutine, 
because it is impossible for a subroutine to change the value stored in an actual parameter. 
(I should note that this is something that is possible in other languages.) Recursion uses 
parameters in an essential way. There are ways to work around the problem, but the easiest 
thing is just to use a non- recursive insertion routine that accesses the static member variable 
root directly. One difference between inserting an item and searching for an item is that we 
have to be careful not to fall off the tree. That is, we have to stop searching just before runner 
becomes null. When we get to an empty spot in the tree, that's where we have to insert the 
new node: 

/** 

* Add the item to the binary sort tree to which the global variable 

* "root" refers. (Note that root can't be passed as a parameter to 

* this routine because the value of root might change, and a change 

* in the value of a formal parameter does not change the actual parameter.) 
*/ 

private static void treelnsert (String newltem) { 
if ( root == null ) { 

// The tree is empty. Set root to point to a new node containing 
// the new item. This becomes the only node in the tree, 
root = new TreeNode( newltem ); 
return; 

} 

TreeNode runner; // Runs down the tree to find a place for newltem. 
runner = root; // Start at the root, 
while (true) { 

if ( newltem. compareTo (runner . item) < ) { 

// Since the new item is less than the item in runner, 
// it belongs in the left subtree of runner. If there 
// is an open space at runner. left, add a new node there. 
// Otherwise, advance runner down one level to the left, 
if ( runner. left == null ) { 

runner. left = new TreeNode ( newltem ); 

return; // New item has been added to the tree. 

} 

else 

runner = runner. left; 

} 

else { 

// Since the new item is greater than or equal to the item in 
// runner, it belongs in the right subtree of runner. If there 
// is an open space at runner . right , add a new node there. 
// Otherwise, advance runner down one level to the right, 
if ( runner . right == null ) { 

runner. right = new TreeNode ( newltem ); 

return; // New item has been added to the tree. 

} 

else 

runner = runner . right ; 

} 

} // end while 
} // end treelnsert ()

9.4.3 Expression Trees 

Another application of trees is to store mathematical expressions such as 15*(x+y) or 
sqrt(42)+7 in a convenient form. Let's stick for the moment to expressions made up of num- 
bers and the operators +, -, *, and /. Consider the expression 3*((7+l)/4)+(17-5). This 
expression is made up of two subexpressions, 3*((7+l)/4) and (17-5), combined with the 
operator "+". When the expression is represented as a binary tree, the root node holds the 
operator +, while the subtrees of the root node represent the subexpressions 3*((7+l)/4) and 
(17-5). Every node in the tree holds either a number or an operator. A node that holds a 
number is a leaf node of the tree. A node that holds an operator has two subtrees representing 
the operands to which the operator applies. The tree is shown in the illustration below. I will 
refer to a tree of this type as an expression tree . 

Given an expression tree, it's easy to find the value of the expression that it represents. Each 
node in the tree has an associated value. If the node is a leaf node, then its value is simply the 
number that the node contains. If the node contains an operator, then the associated value is 
computed by first finding the values of its child nodes and then applying the operator to those 
values. The process is shown by the upward-directed arrows in the illustration. The value 
computed for the root node is the value of the expression as a whole. There are other uses for 
expression trees. For example, a postorder traversal of the tree will output the postfix form of 
the expression. 




An expression tree contains two types of nodes: nodes that contain numbers and nodes that 
contain operators. Furthermore, we might want to add other types of nodes to make the trees 
more useful, such as nodes that contain variables. If we want to work with expression trees in 
Java, how can we deal with this variety of nodes? One way — which will be frowned upon by 
object-oriented purists — is to include an instance variable in each node object to record which 
type of node it is: 

emim NodeType { NUMBER , OPERATOR > // Possible kinds of node. 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



457 



class ExpNode { // A node in an expression tree. 

NodeType kind; // Which type of node is this? 

double number; // The value in a node of type NUMBER. 

char op; // The operator in a node of type OPERATOR. 

ExpNode left; // Pointers to subtrees, 

ExpNode right; // in a node of type OPERATOR. 

ExpNode ( double val ) { 

// Constructor for making a node of type NUMBER, 
kind = NodeType. NUMBER; 
number = val ; 

> 

ExpNode ( char op , ExpNode left , ExpNode right ) { 

// Constructor for making a node of type OPERATOR, 
kind = NodeType. OPERATOR; 
this. op = op; 
this. left = left; 
this. right = right; 

> 

} // end class ExpNode 
Given this definition, the following recursive subroutine will find the value of an expression tree: 

static double getValue( ExpNode node ) { 

// Return the value of the expression represented by 
// the tree to which node refers. Node must be non-null, 
if ( node. kind == NodeType . NUMBER ) { 

// The value of a NUMBER node is the number it holds, 
return node. number; 

> 

else { // The kind must be OPERATOR. 

// Get the values of the operands and combine them 

// using the operator, 
double leftVal = getValue( node. left ); 
double right Val = getValue( node. right ); 
switch ( node . op ) { 



case 


' + ' : 


return 


leftVal + right Val; 


case 


J J . 


return 


leftVal - right Val; 


case 


' * 9 : 


return 


leftVal * right Val; 


case 


'/': 


return 


leftVal / right Val; 


default : 


return 


Double. NaN; // Bad operator 



} 

> 

} // end getValueO 

Although this approach works, a more object-oriented approach is to note that since there 
are two types of nodes, there should be two classes to represent them, ConstNode and BinOpN- 
ode. To represent the general idea of a node in an expression tree, we need another class, 
ExpNode. Both ConstNode and BinOpNode will be subclasses of ExpNode. Since any actual 
node will be either a ConstNode or a BinOpNode, ExpNode should be an abstract class. (See 
Subsection 5.5.5.) Since one of the things we want to do with nodes is find their values, each 
class should have an instance method for finding the value: 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



458 



abstract class ExpNode { 

// Represents a node of any type in an expression tree. 

abstract double value (); // Return the value of this node. 

} // end class ExpNode 

class ConstNode extends ExpNode { 

// Represents a node that holds a number. 

double number; // The number in the node. 

ConstNode ( double val ) { 

// Constructor. Create a node to hold val. 
number = val ; 

} 

double value () { 

// The value is just the number that the node holds, 
return number ; 

} 

} // end class ConstNode 

class BinOpNode extends ExpNode { 

// Represents a node that holds an operator. 

char op; // The operator. 

ExpNode left; // The left operand. 
ExpNode right; // The right operand. 

BinOpNode ( char op, ExpNode left, ExpNode right ) { 

// Constructor. Create a node to hold the given data, 
this. op = op; 
this. left = left; 
this. right = right; 

> 

double value () { 

//To get the value, compute the value of the left and 
// right operands, and combine them with the operator. 

double leftVal = left .valueO ; 

double rightVal = right . value () ; 

switch ( op ) { 



case '+' : 


return 


leftVal + rightVal; 


case ' - ' : 


return 


leftVal - rightVal; 


case '*' : 


return 


leftVal * rightVal; 


case ' /' : 


return 


leftVal / rightVal; 


default : 


return 


Double. NaN; // Bad operator 



} 

} 

} // end class BinOpNode 

Note that the left and right operands of a BinOpNode are of type ExpNode, not BinOpNode. 
This allows the operand to be either a ConstNode or another BinOpNode — or any other type of 
ExpNode that we might eventually create. Since every ExpNode has a value () method, we can 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



459 



call left. value () to compute the value of the left operand. If left is in fact a ConstNode, 
this will call the value () method in the ConstNode class. If it is in fact a BinOpNode, then 
left.valueO will call the valueQ method in the BinOpNode class. Each node knows how to 
compute its own value. 

Although it might seem more complicated at first, the object-oriented approach has some 
advantages. For one thing, it doesn't waste memory. In the original ExpNode class, only some 
of the instance variables in each node were actually used, and we needed an extra instance 
variable to keep track of the type of node. More important, though, is the fact that new types 
of nodes can be added more cleanly, since it can be done by creating a new subclass of ExpNode 
rather than by modifying an existing class. 

We'll return to the topic of expression trees in the next section, where we'll see how to 
create an expression tree to represent a given expression. 

9.5 A Simple Recursive Descent Parser 

I HAVE ALWAYS been fascinated by language — both natural languages like English and the (online) 
artificial languages that are used by computers. There are many difficult questions about how 
languages can convey information, how they are structured, and how they can be processed. 
Natural and artificial languages are similar enough that the study of programming languages, 
which are pretty well understood, can give some insight into the much more complex and difficult 
natural languages. And programming languages raise more than enough interesting issues to 
make them worth studying in their own right. How can it be, after all, that computers can be 
made to "understand" even the relatively simple languages that are used to write programs? 
Computers can only directly use instructions expressed in very simple machine language. Higher 
level languages must be translated into machine language. But the translation is done by a 
compiler, which is just a program. How could such a translation program be written? 

9.5.1 Backus-Naur Form 

Natural and artificial languages are similar in that they have a structure known as grammar 
or syntax. Syntax can be expressed by a set of rules that describe what it means to be a legal 
sentence or program. For programming languages, syntax rules are often expressed in BNF 
(Backus-Naur Form), a system that was developed by computer scientists John Backus and 
Peter Naur in the late 1950s. Interestingly, an equivalent system was developed independently 
at about the same time by linguist Noam Chomsky to describe the grammar of natural language. 
BNF cannot express all possible syntax rules. For example, it can't express the fact that a 
variable must be defined before it is used. Furthermore, it says nothing about the meaning or 
semantics of the language. The problem of specifying the semantics of a language — even of an 
artificial programming language — is one that is still far from being completely solved. However, 
BNF does express the basic structure of the language, and it plays a central role in the design 
of translation programs. 

In English, terms such as "noun", "transitive verb," and "prepositional phrase" are syntac- 
tic categories that describe building blocks of sentences. Similarly, "statement", "number," 
and "while loop" are syntactic categories that describe building blocks of Java programs. In 
BNF, a syntactic category is written as a word enclosed between "<" and ">". For example: 
<noun>, <verb-phrase>, or <while-loop>. A rule in BNF specifies the structure of an item 
in a given syntactic category, in terms of other syntactic categories and/or basic symbols of the 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



460 



language. For example, one BNF rule for the English language might be 
<sentence> ::= <noun-phrase> <verb-phrase> 

The symbol " : : =" is read "can be" , so this rule says that a <sentence> can be a <noun-phrase> 
followed by a <verb-phrase>. (The term is "can be" rather than "is" because there might be 
other rules that specify other possible forms for a sentence.) This rule can be thought of as a 
recipe for a sentence: If you want to make a sentence, make a noun-phrase and follow it by a 
verb-phrase. Noun-phrase and verb-phrase must, in turn, be defined by other BNF rules. 

In BNF, a choice between alternatives is represented by the symbol "I", which is read "or". 
For example, the rule 

<verb-phrase> ::= <intransitive-verb> I 

( <transitive-verb> <noun-phrase> ) 

says that a <verb-phrase> can be an <intransitive-verb>, or a <transitive-verb> followed 
by a <noun-phrase>. Note also that parentheses can be used for grouping. To express the fact 
that an item is optional, it can be enclosed between " [" and "] " . An optional item that can 
be repeated any number of times is enclosed between " [" and "]...". And a symbol that is 
an actual part of the language that is being described is enclosed in quotes. For example, 

<noun-phrase> ::= <common-noun> [ "that" <verb-phrase> ] I 

<common-noun> [ <prepositional-phrase> ] . . . 

says that a <noun-phrase> can be a <common-noun>, optionally followed by the literal word 
"that" and a <verb-phrase>, or it can be a <common-noun> followed by zero or more 
<prepositional-phrase> ' s. Obviously, we can describe very complex structures in this way. 
The real power comes from the fact that BNF rules can be recursive. In fact, the two pre- 
ceding rules, taken together, are recursive. A <noun-phrase> is defined partly in terms of 
<verb-phrase>, while <verb-phrase> is defined partly in terms of <noun-phrase>. For ex- 
ample, a <noun-phrase> might be "the rat that ate the cheese", since "ate the cheese" is a 
<verb-phrase>. But then we can, recursively, make the more complex <noun-phrase> "the cat 
that caught the rat that ate the cheese" out of the <common-noun> "the cat", the word "that" 
and the <verb-phrase> "caught the rat that ate the cheese" . Building from there, we can make 
the <noun-phrase> "the dog that chased the cat that caught the rat that ate the cheese". The 
recursive structure of language is one of the most fundamental properties of language, and the 
ability of BNF to express this recursive structure is what makes it so useful. 

BNF can be used to describe the syntax of a programming language such as Java in a formal 
and precise way. For example, a <while-loop> can be defined as 

<while-loop> ::= "while" "(" <condition> ")" <statement> 

This says that a <while-loop> consists of the word "while", followed by a left parenthesis, 
followed by a <condition>, followed by a right parenthesis, followed by a <statement>. Of 
course, it still remains to define what is meant by a condition and by a statement. Since a 
statement can be, among other things, a while loop, we can already see the recursive structure 
of the Java language. The exact specification of an if statement, which is hard to express 
clearly in words, can be given as 

<if-statement> ::= 

"if" "(" <condition> ")" <statement> 

[ "else" "if" "(" <condition> ")" <statement> ]... 

[ "else" <statement> ] 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



461 



This rule makes it clear that the "else" part is optional and that there can be, optionally, one 
or more "else if" parts. 

9.5.2 Recursive Descent Parsing 

In the rest of this section, I will show how a BNF grammar for a language can be used as a guide 
for constructing a parser. A parser is a program that determines the grammatical structure of a 
phrase in the language. This is the first step in determining the meaning of the phrase — which 
for a programming language means translating it into machine language. Although we will look 
at only a simple example, I hope it will be enough to convince you that compilers can in fact 
be written and understood by mortals and to give you some idea of how that can be done. 

The parsing method that we will use is called recursive descent parsing. It is not the 
only possible parsing method, or the most efficient, but it is the one most suited for writing 
compilers by hand (rather than with the help of so called "parser generator" programs). In a 
recursive descent parser, every rule of the BNF grammar is the model for a subroutine. Not 
every BNF grammar is suitable for recursive descent parsing. The grammar must satisfy a 
certain property. Essentially, while parsing a phrase, it must be possible to tell what syntactic 
category is coming up next just by looking at the next item in the input. Many grammars are 
designed with this property in mind. 

I should also mention that many variations of BNF are in use. The one that I've described 
here is one that is well-suited for recursive descent parsing. 

* * * 

When we try to parse a phrase that contains a syntax error, we need some way to respond 
to the error. A convenient way of doing this is to throw an exception. I'll use an exception 
class called ParseError, defined as follows: 

/** 

* An object of type ParseError represents a syntax error found in 

* the user ' s input . 
*/ 

private static class ParseError extends Exception { 
ParseError (String message) { 
super (message) ; 

} 

} // end nested class ParseError 

Another general point is that our BNF rules don't say anything about spaces between items, 
but in reality we want to be able to insert spaces between items at will. To allow for this, I'll 
always call the routine Text 10 . skipBlanks () before trying to look ahead to see what's coming 
up next in input. TextIO . skipBlanks () skips past any whitespace, such as spaces and tabs, 
in the input, and stops when the next character in the input is either a non-blank character or 
the end-of-line character. 

Let's start with a very simple example. A "fully parenthesized expression" can be specified 
in BNF by the rules 

<expression> ::= <number> I 

"(" <expression> <operator> <expression> ")" 

<operator> ::= "+" I "-" I "*" I "/" 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



462 



where <number> refers to any non-negative real number. An example of a fully parenthesized 
expression is "(( (34-17) *8) + (2*7))". Since every operator corresponds to a pair of parenthe- 
ses, there is no ambiguity about the order in which the operators are to be applied. Suppose 
we want a program that will read and evaluate such expressions. We'll read the expressions 
from standard input, using Text 10. To apply recursive descent parsing, we need a subroutine 
for each rule in the grammar. Corresponding to the rule for <operator>, we get a subroutine 
that reads an operator. The operator can be a choice of any of four things. Any other input 
will be an error. 

/** 

* If the next character in input is one of the legal operators, 

* read it and return it. Otherwise, throw a ParseError. 
*/ 

static char getOperator () throws ParseError { 
TextIO . skipBlanks () ; 

char op = TextIO .peekO ; // look ahead at the next char, without reading it 
if ( op == '+' II op == '-' II op == '*' II op == '/' ) { 

TextlO.getAnyCharQ ; // read the operator, to remove it from the input 

return op; 

} 

else if (op == '\n') 

throw new ParseError ("Missing operator at end of line."); 
else 

throw new ParseError ("Missing operator. Found \"" + 
op + "\" instead of +, -, *, or /."); 
} // end getOperator () 

I've tried to give a reasonable error message, depending on whether the next character is an 
end-of-line or something else. I use TextIO .peek () to look ahead at the next character before I 
read it, and I call TextIO . skipBlanks () before testing TextIO .peek() in order to ignore any 
blanks that separate items. I will follow this same pattern in every case. 

When we come to the subroutine for <expression>, things are a little more interesting. The 
rule says that an expression can be either a number or an expression enclosed in parentheses. 
We can tell which it is by looking ahead at the next character. If the character is a digit, 
we have to read a number. If the character is a "(", we have to read the "(", followed by an 
expression, followed by an operator, followed by another expression, followed by a ")". If the 
next character is anything else, there is an error. Note that we need recursion to read the 
nested expressions. The routine doesn't just read the expression. It also computes and returns 
its value. This requires semantical information that is not specified in the BNF rule. 

/** 

* Read an expression from the current line of input and return its value. 

* Othrows ParseError if the input contains a syntax error 
*/ 

private static double expressionValue () throws ParseError -[ 
TextIO . skipBlanks () ; 

if ( Character . isDigit (TextIO .peekO ) ) { 

// The next item in input is a number, so the expression 
// must consist of just that number. Read and return 
/ / the number . 
return TextIO .getDoubleO ; 

} 

else if ( TextIO. peekO =='('){

case '+' 

case '-' 

case '*' 

case '/' 



II The expression must be of the form 

// "(" <expression> <operator> <expression> ")" 

// Read all these items, perform the operation, and 
// return the result. 
TextlO.getAnyCharO ; // Read the "(" 

double leftVal = expressionValueO ; // Read and evaluate first operand, 
char op = getOperator () ; // Read the operator, 

double rightVal = expressionValueO; // Read and evaluate second operand. 
TextIO . skipBlanks () ; 
if ( TextIO. peekO !=')'){ 

// According to the rule, there must be a ")" here. 
// Since it's missing, throw a ParseError. 
throw new ParseError ("Missing right parenthesis."); 

} 

TextlO.getAnyCharO; // Read the ")" 

switch (op) { // Apply the operator and return the result . 
return leftVal + rightVal; 
return leftVal - rightVal; 
return leftVal * rightVal; 
return leftVal / rightVal; 
default: return 0; // Can't occur since op is one of the above. 

// (But Java syntax requires a return value.) 

} 

} 

else { //No other character can legally start an expression, 
throw new ParseError ("Encountered unexpected character, \"" + 
TextIO. peek () + "\" in input."); 

} 

} // end expressionValueO 

I hope that you can see how this routine corresponds to the BNF rule. Where the rule 
uses " I " to give a choice between alternatives, there is an if statement in the routine to 
determine which choice to take. Where the rule contains a sequence of items, "(" <expression> 
<operator> <expression> ")", there is a sequence of statements in the subroutine to read each 
item in turn. 

When expressionValueO is called to evaluate the expression (( (34-17) *8)+(2*7) ) , it 
sees the "(" at the beginning of the input, so the else part of the if statement is executed. 
The "(" is read. Then the first recursive call to expressionValueO reads and evaluates the 
subexpression ( (34-17) *8), the call to getOperator () reads the "+" operator, and the sec- 
ond recursive call to expressionValueO reads and evaluates the second subexpression (2*7). 
Finally, the ")" at the end of the expression is read. Of course, reading the first subexpression, 
( (34-17) *8) , involves further recursive calls to the expressionValue () routine, but it's better 
not to think too deeply about that! Rely on the recursion to handle the details. 

You'll find a complete program that uses these routines in the file SimpleParserl.java. 

* * * 

Fully parenthesized expressions aren't very natural for people to use. But with ordinary 
expressions, we have to worry about the question of operator precedence, which tells us, for 
example, that the "*" in the expression "5+3*7" is applied before the "+". The complex 
expression "3*6+8* (7+1) /4-24" should be seen as made up of three "terms", 3*6, 8*(7+l)/4, 
and 24, combined with "+" and "-" operators. A term, on the other hand, can be made up 
of several factors combined with "*" and "/" operators. For example, 8*(7+l)/4 contains the 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



464 



factors 8, (7+1) and 4. This example also shows that a factor can be either a number or an 
expression in parentheses. To complicate things a bit more, we allow for leading minus signs in 
expressions, as in "-(3+4)" or "-7". (Since a <number> is a positive number, this is the only 
way we can get negative numbers. It's done this way to avoid "3 * -7", for example.) This 
structure can be expressed by the BNF rules 

<expression> ::= [ "-" ] <term> [ ( "+" I "-" ) <term> ]... 
<term> ::= <factor> [ ( "*" I "/" ) <factor> ]... 
<factor> ::= <number> I "(" <expression> ")" 

The first rule uses the " [ ] . . . " notation, which says that the items that it encloses can 
occur zero, one, two, or more times. This means that an <expression> can begin, optionally, 
with a Then there must be a <term> which can optionally be followed by one of the 

operators "+" or "-" and another <term>, optionally followed by another operator and <term>, 
and so on. In a subroutine that reads and evaluates expressions, this repetition is handled by 
a while loop. An if statement is used at the beginning of the loop to test whether a leading 
minus sign is present: 

/** 

* Read an expression from the current line of input and return its value. 

* Othrows ParseError if the input contains a syntax error 
*/ 

private static double expressionValue () throws ParseError -[ 
TextIO . skipBlanks () ; 

boolean negative; // True if there is a leading minus sign. 

negative = false; 

if (TextIO. peekO == '-') { 

TextlO.getAnyCharO ; // Read the minus sign. 

negative = true; 

} 

double val; // Value of the expression, 
val = termValueO; 
if (negative) 

val = -val ; 
TextIO . skipBlanks () ; 

while ( TextIO. peekO == '+' II TextIO. peek O == '-' ) { 

// Read the next term and add it to or subtract it from 
// the value of previous terms in the expression, 
char op = TextlO.getAnyCharO; // Read the operator, 
double nextVal = termValueO; 
if (op == '+') 

val += next Val ; 
else 

val -= next Val ; 
TextIO . skipBlanks () ; 

> 

return val ; 
} // end expressionValue () 

The subroutine for <term> is very similar to this, and the subroutine for <factor> is 
similar to the example given above for fully parenthesized expressions. A complete program 
that reads and evaluates expressions based on the above BNF rules can be found in the file 
SimplePar ser 2 . j ava.

9.5.3 Building an Expression Tree 

Now, so far, we've only evaluated expressions. What does that have to do with translating 
programs into machine language? Well, instead of actually evaluating the expression, it would 
be almost as easy to generate the machine language instructions that are needed to evaluate 
the expression. If we are working with a "stack machine," these instructions would be stack 
operations such as "push a number" or "apply a + operation". The program SimpleParser3.java 
can both evaluate the expression and print a list of stack machine operations for evaluating the 
expression. 

It's quite a jump from this program to a recursive descent parser that can read a program 
written in Java and generate the equivalent machine language code — but the conceptual leap 
is not huge. 

The SimpleParser3 program doesn't actually generate the stack operations directly as it 
parses an expression. Instead, it builds an expression tree, as discussed in Subsection 9.4.3, 
to represent the expression. The expression tree is then used to find the value and to gen- 
erate the stack operations. The tree is made up of nodes belonging to classes ConstNode 
and BinOpNode that are similar to those given in Subsection 9.4.3. Another class, UnaryMi- 
nusNode, has been introduced to represent the unary minus operation. I've added a method, 
printStackCommands () , to each class. This method is responsible for printing out the stack 
operations that are necessary to evaluate an expression. Here for example is the new BinOpNode 
class from SimpleParser3.java: 

private static class BinOpNode extends ExpNode { 
char op; // The operator. 

ExpNode left; // The expression for its left operand. 
ExpNode right; // The expression for its right operand. 
BinOpNode (char op, ExpNode left, ExpNode right) { 

// Construct a BinOpNode containing the specified data. 

assert op == ' + ' II op == '-' II op == '*' II op == '/'; 

assert left != null && right != null; 

this. op = op; 

this. left = left; 

this. right = right; 

} 

double value () { 

// The value is obtained by evaluating the left and right 
// operands and combining the values with the operator, 
double x = lef t . value () ; 
double y = right .value () ; 
switch (op) { 
case '+' : 

return x + y; 
case ' - ' : 

return x - y; 
case '*' : 

return x * y; 
case ' / ' : 

return x / y; 
default : 

return Double. NaN; // Bad operator! 

} 

> 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



466 



void printStackCommands () { 

//To evaluate the expression on a stack machine, first do 

// whatever is necessary to evaluate the left operand, leaving 

// the answer on the stack. Then do the same thing for the 

// second operand. Then apply the operator (which means popping 

// the operands, applying the operator, and pushing the result). 

left. printStackCommands () ; 

right. printStackCommands () ; 

TextlO.putlnC Operator " + op); 

} 

} 

It's also interesting to look at the new parsing subroutines. Instead of computing a value, 
each subroutine builds an expression tree. For example, the subroutine corresponding to the 
rule for <expression> becomes 

static ExpNode expressionTreeO throws ParseError { 

// Read an expression from the current line of input and 
// return an expression tree representing the expression. 
TextIO . skipBlanks () ; 

boolean negative; // True if there is a leading minus sign. 

negative = false; 

if (TextIO. peekO == '-') { 

Text 10 . get AnyChar ( ) ; 

negative = true; 

} 

ExpNode exp; // The expression tree for the expression, 
exp = termTreeO; // Start with a tree for first term, 
if (negative) { 

// Build the tree that corresponds to applying a 

// unary minus operator to the term we've 

// just read, 
exp = new UnaryMinusNode (exp) ; 

} 

TextIO . skipBlanks () ; 

while ( TextIO. peekO == ' + ' II TextIO .peekO == '-' ) { 
// Read the next term and combine it with the 
// previous terms into a bigger expression tree. 

char op = TextIO .get AnyChar () ; 

ExpNode nextTerm = termTreeO; 

// Create a tree that applies the binary operator 
// to the previous tree and the term we just read. 

exp = new BinOpNode(op, exp, nextTerm); 

TextIO . skipBlanks () ; 

} 

return exp; 
} // end expressionTreeO 



In some real compilers, the parser creates a tree to represent the program that is being 
parsed. This tree is called a parse tree. Parse trees are somewhat different in form from 
expression trees, but the purpose is the same. Once you have the tree, there are a number of 
things you can do with it. For one thing, it can be used to generate machine language code. But 



CHAPTER 9. LINKED DATA STRUCTURES AND RECURSION 



467 



there are also techniques for examining the tree and detecting certain types of programming 
errors, such as an attempt to reference a local variable before it has been assigned a value. (The 
Java compiler, of course, will reject the program if it contains such an error.) It's also possible 
to manipulate the tree to optimize the program. In optimization, the tree is transformed to 
make the program more efficient before the code is generated. 

And so we are back where we started in Chapter 1, looking at programming languages, 
compilers, and machine language. But looking at them, I hope, with a lot more understanding 
and a much wider perspective. 



Exercises

Exercises for Chapter 9 



1. In many textbooks, the first examples of recursion are the mathematical functions factorial (solution) 
and fibonacci. These functions are defined for non-negative integers using the following 
recursive formulas: 

factorial (0) = 1 

factorial (N) = N*f actorial(N-l) for N > 

fibonacci (0) = 1 
fibonacci(l) = 1 

fibonacci (N) = fibonacci (N-l) + fibonacci (N-2) for N > 1 

Write recursive functions to compute factorial (N) and fibonacci (N) for a given non- 
negative integer N, and write a main() routine to test your functions. 

(In fact, factorial and fibonacci are really not very good examples of recursion, since 
the most natural way to compute them is to use simple for loops. Furthermore, fibonacci 
is a particularly bad example, since the natural recursive approach to computing this 
function is extremely inefficient.) 

2. Exercise 7.6 asked you to read a file, make an alphabetical list of all the words that occur (solution) 
in the file, and write the list to another file. In that exercise, you were asked to use an 
Arrayl_ist<String> to store the words. Write a new version of the same program that stores 

the words in a binary sort tree instead of in an arraylist. You can use the binary sort tree 
routines from SortTreeDemo.java, which was discussed in Subsection 9.4.2. 

3. Suppose that linked lists of integers are made from objects belonging to the class (solution) 

class ListNode { 

int item; // An item in the list. 

ListNode next; // Pointer to the next node in the list. 

> 

Write a subroutine that will make a copy of a list, with the order of the items of the list 
reversed. The subroutine should have a parameter of type ListNode, and it should return 
a value of type ListNode. The original list should not be modified. 
You should also write a main() routine to test your subroutine. 

4. Subsection 9.4.1 explains how to use recursion to print out the items in a binary tree in (solution) 
various orders. That section also notes that a non-recursive subroutine can be used to 

print the items, provided that a stack or queue is used as an auxiliary data structure. 
Assuming that a queue is used, here is an algorithm for such a subroutine: 

Add the root node to an empty queue 
while the queue is not empty: 
Get a node from the queue 
Print the item in the node 
if node. left is not null: 

add it to the queue 
if node. right is not null: 
add it to the queue 



Exercises 



469 



Write a subroutine that implements this algorithm, and write a program to test the sub- 
routine. Note that you will need a queue of TreeNodes, so you will need to write a class 
to represent such queues. 

(Note that the order in which items are printed by this algorithm is different from all 
three of the orders considered in Subsection 9.4.1.) 

5. In Subsection 9.4.2, I say that "if the [binary sort] tree is created by inserting items in a (solution) 
random order, there is a high probability that the tree is approximately balanced." For 

this exercise, you will do an experiment to test whether that is true. 

The depth of a node in a binary tree is the length of the path from the root of the tree 
to that node. That is, the root has depth 0, its children have depth 1, its grandchildren 
have depth 2, and so on. In a balanced tree, all the leaves in the tree are about the same 
depth. For example, in a perfectly balanced tree with 1023 nodes, all the leaves are at 
depth 9. In an approximately balanced tree with 1023 nodes, the average depth of all the 
leaves should be not too much bigger than 9. 

On the other hand, even if the tree is approximately balanced, there might be a few 
leaves that have much larger depth than the average, so we might also want to look at the 
maximum depth among all the leaves in a tree. 

For this exercise, you should create a random binary sort tree with 1023 nodes. The 
items in the tree can be real numbers, and you can create the tree by generating 1023 
random real numbers and inserting them into the tree, using the usual treelnsertO 
method for binary sort trees. Once you have the tree, you should compute and output the 
average depth of all the leaves in the tree and the maximum depth of all the leaves. To 
do this, you will need three recursive subroutines: one to count the leaves, one to find the 
sum of the depths of all the leaves, and one to find the maximum depth. The latter two 
subroutines should have an int-valued parameter, depth, that tells how deep in the tree 
you've gone. When you call this routine from the main program, the depth parameter is 
0; when you call the routine recursively, the parameter increases by 1. 

6. The parsing programs in Section 9.5 work with expressions made up of numbers and (solution) 
operators. We can make things a little more interesting by allowing the variable "x" to 

occur. This would allow expression such as "3* (x-1) * (x+1)" , for example. Make a new 
version of the sample program SimpleParser3.java that can work with such expressions. 
In your program, the mainQ routine can't simply print the value of the expression, since 
the value of the expression now depends on the value of x. Instead, it should print the 
value of the expression for x=0, x=l, x=2, and x=3. 

The original program will have to be modified in several other ways. Currently, the 
program uses classes ConstNode, BinOpNode, and UnaryMinusNode to represent nodes 
in an expression tree. Since expressions can now include x, you will need a new class, 
VariableNode, to represent an occurrence of x in the expression. 

In the original program, each of the node classes has an instance method, 
"double value ()", which returns the value of the node. But in your program, the 
value can depend on x, so you should replace this method with one of the form 
"double value (double xValue)", where the parameter xValue is the value of x. 

Finally, the parsing subroutines in your program will have to take into account the 
fact that expressions can contain x. There is just one small change in the BNF rules for 
the expressions: A <f actor> is allowed to be the variable x: 

<factor> ::= <number> I <x-variable> I "(" <expression> ")" 



Exercises 



470 



where <x-variable> can be either a lower case or an upper case "X". This change in the 
BNF requires a change in the f actorTree () subroutine. 

7. This exercise builds on the previous exercise, Exercise 9.6. To understand it, you should (solution) 
have some background in Calculus. The derivative of an expression that involves the 
variable x can be defined by a few recursive rules: 

• The derivative of a constant is 0. 

• The derivative of x is 1. 

• If A is an expression, let dA be the derivative of A. Then the derivative of -A is -dA. 

• If A and B are expressions, let dA be the derivative of A and let dB be the derivative 
of B. Then the derivative of A+B is dA+dB. 

• The derivative of A-B is dA-dB. 

• The derivative of A*B is A*dB + B*dA. 

• The derivative of A/B is (B*dA - A*dB) / (B*B). 

For this exercise, you should modify your program from the previous exercise so that 
it can compute the derivative of an expression. You can do this by adding a derivative- 
computing method to each of the node classes. First, add another abstract method to the 
ExpNode class: 

abstract ExpNode derivativeO ; 

Then implement this method in each of the four subclasses of ExpNode. All the information 
that you need is in the rules given above. In your main program, instead of printing the 
stack operations for the original expression, you should print out the stack operations 
that define the derivative. Note that the formula that you get for the derivative can be 
much more complicated than it needs to be. For example, the derivative of 3*x+l will be 
computed as (3*l+0*x)+0. This is correct, even though it's kind of ugly, and it would be 
nice for it to be simplified. However, simplifying expressions is not easy. 

As an alternative to printing out stack operations, you might want to print the deriva- 
tive as a fully parenthesized expression. You can do this by adding a printlnf ix() routine 
to each node class. It would be nice to leave out unnecessary parentheses, but again, the 
problem of deciding which parentheses can be left out without altering the meaning of the 
expression is a fairly difficult one, which I don't advise you to attempt. 

(There is one curious thing that happens here: If you apply the rules, as given, to an 
expression tree, the result is no longer a tree, since the same subexpression can occur at 
multiple points in the derivative. For example, if you build a node to represent B*B by 
saying "new BinOpNode ( ' * ' ,B,B)", then the left and right children of the new node are 
actually the same node! This is not allowed in a tree. However, the difference is harmless 
in this case since, like a tree, the structure that you get has no loops in it. Loops, on the 
other hand, would be a disaster in most of the recursive tree-processing subroutines that 
we have written, since it would lead to infinite recursion. The type of structure that is 
built by the derivative functions is technically referred to as a directed acyclic graph.)

Chapter 10 



Generic Programming and 
Collection Classes 

How TO avoid reinventing the wheel? Many data structures and algorithms, such as 
those from Chapter 9, have been studied, programmed, and re-programmed by generations of 
computer science students. This is a valuable learning experience. Unfortunately, they have 
also been programmed and re-programmed by generations of working computer professionals, 
taking up time that could be devoted to new, more creative work. A programmer who needs 
a list or a binary tree shouldn't have to re-code these data structures from scratch. They are 
well-understood and have been programmed thousands of times before. The problem is how to 
make pre-written, robust data structures available to programmers. In this chapter, we'll look 
at Java's attempt to address this problem. 

10.1 Generic Programming 

Generic programming refers to writing code that will work for many types of data. We (online) 
encountered the term in Section 7.3, where we looked at dynamic arrays of integers. The 
source code presented there for working with dynamic arrays of integers works only for data 
of type int. But the source code for dynamic arrays of double, String, JButton, or any other 
type would be almost identical, except for the substitution of one type name for another. It 
seems silly to write essentially the same code over and over. As we saw in Subsection 7.3.3, 
Java goes some distance towards solving this problem by providing the ArrayList class. An 
ArrayList is essentially a dynamic array of values of type Object. Since every class is a subclass 
of Object, objects of any type can be stored in an ArrayList. Java goes even further by providing 
"parameterized types," which were introduced in Subsection 7.3.4. There we saw that the 
ArrayList type can be parameterized, as in ll ArrayList<String>" , to limit the values that can 
be stored in the list to objects of a specified type. Parameterized types extend Java's basic 
philosophy of type-safe programming to generic programming. 

The ArrayList class is just one of several standard classes that are used for generic pro- 
gramming in Java. We will spend the next few sections looking at these classes and how they 
are used, and we'll see that there are also generic methods and generic interfaces (see Subsec- 
tion 5.7.1). All the classes and interfaces discussed in these sections are defined in the package 
java.util, and you will need an import statement at the beginning of your program to get 
access to them. (Before you start putting "import java.util.*" at the beginning of every 
program, you should know that some things in java.util have names that are the same as 



473 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



474 



things in other packages. For example, both java.util.List and java.awt.List exist, so it 
is often better to import the individual classes that you need.) 

In the final section of this chapter, we will see that it is possible to define new generic classes, 
interfaces, and methods. Until then, we will stick to using the generics that are predefined in 
Java's standard library. 

It is no easy task to design a library for generic programming. Java's solution has many 
nice features but is certainly not the only possible approach. It is almost certainly not the 
best, and has a few features that in my opinion can only be called bizarre, but in the context 
of the overall design of Java, it might be close to optimal. To get some perspective on generic 
programming in general, it might be useful to look very briefly at generic programming in two 
other languages. 

10.1.1 Generic Programming in Smalltalk 

Smalltalk was one of the very first object-oriented programming languages. It is still used today, 
although its use is not very common. It has not achieved anything like the popularity of Java 
or C++, but it is the source of many ideas used in these languages. In Smalltalk, essentially 
all programming is generic, because of two basic properties of the language. 

First of all, variables in Smalltalk are typeless. A data value has a type, such as integer or 
string, but variables do not have types. Any variable can hold data of any type. Parameters 
are also typeless, so a subroutine can be applied to parameter values of any type. Similarly, 
a data structure can hold data values of any type. For example, once you've defined a binary 
tree data structure in SmallTalk, you can use it for binary trees of integers or strings or dates 
or data of any other type. There is simply no need to write new code for each data type. 

Secondly, all data values are objects, and all operations on objects are defined by methods 
in a class. This is true even for types that are "primitive" in Java, such as integers. When the 
"+" operator is used to add two integers, the operation is performed by calling a method in the 
integer class. When you define a new class, you can define a "+" operator, and you will then 
be able to add objects belonging to that class by saying "a + b" just as if you were adding 
numbers. Now, suppose that you write a subroutine that uses the "+" operator to add up the 
items in a list. The subroutine can be applied to a list of integers, but it can also be applied, 
automatically, to any other data type for which "+" is defined. Similarly, a subroutine that 
uses the "<" operator to sort a list can be applied to lists containing any type of data for which 
"<" is defined. There is no need to write a different sorting subroutine for each type of data. 

Put these two features together and you have a language where data structures and al- 
gorithms will work for any type of data for which they make sense, that is, for which the 
appropriate operations are defined. This is real generic programming. This might sound pretty 
good, and you might be asking yourself why all programming languages don't work this way. 
This type of freedom makes it easier to write programs, but unfortunately it makes it harder 
to write programs that are correct and robust (see Chapter 8). Once you have a data structure 
that can contain data of any type, it becomes hard to ensure that it only holds the type of 
data that you want it to hold. If you have a subroutine that can sort any type of data, it's 
hard to ensure that it will only be applied to data for which the "<" operator is defined. More 
particularly, there is no way for a compiler to ensure these things. The problem will only show 
up at run time when an attempt is made to apply some operation to a data type for which it 
is not defined, and the program will crash.

10.1.2 Generic Programming in C-\ — \- 

Unlike Smalltalk, C++ is a very strongly typed language, even more so than Java. Every 
variable has a type, and can only hold data values of that type. This means that the kind 
of generic programming that is used in Smalltalk is impossible in C++. Furthermore, C++ 
does not have anything corresponding to Java's Object class. That is, there is no class that 
is a superclass of all other classes. This means that C++ can't use Java's style of generic 
programming with non-parameterized generic types either. Nevertheless, C++ has a powerful 
and flexible system of generic programming. It is made possible by a language feature known 
as templates. In C++, instead of writing a different sorting subroutine for each type of data, 
you can write a single subroutine template. The template is not a subroutine; it's more like a 
factory for making subroutines. We can look at an example, since the syntax of C++ is very 
similar to Java's: 

template<class ItemType> 

void sort( ItemType A[], int count ) { 

// Sort items in the array, A, into increasing order. 
// The items in positions 0, 1, 2, (count-1) are sorted. 

// The algorithm that is used here is selection sort, 
for (int i = count-1; i > 0; i — ) { 
int position_of jnax = 0; 
for (int j =1; j <= count ; j++) 
if ( A[j] > A [position_of _max] ) 
position_of _max = j ; 
ItemType temp = A [count]; 
A[count] = A [position_of jmax] ; 
A [position_of _max] = temp; 

> 

} 

This piece of code defines a subroutine template. If you remove the first line, "template<class 
ItemType>" , and substitute the word "int" for the word "ItemType" in the rest of the template, 
you get a subroutine for sorting arrays of ints. (Even though it says "class ItemType", you 
can actually substitute any type for ItemType, including the primitive types.) If you substitute 
"string" for "ItemType", you get a subroutine for sorting arrays of strings. This is pretty much 
what the compiler does with the template. If your program says "sort (list , 10)" where list 
is an array of ints, the compiler uses the template to generate a subroutine for sorting arrays 
of ints. If you say "sort (cards, 10)" where cards is an array of objects of type Card, then the 
compiler generates a subroutine for sorting arrays of Cards. At least, it tries to. The template 
uses the ">" operator to compare values. If this operator is defined for values of type Card, then 
the compiler will successfully use the template to generate a subroutine for sorting cards. If 
">" is not defined for Cards, then the compiler will fail — but this will happen at compile time, 
not, as in Smalltalk, at run time where it would make the program crash. 

In addition to subroutine templates, C++ also has templates for making classes. If you 
write a template for a binary tree class, you can use it to generate classes for binary trees of 
ints, binary trees of strings, binary trees of dates, and so on — all from one template. The most 
recent version of C++ comes with a large number of pre- written templates called the Standard 
Template Library or STL. The STL is quite complex. Many people would say that it's much 
too complex. But it is also one of the most interesting features of C++. 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES

10.1.3 Generic Programming in Java 

Java's generic programming features have gone through several stages of development. The 
original version of Java had just a few generic data structure classes, such as Vector, that could 
hold values of type Object. Java version 1.2 introduced a much larger group of generics that 
followed the same basic model. These generic classes and interfaces as a group are known as 
the Java Collection Framework. The Array List class is part of the Collection Framework. 
The original Collection Framework was closer in spirit to Smalltalk than it was to C++, since 
a data structure designed to hold Objects can be used with objects of any type. Unfortunately, 
as in Smalltalk, the result is a category of errors that show up only at run time, rather than 
at compile time. If a programmer assumes that all the items in a data structure are strings 
and tries to process those items as strings, a run-time error will occur if other types of data 
have inadvertently been added to the data structure. In Java, the error will most likely occur 
when the program retrieves an Object from the data structure and tries to type-cast it to type 
String. If the object is not actually of type String, the illegal type-cast will throw an error of 
type ClassCastException. 

Java 5.0 introduced parameterized types, such as ArrayList<String>. This made it possible to 
create generic data structures that can be type-checked at compile time rather than at run time. 
With these data structures, type-casting is not necessary, so ClassCastExceptions are avoided. 
The compiler will detect any attempt to add an object of the wrong type to the data structure; 
it will report a syntax error and will refuse to compile the program. In Java 5.0, all of the 
classes and interfaces in the Collection Framework, and even some classes that are not part of 
that framework, have been parameterized. Java's parameterized classes are similar to template 
classes in C++ (although the implementation is very different), and their introduction moves 
Java's generic programming model closer to C++ and farther from Smalltalk. In this chapter, 
I will use the parameterized types almost exclusively, but you should remember that their use 
is not mandatory. It is still legal to use a parameterized class as a non-parameterized type, 
such as a plain Array List. 

Note that there is a significant difference between parameterized classes in Java and tem- 
plate classes in C++. A template class in C++ is not really a class at all — it's a kind of factory 
for generating classes. Every time the template is used with a new type, a new compiled class 
is created. With a Java parameterized class, there is only one compiled class file. For example, 
there is only one compiled class file, ArrayList . class, for the parameterized class ArrayList. 
The parameterized types ArrayList<String> and ArrayList<lnteger> both use the same compiled 
class file, as does the plain ArrayList type. The type parameter — String or Integer — just tells the 
compiler to limit the type of object that can be stored in the data structure. The type parame- 
ter has no effect at run time and is not even known at run time. The type information is said to 
be "erased" at run time. This type erasure introduces a certain amount of weirdness. For ex- 
ample, you can't test "if (list instanceof ArrayList<String>)" because the instanceof 
operator is evaluated at run time, and at run time only the plain ArrayList exists. Even worse, 
you can't create an array that has base type ArrayList<String> by using the new operator, as in 
"new ArrayList<String> [N] " . This is because the new operator is evaluated at run time, and 
at run time there is no such thing as "ArrayList<String>" ; only the non-parameterized type 
ArrayList exists at run time. 

Fortunately, most programmers don't have to deal with such problems, since they turn up 
only in fairly advanced programming. Most people who use the Java Collection Framework will 
not encounter them, and they will get the benefits of type-safe generic programming with little 
difficulty. 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



477 



10.1.4 The Java Collection Framework 

Java's generic data structures can be divided into two categories: collections and maps. A 
collection is more or less what it sounds like: a collection of objects. A map associates objects 
in one set with objects in another set in the way that a dictionary associates definitions with 
words or a phone book associates phone numbers with names. A map is similar to what I called 
an "association list" in Subsection 7.4.2. In Java, collections and maps are represented by the 
parameterized interfaces Collection<T> and Map<T,S>. Here, "T" and "S" stand for any type 
except for the primitive types. Map<T,S> is the first example we have seen where there are two 
type parameters, T and S; we will not deal further with this possibility until we look at maps 
more closely in Section 10.3. In this section and the next, we look at collections only. 

There are two types of collections: lists and sets. A list is a collection in which the objects 
are arranged in a linear sequence. A list has a first item, a second item, and so on. For any 
item in the list, except the last, there is an item that directly follows it. The defining property 
of a set is that no object can occur more than once in a set; the elements of a set are not neces- 
sarily thought of as being in any particular order. The ideas of lists and sets are represented as 
parameterized interfaces List<T> and Set<T>. These are sub-interfaces of Collection<T>. That 
is, any object that implements the interface List<T> or Set<T> automatically implements Col- 
lection< T> as well. The interface Collection< T> specifies general operations that can be applied 
to any collection at all. List< T> and Set< T> add additional operations that are appropriate for 
lists and sets respectively. 

Of course, any actual object that is a collection, list, or set must belong to a concrete class 
that implements the corresponding interface. For example, the class ArrayList<T> implements 
the interface List<T> and therefore also implements Collection<T>. This means that all the 
methods that are defined in the list and collection interfaces can be used with, for example, 
an ArrayList<String> object. We will look at various classes that implement the list and set 
interfaces in the next section. But before we do that, we'll look briefly at some of the general 
operations that are available for all collections. 

* * * 

The interface Collection< T> specifies methods for performing some basic operations on any 
collection of objects. Since "collection" is a very general concept, operations that can be applied 
to all collections are also very general. They are generic operations in the sense that they can 
be applied to various types of collections containing various types of objects. Suppose that 
coll is an object that implements the interface Collection<T> (for some specific non-primitive 
type 7"). Then the following operations, which are specified in the interface Collection<T>, are 
defined for coll: 

• coll. size () — returns an int that gives the number of objects in the collection. 

• coll . isEmpty () — returns a boolean value which is true if the size of the collection is 0. 

• coll. clear () — removes all objects from the collection. 

• coll . add(tobject) — adds tobject to the collection. The parameter must be of type 7"; 
if not, a syntax error occurs at compile time. This method returns a boolean value which 
tells you whether the operation actually modified the collection. For example, adding an 
object to a Set has no effect if that object was already in the set. 

• coll . contains (object) - - returns a boolean value that is true if object is in the 

collection. Note that object is not required to be of type T, since it makes sense to 
check whether object is in the collection, no matter what type object has. (For testing 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



478 



equality, null is considered to be equal to itself. The criterion for testing non-null objects 
for equality can differ from one kind of collection to another; see Subsection 10.1.6, below.) 

• coll . remove (obj ect) — removes obj ect from the collection, if it occurs in the collection, 
and returns a boolean value that tells you whether the object was found. Again, object 
is not required to be of type T. 

• coll . containsAll(coll2) — returns a boolean value that is true if every object in 
coll2 is also in coll. The parameter can be any collection. 

• coll . addAll (coll2) — adds all the objects in coll2 to coll. The parameter, coll2, 
can be any collection of type Collection<T>. However, it can also be more general. For 
example, if T is a class and S is a sub-class of T, then coll2 can be of type Collection<S>. 
This makes sense because any object of type S is automatically of type T and so can 
legally be added to coll. 

• coll.removeAll(coll2) — removes every object from coll that also occurs in the 
collection coll2. coll2 can be any collection. 

• coll.retainAll(coll2) — removes every object from coll that does not occur in 

the collection coll2. It "retains" only the objects that do occur in coll2. coll2 can be 
any collection. 

• coll .toArrayQ — returns an array of type Object[] that contains all the items in the 
collection. Note that the return type is Object[], not T[]! However, there is another 
version of this method that takes an array of type T[] as a parameter: the method 
coll .toArray(tarray) returns an array of type T[] containing all the items in the collec- 
tion. If the array parameter tarray is large enough to hold the entire collection, then the 
items are stored in tarray and tarray is also the return value of the collection. If tarray 
is not large enough, then a new array is created to hold the items; in that case tarray 
serves only to specify the type of the array. For example, coll . toArray (new String [0] ) 
can be used if coll is a collection of Strings and will return a new array of type String[]. 

Since these methods are part of the Collection< T> interface, they must be defined for every 
object that implements that interface. There is a problem with this, however. For example, 
the size of some collections cannot be changed after they are created. Methods that add or 
remove objects don't make sense for these collections. While it is still legal to call the methods, 
an exception will be thrown when the call is evaluated at run time. The type of the exception 
is UnsupportedOperationException. Furthermore, since Collection<T> is only an interface, not a 
concrete class, the actual implementation of the method is left to the classes that implement 
the interface. This means that the semantics of the methods, as described above, are not 
guaranteed to be valid for all collection objects; they are valid, however, for classes in the Java 
Collection Framework. 

There is also the question of efficiency. Even when an operation is defined for several types of 
collections, it might not be equally efficient in all cases. Even a method as simple as sizeQ can 
vary greatly in efficiency. For some collections, computing the size() might involve counting 
the items in the collection. The number of steps in this process is equal to the number of items. 
Other collections might have instance variables to keep track of the size, so evaluating size() 
just means returning the value of a variable. In this case, the computation takes only one step, 
no matter how many items there are. When working with collections, it's good to have some 
idea of how efficient operations are and to choose a collection for which the operations that you 
need can be implemented most efficiently. We'll see specific examples of this in the next two 
sections. 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



479 



10.1.5 Iterators and for-each Loops 

The interface Collection<T> defines a few basic generic algorithms, but suppose you want to 
write your own generic algorithms. Suppose, for example, you want to do something as simple 
as printing out every item in a collection. To do this in a generic way, you need some way of 
going through an arbitrary collection, accessing each item in turn. We have seen how to do 
this for specific data structures: For an array, you can use a for loop to iterate through all 
the array indices. For a linked list, you can use a while loop in which you advance a pointer 
along the list. For a binary tree, you can use a recursive subroutine to do an inorder traversal. 
Collections can be represented in any of these forms and many others besides. With such a 
variety of traversal mechanisms, how can we even hope to come up with a single generic method 
that will work for collections that are stored in wildly different forms? This problem is solved 
by iterators. An iterator is an object that can be used to traverse a collection. Different 
types of collections have iterators that are implemented in different ways, but all iterators are 
used in the same way. An algorithm that uses an iterator to traverse a collection is generic, 
because the same technique can be applied to any type of collection. Iterators can seem rather 
strange to someone who is encountering generic programming for the first time, but you should 
understand that they solve a difficult problem in an elegant way. 

The interface Collection< T> defines a method that can be used to obtain an iterator for any 
collection. If coll is a collection, then coll . iterator () returns an iterator that can be used 
to traverse the collection. You should think of the iterator as a kind of generalized pointer that 
starts at the beginning of the collection and can move along the collection from one item to the 
next. Iterators are defined by a parameterized interface named lterator<T>. If coll implements 
the interface Collection<T> for some specific type T, then coll . iterator () returns an iterator 
of type lterator<T>, with the same type T as its type parameter. The interface lterator<T> 
defines just three methods. If iter refers to an object that implements lterator<T>, then we 
have: 

• iter. next () — returns the next item, and advances the iterator. The return value is of 
type T. This method lets you look at one of the items in the collection. Note that there is 
no way to look at an item without advancing the iterator past that item. If this method 
is called when no items remain, it will throw a NoSuchElementException. 

• iter.hasNextO — returns a boolean value telling you whether there are more items to 
be processed. In general, you should test this before calling iter. next (). 

• iter .remove () — if you call this after calling iter, next (), it will remove the item 
that you just saw from the collection. Note that this method has no parameter. It 
removes the item that was most recently returned by iter. next (). This might produce 
an UnsupportedOperationException, if the collection does not support removal of items. 

Using iterators, we can write code for printing all the items in any collection. Suppose, 
for example, that coll is of type Collection<String> . In that case, the value returned by 
coll. iterator () is of type lterator<String>, and we can say: 

Iterator<String> iter; // Declare the iterator variable, 

iter = coll . iterator () ; // Get an iterator for the collection, 

while ( iter.hasNextO ) { 

String item = iter.nextO; // Get the next item. 

System. out .println(item) ; 

} 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



480 



The same general form will work for other types of processing. For example, the following code 
will remove all null values from any collection of type Collection<JButton> (as long as that 
collection supports removal of values): 

Iterator<JButton> iter = coll . iterator () : 
while ( iter .hasNextO ) { 

JButton item = iter.nextO; 

if (item == null) 
iter .remove () ; 

} 

(Note, by the way, that when Collection<T>, lterator<T>, or any other parameterized type is 
used in actual code, they are always used with actual types such as String or JButton in place of 
the "formal type parameter" T. An iterator of type lterator<String> is used to iterate through a 
collection of Strings; an iterator of type lterator<JButton> is used to iterate through a collection 
of J Buttons; and so on.) 

An iterator is often used to apply the same operation to all the elements in a collection. 
In many cases, it's possible to avoid the use of iterators for this purpose by using a for-each 
loop. The for-each loop was discussed in Subsection 3.4.4 for use with enumerated types and 
in Subsection 7.2.2 for use with arrays. A for-each loop can also be used to iterate through any 
collection. For a collection coll of type Collection<T>, a for-each loop takes the form: 

for ( T x : coll ) { // "for each object x, of type T, in coll" 
// process x 

} 

Here, x is the loop control variable. Each object in coll will be assigned to x in turn, and the 

body of the loop will be executed for each object. Since objects in coll are of type T, x is 
declared to be of type T. For example, if namelist is of type Collection<String> , we can print 
out all the names in the collection with: 

for ( String name : namelist ) { 
System. out .println( name ); 

} 

This for-each loop could, of course, be written as a while loop using an iterator, but the for-each 
loop is much easier to follow. 

10.1.6 Equality and Comparison 

There are several methods in the Collection interface that test objects for equality. For exam- 
ple, the methods coll . contains (object) and coll. remove (object) look for an item in the 
collection that is equal to object. However, equality is not such a simple matter. The obvious 
technique for testing equality — using the == operator — does not usually give a reasonable an- 
swer when applied to objects. The == operator tests whether two objects are identical in the 
sense that they share the same location in memory. Usually, however, we want to consider two 
objects to be equal if they represent the same value, which is a very different thing. Two values 
of type String should be considered equal if they contain the same sequence of characters. The 
question of whether those characters are stored in the same location in memory is irrelevant. 
Two values of type Date should be considered equal if they represent the same time. 

The Object class defines the boolean- valued method equals (Object) for testing whether 
one object is equal to another. This method is used by many, but not by all, collection 
classes for deciding whether two objects are to be considered the same. In the Object class, 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



481 



obj 1 . equals (obj2) is denned to be the same as obj 1 == obj2. However, for most sub-classes 
of Object, this definition is not reasonable, and it should be overridden. The String class, for 
example, overrides equals () so that for a String str, str. equals (obj) if obj is also a String 
and obj contains the same sequence of characters as str. 

If you write your own class, you might want to define an equals () method in that class to 
get the correct behavior when objects are tested for equality. For example, a Card class that 
will work correctly when used in collections could be defined as: 

public class Card { // Class to represent playing cards. 

int suit; // Number from to 3 that codes for the suit — 

// spades, diamonds, clubs or hearts, 
int value; // Number from 1 to 13 that represents the value. 

public boolean equals (Object obj) { 
try { 

Card other = (Card) obj; // Type-cast obj to a Card. 

if (suit == other. suit && value == other. value) { 

// The other card has the same suit and value as 
// this card, so they should be considered equal, 
return true ; 

} 

else 

return false; 

} 

catch (Exception e) { 

// This will catch the NullPointerException that occurs if obj 
//is null and the ClassCastException that occurs if obj is 
// not of type Card. In these cases, obj is not equal to 
// this Card, so return false, 
return false; 

} 

> 

. // other methods and constructors 

} 

Without the equals () method in this class, methods such as contains () and remove () in the 
interface Collection<Card> will not work as expected. 

A similar concern arises when items in a collection are sorted. Sorting refers to arranging 
a sequence of items in ascending order, according to some criterion. The problem is that there 
is no natural notion of ascending order for arbitrary objects. Before objects can be sorted, 
some method must be defined for comparing them. Objects that are meant to be compared 
should implement the interface java. lang. Comparable. In fact, Comparable is defined as a 
parameterized interface, Comparable<T>, which represents the ability to be compared to an 
object of type T. The interface Comparable< T> defines one method: 

public int compareTo( T obj ) 

The value returned by obj 1 . compareTo(obj2) should be negative if and only if objl comes 
before obj 2, when the objects are arranged in ascending order. It should be positive if and 
only if objl comes after obj 2. A return value of zero means that the objects are considered 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



482 



to be the same for the purposes of this comparison. This does not necessarily mean that the 
objects are equal in the sense that obj 1 . equals (obj 2) is true. For example, if the objects are 
of type Address, representing mailing addresses, it might be useful to sort the objects by zip 
code. Two Addresses are considered the same for the purposes of the sort if they have the same 
zip code — but clearly that would not mean that they are the same address. 

The String class implements the interface Comparable<String> and defines compareTo in a 
reasonable way. In this case, the return value of compareTo is zero if and only if the two strings 
that are being compared are equal. (It is generally a good idea for the compareTo method in 
classes that implement Comparable to have the analogous property.) If you define your own 
class and want to be able to sort objects belonging to that class, you should do the same. For 
example: 

/** 

* Represents a full name consisting of a first name and a last name. 
*/ 

public class FullName implements Comparable<FullName> { 

private String firstName, lastName; // Non-null first and last names. 

public FullName (String first, String last) { // Constructor, 
if (first == null I I last == null) 

throw new IllegalArgumentExceptionC'Names must be non-null."); 
firstName = first; 
lastName = last; 

} 

public boolean equals (Object obj) { 
try { 

FullName other = (FullName) obj ; // Type-cast obj to type FullName 
return firstName . equals (other .firstName) 

&& lastName . equals (other . lastName) ; 

} 

catch (Exception e) { 

return false; // if obj is null or is not of type FullName 

} 

} 

public int compareTo ( FullName other ) { 

if ( lastName. compareTo (other. lastName) < ) { 

//If lastName comes before the last name of 
// the other object, then this FullName comes 
// before the other FullName. Return a negative 
// value to indicate this, 
return -1; 

} 

else if ( lastName . compareTo (other . lastName) > ) { 
//If lastName comes after the last name of 
// the other object, then this FullName comes 
// after the other FullName. Return a positive 
// value to indicate this, 
return 1 ; 

} 

else { 

// Last names are the same, so base the comparison on 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



483 



// the first names, using compareTo from class String, 
return firstName . compareTo (other . firstName) ; 

} 

} 

. // other methods 

} 

(I find it a little odd that the class here is declared as "class FullName implements 
Comparable<FullName>" , with "FullName" repeated as a type parameter in the name of the 
interface. However, it does make sense. It means that we are going to compare objects that 
belong to the class FullName to other objects of the same type. Even though this is the only 
reasonable thing to do, that fact is not obvious to the Java compiler — and the type parameter 
in Comparable<FullName> is there for the compiler.) 

There is another way to allow for comparison of objects in Java, and that is to provide 
a separate object that is capable of making the comparison. The object must implement the 
interface Comparator<T>, where T is the type of the objects that are to be compared. The 
interface Comparator<T> defines the method: 

public int compare ( T objl, T obj2 ) 

This method compares two objects of type T and returns a value that is negative, or positive, 
or zero, depending on whether obj 1 comes before obj2, or comes after obj 2, or is considered to 
be the same as obj 2 for the purposes of this comparison. Comparators are useful for compar- 
ing objects that do not implement the Comparable interface and for defining several different 
orderings on the same collection of objects. 

In the next two sections, we'll see how Comparable and Comparator are used in the context 
of collections and maps. 

10.1.7 Generics and Wrapper Classes 

As noted above, Java's generic programming does not apply to the primitive types, since generic 
data structures can only hold objects, while values of primitive type are not objects. However, 
the "wrapper classes" that were introduced in Subsection 5.3.2 make it possible to get around 
this restriction to a great extent. 

Recall that each primitive type has an associated wrapper class: class Integer for type int, 
class Boolean for type boolean, class Character for type char, and so on. 

An object of type Integer contains a value of type int. The object serves as a "wrapper" 
for the primitive type value, which allows it to be used in contexts where objects are required, 
such as in generic data structures. For example, a list of Integers can be stored in a variable of 
type ArrayList<lnteger>, and interfaces such as Collection<lnteger> and Set<lnteger> are defined. 
Furthermore, class Integer defines equals (), compareTo (), and toStringO methods that do 
what you would expect (that is, that compare and write out the corresponding primitive type 
values in the usual way). Similar remarks apply for all the wrapper classes. 

Recall also that Java does automatic conversions between a primitive type and the corre- 
sponding wrapper type. (These conversions, which are called autoboxing and unboxing, were 
also introduced in Subsection 5.3.2.) This means that once you have created a generic data 
structure to hold objects belonging to one of the wrapper classes, you can use the data structure 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



484 



pretty much as if it actually contained primitive type values. For example, if numbers is a vari- 
able of type Collection<lnteger>, it is legal to call numbers . add (17) or numbers. remove (42). 
You can't literally add the primitive type value 17 to numbers, but Java will automatically con- 
vert the 17 to the corresponding wrapper object, new Integer (17), and the wrapper object 
will be added to the collection. (The creation of the object does add some time and memory 
overhead to the operation, and you should keep that in mind in situations where efficiency is 
important. An array of int is more efficient than an ArrayList<lnteger>.) 

10.2 Lists and Sets 

In THE PREVIOUS SECTION, we looked at the general properties of collection classes in Java. In (online) 
this section, we look at some specific collection classes and how to use them. These classes can 
be divided into two categories: lists and sets. A list consists of a sequence of items arranged in 
a linear order. A list has a definite order, but is not necessarily sorted into ascending order. A 
set is a collection that has no duplicate entries. The elements of a set might or might not be 
arranged into some definite order. 

10.2.1 ArrayList and LinkedList 

There are two obvious ways to represent a list: as a dynamic array and as a linked list. We've 
encountered these already in Section 7.3 and Section 9.2. Both of these options are available 
in generic form as the collection classes java.util. ArrayList and java.util. LinkedList. 
These classes are part of the Java Collection Framework. Each implements the interface List< T>, 
and therefore the interface Collection<T>. An object of type ArrayList<T> represents an ordered 
sequence of objects of type T, stored in an array that will grow in size whenever necessary as 
new items are added. An object of type LinkedList<T> also represents an ordered sequence of 
objects of type 7", but the objects are stored in nodes that are linked together with pointers. 

Both list classes support the basic list operations that are defined in the interface List<T>, 
and an abstract data type is defined by its operations, not by its representation. So why two 
classes? Why not a single List class with a single representation? The problem is that there is 
no single representation of lists for which all list operations are efficient. For some operations, 
linked lists are more efficient than arrays. For others, arrays are more efficient. In a particular 
application of lists, it's likely that only a few operations will be used frequently. You want 
to choose the representation for which the frequently used operations will be as efficient as 
possible. 

Broadly speaking, the LinkedList class is more efficient in applications where items will often 
be added or removed at the beginning of the list or in the middle of the list. In an array, these 
operations require moving a large number of items up or down one position in the array, to 
make a space for a new item or to fill in the hole left by the removal of an item. In terms of 
asymptotic analysis (Section 8.5), adding an element at the beginning or in the middle of an 
array has run time 0(n), where n is the number of items in the array. In a linked list, nodes can 
be added or removed at any position by changing a few pointer values, an operation that has 
run time 0(1). That is, the operation takes only some constant amount of time, independent 
of how many items are in the list. 

On the other hand, the ArrayList class is more efficient when random access to items is 
required. Random access means accessing the k-th item in the list, for any integer k. Random 
access is used when you get or change the value stored at a specified position in the list. This is 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



485 



trivial for an array, with run time 0(1)- But for a linked list it means starting at the beginning 
of the list and moving from node to node along the list for k steps, an operation that has run 
time 0(k). 

Operations that can be done efficiently for both types of lists include sorting and adding an 
item at the end of the list. 

All lists implement the methods from interface Collection<T> that were discussed in Sub- 
section 10.1.4. These methods include size(), isEmptyO, add(T), remove (Object), and 
clear(). The add(T) method adds the object at the end of the list. The remove (Object) 
method involves first finding the object, which is not very efficient for any list since it involves 
going through the items in the list from beginning to end until the object is found. The interface 
List<T> adds some methods for accessing list items according to their numerical positions in 
the list. Suppose that list is an object of type List<T>. Then we have the methods: 

• list, get (index) — returns the object of type T that is at position index in the list, 
where index is an integer. Items are numbered 0, 1, 2, ... , list . size () -1. The param- 
eter must be in this range, or an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. 

• list, set (index ,obj) — stores the object obj at position number index in the list, 
replacing the object that was there previously. The object obj must be of type T. This 
does not change the number of elements in the list or move any of the other elements. 

• list, add (index, obj) — inserts an object obj into the list at position number index, 
where obj must be of type T. The number of items in the list increases by one, and items 
that come after position index move down one position to make room for the new item. 
The value of index must be in the range to list. size (), inclusive. If index is equal 
to list . size () , then obj is added at the end of the list. 

• list, remove (index) — removes the object at position number index, and returns that 
object as the return value of the method. Items after this position move up one space in 
the list to fill the hole, and the size of the list decreases by one. The value of index must 
be in the range to list . size ()-l 

• list . indexOf (obj ) — returns an int that gives the position of obj in the list, if it occurs. 
If it does not occur, the return value is -1. The object obj can be of any type, not just 
of type T. If obj occurs more than once in the list, the index of the first occurrence is 
returned. 

These methods are defined both in class ArrayList<T> and in class LinkedList<T>, although 
some of them — get and set — are only efficient for ArrayLists. The class LinkedList<T> adds a 
few additional methods, which are not defined for an ArrayList. If linkedlist is an object of 
type LinkedList<T>, then we have 

• linkedlist .getFirst () — returns the object of type T that is the first item in the list. 
The list is not modified. If the list is empty when the method is called, an exception of 
type NoSuchElementException is thrown (the same is true for the next three methods as 
well). 

• linkedlist .getLast () — returns the object of type T that is the last item in the list. 
The list is not modified. 

• linkedlist. removeFirst () — removes the first item from the list, and returns that 
object of type T as its return value. 

• linkedlist . removeLast () — removes the last item from the list, and returns that object 
of type T as its return value. 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



486 



• linkedlist . addFirst (obj ) — adds the obj, which must be of type T, to the beginning 
of the list. 

• linkedlist . addLast (obj ) — adds the object obj, which must be of type T, to the end 
of the list. (This is exactly the same as linkedlist . add (obj ) but is defined to keep the 
naming consistent.) 

These methods are apparently defined to make it easy to use a LinkedList as if it were a 
stack or a queue. (See Section 9.3.) For example, we can use a LinkedList as a queue by adding 
items onto one end of the list (using the addLast () method) and removing them from the other 
end (using the removeFirst () method). 

If list is an object of type List<T>, then the method list . iterator () , defined in the 
interface Collection<T>, returns an Iterator that can be used to traverse the list from beginning 
to end. However, for Lists, there is a special type of Iterator, called a Listlterator, which offers 
additional capabilities. Listlterator<T> is an interface that extends the interface lterator<T>. 
The method list . listlterator () returns an object of type Listlterator<T>. 

A Listlterator has the usual Iterator methods, hasNextO, next(), and remove (), but it 
also has methods hasPrevious () , previous (), and add(obj) that make it possible to move 
backwards in the list and to add an item at the current position of the iterator. To understand 
how these work, it's best to think of an iterator as pointing to a position between two list 
elements, or at the beginning or end of the list. In this diagram, the items in a list are 
represented by squares, and arrows indicate the possible positions of an iterator: 



t t t t t t t 

If iter is of type Listlterator<T>, then iter. next () moves the iterator one space to the 
right along the list and returns the item that the iterator passes as it moves. The method 
iter. previous () moves the iterator one space to the left along the list and returns the item 
that it passes. The method iter .remove () removes an item from the list; the item that is 
removed is the item that the iterator passed most recently in a call to either iter. next () or 
iter, previous (). There is also a method iter, add (obj) that adds the specified object to the 
list at the current position of the iterator (where obj must be of type 7"). This can be between 
two existing items or at the beginning of the list or at the end of the list. 

(By the way, the lists that are used in class LinkedList<T> are doubly linked lists. 
That is, each node in the list contains two pointers — one to the next node in the list and 
one to the previous node. This makes it possible to efficiently implement both the next() 
and previous () methods of a Listlterator. Also, to make the addLast () and getLastO 
methods of a LinkedList efficient, the class LinkedList<T> includes an instance variable that 
points to the last node in the list.) 

As an example of using a Listlterator, suppose that we want to maintain a list of items that 
is always sorted into increasing order. When adding an item to the list, we can use a Listlterator 
to find the position in the list where the item should be added. Once the position has been 
found, we use the same list iterator to place the item in that position. The idea is to start at 
the beginning of the list and to move the iterator forward past all the items that are smaller 
than the item that is being inserted. At that point, the iterator's add() method can be used to 
insert the item. To be more definite, suppose that stringList is a variable of type List<String>. 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



487 



Assume that that the strings that are already in the list are stored in ascending order and that 
newltem is a string that we would like to insert into the list. The following code will place 
newltem in the list in its correct position, so that the modified list is still in ascending order: 

ListIterator<String> iter = stringList .listlteratorO ; 

// Move the iterator so that it points to the position where 
// newltem should be inserted into the list. If newltem is 
// bigger than all the items in the list, then the while loop 
// will end when iter .hasNextO becomes false, that is, when 
// the iterator has reached the end of the list. 

while (iter.hasNextQ) { 

String item = iter.nextO; 

if (newltem. compareTo (item) <= 0) { 

// newltem should come BEFORE item in the list. 
// Move the iterator back one space so that 
// it points to the correct insertion point, 
/ / and end the loop . 
iter . previous ( ) ; 
break; 

} 

} 

iter. add (newltem) ; 

Here, stringList might be of type ArrayList<String> or of type LinkedList<String>. The 
algorithm that is used to insert newltem into the list will be about equally efficient for both types 
of lists, and it will even work for other classes that implement the interface List<String>. You 
would probably find it easier to design an insertion algorithm that uses array-like indexing with 
the methods get (index) and add(index,obj). However, that algorithm would be horribly 
inefficient for LinkedLists because random access is so inefficient for linked lists. (By the way, 
the insertion algorithm works when the list is empty. It might be useful for you to think about 
why this is true.) 

10.2.2 Sorting 

Sorting a list is a fairly common operation, and there should really be a sorting method in the 
List interface. There is not, presumably because it only makes sense to sort lists of certain 
types of objects, but methods for sorting lists are available as static methods in the class 
java.util. Collections. This class contains a variety of static utility methods for working 
with collections. The methods are generic; that is, they will work for collections of objects of 
various types. Suppose that list is of type List<T>. The command 

Collections . sort (list) ; 

can be used to sort the list into ascending order. The items in the list should implement the 
interface Comparable<T> (see Subsection 10.1.6). The method Collections . sort () will work, 
for example, for lists of String and for lists of any of the wrapper classes such as Integer and 
Double. There is also a sorting method that takes a Comparator as its second argument: 

Collections . sort (list , comparator) ; 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



488 



In this method, the comparator will be used to compare the items in the list. As mentioned 
in the previous section, a Comparator is an object that defines a compare () method that can 
be used to compare two objects. We'll see an example of using a Comparator in Section 10.4. 

The sorting method that is used by Collections . sort () is the so-called "merge sort" 
algorithm, which has both worst-case and average-case run times that are 0(n*log(n)) for 
a list of size n. Although the average run time for MergeSort is a little slower than that of 
QuickSort, its worst-case performance is much better than Quicksort's. (QuickSort was covered 
in Subsection 9.1.3.) MergeSort also has a nice property called "stability" that we will encounter 
at the end of Subsection 10.4.3. 

The Collections class has at least two other useful methods for modifying lists. 
Collections . shuffle (list) will rearrange the elements of the list into a random order. 
Collections, reverse (list) will reverse the order of the elements, so that the last element is 
moved to the beginning of the list, the next-to-last element to the second position, and so on. 

Since an efficient sorting method is provided for Lists, there is no need to write one your- 
self. You might be wondering whether there is an equally convenient method for standard 
arrays. The answer is yes. Array-sorting methods are available as static methods in the class 
java.util. Arrays. The statement 

Arrays . sort (A) ; 

will sort an array, A, provided either that the base type of A is one of the primitive types (except 
boolean) or that A is an array of Objects that implement the Comparable interface. You can 
also sort part of an array. This is important since arrays are often only "partially filled." The 
command: 

Arrays . sort (A,f romIndex,toIndex) ; 

sorts the elements A [f romlndex] , A [f romlndex+l] , . . . , A [tolndex-l] into ascending order. 
You can use Arrays . sort (A, 0,N) to sort a partially filled array which has items in the first N 
positions. 

Java does not support generic programming for primitive types. In order to implement the 
command Arrays . sort (A) , the Arrays class contains eight methods: one method for arrays 
of Objects and one method for each of the primitive types byte, short, int, long, float, double, 
and char. 

10.2.3 TreeSet and HashSet 

A set is a collection of objects in which no object occurs more than once. Sets implement all 
the methods in the interface Collection<T>, but do so in a way that ensures that no element 
occurs twice in the set. For example, if set is an object of type Set<T>, then set.add(obj) 
will have no effect on the set if obj is already an element of the set. Java has two classes that 
implement the interface Set<T>: java.util .TreeSet and java.util. HashSet. 

In addition to being a Set, a TreeSet has the property that the elements of the set are 
arranged into ascending sorted order. An Iterator (or a for-each loop) for a TreeSet will always 
visit the elements of the set in ascending order. 

A TreeSet cannot hold arbitrary objects, since there must be a way to determine the sorted 
order of the objects it contains. Ordinarily, this means that the objects in a set of type 
TreeSet<T> should implement the interface Comparable<T> and that obj 1 . compareTo(obj2) 
should be defined in a reasonable way for any two objects objl and obj 2 in the set. Alter- 
natively, an object of type Comparator<T> can be provided as a parameter to the constructor 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



489 



when the TreeSet is created. In that case, the compareToO method of the Comparator will be 
used to compare objects that are added to the set. 

A TreeSet does not use the equals () method to test whether two objects are the same. 
Instead, it uses the compareTo () method. This can be a problem. Recall from Subsection 10.1.6 
that compareToO can consider two objects to be the same for the purpose of the comparison 
even though the objects are not equal. For a TreeSet, this means that only one of those objects 
can be in the set. For example, if the TreeSet contains mailing addresses and if the compareTo () 
method for addresses just compares their zip codes, then the set can contain only one address in 
each zip code. Clearly, this is not right! But that only means that you have to be aware of the 
semantics of TreeSets, and you need to make sure that compareToO is defined in a reasonable 
way for objects that you put into a TreeSet. This will be true, by the way, for Strings, Integers, 
and many other built-in types, since the compareToO method for these types considers two 
objects to be the same only if they are actually equal. 

In the implementation of a TreeSet, the elements are stored in something similar to a binary 
sort tree. (See Subsection 9.4.2.) However, the data structure that is used is balanced in the 
sense that all the leaves of the tree are at about the same distance from the root of the tree. 
This ensures that all the basic operations — inserting, deleting, and searching — are efficient, with 
worst-case run time 0(log(n)), where n is the number of items in the set. 

The fact that a TreeSet sorts its elements and removes duplicates makes it very useful in 
some applications. Exercise 7.6 asked you to write a program that would read a file and output 
an alphabetical list of all the words that occurred in the file, with duplicates removed. The 
words were to be stored in an ArrayList, so it was up to you to make sure that the list was 
sorted and contained no duplicates. The same task can be programmed much more easily 
using a TreeSet instead of a list. A TreeSet automatically eliminates duplicates, and an iterator 
for the set will automatically visit the items in the set in sorted order. An algorithm for the 
program, using a TreeSet, would be: 

TreeSet<String> words = new TreeSet<String>() ; 

while there is more data in the input file: 
Let word = the next word from the file 
Convert word to lower case 

words . add (word) // Adds the word only if not already present. 

for ( String w : words ) // for each String w in words 
Output w 

If you would like to see a complete, working program, you can find it in the file 
WordListWithTreeSet.java. 

As another example, suppose that coll is any Collection of Strings. (This would also 
work for any other type for which compareToO is properly defined.) We can use a TreeSet to 
sort the items of coll and remove the duplicates simply by saying: 

TreeSet<String> set = new TreeSet<String> () ; 
set . addAll(coll) ; 

The second statement adds all the elements of the collection to the set. Since it's a Set, 
duplicates are ignored. Since it's a TreeSet, the elements of the set are sorted. If you would like 
to have the data in some other type of data structure, it's easy to copy the data from the set. 
For example, to place the answer in an ArrayList, you could say: 

TreeSet<String> set = new TreeSet<String> () ; 
set . addAll(coll) ; 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



490 



ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String> () ; 
list .addAll (set) ; 

Now, in fact, every one of Java's collection classes has a constructor that takes a Collection 
as an argument. All the items in that Collection are added to the new collection when it is 
created. So, if coll is of type Collection<String>, then "new TreeSet<String> (coll)" creates 
a TreeSet that contains the same elements as coll, but with duplicates removed and in sorted 
order. This means that we can abbreviate the four lines in the above example to the single 
command: 

ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String> ( new TreeSet<String>(coll) ); 

This makes a sorted list of the elements of coll with no duplicates. Although the repeated 
type parameter, "<String>", makes it a bit ugly to look at, this is still a nice example of the 
power of generic programming. (It seems, by the way, there is no equally easy way to get a 
sorted list with duplicates. To do this, we would need something like a TreeSet that allows 
duplicates. The C++ programming language has such a thing and refers to it as a multiset. 
The Smalltalk language has something similar and calls it a bag. Java, for the time being at 
least, lacks this data type.) 

* * * 

A HashSet stores its elements in a hash table, a type of data structure that I will discuss 
in the next section. The operations of finding, adding, and removing elements are implemented 
very efficiently in hash tables, even more so than for TreeSets. The elements of a HashSet are 
not stored in any particular order, and so do not need to implement the Comparable interface. 
(They do, however, need to define a proper "hash code," as we'll see in the next section.) 

The equals () method is used to determine whether two objects in a HashSet are to be 
considered the same. An Iterator for a HashSet will visit its elements in what seems to be a 
completely arbitrary order, and it's possible for the order to change completely when a new 
element is added. Use a HashSet instead of a TreeSet when the elements it contains are not 
comparable, or when the order is not important, or when the small advantage in efficiency is 
important. 

* * * 

A note about the mathematics of sets: In mathematical set theory, the items in a set are 
called members or elements of that set. Important operations include adding an element 
to a set, removing an element from a set, and testing whether a given entity is an element of 
a set. Operations that can be performed on two sets include union, intersection, and set 
difference. All these operations are defined in Java for objects of type Set, but with different 
names. Suppose that A and B are Sets. Then: 

• A.add(x) adds the element x to the set A. 

• A. remove (x) removes the element x from the set A. 

• A. contains (x) tests whether x is an element of the set A. 

• A. addAll (B) computes the union of A and B. 

• A . retainAll (B) computes the intersection of A and B. 

• A . removeAll (B) computes the set difference, A - B. 

There are of course, differences between mathematical sets and sets in Java. Most important, 
perhaps, sets in Java must be finite, while in mathematics, most of the fun in set theory comes 
from working with infinity. In mathematics, a set can contain arbitrary elements, while in Java, 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



491 



a set of type Set<T> can only contain elements of type T. The operation A.addAll(B) acts by 
modifying the value of A, while in mathematics the operation A union B computes a new set, 
without changing the value of A or B. See Exercise 10.2 for an example of mathematical set 
operations in Java. 

10.2.4 EnumSet 

Enumerated types (or "enums") were introduced in Subsection 2.3.3. Suppose that E is an 
enumerated type. Since E is a class, it is possible to create objects of type TreeSet<E> and Hash- 
Set<E>. However, because enums are so simple, trees and hash tables are not the most efficient 
implementation for sets of enumerated type values. Java provides the class j ava . util . EnumSet 
as an alternative way to create such sets. 

Sets of enumerated type values are created using static methods in the class EnumSet. For 
example, if el, e2, and e3 are values belonging to the enumerated type E, then the method 

EnumSet . of ( el, e2, e3 ) 

creates and returns a set of type EnumSet<E> that contains exactly the elements el, e2, and 
e3. The set implements the interface Set<E>, so all the usual set and collection operations are 
available. The implementation of these operations is very efficient. The implementation uses 
what is called a bit vector. A bit is a quantity that has only two possible values, zero and one. 
A set of type EnumSet<E> is represented by a bit vector that contains one bit for each enum 
constant in the enumerated type E; the bit corresponding to the enum constant e is 1 if e is 
a member of the set and is if e is not a member of the set. The bit vectors for two sets of 
type EnumSet<E> can be very easily combined to represent such operations as the union and 
intersection of two sets. The bit vector representation is feasible for EnumSets, but not for 
other sets in Java, because an enumerated type contains only a small finite number of enum 
constants. (Java actually has a class named BitSet that uses bit vectors to represent finite sets 
of non- negative integers, but this class is not part of the Java Collection Framework and does 
not implement the Set interface.) 

The function EnumSet . of can be used with any positive number of parameters. All the 
parameters must be values of the same enumerated type. Null values are not allowed. An 
EnumSet cannot contain the value null — any attempt to add null to an EnumSet will result 
in a NullPointerException. 

There is also a function EnumSet .range (el , e2) that returns an EnumSet consisting of the 
enum constants between el and e2, inclusive. The ordering of enum constants is the same as 
the order in which they are listed in the definition of the enum. In EnumSet . range (el , e2) , el 
and e2 must belong to the same enumerated type, and el must be less than or equal to e2. 

If E is an enum, then EnumSet . allOf (E. class) is a set that contains all values of type 
E. EnumSet .noneOf (E. class) is an empty set, a set of type EnumSet<E> that contains no 
elements at all. Note that in EnumSet . allOf (E. class) and EnumSet .noneOf (E. class) , the 
odd-looking parameter represents the enumerated type class itself. If eset is a set of type 
EnumSet<E>, then EnumSet . complementOf (eset) is a set that contains all the enum constants 
of E that are not in eset. 

As an example, consider a program that keeps schedules of events. The program must 
keep track of repeating events that happen on specified days of the week. For example, an 
event might take place only on weekdays, or only on Wednesdays and Fridays. In other words, 
associated with the event is the set of days of the week on which it takes place. This information 
can be represented using the enumerated type 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



492 



emim Day { SUNDAY, MONDAY , TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY } 

The days of the week on which an event takes place would then be a value of type EnumSet<Day>. 
An object of type RepeatingEvent would have an instance variable of type EnumSet<Day> to 
hold this information. An event that takes place on Wednesdays and Fridays would have the 
associated set 

EnumSet. of ( Day . WEDNESDAY , Day. FRIDAY ) 
We could define some common sets of Days as 

EmimSet<Day> weekday = EnumSet . range ( Day. MONDAY, Day. FRIDAY ); 
EmimSet<Day> weekend = EnumSet . complementOf ( weekday ); 
EmimSet<Day> everyday = EnumSet . allOf ( Day . class ) ; 

EnumSets are often used to specify sets of "options" that are to be applied during some type 
of processing. For example, a program that draws characters in fancy fonts might have various 
options that can be applied. Let's say that the options are bold, italic, underlined, strikethrough, 
and boxed. Note that we are assuming that options can be combined in arbitrary ways. For 
example, you can have italic, boxed, underlined characters. This just means that we need to 
keep track of a set of options. If the options are represented by the enumerated type 

enum FontOption { BOLD, ITALIC, UNDERLINED, STRIKETHROUGH, BOXED } 

then a set of options is represented by a value of type EnumSet<FontOption>. Suppose that 
options is a variable of this type that represents the set of options that are currently being 
applied by the program. Then we can do things like: 

• options = EnumSet . noneOf ( FontOption. class ) — Turn off all options. 

• options = EnumSet. of ( FontOption. BOLD ) — Use bold, with no other options. 

• options. add( FontOption. BOLD ) — Add bold to any options that are already on. 

• options. remove ( FontOption. UNDERLINED ) — Turn underlining off (if it's on). 

This is a nice, safe way to work with sets of options. Applications like this are one of the major 
reasons that enumerated types were introduced. 

10.3 Maps 

An array of N elements can be thought of as a way of associating some item with each of (online) 
the integers 0, 1, ... , N-l. If i is one of these integers, it's possible to get the item associated 
with i, and it's possible to put a new item in the i-th position. These "get" and "put" 
operations define what it means to be an array. 

A map is a kind of generalized array. Like an array, a map is defined by "get" and "put" 
operations. But in a map, these operations are defined not for integers 0, 1, . . . , N-l, but for 
arbitrary objects of some specified type T. Associated to these objects of type T are objects of 
some possibly different type S. 

In fact, some programming languages use the term associative array instead of "map" 
and use the same notation for associative arrays as for regular arrays. In those languages, 
for example, you might see the notation A["fred"] used to indicate the item associated to the 
string "fred" in the associative array A. Java does not use array notation for maps, unfortunately, 
but the idea is the same: A map is like an array, but the indices for a map are objects, not 
integers. In a map, an object that serves as an "index" is called a key. The object that is 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



493 



associated with a key is called a value. Note that a key can have at most one associated value, 
but the same value can be associated to several different keys. A map can be considered to be 
a set of "associations," where each association is a key/value pair. 

10.3.1 The Map Interface 

In Java, maps are defined by the interface java.util .Map, which includes put and get methods 
as well as other general methods for working with maps. The map interface, Map<K,V>, is 
parameterized by two types. The first type parameter, K, specifies the type of objects that are 
possible keys in the map; the second type parameter, V, specifies the type of objects that are 
possible values in the map. For example, a map of type Map<Date,JButton> would associate 
values of type JButton to keys of type Date. For a map of type Map<String,String>, both the 
keys and the values are of type String. 

Suppose that map is a variable of type Map<K,V> for some specific types K and V. Then the 
following are some of the methods that are defined for map: 

• map. get (key) — returns the object of type V that is associated by the map to the key. 
key can be any object; it does not have to be of type K. If the map does not associate 
any value with key, then the return value is null. Note that it's also possible for the 
return value to be null when the map explicitly associates the value null with the key. 
Referring to "map . get (key) " is similar to referring to "A [key] " for an array A. (But note 
that there is nothing like an IndexOutOfBoundsException for maps.) 

• map. put (key, value) — Associates the specified value with the specified key, where key 
must be of type K and value must be of type V. If the map already associated some 
other value with the key, then the new value replaces the old one. This is similar to the 
command "A [key] = value" for an array. 

• map.putAll(map2) — if map2 is another map of type Map<K,V>, this copies all the asso- 
ciations from map2 into map. 

• map . remove (key) — if map associates a value to the specified key, that association is 
removed from the map. key can be any object; it does not have to be of type K. 

• map . containsKey (key) — returns a boolean value that is true if the map associates some 
value to the specified key. key can be any object; it does not have to be of type K. 

• map . containsValue (value) — returns a boolean value that is true if the map associates 
the specified value to some key. value can be any object; it does not have to be of type V. 

• map . size () — returns an int that gives the number of key/value associations in the map. 

• map. isEmptyO — returns a boolean value that is true if the map is empty, that is if it 
contains no associations. 

• map. clear () — removes all associations from the map, leaving it empty. 

The put and get methods are certainly the most commonly used of the methods in the Map 
interface. In many applications, these are the only methods that are needed, and in such cases 
a map is really no more difficult to use than a standard array. 

Java includes two classes that implement the interface Map<K,V>: TreeMap<K,V> and 
HashMap<K,V>. In a TreeMap, the key/value associations are stored in a sorted tree, in which 
they are sorted according to their keys. For this to work, it must be possible to compare the 
keys to one another. This means either that the keys must implement the interface Compara- 
ble<K>, or that a Comparator must be provided for comparing keys. (The Comparator can be 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



494 



provided as a parameter to the TreeMap constructor.) Note that in a TreeMap, as in a TreeSet, 
the compareToQ method is used to decide whether two keys are to be considered the same. 
This can have undesirable consequences if the compareToO method does not agree with the 
usual notion of equality, and you should keep this in mind when using TreeMaps. 

A HashMap does not store associations in any particular order, so the keys that can be used 
in a HashMap do not have to be comparable. However, the key class should have reasonable 
definitions for the equals () method and for a hashCodeQ method that is discussed later in 
this section; most of Java's standard classes define these methods correctly. Most operations are 
a little faster on HashMaps than they are on TreeMaps. In general, you should use a HashMap 
unless you have some particular need for the ordering property of a TreeMap. In particular, if 
you are only using the put and get operations, you can safely use a HashMap. 

Let's consider an example where maps would be useful. In Subsection 7.4.2, I presented 
a simple PhoneDirectory class that associated phone numbers with names. That class defined 
operations addEntry (name, number) and getNumber (name) , where both name and number are 
given as Strings. In fact, the phone directory is acting just like a map, with the addEntry 
method playing the role of the put operation and getNumber playing the role of get. In a real 
programming application, there would be no need to define a new class; we could simply use a 
map of type Map<String,String> . A directory would be defined as 

Map<String,String> directory = new Map<String,String>() ; 

and then directory, put (name, number) would record a phone number in the directory and 
directory . get (name) would retrieve the phone number associated with a given name. 

10.3.2 Views, SubSets, and SubMaps 

A Map is not a Collection, and maps do not implement all the operations defined on collections. 
In particular, there are no iterators for maps. Sometimes, though, it's useful to be able to 
iterate through all the associations in a map. Java makes this possible in a roundabout but 
clever way. If map is a variable of type Map<K,V>, then the method 

map.keySetO 

returns the set of all objects that occur as keys for associations in the map. The value returned 
by this method is an object that implements the interface Set<K>. The elements of this set 
are the map's keys. The obvious way to implement the keySetO method would be to create 
a new set object, add all the keys from the map, and return that set. But that's not how it's 
done. The value returned by map.keySetO is not an independent object. It is what is called a 
view of the actual objects that are stored in the map. This "view" of the map implements the 
Set<K> interface, but it does it in such a way that the methods defined in the interface refer 
directly to keys in the map. For example, if you remove a key from the view, that key — along 
with its associated value — is actually removed from the map. It's not legal to add an object 
to the view, since it doesn't make sense to add a key to a map without specifying the value 
that should be associated to the key. Since map.keySetO does not create a new set, it's very 
efficient, even for very large maps. 

One of the things that you can do with a Set is get an Iterator for it and use the iterator 
to visit each of the elements of the set in turn. We can use an iterator (or a for-each loop) for 
the key set of a map to traverse the map. For example, if map is of type Map<String,Double>, 
we could write: 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



495 



Set<String> keys = map.keySetO ; // The set of keys in the map. 

Iterator<String> keylter = keys . iterator () ; 

System. out .printlnC'The map contains the following associations:"); 
while (keylter.hasNextO) { 

String key = keylter .next () ; // Get the next key. 

Double value = map . get (key) ; // Get the value for that key. 

System. out .print In ( " (" + key + "," + value + ")" ); 

} 

Or we could do the same thing more easily, avoiding the explicit use of an iterator, with a 
for-each loop: 

System. out .printlnC'The map contains the following associations:"); 
for ( String key : map.keySetO ) { // "for each key in the map's key set" 
Double value = map. get (key) ; 

System. out. println( " (" + key + "," + value + ")" ); 

} 

If the map is a TreeMap, then the key set of the map is a sorted set, and the iterator will visit 
the keys in ascending order. For a HashMap, the keys are visited in an arbitrary, unpredictable 
order. 

The Map interface defines two other views. If map is a variable of type Map<K,V>, then the 
method: 

map. values () 

returns an object of type Collection<V> that contains all the values from the associations that 
are stored in the map. The return value is a Collection rather than a Set because it can contain 
duplicate elements (since a map can associate the same value to any number of keys). The 
method: 

map . entrySet () 

returns a set that contains all the associations from the map. The elements in the set are 
objects of type Map.Entry<K,V>. Map.Entry<K,V> is defined as a static nested interface inside 
the interface Map<K,V>, so its full name contains a period. However, the name can be used 
in the same way as any other type name. (The return type of the method map. entrySet () 
is written as Set<Map.Entry<K,V». The type parameter in this case is itself a parameterized 
type. Although this might look confusing, it's just Java's way of saying that the elements of the 
set are of type Map.Entry<K,V>.) The information in the set returned by map . entrySet () is 
actually no different from the information in the map itself, but the set provides a different view 
of this information, with different operations. Each Map. Entry object contains one key/value 
pair, and defines methods getKey () and get Value () for retrieving the key and the value. There 
is also a method, set Value (value) , for setting the value; calling this method for a Map. Entry 
object will modify the map itself, just as if the map's put method were called. As an example, 
we can use the entry set of a map to print all the key /value pairs in the map. This is more 
efficient than using the key set to print the same information, as I did in the above example, 
since we don't have to use the get() method to look up the value associated with each key. 
Suppose again that map is of type Map<String,Double>. Then we can write: 

Set<Map.Entry<String,Double>> entries = map . entrySet () ; 
Iterator<Map . Entry<String,Double>> entrylter = entries . iterator () ; 
System. out .printlnC'The map contains the following associations:"); 
while (entrylter .hasNextO ) { 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



496 



Map.Entry<String,Double> entry = entrylter .nextO ; 
String key = entry. getKey () ; // Get the key from the entry. 
Double value = entry . getValue () ; // Get the value. 
System. out .println( " (" + key + "," + value + ")" ); 

} 

or, using a for-each loop: 

System. out .printlnC'The map contains the following associations:"); 
for ( Map.Entry<String,Double> entry : map . entrySet () ) 

System. out. println( " (" + entry . getKey () + "," + entry. getValue () + ")" ); 

* * * 

Maps are not the only place in Java's generic programming framework where views are 
used. For example, the interface List<T> defines a sublist as a view of a part of a list. If list 
implements the interface List<T>, then the method: 

list . subList ( fromlndex, tolndex ) 

where fromlndex and tolndex are integers, returns a view of the part of the list consisting 
of the list elements in positions between fromlndex and tolndex (including fromlndex but 
excluding tolndex). This view lets you operate on the sublist using any of the operations 
defined for lists, but the sublist is not an independent list. Changes made to the sublist are 
actually made to the original list. 

Similarly, it is possible to obtain views that represent certain subsets of a sorted set. If 
set is of type TreeSet<T>, then set . subSet (f romElement ,toElement) returns a Set<T> that 
contains all the elements of set that are between fromElement and toElement (including 
f romElement and excluding toElement). The parameters fromElement and toElement must 
be objects of type T. For example, if words is a set of type TreeSet<String> in which all the 
elements are strings of lower case letters, then words . subSet ("m" , "n") contains all the ele- 
ments of words that begin with the letter 'm'. This subset is a view of part of the original 
set. That is, creating the subset does not involve copying elements. And changes made to 
the subset, such as adding or removing elements, are actually made to the original set. The 
view set . headSet (toElement) consists of all elements from the set which are strictly less than 
toElement, and set .tailSet (fromElement) is a view that contains all elements from the set 
that are greater than or equal to fromElement. 

The class TreeMap<K,V> defines three submap views. A submap is similar to a subset. 
A submap is a Map that contains a subset of the keys from the original Map, along with 
their associated values. If map is a variable of type TreeMap<K,V>, and if fromKey and toKey 
are of type T, then map.subMap(fromKey,toKey) returns a view that contains all key/value 
pairs from map whose keys are between fromKey and toKey (including fromKey and excluding 
toKey). There are also views map.headMap(toKey) and map. tailMap (fromKey) which are 
defined analogously to headSet and tailSet. Suppose, for example, that blackBook is a map 
of type TreeMap<String,String> in which the keys are names and the values are phone numbers. 
We can print out all the entries from blackBook where the name begins with "M" as follows: 

Map<String,String> ems = blackBook. subMapO'M" , "N") ; 

// This submap contains entries for which the key is greater 
// than or equal to "M" and strictly less than "N" . 

if (ems . isEmpty () ) { 

System. out .println( "No entries beginning with M."); 

} 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



497 



else { 

System. out .println( "Entries beginning with M:"); 

for ( Map.Entry<String,String> entry : ems . entrySet () ) 

System. out .println( " " + entry. getKeyO + ": " + entry. getValueO ); 

} 

Subsets and submaps are probably best thought of as generalized search operations that 
make it possible to find all the items in a range of values, rather than just to find a single 
value. Suppose, for example that a database of scheduled events is stored in a map of type 
TreeMap<Date,Event> in which the keys are the times of the events, and suppose you want a 
listing of all events that are scheduled for some time on July 4, 2011. Just make a submap 
containing all keys in the range from 12:00 AM, July 4, 2011 to 12:00 AM, July 5, 2011, and 
output all the entries from that submap. This type of search, which is known as a subrange 
query is quite common. 

10.3.3 Hash Tables and Hash Codes 

HashSets and Hash Maps are implemented using a data structure known as a hash table. 
You don't need to understand hash tables to use HashSets or HashMaps, but any computer 
programmer should be familiar with hash tables and how they work. 

Hash tables are an elegant solution to the search problem. A hash table, like a HashMap, 
stores key/value pairs. Given a key, you have to search the table for the corresponding key/value 
pair. When a hash table is used to implement a set, the values are all null, and the only question 
is whether or not the key occurs in the set. You still have to search for the key to check whether 
it is there or not. 

In most search algorithms, in order to find the item you are interested in, you have to look 
through a bunch of other items that don't interest you. To find something in an unsorted list, 
you have to go though the items one-by-one until you come to the one you are looking for. In 
a binary sort tree, you have to start at the root and move down the tree until you find the 
item you want. When you search for a key /value pair in a hash table, you can go directly to 
the location that contains the item you want. You don't have to look through any other items. 
(This is not quite true, but it's close.) The location of the key/value pair is computed from the 
key: You just look at the key, and then you go directly to the location where it is stored. 

How can this work? If the keys were integers in the range to 99, we could store the 
key/value pairs in an array, A, of 100 elements. The key/value pair with key K would be stored 
in A[K] . The key takes us directly to the location of the key/value pair. The problem is that 
there are usually far too many different possible keys for us to be able to use an array with 
one location for each possible key. For example, if the key can be any value of type int, then 
we would need an array with over four billion locations — quite a waste of space if we are only 
going to store, say, a few thousand items! If the key can be a string of any length, then the 
number of possible keys is infinite, and using an array with one location for each possible key 
is simply impossible. 

Nevertheless, hash tables store their data in an array, and the array index where a key is 
stored is based on the key. The index is not equal to the key, but it is computed from the key. 
The array index for a key is called the hash code for that key. A function that computes a 
hash code, given a key, is called a hash function. To find a key in a hash table, you just have 
to compute the hash code of the key and go directly to the array location given by that hash 
code. If the hash code is 17, look in array location number 17. 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



498 



Now, since there are fewer array locations than there are possible keys, it's possible that 
we might try to store two or more keys in the same array location. This is called a collision. 
A collision is not an error. We can't reject a key just because another key happened to have 
the same hash code. A hash table must be able to handle collisions in some reasonable way. In 
the type of hash table that is used in Java, each array location actually holds a linked list of 
key/value pairs (possibly an empty list). When two items have the same hash code, they are 
in the same linked list. The structure of the hash table looks something like this: 



> item 



9 
10 
11 
• 



item 




item 





> item 



item 






item 







item 



-> item 



In this diagram, there is one item with hash code 0, no items with hash code 1, two items with 
hash code 2, and so on. In a properly designed hash table, most of the linked lists are of length 
zero or one, and the average length of the lists is less than one. Although the hash code of a key 
doesn't necessarily take you directly to that key, there are probably no more than one or two 
other items that you have to look through before finding the key you want. For this to work 
properly, the number of items in the hash table should be somewhat less than the number of 
locations in the array. In Java's implementation, whenever the number of items exceeds 75% 
of the array size, the array is replaced by a larger one and all the items in the old array are 
inserted into the new one. (This is why adding one new item will sometimes cause the ordering 
of all the items in the hash table to change completely.) 

There is still the question of where hash codes come from. Every object in Java has a 
hash code. The Object class defines the method hashCode ( ) , which returns a value of type 
int. When an object, obj, is stored in a hash table that has N locations, a hash code in the 
range to N-l is needed. This hash code is computed as Math. abs( obj .hashCode ()) °/ N, 
the remainder when the absolute value of obj .hashCode () is divided by N. (The Math.abs 
is necessary because obj . hashCode () can be a negative integer, and we need a non- negative 
number to use as an array index.) 

For hashing to work properly, two objects that are equal according to the equals () method 
must have the same hash code. In the Object class, this condition is satisfied because both 
equals () and hashCode () are based on the address of the memory location where the object 
is stored. However, as noted in Subsection 10.1.6, many classes redefine the equals () method. 
If a class redefines the equals () method, and if objects of that class will be used as keys in 
hash tables, then the class should also redefine the hashCode () method. For example, in the 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



499 



String class, the equals () method is redefined so that two objects of type String are considered 
to be equal if they contain the same sequence of characters. The hashCodeO method is also 
redefined in the String class, so that the hash code of a string is computed from the characters 
in that string rather than from its location in memory. For Java's standard classes, you can 
expect equals () and hashCodeO to be correctly defined. However, you might need to define 
these methods in classes that you write yourself. 

Writing a good hash function is something of an art. In order to work well, the hash function 
must spread the possible keys fairly evenly over the hash table. Otherwise, the items in a table 
can be concentrated in a subset of the available locations, and the linked lists at those locations 
can grow to large size; that would destroy the efficiency that is the major reason for hash tables 
to exist in the first place. However, I won't cover techniques for creating good hash functions 
in this book. 

10.4 Programming with the Java Collection Framework 

In THIS SECTION, we'll look at some programming examples that use classes from the Java (online) 
Collection Framework. The Collection Framework is easy to use, especially compared to the 
difficulty of programming new data structures from scratch. 

10.4.1 Symbol Tables 

We begin with a straightforward but important application of maps. When a compiler reads 
the source code of a program, it encounters definitions of variables, subroutines, and classes. 
The names of these things can be used later in the program. The compiler has to remember the 
definition of each name, so that it can recognize the name and apply the definition when the 
name is encountered later in the program. This is a natural application for a Map. The name 
can be used as a key in the map. The value associated to the key is the definition of the name, 
encoded somehow as an object. A map that is used in this way is called a symbol table. 

In a compiler, the values in a symbol table can be quite complicated, since the compiler has 
to deal with names for various sorts of things, and it needs a different type of information for 
each different type of name. We will keep things simple by looking at a symbol table in another 
context. Suppose that we want a program that can evaluate expressions entered by the user, 
and suppose that the expressions can contain variables, in addition to operators, numbers, and 
parentheses. For this to make sense, we need some way of assigning values to variables. When 
a variable is used in an expression, we need to retrieve the variable's value. A symbol table can 
be used to store the data that we need. The keys for the symbol table are variable names. The 
value associated with a key is the value of that variable, which is of type double. The symbol 
table will be an object of type Map<String,Double>. (Remember that primitive types such as 
double can't be used as type parameters; a wrapper class such as Double must be used instead. 
See Subsection 10.1.7.) 

To demonstrate the idea, we'll use a rather simple-minded program in which the user types 
commands such as: 

let x = 3 + 12 
print 2 + 2 
print 10*x +17 
let rate =0.06 
print 1000*(l+rate) 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



500 



The program is an interpreter for a very simple language. The only two commands that 
the program understands are "print" and "let". When a "print" command is executed, the 
computer evaluates the expression and displays the value. If the expression contains a variable, 
the computer has to look up the value of that variable in the symbol table. A "let" command 
is used to give a value to a variable. The computer has to store the value of the variable in 
the symbol table. (Note: The "variables" I am talking about here are not variables in the Java 
program. The Java program is executing a sort of program typed in by the user. I am talking 
about variables in the user's program. The user gets to make up variable names, so there is no 
way for the Java program to know in advance what the variables will be.) 

In Subsection 9.5.2, we saw how to write a program, SimpleParser2.java, that can evalu- 
ate expressions that do not contain variables. Here, I will discuss another example program, 
Simplelnterpreter.java, that is based on the older program. I will only talk about the parts 
that are relevant to the symbol table. 

The program uses a HashMap as the symbol table. A TreeMap could also be used, but since 
the program does not need to access the variables in alphabetical order, we don't need to have 
the keys stored in sorted order. The symbol table in the program is represented by a variable 
named symbolTable of type HashMap<String,Double>. At the beginning of the program, the 
symbol table object is created with the command: 

symbolTable = new HashMap<String,Double> () ; 

This creates a map that initially contains no key /value associations. To execute a "let" com- 
mand, the program uses the symbol table's put () method to associate a value with the variable 
name. Suppose that the name of the variable is given by a String, varName, and the value of 
the variable is stored in a variable val of type double. The following command would then set 
the value associated with the variable in the symbol table: 

symbolTable . put ( varName , val ) ; 

In the program Simplelnterpreter.java, you'll find this in the method named doLetCommandO . 
The actual value that is stored in the symbol table is an object of type Double. We can use the 
double value val in the call to put because Java does an automatic conversion of type double 
to Double when necessary. The double value is "wrapped" in an object of type Double, so that, 
in effect, the above statement is equivalent to 

symbolTable . put ( varName, new Double(val) ); 

Just for fun, I decided to pre-define two variables named "pi" and "e" whose values are the 
usual mathematical constants ir and e. In Java, the values of these constants are given by 
Math. PI and Math.E. To make these variables available to the user of the program, they are 
added to the symbol table with the commands: 

symbolTable . put ( "pi", Math. PI ); 
symbolTable . put ( "e", Math.E ); 

When the program encounters a variable while evaluating an expression, the symbol table's 
get() method is used to retrieve its value. The function symbolTable. get (varName) returns 
a value of type Double. It is possible that the return value is null; this will happen if no value 
has ever been assigned to varName in the symbol table. It's important to check this possibility. 
It indicates that the user is trying to use a variable that the user has not defined. The program 
considers this to be an error, so the processing looks something like this: 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



501 



Double val = symbolTable . get (varName) ; 
if (val == null) { 

... // Throw an exception: Undefined variable. 

} 

// The value associated to varName is val . doubleValue () 

You will find this code, more or less, in a method named primary Value () in 
Simplelnterpreter.java. 

As you can see from this example, Maps are very useful and are really quite easy to use. 

10.4.2 Sets Inside a Map 

The objects in a collection or map can be of any type. They can even be collections. Here's an 
example where it's natural to store sets as the value objects in a map. 

Consider the problem of making an index for a book. An index consists of a list of terms 
that appear in the book. Next to each term is a list of the pages on which that term appears. 
To represent an index in a program, we need a data structure that can hold a list of terms, 
along with a list of pages for each term. Adding new data should be easy and efficient. When 
it's time to print the index, it should be easy to access the terms in alphabetical order. There 
are many ways this could be done, but I'd like to use Java's generic data structures and let 
them do as much of the work as possible. 

We can think of an index as a Map that associates a list of page references to each term. 
The terms are keys, and the value associated with a given key is the list of page references for 
that term. A Map can be either a TreeMap or a HashMap, but only a TreeMap will make it 
easy to access the terms in sorted order. The value associated with a term is a list of page 
references. How can we represent such a value? If you think about it, you see that it's not 
really a list in the sense of Java's generic classes. If you look in any index, you'll see that a 
list of page references has no duplicates, so it's really a set rather than a list. Furthermore, 
the page references for a given term are always printed in increasing order, so we want a sorted 
set. This means that we should use a TreeSet to represent each list of page references. The 
values that we really want to put in this set are of type int, but once again we have to deal 
with the fact that generic data structures can only hold objects, so we must use the wrapper 
class, Integer, for the objects in the set. 

To summarize, an index will be represented by a TreeMap. The keys for the map will be 
terms, which are of type String. The values in the map will be TreeSets that contain Integers 
that are the page numbers of every page on which a term appears. The parameterized type 
that we should use for the sets is TreeSet<lnteger>. For the TreeMap that represents the index 
as a whole, the key type is String and the value type is TreeSet<lnteger>. This means that the 
index has type 

TreeMap< String, TreeSet<Integer> > 

This is just the usual TreeMap<K,V> with K=String and V=TreeSet<Integer>. A type name 
as complicated as this one can look intimidating (especially, I think, when used in a constructor 
with the new operator), but if you think about the data structure that we want to represent, it 
makes sense. Given a little time and practice, you can get used to types like this one. 

To make an index, we need to start with an empty TreeMap and look through the book, 
inserting every reference that we want to be in the index into the map. We then need to print 
out the data from the map. Let's leave aside the question of how we find the references to put 
in the index, and just look at how the TreeMap is used. It can be created with the commands: 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



502 



TreeMap<String,TreeSet<Integer>> index; // Declare the variable, 

index = new TreeMap<String,TreeSet<Integer»() ; // Create the map object. 

Now, suppose that we find a reference to some term (of type String) on some pageNum (of 
type int). We need to insert this information into the index. To do this, we should look up the 
term in the index, using index . get (term) . The return value is either null or is the set of page 
references that we have previously found for the term. If the return value is null, then this is 
the first page reference for the term, so we should add the term to the index, with a new set 
that contains the page reference we've just found. If the return value is non-null, we already 
have a set of page references, and we should just add the new page reference to the set. Here 
is a subroutine that does this: 

/** 

* Add a page reference to the index. 
*/ 

void addReference (String term, int pageNum) { 

TreeSet<Integer> references; // The set of page references that we 

// have so far for the term. 

references = index . get (term) ; 
if (references == null){ 

// This is the first reference that we have 

// found for the term. Make a new set containing 

// the page number and add it to the index, with 

// the term as the key. 
TreeSet<Integer> firstRef = new TreeSet<Integer> () ; 

f irstRef . add( pageNum ); // pageNum is "autoboxed" to give an Integer! 
index. put (term, firstRef) ; 

} 

else { 

// references is the set of page references 
// that we have found previously for the term. 
// Add the new page number to that set. This 
// set is already associated to term in the index, 
references . add( pageNum ); // pageNum is "autoboxed" to give an Integer! 

} 

} 

The only other thing we need to do with the index is print it out. We want to iterate 
through the index and print out each term, together with the set of page references for that 
term. We could use an Iterator to iterate through the index, but it's much easier to do it with 
a for-each loop. The loop will iterate through the entry set of the map (see Subsection 10.3.2). 
Each "entry" is a key/value pair from the map; the key is a term and the value is the associated 
set of page references. Inside the for-each loop, we will have to print out a set of Integers, which 
can also be done with a for-each loop. So, here we have an example of nested for-each loops. 
(You might try to do the same thing entirely with iterators; doing so should give you some 
appreciation for the for-each loop!) Here is a subroutine that will print the index: 

/** 

* Print each entry in the index. 
*/ 

void printlndexO { 

for ( Map.Entry<String,TreeSet<Integer>> entry : index. entrySetO ) { 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



503 



String term = entry . getKeyO ; 
TreeSet<Integer> pageSet = entry. get Value () ; 

System. out .print ( term + " " ); 
for ( int page : pageSet ) { 

System. out .print ( page + " " ); 

} 

System. out .printlnO ; 

} 

} 

The hardest thing here is the name of the type Map.Entry<String,TreeSet<Integer>>! Re- 
member that the entries in a map of type Map<K,V> have type Map.Entry<K,V>, so the type 
parameters in Map.Entry<String,TreeSet<Integer» are simply copied from the declaration 
of index. Another thing to note is that I used a loop control variable, page, of type int to 
iterate through the elements of pageSet, which is of type TreeSet<lnteger>. You might have 
expected page to be of type Integer, not int, and in fact Integer would have worked just as well 
here. However, int does work, because of automatic type conversion: it's legal to assign a value 
of type Integer to a variable of type int. (To be honest, I was sort of surprised that this worked 
when I first tried it!) 

This is not a lot of code, considering the complexity of the operations. I have not written 
a complete indexing program, but Exercise 10.5 presents a problem that is almost identical to 
the indexing problem. 

* * * 

By the way, in this example, I would prefer to print each list of page references with the 
integers separated by commas. In the print Index () method given above, they are separated 
by spaces. There is an extra space after the last page reference in the list, but it does no harm 
since it's invisible in the printout. An extra comma at the end of the list would be annoying. 
The lists should be in a form such as "17 , 42 , 105" and not "17 , 42 , 105 , " . The problem is, how 
to leave that last comma out. Unfortunately, this is not so easy to do with a for-each loop. It 
might be fun to look at a few ways to solve this problem. One alternative is to use an iterator: 

Iterator<Integer> iter = pageSet . iterator () ; 

int firstPage = iter.nextO; // In this program, we know the set has at least 

// one element. Note also that this statement 
// uses an auto-conversion from Integer to int. 

System. out. print (firstPage) ; 
while ( iter .hasNextO ) { 

int nextPage = iter.nextO; 

System. out .print (", " + nextPage); 

} 

Another possibility is to use the fact that the TreeSet class defines a method first () that 
returns the first item in the set, that is, the one that is smallest in terms of the ordering that 
is used to compare items in the set. (It also defines the method lastQ.) We can solve our 
problem using this method and a for-each loop: 

int firstPage = pageSet . first () ; // Find out the first page number in the set. 
for ( int page : pageSet ) { 
if ( page != firstPage ) 

System. out.pr int (",") ; // Output comma only if this is not the first page. 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



504 



System. out .print (page) ; 

} 

Finally, here is an elegant solution using a subset view of the tree. (See Subsection 10.3.2.) 
Actually, this solution might be a bit extreme: 

int firstPage = pageSet . first () ; // Get first item, which we know exists. 
System. out. print (f irstPage) ; // Print first item, with no comma, 

for ( int page : pageSet .tailSet ( firstPage+l ) ) // Process remaining items. 
System. out .print ( "," + page ); 

10.4.3 Using a Comparator 

There is a potential problem with our solution to the indexing problem. If the terms in the index 
can contain both upper case and lower case letters, then the terms will not be in alphabetical 
order! The ordering on String is not alphabetical. It is based on the Unicode codes of the 
characters in the string. The codes for all the upper case letters are less than the codes for 
the lower case letters. So, for example, terms beginning with "Z" come before terms beginning 
with "a" . If the terms are restricted to use lower case letters only (or upper case only) , then 
the ordering would be alphabetical. But suppose that we allow both upper and lower case, and 
that we insist on alphabetical order. In that case, our index can't use the usual ordering for 
Strings. Fortunately, it's possible to specify a different method to be used for comparing the 
keys of a map. This is a typical use for a Comparator. 

Recall that an object that implements the interface Comparator<T> defines a method for 
comparing two objects of type T: 

public int compare ( T objl, T obj2 ) 

This method should return an integer that is positive, zero, or negative, depending on whether 
obj 1 is less than, equal to, or greater than obj2. We need an object of type Comparator<String> 
that will compare two Strings based on alphabetical order. The easiest way to do this is to 
convert the Strings to lower case and use the default comparison on the lower case Strings. The 
following class defines such a comparator: 

/** 

* Represents a Comparator that can be used for comparing two 

* strings based on alphabetical order. 
*/ 

class AlphabeticalOrder implements Comparator<String> { 
public int compare (String strl, String str2) -[ 

String si = strl .toLowerCaseO ; // Convert to lower case. 
String s2 = str2.toLowerCase() ; 

return si . compareTo (s2) ; // Compare lower-case Strings. 

} 

} 

To solve our indexing problem, we just need to tell our index to use an object of type 
AlphabeticalOrder for comparing keys. This is done by providing a Comparator object as a 
parameter to the constructor. We just have to create the index in our example with the 
command: 

index = new TreeMap<String,TreeSet<Integer>>( new AlphabeticalOrder () ); 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



505 



This does work. However, I've been concealing one technicality. Suppose, for exam- 
ple, that the indexing program calls addRef erence("aardvark" ,56) and that it later calls 
addRef erence ("Aardvark" , 102) . The words "aardvark" and "Aardvark" differ only in that 
one of them begins with an upper case letter; when converted to lower case, they are the same. 
When we insert them into the index, do they count as two different terms or as one term? The 
answer depends on the way that a TreeMap tests objects for equality. In fact, TreeMaps and 
TreeSets always use a Comparator object or a compareTo method to test for equality. They do 
not use the equals () method for this purpose. The Comparator that is used for the TreeMap in 
this example returns the value zero when it is used to compare "aardvark" and "Aardvark" , so 
the TreeMap considers them to be the same. Page references to "aardvark" and "Aardvark" are 
combined into a single list, and when the index is printed it will contain only the first version 
of the word that was encountered by the program. This is probably acceptable behavior in this 
example. If not, some other technique must be used to sort the terms into alphabetical order. 

10.4.4 Word Counting 

The final example in this section also deals with storing information about words. The problem 
here is to make a list of all the words that occur in a file, along with the number of times that 
each word occurs. The file will be selected by the user. The output of the program will consist 
of two lists. Each list contains all the words from the file, along with the number of times that 
the word occurred. One list is sorted alphabetically, and the other is sorted according to the 
number of occurrences, with the most common words at the top and the least common at the 
bottom. The problem here is a generalization of Exercise 7.6, which asked you to make an 
alphabetical list of all the words in a file, without counting the number of occurrences. 

My word counting program can be found in the file WordCount.java. As the program reads 
an input file, it must keep track of how many times it encounters each word. We could simply 
throw all the words, with duplicates, into a list and count them later. But that would require 
a lot of extra storage space and would not be very efficient. A better method is to keep a 
counter for each word. The first time the word is encountered, the counter is initialized to 1. 
On subsequent encounters, the counter is incremented. To keep track of the data for one word, 
the program uses a simple class that holds a word and the counter for that word. The class is 
a static nested class: 

/** 

* Represents the data we need about a word: the word and 

* the number of times it has been encountered. 
*/ 

private static class WordData { 
String word; 
int count ; 

WordData(String w) { 

// Constructor for creating a WordData object when 
//we encounter a new word, 
word = w; 

count =1; // The initial value of count is 1. 

} 

} // end class WordData 

The program has to store all the WordData objects in some sort of data structure. We want 
to be able to add new words efficiently. Given a word, we need to check whether a WordData 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



506 



object already exists for that word, and if it does, we need to find that object so that we can 
increment its counter. A Map can be used to implement these operations. Given a word, we 
want to look up a WordData object in the Map. This means that the word is the key, and the 
WordData object is the value. (It might seem strange that the key is also one of the instance 
variables in the value object, but in fact this is probably the most common situation: The 
value object contains all the information about some entity, and the key is one of those pieces 
of information; the partial information in the key is used to retrieve the full information in the 
value object.) After reading the file, we want to output the words in alphabetical order, so we 
should use a TreeMap rather than a HashMap. This program converts all words to lower case 
so that the default ordering on Strings will put the words in alphabetical order. The data is 
stored in a variable named words of type TreeMap<String,WordData>. The variable is declared 
and the map object is created with the statement: 

TreeMap<String,WordData> words = new TreeMap<String,WordData> () ; 

When the program reads a word from a file, it calls words . get (word) to find out if that 
word is already in the map. If the return value is null, then this is the first time the word 
has been encountered, so a new WordData object is created and inserted into the map with the 
command words .put (word, new WordData (word) ) . If words . get (word) is not null, then 
its value is the WordData object for this word, and the program only has to increment the 
counter in that object. The program uses a method readNextWordO , which was given in 
Exercise 7.6, to read one word from the file. This method returns null when the end of the file 
is encountered. Here is the complete code segment that reads the file and collects the data: 

String word = readNextWordO ; 
while (word != null) { 

word = word.toLowerCaseO ; // convert word to lower case 
WordData data = words .get (word) ; 
if (data == null) 

words. put( word, new WordData(word) ); 
else 

data. count++; 
word = readNextWordO ; 

} 

After reading the words and printing them out in alphabetical order, the program has to 
sort the words by frequency and print them again. To do the sorting using a generic algorithm, I 
defined a simple Comparator class for comparing two word objects according to their frequency 
counts. The class implements the interface Comparator<WordData>, since it will be used to 
compare two objects of type WordData: 
/** 

* A comparator class for comparing objects of type WordData according to 

* their counts. This is used for sorting the list of words by frequency. 
*/ 

private static class CountCompare implements Comparator<WordData> { 
public int compare (WordData datal, WordData data2) { 
return data2 . count - datal . count ; 

// The return value is positive if datal. count < data2. count. 
// I.E., datal comes after data2 in the ordering if there 
// were FEWER occurrences of datal. word than of data2.word. 
// The words are sorted according to decreasing counts. 

> 

} // end class CountCompare 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



507 



Given this class, we can sort the WordData objects according to frequency by first copying 
them into a list and then using the generic method Collections . sort (list , comparator) . 
The WordData objects that we need are the values in the map, words. Recall that 
words. values () returns a Collection that contains all the values from the map. The con- 
structor for the ArrayList class lets you specify a collection to be copied into the list when it is 
created. So, we can use the following commands to create a list of type ArrayList<WordData> 
containing the word data and then sort that list according to frequency: 

ArrayList<WordData> wordsByFrequency = new ArrayList<WordData>( words . values () ); 
Collections . sort ( wordsByFrequency, new CountCompare ( ) ); 

You should notice that these two lines replace a lot of code! It requires some practice to think 
in terms of generic data structures and algorithms, but the payoff is significant in terms of saved 
time and effort. 

The only remaining problem is to print the data. We have to print the data from all the 
WordData objects twice, first in alphabetical order and then sorted according to frequency 
count. The data is in alphabetical order in the TreeMap, or more precisely, in the values of 
the TreeMap. We can use a for-each loop to print the data in the collection words .values () , 
and the words will appear in alphabetical order. Another for-each loop can be used to print 
the data in the list wordsByFrequency, and the words will be printed in order of decreasing 
frequency. Here is the code that does it: 

TextlO.putlnC'List of words in alphabetical order" 

+ " (with counts in parentheses) :\n") ; 
for ( WordData data : words. values () ) 

Text 10. put In (" " + data. word + " (" + data. count + ")"); 

TextIO .putln("\n\nList of words by frequency of occurrence : \n") ; 
for ( WordData data : wordsByFrequency ) 

TextIO. putln(" " + data. word + " (" + data. count + ")"); 

You can find the complete word-counting program in the file WordCount.java. Note that for 
reading and writing files, it uses the file I/O capabilities of TextlO.java, which were discussed 
in Subsection 2.4.5. 

By the way, if you run the WordCount program on a reasonably large file and take a look 
at the output, it will illustrate something about the Collections . sort () method. The second 
list of words in the output is ordered by frequency, but if you look at a group of words that all 
have the same frequency, you will see that the words in that group are in alphabetical order. 
The method Collections . sort () was applied to sort the words by frequency, but before it was 
applied, the words were already in alphabetical order. When Collections . sort () rearranged 
the words, it did not change the ordering of words that have the same frequency, so they were 
still in alphabetical order within the group of words with that frequency. This is because the 
algorithm used by Collections . sort () is a stable sorting algorithm. A sorting algorithm is 
said to be stable if it satisfies the following condition: When the algorithm is used to sort a list 
according to some property of the items in the list, then the sort does not change the relative 
order of items that have the same value of that property. That is, if item B comes after item A 
in the list before the sort, and if both items have the same value for the property that is being 
used as the basis for sorting, then item B will still come after item A after the sorting has 
been done. Neither SelectionSort nor QuickSort are stable sorting algorithms. Insertion sort is 
stable, but is not very fast. Merge sort, the sorting algorithm used by Collections . sort () , 
is both stable and fast.

I hope that the programming examples in this section have convinced you of the usefulness 
of the Java Collection Framework! 



10.5 Writing Generic Classes and Methods 

So far in this chapter, you have learned about using the generic classes and methods that (online) 

are part of the Java Collection Framework. Now, it's time to learn how to write new generic 

classes and methods from scratch. Generic programming produces highly general and reusable 

code — it's very useful for people who write reusable software libraries to know how to do generic 

programming, since it enables them to write code that can be used in many different situations. 

Not every programmer needs to write reusable software libraries, but every programmer should 

know at least a little about how to do it. In fact, just to read the JavaDoc documentation for 

Java's standard generic classes, you need to know some of the syntax that is introduced in this 

section. 

I will not cover every detail of generic programming in Java in this section, but the material 
presented here should be sufficient to cover the most common cases. 



10.5.1 Simple Generic Classes 

Let's start with an example that illustrates the motivation for generic programming. In Subsec- 
tion 10.2.1, I remarked that it would be easy to use a LinkedList to implement a queue. (Queues 
were introduced in Subsection 9.3.2.) To ensure that the only operations that are performed 
on the list are the queue operations enqueue, dequeue, and isEmpty, we can create a new class 
that contains the linked list as a private instance variable. To implement queues of strings, for 
example, we can define the class: 

class QueueOf Strings { 

private LinkedList<String> items = new LinkedList<String> () ; 
public void enqueue (String item) { 
items . addLast (item) ; 

} 

public String dequeue () { 

return items . removeFirst () ; 

} 

public boolean isEmptyO { 

return (items . size () == 0); 

> 

} 

This is a fine and useful class. But, if this is how we write queue classes, and if we want 
queues of Integers or Doubles or JButtons or any other type, then we will have to write a 
different class for each type. The code for all of these classes will be almost identical, which 
seems like a lot of redundant programming. To avoid the redundancy, we can write a generic 
Queue class that can be used to define queues of any type of object. 

The syntax for writing the generic class is straightforward: We replace the specific type 
String with a type parameter such as T, and we add the type parameter to the name of the 
class: 

class Queue<T> { 

private LinkedList<T> items = new LinkedList<T> () ; 
public void enqueued item) { 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



509 



items . addLast (item) ; 

} 

public T dequeue () { 

return items . removeFirst () ; 

} 

public boolean isEmptyO { 

return (items . size () == 0); 

} 

} 

Note that within the class, the type parameter T is used just like any regular type name. 
It's used to declare the return type for dequeue, as the type of the formal parameter item in 
enqueue, and even as the actual type parameter in LinkedList< T>. Given this class definition, we 
can use parameterized types such as Queue<String> and Queue<lnteger> and Queue<JButton>. 
That is, the Queue class is used in exactly the same way as built-in generic classes like LinkedList 
and HashSet. 

Note that you don't have to use "T" as the name of the type parameter in the definition of 
the generic class. Type parameters are like formal parameters in subroutines. You can make up 
any name you like in the definition of the class. The name in the definition will be replaced by 
an actual type name when the class is used to declare variables or create objects. If you prefer 
to use a more meaningful name for the type parameter, you might define the Queue class as: 

class Queue< ItemType> { 

private LinkedList< ItemType> items = new LinkedList< ItemType> () ; 
public void enqueue (ItemType item) { 
items . addLast (item) ; 

} 

public ItemType dequeue () { 
return items . removeFirst () ; 

} 

public boolean isEmptyO { 

return (items . size () == 0); 

> 

} 

Changing the name from "T" to "ItemType" has absolutely no effect on the meaning of the 
class definition or on the way that Queue is used. 

Generic interfaces can be defined in a similar way. It's also easy to define generic classes 
and interfaces that have two or more type parameters, as is done with the standard interface 
Map<T,S>. A typical example is the definition of a "Pair" that contains two objects, possibly 
of different types. A simple version of such a class can be defined as: 

class Pair<T,S> { 
public T first; 
public S second; 

public Pair( T a, S b ) { // Constructor, 
first = a; 
second = b; 

} 

} 

This class can be used to declare variables and create objects such as: 

Pair<String,Color> colorName = new Pair<String,Color>("Red" , Color. RED); 
Pair<Double ,Double> coordinates = new Pair<Double,Double>(17.3,42.8) ; 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



510 



Note that in the definition of the constructor in this class, the name "Pair" does not have type 
parameters. You might have expected "Pair<T,S>". However, the name of the class is "Pair", 
not "Pair<T,S>", and within the definition of the class, "T" and "S" are used as if they are the 
names of specific, actual types. Note in any case that type parameters are never added to the 
names of methods or constructors, only to the names of classes and interfaces. 

10.5.2 Simple Generic Methods 

In addition to generic classes, Java also has generic methods. An example is the method 
Collections . sort () , which can sort collections of objects of any type. To see how to write 
generic methods, let's start with a non-generic method for counting the number of times that 
a given string occurs in an array of strings: 

/** 

* Returns the number of times that itemToCount occurs in list . Items in the 

* list are tested for equality using itemToCount . equals () , except in the 

* special case where itemToCount is null. 
*/ 

public static int countOccurrences (String [] list, String itemToCount) { 
int count = 0; 
if (itemToCount == null) { 

for ( String listltem : list ) 
if (listltem == null) 
count++; 

} 

else { 

for ( String listltem : list ) 

if (itemToCount . equals (listltem) ) 
count++; 

} 

return count ; 

} 

Once again, we have some code that works for type String, and we can imagine writing 
almost identical code to work with other types of objects. By writing a generic method, we get 
to write a single method definition that will work for objects of any type. We need to replace 
the specific type String in the definition of the method with the name of a type parameter, such 
as T. However, if that's the only change we make, the compiler will think that "T" is the name 
of an actual type, and it will mark it as an undeclared identifier. We need some way of telling 
the compiler that "T" is a type parameter. That's what the "<T>" does in the definition of the 
generic class "class Queue<T> { . . .". For a generic method, the "<T>" goes just before the 
name of the return type of the method: 

public static <T> int countOccurrences (T [] list, T itemToCount) { 
int count = 0; 
if (itemToCount == null) { 
for ( T listltem : list ) 
if (listltem == null) 
count++; 

} 

else { 

for ( T listltem : list ) 

if (itemToCount . equals (listltem) ) 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



511 



count++; 

} 

return count ; 

} 

The "<T>" marks the method as being generic and specifies the name of the type parameter 
that will be used in the definition. Of course, the name of the type parameter doesn't have to 
be "T"; it can be anything. (The "<T>" looks a little strange in that position, I know, but it 
had to go somewhere and that's just where the designers of Java decided to put it.) 

Given the generic method definition, we can apply it to objects of any type. If wordList is 
a variable of type String[] and word is a variable of type String, then 

int ct = countOccurrences ( wordList, word ); 

will count the number of times that word occurs in wordList 
Color[] and color is a variable of type Color, then 

int ct = countOccurrences ( palette, color ); 

will count the number of times that color occurs in palette 
lnteger[], then 

int ct = countOccurrences ( numbers, 17 ); 

will count the number of times that 17 occurs in numbers. This last example uses au- 
toboxing; the 17 is automatically converted to a value of type Integer, as if we had said 
"countOccurrences ( numbers, new Integer (17) )". Note that, since generic programming 
in Java applies only to objects, we cannot use countOccurrences to count the number of 
occurrences of 17 in an array of type int[ ]. 

A generic method can have one or more type parameters, such as the "T" in 
countOccurrences. Note that when a generic method is used, as in the function call 
"countOccurrences (wordlist , word)", there is no explicit mention of the type that is sub- 
stituted for the type parameter. The compiler deduces the type from the types of the actual 
parameters in the method call. Since wordlist is of type String[], the compiler can tell that 
in "countOccurrences (wordlist , word)", the type that replaces T is String. This contrasts 
with the use of generic classes, as in "new Queue<String>()", where the type parameter is 
specified explicitly. 

The countOccurrences method operates on an array. We could also write a similar method 
to count occurrences of an object in any collection: 

public static <T> int countOccurrences (Collection<T> collection, T itemToCount) { 
int count = 0; 
if (itemToCount == null) { 

for ( T item : collection ) 
if (item == null) 
count++; 

> 

else { 

for ( T item : collection ) 

if (itemToCount . equals (item) ) 
count++; 

} 

return count ; 

}

. If numbers is a variable of type

Since Collection<T> is itself a generic type, this method is very general. It can operate on 
an ArrayList of Integers, a TreeSet of Strings, a LinkedList of JButtons, .... 

10.5.3 Type Wildcards 

There is a limitation on the sort of generic classes and methods that we have looked at so far: 
The type parameter in our examples, usually named T, can be any type at all. This is OK 
in many cases, but it means that the only things that you can do with T are things that can 
be done with every type, and the only things that you can do with objects of type T are 
things that you can do with every object. With the techniques that we have covered so far, 
you can't, for example, write a generic method that compares objects with the compareToO 
method, since that method is not defined for all objects. The compareToO method is defined 
in the Comparable interface. What we need is a way of specifying that a generic class or method 
only applies to objects of type Comparable and not to arbitrary objects. With that restriction, 
we should be free to use compareToO in the definition of the generic class or method. 

There are two different but related syntaxes for putting restrictions on the types that are 
used in generic programming. One of these is bounded type parameters, which are used 
as formal type parameters in generic class and method definitions; a bounded type parameter 
would be used in place of the simple type parameter T in "class GenericClass<T> ..." or 
in "public static <T> void genericMethod( . . .". The second syntax is wildcard types, 
which are used as type parameters in the declarations of variables and of formal parameters 
in method definitions; a wildcard type could be used in place of the type parameter String 
in the declaration statement "List<String> list;" or in the formal parameter list "void 
max(Collection<String> c)". We will look at wildcard types first, and we will return to the 
topic of bounded types later in this section. 

Let's start with a simple example in which a wildcard type is useful. Suppose that Shape 
is a class that defines a method public void draw(), and suppose that Shape has subclasses 
such as Red and Oval. Suppose that we want a method that can draw all the shapes in a 
collection of Shapes. We might try: 

public static void drawAll (Collection<Shape> shapes) { 
for ( Shape s : shapes ) 
s . drawO ; 

} 

This method works fine if we apply it to a variable of type Collection<Shape>, or Ar- 
rayList<Shape>, or any other collection class with type parameter Shape. Suppose, however, 
that you have a list of Rects stored in a variable named rectangles of type Collection<Rect>. 
Since Rects are Shapes, you might expect to be able to call drawAll (rectangles). Unfortu- 
nately, this will not work; a collection of Rects is not considered to be a collection of Shapes] 
The variable rectangles cannot be assigned to the formal parameter shapes. The solution 
is to replace the type parameter "Shape" in the declaration of shapes with the wildcard type 
"? extends Shape": 

public static void drawAll (Collection< ? extends Shape> shapes) { 
for ( Shape s : shapes ) 
s . drawO ; 

} 

The wildcard type "? extends Shape" means roughly "any type that is either equal to Shape 
or that is a subclass of Shape" . When the parameter shapes is declared to be of type Collec- 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



513 



tion< ? extends Shape>, it becomes possible to call the drawAll method with an actual parameter 
of type Collection<Rect> since Red is a subclass of Shape and therefore matches the wildcard. 
We could also pass actual parameters to drawAll of type ArrayList<Rect> or Set<Oval> or 
List<Oval>. And we can still pass variables of type Collection<Shape> or ArrayList<Shape>, since 
the class Shape itself matches "? extends Shape". We have greatly increased the usefulness 
of the method by using the wildcard type. 

(Although it is not essential, you might be interested in knowing why Java does not allow 
a collection of Rects to be used as a collection of Shapes, even though every Rect is considered 
to be a Shape. Consider the rather silly but legal method that adds an oval to a list of shapes: 

static void addOval (List<Shape> shapes, Oval oval) { 
shapes . add (oval) ; 

} 

Suppose that rectangles is of type List<Rect>. It's illegal to call addOval (rectangles, oval), 
because of the rule that a list of Rects is not a list of Shapes. If we dropped that rule, then 
addOval (rectangles , oval) would be legal, and it would add an Oval to a list of Rects. This 
would be bad: Since Oval is not a subclass of Rect, an Oval is not a Rect, and a list of Rects 
should never be able to contain an Oval. The method call addOval (rectangles , oval) does 
not make sense and should be illegal, so the rule that a collection of Rects is not a collection 
of Shapes is a good rule.) 

As another example, consider the method addAllO from the interface Collection<T>. In 
my description of this method in Subsection 10.1.4, I say that for a collection, coll, of type 
Collection<T>, coll . addAll (coll2) "adds all the objects in coll2 to coll. The parameter, 
coll2, can be any collection of type Collection<T>. However, it can also be more general. For 
example, if T is a class and S is a sub-class of T, then coll2 can be of type Collection<S>. 
This makes sense because any object of type S is automatically of type T and so can legally 
be added to coll." If you think for a moment, you'll see that what I'm describing here, a little 
awkwardly, is a use of wildcard types: We don't want to require coll2 to be a collection of 
objects of type 7"; we want to allow collections of any subclass of T. To be more specific, let's 
look at how a similar addAll () method could be added to the generic Queue class that was 
defined earlier in this section: 

class Queue<T> { 

private LinkedList<T> items = new LinkedList<T> () ; 
public void enqueue (T item) { 
items . addLast (item) ; 

} 

public T dequeue () { 

return items . removeFirst () ; 

} 

public boolean isEmptyO { 

return (items . size () == 0); 

> 

public void addAll (Collection<? extends T> collection) { 

// Add all the items from the collection to the end of the queue 
for ( T item : collection ) 
enqueue (item) ; 

} 

} 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



514 



Here, T is a type parameter in the generic class definition. We are combining wildcard 
types with generic classes. Inside the generic class definition, "T" is used as if it is a specific, 
though unknown, type. The wildcard type "? extends T" means some type that extends that 
specific type. When we create a queue of type Queue<Shape>, "T" refers to "Shape", and the 
wildcard type "? extends T" in the class definition means "? extends Shape", meaning that 
the addAll method of the queue can be applied to collections of Rects and Ovals as well as to 
collections of Shapes. 

The for-each loop in the definition of addAll iterates through the collection using a 
variable, item, of type T. Now, collection can be of type Collection<S>, where S is a subclass 
of T. Since item is of type T, not S, do we have a problem here? No, no problem. As long as 
S is a subclass of 7", a value of type S can be assigned to a variable of type T. The restriction 
on the wildcard type makes everything work nicely. 

The addAll method adds all the items from a collection to the queue. Suppose that we 
wanted to do the opposite: Add all the items that are currently on the queue to a given 
collection. An instance method defined as 

public void addAllTo(Collection<T> collection) 

would only work for collections whose base type is exactly the same as T. This is too restrictive. 
We need some sort of wildcard. However, "? extends T" won't work. Suppose we try it: 

public void addAllTo(Collection<? extends T> collection) { 

// Remove all items currently on the queue and add them to collection 
while ( ! isEmptyO ) { 

T item = dequeue (); // Remove an item from the queue, 
collection. add( item ); // Add it to the collection. ILLEGAL! ! 

y 

y 

The problem is that we can't add an item of type T to a collection that might only be able 
to hold items belonging to some subclass, S, of T. The containment is going in the wrong 
direction: An item of type T is not necessarily of type S. For example, if we have a queue of 
type Queue<Shape>, it doesn't make sense to add items from the queue to a collection of type 
Collection<Rect>, since not every Shape is a Rect. On the other hand, if we have a Queue<Rect>, 
it would make sense to add items from that queue to a Collection<Shape> or indeed to any 
collection Collection<S> where S is a superclass of Rect. 

To express this type of relationship, we need a new kind of type wildcard: "? super T" . 
This wildcard means, roughly, "either T itself or any class that is a superclass of 7"." For 
example, Collection<? super Rect> would match the types Collection<Shape>, ArrayList<Object>, 
and Set<Rect>. This is what we need for our addAHTo method. With this change, our complete 
generic queue class becomes: 

class Queue<T> { 

private LinkedList<T> items = new LinkedList<T> () ; 
public void enqueue (T item) { 
items . addLast (item) ; 

} 

public T dequeue () { 

return items . removeFirst () ; 

} 

public boolean isEmptyO { 

return (items . size () == 0); 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



515 



} 

public void addAll (Collection<? extends T> collection) { 

// Add all the items from the collection to the end of the queue 
for ( T item : collection ) 
enqueue (item) ; 

> 

public void addAHTo (Collection<? super T> collection) { 

//Remove all items currently on the queue and add them to collection 
while ( ! isEmptyO ) { 

T item = dequeue () ; // Remove an item from the queue, 
collection. add( item ); // Add it to the collection. 

} 

} 

} 

In a wildcard type such as "? extends T", T can be an interface instead of a class. Note 
that the term "extends" (not "implements") is used in the wildcard type, even if T is an 
interface. For example, we will see that Runnable is an interface that defines the method 
public void run(). (Runnable objects are usually associated with threads; see Chapter 12.) 
Here is a method that runs all the objects in a collection of Runnables by executing the run() 
method from each runnable object: 

public static runAll( Collection<? extends Runnable> runnables ) { 
for ( Runnable runnable : runnables ) { 
runnable . run ( ) ; 

} 

} 

* * * 

Wildcard types are used only as type parameters in parameterized types, such as Collec- 
tion<? extends Runnable>. The place where a wildcard type is most likely to occur, by far, is 
in a formal parameter list, where the wildcard type is used in the declaration of the type of a 
formal parameter. However, they can also be used in a few other places. For example, they can 
be used in the type specification in a variable declaration statement. 

One final remark: The wildcard type "<?>" is equivalent to "<? extends Object>". That 
is, it matches any possible type. For example, the removeAllO method in the generic interface 
Collections<T> is declared as 

public boolean removeAll( Collection<?> c ) { ... 

This just means that the removeAll method can be applied to any collection of any type of 
object. 

10.5.4 Bounded Types 

Wildcard types don't solve all of our problems. They allow us to generalize method definitions 
so that they can work with collections of objects of various types, rather than just a single type. 
However, they do not allow us to restrict the types that are allowed as type parameters in a 
generic class or method definition. Bounded types exist for this purpose. 

We start with a small, not very realistic example. Suppose that you would like to cre- 
ate groups of GUI components using a generic class named ComponentGroup. For example, 
the parameterized type ComponentGroup<JButton> would represent a group of JButtons, while 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



516 



ComponentGroup<JPanel> would represent a group of JPanels. The class will include methods 
that can be called to apply certain operations to all components in the group at once. For 
example, there will be an instance method of the form 

public void repaintAll () { 

// Call the repaint () method of every component in the group. 

} 

The problem is that the repaint () method is defined in a JComponent object, but not for ob- 
jects of arbitrary type. It wouldn't make sense to allow types such as ComponentGroup<String> 
or ComponentGroup<lnteger>, since Strings and Integers don't have repaint () methods. We 
need some way to restrict the type parameter T in ComponentGroup< T> so that only JCompo- 
nent and subclasses of JComponent are allowed as actual type parameters. We can do this by 
using the bounded type "T extends JComponent" instead of a plain "T" in the definition of 
the class: 

public class ComponentGroup<r extends JComponent> { 

private ArrayList<T> components; // For storing the components in this group, 
public void repaintAll () { 

for ( JComponent c : components ) 
if (c != null) 
c. repaint () ; 

} 

public void setAHEnabled( boolean enable ) { 
for ( JComponent c : components ) 
if (c != null) 

c . setEnabled(enable) ; 

} 

} 

public void add( T c ) { // Add a value c, of type T, to the group, 
components . add(c) ; 

} 

// Additional methods and constructors. 

} 

The restriction "extends JComponent" on T makes it illegal to create the parameterized 
types ComponentGroup<String> and ComponentGroup<lnteger>, since the actual type parameter 
that replaces "T" is required to be either JComponent itself or a subclass of JComponent. 
With this restriction, we know — and, more important, the compiler knows — that the objects in 
the group are of type JComponent and the operations c. repaint () and c . setEnabledO are 
defined for any c in the group. 

In general, a bounded type parameter "T extends SomeType" means roughly "a type, 7", 
that is either equal to SomeType or is a subclass of SomeType" , and the upshot is that any 
object of type T is also of type SomeType, and any operation that is defined for objects of type 
SomeType is defined for objects of type T. The type SomeType doesn't have to be the name of 
a class. It can be any name that represents an actual object type. For example, it can be an 
interface or even a parameterized type. 

Bounded types and wildcard types are clearly related. They are, however, used in very 
different ways. A bounded type can be used only as a formal type parameter in the definition 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



517 



of a generic method, class, or interface. A wildcard type is used most often to declare the type 
of a formal parameter in a method and cannot be used as a formal type parameter. One other 
difference, by the way, is that, in contrast to wildcard types, bounded type parameters can only 
use "extends", never "super". 

Bounded type parameters can be used when declaring generic methods. For example, as 
an alternative to the generic ComponentGroup class, one could write a free-standing generic 
static method that can repaint any collection of JComponents as follows: 

public static <T extends JComponent> void repaintAll(Collection<T> comps) { 
for ( JComponent c : comps ) 
if (c != null) 
c.repaintO ; 

} 

Using "<T extends JComponent>" as the formal type parameter means that the method can 
only be called for collections whose base type is JComponent or some subclass of JComponent. 
Thus, it is legal to call repaintAll(coll) where coll is of type List<JPanel> but not where 
coll is of type Set<String>. 

Note that we don't really need a generic type parameter in this case. We can write an 
equivalent method using a wildcard type: 

public static void repaintAll(Collection<? extends JComponent> comps) { 
for ( JComponent c : comps ) 
if (c != null) 
c.repaintO ; 

} 

In this situation, the version that uses the wildcard type is to be preferred, since the implemen- 
tation is simpler. However, there are some situations where a generic method with a bounded 
type parameter cannot be rewritten using a wildcard type. Note that a generic type parameter 
gives a name, such as T, to the unknown type, while a wildcard type does not give a name to 
the unknown type. The name makes it possible to refer to the unknown type in the body of 
the method that is being defined. If a generic method definition uses the generic type name 
more than once or uses it outside the formal parameter list of the method, then the generic 
type cannot be replaced with a wildcard type. 

Let's look at a generic method in which a bounded type parameter is essential. In Subsec- 
tion 10.2.1, I presented a code segment for inserting a string into a sorted list of strings, in such 
a way that the modified list is still in sorted order. Here is the same code, but this time in the 
form of a method definition (and without the comments): 

static void sortedlnsert (List<String> sortedList, String newltem) { 
ListIterator<String> iter = sortedList . listlterator O ; 
while (iter.hasNextO) { 

String item = iter. next O; 
if (newltem. compareTo (item) <= 0) { 
iter .previous () ; 
break; 

} 

} 

iter . add (newltem) ; 

} 



CHAPTER 10. GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES 



518 



This method works fine for lists of strings, but it would be nice to have a generic method 
that can be applied to lists of other types of objects. The problem, of course, is that the code 
assumes that the compareToO method is defined for objects in the list, so the method can 
only work for lists of objects that implement the Comparable interface. We can't simply use 
a wildcard type to enforce this restriction. Suppose we try to do it, by replacing List<String> 
with List<? extends Comparable>: 

static void sortedlnsert (List<? extends Comparable> sortedList, ???? newltem) { 
ListIterator< ????> iter = stringList . listlterator () ; 

We immediately run into a problem, because we have no name for the unknown type represented 
by the wildcard. We need a name for that type because the type of newltem and of iter should 
be the same as the type of the items in the list. The problem is solved if we write a generic 
method with a bounded type parameter, since then we have a name for the unknown type, and 
we can write a valid generic method: 

static <T extends Comparable> void sortedlnsert (List<T> sortedList, T newltem) { 
ListIterator<T> iter = sortedList . listlterator () ; 
while (iter.hasNextO) { 
T item = iter.nextO; 
if (newltem. compareTo( item) <= 0) { 
iter .previous () ; 
break; 

} 

} 

iter . add (newltem) ; 

} 

There is still one technicality to cover in this example. Comparable is itself a parameterized 
type, but I have used it here without a type parameter. This is legal but the compiler might give 
you a warning about using a "raw type." In fact, the objects in the list should implement the 
parameterized interface Comparable<T>, since they are being compared to items of type T. This 
just means that instead of using Comparable as the type bound, we should use Comparable<T>: 

static <T extends Comparable<T» void sortedlnsert (List<T> sortedList, ... 

* * * 

With this example, I will leave the topic of generic types and generic programming. In this 
chapter, I have occasionally used terms such as "strange" and "weird" to talk about generic 
programming in Java. I will confess that I have some affection for the more simple-minded 
generic programming style of Smalltalk. Nevertheless, I recognize the power and increased 
robustness of generics in Java. I hope that I have convinced you that using the Java Collection 
Framework is reasonably natural and straightforward, and that using it can save you a lot of 
time and effort compared to repeatedly recoding the same data structures and algorithms from 
scratch. Things become more technical when you start writing new generic classes and methods 
of your own, and the syntax is (as I've said) a little strange. But with some practice, you'll get 
used to the syntax and will find that it's not that difficult after all.

Exercises for Chapter 10 

1. Rewrite the PhoneDirectory class from Subsection 7.4.2 so that it uses a TreeMap to store (solution) 
directory entries, instead of an array. (Doing this was suggested in Subsection 10.3.1.) 

2. In mathematics, several operations are defined on sets. The union of two sets A and B is (solution) 
a set that contains all the elements that are in A together with all the elements that are 

in B. The intersection of A and B is the set that contains elements that are in both A 
and B. The difference of A and B is the set that contains all the elements of A except 
for those elements that are also in B. 

Suppose that A and B are variables of type set in Java. The mathematical opera- 
tions on A and B can be computed using methods from the Set interface. In particular: 
A.addAll(B) computes the union of A and B; A.retainAll(B) computes the intersection 
of A and B; and A.removeAll(B) computes the difference of A and B. (These operations 
change the contents of the set A, while the mathematical operations create a new set 
without changing A, but that difference is not relevant to this exercise.) 

For this exercise, you should write a program that can be used as a "set calcula- 
tor" for simple operations on sets of non- negative integers. (Negative integers are not 
allowed.) A set of such integers will be represented as a list of integers, separated by 
commas and, optionally, spaces and enclosed in square brackets. For example: [1,2,3] 
or [17, 42, 9, 53, 108]. The characters +, *, and - will be used for the union, in- 
tersection, and difference operations. The user of the program will type in lines of input 
containing two sets, separated by an operator. The program should perform the operation 
and print the resulting set. Here are some examples: 



To represent sets of non-negative integers, use sets of type TreeSet<lnteger> . Read the 
user's input, create two TreeSets, and use the appropriate TreeSet method to perform the 
requested operation on the two sets. Your program should be able to read and process 
any number of lines of input. If a line contains a syntax error, your program should not 
crash. It should report the error and move on to the next line of input. (Note: To print 
out a Set, A, of Integers, you can just say System, out .println(A) . I've chosen the syntax 
for sets to be the same as that used by the system for outputting a set.) 

3. The fact that Java has a Hash Map class means that no Java programmer has to write (solution) 
an implementation of hash tables from scratch — unless, of course, that programmer is a 
computer science student. 

For this exercise, you should write a hash table in which both the keys and the values 
are of type String. (This is not an exercise in generic programming; do not try to write a 
generic class.) Write an implementation of hash tables from scratch. Define the following 
methods: get(key), put (key, value), remove (key) , containsKey (key) , and size(). 
Remember that every object, obj, has a method obj . hashCode ( ) that can be used for 
computing a hash code for the object, so at least you don't have to define your own hash 
function. Do not use any of Java's built-in generic types; create your own linked lists

using nodes as covered in Subsection 9.2.2. However, you do not have to worry about 
increasing the size of the table when it becomes too full. 

You should also write a short program to test your solution. 

4. A predicate is a boolean- valued function with one parameter. Some languages use pred- (solution) 
icates in generic programming. Java doesn't, but this exercise looks at how predicates 

might work in Java. 

In Java, we could implement "predicate objects" by defining a generic interface: 

public interface Predicate<T> { 
public boolean test( T obj ); 

} 

The idea is that an object that implements this interface knows how to "test" objects 
of type T in some way. Define a class that contains the following generic static methods 
for working with predicate objects. The name of the class should be Predicates, in analogy 
with the standard class Collections that provides various static methods for working with 
collections. 

public static <T> void remove (Collection<T> coll, Predicate<T> pred) 
// Remove every object, obj, from coll for which 
// pred. test (obj) is true. 

public static <T> void retain(Collection<T> coll, Predicate<T> pred) 
// Remove every object, obj, from coll for which 
// pred. test (obj) is false. (That is, retain the 
// objects for which the predicate is true.) 

public static <T> List<T> collect (Collection<T> coll, Predicate<T> pred) 
// Return a List that contains all the objects, obj, 
// from the collection, coll, such that pred. test (obj) 
//is true. 

public static <T> int f ind(ArrayList<T> list, Predicate<T> pred) 
// Return the index of the first item in list 
// for which the predicate is true, if any. 
// If there is no such item, return -1. 

(In C++, methods similar to these are included as a standard part of the generic pro- 
gramming framework.) 

5. An example in Subsection 10.4.2 concerns the problem of making an index for a book. (solution) 
A related problem is making a concordance for a document. A concordance lists every 

word that occurs in the document, and for each word it gives the line number of every 
line in the document where the word occurs. All the subroutines for creating an index 
that were presented in Subsection 10.4.2 can also be used to create a concordance. The 
only real difference is that the integers in a concordance are line numbers rather than page 
numbers. 

Write a program that can create a concordance. The document should be read from 
an input file, and the concordance data should be written to an output file. You can use 
the indexing subroutines from Subsection 10.4.2, modified to write the data to TextID 
instead of to System. out. (You will need to make these subroutines static.) The input 
and output files should be selected by the user when the program is run. The sample 



Exercises 



521 



program WordCount.java, from Subsection 10.4.4, can be used as a model of how to use 
files. That program also has a useful subroutine that reads one word from input. 

As you read the file, you want to take each word that you encounter and add it to the 
concordance along with the current line number. Keeping track of the line numbers is one 
of the trickiest parts of the problem. In an input file, the end of each line in the file is 
marked by the newline character, '\n'. Every time you encounter this character, you have 
to add one to the line number. WordCount.java ignores ends of lines. Because you need 
to find and count the end-of-line characters, your program cannot process the input file in 
exactly the same way as does WordCount.java. Also, you will need to detect the end of 
the file. The function TextIO .peekQ , which is used to look ahead at the next character 
in the input, returns the value TextIO. EOF at end-of-file, after all the characters in the 
file have been read. 

Because it is so common, don't include the word "the" in your concordance. Also, do 
not include words that have length less than 3. 

6. The sample program Simplelnterpreter.java from Subsection 10.4.1 can carry out com- (solution) 
mands of the form "let variable = expression" or "print expression" . That program can 
handle expressions that contain variables, numbers, operators, and parentheses. Extend 
the program so that it can also handle the standard mathematical functions sin, cos, 
tan, abs, sqrt, and log. For example, the program should be able to evaluate an expres- 
sion such as sin(3*x-7)+log(sqrt(y)), assuming that the variables x and y have been 
given values. Note that the name of a function must be followed by an expression that is 
enclosed in parentheses. 

In the original program, a symbol table holds a value for each variable that has been 
defined. In your program, you should add another type of symbol to the table to represent 
standard functions. You can use the following nested enumerated type and class for this 
purpose: 

private emim Functions { SIN, COS , TAN, ABS, SQRT, LOG } 
/** 

* An object of this class represents one of the standard functions. 
*/ 

private static class StandardFunction { 
/** 

* Tells which function this is. 
*/

Add a symbol to the symbol table to represent each function. The key is the name 
of the function and the value is an object of type StandardFunction that represents the 
function. For example: 

symbolTable.putC'sin" , new StandardFunction(StandardFunction.SIN)) ; 

In Simplelnterpreter.java, the symbol table is a map of type HashMap<String,Double>. It's 
not legal to use a StandardFunction as the value in such a map, so you will have to change 
the type of the map. The map has to hold two different types of objects. The easy way 
to make this possible is to create a map of type HashMap<String,Object>. (A better way 
is to create a general type to represent objects that can be values in the symbol table, 
and to define two subclasses of that class, one to represent variables and one to represent 
standard functions, but for this exercise, you should do it the easy way.) 

In your parser, when you encounter a word, you have to be able to tell whether it's a 
variable or a standard function. Look up the word in the symbol table. If the associated 
object is non-null and is of type Double, then the word is a variable. If it is of type 
StandardFunction, then the word is a function. Remember that you can test the type of 
an object using the instanceof operator. For example: if (obj instanceof Double)

Advanced Input /Out put: 
Streams, Files, and Networking 

Computer PROGRAMS are only useful if they interact with the rest of the world in some 
way. This interaction is referred to as input/output, or I/O. Up until now, this book has 
concentrated on just one type of interaction: interaction with the user, through either a graph- 
ical user interface or a command-line interface. But the user is only one possible source of 
information and only one possible destination for information. We have already encountered 
one other type of input/output, since TextIO can read data from files and write data to files. 
However, Java has an input/output framework that provides much more power and flexibility 
than does TextIO, and that covers other kinds of I/O in addition to files. Most importantly, it 
supports communication over network connections. In Java, input/output involving files and 
networks is based on streams, which are objects that support I/O commands that are similar 
to those that you have already used. In fact, standard output (System, out) and standard input 
(System, in) are examples of streams. 

Working with files and networks requires familiarity with exceptions, which were covered in 
Chapter 8. Many of the subroutines that are used can throw exceptions that require mandatory 
exception handling. This generally means calling the subroutine in a try. .catch statement 
that can deal with the exception if one occurs. Effective network communication also requires 
the use of threads, which will be covered in Chapter 12. We will look at the basic networking 
API in this chapter, but we will return to the topic of threads and networking in Section 12.4. 

11.1 Streams, Readers, and Writers 

Without the ability to interact with the rest of the world, a program would be useless. (online) 

The interaction of a program with the rest of the world is referred to as input/output or I/O. 

Historically, one of the hardest parts of programming language design has been coming up with 

good facilities for doing input and output. A computer can be connected to many different 

types of input and output devices. If a programming language had to deal with each type of 

device as a special case, the complexity would be overwhelming. One of the major achievements 

in the history of programming has been to come up with good abstractions for representing 

I/O devices. In Java, the main I/O abstractions are called streams. Other I/O abstractions, 

such as "files" and "channels" also exist, but in this section we will look only at streams. Every 

stream represents either a source of input or a destination to which output can be sent.

CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING

11.1.1 Character and Byte Streams 

When dealing with input /output, you have to keep in mind that there are two broad categories 
of data: machine-formatted data and human-readable text. Machine-formatted data is repre- 
sented in binary form, the same way that data is represented inside the computer, that is, as 
strings of zeros and ones. Human-readable data is in the form of characters. When you read a 
number such as 3. 141592654, you are reading a sequence of characters and interpreting them 
as a number. The same number would be represented in the computer as a bit-string that you 
would find unrecognizable. 

To deal with the two broad categories of data representation, Java has two broad categories 
of streams: byte streams for machine-formatted data and character streams for human- 
readable data. There are many predefined classes that represent streams of each type. 

An object that outputs data to a byte stream belongs to one of the subclasses of the 
abstract class OutputStream. Objects that read data from a byte stream belong to subclasses 
of InputStream. If you write numbers to an OutputStream, you won't be able to read the 
resulting data yourself. But the data can be read back into the computer with an InputStream. 
The writing and reading of the data will be very efficient, since there is no translation involved: 
the bits that are used to represent the data inside the computer are simply copied to and from 
the streams. 

For reading and writing human-readable character data, the main classes are the abstract 
classes Reader and Writer. All character stream classes are subclasses of one of these. If a 
number is to be written to a Writer stream, the computer must translate it into a human- 
readable sequence of characters that represents that number. Reading a number from a Reader 
stream into a numeric variable also involves a translation, from a character sequence into the 
appropriate bit string. (Even if the data you are working with consists of characters in the 
first place, such as words from a text editor, there might still be some translation. Characters 
are stored in the computer as 16-bit Unicode values. For people who use Western alphabets, 
character data is generally stored in files in ASCII code, which uses only 8 bits per character. 
The Reader and Writer classes take care of this translation, and can also handle non-western 
alphabets in countries that use them.) 

Byte streams can be useful for direct machine-to-machine communication, and they can 
sometimes be useful for storing data in files, especially when large amounts of data need to be 
stored efficiently, such as in large databases. However, binary data is fragile in the sense that its 
meaning is not self-evident. When faced with a long series of zeros and ones, you have to know 
what information it is meant to represent and how that information is encoded before you will 
be able to interpret it. Of course, the same is true to some extent for character data, which is 
itself coded into binary form. But the binary encoding of character data has been standardized 
and is well understood, and data expressed in character form can be made meaningful to human 
readers. The current trend seems to be towards increased use of character data, represented in 
a way that will make its meaning as self-evident as possible. We'll look at one way this is done 
in Section 11.5. 

I should note that the original version of Java did not have character streams, and that 
for ASCII-encoded character data, byte streams are largely interchangeable with character 
streams. In fact, the standard input and output streams, System, in and System, out, are byte 
streams rather than character streams. However, you should use Readers and Writers rather 
than InputStreams and OutputStreams when working with character data, even when working 
with the standard ASCII character set. 

The standard stream classes discussed in this section are defined in the package java.io, 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



526 



along with several supporting classes. You must import the classes from this package if you 
want to use them in your program. That means either importing individual classes or putting 
the directive "import java.io.*;" at the beginning of your source file. Streams are necessary 
for working with files and for doing communication over a network. They can also be used 
for communication between two concurrently running threads, and there are stream classes for 
reading and writing data stored in the computer's memory. 

The beauty of the stream abstraction is that it is as easy to write data to a file or to send 
data over a network as it is to print information on the screen. 

* * * 

The basic I/O classes Reader, Writer, InputStream, and OutputStream provide only very 
primitive I/O operations. For example, the InputStream class declares the instance method 

public int readO throws IOException 

for reading one byte of data, as a number in the range to 255, from an input stream. If the 
end of the input stream is encountered, the readO method will return the value -1 instead. If 
some error occurs during the input attempt, an exception of type IOException is thrown. Since 
IOException is an exception class that requires mandatory exception-handling, this means that 
you can't use the readO method except inside a try statement or in a subroutine that is itself 
declared with a "throws IOException" clause. (Mandatory exception handling was covered in 
Subsection 8.3.3.) 

The InputStream class also defines methods for reading multiple bytes of data in one step 
into an array of bytes. However, InputStream provides no convenient methods for reading other 
types of data, such as int or double, from a stream. This is not a problem because you'll never 
use an object of type InputStream itself. Instead, you'll use subclasses of InputStream that add 
more convenient input methods to InputStream's rather primitive capabilities. Similarly, the 
OutputStream class defines a primitive output method for writing one byte of data to an output 
stream. The method is defined as: 

public void write (int b) throws IOException 

The parameter is of type int rather than byte, but the parameter value is type-cast to type 
byte before it is written; this effectively discards all but the eight low order bits of b. Again, 
in practice, you will almost always use higher-level output operations defined in some subclass 
of OutputStream. 

The Reader and Writer classes provide the analogous low-level read and write methods. 
As in the byte stream classes, the parameter of the write (c) method in Writer and the return 
value of the readO method in Reader are of type int, but in these character-oriented classes, 
the I/O operations read and write characters rather than bytes. The return value of readO 
is -1 if the end of the input stream has been reached. Otherwise, the return value must be 
type-cast to type char to obtain the character that was read. In practice, you will ordinarily use 
higher level I/O operations provided by sub-classes of Reader and Writer, as discussed below. 

11.1.2 Print Writer 

One of the neat things about Java's I/O package is that it lets you add capabilities to a stream 
by "wrapping" it in another stream object that provides those capabilities. The wrapper object 
is also a stream, so you can read from or write to it — but you can do so using fancier operations 
than those available for basic streams. 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



527 



For example, PrintWriter is a subclass of Writer that provides convenient methods for out- 
putting human-readable character representations of all of Java's basic data types. If you have 
an object belonging to the Writer class, or any of its subclasses, and you would like to use 
PrintWriter methods to output data to that Writer, all you have to do is wrap the Writer in a 
PrintWriter object. You do this by constructing a new PrintWriter object, using the Writer as 
input to the constructor. For example, if charSink is of type Writer, then you could say 

PrintWriter printableCharSink = new PrintWriter (charSink) ; 

When you output data to printableCharSink, using the high-level output methods in Print- 
Writer, that data will go to exactly the same place as data written directly to charSink. You've 
just provided a better interface to the same output stream. For example, this allows you to use 
PrintWriter methods to send data to a file or over a network connection. 

For the record, if out is a variable of type PrintWriter, then the following methods are 
defined: 

• out. print (x) — prints the value of x, represented in the form of a string of characters, 
to the output stream; x can be an expression of any type, including both primitive types 
and object types. An object is converted to string form using its toStringO method. A 
null value is represented by the string "null" . 

• out .printlnO — outputs an end-of-line to the output stream. 

• out .println(x) — outputs the value of x, followed by an end-of-line; this is equivalent 
to out. print (x) followed by out .printlnO . 

• out .printf (f ormatString, xl, x2, . . .) — does formatted output of xl, x2, ... to 
the output stream. The first parameter is a string that specifies the format of the output. 
There can be any number of additional parameters, of any type, but the types of the 
parameters must match the formatting directives in the format string. Formatted output 
for the standard output stream, System. out, was introduced in Subsection 2.4.4, and 
out . printf has the same functionality. 

• out. f lush () — ensures that characters that have been written with the above methods 
are actually sent to the output destination. In some cases, notably when writing to a file 
or to the network, it might be necessary to call this method to force the output to actually 
appear at the destination. 

Note that none of these methods will ever throw an lOException. Instead, the PrintWriter 
class includes the method 

public boolean checkErrorO 

which will return true if any error has been encountered while writing to the stream. The 
PrintWriter class catches any lOExceptions internally, and sets the value of an internal error flag 
if one occurs. The checkErrorO method can be used to check the error flag. This allows you 
to use PrintWriter methods without worrying about catching exceptions. On the other hand, to 
write a fully robust program, you should call checkErrorO to test for possible errors whenever 
you use a PrintWriter. 

11.1.3 Data Streams 

When you use a PrintWriter to output data to a stream, the data is converted into the sequence 
of characters that represents the data in human-readable form. Suppose you want to output 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



528 



the data in byte-oriented, machine-formatted form? The java.io package includes a byte- 
stream class, DataOutputStream that can be used for writing data values to streams in internal, 
binary-number format. DataOutputStream bears the same relationship to OutputStream that 
PrintWriter bears to Writer. That is, whereas OutputStream only has methods for outputting 
bytes, DataOutputStream has methods writeDouble (double x) for outputting values of type 
double, writelnt(int x) for outputting values of type int, and so on. Furthermore, you can 
wrap any OutputStream in a DataOutputStream so that you can use the higher level output 
methods on it. For example, if byteSink is of type OutputStream, you could say 

DataOutputStream dataSink = new DataOutputStream (byteSink) ; 

to wrap byteSink in a DataOutputStream, dataSink. 

For input of machine-readable data, such as that created by writing to a DataOutputStream, 
java.io provides the class DatalnputStream. You can wrap any InputStream in a Dataln- 
putStream object to provide it with the ability to read data of various types from the byte- 
stream. The methods in the DatalnputStream for reading binary data are called readDoubleO , 
readlntQ, and so on. Data written by a DataOutputStream is guaranteed to be in a format 
that can be read by a DatalnputStream. This is true even if the data stream is created on one 
type of computer and read on another type of computer. The cross-platform compatibility of 
binary data is a major aspect of Java's platform independence. 

In some circumstances, you might need to read character data from an InputStream or write 
character data to an OutputStream. This is not a problem, since characters, like all data, are 
represented as binary numbers. However, for character data, it is convenient to use Reader and 
Writer instead of InputStream and OutputStream. To make this possible, you can wrap a byte 
stream in a character stream. If byteSource is a variable of type InputStream and byteSink is 
of type OutputStream, then the statements 

Reader charSource = new InputStreamReader ( byteSource ); 
Writer charSink = new OutputStreamWriter ( byteSink ); 

create character streams that can be used to read character data from and write character 
data to the byte streams. In particular, the standard input stream System, in, which is of 
type InputStream for historical reasons, can be wrapped in a Reader to make it easier to read 
character data from standard input: 

Reader charln = new InputStreamReader ( System. in ); 

As another application, the input and output streams that are associated with a network 
connection are byte streams rather than character streams, but the byte streams can be wrapped 
in character streams to make it easy to send and receive character data over the network. We 
will encounter network I/O in Section 11.4. 

There are various ways for characters to be encoded as binary data. A particular encoding is 
known as a charset or character set. Charsets have standardized names such as "UTF-16," 
"UTF-8," and "ISO-8859-1." In UTF-16, characters are encoded as 16-bit UNICODE values; 
this is the character set that is used internally by Java. UTF-8 is a way of encoding UNICODE 
characters using 8 bits for common ASCII characters and longer codes for other characters. 
ISO-8859-1, also known as "Latin-1," is an 8-bit encoding that includes ASCII characters as 
well as certain accented characters that are used in several European languages. Readers and 
Writers use the default charset for the computer on which they are running, unless you specify 
a different one. This can be done, for example, in a constructor such as 

Writer charSink = new OutputStreamWriter ( byteSink, "ISO-8859-1" ); 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



529 



Certainly, the existence of a variety of charset encodings has made text processing more 
complicated — unfortunate for us English-speakers but essential for people who use non- Western 
character sets. Ordinarily, you don't have to worry about this, but it's a good idea to be aware 
that different charsets exist in case you run into textual data encoded in a non-default way. 

11.1.4 Reading Text 

Much I/O is done in the form of human-readable characters. In view of this, it is surprising 
that Java does not provide a standard character input class that can read character data in 
a manner that is reasonably symmetrical with the character output capabilities of PrintWriter. 
(The Scanner class, introduced briefly in Subsection 2.4.6 and covered in more detail in Sub- 
section 11.1.5, comes pretty close.) There is one basic case that is easily handled by a standard 
class. The BufFeredReader class has a method 

public String readLineO throws IDException 

that reads one line of text from its input source. If the end of the stream has been reached, the 
return value is null. When a line of text is read, the end-of-line marker is read from the input 
stream, but it is not part of the string that is returned. Different input streams use different 
characters as end-of-line markers, but the readLine method can deal with all the common cases. 
(Traditionally, Unix computers, including Linux and Mac OS X, use a line feed character, ' \n' , 
to mark an end of line; classic Macintosh used a carriage return character, ' \r ' ; and Windows 
uses the two-character sequence "\r\n" . In general, modern computers can deal correctly with 
all of these possibilities.) 

Line-by-line processing is very common. Any Reader can be wrapped in a BufFeredReader 
to make it easy to read full lines of text. If reader is of type Reader, then a BufFeredReader 
wrapper can be created for reader with 

Buf f eredReader in = new Buf f eredReader ( reader ); 

This can be combined with the InputStreamReader class that was mentioned above to read lines 
of text from an InputStream. For example, we can apply this to System, in: 

Buf f eredReader in; // Buf f eredReader for reading from standard input, 
in = new Buf f eredReader ( new InputStreamReader ( System. in ) ); 
try { 

String line = in. readLine () ; 
while ( line != null ) { 

processOneLineOf Input ( line ); 

line = in. readLine () ; 

} 

} 

catch (IOException e) { 
} 

This code segment reads and processes lines from standard input until an end-of-stream is 
encountered. (An end-of-stream is possible even for interactive input. For example, on at least 
some computers, typing a Control-D generates an end-of-stream on the standard input stream.) 
The try . . catch statement is necessary because the readLine method can throw an exception of 
type IOException, which requires mandatory exception handling; an alternative to try. . catch 
would be to declare that the method that contains the code "throws IOException". Also, 
remember that BuFFeredReader, InputStreamReader, and IOException must be imported from the 
package java.io. 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



530 



* * * 

Previously in this book, we have used the non-standard class TextIO for input both from 
users and from files. The advantage of TextIO is that it makes it fairly easy to read data values 
of any of the primitive types. Disadvantages include the fact that TextIO can only read from 
one file at a time, that it can't do I/O operations on network connections, and that it does not 
follow the same pattern as Java's built-in input/output classes. 

I have written a class named TextReader to fix some of these disadvantages, while providing 
input capabilities similar to those of TextIO. Like TextIO, TextReader is a non-standard class, 
so you have to be careful to make it available to any program that uses it. The source code for 
the class can be found in the file TextReader.java. 

Just as for many of Java's stream classes, an object of type TextReader can be used as a 
wrapper for an existing input stream, which becomes the source of the characters that will 
be read by the TextReader. (Unlike the standard classes, however, a TextReader is not itself a 
stream and cannot be wrapped inside other stream classes.) The constructors 

public TextReader (Reader characterSource) 

and 

public TextReader (InputStream byteSource) 

create objects that can be used to read human-readable data from the given Reader or In- 
putStream using the convenient input methods of the TextReader class. In TextIO, the input 
methods were static members of the class. The input methods in the TextReader class are 
instance methods. The instance methods in a TextReader object read from the data source that 
was specified in the object's constructor. This makes it possible for several TextReader objects 
to exist at the same time, reading from different streams; those objects can then be used to 
read data from several files or other input sources at the same time. 

A TextReader object has essentially the same set of input methods as the TextIO class. 
One big difference is how errors are handled. When a TextReader encounters an error in the 
input, it throws an exception of type lOException. This follows the standard pattern that is 
used by Java's standard input streams. lOExceptions require mandatory exception handling, 
so TextReader methods are generally called inside try. .catch statements. If an lOException 
is thrown by the input stream that is wrapped inside a TextReader, that lOException is simply 
passed along. However, other types of errors can also occur. One such possible error is an 
attempt to read data from the input stream when there is no more data left in the stream. A 
TextReader throws an exception of type TextReader. EndOfStream Exception when this happens. 
The exception class in this case is a nested class in the TextReader class; it is a subclass of 
lOException, so a try. .catch statement that handles lOExceptions will also handle end-of- 
stream exceptions. However, having a class to represent end-of-stream errors makes it possible 
to detect such errors and provide special handling for them. Another type of error occurs 
when a TextReader tries to read a data value of a certain type, and the next item in the input 
stream is not of the correct type. In this case, the TextReader throws an exception of type 
TextReader. BadDataException, which is another subclass of lOException. 

For reference, here is a list of some of the more useful instance methods in the TextReader 
class. All of these methods can throw exceptions of type lOException: 

• public char peek() — looks ahead at the next character in the input stream, and returns 
that character. The character is not removed from the stream. If the next character is an 
end-of-line, the return value is '\n'. It is legal to call this method even if there is no more 
data left in the stream; in that case, the return value is the constant TextReader . EOF. 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



531 



("EOF" stands for "End-Of-File," a term that is more commonly used than "End-Of- 
Stream", even though not all streams are files.) 

• public boolean eoln() and public boolean eof() — convenience methods for testing 
whether the next thing in the file is an end-of-line or an end-of-file. Note that these 
methods do not skip whitespace. If eof () is false, you know that there is still at least 
one character to be read, but there might not be any more non-blank characters in the 
stream. 

• public void skipBlanksQ and public void skipWhiteSpaceO — skip past whites- 
pace characters in the input stream; skipWhiteSpaceO skips all whitespace characters, 
including end-of-line while skipBlanksO only skips spaces and tabs. 

• public String getln() — reads characters up to the next end-of-line (or end-of-stream) , 
and returns those characters in a string. The end-of-line marker is read but is not part of 
the returned string. This will throw an exception if there are no more characters in the 
stream. 

• public char getAnyCharQ — reads and returns the next character from the stream. 
The character can be a whitespace character such as a blank or end-of-line. If this method 
is called after all the characters in the stream have been read, an exception is thrown. 

• public int getlnlntO, public double getlnDoubleO , public char getlnChar () , 
etc. — skip any whitespace characters in the stream, including end-of-lines, then read a 
value of the specified type, which will be the return value of the method. Any remaining 
characters on the line are then discarded, including the end-of-line marker. There is a 
method for each primitive type. An exception occurs if it's not possible to read a data 
value of the requested type. 

• public int getlnt (), public double getDoubleQ, public char getCharO, etc. - 
skip any whitespace characters in the stream, including end-of-lines, then read and return 
a value of the specified type. Extra characters on the line are not discarded and are still 
available to be read by subsequent input methods. There is a method for each primitive 
type. An exception occurs if it's not possible to read a data value of the requested type. 

11.1.5 The Scanner Class 

Since its introduction, Java has been notable for its lack of built-in support for basic input, 
and for its reliance on fairly advanced techniques for the support that it does offer. (This is my 
opinion, at least.) The Scanner class was introduced in Java 5.0 to make it easier to read basic 
data types from a character input source. It does not (again, in my opinion) solve the problem 
completely, but it is a big improvement. The Scanner class is in the package java.util. 

Input routines are defined as instance methods in the Scanner class, so to use the class, you 
need to create a Scanner object. The constructor specifies the source of the characters that the 
Scanner will read. The scanner acts as a wrapper for the input source. The source can be a 
Reader, an InputStream, a String, or a File. (If a String is used as the input source, the Scanner 
will simply read the characters in the string from beginning to end, in the same way that it 
would process the same sequence of characters from a stream. The File class will be covered in 
the next section.) For example, you can use a Scanner to read from standard input by saying: 

Scanner standardlnputScanner = new Scanner ( System. in ); 

and if charSource is of type Reader, you can create a Scanner for reading from charSource 
with: 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



532 



Scanner scanner = new Scanner ( charSource ); 

When processing input, a scanner usually works with tokens. A token is a meaningful 
string of characters that cannot, for the purposes at hand, be further broken down into smaller 
meaningful pieces. A token can, for example, be an individual word or a string of characters 
that represents a value of type double. In the case of a scanner, tokens must be separated by 
"delimiters." By default, the delimiters are whitespace characters such as spaces and end-of- 
line markers, but you can change a Scanner's delimiters if you need to. In normal processing, 
whitespace characters serve simply to separate tokens and are discarded by the scanner. A 
scanner has instance methods for reading tokens of various types. Suppose that scanner is an 
object of type Scanner. Then we have: 

• scanner. next () — reads the next token from the input source and returns it as a String. 

• scanner. nextlnt(), scanner. nextDoubleO, and so on — reads the next token from the 
input source and tries to convert it to a value of type int, double, and so on. There are 
methods for reading values of any of the primitive types. 

• scanner .nextLineO — reads an entire line from the input source, up to the next end- 
of-line and returns the line as a value of type String. The end-of-line marker is read but 
is not part of the return value. Note that this method is not based on tokens. An entire 
line is read and returned, including any whitespace characters in the line. 

All of these methods can generate exceptions. If an attempt is made to read past the 
end of input, an exception of type NoSuchElementException is thrown. Methods such as 
scanner . get Int () will throw an exception of type InputMismatchException if the next to- 
ken in the input does not represent a value of the requested type. The exceptions that can be 
generated do not require mandatory exception handling. 

The Scanner class has very nice look-ahead capabilities. You can query a scanner to de- 
termine whether more tokens are available and whether the next token is of a given type. If 
scanner is of type Scanner: 

• scanner .hasNextO — returns a boolean value that is true if there is at least one more 
token in the input source. 

• scanner. hasNextlnt () , scanner. hasNextDouble () , and so on — returns a boolean 
value that is true if there is at least one more token in the input source and that token 
represents a value of the requested type. 

• scanner .hasNextLineO — returns a boolean value that is true if there is at least one 
more line in the input source. 

Although the insistence on defining tokens only in terms of delimiters limits the usability 
of scanners to some extent, they are easy to use and are suitable for many applications. With 
so many input classes available — Buffered Reader, TextReader, Scanner — you might have trouble 
deciding which one to use! In general, I would recommend using a Scanner unless you have some 
particular reason for preferring the 7exr/0-style input routines of TextReader. BufferedReader 
can be used as a lightweight alternative when all that you want to do is read entire lines of text 
from the input source. 

11.1.6 Serialized Object I/O 

The classes PrintWriter, TextReader, Scanner, DatalnputStream, and DataOutputStream allow 
you to easily input and output all of Java's primitive data types. But what happens when you 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



533 



want to read and write objects? Traditionally, you would have to come up with some way of 
encoding your object as a sequence of data values belonging to the primitive types, which can 
then be output as bytes or characters. This is called serializing the object. On input, you 
have to read the serialized data and somehow reconstitute a copy of the original object. For 
complex objects, this can all be a major chore. However, you can get Java to do all the work 
for you by using the classes ObjectlnputStream and ObjectOutputStream. These are subclasses 
of InputStream and OutputStream that can be used for writing and reading serialized objects. 

ObjectlnputStream and ObjectOutputStream are wrapper classes that can be wrapped around 
arbitrary InputStreams and OutputStreams. This makes it possible to do object input and output 
on any byte stream. The methods for object I/O are readObject () , in ObjectlnputStream, 
and writeObject (Object obj), in ObjectOutputStream. Both of these methods can throw 
lOExceptions. Note that readObject () returns a value of type Object, which generally has to 
be type-cast to the actual type of the object that was read. 

ObjectOutputStream also has methods writelntO, writeDouble () , and so on, for out- 
putting primitive type values to the stream, and ObjectlnputStream has corresponding methods 
for reading primitive type values. These primitive type values can be interspersed with objects 
in the data. 

Object streams are byte streams. The objects are represented in binary, machine-readable 
form. This is good for efficiency, but it does suffer from the fragility that is often seen in 
binary data. They suffer from the additional problem that the binary format of Java objects is 
very specific to Java, so the data in object streams is not easily available to programs written 
in other programming languages. For these reasons, object streams are appropriate mostly 
for short-term storage of objects and for transmitting objects over a network connection from 
one Java program to another. For long-term storage and for communication with non-Java 
programs, other approaches to object serialization are usually better. (See Subsection 11.5.2 
for a character-based approach.) 

ObjectlnputStream and ObjectOutputStream only work with objects that implement an in- 
terface named Serializable. Furthermore, all of the instance variables in the object must be 
serializable. However, there is little work involved in making an object serializable, since the 
Serializable interface does not declare any methods. It exists only as a marker for the compiler, 
to tell it that the object is meant to be writable and readable. You only need to add the words 
"implements Serializable" to your class definitions. Many of Java's standard classes are 
already declared to be serializable, including all the component classes and many other classes 
in Swing and in the AWT. One of the programming examples in Section 11.3 uses object 10. 

One warning about using ObjectOutputStreams: These streams are optimized to avoid writ- 
ing the same object more than once. When an object is encountered for a second time, only 
a reference to the first occurrence is written. Unfortunately, if the object has been modified 
in the meantime, the new data will not be written. Because of this, ObjectOutputStreams are 
meant mainly for use with "immutable" objects that can't be changed after they are created. 
(Strings are an example of this.) However, if you do need to write mutable objects to an Ob- 
jectOutputStream, you can ensure that the full, correct version of the object can be written by 
calling the stream's reset () method before writing the object to the stream. 

11.2 Files 

The data and PROGRAMS in a computer's main memory survive only as long as the power is (online) 
on. For more permanent storage, computers use files, which are collections of data stored on 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



534 



a hard disk, on a USB memory stick, on a CD-ROM, or on some other type of storage device. 
Files are organized into directories (sometimes called folders). A directory can hold other 
directories, as well as files. Both directories and files have names that are used to identify them. 

Programs can read data from existing files. They can create new files and can write data 
to files. In Java, such input and output can be done using streams. Human-readable character 
data is read from a file using an object belonging to the class FileReader, which is a subclass of 
Reader. Similarly, data is written to a file in human-readable format through an object of type 
FileWriter, a subclass of Writer. For files that store data in machine format, the appropriate I/O 
classes are FilelnputStream and FileOutputStream. In this section, I will only discuss character- 
oriented file I/O using the FileReader and FileWriter classes. However, FilelnputStream and 
FileOutputStream are used in an exactly parallel fashion. All these classes are defined in the 
java.io package. 

It's worth noting right at the start that applets which are downloaded over a network 
connection are not ordinarily allowed to access files. This is a security consideration. You can 
download and run an applet just by visiting a Web page with your browser. If downloaded 
applets had access to the files on your computer, it would be easy to write an applet that would 
destroy all the data on any computer that downloads it. To prevent such possibilities, there 
are a number of things that downloaded applets are not allowed to do. Accessing files is one of 
those forbidden things. Standalone programs written in Java, however, have the same access 
to your files as any other program. When you write a standalone Java application, you can use 
all the file operations described in this section. 

11.2.1 Reading and Writing Files 

The FileReader class has a constructor which takes the name of a file as a parameter and 
creates an input stream that can be used for reading from that file. This constructor will throw 
an exception of type FileNot Found Exception if the file doesn't exist. It requires mandatory 
exception handling, so you have to call the constructor in a try. . catch statement (or inside a 
routine that is declared to throw the exception). For example, suppose you have a file named 
"data . txt" , and you want your program to read data from that file. You could do the following 
to create an input stream for the file: 

FileReader data; // (Declare the variable before the 

// try statement, or else the variable 

// is local to the try block and you won't 

// be able to use it later in the program.) 

try { 

data = new FileReader ("data. txt" ) ; // create the stream 

} 

catch (FileNotFoundException e) { 

... // do something to handle the error maybe, end the program 

} 

The FileNotFoundException class is a subclass of lOException, so it would be acceptable to 
catch lOExceptions in the above try. . .catch statement. More generally, just about any error 
that can occur during input/output operations can be caught by a catch clause that handles 
lOException. 

Once you have successfully created a FileReader, you can start reading data from it. But 
since FileReaders have only the primitive input methods inherited from the basic Reader class, 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



535 



you will probably want to wrap your FileReader in a Scanner, in a TextReader, or in some 
other wrapper class. (The TextReader class is not a standard part of Java; it is described 
in Subsection 11.1.4. Scanner is discussed in Subsection 11.1.5.) To create a TextReader for 
reading from a file named data.dat, you could say: 

TextReader data; 

try { 

data = new TextReader( new FileReaderCdata.dat") ); 

} 

catch (FileNotFoundException e) { 
... // handle the exception 

} 

To use a Scanner to read from the file, you can construct the scanner in a similar way. However, 
it is more common to construct it from an object of type File (to be covered below): 

Scanner in; 
try { 

in = new Scanner( new File ("data.dat") ); 

} 

catch (FileNotFoundException e) { 
... // handle the exception 

} 

Once you have a Scanner or TextReader for reading from a file, you can get data from the file 
using exactly the same methods that work with any Scanner or TextReader. 

Working with output files is no more difficult than this. You simply create an object 
belonging to the class FileWriter. You will probably want to wrap this output stream in an object 
of type PrintWriter. For example, suppose you want to write data to a file named "result . dat" . 
Since the constructor for FileWriter can throw an exception of type lOException, you should use 
a try. .catch statement: 

PrintWriter result; 

try { 

result = new PrintWriter (new FileWriterCresult.dat")); 

} 

catch (lOException e) { 

... // handle the exception 

} 

If no file named result . dat exists, a new file will be created. If the file already exists, then 
the current contents of the file will be erased and replaced with the data that your program 
writes to the file. This will be done without any warning. To avoid overwriting a file that 
already exists, you can check whether a file of the same name already exists before trying 
to create the stream, as discussed later in this section. An lOException might occur in the 
PrintWriter constructor if, for example, you are trying to create a file on a disk that is "write- 
protected," meaning that it cannot be modified. 

In fact, a PrintWriter can also be created directly from a file name given as a string 
("new PrintWriter ("result .dat")"), and you will probably find it more convenient to do 
that. Remember, however, that a Scanner for reading from a file cannot be created in the 
same way. 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



536 



After you are finished using a file, it's a good idea to close the file, to tell the operating 
system that you are finished using it. You can close a file by calling the close () method of 
the associated stream or Scanner. Once a file has been closed, it is no longer possible to read 
data from it or write data to it, unless you open it again as a new stream. (Note that for 
most stream classes, the close () method can throw an lOException, which must be handled; 
however, PrintWriter, TextReader, and Scanner override this method so that it cannot throw 
such exceptions.) If you forget to close a file, the file will ordinarily be closed automatically 
when the program terminates or when the file object is garbage collected, but in the case of an 
output file, some of the data that has been written to the file might be lost. This can occur 
because data that is written to a file can be buffered; that is, the data is not sent immediately 
to the file but is retained in main memory (in a "buffer") until a larger chunk of data is ready 
to be written. This is done for efficiency. The close () method of an output stream will cause 
all the data in the buffer to be sent to the file. Every output stream also has a f lush() method 
that can be called to force any data in the buffer to be written to the file without closing the 
file. 

As a complete example, here is a program that will read numbers from a file named 
data.dat, and will then write out the same numbers in reverse order to another file named 
result.dat. It is assumed that data.dat contains only one number on each line. Exception- 
handling is used to check for problems along the way. Although the application is not a 
particularly useful one, this program demonstrates the basics of working with files. (By the 
way, at the end of this program, you'll find our first useful example of a finally clause in a 
try statement. When the computer executes a try statement, the commands in its finally 
clause are guaranteed to be executed, no matter what. See Subsection 8.3.2.) 

import java.io.*; 

import java.util.ArrayList; 

/** 

* Reads numbers from a file named data.dat and writes them to a file 

* named result.dat in reverse order. The input file should contain 

* exactly one real number per line. 
*/ 

public class ReverseFile { 

public static void main(String[] args) { 

TextReader data; // Character input stream for reading data. 

PrintWriter result; // Character output stream for writing data. 

ArrayList<Double> numbers; // An ArrayList for holding the data. 

numbers = new ArrayList<Double> () ; 

try { // Create the input stream. 

data = new TextReader (new FileReaderC data.dat")) ; 

} 

catch (FileNotFoundException e) { 

System. out .println( "Can't find file data.dat!"); 
return; // End the program by returning from mainO . 

} 

try { // Create the output stream. 

result = new PrintWriter (new FileWriter ("result . dat") ) ; 

} 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



537 



catch (IDException e) { 

System. out .println(" Can't open file result.dat!"); 
System. out .println( "Error : " + e) ; 
data. closeO ; // Close the input file, 
return; // End the program. 

} 

try { 

// Read numbers from the input file, adding them to the ArrayList. 

while ( data.eofO == false ) { // Read until end-of-file. 
double inputNumber = data.getlnDoubleO ; 
numbers . add ( inputNumber ) ; 

} 

// Output the numbers in reverse order. 

for (int i = numbers . size () -1 ; i >= 0; i — ) 
result . println (numbers . get (i) ) ; 

System. out .printlnC'Done ! ") ; 

} 

catch (IOException e) { 

// Some problem reading the data from the input file. 
System, out .printlnC Input Error: " + e.getMessageO) ; 

} 

finally { 

// Finish by closing the files, whatever else may have happened. 
data.closeO ; 
result . close () ; 

} 

} // end of mainO 

} // end class ReverseFile 

A version of this program that uses a Scanner instead of a TextReader can be found 
in ReverseFileWithScanner.java. Note that the Scanner version does not need the final 
try. .catch from the TextReader version, since the Scanner method for reading data doesn't 
throw an IOException. 

11.2.2 Files and Directories 

The subject of file names is actually more complicated than I've let on so far. To fully specify 
a file, you have to give both the name of the file and the name of the directory where that 
file is located. A simple file name like "data.dat" or "result.dat" is taken to refer to a file in 
a directory that is called the current directory (also known as the "default directory" or 
"working directory"). The current directory is not a permanent thing. It can be changed by 
the user or by a program. Files not in the current directory must be referred to by a path 
name, which includes both the name of the file and information about the directory where it 
can be found. 

To complicate matters even further, there are two types of path names, absolute path 
names and relative path names. An absolute path name uniquely identifies one file among 
all the files available to the computer. It contains full information about which directory the 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



538 



file is in and what the file's name is. A relative path name tells the computer how to locate the 
file starting from the current directory. 

Unfortunately, the syntax for file names and path names varies somewhat from one type of 
computer to another. Here are some examples: 

• data.dat — on any computer, this would be a file named "data.dat" in the current 
directory. 

• /home/eck/java/examples/data.dat — This is an absolute path name in a UNIX op- 
erating system, including Linux and Mac OS X. It refers to a file named data.dat in a 
directory named examples, which is in turn in a directory named java, .... 

• C:\eck\java\examples\data.dat — An absolute path name on a Windows computer. 

• Hard Drive: java: examples: data.dat — Assuming that "Hard Drive" is the name of a 
disk drive, this would be an absolute path name on a computer using a classic Macintosh 
operating system such as Mac OS 9. 

• examples/data. dat — a relative path name under UNIX, "examples" is the name of a 
directory that is contained within the current directory, and data.dat is a file in that direc- 
tory. The corresponding relative path name for Windows would be examples\data.dat. 

• . . /examples/data. dat — a relative path name in UNIX that means "go to the directory 
that contains the current directory, then go into a directory named examples inside that 
directory, and look there for a file named data. data." In general, ". ." means "go up one 
directory." 

It's reasonably safe to say, though, that if you stick to using simple file names only, and if the 
files are stored in the same directory with the program that will use them, then you will be 
OK. Later in this section, we'll look at a convenient way of letting the user specify a file in a 
GUI program, which allows you to avoid the issue of path names altogether. 

It is possible for a Java program to find out the absolute path names for two important 
directories, the current directory and the user's home directory. The names of these directories 
are system properties, and they can be read using the function calls: 

• System. getProperty( "user .dir") - - returns the absolute path name of the current 
directory as a String. 

• System. getProperty ( "user .home") — returns the absolute path name of the user's home 
directory as a String. 

To avoid some of the problems caused by differences in path names between platforms, Java 
has the class java. io.File. An object belonging to this class represents a file. More precisely, 
an object of type File represents a file name rather than a file as such. The file to which the 
name refers might or might not exist. Directories are treated in the same way as files, so a File 
object can represent a directory just as easily as it can represent a file. 

A File object has a constructor, "new File (String)", that creates a File object from a path 
name. The name can be a simple name, a relative path, or an absolute path. For example, 
new File ("data, dat") creates a File object that refers to a file named data.dat, in the current 
directory. Another constructor, "new File (File, String)", has two parameters. The first is a 
File object that refers to the directory that contains the file. The second can be the name of 
the file or a relative path from the directory to the file. 

File objects contain several useful instance methods. Assuming that file is a variable of 
type File, here are some of the methods that are available: 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



539 



• file . exists () — This boolean-valued function returns true if the file named by the 
File object already exists. You can use this method if you want to avoid overwriting the 
contents of an existing file when you create a new FileWriter. 

• f ile . isDirectory () — This boolean-valued function returns true if the File object 
refers to a directory. It returns false if it refers to a regular file or if no file with the given 
name exists. 

• file . delete () — Deletes the file, if it exists. Returns a boolean value to indicate whether 
the file was successfully deleted. 

• file. list () — If the File object refers to a directory, this function returns an array of 
type String [] containing the names of the files in that directory. Otherwise, it returns 
null, f ile . listFiles () is similar, except that it returns an array of File instead of an 
array of String 

Here, for example, is a program that will list the names of all the files in a directory specified 
by the user. In this example, I have used a Scanner to read the user's input: 

import java. io .File ; 
import java. util. Scanner; 

/** 

* This program lists the files in a directory specified by 

* the user. The user is asked to type in a directory name. 

* If the name entered by the user is not a directory, a 

* message is printed and the program ends. 
*/ 

public class DirectoryList { 

public static void main(String [] args) { 

String directoryName ; // Directory name entered by the user. 

File directory; // File object referring to the directory. 

String [] files; // Array of file names in the directory. 

Scanner scanner; // For reading a line of input from the user. 

scanner = new Scanner (System. in) ; // scanner reads from standard input. 

System. out .print ("Enter a directory name: "); 
directoryName = scanner .nextLineO .trimO ; 
directory = new File (directoryName) ; 

if (directory. isDirectory () == false) { 
if (directory . exists () == false) 

System. out .println( "There is no such directory!"); 
else 

System. out .println( "That file is not a directory."); 

> 

else { 

files = directory . list () ; 

System. out .println( "Files in directory \"" + directory + "\":"); 
for (int i = 0; i < files . length; i++) 
System, out .printlnC " + files [i] ) ; 

} 

} // end mainO 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



540 



} // end class DirectoryList 

All the classes that are used for reading data from files and writing data to files have 
constructors that take a File object as a parameter. For example, if file is a variable of type 
File, and you want to read character data from that file, you can create a FileReader to do so 
by saying new FileReader (file) . 

11.2.3 File Dialog Boxes 

In many programs, you want the user to be able to select the file that is going to be used for 
input or output. If your program lets the user type in the file name, you will just have to 
assume that the user understands how to work with files and directories. But in a graphical 
user interface, the user expects to be able to select files using a file dialog box, which is a 
window that a program can open when it wants the user to select a file for input or output. 
Swing includes a platform-independent technique for using file dialog boxes in the form of a 
class called JFileChooser. This class is part of the package j avax . swing. We looked at using 
some basic dialog boxes in Subsection 6.8.2. File dialog boxes are similar to those, but are a 
little more complicated to use. 

A file dialog box shows the user a list of files and sub-directories in some directory, and makes 
it easy for the user to specify a file in that directory. The user can also navigate easily from 
one directory to another. The most common constructor for JFileChooser has no parameter 
and sets the starting directory in the dialog box to be the user's home directory. There are also 
constructors that specify the starting directory explicitly: 
new JFileChooser ( File startDirectory ) 

new JFileChooser ( String pathToStartDirectory ) 

Constructing a JFileChooser object does not make the dialog box appear on the screen. 
You have to call a method in the object to do that. There are two different methods that 
can be used because there are two types of file dialog: An open file dialog allows the user 
to specify an existing file to be opened for reading data into the program; a save file dialog 
lets the user specify a file, which might or might not already exist, to be opened for writing 
data from the program. File dialogs of these two types are opened using the showOpenDialog 
and showSaveDialog methods. These methods make the dialog box appear on the screen; the 
methods do not return until the user selects a file or cancels the dialog. 

A file dialog box always has a parent, another component which is associated with the 
dialog box. The parent is specified as a parameter to the showOpenDialog or showSaveDialog 
methods. The parent is a GUI component, and can often be specified as "this" in prac- 
tice, since file dialogs are often used in instance methods of GUI component classes. (The 
parameter can also be null, in which case an invisible component is created to be used 
as the parent.) Both showOpenDialog and showSaveDialog have a return value, which 
will be one of the constants JFileChooser . CANCELJDPTION, JFileChooser . ERROR-OPTION, or 
JFileChooser . APPR0VE_0PTI0N. If the return value is JFileChooser . APPR0VE_0PTI0N, then 
the user has selected a file. If the return value is something else, then the user did not select a 
file. The user might have clicked a "Cancel" button, for example. You should always check the 
return value, to make sure that the user has, in fact, selected a file. If that is the case, then you 
can find out which file was selected by calling the JFileChooser's getSelectedFile () method, 
which returns an object of type File that represents the selected file. 

Putting all this together, we can look at a typical subroutine that reads data from a file 
that is selected using a JFileChooser: 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



541 



public void readFileO { 

if (fileDialog == null) // (fileDialog is an instance variable) 

fileDialog = new JFileChooser () ; 
fileDialog. setDialogTitleO'Select File for Reading"); 
fileDialog. setSelectedFile(null) ; // No file is initially selected, 
int option = fileDialog. showOpenDialog(this) ; 

// (Using "this" as a parameter to showOpenDialogO assumes that the 
// readFileO method is an instance method in a GUI component class.) 
if (option != JFileChooser . APPROVEJDPTION) 

return; // User canceled or clicked the dialog's close box. 
File selectedFile = fileDialog. getSelectedFile () ; 
TextReader in; // (or use some other wrapper class) 
try { 

FileReader stream = new FileReader (selectedFile) ; // (or a FilelnputStream) 
in = new TextReader ( stream ); 

} 

catch (Exception e) { 

JOptionPane . showMessageDialog(this , 

"Sorry, but an error occurred while trying to open the file:\n" + e) ; 
return; 

} 

try { 

// Read and process the data from the input stream, in. 
in. closeO ; 

} 

catch (Exception e) { 

JOptionPane . showMessageDialog(this , 

"Sorry, but an error occurred while trying to read the data:\n" + e) ; 

> 

} 

One fine point here is that the variable fileDialog is an instance variable of type JFileChooser. 
This allows the file dialog to continue to exist between calls to readFileO . The main effect of 
this is that the dialog box will keep the same selected directory from one call of readFileO 
to the next. When the dialog reappears, it will show the same directory that the user selected 
the previous time it appeared. This is probably what the user expects. 

Note that it's common to do some configuration of a JFileChooser before 
calling showOpenDialog or showSaveDialog. For example, the instance method 
setDialogTitle (String) is used to specify a title to appear in the title bar of the window. 
And setSelectedFile(File) is used to set the file that is selected in the dialog box when 
it appears. This can be used to provide a default file choice for the user. In the readFileO 
method, above, fileDialog. setSelectedFile (null) specifies that no file is pre-selected when 
the dialog box appears. 

Writing data to a file is similar, but it's a good idea to add a check to determine whether 
the output file that is selected by the user already exists. In that case, ask the user whether to 
replace the file. Here is a typical subroutine for writing to a user-selected file: 

public void writeFileO ■[ 
if (fileDialog == null) 

fileDialog = new JFileChooser () ; // (fileDialog is an instance variable)

The readFileO and writeFileO routines presented here can be used, with just a few 
changes, when you need to read or write a file in a GUI program. We'll look at some more 
complete examples of using files and file dialogs in the next section. 

11.3 Programming With Files 



In THIS SECTION, we look at several programming examples that work with files, using the (online) 
techniques that were introduced in Section 11.1 and Section 11.2. 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



543 



11.3.1 Copying a File 

As a first example, we look at a simple command-line program that can make a copy of a 
file. Copying a file is a pretty common operation, and every operating system already has a 
command for doing it. However, it is still instructive to look at a Java program that does the 
same thing. Many file operations are similar to copying a file, except that the data from the 
input file is processed in some way before it is written to the output file. All such operations 
can be done by programs with the same general form. 

Since the program should be able to copy any file, we can't assume that the data in the 
file is in human-readable form. So, we have to use InputStream and OutputStream to operate 
on the file rather than Reader and Writer. The program simply copies all the data from the 
InputStream to the OutputStream, one byte at a time. If source is the variable that refers to 
the InputStream, then the function source . read() can be used to read one byte. This function 
returns the value -1 when all the bytes in the input file have been read. Similarly, if copy refers 
to the OutputStream, then copy. write (b) writes one byte to the output file. So, the heart of 
the program is a simple while loop. As usual, the I/O operations can throw exceptions, so this 
must be done in a try. .catch statement: 

while (true) { 

int data = source . readO ; 
if (data < 0) 

break; 
copy. write (data) ; 

} 

The file-copy command in an operating system such as UNIX uses command line argu- 
ments to specify the names of the files. For example, the user might say "copy original.dat 
backup.dat" to copy an existing file, original.dat, to a file named backup.dat. Command- 
line arguments can also be used in Java programs. The command line arguments are stored in 
the array of strings, args, which is a parameter to the main() routine. The program can retrieve 
the command-line arguments from this array. (See Subsection 7.2.3.) For example, if the pro- 
gram is named CopyFile and if the user runs the program with the command "java CopyFile 
work.dat oldwork.dat", then in the program, args [0] will be the string "work.dat" and 
args[l] will be the string "oldwork.dat". The value of args. length tells the program how 
many command-line arguments were specified by the user. 

My CopyFile program gets the names of the files from the command-line arguments. It 
prints an error message and exits if the file names are not specified. To add a little interest, 
there are two ways to use the program. The command line can simply specify the two file names. 
In that case, if the output file already exists, the program will print an error message and end. 
This is to make sure that the user won't accidently overwrite an important file. However, if the 
command line has three arguments, then the first argument must be "-f " while the second and 
third arguments are file names. The -f is a command-line option, which is meant to modify 
the behavior of the program. The program interprets the -f to mean that it's OK to overwrite 
an existing program. (The "f ' stands for "force," since it forces the file to be copied in spite of 
what would otherwise have been considered an error.) You can see in the source code how the 
command line arguments are interpreted by the program: 

import java.io.*; 

/** 

* Makes a copy of a file. The original file and the name of the 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



544 



* copy must be given as command-line arguments. In addition, the 

* first command-line argument can be "-f"; if present, the program 

* will overwrite an existing file; if not, the program will report 

* an error and end if the output file already exists. The number 

* of bytes that are copied is reported. 
*/ 

public class CopyFile { 

public static void main(String[] args) { 

String sourceName; // Name of the source file, 

// as specified on the command line. 

String copyName; // Name of the copy, 

// as specified on the command line. 

InputStream source; // Stream for reading from the source file. 

OutputStream copy; // Stream for writing the copy. 

boolean force; // This is set to true if the "-f" option 
// is specified on the command line. 

int byteCount; // Number of bytes copied from the source file. 

/* Get file names from the command line and check for the 

presence of the -f option. If the command line is not one 
of the two possible legal forms, print an error message and 
end this program. */ 

if (args. length == 3 && args [0] . equalsIgnoreCase ("-f " ) ) { 
sourceName = args [1] ; 
copyName = args [2] ; 
force = true; 

} 

else if (args. length == 2) { 
sourceName = args [0] ; 
copyName = args [1] ; 
force = false; 

} 

else { 

System. out .println( 

"Usage: java CopyFile <source-f ile> <copy-name>") ; 
System. out .println( 

" or java CopyFile -f <source-f ile> <copy-name>") ; 

return ; 

} 

/* Create the input stream. If an error occurs, end the program. */ 
try { 

source = new FilelnputStream(sourceName) ; 

} 

catch (FileNotFoundException e) { 

System. out. println(" Can't find file \"" + sourceName + "\"."); 
return ; 

} 

/* If the output file already exists and the -f option was not 
specified, print an error message and end the program. */ 

File file = new File (copyName) ; 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



545 



if (file . exists () && force == false) { 
System. out . println( 

"Output file exists. Use the -f option to replace it."); 
return; 

} 

/* Create the output stream. If an error occurs, end the program. */ 
try { 

copy = new FileOutputStream(copyName) ; 

} 

catch (IOException e) { 

System. out .println(" Can't open output file \"" + copyName + "\"."); 
return ; 

} 

/* Copy one byte at a time from the input stream to the output 
stream, ending when the readO method returns -1 (which is 
the signal that the end of the stream has been reached) . If any 
error occurs, print an error message. Also print a message if 
the file has been copied successfully. */ 

byteCount = 0; 

try { 

while (true) { 

int data = source .readO ; 
if (data < 0) 

break; 
copy. write (data) ; 
byteCount++; 

} 

source . close () ; 
copy . close () ; 

System. out .printlnC'Successfully copied " + byteCount + " bytes."); 

} 

catch (Exception e) { 

System. out .println( "Error occurred while copying. " 

+ byteCount + " bytes copied."); 
System. out .println( "Error : " + e) ; 

} 

} // end mainO 



} // end class CopyFile 

It is not terribly efficient to copy one byte at a time. Efficiency could be improved by using 
alternative versions of the readO and write () methods that read and write multiple bytes (see 
the API for details). Alternatively, the input and output streams could be wrapped in objects of 
type BufFeredlnputStream and BufFeredOutputStream which automatically read from and write 
data to files in larger blocks, which is more efficient than reading and writing individual bytes.

11.3.2 Persistent Data 

Once a program ends, any data that was stored in variables and objects in the program is gone. 
In many cases, it would be useful to have some of that data stick around so that it will be 
available when the program is run again. The problem is, how to make the data persistent 
between runs of the program? The answer, of course, is to store the data in a file (or, for some 
applications, in a database — but the data in a database is itself stored in files). 

Consider a "phone book" program that allows the user to keep track of a list of names and 
associated phone numbers. The program would make no sense at all if the user had to create 
the whole list from scratch each time the program is run. It would make more sense to think of 
the phone book as a persistent collection of data, and to think of the program as an interface to 
that collection of data. The program would allow the user to look up names in the phone book 
and to add new entries. Any changes that are made should be preserved after the program 
ends. 

The sample program PhoneDirectoryFileDemo.java is a very simple implementation of this 
idea. It is meant only as an example of file use; the phone book that it implements is a "toy" 
version that is not meant to be taken seriously. This program stores the phone book data in a 
file named ".phone_book_demo" in the user's home directory. To find the user's home directory, 
it uses the System. getProperty () method that was mentioned in Subsection 11.2.2. When 
the program starts, it checks whether the file already exists. If it does, it should contain the 
user's phone book, which was saved in a previous run of the program, so the data from the file 
is read and entered into a TreeMap named phoneBook that represents the phone book while 
the program is running. (See Subsection 10.3.1.) In order to store the phone book in a file, 
some decision must be made about how the data in the phone book will be represented. For 
this example, I chose a simple representation in which each line of the file contains one entry 
consisting of a name and the associated phone number. A percent sign ('%') separates the 
name from the number. The following code at the beginning of the program will read the 
phone book data file, if it exists and has the correct format: 

File userHomeDirectory = new File( System. getProperty ("user .home") ); 
File dataFile = new File( userHomeDirectory, " .phone_book_data" ); 

if ( ! dataFile . exists () ) { 

System. out .println( "No phone book data file found."); 

System. out .println( "A new one will be created."); 

System. out .println( "File name: " + dataFile . getAbsolutePathO ) ; 

} 

else { 

System. out .println( "Reading phone book data..."); 
try { 

Scanner scanner = new Scanner ( dataFile ); 
while (scanner. hasNextLine () ) { 

// Read one line from the file, containing one name/number pair. 

String phoneEntry = scanner .nextLineO ; 

int separatorPosition = phoneEntry . indexOf ( ''/,' ) ; 

if (separatorPosition == -1) 

throw new IOExceptionC'File is not a phonebook data file."); 

name = phoneEntry. substring (0, separatorPosition); 

number = phoneEntry. substring (separatorPosition+1) ; 

phoneBook. put (name, number) ; 

} 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



547 



} 

catch (IOException e) { 

System. out .printlnC'Error in phone book data file."); 

System. out .printlnC'File name: " + dataFile . getAbsolutePathO ) ; 

System. out .printlnC'This program cannot continue."); 

System. exit (1) ; 

} 

} 

The program then lets the user do various things with the phone book, including making 
modifications. Any changes that are made are made only to the TreeMap that holds the data. 
When the program ends, the phone book data is written to the file (if any changes have been 
made while the program was running), using the following code: 

if (changed) { 

System. out .printlnC'Saving phone directory changes to file " + 

dataFile. getAbsolutePathO + " ..."); 
PrintWriter out; 
try { 

out = new PrintWriter( new FileWriter (dataFile) ); 

} 

catch (IOException e) { 

System. out .print In ("ERROR: Can't open data file for output."); 
return; 

} 

for ( Map.Entry<String,String> entry : phoneBook.entrySetO ) 
out .println (entry .getKeyO + + entry . get Value () ); 

out . close () ; 

if (out . checkError () ) 

System. out .print In ("ERROR: Some error occurred while writing data file."); 

else 

System. out .printlnC'Done . ") ; 

} 

The net effect of this is that all the data, including the changes, will be there the next time the 
program is run. I've shown you all the file-handling code from the program. If you would like 
to see the rest of the program, see the source code file, PhoneDirectoryFileDemo.java. 

11.3.3 Files in GUI Programs 

The previous examples in this section use a command-line interface, but graphical user interface 
programs can also manipulate files. Programs typically have an "Open" command that reads 
the data from a file and displays it in a window and a "Save" command that writes the data 
from the window into a file. We can illustrate this in Java with a simple text editor program, 
TrivialEdit.java. The window for this program uses a JTextArea component to display some 
text that the user can edit. It also has a menu bar, with a "File" menu that includes "Open" 
and "Save" commands. These commands are implemented using the techniques for reading and 
writing files that were covered in Section 11.2. 

When the user selects the Open command from the File menu in the TrivialEdit program, 
the program pops up a file dialog box where the user specifies the file. It is assumed that the 
file is a text file. A limit of 10000 characters is put on the size of the file, since a JTextArea 
is not meant for editing large amounts of text. The program reads the text contained in the 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



548 



specified file, and sets that text to be the content of the JTextArea. In this case, I decided to 
use a Buffered Reader to read the file line-by-line. The program also sets the title bar of the 
window to show the name of the file that was opened. All this is done in the following method, 
which is just a variation of the readFileO method presented in Section 11.2: 

/** 

* Carry out the Open command by letting the user specify a file to be opened 

* and reading up to 10000 characters from that file. If the file is read 

* successfully and is not too long, then the text from the file replaces the 

* text in the JTextArea. 
*/ 

public void doDpenO { 

if (fileDialog == null) 

fileDialog = new JFileChooser () ; 
fileDialog. setDialogTitleC'Select File to be Opened"); 
fileDialog. setSelectedFile (null) ; // No file is initially selected, 
int option = fileDialog. showOpenDialog(this) ; 
if (option != JFileChooser . APPROVEJDPTION) 

return; // User canceled or clicked the dialog's close box. 
File selectedFile = fileDialog. getSelectedFile () ; 
Buf f eredReader in; 
try { 

FileReader stream = new FileReader (selectedFile) ; 
in = new Buf f eredReader ( stream ); 

} 

catch (Exception e) { 

JOptionPane . showMessageDialog(this , 

"Sorry, but an error occurred while trying to open the file:\n" + e) ; 
return; 

} 

try { 

StringBuffer input = new StringBuf f er () ; 
while (true) { 

String lineFromFile = in.readLineO ; 
if (lineFromFile == null) 

break; // End-of-file has been reached, 
input . append (lineFromFile) ; 
input . append ( ' \n ' ) ; 
if (input. length () > 10000) 

throw new IOExceptionC'Input file is too large for this program."); 

} 

in.closeQ ; 

text . setText (input) ; 

editFile = selectedFile; 

setTitleC'TrivialEdit : " + editFile . getName ()) ; 

} 

catch (Exception e) { 

JOptionPane . showMessageDialog(this , 

"Sorry, but an error occurred while trying to read the data:\n" + e) ; 

> 

} 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



549 



In this program, the instance variable editFile is used to keep track of the file that is currently 
being edited, if any, and the setTitleQ method (from class JFrame) is used to set the title of 
the window to show the name of the file. 

Similarly, the response to the Save command is a minor variation on the writeFileO 
method from Section 11.2. I will not repeat it here. If you would like to see the entire program, 
you will find the source code in the file TrivialEdit.java. 

11.3.4 Storing Objects in Files 

Whenever data is stored in files, some definite format must be adopted for representing the 
data. As long as the output routine that writes the data and the input routine that reads the 
data use the same format, the files will be usable. However, as usual, correctness is not the 
end of the story. The representation that is used for data in files should also be robust. (See 
Section 8.1.) To see what this means, we will look at several different ways of representing the 
same data. This example builds on the example SimplePaint2.java from Subsection 7.3.4. In 
that program, the user could use the mouse to draw simple sketches. Now, we will add file 
input/output capabilities to that program. This will allow the user to save a sketch to a file 
and later read the sketch back from the file into the program so that the user can continue to 
work on the sketch. The basic requirement is that all relevant data about the sketch must be 
saved in the file, so that the sketch can be exactly restored when the file is read by the program. 

The new version of the program can be found in the source code file SimplePaintWithFiles.java. 
A "File" menu has been added to the new version. It contains two sets of Save/Open com- 
mands, one for saving and reloading sketch data in text form and one for data in binary form. 
We will consider both possibilities here, in some detail. 

The data for a sketch consists of the background color of the picture and a list of the curves 
that were drawn by the user. A curve consists of a list of Points. (Point is a standard class in 
package java.awt; a Point pt has instance variables pt.x and pt.y of type int that represent 
the coordinates of a point on the xy-plane.) Each curve can be a different color. Furthermore, 
a curve can be "symmetric," which means that in addition to the curve itself, the horizontal 
and vertical reflections of the curve are also drawn. The data for each curve is stored in an 
object of type CurveData, which is defined in the program as: 

/** 

* An object of type CurveData represents the data required to redraw one 

* of the curves that have been sketched by the user. 
*/ 

private static class CurveData implements Serializable { 
Color color; // The color of the curve. 

boolean symmetric; // Are horizontal and vertical reflections also drawn? 
ArrayList<Point> points; // The points on the curve. 

} 

Note that this class has been declared to "implement Serializable". This allows objects of 
type CurveData to be written in binary form to an ObjectOutputStream. See Subsection 11.1.6. 

Let's think about how the data for a sketch could be saved to an ObjectOuputStream. The 
sketch is displayed on the screen in an object of type SimplePaintPanel, which is a subclass of 
J Panel. All the data needed for the sketch is stored in instance variables of that object. One 
possibility would be to simply write the entire SimplePaintPanel component as a single object to 
the stream. This could be done in a method in the SimplePaintPanel class with the statement 

outputStream.writeObject(this) ; 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



550 



where outputStream is the ObjectOutputStream and "this" refers to the SimplePaintPanel 
itself. This statement saves the entire current state of the panel. To read the data back into 
the program, you would create an ObjectlnputStream for reading the object from the file, and 
you would retrieve the object from the file with the statement 

SimplePaintPanel newPanel = (SimplePaintPanel) in. readOb j ect () ; 

where in is the ObjectlnputStream. Note that the type-cast is necessary because the method 
in.readObjectO returns a value of type Object. (To get the saved sketch to appear on the 
screen, the newPanel must replace the current content pane in the program's window; further- 
more, the menu bar of the window must be replaced, because the menus are associated with a 
particular SimplePaintPanel object.) 

It might look tempting to be able to save data and restore it with a single command, but 
in this case, it's not a good idea. The main problem with doing things this way is that the 
serialized form of objects that represent Swing components can change from one 
version of Java to the next. This means that data files that contain serialized components such 
as a SimplePaintPanel might become unusable in the future, and the data that they contain will 
be effectively lost. This is an important consideration for any serious application. 

Taking this into consideration, my program uses a different format when it creates a binary 
file. The data written to the file consists of (1) the background color of the sketch, (2) the 
number of curves in the sketch, and (3) all the CurveData objects that describe the individual 
curves. The method that saves the data is similar to the writeFileO method from Subsec- 
tion 11.2.3. Here is the complete doSaveAsBinary () method from SimplePaintWithFiles, 
with the changes from the generic readFileQ method shown in italic: 

/** 

* Save the user's sketch to a file in binary form as serialized 

* objects, using an ObjectOutputStream. Files created by this method 

* can be read back into the program using the doOpenAsBinary () method. 
*/ 

private void doSaveAsBinary () { 
if (fileDialog == null) 

fileDialog = new JFileChooser () ; 
File selectedFile ; //Initially selected file name in the dialog. 
if (editFile == null) 

selectedFile = new FileC'sketchData. binary ") ; 
else 

selectedFile = new File(editFile. getNameO) ; 
fileDialog. set SelectedFile (selectedFile) ; 
fileDialog. setDialogTitleC'Select File to be Saved"); 
int option = fileDialog. showSaveDialog(this) ; 
if (option != JFileChooser . APPR0VE_0PTI0N) 

return; // User canceled or clicked the dialog's close box. 
selectedFile = fileDialog. getSelectedFile () ; 

if (selectedFile . exists () ) { // Ask the user whether to replace the file, 
int response = JOptionPane . showConf irmDialog( this, 

"The file \"" + selectedFile. getNameO 

+ "\" already exists. \nDo you want to replace it?", 

"Confirm Save" , 

JOptionPane . YES JJOJDPTION , 

JOptionPane . WARNING_MESSAGE ); 
if (response != JOptionPane .YES_0PTI0N) 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



551 



return; // User does not want to replace the file. 

} 

ObjectOutputStream out; 
try { 

FileOutputStream stream = new FileOutputStream(selectedFile) ; 
out = new ObjectOutputStream( stream ); 

y 

catch (Exception e) { 

JOptionPane . showMessageDialog(this , 

"Sorry, but an error occurred while trying to open the file:\n" + e) ; 
return; 

} 

try { 

out. writeObject (getBackgroundO ) ; 
out . writelnt (curves . size 0) ; 
for ( CurveData curve : curves ) 

out . writeObject (curve) ; 
out . close () ; 

editFile = selectedFile; 

setTitleC'SimplePaint : " + editFile. getNameO) ; 

y 

catch (Exception e) { 

JOptionPane . showMessageDialog(this , 

"Sorry, but an error occurred while trying to write the text:\n" + e) ; 

} 

} 

The heart of this method consists of the following lines, which do the actual writing of the data 
to the file: 

out .writeObject (getBackgroundO ) ; // Writes the panel's background color, 
out .writelnt (curves . size () ) ; // Writes the number of curves, 

for ( CurveData curve : curves ) // For each curve... 

out .writeObject (curve) ; // write the corresponding CurveData object. 

The last line depends on the fact that the CurveData class implements the Serializable interface. 

The doDpenAsBinary () method, which is responsible for reading sketch data back into the 
program from an ObjectlnputStream, has to read exactly the same data that was written, in the 
same order, and use that data to build the data structures that will represent the sketch while 
the program is running. Once the data structures have been successfully built, they replace the 
data structures that describe the previous contents of the panel. This is done as follows: 

/* Read data from the file into local variables */ 

Color newBackgroundColor = (Color)in.readObjectO ; 
int curveCount = in.readlntO; 

ArrayList<CurveData> newCurves = new ArrayList<CurveData>() ; 
for (int i = 0; i < curveCount; i++) 

newCurves . add ( (CurveData) in. readObjectO ); 
in.closeO ; 

/* Copy the data that was read into the instance variables that 
describe the sketch that is displayed by the program.*/ 

curves = newCurves; 

setBackgr ound (newBackgroundColor) ; 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



552 



repaint () ; 

This is only a little harder than saving the entire SimplePaintPanel component to the file in 
one step, and it is more robust since the serialized form of the objects that are saved to file is 
unlikely to change in the future. But it still suffers from the general fragility of binary data. 

* * * 

An alternative to using object streams is to save the data in human-readable, character 
form. The basic idea is the same: All the data necessary to reconstitute a sketch must be saved 
to the output file in some definite format. The method that reads the file must follow exactly 
the same format as it reads the data, and it must use the data to rebuild the data structures 
that represent the sketch while the program is running. 

When writing character data, we can't write out entire objects in one step. All the data has 
to be expressed, ultimately, in terms of simple data values such as strings and primitive type 
values. A color, for example, can be expressed in terms of three integers giving the red, green, 
and blue components of the color. The first (not very good) idea that comes to mind might be 
to just dump all the necessary data, in some definite order, into the file. Suppose that out is a 
PrintWriter that is used to write to the file. We could then say: 

Color bgColor = getBackgroundO ; // Write the background color to the file. 
out.println( bgColor . getRedO ); 
out .println( bgColor . getGreenO ); 
out.println( bgColor . getBlue () ); 

out.println( curves . size () ); // Write the number of curves. 

for ( CurveData curve : curves ) { // For each curve, write... 

out.println( curve . color . getRedO ); // the color of the curve 

out.println( curve . color . getGreenO ); 
out.println( curve . color . getBlue () ); 

out.println( curve . symmetric ? : 1 ); // the curve's symmetry property 
out.println( curve .points . size () ); // the number of points on curve 

for ( Point pt : curve. points ) { // the coordinates of each point 

out.println( pt.x ); 

out.println( pt.y ); 

} 

} 

This works in the sense that the file-reading method can read the data and rebuild the data 
structures. Suppose that the input method uses a Scanner named scanner to read the data 
file. Then it could say: 

Color newBackgroundColor; // Read the background Color, 

int red = scanner .nextlntO ; 
int green = scanner. nextlntO ; 
int blue = scanner .nextlntO ; 

newBackgroundColor = new Color (red, green, blue) ; 

ArrayList<CurveData> newCurves = new ArrayList<CurveData>() ; 

int curveCount = scanner. nextlntO ; // The number of curves to be read, 

for (int i = 0; i < curveCount; i++) { 
CurveData curve = new CurveData O ; 

int r = scanner .nextlntO ; // Read the curve's color, 

int g = scanner .nextlntO ; 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING

int b = scanner .nextlntO ; 
curve. color = new Color (r,g,b) ; 

int symmetryCode = scanner .nextlnt () ; // Read the curve's symmetry property, 
curve . symmetric = (symmetryCode == 1); 
curveData. points = new ArrayList<Point>() ; 

int pointCount = scanner .nextlnt () ; // The number of points on this curve, 
for (int j = 0; j < pointCount; j++) { 

int x = scanner .nextlnt () ; // Read the coordinates of the point. 

int y = scanner .nextlnt () ; 

curveData. points . add (new Point (x,y)) ; 

} 

newCurves . add (curve) ; 

} 

curves = newCurves; // Install the new data structures. 

setBackgr ound (newBackgroundColor ) ; 

Note how every piece of data that was written by the output method is read, in the same order, 
by the input method. While this does work, the data file is just a long string of numbers. It 
doesn't make much more sense to a human reader than a binary-format file would. Furthermore, 
it is still fragile in the sense that any small change made to the data representation in the 
program, such as adding a new property to curves, will render the data file useless (unless you 
happen to remember exactly which version of the program created the file) . 

So, I decided to use a more complex, more meaningful data format for the text files created 
by my program. Instead of just writing numbers, I add words to say what the numbers mean. 
Here is a short but complete data file for the program; just by looking at it, you can probably 
tell what is going on: 

SimplePaintWithFiles 1.0 
background 110 110 180 

start curve 

color 255 255 255 

symmetry true 

coords 10 10 

coords 200 250 

coords 300 10 
endcurve 

start curve 

color 255 255 

symmetry false 

coords 10 400 

coords 590 400 
endcurve 

The first line of the file identifies the program that created the data file; when the user 
selects a file to be opened, the program can check the first word in the file as a simple test to 
make sure the file is of the correct type. The first line also contains a version number, 1.0. If 
the file format changes in a later version of the program, a higher version number would be 
used; if the program sees a version number of 1.2 in a file, but the program only understands 
version 1.0, the program can explain to the user that a newer version of the program is needed 
to read the data file. 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



554 



The second line of the file specifies the background color of the picture. The three integers 
specify the red, green, and blue components of the color. The word "background" at the 
beginning of the line makes the meaning clear. The remainder of the file consists of data for the 
curves that appear in the picture. The data for each curve is clearly marked with "startcurve" 
and "endcurve." The data consists of the color and symmetry properties of the curve and the 
xy-coordinates of each point on the curve. Again, the meaning is clear. Files in this format can 
easily be created or edited by hand. In fact, the data file shown above was actually created in 
a text editor rather than by the program. Furthermore, it's easy to extend the format to allow 
for additional options. Future versions of the program could add a "thickness" property to the 
curves to make it possible to have curves that are more than one pixel wide. Shapes such as 
rectangles and ovals could easily be added. 

Outputting data in this format is easy. Suppose that out is a PrintWriter that is being used 
to write the sketch data to a file. Then the output can be done with: 

out .printlnC "SimplePaintWithFiles 1.0"); // Version number. 
Color bgColor = getBackgroundO ; 

out. printlnC "background " + bgColor . getRedO + " " + 
bgColor .getGreenO + " " + bgColor . getBlue () ); 
for ( CurveData curve : curves ) { 

out .printlnO ; 

out .printlnC'startcurve") ; 

out .printlnC color " + curve . color . getRedO + " " + 

curve . color . getGreenO + " " + curve . color . getBlue () ); 
out. printlnC " symmetry " + curve . symmetric ); 
for ( Point pt : curve. points ) 

out. printlnC " coords " + pt.x + " " + pt.y ); 
out. printlnC "endcurve") ; 

} 

Reading the data is somewhat harder, since the input routine has to deal with all the extra 
words in the data. In my input routine, I decided to allow some variation in the order in which 
the data occurs in the file. For example, the background color can be specified at the end of 
the file, instead of at the beginning. It can even be left out altogether, in which case white will 
be used as the default background color. This is possible because each item of data is labeled 
with a word that describes its meaning; the labels can be used to drive the processing of the 
input. Here is the complete method from SimplePaintWithFiles.java that reads data files in 
text format. It uses a Scanner to read items from the file: 

private void doOpenAsText C) { 

if CfileDialog == null) 

fileDialog = new JFileChooser ; 
f ileDialog. setDialogTitleC'Select File to be Opened"); 
fileDialog. setSelectedFile Cnull) ; // No file is initially selected, 
int option = fileDialog. showOpenDialog(this) ; 
if Coption != JFileChooser . APPROVEJDPTION) 

return; // User canceled or clicked the dialog's close box. 
File selectedFile = f ileDialog. getSelectedFile O ; 

Scanner scanner; // For reading from the data file, 
try { 

Reader stream = new Buf f eredReader Cnew FileReader CselectedFile) ) ; 

scanner = new Scanner C stream );

The main reason for this long discussion of file formats has been to get you to think about 
the problem of representing complex data in a form suitable for storing the data in a file. The 
same problem arises when data must be transmitted over a network. There is no one correct 
solution to the problem, but some solutions are certainly better than others. In Section 11.5, 
we will look at one solution to the data representation problem that has become increasingly 
common. 

* * * 

In addition to being able to save sketch data in both text form and binary form, 
SimplePaintWithFiles can also save the picture itself as an image file that could be, for 
example, printed or put on a web page. This is a preview of image-handling techniques that 
will be covered in Chapter 13. 



11.4 Networking 

As FAR AS A PROGRAM IS CONCERNED, a network is just another possible source of input data, (online) 
and another place where data can be output. That does oversimplify things, because networks 
are not as easy to work with as files are. But in Java, you can do network communication using 
input streams and output streams, just as you can use such streams to communicate with the 
user or to work with files. Nevertheless, opening a network connection between two computers 
is a bit tricky, since there are two computers involved and they have to somehow agree to open a 
connection. And when each computer can send data to the other, synchronizing communication 
can be a problem. But the fundamentals are the same as for other forms of I/O. 

One of the standard Java packages is called java.net. This package includes several 
classes that can be used for networking. Two different styles of network I/O are supported. 
One of these, which is fairly high-level, is based on the World-Wide Web, and provides the 
sort of network communication capability that is used by a Web browser when it downloads 
pages for you to view. The main classes for this style of networking are java.net. URL and 
java.net .URLConnection. An object of type URL is an abstract representation of a Univer- 
sal Resource Locator, which is an address for an HTML document or other resource on the 
Web. A URLConnection represents a network connection to such a resource. 

The second style of I/O, which is more general and much more important, views the network 
at a lower level. It is based on the idea of a socket. A socket is used by a program to establish 
a connection with another program on a network. Communication over a network involves two 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



557 



sockets, one on each of the computers involved in the communication. Java uses a class called 
java.net . Socket to represent sockets that are used for network communication. The term 
"socket" presumably comes from an image of physically plugging a wire into a computer to 
establish a connection to a network, but it is important to understand that a socket, as the 
term is used here, is simply an object belonging to the class Socket. In particular, a program 
can have several sockets at the same time, each connecting it to another program running on 
some other computer on the network. All these connections use the same physical network 
connection. 

This section gives a brief introduction to these basic networking classes, and shows how 
they relate to input and output streams. 

11.4.1 URLs and URLConnections 

The URL class is used to represent resources on the World-Wide Web. Every resource has an 
address, which identifies it uniquely and contains enough information for a Web browser to find 
the resource on the network and retrieve it. The address is called a "url" or "universal resource 
locator." 

An object belonging to the URL class represents such an address. Once you have a URL 
object, you can use it to open a URLConnection to the resource at that address. A url is 
ordinarily specified as a string, such as "http://math.hws.edu/eck/index.html". There are 
also relative url 's . A relative url specifies the location of a resource relative to the location of 
another url, which is called the base or context for the relative url. For example, if the context 
is given by the url http : / /math . hws . edu/eck/, then the incomplete, relative url "index . html" 
would really refer to http://math.hws.edu/eck/index.html. 

An object of the class URL is not simply a string, but it can be constructed from a string 
representation of a url. A URL object can also be constructed from another URL object, repre- 
senting a context, and a string that specifies a url relative to that context. These constructors 
have prototypes 

public URL(String urlName) throws Malf ormedURLException 

and 

public URL (URL context, String relativeName) throws Malf ormedURLException 

Note that these constructors will throw an exception of type MalformedURLException if the 
specified strings don't represent legal url's. The MalformedURLException class is a subclass 
of lOException, and it requires mandatory exception handling. That is, you must call the 
constructor inside a try. . catch statement that handles the exception or in a subroutine that 
is declared to throw the exception. 

The second constructor is especially convenient when writing applets. In an applet, two 
methods are available that provide useful URL contexts. The method getDocumentBaseO , 
defined in the Applet and JApplet classes, returns an object of type URL. This URL represents 
the location from which the HTML page that contains the applet was downloaded. This allows 
the applet to go back and retrieve other files that are stored in the same location as that 
document. For example, 

URL url = new URL (getDocumentBaseO , "data.txt"); 

constructs a URL that refers to a file named data.txt on the same computer and in the same 
directory as the source file for the web page on which the applet is running. Another method, 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



558 



getCodeBaseO , returns a URL that gives the location of the applet class file (which is not 
necessarily the same as the location of the document). 

Once you have a valid URL object, you can call its openConnectionQ method to set up a 
connection. This method returns a URLConnection. The URLConnection object can, in turn, 
be used to create an InputStream for reading data from the resource represented by the URL. 
This is done by calling its get InputStream () method. For example: 

URL url = new URL(urlAddressString) ; 
URLConnection connection = url . openConnectionO ; 
InputStream in = connection. getlnputStreamO ; 

The openConnectionO and getlnputStreamO methods can both throw exceptions of type 
lOException. Once the InputStream has been created, you can read from it in the usual way, 
including wrapping it in another input stream type, such as BufferedReader, or using a Scanner. 
Reading from the stream can, of course, generate exceptions. 

One of the other useful instance methods in the URLConnection class is getContentTypeO , 
which returns a String that describes the type of information available from the URL. The 
return value can be null if the type of information is not yet known or if it is not possi- 
ble to determine the type. The type might not be available until after the input stream has 
been created, so you should generally call getContentTypeO after getlnputStreamO. The 
string returned by getContentTypeO is in a format called a mime type. Mime types include 
"text /plain" , "text/html", "image/jpeg" , "image/gif, and many others. All mime types con- 
tain two parts: a general type, such as "text" or "image" , and a more specific type within that 
general category, such as "html" or "gif ' . If you are only interested in text data, for example, 
you can check whether the string returned by getContentTypeO starts with "text". (Mime 
types were first introduced to describe the content of email messages. The name stands for 
"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions." They are now used almost universally to specify the 
type of information in a file or other resource.) 

Let's look at a short example that uses all this to read the data from a URL. This subroutine 
opens a connection to a specified URL, checks that the type of data at the URL is text, and 
then copies the text onto the screen. Many of the operations in this subroutine can throw 
exceptions. They are handled by declaring that the subroutine "throws lOException" and 
leaving it up to the main program to decide what to do when an error occurs. 

static void readTextFromURL( String urlString ) throws lOException { 

/* Open a connection to the URL, and get an input stream 
for reading data from the URL. */ 

URL url = new URL (urlString) ; 

URLConnection connection = url . openConnectionO ; 
InputStream urlData = connection. getlnputStreamO ; 

/* Check that the content is some type of text. */ 

String contentType = connection. getContentType ; 

if (contentType == null II contentType. startsWithC'text") == false) 

throw new IOExceptionC'URL does not seem to refer to a text file."); 

/* Copy lines of text from the input stream to the screen, until 
end-of-f ile is encountered (or an error occurs) . */ 

BufferedReader in; // For reading from the connection's input stream, 
in = new Buf f eredReader ( new InputStreamReader (urlData) ); 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



559 



while (true) { 

String line = in.readLineO ; 
if (line == null) 
break; 

System. out .println(line) ; 

} 

} // end readTextFromURLO 

A complete program that uses this subroutine can be found in the file ReadURL.java. When 
using the program, note that you have to specify a complete url, including the "http : / /" at 
the beginning. There is also an applet version of the program, which you can find in the on-line 
version of this section. 

11.4.2 TCP/IP and Client/Server 

Communication over the Internet is based on a pair of protocols called the Transmission 
Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol, which are collectively referred to as TCP/IP. 
(In fact, there is a more basic communication protocol called UDP that can be used instead of 
TCP in certain applications. UDP is supported in Java, but for this discussion, I'll stick to the 
full TCP/IP, which provides reliable two-way communication between networked computers.) 

For two programs to communicate using TCP/IP, each program must create a socket, as 
discussed earlier in this section, and those sockets must be connected. Once such a connection 
is made, communication takes place using input streams and output streams. Each program 
has its own input stream and its own output stream. Data written by one program to its output 
stream is transmitted to the other computer. There, it enters the input stream of the program 
at the other end of the network connection. When that program reads data from its input 
stream, it is receiving the data that was transmitted to it over the network. 

The hard part, then, is making a network connection in the first place. Two sockets are 
involved. To get things started, one program must create a socket that will wait passively until 
a connection request comes in from another socket. The waiting socket is said to be listening 
for a connection. On the other side of the connection-to-be, another program creates a socket 
that sends out a connection request to the listening socket. When the listening socket receives 
the connection request, it responds, and the connection is established. Once that is done, each 
program can obtain an input stream and an output stream for sending data over the connection. 
Communication takes place through these streams until one program or the other closes the 
connection. 

A program that creates a listening socket is sometimes said to be a server, and the socket is 
called a server socket. A program that connects to a server is called a client, and the socket 
that it uses to make a connection is called a client socket. The idea is that the server is out 
there somewhere on the network, waiting for a connection request from some client. The server 
can be thought of as offering some kind of service, and the client gets access to that service by 
connecting to the server. This is called the client/server model of network communication. 
In many actual applications, a server program can provide connections to several clients at the 
same time. When a client connects to a server's listening socket, that socket does not stop 
listening. Instead, it continues listening for additional client connections at the same time that 
the first client is being serviced. To do this, it is necessary to use threads. We'll look at how it 
works in the next chapter. 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



560 



The URL class that was discussed at the beginning of this section uses a client socket behind 
the scenes to do any necessary network communication. On the other side of that connection is 
a server program that accepts a connection request from the URL object, reads a request from 
that object for some particular file on the server computer, and responds by transmitting the 
contents of that file over the network back to the URL object. After transmitting the data, the 
server closes the connection. 

* * * 

A client program has to have some way to specify which computer, among all those on the 
network, it wants to communicate with. Every computer on the Internet has an IP address 
which identifies it uniquely among all the computers on the net. Many computers can also 
be referred to by domain names such as math.hws.edu or www.whitehouse.gov. (See Sec- 
tion 1.7.) Traditional (or IPv4) IP addresses are 32-bit integers. They are usually written in 
the so-called "dotted decimal" form, such as 64.89.144.135, where each of the four numbers 
in the address represents an 8-bit integer in the range through 255. A new version of the 
Internet Protocol, IPv6, is currently being introduced. IPv6 addresses are 128-bit integers and 
are usually written in hexadecimal form (with some colons and maybe some extra information 
thrown in). In actual use, IPv6 addresses are still fairly rare. 

A computer can have several IP addresses, and can have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. 
Usually, one of these is the loopback address, which can be used when a program wants to 
communicate with another program on the same computer. The loopback address has IPv4 
address 127.0.0.1 and can also, in general, be referred to using the domain name localhost. In 
addition, there can be one or more IP addresses associated with physical network connections. 
Your computer probably has some utility for displaying your computer's IP addresses. I have 
written a small Java program, ShowMyNetwork.java, that does the same thing. When I run 
ShowMyNetwork on my computer, the output is: 

enl : /192. 168. 1 .47 /f e80 : : : : 211 : 24ff : fe9c : 52717.5 

loO : /127. 0.0.1 /fe80:0:0: 0:0: 0:0: 1%1 /0 : : : : : : : 1%0 

The first thing on each line is a network interface name, which is really meaningful only to the 
computer's operating system. The output also contains the IP addresses for that interface. In 
this example, loO refers to the loopback address, which has IPv4 address 127.0.0.1 as usual. 
The most important number here is 192 . 168 . 1 . 47, which is the IPv4 address that can be used 
for communication over the network. The other numbers in the output are IPv6 addresses. 

Now, a single computer might have several programs doing network communication at the 
same time, or one program communicating with several other computers. To allow for this 
possibility, a network connection is actually identified by a port number in combination with 
an IP address. A port number is just a 16-bit integer. A server does not simply listen for 
connections — it listens for connections on a particular port. A potential client must know both 
the Internet address (or domain name) of the computer on which the server is running and 
the port number on which the server is listening. A Web server, for example, generally listens 
for connections on port 80; other standard Internet services also have standard port numbers. 
(The standard port numbers are all less than 1024, and are reserved for particular services. If 
you create your own server programs, you should use port numbers greater than 1024.) 

11.4.3 Sockets in Java 

To implement TCP/IP connections, the java.net package provides two classes, ServerSocket 
and Socket. A ServerSocket represents a listening socket that waits for connection requests 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



561 



from clients. A Socket represents one endpoint of an actual network connection. A Socket 
can be a client socket that sends a connection request to a server. But a Socket can also be 
created by a server to handle a connection request from a client. This allows the server to create 
multiple sockets and handle multiple connections. A ServerSocket does not itself participate 
in connections; it just listens for connection requests and creates Sockets to handle the actual 
connections. 

When you construct a ServerSocket object, you have to specify the port number on which 
the server will listen. The specification for the constructor is 

public ServerSocket (int port) throws IDException 

The port number must be in the range through 65535, and should generally be greater than 
1024. The constructor might throw a SecurityException if a smaller port number is specified. An 
lOException can occur if, for example, the specified port number is already in use. (A parameter 
value of in this method tells the server socket to listen on any available port.) 

As soon as a ServerSocket is created, it starts listening for connection requests. The 
accept () method in the ServerSocket class accepts such a request, establishes a connection 
with the client, and returns a Socket that can be used for communication with the client. The 
accept () method has the form 

public Socket accept () throws lOException 

When you call the accept () method, it will not return until a connection request is received (or 
until some error occurs). The method is said to block while waiting for the connection. (While 
the method is blocked, the program — or more exactly, the thread — that called the method 
can't do anything else. If there are other threads in the same program, they can proceed.) You 
can call accept () repeatedly to accept multiple connection requests. The ServerSocket will 
continue listening for connections until it is closed, using its close () method, or until some 
error occurs, or until the program is terminated in some way. 

Suppose that you want a server to listen on port 1728, and suppose that you've written 
a method provideService (Socket) to handle the communication with one client. Then the 
basic form of the server program would be: 

try { 

ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket (1728) ; 
while (true) { 

Socket connection = server . accept () ; 

provideService (connection) ; 

} 

} 

catch (IDException e) { 

System. out .printlnC'Server shut down with error: " + e) ; 

} 

On the client side, a client socket is created using a constructor in the Socket class. To 
connect to a server on a known computer and port, you would use the constructor 

public Socket (String computer, int port) throws lOException 

The first parameter can be either an IP number or a domain name. This constructor will block 
until the connection is established or until an error occurs. 

Once you have a connected socket, no matter how it was created, you can use the Socket 
methods getlnputStreamO and getOutputStreamQ to obtain streams that can be used for 
communication over the connection. These methods return objects of type InputStream and 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



562 



OutputStream, respectively. Keeping all this in mind, here is the outline of a method for 
working with a client connection: 

/** 

* Open a client connection to a specified server computer and 

* port number on the server, and then do communication through 

* the connection. 
*/ 

void doClientConnection(String computerName , int serverPort) { 
Socket connection; 
InputStream in; 
OutputStream out ; 
try { 

connection = new Socket (computerName , serverPort) ; 
in = connection. getlnputStreamO ; 
out = connection. getOutputStreamO ; 

} 

catch (IOException e) { 
System. out .println( 

"Attempt to create connection failed with error: " + e) ; 
return; 

> 

// Use the streams, in and out, to communicate with the server. 

try { 

connection. closeO ; 

// (Alternatively, you might depend on the server 
// to close the connection.) 

} 

catch (IOException e) { 
} 

} // end doClientConnectionO 

All this makes network communication sound easier than it really is. (And if you think it 
sounded hard, then it's even harder.) If networks were completely reliable, things would be 
almost as easy as I've described. The problem, though, is to write robust programs that can deal 
with network and human error. I won't go into detail here. However, what I've covered here 
should give you the basic ideas of network programming, and it is enough to write some simple 
network applications. Let's look at a few working examples of client /server programming. 

11.4.4 A Trivial Client/Server 

The first example consists of two programs. The source code files for the programs are 
DateClient.java and DateServer.java. One is a simple network client and the other is a matching 
server. The client makes a connection to the server, reads one line of text from the server, and 
displays that text on the screen. The text sent by the server consists of the current date and 
time on the computer where the server is running. In order to open a connection, the client 
must know the computer on which the server is running and the port on which it is listening. 
The server listens on port number 32007. The port number could be anything between 1025 
and 65535, as long as the server and the client use the same port. Port numbers between 1 and 
1024 are reserved for standard services and should not be used for other servers. The name or

563 



IP number of the computer on which the server is running must be specified as a command-line 
argument. For example, if the server is running on a computer named math.hws.edu, then you 
would typically run the client with the command "java DateClient math.hws.edu". Here is 
the complete client program: 

import java.net.*; 
import java.io.*; 

/** 

* This program opens a connection to a computer specified 

* as the first command-line argument. The connection is made to 

* the port specified by LISTENING_PORT. The program reads one 

* line of text from the connection and then closes the 

* connection. It displays the text that it read on 

* standard output . This program is meant to be used with 

* the server program, DateServer, which sends the current 

* date and time on the computer where the server is running. 
*/ 

public class DateClient { 

public static final int LISTENING_PDRT = 32007; 

public static void main(String[] args) { 

String hostName; // Name of the server computer to connect to. 

Socket connection; // A socket for communicating with the server. 

Buf f eredReader incoming; // For reading data from the connection. 

/* Get computer name from command line. */ 

if (args. length > 0) 

hostName = args [0] ; 
else { 

// No computer name was given. Print a message and exit. 
System, out .println( "Usage : java DateClient <server_host_name>") ; 
return ; 

} 

/* Make the connection, then read and display a line of text. */ 
try { 

connection = new Socket ( hostName, LISTENING_PORT ); 
incoming = new Buf f eredReader ( 

new InputStreamReader(connection.getlnputStreamO) ); 
String lineFromServer = incoming. readLine () ; 
if (lineFromServer == null) { 

// A null from incoming. readLine () indicates that 
// end-of -stream was encountered, 
throw new I0Exception( "Connection was opened, " + 
"but server did not send any data."); 

} 

System, out .printlnO ; 

System. out . println (lineFromServer) ; 

System, out .printlnO ; 

incoming. closeO ; 

} 

catch (Exception e) { 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



564 



System. out .println( "Error : " + e) ; 

} 

} // end mainO 

} //end class DateClient 

Note that all the communication with the server is done in a try. .catch statement. This 
will catch the lOExceptions that can be generated when the connection is opened or closed 
and when data is read from the input stream. The connection's input stream is wrapped in a 
Buffered Reader, which has a readLineO method that makes it easy to read one line of text. 
(See Subsection 11.1.4.) 

In order for this program to run without error, the server program must be running on 
the computer to which the client tries to connect. By the way, it's possible to run the client 
and the server program on the same computer. For example, you can open two command 
windows, start the server in one window and then run the client in the other window. To make 
things like this easier, most computers will recognize the domain name localhost and the 
IP number 127.0.0.1 as referring to "this computer." This means that the command "java 
DateClient localhost" will tell the DateClient program to connect to a server running on the 
same computer. If that command doesn't work, try "java DateClient 127.0.0.1". 

The server program that corresponds to the DateClient client program is called DateServer. 
The DateServer program creates a ServerSocket to listen for connection requests on port 32007. 
After the listening socket is created, the server will enter an infinite loop in which it accepts and 
processes connections. This will continue until the program is killed in some way — for example 
by typing a C0NTR0L-C in the command window where the server is running. When a connection 
request is received from a client, the server calls a subroutine to handle the connection. In the 
subroutine, any Exception that occurs is caught, so that it will not crash the server. Just 
because a connection to one client has failed for some reason, it does not mean that the server 
should be shut down; the error might have been the fault of the client. The connection-handling 
subroutine creates a PrintWriter for sending data over the connection. It writes the current date 
and time to this stream and then closes the connection. (The standard class java.util .Date 
is used to obtain the current time. An object of type Date represents a particular date and 
time. The default constructor, "new DateO", creates an object that represents the time when 
the object is created.) The complete server program is as follows: 

import java.net.*; 
import java.io.*; 
import java.util. Date; 

/** 

* This program is a server that takes connection requests on 

* the port specified by the constant LISTENING_P0RT . When a 

* connection is opened, the program sends the current time to 

* the connected socket. The program will continue to receive 

* and process connections until it is killed (by a C0NTR0L-C, 

* for example) . Note that this server processes each connection 

* as it is received, rather than creating a separate thread 

* to process the connection.

When you run DateServer in a command-line interface, it will sit and wait for connection 
requests and report them as they are received. To make the DateServer service permanently 
available on a computer, the program really should be run as a daemon. A daemon is a 
program that runs continually on a computer, independently of any user. The computer can be 
configured to start the daemon automatically as soon as the computer boots up. It then runs 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



566 



in the background, even while the computer is being used for other purposes. For example, a 
computer that makes pages available on the World Wide Web runs a daemon that listens for 
requests for web pages and responds by transmitting the pages. It's just a souped-up analog 
of the DateServer program! However, the question of how to set up a program as a daemon 
is not one I want to go into here. For testing purposes, it's easy enough to start the program 
by hand, and, in any case, my examples are not really robust enough or full-featured enough 
to be run as serious servers. (By the way, the word "daemon" is just an alternative spelling of 
"demon" and is usually pronounced the same way.) 

Note that after calling outgoing. printlnQ to send a line of data to the client, the server 
program calls outgoing. flush() . The flush() method is available in every output stream 
class. Calling it ensures that data that has been written to the stream is actually sent to its 
destination. You should generally call this function every time you use an output stream to 
send data over a network connection. If you don't do so, it's possible that the stream will 
collect data until it has a large batch of data to send. This is done for efficiency, but it can 
impose unacceptable delays when the client is waiting for the transmission. It is even possible 
that some of the data might remain untransmitted when the socket is closed, so it is especially 
important to call flush () before closing the connection. This is one of those unfortunate cases 
where different implementations of Java can behave differently. If you fail to flush your output 
streams, it is possible that your network application will work on some types of computers but 
not on others. 

11.4.5 A Simple Network Chat 

In the DateServer example, the server transmits information and the client reads it. It's also 
possible to have two-way communication between client and server. As a first example, we'll 
look at a client and server that allow a user on each end of the connection to send messages 
to the other user. The program works in a command-line interface where the users type in 
their messages. In this example, the server waits for a connection from a single client and then 
closes down its listener so that no other clients can connect. After the client and server are 
connected, both ends of the connection work in much the same way. The user on the client end 
types a message, and it is transmitted to the server, which displays it to the user on that end. 
Then the user of the server types a message that is transmitted to the client. Then the client 
user types another message, and so on. This continues until one user or the other enters "quit" 
when prompted for a message. When that happens, the connection is closed and both programs 
terminate. The client program and the server program are very similar. The techniques for 
opening the connections differ, and the client is programmed to send the first message while 
the server is programmed to receive the first message. The client and server programs can be 
found in the files CLChatClient.java and CLChatServer.java. (The name "CLChat" stands for 
"command-line chat.") Here is the source code for the server; the client is similar: 

import java.net.*; 
import java.io.*; 

/** 

* This program is one end of a simple command-line interface chat program. 

* It acts as a server which waits for a connection from the CLChatClient 

* program. The port on which the server listens can be specified as a 

* command-line argument. If it is not, then the port specified by the 

* constant DEFAULT_PORT is used. Note that if a port number of zero is 

* specified, then the server will listen on any available port. 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



567 



* This program only supports one connection. As soon as a connection is 

* opened, the listening socket is closed down. The two ends of the connection 

* each send a HANDSHAKE string to the other, so that both ends can verify 

* that the program on the other end is of the right type. Then the connected 

* programs alternate sending messages to each other. The client always sends 

* the first message. The user on either end can close the connection by 

* entering the string "quit" when prompted for a message. Note that the first 

* character of any string sent over the connection must be or 1; this 

* character is interpreted as a command.

This program is a little more robust than DateServer. For one thing, it uses a handshake to 
make sure that a client who is trying to connect is really a CLChatClient program. A handshake 
is simply information sent between a client and a server as part of setting up a connection, 
before any actual data is sent. In this case, each side of the connection sends a string to 
the other side to identify itself. The handshake is part of the protocol that I made up for 
communication between CLChatClient and CLChatServer. A protocol is a detailed specification 
of what data and messages can be exchanged over a connection, how they must be represented, 
and what order they can be sent in. When you design a client /server application, the design 
of the protocol is an important consideration. Another aspect of the CLChat protocol is that 
after the handshake, every line of text that is sent over the connection begins with a character 
that acts as a command. If the character is 0, the rest of the line is a message from one user to 
the other. If the character is 1, the line indicates that a user has entered the "quit" command, 
and the connection is to be shut down. 

Remember that if you want to try out this program on a single computer, you can use 
two command-line windows. In one, give the command "java CLChatServer" to start the 
server. Then, in the other, use the command "java CLChatClient localhost" to connect to 
the server that is running on the same machine.

11.5 A Brief Introduction to XML 

When data is saved to a file or transmitted over a network, it must be represented in some (online) 
way that will allow the same data to be rebuilt later, when the file is read or the transmission 
is received. We have seen that there are good reasons to prefer textual, character-based rep- 
resentations in many cases, but there are many ways to represent a given collection of data as 
text. In this section, we'll take a brief look at one type of character-based data representation 
that has become increasingly common. 

XML (extensible Markup Language) is a syntax for creating data representation languages. 
There are two aspects or levels of XML. On the first level, XML specifies a strict but relatively 
simple syntax. Any sequence of characters that follows that syntax is a well-formed XML 
document. On the second level, XML provides a way of placing further restrictions on what 
can appear in a document. This is done by associating a DTD (Document Type Definition) 
with an XML document. A DTD is essentially a list of things that are allowed to appear in the 
XML document. A well-formed XML document that has an associated DTD and that follows 
the rules of the DTD is said to be a valid XML document. The idea is that XML is a general 
format for data representation, and a DTD specifies how to use XML to represent a particular 
kind of data. (There is also an alternative to DTDs, known as XML schemas, for defining 
valid XLM documents, but let's ignore them here.) 

There is nothing magical about XML. It's certainly not perfect. It's a very verbose language, 
and some people think it's ugly. On the other hand it's very flexible; it can be used to represent 
almost any type of data. It was built from the start to support all languages and alphabets. 
Most important, it has become an accepted standard. There is support in just about any 
programming language for processing XML documents. There are standard DTDs for describing 
many different kinds of data. There are many ways to design a data representation language, 
but XML is the one that has happened to come into widespread use. In fact, it has found its way 
into almost every corner of information technology. For example: There are XML languages for 
representing mathematical expressions (MathML), musical notation (MusicXML), molecules 
and chemical reactions (CML), vector graphics (SVG), and many other kinds of information. 
XML is used by OpenOffice and recent versions of Microsoft Office in the document format 
for office applications such as word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations. XML site 
syndication languages (RSS, ATOM) make it possible for web sites, newspapers, and blogs to 
make a list of recent headlines available in a standard format that can be used by other web 
sites and by web browsers; the same format is used to publish podcasts. And XML is a common 
format for the electronic exchange of business information. 

My purpose here is not to tell you everything there is to know about XML. I will just 
explain a few ways in which it can be used in your own programs. In particular, I will not 
say anything further about DTDs and valid XML. For many purposes, it is sufficient to use 
well-formed XML documents with no associated DTDs. 

11.5.1 Basic XML Syntax 

An XML document looks a lot like an HTML document (see Subsection 6.2.3). HTML is not 
itself an XML language, since it does not follow all the strict XML syntax rules, but the basic 
ideas are similar. Here is a short, well-formed XML document: 

<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<simplepaint version=" 1 . 0"> 

background red='255' green='153' blue='51'/> 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



571 



<curve> 

•Ccolor red='0' green='0' blue='255'/> 

<symmetric>f alse</ symmetric> 

<point x='83' y='96'/> 

<point x='116' y='149>/> 

<point x='159' y='215>/> 

<point x='216' y='294>/> 

<point x='264' y='359>/> 

<point x='309' y='418>/> 

<point x='37l' y='499'/> 

<point x='400' y='543'/> 
</ curve> 
<curve> 

<color red='255' green='255' blue='255'/> 
<symmetric>true</ symmetric> 
<point x='54' y='305'/> 
<point x='79' y='289'/> 
<point x='128' y='262'/> 
<point x='190' y='236'/> 
<point x='253' y='209'/> 
<point x='34l' y='158 ; /> 
</ curve> 
</ simplepaint> 

The first line, which is optional, merely identifies this as an XML document. This line can 
also specify other information, such as the character encoding that was used to encode the 
characters in the document into binary form. If this document had an associated DTD, it 
would be specified in a "DOCTYPE" directive on the next line of the file. 

Aside from the first line, the document is made up of elements, attributes, and textual 
content. An element starts with a tag, such as <curve> and ends with a matching end-tag 
such as </curve>. Between the tag and end-tag is the content of the element, which can 
consist of text and nested elements. (In the example, the only textual content is the true or 
false in the <symmetric> elements.) If an element has no content, then the opening tag and 
end-tag can be combined into a single empty tag, such as <point x='83 ) y='96'/>, with 
a "/" before the final ">". This is an abbreviation for <point x =, 83' y='96'x/point>. A 
tag can include attributes such as the x and y in <point x =, 83' y =) 96'/> or the version 
in <simplepaint version=" 1 . 0">. A document can also include a few other things, such as 
comments, that I will not discuss here. 

The basic structure should look familiar to someone familiar with HTML. The most striking 
difference is that in XML, you get to choose the tags. Whereas HTML comes with a fixed, 
finite set of tags, with XML you can make up meaningful tag names that are appropriate to 
your application and that describe the data that is being represented. (For an XML document 
that uses a DTD, it's the author of the DTD who gets to choose the tag names.) 

Every well-formed XML document follows a strict syntax. Here are some of the most 
important syntax rules: Tag names and attribute names in XML are case sensitive. A name 
must begin with a letter and can contain letters, digits and certain other characters. Spaces 
and ends-of-line are significant only in textual content. Every tag must either be an empty 
tag or have a matching end-tag. By "matching" here, I mean that elements must be properly 
nested; if a tag is inside some element, then the matching end-tag must also be inside that 
element. A document must have a root element, which contains all the other elements. The 
root element in the above example has tag name simplepaint. Every attribute must have 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



572 



a value, and that value must be enclosed in quotation marks; either single quotes or double 
quotes can be used for this. The special characters < and &, if they appear in attribute values 
or textual content, must be written as < and &. "felt;" and "&" are examples 
of entities. The entities >, fequot;, and &apos; are also defined, representing >, double 
quote, and single quote. (Additional entities can be defined in a DTD.) 

While this description will not enable you to understand everything that you might en- 
counter in XML documents, it should allow you to design well- formed XML documents to 
represent data structures used in Java programs. 

11.5.2 XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder 

We will look at two approaches to representing data from Java programs in XML format. One 
approach is to design a custom XML language for the specific data structures that you want to 
represent. We will consider this approach in the next subsection. First, we'll look at an easy way 
to store data in XML files and to read those files back into a program. The technique uses the 
classes XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder. These classes are defined in the package java. beans. An 
XMLEncoder can be used to write objects to an OutputStream in XML form. An XMLDecoder 
can be used to read the output of an XMLEncoder and reconstruct the objects that were written 
by it. XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder have much the same functionality as ObjectOutputStream 
and ObjectlnputStream and are used in much the same way. In fact, you don't even have to 
know anything about XML to use them. However, you do need to know a little about Java 
beans . 

A Java bean is just an object that has certain characteristics. The class that defines a 
Java bean must be a public class. It must have a constructor that takes no parameters. It 
should have a "get" method and a "set" method for each of its important instance variables. 
(See Subsection 5.1.3.) The last rule is a little vague. The idea is that it should be possible 
to inspect all aspects of the object's state by calling "get" methods, and it should be possible 
to set all aspects of the state by calling "set" methods. A bean is not required to implement 
any particular interface; it is recognized as a bean just by having the right characteristics. 
Usually, Java beans are passive data structures that are acted upon by other objects but don't 
do much themselves. 

XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder can't be used with arbitrary objects; they can only be used 
with beans. When an XMLEncoder writes an object, it uses the "get" methods of that object 
to find out what information needs to be saved. When an XMLDecoder reconstructs an object, 
it creates the object using the constructor with no parameters and it uses "set" methods to 
restore the object's state to the values that were saved by the XMLEncoder. (Some standard 
Java classes are processed using additional techniques. For example, a different constructor 
might be used, and other methods might be used to inspect and restore the state.) 

For an example, we return to the same SimplePaint example that was used in Subsec- 
tion 11.3.4. Suppose that we want to use XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder to create and read 
files in that program. Part of the data for a SimplePaint sketch is stored in objects of type 
CurveData, defined as: 

private static class CurveData { 

Color color; // The color of the curve. 

boolean symmetric; // Are reflections also drawn? 

ArrayList<Point> points; // The points on the curve. 

} 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



573 



To use such objects with XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder, we have to modify this class so that 
it follows the Java bean pattern. The class has to be public, and we need get and set methods 
for each instance variable. This gives: 

public static class CurveData { 

private Color color; // The color of the curve, 
private boolean symmetric; // Are reflections also drawn? 
private ArrayList<Point> points; // The points on the curve, 
public Color getColorO { 
return color; 

} 

public void setColor (Color color) { 
this. color = color; 

} 

public ArrayList<Point> getPointsO { 
return points; 

} 

public void setPoints (ArrayList<Point> points) { 
this. points = points; 

} 

public boolean isSymmetric () { 
return symmetric; 

} 

public void setSymmetric (boolean symmetric) { 
this . symmetric = symmetric; 

> 

} 

I didn't really need to make the instance variables private, but bean properties are usually 
private and are accessed only through their get and set methods. 

At this point, we might define another bean class, SketchData, to hold all the necessary 
data for representing the user's picture. If we did that, we could write the data to a file with a 
single output statement. In my program, however, I decided to write the data in several pieces. 

An XMLEncoder can be constructed to write to any output stream. The output stream is 
specified in the encoder's constructor. For example, to create an encoder for writing to a file: 

XMLEncoder encoder; 
try { 

FileOutputStream stream = new FileOutputStream(selectedFile) ; 
encoder = new XMLEncoder ( stream ); 



Once an encoder has been created, its writeObjectQ method is used to write objects, coded 
into XML form, to the stream. In the SimplePaint program, I save the background color, the 
number of curves in the picture, and the data for each curve. The curve data are stored in a 
list of type ArrayList<CurveData> named curves. So, a complete representation of the user's 
picture can be created with: 

encoder . writeObj ect (getBackground () ) ; 
encoder. writeObject (new Integer (curves. size ())) ; 
for (CurveData c : curves) 
encoder .writeObject (c) ; 
encoder . close () ;

When reading the data back into the program, an XMLDecoder is created to read from an 
input file stream. The objects are then read, using the decoder's readObject () method, in the 
same order in which they were written. Since the return type of readObject () is Object, the 
returned values must be type-cast to their correct type: 

Color bgColor = (Color)decoder. readObject () ; 
Integer curveCt = (Integer) decoder .readObject () ; 
ArrayList<CurveData> newCurves = new ArrayList<CurveData> () ; 
for (int i = 0; i < curveCt ; i++) { 

CurveData c = (CurveData) decoder .readObjectO ; 

newCurves . add ( c ) ; 

} 

decoder . close () ; 

curves = newCurves; // Replace the program's data with data from the file. 
setBackground(bgColor) ; 
repaint () ; 

You can look at the sample program SimplePaintWithXMLEncoder.java to see this code in 
the context of a complete program. Files are created by the method doSaveAsXMLO and are 
read by doOpenAsXML . 

The XML format used by XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder is more robust than the binary 
format used for object streams and is more appropriate for long-term storage of objects in files. 

11.5.3 Working With the DOM 

The output produced by an XMLEncoder tends to be long and not very easy for a human reader 
to understand. It would be nice to represent data in a more compact XML format that uses 
meaningful tag names to describe the data and makes more sense to human readers. We'll look 
at yet another version of SimplePaint that does just that. See SimplePaintWithXML.java for 
the source code. The sample XML document shown earlier in this section was produced by this 
program. I designed the format of that document to represent all the data needed to reconstruct 
a picture in SimplePaint. The document encodes the background color of the picture and a 
list of curves. Each <curve> element contains the data from one object of type CurveData. 

It is easy enough to write data in a customized XML format, although we have to be very 
careful to follow all the syntax rules. Here is how I write the data for a SimplePaint picture 
to a PrintWriter, out: 

out .println("<?xml version=\"l . 0\"?>") ; 

out .println("<simplepaint version=\" 1 . 0\">") ; 

Color bgColor = getBackgroundO ; 

out .printlnC <background red='" + bgColor . getRedO + "' green='" + 

bgColor .getGreenO + "' blue="' + bgColor . getBlue () + "'/>"); 
for (CurveData c : curves) { 
out .printlnC <curve>"); 

out .printlnC <color red='" + c . color . getRedO + "' green='" + 

c . color . getGreenO + "' blue='" + c . color . getBlue () + "'/>"); 
out .printlnC <symmetric>" + c. symmetric + "</symmetric>") ; 

for (Point pt : c. points) 

out .printlnC <point x='" + pt.x + "' y='" + pt.y + "'/>"); 

out .printlnC </curve>"); 

} 

out .println("</simplepaint>") ; 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



575 



Reading the data back into the program is another matter. To reconstruct the data structure 
represented by the XML Document, it is necessary to parse the document and extract the data 
from it. This could be difficult to do by hand. Fortunately, Java has a standard API for parsing 
and processing XML Documents. (Actually, it has two, but we will only look at one of them.) 

A well-formed XML document has a certain structure, consisting of elements containing 
attributes, nested elements, and textual content. It's possible to build a data structure in the 
computer's memory that corresponds to the structure and content of the document. Of course, 
there are many ways to do this, but there is one common standard representation known as 
the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM specifies how to build data structures 
to represent XML documents, and it specifies some standard methods for accessing the data 
in that structure. The data structure is a kind of tree whose structure mirrors the structure 
of the document. The tree is constructed from nodes of various types. There are nodes to 
represent elements, attributes, and text. (The tree can also contain several other types of node, 
representing aspects of XML that we can ignore here.) Attributes and text can be processed 
without directly manipulating the corresponding nodes, so we will be concerned almost entirely 
with element nodes. 

The sample program XMLDemo.java lets you experiment with XML and the DOM. It has a 
text area where you can enter an XML document. Initially, the input area contains the sample 
XML document from this section. When you click a button named "Parse XML Input", the 
program will attempt to read the XML from the input box and build a DOM representation of 
that document. If the input is not legal XML, an error message is displayed. If it is legal, the 
program will traverse the DOM representation and display a list of elements, attributes, and 
textual content that it encounters. (The program uses a few techniques that I won't discuss 
here.) 

In Java, the DOM representation of an XML document file can be created with just two 
statements. If selectedFile is a variable of type File that represents the XML file, then 

DocumentBuilder docReader 

= DocumentBuilderFactory .newInstanceO . newDocumentBuilder () ; 
xmldoc = docReader .parse (selectedFile) ; 

will open the file, read its contents, and build the DOM representation. The classes Document- 
Builder and DocumentBuilderFactory are both defined in the package javax.xml. parsers. The 
method docReader .parse () does the actual work. It will throw an exception if it can't read 
the file or if the file does not contain a legal XML document. If it succeeds, then the value 
returned by docReader .parse () is an object that represents the entire XML document. (This 
is a very complex task! It has been coded once and for all into a method that can be used very 
easily in any Java program. We see the benefit of using a standardized syntax.) 

The structure of the DOM data structure is defined in the package org . w3c . dom, which 
contains several data types that represent an XML document as a whole and the individual 
nodes in a document. The "org.w3c" in the name refers to the World Wide Web Consortium, 
W3C, which is the standards organization for the Web. DOM, like XML, is a general standard, 
not just a Java standard. The data types that we need here are Document, Node, Element, and 
NodeList. (They are defined as interfaces rather than classes, but that fact is not relevant 
here.) We can use methods that are defined in these data types to access the data in the DOM 
representation of an XML document. 

An object of type Document represents an entire XML document. The return value of 
docReader .parse () — xmldoc in the above example — is of type Document. We will only need 
one method from this class: If xmldoc is of type Document, then 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



576 



xmldoc . getDocumentElement () 

returns a value of type Element that represents the root element of the document. (Recall that 
this is the top-level element that contains all the other elements.) In the sample XML document 
from earlier in this section, the root element consists of the tag <simplepaint version=" 1 . 0">, 
the end-tag </simplepaint>, and everything in between. The elements that are nested inside 
the root element are represented by their own nodes, which are said to be children of the 
root node. An object of type Element contains several useful methods. If element is of type 
Element, then we have: 

• element . getTagName () — returns a String containing the name that is used in the ele- 
ment's tag. For example, the name of a <curve> element is the string "curve". 

• element . getAttribute (attrName) — if attrName is the name of an attribute in the 
element, then this method returns the value of that attribute. For the element, 
<point x="83" y="42"/>, element. getAttribute ("x") would return the string "83". 
Note that the return value is always a String, even if the attribute is supposed to represent 
a numerical value. If the element has no attribute with the specified name, then the return 
value is an empty string. 

• element . getTextContent () — returns a String containing all the textual content that 
is contained in the element. Note that this includes text that is contained inside other 
elements that are nested inside the element. 

• element .getChildNodesO — returns a value of type NodeList that contains all the Nodes 
that are children of the element. The list includes nodes representing other elements and 
textual content that are directly nested in the element (as well as some other types of node 
that I don't care about here). The getChildNodesO method makes it possible to traverse 
the entire DOM data structure by starting with the root element, looking at children of 
the root element, children of the children, and so on. (There is a similar method that 
returns the attributes of the element, but I won't be using it here.) 

• element .getElementsByTagName(tagName) — returns a NodeList that contains all the 
nodes representing all elements that are nested inside element and which have the given 
tag name. Note that this includes elements that are nested to any level, not just elements 
that are directly contained inside element. The getElementsByTagNameO method allows 
you to reach into the document and pull out specific data that you are interested in. 

An object of type NodeList represents a list of Nodes. Unfortunately, it does not use the 
API defined for lists in the Java Collection Framework. Instead, a value, nodeList, of type 
NodeList has two methods: nodeList . getLengthO returns the number of nodes in the list, 
and nodeList . item(i) returns the node at position i, where the positions are numbered 0, 
1, nodeList . getLengthO - 1. Note that the return value of nodeList . get () is of type 
Node, and it might have to be type-cast to a more specific node type before it is used. 

Knowing just this much, you can do the most common types of processing of DOM rep- 
resentations. Let's look at a few code fragments. Suppose that in the course of processing a 
document you come across an Element node that represents the element 

background red=' 255' green='153' blue='51'/> 

This element might be encountered either while traversing the document with getChildNodes () 
or in the result of a call to getElementsByTagName ( "background" ) . Our goal is to reconstruct 
the data structure represented by the document, and this element represents part of that data. 
In this case, the element represents a color, and the red, green, and blue components are given 



CHAPTER 11. STREAMS, FILES, AND NETWORKING 



577 



by the attributes of the element. If element is a variable that refers to the node, the color can 
be obtained by saying: 

int r = Integer .parselnt( element . get Attribute ("red") ); 
int g = Integer. parselnt( element .get Attribute ("green") ); 
int b = Integer .parselnt( element . get Attribute ("blue") ); 
Color bgColor = new Color(r ,g,b) ; 

Suppose now that element refers to the node that represents the element 
<symmetric>true</symmetric> 

In this case, the element represents the value of a boolean variable, and the value is encoded 
in the textual content of the element. We can recover the value from the element with: 

String bool = element . getTextContent () ; 

boolean symmetric; 

if (bool.equalsC'true")) 

symmetric = true; 
else 

symmetric = false; 

Next, consider an example that uses a NodeList. Suppose we encounter an element that repre- 
sents a list of Points: 

<pointlist> 

<point x='17' y='42'/> 

<point x='23' y='8'/> 

<point x='109' y='342'/> 

<point x='18' y='270'/> 
</pointlist> 

Suppose that element refers to the node that represents the <pointlist> element. Our goal 
is to build the list of type ArrayList<Point> that is represented by the element. We can do 
this by traversing the NodeList that contains the child nodes of element: 

ArrayList<Point> points = new ArrayList<Point> () ; 
NodeList children = element . getChildNodes () ; 
for (int i = 0; i < children. getLengthO ; i++) { 

Node child = children. item(i) ; // One of the child nodes of element, 
if ( child instanceof Element ) { 

Element pointElement = (Element) child; // One of the <point> elements. 

int x = Integer .parselnt( pointElement. getAttributeC'x") ); 

int y = Integer .parselnt( pointElement. getAttributeC'y") ); 

Point pt = new Point(x,y); // Create the Point represented by pointElement. 

points . add (pt) ; // Add the point to the list of points. 

} 

} 

All the nested <point> elements are children of the <pointlist> element. The if statement 
in this code fragment is necessary because an element can have other children in addition to its 
nested elements. In this example, we only want to process the children that are elements. 

All these techniques can be employed to write the file input method for the sample program 
SimplePaintWithXML.java. When building the data structure represented by an XML file, my 
approach is to start with a default data structure and then to modify and add to it as I traverse 
the DOM representation of the file. It's not a trivial process, but I hope that you can follow it:

XML has developed into an extremely important technology, and some applications of it are 
very complex. But there is a core of simple ideas that can be easily applied in Java. Knowing 
just the basics, you can make good use of XML in your own Java programs.

Exercises for Chapter 11 



1. The sample program DirectoryList.java, given as an example in Subsection 11.2.2, will (solution) 
print a list of files in a directory specified by the user. But some of the files in that 
directory might themselves be directories. And the subdirectories can themselves contain 
directories. And so on. Write a modified version of DirectoryList that will list all the 

files in a directory and all its subdirectories, to any level of nesting. You will need a 
recursive subroutine to do the listing. The subroutine should have a parameter of type 
File. You will need the constructor from the File class that has the form 

public File( File dir, String fileName ) 

// Constructs the File object representing a file 
// named fileName in the directory specified by dir. 

2. Write a program that will count the number of lines in each file that is specified on the (solution) 
command line. Assume that the files are text files. Note that multiple files can be specified, 

as in: 

java LineCounts filel.txt file2.txt file3.txt 

Write each file name, along with the number of lines in that file, to standard output. If an 
error occurs while trying to read from one of the files, you should print an error message 
for that file, but you should still process all the remaining files. Do not use TextIO to 
process the files; use a Scanner, a BufferedReader, or a TextReader to process each file. 

3. For this exercise, you will write a network server program. The program is a simple file (solution) 
server that makes a collection of files available for transmission to clients. When the server 

starts up, it needs to know the name of the directory that contains the collection of files. 
This information can be provided as a command-line argument. You can assume that the 
directory contains only regular files (that is, it does not contain any sub-directories). You 
can also assume that all the files are text files. 

When a client connects to the server, the server first reads a one-line command from 
the client. The command can be the string "index". In this case, the server responds by 
sending a list of names of all the files that are available on the server. Or the command can 
be of the form "get <filename>", where <filename> is a file name. The server checks 
whether the requested file actually exists. If so, it first sends the word "ok" as a message 
to the client. Then it sends the contents of the file and closes the connection. Otherwise, 
it sends the word "error" to the client and closes the connection. 

Write a subroutine to handle each request. See the DirectoryList example in Sub- 
section 11.2.2 for help with the problem of getting the list of files in the directory. 

4. Write a client program for the server from Exercise 11.3. Design a user interface that will (solution) 
let the user do at least two things: (1) Get a list of files that are available on the server 

and display the list on standard output; and (2) Get a copy of a specified file from the 
server and save it to a local file (on the computer where the client is running). 

5. The sample program PhoneDirectoryFileDemo.java, from Subsection 11.3.2, stores (solution) 
name/number pairs for a simple phone book in a text file in the user's home directory. 

Modify that program so that it uses an XML format for the data. The only significant 



Exercises 



581 



changes that you will have to make are to the parts of the program that read and write 
the data file. Use the DOM to read the data, as discussed in Subsection 11.5.3. You can 
use the XML format illustrated in the following sample phone directory file: 

<?xml version="l .0"?> 
<phone_directory> 

<entry name= ' barney ' number= ' 890-1203 ' /> 

<entry name='fred' immber= ' 555-9923 ' /> 
</phone_directory> 

(This is just an easy exercise in simple XML processing; as before, the program in this 
exercise is not meant to be a useful phone directory program.) 

6. The sample program Checkers.java from Subsection 7.5.3 lets two players play checkers. (solution) 
It would be nice if, in the middle of a game, the state of the game could be saved to a file. 
Later, the file could be read back into the file to restore the game and allow the players to 
continue. Add the ability to save and load files to the checkers program. Design a simple 
text-based format for the files. Here is a picture of my solution to this exercise, just after 
a file has been loaded into the program: 



9 Q Checkers 




Note: The original checkers program could be run as either an applet or a stand-alone 
application. Since the new version uses files, however, it can only be run as an application. 
An applet running in a web browser is not allowed to access files. 

It's a little tricky to completely restore the state of a game. The program has a 
variable board of type CheckersData that stores the current contents of the board, and it 
has a variable currentPlayer of type int that indicates whether Red or Black is currently 
moving. This data must be stored in the file when a file is saved. When a file is read into the 
program, you should read the data into two local variables newBoard of type CheckersData 
and newCurrentPlayer of type int. Once you have successfully read all the data from 
the file, you can use the following code to set up the program state correctly. This code 
assumes that you have introduced two new variables saveButton and loadButton of type 
JButton to represent the "Save Game" and "Load Game" buttons: 



Exercises 



582 



board = newBoard; // Set up game with data read from file. 

currentPlayer = newCurrentPlayer ; 

legalMoves = board. getLegalMoves (currentPlayer) ; 

selectedRow = -1; 

gamelnProgress = true; 

newGameButton. setEnabled(f alse) ; 

loadButton. setEnabled (false) ; 

saveButton. setEnabled(true) ; 

resignButton. setEnabled (true) ; 

if (currentPlayer == CheckersData. RED) 

message. setText( "Game loaded — it's RED's move."); 
else 

message . setText ("Game loaded — it's BLACK 's move."); 
repaint () ; 

(Note, by the way, that I used a TextReader to read the data from the file into my 
program. TextReader is a non-standard class introduced in Subsection 11.1.4 and defined 
in the file TextReader.java. How to read the data in a file depends, of course, on the 
format that you have chosen for the data.)

Chapter 12 

Threads and Multiprocessing 



In the CLASSIC PROGRAMMING model, there is a single central processing unit that reads 
instructions from memory and carries them out, one after the other. The purpose of a program 
is to provide the list of instructions for the processor to execute. This is the only type of 
programming that we have considered so far. 

However, this model of programming has limitations. Modern computers have multiple 
processors, making it possible for them to perform several tasks at the same time. To use the 
full potential of all those processors, you will need to write programs that can do parallel 
processing . For Java programmers, that means learning about threads. A single thread is 
similar to the programs that you have been writing up until now, but more than one thread 
can be running at the same time, "in parallel." What makes things more interesting — and 
more difficult — than single-threaded programming is the fact that the threads in a parallel 
program are rarely completely independent of one another. They usually need to cooperate 
and communicate. Learning to manage and control cooperation among threads is the main 
hurdle that you will face in this chapter. 

There are several reasons to use parallel programming. One is simply to do computations 
more quickly by setting several processors to work on them simultaneously. Just as important, 
however, is to use threads to deal with "blocking" operations, where a process can't proceed 
until some event occurs. In the previous chapter, for example, we saw how programs can block 
while waiting for data to arrive over a network connection. Threads make it possible for one 
part of a program to continue to do useful work even while another part is blocked, waiting for 
some event to occur. In this context, threads are a vital programming tool even for a computer 
that has only a single processing unit. 

12.1 Introduction to Threads 

Like people, computers can multitask. That is, they can be working on several different (online) 
tasks at the same time. A computer that has just a single central processing unit can't literally 
do two things at the same time, any more than a person can, but it can still switch its attention 
back and forth among several tasks. Furthermore, it is increasingly common for computers to 
have more than one processing unit, and such computers can literally work on several tasks 
simultaneously. It is likely that from now on, most of the increase in computing power will 
come from adding additional processors to computers rather than from increasing the speed of 
individual processors. To use the full power of these multiprocessing computers, a programmer 
must do parallel programming, which means writing a program as a set of several tasks that 



584 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



585 



can be executed simultaneously. Even on a single-processor computer, parallel programming 
techniques can be useful, since some problems can be tackled most naturally by breaking the 
solution into a set of simultaneous tasks that cooperate to solve the problem. 

In Java, a single task is called a thread. The term "thread" refers to a "thread of control" or 
"thread of execution," meaning a sequence of instructions that are executed one after another — 
the thread extends through time, connecting each instruction to the next. In a multithreaded 
program, there can be many threads of control, weaving through time in parallel and forming 
the complete fabric of the program. (Ok, enough with the metaphor, already!) Every Java 
program has at least one thread; when the Java virtual machine runs your program, it creates a 
thread that is responsible for executing the main routine of the program. This main thread can 
in turn create other threads that can continue even after the main thread has terminated. In a 
GUI program, there is at least one additional thread, which is responsible for handling events 
and drawing components on the screen. This GUI thread is created when the first window is 
opened. So in fact, you have already done parallel programming! When a main routine opens a 
window, both the main thread and the GUI thread can continue to run in parallel. Of course, 
parallel programming can be used in much more interesting ways. 

Unfortunately, parallel programming is even more difficult than ordinary, single-threaded 
programming. When several threads are working together on a problem, a whole new category 
of errors is possible. This just means that techniques for writing correct and robust programs 
are even more important for parallel programming than they are for normal programming. 
On the other hand, fortunately, Java has a nice thread API that makes basic uses of threads 
reasonably easy. It also has some standard classes to help with some of the more tricky parts. 
It won't be until midway through Section 12.3 that you'll learn about the low-level techniques 
that are necessary to handle the trickiest parts of parallel programming. 

12.1.1 Creating and Running Threads 

In Java, a thread is represented by an object belonging to the class java. lang. Thread (or to 
a subclass of this class). The purpose of a Thread object is to execute a single method and to 
execute it just once. This method represents the task to be carried out by the thread. The 
method is executed in its own thread of control, which can run in parallel with other threads. 
When the execution of the thread's method is finished, either because the method terminates 
normally or because of an uncaught exception, the thread stops running. Once this happens, 
there is no way to restart the thread or to use the same Thread object to start another thread. 

There are two ways to program a thread. One is to create a subclass of Thread and to define 
the method public void run() in the subclass. This run() method defines the task that will 
be performed by the thread; that is, when the thread is started, it is the run() method that 
will be executed in the thread. For example, here is a simple, and rather useless, class that 
defines a thread that does nothing but print a message on standard output: 

public class NamedThread extends Thread { 

private String name; // The name of this thread. 

public NamedThread (String name) { // Constructor gives name to thread, 
this. name = name; 

} 

public void run() { // The run method prints a message to standard output. 
System. out .printlnC'Greetings from thread "' + name + "'!"); 

} 

} 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



586 



To use a NamedThread, you must of course create an object belonging to this class. For 
example, 

NamedThread greetings = new NamedThreadO'Fred") ; 

However, creating the object does not automatically start the thread running or cause its run() 
method to be executed. To do that, you must call the start () method in the thread object. 
For the example, this would be done with the statement 

greetings . start () ; 

The purpose of the start () method is to create the new thread of control that will execute the 
Thread object's run() method. The new thread runs in parallel with the thread in which the 
start () method was called, along with any other threads that already existed. The start () 
method returns immediately after starting the new thread of control, without waiting for 
the thread to terminate. This means that the code in the thread's run() method executes 
at the same time as the statements that follow the call to the start () method. Consider this 
code segment: 

NamedThread greetings = new NamedThreadO'Fred") ; 
greetings . start () ; 

System. out .println( "Thread has been started"); 

After greetings . start () is executed, there are two threads. One of them will print "Thread 
has been started" while the other one wants to print "Greetings from thread 'Fred'!". It is 
important to note that these messages can be printed in either order. The two threads run 
simultaneously and will compete for access to standard output, so that they can print their 
messages. Whichever thread happens to be the first to get access will be the first to print its 
message. In a normal, single-threaded program, things happen in a definite, predictable order 
from beginning to end. In a multi-threaded program, there is a fundamental indeterminacy. 
You can't be sure what order things will happen in. This indeterminacy is what makes parallel 
programming so difficult! 

Note that calling greetings . start () is very different from calling greetings .run() . 
Calling greetings . run() would execute the run() method in the same thread, rather than 
creating a new thread. This means that all the work of the runQ will be done before the 
computer moves on to the statements that follow the call to greetings . run() . There is no 
parallelism and no indeterminacy.

When a thread 
calls a subroutine, 
there is still 
only one thread

is in the subroutine 
for a time, then

This discussion has assumed that the computer on which the program is running has more 
than one processing unit, so that it is possible for the original thread and the newly created 
thread to literally be executed at the same time. However, it's possible to create multiple 
threads even on a computer that has only one processor (and, more generally, it is possible to 
create many more threads than there are processors, on any computer). In that case, the two 
threads will compete for time on the processor. However, there is still indeterminacy because 
the processor can switch from one thread to another at unpredictable times. In fact, from 
the point of view of the programmer, there is no difference between programming for a single- 
processor computer and programming for a multi-processor computer, and we will pretty much 
ignore the distinction from now on. 

* * * 

I mentioned that there are two ways to program a thread. The first way was to de- 
fine a subclass of Thread. The second is to define a class that implements the interface 
java. lang.Runnable. The Runnable interface defines a single method, public void run(). 
Given a Runnable, it is possible to create a Thread whose task is to execute the Runnable's 
run() method. 

The Thread class has a constructor that takes a Runnable as its parameter. When an object 
that implements the Runnable interface is passed to that constructor, the run() method of the 
thread will simply call the run() method from the Runnable, and calling the thread's start () 
method will create a new thread of control in which the Runnable's run() method is executed. 
For example, as an alternative to the NamedThread class, we could define the class: 

public class NamedRunnable implements Runnable { 

private String name; // The name of this Runnable. 

public NamedRunnable (String name) { // Constructor gives name to object, 
this. name = name; 

} 

public void run() { // The run method prints a message to standard output. 
System. out .printlnC'Greetings from runnable '" + name +"'!"); 

} 

} 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



588 



To use this version of the class, we would create a NamedRunnable object and use that object 
to create an object of type Thread: 

NamedRunnable greetings = new NamedRunnable ( "Fred" ) ; 
Thread greet ingsThread = new Thread (greetings) ; 
greetingsThread. start () ; 

The advantage of doing things this way is that any object can implement the Runnable interface 
and can contain a run() method, which can then be executed in a separate thread. That run() 
method has access to everything in the class, including private variables and methods. The 
disadvantage is that this way of doing things is not very object-oriented: It violates the principle 
that each object should have a single, clearly-defined responsibility. Instead of making some 
random object Runnable just so that you can use it to make a thread, you can consider using 
a nested inner subclass of the Thread class to define the thread. (See Subsection 5.7.2.) 

Finally, I'll note that it is sometimes convenient to define a thread using an anonymous 
inner class (Subsection 5.7.3). For example: 

Thread greet ingsFromFred = new Thread () { 
public void run() { 

System. out .printlnC'Greetings from Fred!"); 

} 

}; 

greetingsFromFred. start () ; 

* * * 

To help you understand how multiple threads are executed in parallel, we consider the sample 
program ThreadTestl.java. This program creates several threads. Each thread performs exactly 
the same task. The task is to count the number of integers less than 1000000 that are prime. 
(The particular task that is done is not important for our purposes here.) This computation 
should take less than a second on a modern computer. The threads that perform this task are 
defined by the following static nested class: 

/** 

* When a thread belonging to this class is run it will count the 

* number of primes between 2 and 1000000. It will print the result 

* to standard output, along with its ID number and the elapsed 

* time between the start and the end of the computation. 
*/ 

private static class CountPrimesThread extends Thread { 

int id; // An id number for this thread; specified in the constructor, 
public CountPrimesThread(int id) { 
this. id = id; 

} 

public void run() { 

long startTime = System. currentTimeMillis () ; 
int count = countPrimes (2, 1000000) ; // Counts the primes, 
long elapsedTime = System. currentTimeMillis () - startTime; 
System. out .printlnC'Thread " + id + " counted " + 

count + " primes in " + (elapsedTime/1000.0) + " seconds."); 

} 

} 

The main program asks the user how many threads to run, and then creates and starts the 
specified number of threads: 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



589 



public static void main (String [] args) { 
int numberOf Threads = 0; 

while (numberOf Threads < 1 I I numberOf Threads > 25) { 

System. out. print ("How many threads do you want to use (1 to 25) ? "); 

numberOf Threads = TextIO . getlnlnt () ; 

if (numberOf Threads < 1 I I numberOf Threads > 25) 

System. out .println( "Please enter a number between 1 and 25 !"); 

> 

System. out .println("\nCreating " + numberOf Threads 

+ " prime -counting threads..."); 
CountPrimesThread [] worker = new CountPrimesThread [numberOf Threads] ; 
for (int i = 0; i < numberOf Threads ; i++) 

worker [i] = new CountPrimesThread ( i ); 
for (int i = 0; i < numberOf Threads ; i++) 

worker [i] . start () ; 
System. out .println( "Threads have been created and started."); 

} 

It would be a good idea for you to compile and run the program or to try the applet version, 
which can be found in the on-line version of this section. 

When I ran the program with one thread on a rather old laptop, it took 1.18 seconds for 
the computer to do the computation. When I ran it using six threads, the output was: 

Creating 6 prime counting threads... 
Threads have been created and started. 
Thread 1 counted 78498 primes in 6.706 seconds. 
Thread 4 counted 78498 primes in 6.693 seconds. 
Thread counted 78498 primes in 6.838 seconds. 
Thread 2 counted 78498 primes in 6.825 seconds. 
Thread 3 counted 78498 primes in 6.893 seconds. 
Thread 5 counted 78498 primes in 6.859 seconds. 

The second line was printed immediately after the first. At this point, the main program 
has ended but the six threads continue to run. After a pause of about seven seconds, all six 
threads completed at about the same time. The order in which the threads complete is not the 
same as the order in which they were started, and the order is indeterminate. That is, if the 
program is run again, the order in which the threads complete will probably be different. 

On this computer, six threads took about six times longer than one thread. This is because 
the computer had only one processor. Six threads, all doing the same task, take six times as 
much processing as one thread. With only one processor to do the work, the total elapsed 
time for six threads is about six times longer than the time for one thread. On a computer 
with two processors, the computer can work on two tasks at the same time, and six threads 
might complete in as little as three times the time it takes for one thread. On a computer with 
six or more processors, six threads might take no more time than a single thread. Because 
of overhead and other reasons, the actual speedup will probably be a little smaller than this 
analysis indicates, but on a multiprocessor machine, you should see a definite speedup. What 
happens when you run the program on your own computer? How many processors do you have? 

Whenever there are more threads to be run than there are processors to run them, the 
computer divides its attention among all the runnable threads by switching rapidly from one 
thread to another. That is, each processor runs one thread for a while then switches to another 
thread and runs that one for a while, and so on. Typically, these "context switches" occur 
about 100 times or more per second. The result is that the computer makes progress on all 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



590 



the tasks, and it looks to the user as if all the tasks are being executed simultaneously. This 
is why in the sample program, in which each thread has the same amount of work to do, all 
the threads complete at about the same time: Over any time period longer than a fraction of 
a second, the computer's time is divided approximately equally among all the threads. 

12.1.2 Operations on Threads 

Much of Java's thread API can be found in the Thread class. However, we'll start with a 
thread-related method in Runtime, a class that allows a Java program to get information about 
the environment in which it is running. When you do parallel programming in order to spread 
the work among several processors, you might want to take into account the number of available 
processors. You might, for example, want to create one thread for each processor. In Java, you 
can find out the number of processors by calling the function 

Runtime . getRuntime . availableProcessors () 

which returns an int giving the number of processors that are available to the Java Virtual 
Machine. In some cases, this might be less than the actual number of processors in the computer. 

* * * 

A Thread object contains several useful methods for working with threads. Most important 
is the start () method, which was discussed above. 

Once a thread has been started, it will continue to run until its run() method ends for some 
reason. Sometimes, it's useful for one thread to be able to tell whether another thread has termi- 
nated. If thrd is an object of type Thread, then the boolean-valued function thrd. isAliveO 
can be used to test whether or not thrd has terminated. A thread is "alive" between the time 
it is started and the time when it terminates. After the thread has terminated it is said to be 
"dead." (The rather gruesome metaphor is also used when we refer to "killing" or "aborting" 
a thread.) Remember that a thread that has terminated cannot be restarted. 

The static method Thread, sleep (milliseconds) causes the thread that executes this 
method to "sleep" for the specified number of milliseconds. A sleeping thread is still alive, 
but it is not running. While a thread is sleeping, the computer can work on any other runnable 
threads (or on other programs). Thread, sleep () can be used to insert a pause in the execution 
of a thread. The sleep () method can throw an exception of type InterruptedException, which is 
a checked exception that requires mandatory exception handling. In practice, this means that 
the sleep () method is usually called inside a try. .catch statement that catches the potential 
InterruptedException: 

try { 

Thread. sleep (lengthOf Pause) ; 

} 

catch (InterruptedException e) { 
} 

One thread can interrupt another thread to wake it up when it is sleeping or paused for certain 
other reasons. A Thread, thrd, can be interrupted by calling the method thrd. interrupt () . 
Doing so can be a convenient way to send a signal from one thread to another. A thread knows 
it has been interrupted when it catches an InterruptedException. Outside the catch handler 
for the exception, the thread can check whether it has been interrupted by calling the static 
method Thread. interruptedO . This method tells whether the current thread — the thread 
that executes the method — has been interrupted. It also has the unusual property of clearing 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



591 



the interrupted status of the thread, so you only get one chance to check for an interruption. 
In your own programs, your threads are not going to be interrupted unless you interrupt them. 
So most often, you are not likely to need to do anything in response to an Interrupted Exception 
(except to catch it). 

Sometimes, it's necessary for one thread to wait for another thread to die. This is done with 
the joinQ method from the Thread class. Suppose that thrd is a Thread. Then, if another 
thread calls thrd. join(), that other thread will go to sleep until thrd terminates. If thrd is 
already dead when thrd. join() is called, then it simply has no effect. The join() method can 
throw an InterruptedException, which must be handled as usual. As an example, the following 
code starts several threads, waits for them all to terminate, and then outputs the elapsed time: 

CountPrimesThread [] worker = new CountPrimesThread [numberOf Threads] ; 
long startTime = System. currentTimeMillis () ; 
for (int i = 0; i < numberOf Threads ; i++) { 

worker [i] = new CountPrimesThread () ; 

worker [i] . start ( ) ; 

} 

for (int i = 0; i < numberOf Threads ; i++) { 
try { 

worker [i] . joinO ; // Wait until worker[i] finishes, if it hasn't already. 

} 

catch (InterruptedException e) { 
} 

} 

// At this point, all the worker threads have terminated, 
long elapsedTime = System. currentTimeMillis () - startTime; 

System. out .println( "Total elapsed time: " + (elapsedTime/1000 . 0) + " seconds"); 

An observant reader will note that this code assumes that no InterruptedException will occur. 
To be absolutely sure that the thread worker [i] has terminated in an environment where 
InterruptedExceptions are possible, you would have to do something like: 

while (worker [i] . isAlive () ) { 
try { 

worker [i] . joinO ; 

} 

catch (InterruptedException e) { 
} 

} 

Another version of the joinO method takes an integer parameter that specifies the maxi- 
mum number of milliseconds to wait. A call to thrd. join (m) will wait until either thrd has 
terminated or until m milliseconds have elapsed. This can be used to allow a thread to wake 
up occasionally to perform some task while it is waiting. Here, for example, is a code segment 
that will start a thread, thrd, and then will output a period every two seconds as long as thrd 
continues to run: 

System. out. print ("Running the thread "); 
thrd. start () ; 
while (thrd. isAliveO ) { 
try { 

thrd. join(2000) ; 

System . out . print ("."); 

} 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



592 



catch (InterruptedException e) { 
} 

} 

System. out .printlnC Done!"); 

* * * 

Threads have two properties that are occasionally useful: a daemon status and a priority. A 
Thread thrd can be designated as a daemon thread by calling thrd. setDaemon(true) . This 
must be done before the thread is started, and it can throw an exception of type SecurityExcep- 
tion if the calling thread is not allowed to modify thrd's properties. This has only one effect: 
The Java Virtual Machine will exit as soon as there are no non-daemon threads that are still 
alive. That is, the fact that a daemon thread is still alive is not enough to keep the Java Virtual 
Machine running. A daemon thread might exist, for example, only to provide some service to 
other, non-daemon threads. When there are no more non-daemon threads, there will be no 
further call for the daemon thread's services, so the program might as well shut down. 

The priority of a thread is a more important property. Every thread has a priority, specified 
as an integer. A thread with a greater priority value will be run in preference to a thread with a 
smaller priority. For example, computations that can be done in the background, when no more 
important thread has work to do, can be run with a low priority. In the next section, we will see 
how this can be useful in GUI programs. If thrd is of type Thread, then thrd.getPriorityO 
returns the integer that specifies thrd's priority, and thrd. setPriority (p) can be used to set 
its priority to a given integer, p. 

Priorities cannot be arbitrary integers, and thrd. setPriority () will throw an HlegalArgu- 
mentException if the specified priority is not in the legal range for the thread. The range of legal 
priority values can differ from one computer to another. The range of legal values is specified 
by the constants Thread. MIN_PRIORITY and Thread. MAX_PRIORITY, but a given thread might 
be further restricted to values less than Thread. MAX_PRIORITY. The default priority is given 
by Thread. N0RM_PRI0RITY. To set thrd to run with a priority value just below the normal 
priority, you can call 

thrd.setPriority( Thread . N0RM_PRI0RITY - 1 ); 

Note that thrd. setPriority () can also throw an exception of type Security Exception, if 
the thread that calls the method is not allowed to set the priority of thrd. 

Finally, I'll note that the static method Thread, current Thread () returns the current 
thread. That is, the return value of this method is the thread that executed the method. 
This allows a thread to get a reference to itself, so that it can modify its own proper- 
ties. For example, you can determine the priority of the currently running thread by calling 
Thread . current Thread ( ) . getPriority ( ) . 

12.1.3 Mutual Exclusion with "synchronized" 

It's pretty easy to program several threads to carry out completely independent tasks. The real 
difficulty arises when threads have to interact in some way. One way that threads interact is 
by sharing resources. When two threads need access to the same resource, such as a variable or 
a window on the screen, some care must be taken that they don't try to use the same resource 
at the same time. Otherwise, the situation could be something like this: Imagine several cooks 
sharing the use of just one measuring cup, and imagine that Cook A fills the measuring cup 
with milk, only to have Cook B grab the cup before Cook A has a chance to empty the milk 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



593 



into his bowl. There has to be some way for Cook A to claim exclusive rights to the cup while 
he performs the two operations: Add-Milk-To-Cup and Empty-Cup-Into-Bowl. 

Something similar happens with threads, even with something as simple as adding one to a 
counter. The statement 

count = count + 1 ; 
is actually a sequence of three operations: 

Step 1 . Get the value of count 

Step 2. Add 1 to the value. 

Step 3. Store the new value in count 

Suppose that several threads perform these three steps. Remember that it's possible for two 
threads to run at the same time, and even if there is only one processor, it's possible for that 
processor to switch from one thread to another at any point. Suppose that while one thread is 
between Step 2 and Step 3, another thread starts executing the same sequence of steps. Since 
the first thread has not yet stored the new value in count, the second thread reads the old 
value of count and adds one to that old value. Both threads have computed the same new 
value for count, and both threads then go on to store that value back into count by executing 
Step 3. After both threads have done so, the value of count has gone up only by 1 instead of 
by 2! This type of problem is called a race condition. This occurs when one thread is in the 
middle of a multi-step operation, and another thread can change some value or condition that 
the first thread is depending upon. (The first thread is "in a race" to complete all the steps 
before it is interrupted by another thread.) 

Another example of a race condition can occur in an if statement. Consider the following 
statement, which is meant to avoid a division- by-zero error: 

if (A != ) 
B = C / A; 

Suppose that this statement is executed by some thread. If the variable A is shared by one 
or more other threads, and if nothing is done to guard against the race condition, then it is 
possible that one of those other threads will change the value of A to zero between the time 
that the first thread checks the condition A ! = and the time that it does the division. This 
means that the thread can end up dividing by zero, even though it just checked that A was not 
zero! 

To fix the problem of race conditions, there has to be some way for a thread to get exclusive 
access to a shared resource. This is not a trivial thing to implement, but Java provides a high- 
level and relatively easy-to-use approach to exclusive access. It's done with synchronized 
methods and with the synchronized statement. These are used to protect shared resources 
by making sure that only one thread at a time will try to access the resource. Synchronization in 
Java actually provides only mutual exclusion, which means that exclusive access to a resource 
is only guaranteed if every thread that needs access to that resource uses synchronization. 
Synchronization is like a cook leaving a note that says, "I'm using the measuring cup." This 
will get the cook exclusive access to the cup — but only if all the cooks agree to check the note 
before trying to grab the cup. 

Because this is a difficult topic, I will start with a simple example. Suppose that we want 
to avoid the race condition that occurs when several threads all want to add 1 to a counter. We 
can do this by defining a class to represent the counter and by using synchronized methods in 
that class. A method is declared to be synchronized by adding the reserved word synchronized 
as a modifier to the definition of the method: 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



594 



public class ThreadSaf eCounter { 

private int count =0; // The value of the counter. 

synchronized public void increment () { 
count = count + 1 ; 

} 

synchronized public int getValueO ■[ 
return count ; 

} 

} 

If tsc is of type ThreadSafeCounter, then any thread can call tsc . increment () to add 1 to 
the counter in a completely safe way. The fact that tsc . increment () is synchronized means 
that only one thread can be in this method at a time; once a thread starts executing this 
method, it is guaranteed that it will finish executing it without having another thread change 
the value of tsc . count in the meantime. There is no possibility of a race condition. Note that 
the guarantee depends on the fact that count is a private variable. This forces all access to 
tsc . count to occur in the synchronized methods that are provided by the class. If count were 
public, it would be possible for a thread to bypass the synchronization by, for example, saying 
tsc.count++. This could change the value of count while another thread is in the middle 
of tsc . increment () . Remember that synchronization by itself does not guarantee exclusive 
access; it only guarantees mutual exclusion among all the threads that are synchronized. 

The ThreadSafeCounter class does not prevent all possible race conditions that might arise 
when using a counter. Consider the if statement: 

if ( tsc. get Value () == ) 
doSomethingO ; 

where doSomethingO is some method that requires the value of the counter to be zero. There 
is still a race condition here, which occurs if a second thread increments the counter between 
the time the first thread tests t sc. get Value () == and the time it executes doSomethingO. 
The first thread needs exclusive access to the counter during the execution of the whole if 
statement. (The synchronization in the ThreadSafeCounter class only gives it exclusive access 
during the time it is evaluating tsc . getValue () .) We can solve the race condition by putting 
the if statement in a synchronized statement: 

synchronized(tsc) { 

if ( tsc. get Value () == ) 
doSomethingO ; 

} 

Note that the synchronized statement takes an object — tsc in this case — as a kind of param- 
eter. The syntax of the synchronized statement is: 

synchronized ( (object) ) { 
(statements ) 

y 

In Java, mutual exclusion is always associated with an object; we say that the synchronization 
is "on" that object. For example, the if statement above is "synchronized on tsc." A synchro- 
nized instance method, such as those in the class ThreadSafeCounter, is synchronized on the 
object that contains the instance method. In fact, adding the synchronized modifier to the 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



595 



definition of an instance method is pretty much equivalent to putting the body of the method 
in a synchronized statement of the form synchronized(this) {...}. It is also possible to 
have synchronized static methods; a synchronized static method is synchronized on the special 
class object that represents the class containing the static method. 

The real rule of synchronization in Java is this: Two threads cannot be synchronized 
on the same object at the same time; that is, they cannot simultaneously be executing 
code segments that are synchronized on that object. If one thread is synchronized on an object, 
and a second thread tries to synchronize on the same object, the second thread is forced to 
wait until the first thread has finished with the object. This is implemented using something 
called a synchronization lock. Every object has a synchronization lock, and that lock can 
be "held" by only one thread at a time. To enter a synchronized statement or synchronized 
method, a thread must obtain the associated object's lock. If the lock is available, then the 
thread obtains the lock and immediately begins executing the synchronized code. It releases 
the lock after it finishes executing the synchronized code. If Thread A tries to obtain a lock 
that is already held by Thread B, then Thread A has to wait until Thread B releases the lock. 
In fact, Thread A will go to sleep, and will not be awoken until the lock becomes available. 

* * * 

As a simple example of shared resources, we return to the prime-counting problem. In this 
case, instead of having every thread perform exactly the same task, we'll do some real parallel 
processing. The program will count the prime numbers in a given range of integers, and it will 
do so by dividing the work up among several threads. Each thread will be assigned a part of 
the full range of integers, and it will count the primes in its assigned part. At the end of its 
computation, the thread has to add its count to the overall total of primes in the entire range. 
The variable that represents the total is shared by all the threads, since each thread has to add 
a number to the total. If each thread just says 

total = total + count; 

then there is a (small) chance that two threads will try to do this at the same time and that the 
final total will be wrong. To prevent this race condition, access to total has to be synchronized. 
My program uses a synchronized method to add the counts to the total. This method is called 
once by each thread: 

synchronized private static void addToTotal(int x) { 
total = total + x; 

System. out .println (total + " primes found so far."); 

} 

The source code for the program can be found in ThreadTest2.java. This program counts 
the primes in the range 3000001 to 6000000. (The numbers are rather arbitrary.) The main() 
routine in this program creates between 1 and 5 threads and assigns part of the job to each 
thread. It waits for all the threads to finish, using the join() method as described above. It 
then reports the total number of primes found, along with the elapsed time. Note that join() 
is required here, since it doesn't make sense to report the number of primes until all of the 
threads have finished. 

If you run the program on a multiprocessor computer, it should take less time for the 
program to run when you use more than one thread. You can compile and run the program or 
try the equivalent applet in the on-line version of this section.

CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING

Synchronization can help to prevent race conditions, but it introduces the possibility of 
another type of error, deadlock. A deadlock occurs when a thread waits forever for a resource 
that it will never get. In the kitchen, a deadlock might occur if two very simple-minded cooks 
both want to measure a cup of milk at the same time. The first cook grabs the measuring cup, 
while the second cook grabs the milk. The first cook needs the milk, but can't find it because 
the second cook has it. The second cook needs the measuring cup, but can't find it because 
the first cook has it. Neither cook can continue and nothing more gets done. This is deadlock. 
Exactly the same thing can happen in a program, for example if there are two threads (like the 
two cooks) both of which need to obtain locks on the same two objects (like the milk and the 
measuring cup) before they can proceed. Deadlocks can easily occur, unless great care is taken 
to avoid them. 

12.1.4 Volatile Variables 

Synchronization is only one way of controlling communication among threads. We will cover 
several other techniques later in the chapter. For now, we finish this section with one more 
communication technique: volatile variables. 

In general, threads communicate by sharing variables and accessing those variables in syn- 
chronized methods or synchronized statements. However, synchronization is fairly expensive 
computationally, and excessive use of it should be avoided. So in some cases, it can make sense 
for threads to refer to shared variables without synchronizing their access to those variables. 

However, a subtle problem arises when the value of a shared variable is set in one thread 
and used in another. Because of the way that threads are implemented in Java, the second 
thread might not see the changed value of the variable immediately. That is, it is possible that 
a thread will continue to see the old value of the shared variable for some time after the value 
of the variable has been changed by another thread. This is because threads are allowed to 
cache shared data. That is, each thread can keep its own local copy of the shared data. When 
one thread changes the value of a shared variable, the local copies in the caches of other threads 
are not immediately changed, so the other threads can continue to see the old value, at least 
briefly. 

When a synchronized method or statement is entered, threads are forced to update their 
caches to the most current values of the variables in the cache. So, using shared variables in 
synchronized code is always safe. 

It is possible to use a shared variable safely outside of synchronized code, but in that case, 
the variable must be declared to be volatile. The volatile keyword is a modifier that can be 
added to a variable declaration, as in 

private volatile int count; 

If a variable is declared to be volatile, no thread will keep a local copy of that variable in its 
cache. Instead, the thread will always use the official, main copy of the variable. This means 
that any change that is made to the variable will immediately be visible to all threads. This 
makes it safe for threads to refer to volatile shared variables even outside of synchronized 
code. Access to volatile variables is less efficient than access to non-volatile variables, but more 
efficient than using synchronization. (Remember, though, that synchronization is still the only 
way to prevent race conditions.) 

When the volatile modifier is applied to an object variable, only the variable itself is 
declared to be volatile, not the contents of the object that the variable points to. For this 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



597 



reason, volatile is used mostly for variables of simple types such as primitive types and 
enumerated types. 

A typical example of using volatile variables is to send a signal from one thread to another 
that tells the second thread to terminate. The two threads would share a variable 

volatile boolean terminate = false; 

The run method of the second thread would check the value of terminate frequently, and it 
would end when the value of terminate becomes true: 

public void run() { 

while ( terminate == false ) { 

//Do some work. 

> 

} 

This thread will run until some other thread sets the value of terminate to true. Something 
like this is really the only clean way for one thread to cause another thread to die. 

(By the way, you might be wondering why threads should use local data caches in the first 
place, since it seems to complicate things unnecessarily. Caching is allowed because of the 
structure of multiprocessing computers. In many multiprocessing computers, each processor 
has some local memory that is directly connected to the processor. A thread's cache can be 
stored in the local memory of the processor on which the thread is running. Access to this local 
memory is much faster than access to other memory, so it is more efficient for a thread to use 
a local copy of a shared variable rather than some "master copy" that is stored in nondocal 
memory.) 

12.2 Programming with Threads 

Threads introduce new complexity into programming, but they are an important tool and (online) 
will only become more essential in the future. So, every programmer should know some of the 
fundamental design patterns that are used with threads. In this section, we will look at some 
basic techniques, with more to come as the chapter progresses. 

12.2.1 Threads Versus Timers 

One of the most basic uses of threads is to perform some period task at set intervals. In fact, this 
is so basic that there is a specialized class for performing this task — and you've already worked 
with it. The Timer class, in package javax. swing, can generate a sequence of ActionEvents 
separated by a specified time interval. Timers were introduced in Section 6.5, where they 
were used to implement animations. Behind the scenes, a Timer uses a thread. The thread 
sleeps most of the time, but it wakes up periodically to generate the events associated with the 
timer. Before timers were introduced, threads had to be used directly to implement a similar 
functionality. 

In a typical use of a timer for animation, each event from the timer causes a new frame of 
the animation to be computed and displayed. In the response to the event, it is only necessary 
to update some state variables and to repaint the display to reflect the changes. A Timer to do 
that every thirty milliseconds might be created like this: 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



598 



Timer timer = new Timer ( 30, new ActionListener () { 
public void actionPerf ormed(ActionEvent evt) { 
updateForNextFrame () ; 
display. repaint () ; 

} 

} ); 

timer . start () ; 

Suppose that we wanted to do the same thing with a thread. The run() method of the 
thread would have to execute a loop in which the thread sleeps for 30 milliseconds, then wakes 
up to do the updating and repainting. This could be implemented in a nested class as follows 
using the method Thread, sleep () that was discussed in Subsection 12.1.2: 

private class Animator extends Thread { 
public void run() { 
while (true) { 
try { 

Thread . sleep (30) ; 

} 

catch (InterruptedException e) { 
> 

updateForNextFrame () ; 
display . repaint () ; 

} 

> 

} 

To run the animation, you would create an object belonging to this class and call its start () 
method. As it stands, there would be no way to stop the animation once it is started. One way 
to make it possible to stop the animation would be to end the loop when a volatile boolean 
variable, terminate, becomes true, as discussed in Subsection 12.1.4. Since thread objects can 
only be executed once, in order to restart the animation after it has been stopped, it would be 
necessary to create a new thread. In the next section, we'll see some more versatile techniques 
for controlling threads. 

There is a subtle difference between using threads and using timers for animation. The 
thread that is used by a Swing Timer does nothing but generate events. The event-handling 
code that is executed in response to those events is actually executed in the Swing event- 
handling thread, which also handles repainting of components and responses to user actions. 
This is important because the Swing GUI is not thread-safe. That is, it does not use synchro- 
nization to avoid race conditions among threads trying to access GUI components and their 
state variables. As long as everything is done in the Swing event thread, there is no prob- 
lem. A problem can arise when another thread manipulates components or the variables that 
they use. In the Animator example given above, this could happen when the thread calls the 
updateForNextFrame () method. The variables that are modified in updateForNextFrame () 
would also be used by the paintComponent () method that draws the frame. There is a race 
condition here: If these two methods are being executed simultaneously, there is a possibility 
that paintComponent () will use inconsistent variable values — some appropriate for the new 
frame, some for the previous frame. 

One solution to this problem would be to declare both paintComponent () and 
updateForNextFrame () to be synchronized methods. The real solution in this case is to 
use a timer rather than a thread. In practice, race conditions are not likely to be an issue for 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



599 



simple animations, even if they are implemented using threads. But it can become a real issue 
when threads are used for more complex tasks. 

I should note that the repaint () method of a component can be safely called from any 
thread, without worrying about synchronization. Recall that repaint () does not actually do 
any painting itself. It just tells the system to schedule a paint event. The actual painting will 
be done later, in the Swing event-handling thread. I will also note that Java has another timer 
class, java.util. Timer, that is appropriate for use in non-GUI programs. 

The sample program RandomArtWithThreads.java uses a thread to drive a very simple 
animation. You can compare it to RandomArtPanel.java, from Section 6.5, which implemented 
the same animation with a timer. 

12.2.2 Recursion in a Thread 

Although timers should be used in preference to threads when possible, there are times when 
it is reasonable to use a thread even for a straightforward animation. One reason to do so is 
when the thread is running a recursive algorithm, and you want to repaint the display many 
times over the course of the recursion. (Recursion is covered in Section 9.1.) It's difficult to 
drive a recursive algorithm with a series of events from a timer; it's much more natural to use 
a single recursive method call to do the recursion, and it's easy to do that in a thread. 

As an example, the program QuicksortThreadDemo.java uses an animation to illustrate the 
recursive QuickSort algorithm for sorting an array. In this case, the array contains colors, and 
the goal is to sort the colors into a standard spectrum from red to violet. You can see the 
program as an applet in the on-line version of this section. In the program, the user randomizes 
the array and starts the sorting process by clicking the "Start" button below the display. The 
"Start" button changes to a "Finish" button that can be used to abort the sort before it finishes 
on its own. 

In this program, the display's repaint () method is called every time the algorithm makes a 
change to the array. Whenever this is done, the thread sleeps for 100 milliseconds to allow time 
for the display to be repainted and for the user to see the change. There is also a longer delay, one 
full second, just after the array is randomized, before the sorting starts. Since these delays occur 
at several points in the code, Quicksort ThreadDemo defines a delay () method that makes the 
thread that calls it sleep for a specified period. The delayO method calls display .repaint () 
just before sleeping. While the animation thread sleeps, the event-handling thread will have a 
chance to run and will have plenty of time to repaint the display. 

An interesting question is how to implement the "Finish" button, which should abort the 
sort and terminate the thread. Pressing this button causes the value of a volatile boolean 
variable, running, to be set to false, as a signal to the thread that it should terminate. The 
problem is that this button can be clicked at any time, even when the algorithm is many levels 
down in the recursion. Before the thread can terminate, all of those recursive method calls must 
return. A nice way to cause that is to throw an exception. Quicksort ThreadDemo defines a new 
exception class, ThreadTerminationException, for this purpose. The delay () method checks the 
value of the signal variable, running. If running is false, the delayO method throws the 
exception that will cause the recursive algorithm, and eventually the animation thread itself, 
to terminate. Here, then, is the delayO method: 

private void delay (int millis) { 
if ( ! running) 

throw new ThreadTerminationExceptionO ; 
display. repaint () ; 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



600 



try { 

Thread. sleep(millis) ; 

} 

catch (InterruptedException e) { 
} 

if (! running) // Check again, in case it changed during the sleep period, 
throw new ThreadTerminationExceptionO ; 

} 

The ThreadTerminationException is caught in the thread's run() method: 
/** 

* This class defines the threads that run the recursive 

* Quicksort algorithm. The thread begins by randomizing the 

* array, hue. It then calls quickSortO to sort the entire array. 

* If quicksort () is aborted by a ThreadTerminationException, 

* which would be caused by the user clicking the Finish button, 

* then the thread will restore the array to sorted order before 

* terminating, so that whether or not the quicksort is aborted, 

* the array ends up sorted. 
*/ 

private class Runner extends Thread { 
public void run() { 
try { 

for (int i = hue . length-1 ; i > 0; i — ) { // Randomize array, 
int r = (int) ((i+l)*Math.random()) ; 
int temp = hue [r] ; 
hue [r] = hue [i] ; 
hue [i] = temp; 

} 

delay(lOOO) ; // Wait one second before starting the sort, 
quicksort (0 , hue . length-1) ; // Sort the whole array, recursively. 

} 

catch (ThreadTerminationException e) { // User clicked "Finish" . 
for (int i = 0; i < hue. length; i++) 
hue [i] = i ; 

} 

finally {// Make sure running is false and button label is correct, 
running = false; 
startButton. setText(" Start") ; 
display. repaint () ; 

} 

> 

} 

The program uses a variable, runner, of type Runner to represent the thread that does the 
sorting. When the user clicks the "Start" button, the following code is executed to create and 
start the thread: 

startButton . setText ( "Finish" ) ; 
runner = new Runner ( ) ; 

running = true; // Set the signal before starting the thread! 
runner . start () ; 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



601 



Note that the value of the signal variable running is set to true before starting the thread. 
If running were false when the thread was started, the thread might see that value as soon 
as it starts and interpret it as a signal to stop before doing anything. Remember that when 
runner . start () is called, runner starts running in parallel with the thread that called it. 

Stopping the thread is a little more interesting, because the thread might be sleeping when 
the "Finish" button is pressed. The thread has to wake up before it can act on the signal that it 
is to terminate. To make the thread a little more responsive, we can call runner . interrupt () , 
which will wake the thread if it is sleeping. (See Subsection 12.1.2.) This doesn't have much 
practical effect in this program, but it does make the program respond noticeably more quickly 
if the user presses "Finish" immediately after pressing "Start," while the thread is sleeping for 
a full second. 

12.2.3 Threads for Background Computation 

In order for a GUI program to be responsive — that is, to respond to events very soon after they 
are generated — it's important that event-handling methods in the program finish their work 
very quickly. Remember that events go into a queue as they are generated, and the computer 
cannot respond to an event until after the event-handler methods for previous events have done 
their work. This means that while one event handler is being executed, other events will have 
to wait. If an event handler takes a while to run, the user interface will effectively freeze up 
during that time. This can be very annoying if the delay is more than a fraction of a second. 
Fortunately, modern computers can do an awful lot of computation in a fraction of a second. 

However, some computations are too big to be done in event handlers. The solution, in that 
case, is to do the computation in another thread that runs in parallel with the event-handling 
thread. This makes it possible for the computer to respond to user events even while the 
computation is ongoing. We say that the computation is done "in the background." 

Note that this application of threads is very different from the previous example. When a 
thread is used to drive a simple animation, it actually does very little work. The thread only 
has to wake up several times each second, do a few computations to update state variables for 
the next frame of the animation, and call repaint () to cause the next frame to be displayed. 
There is plenty of time while the thread is sleeping for the computer to redraw the display and 
handle any other events generated by the user. 

When a thread is used for background computation, however, we want to keep the com- 
puter as busy as possible working on the computation. The thread will compete for proces- 
sor time with the event-handling thread; if you are not careful, event-handling — repainting in 
particular — can still be delayed. Fortunately, you can use thread priorities to avoid the problem. 
By setting the computation thread to run at a lower priority than the event-handling thread, 
you make sure that events will be processed as quickly as possible, while the computation thread 
will get all the extra processing time. Since event handling generally uses very little processing 
time, this means that most of the processing time goes to the background computation, but 
the interface is still very responsive. (Thread priorities were discussed in Subsection 12.1.2.) 

The sample program BackgroundComputationDemo.java is an example of background pro- 
cessing. This program creates an image that takes some time to compute. The program uses 
some techniques for working with images that will not be covered until Subsection 13.1.1, for 
now all that you need to know is that it takes some computation to compute the color of each 
pixel in the image. The image itself is a piece of a mathematical object known as the Mandel- 
brot set. We will use the same image in several examples in this chapter, and will return to the 
Mandelbrot set in Section 13.5. 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



602 



In outline, BackgroundComputationDemo is similar to the Quicksort ThreadDemo discussed 
above. The computation is done in a thread defined by a nested class, Runner. A volatile 
boolean variable, running, is used to control the thread. If the value of running is set to 
false, the thread should terminate. The sample program has a button that the user clicks to 
start and to abort the computation. The difference is that the thread in this case is meant to 
run continuously, without sleeping. To allow the user to see that progress is being made in the 
computation (always a good idea), every time the thread computes a row of pixels, it copies 
those pixels to the image that is shown on the screen. The user sees the image being built up 
line-by-line. 

When the computation thread is created in response to the "Start" button, we need to set 
it to run at a priority lower than the event-handling thread. The code that creates the thread 
is itself running in the event-handling thread, so we can use a priority that is one less than 
the priority of the thread that is executing the code. Note that the priority is set inside a 
try. .catch statement. If an error occurs while trying to set the thread priority, the program 
will still work, though perhaps not as smoothly as it would if the priority was correctly set. 
Here is how the thread is created and started: 

runner = new Runner ( ) ; 
try { 

runner . setPriority( Thread. current ThreadO .getPriorityO - 1 ); 

} 

catch (Exception e) { 

System. out .println( "Error : Can't set thread priority: " + e) ; 

} 

running = true; // Set the signal before starting the thread! 
runner . start () ; 

The other major point of interest in this program is that we have two threads that are both 
using the object that represents the image. The computation thread accesses the image in order 
to set the color of its pixels. The event-handling thread accesses the same image when it copies 
the image to the screen. Since the image is a resource that is shared by several threads, access 
to the image object should be synchronized. When the paintComponent () method copies the 
image to the screen (using a method that we have not yet covered), it does so in a synchronized 
statement: 

synchronized (image) { 

g . drawlmage ( image, 0,0, null) ; 

} 

When the computation thread sets the colors of a row of pixels (using another unfamiliar 
method), it also uses synchronized: 

synchronized(image) { 

image. setRGB(0, row, width, 1, rgb, 0, width); 

} 

Note that both of these statements are synchronized on the same object, image. This is es- 
sential. In order to prevent the two code segments from being executed simultaneously, the 
synchronization must be on the same object. I use the image object here because it is conve- 
nient, but just about any object would do; it is not required that you synchronize on the object 
to which you are trying to control access. 

Although BackgroundComputationDemo works OK, there is one problem: The goal is to get 
the computation done as quickly as possible, using all available processing time. The program 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



603 



accomplishes that goal on a computer that has only one processor. But on a computer that has 
several processors, we are still using only one of those processors for the computation. It would 
be nice to get all the processors working on the problem. To do that, we need real parallel 
processing, with several computation threads. We turn to that problem next. 

12.2.4 Threads for Multiprocessing 

Our next example, MultiprocessingDemol.java, is a variation on BackgroundComputationDemo. 
Instead of doing the computation in a single thread, MultiprocessingDemol can divide the 
problem among several threads. The user can select the number of threads to be used. Each 
thread is assigned one section of the image to compute. The threads perform their tasks in 
parallel. For example, if there are two threads, the first thread computes the top half of the 
image while the second thread computes the bottom half. Here is picture of the program in the 
middle of a computation using three threads. The gray areas represent parts of the image that 
have not yet been computed: 






Start Again! 


Use 3 threads. | ▼ 







You should try out the program. An applet version is on-line. On a multi-processor computer, 
the computation will complete more quickly when using several threads than when using just 
one. Note that when using one thread, this program has the same behavior as the previous 
example program. 

The approach used in this example for dividing up the problem among threads is not optimal. 
We will see in the next section how it can be improved. However, MultiprocessingDemol makes 
a good first example of multiprocessing. 

When the user clicks the "Start" button, the program has to create and start the specified 
number of threads, and it has to assign a segment of the image to each thread. Here is how 
this is done: 

workers = new Runner [threadCount] ; // Holds the computation threads. 

int rowsPerThread; // How many rows of pixels should each thread compute? 

rowsPerThread = height / threadCount; // (height = vertical size of image) 

running = true; // Set the signal before starting the threads! 

threadsCompleted =0; // Records how many of the threads have terminated. 

for (int i = 0; i < threadCount; i++) { 

int startRow; // first row computed by thread number i 
int endRow; // last row computed by thread number i 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



604 



// Create and start a thread to compute the rows of the image from 

// startRow to endRow. Note that we have to make sure that 

// the endRow for the last thread is the bottom row of the image. 

startRow = rowsPerThread*i ; 

if (i == threadCount-1) 
endRow = height- 1; 

else 

endRow = rowsPerThread* (i+1) - 1; 
workers [i] = new Runner (startRow, endRow); 
try { 

workers [i] . setPriority( Thread. currentThreadO . getPriority () - 1 ); 

> 

catch (Exception e) { 
> 

workers [i] . start () ; 

} 

Beyond creating more than one thread, very few changes are needed to get the benefits of 
multiprocessing. Just as in the previous example, each time a thread has computed the colors 
for a row of pixels, it copies that row into the image, and synchronization is used in exactly the 
same way to control access to the image. 

One thing is new, however. When all the threads have finished running, the name of the 
button in the program changes from "Abort" to "Start Again" , and the pop-up menu, which has 
been disabled while the threads were running, is re-enabled. The problem is, how to tell when 
all the threads have terminated? (You might think about why we can't use join() to wait for 
the threads to end, as was done in the example in Subsection 12.1.2; at least, we can't do that 
in the event-handling thread!) In this example, I use an instance variable, threadsCompleted, 
to keep track of how many threads have terminated so far. As each thread finishes, it calls a 
method that adds one to the value of this variable. (The method is called in the finally clause 
of a try statement to make absolutely sure that it is called.) When the number of threads that 
have finished is equal to the number of threads that were created, the method updates the state 
of the program appropriately. Here is the method: 

synchronized private void threadFinishedO { 
threadsCompleted++ ; 

if (threadsCompleted == workers . length) { // All threads have finished. 
startButton. setText ( "Start Again") ; 
startButton. setEnabled(true) ; 

running = false; // Make sure running is false after the threads end. 
workers = null; // Discard the array that holds the threads. 
threadCountSelect . setEnabled(true) ; // Re-enable pop-up menu. 

> 

} 

Note that this method is synchronized. This is to avoid the race condition when 
threadsCompleted is incremented. Without the synchronization, it is possible that two threads 
might call the method at the same time. If the timing is just right, both threads could read 
the same value for threadsCompleted and get the same answer when they increment it. The 
net result will be that threadsCompleted goes up by one instead of by two. One thread is not 
properly counted, and threadsCompleted will never become equal to the number of threads 
created. The program would hang in a kind of deadlock. The problem would occur only very 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



605 



rarely, since it depends on exact timing. But in a large program, problems of this sort can be 
both very serious and very hard to debug. Proper synchronization makes the error impossible. 

12.3 Threads and Parallel Processing 

The example at the end of the previous section used parallel processing to execute pieces (online) 
of a large task. On a computer that has several processors, this allows the computation to be 
completed more quickly. However, the way that the program divided up the computation into 
subtasks was not optimal. Nor was the way that the threads were managed. In this section, 
we will look at two more versions of that program. The first improves the way the problem is 
decomposed into subtasks. The second improves the way threads are used. Along the way, I'll 
introduce a couple of built-in classes that Java provides to support parallel processing. Later in 
the section, I will cover wait() and notifyO, lower-level methods that can be used to control 
parallel processes more directly. 

12.3.1 Problem Decomposition 

The sample program MultiprocessingDemol.java divides the task of computing an image into 
several subtasks and assigns each subtask to a thread. While this works OK, there is a problem: 
Some of the subtasks might take substantially longer than others. The program divides the 
image up into equal parts, but the fact is that some parts of the image require more computation 
than others. In fact, if you run the program with three threads, you'll notice that the middle 
piece takes longer to compute than the top or bottom piece. In general, when dividing a 
problem into subproblems, it is very hard to predict just how much time it will take to solve 
each subproblem. Let's say that one particular subproblem happens to take a lot longer than all 
the others. The thread that computes that subproblem will continue to run for a relatively long 
time after all the other threads have completed. During that time, only one of the computer's 
processors will be working; the rest will be idle. 

As a simple example, suppose that your computer has two processors. You divide the 
problem into two subproblems and create a thread to run each subproblem Your hope is that 
by using both processors, you can get your answer in half the time that it would take when 
using one processor. But if one subproblem takes four times longer than the other to solve, 
then for most of the time, only one processor will be working. In this case, you will only have 
cut the time needed to get your answer by 20%. 

Even if you manage to divide your problem into subproblems that require equal amounts 
of computation, you still can't depend on all the subproblems requiring equal amounts of time 
to solve. For example, some of the processors on your computer might be busy running other 
programs. Or perhaps some of the processors are simply slower than others. (This is not so 
likely when running your computation on a single computer, but when distributing computation 
across several networked computers, as we will do later in this chapter, differences in processor 
speed can be a major issue.) 

The common technique for dealing with all this is to divide the problem into a fairly large 
number of subproblems — many more subproblems than there are processors. This means that 
each processor will have to solve several subproblems. Each time a processor completes one 
subtask, it is assigned another subtask to work on, until all the subtasks have been assigned. Of 
course, there will still be variation in the time that the various subtasks require. One processor 
might complete several subproblems while another works on one particularly difficult case. And

a slow or busy processor might complete only one or two subproblems while another processor 
finishes five or six. Each processor can work at its own pace. As long as the subproblems are 
fairly small, most of the processors can be kept busy until near the end of the computation. 
This is known as load balancing: the computational load is balanced among the available 
processors in order to keep them all as busy as possible. Of course, some processors will still 
finish before others, but not by longer than the time it takes to complete the longest subtask. 

While the subproblems should be small, they should not be too small. There is some 
computational overhead involved in creating the subproblems and assigning them to processors. 
If the subproblems are very small, this overhead can add significantly to the total amount of 
work that has to be done. In my example program, the task is to compute a color for each 
pixel in an image. For dividing that task up into subtasks, one possibility would be to have 
each subtask compute just one pixel. But the subtasks produced in that way are probably too 
small. So, instead, each subtask in my program will compute the colors for one row of pixels. 
Since there are several hundred rows of pixels in the image, the number of subtasks will be 
fairly large, while each subtask will also be fairly large. The result is fairly good load balancing, 
with a reasonable amount of overhead. 

Note, by the way, that the problem that we are working on is a very easy one for parallel 
programming. When we divide the problem of calculating an image into subproblems, all 
the subproblems are completely independent. It is possible to work on any number of them 
simultaneously, and they can be done in any order. Things get a lot more complicated when 
some subtasks produce results that are required by other subtasks. In that case, the subtasks are 
not independent, and the order in which the subtasks are performed is important. Furthermore, 
there has to be some way for results from one subtask to be shared with other tasks. When the 
subtasks are executed by different threads, this raises all the issues involved in controlling access 
of threads to shared resources. So, in general, decomposing a problem for parallel processing is 
much more difficult than it might appear from our relatively simple example. 

12.3.2 Thread Pools and Task Queues 

Once we have decided how to decompose a task into subtasks, there is the question of how to 
assign those subtasks to threads. Typically, in an object-oriented approach, each subtask will 
be represented by an object. Since a task represents some computation, it's natural for the 
object that represents it to have an instance method that does the computation. To execute 
the task, it is only necessary to call its computation method. In my program, the computation 
method is called run() and the task object implements the standard Runnable interface that 
was discussed in Subsection 12.1.1. This interface is a natural way to represent computational 
tasks. It's possible to create a new thread for each Runnable. However, that doesn't really 
make sense when there are many tasks, since there is a significant amount of overhead involved 
in creating each new thread. A better alternative is to create just a few threads and let each 
thread execute a number of tasks. 

The optimal number of threads to use is not entirely clear, and it can depend on exactly 
what problem you are trying to solve. The goal is to keep all of the computer's processors busy. 
In the image-computing example, it works well to create one thread for each available processor, 
but that won't be true for all problems. In particular, if a thread can block for a non-trivial 
amount of time while waiting for some event or for access to some resource, you want to have 
extra threads around for the processor to run while other threads are blocked. We'll encounter 
exactly that situation when we turn to using threads with networking in Section 12.4. 

When several threads are available for performing tasks, those threads are called a thread 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



607 



pool. Thread pools are used to avoid creating a new thread to perform each task. Instead, 
when a task needs to be performed, it can be assigned to any idle thread in the "pool." 

Once all the threads in the thread pool are busy, any additional tasks will have to wait until 
one of the threads becomes idle. This is a natural application for a queue: Associated with 
the thread pool is a queue of waiting tasks. As tasks become available, they are added to the 
queue. Every time that a thread finishes a task, it goes to the queue to get another task to 
work on. 

Note that there is only one task queue for the thread pool. All the threads in the pool 
use the same queue, so the queue is a shared resource. As always with shared resources, race 
conditions are possible and synchronization is essential. Without synchronization, for example, 
it is possible that two threads trying to get items from the queue at the same time will end up 
retrieving the same item. (See if you can spot the race conditions in the dequeue () method in 
Subsection 9.3.2.) 

Java has a built-in class to solve this problem: ConcurrentLinkedQueue. This class and others 
that can be useful in parallel programming are defined in the package java.util . concurrent. 
It is a parameterized class so that to create, for example, a queue that can hold objects of type 
Runnable, you could say 

ConcurrentLinkedQueue<Runnable> queue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<Runnable> () ; 

This class represents a queue, implemented as a linked list, in which operations on the queue are 
properly synchronized. The operations on a ConcurrentLinkedQueue are not exactly the queue 
operations that we are used to. The method for adding a new item, x, to the end of queue is 
queue . add (x) . The method for removing an item from the front of queue is queue .poll () . 
The queue. poll() method returns null if the queue is empty; thus, poll() can be used to test 
whether the queue is empty and to retrieve an item if it is not. It makes sense to do things in 
this way because testing whether the queue is non-empty before taking an item from the queue 
involves a race condition: Without synchronization, it is possible for another thread to remove 
the last item from the queue between the time when you check that the queue is non-empty 
and the time when you try to take the item from the queue. By the time you try to get the 
item, there's nothing there! 

* * * 

To use ConcurrentLinkedQueue in our image-computing example, we can use the queue along 
with a thread pool. To begin the computation of the image, we create all the tasks that make 
up the image and add them to the queue. Then, we can create and start the worker threads that 
will execute the tasks. Each thread will run in a loop in which it gets one task from the queue, 
by calling the queue's poll() method, and carries out that task. Since the task is an object of 
type Runnable, it is only necessary for the thread to call the task's run() method. When the 
poll() method returns null, the queue is empty and the thread can terminate because all the 
tasks have been assigned to threads. 

The sample program MultiprocessingDemo2.java implements this idea. It uses a queue 
taskQueue of type ConcurrentLinkedQueue<Runnable> to hold the tasks. In addition, in order 
to allow the user to abort the computation before it finishes, it uses the volatile boolean 
variable running to signal the thread when the user aborts the computation. The thread 
should terminate when this variable is set to false. The threads are defined by a nested class 
named WorkerThread. It is quite short and simple to write at this point: 

private class WorkerThread extends Thread { 
public void run() { 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 608 



try { 

while (running) { 

Runnable task = taskQueue. poll () ; // Get a task from the queue, 
if (task == null) 

break; // (because the queue is empty) 
task.runO; // Execute the task; 

} 

} 

finally { 

threadFinishedO ; // Records fact that this thread has terminated. 

} 

> 

} 

The program uses a nested class named MandelbrotTask to represent the task of computing 
one row of pixels in the image. This class implements the Runnable interface. Its run() method 
does the actual work: Compute the color of each pixel, and apply the colors to the image. Here 
is what the program does to start the computation (with a few details omitted): 

taskQueue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<Runnable> () ; // Create the queue, 
int height = ... ; // Number of rows in the image, 
for (int row = 0; row < height; row++) { 
MandelbrotTask task; 

task = . . . ; // Create a task to compute one row of the image. 
taskQueue . add (task) ; // Add the task to the queue. 

} 

int threadCount = ... ; // Number of threads in the pool 
workers = new WorkerThread [threadCount] ; 

running = true; // Set the signal before starting the threads! 
threadsCompleted =0; // Records how many of the threads have terminated, 
for (int i = 0; i < threadCount; i++) { 

workers [i] = new WorkerThread () ; 

try { 

workers [i] . setPriority( Thread. currentThreadO . getPriority () - 1 ); 

> 

catch (Exception e) { 
} 

workers [i] . start () ; 

} 

Note that it is important that the tasks be added to the queue before the threads are started. 
The threads see an empty queue as a signal to terminate. If the queue is empty when the 
threads are created, they might see an empty queue and terminate immediately after being 
started, without performing any tasks! 

You should run MultiprocessingDemo2 or try the applet version in the on-line version of 
this section. It computes the same image as MultiprocessingDemol, but the rows of pixels 
are not computed in the same order as in that program (assuming that there is more than one 
thread) . If you look carefully, you might see that the rows of pixels are not added to the image 
in strict order from top to bottom. This is because it is possible for one thread to finish row 
number i+1 while another thread is still working on row i, or even earlier rows. (The effect 
might be more apparent if you use more threads than you have processors.) 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



609 



12.3.3 Producer/Consumer and Blocking Queues 

MultiprocessingDemo2 creates an entirely new thread pool every time it draws an image. This 
seems wasteful. Shouldn't it be possible to create one set of threads at the beginning of the 
program and use them whenever an image needs to be computed? After all, the idea of a thread 
pool is that the threads should sit around and wait for tasks to come along and should execute 
them when they do. The problem is that, so far, we have no way to make a thread wait for a 
task to come along. To do that, we will use something called a blocking queue. 

A blocking queue is an implementation of one of the classic patterns in parallel processing: 
the producer/ consumer pattern. This pattern arises when there are one or more "producers" 
who produce things and one or more "consumers" who consume those things. All the producers 
and consumers should be able to work simultaneously (hence, parallel processing). If there are 
no things ready to be processed, a consumer will have to wait until one is produced. In many 
applications, producers also have to wait sometimes: If things can only be consumed at a rate 
of, say, one per minute, it doesn't make sense for the producers to produce them indefinitely 
at a rate of two per minute. That would just lead to an unlimited build-up of things waiting 
to be processed. Therefore, it's often useful to put a limit on the number of things that can 
be waiting for processing. When that limit is reached, producers should wait before producing 
more things. 

We need a way to get the things from the producers to the consumers. A queue is an 
obvious answer: Producers can place items into the queue as they are produced. Consumers 
can remove items from the other end of the queue. 



Consumer 




We are talking parallel processing, so we need a synchronized queue, but we need more than 
that. When the queue is empty, we need a way to have consumers wait until an item appears in 
the queue. If the queue becomes full, we need a way to have producers wait until a space opens 
up in the queue. In our application, the producers and consumers are threads. A thread that 
is suspended, waiting for something to happen, is said to be blocked, and the type of queue 
that we need is called a blocking queue. In a blocking queue, the operation of dequeueing an 
item from the queue can block if the queue is empty. That is, if a thread tries to dequeue an 
item from an empty queue, the thread will be suspended until an item becomes available; at 
that time, it will wake up, retrieve the item, and proceed. Similarly, if the queue has a limited 
capacity, a producer that tries to enqueue an item can block if there is no space in the queue. 

Java has two classes that implement blocking queues: LinkedBlockingQueue and ArrayBlock- 
ingQueue. These are parameterized types to allow you to specify the type of item that the queue 
can hold. Both classes are defined in the package java.util . concurrent and both implement 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



610 



an interface called BlockingQueue. If bqueue is a blocking queue belonging to one of these 
classes, then the following operations are defined: 

• bqueue . take () - Removes an item from the queue and returns it. If the queue is empty 
when this method is called, the thread that called it will block until an item becomes 
available. This method throws an Interrupted Exception if the thread is interrupted while 
it is blocked. 

• bqueue. put (item) - Adds the item to the queue. If the queue has a limited capacity 
and is full, the thread that called it will block until a space opens up in the queue. This 
method throws an InterruptedException if the thread is interrupted while it is blocked. 

• bqueue . add (item) - Adds the item to the queue, if space is available. If the queue has 
a limited capacity and is full, an HlegalStateException is thrown. This method does not 
block. 

• bqueue . clear () - Removes all items from the queue and discards them. 

Java's blocking queues define many additional methods (for example, bqueue. poll (500) is 
similar to bqueue . take () , except that it will not block for longer than 500 milliseconds), but 
the four listed here are sufficient for our purposes. Note that I have listed two methods for 
adding items to the queue: bqueue . put (item) blocks if there is not space available in the queue 
and is meant for use with blocking queues that have a limited capacity; bqueue . add (item) does 
not block and is meant for use with blocking queues that have an unlimited capacity. 

An ArrayBlockingQueue has a maximum capacity that is specified when it is constructed. 
For example, to create a blocking queue that can hold up to 25 objects of type ItemType, you 
could say: 

ArrayBlockingQueue<ItemType> bqueue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<ItemType> (25) ; 

With this declaration, bqueue. put (item) will block if bqueue already contains 25 items, while 
bqueue . add (item) will throw an exception in that case. Recall that this ensures that tasks are 
not produced indefinitely at a rate faster than they can be consumed. A LinkedBlockingQueue 
is meant for creating blocking queues with unlimited capacity. For example, 

LinkedBlockingQueue<ItemType> bqueue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<ItemType>() ; 

creates a queue with no upper limit on the number of items that it can contain. In 
this case, bqueue .put (item) will never block and bqueue . add (item) will never throw an 
HlegalStateException. You would use a LinkedBlockingQueue when you want to avoid block- 
ing, and you have some other way of ensuring that the queue will not grow to arbitrary size. 
For both types of blocking queue, bqueue .take () will block if the queue is empty. 

* * * 

The sample program MultiprocessingDemo3.java uses a LinkedBlockingQueue in place of the 
ConcurrentLinkedQueue in the previous version, MultiprocessingDemo2.java. In this example, 
the queue holds tasks, that is, items of type Runnable, and the queue is declared as an instance 
variable named taskQueue: 

LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable> taskQueue ; 

When the user clicks the "Start" button and it's time to compute an image, all of the tasks that 
make up the computation are put into this queue. This is done by calling taskQueue . add (task) 
for each task. It's important that this can be done without blocking, since the tasks are 
created in the event-handling thread, and we don't want to block that. The queue cannot grow

indefinitely because the program only works on one image at a time, and there are only a few 
hundred tasks per image. 

Just as in the previous version of the program, worker threads belonging to a thread pool 
will remove tasks from the queue and carry them out. However, in this case, the threads are 
created once at the beginning of the program — actually, the first time the "Start" button is 
pressed — and the same threads are reused for any number of images. When there are no tasks to 
execute, the task queue is empty and the worker threads will block until tasks become available. 
Each worker thread runs in an infinite loop, processing tasks forever, but it will spend a lot 
of its time blocked, waiting for a task to be added to the queue. Here is the inner class that 
defines the worker threads: 

/** 

* This class defines the worker threads that make up the thread pool. 

* A WorkerThread runs in a loop in which it retrieves a task from the 

* taskQueue and calls the run() method in that task. Note that if 

* the queue is empty, the thread blocks until a task becomes available 

* in the queue. The constructor starts the thread, so there is no 

* need for the main program to do so. The thread will run at a priority 

* that is one less than the priority of the thread that calls the 

* constructor. 
* 

* A WorkerThread is designed to run in an infinite loop. It will 

* end only when the Java virtual machine exits. (This assumes that 

* the tasks that are executed don't throw exceptions, which is true 

* in this program.) The constructor sets the thread to run as 

* a daemon thread; the Java virtual machine will exit when the 

* only threads are daemon threads. (In this program, this is not 

* necessary since the virtual machine is set to exit when the 

* window is closed. In a multi-window program, however, we can't 

* simply end the program when a window is closed.)

CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING

}

} 

We should look more closely at how the thread pool works. The worker threads are created and 
started before there is any task to perform. Each thread immediately calls taskQueue .take() . 
Since the task queue is empty, all the worker threads will block as soon as they are started. To 
start the computation of an image, the event-handling thread will create tasks and add them 
to the queue. As soon as this happens, worker threads will wake up and start processing tasks, 
and they will continue doing so until the queue is emptied. (Note that on a multi-processor 
computer, some worker threads can start processing even while the event thread is still adding 
tasks to the queue.) When the queue is empty, the worker threads will go back to sleep until 
processing starts on the next image. 

* * * 

An interesting point in this program is that we want to be able to abort the computation 
before it finishes, but we don't want the worker threads to terminate when that happens. When 
the user clicks the "Abort" button, the program calls taskQueue . clear () , which prevents any 
more tasks from being assigned to worker threads. However, some tasks are most likely already 
being executed when the task queue is cleared. Those tasks will complete after the computation 
in which they are subtasks has supposedly been aborted. When those subtasks complete, we 
don't want their output to be applied to the image. It's not a big deal in this program, but in 
more general applications, we don't want output meant for a previous computation job to be 
applied to later jobs. 

My solution is to assign a job number to each computation job. The job number of the 
current job is stored in an instance variable named jobNum, and each task object has an instance 
variable that tells which task that job is part of. When a job ends — either because the job 
finishes on its own or because the user aborts it — the value of j obNum is incremented. When a 
task completes, the job number stored in the task object is compared to jobNum. If they are 
equal, then the task is part of the current job, and its output is applied to the image. If they 
are not equal, then the task was part of a previous job, and its output is discarded. 

It's important that access to jobNum be properly synchronized. Otherwise, one thread might 
check the job number just as another thread is incrementing it, and output meant for an old 
job might sneak through after that job has been aborted. In the program, all the methods that 
access or change jobNum are synchronized. You can read the source code to see how it works. 

* * * 

One more point about MultiprocessingDemo3. ... I have not provided any way to terminate 
the worker threads in this program. They will continue to run until the Java Virtual Machine 
exits. To allow thread termination before that, we could use a volatile signaling variable, 
running, and set its value to false when we want the worker threads to terminate. The run() 
methods for the threads would be replaced by 

public void runO { 

while ( running ) { 
try { 

Runnable task = taskQueue . take () ; 
task. run () ; 

} 

catch (InterruptedException e) { 
} 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



613 



> 

} 

However, if a thread is blocked in taskQueue .take() , it will not see the new value of 
running until it becomes unblocked. To ensure that that happens, it is necessary to call 
worker . interrupt () for each worker thread worker, just after setting runner to false. 

If a worker thread is executing a task when runner is set to false, the thread will not 
terminate until that task has completed. If the tasks are reasonably short, this is not a problem. 
If tasks can take longer to execute than you are willing to wait for the threads to terminate, 
then each task must also check the value of running periodically and exit when that value 
becomes false. 

12.3.4 Wait and Notify 

To implement a blocking queue, we must be able to make a thread block just until some event 
occurs. The thread is waiting for the event to occur. Somehow, it must be notified when that 
happens. There are two threads involved since the event that will wake one thread is caused 
by an action taken by another thread, such as adding an item to the queue. 

Note that this is not just an issue for blocking queues. Whenever one thread produces some 
sort of result that is needed by another thread, that imposes some restriction on the order in 
which the threads can do their computations. If the second thread gets to the point where 
it needs the result from the first thread, it might have to stop and wait for the result to be 
produced. Since the second thread can't continue, it might as well go to sleep. But then there 
has to be some way to notify the second thread when the result is ready, so that it can wake 
up and continue its computation. 

Java, of course, has a way to do this kind of "waiting" and "notifying": It has wait() 
and notifyO methods that are defined as instance methods in class Object and so can be 
used with any object. These methods are used internally in blocking queues. They are fairly 
low-level, tricky, and error-prone, and you should use higher-level control strategies such as 
blocking queues when possible. However, it's nice to know about wait() and notify () in case 
you ever need to use them directly. 

The reason why wait() and notify () should be associated with objects is not obvious, 
so don't worry about it at this point. It does, at least, make it possible to direct different 
notifications to different recipients, depending on which object's notifyO method is called. 

The general idea is that when a thread calls a wait() method in some object, that thread 
goes to sleep until the notifyO method in the same object is called. It will have to be called, 
obviously, by another thread, since the thread that called wait() is sleeping. A typical pattern 
is that Thread A calls wait() when it needs a result from Thread B, but that result is not yet 
available. When Thread B has the result ready, it calls notifyO, which will wake Thread A 
up, if it is waiting, so that it can use the result. It is not an error to call notifyO when no 
one is waiting; it just has no effect. To implement this, Thread A will execute code similar to 
the following, where obj is some object: 

if ( resultlsAvailable () == false ) 

obj.waitO; // wait for notification that the result is available 
useTheResult () ; 

while Thread B does something like: 
generateTheResult () ; 

obj .notifyO ; // send out a notification that the result is available 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



614 



Now, there is a really nasty race condition in this code. The two threads might execute 
their code in the following order: 

1. Thread A checks resultlsAvailable () and finds that the result is not ready, 

so it decides to execute the obj.waitO statement, but before it does, 

2. Thread B finishes generating the result and calls obj.notifyO 

3. Thread A calls obj.waitO to wait for notification that the result is ready. 

In Step 3, Thread A is waiting for a notification that will never come, because notifyO has 
already been called in Step 2. This is a kind of deadlock that can leave Thread A waiting forever. 
Obviously, we need some kind of synchronization. The solution is to enclose both Thread A's 
code and Thread B's code in synchronized statements, and it is very natural to synchronize 
on the same object, obj, that is used for the calls to wait() and notifyO. In fact, since 
synchronization is almost always needed when wait() and notifyO are used, Java makes it 
an absolute requirement. In Java, a thread can legally call obj .wait() or obj .notifyO only 
if that thread holds the synchronization lock associated with the object obj. If it does not hold 
that lock, then an exception is thrown. (The exception is of type HlegalMonitorStateException, 
which does not require mandatory handling and which is typically not caught.) One further 
complication is that the wait() method can throw an InterruptedException and so should be 
called in a try statement that handles the exception. 

To make things more definite, let's consider how we can get a result that is computed by 
one thread to another thread that needs the result. This is a simplified producer /consumer 
problem in which only one item is produced and consumed. Assume that there is a shared 
variable named sharedResult that is used to transfer the result from the producer to the 
consumer. When the result is ready, the producer sets the variable to a non-null value. The 
consumer can check whether the result is ready by testing whether the value of sharedResult 
is null. We will use a variable named lock for synchronization. The code for the producer 
thread could have the form: 

makeResult = generateTheResult () ; // Not synchronized! 
synchronized(lock) { 

sharedResult = makeResult; 

lock. notifyO ; 

} 

while the consumer would execute code such as: 

synchronized(lock) { 

while ( sharedResult == null ) { 
try { 

lock. wait () ; 

} 

catch (InterruptedException e) { 
} 

} 

useResult = sharedResult; 

} 

useTheResult (useResult) ; // Not synchronized! 

The calls to generateTheResult () and useTheResult () are not synchronized, which al- 
lows them to run in parallel with other threads that might also synchronize on lock. Since 
sharedResult is a shared variable, all references to sharedResult should be synchronized, so 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



615 



the references to sharedResult must be inside the synchronized statements. The goal is to 
do as little as possible (but not less) in synchronized code segments. 

If you are uncommonly alert, you might notice something funny: lock. wait () does 
not finish until lock.notifyO is executed, but since both of these methods are called in 
synchronized statements that synchronize on the same object, shouldn't it be impossible for 
both methods to be running at the same time? In fact, lock. wait () is a special case: When a 
thread calls lock, wait () , it gives up the lock that it holds on the synchronization object, lock. 
This gives another thread a chance to execute the synchronized (lock) block that contains the 
lock.notifyO statement. After the second thread exits from this block, the lock is returned 
to the consumer thread so that it can continue. 

In the full producer/consumer pattern, multiple results are produced by one or more pro- 
ducer threads and are consumed by one or more consumer threads. Instead of having just one 
sharedResult object, we keep a list of objects that have been produced but not yet consumed. 
Let's see how this might work in a very simple class that implements the three operations on a 
LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable> that are used in MultiprocessingDemo3: 

import java.util.LinkedList; 

public class MyLinkedBlockingQueue { 

private LinkedList<Runnable> taskList = new LinkedList<Runnable>() ; 

public void clear () { 

synchronized(taskList) { 
taskList . clear () ; 

} 

> 

public void add(Runnable task) { 
synchronized(taskList) { 

taskList . addLast (task) ; 
taskList .notify () ; 

> 

> 

public Runnable takeO throws InterruptedException { 
synchronized(taskList) { 

while (taskList . isEmptyO ) 

taskList .waitO ; 
return taskList . removeFirst () ; 

> 

} 

} 

An object of this class could be used as a direct replacement for the taskQueue in 
MultiprocessingDemo3. 

In this class, I have chosen to synchronize on the taskList object, but any object could be 
used. In fact, I could simply use synchronized methods, which is equivalent to synchronizing 
on this. (Note that you might see a call to wait() or notify () in a synchronized instance 
method, with no reference to the object that is being used. Remember that wait() and 
notifyO in that context really mean this.waitO and this .notifyO .) 

By the way, it is essential that the call to taskList . clear () be synchronized on the same 
object, even though it doesn't call wait() or notifyO. Otherwise, there is a race condition 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



616 



that can occur: The list might be cleared just after the take() method checks that taskList 
is non-empty and before it removes an item from the list. In that case, the list is empty again 
by the time taskList . removeFirst () is called, resulting in an error. 

* * * 

It is possible for several threads to be waiting for notification. A call to obj . notify () will 
wake only one of the threads that is waiting on obj . If you want to wake all threads that are 
waiting on obj, you can call obj .not if yAllO . obj . notify () works OK in the above example 
because only consumer threads can be blocked. We only need to wake one consumer thread 
when a task is added to the queue because it doesn't matter which consumer gets the task. 
But consider a blocking queue with limited capacity, where producers and consumers can both 
block. When an item is added to the queue, we want to make sure that a consumer thread is 
notified, not just another producer. One solution is to call notifyAllO instead of notify (), 
which will notify all threads including any waiting consumer. 

I should also mention a possible confusion about the method obj . notify (). This method 
does not notify obj of anything. It notifies a thread that has called obj .wait() (if there is 
such a thread). Similarly, in obj .wait(), it's not obj that is waiting for something; it's the 
thread that calls the method. 

And a final note on wait : There is another version of wait ( ) that takes a number of 
milliseconds as a parameter. A thread that calls obj .wait (milliseconds) will wait only up 
to the specified number of milliseconds for a notification. If a notification doesn't occur during 
that period, the thread will wake up and continue without the notification. In practice, this 
feature is most often used to let a waiting thread wake periodically while it is waiting in order 
to perform some periodic task, such as causing a message "Waiting for computation to finish" 
to blink. 

* * * 

Let's look at an example that uses wait() and notify () to allow one thread to control 
another. The sample program TowersOfHanoiWithControls.java solves the Towers Of Hanoi 
puzzle (Subsection 9.1.2), with control buttons that allow the user to control the execution of 
the algorithm. Clicking "Next Step" executes one step, which moves a single disk from one pile 
to another. Clicking "Run" lets the algorithm run automatically on its own; "Run" changes 
to "Pause" , and clicking "Pause" stops the automatic execution. There is also a "Start Over" 
button that aborts the current solution and puts the puzzle back into its initial configuration. 
Here is a picture of the program in the middle of a solution: 









Run 


Next Step Start Over 



In this program, there are two threads: a thread that runs a recursive algorithm to solve the 
puzzle, and the event-handling thread that reacts to user actions. When the user clicks one of 
the buttons, a method is called in the event-handling thread. But it's actually the thread that 
is running the recursion that has to respond by, for example, doing one step of the solution or 
starting over. The event-handling thread has to send some sort of signal to the solution thread. 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



617 



This is done by setting the value of a variable that is shared by both threads. The variable is 
named status, and its possible values are the constants GO, PAUSE, STEP, and RESTART. 

When the event-handling thread changes the value of this variable, the solution thread 
should see the new value and respond. When status equals PAUSE, the solution thread is 
paused, waiting for the user to click "Run" or "Next Step". This is the initial state, when 
the program starts. If the user clicks "Next Step", the event-handling thread sets the value of 
status to "STEP"; the solution thread should respond by executing one step of the solution 
and then resetting status to PAUSE. If the user clicks "Run", status is set to GO, which should 
cause the solution thread to run automatically. When the user clicks "Pause" while the solution 
is running, status is reset to PAUSE, and the solution thread should return to its paused state. If 
the user clicks "Start Over" , the event-handling thread sets status to RESTART, and the solution 
thread should respond by ending the current recursive solution and restoring the puzzle to its 
initial state. 

The main point for us is that when the solution thread is paused, it is sleeping. It won't see 
a new value for status unless it wakes up! To make that possible, the program uses wait() 
in the solution thread to put that thread to sleep, and it uses notify () in the event-handling 
thread to wake up the solution thread whenever it changes the value of status. Here is the 
actionPerf ormed() method that responds to clicks on the buttons. When the user clicks a 
button, this method changes the value of status and calls notifyO to wake up the solution 
thread: 

synchronized public void actionPerf ormed(ActionEvent evt) ■{ 
Object source = evt .getSourceO ; 

if (source == runPauseButton) { // Toggle between running and paused, 
if (status == GO) { // Animation is running. Pause it. 
status = PAUSE; 

nextStepButton. setEnabled(true) ; // Enable while paused. 
runPauseButton . setText ( "Run" ) ; 

} 

else { // Animation is paused. Start it running, 
status = GO; 

nextStepButton. setEnabled(f alse) ; // Disable while running. 
runPauseButton . setText ( "Pause " ) ; 

> 

> 

else if (source == nextStepButton) { // Makes animation run one step, 
status = STEP; 

} 

else if (source == startOverButton) { II Restore to initial state, 
status = RESTART; 

} 

notifyO ; // Wake up the thread so it can see the new status value! 

} 

This method is synchronized to allow the call to notifyO. Remember that the notifyO 
method in an object can only be called by a thread that holds that object's synchronization 
lock. In this case, the synchronization object is this. Synchronization is also necessary because 
of race conditions that arise because the value of status can also be changed by the solution 
thread. 

The solution thread calls a method named checkStatus () to check the value of status. 
This method calls wait() if the status is PAUSE, which puts the solution thread to sleep until 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



618 



the event-handling thread calls notifyQ. Note that if the status is RESTART, checkStatus () 
throws an HlegalStateException: 

synchronized private void checkStatus () { 
while (status == PAUSE) { 
try { 

wait () ; 

} 

catch (InterruptedException e) { 
> 

} 

// At this point, status is RUN, STEP, or RESTART, 
if (status == RESTART) 

throw new IllegalStateExceptionC'Restart") ; 
// At this point, status is RUN or STEP. 

} 

The run() method for the solution thread runs in an infinite loop in which it sets up the 
initial state of the puzzle and then calls a solve () method to solve the puzzle. To implement 
the wait/notify control strategy, run() calls checkStatus () before starting the solution, and 
solve () calls checkStatus () after each move. If checkStatus () throws an HlegalStateExcep- 
tion, the call to solve () is terminated early, and the run() method returns to the beginning 
of the while loop, where the initial state of the puzzle, and of the user interface, is restored: 

public void run() { 
while (true) { 

runPauseButton.setTextC'Run") ; // Set user interface to initial state. 
nextStepButton. setEnabled(true) ; 
startOverButton. setEnabled(f alse) ; 

setUpProblemO ; // Set up the initial state of the puzzle 
status = PAUSE; // Initially, the solution thread is paused. 
checkStatus () ; // Returns only when user has clicked "Run" or "Next Step" 
startOverButton. setEnabled(true) ; 
try { 

solve(10, 0,1,2) ; // Move 10 disks from pile to pile 1. 

} 

catch (HlegalStateException e) { 

// Exception was thrown because use clicked "Start Over". 

} 

} 

} 

You can check the source code to see how this all fits into the complete program. If you 
want to learn how to use wait() and notify () directly, understanding this example is a good 
place to start! 



12.4 Threads and Networking 

In THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER, we looked at several examples of network programming. Those (online) 
examples showed how to create network connections and communicate through them, but they 
didn't deal with one of the fundamental characteristics of network programming, the fact that 
network communication is asynchronous. From the point of view of a program on one end of a 
network connection, messages can arrive from the other side of the connection at any time; the 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



619 



arrival of a message is an event that is not under the control of the program that is receiving the 
message. Perhaps an event-oriented networking API would be a good approach to dealing with 
the asynchronous nature of network communication, but that is not the approach that is taken 
in Java (or, typically, in other languages). Instead, network programming in Java typically uses 
threads. 

12.4.1 The Blocking I/O Problem 

A covered in Section 11.4, network programming uses sockets. A socket, in the sense that 
we are using the term here, represents one end of a network connection. Every socket has an 
associated input stream and output stream. Data written to the output stream on one end of 
the connection is transmitted over the network and appears in the input stream at the other 
end. 

A program that wants to read data from a socket's input stream calls one of that input 
stream's input methods. It is possible that the data has already arrived before the input 
method is called; in that case, the input method retrieves the data and returns immediately. 
More likely, however, the input method will have to wait for data to arrive from the other side 
of the connection. Until the data arrives, the input method and the thread that called it will 
be blocked. 

It is also possible for an output method in a socket's output stream to block. This can happen 
if the program tries to output data to the socket faster than the data can be transmitted over 
the network. (It's a little complicated: a socket uses a "buffer" to hold data that is supposed to 
be transmitted over the network. A buffer is just a block of memory that is used like a queue. 
The output method drops its data into the buffer; lower-level software removes data from the 
buffer and transmits it over the network. The output method will block if the buffer fills up. 
Note that when the output method returns, it doesn't mean that the data has gone out over 
the network — it just means that the data has gone into the buffer and is scheduled for later 
transmission.) 

We say that network communication uses blocking I/O, because input and output oper- 
ations on the network can block for indefinite periods of time. Programs that use the network 
must be prepared to deal with this blocking. In some cases, it's acceptable for a program to 
simply shut down all other processing and wait for input. (This is what happens when a com- 
mand line program reads input typed by the user. User input is another type of blocking I/O.) 
However, threads make it possible for some parts of a program to continue doing useful work 
while other parts are blocked. A network client program that sends requests to a server might 
get by with a single thread, if it has nothing else to do while waiting for the server's responses. 
A network server program, on the other hand, can typically be connected to several clients at 
the same time. While waiting for data to arrive from a client, the server certainly has other 
things that it can do, namely communicate with other clients. When a server uses different 
threads to handle the communication with different clients, the fact that I/O with one client is 
blocked won't stop the server from communicating with other clients. 

It's important to understand that using threads to deal with blocking I/O differs in a 
fundamental way from using threads to speed up computation. When using threads for speed- 
up in Subsection 12.3.2, it made sense to use one thread for each available processor. If only 
one processor is available, using more than one thread will yield no speed-up at all; in fact, it 
would slow things down because of the extra overhead involved in creating and managing the 
threads. 

In the case of blocking I/O, on the other hand, it can make sense to have many more threads 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



620 



than there are processors, since at any given time many of the threads can be blocked. Only the 
active, unblocked threads are competing for processing time. In the ideal case, to keep all the 
processors busy, you would want to have one active thread per processor (actually somewhat 
less than that, on average, to allow for variations over time in the number of active threads). 
On a network server program, for example, threads generally spend most of their time blocked 
waiting for I/O operations to complete. If threads are blocked, say, about 90% of the time, 
you'd like to have about ten times as many threads as there are processors. So even on a 
computer that has just a single processor, server programs can make good use of large numbers 
of threads. 

12.4.2 An Asynchronous Network Chat Program 

As a first example of using threads for network communication, we consider a GUI chat program. 

The command-line chat programs, CLChatClient.java and CLChatServer.java, from the 
Subsection 11.4.5 use a straight-through, step-by-step protocol for communication. After a 
user on one side of a connection enters a message, the user must wait for a reply from the 
other side of the connection. An asynchronous chat program would be much nicer. In such 
a program, a user could just keep typing lines and sending messages without waiting for any 
response. Messages that arrive — asynchronously — from the other side would be displayed as 
soon as they arrive. It's not easy to do this in a command-line interface, but it's a natural 
application for a graphical user interface. The basic idea for a GUI chat program is to create a 
thread whose job is to read messages that arrive from the other side of the connection. As soon 
as the message arrives, it is displayed to the user; then, the message-reading thread blocks until 
the next incoming message arrives. While it is blocked, however, other threads can continue to 
run. In particular, the event-handling thread that responds to user actions keeps running; that 
thread can send outgoing messages as soon as the user generates them. 

The sample program GUIChat.java is an example of this. GUIChat is a two-way network 
chat program that allows two users to send messages to each other over the network. In this 
chat program, each user can send messages at any time, and incoming messages are displayed 
as soon as they are received. 

The GUIChat program can act as either the client end or the server end of a connection. 
(Refer back to Subsection 11.4.3 for information about how clients and servers work.) The 
program has a "Listen" button that the user can click to create a server socket that will listen 
for an incoming connection request; this makes the program act as a server. It also has a 
"Connect" button that the user can click to send a connection request; this makes the program 
act as a client. As usual, the server listens on a specified port number. The client needs to 
know the computer on which the server is running and the port on which the server is listening. 
There are input boxes in the GUIChat window where the user can enter this information. 

Once a connection has been established between two GUIChat windows, each user can send 
messages to the other. The window has an input box where the user types a message. Pressing 
return while typing in this box sends the message. This means that the sending of the message 
is handled by the usual event-handling thread, in response to an event generated by a user 
action. Messages are received by a separate thread that just sits around waiting for incoming 
messages. This thread blocks while waiting for a message to arrive; when a message does 
arrive, it displays that message to the user. The window contains a large transcript area that 
displays both incoming and outgoing messages, along with other information about the network 
connection. 

I urge you to compile the source code, GUIChat.java, and try the program. To make it easy 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



621 



to try it on a single computer, you can make a connection between one window and another 
window on the same computer, using "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" as the name of the computer. 
(Once you have one GUIChat window open, you can open a second one by clicking the "New" 
button.) I also urge you to read the source code. I will discuss only parts of it here. 

The program uses a nested class, Connection/Handler, to handle most network-related tasks. 
ConnectionHandler is a subclass of Thread. The ConnectionHandler thread is responsible for 
opening the network connection and then for reading incoming messages once the connection 
has been opened. By putting the connection-opening code in a separate thread, we make sure 
that the GUI is not blocked while the connection is being opened. Like reading incoming 
messages, opening a connection is a blocking operation that can take some time to complete. 
A ConnectionHandler is created when the user clicks the "Listen" or "Connect" button. The 
"Listen" button should make the thread act as a server, while "Connect" should make it act 
as a client. To distinguish these two cases, the ConnectionHandler class has two constructors: 

/** 

* Listen for a connection on a specified port. The constructor 

* does not perform any network operations; it just sets some 

* instance variables and starts the thread. Note that the 

* thread will only listen for one connection, and then will 

* close its server socket. 
*/ 

ConnectionHandler (int port) { 

state = ConnectionState. LISTENING; 
this. port = port; 

postMessage ( " \nLISTENING ON PORT " + port + "\n"); 
start () ; 

} 

/** 

* Open a connection to a specified computer and port. The constructor 

* does not perform any network operations; it just sets some 

* instance variables and starts the thread. 
*/ 

ConnectionHandler (String remoteHost, int port) { 
state = ConnectionState. CONNECTING; 
this . remoteHost = remoteHost; 
this. port = port; 

postMessage ("\nC0NNECTING TO " + remoteHost + " ON PORT " + port + "\n"); 
start () ; 

} 

Here, state is an instance variable whose type is defined by an enumerated type 
enum ConnectionState { LISTENING, CONNECTING, CONNECTED, CLOSED }; 

The values of this enum represent different possible states of the network connection. It is often 
useful to treat a network connection as a state machine (see Subsection 6.5.4), since the response 
to various events can depend on the state of the connection when the event occurs. Setting the 
state variable to LISTENING or CONNECTING tells the thread whether it should act as a server 
or as a client. Note that the postMessage () method posts a message to the transcript area of 
the window, where it will be visible to the user. 

Once the thread has been started, it executes the following run() method: 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



622 



/** 

* The run() method that is executed by the thread. It opens a 

* connection as a client or as a server (depending on which 

* constructor was used) . 
*/ 

public void run() { 
try { 

if (state == ConnectionState. LISTENING) { 
// Open a connection as a server, 
listener = new ServerSocket (port) ; 
socket = listener . accept () ; 
listener . close () ; 

} 

else if (state == ConnectionState . CONNECTING) { 
// Open a connection as a client, 
socket = new Socket (remoteHost , port) ; 

} 

connectionOpenedO ; // Sets up to use the connection (including 

// creating a Buf f eredReader , in, for reading 
// incoming messages), 
while (state == ConnectionState . CONNECTED) { 

// Read one line of text from the other side of 
// the connection, and report it to the user. 
String input = in.readLineO ; 
if (input == null) 

connectionClosedFromOtherSide () ; 
else 

received(input) ; // Report message to user. 

} 

} 

catch (Exception e) { 

// An error occurred. Report it to the user, but not 
// if the connection has been closed (since the error 
// might be the expected error that is generated when 
// a socket is closed), 
if (state != ConnectionState . CLOSED) 
postMessage("\n\n ERROR: " + e) ; 

> 

finally { // Clean up before terminating the thread. 
cleanUp () ; 

} 

} 

This method calls several other methods to do some of its work, but you can see the general 
outline of how it works. After opening the connection as either a server or client, the run() 
method enters a while loop in which it receives and processes messages from the other side of 
the connection until the connection is closed. It is important to understand how the connection 
can be closed. The GUIChat window has a "Disconnect" button that the user can click to close 
the connection. The program responds to this event by closing the socket that represents the 
connection. It is likely that when this happens, the connection-handling thread is blocked in the 
in . readLine () method, waiting for an incoming message. When the socket is closed by another 
thread, this method will fail and will throw an exception; this exception causes the thread to 
terminate. (If the connection-handling thread happens to be between calls to in.readLineO 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



623 



when the socket is closed, the while loop will terminate because the connection state changes 
from CONNECTED to CLOSED.) Note that closing the window will also close the connection in the 
same way. 

It is also possible for the user on the other side of the connection to close the connection. 
When that happens, the stream of incoming messages ends, and the in.readLineO on this 
side of the connection returns the value null, which indicates end-of-stream and acts as a signal 
that the connection has been closed by the remote user. 

For a final look into the GUIChat code, consider the methods that send and receive messages. 
These methods are called from different threads. The send() method is called by the event- 
handling thread in response to a user action. Its purpose is to transmit a message to the 
remote user. (It is conceivable, though not likely, that the data output operation could block, 
if the socket's output buffer fills up. A more sophisticated program might take this possibility 
into account.) This method uses a PrintWriter, out, that writes to the socket's output stream. 
Synchronization of this method prevents the connection state from changing in the middle of 
the send operation: 

/** 

* Send a message to the other side of the connection, and post the 

* message to the transcript . This should only be called when the 

* connection state is ConnectionState . CONNECTED ; if it is called at 

* other times, it is ignored. 
*/ 

synchronized void send (String message) { 

if (state == ConnectionState. CONNECTED) { 
postMessageC'SEND: " + message); 
out .println (message) ; 
out . f lushO ; 
if (out . checkError () ) { 

postMessage("\nERROR OCCURRED WHILE TRYING TO SEND DATA."); 
closeQ; // Closes the connection. 

} 

> 

} 

The receivedQ method is called by the connection-handling thread after a message has been 
read from the remote user. Its only job is to display the message to the user, but again it is 
synchronized to avoid the race condition that could occur if the connection state were changed 
by another thread while this method is being executed: 

/** 

* This is called by the run() method when a message is received from 

* the other side of the connection. The message is posted to the 

* transcript, but only if the connection state is CONNECTED. (This 

* is because a message might be received after the user has clicked 

* the "Disconnect" button; that message should not be seen by the 

* user.) 
*/ 

synchronized private void received(String message) { 
if (state == ConnectionState. CONNECTED) 
postMessage( "RECEIVE: " + message) ; 

} 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



624 



12.4.3 A Threaded Network Server 

Threads are often used in network server programs. They allow the server to deal with several 
clients at the same time. When a client can stay connected for an extended period of time, other 
clients shouldn't have to wait for service. Even if the interaction with each client is expected 
to be very brief, you can't always assume that that will be the case. You have to allow for the 
possibility of a misbehaving client — one that stays connected without sending data that the 
server expects. This can hang up a thread indefinitely, but in a threaded server there will be 
other threads that can carry on with other clients. 

The DateServer.java sample program, from Subsection 11.4.4, is an extremely simple net- 
work server program. It does not use threads, so the server must finish with one client before 
it can accept a connection from another client. Let's see how we can turn DateServer into 
a threaded server. (This server is so simple that doing so doesn't make a great deal of sense. 
However, the same techniques will work for more complicated servers. See, for example, Exer- 
cise 12.4.) 

As a first attempt, consider DateServerWithThreads.java. This sample program creates a 
new thread every time a connection request is received. The main program simply creates the 
thread and hands the connection to the thread. This takes very little time, and in particular 
will not block. The run() method of the thread handles the connection in exactly the same 
way that it would be handled by the original program. This is not at all difficult to program. 
Here's the new version of the program, with significant changes shown in italic: 

import java.net.*; 
import java.io.*; 
import java.util.Date; 

/** 

* This program is a server that takes connection requests on 

* the port specified by the constant LISTENING_PORT . When a 

* connection is opened, the program sends the current time to 

* the connected socket. The program will continue to receive 

* and process connections until it is killed (by a CDNTRDL-C, 

* for example) . 
* 

* This version of the program creates a new thread for 

* every connection request. 
*/ 

public class DateServerWithThreads { 

public static final int LISTENING_PORT = 32007; 

public static void main(String [] args) { 

ServerSocket listener; // Listens for incoming connections. 

Socket connection; // For communication with the connecting program. 

/* Accept and process connections forever, or until some error occurs. */ 

try { 

listener = new ServerSocket (LISTENING_PORT) ; 

System. out. printlnC'Listening on port " + LISTENING_PORT) ; 

while (true) { 

// Accept next connection request and create thread to handle it. 
connection = listener . accept () ; 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



625 



ConnectionHandler handler = new ConnectionHandler (connection) ; 
handler. start () ; 

} 

y 

catch (Exception e) { 

System. out .println( "Sorry , the server has shut down."); 

System. out .printlnC'Error : " + e) ; 

return; 

} 

} // end mainO 
/** 

* Defines a thread that handles the connection with one 

* client. 
*/ 

private static class ConnectionHandler extends Thread { 
Socket client; 

ConnectionHandler (Socket socket) { 
client = socket; 

y 

public void run() { 

String clientAddress = client . getlnetAddress () .toStringO ; 
try { 

System. out .printlnC'Connection from " + clientAddress ); 
Date now = new DateO; // The current date and time. 
PrintWriter outgoing; // Stream for sending data, 
outgoing = new PrintWriter( client . getOutputStreamO ); 
outgo ing.println( now.toStringO ); 

outgoing . flushO ; // Make sure the data is actually sent! 
client . closeO ; 

} 

catch (Exception e){ 

System. out .printlnC'Error on connection with: " 
+ clientAddress + ": " + e) ; 

y 

y 

y 

y //end class DateServerWithThreads 

One interesting change is at the end of the run() method, where I've added the clientAddress 
to the output of the error message. I did this to identify which connection the error message 
refers to. Since threads run in parallel, it's possible for outputs from different threads to be 
intermingled in various orders. Messages from the same thread don't necessarily come together 
in the output; they might be separated by messages from other threads. This is just one of the 
complications that you have to keep in mind when working with threads! 

12.4.4 Using a Thread Pool 

It's not very efficient to create a new thread for every connection, especially when the connec- 
tions are typically very short-lived. Fortunately, we have an alternative: thread pools (Subsec- 
tion 12.3.2). 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



626 



DateServerWithThreadPool.java is an improved version of our server that uses a thread 
pool. Each thread in the pool runs in an infinite loop. Each time through the loop, it handles 
one connection. We need a way for the main program to send connections to the threads. 
It's natural to use a blocking queue named connectionQueue for that purpose. A connection- 
handling thread takes connections from this queue. Since it is blocking queue, the thread blocks 
when the queue is empty and wakes up when a connection becomes available in the queue. No 
other synchronization or communication technique is needed; it's all built into the blocking 
queue. Here is the run() method for the connection-handling threads: 

public void run() { 
while (true) { 

Socket client; 
try { 

client = connectionQueue . take () ; // Blocks until item is available. 

} 

catch (InterruptedException e) { 

continue; // (If interrupted, just go back to start of while loop.) 

} 

String clientAddress = client .getlnetAddressO .toStringO ; 
try { 

System. out .printlnC'Connection from " + clientAddress ); 
System. out .printlnC'Handled by thread " + this); 
Date now = new DateO; // The current date and time. 
PrintWriter outgoing; // Stream for sending data, 
outgoing = new PrintWriter( client . getOutputStreamO ); 
outgoing. println( now.toStringO ); 

outgoing. flushO ; // Make sure the data is actually sent! 
client . closeQ ; 

} 

catch (Exception e){ 

System. out .printlnC'Error on connection with: " 
+ clientAddress + ": " + e) ; 

> 

> 

} 

The main program, in the meantime, runs in an infinite loop in which connections are accepted 
and added to the queue: 

while (true) { 

// Accept next connection request and put it in the queue, 
connection = listener . accept () ; 
try { 

connectionQueue .put (connection) ; // Blocks if queue is full. 

> 

catch (InterruptedException e) { 
} 

} 

The queue in this program is of type ArrayBlockingQueue<Socket> . As such, it has a limited 
capacity, and the put () operation on the queue will block if the queue is full. But wait — didn't 
we want to avoid blocking the main program? When the main program is blocked, the server is 
no longer accepting connections, and clients who are trying to connect are kept waiting. Would 
it be better to use a LinkedBlockingQueue, with an unlimited capacity? 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



627 



In fact, connections in the queue are waiting anyway; they are not being serviced. If the 
queue grows unreasonably long, connections in the queue will have to wait for an unreasonable 
amount of time. If the queue keeps growing indefinitely, that just means that the server is 
receiving connection requests faster than it can process them. That could happen for several 
reasons: Your server might simply not be powerful enough to handle the volume of traffic that 
you are getting; you need to buy a new server. Or perhaps the thread pool doesn't have enough 
threads to fully utilize your server; you should increase the size of the thread pool to match the 
server's capabilities. Or maybe your server is under a "Denial Of Service" attack, in which some 
bad guy is deliberately sending your server more requests than it can handle in an attempt to 
keep other, legitimate clients from getting service. 

In any case, ArrayBlockingQueue with limited capacity is the correct choice. The queue 
should be short enough so that connections in the queue will not have to wait too long for 
service. In a real server, the size of the queue and the number of threads in the thread pool 
should be adjusted to "tune" the server to account for the particular hardware and network on 
which the server is running and for the nature of the client requests that it typically processes. 
Optimal tuning is, in general, a difficult problem. 

There is, by the way, another way that things can go wrong: Suppose that the server needs 
to read some data from the client, but the client doesn't send the expected data. The thread 
that is trying to read the data can then block indefinitely, waiting for the input. If a thread 
pool is being used, this could happen to every thread in the pool. In that case, no further 
processing can ever take place! The solution to this problem is to have connections "time out" 
if they are inactive for an excessive period of time. Typically, each connection thread will keep 
track of the time when it last received data from the client. The server runs another thread 
(sometimes called a "reaper thread", after the Grim Reaper) that wakes up periodically and 
checks each connection thread to see how long it has been inactive. A connection thread that 
has been waiting too long for input is terminated, and a new thread is started in its place. The 
question of how long the timeout period should be is another difficult tuning issue. 

12.4.5 Distributed Computing 

We have seen how threads can be used to do parallel processing, where a number of processors 
work together to complete some task. So far, we have assumed that all the processors were 
inside one multi-processor computer. But parallel processing can also be done using processors 
that are in different computers, as long as those computers are connected to a network over 
which they can communicate. This type of parallel processing — in which a number of computers 
work together on a task and communicate over a network — is called distributed computing. 

In some sense, the whole Internet is an immense distributed computation, but here I am 
interested in how computers on a network can cooperate to solve some computational problem. 
There are several approaches to distributed computing that are supported in Java. RMI and 
CORBA are standards that enable a program running on one computer to call methods in 
objects that exist on other computers. This makes it possible to design an object-oriented 
program in which different parts of the program are executed on different computers. RMI 
(Remote Method Invocation) only supports communication between Java objects. CORBA 
(Common Object Request Broker Architecture) is a more general standard that allows objects 
written in various programming languages, including Java, to communicate with each other. 
As is commonly the case in networking, there is the problem of locating services (where in this 
case, a "service" means an object that is available to be called over the network). That is, how 
can one computer know which computer a service is located on and what port it is listening 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



628 



on? RMI and CORBA solve this problem using a "request broker" — a server program running 
at a known location keeps a list of services that are available on other computers. Computers 
that offer services register those services with the request broker; computers that need services 
contact the broker to find out where they are located. 

RMI and CORBA are complex systems that are not very easy to use. I mention them here 
because they are part of Java's standard network API, but I will not discuss them further. 
Instead, we will look at a relatively simple demonstration of distributed computing that uses 
only basic networking. 

The problem that we will consider is the same one that we used in MultiprocessingDemol.java, 
and its variations, in Section 12.2 and Section 12.3, namely the computation of a complex im- 
age. This is an application that uses the simplest type of parallel programming, in which the 
problem can be broken down into tasks that can be performed independently, with no commu- 
nication between the tasks. To apply distributed computing to this type of problem, we can 
use one "master" program that divides the problem into tasks and sends those tasks over the 
network to "worker" programs that do the actual work. The worker programs send their results 
back to the master program, which combines the results from all the tasks into a solution of 
the overall problem. In this context, the worker programs are often called "slaves," and the 
program uses the so-called master/slave approach to distributed computing. 

The demonstration program is defined by three source code files: CLMandelbrotMaster.java 
defines the master program; CLMandelbrotWorker.java defines the worker programs; and 
CLMandelbrotTask.java defines the class, CLMandelbrotTask, that represents an individual 
task that is performed by the workers. To run the demonstration, you must start the 
CLMandelbrotWorker program on several computers (probably by running it on the command 
line). This program uses CLMandelbrotTask, so both class files, CLMandelbrotWorker . class 
and CLMandelbrotTask. class, must be present on the worker computers. You can then run 
CLMandelbrotMaster on the master computer. Note that this program also requires the class 
CLMandelbrotTask. You must specify the host name or IP address of each of the worker com- 
puters as command line arguments for CLMandelbrotMaster. A worker program listens for 
connection requests from the master program, and the master program must be told where 
to send those requests. For example, if the worker program is running on three comput- 
ers with IP addresses 172.30.217.101, 172.30.217.102, and 172.30.217.103, then you can run 
CLMandelbrotMaster with the command 

java CLMandelbrotMaster 172.30.217.101 172.30.217.102 172.30.217.103 

The master will make a network connection to the worker at each IP address; these connections 
will be used for communication between the master program and the workers. 

It is possible to run several copies of CLMandelbrotWorker on the same computer, but 
they must listen for network connections on different ports. It is also possible to run 
CLMandelbrotWorker on the same computer as CLMandelbrotMaster. You might even see 
some speed-up when you do this, if your computer has several processors. See the comments in 
the program source code files for more information, but here are some commands that you can 
use to run the master program and two copies of the worker program on the same computer. 
Give these commands in separate command windows: 

java CLMandelbrotWorker (Listens on default port) 

java CLMandelbrotWorker 2501 (Listens on port 2501) 

java CLMandelbrotMaster localhost localhost : 2501 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



629 



Every time CLMandelbrotMaster is run, it solves exactly the same problem. (For this 
demonstration, the nature of the problem is not important, but the problem is to compute the 
data needed for a picture of a small piece of the famous "Mandelbrot Set." If you are interested 
in seeing the picture that is produced, uncomment the call to the savelmageO method at the 
end of the main() routine in CLMandelbrotMaster .java.) 

You can run CLMandelbrotMaster with different numbers of worker programs to see how 
the time required to solve the problem depends on the number of workers. (Note that the 
worker programs continue to run after the master program exists, so you can run the mas- 
ter program several times without having to restart the workers.) In addition, if you run 
CLMandelbrotMaster with no command line arguments, it will solve the entire problem on its 
own, so you can see how long it takes to do so without using distributed computing. In a trial 
that I ran on some rather old, slow computers, it took 40 seconds for CLMandelbrotMaster 
to solve the problem on its own. Using just one worker, it took 43 seconds. The extra time 
represents extra work involved in using the network; it takes time to set up a network connec- 
tion and to send messages over the network. Using two workers (on different computers), the 
problem was solved in 22 seconds. In this case, each worker did about half of the work, and 
their computations were performed in parallel, so that the job was done in about half the time. 
With larger numbers of workers, the time continued to decrease, but only up to a point. The 
master program itself has a certain amount of work to do, no matter how many workers there 
are, and the total time to solve the problem can never be less than the time it takes for the 
master program to do its part. In this case, the minimum time seemed to be about five seconds. 

* * * 

Let's take a look at how this distributed application is programmed. The master program 
divides the overall problem into a set of tasks. Each task is represented by an object of type 
CLMandelbrotTask. These tasks have to be communicated to the worker programs, and the 
worker programs must send back their results. Some protocol is needed for this communication. 
I decided to use character streams. The master encodes a task as a line of text, which is sent 
to a worker. The worker decodes the text (into an object of type CLMandelbrotTask) to find 
out what task it is supposed to perform. It performs the assigned task. It encodes the results 
as another line of text, which it sends back to the master program. Finally, the master decodes 
the results and combines them with the results from other tasks. After all the tasks have been 
completed and their results have been combined, the problem has been solved. 

A worker receives not just one task, but a sequence of tasks. Each time it finishes a task 
and sends back the result, it is assigned a new task. After all tasks are complete, the worker 
receives a "close" command that tells it to close the connection. In CLMandelbrotWorker.java, 
all this is done in a method named handleConnectionO that is called to handle a connection 
that has already been opened to the master program. It uses a method readTaskQ to decode 
a task that it receives from the master and a method writeResultsO to encode the results of 
the task for transmission back to the master. It must also handle any errors that occur: 

private static void handleConnection(Socket connection) { 
try { 

Buf f eredReader in = new Buf f eredReader ( 

new InputStreamReader ( connection. getlnputStreamO) ); 
PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(connection.getOutputStreamO) ; 
while (true) { 

String line = in.readLineO ; // Message from the master, 
if (line == null) { 

// End-of -stream encountered — should not happen. 



CHAPTER 12. 



THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



630 



throw new ExceptionC'Connection closed unexpectedly."); 

} 

if (line . startsWith(CLOSE_CONNECTION_CDMMAND) ) { 

// Represents the normal termination of the connection. 
System. out .printlnC'Received close command."); 
break; 

} 

else if (line.startsWith(TASK_COMMAND)) { 

// Represents a CLMandelbrotTask that this worker is 
// supposed to perform. 
CLMandelbrotTask task = readTask(line) ; // Decode the message, 
task. compute () ; // Perform the task. 

out. println(writeResults (task) ) ; // Send back the results. 
out.flushO; // Make sure data is sent promptly! 

} 

else { 

//No other messages are part of the protocol, 
throw new ExceptionC'Illegal command received."); 

} 

} 

} 

catch (Exception e) { 

System. out .printlnC'Client connection closed with error " + e) ; 

} 

finally { 
try { 

connection. closeO ; // Make sure the socket is closed. 

} 

catch (Exception e) { 
} 

> 

} 

Note that this method is not executed in a separate thread. The worker has only one thing to 
do at a time and does not need to be multithreaded. 

Turning to the master program, CLMandelbrotMaster.java, we encounter a more complex 
situation. The master program must communicate with several workers over several network 
connections. To accomplish this, the master program is multi-threaded, with one thread to 
manage communication with each worker. A pseudocode outline of the main() routine is quite 
simple: 

create a list of all tasks that must be performed 
if there are no command line arguments { 

// The master program does all the tasks itself. 
Perform each task. 

} 

else { 

// The tasks will be performed by worker programs, 
for each command line argument: 

Get information about a worker from command line argument. 

Create and start a thread to communicate with the worker. 
Wait for all threads to terminate. 

} 

// All tasks are now complete (assuming no error occurred). 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



631 



The list of tasks is stored in a variable, tasks, of type ConcurrentBlock- 
ingQueue<CLMandelbrotTask>, tasks. (See Subsection 12.3.2.) The communication threads 
take tasks from this list and send them to worker programs. The method tasks .poll () is used 
to remove a task from the queue. If the queue is empty, it returns null, which acts as a signal 
that all tasks have been assigned and the communication thread can terminate. 

The job of a thread is to send a sequence of tasks to a worker thread and to receive the 
results that the worker sends back. The thread is also responsible for opening the connection 
in the first place. A pseudocode outline for the process executed by the thread might look like: 

Create a socket connected to the worker program. 

Create input and output streams for communicating with the worker, 
while (true) { 

Let task = tasks .pollO . 

If task == null 

break; // All tasks have been assigned. 

Encode the task into a message and transmit it to the worker. 

Read the response from the worker. 

Decode and process the response. 

} 

Send a "close" command to the worker. 
Close the socket. 

This would work OK. However, there are a few subtle points. First of all, the thread must be 
ready to deal with a network error. For example, a worker might shut down unexpectedly. But if 
that happens, the master program can continue, provided other workers are still available. (You 
can try this when you run the program: Stop one of the worker programs, with CONTROL-C, 
and observe that the master program still completes successfully.) A difficulty arises if an 
error occurs while the thread is working on a task: If the problem as a whole is going to 
be completed, that task will have to be reassigned to another worker. I take care of this by 
putting the uncompleted task back into the task list. (Unfortunately, my program does not 
handle all possible errors. If the last worker thread fails, there will be no one left to take 
over the uncompleted task. Also, if a network connection "hangs" indefinitely without actually 
generating an error, my program will also hang, waiting for a response from a worker that 
will never arrive. A more robust program would have some way of detecting the problem and 
reassigning the task.) 

Another defect in the procedure outlined above is that it leaves the worker program idle 
while the thread is processing the worker's response. It would be nice to get a new task to the 
worker before processing the response from the previous task. This would keep the worker busy 
and allow two operations to proceed simultaneously instead of sequentially. (In this example, 
the time it takes to process a response is so short that keeping the worker waiting while it is 
done probably makes no significant difference. But as a general principle, it's desirable to have 
as much parallelism as possible in the algorithm.) We can modify the procedure to take this 
into account: 

try { 

Create a socket connected to the worker program. 

Create input and output streams for communicating with the worker. 
Let currentTask = tasks. pollO . 

Encode currentTask into a message and send it to the worker, 
while (true) { 

Read the response from the worker. 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



632 



Let nextTask = tasks. pollO . 
If nextTask != null { 

// Send nextTask to the worker before processing the 

// response to currentTask. 
Encode nextTask into a message and send it to the worker. 

} 

Decode and process the response to currentTask. 
currentTask = nextTask . 
if (currentTask == null) 

break; // All tasks have been assigned. 

} 

Send a "close" command to the worker. 
Close the socket . 

} 

catch (Exception e) { 

Put uncompleted task, if any, back into the task queue. 

} 

finally { 

Close the connection. 

} 

Finally, here is how this translates into Java. The pseudocode presented above becomes the 
run() method in the class that defines the communication threads used by the master program: 

/** 

* This class represents one worker thread. The job of a worker thread 

* is to send out tasks to a CLMandelbrotWorker program over a network 

* connection, and to get back the results computed by that program. 
*/ 

private static class WorkerConnection extends Thread { 

int id; // Identifies this thread in output statements. 

String host; // The host to which this thread will connect. 

int port; // The port number to which this thread will connect. 

/** 

* The constructor just sets the values of the instance 

* variables id, host, and port and starts the thread. 
*/ 

WorkerConnection(int id, String host, int port) { 
this. id = id; 
this. host = host; 
this. port = port; 
start () ; 

> 

/** 

* The runO method of the thread opens a connection to the host and 

* port specified in the constructor, then sends tasks to the 

* CLMandelbrotWorker program on the other side of that connection. 

* If the thread terminates normally, it outputs the number of tasks 

* that it processed. If it terminates with an error, it outputs 

* an error message .

12.5 Network Programming Example: 
A Networked Game Framework 

This section presents several programs that use networking and threads. The common (online) 

problem in each application is to support network communication between several programs 

running on different computers. A typical example of such an application is a networked game 

with two or more players, but the same problem can come up in less frivolous applications as 

well. The first part of this section describes a common framework that can be used for a variety 

of such applications, and the rest of the section discusses three specific applications that use 

that framework. 

This section was inspired by a pair of students, Alexander Kittelberger and Kieran Koehn- 
lein, who wanted to write a networked poker game as a final project in a class that I was 
teaching. I helped them with the network part of the project by writing a basic framework 
to support communication between the players. Since the application illustrates a variety of 
important ideas, I decided to include a somewhat more advanced and general version of that 
framework in the current edition of this book. The final example is a networked poker game. 

12.5.1 The Net game Framework 

One can imagine playing many different games over the network. As far as the network goes, 
all of those games have at least one thing in common: There has to be some way for actions 
taken by one player to be communicated over the network to other players. It makes good 
programming sense to make that capability available in a reusable common core that can be 
used in many different games. I have written such a core; it is defined by several classes in the 
package netgame. common. 

We have not done much with packages in this book, aside from using built-in classes. Pack- 
ages were introduced in Subsection 2.6.4, but we have stuck to the "default package" in our 
programming examples. In practice, however, packages are used in all but the simplest pro- 
gramming projects to divide the code into groups of related classes. It makes particularly good 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



635 



sense to define a reusable framework in a package that can be included as a unit in a variety of 
projects. 

Integrated development environments such as Eclipse or Netbeans make it very easy to use 
packages: To use the netgame package in a project in an IDE, simply copy-and-paste the entire 
netgame directory into the project. 

If you work on the command line, you should be in a working directory that includes 
the netgame directory as a subdirectory. Then, to compile all the java files in the package 
netgame. common, for example, you can use the following command in Mac OS or Linux: 

javac netgame/common/* . java 

For windows, you should use backslashes instead of forward slashes: 

javac netgame\common\* . java 

To run a main program that is defined in a package, you should again be in a directory that 
contains the package as a subdirectory, and you should use the full name of the class that you 
want to run. For example, the ChatRoomServer class, discussed later in this section, is defined 
in the package netgame. chat, so you would run it with the command 

java netgame . chat . ChatRoomServer 
I will have more to say about packages in the final example of the book, in Section 13.5. 



The applications discussed in this section are examples of distributed computing, since they 
involve several computers communicating over a network. Like the example in Subsection 12.4.5, 
they use a central "server," or "master," to which a number of "clients" will connect. All 
communication goes through the server; a client cannot send messages directly to another 
client. In this section, I will refer to the server as a hub, in the sense of "communications hub": 



In Subsection 12.4.5, messages were sent back and forth between the server and the client in a 
definite, predetermined sequence. Communication between the server and a client was actually 
communication between one thread running on the server and another thread running on the 
client. For the netgame framework, however, I want to allow for asynchronous communication, 
in which it is not possible to wait for messages to arrive in a predictable sequence. To make this 
possible a netgame client will use two threads for communication, one for sending messages and 
one for receiving messages. Similarly, the netgame hub will use two threads for communicating 
with each client. 



* * * 




CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



636 



The hub is generally connected to many clients and can receive messages from any of those 
clients at any time. The hub will have to process each message in some way. To organize this 
processing, the hub uses a single thread to process all incoming messages. When a communi- 
cation thread receives a message from a client, it simply drops that message into a queue of 
incoming messages. There is only one such queue, which is used for messages from all clients. 
The message processing thread runs in a loop in which it removes a message from the queue, 
processes it, removes another message from the queue, processes it, and so on. The queue itself 
is implemented as an object of type LinkedBlockingQueue (see Subsection 12.3.3). 



There is one more thread in the hub, not shown in the illustration. This final thread 
creates a ServerSocket and uses it to listen for connection requests from clients. Each time it 
accepts a connection request, it hands off the client to another object, defined by the nested 
class ConnectionToClient, which will handle communication with that client. Each connected 
client is identified by an ID number. ID numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . are assigned to clients as they 
connect. Since clients can also disconnect, the clients connected at any give time might not 
have consecutive IDs. A variable of type TreeMap<lnteger,ConnectionToClient> associates the 
ID numbers of connected clients with the objects that handle their connections. 

The messages that are sent and received are objects. The I/O streams that are used for 
reading and writing objects are of type ObjectlnputStream and ObjectOutputStream. (See Sub- 
section 11.1.6.) The output stream of a socket is wrapped in an ObjectOutputStream to make 
it possible to transmit objects through that socket. The socket's input stream is wrapped in 
an ObjectlnputStream to make it possible to receive objects. Remember that the objects that 
are used with such streams must implement the interface java. io . Serializable. 

The netgame Hub class is defined in the file Hub.java, in the package netgame. common. 
The port on which the server socket will listen must be specified as a parameter to the Hub 
constructor. The Hub class defines a method 

protected void messageReceived(int playerlD, Object message) 

which is called to process messages that are received from clients. The first parameter, 
playerlD, is the ID number of the client from whom the message was received, and the second 
parameter is the message itself. In the Hub class, this method will simply forward the mes- 
sage to all connected clients. To forward the message, it wraps both the playerlD and the 
message in an object of type ForwardedMessage (defined in the file ForwardedMessage.java, in 
the package netgame . common). In a simple application such as the chat room discussed in the 
next subsection, this might be sufficient. For most applications, however, it will be necessary to 




CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



637 



define a subclass of Hub and redefine the messageReceivedO method to do more complicated 
message processing. There are several other methods that a subclass might redefine, including 

• protected void playerConnected(int playerlD) — This method is called each time 
a player connects to the hub. The parameter playerlD is the ID number of the newly con- 
nected player. In the Hub class, this method does nothing. Note that the complete list of 
ID numbers for currently connected players can be obtained by calling getPlayerList () . 

• protected void playerDisconnected(int playerlD) - - This is called each time a 
player disconnects from the hub. The parameter tells which player has just disconnected. 
In the Hub class, this method does nothing. 

The Hub class also defines a number of useful public methods, notably 

• sendToAll (message) — sends the specified message to every client that is currently con- 
nected to the hub. The message must be a non-null object that implements the Serializable 
interface. 

• sendToOne(recipientID, message) — sends a specified message to just one user. The 
first parameter, recipientID is the ID number of the client who will receive the message. 
This method returns a boolean value, which is false if there is no connected client with 
the specified recipientID. 

• shutDownServerSocket () — shuts down the hub's server socket, so that no additional 
clients will be able to connect. This could be used, for example, in a two-person game, 
after the second client has connected. 

• setAutoreset (autoreset) — sets the boolean value of the autoreset property. If this 
property is true, then the ObjectOutputStreams that are used to transmit messages to 
clients will automatically be reset before each message is transmitted. (Resetting an 
ObjectOutputStream is something that has to be done if an object is written to the stream, 
modified, and then written to the stream again. If the stream is not reset before writing 
the modified object, then the old, unmodified value is sent to the stream instead of the 
new value. See Subsection 11.1.6 for a discussion of this technicality.) 

For more information — and to see how all this is implemented — you should read the source 
code file Hub.java. With some effort, you should be able to understand everything in that file. 

* * * 

Turning to the client side, the basic net game client class is defined in the file Client Java, in 
the package netgame. common. The Client class has a constructor that specifies the host name 
(or IP address) and port number of the hub to which the client will connect. This constructor 
blocks until the connection has been established. 

Client is an abstract class. Every netgame application must define a subclass of Client and 
provide a definition for the abstract method: 

abstract protected void messageReceived (Object message); 

This method is called each time a message is received from the netgame hub to which the client is 
connected. A subclass of client might also override the protected methods playerConnected, 
playerDisconnected, serverShutdown, and connectionClosedByError. See the source code 
for more information. I should also note that Client contains the protected instance variable 
connectedPlayerlDs, of type int [] , an array containing the ID numbers of all the clients that 
are currently connected to the hub. The most important public methods that are provided by 
the Client class are

• send (message) — transmits a message to the hub. The message can be any non-null 
object that implements the Serializable interface. 

• getlDO — gets the ID number that was assigned to this client by the hub. 

• disconnect () — closes the client's connection to the hub. It is not possible to send 
messages after disconnecting. The send() method will throw an HlegalStateException if 
an attempt is made to do so. 

The Hub and Client classes are meant to define a general framework that can be used as the 
basis for a variety of networked games — and, indeed, of other distributed programs. The low 
level details of network communication and multithreading are hidden in the private sections 
of these classes. Applications that build on these classes can work in terms of higher-level 
concepts such as players and messages. The design of these classes was developed though 
several iterations, based on experience with several actual applications. I urge you to look at 
the source code to see how Hub and Client use threads, sockets, and streams. In the remainder 
of this section, I will discuss three applications built on the netgame framework. I will not 
discuss these applications in great detail. You can find the complete source code for all three 
in the netgame package. 

12.5.2 A Simple Chat Room 

Our first example is a "chat room," a network application where users can connect to a server 
and can then post messages that will be seen by all current users of the room. It is similar to 
the GUIChat program from Subsection 12.4.2, except that any number of users can participate 
in a chat. While this application is not a game as such, it does show the basic functionality of 
the netgame framework. 

The chat room application consists of two programs. The first, ChatRoomServer.java, is a 
completely trivial program that simply creates a netgame Hub to listen for connection requests 
from netgame clients: 

public static void main (String [] args) { 
try { 

new Hub (PORT); 

> 

catch (IOException e) { 

System. out .printlnO'Can't create listening socket. Shutting down."); 

> 

} 

The port number, PORT, is defined as a constant in the program and is arbitrary, as long as 
both the server and the clients use the same port. 

The second part of the chat room application is the program ChatRoomWindow.java, which 
is meant to be run by users who want to participate in the chat room. A potential user must 
know the name (or IP address) of the computer where the hub is running. (For testing, it is 
possible to run the client program on the same computer as the hub, using localhost as the 
name of the computer where the hub is running.) When ChatRoomWindow is executed, it uses 
a dialog box to ask the user for this information. It then opens a window that will serve as 
the user's interface to the chat room. The window has a large transcript area that displays 
messages that users post to the chat room. It also has a text input box where the user can 
enter messages. When the user enters a message, that message will be posted to the transcript 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



639 



of every user who is connected to the hub, so all users see every message sent by every user. 
Let's look at some of the programming. 

Any netgame application must define a subclass of the abstract Client class. For the chat 
room application, clients are defined by a nested class ChatClient inside ChatRoomWindow. 
The program has an instance variable, connection, of type ChatClient, which represents the 
program's connection to the hub. When the user enters a message, that message is sent to the 
hub by calling 

connection. send (message) ; 

When the hub receives the message, it packages it into an object of type ForwardedMessage, 
along with the ID number of the client who sent the message. The hub sends a copy of that 
ForwardedMessage to every connected client, including the client who sent the message. When 
the message is received from the hub by a client object, the messageReceivedO method of 
the client object is called. ChatClient overrides this method to make it add the message to the 
transcript of the ChatClientWindow. 

A client is also notified when a player connects to or disconnects from the hub and when the 
connection with the hub is lost. ChatClient overrides the methods that are called when these 
events happen so that they post appropriate messages to the transcript. Here's the complete 
definition of the client class for the chat room application: 

/** 

* A ChatClient connects to a Hub and is used to send messages to 

* and receive messages from the Hub. Messages received from the 

* Hub will be of type ForwardedMessage and will contain the 

* ID number of the sender and the string that was sent by that user . 
*/ 

private class ChatClient extends Client { 
/** 

* Opens a connection to the chat room server on a specified computer. 
*/ 

ChatClient (String host) throws IOException { 
super (host, PORT); 

} 

/** 

* Responds when a message is received from the server. It should be 

* a ForwardedMessage representing something that one of the participants 

* in the chat room is saying. The message is simply added to the 

* transcript, along with the ID number of the sender. 
*/ 

protected void messageReceived(Object message) { 
if (message instanceof ForwardedMessage) { 

// (no other message types are expected) 
ForwardedMessage fm = (ForwardedMessage)message ; 
addToTranscript("#" + fm.senderlD + " SAYS: " + fm. message); 

> 

> 

/** 

* Called when the connection to the client is shut down because of some 

* error message. (This will happen if the server program is terminated.) 
*/ 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



640 



protected void connectionClosedByError (String message) { 

addToTranscript(" Sorry, communication has shut down due to an error:\n 

+ message) ; 

sendButton. setEnabled(f alse) ; 
messagelnput . setEnabled(f alse) ; 
messagelnput . setEditable (false) ; 
messagelnput . setText ( " " ) ; 
connected = false; 
connection = null; 

> 

/** 

* Posts a message to the transcript when someone leaves the chat room. 
*/ 

protected void playerConnected(int newPlayerlD) { 

addToTranscriptC Someone new has joined the chat room, with ID number " 

+ newPlayerlD) ; 

> 

/** 

* Posts a message to the transcript when someone leaves the chat room. 
*/ 

protected void playerDisconnected(int departingPlayerlD) { 

addToTranscriptO'The person with ID number " + departingPlayerlD 

+ " has left the chat room"); 

> 

} // end nested class ChatClient 

For the full source code of the chat room application, see the source code files, which can be 
found in the package netgame.chat. 

Note: A user of my chat room application is identified only by an ID number that is 
assigned by the hub when the client connects. Essentially, users are anonymous, which is not 
very satisfying. See Exercise 12.6 at the end of this chapter for a way of addressing this issue. 

12.5.3 A Networked TicTacToe Game 

My second example is a very simple game: the familiar children's game TicTacToe. In TicTac- 
Toe, two players alternate placing marks on a three-by-three board. One player plays X's; the 
other plays O's. The object is to get three X's or three O's in a row. 

At a given time, the state of a TicTacToe game consists of various pieces of information 
such as the current contents of the board, whose turn it is, and — when the game is over — who 
won or lost. In a typical non-networked version of the game, this state would be represented 
by instance variables. The program would consult those instance variables to determine how 
to draw the board and how to respond to user actions such as mouse clicks. In the networked 
netgame version, however, there are three programs involved: Two copies of a client program, 
which provide the interface to the two players of the game, and the hub program that manages 
the connections to the clients. These programs are not even running on the same computer, 
so they can't share the same instance variables. Nevertheless, the game has to have a single, 
well-defined state at any time, and both players have to be aware of that state. 

My solution is to store the "official" game state in the hub, and to send a copy of that state 
to each player every time the state changes. The players can't change the state directly. When 
a player takes some action, such as placing a piece on the board, that action is sent as a message 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



641 



to the hub. The hub changes the state to reflect the result of the action, and it sends the new 
state to both players. The window used by each player will then be updated to reflect the new 
state. In this way, we can be sure that the game always looks the same to both players. 

Networked TicTacToe is defined in several classes in the package netgame.tictactoe. Tic- 
TacToeGameState represents the state of a game. It includes a method 

public void applyMessage (int senderlD, Object message) 

that modifies the state to reflect the effect of a message received from one of the players of 
the game. The message will represent some action taken by the player, such as clicking on the 
board. 

The Hub class knows nothing about TicTacToe. Since the hub for the TicTacToe game 
has to keep track of the state of the game, it has to be defined by a subclass of Hub. The 
TicTacToeGameHub class is quite simple. It overrides the messageReceivedO method so 
that it responds to a message from a player by applying that message to the game state and 
sending a copy of the new state to both players. It also overrides the playerConnectedO 
and playerDisconnectedO methods to take appropriate actions, since the game can only be 
played when there are exactly two connected players. Here is the complete source code: 

package netgame.tictactoe; 

import java. io . IOException; 

import netgame. common. Hub; 

/** 

* A "Hub" for the network TicTacToe game. There is only one Hub 

* for a game, and both network players connect to the same Hub. 

* Official information about the state of the game is maintained 

* on the Hub. When the state changes, the Hub sends the new 

* state to both players , ensuring that both players see the 

* same state. 
*/ 

public class TicTacToeGameHub extends Hub { 

private TicTacToeGameState state; // Records the state of the game. 
/** 

* Create a hub, listening on the specified port. Note that this 

* method calls setAutoreset (true) , which will cause the output stream 

* to each client to be reset before sending each message. This is 

* essential since the same state object will be transmitted over and 

* over, with changes between each transmission. 

* (Sparam port the port number on which the hub will listen. 

* Othrows IOException if a listener cannot be opened on the specified port. 
*/ 

public TicTacToeGameHub (int port) throws IOException { 
super (port) ; 

state = new TicTacToeGameState () ; 
setAutoreset (true) ; 

> 

/** 

* Responds when a message is received from a client. In this case, 

* the message is applied to the game state, by calling state . applyMessage () . 

* Then the possibly changed state is transmitted to all connected players. 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



642 



*/ 

protected void messageReceived(int playerlD, Object message) { 
state. applyMessage (playerlD, message) ; 
sendToAll (state) ; 

} 

/** 

* This method is called when a player connects. If that player 

* is the second player, then the server's listening socket is 

* shut down (because only two players are allowed) , the 

* first game is started, and the new state — with the game 

* now in progress — is transmitted to both players. 
*/ 

protected void playerConnected(int playerlD) { 
if (getPlayerListO .length == 2) { 
shutdownServerSocketO ; 
state . startFirstGame () ; 
sendToAll (state) ; 

} 

> 

/** 

* This method is called when a player disconnects. This will 

* end the game and cause the other player to shut down as 

* well. This is accomplished by setting state .playerDisconnected 

* to true and sending the new state to the remaining player, if 

* there is one, to notify that player that the game is over. 
*/ 

protected void playerDisconnected (int playerlD) { 
state .playerDisconnected = true; 
sendToAll (state) ; 

} 



} 



A player's interface to the game is represented by the class TicTacToeWindow. As in the 
chat room application, this class defines a nested subclass of Client to represent the client's 
connection to the hub. One interesting point is how the client responds to a message from 
the hub. Such a message represents a new game state. When the message is received, the 
window must be updated to show the new state. The message is received and processed by 
one thread; the updating is done in another thread. This has the potential of introducing race 
conditions that require synchronization. (In particular, as I was developing the program, I 
found that it was possible for a message to be received before the window's constructor had 
finished executing. This led to a very hard-to-diagnose bug because my response to the message 
was trying to use objects that had not yet been created.) 

When working with the Swing API, it is recommended that all modifications to the GUI 
be made in the GUI event thread. An alternative would be to make paintComponent () and 
other methods synchronized, but that would negatively impact the performance of the GUI. 
Swing includes a method SwingUtilitites . invokeLater (runnable) to make it possible to 
run arbitrary code in the GUI event thread. The parameter, runnable, is an object that 
implements the Runnable interface that was discussed in Subsection 12.1.1. A Runnable object 
has a run() method. SwingUtilities.runLaterQ will schedule the run() method of the 
object to be executed in the GUI event thread. It will be executed after that thread has 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



643 



finished handling any pending events. By executing run() in the event thread, you can be sure 
that it will not introduce any synchronization problems. In the TicTacToe client class, this 
technique is used in the method that processes events received from the hub: 

protected void messageReceived(f inal Object message) { 
if (message instanceof TicTacToeGameState) { 
SwingUtilities . invokeLater (new Runnable (){ 
public void run() { 

// The newStateO method updates the GUI for the new state. 
newState( (TicTacToeGameState)message ); 

} 

»; 

} 

} 

(The SwingUtilities class, by the way, includes a variety of useful static methods that can be 
used in programming with Swing; it's worth taking a look at the documentation for that class.) 

To run the TicTacToe netgame, the two players should each run the program Main.java in 
the package netgame. tictactoe. This program presents the user with a dialog box where the user 
can choose to start a new game or to join an existing game. If the user starts a new game, then 
a TicTacToeHub is created to manage the game; a TicTacToeWindow is created and connects to 
that hub. If the user chooses to connect to an existing game, then only the window is created; 
that window connects to the hub that was created by the first player. The second player has 
to know the name of the computer where the first player's program is running. As usual, for 
testing, you can run everything on one computer and use "localhost" as the computer name. 

12.5.4 A Networked Poker Game 

And finally, we turn very briefly to the application that inspired the netgame framework: Poker. 
In particular, I have implemented a two-player version of the traditional "five card draw" version 
of that game. This is a rather complex application, and I do not intend to say much about it 
here other than to describe the general design. The full source code can be found in the package 
netgame. fivecarddraw. To fully understand it, you will need to be familiar with the game of 
five card draw poker. And it uses some techniques from Section 13.1 for drawing the cards. 

In general outline, the Poker game is similar to the TicTacToe game. There is a Main class 
that can be run by either player, to start a new game or to join an existing game. There is a 
class PokerGameState to represent the state of a game. And there is a subclass, PokerHub, of 
Hub to manage the game. 

But Poker is a much more complicated game than TicTacToe, and the game state is cor- 
respondingly more complicated. It's not clear that we want to broadcast a new copy of the 
complete game state to the players every time some minor change is made in the state. Fur- 
thermore, it doesn't really make sense for both players to know the full game state — that would 
include the opponent's hand and full knowledge of the deck from which the cards are dealt. (Of 
course, our client programs wouldn't have to show the full state to the players, but it would 
be easy enough for a player to substitute their own client program to enable cheating.) So in 
the Poker application, the full game state is known only to the PokerHub. A PokerGameState 
object represents a view of the game from the point of view of one player only. When the state 
of the game changes, the PokerHub creates two different PokerGameState objects, representing 
the state of the game from each player's point of view, and it sends the appropriate game state 
objects to each player. You can see the source code for details. 



CHAPTER 12. THREADS AND MULTIPROCESSING 



644 



(One of the hard parts in poker is to implement some way to compare two hands, to see 
which is higher. In my game, this is handled by the class PokerRank. You might find this class 
useful in other poker games.) 



Exercises

Exercises for Chapter 12 

1. Subsection 12.1.3 discusses the need for synchronization in multithreaded programs, and (solution) 
it defines a ThreadSafeCounter class with the necessary synchronization. Is this really 
important? Can you really get errors by using an unsynchronized counter with multiple 

threads? Write a program to find out. Use the following unsynchronized counter class, 
which you can include as a nested class in your program: 

static class Counter { 
int count ; 
void inc() { 

count = count+1; 

} 

int getCountO { 
return count ; 

} 

> 

Write a thread class that will call the inc() method in this class a specified number of 
times. Create several threads, start them all, and wait for all the threads to terminate. 
Print the final value of the counter, and see whether it is correct. 

Let the user enter the number of threads and the number of times that each thread 
will increment the counter. You might need a fairly large number of increments to see 
an error. And of course there can never be any error if you use just one thread. Your 
program can use joinO to wait for a thread to terminate (see Subsection 12.1.2). 

2. Exercise 3.2 asked you to find the integer in the range 1 to 10000 that has the largest (solution) 
number of divisors. Now write a program that uses multiple threads to solve the same 
problem, but for the range 1 to 100000 (or less, if you don't have a fast computer). By 

using threads, your program will take less time to do the computation when it is run 
on a multiprocessor computer. At the end of the program, output the elapsed time, the 
integer that has the largest number of divisors, and the number of divisors that it has. 
The program can be modeled on the sample prime-counting program ThreadTest2.java 
from Subsection 12.1.3. For this exercise, you should simply divide up the problem into 
parts and create one thread to do each part. 

3. In the previous exercise, you divided up a large task into a small number of large pieces (solution) 
and created a thread to execute each task. Because of the nature of the problem, this 

meant that some threads had much more work to do than others — it is much easier to 
find the number of divisors of a small number than it is of a big number. As discussed in 
Subsection 12.3.1, a better approach is to break up the problem into a fairly large number 
of smaller problems. Subsection 12.3.2 shows how to use a thread pool to execute the 
tasks: Each thread in the pool runs in a loop in which it repeatedly takes a task from a 
queue and carries out that task. Implement a thread pool strategy for solving the same 
maximum-number-of-divisors problem as in the previous exercise. 

To make things even more interesting, you should try a new technique for combining 
the results from all the tasks: Use two queues in your program. Use a queue of tasks, as 
usual, to hold the tasks that will be executed by the thread pool (Subsection 12.3.2). But 
also use a queue of results produced by the threads. When a task completes, the result 



Exercises 



646 



from that task should be placed into the result queue. The main program can read results 
from the second queue as they become available, and combine all the results to get the 
final answer. The result queue will have to be a blocking queue (Subsection 12.3.3), since 
the main program will have to wait for tasks to become available. Note that the main 
program knows the exact number of results that it expects to read from the queue, so it 
can do so in a for loop; when the for loop completes, the main program knows that all 
the tasks have been executed. 

4. In Exercise 11.3, you wrote a network server program that can send text files from a (solution) 
specified directory to clients. That program used a single thread, which handled all the 
communication with each client. Modify the program to turn it into a multithreaded 

server. Use a thread pool of connection-handling threads and use an ArrayBlockingQueue 
to get connected sockets from the main() routine to the threads. The sample program 
DateServerWithThreads.java from Subsection 12.4.3 is an example of a multithreaded 
server that works in this way. Your server program will work with the same client program 
as the original server. You wrote the client program as the solution to Exercise 11.4. 

5. It is possible to get an estimate of the mathematical constant tt by using a random process. (solution) 
The idea is based on the fact that the area of a circle of radius 1 is equal to tt, and the 

area of a quarter of that circle is 7r/4. Here is a picture of a quarter of a circle of radius 1, 
inside a 1-by-l square: 




The area of the whole square is one, while the area of the part inside the circle is 7r/4. If 
we choose a point in the square at random, the probability that it is inside the circle is 
7r/4. If we choose N points in the square at random, and if C of them are inside the circle, 
we expect the fraction C/N of points that fall inside the circle to be about 7r/4. That is, 
we expect 4*C/N to be close to tt. If N is large, we can expect 4*C/N to be a good estimate 
for tt, and as N gets larger and larger, the estimate is likely to improve. 

We can pick a random number in the square by choosing numbers x and y in the range 
to 1 (using Math . random ()) . Since the equation of the circle is x*x+y*y=l, the point 
lies inside the circle if x*x+y*y is less than 1. One trial consists of picking x and y and 
testing whether x*x+y*y is less than 1. To get an estimate for tt, you have to do many 
trials, count the trials, and count the number of trials in which x*x+y*y is less than 1, 

For this exercise, you should write a GUI program that does this computation and 
displays the result. The computation should be done in a separate thread, and the results 
should be displayed periodically. The program can use JLabels to the display the results. 
It should set the text on the labels after running each batch of, say, one million trials. 
(Setting the text after each trial doesn't make sense, since millions of trials can be done in 
one second, and trying to change the display millions of times per second would be silly. 

Your program should have a "Run" /" Pause" button that controls the computation. 
When the program starts, clicking "Run" will start the computation and change the text 
on the button to "Pause". Clicking "Pause" will cause the computation to pause. The 



Exercises 



647 



thread that does the computation should be started at the beginning of the program, but 
should immediately go into the paused state until the "Run" button is pressed. Use the 
wait() method in the thread to make it wait until "Run" is pressed. Use the notify () 
method when the "Run" button is pressed to wake up the thread. Use a boolean signal 
variable running to control whether the computation thread is paused. (The waitQ and 
notify () methods are covered in Subsection 12.3.4.) 

Here is a picture of the program after it has run more than ten billion trials: 



Actual value of pi : 


3.141592653589793 


Current Estimate: 


3.141580307812044 


Number of Trials: 


10279000000 




| l Run l | 



You might want to start with a version of the program with no control button. In that 
version, the computation thread can run continually from the time it is started. Once that 
is working, you can add the button and the control feature. 

To get you started, here is the code from the thread in my solution that runs one batch 
of trials and updates the display labels: 

for (int i = 0; i < BATCHJ3IZE; i++) { 
double x = Math. random () ; 
double y = Math. random () ; 
trialCount++; 
if (x*x + y*y < 1) 
inCircleCount++ ; 

> 

double estimateForPi = 4 * ( (double) inCircleCount / trialCount) ; 
countLabel . setText ( " Number of Trials: " + trialCount); 

piEstimateLabel . setText ( " Current Estimate: " + estimateForPi); 

The variables trialCount and inCircleCount are of type long in order to allow the 
number of trials to be more than the two billion or so that would be possible with a 
variable of type int. 

(I was going to ask you to use multiple computation threads, one for each available 
processor, but I ran into an issue when using the Math . random ( ) method in several threads. 
This method requires synchronization, which causes serious performance problems when 
several threads are using it to generate large amounts of random numbers. A solution 
to this problem is to have each thread use its own object of type java.util .Random to 
generate its random numbers (see Subsection 5.3.1). My on-line solution to this exercise 
discusses this problem further.) 

6. The chat room example from Subsection 12.5.2 can be improved in several ways. First, it (solution) 
would be nice if the participants in the chat room could be identified by name instead of 
by number. Second, it would be nice if one person could send a private message to another 
person that would be seen just by that person rather than by everyone. Make these two 
changes. You can start with a copy of the package netgame.chat. You will also need the 
package netgame. common, which defines the netgame framework. 

To make the first change, you will have to implement a subclass of Hub that can keep 
track of client names as well as numbers. To get the name of a client to the hub, you 



Exercises 



648 



can override the extraHandshake () method both in the Hub subclass and in the Client 
subclass. The extraHandshake () method is called as part of setting up the connection 
between the client and the hub. It is called after the client has been assigned an ID 
number but before the connection is considered to be fully connected. It should throw 
an lOException if some error occurs during the setup process. Note that messages that 
are sent by the hub should be read by the client and vice versa. The extraHandshake () 
method in the Client is defined as: 

protected void extraHandshake (ObjectlnputStream in, ObjectOutputStream out) 

throws lOException 

while in the Hub, there is an extra parameter that tells the ID number of the client whose 
connection is being set up: 

protected void extraHandshake (in playerlD, ObjectlnputStream in, 

ObjectOutputStream out) throws lOException 

In the ChatRoomWindow class, the main() routine asks the user for the name of the 
computer where the server is running. You can add some code there to ask the user their 
name. You will have to decide what to do if two users want to use the same name. You 
might consider having a list of users who are allowed to join the chat room. You might 
even assign them passwords. 

For the second improvement, personal messages, I suggest defining a PrivateMessage 
class. A PrivateMessage object would include both the string that represents the message 
and the ID numbers of the player to whom the message is being sent and the player who 
sent the message. The hub will have to be programmed to know how to deal with such 
messages. A PrivateMessage should only be sent to the client who is listed as the recipient 
of the message. You need to decide how the user will input a private message and how 
the user will select the recipient of the message.

10. Consider the ThreadSafeCounter example from Subsection 12.1.3:

private int count =0; // The value of the counter. 

synchronized public void increment () {

> 

synchronized public int getValueO { 
return count ; 

} 

} 

The increment ( ) method is synchronized so that the caller of the method can complete 
the three steps of the operation "Get value of count," "Add 1 to value," "Store new value in 
count" without being interrupted by another thread. But getValueO consists of a single, 
simple step. Why is getValueO synchronized? (This is a deep and tricky question.)

Advanced GUI Programming 



It's possible to program a wide variety of GUI applications using only the techniques cov- 
ered in Chapter 6. In many cases, the basic events, components, layouts, and graphics routines 
covered in that chapter suffice. But the Swing graphical user interface library is far richer than 
what we have seen so far, and it can be used to build highly sophisticated applications. This 
chapter is a further introduction to Swing and other aspects of GUI programming. Although 
the title of the chapter is "Advanced GUI Programming," it is still just an introduction. Full 
coverage of this topic would require at least another complete book. 

13.1 Images and Resources 

We HAVE SEEN HOW TO USE the Graphics class to draw on a GUI component that is visible on (online) 
the computer's screen. Often, however, it is useful to be able to create a drawing off-screen, 
in the computer's memory. It is also important to be able to work with images that are stored 
in files. 

To a computer, an image is just a set of numbers. The numbers specify the color of each 
pixel in the image. The numbers that represent the image on the computer's screen are stored 
in a part of memory called a frame buffer. Many times each second, the computer's video 
card reads the data in the frame buffer and colors each pixel on the screen according to that 
data. Whenever the computer needs to make some change to the screen, it writes some new 
numbers to the frame buffer, and the change appears on the screen a fraction of a second later, 
the next time the screen is redrawn by the video card. 

Since it's just a set of numbers, the data for an image doesn't have to be stored in a frame 
buffer. It can be stored elsewhere in the computer's memory. It can be stored in a file on the 
computer's hard disk. Just like any other data file, an image file can be downloaded over the 
Internet. Java includes standard classes and subroutines that can be used to copy image data 
from one part of memory to another and to get data from an image file and use it to display 
the image on the screen. 

13.1.1 Images and Bufferedlmages 

The class j ava . awt . Image represents an image stored in the computer's memory. There are two 
fundamentally different types of Image. One kind represents an image read from a source outside 
the program, such as from a file on the computer's hard disk or over a network connection. The 
second type is an image created by the program. I refer to this second type as an off-screen 
canvas. An off-screen canvas is a region of the computer's memory that can be used as a 



650 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



651 



drawing surface. It is possible to draw to an off-screen image using the same Graphics class that 
is used for drawing on the screen. 

An Image of either type can be copied onto the screen (or onto an off-screen canvas) 
using methods that are defined in the Graphics class. This is most commonly done in the 
paintComponent () method of a JComponent. Suppose that g is the Graphics object that is 
provided as a parameter to the paintComponent () method, and that img is of type Image. 
Then the statement 

g. drawlmage (img, x, y, this); 

will draw the image img in a rectangular area in the component. The integer- valued parameters 
x and y give the position of the upper-left corner of the rectangle in which the image is displayed, 
and the rectangle is just large enough to hold the image. The fourth parameter, this, is the 
special variable from Subsection 5.6.1 that refers to the JComponent itself. This parameter is 
there for technical reasons having to do with the funny way Java treats image files. For most 
applications, you don't need to understand this, but here is how it works: g.drawlmage() does 
not actually draw the image in all cases. It is possible that the complete image is not available 
when this method is called; this can happen, for example, if the image has to be read from 
a file. In that case, g . drawlmage () merely initiates the drawing of the image and returns 
immediately. Pieces of the image are drawn later, asynchronously, as they become available. 
The question is, how do they get drawn? That's where the fourth parameter to the drawlmage 
method comes in. The fourth parameter is something called an ImageObserver. When a piece 
of the image becomes available to be drawn, the system will inform the ImageObserver, and 
that piece of the image will appear on the screen. Any JComponent object can act as an 
ImageObserver. The drawlmage method returns a boolean value to indicate whether the image 
has actually been drawn or not when the method returns. When drawing an image that you 
have created in the computer's memory, or one that you are sure has already been completely 
loaded, you can set the ImageObserver parameter to null. This is true in particular for any 
Buffered I mage 

There are a few useful variations of the drawlmage () method. For example, it is possible to 
scale the image as it is drawn to a specified width and height. This is done with the command 

g. drawlmage (img, x, y, width, height, imageObserver) ; 

The parameters width and height give the size of the rectangle in which the image is displayed. 
Another version makes it possible to draw just part of the image. In the command: 

g. drawlmage (img, dest_xl, dest_yl, dest_x2, dest_y2, 

source_xl, source_yl , source_x2, source_y2, imageObserver); 

the integers source_xl, source.yl, source_x2, and source_y2 specify the top-left and bottom- 
right corners of a rectangular region in the source image. The integers dest_xl, dest_yl, 
dest_x2, and dest_y2 specify the corners of a region in the destination graphics context. The 
specified rectangle in the image is drawn, with scaling if necessary, to the specified rectangle in 
the graphics context. For an example in which this is useful, consider a card game that needs 
to display 52 different cards. Dealing with 52 image files can be cumbersome and inefficient, 
especially for downloading over the Internet. So, all the cards might be put into a single image:

(This image is from the Gnome desktop project, http://www.gnome.org, and is shown here 
much smaller than its actual size.) Now just one Image object is needed. Drawing one card 
means drawing a rectangular region from the image. This technique is used in a variation 
of the sample program HighLowGUI.java from Subsection 6.7.6. In the original version, the 
cards are represented by textual descriptions such as "King of Hearts." In the new version, 
HighLowWithlmages.java, the cards are shown as images. An applet version of the program 
can be found in the ondine version of this section. 

In the program, the cards are drawn using the following method. The instance variable 
cardlmages is a variable of type Image that represents the image that is shown above, containing 
52 cards, plus two Jokers and a face-down card. Each card is 79 by 123 pixels. These numbers 
are used, together with the suit and value of the card, to compute the corners of the source 
rectangle for the drawlmage ( ) command: 

/** 

* Draws a card in a 79x123 pixel rectangle with its 

* upper left corner at a specified point (x,y) . Drawing the card 

* requires the image file "cards. png". 

* Oparam g The graphics context used for drawing the card. 

* Oparam card The card that is to be drawn. If the value is null, then a 

* face-down card is drawn. 

* Oparam x the x-coord of the upper left corner of the card 

* Oparam y the y-coord of the upper left corner of the card 
*/ 

public void drawCard (Graphics g, Card card, int x, int y) ■[ 

int cx; // x-coord of upper left corner of the card inside cardslmage 
int cy; // y-coord of upper left corner of the card inside cardslmage 
if (card == null) { 

C y = 4*123; // coords for a face-down card. 

cx = 2*79; 

} 

else { 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



653 



cx = (card. get Value ()-l)*79; 
switch (card.getSuitO) { 
case Card. CLUBS: 

cy = 0; 

break; 
case Card. DIAMONDS: 

cy = 123; 

break; 
case Card. HEARTS: 

cy = 2*123; 

break; 
default: // spades 

cy = 3*123; 

break; 

} 

} 

g . drawlmage (cardlmages , x , y , x+79 , y+123 , cx , cy , cx+79 , cy+123 , this) ; 

} 

I will tell you later in this section how the image file, cards . png, can be loaded into the program. 

* * * 

In addition to images loaded from files, it is possible to create images by drawing to an 
off-screen canvas. An off-screen canvas can be represented by an object belonging to the class 
BufFeredlmage, which is defined in the package java. awt . image. BufFeredlmage is a subclass of 
Image, so that once you have a BufFeredlmage, you can copy it into a graphics context g using one 
of the g. drawlmage () methods, just as you would do with any other image. A BuFFeredlmage 
can be created using the constructor 

public Buf f eredlmage(int width, int height, int imageType) 

where width and height specify the width and height of the image in pixels, and imageType 
can be one of several constants that are defined in the BuFFeredlmage. The image type 
specifies how the color of each pixel is represented. The most likely value for imageType 
is Buf f eredlmage .TYPE_INT_RGB, which specifies that the color of each pixel is a usual 
RGB color, with red, green and blue components in the range to 255. The image type 
Buf f eredlmage . TYPE_INT_ARGB represents an RGB image with "transparency"; see the next 
section for more information on this. The image type Buf f eredlmage . TYPE_BYTE_GRAY can be 
used to create a grayscale image in which the only possible colors are shades of gray. 

To draw to a BuFFeredlmage, you need a graphics context that is set up to do its drawing on 
the image. If OSC is of type BuFFeredlmage, then the method 

OSC.getGraphicsO 

returns an object of type Graphics that can be used for drawing on the image. 

There are several reasons why a programmer might want to draw to an off-screen canvas. 
One is to simply keep a copy of an image that is shown on the screen. Remember that a picture 
that is drawn on a component can be lost, for example when the component is covered by 
another window. This means that you have to be able to redraw the picture on demand, and 
that in turn means keeping enough information around to enable you to redraw the picture. 
One way to do this is to keep a copy of the picture in an off-screen canvas. Whenever the on- 
screen picture needs to be redrawn, you just have to copy the contents of the off-screen canvas 
onto the screen. Essentially, the off-screen canvas allows you to save a copy of the color of every 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



654 



individual pixel in the picture. The sample program Paint WithOfTScreenCanvas.java is a little 
painting program that uses an off-screen canvas in this way. In this program, the user can draw 
curves, lines, and various shapes; a "Tool" menu allows the user to select the thing to be drawn. 
There is also an "Erase" tool and a "Smudge" tool that I will get to later. A BufFeredlmage is 
used to store the user's picture. When the user changes the picture, the changes are made to 
the image, and the changed image is then copied to the screen. No record is kept of the shapes 
that the user draws; the only record is the color of the individual pixels in the off-screen image. 
(You should contrast this with the program SimplePaint2.java in Subsection 7.3.4, where the 
user's drawing is recorded as a list of objects that represent the shapes that the user drew.) 

You should try the program (or the applet version in the on-line version of this section) . Try 
drawing a Filled Rectangle on top of some other shapes. As you drag the mouse, the rectangle 
stretches from the starting point of the mouse drag to the current mouse location. As the mouse 
moves, the underlying picture seems to be unaffected — parts of the picture can be covered up by 
the rectangle and later uncovered as the mouse moves, and they are still there. What this means 
is that the rectangle that is shown as you drag the mouse can't actually be part of the off-screen 
canvas, since drawing something into an image means changing the color of some pixels in the 
image. The previous colors of those pixels are not stored anywhere else and so are permanently 
lost. In fact, when you draw a line, rectangle, or oval in PaintWithOf f ScreenCanvas, the shape 
that is shown as you drag the mouse is not drawn to the off-screen canvas at all. Instead, the 
paintComponent () method draws the shape on top of the contents of the canvas. Only when 
you release the mouse does the shape become a permanent part of the off-screen canvas. This 
illustrates the point that when an off-screen canvas is used, not everything that is visible on the 
screen has to be drawn on the canvas. Some extra stuff can be drawn on top of the contents 
of the canvas by the paintComponent () method. The other tools are handled differently from 
the shape tools. For the curve, erase, and smudge tools, the changes are made to the canvas 
immediately, as the mouse is being dragged. 

Let's look at how an off-screen canvas is used in this program. The canvas is represented 
by an instance variable, OSC, of type BufFeredlmage. The size of the canvas must be the same 
size as the panel on which the canvas is displayed. The size can be determined by calling the 
getWidthQ and getHeightO instance methods of the panel. Furthermore, when the canvas is 
first created, it should be filled with the background color, which is represented in the program 
by an instance variable named f illColor. All this is done by the method: 

/** 

* This method creates the off-screen canvas and fills it with the current 

* fill color. 
*/ 

private void createOSCO { 

OSC = new Buf f eredlmage (getWidthO .getHeightO ,BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB) ; 
Graphics osg = OSC . getGraphics () ; 
osg. setColor (f illColor) ; 

osg.f illRect(0,0,getWidth() , getHeightO) ; 
osg.disposeO ; 

} 

Note how it uses OSC. getGraphics () to obtain a graphics context for drawing to the image. 
Also note that the graphics context is disposed at the end of the method. It is good practice 
to dispose a graphics context when you are finished with it. There still remains the problem 
of where to call this method. The problem is that the width and height of the panel object 
are not set until some time after the panel object is constructed. If createOSCO is called in 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



655 



the constructor, getWidthO and getHeightO will return the value zero and we won't get an 
off-screen image of the correct size. The approach that I take in PaintWithOf f ScreenCanvas 
is to call createOSCQ in the paintComponent () method, the first time the paintComponent () 
method is called. At that time, the size of the panel has definitely been set, but the user has 
not yet had a chance to draw anything. With this in mind you are ready to understand the 
paintComponent () method: 

public void paintComponent (Graphics g) { 

/* First create the off -screen canvas, if it does not already exist. */ 

if (OSC == null) 
createOSCQ ; 

/* Copy the off -screen canvas to the panel. Since we know that the 
image is already completely available, the fourth "ImageObserver" 
parameter to g.drawImageO can be null. Since the canvas completely 
fills the panel, there is no need to call super .paintComponent (g) . */ 

g.drawlmage (OSC, 0,0, null) ; 

/* If the user is currently dragging the mouse to draw a line, oval, 
or rectangle, draw the shape on top of the image from the off -screen 
canvas, using the current drawing color. (This is not done if the 
user is drawing a curve or using the smudge tool or the erase tool.) */ 

if (dragging && SHAPE_T00LS . contains (currentTool) ) { 
g. setColor (currentColor) ; 
putCurrentShape (g) ; 

> 

} 

Here, dragging is a boolean instance variable that is set to true while the user is dragging the 
mouse, and currentTool tells which tool is currently in use. The possible tools are defined by 
an enum named Tool, and SHAPE.TDOLS is a variable of type EnumSet< Tool> that contains the 
line, oval, rectangle, filled oval, and filled rectangle tools. (See Subsection 10.2.4.) 

You might notice that there is a problem if the size of the panel is ever changed, since the 
size of the off-screen canvas will not be changed to match. The PaintWithOf f ScreenCanvas 
program does not allow the user to resize the program's window, so this is not an issue in 
that program. If we want to allow resizing, however, a new off-screen canvas must be created 
whenever the size of the panel changes. One simple way to do this is to check the size of the 
canvas in the paintComponent () method and to create a new canvas if the size of the canvas 
does not match the size of the panel: 

if (OSC == null II getWidthO != OSC . getWidthO II getHeightO != OSC . getHeight () ) 
createOSCO ; 

Of course, this will discard the picture that was contained in the old canvas unless some ar- 
rangement is made to copy the picture from the old canvas to the new one before the old canvas 
is discarded. 

The other point in the program where the off-screen canvas is used is during a mouse-drag 
operation, which is handled in the mousePressedO , mouseDraggedQ , and mouseReleasedO 
methods. The strategy that is implemented was discussed above. Shapes are drawn to the off- 
screen canvas only at the end of the drag operation, in the mouseReleasedO method. However, 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



656 



as the user drags the mouse, the part of the image over which the shape appears is re-copied 
from the canvas onto the screen each time the mouse is moved. Then the paintComponent () 
method draws the shape that the user is creating on top of the image from the canvas. For 
the non-shape (curve and smudge) tools, on the other hand, changes are made directly to 
the canvas, and the region that was changed is repainted so that the change will appear on 
the screen. (By the way, the program uses a version of the repaint () method that repaints 
just a part of a component. The command repaint (x,y, width, height) tells the system to 
repaint the rectangle with upper left corner (x,y) and with the specified width and height. 
This can be substantially faster than repainting the entire component.) See the source code, 
Paint WithOffScreenCanvas.java, if you want to see how it's all done. 

* * * 

One traditional use of off-screen canvasses is for double buffering. In double-buffering, the 
off-screen image is an exact copy of the image that appears on screen; whenever the on-screen 
picture needs to be redrawn, the new picture is drawn step-by-step to an off-screen image. 
This can take some time. If all this drawing were done on screen, the user might see the image 
flicker as it is drawn. Instead, the long drawing process takes place off-screen and the completed 
image is then copied very quickly onto the screen. The user doesn't see all the steps involved 
in redrawing. This technique can be used to implement smooth, flicker-free animation. 

The term "double buffering" comes from the term "frame buffer," which refers to the re- 
gion in memory that holds the image on the screen. In fact, true double buffering uses two 
frame buffers. The video card can display either frame buffer on the screen and can switch 
instantaneously from one frame buffer to the other. One frame buffer is used to draw a new 
image for the screen. Then the video card is told to switch from one frame buffer to the other. 
No copying of memory is involved. Double-buffering as it is implemented in Java does require 
copying, which takes some time and is not perfectly flicker-free. 

In Java's older AWT graphical API, it was up to the programmer to do double buffering by 
hand. In the Swing graphical API, double buffering is applied automatically by the system, and 
the programmer doesn't have to worry about it. (It is possible to turn this automatic double 
buffering off in Swing, but there is seldom a good reason to do so.) 

One final historical note about off-screen canvasses: There is an alternative way to create 
them. The Component class defines the following instance method, which can be used in any 
GUI component object: 

public Image createlmage (int width, int height) 

This method creates an Image with a specified width and height. You can use this image 
as an off-screen canvas in the same way that you would a Bufferedlmage. In fact, you can 
expect that in a modern version of Java, the image that is returned by this method is in fact 
a BufFeredlmage. The createlmage () method was part of Java from the beginning, before the 
BufFeredlmage class was introduced. 

13.1.2 Working With Pixels 

One good reason to use a Bufferedlmage is that it allows easy access to the colors of individual 
pixels. If image is of type Bufferedlmage, then we have the methods: 

• image . getRGB (x , y) — returns an int that encodes the color of the pixel at coordinates 
(x , y) in the image. The values of the integers x and y must lie within the image. That is, 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



657 



it must be true that <= x < image .getWidthO and <= y < image . getHeight () ; 
if not, then an exception is thrown. 

• image . setRGB(x,y,rgb) — sets the color of the pixel at coordinates (x,y) to the color 
encoded by rgb. Again, x and y must be in the valid range. The third parameter, rgb, is 
an integer that encodes the color. 

These methods use integer codes for colors. If c is of type Color, the integer code for the color 
can be obtained by calling c.getRGBO. Conversely, if rgb is an integer that encodes a color, 
the corresponding Color object can be obtained with the constructor call new Color (rgb). 
This means that you can use 

Color c = new Color ( image. getRGB(x,y) ) 

to get the color of a pixel as a value of type Color. And if c is of type Color, you can set a pixel 
to that color with 

image . setRGB( x, y, c.getRGBO ); 

The red, green, and blue components of a color are represented as 8-bit integers, in the 
range to 255. When a color is encoded as a single int, the blue component is contained in 
the eight low-order bits of the int, the green component in the next lowest eight bits, and the 
red component in the next eight bits. (The eight high order bits store the "alpha component" 
of the color, which we'll encounter in the next section.) It is easy to translate between the two 
representations using the shift operators « and » and the bitwise logical operators & 
and I . (I have not covered these operators previously in this book. Briefly: If A and B are 
integers, then A « B is the integer obtained by shifting each bit of A, B bit positions to the 
left; A >> B is the integer obtained by shifting each bit of A, B bit positions to the right; A & B 
is the integer obtained by applying the logical and operation to each pair of bits in A and 
B; and A | B is obtained similarly, using the logical or operation. For example, using 8-bit 
binary numbers, we have: 01100101 & 10100001 is 00100001, while 01100101 | 10100001 is 
11100101.) You don't necessarily need to understand these operators. Here are incantations 
that you can use to work with color codes: 

/* Suppose that rgb is an int that encodes a color. 

To get separate red, green, and blue color components: */ 

int red = (rgb » 16) & OxFF; 
int green = (rgb » 8) & OxFF; 
int blue = rgb & OxFF; 

/* Suppose that red, green, and blue are color components in 
the range to 255. To combine them into a single int: */ 

int rgb = (red « 16) I (green « 8) I blue; 

* * * 

An example of using pixel colors in a Bufferedlmage is provided by the smudge tool in 
the sample program Paint WithOffScreenCanvas.java. The purpose of this tool is to smear the 
colors of an image, as if it were drawn in wet paint. For example, if you rub the middle of a 
black rectangle with the smudge tool, you'll get something like this: 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



658 



i 




This is an effect that can only be achieved by manipulating the colors of individual pixels! Here's 
how it works: when the user presses the mouse using the smudge tool, the color components 
of a 7-by-7 block of pixels are copied from the off-screen canvas into arrays named smudgeRed, 
smudgeGreen and smudgeBlue. This is done in the mousePressedO routine with the following 
code: 

int w = DSC.getWidthO ; 

int h = OSC.getHeightO ; 

int x = evt.getXO; 

int y = evt.getYO; 

for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++) 

for (int j = 0; j < 7; j++) { 

int r = y + j - 3; 

int c = x + i - 3 ; 

if (r < II r >= h II c < II c >= w) { 

// A -1 in the smudgeRed array indicates that the 
// corresponding pixel was outside the canvas. 
smudgeRed [i] [j] = -1; 

} 

else { 

int color = 0SC.getRGB(c,r) ; 
smudgeRed[i] [j] = (color » 16) & OxFF; 
smudgeGreen [i] [j] = (color >> 8) & OxFF; 
smudgeBlue [i] [j] = color & OxFF; 

} 

} 

The arrays are of type double[][] because I am going to do some computations with them that 
require real numbers. As the user moves the mouse, the colors in the array are blended with 
the colors in the image, just as if you were mixing wet paint by smudging it with your finger. 
That is, the colors at the new mouse position in the image are replaced with a weighted average 
of the current colors in the image and the colors in the arrays. This has the effect of moving 
some of the color from the previous mouse position to the new mouse position. At the same 
time, the colors in the arrays are replaced by a weighted average of the old colors in the arrays 
and the colors from the image. This has the effect of moving some color from the image into 
the arrays. This is done using the following code for each pixel position, (c,r), in a 7-by-7 
block around the new mouse location: 

int curCol = 0SC.getRGB(c,r) ; 

int curRed = (curCol » 16) & OxFF; 

int curGreen = (curCol >> 8) & OxFF; 

int curBlue = curCol & OxFF; 

int newRed = (int) (curRed*0 . 7 + smudgeRed [i] [j] *0 . 3) ; 

int newGreen = (int) (curGreen*0 . 7 + smudgeGreen [i] [j] *0 . 3) ; 

int newBlue = (int) (curBlue*0 . 7 + smudgeBlue [i] [j] *0 . 3) ; 

int newCol = newRed << 16 I newGreen << 8 I newBlue; 
OSC.setRGB(c,r,newCol) ; 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



659 



smudgeRed[i] [j] = curRed*0.3 + smudgeRed [i] [j] *0.7; 
smudgeGreen [i] [j] = curGreen*0 . 3 + smudgeGreen [i] [j] *0.7; 
smudgeBlue [i] [j] = curBlue*0.3 + smudgeBlue [i] [j] *0 . 7; 

13.1.3 Resources 

Throughout this textbook, up until now, we have been thinking of a program as made up 
entirely of Java code. However, programs often use other types of data, including images, 
sounds, and text, as part of their basic structure. These data are referred to as resources. An 
example is the image file, cards. png, that was used in the HighLowWithlmages.java program 
earlier in this section. This file is part of the program. The program needs it in order to run. 
The user of the program doesn't need to know that this file exists or where it is located; as far 
as the user is concerned, it is just part of the program. The program of course, does need some 
way of locating the resource file and loading its data. 

Resources are ordinarily stored in files that are in the same locations as the compiled class 
files for the program. Class files are located and loaded by something called a class loader, 
which is represented in Java by an object of type ClassLoader. A class loader has a list of 
locations where it will look for class files. This list is called the class path. It includes the 
location where Java's standard classes are stored. It generally includes the current directory. 
If the program is stored in a jar file, the jar file is included on the class path. In addition to 
class files, a ClassLoader is capable of finding resource files that are located on the class path 
or in subdirectories of locations that are on the class path. 

The first step in using a resource is to obtain a ClassLoader and to use it to locate the 
resource file. In the HighLowWithlmages program, this is done with: 

ClassLoader cl = HighLowWithlmages . class . getClassLoader () ; 
URL imageURL = cl. getResource(" cards. png" ) ; 

The idea of the first line is that in order to get a class loader, you have to ask a class 
that was loaded by the class loader. Here, HighLowWithlmages . class is a name for the 
object that represents the actual class, HighLowWithlmages. In other programs, you would 
just substitute for "HighLowWithlmages" the name of the class that contains the call to 
getClassLoader () . Alternatively, if obj is any object, then you can obtain a class loader 
by calling obj .getClassQ . getClassLoader () . 

The second line in the above code uses the class loader to locate the resource file named 
cards, png. The return value of cl.getResourceO is of type java.net .URL, and it represents 
the location of the resource rather than the resource itself. If the resource file cannot be found, 
then the return value is null. The class URL was discussed in Subsection 11.4.1. 

Often, resources are stored not directly on the class path but in a subdirectory. In that 
case, the parameter to getResourceO must be a path name that includes the directory path 
to the resource. For example, suppose that the image file "cards. png" were stored in a directory 
named images inside a directory named resources, where resources is directly on the class 
path. Then the path to the file is "resources/images/cards.png" and the command for locating 
the resource would be 

URL imageURL = cl. getResource( "resources/images/cards. png" ) ; 

Once you have a URL that represents the location of a resource file, you could use a URL- 
Connection, as discussed in Subsection 11.4.1, to read the contents of that file. However, Java 
provides more convenient methods for loading several types of resources. For loading image 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



660 



resources, a convenient method is available in the class java. awt . Toolkit. It can be used as 
in the following line from HighLowWithlmages, where cardlmages is an instance variable of 
type Image and imageURL is the URL that represents the location of the image file: 

cardlmages = Toolkit. getDef aultToolkit () . createlmage (imageURL) ; 

This still does not load the image completely — that will only be done later, for example when 
cardlmages is used in a drawlmage command. Another technique, which does read the image 
completely, is to use the ImagelO . read() method, which will be discussed in Subsection 13.1.5 

* * * 

The Applet and JApplet classes have an instance method that can be used to load an image 
from a given URL: 

public Image getImage(URL imageURL) 

When you are writing an applet, this method can be used as yet another technique for loading 
an image resource. 

More interesting is the fact that Applet and JApplet contain a static method that can be 
used to load sound resources: 

public static AudioClip newAudioClip(URL soundURL) 

Since this is a static method, it can be used in any program, not just in applets, simply by 
calling it as Applet .newAudioClip (soundURL) or JApplet. newAudioClip (soundURL). (This 
seems to be the only easy way to use sounds in a Java program; it's not clear why this capability 
is only in the applet classes.) The return value is of type java. applet . AudioClip. Once you 
have an AudioClip, you can call its playO method to play the audio clip from the beginning. 

Here is a method that puts all this together to load and play the sound from an audio 
resource file: 

private void playAudioResource (String audioResourceName) { 

ClassLoader cl = SoundAndCursorDemo. class. getClassLoader () ; 
URL resourceURL = cl . getResource (audioResourceName) ; 
if (resourceURL != null) { 

AudioClip sound = JApplet .newAudioClip (resourceURL) ; 

sound. play () ; 

} 

} 

This method is from a sample program SoundAndCursorDemo that will be discussed in the next 
subsection. Of course, if you plan to reuse the sound often, it would be better to load the sound 
once into an instance variable of type AudioClip, which could then be used to play the sound 
any number of times, without the need to reload it each time. 

The AudioClip class supports audio files in the common WAV, AIFF, and AU formats. 

13.1.4 Cursors and Icons 

The position of the mouse is represented on the computer's screen by a small image called a 
cursor. In Java, the cursor is represented by an object of type java. awt . Cursor. A Cursor 
has an associated image. It also has a hot spot, which is a Point that specifies the pixel within 
the image that corresponds to the exact position on the screen where the mouse is pointing. 
For example, for a typical "arrow" cursor, the hot spot is the tip of the arrow. For a "crosshair" 
cursor, the hot spot is the center of the crosshairs. 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



661 



The Cursor class defines several standard cursors, which are identified by constants such 
as Cursor . CROSSHAIR_CURSOR and Cursor . DEFAULT .CURSOR. You can get a standard cursor by 
calling the static method Cursor. getPredef inedCursor (code), where code is one of the 
constants that identify the standard cursors. It is also possible to create a custom cursor from 
an Image. The Image might be obtained as an image resource, as described in the previous 
subsection. It could even be a Bufferedlmage that you create in your program. It should be 
small, maybe 16-by-16 or 24-by-24 pixels. (Some platforms might only be able to handle certain 
cursor sizes; see the documentation for Toolkit . getBestCursorSize () for more information.) 
A custom cursor can be created by calling the static method createCustomCursor () in the 
Toolkit class: 

Cursor c = Toolkit . getDef aultToolkit (). createCustomCursor (image , hotSpot , name) ; 

where hotSpot is of type Point and name is a String that will act as a name for the cursor (and 
which serves no real purpose that I know of). 

Cursors are associated with GUI components. When the mouse moves over a component, 
the cursor changes to whatever Cursor is associated with that component. To associate a Cursor 
with a component, call the component's instance method setCursor (cursor) . For example, 
to set the cursor for a JPanel, panel, to be the standard "wait" cursor: 

panel. setCursor ( Cursor .getPredef inedCursor (Cursor .WAIT_CURSOR) ) ; 

To reset the cursor to be the default cursor, you can use: 

panel . setCursor ( Cursor .getDef aultCursorO ); 

To set the cursor to be an image that is defined in an image resource file named imageRe source, 
you might use: 

ClassLoader cl = SoundAndCursorDemo . class .getClassLoaderO ; 
URL resourceURL = cl . getResource (imageResource) ; 
if (resourceURL != null) { 

Toolkit toolkit = Toolkit .getDef aultToolkit () ; 

Image image = toolkit . createlmage (resourceURL) ; 

Point hotSpot = new Point (7, 7); 

Cursor cursor = toolkit . createCustomCursor (image , hotSpot, "mycursor"); 
panel . setCursor (cursor) ; 

} 

The sample program SoundAndCursorDemo.java shows how to use predefined and custom 
cursors and how to play sounds from resource files. The program has several buttons that you 
can click. Some of the buttons change the cursor that is associated with the main panel of the 
program. Some of the buttons play sounds. When you play a sound, the cursor is reset to be 
the default cursor. You can find an applet version of the program in the on-line version of this 
section. 

Another standard use of images in GUI interfaces is for icons. An icon is simply a small 
picture. As we'll see in Section 13.3, icons can be used on Java's buttons, menu items, and 
labels; in fact, for our purposes, an icon is simply an image that can be used in this way. 

An icon is represented by an object of type Icon, which is actually an interface rather than 
a class. The class Imagelcon, which implements the Icon interface, is used to create icons from 
Images. If image is a (rather small) Image, then the constructor call new Image I con (image) 
creates an Imagelcon whose picture is the specified image. Often, the image comes from a 
resource file. We will see examples of this later in this chapter 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



662 



13.1.5 Image File I/O 

The class javax. imageio . Image 10 makes it easy to save images from a program into files 
and to read images from files into a program. This would be useful in a program such as 
PaintWithOf f ScreenCanvas, so that the users would be able to save their work and to open 
and edit existing images. (See Exercise 13.1.) 

There are many ways that the data for an image could be stored in a file. Many standard 
formats have been created for doing this. Java supports at least three standard image formats: 
PNG, JPEG, and GIF. (Individual implementations of Java might support more.) The JPEG 
format is "lossy," which means that the picture that you get when you read a JPEG file is 
only an approximation of the picture that was saved. Some information in the picture has been 
lost. Allowing some information to be lost makes it possible to compress the image into a lot 
fewer bits than would otherwise be necessary. Usually, the approximation is quite good. It 
works best for photographic images and worst for simple line drawings. The PNG format, on 
the other hand is "lossless," meaning that the picture in the file is an exact duplicate of the 
picture that was saved. A PNG file is compressed, but not in a way that loses information. The 
compression works best for images made up mostly of large blocks of uniform color; it works 
worst for photographic images. GIF is an older format that is limited to just 256 colors in an 
image; it has mostly been superseded by PNG. 

Suppose that image is a Bufferedlmage. The image can be saved to a file simply by calling 

ImagelO. write ( image, format, file ) 

where format is a String that specifies the image format of the file and file is a File that 
specifies the file that is to be written. (See Subsection 11.2.2 for information about the File 
class.) The format string should ordinarily be either "PNG" or "JPEG", although other formats 
might be supported. 

ImagelO .write () is a static method in the ImagelO class. It returns a boolean value 
that is false if the image format is not supported. That is, if the specified image format is 
not supported, then the image is not saved, but no exception is thrown. This means that you 
should always check the return value! For example: 

boolean hasFormat = ImagelO .write (OSC, format , selectedFile) ; 
if ( ! hasFormat ) 

throw new Exception(f ormat + " format is not available."); 

If the image format is recognized, it is still possible that an lOException might be thrown when 
the attempt is made to send the data to the file. 

Usually, the file to be used in ImagelO. write () will be selected by the user using a J File- 
Chooser, as discussed in Subsection 11.2.3. For example, here is a typical method for saving an 
image. (The use of "this" as a parameter in several places assumes that this method is defined 
in a subclass of JComponent.) 

/** 

* Attempts to save an image to a file selected by the user. 

* Oparam image the Bufferedlmage to be saved to the file 

* Oparam format the format of the image, probably either "PNG" or "JPEG" 
*/ 

private void doSaveFile(Buf f eredlmage image, String format) { 
if (fileDialog == null) 

fileDialog = new JFileChooser () ; 
fileDialog. setSelectedFile (new FileC'image . " + f ormat .toLowerCase ())) ; 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



663 



f ileDialog. setDialogTitleO'Select File to be Saved"); 
int option = f ileDialog. showSaveDialog(this) ; 
if (option != JFileChooser . APPROVEJDPTION) 

return; // User canceled or clicked the dialog's close box. 
File selectedFile = f ileDialog. getSelectedFile () ; 

if (selectedFile . exists () ) { // Ask the user whether to replace the file, 
int response = JOptionPane . showConf irmDialog( null, 
"The file \"" + selectedFile. getNameO 
+ "\" already exists. \nDo you want to replace it?", 
"Confirm Save" , 
JOptionPane . YES_N0_0PTI0N , 
JOptionPane . WARNING_MESSAGE ); 
if (response != JOptionPane .YESJDPTION) 

return; // User does not want to replace the file. 

} 

try { 

boolean hasFormat = ImagelO. write (image, format, selectedFile) ; 
if ( ! hasFormat ) 

throw new Exception(f ormat + " format is not available."); 

> 

catch (Exception e) { 

JOptionPane . showMessageDialog(this , 

"Sorry, an error occurred while trying to save image.")); 
e .printStackTraceO ; 

} 

} 

* * * 

The ImagelO class also has a static read() method for reading an image from a file into 
a program. The method 

ImagelO . read ( inputFile ) 

takes a variable of type File as a parameter and returns a Buffered I mage. The return value 
is null if the file does not contain an image that is stored in a supported format. Again, no 
exception is thrown in this case, so you should always be careful to check the return value. It 
is also possible for an lOException to occur when the attempt is made to read the file. There 
is another version of the read() method that takes an InputStream instead of a file as its 
parameter, and a third version that takes a URL. 

Earlier in this section, we encountered another method for reading an image from a URL, 
the createlmage () method from the Toolkit class. The difference is that ImagelO . read () 
reads the image data completely and stores the result in a Buffered I mage. On the other hand, 
createlmage () does not actually read the data; it really just stores the image location and 
the data won't be read until later, when the image is used. This has the advantage that the 
createlmageO method itself can complete very quickly. ImagelO . read () , on the other hand, 
can take some time to execute. 

13.2 Fancier Graphics 



The graphics commands provided by the Graphics class are sufficient for many purposes. (online) 
However, recent versions of Java provide a much larger and richer graphical toolbox in the form 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



664 



of the class java.awt.Graphics2D. I mentioned Graphics2D in Subsection 6.3.5 and promised 
to discuss it further in this chapter. 

Graphics2D is a subclass of Graphics, so all of the graphics commands that you already 
know can be used with a Graphics2D object. In fact, when you obtain a Graphics context 
for drawing on a Swing component or on a Bufferedlmage, the graphics object is actually of 
type Graphics2D and can be type-cast to gain access to the advanced Graphics2D graphics 
commands. Furthermore, BufFeredlmage has an instance method, createGraphics () , that 
returns a graphics context of type Graphics2D. For example, if image is of type BufFeredlmage, 
then you can get a Graphics2D for drawing on the image using: 

Graphics2D g2 = image . createGraphics () ; 

And, as mentioned in Subsection 6.3.5, to use Graphics2D commands in the paintComponent () 
method of a Swing component, you can write a paintComponent () method of the form: 

public void paintComponent (Graphics g) { 
super .paintComponent (g) ; 
Graphics g2 = (Graphics2D)g; 

// Draw to the component using g2 (and g) . 

} 

Note that when you do this, g and g2 are just two variables that refer to the same object, 
so they both draw to the same drawing surface; g2 just gives you access to methods that are 
defined in Graphics2D but not in Graphics. When properties of g2, such as drawing color, are 
changed, the changes also apply to g. By saying 

Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)g. create () 

you can obtain a newly created graphics context. The object created by g. create () is a 
graphics context that draws to the same drawing surface as g and that initially has all the same 
properties as g. However, it is a separate object, so that changing properties in g2 has no effect 
on g. This can be useful if you want to keep an unmodified copy of the original graphics context 
around for some drawing operations. (In this case, it is good practice to call g2. dispose () to 
dispose of the new graphics context when you are finished using it.) 

13.2.1 Measuring Text 

Although this section is mostly about Graphics2D, we start with a topic that has nothing to do 
with it. 

Often, when drawing a string, it's important to know how big the image of the string will 
be. For example, you need this information if you want to center a string in a component. Or 
if you want to know how much space to leave between two lines of text, when you draw them 
one above the other. Or if the user is typing the string and you want to position a cursor at the 
end of the string. In Java, questions about the size of a string can be answered by an object 
belonging to the standard class java. awt . FontMetrics. 

There are several lengths associated with any given font. Some of them are shown in this 
illustration: 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



665 



Descent 
Leading 



Ascent 




Measuring 




Strings 



Lineheight 



The dashed lines in the illustration are the baselines of the two lines of text. The baseline 
of a string is the line on which the bases of the characters rest. The suggested distance between 
two baselines, for single-spaced text, is known as the lineheight of the font. The ascent is 
the distance that tall characters can rise above the baseline, and the descent is the distance 
that tails like the one on the letter "g" can descend below the baseline. The ascent and descent 
do not add up to the lineheight, because there should be some extra space between the tops of 
characters in one line and the tails of characters on the line above. The extra space is called 
leading. (The term comes from the time when lead blocks were used for printing. Characters 
were formed on blocks of lead that were lined up to make up the text of a page, covered with 
ink, and pressed onto paper to print the page. Extra, blank "leading" was used to separate the 
lines of characters.) All these quantities can be determined by calling instance methods in a 
FontMetrics object. There are also methods for determining the width of a character and the 
total width of a string of characters. 

Recall that a font in Java is represented by the class Font. A FontMetrics object is asso- 
ciated with a given font and is used to measure characters and strings in that font. If font 
is of type Font and g is a graphics context, you can get a FontMetrics object for the font 
by calling g.getFontMetrics(f ont) . If fm is the variable that refers to the FontMetrics ob- 
ject, then the ascent, descent, leading, and lineheight of the font can be obtained by calling 
fm. get As cent (), fm.getDescentO, fm. getLeadingO , and fm. getHeight () . If ch is a char- 
acter, then fm. charWidth(ch) is the width of the character when it is drawn in that font. If 
str is a string, then fm. stringWidth(str) is the width of the string when drawn in that font. 
For example, here is a paintComponent () method that shows the message "Hello World" in 
the exact center of the component: 

public void paintComponent (Graphics g) { 



centerX = getWidthO / 2; 
centerY = getHeight () / 2; 

Font font = g.getFontO; // What font will g draw in? 
FontMetrics fm = g.getFontMetrics(f ont) ; 
strWidth = fm. stringWidth( "Hello World"); 

strHeight = fm.getAscentO ; // Note: There are no tails on 



super .paintComponent (g) ; 



int strWidth, strHeight; 

int centerX, centerY; 

int baseX, baseY; 

int topOfString; 



// Width and height of the string. 
// Coordinates of the center of the component. 
// Coordinates of the basepoint of the string. 
// y-coordinate of the top of the string. 



// any of the chars in the string! 



baseX = centerX - (strWidth/2) ; // Move back from center by half the 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



666 



// width of the string. 

topOf String = centerY - (strHeight/2) ; // Move up from center by half 

/ / the height of the string . 

baseY = topOfString + fm.getAscentO ; // Baseline is f m. getAscent () pixels 

// below the top of the string. 

g.drawString( "Hello World", baseX, baseY); // Draw the string. 

} 

You can change the font that is used for drawing strings as described in Subsection 6.3.3. For 
the height of the string in this method, I use fm.getAscentO. If I were drawing "Goodbye 
World" instead of "Hello World," I would have used fm.getAscentO + fm.getDescentO, 
where the descent is added to the height in order to take into account the tail on the "y" in 
"Goodbye" . The value of baseX is computed to be the amount of space between the left edge 
of the component and the start of the string. It is obtained by subtracting half the width of the 
string from the horizontal center of the component. This will center the string horizontally in 
the component. The next line computes the position of the top of the string in the same way. 
However, to draw the string, we need the y-coordinate of the baseline, not the y-coordinate of 
the top of the string. The baseline of the string is below the top of the string by an amount 
equal to the ascent of the font. 

There is an example of centering a two-line block of text in the sample program 
TransparencyDemo.java, which is discussed in the next subsection. 



13.2.2 Transparency 

A color is represented by red, blue, and green components. In Java's usual representation, each 
component is an eight-bit number in the range to 255. The three color components can be 
packed into a 32-bit integer, but that only accounts for 24 bits in the integer. What about the 
other eight bits? They don't have to be wasted. They can be used as a fourth component of 
the color, the alpha component. The alpha component can be used in several ways, but it 
is most commonly associated with transparency. When you draw with a transparent color, 
it's like laying down a sheet of colored glass. It doesn't completely obscure the part of the 
image that is colored over. Instead, the background image is blended with the transparent 
color that is used for drawing — as if you were looking at the background through colored glass. 
This type of drawing is properly referred to as alpha blending, and it is not equivalent to true 
transparency; nevertheless, most people refer to it as transparency. 

The value of the alpha component determines how transparent that color is. Actually, the 
alpha component gives the opaqueness of the color. Opaqueness is the opposite of trans- 
parency. If something is fully opaque, you can't see through it at all; if something is almost 
fully opaque, then it is just a little transparent; and so on. When the alpha component of a 
color has the maximum possible value, the color is fully opaque. When you draw with a fully 
opaque color, that color simply replaces the color of the background over which you draw. This 
is the only type of color that we have used up until now. If the alpha component of a color is 
zero, then the color is perfectly transparent, and drawing with that color has no effect at all. 
Intermediate values of the alpha component give partially opaque colors that will blend with 
the background when they are used for drawing. 

The sample program TransparencyDemo.java can help you to understand transparency. 
When you run the program you will see a display area containing a triangle, an oval, a rect- 
angle, and some text. Sliders at the bottom of the applet allow you to control the degree of 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



667 



transparency of each shape. When a slider is moved all the way to the right, the corresponding 
shape is fully opaque; all the way to the left, and the shape is fully transparent. An applet 
version of the program can be found in the on-line version of this section. 

* * * 

Colors with alpha components were introduced in Java along with Graphics2D, but they can 
be used with ordinary Graphics objects as well. To specify the alpha component of a color, you 
can create the Color object using one of the following constructors from the Color class: 

public Color(int red, int green, int blue, int alpha); 

public Color(float red, float green, float blue, float alpha); 

In the first constructor, all the parameters must be integers in the range to 255. In the second, 
the parameters must be in the range 0.0 to 1.0. For example, 

Color transparentRed = new Color ( 255, 0, 0, 200 ); 

makes a slightly transparent red, while 

Color tranparentCyan = new Color ( 0.0F, 1.0F, 1.0F, 0.5F); 

makes a blue-green color that is 50% opaque. (The advantage of the constructor that takes 
parameters of type float is that it lets you think in terms of percentages.) When you create an 
ordinary RGB color, as in new Color (255, 0,0), you just get a fully opaque color. 

Once you have a transparent color, you can use it in the same way as any other color. That 
is, if you want to use a Color c to draw in a graphics context g, you just say g. setColor(c) , 
and subsequent drawing operations will use that color. As you can see, transparent colors are 
very easy to use. 

* * * 

A Buffered I mage with image type Buf f eredlmage . TYPE_INT_ARGB can use transparency. 
The color of each pixel in the image can have its own alpha component, which tells how 
transparent that pixel will be when the image is drawn over some background. A pixel whose 
alpha component is zero is perfectly transparent, and has no effect at all when the image is 
drawn; in effect, it's not part of the image at all. It is also possible for pixels to be partly 
transparent. When an image is saved to a file, information about transparency might be lost, 
depending on the file format. The PNG image format supports transparency; JPEG does not. 
(If you look at the images of playing cards that are used in the program HighLowWithlmages in 
Subsection 13.1.1, you might notice that the tips of the corners of the cards are fully transparent. 
The card images are from a PNG file, cards. png.) 

An ARGB Bufferedlmage should be fully transparent when it is first created, but if you want 
to make sure, here is one way of doing so: The Graphics2D class has a method setBackgroundO 
that can be used to set a background color for the graphics context, and it has a clearRectO 
method that fills a rectangle with the current background color. To create a fully transparent 
image with width w and height h, you can use: 

Bufferedlmage image = new Buf f eredlmage (w, h, Buf f eredlmage . TYPE_INT_ARGB) ; 
Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) image. getGraphics () ; 

g2 . setBackground(new Color (0, 0, 0, 0) ) ; // (The R, G, and B values don't matter.) 
g2 . clearRect (0 , 0, w, h) ; 

(Note that simply drawing with a transparent color will not make pixels in the image transpar- 
ent. The alpha component of a Color makes the color transparent when it is used for drawing; 
it does not change the transparency of the pixels that are modified by the drawing operation.)

As an example, just for fun, here is a method that will set the cursor of a component to be 
a red square with a transparent interior: 

private void useRedSquareCursor () { 

Buf f eredlmage image = new Buffer edlmage (24 , 24 , Buffer edlmage . TYPE_INT_ARGB) ; 
Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) image . getGraphics () ; 
g2 . setBackground (new Color (0 , 0,0,0)) ; 

g2 . clearRect (0 , 0, 24, 24); // (should not be necessary in a new image) 
g2.setColor(Color.RED) ; 
g2 . drawRect (0 , , 23 , 23) ; 
g2.drawRect(l, 1,21,21) ; 
g2 . dispose () ; 

Point hotSpot = new Point (12, 12) ; 
Toolkit tk = Toolkit . getDef aultToolkit () ; 

Cursor cursor = tk.createCustomCursor(image,hotSpot, "square") ; 
setCursor (cursor) ; 

} 

13.2.3 Antialiasing 

To draw a geometric figure such as a line or circle, you just have to color the pixels that are part 
of the figure, right? Actually, there is a problem with this. Pixels are little squares. Geometric 
figures, on the other hand, are made of geometric points that have no size at all. Think about 
drawing a circle, and think about a pixel on the boundary of that circle. The infinitely thin 
geometric boundary of the circle cuts through the pixel. Part of the pixel lies inside the circle, 
part lies outside. So, when we are filling the circle with color, do we color that pixel or not? 
A possible solution is to color the pixel if the geometric circle covers 50% or more of the pixel. 
Following this procedure, however, leads to a visual defect known as aliasing. It is visible in 
images as a jaggedness or "staircasing" effect along the borders of curved shapes. Lines that are 
not horizontal or vertical also have a jagged, aliased appearance. (The term "aliasing" seems 
to refer to the fact that many different geometric points map to the same pixel. If you think of 
the real-number coordinates of a geometric point as a "name" for the pixel that contains that 
point, then each pixel has many different names or "aliases.") 

It's not possible to build a circle out of squares, but there is a technique that can eliminate 
some of the jaggedness of aliased images. The technique is called antialiasing. Antialiasing is 
based on transparency. The idea is simple: If 50% of a pixel is covered by the geometric figure 
that you are trying to draw, then color that pixel with a color that is 50% transparent. If 25% 
of the pixel is covered, use a color that is 75% transparent (25% opaque). If the entire pixel 
is covered by the figure, of course, use a color that is 100% opaque — antialiasing only affects 
pixels that are only partly covered by the geometric shape. 

In antialiasing, the color that you are drawing with is blended with the original color of the 
pixel, and the amount of blending depends on the fraction of the pixel that is covered by the 
geometric shape. (The fraction is difficult to compute exactly, so in practice, various methods 
are used to approximate it.) Of course, you still don't get a picture of the exact geometric 
shape, but antialiased images do tend to look better than jagged, aliased images. 

For an example, look at the image in the next subsection. Antialiasing is used to draw 
the panels in the second and third row of the image, but it is not used in the top row. You 
should note the jagged appearance of the lines and rectangles in the top row. (By the way, 
when antialiasing is applied to a line, the line is treated as a geometric rectangle whose width 
is equal to the size of one pixel.) 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



669 



Antialiasing is supported in Graphics2D. By default, antialiasing is turned off. If g2 is a 
graphics context of type Graphics2D, you can turn on antialiasing in g2 by saying: 

g2 . setRenderingHint (RenderingHints . KEY .ANTIALIASING , 

RenderingHints . VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON) ; 

As you can see, this is only a "hint" that you would like to use antialiasing, and it is even 
possible that the hint will be ignored. However, it is likely that subsequent drawing operations 
in g2 will be antialiased. If you want to turn antialiasing off in g2, you should say: 

g2 . setRenderingHint (RenderingHints . KEY -ANTIALIASING , 

RenderingHints . VALUE_ANTIALIAS_OFF) ; 

13.2.4 Strokes and Paints 

When using the Graphics class, any line that you draw will be a solid line that is one pixel thick. 
The Graphics2D class makes it possible to draw a much greater variety of lines. You can draw 
lines of any thickness, and you can draw lines that are dotted or dashed instead of solid. 

An object of type Stroke contains information about how lines should be drawn, including 
how thick the line should be and what pattern of dashes and dots, if any, should be used. Every 
Graphics2D has an associated Stroke object. The default Stroke draws a solid line of thickness 
one. To get lines with different properties, you just have to install a different stroke into the 
graphics context. 

Stroke is an interface, not a class. The class BasicStroke, which implements the Stroke 
interface, is the one that is actually used to create stroke objects. For example, to create a 
stroke that draws solid lines with thickness equal to 3, use: 

BasicStroke line3 = new BasicStroke (3) ; 

If g2 is of type Graphics2D, the stroke can be installed in g2 by calling its setStrokeO com- 
mand: 

g2 . setStroke (line3) 

After calling this method, subsequent drawing operations will use lines that are three times as 
wide as the usual thickness. The thickness of a line can be given by a value of type float, not 
just by an int. For example, to use lines of thickness 2.5 in the graphics context g2, you can 
say: 

g2 . setStroke ( new BasicStroke (2 . 5F) ); 

(Fractional widths make more sense if antialiasing is turned on.) 

When you have a thick line, the question comes up, what to do at the ends of the line. If 
you draw a physical line with a large, round piece of chalk, the ends of the line will be rounded. 
When you draw a line on the computer screen, should the ends be rounded, or should the line 
simply be cut off flat? With the BasicStroke class, the choice is up to you. Maybe it's time to 
look at examples. This illustration shows fifteen lines, drawn using different BasicStrokes. Lines 
in the middle row have rounded ends; lines in the other two rows are simply cut off at their 
endpoints. Lines of various thicknesses are shown, and the bottom row shows dashed lines. 
(And, as mentioned above, only the bottom two rows are antialiased.) 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



670 




This illustration shows the sample program StrokeDemo.java. (You can try an applet version 
of the program in the on-line version of this section.) In this program, you can click and drag 
in any of the small panels, and the lines in all the panels will be redrawn as you move the 
mouse. In addition, if you right-click and drag, then rectangles will be drawn instead of lines; 
this shows that strokes are used for drawing the outlines of shapes and not just for straight 
lines. If you look at the corners of the rectangles that are drawn by the program, you'll see 
that there are several ways of drawing a corner where two wide line segments meet. 

All the options that you want for a BasicStroke have to be specified in the constructor. Once 
the stroke object is created, there is no way to change the options. There is one constructor 
that lets you specify all possible options: 

public BasicStroke ( float width, int capType, int joinType, float miterlimit , 

f loat [] dashPattern, float dashPhase ) 

I don't want to cover all the options in detail, but here's some basic info: 

• width specifies the thickness of the line 

• capType specifies how the ends of a line are "capped." The possible values are 
BasicStroke. CAP.SQUARE, BasicStroke . CAP_R0UND and BasicStroke . CAP_BUTT. These 
values are used, respectively, in the first, second, and third rows of the above picture. The 
default is BasicStroke . CAP.SQUARE. 

• joinType specifies how two line segments are joined together at corners. Possible values 
are BasicStroke . J0IN_MITER, BasicStroke . J0IN_R0UND, and BasicStroke . J0IN_BEVEL. 
Again, these are used in the three rows of panels in the sample program; the effect is only 
seen in the applet when drawing rectangles. The default is BasicStroke . JOIN_MITER. 

• miterLimit is used only if the value of joinType is J0IN_MITER; just use the default value, 
10. OF. 

• dashPattern is used to specify dotted and dashed lines. The values in the array specify 
lengths in the dot/dash pattern. The numbers in the array represent the length of a solid 
piece, followed by the length of a transparent piece, followed by the length of a solid piece, 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



671 



and so on. At the end of the array, the pattern wraps back to the beginning of the array. 
If you want a solid line, use a different constructor that has fewer parameters. 

• dashPhase tells the computer where to start in the dashPattern array, for the first seg- 
ment of the line. Use for this parameter in most cases. 

For the third row in the above picture, the dashPattern is set to new float [] {5,5}. This 
means that the lines are drawn starting with a solid segment of length 5, followed by a transpar- 
ent section of length 5, and then repeating the same pattern. A simple dotted line would have 
thickness 1 and dashPattern new float [] {1 , 1}. A pattern of short and long dashes could be 
made by using new float [] {10,4,4,4}. For more information, see the Java documentation, 
or try experimenting with the source code for the sample program. 

* * * 

So now we can draw fancier lines. But any drawing operation is still restricted to drawing 
with a single color. We can get around that restriction by using Paint. An object of type Paint 
is used to assign color to each pixel that is "hit" by a drawing operation. Paint is an interface, 
and the Color class implements the Paint interface. When a color is used for painting, it applies 
the same color to every pixel that is hit. However, there are other types of paint where the color 
that is applied to a pixel depends on the coordinates of that pixel. Standard Java includes two 
classes that define paint with this property: GradientPaint and TexturePaint. In a gradient, the 
color that is applied to pixels changes gradually from one color to a second color as you move 
from point to point. In a texture, the pixel colors come from an image, which is repeated, if 
necessary, like a wallpaper pattern to cover the entire xy-plane. 

It will be helpful to look at some examples. This illustration shows a polygon filled with 
two different paints. The polygon on the left uses a GradientPaint while the one on the right 
uses a TexturePaint. Note that in this picture, the paint is used only for filling the polygon. 
The outline of the polygon is drawn in a plain black color. However, Paint objects can be used 
for drawing lines as well as for filling shapes. These pictures were made by the sample program 
PaintDemo.java. In that program, you can select among several different paints, and you can 
control certain properties of the paints. As usual, an applet version of the program is available 
on line. 



Basic gradient paints are created using the constructor 

public GradientPaint (float xl, float yl, Color cl, 

float x2, float y2, Color c2, boolean cyclic) 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



672 



This constructs a gradient that has color cl at the point with coordinates (xl,yl) and color 
c2 at the point (x2,y2). As you move along the line between the two points, the color of the 
gradient changes from cl to c2; along lines perpendicular to this line, the color is constant. 
The last parameter, cyclic, tells what happens if you move past the point (x2,y2) on the 
line from (xl,yl) to (x2,y2). If cyclic is false, the color stops changing and any point 
beyond (x2,y2) has color c2. If cyclic is true, then the colors continue to change in a cyclic 
pattern after you move past (x2,y2). (It works the same way if you move past the other 
endpoint, (xl,yl).) In most cases, you will set cyclic to true. Note that you can vary the 
points (xl,yl) and (x2,y2) to change the width and direction of the gradient. For example, 
to create a cyclic gradient that varies from black to light gray along the line from (0,0) to 
(100,100), use: 

new GradientPaint( 0, 0, Color. BLACK, 100, 100, Color .LIGHT _GRAY, true) 

Java 6 introduced two new gradient paint classes, LinearGradientPaint and RadialGradientPaint. 
Linear gradient paints are similar to GradientPaint but can be based on more than two colors. 
Radial gradients color pixels based on their distance from a central point, which produces rings 
of constant color instead of lines of constant color. See the API documentation for details. 

To construct a TexturePaint, you need a Bufferedlmage that contains the image that will be 
used for the texture. You also specify a rectangle in which the image will be drawn. The image 
will be scaled, if necessary, to exactly fill the rectangle. Outside the specified rectangle, the 
image will be repeated horizontally and vertically to fill the plane. You can vary the size and 
position of the rectangle to change the scale of the texture and its positioning on the plane. 
Ordinarily, however the upper left corner of the rectangle is placed at (0,0), and the size of 
the rectangle is the same as the actual size of the image. The constructor for TexturePaint is 
defined as 

public TexturePaint ( Bufferedlmage texturelmage , Rectangle2D anchorRect) 

The Rectangle2D is part of the Graphics2D framework and will be discussed at the end of this 
section. Often, a call to the constructor takes the form: 

new TexturePaint ( image , 

new Rectangle2D. Double (0,0, image. getWidthO , image. getHeightO ) 

Once you have a Paint object, you can use the setPaintO method of a Graphics2D object 
to install the paint in a graphics context. For example, if g2 is of type Graphics2D, then the 
command 

g2.setPaint( new GradientPaint (0,0, Color .BLUE, 100, 100, Color .GREEN, true) ); 

sets up g2 to use a gradient paint. Subsequent drawing operations with g2 will draw using a 
blue/green gradient. 

13.2.5 Transforms 

In the standard drawing coordinates on a component, the upper left corner of the component 
has coordinates (0,0). Coordinates are integers, and the coordinates (x,y) refer to the point 
that is x pixels over from the left edge of the component and y pixels down from the top. With 
Graphics2D, however, you are not restricted to using these coordinates. In fact, you can can 
set up a Graphics2D graphics context to use any system of coordinates that you like. You can 
use this capability to select the coordinate system that is most appropriate for the things that 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



673 



you want to draw. For example, if you are drawing architectural blueprints, you might use 
coordinates in which one unit represents an actual distance of one foot. 

Changes to a coordinate system are referred to as transforms. There are three basic 
types of transform. A translate transform changes the position of the origin, (0,0). A scale 
transform changes the scale, that is, the unit of distance. And a rotation transform applies a 
rotation about some point. You can make more complex transforms by combining transforms 
of the three basic types. For example, you can apply a rotation, followed by a scale, followed by 
a translation, followed by another rotation. When you apply several transforms in a row, their 
effects are cumulative. It takes a fair amount of study to fully understand complex transforms. 
I will limit myself here to discussing a few of the most simple cases, just to give you an idea of 
what transforms can do. 

Suppose that g2 is of type Graphics2D. Then g2. translate (x,y) moves the origin, 
(0,0), to the point (x,y). This means that if you use coordinates (0,0) after saying 
g2 . translate (x,y) , then you are referring to the point that used to be (x,y), before the 
translation was applied. All other coordinate pairs are moved by the same amount. For exam- 
ple saying 

g. translate (x,y) ; 
g.drawLine( 0, 0, 100, 200 ); 

draws the same line as 

g.drawLine( x, y, 100+x, 200+y ); 

In the second case, you are just doing the same translation "by hand." A translation (like all 
transforms) affects all subsequent drawing operations. Instead of thinking in terms of coordinate 
systems, you might find it clearer to think of what happens to the objects that are drawn. After 
you say g2. translate (x,y), any objects that you draw are displaced x units horizontally and 
y units vertically. Note that the parameters x and y can be real numbers. 

As an example, perhaps you would prefer to have (0,0) at the center of a component, instead 
of at its upper left corner. To do this, just use the following command in the paintComponent () 
method of the component: 

g2.translate( getWidth()/2, getHeight () /2 ); 

To apply a scale transform to a Graphics2D g2, use g2. scale (s,s), where s is the real 
number that specifies the scaling factor. If s is greater than 1, everything is magnified by a 
factor of s, while if s is between and 1, everything is shrunk by a factor of s. The center of 
scaling is (0,0). That is, the point (0,0) is unaffected by the scaling, and other points more 
towards or away from (0,0) by a factor of s. Again, it can be clearer to think of the effect 
on objects that are drawn after a scale transform is applied. Those objects will be magnified 
or shrunk by a factor of s. Note that scaling affects everything, including thickness of lines 
and size of fonts. It is possible to use different scale factors in the horizontal and vertical 
direction with a command of the form g2. scale (sx,sy), although that will distort the shapes 
of objects. By the way, it is even possible to use scale factors that are less than 0, which results 
in reflections. For example, after calling g2 . scale (-1 , 1) , objects will be reflected horizontally 
through the line x=0. 

The third type of basic transform is rotation. The command g2. rotate (r) rotates all 
subsequently drawn objects through an angle of r about the point (0,0). You can rotate 
instead about the point (x,y) with the command g2. rotate (r,x,y). All the parameters can 
be real numbers. Angles are measured in radians, where tt radians are equal to 180 degrees. To 
rotate through an angle of d degrees, use 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



674 



g2. rotate ( d * Math. PI / 180 ); 

Positive angles are clockwise rotations, while negative angles are counterclockwise (unless you 
have applied a negative scale factor, which reverses the orientation). 

Rotation is not as common as translation or scaling, but there are a few things that you 
can do with it that can't be done any other way. For example, you can use it to draw an image 
"on the slant." Rotation also makes it possible to draw text that is rotated so that its baseline 
is slanted or even vertical. To draw the string "Hello World" with its basepoint at (x,y) and 
rising at an angle of 30 degrees, use: 

g2. rotate ( -30 * Math. PI / 180, x, y ); 
g2.drawString( "Hello World", x, y ); 

To draw the message vertically, with the center of its baseline at the point (x,y), we can use 
FontMetrics to measure the string, and say: 

FontMetrics fm = g2.getFontMetrics( g2.getFont() ); 
int baselineLength = fm. stringWidthC'Hello World"); 
g2. rotate ( -90 * Math. PI / 180, x, y) ; 

g2.drawString( "Hello World", x - baselineLength/2, y ); 

* * * 

The drawing operations in the Graphics class use integer coordinates only. Graphics2D makes 
it possible to use real numbers as coordinates. This becomes particularly important once you 
start using transforms, since after you apply a scale, a square of size one might cover many 
pixels instead of just a single pixel. Unfortunately, the designers of Java couldn't decide whether 
to use numbers of type float or double as coordinates, and their indecision makes things a little 
more complicated than they need to be. (My guess is that they really wanted to use float, since 
values of type float have enough accuracy for graphics and are probably used in the underlying 
graphical computations of the computer. However, in Java programming, it's easier to use 
double than float, so they wanted to make it possible to use double values too.) 

To use real number coordinates, you have to use classes defined in the package 
java. awt . geom. Among the classes in this package are classes that represent geometric shapes 
such as lines and rectangles. For example, the class Line2D represents a line whose endpoints 
are given as real number coordinates. The unfortunate thing is that Line2D is an abstract 
class, which means that you can't create objects of type Line2D directly. However, Line2D 
has two concrete subclasses that can be used to create objects. One subclass uses coordinates 
of type float, and one uses coordinates of type double. The most peculiar part is that these 
subclasses are defined as static nested classes inside Line2D. Their names are Line2D. Float and 
Line2D. Double. This means that Line2D objects can be created, for example, with: 

Line2D linel = new Line2D . Float ( 0.17F, 1.3F, -2.7F, 5.21F ); 
Line2D line2 = new Line2D . Double ( 0, 0, 1, 0); 
Line2D line3 = new Line2D . Double ( xl, yl, x2, y2 ); 

where xl, yl, x2, y2 are any numeric variables. In my own code, I generally use Line2D. Double 
rather than Line2D. Float. 

Other shape classes in java. awt .geom are similar. The class that represents rectangles is 
Rectangle2D. To create a rectangle object, you have to use either Rectangle2D. Float or Rectan- 
gle2D. Double. For example, 

Rectangle2D rect = new Rectangle2D . Double ( -0.5, -0.5, 1.0, 1.0 ); 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



675 



creates a rectangle with a corner at (-0.5,-0.5) and with width and height both equal to 1. 
Other classes include Point2D, which represents a single point; Ellipse2D, which represents an 
oval; and Arc2D, which represents an arc of a circle. 

If g2 is of type Graphics2D and shape is an object belonging to one of the 2D shape classes, 
then the command 

g2 . draw (shape) ; 

draws the shape. For a shape such as a rectangle or ellipse that has an interior, only the outline 
is drawn. To fill in the interior of such a shape, use 

g2. fill (shape) 
For example, to draw a line from (xl,yl) to (x2,y2), use 

g2.draw( new Line2D. Double (xl,yl,x2,y2) ); 
and to draw a filled rectangle with a corner at (3.5,7), with width 5 and height 3, use 

g2.fill( new Rectangle2D.Double(3.5, 7, 5, 3) ); 

The package j ava . awt . geom also has a very nice class GeneralPath that can be used to draw 
polygons and curves defined by any number of points. See the Java documentation if you want 
to find out how to use it. In Java 6, GeneralPath has been largely superseded by Path2D which 
provides the same functionality but more closely follows the conventions used by other shape 
classes. 

This section has introduced you to many of the interesting features of Graphics2D, but there 
is still a large part of the Graphics2D framework for you to explore. 

13.3 Actions and Buttons 

For the past two sections, we have been looking at some of the more advanced aspects of (online) 
the Java graphics API. But the heart of most graphical user interface programming is using GUI 
components. In this section and the next, we'll be looking at JComponents. We'll cover several 
component classes that were not covered in Chapter 6, as well as some additional features of 
classes that were covered there. 

This section is mostly about buttons. Buttons are among the simplest of GUI components, 
and it seems like there shouldn't be all that much to say about them. However, buttons are 
not as simple as they seem. For one thing, there are many different types of buttons. The 
basic functionality of buttons in Java is defined by the class javax. swing. AbstractButton. 
Subclasses of this class represent push buttons, check boxes, and radio buttons. Menu items 
are also considered to be buttons. The AbstractButton class defines a surprisingly large API for 
controlling the appearance of buttons. This section will cover part of that API, but you should 
see the class documentation for full details. 

In this section, we'll also encounter a few classes that do not themselves define buttons but 
that are related to the button API, starting with "actions." 

13.3.1 Action and Abstract Action 

The JButton class represents push buttons. Up until now, we have created push buttons using 
the constructor 

public JButton(String text) ; 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



676 



which specifies text that will appear on the button. We then added an ActionListener to the 
button, to respond when the user presses it. Another way to create a J Button is using an 
Action. The Action interface represents the general idea of some action that can be performed, 
together with properties associated with that action, such as a name for the action, an icon 
that represents the action, and whether the action is currently enabled or disabled. Actions are 
usually defined using the class AbstractAction, an abstract class which includes a method 

public void actionPerf ormed(ActionEvent evt) 

that must be defined in any concrete subclass. Often, this is done in an anonymous inner class. 
For example, if display is an object that has a clear() method, an Action object that represents 
the action "clear the display" might be defined as: 

Action clearAction = new AbstractActionO'Clear") { 
public void actionPerf ormed(ActionEvent evt) { 
display . clear ( ) ; 

} 

}; 

The parameter, "Clear", in the constructor of the AbstractAction is the name of the action. 
Other properties can be set by calling the method put Value (key, value), which is part of the 
Action interface. For example, 

clearAction. putValue (Action. SHORT .DESCRIPTION, "Clear the Display"); 

sets the SHORT .DESCRIPTION property of the action to have the value "Clear the Display". The 
key parameter in the putValue () method is usually given as one of several constants defined 
in the Action interface. As another example, you can change the name of an action by using 
Action. NAME as the key in the putValue () method. 

Once you have an Action, you can use it in the constructor of a button. For example, using 
the action clearAction defined above, we can create the JButton 

JButton clearButton = new JButton( clearAction ) ; 

The name of the action will be used as the text of the button, and some other properties of 
the button will be taken from properties of the action. For example, if the SHORT .DESCRIPTION 
property of the action has a value, then that value is used as the tooltip text for the button. 
(The tooltip text appears when the user hovers the mouse over the button.) Furthermore, 
when you change a property of the action, the corresponding property of the button will also 
be changed. 

The Action interface defines a setEnabledO method that is used to enable and 
disable the action. The clearAction action can be enabled and disabled by calling 
clearAction. setEnabled(true) and clearAction. setEnabled(f alse) . When you do this, 
any button that has been created from the action is also enabled or disabled at the same time. 

Now of course, the question is, why should you want to use Actions at all? One advantage 
is that using actions can help you to organize your code better. You can create separate objects 
that represent each of the actions that can be performed in your program. This represents a nice 
division of responsibility. Of course, you could do the same thing with individual ActionListener 
objects, but then you couldn't associate descriptions and other properties with the actions. 

More important is the fact that Actions can also be used in other places in the Java API. 
You can use an Action to create a JMenultem in the same way as for a JButton: 

JMenuItem clearCommand = new JMenultem ( clearAction ) ; 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



677 



A JMenultem, in fact, is a kind of button and shares many of the same properties that a JButton 
can have. You can use the same Action to create both a button and a menu item (or even 
several of each if you want). Whenever you enable or disable the action or change its name, the 
button and the menu item will both be changed to match. If you change the NAME property of 
the action, the text of both the menu item and the button will be set to the new name of the 
action. If you disable the action, both menu item and button will be disabled. You can think 
of the button and the menu items as being two presentations of the Action, and you don't have 
to keep track of the button or menu item after you create them. You can do everything that 
you need to do by manipulating the Action object. 

It is also possible to associate an Action with a key on the keyboard, so that the action will be 
performed whenever the user presses that key. I won't explain how to do it here, but you can look 
up the documentation for the classes javax. swing. InputMap and javax. swing. Act ionMap. 

By the way, if you want to add a menu item that is defined by an Action to a menu, you 
don't even need to create the JMenultem yourself. You can add the action object directly to 
the menu, and the menu item will be created from the properties of the action. For example, if 
menu is a JMenu and clearAction is an Action, you can simply say menu. add(clearAction) . 

13.3.2 Icons on Buttons 

In addition to — or instead of — text, buttons can also show icons. Icons are represented by the 
Icon interface and are usually created as Imagelcons, as discussed in Subsection 13.1.4. For 
example, here is a picture of a button that displays an image of a large "X" as its icon: 

Jt Clear the Display 



The icon for a button can be set by calling the button's setlconO method, or by passing the 
icon object as a parameter to the constructor when the button is created. To create the button 
shown above, I created an Imagelcon from a Buffered I mage on which I drew the picture that 
I wanted, and I constructed the JButton using a constructor that takes both the text and the 
icon for the button as parameters. Here's the code segment that does it: 

Buff eredlmage image = new BufferedImage(24,24,BufferedImage.TYPE_INTJlGB) ; 
Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) image. getGraphics () ; 

g2 . setColor (Color . LIGHT_GRAY) ; // Draw the image for the icon. 

g2.f illRect(0,0,24,24) ; 

g2 . setStroke ( new BasicStroke (3) ); // Use thick lines. 

g2 . setColor (Color . BLACK) ; 

g2.drawLine(4,4,20,20) ; // Draw the "X". 

g2 . drawLine (4 , 20 , 20 , 4) ; 
g2 . dispose () ; 

Icon clearlcon = new Imagelcon(image) ; // Create the icon. 

JButton clearButton = new JButton ("Clear the Display", clearlcon); 

You can create a button with an icon but no text by using a constructor that takes just the 
icon as parameter. Another alternative is for the button to get its icon from an Action. When 
a button is constructed from an action, it takes its icon from the value of the action property 
Action. SMALL_ICDN. For example, suppose that we want to use an action named clearAction 
to create the button shown above. This could be done with: 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



678 



clearAction. putValue( Action. SMALL_ICDN, clearlcon ); 
JButton clearButton = new JButton( clearAction ) ; 

The icon could also be associated with the action by passing it as a parameter to the constructor 
of an AbstractAction: 

Action clearAction = new AbstractActionC'Clear the Display", clearlcon) { 
public void actionPerf ormed(ActionEvent evt) { 

// Carry out the action. 

} 

} 

JButton clearButton = new JButton( clearAction ) ; 

(In Java 6.0 and later, a button will use the value of the Action. LARGE_ICDN_KEY property of 
the action, if that property has a value, in preference to Action. SMALL.ICON.) 

The appearance of buttons can be tweaked in many ways. For example, you can change the 
size of the gap between the button's text and its icon. You can associate additional icons with 
a button that are used when the button is in certain states, such as when it is pressed or when 
it is disabled. It is even possible to change the positioning of the text with respect to the icon. 
For example, to place the text centered below the icon on a button, you can say: 

button. setHorizontalTextPosition( JButton. CENTER) ; 
button. setVerticalTextPosition(JButton. BOTTOM) ; 

These methods and many others are defined in the class AbstractButton. This class is a super- 
class for JMenultem, as well as for JButton and for the classes that define check boxes and radio 
buttons. Note in particular that an icon can be shown in a menu by associating the icon with 
a menu item or with the action that is used to create the menu item. 

Finally, I will mention that it is possible to use icons on JLabels in much the same way that 
they can be used on JButtons. Placing an Imagelcon on a JLabel can be a convenient way to 
add a static image to your GUI. 

13.3.3 Radio Buttons 

The JCheckBox class was covered in Subsection 6.6.3, and the equivalent for use in menus, 
JCheckBoxMenultem, in Subsection 6.8.1. A checkbox has two states, selected and not selected, 
and the user can change the state by clicking on the check box. The state of a checkbox can 
also be set programmatically by calling its setSelectedO method, and the current value of 
the state can be checked using the isSelectedO method. 

Closely related to checkboxes are radio buttons. Like a checkbox, a radio button can 
be either selected or not. However, radio buttons are expected to occur in groups, and at 
most one radio button in a group can be selected at any given time. In Java, a radio button 
is represented by an object of type JRadioButton. When used in isolation, a JRadioButton 
acts just like a JCheckBox, and it has the same methods and events. Ordinarily, however, a 
JRadioButton is used in a group. A group of radio buttons is represented by an object belonging 
to the class ButtonGroup. A ButtonGroup is not a component and does not itself have a visible 
representation on the screen. A ButtonGroup works behind the scenes to organize a group of 
radio buttons, to ensure that at most one button in the group can be selected at any given 
time. 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



679 



To use a group of radio buttons, you must create a JRadioButton object for each button 
in the group, and you must create one object of type ButtonGroup to organize the individual 
buttons into a group. Each JRadioButton must be added individually to some container, so that 
it will appear on the screen. (A ButtonGroup plays no role in the placement of the buttons on 
the screen.) Each JRadioButton must also be added to the ButtonGroup, which has an add() 
method for this purpose. If you want one of the buttons to be selected initially, you can call 
setSelected(true) for that button. If you don't do this, then none of the buttons will be 
selected until the user clicks on one of them. 

As an example, here is how you could set up a set of radio buttons that can be used to 
select a color: 

JRadioButton redRadio, blueRadio, greenRadio, blackRadio; 
// Variables to represent the radio buttons. 
// These should probably be instance variables, so 
// that they can be used throughout the program. 

ButtonGroup colorGroup = new ButtonGroup () ; 

redRadio = new JRadioButtonC'Red") ; // Create a button. 
colorGroup . add(redRadio) ; // Add it to the group. 

blueRadio = new JRadioButton ("Blue") ; 
colorGroup . add(blueRadio) ; 

greenRadio = new JRadioButtonC'Green") ; 
colorGroup. add (greenRadio) ; 

blackRadio = new JRadioButtonC'Black") ; 
colorGroup . add (blackRadio) ; 

redRadio . setSelected(true) ; // Make an initial selection. 

The individual buttons must still be added to a container if they are to appear on the screen. 
If you want to respond immediately when the user clicks on one of the radio buttons, you can 
register an ActionListener for each button. Just as for checkboxes, it is not always necessary 
to register listeners for radio buttons. In some cases, you can simply check the state of each 
button when you need to know it, using the button's isSelectedO method. 

All this is demonstrated in the sample program RadioButtonDemo.java. The program shows 
four radio buttons. When the user selects one of the radio buttons, the text and background 
color of a label is changed. Here is a picture of the program, with the "Green" radio button 
selected: 



Red 



O Blue 



® Green 



G Black 



reen is selected 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



680 



You can add the equivalent of a group of radio buttons to a menu by using the class 
JRadioButtonMenultem. To use this class, create several objects of this type, and create a But- 
tonGroup to manage them. Add each JRadioButtonMenultem to the ButtonGroup, and also add 
them to a J Menu. If you want one of the items to be selected initially, call its setSelectedO 
method to set its selection state to true. You can add ActionListeners to each JRadioButton- 
Menultem if you need to take some action when the user selects the menu item; if not, you 
can simply check the selected states of the buttons whenever you need to know them. As an 
example, suppose that menu is a JMenu. Then you can add a group of buttons to menu as 
follows: 

JRadioButtonMenultem selectRedltem, selectGreenltem, selectBlueltem; 

// These might be defined as instance variables 
ButtonGroup group = new ButtonGroup () ; 
selectRedltem = new JRadioButtonMenultem ( "Red" ) ; 
group . add(selectRedltem) ; 
menu. add (selectRedltem) ; 

selectGreenltem = new JRadioButtonMenultem ( "Green") ; 
group . add(selectGreenltem) ; 
menu. add (selectGreenltem) ; 

selectBlueltem = new JRadioButtonMenultem ("Blue") ; 
group . add(selectBlueltem) ; 
menu.add(selectBlueltem) ; 

* * * 

When it's drawn on the screen, a JCheckBox includes a little box that is either checked or 
unchecked to show the state of the box. That box is actually a pair of Icons. One icon is shown 
when the check box is unselected; the other is shown when it is selected. You can change the 
appearance of the check box by substituting different icons for the standard ones. 

The icon that is shown when the check box is unselected is just the main icon for the 
JCheckBox. You can provide a different unselected icon in the constructor or you can change 
the icon using the setlconQ method of the JCheckBox object. To change the icon that is 
shown when the check box is selected, use the setSelectedlconO method of the JCheckBox. 
All this applies equally to JRadioButton, JCheckBoxMenultem, and JRadioButtonMenultem. 

An example of this can be found in the sample program ToolBarDemo.java, which is dis- 
cussed in the next subsection. That program creates a set of radio buttons that use custom 
icons. The buttons are created by the following method: 

/** 

* Create a JRadioButton and add it to a specified button group. The button 

* is meant for selecting a drawing color in the display. The color is used to 

* create two custom icons, one for the unselected state of the button and one 

* for the selected state. These icons are used instead of the usual 

* radio button icons. 

* Oparam c the color of the button, and the color to be used for drawing. 

* (Note that c has to be "final" since it is used in the anonymous inner 

* class that defines the response to ActionEvents on the button.) 

* Oparam grp the ButtonGroup to which the radio button will be added. 

* Oparam selected if true, then the state of the button is set to selected. 

* Oreturn the radio button that was just created; sorry, but the button 

is not as pretty as I would like! 

*/ 

private JRadioButton makeColorRadioButton (final Color c, 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



681 



ButtonGroup grp, boolean selected) { 

/* Create an Imagelcon for the normal, unselected state of the button, 
using a Buffer edlmage that is drawn here from scratch. */ 

Buf f eredlmage image = new Buff eredlmage(30, 30, Buff eredlmage . TYPE_INT_RGB) ; 
Graphics g = image. getGraphics () ; 
g . setColor (Color . LIGHT _GRAY) ; 
g.f illRect(0,0,30,30) ; 
g.setColor(c) ; 

g.f ill3DRect(l, 1, 24, 24, true); 
g.disposeO ; 

Icon unselectedlcon = new Imagelcon(image) ; 

/* Create an Imagelcon for the selected state of the button. */ 

image = new Buf f eredlmage (30, 30, Buff eredlmage. TYPE_INT_RGB) ; 

g = image . getGraphics () ; 

g . setColor (Color . DARK_GRAY) ; 

g.f illRect(0,0,30,30) ; 

g.setColor(c) ; 

g.f ill3DRect(3, 3, 24, 24, false); 
g.disposeO ; 

Icon selectedlcon = new Image I con (image) ; 
/* Create and configure the button. */ 

JRadioButton button = new JRadioButton (unselectedlcon) ; 
button. setSelectedlcon(selectedlcon) ; 
button. addActionListener ( new ActionListener () { 
public void actionPerf ormed(ActionEvent e) { 

// The action for this button sets the current drawing color 
//in the display to c. 
display. setCurrentColor (c) ; 

} 

»; 

grp . add (button) ; 
if (selected) 

button. setSelected(true) ; 

return button; 
} // end makeColorRadioButton 

* * * 

It is possible to create radio buttons and check boxes from Actions. The button 
takes its name, main icon, tooltip text, and enabled/disabled state from the action. In 
Java 5.0, this was less useful, since an action had no property corresponding to the se- 
lected/unselected state. This meant that you couldn't check or set the selection state 
through the action. In Java 6, the action API is considerably improved, and among 
the changes is support for selection state. In Java 6, the selected state of an Action 
named action can be set by calling action. putValue (Action. SELECTED _KEY, true) and 
action. putValue (Action. SELECTED _KEY, false). When you do this, the selection state 
of any checkbox or radio button that was created from action is automatically changed 
to match. Conversely, when the state of the checkbox or radio button is changed in 
some other way, the property of the action — and hence of any other components created 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



682 



from the action — will automatically change as well. The state can be checked by calling 
action . getValue (Action . SELECTED _KEY) . 

13.3.4 Toolbars 

It has become increasingly common for programs to have a row of small buttons along the top 
or side of the program window that offer access to some of the commonly used features of the 
program. The row of buttons is known as a tool bar. Typically, the buttons in a tool bar are 
presented as small icons, with no text. Tool bars can also contain other components, such as 
JTextFields and JLabels. 

In Swing, tool bars are represented by the class JToolBar. A JToolBar is a container that can 
hold other components. It is also itself a component, and so can be added to other containers. 
In general, the parent component of the tool bar should use a BorderLayout. The tool bar 
should occupy one of the edge positions — NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, or WEST — in the BorderLayout. 
Furthermore, the other three edge positions should be empty. The reason for this is that it 
might be possible (depending on the platform and configuration) for the user to drag the tool 
bar from one edge position in the parent container to another. It might even be possible for 
the user to drag the tool bar off its parent entirely, so that it becomes a separate window. 

Here is a picture of a tool bar from the sample program ToolBarDemo.java. 

■ ■■ X I 



In this program, the user can draw colored curves in a large drawing area. The first three 
buttons in the tool bar are a set of radio buttons that control the drawing color. The fourth 
button is a push button that the user can click to clear the drawing. 

Tool bars are easy to use. You just have to create the JToolBar object, add it to a container, 
and add some buttons and possibly other components to the tool bar. One fine point is adding 
space to a tool bar, such as the gap between the radio buttons and the push button in the 
sample program. You can leave a gap by adding a separator to the tool bar. For example: 

toolbar. addSeparator (new Dimension (20, 20)) ; 

This adds an invisible 20-by-20 pixel block to the tool bar. This will appear as a 20 pixel gap 
between components. 

Here is the constructor from the ToolBarDemo program. It shows how to create the tool 
bar and place it in a container. Note that class ToolBarDemo is a subclass of JPanel, and the 
tool bar and display are added to the panel object that is being constructed: 

public ToolBarDemo () { 

setLayout (new BorderLayout (2,2)) ; 
setBackground (Color .GRAY) ; 

setBorder (BorderFactory . createLineBorder (Color . GRAY, 2) ) ; 

display = new DisplayO; 
add(display, BorderLayout . CENTER) ; 

JToolBar toolbar = new JToolBarO ; 
add (toolbar , BorderLayout .NORTH) ; 

ButtonGroup group = new ButtonGroupO ; 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



683 



toolbar . add( makeColorRadioButton (Color .RED, group, true) ); 
toolbar. add( makeColorRadioButton (Color . GREEN, group, false) ); 
toolbar. add( makeColorRadioButton (Color .BLUE, group, false) ); 
toolbar. addSeparator (new Dimension (20, 20)) ; 

toolbar. add( makeClearButtonO ); 

} 

Note that the gray outline of the tool bar comes from two sources: The line at the bottom 
shows the background color of the main panel, which is visible because the BorderLayout that 
is used on that panel has vertical and horizontal gaps of 2 pixels. The other three sides are 
part of the border of the main panel. 

If you want a vertical tool bar that can be placed in the EAST or WEST position of a Border- 
Layout, you should specify the orientation in the tool bar's constructor: 

JToolBar toolbar = new JToolBar( JToolBar .VERTICAL ); 

The default orientation is JToolBar .HORIZONTAL. The orientation is adjusted automatically 
when the user drags the tool bar into a new position. If you want to prevent the user from 
dragging the tool bar, just say toolbar . setFloatable (false) . 

13.3.5 Keyboard Accelerators 

In most programs, commonly used menu commands have keyboard equivalents. The user 
can type the keyboard equivalent instead of selecting the command from the menu, and the 
result will be exactly the same. Typically, for example, the "Save" command has keyboard 
equivalent C0NTR0L-S, and the "Undo" command corresponds to C0NTR0L-Z. (Under Mac OS, 
the keyboard equivalents for these commands would probably be META-S and META-Z, where 
META refers to holding down the "apple" key.) The keyboard equivalents for menu commands 
are referred to as accelerators. 

The class javax. swing. Keystroke is used to represent key strokes that the user can type 
on the keyboard. A key stroke consists of pressing a key, possibly while holding down one or 
more of the modifier keys control, shift, alt, and meta. The KeyStroke class has a static 
method, getKeyStroke (String) , that makes it easy to create key stroke objects. For example, 

Keystroke. getKeyStroke ( "Ctrl S" ) 

returns a KeyStroke that represents the action of pressing the "S" key while holding down the 
control key. In addition to "ctrl" , you can use the modifiers "shift" , "alt" , and "meta" in the 
string that describes the key stroke. You can even combine several modifiers, so that 

Keystroke. getKeyStroke ( "ctrl shift Z" ) 

represents the action of pressing the "Z" key while holding down both the control and the shift 
keys. When the key stroke involves pressing a character key, the character must appear in the 
string in upper case form. You can also have key strokes that correspond to non-character keys. 
The number keys can be referred to as "1", "2", etc., while certain special keys have names 
such as "Fl", "ENTER", and "LEFT" (for the left arrow key). The class KeyEvent defines 
many constants such as VK_ENTER, VK_LEFT, and VK_S. The names that are used for keys in the 
keystroke description are just these constants with the leading "VK_" removed. 

There are at least two ways to associate a keyboard accelerator with a menu item. One is 
to use the set Accelerator () method of the menu item object: 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



684 



JMenuItem saveCommand = new JMenuItem C "Save..." ); 
saveCommand. setAccelerator ( Keystroke. getKeyStrokeC Ctrl S") ); 

The other technique can be used if the menu item is created from an Action. The action property 
Action. ACCELERATOR_KEY can be used to associate a KeyStroke with an Action. When a menu 
item is created from the action, the keyboard accelerator for the menu item is taken from the 
value of this property. For example, if redoAction is an Action representing a "Redo" action, 
then you might say: 

redoAct ion . put Value ( Act ion . ACCELERATOR_KEY , 

Keystroke. getKeyStrokeC "ctrl shift Z") ); 
JMenuItem redoCommand = new JMenuItemC redoAction ) ; 

or, alternatively, you could simply add the action to a JMenu, editMenu, with 
editMenu. add(redoAction) . (Note, by the way, that accelerators apply only to menu items, 
not to push buttons. When you create a JButton from an action, the ACCELERATOR-KEY property 
of the action is ignored.) 

Note that you can use accelerators for JCheckBoxMenultems and JRadioButtonMenultems, 
as well as for simple J Menu Items. 

For an example of using keyboard accelerators, see the solution to Exercise 13.2. 

* * * 

By the way, as noted above, in the Mac OS operating system, the meta (or apple) key is 
usually used for keyboard accelerators instead of the control key. If you would like to make your 
program more Mac-friendly, you can test whether your program is running under Mac OS and, 
if so, adapt your accelerators to the Mac OS style. The recommended way to detect Mac OS 
is to test the value of System. getPropertyC'mrj .version"). This function call happens to 
return a non-null value under Mac OS but returns null under other operating systems. For 
example, here is a simple utility routine for making Mac- friendly accelerators: 

/** 

* Create a Keystroke that uses the meta key on Mac OS and 

* the control key on other operating systems. 

* Oparam description a string that describes the keystroke, 

* without the "meta" or "ctrl"; for example, "S" or 

* "shift Z" or "alt Fl" 

* Oreturn a keystroke created from the description string 

* with either "ctrl " or "meta " prepended 
*/ 

private static Keystroke makeAccelerator (String description) { 
String commandKey; 

if ( System. getPropertyC'mrj .version") == null ) 

commandKey = "ctrl"; 
else 

commandKey = "meta" ; 
return Keystroke. getKeyStrokeC commandKey + " " + description ); 

} 

13.3.6 HTML on Buttons 

As a final stop in this brief tour of ways to spiff up your buttons, I'll mention the fact that the 
text that is displayed on a button can be specified in HTML format. HTML is the markup 
language that is used to write web pages. A brief introduction to HTML can be found in 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



685 



Subsection 6.2.3. HTML allows you to apply color or italics or other styles to just part of the 
text on your buttons. It also makes it possible to have buttons that display multiple lines of 
text. (You can also use HTML on JLabels, which can be even more useful.) Here's a picture of 
a button with HTML text (along with a "Java" icon): 



■^l j Now is the time for 
a nice cup of coffee. 

Javar 



If the string of text that is applied to a button starts with "<html>", then the string is 
interpreted as HTML. The string does not have to use strict HTML format; for example, you 
don't need a closing </html> at the end of the string. To get multi-line text, use <br> in the 
string to represent line breaks. If you would like the lines of text to be center justified, include 
the entire text (except for the <html>) between <center> and </center>. For example, 

JButton button = new JButton ( 

"<html><center>This button has<br>two lines of text</center>" ); 

creates a button that displays two centered lines of text. You can apply italics to part of the 
string by enclosing that part between <i> and </i>. Similarly, use <b> . . . </b> for bold text and 
<u> . . . </u> for underlined text. For green text, enclose the text between <f ont color=green> 
and </f ont >. You can, of course, use other colors in place of "green." The "Java" button that 
is shown above was created using: 

JButton javaButton = new JButton( "<html><b>Now</b> is the time for<br>" + 

"a nice cup of <font color=red>cof f ee</f ont> . " ); 

Other HTML features can also be used on buttons and labels — experiment to see what you can 
get away with! 

13.4 Complex Components and MVC 

Since even buttons turn out to be pretty complex, as seen in the previous section, you (online) 
might guess that there is a lot more complexity lurking in the Swing API. While this is true, 
a lot of that complexity works to your benefit as a programmer, since a lot of it is hidden in 
normal uses of Swing components. For example, you don't have to know about all the complex 
details of buttons in order to use them effectively in most programs. 

Swing defines several component classes that are much more complex than those we have 
looked at so far, but even the most complex components are not very difficult to use for many 
purposes. In this section, we'll look at components that support display and manipulation of 
lists, tables, and text documents. To use these complex components effectively, you'll need to 
know something about the Model- View-Controller pattern that is used as a basis for the design 
of many Swing components. This pattern is discussed in the first part of this section. 

This section is our last look at Swing components, but there are a number of component 
classes that have not even been touched on in this book. Some useful ones that you might want 
to look into include: JTabbedPane, JSplitPane, JTree, JSpinner, JPopupMenu, JProgressBar, and 
JScrollBar. 

At the end of the section, we'll look briefly at the idea of writing custom component classes — 
something that you might consider when even the large variety of components that are already 
defined in Swing don't do quite what you want. 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



686 



13.4.1 Model- View-Controller 

One of the principles of object-oriented design is division of responsibilities. Ideally, an object 
should have a single, clearly defined role, with a limited realm of responsibility. One application 
of this principle to the design of graphical user interfaces is the MVC pattern. "MVC" stands 
for "Model- View-Controller" and refers to three different realms of responsibility in the design 
of a graphical user interface. 

When the MVC pattern is applied to a component, the model consists of the data that 
represents the current state of the component. The view is simply the visual presentation of 
the component on the screen. And the controller is the aspect of the component that carries 
out actions in response to events generated by the user (or by other sources such as timers) . The 
idea is to assign responsibility for the model, the view, and the controller to different objects. 

The view is the easiest part of the MVC pattern to understand. It is often represented by 
the component object itself, and its responsibility is to draw the component on the screen. In 
doing this, of course, it has to consult the model, since the model represents the state of the 
component, and that state can determine what appears on the screen. To get at the model 
data — which is stored in a separate object according to the MVC pattern — the component 
object needs to keep a reference to the model object. Furthermore, when the model changes, 
the view might have to be redrawn to reflect the changed state. The component needs some way 
of knowing when changes in the model occur. Typically, in Java, this is done with events and 
listeners. The model object is set up to generate events when its data changes. The view object 
registers itself as a listener for those events. When the model changes, an event is generated, 
the view is notified of that event, and the view responds by updating its appearance on the 
screen. 

When MVC is used for Swing components, the controller is generally not so well defined as 
the model and view, and its responsibilities are often split among several objects. The controller 
might include mouse and keyboard listeners that respond to user events on the view; Actions 
that respond to menu commands or buttons; and listeners for other high-level events, such as 
those from a slider, that affect the state of the component. Usually, the controller responds 
to events by making modifications to the model, and the view is changed only indirectly, in 
response to the changes in the model. 

The MVC pattern is used in many places in the design of Swing. It is even used for buttons. 
The state of a Swing button is stored in an object of type ButtonModel. The model stores such 
information as whether the button is enabled, whether it is selected, and what ButtonGroup it 
is part of, if any. If button is of type JButton (or one of the other subclasses of AbstractButton) , 
then its ButtonModel can be obtained by calling button. getModeK). In the case of buttons, 
you might never need to use the model or even know that it exists. But for the list and table 
components that we will look at next, knowledge of the model is essential. 

13.4.2 Lists and ListModels 

A JList is a component that represents a list of items that can be selected by the user. The 
sample program SillyStamper.java allows the user to select one icon from a JList of Icons. The 
user selects an icon from the list by clicking on it. The selected icon can be "stamped" onto a 
drawing area by clicking on the drawing area. (The icons in this program are from the KDE 
desktop project.) Here is a picture of the program with several icons already stamped onto the 
drawing area and with the "light bulb" icon selected:

£ Undo 1 Redo 



Note that the scrollbar in this program is not part of the JList. To add a scrollbar to a list, 
the list must be placed into a JScrollPane. See Subsection 6.6.4, where the use of JScrollPane 
to hold a JTextArea was discussed. Scroll panes are used in the same way with lists and with 
other components. In this case, the JList, iconList, was added to a scroll pane and the scroll 
pane was added to a panel with the single command: 

add( new JScrollPane (iconList) , BorderLayout . EAST ); 

One way to construct a JList is from an array that contains the objects that will appear 
in the list. The items can be of any type, but only icons and strings can actually appear in 
the list; an item that is not of type Icon or String is converted into a string by calling its 
toStringO method. (It's possible to "teach" a JList to display other types of items; see the 
setCellRenderer () method in the JList class.) In the SillyStamper program, the images for 
the icons are read from resource files, the icons are placed into an array, and the array is used 
to construct the list. This is done by the following method: 

private JList createlconList () { 

String [] iconNames = new String [] { 

"icon5.png", "icon7.png", "icon8.png", "icon9.png", "iconlO.png" , 
"iconll .png" , "icon24.png" , "icon25 .png" , "icon26.png" , "icon31 .png" , 
"icon33.png" , "icon34.png" 

}; // Array containing resource file names for the icon images. 

iconlmages = new Image [iconNames . length] ; 

ClassLoader classLoader = getClassO .getClassLoaderO ; 
Toolkit toolkit = Toolkit .getDef aultToolkit () ; 

try { // Get the icon images from the resource files, 

for (int i = 0; i < iconNames . length; i++) { 

URL imageURL = classLoader .getResource("stamper_icons/" + iconNames [i] ) ; 
if (imageURL == null) 

throw new ExceptionO ; 
iconlmages [i] = toolkit . createlmage (imageURL) ; 

} 

} 

catch (Exception e) { 
iconlmages = null; 
return null ; 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



688 



> 

Imagelcon [] icons = new Imagelcon [iconlmages . length] ; 

for (int i = 0; i < iconlmages . length; i++) // Create the icons, 

icons [i] = new ImageIcon(iconImages [i] ) ; 

JList list = new JList (icons) ; // A list containing the image icons, 

list . setSelectionMode (ListSelectionModel . SINGLE_SELECTION) ; 

list . setSelectedlndex(O) ; // First item in the list is currently selected, 
return list; 

} 

By default, the user can select any number of items in a list. A single item is selected by 
clicking on it. Multiple items can be selected by shift-clicking and by either control-clicking or 
meta-clicking (depending on the platform). In the SillyStamper program, I wanted to restrict 
the selection so that only one item can be selected at a time. This restriction is imposed by 
calling 

list . setSelectionMode (ListSelectionModel . SINGLE_SELECTION) ; 

With this selection mode, when the user selects an item, the previously selected item, if 
any, is deselected. Note that the selection can be changed by the program by calling 
list . setSelectedlndex(itemNum) . Items are numbered starting from zero. To find out the 
currently selected item in single selection mode, call list .getSelectedlndexQ . This returns 
the item number of the selected item, or -1 if no item is currently selected. If multiple selec- 
tions are allowed, you can call list.getSelectedlndicesO, which returns an array of ints 
that contains the item numbers of all selected items. 

Now, the list that you see on the screen is only the view aspect of the list. The controller 
consists of the listener objects that respond when the user clicks an item in the list. For its 
model, a JList uses an object of type ListModel. This is the object that knows the actual list of 
items. Now, a model is defined not only by the data that it contains but by the set of operations 
that can be performed on the data. When a JList is constructed from an array of objects, the 
model that is used is very simple. The model can tell you how many items it contains and what 
those items are, but it can't do much else. In particular, there is no way to add items to the 
list or to delete items from the list! If you need that capability, you will have to use a different 
list model. 

The class DefaultListModel defines list models that support adding items to and removing 
items from the list. (Note that the list model that you get when you create a JList from an 
array is not of this type.) If dlmodel is of type DefaultListModel, the following methods, among 
others, are defined: 

• dlmodel. getSize() — returns the number of items. 

• dlmodel . getElement At (index) — returns the item at position index in the list. 

• dlmodel . addElement (item) — Adds item to the end of the list; item can be any Object. 

• dlmodel . insertElement At (item, index) — inserts the specified item into the list at 
the specified index; items that come after that position in the list are moved down to 
make room for the new item. 

• dlmodel . setElementAt (item, index) — Replaces the item that is currently at position 
index in the list with item. 

• dlmodel. remove (index) — removes the item at position index in the list. 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



689 



• dlmodel . removeAHElements () — removes everything from the list, leaving it empty. 

To use a modifiable JList, you should create a DefaultListModel, add any items to it that 
should be in the list initially, and pass it to the JList constructor. For example: 

DefaultListModel listModel; // Should probably be instance variables! 
JList flavorList; 

listModel = new Def aultListModel () ; // Create the model object. 

listModel. addElementC'Chocolate") ; // Add items to the model. 

listModel . addElement ( "Vanilla" ) ; 
listModel . addElement ( " Strawberry" ) ; 
listModel . addElement ( "Rum Raisin" ) ; 

flavorList = new JList (listModel) ; // Create the list component. 

By keeping a reference to the model around in an instance variable, you will be able to add and 
delete flavors as the program is running by calling the appropriate methods in listModel. Keep 
in mind that changes that are made to the model will automatically be reflected in the view. 
Behind the scenes, when a list model is modified, it generates an event of type ListDataEvent. 
The JList registers itself with its model as a listener for these events, and it responds to an 
event by redrawing itself to reflect the changes in the model. The programmer doesn't have to 
take any extra action, beyond changing the model. 

By the way, the model for a JList actually has another part in addition to the ListModel: An 
object of type ListSelection Model stores information about which items in the list are currently 
selected. When the model is complex, it's not uncommon to use several model objects to store 
different aspects of the state. 



13.4.3 Tables and TableModels 

Like a JList, a JTable displays a collection of items to the user. However, tables are much more 
complicated than lists. Perhaps the most important difference is that it is possible for the user 
to edit items in the table. Table items are arranged in a grid of rows and columns. Each grid 
position is called a cell of the table. Each column can have a header, which appears at the 
top of the column and contains a name for the column. 

It is easy to create a JTable from an array that contains the names of the columns and a 
two-dimensional array that contains the items that go into the cells of the table. As an example, 
the sample program StatesAndCapitalsTableDemo.java creates a table with two columns named 
"State" and "Capital City." The first column contains a list of the states of the United States 
and the second column contains the name of the capital city of each state. The table can be 
created as follows: 

String [] [] statesAndCapitals = new String [] [] { 
{ "Alabama", "Montgomery" }, 
{ "Alaska", "Juneau" }, 
{ "Arizona", "Phoenix" }, 



{ "Wisconsin", "Madison" }, 
{ "Wyoming", "Cheyenne" } 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



690 



String [] columnHeads = new String [] { "State", "Capital City" >; 

JTable table = new JTable (statesAndCapitals , columnHeads); 

Since a table does not come with its own scroll bars, it is almost always placed in a JScrollPane 
to make it possible to scroll the table. In the example program this is done with: 

add( new JScrollPane (table) , BorderLayout . CENTER ); 

The column headers of a JTable are not actually part of the table; they are in a separate 
component. But when you add the table to a JScrollPane, the column headers are automatically 
placed at the top of the pane. 

Using the default settings, the user can edit any cell in the table. (To select an item 
for editing, click it and start typing. The arrow keys can be used to move from one cell to 
another.) The user can change the order of the columns by dragging a column header to a new 
position. The user can also change the width of the columns by dragging the line that separates 
neighboring column headers. You can try all this in the sample program; there is an applet 
version in the on-line version of this section. 

Allowing the user to edit all entries in the table is not always appropriate; certainly it's not 
appropriate in the "states and capitals" example. A JTable uses an object of type TableModel 
to store information about the contents of the table. The model object is also responsible for 
deciding whether or not the user should be able to edit any given cell in the table. TableModel 
includes the method 

public boolean isCellEditable (int rowNum, columnNum) 

where rowNum and columnNum are the position of a cell in the grid of rows and columns that 
make up the table. When the controller wants to know whether a certain cell is editable, it 
calls this method in the table model. If the return value is true, the user is allowed to edit the 
cell. 

The default model that is used when the table is created, as above, from an array of objects 
allows editing of all cells. For this model, the return value of isCellEditable () is true in all 
cases. To make some cells non-editable, you have to provide a different model for the table. One 
way to do this is to create a subclass of DefaultTableModel and override the isCellEditable () 
method. (DefaultTableModel and some other classes that are discussed in this section are 
defined in the package javax. swing. table.) Here is how this might be done in the "states and 
capitals" program to make all cells non-editable: 

TableModel model = new DefaultTableModel (statesAndCapitals , columnHeads) { 
public boolean isCellEditable (int row, int col) { 
return false; 

} 

}; 

JTable table = new JTable (model) ; 

Here, an anonymous subclass of DefaultTableModel is created in which the isCellEditable () 
method returns false in all cases, and the model object that is created from that class is passed 
as a parameter to the JTable constructor. 

The DefaultTableModel class defines many methods that can be used to modify the table, 
including for example: setValueAt (item, rowNum, colNum) to change the item in a given cell; 
removeRow (rowNum) to delete a row; and addRow(itemArray) to add a new row at the end of 
the table that contains items from the array itemArray. Note that if the item in a given cell 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



691 



is null, then that cell will be empty. Remember, again, that when you modify the model, the 
view is automatically updated to reflect the changes. 

In addition to the isCellEditableO method, the table model method that you are most 
likely to want to override is getColumnClass () , which is defined as 

public Class<?> getColumnClass (columnNum) 

The purpose of this method is to specify what kind of values are allowed in the specified 
column. The return value from this method is of type Class. (The "<?>" is there for technical 
reasons having to do with generic programming. See Section 10.5, but don't worry about 
understanding it here.) Although class objects have crept into this book in a few places — 
in the discussion of ClassLoaders in Subsection 13.1.3 for example — this is the first time we 
have directly encountered the class named Class. An object of type Class represents a class. 
A Class object is usually obtained from the name of the class using expressions of the form 
"Double . class" or "JTable . class" . If you want a three-column table in which the column 
types are String, Double, and Boolean, you can use a table model in which getColumnClass is 
defined as: 

public Class<?> getColumnClass (columnNum) { 
if (columnNum == 0) 

return String . class ; 
else if (columnNum = 1) 

return Double . class ; 
else 

return Boolean. class; 

} 

The table will call this method and use the return value to decide how to display and edit 
items in the table. For example, if a column is specified to hold Boolean values, the cells in that 
column will be displayed and edited as check boxes. For numeric types, the table will not accept 
illegal input when the user types in the value. (It is possible to change the way that a table 
edits or displays items. See the methods setDef aultEditor () and setDef aultRenderer () in 
the JTable class.) 

As an alternative to using a subclass of DefaultTableModel, a custom table model can also 
be defined using a subclass of AbstractTableModel. Whereas DefaultTableModel provides a lot 
of predefined functionality, AbstractTableModel provides very little. However, using Abstract- 
TableModel gives you the freedom to represent the table data any way you want. The sample 
program ScatterPlotTableDemo.java uses a subclass of AbstractTableModel to define the model 
for a JTable. In this program, the table has three columns. The first column holds a row 
number and is not editable. The other columns hold values of type Double; these two columns 
represent the x- and y-coordinates of points in the plane. The points themselves are graphed in 
a "scatter plot" next to the table. Initially, the program fills in the first six points with random 
values. Here is a picture of the program, with the x-coordinate in row 5 selected for editing:

Note, by the way, that in this program, the scatter plot can be considered to be a view of 
the table model, in the same way that the table itself is. The scatter plot registers itself as a 
listener with the model, so that it will receive notification whenever the model changes. When 
that happens, the scatter plot redraws itself to reflect the new state of the model. It is an 
important property of the MVC pattern that several views can share the same model, offering 
alternative presentations of the same data. The views don't have to know about each other 
or communicate with each other except by sharing the model. Although I didn't do it in this 
program, it would even be possible to add a controller to the scatter plot view. This would let 
the user drag a point in the scatter plot to change its coordinates. Since the scatter plot and 
table share the same model, the values in the table would automatically change to match. 

Here is the definition of the class that defines the model in the scatter plot program. All 
the methods in this class must be defined in any subclass of AbstractTableModel except for 
setValueAt () , which only has to be defined if the table is modifiable. 

/** 

* This class defines the TableModel that is used for the JTable in this 

* program. The table has three columns. Column simply holds the 

* row number of each row. Column 1 holds the x-coordinates of the 

* points for the scatter plot, and Column 2 holds the y-coordinates . 

* The table has 25 rows. No support is provided for adding more rows. 
*/ 

private class CoordlnputTableModel extends AbstractTableModel { 

private Double!] xCoord = new Double [25] ; // Data for Column 1. 
private Double!] yCoord = new Double [25] ; // Data for Column 2. 

// Initially, all the values in the array are null, which means 

// that all the cells are empty. 

public int getColumnCount () { // Tells caller how many columns there are. 
return 3; 

> 

public int getRowCount () { // Tells caller how many rows there are. 
return xCoord. length; 

> 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



693 



public Object get Value At (int row, int col) { // Get value from cell, 
if (col == 0) 

return (row+1) ; // Column holds the row number, 

else if (col == 1) 

return xCoord [row] ; // Column 1 holds the x-coordinates . 
else 

return yCoord[row]; // Column 2 holds the y-coordinates . 

> 

public Class<?> getColumnClass (int col) { // Get data type of column, 
if (col == 0) 

return Integer . class ; 
else 

return Double . class ; 

> 

public String getColumnName (int col) { // Returns a name for column header, 
if (col == 0) 

return "Num"; 
else if (col == 1) 

return "X"; 
else 

return "Y"; 

} 

public boolean isCellEditable (int row, int col) { // Can user edit cell? 
return col > 0; 

> 

public void setValueAt (Object obj , int row, int col) { 

// (This method is called by the system if the value of the cell 
// needs to be changed because the user has edited the cell. 
//It can also be called to change the value programmatically . 
//In this case, only columns 1 and 2 can be modified, and the data 
// type for obj must be Double. The method f ireTableCellUpdatedO 
// has to be called to send an event to registered listeners to 
// notify them of the modification to the table model.) 

if (col == 1) 

xCoord[row] = (Double)obj; 

else if (col == 2) 

yCoord[row] = (Double)obj; 

f ireTableCellUpdated(row, col); 

} 

} // end nested class CoordlnputTableModel 

In addition to defining a custom table model, I customized the appearance of the table in 
several ways. Because this involves changes to the view, most of the changes are made by calling 
methods in the JTable object. For example, since the default height of the cells was too small 
for my taste, I called table . setRowHeight (25) to increase the height. To make lines appear 
between the rows and columns, I found that I had to call both table . setShowGrid(true) 
and table . setGridColor (Color . BLACK) . Some of the customization has to be done to other 
objects. For example, to prevent the user from changing the order of the columns by dragging 
the column headers, I had to use 

table. getTableHeader () . setReorderingAllowed(f alse) ; 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



694 



Tables are quite complex, and I have only discussed a part of the table API here. Nevertheless, 
I hope that you have learned enough to start using them and to learn more about them on your 
own. 

13.4.4 Documents and Editors 

As a final example of complex components, we look briefly at JTextComponent and its sub- 
classes. A JTextComponent displays text that can, optionally, be edited by the user. Two 
subclasses, JTextField and JTextArea, were introduced in Subsection 6.6.4. But the real com- 
plexity comes in another subclass, JEditorPane, that supports display and editing of styled text. 
This allows features such as boldface and italic. A JEditorPane can even work with basic HTML 
documents. 

It is almost absurdly easy to write a simple web browser program using a JEditorPane. This 
is done in the sample program SimpleWebBrowser.java. In this program, the user enters the 
URL of a web page, and the program tries to load and display the web page at that location. 
A JEditorPane can handle pages with content type "text /plain" , "text/html", and "text/rtf. 
(The content type "text/rtf represents styled or "rich text format" text. URLs and content 
types were covered in Subsection 11.4.1.) If editPane is of type JEditorPane and url is of type 
URL, then the statement "editPane . setPage (url) ;" is sufficient to load the page and display 
it. Since this can generate an exception, the following method is used in SimpleWebBrowser.java 
to display a page: 

private void loadURL(URL url) { 
try { 

editPane . setPage (url) ; 

} 

catch (Exception e) { 

editPane. setContentType ( "text/plain" ) ; // Set pane to display plain text. 
editPane . setText ( "Sorry, the requested document was not found\n" 
+"or cannot be displayed. \n\nError : " + e) ; 

> 

} 

An HTML document can include links to other pages. When the user clicks on a link, the 
web browser should go to the linked page. A JEditorPane does not do this automatically, but 
it does generate an event of type HyperLinkEvent when the user clicks a link (provided that the 
edit pane has been set to be non-editable by the user). A program can register a listener for 
such events and respond by loading the new page. 

There are a lot of web pages that a JEditorPane won't be able to display correctly, but it 
can be very useful in cases where you have control over the pages that will be displayed. A 
nice application is to distribute HTML-format help and information files with a program. The 
files can be stored as resource files in the jar file of the program, and a URL for a resource 
file can be obtained in the usual way, using the getResource () method of a ClassLoader. (See 
Subsection 13.1.3.) 

It turns out, by the way, that SimpleWebBrowser.java is a little too simple. A modified 
version, SimpleWebBrowserWithThread.java, improves on the original by using a thread to 
load a page and by checking the content type of a page before trying to load it. It actually does 
work as a simple web browser. 

The model for a JTextComponent is an object of type Document. If you want to be notified 
of changes in the model, you can add a listener to the model using 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



695 



textComponent . getDocument () . addDocumentListener (listener) 

where textComponent is of type JTextComponent and listener is of type DocumentListener. 
The Document class also has methods that make it easy to read a document from a file and 
write a document to a file. I won't discuss all the things you can do with text components here. 
For one more peek at their capabilities, see the sample program SimpleRTFEdit.java, a very 
minimal editor for files that contain styled text of type "text/rtf." 

13.4.5 Custom Components 

Java's standard component classes are usually all you need to construct a user interface. At 
some point, however, you might need a component that Java doesn't provide. In that case, 
you can write your own component class, building on one of the components that Java does 
provide. We've already done this, actually, every time we've written a subclass of the JPanel 
class to use as a drawing surface. A JPanel is a blank slate. By defining a subclass, you can 
make it show any picture you like, and you can program it to respond in any way to mouse and 
keyboard events. Sometimes, if you are lucky, you don't need such freedom, and you can build 
on one of Java's more sophisticated component classes. 

For example, suppose I have a need for a "stopwatch" component. When the user clicks 
on the stopwatch, I want it to start timing. When the user clicks again, I want it to display 
the elapsed time since the first click. The textual display can be done with a JLabel, but 
we want a JLabel that can respond to mouse clicks. We can get this behavior by defining a 
StopWatchLabel component as a subclass of the JLabel class. A StopWatchLabel object will 
listen for mouse clicks on itself. The first time the user clicks, it will change its display to 
"Timing..." and remember the time when the click occurred. When the user clicks again, it 
will check the time again, and it will compute and display the elapsed time. (Of course, I don't 
necessarily have to define a subclass. I could use a regular label in my program, set up a listener 
to respond to mouse events on the label, and let the program do the work of keeping track of 
the time and changing the text displayed on the label. However, by writing a new class, I 
have something that can be reused in other projects. I also have all the code involved in the 
stopwatch function collected together neatly in one place. For more complicated components, 
both of these considerations are very important.) 

The StopWatchLabel class is not very hard to write. I need an instance variable to record 
the time when the user starts the stopwatch. Times in Java are measured in milliseconds and 
are stored in variables of type long (to allow for very large values). In the mousePressedO 
method, I need to know whether the timer is being started or stopped, so I need a boolean 
instance variable, running, to keep track of this aspect of the component's state. There is 
one more item of interest: How do I know what time the mouse was clicked? The method 
System. currentTimeMillis () returns the current time. But there can be some delay between 
the time the user clicks the mouse and the time when the mousePressedO routine is called. 
To make my stopwatch as accurate as possible, I don't want to know the current time. I want 
to know the exact time when the mouse was pressed. When I wrote the StopWatchLabel class, 
this need sent me on a search in the Java documentation. I found that if evt is an object of 
type MouseEvent, then the function evt .getWhenO returns the time when the event occurred. 
I call this function in the mousePressedO routine to determine the exact time when the user 
clicked on the label. The complete StopWatch class is rather short: 

import j ava . awt . event . * ; 
import j avax . swing . * ; 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



696 



/** 

* A custom component that acts as a simple stop-watch. When the user clicks 

* on it, this component starts timing. When the user clicks again, 

* it displays the time between the two clicks. Clicking a third time 

* starts another timer, etc. While it is timing, the label just 

* displays the message "Timing. . . . " . 
*/ 

public class StopWatchLabel extends JLabel implements MouseListener { 

private long startTime; // Start time of timer. 

// (Time is measured in milliseconds.) 

private boolean running; // True when the timer is running. 

/**

* "Click to start timer." and sets up a mouse listener

public StopWatchLabel () { 

super (" Click to start timer. ", JLabel . CENTER) ; 
addMouseListener (this) ; 

} 

/** 

* Tells whether the timer is currently running.

public boolean isRunningO { 
return running;

} 

else { 

// Stop the timer. Compute the elapsed time since the

running = false; 
long endTime = evt . getWhenO ;

Don't forget that since StopWatchLabel is a subclass of JLabel, you can do anything with a 
StopWatch Label that you can do with a JLabel. You can add it to a container. You can set its 
font, foreground color, and background color. You can set the text that it displays (although 
this would interfere with its stopwatch function). You can even add a Border if you want. 

Let's look at one more example of defining a custom component. Suppose that — for no 
good reason whatsoever — I want a component that acts like a JLabel except that it displays 
its text in mirror-reversed form. Since no standard component does anything like this, the 
MirrorText class is defined as a subclass of JPanel. It has a constructor that specifies the text to 
be displayed and a setText () method that changes the displayed text. The paintComponent () 
method draws the text mirror-reversed, in the center of the component. This uses techniques 
discussed in Subsection 13.1.1 and Subsection 13.2.1. Information from a FontMetrics object 
is used to center the text in the component. The reversal is achieved by using an off-screen 
canvas. The text is drawn to the off-screen canvas, in the usual way. Then the image is copied 
to the screen with the following command, where OSC is the variable that refers to the off-screen 
canvas, and width and height give the size of both the component and the off-screen canvas: 

g.drawImage(OSC, width, 0, 0, height, 0, 0, width, height, this); 

This is the version of drawlmage() that specifies corners of destination and source rect- 
angles. The corner (0,0) in OSC is matched to the corner (width, 0) on the screen, while 
(width, height) is matched to (0, height). This reverses the image left-to-right. Here is the 
complete class: 

import j ava . awt . * ; 

import j avax . swing . * ; 

import java. awt . image . Buf f eredlmage ; 

/** 

* A component for displaying a mirror-reversed line of text. 

* The text will be centered in the available space. This component 

* is defined as a subclass of JPanel. It respects any background 

* color, foreground color, and font that are set for the JPanel. 

* The setText (String) method can be used to change the displayed 

* text. Changing the text will also call revalidate () on this 

* component .

> 

} // end MirrorText 

This class defines the method "public Dimension getPreferredSizeO". This method is 
called by a layout manager when it wants to know how big the component would like to be. 
Standard components come with a way of computing a preferred size. For a custom component 
based on a JPanel, it's a good idea to provide a custom preferred size. Every component has 
a method setPref erredSize () that can be used to set the preferred size of the component. 
For our MirrorText component, however, the preferred size depends on the font and the text 
of the component, and these can change from time to time. We need a way to compute a 
preferred size on demand, based on the current font and text. That's what we do by defining 
a getPreferredSizeO method. The system calls this method when it wants to know the 
preferred size of the component. In response, we can compute the preferred size based on the 
current font and text. 

The StopWatch Label and MirrorText classes define components. Components don't stand 
on their own. You have to add them to a panel or other container. The sample program 
CustomComponent Test Java demonstrates using a MirrorText and a StopWatch Label compo- 
nent, which are defined by the source code files MirrorText .java and StopWatchLabel.java. 

In this program, the two custom components and a button are added to a panel that uses 
a Flow/Layout as its layout manager, so the components are not arranged very neatly. If you 
click the button labeled "Change Text in this Program", the text in all the components will 
be changed. You can also click on the stopwatch label to start and stop the stopwatch. When 
you do any of these things, you will notice that the components will be rearranged to take the 
new sizes into account. This is known as "validating" the container. This is done automatically 
when a standard component changes in some way that requires a change in preferred size or 
location. This may or may not be the behavior that you want. (Validation doesn't always 
cause as much disruption as it does in this program. For example, in a GridLayout, where all 
the components are displayed at the same size, it will have no effect at all. I chose a FlowLayout 
for this example to make the effect more obvious.) When the text is changed in a MirrorText 
component, there is no automatic validation of its container. A custom component such as 
MirrorText must call the revalidate () method to indicate that the container that contains 
the component should be validated. In the MirrorText class, revalidate () is called in the 
setTextO method. 

13.5 Finishing Touches 

In THIS FINAL SECTION, I will present a program that is more complex and more polished (online) 

than those we have looked at previously. Most of the examples in this book have been "toy" 

programs that illustrated one or two points about programming techniques. It's time to put it 

all together into a full-scale program that uses many of the techniques that we have covered, 

and a few more besides. After discussing the program and its basic design, I'll use it as an 

excuse to talk briefly about some of the features of Java that didn't fit into the rest of this 

book. 

The program that we will look at is a Mandelbrot Viewer that lets the user explore the 
famous Mandelbrot set. I will begin by explaining what that means. If you have downloaded 
the web version of this book, note that the jar file MandelbrotViewer . jar is an executable jar 
file that you can use to run the program as a stand-alone application. The jar file is in the 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



700 



directory cl3, which contains all the files for this chapter. The on-line version of this page has 
two applet versions of the program. One shows the program running on the web page. The 
other applet appears on the web page as a button; clicking the button opens the program in a 
separate window. 

13.5.1 The Mandelbrot Set 

The Mandelbrot set is a set of points in the xy-plane that is defined by a computational 
procedure. To use the program, all you really need to know is that the Mandelbrot set can be 
used to make some pretty pictures, but here are the mathematical details: Consider the point 
that has real- number coordinates (a,b) and apply the following computation: 

Let x = a 
Let y = b 
Repeat : 

Let newX = x*x - y*y + a 

Let newY = 2*x*y + b 

Let x = newX 

Let y = newY 

As the loop is repeated, the point (x,y) changes. The question is, does (x,y) grow without 
bound or is it trapped forever in a finite region of the plane? If (x,y) escapes to infinity (that 
is, grows without bound), then the starting point (a,b) is not in the Mandelbrot set. If (x,y) 
is trapped in a finite region, then (a,b) is in the Mandelbrot set. Now, it is known that if 
x 2 + y 2 ever becomes strictly greater than 4, then (x,y) will escape to infinity. If x 2 + y 2 ever 
becomes bigger than 4 in the above loop, we can end the loop and say that (a,b) is definitely 
not in the Mandelbrot set. For a point (a,b) in the Mandelbrot set, the loop will never end. 
When we do this on a computer, of course, we don't want to have a loop that runs forever, so 
we put a limit on the number of times that the loop is executed: 

x = a; 
y = b; 
count = ; 

while ( x*x + y*y < 4.1 ) { 
count++; 

if (count > maxlterations) 
break; 

double newX = x*x - y*y + a; 
double newY = 2*x*y + b; 
x = newY; 
y = newY; 

} 

After this loop ends, if count is less than or equal to maxlterations, we can say that (a,b) is 
not in the Mandelbrot set. If count is greater than maxlterations, then (a,b) might or might 
not be in the Mandelbrot set, but the larger maxlterations is, the more likely that (a,b) is 
actually in the set. 

To make a picture from this procedure, use a rectangular grid of pixels to represent some 
rectangle in the plane. Each pixel corresponds to some real number coordinates (a,b). (Use 
the coordinates of the center of the pixel.) Run the above loop for each pixel. If the count goes 
past maxlterations, color the pixel black; this is a point that is possibly in the Mandelbrot set. 
Otherwise, base the color of the pixel on the value of count after the loop ends, using different 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



701 



colors for different counts. In some sense, the higher the count, the closer the point is to the 
Mandelbrot set, so the colors give some information about points outside the set and about 
the shape of the set. However, it's important to understand that the colors are arbitrary and 
that colored points are not in the set. Here is a picture that was produced by the Mandelbrot 
Viewer program using this computation. The black region is the Mandelbrot set: 



When you use the program, you can "zoom in" on small regions of the plane. To do so, just 
drag the mouse on the picture. This will draw a rectangle around part of the picture. When 
you release the mouse, the part of the picture inside the rectangle will be zoomed to fill the 
entire display. If you simply click a point in the picture, you will zoom in on the point where 
you click by a magnification factor of two. (Shift-click or use the right mouse button to zoom 
out instead of zooming in.) The interesting points are along the boundary of the Mandelbrot 
set. In fact, the boundary is infinitely complex. (Note that if you zoom in too far, you will 
exceed the capabilities of the double data type; nothing is done in the program to prevent this.) 

Use the "Maxlterations" menu to increase the maximum number of iterations in the loop. 
Remember that black pixels might or might not be in the set; when you increase "Maxlter- 
ations," you might find that a black region becomes filled with color. The "Palette" menu 
determines the set of colors that are used. Different palettes give very different visualizations 
of the set. The "PaletteLength" menu determines how many different colors are used. In the 
default setting, a different color is used for each possible value of count in the algorithm. Some- 
times, you can get a much better picture by using a different number of colors. If the palette 
length is less than maxlterations, the palette is repeated to cover all the possible values of 
count; if the palette length is greater than maxlterations, only part of of the palette will be 
used. (If the picture is of an almost uniform color, try decreasing the palette length, since that 
makes the color vary more quickly as count changes. If you see what look like randomly colored 
dots instead of bands of color, try increasing the palette length.) 

If you run the Mandelbrot Viewer program as a stand-alone application, it will have a "File" 
menu that can be used to save the picture as a PNG image file. You can also save a "param" 
file which simply saves the settings that produced the current picture. A param file can be read 
back into the program using the "Open" command. 

The Mandelbrot set is named after Benoit Mandelbrot, who was the first person to note the 
incredible complexity of the set. It is astonishing that such complexity and beauty can arise 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING

out of such a simple algorithm. 
13.5.2 Design of the Program 

Most classes in Java are defined in packages. While we have used standard packages such as 
javax. swing and java.io extensively, almost all of my programming examples have been in 
the "default package," which means that they are not declared to belong to any named package. 
However, when doing more serious programming, it is good style to create a package to hold 
the classes for your program. The Oracle corporation recommends that package names should 
be based on an Internet domain name of the organization that produces the package. My office 
computer has domain name eck.hws.edu, and no other computer in the world should have 
the same name. According to Oracle, this allows me to use the package name edu.hws . eck, 
with the elements of the domain name in reverse order. I can also use sub-packages of this 
package, such as edu.hws.eck.mdb, which is the package name that I decided to use for my 
Mandelbrot Viewer application. No one else — or at least no one else who uses the same naming 
convention — will ever use the same package name, so this package name uniquely identifies my 
program. 

I briefly discussed using packages in Subsection 2.6.4 and in the context of the programming 
examples in Section 12.5 Here's what you need to know for the Mandelbrot Viewer program: 
The program is defined in ten Java source code files. They can be found in the directory 
edu/hws/eck/mdb inside the source directory of the web site. (That is, they are in a directory 
named mdb, which is inside a directory named eck, which is inside hws, which is inside edu. 
The directory structure must follow the package name in this way.) The same directory also 
contains a file named strings. properties that is used by the program and that will be discussed 
below. For an Integrated Development Environment such as Eclipse, you should just have to 
add the edu directory to your project. To compile the files on the command line, you must be 
working in the directory that contains the edu directory. Use the command 

javac edu/hws/eck/mdb/* . java 

or, if you use Windows, 

javac edu\hws\eck\mdb\* . java 

to compile the source code. The main routine for the stand-alone application version of the 
program is defined by a class named Main. To run this class, use the command: 

java edu. hws. eck. mdb. Main 

This command must also be given in the directory that contains the edu directory. 

* * * 

The work of computing and displaying images of the Mandelbrot set is done in 
MandelbrotDisplayjava. The MandelbrotDisplay class is a subclass of JPanel. It uses an off- 
screen canvas to hold a copy of the image. (See Subsection 13.1.1.) The paintComponent () 
method copies this image onto the panel. Then, if the user is drawing a "zoom box" with the 
mouse, the zoom box is drawn on top of the image. In addition to the image, the class uses 
a two-dimensional array to store the iteration count for each pixel in the image. If the range 
of xy-values changes, or if the size of the window changes, all the counts must be recomputed. 
Since the computation can take quite a while, it would not be acceptable to block the user 
interface while the computation is being performed. The solution is to do the computation in 
separate "worker" threads, as discussed in Chapter 12. The program uses one worker thread 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



703 



for each available processor. When the computation begins, the image is filled with gray. Every 
so often, about twice a second, the data that has been computed by the computation threads is 
gathered and applied to the off-screen canvas, and the part of the canvas that has been modified 
is copied to the screen. A Timer is used to control this process — each time the timer fires, the 
image is updated with any new data that has been computed by the threads. The user can 
continue to use the menus and even the mouse while the image is being computed. 

The file MandelbrotPanel.java defines the main panel of the Mandelbrot Viewer window. 
MandelbrotPanel is another subclass of JPanel. A MandelbrotPanel is mostly filled with a Man- 
delbrotDisplay. It also adds a JLabel beneath the display. The JLabel is used as a "status bar" 
that shows some information that might be interesting to the user. The MandelbrotPanel also 
defines the program's mouse listener. In addition to handling zooming, the mouse listener puts 
the x and y coordinates of the current mouse location in the status bar as the user moves or 
drags the mouse. Also, when the mouse exits the drawing area, the text in the status bar is 
set to read "Idle". This is the first time that we have seen an actual use for mouseMoved and 
mouseExited events. (See Subsection 6.4.2 and Subsection 6.4.4.) 

The menu bar for the program is defined in Menus.java. Commands in the "File" and 
"Control" menu are defined as Actions. (See Subsection 13.3.1.) Note that among the actions are 
file manipulation commands that use techniques from Subsection 11.2.3, Subsection 11.5.3, and 
Subsection 13.1.5. The "Maxlterations," "Palette," and "PaletteLength" menus each contain a 
group of JRadioButtonMenultems. (See Subsection 13.3.3.) I have tried several approaches for 
handling such groups, and none of them have satisfied me completely. In this program, I have 
defined a nested class inside Menus to represent each group. For example, the PaletteManager 
class contains the menu items in the "Palette" menu as instance variables. It registers an action 
listener with each item, and it defines a few utility routines for operating on the menu. The 
classes for the three menus are very similar and should probably have been defined as subclasses 
of some more general class. 

One interesting point is that the contents of the menu bar are different, depending on 
whether the program is being run as an applet or as a stand-alone application. Since applets 
cannot access the file system, there is no "File" menu for an applet. Furthermore, accelerator 
keys are generally not functional in an applet that is running on a web page, so accelerator 
keys are only added to menu items if the program is being run in its own window. (See 
Subsection 13.3.5 for information on accelerators.) To accomplish this, the constructor in the 
Menus class has parameters that tell it whether the menu bar will be used by an applet and 
whether it will be used in a frame; these parameters are consulted as the menu bar is being 
built. 

A third parameter to the constructor is the MandelbrotPanel that is being used in the 
program. Many of the menu commands operate on this panel or on the MandelbrotDisplay that 
it contains. In order to carry out these commands, the Menus object needs a reference to the 
MandelbrotPanel. As for the MandelbrotDisplay, the panel has a method getDisplayO that 
returns a reference to the display that it contains. So as long as the menu bar has a reference 
to the panel, it can obtain a reference to the display. In previous examples, everything was 
written as one large class file, so all the objects were directly available to all the code. When a 
program is made up of multiple interacting files, getting access to the necessary objects can be 
more of a problem. 

MandelbrotPanel, MandelbrotDisplay, and Menus are the main classes that make up the 
Mandelbrot Viewer program. MandelbrotFrame.java defines a simple subclass of JFrame that 
runs the program in its own window. Mandelbrot Applet Java defines an applet that runs the 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



704 



program on a web page. (This applet version has an extra "Examples" menu that is discussed 
in the source code file.) There are a few other classes that I will discuss below. 

This brief discussion of the design of the Mandelbrot Viewer has shown that it uses a wide 
variety of techniques that were covered earlier in this book. In the rest of this section, we'll 
look at a few new features of Java that were used in the program. 

13.5.3 Internationalization 

Internationalization refers to writing a program that is easy to adapt for running in different 
parts of the world. Internationalization is often referred to as II 8n, where 18 is the number of 
letters between the "I" and the final "n" in "Internationalization." The process of adapting the 
program to a particular location is called localization, and the locations are called locales. 
Locales differ in many ways, including the type of currency used and the format used for 
numbers and dates, but the most obvious difference is language. Here, I will discuss how to 
write a program so that it can be easily translated into other languages. 

The key idea is that strings that will be presented to the user should not be coded into 
the program source code. If they were, then a translator would have to search through the 
entire source code, replacing every string with its translation. Then the program would have 
to be recompiled. In a properly internationalized program, all the strings are stored together 
in one or more files that are separate from the source code, where they can easily be found and 
translated. And since the source code doesn't have to be modified to do the translation, no 
recompilation is necessary. 

To implement this idea, the strings are stored in one or more properties files . A properties 
file is just a list of key/value pairs. For translation purposes, the values are strings that will be 
presented to the user; these are the strings that have to be translated. The keys are also strings, 
but they don't have to be translated because they will never be presented to the user. Since 
they won't have to be modified, the key strings can be used in the program source code. Each 
key uniquely identifies one of the value strings. The program can use the key string to look up 
the corresponding value string from the properties file. The program only needs to know the 
key string; the user will only see the value string. When the properties file is translated, the 
user of the program will see different value strings. 

The format of a properties file is very simple. The key/value pairs take the form 

key . string=value string 

There are no spaces in the key string or before the equals sign. The value string can contain 
spaces or any other characters. If the line ends with a backslash ("\"), the value string is 
continued on the next line; in this case, spaces at the beginning of that line are ignored. One 
unfortunate detail is that a properties file can contain only plain ASCII characters. The ASCII 
character set only supports the English alphabet. Nevertheless, a value string can include 
arbitrary UNICODE characters. Non- ASCII characters just have to be specially encoded. The 
JDK comes with a program, native2ascii, that can convert files that use non-ASCII characters 
into a form that is suitable for use as a properties file. 

Suppose that the program wants to present a string to the user (as the name of a menu 
command, for example). The properties file would contain a key/value pair such as 

menu. saveimage=Save PNG Image... 

where "Save PNG Image. . . " is the string that will appear in the menu. The program would 
use the key string, "menu.saveimage" , to look up the corresponding value string and would then 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



705 



use the value string as the text of the menu item. In Java, the look up process is supported 
by the ResourceBundle class, which knows how to retrieve and use properties files. Sometimes 
a string that is presented to the user contains substrings that are not known until the time 
when the program is running. A typical example is the name of a file. Suppose, for example, 
that the program wants to tell the user, "Sorry, the file, filename, cannot be loaded", where 
filename is the name of a file that was selected by the user at run time. To handle cases like 
this, value strings in properties files can include placeholders that will be replaced by strings 
to be determined by the program at run time. The placeholders take the form "{0}", "{1}", 
"{2}" , . . . . For the file error example, the properties file might contain: 

error . cantLoad=Sorry, the file, {0}, cannot be loaded 

The program would fetch the value string for the key error . cantLoad. It would then substitute 
the actual file name for the placeholder, "{0}". Note that when the string is translated, the 
word order might be completely different. By using a placeholder for the file name, you can be 
sure that the file name will be put in the correct grammatical position for the language that is 
being used. Placeholder substitution is not handled by the ResourceBundle class, but Java has 
another class, MessageFormat, that makes such substitutions easy. 

For the Mandelbrot Viewer program, the properties file is strings. properties. (Any properties 
file should have a name that ends in ".properties".) Any string that you see when you run 
the program comes from this file. For handling value string lookup, I wrote I18n.java. The I18n 
class has a static method 

public static tr( String key, Object... args ) 

that handles the whole process. Here, key is the key string that will be looked up in 
strings .properties. Additional parameters, if any, will be substituted for placeholders in 
the value string. (Recall that the formal parameter declaration "Object ..." means that there 
can be any number of actual parameters after key; see Subsection 7.2.6.) Typical uses would 
include: 

String savelmageCommandText = I18n.tr( "menu. saveimage" ); 

String errMess = I18n.tr( "error . cantLoad" , selectedFile.getNameO ); 

You will see function calls like this throughout the Mandelbrot Viewer source code. The I18n 
class is written in a general way so that it can be used in any program. As long as you provide 
a properties file as a resource, the only things you need to do are change the resource file name 
in I18n. java and put the class in your own package. 

It is actually possible to provide several alternative properties files in the same pro- 
gram. For example, you might include French and Japanese versions of the properties file 
along with an English version. If the English properties file is named strings .properties, 
then the names for the French and Japanese versions should be strings_fr .properties and 
strings.j a. properties. Every language has a two-letter code, such as "fr" and "ja", that is 
used in constructing properties file names for that language. The program asks for the proper- 
ties file using the simple name "strings" . If the program is being run on a Java system in which 
the preferred language is French, the program will try to load "strings_fr .properties" ; if 
that fails, it will look for "strings .properties". This means that the program will use the 
French properties files in a French locale; it will use the Japanese properties file in a Japanese 
locale; and in any other locale it will use the default properties file.

13.5.4 Events, Events, Events 

We have worked extensively with mouse events, key events, and action events, but these are 
only a few of the event types that are used in Java. The Mandelbrot Viewer program makes use 
of several other types of events. It also serves as an example of the benefits of event-oriented 
programming. 

Let's start from the following fact: The MandelbrotDisplay class knows nothing about any 
of the other classes that make up the program (with the single exception of one call to the 
internationalization method I18n.tr). Yet other classes are aware of things that are going on 
in the MandelbrotDisplay class. For example, when the size of the display is changed, the new size 
is reported in the status bar that is part of the MandelbrotPanel class. In the Menus class, certain 
menus are disabled when the display begins the computation of an image and are re-enabled 
when the computation completes. The display doesn't call methods in the MandelbrotPanel 
or Menus classes, so how do these classes get their information about what is going on in the 
display? The answer, of course, is events. The MandelbrotDisplay object emits events of various 
types when various things happen. The MandelbrotPanel and MandelbrotDisplay objects set up 
listeners that hear those events and respond to them. 

The point is that because events are used for communication, the MandelbrotDisplay class is 
not strongly coupled to the other classes. In fact, it can be used in other programs without any 
modification and without access to the other classes. The alternative to using events would be to 
have the display object call methods such as displaySizeChangedQ or computationStartedO 
in the MandelbrotPanel and MandelbrotFrame objects to tell them what is going on in the display. 
This would be strong coupling: Any programmer who wanted to use MandelbrotDisplay would 
also have to use the other two classes or would have to modify the display class so that it no 
longer refers to the other classes. Of course, not everything can be done with events and not 
all strong coupling is bad: The MandelbrotPanel class refers directly to the MandelbrotDisplay 
class and cannot be used without it — but since the whole purpose of a MandelbrotPanel is to 
hold a MandelbrotDisplay, the coupling is not a problem. 

* * * 

The Mandelbrot Viewer program responds to mouse events on the display. These events 
are generated by the display object, but the display class itself doesn't care about mouse events 
and doesn't do anything in response to them. Mouse events are handled by a listener in 
the MandelbrotPanel, which responds to them by zooming the display and by showing mouse 
coordinates in the status bar. 

The status bar also shows the new size of the display whenever that size is changed. To 
handle this, events of type ComponentEvent are used. When the size of a component is changed, 
a ComponentEvent is generated. In the Mandelbrot Viewer program, a ComponentListener in 
the MandelbrotPanel class listens for size-change events in the display. When one occurs, the 
listener responds by showing the new size in the status bar; the display knows nothing about 
the status bar that shows the display's size. 

Component events are also used internally in the MandelbrotDisplay class in an interesting 
way. When the user dynamically changes the size of the display, its size can change several 
times each second. Normally, a change of display size would trigger the creation of a new off- 
screen canvas and the start of a new asynchronous computation of the image. However, doing 
this is a big deal, not something I want to do several times in a second. If you try resizing the 
program's window, you'll notice that the image doesn't change size dynamically as the window 
size changes. The same image and off-screen canvas are used as long as the size is changing. 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



707 



Only about one-third of a second after the size has stopped changing will a new, resized image 
be produced. Here is how this works: The display sets up a ComponentEvent to listen for resize 
events on itself. When a resize occurs, the listener starts a Timer that has a delay of 1/3 second. 
(See Subsection 6.5.1.) While this timer is running, the paintComponent () method does not 
resize the image; instead, it reuses the image that already exists. If the timer fires 1/3 second 
later, the image will be resized at that time. However, if another resize event occurs while the 
first timer is running, then the first timer will be stopped before it has a chance to fire, and a 
new timer will be started with a delay of 1/3 second. The result is that the image does not get 
resized until 1/3 second after the size of the window stops changing. 

The Mandelbrot Viewer program also uses events of type WindowEvent, which are gener- 
ated by a window when it opens or closes (among other things). One example is in the file 
Launcher Applet Java. This file defines an applet that appears as a button on the web page. 
The button is labeled "Launch Mandelbrot Viewer" . When the user clicks the button, a Man- 
delbrotFrame is opened on the screen, and the text on the button changes to "Close Mandelbrot 
Viewer". When the frame closes, the button changes back to "Launch Mandelbrot Viewer", 
and the button can be used to open another window. The frame can be closed by clicking 
the button, but it can also be closed using a "Close" command in the frame's menu bar or by 
clicking the close box in the frame's title bar. The question is, how does the button's text get 
changed when the frame is closed by one of the latter two methods? One possibility would 
be to have the frame call a method in the applet to tell the applet that it is closing, but that 
would tightly couple the frame class to the applet class. In fact, it's done with WindowEvents. 
A Window/Listener in the applet listens for close events from the frame. In response to a close 
event, the text of the button is changed. Again, this can happen even though the frame class 
knows nothing about the applet class. Window events are also used by Main.java to trigger an 
action that has to be taken when the program is ending; this will be discussed below. 

Perhaps the most interesting use of events in the Mandelbrot Viewer program is to enable 
and disable menu commands based on the status of the display. For this, events of type Prop- 
ertyChangeEvent are used. This event class is part of the "bean" framework that was discussed 
briefly in Subsection 11.5.2, and class PropertyChangeEvent and related classes are defined in 
the package java. beans. The idea is that bean objects are defined by their "properties" (which 
are just aspects of the state of the bean). When a bean property changes, the bean can emit 
a PropertyChangeEvent to notify other objects of the change. Properties for which property 
change events are emitted are known technically as bound properties. A bound property has 
a name that identifies that particular property among all the properties of the bean. When 
a property change event is generated, the event object includes the name of the property that 
has changed, the previous value of the property, and the new value of the property. 

The MandelbrotDisplay class has a bound property whose name is given by the constant 
MandelbrotDisplay . STATUS_PROPERTY. A display emits a property change event when its sta- 
tus changes. The possible values of the status property are given by other constants, such 
as MandelbrotDisplay . STATUS_READY. The READY status indicates that the display is not cur- 
rently running a computation and is ready to do another one. There are several menu commands 
that should be enabled only when the status of the display is READY. To implement this, the 
Menus class defines a Property ChangeUstener to listen for property change events from the dis- 
play. When this listener hears an event, it responds by enabling or disabling menu commands 
according to the new value of the status property. 

All of Java's GUI components are beans and are capable of emitting property change events. 
In any subclass of Component, this can be done simply by calling the method 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



708 



public void firePropertyChange (String propertyName , 

Object oldValue, Object newValue) 

For example, the MandelbrotDisplay class uses the following method for setting its current status: 

private void setStatus (String status) { 
if (status == this. status) { 

// Note: Event should be fired only if status actually changes, 
return; 

} 

String oldStatus = this. status; 
this. status = status; 

firePropertyChange (STATUS_PROPERTY, oldStatus, status); 

} 

When writing bean classes from scratch, you have to add support for property change events, 
if you need them. To make this easier, the java. beans package provides the PropertyChange- 
Support class. 

13.5.5 Custom Dialogs 

Java has several standard dialog boxes that are defined in the classes JOptionPane, JColor- 
Chooser, and JFileChooser. These were introduced in Subsection 6.8.2 and Subsection 11.2.3. 
Dialogs of all these types are used in the Mandelbrot Viewer program. However, sometimes 
other types of dialog are needed. In such cases, you can build a custom dialog box. 

Dialog boxes are defined by subclasses of the class JDialog. Like frames, dialog boxes are 
separate windows on the screen, and the JDialog class is very similar to the JFrame class. The 
big difference is that a dialog box has a parent, which is a frame or another dialog box that 
"owns" the dialog box. If the parent of a dialog box closes, the dialog box closes automatically. 
Furthermore, the dialog box will probably "float" on top of its parent, even when its parent is 
the active window. 

Dialog boxes can be either modal or modeless. When a modal dialog is put up on the 
screen, the rest of the application is blocked until the dialog box is dismissed. This is the most 
common case, and all the standard dialog boxes are modal. Modeless dialog boxes are more 
like independent windows, since they can stay on the screen while the user interacts with other 
windows. There are no modeless dialogs in the Mandelbrot Viewer program. 

The Mandelbrot Viewer program uses two custom dialog boxes. They are used to im- 
plement the "Set Image Size" and "Set Limits" commands and are defined by the files 
SetlmageSizeDialog.java and SetLimitsDialog.java. The "set image size" dialog lets the user 
enter a new width and height for the Mandelbrot image. The "set limits" dialog lets the user 
input the minimum and maximum values for x and y that are shown in the image. The two 
dialog classes are very similar. In both classes, several JTextFields are used for user input. Two 
buttons named "OK" and "Cancel" are added to the window, and listeners are set up for these 
buttons. If the user clicks "OK", the listener checks whether the inputs in the text fields are 
legal; if not, an error message is displayed to the user and the dialog stays on the screen. If the 
input is legal when the user clicks "OK" , the dialog is disposed. The dialog is also disposed if 
the user clicks "Cancel" or clicks the dialog box's close box. The net effect is that the dialog 
box stays on the screen until the user either cancels the dialog or enters legal values for the 
inputs and clicks "OK" . The program can find out which of these occurred by calling a method 
named getlnputO in the dialog object after showing the dialog. This method returns null if 
the dialog was canceled; otherwise it returns the user input. 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



709 



To make my custom dialog boxes easy to use, I added a static showDialogO method to 
each dialog class. When this function is called, it shows the dialog, waits for it to be dismissed, 
and then returns the value of the get Input () method. This makes it possible to use my custom 
dialog boxes in much the same way as Java's standard dialog boxes are used. 

Custom dialog boxes are not difficult to create and to use, if you already know about 
frames. I will not discuss them further here, but you can look at the source code file 
SetlmageSizeDialog.java as a model. 

13.5.6 Preferences 

Most serious programs allow the user to set preferences. A preference is really just a piece of 
the program's state that is saved between runs of the program. In order to make preferences 
persistent from one run of the program to the next, the preferences could simply be saved to a 
file in the user's home directory. However, there would then be the problem of locating the file. 
There would be the problem of naming the file in a way that avoids conflicts with file names 
used by other programs. And there would be the problem of cluttering up the user's home 
directory with files that the user shouldn't even have to know about. 

To deal with these problems, Java has a standard means of handling preferences. It is 
defined by the package java.util.pref s. In general, the only thing that you need from this 
package is the class named Preferences. 

In the Mandelbrot Viewer program, the file Main.java has an example of using Preferences. 
Main, java runs the stand-alone application version of the program, and its use of preferences 
applies only when the program is run in that way. 

In most programs, the user sets preferences in a custom dialog box. However, the Man- 
delbrot program doesn't have any preferences that are appropriate for that type of treatment. 
Instead, as an example, I automatically save a few aspects of the program's state as preferences. 
Every time the program starts up, it reads the preferences, if any are available. Every time 
the program terminates, it saves the preferences. (Saving the preferences poses an interesting 
problem because the program ends when the MandelbrotFrame window closes, not when the 
main() routine ends. In fact, the main() routine ends as soon as the window appears on the 
screen. So, it won't work to save the preferences at the end of the main program. The solution 
is to use events: A listener listens for Window/Events from the frame. When a window-closed 
event is received, indicating that the program is ending, the listener saves the preferences.) 

Preferences for Java programs are stored in some platform-dependent form in some platform- 
dependent location. As a Java programmer, you don't have to worry about it; the Java pref- 
erences system knows where to store the data. There is still the problem of identifying the 
preferences for one program among all the possible Java programs that might be running on a 
computer. Java solves this problem in the same way that it solves the package naming prob- 
lem. In fact, by convention, the preferences for a program are identified by the package name of 
the program, with a slight change in notation. For example, the Mandelbrot Viewer program 
is defined in the package edu.hws.eck.mdb, and its preferences are identified by the string 
"/edu/hws/eck/mdb" . (The periods have been changed to "/", and an extra "/" has been 
added at the beginning.) 

The preferences for a program are stored in something called a "node." The user preferences 
node for a given program identifier can be accessed as follows: 

Preferences root = Preferences. userRootO ; 
Preferences node = root .node (pathName) ; 



CHAPTER 13. ADVANCED GUI PROGRAMMING 



710 



where pathname is the string, such as "/edu/hws/eck/mdb" , that identifies the node. The node 
itself consists of a simple list of key/value pairs, where both the key and the value are strings. 
You can store any strings you want in preferences nodes — they are really just a way of storing 
some persistent data between program runs. In general, though, the key string identifies some 
particular preference item, and the associated value string is the value of that preference. A 
Preferences object, prefnode, contains methods pref node . get (key) for retrieving the value 
string associated with a given key and prefnode .put (key, value) for setting the value string 
for a given key. 

In Main, java, I use preferences to store the shape and position of the program's window. 
This makes the size and shape of the window persistent between runs of the program; when 
you run the program, the window will be right where you left it the last time you ran it. I also 
store the name of the directory that is currently selected in the file dialog box that is used by 
the program for the Save and Open commands. This is particularly satisfying, since the default 
behavior for a file dialog box is to start in the user's home directory, which is hardly ever the 
place where the user wants to keep a program's files. With the preferences feature, I can switch 
to the right directory the first time I use the program, and from then on I'll automatically 
be back in that directory when I use the program again. You can look at the source code in 
Main.java for the details. 

* * * 

And that's it. . . . There's a lot more that I could say about Java and about programming 
in general, but this book is only "An Introduction to Programming Using Java," and it's time 
for our journey to end. I hope that it has been a pleasant journey for you, and I hope that I 
have helped you establish a foundation that you can use as a basis for further exploration. 



Exercises 



711 



Exercises for Chapter 13 

1. The sample program Paint WithOffScreenCanvas Java from Section 13.1 is a simple paint (solution) 
program. Make two improvements to this program: First, add a "File" menu that lets 

the user open an image file and save the current image in either PNG or JPEG format. 
Second, add a basic one-level "Undo" command that lets the user undo the most recent 
operation that was applied to the image. (Do not try to make a multilevel Undo, which 
would allow the user to undo several operations.) 

When you read a file into the program, you should copy the image that you read into 
the program's off-screen canvas. Since the canvas in the program has a fixed size, you 
should scale the image that you read so that it exactly fills the canvas. 

2. For this exercise, you should continue to work on the program from the previous exercise. (solution) 
Add a "Stroke Width" menu that allows the user to draw lines of varying thicknesses. Make 

it possible to use different colors for the interior of a filled shape and for the outline of that 
shape. To do this, change the "Color" menu to "StrokeColor" and add a "FillColor" menu. 
(My solution adds two new tools, "Stroked Filled Rectangle" and "Stroked Filled Oval", 
to represent filled shapes that are outlined with the current stroke.) Add support for filling 
shapes with transparent color. A simple approach to this is to use a JCheckboxMenultem 
to select either fully opaque or 50% opaque fill. (Don't try to apply transparency to 
stokes — it's very difficult to make transparency work correctly for the Curve tool, and 
in any case, shape outlines look better if they are opaque.) Finally, make the menus 
more user friendly by adding some keyboard accelerators to some commands and by using 
JRadioButtonMenultems where appropriate, such as in the color and tool menus. This 
exercise takes quite a bit of work to get it all right, so you should tackle the problem in 
pieces. 

3. The StopWatch Label component from Subsection 13.4.5 displays the text "Timing..." (solution) 
when the stop watch is running. It would be nice if it displayed the elapsed time since 

the stop watch was started. For that, you need to create a Timer. (See Subsection 6.5.1.) 
Add a Timer to the original source code, StopWatchLabel.java, to drive the display of the 
elapsed time in seconds. Create the timer in the mousePressedO routine when the stop 
watch is started. Stop the timer in the mousePressedO routine when the stop watch 
is stopped. The elapsed time won't be very accurate anyway, so just show the integral 
number of seconds. You only need to set the text a few times per second. For my Timer 
method, I use a delay of 200 milliseconds for the timer. 

4. The custom component example MirrorText.java, from Subsection 13.4.5, uses an off- (solution) 
screen canvas to show mirror-reversed text in a JPanel. An alternative approach would 

be to draw the text after applying a transform to the graphics context that is used for 
drawing. (See Subsection 13.2.5.) With this approach, the custom component can be 
defined as a subclass of JLabel in which the paintComponent () method is overridden. 
Write a version of the MirrorText component that takes this approach. The solution is 
very short, but tricky. Note that the scale transform g2 . scale (-1 , 1) does a left-right 
reflection through the left edge of the component. 



5. The sample program PhoneDirectoryFileDemo.java from Subsection 11.3.2 keeps data for 



(solution ) 



Exercises 



712 



a "phone directory" in a file in the user's home directory. Exercise 11.5 asked you to 
revise that program to use an XML format for the data. Both programs have a simple 
command-line user interface. For this exercise, you should provide a GUI interface for the 
phone directory data. You can base your program either on the original sample program 
or on the modified version from the exercise. Use a JTable to hold the data. The user 
should be able to edit all the entries in the table. Also, the user should be able to add and 
delete rows. Include either buttons or menu commands that can be used to perform these 
actions. The delete command should delete the selected row, if any. New rows should be 
added at the end of the table. For this program, you can use a standard DefaultTableModel. 

Your program should load data from the file when it starts and save data to the file 
when it ends, just as the two previous programs do. For a GUI program, you can't simply 
save the data at the end of the main() routine, since main() terminates as soon as the 
window shows up on the screen. You want to save the data when the user closes the window 
and ends the program. There are several approaches. One is to use a Window/Listener to 
detect the event that occurs when the window closes. Another is to use a "Quit" command 
to end the program; when the user quits, you can save the data and close the window (by 
calling its dispose () method), and end the program. If you use the "Quit" command 
approach, you don't want the user to be able to end the program simply by closing the 
window. To accomplish this, you should call 

frame. setDef aultCloseOperation( JFrame. DO JTOTHINGJ3N_CL0SE) ; 

where frame refers to the JFrame that you have created for the program's user interface. 
When using a Window/Listener, you want the close box on the window to close the window, 
not end the program. For this, you need 

frame. setDef aultCloseOperation (JFrame . DISP0SE_0N_CL0SE) ; 

When the listener is notified of a window closed event, it can save the data and end the 
program. 

Most of the JTable and DefaultTableModel methods that you need for this exercise are 
discussed in Subsection 13.4.3, but there are a few more that you need to know about. To 
determine which row is selected in a JTable, call table .getSelectedRowQ . This method 
returns the row number of the selected row, or returns -1 if no row is selected. To specify 
which cell is currently being edited, you can use: 

table . setRowSelectionlnterval (rowNum, rowNum) ; // Selects row number rowNum. 
table . editCellAt ( rowNum, colNum ); // Edit cell at position (rowNum, colNum) . 
phoneTable . getEditorComponent () . requestFocus () ; // Put input cursor in cell. 

One particularly troublesome point is that the data that is in the cell that is currently 
being edited is not in the table model. The value in the edit cell is not put into the table 
model until after the editing is finished. This means that even though the user sees the 
data in the cell, it's not really part of the table data yet. If you lose that data, the user 
would be justified in complaining. To make sure that you get the right data when you 
save the data at the end of the program, you have to turn off editing before retrieving the 
data from the model. This can be done with the following method: 

private void stopEditingO { 

if (table. getCellEditor () != null) 

table. getCellEditor () . stopCellEditingO ; 

> 



Exercises 



713 



This method must also be called before modifying the table by adding or deleting rows; if 
such modifications are made while editing is in progress, the effect can be very strange.

Appendix: Source Files 



This appendix contains a list of the examples appearing in the free, on-line textbook 
Introduction to Programming Using Java, Sixth Edition. The source code files can be found in 
the on-line version of this book, or in the source directory of a download of the web site. You 
should be able to compile the files and use them. Note however that some of these examples 
depend on other source files, such as TextlO.java and MosaicPanel.java, that are not built into 
Java. These are classes that I have written. Links to all necessary non-standard source 
code files are provided below. To compile a program that uses a non-standard class, the 
source code file or the compiled class file for that class should be in the same location as the 
program that uses it. To run the program, you only need the compiled class file. Note that 
almost all of my classes are meant to be placed in the default package, to be used by programs 
that are also in the default package. To use them in other packages, you will have to add an 
appropriate "package" declaration to the beginning of the source code. 

The solutions to end-of-chapter exercises are not listed in this appendix. Each end-of- 
chapter exercise has its own Web page, which discusses its solution. The source code of a 
sample solution of each exercise is given in full on the solution page for that exercise. If you 
want to compile the solution, you should be able to cut-and-paste the solution out of a Web 
browser window and into a text editing program. (You can't cut-and-paste from the HTML 
source of the solution page, since it contains extra HTML markup commands that the Java 
compiler won't understand; the HTML markup does not appear when the page is displayed in 
a Web browser.) 

Note that most of these examples require Java version 5.0 or later. A few of them were 
written for older versions, but will still work with current versions. When you compile some of 
these older programs with current versions of Java, you might get warnings about "deprecated" 
methods. These warnings are not errors. When a method is deprecated, it means that it should 
not be used in new code, but it has not yet been removed from the language. It is possible that 
deprecated methods might be removed from the language at some future time, but for now you 
just get a warning about using them. 

Part 1: Text-oriented Examples 

Many of the sample programs in the text are based on console-style input /output, where the 
computer and the user type lines of text back and forth to each other. Some of these programs 
use the standard output object, System. out, for output. Many of them use my non-standard 
class, TextIO, for both input and output. For the programs that use TextIO, one of the files 
TextlO.java or TextIO. class must be available when you compile the program, and TextIO. class 
must be available when you run the program. There is also a GUI version of TextIO; you can 
find information about it at the end of Part 4, below.

The programs listed here are stand-alone applications, not applets, but I have written 
applets that simulate many of the programs. These "console applets" appear on Web pages 
in the on-line version of this textbook. They are based on TextlOApplet.java, which provides 
the same methods as TextIO, but in an applet instead of in a stand-alone application. It is 
straightforward to convert a TextIO program to a TextIO Applet applet. See the comments in 
the TextlOApplet.java file for information about how to do it. One example of this can be 
found in the file Interest3Console.java. 

• Interest .java, from Section 2.2, computes the interest on a specific amount of money over 
a period of one year. 

• TimedComputation.java, from Section 2.3, demonstrates a few basic built-in subroutines 
and functions. 

• EnumDemo.java, from Section 2.3, a very simple first demonstration of enum types. 

• PrintSquare.java, from Section 2.4, reads an integer typed in by the user and prints the 
square of that integer. This program depends on TextlO.java. The same is true 
for almost all of the programs in the rest of this list. 

• Interest2.java, from Section 2.4, calculates interest on an investment for one year, based 
on user input. 

• CreateProfile.java, from Section 2.4, a simple demo of output to a file, using TextIO.

read from a file. Demonstrates try. . catch statements. 

• GuessingGame.java, from Section 4.2, lets the user play guessing games where the com- 
puter picks a number and the user tries to guess it. A slight variation of this program, 
which reports the number of games won by the user, is GuessingGame2.java. 

• RowsOfChars.java, from Section 4.3, a rather useless program in which one subroutine 
calls another. 

• ThreeN2.java, from Section 4.4, is an improved 3N+1 program that uses subroutines and 
prints its output in neat columns.

ments using the "birthday problem" (how many people do you have to choose at random 
until two are found whose birthdays are on the same day of the year). 

• ReverselnputNumbers.java, from Section 7.3, is a short program that illustrates the use 
of a partially full array by reading some numbers from the user and then printing them in

exceptions to handle errors in the user's input. 

• TowersOfHanoi.java, from Section 9.2, prints out the steps in a solution to the Towers of 
Hanoi problem; an example of recursion. 

• StringList.java, from Section 9.2, implements a linked list of strings. The program 
ListDemo.java tests this class. 

• PostfixEval.java, from Section 9.3, evaluates postfix expressions using a stack. Depends 
on the StackOfDouble class defined in StackOfDouble.java. 

• SortTreeDemo.java, from Section 9.4, demonstrates a binary sort tree of strings. 

• SimpleParserl.java, from Section 9.5, evaluates fully parenthesized expressions input by 
the user. 

• SimpleParser2.java, from Section 9.5, evaluates ordinary infix expressions input by the 
user. 

• SimpleParser3.java, from Section 9.5, reads infix expressions input by the user and con- 
structs expression trees that represent those expressions. 

• WordListWithTreeSet.java, from Section 10.2, makes an alphabetical list of words from a 
file. A TreeSet is used to eliminate duplicates and sort the words. 

• Simplelnterpreter.java, from Section 10.4, demonstrates the use of a HashMap as a symbol 
table in a program that interprets simple commands from the user. 

• WordCount.java, from Section 10.4, counts the number of occurrences of each word in a 
file. The program uses several features from the Java Collection Framework. 

• ReverseFile.java, from Section 11.2, shows how to read and write files in a 
simple command-line application; uses the non-standard class TextReader.java. 
ReverseFileWithScanner.java is a version of the program that uses a Scanner instead of a 
TextReader. 

• DirectoryList.java, from Section 11.2, lists the contents of a directory specified by the user; 
demonstrates the use of the File class. 

• CopyFile.java, from Section 11.3, is a program that makes a copy of a file, using file names 
that are given as command-line arguments.

• ReadURL.java, from Section 11.4, reads and displays the contents of a specified URL, if 
the URL refers to a text file. ReadURL Applet .java is an applet that does much the same 
thing. 

• ShowMyNetwork.java, mentioned in Section 11.4, is a short program that prints informa- 
tion about each network interface on the computer where it is run, including IP addresses 
associated with each interface. 

• DateClient.java and DateServer.java, from Section 11.4, are very simple first examples of 
network client and server programs. 

• CLChatClient.java and CLChatServer.java, from Section 11.4, demonstrate two-way com- 
munication over a network by letting users send messages back and forth; however, no 
threading is used and the messages must strictly alternate. 

• ThreadTestl.java, from section Section 12.1, runs one or more threads that all perform the 
same task, to demonstrate that they run simultaneously and finish in an indeterminate 
order. 

• ThreadTest2.java, from section Section 12.1, divides up a task (counting primes) among 
several threads, to demonstrate parallel processing and the use of synchronization. 

• DateServerWithThreads.java and DateServerWithThreadPool.java, from Section 12.4, are 
modifications of DateServer.java (Subsection 11.4.4) that use threads to handle commu- 
nication with clients. The first program creates a new thread for each connection. The 
second uses a thread pool, and it uses a blocking queue to send connections from the 
main program to the pool. The threaded servers will work with original client program, 
DateClient.java. 

• CLMandelbrotMaster.java, CLMandelbrotWorker.java, and CLMandelbrotTask.java, 
from Section 12.4, are a demonstration of distributed computing in which pieces of a 
large computation are sent over a network to be computed by "worker" programs. 

Part 2: Graphical Examples from the Text 

The following programs use a graphical user interface. The majority of them can be run both 
as stand-alone applications and as applets. (If you have downloaded the web site for this book, 
note that most of the jar files for Chapter 6 and Chapter 13 are executable jar files which can 
be run as applications.) 

• GUIDemo.java is a simple demonstration of some basic GUI components from the Swing 
graphical user interface library. It appears in the text in Section 1.6, but you won't be 
able to understand it until you learn about GUI programming. 

• StaticRects.java is a rather useless applet that simply draws a static image. It is the first 
example of GUI programming, in Section 3.8. This applet depends on AnimationBase.java, 
which is a simple framework for writing animated applets (even though there's actually 
no animation.) 

• MovingRects.java, also from Section 3.8, draws an animated version of the image in the 
preceding example. This applet depends on AnimationBase.java, which is a simple frame- 
work for writing animated applets. 

• RandomMosaicWalk.java, a standalone program that displays a window full of col- 
ored squares with a moving disturbance, from Section 4.6. This program depends on 
MosaicCanvas.java and Mosaic.java.

• RandomMosaicWalk2.java is a version of the previous example, modified to use a few 
named constants. From Section 4.7. 

• ShapeDraw.java, from Section 5.5, is an applet that lets the user place various shapes on 
a drawing area; an example of abstract classes, subclasses, and polymorphism. 

• Hello WorldGUIl.java and Hello WorldGUI2.java, from Section 6.1, show the message 
"Hello World" in a window, the first one by using the built-in JOptionPane class and 
the second by building the interface "by hand." Another variation, Hello WorldGUI4.java, 
from Section 6.4, uses anonymous inner classes where Hello WorldGUIl.java uses named 
nested classes. 

• HelloWorldApplet.java, from Section 6.2, defines an applet that displays the message 
"Hello World" or "Goodbye World" . The message changes when the user clicks a button. 

• HelloWorldPanel.java, from Section 6.2, is a panel that displays a message. The panel is 
used as the content pane both in the applet Hello World Applet 2. java and in the window of 
the stand-alone application HelloWorldGUI3.java. This example illustrates the technique 
of using the same panel class in both an applet and a stand-alone application, a technique 
that will be used in many examples in the rest of the book. 

• Color Chooser Applet .java, used in Section 6.3 to demonstrate RGB and HSB colors. This 
applet uses techniques that are not covered until later in the text, and it is not presented 
as a programming example. 

• RandomStringsApplet.java, from Section 6.3, shows 25 copies of the string "Java!" (or 
some other string specified in an applet param) in random colors and fonts. The applet 
uses RandomStringsPanel.java for its content pane, and there is a stand-alone application 
RandomStringsApp.java that uses the same panel class. 

• ClickableRandomStringsApp.java, from Section 6.4, is similar to RandomStringsApp.java 
except that the window is repainted when the user clicks the window. This is a first exam- 
ple of using a mouse listener. The applet version is ClickableRandomStrings Applet .java. 

• SimpleStamper.java, from Section 6.4, lets the user place rectangles and ovals on a drawing 
area by clicking with the mouse. The applet version is SimpleStamperApplet.java. Both 
versions use SimpleStamperPanel.java for their content panes. 

• SimpleTrackMouse.java, from Section 6.4, shows information about mouse events. The ap- 
plet version is SimpleTrackMouse Applet .java. Both versions use SimpleTrackMousePanel.java 
for their content panes. 

• SimplePaint.java, from Section 6.4, lets the user draw curves in a drawing area and select 
the drawing color from a palette. The class SimplePaint can be used either as an applet 
or as a stand-alone application. 

• RandomArtPanel.java, from Section 6.5, shows a new random "artwork" every four sec- 
onds. This is an example of using a Timer. Used in an applet version of the program, 
RandomArt Applet .java, and a stand-alone application version, RandomArt.java. 

• KeyboardAndFocusDemo.java, from Section 6.5, shows how to use keyboard and focus 
events. This class can be run either has an applet or as a stand-alone application. 

• SubKillerPanel.java, from Section 6.5, lets the user play a simple game. Uses a timer as 
well as keyboard and focus events. The applet version is SubKiller Applet .java, and the 
stand-alone application version is SubKiller.java. 

• SliderDemo.java, a simple demo from Section 6.6, is an applet that shows three JSIiders.

• TextAreaDemo.java, from Section 6.6, is an applet that demonstrates a JTextArea in a 
JScrollPane. 

• BorderDemo.java, from Section 6.7, a very simple applet that demonstrates six types of 
border. 

• SliderAndComboBoxDemo.java, from Section 6.7, shows how to create several components 
and lay them out in a GridLayout. Can be used either as an applet or as a stand-alone 
application. 

• SimpleCalc.java, from Section 6.7, lets the user add, subtract, multiply, or divide two num- 
bers input by the user. A demo of text fields, buttons, and layout with nested subpanels. 
Can be used either as an applet or as a stand-alone application. 

• NullLayoutDemo.java, from Section 6.7, shows how to lay out the components in a con- 
tainer for which the layout manager has been set to null. Can be used either as an applet 
or as a stand-alone application. 

• HighLowGUIPanel.java, from Section 6.7, is a subclass of JPanel that implements a 
GUI version of the card game HighLow.java, in which the user sees a playing card and 
guesses whether the next card will be higher or lower in value. This class depends on 
Card.java, Hand.java, and Deck.java. A standalone application that uses this panel is in 
HighLowGUI.java. An applet that uses it is in HighLowGUIApplet.java. 

• MosaicDrawController.java, from Section 6.8, demonstrates menus and a color chooser 
dialog. This is used in a program where the user colors the squares of a mosaic by 
clicking-and-dragging the mouse. It uses MosaicPanel.java to define the mosaic panel it- 
self. MosaicDrawController is used in the stand-alone application MosaicDrawFrame.java, 
in the applet MosaicDrawApplet.java, and in the applet MosaicDrawLauncher Applet Java. 
The latter applet appears as a button on a web page; clicking the button opens a Mosaic- 
DrawFrame. 

• SimpleDialogDemo.java, from Section 6.8, is an applet that demonstrates JColorChooser 
and some dialogs from JOptionPane. 

• RandomStringsWithArray.java, from Section 7.2, shows 25 copies of a message in random 
colors, sizes, and positions. This is an improved version of RandomStringsPanel.java that 
uses an array to keep track of the data, so that the same picture can be redrawn whenever 
necessary. (Written only as an applet.) 

• SimpleDrawRects.java, from Section 7.3, lets the user place colored rectangles in a drawing 
area. Illustrates the use of an ArrayList. An applet version is SimpleDrawRectsApplet.java. 
This program uses and depends on RainbowPalette.java. 

• SimplePaint2.java, from Section 7.3, lets the user draw colored curves and stores the 
data needed for repainting the drawing surface in a list of type Arrayl_ist<CurveData>. 
SimplePaint2 Applet Java runs the program as an applet. 

• Checkers.java, from Section 7.5, lets two users play a game of checkers against each other. 
Illustrates the use of a two-dimensional array. (This is the longest program in the book 
so far, at over 750 lines!) Checkers Applet Java runs the program as an applet. 

• Blobs.java, from Section 9.1, recursively counts groups of colored squares in a grid. 

• DepthBreadth.java, from Section 9.3, demonstrates stacks and queues. 

• TrivialEdit Java, from Section 11.3, lets the user edit short text files. This program demon- 
strates reading and writing files and using file dialogs.

• SimplePaintWithFiles.java, from Section 11.3, demonstrates saving data from a program 
to a file in both binary and character form. The program is a simple sketching program 
based on SimplePaint2.java. 

• SimplePaintWithXML.java and SimplePaintWithXMLEncoder.java, from Section 11.5, 
demonstrate saving data from a program to a file in XML format. The first pro- 
gram uses an invented XML language, while the second uses an XMLEncoder for writ- 
ing files and an XMLDecoder for reading files. These programs are modifications of 
SimplePaintWithFiles.java. 

• XMLDemo.java, from Section 11.5, is a simple program that demonstrates basic parsing 
of an XML document and traversal of the Document Object Model representation of 
the document. The user enters the XML to be parsed in a text area. The trivial class 
XMLDemoApplet.java runs the program as an applet. 

• RandomArtWithThreads.java, from Section 12.2, uses a thread to drive a very simple 
animation. Compare to RandomArt Panel Java, which does the same thing with a timer. 

• Quicksort ThreadDemo.java, from Section 12.2, demonstrates using a separate thread to 
perform a computation, with simple inter-thread communication. The program is a visual 
demo of the QuickSort algorithm. (QuicksortThreadDemoApplet.java is a trivial class 
that shows the program as an applet.) 

• BackgroundComputationDemo.java, from Section 12.2, demonstrates using a thread run- 
ning at a lower priority to perform a lengthy computation in the background. (The pro- 
gram computes a visualization of a small piece of the Mandelbrot set, but the particular 
computation that is done is not important.) 

• MultiprocessingDemol.java, from Section 12.2, is a modification of the previous example 
that uses several threads to perform the background computation. This speeds up the 
computation on multi-processor machines. (MultiprocessingDemolApplet.java is a trivial 
class that shows the program as an applet.) 

• MultiprocessingDemo2.java, from Section 12.3, is a modification of the previous exam- 
ple that decomposes its task into a large number of fairly small subtasks, in order to 
achieve better load balancing. The program uses a thread pool and a queue of tasks. 
(MultiprocessingDemo2Applet.java is a trivial class that shows the program as an ap- 
plet.) 

• MultiprocessingDemo3.java, from Section 12.3, is yet another version of the previous ex- 
amples. This one uses a pool of threads that run forever, taking tasks from a queue and 
executing them. To make this possible, a blocking queue is used, defined by the standard 
LinkedBlockingQueue class. MyLinkedBlockingQueue.java is a simple example of using 
wait() and notify () directly that can be used as a replacement for LinkedBlockingQueue 
in MultiprocessingDemo3. 

• TowersOfHanoiWithControls.java, from Section 12.3, shows an animation of the famous 
Towers Of Hanoi problem. The user can control the animation with Run/Pause, Next, and 
StartAgain buttons. The program is an example of using wait() and notify () directly 
for communication between threads. (TowersOfHanoiWithControlsApplet.java is a trivial 
class that shows the program as an applet.) 

• ChatSimulation.java, from Section 12.4 (on-line version only), is an applet that simulates 
a network chat. There is no networking in this applet. The only point is to demonstrate 
how a thread could be used to process (simulated) incoming messages.

• GUIChat.java, from Section 12.4, is a simple GUI program for chatting between two 
people over a network. It demonstrates using a thread for reading data from a network 
connection. 

• netgame. common, from Section 12.5, is a package that defines a framework for networked 
games. This framework is used in several examples: A chat room, defined in package 
netgame. chat; a tic-tac-toe game, defined in package netgame. tictactoe; and a poker game, 
defined in package netgame. fivecarddraw. 

• HighLowWithlmages.java, from Section 13.1, is a variation of HighLowGUI.java that takes 
playing card images from an image file. Requires the image file cards. png and depends on 
Card.java, Deck.java, and Hand.java. HighLowWithlmages Applet Java runs this program 
as an applet. 

• PaintWithOffScreenCanvas.java, from Section 13.1, is a little paint program that illus- 
trates the use of a Bufferedlmage as an off-screen canvas. This class, like many other 
examples from Chapter 12, includes a static nested subclass of JApplet that can be used 
to run the program as an applet. This is, admittedly, a somewhat tricky way to do things. 
See the source code for information about how to use the applet class. 

• Sound AndCursorDemo Java, from Section 13.1, lets the user play a few sounds and change 
the cursor by clicking some buttons. This demonstrates using audio resource files and using 
an image resource to create a custom cursor. Requires the resource files in the directory 
snc_resources. 

• TransparencyDemo.java, from Section 13.2, demonstrates using the alpha component of 
colors. It is also an example of using FontMetrics. 

• StrokeDemo.java, from Section 13.2, demonstrates the use of various BasicStrokes for 
drawing lines and rectangles. Also demonstrates antialiasing. 

• PaintDemo.java, from Section 13.2, demonstrates using a GradientPaint and using a 
TexturePaint to fill a polygon. Uses the image resource files TinySmiley.png and 
QueenOfHearts . png. 

• RadioButtonDemo.java, from Section 13.3, does what its name indicates. 

• ToolBarDemo.java, from Section 13.3, uses a JToolBar that holds a group of 3 radio 
buttons and a push button. All the buttons use custom icons, and the push button is 
created from an Action. 

• SillyStamper.java, from Section 13.4, demonstrates using a JList of Icons. The user can 
"stamp" images of a selected icon onto a drawing area. This program uses the icon images 
in the directory stamper_icons as resources. 

• StatesAndCapitalsTableDemo.java, from Section 13.4, is a completely trivial demo of a 
JTable. 

• ScatterPlotTableDemo.java, from Section 13.4, uses a TableModel to customize a JTable. 
The table is a list of xy-points that the user can edit. A scatter plot of the points is 
displayed. 

• SimpleWebBrowser.java and SimpleWebBrowserWithThread.java, from Section 13.4, im- 
plement a simple web browser using JEditorPane (which is ridiculously easy). The dif- 
ference between the programs is that the first loads documents synchronously, which can 
hang the program in an unpleasant way, while the second uses a thread to load documents 
asynchronously.

• SimpleRTFEdit.java, mentioned but just barely discussed in Section 13.4, lets the user 
edit RTF files, which are text files in a format that include style information such as bold 
and italics. This is mainly a simple demo of using Actions defined by "editor kits." 

• StopWatchLabel.java and MirrorText.java, from Section 13.4, are classes that implement 
custom components. CustomComponentTest.java is a program that tests them. 

• The Mandelbrot program from Section 13.5, which computes and displays visualizations 
of the Mandelbrot set, is defined by several classes in the package edu.hws.eck.mdb. The 
source code files can be found in the directory edu/hws/eck/mdb. 

Part 3: End- of- Chapter Applets 

This section contains the source code for the applets that are used as decorations at the end 
of each chapter in the on-line version of this textbook. In general, you should not expect to be 
able to understand these applets at the time they occur in the text. Some of these are older 
applets that will work with Java 1.1 or even Java 1.0. They are not meant as examples of good 
programming practice for more recent versions of Java. 

• Moire.java, an animated design, shown at the end of Section 1.7. You can use applet 
parameters to control various aspects of this applet's behavior. Also note that you can 
click on the applet and drag the pattern around by hand. See the source code for details. 

• JavaPops.java, from Section 2.6 is a simple animation that shows copies of the string 
"Java!" in various sizes and colors appearing and disappearing. This is an old applet that 
depends on an old animation framework named SimpleAnimationApplet.java 

• RandomBrighten.java, showing a grid of colored squares that get more and more red 
as a wandering disturbance visits them, from the end of Section 4.7. Depends on 
MosaicCanvas.j ava 

• SymmetricBrighten.java, a subclass of the previous example that makes a symmet- 
ric pattern, from the end of Section 5.7. Depends on MosaicCanvas.java and 
RandomBr ight en . j ava . 

• TrackLines.java, an applet with lines that track the mouse, from Section 6.8. 

• KaleidoAnimate.java, from Section 7.5, shows moving kaleidoscopic images. 

• SimpleCA.java, a Cellular Automaton applet, from the end of Section 8.5. This ap- 
plet depends on the file CACanvas.java For more information on cellular automata see 
http://math.hws.edu/xJava/CA/. 

• TowersOfHanoiGUI.java, from Section 9.5, graphically shows the solution to the Towers 
of Hanoi problem with 10 disks. A newer version of this program, with buttons that allow 
some control of the animation is TowersOfHanoiWithControls.java, from Section 12.3. 

• LittlePentominosApplet.java, from Section 10.5, solves pentominos puzzles using a simple 
recursive backtracking algorithm. This applet depends on MosaicPanel.java. For a much 
more complex Pentominos applet, see http://math.hws.edu/xJava/PentominosSolver/. 

• Maze.java, an applet that creates a random maze and solves it, from Section 11.5. 

• LittleQuicksortDemo.java, from the end of Section 12.5, is a simplified version of 
Quicksort ThreadDemo.java, which is discussed in Section 12.2. The applet shows a visu- 
alization of the QuickSort algorithm where the goal is to sort a list of colored bars into 
spectral order from red to violet.

• The applet at the end of Section 13.5 is the same Mandelbrot program that is discussed 
as an example in that section, with source files in the directory edu/hws/eck/mdb. 



Part 4: Auxiliary Files 

This section lists some of the extra source files that are required by various examples in the 
previous sections. The files listed here are those which are general enough to be potentially 
useful in other programming projects. Links to these files are also given above, along with the 
programs that use them. 

• TextlO.java defines a class containing some static methods for doing input/output. These 
methods make it easier to use the standard input and output streams, System, in and 
System. out. TextIO also supports other input sources and output destinations, such 
as files. Note that this version of TextIO requires Java 5.0 (or higher). The TextIO 
class defined by this file is only useful in a command-line environment, and it might 
be inconvenient to use in integrated development environments such as Eclipse in which 
standard input does not work particularly well. In that case, you might want to use the 
following file instead. 

• TextlO.java for GUI defines an alternative to the preceding file. It defines a version of 
TextIO with the same set of input and output routines as the original version. But instead 
of using standard I/O, this GUI version opens its own window, and the input/output is 
done in that window. Please read the comments at the beginning of the file. (For people 
who have downloaded this book: The file is located in a directory named TextlO-GUI 
inside the source directory.) 

• TextlOApplet.java can be used for writing applets that simulate TextIO programs. This 
makes it possible to write applets that use "console-style" input/output. Such applets are 
created as subclasses of TextlOApplet. See the comments in the file for more information 
about how to convert a TextIO program into a TextlOApplet applet. An example can be 
found in the file Interest3Console.java. 

• AnimationBase.java, a class that can be used as a framework for writing animated applets. 
To use the framework, you have to define a subclass of AnimationBase. Section 3.8 has an 
example. 

• Mosaic.java contains subroutines for opening and controlling a window that contains a 
grid of colored rectangles. It depends on Mosaic Canvas Java. This is a toolbox for writing 
simple stand-alone applications that use a "mosaic window." This is rather old code, but 
it is used in examples in Section 4.6 and Section 4.7. 

• MosaicPanel.java is a greatly improved version of MosaicCanvas.java that has many op- 
tions. This class defines a subclass of JPanel that shows little rectangles arranged in rows 
and columns. It is used in the "mosaic draw" example in Section 6.8. 

• Expr.java defines a class Expr that represent mathematical expressions involving the vari- 
able x. It is used in some of the exercises in Chapter 8. 

• netgame. common is a package that defines a framework for networked games, which is 
discussed in detail in Section 12.5. (If you have downloaded the web site for this book, 
you can find the files that make up this package in the subdirectory net game /common of 
the source directory.)

• Poker Rank.java can be used to assign ranks to hands of cards in poker games. The cards 
are defined in the class PokerCard.java. Both of these classes are part of the package 
netgame.fivecarddraw, which is discussed in Subsection 12.5.4. (The file can be found in 
the subdirectory netgame/f ivecarddraw of the source directory.) 

• I18n.java is a class that can be used to help in internationalization of a program. See Sub- 
section 13.5.3. (This file in the subdirectory edu/hws/eck/mdb of the source directory.) 



Glossary 



abstract class. A class that cannot be used to create objects, and that exists only for the 
purpose of creating subclasses. Abstract classes in Java are defined using the modifier 
abstract. 

abstract data type (ADT). A data type for which the possible values of the type and the 
permissible operations on those values are specified, without specifying how the values 
and operations are to be implemented. 

access specifier. A modifier used on a method definition or variable specification that deter- 
mines what classes can use that method or variable. The access specifiers in Java are 
public, protected, and private. A method or variable that has no access specifier is 
said to have "package" visibility. 

activation record. A data structure that contains all the information necessary to implement 
a subroutine call, including the values of parameters and local variables of the subroutine 
and the return address to which the computer will return when the subroutine ends. 
Activation records are stored on a stack, which makes it possible for several subroutine 
calls to be active at the same time. This is particularly important for recursion, where 
several calls to the same subroutine can be active at the same time. 

actual parameter. A parameter in a subroutine call statement, whose value will be passed 
to the subroutine when the call statement is executed. Actual parameters are also called 
"arguments" . 

address. Each location in the computer's memory has an address, which is a number that 
identifies that location. Locations in memory are numbered sequentially. In modern 
computers, each byte of memory has its own address. Addresses are used when informa- 
tion is being stored into or retrieved from memory. 

algorithm. An unambiguous, step-by-step procedure for performing some task, which is guar- 
anteed to terminate after a finite number of steps. 

alpha color component. A component of a color that says how transparent or opaque that 
color is. The higher the alpha component, the more opaque the color. 

API. Application Programming Interface. A specification of the interface to a software package 
or "toolbox." The API says what classes or subroutines are provided in the toolbox and 
how to use them. 

applet. A type of Java program that is meant to run on a Web page in a Web browser, as 
opposed to a stand-alone application. 

animation. An apparently moving picture created by rapidly showing a sequence of still 
images, called frames, one after the other. In Java, animations are often driven by Timer 
objects; a new frame of the animation is shown each time the timer fires. 



726 



Glossary 



727 



antialiasing. Adjusting the color of pixels to reduce the "jagged" effect that can occur when 
shapes and text are represented by pixels. For antialiased drawing, when the shape covers 
only part of a pixel, the color of the shape is blended with the previous color of the pixel. 
The degree of blending depends on how much of the pixel is covered. 

array. A list of items, sequentially numbered. Each item in the list can be identified by its 
index, that is, its sequence number. In Java, all the items in array must have the same 
type, called the base type of the array. An array is a random access data structure; that 
is, you can get directly at any item in the array at any time. 

array type. A data type whose possible values are arrays. If Type is the name of a type, then 

Type[] is the array type for arrays that have base type 7ype. 
assignment statement. A statement in a computer program that retrieves or computes a 

value and stores that value in a variable. An assignment statement in Java has the form: 

(variable-name) = (expression); 

asynchronous event. An event that can occur at an unpredictable time, outside the control 
of a computer program. User input events, such as pressing a button on the mouse, are 
asynchronous. 

ASCII. American Standard Code for Information Interchange. A way of encoding characters 
using 7 bits for characters. ASCII code only supports 128 characters, with no accented 
letters, non-English alphabets, special symbols, or ideograms for non-alphabetic lan- 
guages such as Chinese. Java uses the much larger and more complete Unicode code for 
characters. 

base case. In a recursive algorithm, a simple case that is handled directly rather than by 
applying the algorithm recursively. 

binary number. A number encoded as a sequence of zeros and ones. A binary number is 
represented in the "base 2" in the same way that ordinary numbers are represented in 
the "base 10." 

binary tree. A linked data structure that is either empty or consists of a root node that 
contains pointers to two smaller (possibly empty) binary trees. The two smaller binary 
trees are called the left subtree and the right subtree. 

bit. A single-digit binary number, which can be either or 1. 

black box. A system or component of a system that can be used without understanding what 
goes on inside the box. A black box has an interface and an implementation. A black 
box that is meant to be used as a component in a system is called a module. 

block. In Java programming, a sequence of statements enclosed between a pair of braces, { 
and }. Blocks are used to group several statements into a single statement. A block 
can also be empty, meaning that it contains no statements at all and consists of just an 
empty pair of braces. 

blocking operation. An operation, such as reading data from a network connection, is said 
to "block" if it has to wait for some event to occur. A thread that performs a blocking 
operation can be "blocked" until the required event occurs. A thread cannot execute 
any instructions while it is blocked. Other threads in the same program, however, can 
continue to run. 

blocking queue. A queue in which the dequeue operation will block if the queue is empty, 
until an item is added to the queue. If the blocking queue has a limited capacity, the 
enqueue operation can also block, if the queue is full.

the computer's memory and that can be used for drawing images off-screen. 

branch. A control structure that allows the computer to choose among two or more different 
courses of action. Java has two branch statements: if statements and switch statements.

by the JVM. 

charset. A particular encoding of character data into binary form. Examples include UTF-8 
and ISO-8859-1. 

checked exception. An exception in Java that must be handled, either by a try. .catch 
statement or by a throws clause on the method that can throw he exception. Failure to 
handle a checked exception in one way or the other is a syntax error. 

class. The basic unit of programming in Java. A class is a collection of static and non-static 
methods and variables. Static members of a class are part of the class itself; non-static, 
or "instance," members constitute a blueprint for creating objects, which are then said 
to "belong" to the class. 

client /server. A model of network communication in which a "server" waits at a known 
address on the network for connection requests that are sent to the server by "clients." 
This is the basic model for communication using the TCP/IP protocol. 

command-line interface. A way of interacting with the computer in which the user types in 
commands to the computer and the computer responds to each command.

belonging to that class. A constructor is called using the new operator, and is not 
considered to be a "method." 

container. A component, such as a JPanel, that can contain other GUI components. Contain- 
ers have add() methods that can be used to add components. 

contract of a method. The semantic component of the method's interface. The contract 
specifies the responsibilities of the method and of the caller of the method. It says how 
to use the method correctly and specifies the task that the method will perform when 
it is used correctly. The contract of a method should be fully specified by its Javadoc 
comment.

package is considered to be in the default package. 

definite assignment. Occurs at a particular point in a program if it is definitely true that 
a given variable must have been assigned a value before that point in the program. It 
is only legal to use the value of a local variable if that variable has "definitely" been 
assigned a value before it is used. For this to be true, the compiler must be able to verify 
that every path through the program from the declaration of the variable to its use must 
pass through a statement that assigns a value to that variable. 

deprecated. Considered to be obsolete, but still available for backwards compatibility. A 
deprecated Java class or method is still part of the Java language, but it is not advisable 
to use it in new code. Deprecated items might be removed in future versions of Java.

by a network, work together to solve a problem. 

dummy parameter. Identifier that is used in a subroutine definition to stand for the value of 
an actual parameter that will be passed to the subroutine when the subroutine is called. 
Dummy parameters are also called "formal parameters" (or sometimes just "parameters," 
when the term "argument" is used instead of actual parameter).

chain. 

listener. In GUI programming, an object that can be registered to be notified when events of 
some given type occur. The object is said to "listen" for the events.

local variable. A variable declared within a method, for use only inside that method. A 
variable declared inside a block is valid from the point where it is declared until the end 
of block in which the declaration occurs. 

loop. A control structure that allows a sequence of instructions to be executed repeatedly. 
Java has three kinds of loops: for loops, while loops, and do loops 

loop control variable. A variable in a for loop whose value is modified as the loop is executed 
and is checked to determine whether or not to end the loop. 

machine language. A programming language consisting of instructions that can be executed 
directed by a computer. Instructions in machine language are encoded as binary num- 
bers. Each type of computer has its own machine language. Programs written in other 
languages must be translated into a computer's machine language before they can be 
executed by that computer. 

main memory. Programs and data can be stored in a computer's main memory, where 
they are available to the CPU. Other forms of memory, such as a disk drive, also store 
information, but only main memory is directly accessible to the CPU. Programs and data 
from a disk drive have to be copied into main memory before they can be used by the 
CPU. 

map. An associative array; a data structure that associates an object from some collection to 
each object in some set. In Java, maps are represented by the generic interface Map<T,S>

method. Another term for subroutine, used in the context of object-oriented programming. A 
method is a subroutine that is contained in a class or in an object. 

module. A component of a larger system that interacts with the rest of the system in a simple, 
well-defined, straightforward manner. 

multitasking. Performing multiple tasks at once, either by switching rapidly back and forth 
from one task to another or by literally working on multiple tasks at the same time. 

multiprocessing. Multitasking in which more than one processor is used, so that multiple 
tasks can literally be worked on at the same time. 

mutual exclusion. Prevents two threads from accessing the same resource at the same time. 
In Java, this only applies to threads that access the resource in synchronized methods or 
synchronized statements. Mutual exclusion can prevent race conditions but introduces 
the possibility of deadlock. 

MVC pattern. The Model/ View/Controller pattern, a strategy for dividing responsibility in 
a GUI component. The model is the data for the component. The view is the visual 
presentation of the component on the screen. The controller is responsible for reacting 
to events by changing the model. According to the MVC pattern, these responsibilities 
should be handled by different objects. 

NaN. Not a Number. Double . NaN is a special value of type double that represents an undefined 
or illegal value. 

node. Common term for one of the objects in a linked data structure, 
null. A special pointer value that means "not pointing to anything."

numerical analysis. The field that studies algorithms that use approximations, such as real 
numbers, and the errors that can result from such approximation. 

off-by-one error. A common type of error in which one too few or one too many items are 
processed, often because counting is not being handled correctly or because the processing 
stops too soon or continues too long for some other reason. 

object. An entity in a computer program that can have data (variables) and behaviors (meth- 
ods). An object in Java must be created using some class as a template. The class of an 
object determines what variables and methods it contains.

interfaces are object types. 

OOP. Object-Oriented Programming. An approach to the design and implementation of com- 
puter programs in which classes and objects are created to represent concepts and entities 
and their interactions. 

operating system. The basic software that is always running on a computer, without which 
it would not be able to function. Examples include Linux, Mac OS, and Windows Vista. 

operator. A symbol such as "+", "<=", or "++" that represents an operation that can be 

applied to one or more values in an expression, 
overloading (of operators). The fact that the same operator can be used with different types 

of data. For example, the "+" operator can be applied to both numbers and strings. 

overloading (of method names). The fact that several methods that are defined in the 
same class can have the same name, as long as they have different signatures. 

overriding. Redefining in a subclass. When a subclass provides a new definition of a method 
that is inherited from a superclass, the new definition is said to override the original 
definition. 

package. In Java, a named collection of related classes and sub-packages, such as java.awt 
and j avax . swing. 

parallel processing. When several tasks are being performed simultaneously, either by mul- 
tiple processors or by one processor that switches back and forth among the tasks.

parameters" in the subroutine definition before the code in the subroutine is executed. 

parameterized type. A type such as ArrayList<String> that includes one or more type pa- 
rameters (String in the example). 

parsing. Determining the syntactical structure of a string in some language. To parse a string 
is to determine whether the string is legal according to the grammar of the language, and 
if so, how it can be created using the rules of the grammar.

array can be represented as a normal array plus a counter to keep track of how many 
items are actually stored. 

pixel. A "picture element" on the screen or in an image. A picture consists of rows and 
columns of pixels. The color of each pixel can be individually set. 

polymorphism. The fact that the meaning of a call to an instance method can depend on 
the actual type of the object that is used to make the call at run time. That is, if 
var is a variable of object type, then the method that is called by a statement such as

var . actionO depends on the type of the object to which var refers when the statement 
is executed at run time, not on the type of variable var. 

pointer. A value that represents an address in the computer's memory, and hence can be 
thought of as "pointing" to the location that has that address. A variable in Java can 
never hold an object; it can only hold a pointer to the location where the object is stored. 
A pointer is also called a "reference." 

pragmatics. Rules of thumb that describe what it means to write a good program. For 
example, style rules and guidelines about how to structure a program are part of the

precedence. The precedence of operators determines the order in which they are applied, 
when several operators occur in an expression, in the absence of parentheses. 

precondition. A condition that must be true at some point in the execution of a program, 
in order for the program to proceed correctly from that point. A precondition of a 
subroutine is something that must be true when the subroutine is called, in order for the 
subroutine to function properly. Subroutine preconditions are often restrictions on the 
values of the actual parameters that can be passed into the subroutine. 

postcondition. A condition that is known to be true at some point in the execution of a 
program, as a result of the computation that has come before that point. A postcondition 
of a subroutine is something that must be true after the subroutine finishes its execution. 
A postcondition of a function often describe the return value of the function. 

primitive type. One of the eight basic built-in data types in Java, double, float, long, int, 

short, byte, boolean, and char. A variable of primitive type holds an actual value, as 

opposed to a pointer to that value, 
priority of a thread. An integer associated with a thread that can affect the order in which 

threads are executed. A thread with greater priority is executed in preference to a thread 

with lower priority. 

producer /consumer. A classic pattern in parallel programming in which one or more pro- 
ducers produce items that are consumed by one or more consumers, and the producers 
and consumers are meant to run in parallel. The problem is to get items safely and 
efficiently from the producers to the consumers. In Java, the producer /consumer pattern 
is implemented by blocking queues. 

program. A set of instructions to be carried out by a computer, written in an appropriate 
programming language. Used as a verb, it means to create such a set of instructions. 

programming language. A language that can be used to write programs for a computer. Pro- 
gramming languages range in complexity from machine language to high-level languages 
such as Java. 

protocol. A specification of what constitutes legal communication in a give context. A protocol 
specifies the format of legal messages, when they can be sent, what kind of reply is 
expected, and so on. 

pseudocode. Informal specification of algorithms, expressed in language that is closer to 
English than an actual programming language, and usually without filling in every detail 
of the procedure. 

queue. A data structure consisting of a list of items, where items can only be added at one 
end and removed at the opposite end of the list.

race condition. A source of possible errors in parallel programming, where one thread can 
cause an error in another thread by changing some aspect of the state of the program 
that the second thread is depending on (such as the value of variable). 

RAM. Random Access Memory. This term is often used as a synonym for the main memory 
of a computer. Technically, however, it means memory in which all locations are equally 
accessible at any given time. The term also implies that data can be written to the 
memory as well as read from it. 

recursion. Defining something in terms of itself. In particular, a recursive subroutine is 
one that calls itself, either directly, or indirectly through a chain of other subroutines. 
Recursive algorithms work by reducing a complex problem into smaller problems which 
can be solved either directly or by applying the same algorithm "recursively." 

RGB. A color system in which colors are specified by three numbers (in Java, integers in the 
range to 255) giving the red, green, and blue components of the color. 

reference. Another term for "pointer." 

return type of a function. The type of value that is returned by that function. 

reserved word. A sequence of characters that looks like an identifier but can't be used as an 
identifier because it has a special meaning in the language. For example, class, public, 
and if are reserved words in Java. 

resource. An image, sound, text, or other data file that is part of a program. Resource files 
for Java programs are stored on the same class path where the compiled class files for 
the program are stored. 

robust program. A program is robust if it is not only correct, but also is capable of handling 
errors such as a non-existent file or a failed network connection in a reasonable way. 

set. A collection of objects which contains no duplicates. In Java, sets are represented by the 
generic interface Set<T> 

scope. The region in a program where the declaration of an identifier is valid. 

semantics. Meaning. The semantics rules of a language determine the meaning of strings of 
symbols (such as sentences or statements) in that language. 

sentinel value. A special value that marks the end of a sequence of data values, to indicate 
the end of the data. 

setter. An instance method in a class that is used to set the value of some property of that 
class. Usually the property is just the value of some instance variable. By convention, a 
setter is named setXyzO where xyz is the name of the property. 

signature of a method. The name of the method, the number of formal parameters in its 
definition, and the type of each formal parameter. Method signatures are the information 
needed by a compiler to tell which method is being called by a given subroutine call 
statement. 

socket. An abstraction representing one end of a connection between two computers on a 
network. A socket represents a logical connection between computer programs, not a 
physical connection between computers. 

stack. A data structure consisting of a list of items where items can only be added and removed 
at one end of the list, which is known as the "top" of the stack. Adding an item to a 
stack is called "pushing," and removing an item is called "popping." The term stack also 
refers to the stack of activation records that is used to implement subroutine calls.

state machine. A model of computation where an abstract "machine" can be in any of some 
finite set of different states. The behavior of the machine depends on its state, and the 
state can change in response to inputs or events. The basic logical structure of a GUI 
program can often be represented as a state machine. 

step- wise refinement. A technique for developing an algorithm by starting with a general 
outline of the procedure, often expressed in pseudocode, and then gradually filling in the 
details.

Java has four basic stream classes representing input and output of character and binary 
data. These classes form the foundation for Java's input/output API. 

source code. Text written in a high-level programming language, which must be translated 
into a machine language such as Java bytecode before it can be executed by a computer. 

subclass. A class that extends another class, directly or indirectly, and therefore inherits its 
data and behaviors. The first class is said to be a subclass of the second. 

subroutine. A sequence of program instructions that have been grouped together and given a 
name. The name can then be used to "call" the subroutine. Subroutines are also called 
methods in the context of object-oriented programming. 

subroutine call statement. A statement in a program that calls a subroutine. When a 
subroutine call statement is executed, the computer executes the code that is inside the 
subroutine. 

super. A special variable, automatically defined in any instance method, that refers to the 
object that contains the method, but considered as belonging to the superclass of the class 
in which the method definition occurs, super gives access to members of the superclass 
that are hidden by members of the same name in the subclass. 

syntax. Grammar. The syntax rules of a language determine what strings of symbols are 
legal — that is, grammatical — in that language. 

TCP/IP. Protocols that are used for network communication on the Internet. 

this. A special variable, automatically defined in any instance method, that refers to the object 
that contains the method. 

thread. An abstraction representing a sequence of instructions to be executed one after the 
other. It is possible for a computer to execute several threads in parallel. 

thread pool. A collection of "worker threads" that are available to perform tasks. As tasks 
become available, they are assigned to threads in the pool. A thread pool is often used 
with a blocking queue that holds the tasks. 

top-down design. An approach to software design in which you start with the problems, as a 
whole, subdivide it into smaller problems, divide those into even smaller problems, and 
so on, until you get to problems that can be solved directly. 

type. Specifies some specific kind of data values. For example, the type int specifies integer 
data values that can be represented as 32-bit binary numbers. In Java, a type can be 
a primitive type, a class names, or an interface name. Type names are used to specify 
the types of variables, of dummy parameters in subroutines, and of return values of 
subroutines. 

type cast. Forces the conversion of a value of one type into another type. For example, in 
(int) (6*Math.random()), the (int) is a type-cast operation that converts the double

value (6*Math. randomO ) into an integer by discarding the fractional part of the real 
number. 

Unicode. A way of encoding characters as binary numbers. The Unicode character set includes 
characters used in many languages, not just English. Unicode is the character set that is 
used internally by Java. 

URL. Universal Resource Locator; an address for a resource on the Internet, such as a web 
page. 

variable. A named memory location (or sequence of locations) that can be used to store 
data. A variable is created in a program, and a name is assigned to the variable, in a 
variable declaration statement. The name can then be used in that program to refer 
to the memory location, or to the data stored in that memory location, depending on 
context. In Java, a variable has a type, which specifies what kind of data it can hold. 

wrapper class. A class such as Double or Integer that makes it possible to "wrap" a primitive 
type value in an object belonging to the wrapper class. This allows primitive type 
values to be used in contexts were objects are required, such as with the Java Collection 
Framework. 

XML. extensible Markup Language. A very common and well-supported standard syntax for 
creating text-based data-representation languages.
