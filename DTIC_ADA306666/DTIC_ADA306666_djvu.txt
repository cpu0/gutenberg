Software for Advanced Vision Systems 

Progress Report - 6/15/95 
Thomas J. Olson and Worthy N. Martin 


The goal of the ARPA Advanced Vision Systems program (AVIS) is to develop hardware ac¬ 
celerators that will provide dramatic improvements in performance for machine vision, image 
processing, automatic target recognition, and other applications with similar processing needs. 
During phase I of the program our group conducted a study of software issues raised by the AVIS 
program. The goal of our current effort is to develop an abstract lower level interface for real-time 
computer vision accelerators. This interface will allow applications or development environments 
to control, sequence and synchronize with computations mnning on multiple accelerators without 
reference to vendor- or device-specific functionality. 

Activities to date: 

We delivered the final Phase I report on April 15th. One of the lessons of that effort was the 
importance of supporting the Khoros image processing and visualization environment. During the 
past three months we have been working to understand the Khoros process model and identify the 
options for supporting it on non-standard hardware. We plan to use this information to constrain 
the design of the abstract low-level API. 

Khoros 2.0 is a complete rewrite of the Khoros system. It is written in C, but uses function ta¬ 
bles to implement essential object-oriented language features such as dynamic inheritance. Any 
approach to supporting Khoros on AVIS architectures will likely make use of these features for 
the sake of maintainability and compatibility with other Khoros code. There appear to be two ba¬ 
sic strategies for accessing special hardware via Khoros. One is to create a subclass of the Khoros 
node type. Nodes in Khoros encapsulate the computational behavior of a dataflow graph operator. 
It would not be difficult to create a node that spawns child processes on an accelerator to do the 
bulk of its computation. The problem with this approach is that it would leave gross scheduling 
decisions under the control of the Khoros executive. 

A second approach to using special hardware via Khoros is to override the behavior of the 
Khoros Workspace object. It should be possible to create workspaces that support unique sets of 
nodes and schedule them according to unique protocols (e.g. static dependency graph scheduling). 
The advantage of this approach is that it should make it possible to use Khoros operators imple¬ 
mented as conventional workstation executables in combination with those that target an AVIS 
accelerator. This in turn would provide a smooth path for transitioning existing applications to the 
accelerator: Khoros operators could be recoded for the accelerator one at a time, providing incre¬ 
mental performance improvements. 

The main technical problem that we see concerns the difficulty of using multiple accelerator- 
based workspaces in a single application. The low- and intermediate-level software for some 
AVIS accelerators may require a global view of the computation, e.g. in order to perform static 
scheduling and resource allocation. Khoros is currently conceived as a highly dynamic system in 
which decisions of that type are made at run time. We are currently designing a Khoros interface 
to our statically scheduled VEIL system, in order to ensure that the approach we choose can meet 
these requirements.
