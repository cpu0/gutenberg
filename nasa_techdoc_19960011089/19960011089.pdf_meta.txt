x-archive-meta-description: The COMmercial Experiment Transporter (COMET) is a set of hardware and related infrastructure used to support orbital experiments of the CCDS's (Centers for Commercial Development of Space) and their industrial partners. During the nineteen months since the program started, contracts have been signed, design reviews conducted on all components, experiments selected for the first mission, almost all hardware has been manufactured, and a majority of components have completed testing. The Program Office and CCDS Monitors took an active role in the development, planning, and conduct of the actions leading to the first flight of COMET scheduled in the first quarter of 1993. The Recovery System/Site has been exercised, and the Launch Facility is well on its way toward completion. As October came to a close, most of the major components of the COMET FreeFlyer have come together in League City, TX for an integrated test.
