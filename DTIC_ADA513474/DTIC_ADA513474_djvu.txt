The design of peptide mimetic compounds is greatly facilitated by the identification of functionalities that 
can act as peptide replacements. The fluoroalkene moiety has recently been employed for that purpose. The 
purpose of this work is to examine the conformational ramifications of replacing peptide bonds with fluoroalkene 
moieties, thus generating peptidomimetics. The alanine dipeptide analogue (ADA) was chosen as a model 
compound. Three peptidomimetic systems were investigated including one generated by replacement of both 
peptide bonds of ADA, designated as DFA, and those generated by the single replacement of the C-terminal 
peptide bond and N-terminal peptide bond, designated as CFA and NFA, respectively. Conformations for all 
three systems were generated by exhaustive Monte Carlo searching. Relative conformational energies were 
calculated at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ/MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ (for DFA), MP2/-aug-cc-pVTZ//MP2/6-311+G(d,p), 
B3LYP/6-31+G(d)//B3LYP/6-31+G(d), and MMFF levels of theory. Aqueous phase conformational 
preferences were determined through calculations making use of continuum hydration models. The results 
indicate that replacement of both peptide bonds of ADA generates a peptidomimetic with conformational 
preferences where extended conformations are favored and the conformational profile is relatively insensitive 
to the nature of the surrounding medium. This is in contrast to ADA where the conformational preferences 
depend highly on the surrounding medium and where folded conformations with intramolecular hydrogen 
bonds are important in the absence of an interacting solvent. CFA and NFA are found to exhibit conformational 
preferences that do in some ways more closely resemble those of the alanine dipeptide analogue. This is 
particularly true in the case of NFA where interactions between the NH and CF groups are reminiscent of the 
intramolecular hydrogen bonding possible in ADA. 


Introduction 

The use of compounds that mimic peptides is widespread in 
pure and applied research of biochemical systems. Peptidomi¬ 
metics have great utility in fields ranging from medicinal 
chemistry to nanomaterials. For example, while peptides are 
attractive agents for probing the structure and function of a drug 
receptor, they have very limited potential as pharmaceutical 
agents themselves. They have a tendency to exhibit poor 
bioavailability and short physiological lifetimes. The problem 
lies in the fact that peptidic compounds are readily destroyed 
by hydrolytic enzymes such as peptidases.' Thus, a common 
strategy is to exploit the structural diversity offered by peptides 
to discover lead compounds and then create nonpeptidic versions 
that mimic the peptide’s structure and function. Representative 
examples of fluorolefin-based pepditomimetics that have been 
employed as enzyme inhibitors are shown below (Figure 1). 
Beyond drug discovery efforts, biomimetic strategies have also 
been applied in areas as diverse as the development of 
biologically inspired nanoscale devices,^ conformationally rigid 
peptide analogues designed to promote /? tums,^ and model 
compounds for the study of cell membrane activity.'* 

The design of an effective peptide mimetic hinges on finding 
a suitable replacement for the peptide bond. One strategy that 
has been adopted is to simply replace the peptide bond with an 
alkene bond.’ * This is a logical approach given that the peptide 
bond is considered to have significant partial double-bond

character as evidenced by its shorter bond distance and higher 
barrier to rotation (as compared to a purely single C—N bond). 
Replacement of a peptide bond with an alkene should produce 
a compound that is of roughly similar size and shape as the 
original peptide (the term “peptide isostere” is often used to 
describe such compounds). But, the electrostatic potential 
(distribution of charge on the molecular surface) that the mimetic 
presents to the intended receptor may not be well represented 
by the nonpolar alkene. As a result, the use of fluoroolefins has 
been suggested because the electronegativity of the fluorine atom 
is expected to create an isostere that has a more accurate 
representation of the electrostatic potential of the original peptide 
(see Figure 2). For example, Bartlett has investigated the 
effectiveness of fluoroalkenes as inhibitors of thermolysin,^ and 
Welch and co-workers employed fluoroolefin peptide mimetics

in the inhibition of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme (DPP 
IV) and the cyclophilin enzyme.Ceiplak and co-workers 
investigated the effectiveness of both olefins and fluoroolefins 
as inhibitors of the HIV-1 protease enzyme." Miller and co¬ 
workers have employed olefin isosteres as mechanistic probes 
in the development of peptide-based enantioselective catalysts.^ 
There has also been a great deal of work directed toward the 
synthesis^’*®’"^" of biologically active fluoroalkenes which is 
further evidence of their potential as mechanistic probes and 
therapeutic agents. 

In a previous work published in this journal,we employed 
high-level computational methods to compare the structures, 
electrostatic potentials, and intermolecular hydrogen bonding 
abilities of simple amides representing models of peptides to 
their fluoroalkene counterparts serving as model compounds for 
peptidomimetics (V-methylacetamide compared to 2-fluoro-2- 
butene, for example). In the present work, we extend this study 
to an examination of the ramifications of peptide bond replace¬ 
ment, by fluoroalkene mimics, on the conformational preferences 
of model peptides. The system chosen to serve as the model 
compound is the well-studied alanine dipeptide analogue (ADA) 
shown in Figure 3. There have been numerous computational'® 
and experimental'^’'* studies of the conformational distribution 
of ADA reported in the literature as this system has served as 
a prototype for the study of protein folding and in the 
development of computational methods designed to model 
proteins. The effect of solvent medium on the conformational 
distribution has also been investigated. The alanine dipeptide 
analogue possesses two peptide bonds flanking an alanine 
residue (capped with V-methyl and acetyl groups). We have 
investigated the conformational preferences of the peptidomi- 
metic generated by replacement of both peptide bonds with 
fluoroalkenes (DFA) as well as the two generated by single 
replacement of the N-terminal (NFA) and C-terminal peptide 
bonds CFA (see Figure 3). 

Computational Methods 

Conformational searching was done using the Monte Carlo 
multiple minimum (MCMM)'®’^® routines of the Maestro(v. 6.5)/ 


Macromodel-Batchmin(8.6)^' suite of programs. The number 
of Monte Carlo steps for the searches was 500 000. Energy 
minimization was performed with the MMFF94s force field, 
which is the Macromodel implementation of the MMFF force 
field.^^“^® Parameters for the Monte Carlo (MC) search were 
generated using the automatic setup routine. This results in 
inclusion of all rotatable bonds in the search with peptide bonds 
limited to a trans configuration. Newly found structures are 
compared against previously found ones by rigid superposition 
with a maximum distance of 0.25 A between heavy atoms 
allowed in order for the structures to be considered equal. The 
unique conformers that were obtained from the MC searches 
provided the input structures for optimizations with the quantum 
mechanical methods. MC searches were also run in the aqueous 
medium by use of the GB/SA^^ continuum hydration model as 
implemented in Macromodel. The quantum mechanical studies 
were conducted with the Gaussian03^* suite of programs. 
Complete geometry optimizations were carried out for all 
systems with the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set at the MP2^^ level of 
theory and with the 6-31+G(d) basis set using the B3LYP*®’'" 
hybrid density functional. Single-point energies at the MP2/ 
aug-cc-pVDZ and MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ levels of theory were 
obtained for all minima resulting from the MP2/6-311+G(d,p) 
optimizations. For the DFA systems, optimizations at MP2/aug- 
pVDZ were also performed. To include the effect of solvent in 
the quantum mechanical calculations, the default IEF-PCM*^“*® 
aqueous continuum model of Gaussian03 was used. All minima 
were confirmed as such through vibrational frequency calculations. 

In conducting these studies, every effort was made to be as 
exhaustive as possible in terms of the inclusion of input 
structures that could potentially lead to conformational minima. 
This was handled though the use of extensive Monte Carlo 
searching to provide initial geometries for optimization with 
quantum mechanical methods with Gaussian03 as outlined 
above. But, it was also emphasized in the manner in which the 
Gaussian03 calculations were approached. For example, all of 
the output structures from the MC studies served as input 
structures for optimizations with MP2/6-311+G(d,p) and B3LYP/ 
6-31+G(d). However, if a structure was obtained at B3LYP 
that was not among the set of those obtained with MP2, it would 
also be explicitly subjected to optimization at the MP2 level. 
This includes the aqueous phase versus the gas phase calcula¬ 
tions as well. For example, if the set of minima obtained from 
aqueous phase (GB/SA) Monte Carlo searches included struc¬ 
tures that were not among the set obtained from the gas phase 
searches (where no solvent model was used), these new 
structures would be subjected to both gas and aqueous phase 
Gaussian03 optimizations. Thus, whenever a method (gas phase, 
aqueous phase, MMFF, B3LYP, MP2) generated a novel 
structure, that structure was subjected to optimization with all 
methods.

also obtained with the B3LYP/6-3H-G(d) density functional 
method and the Merck molecular force field (MMFF)^^^^® as 
implemented in Maestro/Macromodel. Table 2 shows the 
thermochemical corrections. 

In a comprehensive study of conformational preferences of 
peptide model compounds, Kaminsky and Jensen^® endorsed 
the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory as capable of highly 
accurate (~1 kl) conformational energies. In their study, MP2/ 
aug-cc-pVDZ was employed for final refinement of geometries 
(following initial optimizations and characterization of minima 
via frequency calculations at the MP2/6-31G(d) level). We have 
employed geometry optimization (and characterization via 
frequency calculation) at both the MP2/6-311-I-G(d,p) and MP2/ 
aug-cc-pVDZ levels of theory. For the DFA system, the results 
indicate a negligible difference between the geometries and 
subsequent single-point energies at higher levels of theory. The 
dihedral angles obtained with the two methods are within a few 
degrees of each other. Comparison of the MP2-II results to those 
of MP2-IV, and MP2-II to those of MP2-V, reveals agreement 
in conformational energies that are within hundredths of a kcal/ 
mol. Because of the increased computational efficiency (espe¬ 
cially in the frequency calculations), the MP2/6-311-I-G(d,p) 
level of theory was employed for geometries and frequencies 
in the subsequent systems under study in this work. 

We are interested in determining if the conformational 
preferences of DFA reported above resemble those that have

two studies throughout this work. In some instances, the same 
conformations are referred to by different names in these two 
studies as indicated in Table 3. Table 4 shows the standard <1>, 
W angles associated with common structural motifs in proteins. 

Overall, the gas phase conformational profile for the double¬ 
replacement peptidomimetc DFA does not closely resemble that 
which has been reported in the literature for the alanine dipeptide 
analogue (ADA). For example, the lowest-energy structure, 
DFAl, with its <I>, W dihedral angle values of — 118.9°, 118.3°, 
is rather extended. These values are close to the —119°, 113° 
values quoted for parallel /3 sheet structures (Table 4). For the 
alanine dipeptide analogue, the C7eq conformation (Figure 5) 
is found to be the lowest energy gas phase structure.'®’^® It has 
<1>,W values of approximately —80°, 80° and is characterized 
by an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the N-terminal 
side carbonyl and the C-terminal side N—H resulting in a seven- 
membered ring. The C5 (jSl) conformer is the second-lowest 
energy structure. It is an extended conformer and possesses a 
favorable electrostatic arrangement of the N—H bond on the 
N-terminal side and the C=0 bond on the C-terminal side 
(Table 1). When the peptide bond is replaced with a fluoroalk- 
ene, the hydrogen bond donor NH group is replaced by a CH 
moiety and the carbonyl acceptor is replaced by a C—F bond. 
On both the donor and acceptor counts, a significant reduction

in hydrogen bonding ability is expected, and thus a perturbation 
of the conformational profile is expected. We have previously 
reported on the hydrogen bonding patterns of fluoroalkene 
peptidomimetics by examining their interactions with water 
molecules.'^ In fact, structures resembling hydrogen-bonded 
complexes were found with high-level ab initio calculations, 
but with significantly reduced binding energies compared to their 
peptide counterparts. Also, the geometries were quite different 
for the fluoroalkene—water complexes in that the C—F—H—O 
bond vectors were oriented in near orthogonal arrangements. 

Thus, the absence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond results 
in an extended global minimum in the gas phase for DFA in 
contrast to ADA for which a folded structure with an intramo¬ 
lecular hydrogen bond is the global minimum in the absence 
of a solvent medium. Comparison of the remaining conforma¬ 
tions of DFA (Table 1) and ADA (Table 3) reveals further 
differences. For example, the second-highest energy DFA 
conformer, DFA2, has <1>, W values of — 114.4°, — 114.3°. This 
bears no resemblance to any of the ADA gas phase conformers 
in Table 3. It bears no great resemblance to any of the standard 
backbone conformations cited in Table 4 either. The closest 
agreement is to the right-handed a helix, but there is still a 
significant deviation from those O, W values of —57°, —47°. 
DFA3 and DFA4 occupy regions of <1>,W space that are unlike 
any populated by ADA. The closest standard conformation from 
Table 4 to DFA4 (94.9°, 114.5°) is the left-handed a helix at 
57°, 47°. DFA5, at 78.4°, —10.5°, most closely resembles the 
C7ax conformation of ADA which is reported to be 2.3 kcal/ 
mol above the ground state with <1>, W values of 74°, —54° by 
Kaminsky,^® with similar results reported by Wang and Duan.'® 
DFA5b and DFA5m are variants that are only found with 
B3LYP/6-3H-G(d) and MMFF, respectively. DFA6 is near the 
region between the C7eq and /? regions with O, W values of 
-24.0°, 123.9°. DFA7 at 65.9°, -117.1° is nearest the Cl^ 
conformation. 

While intramolecular hydrogen bonding is a determining 
factor in the case of ADA in the gas phase, analogous 
interactions do not appear to play a major role in the DFA 
system. Figure 4 shows a dashed line between atoms that are 
potentially engaged in an attractive interaction. These appear 
in conformations DFAl, DFA3, and DFA5, and the gas phase 
and aqueous phase values for the corresponding interatomic 
distances are recorded in Table 5. The conformational energies 
in Tables 1 and 2 reveal that, in the gas phase, there are three 
low-energy conformations that are nearly isoenergetic. At the 
highest levels of theory, DFAl, DFA2, and DFA3 are all within 
0.5 kcal/mol of the global minimum, in terms of AE, zero-point 
energy corrected A£, and AE and NH at 298 K. The next lowest 
energy conformation is significantly higher in energy. DFA5 is 
1.92 kcal/mol above the ground state at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ 
level and 2.03 at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level for the MP2/aug- 
cc-pVDZ geometry with very similar results obtained using the 
MP2/6-31 H-G(d,p) optimized geometry. It is interesting to note 
that for those structures where there is close contact between 
C—H—F—C groups, the geometries are different than those of 
the cyclic hydrogen-bonded ADA C7ax and C7eq structures. For

the fluorinated peptide mimics, the C—H and F—C bond vectors 
are skewed rather than arranged in a traditional hydrogen bond 
donor—acceptor arrangement as seen in the ADA case. This is 
reminiscent of the geometrical differences that are observed 
between water complexes of amides and fluoroalkenes that we 
reported previously.'^ 

Inspection of the Table 1 data further indicates that there is 
reasonable agreement between the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) results 
and those obtained at the MP2 level with the aug-cc-pVDZ and 
aug-cc-VTZ basis sets. B3LYP/6-3H-G(d) also predicts three 
low-energy conformations and three higher-energy conforma¬ 
tions, although the spread among them is somewhat greater than 
that observed in the MP2 results. With B3LYP, the three low- 
energy conformations span a range of 0.89 kcal/mol, and the 
highest energy conformation is 3.33 kcal/mol above the ground 
state. But, the overall depiction of the conformational prefer¬ 
ences of DFA in the gas phase is reasonably well reproduced 
with B3LYP/6-31+G(d). This is somewhat surprising as the 
poor performance of B3LYP and other density functional 
approaches with respect to dispersive interactions, which 
certainly play a role in determining conformational energies, 
has been noted in the literature.^®^'" The reasonably good 
agreement that is seen here may be attributable to the relatively 
small size of the systems under study and the very low 
polarizability of fluorine. The MMFF force field also predicts 
DFAl to be the global minimum but also predicts all other 
structures to be more than 2 kcal/mol above the ground state. 
Thus, it misses the fact that DFA2 and DFA3 are also very low 
energy structures. 

In the absence of specific interactions akin to hydrogen 
bonding, one might expect the relative energies of the DFA 
conformations in the gas phase to be highly correlated with 
dipole moment with structures possessing a favorable cancel¬ 
lation of bond dipoles, and thus a low dipole moment, to 
predominate in the gas phase. DFAl is the lowest energy 
stnrcture with all computational methods and also has the lowest 
dipole moment (calculated at MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ). But, DFA2 
and DFA3 have significant dipole moments and are found, at 
least by the quantum mechanical methods, to be nearly as stable 
as DFAl in the gas phase. The MMFF results do mirror the 
trend in dipole moment in that the least polar structure, DFAl,

is found to be the minimum and all of the other structures, with 
significantly higher dipole moments, are found to be significantly 
higher in energy. 

We have also conducted calculations with the PCM^^“^^ 
continuum aqueous solvation model (Tables 6 and 7). One 
would certainly not expect compounds such as DFA to be water- 
soluble. Flowever, our motivation is simply to see how sensitive 
the conformational preferences of the fluoroalkene moiety are 
to dielectric effect of the surrounding medium. The PCM 
continuum model provides a convenient way to alter the 
medium, and the gas phase and aqueous phase simply provide 
benchmarks that span a wide range of possible environments. 
This is relevant to the fundamental question addressed in this 
work in terms of the conformational ramifications of peptide 
bond replacement in that one could imagine a larger oligopep¬ 
tide, or even an engineered protein, that contains selected peptide 
bond replacements among a large array of native peptide bonds. 
In that scenario, the fluoroalkene might find itself in a variety 
of local environments, and thus the desire to examine the 
response in conformational preferences upon the variation of 
surrounding environment exists. 

The native alanine dipeptide analogue exhibits a dependency 
on the surrounding environment with respect to its conforma¬ 
tional preferences.For example, the recent (2009) 
study of Lee et al. has proposed that ADA has an extended 
structure resembling a j3 strand or C5 in the solid state, a more 
cyclic structure with intramolecular hydrogen bonding such as 
C7eq or ttL in a nonpolar solvent (TFIF), and the polyproline II 
structure (Pn) in an aqueous environment.''^ Earlier works have

also noted a difference in the conformation between the aqueous 
phase, where the Pn structure is proposed to be important,'*^ 
and environments lacking a highly interacting solvent (Ar 
matrix, nonpolar solvents) where C7eq and C5 are found to be 
important.'^^ In the 2004 Duan and Wang study, the Pn structure 
was also identified as being important in aqueous solution 
especially when explicit waters were employed in the calcula¬ 
tions which resulted in an increase in the importance of /3 (which 
resembles Pn) and a decreased importance of C5.'® 

DFA, on the other hand, is predicted to display very little 
variability in its conformational equilibrium with respect to the 
surrounding environment. In the aqueous phase, conformations 
DFAl, DFA2, and DFA3 are found to be essentially isoenergetic 
at the global minimum (Table 6), just as they are in the gas 
phase (Table 1). They are calculated to span a range of only 
0.10 kcal/mol at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ//MP2/6-311+G(d,p) 
level with nearly identical results obtained at MP2/aug-cc- 
pVTZ//MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ. The remaining conformations are 
also very close in energy to each other and lie roughly 2 kcal/ 
mol above the most favored conformer. Thus, the conforma¬ 
tional profile of DFA in water is essentially identical to that in 
the gas phase. This situation is adequately captured by the 
B3LYP/6-31+G(d) calculations. However, as was seen in the 
gas phase, B3LYP predicts a slightly expanded range of energies 
with the low-lying conformations spanning a range of 0.55 kcaP 
mol and the highest-energy conformation located 3.29 kcal/mol 
above the ground state. MMFF with the GB/SA continuum 
solvent model does not reproduce the quantum mechanical 
results exactly. But, it does also predict the same conformer 
(DFAl) to be the global minimum in water as in the gas phase. 
However, a total of only five conformers are found in the 
aqueous phase with DFA4 1.06 kcal/mol above the ground state 
and the others 1.78—2.40 kcal/mol above the ground state. 


Thus, the gas and aqueous phase conformational profiles of 
the doubly replaced peptide mimic DFA are predicted to be 
very similar to one another. The next important question to ask 
is whether the solvent-invariant conformational distribution of 
the mimic resembles the conformer distribution that the native 
alanine dipeptide exhibits in the gas phase, the aqueous phase, 
or neither. Clearly, DFA’s conformational preferences are not 
very similar to the gas phase preferences of ADA because an 
intramolecular interaction analogous to the hydrogen bonding 
in C7eq, which dominates the ADA conformational landscape 
in the gas phase and nonpolar solvents, is not observed for DFA. 
However, there are some similarites to the aqueous phase ADA 
conformer distribution in that the lowest energy conformations 
(DFAl and DFA2) are rather extended. 

Alanine Dipeptide Analogue: C-Terminal Peptide Bond 
Replacement (CFA). Figure 6 shows the conformations that 
were found to be minima in the gas phase for the peptide mimic 
where the C-terminal peptide bond has been replaced by a 
fluoroalkene moiety (CFA). Energetic information, for both the 
gas and aqueous phases, can be found in Tables 8 and 9 (with 
thermochemical corrections in the Supporting Information). 

For CFA, four conformations are found to lie within just over 
1 kcal/mol of the minimum (span a range of 1.16 kcal/mol with 
MP2-III). The lowest-energy structure, CFAl, exhibits O.'F 
values of —80.9° and 113.1°. It bears some resemblance to the 
C7eq conformation that was found as the gas phase global 
minimum for the alanine dipeptide analogue by Kaminsky and 
Jensen^^ and Wang and Duan.'® The C7eq <3J,’F values in those 
studies were —82°, 76° and —82.0°, 80.6°, respectively. The 
next highest energy conformer, designated CFA2, is also 
somewhat similar to the second-highest ADA conformer, C5 
(called /3 l in the Kaminsky/Jensen study), with <I>,W values of 
—80.9°, 113.1° compared to —161°, 157° in ADA.^® However,

the conformer was calculated to lie roughly 1.5 kcal/mol 
above the global minimum in the Kaminsk/Jensen and Wang/ 
Duan studes, but CFA2 is seen here to be nearly isoenergetic 
with the ground state (0.44 and 0.20 kcal/mol above the ground 
state at the MP2-I and MP2-II levels, respectively). CFA2 was 
not found as a minimum with B3LYP, and it was the global 
minimum with MMFF. 

DFA was not found to exhibit a C7eq-like conformation. The 
ground state conformation for DFA is much more similar to 
the extended C5 (a.k.a /3 l) ADA conformer. C7eq contains a 
close contact (2.026 A) in the Kaminsky/Jensen^® MP2/aug-cc- 
pVDZ structure) consistent with a C=0—H—N hydrogen bond. 
As described above, the calculations for DFA reveal that this 
type of interaction is not an important contributor to the DFA 
conformational landscape. It is interesting to note that in CFA, 
where the N-terminal side of the dipeptide analogue is peptidic 
and only the C-terminal side is fluoroolehnic, a conformation 
resembling the C7eq conformation is found to be the global 
minimum. Figure 7 shows a direct comparison of the C7eq 
conformation of ADA and the CFAl conformation. The larger 
W angle in CFAl results in a much greater separation (3.274 
A) between the C=0 and H—C moieties. One would certainly 
not expect the H—C of CFA to be as potent a hydrogen bond 
donor as the corresponding H—N of ADA. Also, the larger W 
value orients the C—F bond more parallel to the opposing dipole 
of the C=0 bond. But, clearly, there is a similarity between 
the two conformations. This is important because it suggests 
that a single fluoroaUcene, incorporated into a longer polypeptide, 
might not perturb the conformational preferences of the system 
drastically. The fluoroalkene moiety provides the opportunity 
to examine a peptide bond replacement that retains the dipolar 
characteristics of the C=0 bond of a peptide, but lacks the 
hydrogen bond donating ability of the N—H group. The 
similarity between the CFA2 conformer and C7eq of ADA 
suggests that this dipolar characteristic is enough to orient an 


adjacent native peptide bond or be oriented by an adjacent 
peptide moiety as the case may be, in a fashion not very different 
from that seen in ADA. A similar situation may be present in 
cases of other peptide replacements that possess a component 
that mimics the C=0 bond dipole but lack an NH hydrogen 
bond donor (A-alkyl peptides, for example).'*^-'^^ 

There are also other conformations among the gas phase 
minima found for CFA that bear resemblance to alanine 
dipeptide analogue conformations that have previously been 
reported. For example, the CFA3 conformation is found to be 
only 1.16 kcal/mol above the ground state at the highest level 
of theory employed here. This conformation closely matches 
the ttR conformation of ADA which was found to lie 3.2 kcal/ 
mol above the ground state by Wang and Duan (called in 
the Kaminsky/Jensen study). The backbone dihedral angles of 
ADA ttL (—83°, —10°)^® are mimicked very well by CFA3 
(—90.5°, —5.26°). CFA5, 2.28 kcal/mol above the ground state, 
is similar to the 6 d ADA conformation reported by Kaminsky 
and Jensen and identified as tto by Wang and Duan. The ADA 
version of this conformation has O, W values of 53.0°, —133.4° 
compared to 60.3°, —120.4° for CFA5. These results indicate 
that the intrinsic conformational profile of the alanine dipeptide 
analogue, which serves as a model for larger peptides, is better 
represented by CFA than DFA. This is perhaps not surprising 
given that DFA contains two peptide bond replacements and 
CFA retains a peptide linkage and incorporates only one 
fluoroalkene replacement. 

Table 9 contains the relative energies and dihedral angle 
information for CFA in the aqueous phase. The CFAl confor¬ 
mation is found to be the global minimum in the gas phase as 
it was in the aqueous phase. The backbone dihedral angles of 
the minimum found in the aqueous phase (—88.4°, 117.6°) are 
very similar it those of the gas phase CFAl (—80.9°, 113.1), 
and there are only subtle differences in the important interatomic 
distances. For example, the distance between the carbonyl

oxygen and the vinylic hydrogen opens up from 3.2740 to 
3.4904 A in going from gas to aqueous phase. Presumably, in 
the absence of a dielectric continuum, there are stronger 
electrostatic interactions between these partially charged atoms. 
Interestingly, the CFA2 conformation is not found to be a 
minimum on the aqueous phase potential energy surface. All 
attempts to locate this structure in the aqueous phase optimiza¬ 
tions led to the CFAl structure. The major difference between 
the two conformations involves rotation about <1> thus rotating 
the peptide moiety. Presumably, it is the hydration of the peptide 
moiety that results in the loss of CFA2 as a minimum in the 
presence of an aqueous medium. 

Conformations CFA3, CFA4, CFA5, CFA6, and CFA8 are 
all found to be minima in the aqueous phase and possess 
structures that are closely related to their gas phase counterparts 
with backbone dihedral angles that are well within 10°. CFA7 
is not found to be a minimum on the aqueous phase potential 
energy surface. Upon optimization, this structure moves to the 
CFA3 conformation in the aqueous phase. 

The picture that emerges for CFA in the aqueous phase is 
that there are three conformations (CFAl, CFA3, CFA4) that 
are within 0.49 kcal/mol of the ground state at the MP2-III level 
of theory. In the gas phase, conformations CFAl through CFA4 
span a gap of 1.16 kcal/mol. In both the gas and aqueous phase, 
conformations CFA5 through CFA8 are significantly higher in 
energy and are not expected to be highly populated under either 
condition. Clearly, the most significant difference between the 
gas and aqueous phase conformational landscape for this system 
is the loss of CFA2 from the aqueous phase. 

As discussed above for the DFA system, in addition to 
comparing the conformational profile of the mimic to that of 
ADA, we are also interested in evaluating the performance of 
more computationally efficient methods (MMFF and B3LYP) 
by comparing the results to those obtained with the highest- 
level ab initio methods used in this study. For the CFAl system, 
B3LYP/6-31+G(d) does a reasonable job of representing the 
MP2-III results with some notable differences. B3LYP captures 
the essence of the CFA conformational profile in that it places 
CFA5 through CFA8 far above the low-energy conformations 
among CFAl through CFA4. However, CFA2 is not found on 
the B3LYP conformational energy surface in either the gas or 
aqueous phases. Also, the energetic ordering of CFA3 and CFA4 
is reversed in the aqueous phase relative to the MP2-III result. 
The story is more complex with MMFF (as implemented in 
Macromodel). In the gas phase, it does not find CFAl as a 
minimum. CFA2 is found to be the global minimum instead. 
Also, CFA3 is not found as a minimum on the CFA gas phase 
potential. In addition, a conformation, designated CFA4m, which 
is not well represented by any of the existing CFA conforma¬ 
tions but is somewhat similar to /Janti sheet, is found by MMFF. 
In the aqueous phase, MMFF finds a number of conformations 
that are different from those identified from the other studies. 
These are identified in Table 7 as CFA9m through CFAl Im. If 
a particular structure was deemed to be somewhat related to 
one of the existing ones, this was indicated in the nomenclature 
(for example, CFA8m is related to the CFA8 conformation). 
The MMFF aqueous phase ground state, CFA9m, has backbone 
dihedrals of —153.6°, 117.5° in comparison to the —88.4°, 
117.6° values for CFAl. The CFA2 conformation is not found 
to exist as a minimum on the aqueous phase MMFF potential 
energy surface.

peptide bond of alanine dipeptide analogue has been replaced 
by a fluoroalkene moiety, NFA. The energies and backbone 
dihedral angles for this set of conformations can be found in 
Table 10 for the gas phase and Table 11 for the aqueous phase 
(with thermochemical corrections for each in the Supporting 
Information). The MP2/6-311+G(d,p) optimizations of a large 
number of initial structures resulted in only six conformations. 
Two low-energy conformations, NFAl and NFA2, are found 
at 0.00 and 0.49 kcal/mol, respectively, at the MP2-III level. 
The remaining conformations all lie significantly higher in 
energy. The NFAl structure closely resembles the C7eq con¬ 
formation that is the gas phase global minimum for ADA. The 
NFAl 0,'F values of —92.4°, 85.3° compare very favorably 
with the literature ADA values (-82°, 76°^® and -82.0°, 80.6°'*^) 
for the calculations in the absence of solvent. This structure 
provides a better mimic of the C7eq ADA structure than CFA2 
(see Figure 7). The C—F—H—N interaction appears to be a 
better representation of the C=0—H—N interaction than the 
C=0—H—C interaction in CFA2. As indicated in Figure 8, 
the F—H distance of this interaction is 2.407 A, which indicates 
a much stronger interaction compared to the 3.774 A value for 
the O—H distance in CFA2. Thus, it would appear, at least 
based on the intrinsic conformational preferences in the absence 
of a surrounding medium, that replacing the C-terminal peptide 
linkage of alanine dipeptide analogue with a fluoroalkene 
represents a greater conformational perturbation than replacing 
the N-terminal peptide. The NFA2 structure is also found to be 
very low in energy. In this structure, the mean plane of the 
fluoroalkene is nearly perpendicular to that of the peptide 
moiety, and the NH bond vector of the peptide points toward 
the fluoroalkene with the carbonyl O oriented away from it. 

The remaining conformations are significantly higher in 
energy, but some also resemble ADA conformations. For 
example, NFA3 (53.5°, 36.8°) is similar to the ttL (63.2°, 35.4°) 
conformation of the Wang/Duan ADA study (which is denoted 
tto in the Kaminsky/Jensen study of ADA). It also bears close 
resemblance to the standard left-handed helix structure (Table 
4). Also, NFA4 (79.6, —69.3) is very similar to the C7ax 
conformation of ADA (Kaminsky/Jensen, 74°, —54°; Wang/ 
Duan, 75.8°, —62.8°). This conformation is an interesting 
structure because it possesses an intramolecular hydrogen bond 
between the H—N of the C-terminal peptide and the C=0 of 
the N-terminal peptide. The structure is shown in Figure 5, and 
an alternate view is presented in Figure 9 with a direct 
comparison to NFA4. The interatomic F—H distance of 2.102 
A in the fluoroalkene mimic is longer than the corresponding 
value in the native alanine dipeptide analogue (1.886 A), but, 
clearly, the NFA4 conformation captures the salient features of 
the C7ax conformation.

(MP2/6-311+G(d,p). The interatomic distances indicated by the dashed 
lines are 1.886 (left) and 2.102 (right) A. 

Thus, compared to DFA and CFA, the NFA system provides 
the clearest examples of conformations where interactions that 
mimic the familiar intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions 
between adjacent peptide groups in the alanine dipeptide 
analogue can be identified. These kinds of interactions are 
present in both NFAl and NFA4 mimicking those of C7eq and 
C7ax, respectively, in ADA. Previous work'^’'*^“^“ has indicated 
that the C—F bond is not expected to be nearly as effective a 
hydrogen bond acceptor as the C=0 group in the native peptide. 
It is interesting to note, however, that the energy gap between 
these two conformations is calculated to be nearly the same in 
their respective systems. For ADA, C7ax is been found to be 
approximately 2.5 kcal/mol above the ground state C7eq.'^’^® In 
this work, with MP2-III, the corresponding NFA4 is found to 
be 2.67 kcal/mol above the ground state NFAl in the gas phase. 


Also, examination of both of the possible single-replacement 
compounds, CFA and NFA, indicates that the combination of 
a native N—H hydrogen bond donor and a C—F replacement 
acceptor (as in NFAl, NFA4) seems to be a better representation 
of a hydrogen bond than the alternative where the C=0 acceptor 
is retained and the N—H donor been replaced by a vinylic C—H 
group (as in CFA2). 

The aqueous phase results for the NFA system are shown in 
Table 11. The NFAl conformation is found to be the global 
minimum as it was in the gas phase. The backbone dihedral 
angles in the aqueous phase are substantially different from the 
gas phase version of the structure. They change from —92.4°, 
85.3° to —123.9°, 120.0° which corresponds to the structure 
opening up to a more extended backbone (i.e., becoming more 
like the C5 (/3l) structure (Table 3) or like a standard parallel 
P sheet (Table 4)). The Wang/Duan study reports dihedral angles 
for both gas phase and aqueous phase conformations of ADA 
(Table 3). The C7eq conformation is —82.0°, 80.6° in the gas 
phase and —86.3°, 90.1° in the aqueous phase structure. Thus, 
the effect of aqueous hydration is the same as what is seen here 
with NFAl, but the magnitude of the effect is far less significant. 
The NFA2 conformation is not found as a minimum on the 
aqueous MP2/6-311+G(d,p) potential energy surface. The next 
highest energy conformer in the aqueous phase is NFA7 which 
resembles the ttR structure of the Wang/Duan'® ADA study 
(which is called ttL in the Kaminsky/Jensen^® study). This is a 








1132 J. Phys. Chem. A, Vo/. 114, No. 2, 2010 


McKinney and Urban 


new conformer that was not found to be a minimum in the gas 
phase studies. NFA7 is predicted to lie 1.43 kcal/mol above 
the ground state with MP2-III. 

The impact of hydration causes other shifts in relative 
conformational energy ordering. The NFA4 structure, which 
resembles C7ax of ADA, increases significantly in relative 
energy, from 2.67 to 4.55 kcal/mol at the highest level of theory 
employed here. Other conformations become more competitive 
upon the consideration of hydration effects. For example, at 
MP2-III, NFA6 goes from a relative energy in the gas phase of 
4.80 to 2.87 kcal/mol. NFA5 goes from 3.26 to 1.88 kcal/mol. 
NFA3, which is similar to the standard left-handed helix, has 
roughly the same relative energy in the gas phase is in the 
aqueous. 

Tables 10 and 11 allow for an assessment of the performance 
of B3LYP/6-31+G(d) and MMFF, relative to that ofMP2/aug- 
cc-pVTZ//MP2/6-311+G(d,p) (MP2-III) for the NFA system. 
The B3LYP/6-31+G(d,) results closely mirror the higher-level 
ab initio results in both the gas phase and in aqueous solution. 
Most of the B3LYP relative energies are within tenths of a kcal/ 
mol of the MP2-III results. The exception is the NFA3 
conformation whose relative energy is slightly overestimated 
by B3LYP compared to the MP2-III results. The trends in going 
from the gas phase to the aqueous phase are also well 
represented by the PCM-B3LYP results. MMFF does predict 
NFAl to be the ground state conformation in the both the gas 
and aqueous phases. Flowever, NFA2, predicted to be very close 
to the minimum in the gas phase with the quantum mechanical 
methods, is predicted with MMFF to be 5.89 kcal/mol above 
the minimum. Also, as seen in the CFA system, a large number 
of additional conformations (denoted NFA7m through NFA12m) 
are found to be minima on the MMFF potential surface that 
are not found to be minima with the quantum mechanical 
methods. 

Conclusions 

A computational investigation using high levels of ab initio 
theory as well as more computationally efficient methods has 
been conducted to investigate the conformational ramifications 
of substitution of a peptide bond by a fluoroalkene moiety thus 
generating a peptidomimetic. This is a follow-up study to the 
investigation of the hydrogen bonding tendencies of fluoroalkene 
peptidomimetics reported previously in this journal.'^ 

The alanine dipeptide (ADA) analogue was employed as a 
model peptide compound. It was found that replacement of both 
of the peptide bonds of ADA, thus generating DFA, resulted in 
a significant impact on the predicted conformational profile of 
the molecule. DFA does not assume conformations that are 
representative of the intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded con¬ 
formations that have been identified previously as an important 
aspect of the intrinsic (in the absence of interacting solvent) 
ADA conformational profile. Also, the conformational profile 
of DFA shows little solvent dependence, while that of ADA 
shows a great deal of dependence on the surrounding medium. 
The solvent dependence in ADA is due in large part to the fact 
that folded intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded structures com¬ 
pete well in the absence of an aqueous medium, but more 
extended conformations, which allow polar groups to be 
adequately hydrated, are important in the presence of an aqueous 
phase. The absence of strong intramolecular attractions in DFA 
makes it prefer extended conformations in both scenarios. 

Peptide mimics that retain one of the two peptide bonds of 
ADA were also investigated. In the CFA model peptide mimic, 
the C-terminal peptide bond was replaced with a fluoroalkene 


and the N-terminal peptide bond retained. For CFA, four 
conformations were found in the absence of solvent to be within 
1.16 kcal/mol of the ground state. The lowest-energy structure 
bears some resemblance to the C7eq conformer of ADA which 
has been identified as the ground state conformation of ADA 
in the gas phase, and the next highest energy structure bears 
resemblance to the next highest, C5(/3l), in the series of ADA 
conformations in the gas phase. However, in the aqueous phase, 
this conformation disappears from the conformational energy 
surface for CFA. The alternative singly substituted mimic, NFA, 
which contains a fluoroalkene replacement of the N-terminal 
peptide bond of ADA, is predicted to possess a conformational 
profile that reflects key attributes of that of ADA. For example, 
conformational minima were obtained for NFA with an ar¬ 
rangement of the C—F—H—N bond vectors that closely mimics 
the intramolecular hydrogen bond in the C7eq and C7ax 
conformations of the ADA dipeptide. The geometry indicates 
that the intramolecular interaction is not as tight in the case of 
the fluoroalkene mimic, but the relative energy of the two 
conformations in the mimic is very similar to that of ADA. In 
aqueous solvent, an extended, /I-sheet-like structure predominates. 

If one were to investigate with a computational approach the 
conformational preferences of much larger peptidic systems that 
incorporate fluoroalkenes as selected peptide bond replacements, 
one would need a much more computationally efficient method 
than the ab initio calculations reported here. For this reason, 
results were also obtained with the MMFF force field and the 
B3LYP/6-31+G(d) approach. In general, the conformational 
preferences at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ//MP2/6-311+G(d,p) level 
were quite well represented by the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) results. 
The force field calculations with MMFF were able to capture 
many of the salient features of the conformational profile, but 
with occasional significant discrepancies.
