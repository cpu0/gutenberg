Title: Application of design patterns in refactoring software design 

Refactoring software design is a method of changing software design while 
explicitly preserving its unique design functionalities. Presented approach is to 
utilize design patterns as the basis for refactoring software design. Comparison 
of a design solution will be made through C++ programming language examples 
to exploit this approach. 

Developing reusable component will be discussed, the paper presents that the 
construction of such components can diminish the added burden of both 
refactoring and the use of design patterns.
