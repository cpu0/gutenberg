DEVELOPMENT OF A MENU DRIVEN MATERIALS DATA BASE 
FOR USE ON PERSONAL COMPUTERS 


by 

R.H. KAYE 


SUMMARY 

This Memorandum presents a PC based, menu driven materials data base for the engineering 
related properties of advanced structural materials. General materials information and 
suppliers' details are also provided. Data retrieval is performed by a TURBO PASCAL 
program of less than 100 lines, accessing several separate text files. This program will run 
under most MSDOS installations. Response time and accessing time is negligible on any IBM 
XT (or faster) machine and a graphics adaptor is not required.

1. INTRODUCTION 

This work was undertaken to provide a PC based reference tool for use within the Aircraft 
Structures and Materials Division of the Aeronautical Research Laboratory, for the 
mechanical properties and suppliers of the composite materials and adhesives routinely 
used in the Division. For maximum portability, the package was developed to run on 
machines using MS-DOS and to use a modest amount of disk space and RAM. Elaborate 
graphics displays and other cosmetic features were not required. However, the software 
was required to be robust if not crash-proof. The task of comprehensively validating the 
data provided is beyond the scope of this initial report. As with all materials properties 
data the information provided should be regarded with caution. 


2. STRATEGY FOR THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT 

The language TURBO PASCAL was chosen for this task. It is an easy language to use, 
MS-DOS specific and offers easy access to operating system functions from within the 
code. 

The programming task is simplified if data searching is performed using the MS-DOS file 
accessing facilities. The data access time was optimised by using separate files for each 
section of data. The program was further simplified restricting each section of data to one 
screen full of text. 

To simplify data entry and editing the data file was constructed in an ASCII (text-with- 
line-breaks) format. This enables a range of text editors to be used. 

2.1 Menus File Listing 

For ease of editing and programming, the text of the menus was also written as a.^ ASCII 
file. An identification number was placed above each menu so that its place in the menu 
tree could be determined. The first digit gives the level number (ie. 1 for the main menu, 
2 for the next level down etc.). The other digit is the option number chosen from the root 
menu to select that menu (ie. the path to the menu). Menu number 30 is used for the 
default menu at level three. 

The menu file contains all of the menu text and also determines the structure of the menu 
tree. It can be edited to add, delete and change options without any changes being made 
to the program. The current limitations are as follows: 

a) Option 5 in the root menu always displays file 500 directly. 

b) Menu 30 always comes up at level three and extra levels are not allowed for. 

The menu file is listed in Appendix 1.

3. DATA RETRIEVAL SOFTWARE 

The program performs the functions in the following order: 

a) Reads in all the noenus. 

b) Writes the appropriate menus to screen 

c) Reads in the user responses 

d) Constmcts a file name from these response^ and displays that file on the screen. 

It was decided that the error checking of user responses would be simpit/ if they were 
limited to single keystroke entries. Consequently, the user input options were limiied to 
digits from 1 to 9. Three single digit option choices are read in and assembled to make a 
three character file name. For this particular program a file name extension was 
considered unnecessary for the data files. 


4. PROGRAM LISTINGS 

The first listing provided (Appendix 2) contains the current version of the program. This 
reveals the small size and the simplicity of the program. 

As part of documenting this work an extensively commented version of the program was 
also produced. (See Appendix 3.) Some variables have been renamed but otherwise the 
two listings are identical. 


5. DATA LISTINGS 

A listing of the relevant data files is provided in Appendix 4. The main sources of 
information for these data files were the Aerospace Structural Metals Handbook [1], and 
the materials manufacturers data sheets. It is believed there is scop)e to improve the 
quality of the information. 


6. CONCLUSION 

A menu driven materials data base, for the purpose of a quick reference to the 
engineering-related properties of aircraft structural materials has bron developed. General 
materials information, and suppliers details, are also provided. Data retrieval is performed 
by a TURBO PASCAL program of less than 1(X) lines accessing several separate text 
files. This simple application will run under most MSDOS installations.

ALUMINIUM 7075 - GENERAL INFORMATION 

THIS ALLOY COMBINES HIGH STRENGTH AND HIGH CORROSION RESISTANCE BUT IS 
SUBJECT TO REDUCED PERFORMANCE AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES. CORROSION RESISTANCE 
IS INCREASED FURTHER BY CLADDING WITH A LOW ZINC ALLOY 7072. CLAD 7075 HAS 
CORROSION RESISTANCE PROPERTIES AS GOOD AS PURE ALUMINIUM, HAS 95% OF THE 
STRENGTH OF BARE 7075 AND BETTER FORMABILITY. THIS ALLOY CAN BE RESISTANCE 
WELDED BUT FUSION WELDING IS NOT GENERALLY RECOMMENDED.

4340 ULTRA HIGH STRENGTH STEEL - GENERAL INFORMATION 

4340, INCLUDING ITS VARIETY 4337 WHICH HAS A SLIGHTLY LOWER CARBON CONTENT, 

IS THE PREFERRED COMMON LOW ALLOY STEEL FOR AIR WEAPONS WHERE GOOD STRENGTH, 
HIGH HARDENABILITY AND UNIFORMITY ARE DESIRED. IT CAN BE HEAT TREATED TO 
STRENGTH VALUES WITHIN A WIDE RANGE. AT STRENGTH LEVELS UP TO ABOUT 200 KSI, 
OTHER LOW ALLOY STEELS WITH SUFFICIENT HARDENABILITY POSSSS NEARLY THE SAME 
MECHANICAL AND OTHER PROPERTIES AS 4340. AT 200 - 220 KSI AND 260 - 280 KSI 
THIS STEEL HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE SUPERIOR TO OTHER COMMON LOW ALLOY STEELS, 
AND ALSO TO SOME OF THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED MORE COMPLEX LOW ALLOY ULTRA HIGH 
STRENGTH STEELS. 4340 IS AVAILABLE IN ALL WROUGHT FORMS AND CASTINGS. IT 
POSSESSES A FAIR FORMABILITY WHEN PROPERLY ANNEALED AND CAN BE WELDED BY 
VARIOUS METHODS. FORGINGS IN THIS ALLOY HEAT TREATED TO 260 - 280 KSI REQUIRE

16. ABSTRACT 

This Memorandum presents a PC based, menu driven materials data base for the engineering related 
properties of advanced structural materials. General materials irformation and suppliers' details are also 
provided. Data retrieval is performed by a TURBO PASCAL program of less than 100 lines, accessing 
several separate text files. This program will run under most MSDOS installations. Response time and 
accessing time is negligible on any IBM XT (or faster) machine and a graphics adaptor is not required.
