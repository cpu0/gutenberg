UWB Tracking Software Development 
Abstract 


An Ultra-Wideband (UWB) two-cluster Angle of Arrival (AOA) tracking prototype system is 
currently being developed and tested at NASA Johnson Space Center for space exploration applications. 
This talk discusses the software development efforts for this UWB two-cluster AOA tracking system. 
The role the software plays in this system is to take waveform data from two UWB radio receivers as an 
input, feed this input into an AOA tracking algorithm, and generate the target position as an output. The 
architecture of the software (Input/Output Interface and Algorithm Core) will be introduced in this talk. 
The development of this software has three phases. In Phase I, the software is mostly Matlab driven and 
calls C++ socket functions to provide the communication links to the radios. This is beneficial in the early 
stage when it is necessary to frequently test changes in the algorithm. Phase II of the development is to 
have the software mostly C++ driven and call a Matlab function for the AOA tracking algorithm. This is 
beneficial in order to send the tracking results to other systems and also to improve the tracking update 
rate of the system. The third phase is part of future work and is to have the software completely C++ 
driven with a graphics user interface. This software design enables the fine resolution tracking of the 
UWB two-cluster AOA tracking system.
