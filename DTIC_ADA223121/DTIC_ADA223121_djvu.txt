CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 


This Validation Summary Report ^fVSR) describes the extent to which a 
specific Ada compiler conforms to the Ada Standard, ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A. 
This report explains all technical terms used within it and thoroughly 
reports the results of testing this compiler using the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability,*^ (AWC^^Sl^An Ada compiler must be implemented 
according to the Ada Standard, and any implementation-dependent features 
must conform to the requirements of the Ada Standard. The Ada Standard 
must be implemented in its entirety, and nothing can be implemented that is 
not in the Standard. \ 


Even though all validated Ada compilers conform to the Ada Standard, it 
must be understood that some differences do exist between implementations. 
The Ada Standard permits some implementation dependencies—for example, the 
maximum length of identifiers or the maximum values of integer types. 
Other differences between compilers result from the characteristics of 
particular operating systems, hardware, or implementation strategies. All 
the dependencies observed during the process of testing this compiler are 


given in this report. 


The information in this report is derived from the test results produc 
during validation testing. The validation process includes submitting a 
suite of standardized tests, the ACVC, as inputs to an Ada compiler and 


evaluating the results.NThe purpose of validating is to ensure conformity 
of the compiler to the Aaa Standard by testing that the compiler properly 
implements legal language constructs and that it identifies and rejects 
illegal language constructs. The testing also identifies behavior that is 
implementation-dependent but is permitted by the Ada Standard. Six classes 
of tests are used. These! tests are designed to perform checks at compile 
time, at link time, and dur^g execution.

INTRODUCTION 


1.1 PURPOSE OF THIS VALIDATION SUMMARY REPORT 

This VSR documents the results of the validation testing performed on an 
Ada compiler. Testing was carried out for the following purposes: 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs supported by the 
compiler that do not conform to the Ada Standard 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs not supported by 
the compiler but required by the Ada Standard 

. To determine that the implementation-dependent behavior is allov;.d 
by the Ada Standard 

Testing of this compiler was conducted by SofTech, Inc. under the 
direction of the AVF according to procedures established by the Ada Joint 
Program Office and administered by the Ada Validation Organization (AVO). 
On-sice testing was completed July 19, 1989 at Laguna Hills CA.

INTRODUCTION 


Failed test An ACVC test for which the compiler generates a result that 
demonstrates nonconformity to the Ada Standard. 

Host The computer on which the compiler resides. 

Inapplicable An ACVC test that uses features of the language that a 
test compiler is not required to support or may legitimately 

support in a way other than the one expected by the test. 

Passed test An ACVC test for which a compiler generates the expected 
result. 

Target The computer for which a compiler generates code. 

Test A program that checks a compiler's conformity regarding a 

particular feature or a combination of features to the Ada 
Standard. In the context of this report, the term is used to 
designate a single test, which may comprise one or more 
files. 

Withdrawn An ACVC test found to be incorrect and not used to check 

test conformity to the Ada Standard. A tost may be incorrect 

because it has an invalid test objective, fails to meet its 
test objective, or contains illegal or erroneous use of the 
language. 

1.5 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conformity to the Ada Standard is measured using the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains both legal and illegal Ada programs structured into six test 
classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies 
the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable, 
and special program units are used to report their results during 
execution. Class B tests are expected to produce compilation errors. 
Class L tests are expected to produce compilation or link errors because of 
the way in which a program library is used at link time. 

Class A tests ensure the successful compilation of legal Ada programs with 
certain language constructs which cannot be verified at compile time. 
There are no explicit program components in a Class A test to check 
semantics. For example, a Class A test checks that reserved words of 
another language (other than those already reserved in the Ada language) 
are not treated as reserved words by an Ada compiler. A Class A test is 
passed if no errors are detected at compile time and the program executes 
to produce a PASSED message. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that every syntax or 
semantic error in the test is detected. A Class B test is passed if every 
illegal construct that it contains is detected by the compiler.

INTRODUCTION 


Class C tests check the run time system to ensure that legal Ada programs 
can he correctly compiled and executed. Each Class C test is self-checking 
and produces a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result when it is executed. 


Class D tests check the compilation and execution capacities of a compiler. 
Since there are no capacity requirements placed on a compiler by the Ada 
Standard for some parameters—for example, the number of identifiers 
permitted in a compilation or the number of units in a library—a compiler 
may refuse to compile a Class D test and still be a conforming compiler. 
Therefore, if a Class D test fails to compile because the capacity of the 
compiler is exceeded, the test is classified as inapplicable. If a Class D 
test compiles successfully, it is self-checking and produces a PASSED or 
FAILED message during execution. 


Class E tests are expected to execute successfully and check 
implementation-dependent options and resolutions of ambiguities in the Ada 
Standard. Each Class E test is self-checking and produces a NOT 
APPLICABLE, PASSED, or FAILED message when it is compiled and executed. 
However, the Ada Standard permits an implementation to reject prografns 
containing some features addressed by Class E tests during compilation. 
Therefore, a Class E test is passed by a compiler if it is compiled 
successfully and executes to produce a PASSED message, or if it is rejected 
by the compiler for an allowable reason. 


Class L tests check that incomplete or illegal Ada programs involving 
multiple, separately compiled units are detected and not allowed to 
execute. Class L tests are compiled separately and execution is attempted. 
A Class L test passes if it is rejected at link time—that is, an attempt 
to execute the main program must generate an error message before any 
declarations in the main program or any units referenced by the main 
program are elaborated. In some cases, an implementation may legitimately 
detect errors during compilation of the test. 

Two library units, the package REPORT and the procedure CHECK_FILE, support 
the self-checking features of the executable tests. The package REPORT 
provides the mechanism by which executable tests report PASSED, FAILED, or 
NOT APPLICABLE results. It also provides a set of identity functions used 
to defeat some compiler optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that 
would circumvent a test objective. The procedure CHECK FILE is used to 
check the contents of text files written by some of the Class C tests for 
chapter 14 of the Ada Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. These tests produce messages that 
are examined to verify that the units are operating correctly. If these 
units are not operating correctly, then the validation is not attempted. 

The text of each test in the ACVC follows conventions that are intended to 
ensure that the tests are reasonably portable without modification. For 
example, the tests make use of only the basic set of 55 characters, contain 
lines with a maximum length of 72 characters, use small numeric values, and 
place features that may not be supported by all implementations in separate 
tests. However, some tests contain values that require the test to be

IM'RODUCTION 


customized according to implementation-specific values—for example, an 
illegal file name. A list of the values used for this validation is 
provided in Appendix C. 

A compiler must correctly process each of the tests in the suite and 
demonstrate conformity to the Ada Standard by either meeting the pass 
criteria given for the test or by showing that the test is inapplicable to 
the implementation. The applicability of a test to an implementation is 
considered each time the implementation is validated. A test that is 
inapplicable for one validation is not necessarily inapplicable for a 
subsequent validation. Any test that was determined to contain an illegal 
language construct or an erroneous language construct is withdrawn from the 
ACVC and, therefore, is not used in testing a compiler. The tests 
withdrawn at the time of this validation are given in Appendix D.

CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


2.2 IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS 

One of the purposes of validating compilers is to determine the behavior of 
a compiler in those areas of the Ada Standard that permit implementations 
to differ. Class D and E tests specifically check for such implementation 
differences. However, tests in other classes also characterize an 
implementation. The tests demonstrate the following characteristics: 


a. Capacities. 


(1) The compiler correctly processes a compilation containing 723 
variables in the same declarative part. (See test D29002K ) 

(2) The compiler correctly processes tests containing loop 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See tests D55A03A..H (8 
tests).) 

(3) The compiler correctly processes tests containi.ng block 
statements ne.sted to 65 levels. (See test D56001E.) 

(4) The compiler correctly processes tests containing recursive 
procedures separately compiled as subunits nested to 17 
levels. (See tests D64005E..G (3 tests).) 


b. Predefined types. 

(1) This implementation supports the additional predefined types 
SHORT_INTEGER and BYTE_INTEGER in package STANDARD. (See 
tests B86001T..Z (7 tests).) 


c. Expression evaluation. 

The order in which expressions are evaluated and the time at which 
constraints are checked are not defined by the language. Vhile 
the ACVC tests do not specifically attempt to determine the order 
of evaluation of expressions, test results indicate the following: 

(1) None of the default initialization expressions for record 
components are evaluated before any value is checked for 
membership in a component's subtype. (See test C32117A.) 

(2) Assignments for subtypes are performed with the same precision 
as the base type. (See test C35712B.) 

(3) This implementation uses no extra bits for extra precision and 
uses all extra bits for extra range. (See test C35903A.) 


2-2 







CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(4) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when an integer literal operand in a 
comparison or membership test is outside the range of the base 
type. (See test C45232A.) 

(5) No exception is raised when a literal operand in a fixed-point 
comparison or membership test is outside the range of the base 
type. (See test C45252A.) 

(6) Underflow is not gradual. (See tests C45524A..Z (26 tests).) 


d. Rounding. 

The method by which values are rounded in type conversions is not 
defined by the language. While the ACVC tests do not specifically 
attempt to determine the method of rounding, the test results 
indicate the following: 

(1) The method used for rounding to integer is round away from 
zero. (See tests C46012A..Z (26 tests).) 

(2) The method used for rounding to longest integer is round away 
from zero. (See tests C46012A..Z (26 tests).) 

(3) The method used for rounding to integer in static universal 
real expressions is round away from zero. (See test C4A014A.) 


e. Array types. 

An implementation is allowed to raise NUMERIC_ERROR or 
CONSTRAINT_ERROR for an array having a 'LENGTH that exceeds 
STANDARD.INTEGER'LAST and/or SYSTEM.MAX INT. 


For this implementation: 


(1) Declaration of an array type or subtype declaration with more 
than SYSTEM.MAX_INT components raises no exception. (See test 
C36003A.) 


(2) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when 
array type with INTEGER'LAST 
C36202A.) 


'LENGTH is applied to a null 
-t- 2 components. (See test 


(3) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when 'LENGTH is applied to a null 
array Type with SYSTEM.MAX_INT * 2 components. (See test 

C36202B.) 


(4) A packed BOOLEAN array having a 'LEN(?rH exceeding INTEGER'LAST 
raises NUMERIC ERROR when the array objects are declared. 
(See test C52103x.) 


2-3 






CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(5) A packed two-dimensional BOOLEAN array with more than 
INTEGER'LAST components raises CONSTRAlNT_ERROR when the array 
objects are declared. (See test C52104y.) 

(6) A null array with one dimension of length greater than 
INTEGER'LAST may raise NUMERIC_ERROR or CONSTRAINT_ERROR 
either when declared or assigned. Alternatively, an 
implementation may accept the declaration. However, lengths 
must match in array slice assignments. This implementation 
raises NUMERIC_ERROR when the array type is declared. (See 
test E52103Y.) 

(7) In assigning one-dimensional array types, the expression is 
evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

(8) In assigning two-dimensional array types, the expression is 
not evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT ERROR is 
raised when checking whether the expression's subtype is 
compatible with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


f. Discriminated types. 

(1) In assigning record types with discriminants, the expression 
is evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT^ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


g. Aggregates. 

(1) In the evaluation of a multi-dimensional aggregate, all 
choices are evaluated before checking against the index type. 
(See tests C43207A and C43207B.) 

(2) In the evaluation of an aggregate containing subaggregates, 
not all choices are evaluated before being checked for 
identical bounds. (See test E43212B.) 

(3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised before all choices are evaluated 
when a bound in a non-null range of a non-null aggregate does 
not belong to an index subtype. (See test E43211B.) 


h. Pragmas. 

(1) The pragma INLINE is not supported for functions or 
procedures. (See tests LA3004A..B (2 tests), EA3004C..D (2 
tests), and CA3004E..F (2 tests).) 


2-4 






CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


i. Generics. 

(1) Generic unit declarations, bodies, and subunits can be 

compiled in separate compilations. (See test CA1012A and 

CA3011A.) 

(2) If a generic unit body or one of its subunits is compiled or 
recompiled after the generic unit is instantiated, the unit 
instantiating the generic is made obsolete. The obsolesence 
is recognized at binding time, and the binding is stopped. 
(See tests CA2009C, CA2009F, BC320AC, and BC3205D.) 


j. Input and output. 

(1) The package SEQUENTIAL_IO cannot be instantiated with 
unconstrained array types or record types with discriminants 
without defaults. (See tests AE2101C, EE2201D, and EE2201E.) 

(2) The package DIRE(rr_IO cannot be instantiated with 
unconstrained array types or record types with discriminants 
without defaults. (See tests AE2101B, EE2401D, and EE2401G.) 

(3) Modes IN FILE and OUT_FILE are supported for SEQUENTIAL 10. 
(See testi CE2102D..E (2 tests), CE2102N, and CE2102P.) 

(/) Modes IN FILE, OUT FILE, and INOUT FILE are supported for 
DIRECT lOT (See tests CE2102F, CE2102I..J (2 tests), CE2102R, 
CE2102T, and CE2102V.) 

(5) Nodes IN FILE and OUT FILE are supported for text files. (See 
tests CE3102E and CE3I02I..K (3 tests).) 

(6) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for SEQUENTIAL_I0. 
(See tests CE2102G and CE2102X.) 

(7) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for DIRECT_I0. (See 
tests CE2102K and CE2102Y.) 

(8) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for text files. 
(See tests CE3102F..G (2 tests), CE3104C, CE3110A, and 
CE3114A.) 

(9) Overwriting to a sequential file does not truncate the file. 
(See test CE2208B.) 

(10) Temporary sequential files are given names and deleted when 
closed. (See test CE2108A.) 

(11) Temporary direct files are given names and deleted when 
closed. (See test CE2108C.) 


2-5 









CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(12) Temporary text files are given names and deleted when closed. 
(See test CE3112A.) 

(13) More than one internal file can be associated with each 

external file for sequential files when reading only. (See 
tests CE2107A..E (5 tests), CE2102L, CE2110B, and CE2111D.) 

(14) More than one internal file can be associated with each 

external file for direct files when reading only. (See tests 
CE2107F..H (3 tests), CE2110D, and CE2111H.) 

(15) More than one internal file can be associated with each 

external file for text files when reading only. (See tests 
CE3111A..E (5 tests), CE3114B, and CE3115A.)

TEST INFORMATION 


3.1 TEST RESULTS 

Version 1.10 of the ACVC comprises 3717 tests. When this compiler vas 
tested, 44 tests had been withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF 
determined that 285 tests were inapplicable to this implementation. All 
inapplicable tests were processed during validation testing except for 201 
executable tests that use floating-point precision exceeding that supported 
by the implementation. Modifications to the code, processing, or grading 
for 4 tests were required to successfully demonstrate the test objective. 
(See section 3.6.) 

The AVF concludes that the testing results demonstrate acceptable 
conformity to the Ada Standard.

3.5 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

Some tests do not apply to all compilers because they make use of features 
that a compiler is not required by the Ada Standard to support. Others may 
depend on the result of another test that is either inapplicable or 
withdrawn. The applicability of a test to an implementation is considered 
each time a validation is attempted. A test that is inapplicable for one 
validation attempt is not necessarily inapplicable for a subsequent 
attempt. For this validation attempt, 285 tests were inapplicable for the 
reasons indicated: 


a. The following 201 tests are not applicable because they have 
floating-point type declarations requiring more digits than 
SYSTEM.MAX DIGITS: 


C24113L..Y (14) 
C35708L..Y (14) 
C45421L..Y (14) 


C35705L..Y (14) 
C35802L..Z (15) 
C45521L..Z (15) 


C35706L..Y (14) 
C45241L..Y (14) 
C45524L..Z (15) 


C35707L..Y (14) 
C45321L..Y (14) 
C45621L..Z (15)

TEST INFORMATION 


C45641L..Y (14) C46012L..Z (15) 

b. C35702A and B86001T are not applicable because this implementation 
supports no predefined type SHORT_FLOAT. 

c. C35702B and B86001U are not applicable because this implementation 
supports no predefined type L0NG_FL0AT. 

d. The following 16 tests are not applicable because this 
implementation does not support a predefined type LONG_INTEGER: 

C45231C C45304C C45502C C45503C C45504C 

C45504F C45611C C45613C C45614C C45631C

because the value of SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA is less than 48. 

f. C86001F is not applicable because, for this implementation, the 
package TEXT_IO is dependent upon package SYSTEM. This test 
recompiles package SYSTEM, making package TEXT_IO, and hence 
package REPORT, obsolete. 

g. B86001Y is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined fixed-point type other than DURATION. 

h. B86001Z is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined floating-point type with a name other than FLOAT, 
LONG_FLOAT, or SHORT_FLOAT. 

i. CA2009C, CA2009F, BC3204C and BC3203D are not applicable because 

this implementation does not support separate compilation of 
generic specifications, bodies, or subunits, if an instantiation 
is given before compilation of its bodies or subunits. The 
created dependency is detected at bind time. 

j. LA3004A, LA3004B, EA3004C, EA3004D, CA3004E, and CA3004F are not 

applicable because this implementation does not support pragma 
INLINE. 

k. AE2101C, EE2201D, and EE2201E use instantiations of package 

SEQUENTIAL_IO with unconstrained array types and record types with 
discriminants without defaults. These instantiations are rejected 
by this compiler. 

l. AE2101H, EE2401D, and EE2401G use instantiations of package 

DIRECT_IO with unconstrained array types and record types with 
discriminants without defaults. These instantiations are rejected 
by this compiler. 

m. CE2102D is inapplicable because this implementation supports 
CREATE with IN_FILE mode for SEQUENTIALIO.

with IN_FILE mode for text files. 

ag. CE3102K is inapplicable because this implementation supports OPEN 
with 0UT_FILE mode for text files. 

ah. CE2107B..E (4 tests), CE2107L, and CE2110B are not applicable 

because multiple internal files cannot be associated with the same 
external file when one or more files is writing for sequential 
files. The proper exception is raised when multiple access is 
attempted. 

ai. CE2111D is not applicable because the resetting of an external 
file from IN_FILE to OUT_FILE is not supported. 

aj. CE2107G..H (2 tests), CE2110D, and CE2111H are not applicable 

because multiple internal files cannot be associated with the same 
external file when one or more files is writing for direct files. 
The proper exception is raised when multiple access is attempted. 

ak. CE3111B, CE3111D..E (2 tests), CE3114B, and CE3115A are not 

applicable because multiple internal files cannot be associated 
with the same external file when one or more files is writing for 
text files. The proper exception is raised when multiple access 
is attempted. 


3.6 TEST, PROCESSING, AND EVALUATION MODIFICATIONS 

It is expected that some tests will require modifications of code, 
processing, or evaluation in order to compensate for legitimate 
implementation behavior. Modifications are made by the AVF in cases where 
legitimate implementation behavior prevents the successful completion of an 
(otherwise) applicable test. Examples of such modifications include: 
adding a length clause to alter the default size of a collection; splitting 
a Class B test into subtests so that all errors are detected; and 
confirming that messages produced by an executable test demonstrate 
conforming behavior that wasn't anticipated by the test (such as raising 
one exception instead of another). 

Modifications were required for 4 tests. 


The following tests were split because syntax errors at one point resulted 
in the compiler not detecting other errors in the test:

3.7 ADDITIONAL TESTING INFORMATION 


3.7.1 Prevalidation 

Prior to validation, a set of test results for ACVC Version 1.10 produced 
by the AdaVantage, Version 3.0 compiler, was submitted to the AVF by the 
applicant for review. Analysis of these results demonstrated that the 
compiler successfully passed all applicable tests, and the compiler 
exhibited the expected behavior on all inapplicable tests. 


3.7.2 Test Method 


Testing of the AdaVantage, Version 3.0 compiler, using ACVC Version 1.10 
was conducted on-site by a validation team from the AVF. The configuration 
in which the testing was performed is described by the following 
designations of hardware and software components: 


Host computer: 

Host operating system: 
Target computer: 

Target operating system; 
Compiler: 


Ardent Titan P2 
Ardent/Unix, 2.1 
Ardent Titan P2 
Ardent/Unix, 2.1 
AdaVantage, Version 3.0 


A magnetic tape containing all tests except for withdrawn tests and tests 
requiring unsupported floating-point precisions was taken on-site by the 
validation team for processing. Tests that make use of 
implementation-specific values were customized before being written to the 
magnetic tape. Tests requiring modifications during the prevalidation 
testing were included in their modified form on the magnetic tape. 


The contents of the magnetic tape were not loaded directly onto the host 
computer. 


The tests were loaded onto a Sun system and then accessed by the Ardent 
system via an NFS network. 


After the test files were loaded to disk, the full set of tests was 
compiled, linked, and all executable tests were run on the Ardent Titan P2. 
Results were printed from the host computer. 

The compiler was tested using command scripts provided by Meridian Software 
Systems, Inc. and reviewed by the validation team. The compiler was 
tested using all default option settings except for the following:

Tests were compiled, linked, and executed (as appropriate) using a single 
computer. Test output, compilation listings, and job logs were captured on 
magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site by 
the validation team were also archived. 


3.7.3 Test Site 

Testing was conducted at Laguna Hills CA and was completed on July 19, 
1989.

APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


Appendix F 

Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


This appendix lists implementation-dependent characteristics of Meridian 
AdaVantage. Note that there are no preceding appendices. This appendix 
is called "Appendix F" because of a very clearly stated requirement by 
ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A that this appendix be so named. 

Implemented Chapter 13 features include length clauses, enumeration repre¬ 
sentation clauses, record representation clauses, address clauses, interrupts, 
package SYSTEM, machine code insertions, pragma interface, and unchecked 
programming. 


F.l Pragmas 


The implemented pre-defined pragmas are: 


elaborate 

interface 

list 

pack 

page 

priority 

suppress 


Implemented as per ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A section 10.5. 
See section F.1.1. 

Implemented as per ANSI/HIL-STD-1815A Appendix B. 
See section F.l.2. 

Implemented as per ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A Appendix B. 
Implemented as per ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A Appendix B. 
See section F.l.3. 


The remaining pre-defined pragmas are accepted, but presently ignored: 


controlled 

inline 

memory_size 


optimize system_name 

shared 

storage unit 


B-3 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


Named parameter notation for pragmas is not supported. 

When illegal parameter forms are encountered at compile time, the com¬ 
piler issues a warning message rather than an error, as required by the Ada 
language definition. 

Refer to ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A Appendix B for additional information about 
the pre-defined pragmas. 


F.1.1 Pragma Interface 


The form of pragma interface in Meridian AdaVantage is: 
pragma interface( language, subprogram [, "link-name"] ); 
where: 


language 


subprogram 


link-name 


is the interface language, one of the names assem¬ 
bly, c, builtin, or internal. The names builtin and 
internal are reserved for use by Meridian compiler 
maintainers in run-time support packages. 

is the name of a subprogram to which the pragma 
interface applies. If link-name is omitted, then the 
Ada subprogram name is also used as the object code 
symbol name. Depending on the language specified, 
some automatic modifications may be made to the 
object code symbol name. 

is an optional string literal specifying the name of the 
non-Ada subprogram corresponding to the Ada sub¬ 
program named in the second parameter. The link- 
name is used as the object code symbol. Depending 
on the language specified, some automatic modifica¬ 
tions may be made to the object code symbol name. 

It is appropriate to use the optional link-name param¬ 
eter to pragma interface when the interface subpro¬ 
gram has a name that does not correspond at all to its 
Ada identifier or when the interface subprogram name 
cannot be given using rules for constructing Ada iden¬ 
tifiers (e.g., if the name contains a '$' character). 


B-4 







APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


The characteristics of object code symbols emitted for each interface language 
are: 


assembly 


builtin 


c 


internal 


The object code symbol is the same as the subprogram 
name. If no link-name string is specified, then the sub¬ 
program name is translated to lover case. 

The object code symbol is the same as the subpro¬ 
gram name, but with two underscore characters ("_") 

prepended, whether or not a link-name string is speci¬ 
fied. If no link-name string is specified, then the sub¬ 
program name is translated to lover case. This lan¬ 
guage interface is reserved for special interfaces defined 
by Meridian Softvare Systems, Inc. The builtin inter¬ 
face is presently used to declare certain low-level run¬ 
time operations whose names must not conflict with 
programmer-defined or system-defined names. 

The object code symbol is the same as the subpro¬ 
gram name, but with one underscore character 
prepended, whether or not a link-name string is speci¬ 
fied. If no link-name string is specified, then the sub¬ 
program name is translated to lover case. This is the 
convention used by Ardent C compilers. 

No object code symbol is emitted for an internal lan¬ 
guage interface; this language interface is reserved for 
special interfaces defined by Meridian Software Systems, 
Inc. The internal interface is presently used to declare 
certain machine-level bit operations. 


In no case are the low-level calling conventions changed; no automatic data 
conversions are performed on parameters of interface subprograms. It is up 
to the programmer to ensure that calling conventions match and that any 
necessary data conversions take place when calling interface subprograms. 

A pragma interface may appear within the same declarative part as the 
subprogram to which the pragma interface applies, following the subpro¬ 
gram declaration, and prior to the first use of the subprogram. A pragma 
interface that applies to a subprogram declared in a package specification 
must occur within the same package specification as the subprogram decla¬ 
ration; the pragma interface may not appear in the package body in this 
case. A pragma interface declaration for either a private or non-private 
subprogram declaration may appear in the private part of a package speci¬ 
fication. 

Pragma interface for library units is not supported. 

Refer to ANSI/HIL-STD-1815A section 13.9 for additional information about 
pragma interface. 


B-5 






APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


F.1.2 Pragma Pack 


Pragma pack is implemented for composite types (records and arrays). 

Pragma pack is permitted following the composite type declaration to which 
it applies, provided that the pragma occurs within the same declarative part 
as the composite type declaration, before any objects or components of the 
composite type are declared. 

Note that the declarative part restriction means that the type declaration and 
accompanying pragma pack cannot be split across a package specification and 
body. 

The effect of pragma pack is to minimize storage consumption by discrete 
component types whose ranges permit packing. Use of pragma pack does not 
defeat allocations of alignment storage gaps for some record types. Pragma 
pack does not affect the representations of real types, pre-defined integer 
types, and access types. 


F.1.3 Pragma Suppress 


Pragma suppress is implemented as described in ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A 
section 11.7, with these differences: 

- Presently, division_check and overflow_check must be suppressed 
via a compiler flag, -fN ; pragma suppress is ignored for these two 
numeric checks. 

- The optional "ON >>" parameter name notation for pragma suppress 
is ignored. 

- The optional second parameter to pragma suppress is ignored; the 
pragma always applies to the entire scope in which it appears. 


B-6 







APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


F.2 Attributes 


There are presently no implementation-dependent attributes in Meridian 
AdaVantage. All attributes described in ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A Appendix 
A are implemented. 


F.3 Standard Types 

Two additional standard types are defined in AdaVantage: 

1. SHORT_TNTEGER, defined with less precision than type INTEGER. 

2. ByTE_INTEGER, defined with less precision than type SHORT_INTEGER; 

The standard numeric types are defined as: 
type BYTE_INTEGER is range -128..127; 
type SHORT_INTEGER is range -32768 .. 32767; 
type INTEGER is range -2147483648 .. 2147483647; 
type FLOAT is digits 15 

range -1.79769313486231E+308 .. 1.79769313486231E+308; 

type DURATION is delta 0.0001 

range -86400.0000 .. 86400.0000; 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


F.4 Package SYSTEM 

The specification of package SYSTEM for Ardent Unix is: 


package SYSTEM is 

type ADDRESS is new INTEGER; 
type NAME is (ardent); 

SYSTEM_NAME : constant NAME := ardent; 

STORAGE_UNIT : constant :* 8; 
MEMORY_SIZE : constant := 1024;

2.0 ** (-31); 

1 . 0 ; 


— Other System-Dependent Declarations 
subtype PRIORITY is INTEGER range 1 .. 20; 
end SYSTEM; 

The value of SYSTEM.MEMORY SIZE is presently meaningless. 


F.5 Restrictions on Representation Clauses 


F.5.1 Length Clauses 


A size specification (T'SIZE) is rejected if fever bits are specified than can 

accommodate the type. The minimum size of a composite type may be 

subject to application of pragma pack. It is permitted to specify precise sizes 

for unsigned integer ranges, e.g., 8 for the range 0..255. However, because 

of requirements imposed by the Ada language definition, a full 32-bit range 

of unsigned values, i.e., 0..(2**32)-l, cannot be defined, even using a size 

specification. 

The specification of collection size (T'ST0RAGE_SIZE) is evaluated at run¬ 
time when the scope of the type to which the length clause applies is entered, 
and is therefore subject to rejection (via STORAGE^ERROR) based on available 
storage at the time the allocation is made. A collection may include storage 


B-8 




APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


used for run-time administration of the collection, and therefore should not 
be expected to accommodate a specific number of objects. Furthermore, cer¬ 
tain classes of objects such as unconstrained discriminant array components 
of records may be allocated outside a given collection, so a collection may 
accommodate more objects than might be expected. 

The specification of storage for a task activation (T'STORAGE_SIZE) is evalu¬ 
ated at run-time when a task to which the length clause applies is activated, 
and is therefore subject to rejection (via STORAGE_ERROR) based on available 
storage at the time the allocation is made. Storage reserved for a task ac¬ 
tivation is separate from storage needed for any collections defined within a 
task body. 

The specification of small for a fixed point type (T'SMALL) is subject only 
to restrictions defined in ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A section 13.2. 


F.5.2 Enumeration Representation Clauses 


The internal code for the literal of an enumeration type named in an enu¬ 
meration representation clause must be in the range of STANDARD.INTEGER. 

The value of an internal code may be obtained by applying an appropriate 
instantiation of UNCHECKED CONVERSION to an integer type. 


F.5.3 Record Representation Clauses 


The storage unit offset (the at static_simple_expression part) is given in terms 
of 8-bit storage units and must be even. 

A bit position (the range part) applied to a discrete type component may 
be in the range 0..15, with 0 being the least significant bit of a component. 

A range specification may not specify a size smaller than can accommodate 
the component. A range specification for a component not accommodating 
bit packing may have a higher upper bound as appropriate (e.g., 0..31 for 
a discriminant string component); the lower bound for such a type must

be zero. Refer to the internal data representation of a given component in 
determining the component size and assigning offsets. 

Components of discrete types for which bit positions are specified may not 
straddle 16-bit word boundaries. 

The value of an alignment clause (the optional at mod part) must evaluate 
t(. !, 2, 4, or 8, and may not be smaller than the highest alignment required 
by any component of the record. 


F.5.4 Address Clauses 


An address clause may be supplied for an object (whether constant or vari¬ 
able) or a task entry, but not for a subprogram, package, or task unit. The 
meaning of an address clause supplied for a task entry is given in section 
F.5.5 

An address expression for an object is a 32-bit linear memory address of type 
SYSTEM.ADDRESS. 


F.5.5 Interrupts 


A task entry's address clause can be used to associate the entry with a Ardent 
Unix signal. Values in the range 1 to 31 are meaningful, and represent the 
signals corresponding to those values. Value 0 may be specified, but no signal 
corresponds to value 0, and such an entry is never called via the Ardent Unix 
signal mechanism. 

An interrupt entry may not have any parameters.

APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


F.5.6 Change of Representation 


A change of representation effected by means of type conversion between 
objects of two types, one type derived from a parent type for which a repre¬ 
sentation clause has been supplied (as described in ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A 
section 13.6), is not permitted. 


F.6 Implementation-Dependent Components 


No names are generated by the Implementation to denote implementation- 
dependent components. 


F.7 Unchecked Conversions 


There are no restrictions on the use of UNCHECKED__CONVERSION. Conversions 
between objects whose sizes do not conform may result in storage areas with 
undefined values. 


F.8 Input-Output Packages 


A summary of the implementation-dependent input-output characteristics is: 


- In calls to OPEN and CREATE, the FORM parameter must be the empty 
string (the default value). 

- More than one internal file can be associated with a single external file 
for reading only. For writing, only one internal file may be associated 
with an external file; RESET may not be used to get around this rule. 

- Temporary sequential and direct files are given names. Temporary files 
are deleted when they are closed. 


B-11 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


- File I/O is buffered; text files associated with terminal devices are line- 
buffered. 

- The packages SEQUENTIAL_IO and DIRECT_IO cannot be instantiated 

with unconstrained composite types or record types with discriminants 
without defaults. 


F.9 Source Line and Identifier Lengths 


Source lines and identifiers in Ada source programs are presently limited to 
200 characters in length. 







APPENDIX C 


TEST PARAMETERS 


Certain tests in the ACVC make use of implementation-dependent values, such 
as the maximum length of an input line and invalid file names. A test that 
makes use of such values is identified by the extension .TST in its file 
name. Actual values to be substituted are represented by names that begin 
with a dollar sign. A value must be substituted for each of these names 
before the test is run. The values used for this validation are given 
below.

APPENDIX D 
WITHDRAWN TESTS 


Some tests are withdrawn from the ACVC because they do not conform to the 
Ada Standard. The following 44 tests had been withdrawn at the time of 
validation testing for the reasons indicated. A reference of the form 
Al-ddddd is to an Ada Commentary. 


a. E28005C: This test expects that the string "— TOP OF PAGE. —63" of 
line 204 will appear at the top of the listing page due to a pragma 
PAGE in line 203; but line 203 contains text that follows the pragma, 
and it is this text that must appear at the top of the page. 

b. A39005G: This test unreasonably expects a component clause to pack an 
array component into a minimum size (line 30). 

c. B97102E: This test contains an unintended illegality: a select 
statement contains a null statement at the place of a selective wait 
alternative (line 31). 

d. C97116A: This test contains race conditions, and it assumes that 

guards are evaluated indivisibly. A conforming implementation may use 
interleaved execution in such a way that the evaluation of the guards 
at lines 50 & 54 and the execution of task CHANGING 0F_THE_GUAR0 

results in a call to REPORT.FAILED at one of lines 52 or 56.~ ~ 

e. BC3009B: This test wrongly expects that circular instantiations will 
be detected in several compilation units even though none of the units 
is illegal with respect to the units it depends on; by AI-002S6, the 
illegality need not be detected until execution is attempted (line 
95). 

f. CD2A62D: This test wrongly requires that an array object's size be no 
greater than 10 although its subtype's size was specified to be 40 
(line 137). 

g. CD2A63A..D, CD2A66A..D, CD2A73A..D, and CD2A76A..D (16 tests): These 


D-1 





■ t > » 


WITHDRAWN TESTS 


tests wrongly attempt to check the size of objects of a derived type 
(for which a 'SIZE length clause is given) by passing them to a 
derived subprogram (which implicitly converts them to the parent type 
(Ada standard 3.4:14)). Additionally, they use the 'SIZE length 
clause and attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic 
by the WG9 ARG. 

h. CD2A81G, CD2A83G, CD2A84M..N, and CD50110 (5 tests): These tests 

assume that dependent tasks will terminate while the main program 
executes a loop that simply tests for task termination: this is not 
the case, and the main program may loop indefinitely (lines 74, 85, 
86, 96, and 58, respectively). 

i. CD2B15C and CD7205C: These tests expect that a 'ST0RAGE_3IZE length 
clause provides precise control over the number of designated objects 
in a collection; the Ada standard 13.2:15 allows that such control 
must not be expected. 

j. CD2D11B: This test gives a SMALL representation clause for a derived 
fixed-point type (at line 30) that defines a set of model numbers that 
are not necessarily represented in the parent type; by Commentary 
AI-00099, all model numbers of a derived fixed-point type must be 
representable values of the parent type. 

k. C05007B: This test wrongly expects an implicitly declared subprogram 
to be at the address that is specified for an unrelated subprogram 
(line 303). 

l. E07004B, ED7005C..0, and ED7006C..D (5 tests): These tests check 
various aspects of the use of the three SYSTEM pragmas; the AVO 
withdraws these tests as being inappropriate for validation. 

m. CD7105A: This test requires that successive calls to CALENDAR.CL0(X 
change by at least SYSTEM.TICK; however, by Commentary AI-00201, it is 
only the expected frequency of change that must be at least 
SYSTEM.TIC3C—particular instances of change may be less (line 29). 

n. CD7203B and CD7204B: These tests use the 'SIZE length clause and 
attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic by the WG9 
ARG. 

0 . CD7205D: This test checks an invalid test objective: it treats the 
specification of storage to be reserved for a task's activation as 
though it were like the specification of storage for a collection. 

p. CE2107I: This test requires that objects of two similar scalar types 
be distinguished when read from a file—DATA^ERROR is expected to be 
raised by an attempt to read one object" as of the other type. 
However, it is not clear exactly how the Ada standard 14.2.4:4 is to 
be interpreted; thus, this test objective is not considered valid 
(line 90). 


D-2 




WITHDRAWN TESTS 


q. CE3111C: This test requires certain behavior, when two files are 
associated with the same external file, that is not required by the 
Ada standard. 

r. CE3301A; This test contains several calls to END_OF_LINE and 

END OF PAGE that have no parameter: these calls were intended to 
specify a file, not to refer to STANDARD_INPirr (lines 103, 107, 118, 
132, and 136). 

s. CE3411B: This test requires that a text file's column number be set to 
COUNT'LAST in order to check that LAY0UT_ERR0R is raised by a 
subsequent PUT operatijn. But the former operation will generally 
raise an exception due to a lack of available disk space, and the test 
would thus encumber validation testing.
