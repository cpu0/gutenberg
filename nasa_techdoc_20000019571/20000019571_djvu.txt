Abstract 

In this paper, we have identified three principal modes of summertime rainfall 
variability over China and global sea surface temperature (SST) for the period 1955- 
1998. Using these modes, we have assessed the impact of the El Nino/La Nina on major 
drought and flood occurrence over China during 1997-1998. The first mode can be 
identified with the growth phase of El Nino superimposed on a linear warming trend 
since the mid-1950s. This mode strongly influences rainfall over northern China. The 
second mode comprises of a quasi-biennial tendency manifested in alternate wet and dry 
years over the Yangtze River Valley (YRV) of central China. The third mode is 
dominated by a quasi-decadal oscillation in eastern China between the Yangtze River and 
the Yellow River. 

Using a mode-by-mode reconstruction, we evaluate the impacts of the various 
principal modes on the 1997 and 1998 observed rainfall anomaly. We find that the severe 
drought in northern China, and to a lesser degree the flood in southern China, in 1 997 is 
likely a result of the influence of anomalous SST forcing during the growth phase of the 
El Nino. In addition, rainfall in southern China may be influenced by the decadal or 
long-term SST variability. The severe flood over the Yangtze River Valley in 1998 is 
associated with the biennial tendency of basin scale SST during the transition from El 
Nino to La Nina in 1997-98. Additionally, the observed prolonged drought over northern 
China and increasing flooding over the YRV since the 1 950s may be associated with a 
long-term warming trend in the tropical Indian and western Pacific ocean. During 1997, 
the El Nino SST exacerbated the drought situation over northern China. In 1998, the 
drought appeared to get temporary relief from the La Nina anomalous SST forcing. 



1. Introduction 

One of the most important natural disasters affecting East Asia is the occurrence of 
severe flood and/or drought during the summer monsoon season from June through 
August. During the summer of 1997, southern China (south of the Yangtze River) 
experienced severe flood, while northern China was gripped by one of the driest season 
on record. In the summer of 1998, rainfall over some regions of the Yangtze River 
Valley (YRV) and northeast China almost doubled their normal amounts, causing the 
most widespread and devastating flood of the century in the country. The flood over the 
YRV afflicted over 240 million people (about the size of the population of the entire 
United States), damaged more than 30 millions acres of farmland, and ruined over 1 1 
million acres of crops. In all, the flooding over the YRV and northeast China caused over 
3700 human lives and inflicted huge economic loss totaling over 12 billion US dollars 
(National Climate Center 1998). 

Thanks to the worldwide attention on the 1997-98 El Nino/La Nina, it is easy to 
blame the occurrence of the aforementioned disasters on El Nino/La Nina. An important 
question, which has both scientific and economic implications, is how much of the 
disaster can be attributed to El Nino? A related fundamental question is how the effect of 
El Nino on regional climate variability can be quantified? In a recent study, Lau and Wu 
(1999) estimated that over the Asian- Australia region as a whole, not more than 50% of 
rainfall variability can be explained by SST processes. They also pointed out that for 
regional domains, the estimate could vary substantially. Indeed, numerous past studies 
have showed that there are no consistent relationship between El Nino and rainfall over 
China as a whole (Ropelewski and Halpert 1988). As a result, schematic rainfall map in 
the NOAA NCEP homepage on El Nino impacts depicts a large void in the region of East 
Asia, in contrast to a distinctive negative anomaly center over the India subcontinent 
( http : //iri . ucsd . edu/hot-nino/impacts/indi a) . 

A number of recent studies have pointed out the need to subdivide the rainfall 
variability over China according to its natural regimes and/or fundamental time scales. 
For example, Wang and Zhao (1978), Huang and Dai (1984), Miao and Lau (1990) and 



Shen and Lau (1995) identified a pronounced quasi-biennial (QB) signal in rainfall 
variability over a broad region in the vicinity of the YRV and sea surface temperature 
(SST) variability in the Indo-Pacific basin. The QB signal was also found to modulated 
by longer timescales, i.e., decadal-interdecadal, variation (Nitta and Hu 1996; Chang et 
al. 1999). Wang and Shi (1992) found different impacts of two kinds of ENSO (El Nino- 
Southern Oscillation) events on the summer rainfall in China, depending on whether the 
event first appeared in spring or fall. They also indicated that not all severe droughts or 
floods over China were associated with El Nino/La Nina events. Ni et al. (1997) studied 
the correlation between Nino-3 index and a reconstructed rainfall field based on the first 
four EOF (empirical orthogonal function) modes. They found that only about 30% of 
rainfall anomaly, especially that in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River and 
southern China, was related to ENSO. More recently, Weng et al (1999, hereafter referred 
to WLX) identified dominant modes of rainfall patterns that were related to global SST. 
They showed that the rainfall variability of the YRV is correlated with a dipole SST 
anomaly in the western subtropical Pacific and that regional summer rainfall variability 
over China was the result of interplay of various interannual to interdecadal modes. In 
this paper, we expand on the analysis of WLX, with an emphasis on using coherent 
modes of rainfall and SST to assess the possible influence of global SST variability on 
the flood and drought occurrences over China in 1997-98. 

Section 2 briefly describes the data and the methodology used. Section 3 reviews 
historical rainfall distribution and observed rainfall and SST anomalies during 1997 and 
1998 summers. Section 4 describes the dominant modes of co-variability between China 
rainfall and global SST, including a discussion of the physical interpretation of the 
dominant modes, as well as the dominant timescales contained in these dominant modes. 
Section 5 unravels the 1997-98 rainfall and SST anomalies based on a mode-by-mode 
synthesis of the rainfall anomalies. Section 6 presents the main conclusions of the paper. 

2. Data and analysis methodology 

The China rainfall used in this work is based on a 1 60-station monthly rainfall total 
for the period 1951-98, courtesy of Prof. S.-W. Wang, Beijing University, China. The 



stations have been chosen to maximize spatial uniform data coverage and continuity (see 
Fig. la). Note that the stations are relatively uniform with good coverage over the 
eastern portion of the continent, and to a lesser degree over the northeastern portion. 
Over the desert and semi-arid regions of northwestern China, where the JJA rainfall total 
is less than 50mm (Fig. lb), the spatial coverage is quite poor, especially the 
southwestern region. The spatial variability is therefore highly uncertain over these 
regions. Our analysis, however, will be more weighted towards the heavy precipitation 
region of southern and eastern China, where the JJA rainfall total may exceed 500mm 
(Fig. lb). The SST data covers the period of 1955-98, with monthly and 10°xl0° lon-lat 
resolution, provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, 
Barneston 1994). The anomalies are defined as deviations from climatologies over the 
above periods. As in WLX, we used Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify 
dominant modes of rainfall-SST covariability (Bretherton et al. 1992; Wallace et al. 
1992). For time scale analysis, we used the Morlet wavelet transform as described in 
Weng and Lau (1994) and Lau and Weng (1995). 

3. Preliminary observations 

a) Historical rainfall distribution 

The complex nature of the rainfall variability over China in relationship to El Nino 
is demonstrated in Fig. 2. Here, the distribution of summer rainfall anomalies according 
to the entire data record (shaded) and according to warm (solid) and cold (dotted) events 
in the eastern Pacific Ocean are shown for different regions in China. We choose the 
warm and cold summers similar to those used by Tomita and Yasunari (1993) and 
Trenberth (1997). The warm events comprise of 12 summers, which are 1953, 57, 65, 69, 
72, 77, 82, 83, 86, 87, 92 and 97. We choose the same amount of cold summers, i.e., 
1954, 56, 64, 71, 73, 76, 84, 88, 90, 94, 96 and 98. Some "warm" or "cold" summers 
were chosen in a year when an El Nino or a La Nina event was just ended (based on 
Nino3-SST anomaly) in that spring, but its impacts on global and regional climate might 
still in effect in the following summer. According to our criteria, 1976 and 1996 were 
counted as cold events while 1977 as warm event. The domain chosen for each regions 



are a) all-China, which includes all the 160 stations, b) YRV: 29°-32°N, 105°-122°E, 21 
stations, c) southern China: 22°-25°N, 105°-117°E, 11 stations, and d) northern China: 
36°-41°N, 105°-12°E, 23 stations. The reasons for the choice of the above domains will 
become obvious subsequently, when the SVD rainfall modes are discussed. 

For all-China rainfall (Fig. 2a), the long-term mean distribution is nearly Gaussian, 
with zero mean. When stratified into warm and cold events, the rainfall distributions 
suggest a separation between the warm and cold events favoring overall rainfall reduction 
for the former and increase for the latter. However, it may also be argued that neither 
distribution is well separated from the mean distribution. Hence there is only a marginal 
signal, at best, for all-China rainfall with respect to warm and cold events. Interestingly, 
the rainfall anomaly over YRV and South China (Figs. 2b and 2c) shows a much wider 
spread, with almost a white-noise distribution. For these regions, the distributions for the 
warm and cold events do not yield a clear separation. This suggests that there may be an 
intrinsic lack of dominant controlling factors for rainfall variability in these regions and 
that whatever these factors may be they are not well related to warm and cold events. On 
the other hand, the rainfall variability over northern China shows a much clearer 
separation between warm and cold events, with the warm events favoring drier and cold 
events favoring wetter condition. For warm events, the averaged rainfall is 
approximately 30 mm (31%) below the summer monthly mean (98mm). For cold events, 
the averaged rainfall is 20 mm (20%) above the mean. The monthly rainfall there may 
exceed 80% below (above) normal during extreme warm (cold) events, such as the ones 
during 1997-98. This substantial differences in regional rainfall anomalies with respect to 
warm and cold events are consistent with the results of WLX, i.e., the only region in 
China that shows a robust correlation with the SST anomaly in the equatorial eastern 
Pacific is in the northern part of the country. 

It should be pointed out that a lack of a consistent relationship of the rainfall 
variability over YRV with El Nino (as shown in Fig. 2b) does not preclude the possibility 
that individual El Nino can exert influence on the YRV rainfall. As pointed out by Lau 
(1992) and Shen and Lau (1995), a strong monsoon- ENSO relationship is often 
accompanied by a strong QB signal. In some monsoon regions this is manifested in the 



form of an alternation of dry and wet years. Consider the three well-known major flood 
occurrences in YRV for our data period, 1998, 1973 and 1954. Fig. 3 shows the monthly 
rainfall variation for two consecutive years in the three cases. The continuous line 
represents the climatological seasonal cycle. The excessive rainfall in YRV during 1998, 
1973 and 1954 are quite obvious, with 1954 having the largest rainfall excess. Notice also 
that the phases of the excessive rainfall are not quite the same in all three cases. Most 
interesting is that in the year before the flood, the YRV region tends to be drier than 
normal, with a few exceptional months, possibly due to intraseasonal variability. For all 
three cases, a reversal from below to above normal rainfall conditions seems to occur 
toward October to November of the year before the flood. It is also noted that the three 
El Nino events during 1997-98, 1972-73 and 1953-54 have a strong QB component, i.e., 
a well defined cold event followed immediately the peak phase of a warm event. The 
summers of 1953 and 1972 are during the warm phase of two so-called biennial-ENSO 
events as classified by Tomita and Yasunari (1993). The 1997 summer would also be in 
the biennial-ENSO category as shown later by wavelet timescales in Section 4b. Hence, 
there may be a more subtle relationship between severe drought and flood associated with 
the QB signal when El Nino impacts are considered. 

In this regard, it is worth noting that the strong 1982-83 El Nino was not followed 
by a pronounced La Nina and that there were no major flood occurrence over the YRV in 
1983. Obviously, QB is not the only signal contributing to YRV rainfall variability, and 
three cases of severe floods can hardly constitute a statistically significant relationship. 
The main purpose of the above discussion is for illustration only. In the following we 
will present more detailed analysis and further elaborate on these preliminary 
observations. 

b) Observed SST and rainfall anomalies during 1 99 7/98 summers 

The summer (Jun- July-august, or JJA) of 1997 chronicled the growing phase of the 
1997-98 El Nino, featuring large positive SST anomalies in the equatorial eastern Pacific 
extending westward into the dateline (Fig. 4a). The eastern Pacific SST anomaly had 
risen to 3-4°C above normal, boasting the highest SST ever reached in the equatorial 



eastern Pacific in the past 44 years. An extensive pool of cold water was found centered 
at 40°N 1 70°E in the extratropical North Pacific to the east of Japan. Notice that the 
entire Indian Ocean was warmer than normal. The Indian Ocean warming, which was 
just beginning in JJA, continued on through the fall to winter reaching record level in the 
late 1997 (Webster et al 1999, Yu and Reneicker 1999). Except for a small region near 
New Guinea, SST in the entire Indo-Pacific basin was above normal. In 1998 summer 
(Fig. 4b), cold water was established over the Nino-3 area, with negative anomaly in 
excess of 1 .5°C, signaling the emergence of a La Nina. At this time, while remnant of 
warm water was still present in the extreme eastern tropical Pacific, the cold pool in the 
North Pacific during 1997 gave way to a warm pool. The latter was the extension of a 
large body of warm water covering the entire western Pacific and Indian Ocean. Along 
the equator, the SST began to develop into a seesaw pattern with warm western 
Pacific/Indian Ocean and cold central/eastern Pacific. A similar seesaw was also found 
over the subtropical north Pacific with a warm center at 20°N, 150°E and a cold center off 
the coast of North America near 30° N. Notice that the Indian Ocean remained relatively 
warm in both years. 

The East Asian monsoon was extremely anomalous during 1997 and 1998. In 
1997, the anomaly rainfall distribution featured the classic " North-Dry/South- Wet" 
pattern, with the dividing line near 25°N-30°N (Fig. 4c). This is a well-known anomalous 
rainfall in China known as bei-han/nan-lao. The rainfall pattern was consistent with the 
following report: The Yellow River and the Huai River (40°N) regions of northern China 
was gripped by the most serious drought since 1972. Wild spread flooding were reported 
in regions in southern and southeastern China. The Guandong province and Hong Kong 
had rainfall 300-500 mm in excess of the climatological mean. (National Climate Center 
1998). 

In the summer 1998, the rainfall pattern changed dramatically. Most areas in 
China, except for the southeastern coastal region and central northern portion had above 
normal rainfall. The heavy rainfall was concentrated in the central and southern parts 
(excluding the southern coastal region) of the country. In the YRV region, especially 
near the mid- and upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the summer rainfall total exceeded 



the normal by 300-500 mm (about doubled). Another area of heavy rainfall was found in 
northeastern China, where the rainfall total also exceeded the mean by 200 mm (about 
doubled). The above descriptions show that the rainfall anomalies over China underwent 
a dramatic shift from 1997 to 1998. This shift occurred at the time when the basin-scale 
tropical SST was also transitioning from a warm to a cold phase. It is therefore naturally 
to think that the shift in rainfall and the basin-scale SST evolution may be linked. In the 
remainder of this paper, we will further elaborate on various possible linkages. First, we 
will identify and provide physical interpretation of the dominant modes of China rainfall- 
SST covariability based on the historical data. Then we assess the impacts of SST on 
1 997-98 rainfall anomalies based on a mode-by-mode synthesis of observed anomalies, 
and comparison with some other years. 

4. Rainfall-SST covariability modes 

This section presents results of a SVD analysis on the rainfall and SST field for the 
period 1955-1998. The analysis for the period 1955-97 was carried out by WLX. The 
general characteristics of these coupled SVD modes are already described in WLX. In 
this section, we have carried out additional analyses, aimed at a physical interpretation of 
the dramatic shift in rainfall and SST during 1997-98. To ensure the robustness of our 
results, the SVD computations have also been carried out with the years 1997 and 1998 
removed. Results (not shown) indicate that the modal patterns are basically unchanged. 
Hence the SVD modes describe intrinsic modes of covariability between the regional 
rainfall in China and the global SST, which are not unduly biased by the 1997 and 1998 
anomalies. 

In the following, we use the suffix s and r to denote the SST and rainfall SVD 
modes, respectively. In the temporal domain, each principal component (PC) (or 
"expansion coefficient") has been normalized by its standard deviation (a ). The 
corresponding spatial pattern has been multiplied by the PC's standard deviation, so that 
each SVD spatial loading represents approximately the 1- a magnitude of the 
component. For the rainfall patterns, instead of presenting the rainfall eigenvectors, we 
choose to present the heterogeneous correlation patterns, i.e., the correlation of the 



observed rainfall anomalies with each PCs (for SST field) of the dominant modes 
(Wallace et al. 1992). This provides an estimate, at every grid location, of the fractional 
variance of rainfall (=squared correlation) that can be explainedby the SST modes. 

a) Spatial and temporal patterns 

I) SVDI 

The first SVD mode explains 34.1% of the squared co-variance between SST and 
rainfall. The spatial pattern (Fig.5a) suggests an El Nino-like structure, with warm water 
in the eastern Pacific and the Indian Ocean/Western Pacific. There are two extensive cold 
pools in the extratropical Pacific in both hemispheres, which intrudes the tropics in the 
central Pacific. 

PCls and PClr (Fig. 5b) are correlated at 0.74, and indicate pronounced interannual 
variability superimposed on a linear wanning trend since 1955, with all years, except 
1996, in the 1990's, having positive amplitude. This pattern is similar to that identified by 
Lau and Weng (1999) as a long-term modulated El Nino mode. Major El Nino events 
can be identified, but not one-to-one, with the interannual variability of this coupled 
mode. Some extreme events occurred in non-El Nino years, e.g., 1980, 1969. 1959-1961. 
Since there is generally a time lag of two seasons between peak monsoon rainfall and 
SST in the eastern equatorial Pacific, this mode can also be identified with the growing 
phase of basin-scale warm events (not necessarily identical with El Nino), which are 
linked to the Asian monsoon. 

The heterogeneous rainfall correlation associated with SVDI s (Fig. 5c) shows an 
alternating high-low-high rainfall pattern spanning central, northern and extreme 
northeastern China. Notice that where the correlation is highest in northern China, the 
maximum is only about 0.3 (or about 9% of the local rainfall variance). Hence, only a 
small fraction of the point variance can be explained by the variability associated with 
this dominant mode. In the semi-arid regions of western China, the correlation is also 
relatively high. However, as noted earlier, spatial sampling may be a problem here. 



2) SVD2 



SVD2 explains 15% of the total squared covariance between rainfall and SST. The 
SVD2s pattern (Fig. 6a) is associated with an emerging cold event, and in a number of 
cases can be identified with a developing La Nina, e.g., 1998, 1988. The SST pattern 
features a see-saw between the western Pacific and the eastern Pacific, with the dividing 
line near the dateline at the equator, but tilting eastward with latitude in both 
hemispheres. The center of the negative anomaly is over the Nino-3 region, while the 
centers of the positive anomalies are in the waters surrounding the maritime continent and 
in the subtropical western Pacific. The Indian Ocean SST is above normal, with a weak 
east-west SST gradient, whose sense is opposite to that in the Pacific. The SST pattern is 
similar to that associated with the QB mode in the East Asian monsoon region (Shen and 
Lau 1995). 

The correlation between PC2s and PC2r is at 0.71. The reversal in sign of PC2s 
and PC2r between 1997 and 1998 suggests a strong biennial tendency (Fig. 6b). A 
strong biennial signal (more so in the rainfall PC) can also be discerned in different 
portion of the time series, e.g., the 1990s and the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. As will 
be shown later by wavelet analysis, the quasi-biennial timescale is dominant in this mode. 

The heterogeneous rainfall pattern associated with this mode (Fig. 6c) shows 
increased rainfall in a broad swath from southwest to northeast China with the strongest 
loading (>0.3) over the YRV and the extreme northeastern portion of China. The rainfall 
and SST pattern resembles those obtained by Shen and Lau (1995), who identified the 
patterns as the dominant QB mode in East Asia monsoon rainfall and SST variability 

3) SVD3 

While the fraction of the squared covariance explained by this mode, 10.8%, is not 
very high, the correlation between PC3s and PC3r (=0.77) is the highest among the first 
three SVD modes. This is due to the long time scale inherent in this mode. The SST 
distribution (Fig. 7a) features a wavelike structure linking the eastern equatorial Pacific, 
the subtropical eastern and the North Pacific, over the eastern part of the Pacific basin. No 
clear SST patterns are found over the Indo-western Pacific tropical oceans. 



Both PC3s and PC3r in Fig. 7b show that positive and negative anomalies tend to 
cluster around decades (see discussion in next section). Superimposed on the decadal 
variations are an apparent trend, favoring positive anomalies since the 1980s, and 
negative anomalies in the 1950s and in the early to the mid-1960s. The dominant 
timescale of this mode and the pronounced features in the SST field in the subtropical 
eastern North Pacific suggest a possible connection with decadal scale oceanic 
thermocline adjustment processes (McCreary and Lu 1994; Gu and Philander 1997). 

The heterogeneous rainfall distribution (Fig. 7c) indicates opposite wet and dry 
regions to the south and north of the Yangtze River. The Inner Mongolia region in 
northern central China has the same variation tendency with the area to the south of the 
Yangtze River. According to the PC3r, the aforementioned long-term drought over 
northern China since 1980 may be associated with this decadal-coupled mode. 

b) Dominant timescales 

In this section we present results of a wavelet analysis of the principal components 
of the dominant modes to reaffirm the time scales mentioned in the previous section. 
Each PCs and PCr of the first three modes are decomposed by Morlet wavelet transform. 
To allow for comparison of the magnitude, we use the original PCs (without 
normalization by standard deviation). Figs. 8 and 9 show the global wavelet spectra (left 
panels) and the real wavelet coefficients (right panels) for SST and rainfall, respectively. 
In the following, we refer to interannual variability (IAV) as timescales between 2-8 
years and decadal-to-interdecadal variability (DIV) as those longer than 8 years. 

In SVD1, for SST signal (PCls), the global wavelet spectrum (Fig. 8a) and the real 
wavelet coefficients (Fig. 8b) show that the IAV is dominant, with a peak around 3.7 
years. There are two sidebands at 2.2 years (i.e., the QB signal) and 5.6 years 
respectively. These are fundamental timescales associated with El Nino (Rasmusson et 
al. 1990; Tomita and Yasunari 1993; Lau and Sheu 1988). There is also a bidecadal 
signal around 18-20 years, which appears to be gradually intensifying since the 1980s 
(Fig. 8b). In addition, the IAV also tends to migrate towards longer time scales in the 
1990s. The long-term trend noted in the previous discussion is projected as the longest 



10 



resolvable timescale of about 50-years and longer. For rainfall (PClr) (Figs. 9a and 9b) 
the main features are almost identical to those for SST, but the individual peaks are much 
less well defined. It is clear that this mode is dominated by IAV related to basin-scale 
SST variations associated with El Nino, with significant modulation by the DIV 
variability (see also discussion in previous section). 

In SVD2, for SST signal (?C2s), a dominant peak is found at the QB time scale of 
about 2.2 years and a secondary peak at about 10 years (Fig.8c and 9c). The QB signal is 
strongest in the rainfall variability (PC2r) (Figs. 9c and 9d). The wavelet coefficient for 
PC2r (Fig. 9d) shows that the QB signal is quite pronounced in the late 1960s to the early 
1970s, weak or almost absent in the 1980s, but becomes pronounced again in the 1990s. 
Similar amplitude modulation can be seen in PC2s with weaker signal (Fig. 8d). Such a 
QB signal modulated by interdecadal variation in the East Asian summer monsoon and 
the tropical Pacific SSTs was also found by Chang et al. (1999). 

The typical El Nino time scales (averaged as 4 years) are not well reflected in this 
mode. The decadal signal is comparatively stronger in the SST than in the rainfall field. 
In the time domain, the decadal signal is relatively weaker in the middle of the record, 
i.e., in the 1970s, in both fields. An analysis of the correlation into frequency bands show 
that most of the correlation between SST and rainfall come from the QB signal (not 
shown). The results here reveal strong modulation of the QB signal by decadal 
variability. Such a close relationship between the QB signal and decadal variability has 
also been observed in other climate variables (e.g., Barnston and Livezey 1989; Labitzke 
and van Loon 1992). 

In SVD3, for SST signal (PC3s), the time scale is dominated by a decadal 
oscillation, which stands as a single peak (-10 years) in the PC3s wavelet spectrum (Fig. 
8e). Here, the IAV appears as transients, i.e., weak or no correlation between SST and 
rainfall. The decadal oscillation in this mode appears to have stronger amplitude in the 
1960s-70s, but becomes weaker in the last two decades. In the rainfall component, 
PC3r, both the decadal and the biennial signal can be seen. The decadal oscillations 
appear to be quite robust throughout the entire period (Fig. 8f and 9f). The decadal 



11 



variability accounts for much of the high correlation (=0.77) between the SST and rainfall 
variability in this mode. 

5. Reconstruction of the 1997 and 1998 anomalies 

In this section, we use the dominant modes to assess the possible impacts of the 
recent El Nino/La Nina events on the 1997 and 1998 rainfall anomalies over China. 
Using the first 5 SVDs, we reconstructed the SST and rainfall anomalies for the summer 
of 1997 and 1998 (Fig. 10). We found that after the first four SVD modes, the inclusion 
of each additional SVD mode provides very little incremental covariance fraction (< 4%) 
between constructed and observed fields on average in the past 44 years, and especially 
for 1997 and 1998. From Fig. 10, it is obvious that the reconstructed fields are quite 
similar to the observed, with almost all the main features well represented, but weaker 
magnitude than the observed (see Fig. 4). In the reconstructed 1997 SST (Fig. 10a), the 
basin-scale warmth of the tropical Indo-Pacific and the subtropical SST dipole can now 
be seen more clearly. In 1998, the subtropical SST dipole can also be seen, with an 
unusually warm western subtropics and Indian Ocean (Fig. 10b). The north/dry-south/wet 
{bei/han-nan/lao) rainfall pattern in 1997 is very pronounced (Fig. 10c). In 1998, the 
rainfall pattern has a strong positive center over the middle YRV (Fig. lOd), with 
widespread above-normal rainfall over most of China. The spatial correlation coefficients 
between the reconstructed and the observed patterns are 0.92 for SST and 0.82 for rainfall 
in 1997, and the counterparts in 1998 are 0.83 and 0.77, respectively. The high 
correlation attests to the notion that there may be dominant SST related mechanisms 
influencing the 1997 and 1998 rainfall anomalies over China. 

Fig. 11 and 12 show the mode-by-mode reconstruction and cumulative anomaly 
correlation of the observed rainfall anomalies by the first three SVD for 1997 and 1998 
respectively. The observed rainfall fields are reproduced here for visual comparison. In 
1997, El Nino related influence (SVD1) accounts for about 50% of the anomaly 
correlation. The addition of the effect due to the QB mode (SVD2) contributes an 
additional 23% to the cumulative correlation. According to the opposite signs of PCI r 
and PC2r (see Figs. 5b and 6b), the QB impact opposes that due to El Nino over the YRV 



12 



in 1997. However, the QB mode and the ENSO influence reinforce and accentuate the 
drought situation over northern China and the flood situation along the southern coast of 
China. The first two SVD modes combine to explain up to 73% cumulative correlation. 
Comparison of Figs. 1 lb and 1 Id indicates that the major features of the observed rainfall 
are captured by these two modes. The inclusion of the decadal mode (SVD3) only 
marginally increases the anomaly correlation. It should be pointed out that even though 
SVD3 does not contribute much to the anomaly correlation, some of the long-term, 
decadal- interdecadal variabilities are already contained in the El Nino and the QB modes 
(see discussion in Section 4b). 

The spatial correlation between the El Nino mode (SVD1) and the rainfall anomaly 
field in 1998 is only 0.29. The addition of the QB mode boosts the correlation to 0.67. 
Visually, it can be seen that major features in the observed anomalies are again captured 
by the combination of the two modes. The heavy rain center over the YRV and to a 
lesser degree the northeast are well captured. Notably absent from the reconstruction are 
the wet conditions over the southwest, suggesting that these features may not be related to 
the El Nino or the QB SST variability. 

The cumulative anomaly correlation is a measure only of the coherence of the 
phases of the reconstructed and observed patterns. However, for estimating the severity 
of floods and droughts, knowledge of the magnitude is more important. To estimate the 
mode-by-mode contribution to the magnitude of the anomalies, we use the cumulative 
relative error variance (CREV) defined as 



CREV; ^[OBS-^iPCj xSVDtf /£(05S) 2 , 

x,y j=\ x,y 

where OBS represents observed rainfall anomaly, the summation overy indicates that the 
reconstruction is based on the first J cumulative modes, and the summation over x, y 
indicates that the error is estimated at each grid point and summed up over a designated 
spatial domain. Figure 13 shows the CREV for the first five cumulative modes for rainfall 
in all China, YRV, southern China and northern China for 1997, 1998, and the average 
for 1955-98. Here the smaller the CREV, the better the reconstruction is as an 
approximation of the observed rainfall magnitude. 



13 



For all-China (Fig. 13a), for the long-term average (1955-98), the CREV decreases 
steadily as more and more modes are included in the reconstruction. The average error 
remains fairly high (~ 60%) even when the 5 th mode is included. For 1997 and 1998, the 
error due to SVD1 is quite large, i.e., 90% for 1998 and 70% for 1997. The largest 
reduction in error (compared to the long-term mean) appears to come from SVD2. 
Further error reduction due to inclusion of higher modes is only minimal. These suggest 
that as a whole, the all-China rainfall is somewhat affected by the El Nino growth mode 
(SVD1) in 1997, but more so by the QB mode (SVD2) in 1998. As discussed previously, 
the all-China region encompasses a number of rainfall regimes and is not a very good 
measure of regional variability. 

The regional error patterns are more revealing. Over the YRV (Fig. 13b), it can be 
seen that in 1997, and especially in 1998, the QB mode (SVD2) is dominant. The 
combination of these two modes reduces the error variance to less than 20%, substantially 
less than the long-term mean. In contrast, in southern China (Fig. 1 3c), SVD2 seems to 
have an impact in 1997, but not in 1998 (CREV >120%). Here, higher order modes, in 
particular SVD4 that has a multi-decadal timescale and same polarity of rainfall over 
most area of China (not shown), may have a strong contribution. In northern China (Fig. 
13d), SVD1 has a strong impact in 1997 (CREV <25%), but has not much influence in 
1998 (CREV> 100%). 

The aforementioned results for 1997-98 are consistent with those discussed with 
regard to Figs. 2 and 3, i.e., northern China has the most impact from El Nino growing 
phase, the YRV region has a pronounced biennial variability, and southern China has the 
most diverse variability, including higher order modes. 

6. Conclusions 

We have identified three dominant modes of summer rainfall-SST covariability 
over China. Using these modes, we assess the SST impacts on regional rainfall 
anomalies in China during 1997 and 1998. The most dominant mode can be identified 
with the growing phase of El Nino, modulated by a trend since the mid-1950s. The 
corresponding rainfall pattern, in the sense of a positive principal component, features 



14 



above normal rainfall in central, northeastern and western China, coupled to a below 
normal rainfall over northern China. The trend may be related to the long-term drought 
experienced over northern China since the early 1 970's. 

The second mode is dominated by the quasi-biennial oscillation accompanied by 
decadal variation in the tropical ocean-atmosphere, distinguished by a SST sea-saw 
pattern between the Indo-western Pacific and the eastern Pacific. In its positive phase, 
the mode can be identified with the growing phase of La Nina (warm Indo-western 
Pacific and cold eastern Pacific), coupled to excessive rainfall over the middle reaches of 
the Yangtze River. The third mode is dominated by a quasi-decadal oscillation, which is 
characterized by wave-like SST pattern linking the equatorial eastern Pacific to the 
extratropical northern central Pacific along the coast of North America. This mode may 
be linked to long-term dry (wet) conditions over northern (southern) China. 

The rainfall anomalies over China in 1997 and 1998 were strongly impacted by 
global SST anomalies. In 1997 and 1998, the anomaly correlation between the 
reconstructed (based on the first two SVD modes) and the observed rainfall is 0.73 and 
0.67, respectively. Since the squared correlation is a measure of fractional variance, this 
means that on the average over all-China, approximately 53% and 45% of the rainfall 
variance can be attributed to SST anomalies associated with the El Nino and the QB 
mode. These represent the largest percentages of explained rainfall variance by global 
scale SST anomaly in the past 44 years. From a mode-by-mode decomposition, we 
deduce that the drought in northern China and the flood in southern China in 1997 
summer are associated with the growing phase of the El Nino. On the other hand, the 
flooding over the YRV and over northeast China is associated with the quasi-biennial 
mode SST, distinguished by a well-defined La Nina, which commenced during the 
summer of 1998, following immediately the demise of the El Nino. 

Finally, a prolonged drought over northern China and increased flood tendency over 
the YRV since the 1950s may be associated with a long-term warming trend in the 
tropics, in particular the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific region. During 1997, the 
El Nino SST forcing exacerbated the drought over northern China. In 1998, the drought 
appeared to get a temporary relief from the La Nina SST forcing. 



15 



Overall, it appears that during 1997and 1998 summers, much of the regional rainfall 
variability in China has been influenced by the well-defined turn-around, i.e., biennial 
cycle, in SST anomalies from El Nino to La Nina. Summertime rainfall variability over 
China is only a part of the vast Asian monsoon system. It remains an intriguing 
possibility that the Asian monsoon may be the source of biennial variability in El Nino. 
More work on coupling of regional monsoon variability to El Nino is needed to explore 
this possibility.
