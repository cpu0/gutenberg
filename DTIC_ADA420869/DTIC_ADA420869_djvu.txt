INTRODUCTION 


This project describes research in statistical methods that would be useful for statistical 
modelling and analysis of clinical data from NF1 and NF2 subjects. The statistical methods are 
classified into the areas: 

(a) estimation of familial correlation for different types of data, 

(b) assessment of multi-hit mutation models for incidence of tumours. 

Some of the statistical methods to be developed are either new or partly new and require further 
research for computer software implementation. 

Clinical data exist in many formats including binary, categorical, count, and continuous 
information. Furthermore, a common "real life" problem is censored data (where the beginning or 
end point is not known for all cases but some intermediate data exist). One goal of the project is 
to produce a software package for familial data analysis for different types of data, such as 
binary, count, and censored survival data.

BODY 


Purpose of the project: 

(A) To develop statistical methods that can be used to characterize the phenotype of individuals 
withNFl andNF2. 

(B) To develop methods to elaborate on the standard two-hit model of tumour formation taking 
into account additional pathogenic factors and allelic differences for tumours in NF1 and NF2. 


The research accomplishments associated with each objective from the statement of work are 
summarized below. 


Objective 1. Develop statistical methods for interval-censored data, and obtain estimates of age 
of onset distributions for NF1 and NF2 features, using longitudinal information in the databases. 

This objective is being postponed as we currently do not have enough longitudinal information in 
the databases. 


Objective 2. Develop statistical methods for familial correlations for non-continuous and 
censored data, and obtain estimates of intraclass and interclass correlations for quantitative and 
binary traits in NF1 and NF2. 

Estimation of familial correlations in clinical traits is related to the assessment of familial 
aggregation in genetic diseases. It is important to our understanding of the causes of variable 
expressivity in Mendelian diseases. 

Much progress in the past year, in the published papers and a near completed PhD thesis has been 
in this objective. A summary of the statistical aspects of the published papers was given in last 
year's annual report. Some extracts from the forthcoming thesis of Yinshan Zhao, specifically, 
Section 1.4 with an outline by chapter, and a section with a summary of the new estimation 
methods are given in an Appendix. Yinshan Zhao's PhD committee received a first draft of the 
complete thesis in August 2003. It is planned to have the thesis defended before the end of the 
year 2003. 

We give a short overview of Zhao's thesis research. This work involves the theory for various 
estimating equation approaches that should lead to more reasonable computing time for 
estimating familial associations for traits in the form of right-censored survival or count data, etc. 
An example of a count variable is the number of tumors of a particular type; an example of a 


5 


right-censored survival variable is the age of onset of a particular disease feature - those who do 
not have the feature are right-censored at the age of last clinical observation. 


For most of the multivariate models for familial data, such as those with a latent multivariate 
normal distribution, the maximum likelihood approach is not computationally tractable when 
high-dimensional numerical integration is involved. It is desirable to develop other estimating 
approaches which are computationally less demanding, and relatively efficient (in the sense of 
variance of the sampling distribution of the estimator). Estimation using two types of composite 
likelihood equations are considered; these are based on the likelihoods of the univariate and 
bivariate margins of the multivariate model. They are called two-stage and bivariate composite 
likelihood in the Appendix. 

The estimates of the model parameters based on composite likelihood methods are 
asymptotically consistent and unbiased. There are three types of parameters in the models for 
familial data: regression or covariate coefficients, dispersion parameters and dependence 
parameters. The 

estimates are much easier to compute under many circumstances compared to the maximum 
likelihood estimates. The major concern of these approaches is the efficiency. Comparisons of 
the relative efficiency of these two approaches against the maximum likelihood method have 
been made, with summaries given in the Appendix. Different models, including multivariate 
normal, multivariate probit, lognormal-Poisson mixture and multivariate lognormal with right 
censoring, have been examined analytically or by Monte Carlo simulation. 

Other work done by a research assistant Lisa Kuramoto is summarized below. We summarize the 
new developments in statistical methodology, particularly in the modelling of familial count data. 

Genotype-phenotype analyses, accounting for the familial associations, were done for 
absence/presence of cataracts and some count variables for the NF2 database; count variables 
included the number of spinal tumors, number of meningiomas, and number of cutaneous 
Schwannomas for NF2 patients. The main analyses used for a manuscript, to be written and 
submitted, was based on the negative-binomial gamma mixture model proposed in Zhao et al 
(2002). The main results of the analyses are summarized in the Abstracts in the Appendix? 

In addition, for comparisons, we also fitted a zero-inflated multivariate Poisson-log normal 
model [the latter from Aitchison and Ho (1989)]. Zero inflation refers to a standard probability 
distribution for count data, with extra probability assigned to a count of zero. If the count 
variable refers to a tumor count, zero inflation is reasonable for statistical modelling when the 
high observed frequency of zero counts includes a subset of subjects with a mild form of the 
disease. 

The zero-inflated multivariate Poisson-log normal model has more flexibility than the 
negative-binomial gamma mixture model in terms of familial dependence. Without the zero 
inflation for the multivariate Poisson-log normal model, we found that the fit to the count 


6 



i 


variables was not very good; this is because the count variables are heavily right skewed (some 
large counts of the order of 50) and have a high frequency of zero. The zero inflation for the 
Poisson-log normal model adds a third univariate parameter to the marginal count distribution, 
resulting in as many univariate non-regression parameters as the negative-binomial gamma 
mixture model. Because of the shape of the histogram of the count variables for the NF2 
database, univariate marginal distributions with three non-regression parameters are needed to 
provide an adequate fit. 


Objective 3. Fit multi-hit mutation models for the incidence of NF2 and NF1 tumours by age, 
distinguish whether a two-hit or three-hit model provides a better fit to the data, and adapt the 
models to account for mutation type and other factors. 

Two- and three-hit models are vestibular schwanomas were fit to data for NF2 subjects; this was 
published in Genetic Epidemiology in 2003 [Woods et al 2003], With the latest NF2 database 
with more data on mutation type, we still plan to further check on the strength of the 
genotype-phenotype correlations when fitting the two-hit and three-hit models for vestibular 
schwanomas separately for several mutation types. 

An additional task, not part of the original objectives but which relates to objective 3, was 
providing support to MSc student, Bernard Lee, for a project to determine areas ofiVFi involved 
in transcriptional regulation. This support included providing expertise in interpreting algorithms 
and bioinformatic analyses as well as sequence alignment analyses for comparative genomics. 

An understanding of this region of the NF1 gene and mutations that can possibly arise in the 
transcriptional control region is crucial to adequate classification of mutations for genotype- 
phenotype mutational studies. Please see the appendix for an abstract describing this research. 


Objective 4. Write C code to implement all of these statistical methods and provide a 
user-friendly interface for the code. 

Software written in C/C++, is being developed in Unix/Linux; it runs also in Windows with 
Cygnus/Gnuwin [see www.cygwin.com], the public domain version of Unix for Windows. The 
implementation of the interface currently is through control files which specifies parameters and 
data files. By the end of 2001, methods for binary and quantitative (continuous) traits had been 
integrated into a computer package and this was used in the statistical analysis in Szudek et al 
(2002). Later it was used in the analysis for the presence/absence of cataracts in Baser et al 
(2003). 

The additional modules, completed since the last annual report, are a module for the handling of 
familial survival data based on multivariate normal distribution (this module expanded on work 
of D Aeschliman reported last year), and modules for familial count data. For count data, the 


7 


/ 


J 


models being implemented (referred to under Objective 2) are the negative-binomial gamma 
mixture model, and the zero-inflated multivariate Poisson-log normal models, as these have been 
found to be the most useful for tumor count data in NF2 patients. 

New modules based the estimation methods from Zhao's PhD thesis research will be added after 
the thesis is completed. 

The latest version of the software package will be put in the directory 
ftp://ftp.stat.ubc.ca/pub/hioe/famil/

CONCLUSIONS 


As discussed in the previous year’s report, progress on objective 1 has been limited by data 
availability. We will complete this objective if data become available. At the current time, more 
data are becoming available on NF2 as the new NF2 genotype-phenotype database in the 
Friedman Lab at UBC, in Vancouver become populated. 

For objectives 2 and 3, the theory for simplest cases has been mostly developed. The coding into 
C programs and use on current NF1/NF2 databases (objective 4) has been done for the statistical 
methods, but not have been implemented into the software package. Both objectives have also 
been expanded somewhat from the original plan of work. 

e ,s 

To date, seven manuscripts have been accepted for publication, and t*e others has* been 
submitted. Presentations were made at the 2000-2002 meetings of the American Society of 
Human Genetics and are planned for the 2003 meeting. In addition this year, five presentations 
were made at the NNFF International Consortium for the Molecular Biology ofNFl and NF2, at 
the Fourth International Conference on Vestibular Schwannoma and Other CPA Lesions, 
Cambridge UK, and at the 10 th European Neurofibromatosis Meeting, Turku (Finland). The more 
statistically theoretical papers based on Zhao's thesis will be written after the completion of her 
thesis. We are behind schedule because of the PhD research; in advance it is hard to predict how 
quickly PhD students can accomplish things.

Genotype-phenotype correlations for cataracts in neurofibromatosis 2 

EDITOR - Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant disease that is caused by 
inactivating mutations of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. 1,2 Multiple central and peripheral 
nervous system tumors and ocular abnormalities are common in NF2; bilateral vestibular 
schwannomas are pathognomonic for the disease. Genotype-phenotype correlations are well- 
established for NF2-associated tumors. In general, constitutional nonsense or ffameshift NF2 
mutations are associated with severe NF2 (i.e., earlier onset of symptoms and more tumors), 
splice-site mutations with variable disease severity, and missense mutations with mild disease. 

Genotype-phenotype correlations have not been demonstrated for the non-tumor 
manifestations of NF2. The most common of these manifestations is presenile cataracts 
(posterior subcapsular and cortical), which occur in about 60-80% of people with NF2. 3 ' 5 In 
animal models, lens fiber cells that are more differentiated express less Nf2 protein than the 
epithelial regions of the lens, suggesting that the Nf2 protein may play a role in lens epithelial 
cell migration or elongation. 6 The purpose of this study was to determine if there were 
genotype-phenotype correlations for cataracts in NF2. 

The study was based on the United Kingdom NF2 registry in the Department of Medical 
Genetics, St. Mary's Hospital, Manchester. NF2 patients are ascertained by contacting 
neurosurgeons, otolaryngologists, neurologists, pediatricians, dermatologists, and geneticists 
throughout the United Kingdom, augmented in the North West Region by the Regional Cancer 
Registry. The study was subject to continuing ethics committee evaluation and subjects 
consented to participation. Patients were screened for constitutional NF2 mutations using single¬ 
strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP) as previously described, 7 and examined 


2 


for cataracts using slitlamp biomicroscopy at the time of diagnosis of NF2. For this study, 
cataracts were defined as present or absent (i.e., posterior subcapsular cataracts and cortical 
cataracts were aggregated). There were 255 people from 190 families (159 people with new 
mutations and 96 inherited cases; 132 females and 123 males) (Table 1). 

For univariate analyses, Fisher’s exact test was used for binary variables and the two- 
tailed t-test for continuous variables. A multivariate probit model with an exchangeable 
correlation structure within families was used with various sets of covariates to account for 
possible familial dependence. 8 From a regression coefficient p, an approximate relative risk (RR 
= exp{2*p}) and confidence interval (Cl) for presence of cataracts can be calculated. In the 
probit model, people with classical NF2 (i.e., who met the Manchester clinical diagnostic criteria 
for NF2 9 ) and constitutional nonsense or frameshift NF2 mutations were the reference group in 
comparisons between people with different types of NF2 mutations. 

There is a potential bias toward a lower age at onset of symptoms or age at diagnosis in 
inherited cases due to the family history of the disease. In the study group as a whole, there were 
no significant differences in these ages between people with new mutations and inherited cases 
for any type of NF2 mutation. Also, using a probit model, the RR of cataracts was not 
significantly associated with age at diagnosis (see below). Therefore, for all mutation categories 
except unfound mutations, we combined people with new mutations and inherited cases. In the 
large group of people with unfound mutations, we retained the division between those with new 
mutations and inherited disease because people with new unfound mutations may be somatic 
mosaics. We used age at onset of symptoms to categorize people with new unfound mutations 
by disease severity (severe disease, onset of symptoms at ages < 20 years; mild disease, onset of 
symptoms at ages > 20 years). 3 


3 


As expected, the mean age at onset of symptoms and age at diagnosis were higher in 
people with non-truncating mutations and in somatic mosaics than in people with classical NF2 
and nonsense or frameshift mutations (Table 1). The overall prevalence of cataracts was 33%, 
but the prevalence of cataracts was significantly lower in somatic mosaics and in people with 
new unfound mutations and onset of symptoms at ages > 20 years than in people with classical 
NF2 and nonsense or frameshift mutations. In people with cataracts, 29% were diagnosed with 
cataracts at ages <10 years, and 47% at ages < 20 years (mean + SE, 23 + 2 years). Seventy per 
cent were diagnosed with cataracts before their first non-ocular sign or symptom. 

In the multivariate probit model summarized in Table 2, the RR of cataracts did not 
significantly increase with increasing age at diagnosis, after accounting for the type of 
constitutional NF2 mutation. In other probit models, the RR of cataracts also did not 
significantly increase with increasing age, after accounting for the type of constitutional NF2 
mutation (data not shown). This is probably due to the relatively young study population (mean 
± SE age at diagnosis, 28 ± 1 years; only 5% diagnosed at ages > 55 years and 2% at ages > 60 
years), since the prevalence of posterior subcapsular and cortical cataracts in people aged < 55 
years in the general population is very low. 10 

The RR and estimated prevalence of cataracts was lower in all mutation groups as 
compared to people with classical NF2 and nonsense or frameshift mutations. This difference 
was statistically significant in somatic mosaics (RR = 0.20, 95% Cl = 0.10 - 0.40), in people with 
large deletions (RR = 0.39, 95% Cl = 0.16 - 0.98), and in people with new unfound mutations 
and onset of symptoms at ages > 20 years (RR = 0.09,95% Cl = 0.03 - 0.28). The RR of 
cataracts in people with missense mutations was low but not statistically significant (RR = 0.38, 


4 


95% Cl = 0.14 -1.08). The lower RR of cataracts in each of these groups is consistent with the 
generally mild disease in NF2 patients with these types of mutations or conditions. 

The lower RR of cataracts in people with new unfound mutations and mild disease could 
be due to several types of mutations or conditions that are unlikely to be identified by SSCP, and 
that are known to be associated or likely to be associated with mild NF2. These mutations or 
conditions are somatic mosaicism; large deletions, insertions, or other rearrangements; mutations 
in the 3 or 5 untranslated regions, the promoter region, or untranscribed transcriptional 
control elements; intronic mutations that are not covered by conventional SSCP primers; or other 
epigenetic events causing loss of NF2 expression, such as methylation. 

Somatic mosaicism and large deletions are the most likely of these possibilities. In the 
present study, 17 (18%) of the 92 patients with new mutations and identified constitutional NF2 
mutations were somatic mosaics. The estimated prevalence of somatic mosaicism in NF2 
patients with new mutations is 25-30%. 11,12 Some of the 41 NF2 patients with new unfound 
mutations and mild disease may be somatic mosaics in whom conventional DNA sequencing of 
lymphocyte DNA PCR product has failed to identify a difference from the normal sequence 
because the mutant allele is present at too low a level to be detected. Constitutional NF2 large 
deletions have been found in 21% of NF2 families using microarray-comparative genomic 
hybridization, 13 and in 32% of NF2 families using multiple mutation screening methods. 14 

The intrafamilial correlation for cataracts was weak (and statistically insignificant) in all 
multivariate probit models that were tried, although there were relatively few families with 
multiple affected relatives. Several other clinical features of NF2 (age at onset of symptoms, age 
at diagnosis, and number of intracranial meningiomas) have strong familial correlations. 15 The 
prevalence of cataracts in the present study was lower than in other studies, 3 ' 5 probably because 


5 


the population-based United Kingdom NF2 registry is less heavily weighted toward NF2 patients 
with severe disease than studies that are based on patients from tertiary referral clinics, 4,5 and 
because some cataract examinations were done by medical specialists other than 
ophthalmologists. Non-ophthalmologists may miss faint cataracts, but in such cases, it is 
unlikely that faint cataracts are missed more frequently in people with mild NF2 than in those 
with severe NF2 (i.e., it will not bias genotype-phenotype correlations). In one large study, all 
patients were examined using slitlamp biomicroscopy by a non-ophthalmologist, and the 
prevalence of cataracts was similar in mild cases (35%) and in severe cases (40%). 9 

The genotype-phenotype correlations for cataracts in the present study extend the 
correlations that have been reported for the tumor manifestations of NF2. The high prevalence 
of cataracts in young NF2 patients, and their frequent occurrence before the tumor manifestations 
of NF2, underscore the importance of non-8 th nerve signs or symptoms of NF2 in children and 
adolescents as a useful aid to diagnosis in this age group. 16

SUMMARY 

For familial aggregation of a binary trait, we compare the GEE2 odds ratio regression or multivariate logit 
model with the multivariate probit model, and report on our computer implementations. One comparison is 
the conditional probability that one (future) member of a family will have (or develop) the trait given that 
status of other family members. Similar to the univariate logit and probit models, the inferences are similar 
in the multivariate case. 

KEY WORDS: multivariate probit and logit models, generalized estimating equations, familial aggregation. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

In quantitative genetics and epidemiology, researchers are often interested in identifying important variables 
or traits related to a genetic disease and also in familial aggregation. The response variables measured for 
the disease can be discrete or continuous. In this paper, we focus on binary traits, such as presence/absence 
of a disease, and presence/absence of a symptom/feature of a genetic disease. For familial aggregation, for 
genetic hypotheses one would like to know the strength of dependence for different relationships in a family 
such as parent-offspring, sib-sib, degree 2 relationship (Falconer 1989). 

One method for multivariate binary data is the GEE2 odds ratio regression or multivariate logit model. 
Liang, Zeger and Qaqish (1992), Molenberghs and Lesaffre (1994), Glonek and McCullagh (1995) and Joe 
(1997) considered this method/model from different points of view. GEE2 odds ratio regression corresponds 
to the multivariate logit model with a multivariate Plackett distribution (Molenberghs and Lesaffre 1994; Joe 
1997). The formulation of Liang and Beaty (1991), and Liang, Zeger and Qaqish (1992) estimates regression 
parameters and log odds dependence parameters based on estimating equations without considering whether 
there is a probability model behind their assumptions. 

The multivariate probit model (Ashford and Sowden 1970, Mendell and Elston 1974) is motivated for 
a binary trait based on a (latent) polygenic effect, so for familial analysis of a binary trait, it is more in¬ 
terpretable than a multivariate logit model. Although odds ratios have a convenient interpretation, there is 
no physical or stochastic model that leads to the odds ratio as a natural dependence parameter. Joe (1997) 
considers the multivariate probit and multivariate logit models as multivariate analogues of the univariate 
probit and logit latent variable family of models.

In this paper, we compare maximum likelihood and GEE2 estimates assuming a multivariate logit model 
and compare conditional probability inferences with the multivariate probit and logit models. The compu¬ 
tation of GEE2 estimates includes the novel use of automatic differentiation software to solve the set of 
estimating equations. 

The organization of the remainder of the paper is as follows. The models are specified as latent vector 
models in Section 2. Computational details are given in Section 3 and comparisons are made in Section 4. 
Section 5 concludes with a discussion. 

2. MODELS AND METHODS FOR A BINARY TRAIT 

For a binary response variable Y, with covariate vector x, common statistical methods are logistic and probit 
regression. Both of these methods are latent variable methods with the probabilistic representation is: 

Y — I(Z < a + /3'x), (2.1) 

where Z is standard normal (logistic) for the probit (logit) regression model. The model (2.1) can be written 
as 

Y = I(X > t), X = —Z + a + /3'x + r ~ N(a + f3'x + r, 1), 

where X is the liability and r is the threshold. For a binary trait, one can apply the Central Limit Theorem to 
arrive at the probit model when the liability is influenced by the additive effects of many genes. The logistic 
density is also bell-shaped, so probabilistic properties of logistic and probit regression are similar. 

For familial data, the binary response vector is (Yi,..., Y d ), where d is the family size. For a model 
for familial aggregation of a binary trait, one needs to define a joint probability distribution for (Yj,..., Y d ) 
for d > 2, where the dependence parameter of responses (Yj, Yj) for two different members of a family, 
depends on the relation type. 

Probit regression model easily extends to the multivariate probit model, with a latent multivariate normal 
random vector. The extension of logistic regression to its multivariate counterpart requires a way to define a 
multivariate logistic distribution with suitable dependence parameters. The extensions are explained below. 

The multivariate probit model has been known for a long time (e.g., Ashford and Sowden 1970, Mendell 
and Elston 1974). The stochastic representation of the model, with common regression parameters for each 
margin, is 

Yj = I(Zj < a + p'xj), j = 1,.,.,d, (Zi,...,Z d )~ N(0,R d ) (2.2) 

where R d is a correlation matrix. For models for familial aggregation, R d can have one or more correla¬ 
tion parameters. For example, for the exchangeable model there is a single correlation parameter p ; for a 
model for nuclear families, one has 3 parameters: correlations ppp, pss, and ppo for parent-parent, sib-sib. 


2 





and parent-offspring respectively; for a model with members in several generations, one may further have 
correlation parameters for second and higher degree relatives. 

To obtain maximum likelihood estmates of the parameters of the model (2.2), multivariate normal rect¬ 
angle probabilities are required, since 


Pr(*i = yu---,Y d = y d ) = Pi(Zi -O-i a + fix u . ..,Z d -<Y d a + fix d ) 


where -o >-j is < if yj = 1 and is > if yj = 0. 

For logistic regression, the regression parameter /? for a binary covariate x has an odds ratio interpre¬ 
tation. For a pair (Yi, Y 2 ), one can use the bivariate Plackett distribution which has an odds ratio as a 
dependence parameter: 


Pr(Yi = 1,Y 2 = l;xi,x 2 ) Pr(Yj = 0, Y 2 = 0;xi,x 2 ) 
Pr(Yi = 1,Y 2 = 0;xi,x 2 ) Pr(Yi = 0 ,Y 2 = l;x x ,x 2 ) 


for all xi,x 2 . Let Fi 2 (zi, z 2 ) be the joint distribution of the latent pair (Z\, Z 2 ) and F(z) = (1 + e~ z )~ l 
be the logistic cumulative distribution function. Then (2.3) is the same as 

_ F i 2 (o: + /3 7 xi, a + fix 2 ) [1 - Fja + fixi) - F(q + fix 2 ) + Fn{a + fix x , a + fix 2 ) 

[F(a +/3'xi) — Fi 2 (a +/3'xi, a +/3'x 2 )] [F(a +/3'x 2 ) - Fi 2 (a +/3'xi, a + /3'x 2 )] 

and this equation can be solved for Fi 2 (a + /3'xi, a + /3'x 2 ). 

The multivariate Plackett extension is given in Molenberghs and Lessaffe (1994), where (2.3) and (2.4) 
are extended to higher orders; for example, for d = 3 dimensions, with n(yi, y 2 , 2/3) = Pr(Yi = y lt Y 2 = 
2/2 ,Y 3 = y 3 ;xi,X2,x 3 ), 

= ^(1, 1, 1) 7r(l, 0 , 0 ) 7r(0, 1, 0) 7r(0, 0,1) 

7123 7r(l, 1, 0) 7r(l, 0, 1) 7r(0, 1, 1) 7r(0, 0,0) [Z ' b) 

For the d-dimensional product ratio, there are 2 d ~ x probabilities each in the numerator and denominator. 
Joe (1997) shows that these ratios do not lead to a proper multivariate logistic distribution if 7123 and higher 
order 7 ’s are close to 0 or large. To have the same number of dependence parameters as the multivariate 
probit model, the third and higher order 7 parameters are taken to be 1 (see Joe 1997 for a maximum entropy 
interpretation in this case). (2.5) and its higher-order equivalents lead to roots of polynomials that must be 
computed to obtain F\... d {a + j3'x 1 ,..., a + (3'x d ), the joint distribution of the latent multivariate logistic 
random vector. 

Liang et al. (1992) and Liang and Beaty (1991) develop a method called odds ratio regression or 
GEE2 and apply it for familial aggregation of a binary trait. They do not assume any joint distribution 
for (Yi,..., Y d ) but estimate interclass and intraclass odds ratios using estimating equations that generalize 
method of moments equations. These estimating equations use multivariate Plackett probabilities for dimen¬ 
sion 2, 3, and 4. Although Liang and Beaty (1991) didn’t mention any underlying model for their method, 


3 



their method corresponds to an estimation method for the multivariate logit model that is different from 
maximum likelihood. We will express their estimating equations in the more general context of familial 
data. 

Let 0 = (/3, ip), where ip is a vector of log odds ratios, with different odds ratio parameters for different 
relation types (similar to the correlations for the probit model). Let y' = (y a , ...,y id .) and let w' = 
(yum, • • • > yiA-iVidi), i = l,...,n, with n families and d, members in the ith family. Let /uj = /u'(/3) = 
(Mil) • • • > Mid,)) where fj+j = E (yij), and r/' = 77' (0) = (E [yny^], ..., E The estimating 

equations have the form: 




i—1 


(0) 


y i-fj-i 


= 0, 


where E*(0) is the covariance matrix of (y*, w t ) based on multivariate Plackett probabilities up to dimension 
4. 


3. COMPUTATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION 

Conceptually, the models in the previous section are straightforward, but computations for the maximum 
likelihood and GEE2 estimation methods are not straightforward. 

For the multivariate probit model, we compute the multivariate normal rectangle probabilities using 
the fast approximation methods given in Joe (1995); the first order approximation requires only bivariate 
normal rectangle probabilities and the second order approximation requires multivariate probabilities up to 
the fourth dimension. The log-likelihood can then be coded and the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) 
of P and the p parameters can be obtained using an iterative quasi-Newton method; for example, the method 
in Nash (1990) is convenient as it also computes the inverse Hessian (asymptotic covariance matrix) at the 
MLE. 

For the multivariate logit model, we have coded the computation of multivariate Plackett probabilities 
by recursively finding the roots of many polynomial equations. Then maximum likelihood estimation and 
quasi-Newton iterations proceed in a similar way to the multivariate probit model. Because of the recursions, 
the computational effort for maximum likelihood estimation is exponentially increasing in the dimension or 
family size d. 

The computer program of Liang and Beaty (1991) and Qaqish et al. (1992) cannot handle familial data in 
general pedigree form; it can only handle familial data in which each pair is either an interclass or intraclass 
pair. This code was written in Pascal and not easy to modify even after conversion to C with p2c. Therefore, 
we wrote a new implementation of GEE2, in which the equations were coded in C++, and the solutions 
of p and ip parameters were obtained using the Newton-Raphson method with automatic differentiation 


4 



(Bendtsen and Stauning 1996) for the derivatives of the estimating equations with respect to the parameters. 
Because this requires multivariate Plackett probabilities in dimensions 4 and less, GEE2 with automatic 
differentiation is faster than maximum likelihood for family sizes of 5 or more, even with the C++ overhead 
in automatic differentiation. 

All of our programs are written in C/C++, and are part of a developing software package for analysis for 
familial response data. Information can be obtained from the first author’s web page. 

The programs are written in a form that allows the user to specify general relation classes (see examples 
in Section 2) and there is a dependence parameter (latent correlation for probit and odds ratio for logit) 
for each relation class. For multivariate probit, one can do a variance component decomposition based on 
the estimated latent correlations. For the simpler use of the programs, the dependence parameters are not 
functions of covariates. This is mainly due to mathematical or probabilistic consistency of the models; there 
is no known way of making the correlation or odds ratio dependence parameters be functions of a covariate 
x so that the resulting correlation matrix is positive definite for all x or the resulting set of odds ratios are 
compatible for all x. For a categorical covariate x, one could split the data into groups for estimates of 
the parameters or form extra relation classes. For example, if the gender of the parent might be a factor, 
one could use father-offspring and mother-offspring relation classes in place of the parent-offspring relation 
class. 


4. COMPARISONS OF THE MODELS/METHODS 

Latif (2001) has a simulation study to compare maximum likelihood and GEE2 estimates of the multivariate 
logistic models. The binary familial data are simulated from multivariate probit model with an age covariate. 
[Note that simulation from the multivariate logit model is much more difficult, since one cannot simulate 
the latent logistic variables easily because of the implicit equations defining the multivariate distribution 
functions.] 

The simulation results are similar in different cases, so we summarize just one of the simulations in 
Latif (2001), in which all families have the 3-generation 5-member pedigree, with a sib-sib pair, one parent, 
one uncle/aunt and one grandparent (see Table I). Other comparisons via simulations in Latif (2001) include 
cases of different pedigrees for different families. 

The table shows that maximum absolute differences of the maximum likelihood and GEE2 parameter 
estimates as well as the average of each point estimate over the 500 simulations of 200 families; the depen¬ 
dence parameters are correlation for probit and log odds ratio for logit. The maximum likelihood and GEE2 
estimates were often the same to 2 or 3 significant digits. The standard deviation of the parameter estimates 
and the average standard errors in each line are roughly the same. See below for the relation of the probit 


5 


and logit regression coefficients, and relation of a latent correlation and odds ratio dependence parameter. 

For illustration with some real data, we use a data set of familial binary response data for patients with 
neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) which is an autosomal dominant genetic disease (Friedman et al. 1999); the bi¬ 
liary variables are indicators of the presence of features, such as cafe-au-lait spots, plexiform neurofibromas, 
intertriginous freckling, Lisch nodules, etc. A detailed study of familial aggregration of features is given in 
Szudek et al. (2002). We just show some results for the presence/absence of peripheral neurofibromas for a 
subset of the NF1 database. The analysis must be adjusted for age because of a tendency of increased inci¬ 
dence of the feature with age. We use three relation classes: sib-sib, parent-offspring and degree 2 relation 
(there are no parent-parent pairs as within the families only one parent has Nfl). For two family members 
with relation of degree 3 or higher, the pairwise dependence parameter is taken to be the value corresponding 
to pairwise independence. Because our data set has fewer pairs for degree 2 than sib-sib or parent-offspring, 
the dependence parameter for degree 2 relation can not be estimated accurately. The family sizes range from 
1 to 7; missing values for the response were assumed to be missing at random. 

Table II has a summary table for the multivariate probit and logit'models, with MLEs for probit and 
GEE2 estimates for logit. The dependence parameters are latent correlations and log odds ratios respectively. 

The standard deviation of the standard logistic distribution is ir/V3 = 1.81, so for the same data, the 
regression coefficients of logistic regression are usually roughly 1.8 times the corresponding regression coef¬ 
ficients of probit regression. For two binary variables based on a latent bivariate standard normal distribution 
with correlation p, the odds ratio depends on the cut-off points, but is bounded by 

(1 — (2/7 t) arcsinp J 

For theNFl example, the estimated latent correlations from multivariate probit are 0.587 and 0.158 for sib- 
sib and parent-offspring, and the estimated odds ratio from multivariate logit are 6.35 and 1.76 respectively. 
For comparison, 5(0.587) = 5.43 and 5(0.158) = 1.50 so that the dependence estimates of the two models 
are comparable given the standard errors in the estimates. 

Table III shows conditional probabilities Pr(F d = y d \ yi ,..., yd- i, x h ...,x d ) for three cases (values 
taken from our data set) to compare the conditional probabilities for the fitted parameters from the multivari¬ 
ate probit and logit models. The indexing within families is from the oldest to the youngest. In the fourth 
column, the notation for relation classes is 0 for sib-sib, 1 for parent-offspring, 2 for degree two; relations 
are given in order for pairs (1,2), (1,3), ...,(d-l,d). In the third case, the first child is a half-sib of the 
other two (degree 2 relation). 

The similarity of results for the multivariate probit and logit models here is not surprising. Joe (1997, 
Chapter 11) has examples for multivariate binary and ordinal data which show that inferences for multivari¬ 
ate probit and logit models are very similar.

5. DISCUSSION 


Liang and Beaty (1991) mention that their odds ratio regression model is a more general model and avoids 
the unobservable continuous trait of the multivariate probit model. However we have shown that the proba¬ 
bilistic assumptions behind their method are conceptually very close to that of the multivariate probit model 
with latent logistic random variables in place of latent normal random variables. 

The inferences from the two models are very similar, and we prefer the multivariate probit model because 
of the physical derivation for a polygenic effect. However, it is still useful to apply the multivariate logit 
model for a sensitivity analysis. Note that the GEE2 type of estimation equations for the multivariate probit 
model for familial data could be implemented like in Reboussin and Liang (1998). 

The approximations of Joe (1995) have made it easier to do computations for the multivariate probit 
model. Lesaffre and Molenberghs (1991) mention that lack of software for the multivariate probit model 
and provide software for bivariate probit. Molenberghs and Lesaffre (1994) mention availability of software 
for the multivariate logit model. Their software was written in GAUSS. Our software, which is written in 
C/C++, will be much faster. This is crucial for familial data with large family sizes, as the computational 
effort increases rapidly with the family size. Even with compiled programs in C/C++, the computational 
time will be of the order of minutes on fast Pentium computers if there are many families of size 6 or more.

ABSTRACT 

Cafe-au-lait spots and neurofibromas are defining features of neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), 
but they vary greatly in number, size, and clinical importance from patient to patient. The cause 
of this variability is unknown. We tested the hypotheses that development of these lesions is 
influenced by local or familial factors. 

The presence or absence of cafe-au-lait spots, cutaneous neurofibromas, and diffuse 
plexiform neurofibromas was recorded for each of ten divisions of the body surface in 547 NF1 
patients, including 117 affected individuals in 52 families. We used stratified Mantel-Haenszel 
tests to look for local associations between the presence of diffuse plexiform neurofibromas, 
cutaneous neurofibromas, and cafe-au-lait spots in individual body segments of NF1 patients. 

We used a random effects model to obtain intrafamilial correlation coefficients for the age- 
adjusted number of body divisions affected with each of the three lesions. 

No significant association was observed between the occurrence of cutaneous and diffuse 
plexiform neurofibromas, between cafe-au-lait spots and cutaneous neurofibromas, or between 
cafe-au-lait spots and plexiform neurofibromas in the same body segment. The correlation 
among relatives in the number of body segments affected with cafe-au-lait spots was 0.45 (95% 
confidence interval [Cl] = 0.18,0.71), with cutaneous neurofibromas, 0.37 (95% Cl = 0.15, 
0.55), and with plexiform neurofibromas, 0.35 (95% Cl = 0.15, 0.57). We conclude that the 
development of cafe-au-lait spots, cutaneous neurofibromas, and.plexiform neurofibromas are 
spatially independent in NF1 patients but that the development of all three lesions is influenced 
by familial factors.

INTRODUCTION 

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by 
extremely variable expressivity. Cafe-au-lait spots and neurofibromas are the de finin g features. 
Neurofibromas are complex benign tumors arising in the fascicles of peripheral nerves (Korf, 
1999). Histologically, a local increase in endoneurial matrix of the fascicle is accompanied by a 
thickened perineurium, increased size and number of Schwann cells (Harkin and Reed, 1969; 
Woodruff, 1999), and increased numbers of mast cells and fibroblasts (Giomo et al., 1989). 
Cutaneous neurofibromas are confined to a single fascicle within a nerve, while diffuse 
plexiform neurofibromas involve multiple fascicles (Burger and Scheithauer, 1994). 

Cutaneous neurofibromas begin to appear in mid-childhood and eventually develop in 
almost all NF1 patients (Friedman and Riccardi, 1999; DeBella et al., 2000). Cutaneous 
neurofibromas tend to increase in number and size with age. Some adults with NF1 have 
hundreds or thousands of these lesions; other NF1 patients develop only a few cutaneous 
neurofibromas throughout life. 

Diffuse plexiform neurofibromas are almost always, if not always, congenital (Friedman 
and Riccardi, 1999). Many are apparent on surface examination, although they often extend into 
deeper tissues. Some diffuse plexiform neurofibromas involve only deeper tissues and are not 
apparent on physical examination. Plexiform neurofibromas tend to be larger than cutaneous 
neurofibromas, sometimes involving an entire limb or other part of the body. Plexiform 
neurofibromas may give rise to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, but discrete 
cutaneous neurofibromas rarely, if ever, do. 

Cafe-au-lait spots are pigmented macules. Histologically, they contain melanocytes with 
abnormally large pigment particles (Fitzpatrick, 1981). Cafe-au-spots may be present at birth, 


Friedman et al. 


Page 4 


and by one year of age almost all children with NF1 have 6 or more of these lesions (Friedman 
and Riccardi, 1999; DeBella et al., 2000). 

The number and location of cafe-au-lait spots and neurofibromas are highly variable, 
even among NF1 patients of similar age. The cause of this variability is unknown. Here we test 
the hypotheses that the development of these lesions is influenced by local or familial factors. 


SUBJECTS AND METHODS 


Subjects. 547 NF1 patients, including 117 affected individuals in 52 families, who had 
information recorded on spatial distribution of skin lesions were available in the NF Institute 
Database (Riccardi 1992). All of these patients were evaluated by Dr. Vincent Riccardi, and all 
meet the NIH diagnostic criteria for NF1 (Gutmann et al. 1997; National Institutes of Health 
Consensus Development Conference 1988). For each patient, the presence of one or more cafe- 
au-lait spots, one or more cutaneous neurofibromas, and one or more diffuse plexiform 
neurofibromas was recorded for each of the ten divisions of the body surface shown in Figure 1. 

Analysis of local effect. We used two-layered Mantel-Haenszel tests (SPSS 1998) to look for 
local associations between the presence of diffuse plexiform neurofibromas and cutaneous 
neurofibromas in individual body segments of each NF1 patient. We stratified simultaneously 
by the body segment being considered and by the number of other body segments with one or 
more cutaneous neurofibromas (a categorical variable with range 0 to 9). This stratification was 
used to adjust for the fact that an NF1 patient who has a larger total number of body segments 



Friedman et al. 


Page 5 


with one or more neurofibromas is more likely to have at least one neurofibroma in any 
particular segment than an NF1 patient who has fewer total body segments affected. Confidence 
intervals for the summary odds ratio were obtained using a jackknife based on 20 different 
subgroups - a number that is sufficiently large to produce a stable estimate (Miller 1974). 
Homogeneity was assessed using the Breslow-Day test (SPSS 1998). Local associations 
between cafe-au-lait spots and cutaneous neurofibromas and between cafe-au-lait spots and 
plexiform neurofibromas were analyzed in the same manner. 

Skin surface area. The body divisions used in this study cover varying amounts of skin surface 
area, so we checked for an association between the surface area and the presence of one or more 
cutaneous neurofibromas in a segment. Using logistic regression, we set the segment area as the 
independent variable and the presence or absence of cutaneous neurofibromas as the dependent 
variable. We tested in a similar manner for associations between surface area and the presence 
of diffuse plexiform neurofibromas and cafe-au-lait spots in a segment. Since the median age of 
our patients was 13 years, we approximated the surface area of the body segments by using 
standard percentages for 10-14 year-old individuals (McManus and Pruitt 1996). The proportions 
of total surface area assigned to each body segment were: head = 11%, neck = 2%, right upper 
torso = 12%, left upper torso = 12%, right lower torso = 4%, left lower torso = 4%, right arm = 
9.5%, left arm = 9.5%, right leg = 18%, and left leg = 18%. 

Total number of neurofibromas. In addition to data on whether each body segment was 
affected by one or more cutaneous neurofibromas, complete counts of cutaneous neurofibromas 
were available for 44 of the patients. The total number of neurofibromas in these patients ranged 


Friedman et al. 


Page 6 


from none to several hundred and appeared to increase logarithmically with the number of 
affected segments. We used linear regression (SPSS 1998) to test the relationship between log- 
transformed counts of the total number of cutaneous neurofibromas in an individual and the 
number of body segments that included one or more cutaneous neurofibromas. Counts of the 
total number of cafe-au-lait spots were not made, and few subjects had more than one plexiform 
neurofibroma, so these variables were not analyzed in this manner. 

Familial analysis. For the familial analysis, we stratified subjects into 5-year age intervals, 
calculated the deciles for the total number of segments affected with cutaneous neurofibromas in 
each stratum, and ranked each subject by decile for the stratum in which he or she lay. We then 
used random effects models to obtain maximum likelihood estimates and confidence intervals for 
intrafamilial correlation coefficients for rank (Donner et al. 1989; Spjotvoll 1967). Cafe-au-lait 
spots and plexiform neurofibromas were analysed in the same manner. 


RESULTS 

We studied the distribution of cafe-au-lait spots, cutaneous neurofibromas, and diffuse plexiform 
neurofibromas in 10 segments of the body surface (Figure 1) in each of 547 patients with NF1. 
Two hundred eighty-one (51.4%) of the subjects were female, and 266 (48.6%) were male. Four 
hundred twenty-six (77.9%) were white, 67 (12.2%) were Hispanic, 44 (8.0%) were black and 10 
(1.8%) were of other or mixed origin. Mean age was 17.5 years, and median age was 13 years.

Lesion frequency by body segment. Table 1 shows the frequency of these lesions in each of the 
10 body segments. Two hundred ten patients had no cutaneous neurofibromas in any segment, 
and 337 patients had one or more cutaneous neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas were noted 
in 216 patients. Cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas occurred with similar frequencies in all 
ten body segments. Cafe-au-lait spots were observed in almost all patients and had similar 
frequencies in all segments except the head, where these lesions were less frequent. 

No associations between lesion types within individual body segments. Table 2 shows the ten 
body segments examined and the odds ratios for associations of each pair of lesions for each 
segment. No association was observed between the occurrence of cutaneous and diffuse 
plexiform neurofibromas in the same body segment. The summary odds ratio was 1.20 (95% 
confidence interval [Cl] = 0.81,1.79). There was no evidence for heterogeneity across body 
segments (p=0.37). 

Similarly, there was no association between the presence of cafe-au-lait spots and either 
cutaneous or diffuse plexiform neurofibromas within a single body segment. The summary odds 
ratios were 1.26 (95% Cl = 0.82, 1.93) for cafe-au-lait spots and cutaneous neurofibromas and 
1.25 (95% Cl = 0.74, 2.12) for cafe-au-lait spots and plexiform neurofibromas. There was 
significant (p=0.03) heterogeneity in the occurrence of cutaneous neurofibromas and cafe-au-lait 
spots, with a positive association seen in the neck (odds ratio=2.94; 95% Cl = 1.20, 7.20). No 
evidence of heterogeneity across body segments was found for the occurrence of plexiform 
neurofibromas and cafe-au-lait spots (p=0.52).

Log-linear relationship between segment size and number of cutaneous neurofibromas. The 

number of body segments affected with one or more cutaneous neurofibromas was strongly 
correlated with the total number of cutaneous neurofibromas in 44 NF1 patients in whom both 
total counts and data on the number of affected body segments were available (r=0.95, p<0.001). 
The relationship is log linear; the regression equation is 

Log(total number of neurofibromas +1) = 0.23*(number of segments affected) + 0.014. 

We observed no significant association between the relative size of the body surface area 
in a segment and the presence of one or more cutaneous neurofibromas (p=0.18) or of a diffuse 
plexiform neurofibroma (p=0.23). In contrast, an association was found between the presence of 
one or more cafe-au-lait spot in a body segment and its surface area expressed as a percentage of 
the body’s total (p<0.001, odds ratio = 1.030, 95% Cl = 1.015,1.046). 

All three lesions are correlated among relatives with NF1. We estimated intrafamilial 
correlations in the age-adjusted number of body segments that included one or more cafe-au-lait 
spots, one or more cutaneous neurofibromas, or one or more plexiform neurofibromas in 117 
affected members of 52 families. We found significant intrafamilial correlations for the number 
of body segments affected by each of these clinical features. The intrafamilial correlation 
coefficient for the number of body segments affected with cafe-au-lait spots was 0.45 (95% Cl = 
0.18, 0.71). The correlation among relatives with NF1 for the number of body segments affected 
with cutaneous neurofibromas was 0.37 (95% Cl = 0.15,0.55). The correlation coefficient 




Friedman et al. 


Page 9 


among relatives for the number of body segments affected with plexiform neurofibromas was 
0.35 (95% Cl = 0.15, 0.57). 

DISCUSSION 


Lesions in body segments of individual patients. The number of body segments affected by 
one or more cutaneous neurofibromas appears to provide a good measure of how severely each 
of these NF1 patients is affected by this disease feature. We found a very high correlation (r = 
0.95) between the number of body segments in which one or more cutaneous neurofibromas was 
present and the total number of cutaneous neurofibromas in 44 patients in whom counts were 
available. It seems likely that a similar relationship exists between the number of body segments 
affected with cafe-au-lait spots or plexiform neurofibromas and the severity of each of these 
disease features, but we did not have information on total counts of these lesions available to 
demonstrate this. 

We have shown previously that individuals with diffuse plexiform neurofibromas are 
more likely also to have dermal neurofibromas (Szudek et al. 2000a; Szudek et al. Submitted for 
publication-a), but this association did not take into account the location or number of these 
lesions. The current study is the first to examine this association within body divisions. Since 
almost all, if not all, diffuse plexiform neurofibromas are of congenital origin (Friedman and 
Riccardi 1999), we wanted to find out if they influence the subsequent development of cutaneous 
neurofibromas. Our findings indicate that the occurrence of cutaneous neurofibromas in NF1 
patients is not strongly influenced by the local presence of a diffuse plexiform neurofibroma. In 



Friedman et al. 


Page 10 


fact, we found that all three of the lesions studied (cafe-au-lait spots, cutaneous neurofibromas, 
and plexiform neurofibromas) occurred independently of each another in almost all of the body 
segments analyzed (Table 2). 

We found a significant association between cafe-au-lait spots and cutaneous 
neurofibromas only in the neck. One possible reason the neck might be affected by both lesions 
is recurrent minor trauma to the skin associated with flexion, extension, and rotation of the head 
(Riccardi 1990). Clearly, however, other factors are also involved in the pathogenesis of cafe-au- 
lait spots and neurofibromas, as indicated by the familial correlations we observed for the age- 
adjusted number of body segments affected by each of the three lesions studied. 

Familial correlations. The intrafamilial correlations we observed for cutaneous neurofibromas 
and cafe-au-lait spots in NF1 patients are consistent with the findings of a previous study (Easton 
et al. 1993). The number of familial patients and the prevalences of all three lesions were similar 
in these two studies. Our study found a similar correlation for cafe-au-lait spots but higher 
correlation coefficients for cutaneous neurofibromas than Easton and his associates did. We also 
found a significant familial correlation for plexiform neurofibromas. Easton et al. only analyzed 
this feature as a discrete (present/absent) trait and found no familial association. 

We have also studied the familiality of cafe-au-lait spots, cutaneous neurofibromas, and 
plexiform neurofibromas as discrete traits in an independent series of NF1 patients using 
multivariate probit regression analysis with adjustment for age and the presence of associated 
clinical features (Szudek et al. 2000b; Szudek et al. Submitted for publication-b). The results of 
that study are consistent with the current one and with the study of Easton and associates (1993) 
despite the differences in design and methodology: We again found strong intrafamilial 




Friedman et al. 


Page 11 


correlations for cafe-au-lait spots (r = 0.43, 95% Cl 0.29-0.57) and cutaneous neurofibromas (r = 
0.49, 95% Cl 0.33-0.65). Like Easton et al., we did not find a correlation for the occurrence of 
plexiform neurofibromas considered as a discrete trait when all relatives were considered, but we 
did find a significant sib-sib correlation for the occurrence of this clinical feature (r = 0.18, 95% 
Cl 0.04-0.32). These observations provide further evidence for the importance of familial factors 
in the development of cafe-au-lait spots and neurofibromas in people with NF1. 

The genetic basis for these familial associations has not been determined, but 
contributing factors may include effects of the mutant NF1 allele itself, effects of the normal 
NF1 allele, or modifying effects of other loci. The moderate magnitudes of the intrafamilial 
correlation coefficients show that familial factors alone are insufficient to predict the degree to 
which a patient will be affected by these lesions. 

Our results are consistent with the possibility that different pathogenic mechanisms are 
involved in development of the three lesions studied. Chimeric mice composed in part of 
cells develop plexiform neurofibromas but not cutaneous neurofibromas (Cichowski et al. 1999; 
Vogel et al. 1999). On the other hand, insertion of tax into the germline of mice leads to the 
development of multiple cutaneous neurofibromas but not plexiform neurofibromas 
(Feigenbaum et al. 1996). It is, therefore, clear that these two types of neurofibromas can 
develop by independent pathways, at least in mice. Some families with NF1 mutations develop 
cafe-au-lait spots but no tumours (Abeliovich et al. 1995), consistent with different pathogenic 
factors being involved in.the development of cafe-au-lait spots and neurofibromas. 

In summary, multiple factors appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of cafe-au-lait 
spots as well as of both plexiform and cutaneous neurofibromas in patients with NF1. Some of 


Friedman et al. 


Page 12 


these factors are familial, but others are not. Some pathogenic factors may be shared among 
these three lesions, but other pathogenic mechanisms appear to differ.

Appendix 2 

Outline for Yinshan Zhao's thesis (from Section 1.4 of thesis). 

Chapter 2 consists of a review of variance component models for quantitative traits (continuous 
values). This chapter provides insight in how the underlying genetic mechanism determines the 
correlation structure of familial data, and it is fundamental to the development of the chapter 
that follows. 

In Chapter 3, we discuss three different modelling approaches for familial data. We first present 
two,existing approaches which have been applied to familial data or other multivariate data: the 
first approach, to construct dependence structure, is by introducing random effects and the 
second is by using the multivariate normal copula. In this thesis we provide a comprehensive 
summary of these models under the context of familial data analysis. It also serves as a 
background for Chapter 5, in which estimating procedures are addressed. We then propose a 
family of new models called conditional independence models. In this approach, models are 
constructed based on the assumption that the trait values of two non-sibling relatives are 
independent conditional on 

their parents. This approach reduces the task of modelling a complex pedigree to modelling a 
family unit containing only the parents and their offsprings. After the general introduction of the 
models, we study some specific models for binary, count and survival responses. 

In Chapter 4, we propose a method for a binary trait to estimate intraclass and interclass odds 
ratios using relative pairs, and derived the asymptotic variance of the estimate. Asymptotic 
efficiency is compared with the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) based on a multivariate 
probit model. 

In Chapter 5, we propose two likelihood-based estimating methods. The first approach is a 
two-stage method in which univariate marginal parameters and dependence parameters are 
estimated separately based on the likelihoods of the univariate marginal distributions and 
bivariate 

marginal distributions. In the second approach, all the parameters are estimated simultaneously 
based on the likelihoods of the bivariate marginal distributions. Both methods yield 
asymptotically consistent parameter estimates. In Chapter 6, we investigate the performance of 
the two methods. The asymptotic efficiency of the estimates were compared with the MLEs when 
the latter can be obtained. Our results show that the two-stage method can be inefficient with the 
covariate coefficients when the correlation is strong. 

In Chapter 7, the models and inferential approaches studied in the previous chapters are applied 
to datasets of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 or type 2. In Chapter 8, the final chapter, we 
discuss some future research topics related to this thesis.

Excerpt from summary section on estimation methods from Zhao's thesis. 


Estimating Procedures and Efficiency Comparison 

The major difficulty in implementing models with multinormal random effects and multivariate 
normal (MVN) copula models is parameter estimation when the family size exceeds 4. The MLE 
is generally computationally difficult to obtain since it involves high dimensional integration. 
Therefore, developing estimating procedures that are less computationally demanding is 
important. 

The models we mentioned share a common feature: the parameters which specify the models can 
be classified as univariate marginal parameters and dependence parameters, the former 
characterizes the univariate margins, such as the means and variances in the MVN model, while 
the latter, joint with the univariate marginal parameters, fully specifies the features of multivariate 
law, such as the correlations in the MVN model. This feature allows us to form likelihood type 
estimation methods based on the univariate and bivariate marginal distributions. Such estimation 
methods are called composite likelihood (CL) methods by Lindsay (1988). We considered two 
such approaches for familial data: the first is based on both CL of the univariate margins and 
bivariate margins and estimate the marginal parameters and the dependent parameters in two steps 
while the second only uses the bivariate CL and estimates the parameters simultaneously. 
Weighting schemes are also considered to improve the efficiency. 

In this section, we first introduce the general properties of estimating procedures based on 
composite likelihood, then present the two approaches mentioned above followed by methods to 
estimate the covariance matrix of the estimates from CL methods. Finally, we give a summary of 
the results of some efficiency comparisons. 

General Properties 

A composite likelihood (CL), sometimes called pseudo-likelihood, is formed by adding together 
individual component log likelihoods, each of which is a log likelihood of a marginal distribution 
of a multivariate model (Lindsay, 1988). CL is appealing for the following reasons: Firstly, it 
inherits some properties of the ordinary likelihood. Under regularity conditions, the estimates 
based on CL are asymptotically consistent and unbiased. Secondly, the estimates are much easier 
to compute under many circumstances compared to the ML estimates. 

The standard theory for inference functions (Godambe, 1991) can be applied to derive the 
asymptotic properties of estimators.

A Two-stage Estimating Procedure 

[Mathematics not included, original written in LaTeX] 

The next question is that how well this method performs when the data are correlated. Our 
investigation shows that it can be inefficient comparing with the MLE when the data are highly 
correlated. To improve the efficiency, we also considered adding weights to the estimating 
functions. 

Estimating Approach Based on Bivariate Composite Likelihood (BCD 
[Mathematics not included, original written in LaTeX] 

Methods to Estimate the Asymptotic Covariance Matrix 

Different methods can be considered to estimate the asymptotic covariance matrix of the 
parameter estimate. 

(a) Evaluate the Godambe information matrix analytically. This method can be computationally 
expensive or even not be possible sometimes. For example, with survival data, the matrix cannot 
be evaluated without specifying the censoring distribution. 

(b) Use resampling methods such as jackknife (Xu, 1996) or bootstrapping. Naturally, the 
sampling uint is family. 

(c) Evaluate the Godambe information matrix empirically or using resampling techniques. 
Efficiency 


In this section, we compare the efficiency of the CLEs with the MLE in terms of asymptotic 
variances. 

Since it is impossible to conduct the efficiency comparison analytically for all models in general, 
our investigation was carried out on four different types of models: multivariate normal (MVN), 
multivariate probit (MVP) and Poisson log-normal mixture (PLNM) and MVN with right 
censoring. 

For MVN and MVP, var(theta_MLE) and var(theta_CL) are derived from the inverse Fisher and 
Godambe information matrices respectively. Different dependence structures are considered, 
including structures with one dependence parameter (exchangeable), with two dependence 
parameters (parent-offspring and sib-sib correlations in a type-3 family) and with three 
dependence parameters (parent-offspring, sib-sib and parent-parent correlations in a type-4 
family). 


56 


For PLNM and MVN with right censoring, simulation studies were carried out. Only 
exchangeable dependence structure is considered. 

From different models and different dependence structures, we obtained similar results. The 
following is a summary of the main points. 

Among univariate marginal parameters, we separate the regression parameters from the other 
parameters. 

(a) Regression parameters: the two-stage method is easily affected by the following factors. (1) 
dependency: it tends to lose more efficiency when dependence becomes stronger. The efficiency 
can be 0 in certain cases. (2) data type: there is more efficiency loss for continuous responses 
than discrete responses. (3) censoring rate: when right censoring occurs, there is less efficiency 
loss when the censoring rate increases. (4) family size: the efficiency decreases with the average 
family size. The BCL method is less affected by the above factors. It is generally better than the 
two-stage method and the efficiency of the BCL estimate is close to 1 most of the time. 

(b) Other univariate parameters: both methods are reasonable. 

(c) Dependence parameters: the BCL method is often better for stronger dependence, the 
two-stage method is better for weaker dependence. 

(d) Effect of family size: the efficiency is negatively associated with the mean and relative 
dispersion of family size (measured by the variance-mean ratio). 

Some final words about these two approaches. They are not limited to familial data. We can apply 
them to other correlated data. We recommend the BCL method when the dependency is strong. It 
provides better overall estimation of the parameters, especially the regression parameters. 
However, it is numerically harder to implement since numerical optimization gets harder as the 
total number of parameters increases. Therefore we recommend the two-stage method when the 
dependency is weaker.

Phylogenetic Footprinting of the NF1 5” Upstream Region (5UR). 

Lee, Bernard 

(Abstract accepted for publication at 2003 American Society of Human Genetics) 

The 5UR of the human neurofibromatosis 1 gene was defined as the 59756 bp region 
between the NF1 translation start site and the end of the first upstream GenScan prediction 
(NT 010799.114). The 5URs of mouse and rat were defined as 59756 bp upstream of the 
translation start site of the NF1 homologs in these species. The 5UR in Fugu was defined as the 
1488 bp segment between the known 5” flanking gene (FN5) and the NF1 translation start site. 
Sequence alignments were established by mVista, and windows of identity greater than that of the 
coding regions and extending 50 bp or more in length among all 3 mammalian species were 
identified with Frameslider, a Perl program written for this research. These highly homologous 
regions (HHRs) were compared to the Fugu 5UR using Pairwise BLAST and analyzed for 
potential transcription factor binding sites and other promoter-associated sequences with 
MATCH, Matlnspector, Eurkaryotic Promoter Database and TRRD. 

Three HHRs were discovered in the NF1 5UR. HHR1, located 42626-42696 bp upstream of 
translation start site, contains an AP-1 site shared by all four species. HHR2, located 640-689 bp 
upstream of translation start site, has no promising predictions for recognized transcription factor 
binding sites. HHR3, located 233-519 bp upstream of the NF1 translation start site, contains a 
previously-described CREB site that is shared by all three mammalian species. 

HHR3 also includes a 24 bp sequence 310-333 bp upstream of the translation start that is identical 
in human, mouse and rat and differs by onlyl bp in Fugu. Bioinformatic analysis and correlation 
with previously-published in vitro transcription studies indicate that this sequence, which we call 
NF1 Highly Conserved Sequence (NF1HCS), is likely to be involved in transcriptional regulation. 
NF1HCS lies 151bp downstream from the NF1 major transcriptional start site but appears to be a 
strong candidate for the NF1 core promoter element despite its position further downstream than 
any previously-described eukaryotic downstream core promoter element.

It has been hypothesized that the location of constitutional NF2 splice-site mutations is associated 
with NF2 disease severity (Am J Med Genet 1998;77:228-233). The purpose of this study was to 
evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations for the location of splice-site NF2 mutations. The 
study had 199 patients from 85 families with splice-site mutations in an international NF2 
database (splice-sites flanking exons 1 and 9 were not included in the analysis because there were 
no mutations flanking exon 1 and only one mutation flanking exon 9). A gamma mixture of 
negative binomials model with an exchangeable correlation within families was used to model the 
association of the number of intracranial meningiomas with the location of splice-site mutations; 
the other covariate was inheritance (people with new mutations/ inherited cases). The locations 
of splice-site mutations were categorized by their correspondence to domains in the NF2 protein: 
mutations flanking exons 2-8 (FERM domain) or exons 10-15 (a-helical domain). The mean + 
SD number of meningiomas in people with mutations flanking exons 2-8 was 1.3 + 2.0, and in 
people with mutations flanking exons 10-15, 0.4 + 0.8. Within exons 2-8, the number of 
meningiomas in people with splice-site mutations flanking exons 2-5 was 2.0 + 2.4, and in people 
with mutations flanking exons 6-8, 0.8 ±1.3. These results indicate that there is a decreasing 5 
to 3 gradient for the number of meningiomas in people with splice-site NF2 mutations.

Genotype-phenotype correlations are well-established for central nervous system tumors in 
neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), but such correlations have not been established for non-tumor 
manifestations of the disease, such as presenile cataracts. The purpose of this study was to 
evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations for cataracts in NF2. The study had 255 people from 
190 families in the United Kingdom NF2 registry who were screened for consitutional NF2 
mutations using SSCP and examined for cataracts (posterior subcapsular or cortical) using 
slitlamp biomicroscopy. There were 90 people with nonsense or frameshift mutations (including 
17 somatic mosaics defined at the molecular level), 47 with splice-site mutations, 15 with 
missense mutations, 25 with large deletions, and 78 with unidentified mutations. A multivariate 
probit model with an exchangeable correlation structure within families was used to estimate 
regression coefficients and calculate relative risks (RR) and confidence intervals (Cl) for presence 
of cataracts. The RR of cataracts was nearly constant with increasing age at diagnosis of NF2, 
probably because the study population was relatively young. People with classical NF2 and 
nonsense or frameshift mutations were the reference group in comparisons between different 
types of NF2 mutations; the prevalence of cataracts was lower in people with each other type of 
NF2 mutation. The RR of cataracts was significantly lower in somatic mosaics (RR = 0.15, 95% 
Cl = 0.04 - 0.51), in people with large deletions (RR = 0.39, 99% Cl = 0.16 - 0.98), and in people 
with new unfound mutations and older onset of symptoms (ages > 20 years), who are likely to 
have somatic mosaicism or large deletions (RR = 0.07, 95% Cl = 0.01 - 0.35). These results 
extend the genotype-phenotype correlations that have been reported for the tumor manifestations 
of NF2.

Genetics, St. Mary’s Hospital, Manchester, U.K. 

Genotype-phenotype correlations have not been established for spinal tumors in neurofibromatosis 
2 (NF2), although there is suggestive evidence (Radiology 2001;218:434-442). The purpose of 
this study was to evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations for spinal tumors in NF2. The study 
had 336 people from 229 families in the United Kingdom NF2 registry who were screened for 
constitutional NF2 mutations using SSCP and had full spine MRI scans. There were 111 people 
with nonsense or ffameshift mutations (including 19 somatic mosaics defined at the molecular 
level), 63 with splice-site mutations, 24 with missense mutations, 41 with large deletions, and 97 
with unidentified mutations. A gamma mixture of negative binomials model with an exchangeable 
correlation within families was used to model the association of the number of spinal tumors with 
the type of constitutional NF2 mutation; the other covariates were age at spinal MRI scan and 
type of treatment center (specialty or non-specialty). People with classical NF2 and nonsense or 
ffameshift mutations were the reference group in comparisons between different types of NF2 
mutations (mean ± SD number of spinal tumors, 7.9 ± 12.2); the number of spinal tumors was 
lower in people with each other type of NF2 mutation. The number of spinal tumors was 
significantly lower in people with large deletions (1.1 + 2.0) and missense mutations (1.8 + 2.7). 

In a subset of 160 patients from 125 families who also had data on the number of intramedullary 
tumors, there were not genotype-phenotype correlations for these tumors, which are much less 
common than intradural extramedullary tumors (overall, 0.3 + 0.6 tumors and 4.0 + 7.9 tumors). 
These results indicate that there are genotype-phenotype correlations for intradural 
extramedullary spinal tumors in NF2.

Studies of several large neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) patient populations have found that the 
prevalence of peripheral nerve tumors is associated with broad categories of NF2 disease severity, 
but genotype-phenotype correlations have not been established. The purpose of this study was to 
evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations for peripheral nerve tumors in NF2. The study had 328 
people from 229 families in the United Kingdom NF2 registry who were screened for 
constitutional NF2 mutations using SSCP and had information on the number of peripheral nerve 
tumors. There were 111 people with nonsense or frameshift mutations (including 17 somatic 
mosaics defined at the molecular level), 60 with splice-site mutations, 25 with missense mutations, 
34 with large deletions, and 98 with unidentified mutations. A gamma mixture of negative 
binomials model with an exchangeable correlation within families was used to model the 
association of the number of peripheral nerve tumors with the type of constitutional NF2 
mutation. People with classical NF2 and constitutional nonsense or frameshift NF2 mutations 
were the reference group in comparisons between different types of NF2 mutations (mean + SD 
number of peripheral nerve tumors, 3.7 + 5.0). The number of peripheral nerve tumors was 
significantly lower in people with each other type of NF2 mutation: splice-site mutations (1.2 + 
1.8), missense mutations (1.4 ± 3.9), large deletions (1.6 + 2.0), somatic mosaics (1.3 + 2.5), and 
in people with new unfound mutations and older onset of symptoms (ages > 20 years), who are 
likely to have somatic mosaicism or large deletions (1.5 + 2.5). These results extend the 
genotype-phenotype correlations that have been reported for central nervous system tumors in 
NF2.

neurofibromatosis 2. 53 rd Annual Meeting, American Society of Human Genetics, 4-8 November 
2003, Los Angeles (CA). Accepted. 

We reported that each of the four sets of clinical diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) 
had low sensitivity at the time of the initial assessment (Neurology 2002;59:1579-1565). The 
purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which modifications to the Manchester 
diagnostic criteria increased sensitivity. The study had 221 NF2 patients in the United Kingdom 
NF2 registry who presented without bilateral vestibular schwannomas (155 people who did not 
have a family history of NF2 at initial assessment and 66 inherited cases). The modifications 
were: (1) in people without a family history of NF2, permitting the diagnosis when there are 
multiple meningiomas and only one, instead of two, other tumors or cataract (as in the NNFF 
criteria); in people with a l 8t degree relative with NF2, permitting the diagnosis when there is only 
one, instead of two, tumors or cataract (as in the 1991 NIH criteria), but restricting 1 st degree 
relatives to parents, (2) adding juvenile mononeuropathy (< 15 years) as a diagnostic criterion, (3) 
in addition to clinical criteria, permitting the diagnosis when constitutional NF2 mutations are 
identified. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to determine the time course, from initial assessment 
to the most recent clinical evaluation, of the increasing proportion of people who would be 
diagnosed with NF2 using the Manchester criteria and the three modifications; the jackknife 
method was used to compute pointwise standard errors for differences in proportions of pairwise 
Kaplan-Meier curves between different sets of criteria. In people without a family history of NF2 
at initial assessment (the most difficult group to diagnose), sensitivity was increased by 
incorporating features of the 1991 NIH criteria and the NNFF criteria (modification 1 above). 

The modified Manchester criteria were significantly more sensitive than the original Manchester 
criteria from four years after initial assessment to 17 years after initial assessment. In inherited 
cases, sensitivity was further increased by adding mononeuropathy as a diagnostic criterion and 
incorporating the positive results of mutation analysis. These results indicate that, in NF2 paients 
who present without bilateral vestibular schwannomas, modifications to the Manchester criteria 
can increase diagnostic sensitivity, although not at the time of the initial assessment.
