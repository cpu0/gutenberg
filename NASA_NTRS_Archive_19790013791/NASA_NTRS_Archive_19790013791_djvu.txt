VISCOSITY AND THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY 
OF MODEL JUPITER ATMOSPHERES 
C. Frederick Hansen

SUMMARY 


The viscosity and thermal conductivity coefficients are estimated for 
three models of the atmosphere of Jupiter: a Heavy Model consisting of 22% 

helium and 78% hydrogen, a Nominal Model consisting of 11% helium and 89% 
hydrogen, and a Light Model consisting of pure hydrogen. The effect of trace 
elements is neglected. Linearized approximations are used for the transport 
coefficients of the mixtures; these are found to be in almost constant ratio 
to the values for pure hydrogen, independent of temperature. Short basic 
language programs for computing the coefficients are listed. 


INTRODUCTION 


The Jovian atmosphere is presently thought to consist mainly of molecu- 
lar hydrogen, H 2 , perhaps mixed with helium. He, and with traces of methane, 

CH4, and ammonia, NH3. The amount of He seems to be the most uncertain; esti- 
mates range from about 11% by volume for the Nominal Jovian Atmosphere Model, 
to 22% for the Heavy Models, and to 0.0% for the Light Models. The traces of 
methane are thought to be about 0.1% and of ammonia about 0.02%; these are 
significant amounts as far as radiation absorption and emissivity are con- 
cerned , but are trivial amounts as far as thermodynamic and transport proper- 
ties of the atmosphere are concerned. The temperature range of interest is 
from 100 to 1000 K. The thermodynamic properties needed for Jupiter probe < 

design have been previously calculated and tabulated for this range 
(J. Sperans, Ames Research Center, NASA, private communication). Recently, a 
need has appeared for estimates of viscosity and thermal conductivity of the 
Jovian atmosphere, in connection with the subsonic motion of bodies through 
that atmosphere. The present report gives estimates of these quantities based 
on linearized formulas for the transport properties of mixtures and neglecting 
the effect of traces of CH4 and NH3. 


VISCOSITY OF MODEL JUPITER ATMOSPHERES 


Viscosity of Mixtures 

According to rigorous kinetic theory, the coefficient of viscosity of a 
multicomponent gas mixture should be expressed as a ratio of determinants.

Buddenberg and Wilke (ref. 3) empirically find that agreement with exper- 
imental measurements of viscosities of many gas mixtures is improved if each 
term in the summation of equation (10) is multiplied by 0.69; presumably, this 
correction accounts for the deviation of A lk from the 5/3 value assumed. 
Accordingly, the formula used for the calculations of the viscosity of the 
Jupiter atmosphere is

and by Keyes (ref. 7) are 
shown In figure 1. The 
parameters of equation (14) 
were chosen to give the 
best fit to Hilsenrath's 
values from 100 to 300 K 
and to Watson's values 
from 300 to 1000 K. The 
latter are expected to be 
the most reliable in that 
range since they have been 
carefully fitted to the 
most recent and most care- 
fully calibrated experimen- 
tal data. Hilsenrath's 
values are based on collision 
integrals calculated using 
a Lennard-Jones 6-12 poten- 
tial, with the force param- 
eters of the potential fitted 
to older viscosity measure- 
ments; these are expected to 
be the best values in the 
low-temperature range. It 
can be seen that the devi- 
ations of equation (14) are 
generally well within 1% of 
the best values. Even the 
old formula given by Keyes 
for the range of 100 to 500 K 
agrees within 3%,

Watson are considered to be 
the best in the range from 
300 + 1000 K. The formula has 
been fitted to these values 
and to the 100 K value of 
Kestin and Leidenfrost. The 
deviations from Watson's 
values are generally less than 
0.5%; in the low-temperature 
range, where the formula 
bisects the values of Kestin

Viscosity of Jovian Atmospheres 

The viscosity of model Jovirn atmosphere mixtures is shown as a function 
of temperature in table 1 for the temperature range from 100 to 1000 K. The 
first column is the temperature; the second column is the viscosity of pure 
H 2 (which corresponds to both the Cool Light Model and Warm Light Model of the 
Jovian Atmosphere) ; the third column is the viscosity of an 89% H 2 - 11% He 
mixture (which corresponds to the Nominal Jovian Atmosphere Model) ; and the

sphere). The Cool and Warm Models have only a different altitude dependence

Is almost exactly 25% greater than the viscosity of pure H 2 . The ratio of 
the two is almost Independent of temperature. Similarly, the viscosity of ';he 
Heavy Atmosphere Models (with 22% He) Is almost exactly 47% greater than the 
viscosity of pure

THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF JUPITER ATMOSPHERES 


Thermal Conductivity of Mixtures 

Theoretical expressions for thermal conductivity of gases and of gas mix- 
tures have not been verified with the same accuracy as for viscosities. This 
occurs partly because a number of intricate corrections are involved in making 
measurements, and also because the heat transfer associated with interna.' 
modes of molecular energy is difficult to treat with the same rigor as that 
associated with the kinetic modes of energy. In the simple Eucken appro: i- 
mation, the internal degrees of freedom are assumed to have a Maxwe’l dipt* 
butlon that is totally independent of the molecule’s velocity. r ' u is : 
tainly a good approximation for the stiff vibrational mod*»f : Az 

molecule at the temperatures of interest, where there little coupling 

between vibrational and kinetic modes during a collisit.. perturbation; 
however, the same may not be exactly true for the rotational modes of the H 2 
molecule. Nevertheless, the Eucken approximation seems to agree just as well 
with experimental data as the more elaborate theoretical models that have been 
devised; consequently, it will be used here in view of its simplicity and the 
fact that the comparist us between experiment and the theoretical model seem 
adequate to the order of accuracy being considered. 

The coefficient of thermal conductivity of a pure gas can be expressed 
with the Eucken approximation 


* ■ I £ ir (I c v + v) < 20 > 

where M is the gram molecular weight, C v is the specific heat per mole of 
the gas associated with its kinetic energy, and C v * is the specific heat 
associated with internal molecular energy. For a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribu- 
tion of velocities, the kinetic specific heat is just 3/2 times the gas

Undoubtedly, an empirical correction term, such as that provided by

CONCLUDING REMARKS 


The approximations used in estimating the viscosity of Jovian atmosphere 
mixtures are believed reliable within a few percent. The approximations used 
in estimating the thermal conductivities of Jovian atmosphere mixtures hold 
uncertainties of the order of 10 to 15%. In both cases , the mixture trans- 
port coefficients are almost a constant factor times the value for pure 
independent of temperature. This permits a quick, easy method of evaluating 
the appropriate values for the mixtures. 

The transport coefficients included here are appropriate only for sub- 
sonic flow fields in the Jovian atmosphere. At high supersonic speeds, the % 
dissociates and both the He and H atoms are electronically excited and ionized 
in flow following strong shock waves and in boundary-layer flow. In this 
case, the dissociation and ionization reactions promote very large peaks in 
the thermal conductivity over the range of pressures and temperatures where 
the reaction rates are significant. The ionization of the species also 
decreases viscosity by an order of magnitude or more, because the long-range 
coulomb forces prevent long mean-free-path momentum transfer in the gas. The 
characteristic dissociation temperature of H 2 (that is, the ratio of dissocia- 
tion energy U to the Boltzmann constant k) is 51,965 K, and the characteristic 
electronic excitation and ionization temperatures are several times larger. 
These reactions will not become Important until temperatures are of the order 
of 0.1 the characteristic temperature. In other words, the mixture formulas 
used here could be applied to temperatures of several thousand degrees. 

However, in such a case, the simple formulas used for the viscosities and 
thermal conductivities of the pure H 2 and He would have to be modified; they 
were designed only to apply in the range from 100 to 1000 K. 

Tables 5 and 6 are printouts of the BASIC language programs that have 
been used to calculate the coefficients of viscosity and thermal conductivity 
of H 2 “ He mixtures. In the future, we may well find that other mixtures are 
appropriate for the Jovian atmosphere, in which case the appropriate values of 
the mole fractions xj (of H 2 ) and X 2 (of He) can be introduced as input to
