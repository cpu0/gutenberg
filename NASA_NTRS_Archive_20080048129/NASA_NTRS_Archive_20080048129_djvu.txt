® Processing LiDAR Data To Predict Natural Hazards 

Stennis Space Center, Mississippi 


ELF-Base and ELF-Hazards (wherein 
“ELF” signifies “Extract LiDAR Features” 
and “LiDAR” signifies “light detection 
and ranging”) are developmental soft- 
ware modules for processing remote- 
sensing LiDAR data to identify past nat- 
ural hazards (principally, landslides) 
and predict future ones. ELF-Base 
processes raw LiDAR data, including 
LiDAR intensity data that are often ig- 
nored in other software, to create digital 
terrain models (DTMs) and digital fea- 
ture models (DFMs) with sub-meter ac- 
curacy. 

ELF-Hazards fuses raw LiDAR data, 
data from multispectral and hyperspec- 
tral optical images, and DTMs and 
DFMs generated by ELF-Base to gener- 
ate hazard risk maps. Advanced algo- 


rithms in these software modules in- 
clude line-enhancement and edge-de- 
tection algorithms, surface-characteriza- 
tion algorithms, and algorithms that 
implement innovative data-fusion tech- 
niques. The line-extraction and edge- 
detection algorithms enable users to lo- 
cate such features as faults and landslide 
headwall scarps. 

Also implemented in this software are 
improved methodologies for identifica- 
tion and mapping of past landslide 
events by use of (1) accurate, ELF-de- 
rived surface characterizations and (2) 
three LiDAR/ optical-data-fusion tech- 
niques: post-classification data fusion, 
maximum-likelihood estimation model- 
ing, and hierarchical within-class dis- 
crimination. This software is expected to 


enable faster, more accurate forecasting 
of natural hazards than has previously 
been possible.

COCOMOST is a computer 
program for use in estimating 
software development costs. 

The goal in the development 
of COCOMOST was to in- 
crease estimation accuracy in 
three ways: (1) develop a set of 
sensitivity software tools that 
return not only estimates of 
costs but also the estimation 
error; (2) using the sensitivity 
software tools, precisely define 
the quantities of data needed 
to adequately tune cost estima- 
tion models; and (3) build a 
repository of software-cost-esti- 
mation information that NASA 
managers can retrieve to im- 
prove the estimates of costs of 
developing software for their 
project (see figure). 

COCOMOST implements a 
methodology, called “2cee,” in 
which a unique combination of 
well-known pre-existing data- 
mining and software-develop- 
ment-effort-estimation techniques are 
used to increase the accuracy of esti- 
mates. COCOMOST utilizes multiple 
models to analyze historical data per- 
taining to software-development proj- 
ects and performs an exhaustive data- 
mining search over the space of model 
parameters to improve the perform- 


ances of effort-estimation models. 
Thus, it is possible to both calibrate and 
generate estimates at the same time. 
COCOMOST is written in the C lan- 
guage for execution in the UNIX oper- 
ating system.

and Dan Baker of West Virginia University 


and Jairus Hihn and Karen Lum of Caltech 
for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Fur- 
ther information is contained in a TSP (see

censing. Please contact Karina Edmonds of
