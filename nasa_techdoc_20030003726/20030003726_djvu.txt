Abstract 
This paper presents the results of a thermodynamic 
cycle analysis of a pulse detonation engine (PDE) using 
a hydrogen-air mixture at static conditions. The cycle 
performance results, namely the specific thrust, fuel 
consumption and impulse are compared to a single 
cycle CFD analysis for a detonation tube which 
considers finite rate chemistry. The differences in the 
impulse values were indicative of the additional 
performance potential attainable in a PDE. 

Introduction 
Previous studies have demonstrated the impact of 
dissociation in propulsion engines. 1 A significant 
reduction in the sensible heat release available for 
conversion into thrust occurs due the to high 
temperature dissociation of the burning gases. A 
subsequent analysis 2 was performed in which the 
specific thrust, fuel consumption and impulse were 
compared for a ramjet, a gas turbine and a PDE. In that 
study, it was found that a PDE has comparable 
performance with a ramjet over a wide Mach number 
range. In comparison with a turbojet the PDE was 
found to be competitive only when the turbojet was 
operated with a low mechanical compression ratio. 
More recently, a single cycle CFD analysis was 
performed for a detonation tube, 3 which included finite 
rate chemistry modeling. 

It was found that some recombination took place in the 
burning gases behind the detonation front. 3 The 
recombination served to decrease the amount of 



sensible heat loss that occurred during the detonation 
process due to dissociation 

This paper examines the effect of the real gas 
chemistry, using a combination of the single cycle CFD 
and the thermodynamic cycle calculations for 
hydrogen/air mixtures. The results are used to establish 
the actual performance of a PDE versus the maximum 
performance potential. 

Analyses 

Thermodynamic Cycle 

The thermo cycle analysis used was that developed by 
Heiser and Pratt 4 and modified in reference 2 for 
variable gamma and specific heat ratio and for variable 
reference conditions. The analysis is a classical closed 
cycle analysis that is independent of time. The 
significant parameters of the analysis are the thermal 
efficiency and the sensible heat release, which can be 
converted into thrust. Those values can be used to 
calculate all of the usual performance parameters, such 
as specific thrust, fuel consumption and impulse. In this 
manner, the maximum performance capability for a 
pulse detonation engine can be established. 

In order to perform the cycle analysis, it is necessary to 
specify the heat release occurring during the 
detonation/combustion process. The usual practice has 
been to assume that the lower heating value of the fuel 
is a reasonable value to use. As mentioned in the 
Introduction, the real gas effects such as dissociation 
and recombination cause the sensible heat release to be

less than the lower heating value of the fuel. 1 The 
decrease in heat release turns out to be a function of 
equivalence ratio, pressure and temperature as well as 
fuel type. 

In this study, the sensible heat release during the 
detonation/combustion process was determined in two 
ways; the first being the value calculated from the CEA 
equilibrium code 5 and the second being the heat 
released based on finite rate reactions from the CFD 
code discussed in the next section. Unlike the 
equilibrium value, the finite rate heat release accounts 
for recombination and yields a higher heat release 
value. 

The two values of the heat release were used in the 
cycle code to determine the specific thrust, fuel 
consumption and impulse for a hydrogen/air mixture at 
standard pressure and temperature. The equivalence 
ratios investigated were 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.15. The 
results consisted of two values of each of the 
performance parameters, one based on the equilibrium 
heat release and the other on the finite rate heat release. 

The propulsion performance parameters were then 
interpreted under the premise that the equilibrium heat 
release did not reflect the influence of recombination on 
heat release and hence, yields a lower than maximum 
performance for the PDE. On the other hand, the finite 
rate heat release, which properly accounts for both 
dissociation and recombination, will yield the upper 
limit of performance potential for a PDE cycle. 

CFD Analysis 

The CFD analysis used was developed by Yungster and 
Radhakrishnan. ~ The code solves the axisymmetric 
Navier Stokes equations including finite rate chemistry 
and real gas effects using an implicit, total- variation 
diminishing (TVD) algorithm. The code includes a 
generalized detailed chemistry capability, various 
options for turbulence models, and steady state or time 
accurate marching algorithms. For this study, the 
viscous forces were not included and, therefore the 
Euler equations were actually used to perform single 
cycle calculations. 

The numerical method used for solving the governing 
equations is described in detail in reference 6. Briefly, 
the equation set is discretized using a fully implicit, 
first order time accurate, variable-step backward 
differentiation formula method. The numerical fluxes 
are discretized using a second order spatially accurate 
TVD scheme. The resulting equations are then 
linearized in a conservative manner and solved 
iteratively, by using a lower-upper relaxation procedure 



consisting of successive Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS) 
sweeps. 

The chemical reaction mechanism for hydrogen-air 
combustion was based on Jachimowski's model and 
consists of 27 elementary reactions among 12 species. 
The inversion of large matrices is avoided by 
partitioning the system into reacting and non-reacting 
parts. Consequently, the matrices that have to be 
inverted are of the same size as those that arise in the 
commonly used point implicit methods. An important 
advantage of the present method is that it is stable for 
large CLF values, thereby enabling the use of large time 
steps to minimize computational cost. 

In order to maintain good resolution of the detonation 
front at all times a multi-level, dynamically adaptive 
grid was used in which a very fine sub -grid 
continuously slides along with the detonation wave 
front. This approach avoided the use of thousands of 
grid points. 

The CFD finite rate calculations were used to compute 
the species evolution and the resulting thrust and 
impulse. They were also used to determine the sensible 
heat release occurring during the detonation and 
combustion processes for the hydrogen-air mixtures at 
the same equivalence ratios used in the thermo cycle 
analyses. 

Comparative Analysis 

The comparison of the cycle code and the CFD 
calculations was carried out as shown in figure 1 . The 
cycle analysis used the sensible heat release determined 
from EQL to calculate the performance parameters and 
then used the finite rate value from the CFD to yield a 
second set of values. It is the second set, which is based 
on the finite rate heat release, that are believed to yield 
the maximum performance (upper cycle) limits for a 
PDE. 

In the CFD analysis, detonation is initiated in a one 
meter length tube with a diameter of 6.6 centimeters 
using a 2 cm zone of high temperature nitrogen at 
2500K and 40 bar. The tube is filled with hydrogen/air 
at 298K and 1 bar. This starting transient is neglected in 
the "ignition corrected" values of performance, 
whereas, in the "uncorrected results," the transient was 
included. This correction is justified on the basis of the 
need to introduce an ignition mechanism to obtain 
detonation, which creates an artificial force that is not 
representative of the actual ignition process 3 . The 
resulting values of the corrected parameters are 
believed to be representative of the flow geometry 
being analyzed. Figure 2 (from ref. 3) shows the result 



NASA/TM— 2002-2 1 1 698

of the ignition correction. Further efforts are underway 
to reduce the size of the ignition source and the 
corresponding correction required. 

System Analyzed 

For the thermodynamic cycle , it is assumed that the 
inlet has no losses and operates in an isentropic manner. 
The pressure and temperature are at standard conditions 
for this example. There is no ram pressure since the 
forward velocity is zero, i.e. static thrust conditions. 
The nozzle, which may be of any shape, is also 
assumed to be isentropic, yielding the maximum thrust 
for the operating conditions of the detonation chamber. 
Although a nozzle geometry having this characteristic 
is unknown at this time, it is not required for a cycle 
calculation, which seeks the upper performance 
capability of a PDE. 

For the CFD analysis , the inlet again is assumed to have 
no losses. Admission of fuel and air occurs with no 
entropy generation. In fact, for the analysis, it is 
assumed that the detonation chamber is closed at the 
front end for the single cycle being analyzed. 

However, in order to perform the CFD analysis a 
description of the geometry at the downstream end is 
required. In the absence of any specific design, it is 
assumed that the detonation chamber is open at the 
downstream end and has a constant diameter 
throughout and discharges to an ambient pressure of 
1 bar. In this case, the CFD analysis, with the proper 
boundary conditions, should yield the "actual" 
performance for that geometry subject to the 
approximations in the solved equations, including the 
neglect of viscous effects. The term "actual" in this case 
refers to the fact that the expansion process is not 
isentropic. Hence, the difference between the thermo 
cycle analysis and the CFD will be due to the non- 
isentropic nozzle expansion losses and some frictional 
effects. 

The analyzed geometry, therefore, is as shown in 
figure 3 . 

Results 

Sensible Heat Release 

The heat releases calculated using the equilibrium code 
of Gordon and McBride, 5 and the finite rate CFD 
chemistry model are shown in figure 4. The differences 
in the two curves are due to the recombination that 
occurs as the heated gases burn and flow out of the 
detonation tube. As the gases recombine, additional 
heat is released. 



The loss in sensible heat is found to be much larger at 
the higher equivalence ratios and is primarily due to the 
higher detonation temperatures reached. For an 
equivalence ratio of 0.6, the detonation temperature is 
2422K and for a value of 1.15, the temperature reaches 
2967K. 

Thermo Cycle and CFD Analyses 

Using the above variation of heat release values, the 
thermo cycle code yields the fuel specific impulse 
results shown in figure 5. As noted previously, the 
higher sensible heat associated with finite rate 
chemistry lead to higher values of impulse than those 
associated with equilibrium chemistry. 

It is the performance associated with the finite rate 
results that are interpreted as the upper limit of PDE 
propulsion performance. 

The ignition corrected results from the CFD analysis 
are shown in figure 6. As stated previously, the 
artificial force created by the ignition effect is not 
considered representative of the actual ignition process, 
and the resulting values of the ignition corrected values 
are believed to be accurate for the flow geometry being 
analyzed. 

As stated in the Analyses section under 
Thermodynamic Cycle, the interpretation of the results 
is that the equilibrium heat release does not reflect the 
influence of recombination on heat release and hence, 
yields a lower than maximum performance for the PDE. 
On the other hand, use of the finite heat release in the 
thermo cycle, which correctly accounts for both 
dissociation and recombination, yields the upper cycle 
limit for the propulsion performance of a PDE cycle. 

Plotting the thermo cycle finite rate result from figure 5 
and the CFD ignition corrected finite rate results from 
figure 6 yields the plot shown in figure 7. 

The differences in the two curves of figure 7 represent 
the losses principally incurred by the open-ended 
detonation tube and the nature of the non-isentropic 
expansion. The losses are on the order of 5 percent 
(250 seconds) of the impulse. 

It is interesting to observe that the ratio of the impulse 
values from the CFD to the impulse value of the thermo 
cycle calculations, (Icfd/I thermo), have values from 
0.94 to 0.95. It is informative, therefore, to look at the 
values determined by the cycle analysis using a nozzle 
efficiency of 0.95. When these calculations are 
performed, the impulse values turn out to be 6 percent 
lower, which is close to our expectations.

The differences in the two curves of figure 7, which are 
taken to be the real performance versus the potential 
performance, are seen to amount to values between 
200 and 300 seconds. These differences, once again, 
emphasize the critical nature of the nozzle exhaust 
design in order to achieve the potential gain in PDE 
propulsion performance. 4 

Comparison with Experimental Data 
The data obtained in this study were compared to that 
obtained at the Wright Labs by Schafer, Stutrud and 
Bradley. 1 In figure 8, our data points (from figure 7 
described above) are shown on a copy of the impulse 
versus equivalence plot from figure 12 of reference 10. 
The open squares represent our thermo cycle upper 
performance limit and the open diamond symbols 
represent our ignition corrected finite rate CFD results. 
The CFD results are in excellent agreement with the 
data and the cycle results show the potential 
improvement. Note that the differences were more 
clearly depicted in figure 7. Also shown in the figure 
are the results for a single cycle PDE engine (open- 
ended tube) based on a model using gas dynamic 
calculations and experimental results. 11 

Specific Thrust and Fuel Consumption 
The specific thrust and fuel consumption were also 
determined using the cycle analysis and are shown in 
figures 9 and 10. In these calculations, only the finite 
rate heat release values were used. These results 
represent the maximum or upper limit values for the 
thrust and fuel consumption, as was the case for the 
impulse values. 

Conclusions 
A combination of a thermodynamic cycle and a CFD 
finite rate code were used to analyze detonation 
behavior in order to establish an upper limit for PDE 
cycle performance. 

The thermo cycle code was used with both equilibrium 
and finite rate sensible heat release values. It was 
determined that the recombination occurring during the 
detonation/combustion process required the use of the 
finite rate values to accurately capture the real gas 
effects. 

The CFD finite rate heat release was found to be high 
due to the ignition mechanism, which caused a large 
force that is not representative of the actual ignition 
process. These values were corrected and used for 
determining propulsion parameters, which in turn, were 
compared with the thermo cycle finite rate results. The 
comparisons established the cycle upper limits for PDE 
performance and the potential gains that may be 
realized in PDE nozzle design. 



Comparison with available data showed agreement with 
both the cycle analysis, namely the maximum upper 
limit values, and between the CFD and experimental 
data, namely the actual performance.

This paper presents the results of a thermodynamic cycle analysis of a pulse detonation engine (PDE) using a hydrogen- 
air mixture at static conditions. The cycle performance results, namely the specific thrust, fuel consumption and impulse 
are compared to a single cycle CFD analysis for a detonation tube which considers finite rate chemistry. The differences 
in the impulse values were indicative of the additional performance potential attainable in a PDE.
