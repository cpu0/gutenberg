Abstract 

Decoherence and dissipation in quantum systems has been studied extensively in the 
context of Quantum Brownian Motion. Effective decoherence in coarse grained quantum 
systems has been a central issue in recent efforts by Zurek and by Hartle and Gell-Mann 
to address the Quantum Measurement Problem. Although these models can yield very 
general classical phenomenology, they are incapable of reproducing relevant characteristics 
expected of a local environment on a quantum system, such as the characteristic dependence 
of decoherence on environment spatial correlations. I discuss the characteristics of Quantum 
Brownian Motion in a local environment by examining aspects of first principle calculations 
and by the construction of phenomenological models. Effective quantum Langevin equations 
and master equations are presented in a variety of representations. Comparisons are made 
with standard results such as the Caldeira-Leggett master equation. 

1 Introduction and Motivation 

Decoherence via coarse graining has been studied in the context of quantum measurement theory 
by Zurek [1] and by Hartle and Gell-Mann [2] as a mechanism which leads to the emergence of clas- 
sical properties. Recent efforts have focused on the decoherence effects of a heat bath, which has 
also been examined in detail in the study of quantum brownian motion. Decoherence is identified 
as the (effective) suppression of interference terms in the density operator (p(x,x r ), x ^ x'). It has 
been pointed out that most of the models which have been considered are somewhat simplistic and 
cannot reproduce the phenomenological features expected of a system which interacts locally with 
a homogeneous and isotropic environment [3]. In this paper I describe the perceived shortcomings 
of existing models and illustrate the construction of a phenomenological quantum master equation 
which contains many features expected from local coupling to a homogeneous environment [4]. 

Although decoherence is the most interesting feature of the effects of a heat bath, dissipation 
(and other effects) also generally appear in the dynamics of the density operator: 

dp(x x''t) 

^— '- — = Hamiltonian terms 4- Dissipation terms H g(x, x')p(x, x'; t). (1) 

The decoherence term appears as a (spatially dependent) decay term in the evolution equation, 
and can be understood in terms of effective fluctuating forces, or potentials: [5, 6] 

9(x, y) = (-^)(c{x; x) + c(y; y) - 2c{x; y), (V(x, t)V(y, s)) = c(x; y)6(t - s). (2)

Typical models have a quadratic form, g(x, y)<x(x- y) 2 for the decoherence term, corresponding 
to a fluctuating force which is independent of position. However, for a local bath one expects 
the correlation function to die off at some characteristic length scale (the correlation length of 
the environment), which has some important ramifications for decoherence. For a quadratic form 
of decoherence, the decay rate of the interference terms in the density matrix increases without 
bound, while for a local model the decay rate saturates at separations (between x and x') much 
larger than the correlation length of the environment, reflecting the independence of environment 
fluctuations at large separations. As it turns out, the quadratic form can be considered a short 
length scale approximation of a more detailed model. 

To consider the decoherence effects of an environment, simultaneous treatment of dissipation 
is necessary since decoherence and dissipative effects both generally arise from the same source 
(the interaction with a heat bath). For simplicity, I consider only linear dissipation, that is 

7? 

rax = p, p = p + F. (3)

As an example of quantum dissipative evolution, Dekker[7] has constructed a phenomenological 
master equation which includes ohmic dissipation and quadratic decoherence: 

%= i[ff,rt-i£M P ,p}] + {Dxp + 2 Dpx) [x, \p, P }} - g^b, [Ml - ffil*. l*,dl- (4) 

The Caldeira-Leggett[8] master equation is obtained from a first-principle calculation for the effects 
of a simple thermal bath. With an appropriate choice of parameters for the Dekker model, the 
Calderia-Leggett master equation can be reproduced. 

Many open system models can reduce to the same classical phenomenology, particularly in the 
Markov regime, and yet have significant differences for a quantum sytem in that same regime. To 
illustrate this "richness" of quantum dissipative models, consider a rather generic oscillator bath 
model (following Zwanzig[9]): 

L = \mx* - U(x) + £ ^[fi - ufo - a,(x)) 2 ]. (5) 

The classical calculations (the results of which are presumably reproduced in at least some limit of 
the quantum model) are relatively straightforward. The classical fluctuation-dissipation relation 
between the fluctuating forces and the nonlinear dissipation kernal emerges naturally, and in the 
usual Markov limit becomes: 

</i(x,*)/ i (y,s)> = k B T Vi] (x,y;t - s) = r) xj (x,y)2k B T6(t - s), (6) 

and a simple langevin equation can (at least in principle) be obtained: 

x t (t) = -?!l^ + f i ( x (t) 1 t)-Ji ij (x(t))x i . (7) 

For a homogeneous environment, the dissipation constant would be independent of position. 

Some observations about the Markov limit are in order. For the classical picture, the spatial 
correlations of the fluctuating forces are irrelevant. After all, the particle can only be in one place

at one time. For a quantum system one must consider superpositions between the particle at 
different locations, i.e. superpositions between different trajectories for the particle. My point is 
that different models may produce the same classical phenomenology, but have some important 
differences for the quantum case, in particular for the effective decoherence due to the environment. 
In order to help motivate some choices which will be required for the construction of the new 
model, consider a particle locally coupled to a scalar field. This particular model is a natural 
extension of one considered by Unruh and Zurek[10]. The action for this model is given by: 

L= / <fY { I [0 2 - <?{ V r 0) 2 ] + 6(r - x) [=f - e4>(r , t) - V(xj\ } . (8) 

This model produces approximately ohmic dissipation in one dimension[8, 11]. In addition, one can 
extract from the influence functional the effective correlation function of the fluctuating forces [5, 
11]: 

< F(x,r) .F(y,s) > = -%f- d f d d kk 2 ( ooth ^) cos(^) cos(k • (x - y)) ) . (9) 

This correlation function results from independent contributions from each mode of oscillation of 
the field. With some of the characteristics suggested by this local environment in mind, I now 
turn to the actual construction of the model. 

2 The Phenomenological Model 

The initial form of the evolution of the density operator is taken to be in the Lindblad[12] form 
(Schrodinger picture): 



m = L[p] = k [H ' p] + k ^ [v ^ ^ t} + [v » pV } ] = jh [H ' p] + AL[pl 



(10) 



for which there is a corresponding form for the Heisenberg picture V [O] which can readily be 
obtained from the cyclic properties of the trace. For a finite dimensional Hilbert space, this form 
is the most general for a completely positive dynamical semigroup. For infinite dimensional Hilbert 
spaces, it is a reasonable starting point. I will be focusing on the nonunitary part of the evolution, 
AL. 

The construction of the model is essentially the determination of the operators V M , subject to 
the constraint that the dissipation is ohmic (expressed as an operator condition). This constraint 
produces the "correct" classical phenomenology, but does not completely determine the model. 
However, linear dissipation almost forces the V M to be at most linear in momentum, that is 

V„ = A^{x) - B M (x) • p. (11) 

Homogeneity and isotropy also serve to constrain the model. Assuming some sort of mode by 
mode interaction with a field, a reasonable choice is given by: 

{V;} = {a(fc)e ikx - /?(A;)e' k - x k • p}. (12) 



421 



The discrete index \i has been replaced by the continuous index k. The model is then completely 
specified by the complex functions a and 0. 

The resulting nonunitary contribution to the Schrodinger equation is given by the expression: 

AL[p) = - Jd d k^-(p - e' kx pe- <kx ) - /<^^(|{(k ■ pf,p) - e <kx k ■ ppk • pe"* x ) 

_ J(j d fc Re[a(^^)i (e A.x {k . p>p } e -A-x) _ Jrf d fc <H°(fc)^^)l (e «k-x [k . p ,pj e -*-x). (13) 

The position representation of the new model is given by: 

dp(x, a/; t) = Hamiltonian terms _f f rffc l^)!!(i _ cos k (x - x'))) p(x, x'; t) 



dt 



- (lj dfcRefo/ (k)0(k)]k sin k(x - x')) ( ^ - ^ J p(x, x'; *) 

- (i /dMm[a (fc)/?(AO]fcsinfc(x-x')) (^ + ^7] p(x,x';t) 

(J dk\0(k)\ 2 hk 2 cos k(x-x'f) (q^)p( x > x '^)- W 



The first nonhamiltonian term is responsible for decoherence. The corresponding noise spatial 
correlation is determined by a(k). The characteristic length should be on the order of the inverse 
of the "width" of \a(k)\ 2 in k space. The second nonhamiltonian term is responsible for the 
dissipation. Clearly the dissipation and other terms are more complicated in this new model. 
However, that would also be expected from a more elaborate first principle calculation. 

By examining the Eherenfest relations of physical quantities using V , some interesting physical 
features of the new model emerge. By construction, the average position and momentum obey 
relations corresponding to ohmic dissipation: 

d -^ = U\H,P\)-l(r), ^ = >*.,]> = £>, (is) 

dt h m dt n m 



where 

m 



Jdk2Re{a{k)0(k))k 2 . (16) 



With only limited constraints on a and (7 must be positive), the kinetic energy is seen to be 
thermalized:

A low length scale approximation of the new model can be obtained by expanding the expo- 
nential terms in powers of k • x: 

AL[p] - -^fcJ^[ k .x,[k-x ) p]]-/^!^[k.p ) [k.p ) p]] 

_ jd*k Y ^ [k-x^k-p.^l+y^fc v K ^ K " (k-x,[k-p,p]]. (19) 

The lowest nonvanishing terms are second order, which exactly reproduces the Dekker master 
equation for 1 dimension. As a result, we can think of the Dekker or Caldeira-Leggett equations 
as a low length scale approximation for more general models. 
On the other hand, the Caldeira-Leggett master equation, 

AL[p] = ^[x, {p, P }} - ^[x, [x,p]}, (20) 

can be considered a special case of the Dekker master equation, with the D^ terms equal to zero 
(which Dekker has argued should be the case) and an additional low momentum approximation 
which ignores the D xx term. With this type of special case in mind, we can construct a low 
momentum approximation for the new model which includes only the decoherence and dissipation 
terms: 

AL\p}= - Jd d k&f-(p - e ikx pe"' kx ) - fdtk ***® 0{k)) ({k • p, e' kx pe-* x }). (21) 

This would seem to be a likely starting point for applications of this model. However, this 
approximation is not a positive form for the dynamics. 

Finally, I would like to look at the Wigner representation of the new model, which has some 
interesting features. If we expand the terms of the evolution equation in powers of h (in the same 
manner as is typically done with the potential), 

the lowest order terms correspond exactly to the Wigner representation of the Dekker equation. 
The Wigner representation of the Dekker equation is a standard classical type of diffusion equa- 
tion. This illustrates the idea that the "classical" nature of the system emerges when coherent 
superpositions are not important in the dynamics. In this case, the relevant superpositions are 



423 



between different locations separated by distances on the order of the environment correlation 
length. 

The convolution theorem can also be used to write down the Wigner representation of the 
evolution: 

2 r JMa (i) ($)\ 
W(q,p) = (Hamiltonian terms) - - / dj/(p - j/)W{q,p - p 1 ) W- — ±-^- 

- (^J dk l ^^W(q,p) + J dj/W(q,p-p') ] ^^ 

One apparent effect in the new model is a spreading induced by these convolution terms. 

In summary, a new phenomenological master equation for ohmic dissipation and decoherence 
has been constructed which has completely positive dynamics. The new model has the features 
expected from local coupling to a homogeneous environment: specifically, the evolution is istropic 
and translationally invariant. Spatial correlations of the environment appear explicitly in the 
models. The new model also includes previous results as low length scale approximations.
