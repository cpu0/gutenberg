Abstract. High spectral resolution (0.003 cm"') infrared solar absorption measurements 
of CO, C2H6, and HCN have been recorded at the Network for the Detection of 
Stratospheric Change station on Mauna Loa, Hawaii, (19.5°N, 155.6°W, altitude 3.4 km). 
The observations were obtained on over 250 days between August 1995 and February 
1 998 . Column measurements are reported for the 3 .4- 1 6 km altitude region, which 
corresponds approximately to the fi-ee troposphere above the station. Average CO 
mixing ratios computed for this layer have been compared with flask sampling CO 
measurements obtained in situ at the station during the same time period. Both show 
asymmetrical seasonal cycles superimposed on significant variability. The first two years 
of observations exhibit a broad January- April maximum and a sharper CO minimum 
during late summer. The C2H6 and CO 3.4-16 km columns were highly correlated 
throughout the observing period with the C2H6/CO slope intermediate between higher 
and lower values derived fi-om similar infrared spectroscopic measurements at 32°N and 
45°S latitude, respectively. Variable enhancements in CO, C2H6, and particularly HCN 
were observed beginning in about September 1997. The maximum HCN free 
tropospheric monthly mean column observed in November 1997 corresponds to an 
average 3.4-16 km mixing ratio of 0.7 ppbv (1 ppbv=10-' per unit volume), more than a 
factor of 3 above the background level. The HCN enhancements continued through the 
end of the observational series. Back-frajectory calculations suggest that the emissions 
originated at low northern latitudes in southeast Asia. Surface CO mixing ratios and the 
C2H6 fropospheric columns measured during the same time also showed anomalous 
autumn 1997 maxima. The intense and widespread tropical wild fires that burned during 



the strong El Nino warm phase of 1997-1998 are the likely source of the elevated 
emission products. 



1. Introduction 

The purpose of this paper is to report and interpret a time series of measurements 
derived from high resolution (0.003 cm"') infi-ared solar absorption spectra. The 
observations were recorded between August 1995 and February 1998 with a Fourier 
transform spectrometer operated at the Network for the Detection of Stratospheric 
Change (NDSC) [Kurylo, 1991; URL: http:/climon.wwb.noaa.gov] station on Mauna 
Loa, Hawaii (latitude 19.5°N, 155.6°W, altitude 3.4 km). The 3 molecules analyzed are 
CO, C2H6, and HCN. The infrared spectroscopic observations sample a broad altitude 
region with maximum sensitivity in the upper troposphere. We report partial column for 
the 3.4-16 km altitude region. This region corresponds approximately to the free 
troposphere above the station. The seasonal variations of the partial columns are reported 
and compared with each other, previous measurements, and model calculations. 

The molecules included in this investigation are important indicators of tropospheric 
pollution and transport. They are released at the surface and have mean tropospheric 
photochemical lifetimes of about a month for both CO and C2H6 [McKeen et ai, 1996, 
table 1] and about 2.5 years for HCN [Cicerone andZellner, 1983]. Table 1 lists the 
most important sources for each molecule. As highlighted by this table, biomass burning 
is an important source for all 3 gases. The lifetimes of CO, CjHs, and HCN are relatively 
short so that they undergo significant seasonal variations that contain important 
information on the regional distributions of sources and sinks and their variations with 
time. Carbon monoxide and nonmethane hydrocarbons such as C2H6 are also important 
O3 precursers. All 3 molecules have strong infrared spectral features that are readily 



measured by solar absorption spectroscopy [e.g., Rinsland et al, 1982, 1998a; Mahieu et 
ai, 1995, 1997; Notholtetai, 1999]. 

The Mauna Loa facility is a well-instrumented, high-altitude station for monitoring of 
atmospheric constituents, aerosols, meteorological parameters, UV radiation, and solar 
radiation [Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL), 1998]. Due to its 
high elevation, Mauna Loa is located primarily in the free troposphere [Mendonca, 1969]. 
With the exception of the observations from Mauna Loa, the mid-Pacific region is data 
sparse with few previous measurements of constituents in the free troposphere or time 
series of observations. Trajectories arriving at MLO within 10 days originate mostly 
from Asia during winter and spring with the station mostly isolated from Asian influence 
during summer when some trajectories originate from over Central America within 10 
days [CMDL, 1998; Kuniyuki et al., 1998]. Fall is a season of transition between easterly 
trades and westeriy flow [CMDL, 1998]. Transport of frace gases to the Mauna Loa 
observatory have been discussed in several recent studies [e.g., Jaffe et al., 1997; Harris 
et al., 1992, 1998]. Three important aircraft field campaigns have been conducted by 
NASA's Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE) to study tropospheric chemistry and 
transport over the Pacific basin [//oe//ef a/., 1996, 1997, 1999]. Tropospheric remote 
sensing measurements have also been obtained in this region during several shuttle flights 
[Reichle et al., 1986, 1990, 1999; Connors et al., 1999; Rinsland et al., 1998a]. 

2. Infrared Spectroscopic Observations 

The infrared solar absorption measurements at the Mauna Loa observatory (MLO) 
were recorded with a modified Bruker model 120-HR Fourier transform spectrometer 



(FTS) operated at an unapodized spectral resolution of 0.0035 cm' (defined as 0.9 
divided by the maximum optical path difference). The instrument, installed in August 
1995, is equipped with a computer-controlled solar tracker with a hatched weather-tight 
enclosure. The system only requires an operator to fill the detector dewars with liquid 
nitrogen once a day. The system monitors the weather conditions and records solar 
spectra when conditions are favorable. Observations are scheduled at sunrise and sunset 
beginning on Monday afternoon through Saturday morning. Under favorable conditions, 
the morning observations commence at 85° solar zenith angle with a total of 10 
measurements recorded in 6 spectral bandpasses. Each observation is obtained from 2 
complete interferograms recorded over a 4-minute time period. An additional 4 minutes 
is required for computer evaluation and processing time of the observation. The database 
analyzed here covers the August 1995 to February 1998, excluding time periods lost due 
to instrumental problems. Most measurements were obtained in the morning because of 
more frequent cloudiness in the afternoon. 

Observations from the same site were also obtained between May 1991 and November 
1995 with a Bomem model DA3.002 FTS operated typically at 0.005 cm"' resolution 
[e.g., Goldman et al, 1992; David et al, 1994; Rimland et ai, 1994]. Additionally, 
infrared spectra were recorded at 0.02 cm'^ resolution on 4 days in February 1987 
[Rinsland et al. ,1988]. Both sets of earlier measurements were obtained less frequently, 
and they are generally of lower quality relative to the more recent measurements. Hence, 
only the measurements recorded with the Bruker interferometer are included in the 
present investigation. 



3. Analysis Method and Assumptions 
a. ) Retrieval Algorithm 

The infrared solar spectra were analyzed with the SFIT2 algorithm, which has been 
developed for the retrieval of molecular vertical profiles from ground-based infrared solar 
absorption spectra. The profiles of one or two molecules are retrieved by simultaneously 
fitting one or more narrow spectral intervals (microwindows) in one or more solar 
spectra. The forward and inverse models in SFIT2 have been described previously 
[Pougatchev et al, 1995; Rinsland et al. 1998b]. The algorithm includes a crude model 
for simulating and fitting the absorption by solar CO lines [Rinsland et al., 1998b. section 
3.2.2]. The modeling of instrument performance-related parameters includes a parameter 
to retrieve the wavelength shift between the measured and calculated spectra and a 
parameter to fit for the slope of the background in each microwindow. The latter 
parameter was required primarily because of uncertainties in modeling the absorption by 
lines outside the fitted regions, particularly those of H2O and its continuum. 

b.) A priori Profiles and Covariance Matrix Parameters 

Below 12 km, a priori profiles for CO and C2H6 were derived by averaging aircraft in 
situ profile measurements obtained near Mauna Loa during 3 GTE missions. The 
measurements were obtained during the Pacific Exploratory Mission (PEM)-West, phase 
A, conducted September-October 1991 [Hoell et al, 1996], PEM-West, phase B, 
conducted during February-March 1994 [Hoell et al., 1997], and PEM-Tropics A 
conducted between August-October 1 996 [Hoell et al. , 1 999]. Prior CO in situ 
measurements from Mauna Loa show considerable variability throughout the year. A 



factor of two seasonal variation at the surface is indicated from time series of CMDL 
observations [Novelli et al, 1992; 1998]. Similarly, a factor of two seasonal change was 
indicated from C2H6 infrared total column measurements [Rinsland et al, 1994]. The 
late winter GTE observations were obtained near maxima in both the CO and C2H6 
seasonal cycles. We assumed the mean of the late winter and autumn profiles for both 
molecules. Above 12 km, the profiles were connected to averages of version 2 profiles 
measured by the Atmospheric Trace MOlecuie Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment 
during the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ATLAS)-3 mission of 
November 1994 [Gunson et al, 1996]. ATMOS measurements between latitudes of 
15°N and 25°N were averaged to derive the a priori profiles for CO and C2H6. 

For HCN, a constant mixing ratio of 190 pptv (IQ-'^ per unit volume) was assumed 
below 16 km. At higher altitudes a vertical distribution scaled to connect smoothly to tiie 
reference profile given in Table III oiMahieu et al [1995]. This profile is based on 
retrievals from ground-based infrared solar spectra recorded at the U.S. National Solar 
Observatory facility on Kitt Peak, Arizona (31.9T^ latitude, 1 1 1.6°W longitude, altitude 
2.09 km) and the International Scientific Station of the Jungfraujoch (ISSJ) in the Swiss 
Alps (46.6°N latitude, 8.0°E longitude, altitude 3.58 km) [Mahieu et al, 1995]. 

Vertical temperature profiles assumed in the analysis were taken from daily mean 
National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) measurements. They were 
smoothly connected to the 1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere above 65 km. A priori 
volume mixing ratio profiles for interfering species were taken from reference 
compilations (e.g.. Smith [1982]). 



c.) Spectroscopic Parameters and Microwindow Selections 

Spectroscopic parameters adopted in the present study were taken from the 1996 
HITRAN compilation [Rothman et al, 1998], except for the C2H6 parameters which were 
replaced by improved values [Rinsland et al, 1998b, section 4. 1] based on updates to the 
work of Pine and Stone [1996]. A line of HDO was added at 4274.81 cm"' to account for 
an unassigned absorption feature [Rinsland et al., 1998b, section 4.2]. Absorption by this 
transition is very weak because of the low H2O column abundance above the high- 
altitude Mavma Loa station. 

Table 2 lists the microwindows selected for the analysis of each molecule along with a 
list of the interfering molecules that were fitted. The CO and C2H6 windows are identical 
to those used in a previous investigation [Rinsland et al., 1998b]; simulations of the 
atmospheric absorption by the individual molecules were displayed in Figs. 5 and 7 of 
that paper. One of the two windows selected for retrieving profiles of CO contains the 
strong CH4 line at 4285.1553 cm-^[i?m5/a«J era/., 1998b, Fig. 7J. As in the previous 
study, the profile of CH4 was also retrieved, though the results for this molecule are not 
reported here. 

The interval for retrieving HCN contains the V3 band P(8) line at 3287.2483 cm"'. 
This transifion is located in the far wings of the strong H2O lines at 3286.1689 and 
3288.4829 cm'' with weak transitions of CO2 and several less significant absorbers 
nearby [Rinsland et al., 1982]. Fits to the HCN V3 band P(4) line at 3299.5273 cm"' 
simultaneously with the P(8) line showed minor inconsistencies. This problem was noted 
previously by Mahieu et al. [1995]. Therefore, we decided not to include the P(4) line in 
the analysis.

d.) Retrieval Characterization 

Averaging kernels provide a direct assessment of the theoretical altitude sensitivity of 
the observations in the absence of errors in the measurements and model parameters 
[Rodgers, 1990, section 4]. They are a function of the retrieval intervals selected, the 
spectral resolution of the observations, the assumed signal-to-noise of the measurements, 
and the selections of the retrieval parameters, such as the a priori profile and its 
covariance matrix. In this work, we assumed the covariance matrix is diagonal and 
adopted a relative uncertainty equal to 0.5 times the a priori mixing ratio in each of the 
29 layers in the atmospheric model extending fi-om the surface (3.4 km) to 100 km. 
Figure 1 shows the averaging kernels for CO, CzHg, and HCN. The kernels were 
calculated for the spectral resolution of the measurements and the typical signal-to-noise 
ratio of 200. Kernels are shown for 3.4-16.0 km and the total column. The boundary at 
16 km corresponds to the approximate altitude of the annual mean tropopause above 
Mauna Loa. As can be seen from this figure, the kernels for the 3.4-16.0 km layer are 
broad for all 3 molecules with sensitivities that peak in the upper troposphere. The 
altitudes of the peaks of the 3.4-16.0 km kernels are 1 1 km for CO, 11 km for C2H6, and 
13 km for HCN, respectively. 

e.) Error Analysis 

In Table 3, we report estimates of the uncertainties in the 3.4-16.0 km columns due to 
both random and systematic sources of error. The approach used to estimate the 
uncertainties is the same as adopted previously [Rinsland et al, 1998b]. 

The sources of random error considered are the temperature uncertainty, uncertainty 
in the solar zenith angle, the effect of random instrumental noise, and errors in calculating 



11 



the absorption by interfering lines. We estimated the uncertainty due to errors in the 
temperature profile by performed retrievals with 2 K added to the NCEP temperature at 
each altitude. Changes in the 3.4-16 km columns are shown in the table; the values 
reported for temperature are the mean offset obtained from retrievals performed with 3 
randomly selected spectra on different days. The maximum error due to temperature 
profile uncertainty was the value of 1.7% obtained for C2H6. 

As already mentioned, each spectrum is generated from two coadded scans. The 
airmass corresponding to the time of each zero path difference crossing is calculated and 
the values averaged. Errors are introduced by the approximations used to estimate the 
airmass of each spectrum and also by uncertainties in the time stamping of the individual 
spectral files (up to 30 sec). Calculations performed for a solar zenith angle of 75° 
indicate both effects combine to introduce an uncertainty in the calculated air mass of 

about 1%. 

The contribution of instrumental noise was evaluated by generating random numbers 
with zero mean, a normal distribution, and a root-mean-square deviation equal to 0.005 
times the maximum transmission in the spectral interval. The selected noise level is 
typical of the Mauna Loa observations. Noise generated with 10 different seeds was 
added to synthetic spectra calculated for a solar astronomical zenith angle of 60°, and the 
retrievals were repeated for each case. The mean difference between the 3.4-16 km 
columns retrieved from the noisy spectra and the values obtained without noise is given 
in the table. As we report only daily average partial columns, the error due to random 
noise will be generally less than the value in table 3. 



12 



Estimates for the random errors due to interfering atmospheric lines reflect the high 
altitude of Mauna Loa station. Previously, we estimated uncertainties of 7 and 2 % in the 
tropospheric columns of CzHe above Lauder, New Zealand (45.0°S latitude, 169.7°E 
longitude, 0.37 km altitude) and Kitt Peak, respectively [Rinsland et al, 1998b, table 1]. 
The relatively high estimated uncertainties reflected the potential for error in the 
calculation of the H2O absorption line overlapping the target C2H6 spectral feature at 
2976.8 cm-' [Rinsland et al, 1998b, Fig. 5]. Hence, our calculated uncertainty due to 
potential errors in calculating the overlapping interference by H2O absorption line is 

significantly reduced. 

Four sources of systematic error were considered: (1) errors in the assumed 
spectroscopic line parameters, (2) uncertainties in the forward model, (3) errors in the a 
priori profiles, and (4) errors in the instrument line shape fimction. The improvements in 
the C2H6 spectroscopic parameters reduced the uncertainty in those retrievals firom 10% 
[Rinsland et al, 1994] to 5% [Rinsland et al, 1998b]. The forward model is also the 
same as adopted previously, and hence the estimated systematic error due to its 
limitations and approximations is unchanged [Rinsland et al, 1998b]. We estimated 
the effect of uncertainty in knowledge of the instrument line shape fimction by generating 
a synthetic spectrum for each molecule based on the instrument line shape fimction 
assumed in the retrievals. We then performed a retrieval from the synthetic spectrum 
with the coefficient of the "straight line" effective apodization coefficient [Park, 1983] 
offset from the nominal value of 0.0 to -0.2. This calculation simulates an error in the 
apodizing fimction with the error increasing from zero at the zero path difference to 20% 
at tiie maximum path difference. Changes in the 0.4-16 km columns were at less than 



13 



0.4% for all 3 molecules. Hence, errors in modeling the instrument line shape function 
introduce only a small error in the calculated 0.4-16 km columns. Narrow lines in the 
solar spectra showed no evidence for phase errors. 

4. Results 

a.) Carbon Monoxide (CO) 

Figure 2 presents typical spectral fits to the Mauna Loa solar absorption spectra in the 
two windows used to measure atmospheric CO. The high quality of the Mauna Loa 
measurements and the success in modeling the atmospheric and solar features can be 
noted from the low residuals, which are displayed above the measured and best-fit 

calculated spectra. 

Figure 3 displays the time series of Mauna Loa CO measurements. The solid circles 
show monthly mean mixing ratios (ppbv, 10"' per unit volume) calculated by dividing the 
3.4-16 km CO column by the total air column in the same layer. Daily averages were 
used in these calculations. Low signal-to-noise ratio observations and poor fits to the 
spectral data have been excluded [Rinsland et al., 1998b, section 5.0]. The open circles 
show monthly averages of preliminary CO mixing ratios from the CMDL cooperative 
flask sampling network. The measurements were collected weekly from Mauna Loa and 
are referenced to the CO CMDL scale [Novelli et al, 1991]. To avoid sampling 
boundary layer air, the measurements are obtained in the morning before upslope flow 
begins. Details of the sampling procedures and analytic methods can be found in Novelli 
et al. [1992, 1998]. The flask measurements have been filtered to remove observations 
subject to sampling errors, analytical problems, and non-background level measurements. 



14 



The vertical lines show standard deviations of the measurements. Absence of a vertical 
marker denotes months when FTS measurements were recorded on a single day. Only 
the CMDL observations obtained during the time period of the FTS measurements are 

presented. 

The 2.6 years of CO surface and FTS measurements presented in Fig. 3 show 
significant short-term variations superimposed on a seasonal change of about a factor of 
two. The August 1995-August 1997 measurements show very similar seasonal cycles 
with a broad maximum in CO mixing ratio at the surface between January to April. The 
seasonal variations at the surface are similar those reported for 1990-1995 by Novelli et 
al. [1998, Fig. 4]. Near the peak of the cycle, the surface mixing ratio averaged 10-20% 
higher than the mean value calculated from the integrated 3.4-16 km spectroscopic 
columns. This difference implies that the free tropospheric CO mixing ratio profile 
generally decreased with altitude, consistent with GTE PEM-West B mission CO 
measurements obtained on February 7 and 8, 1994, near Hawaii [Hoell et al, 1997, table 
1]. These measurements are available from the GTE data archive at NASA's Langley 
Research Center (URL: http://www-gte.larc.nasa.gov). The CMDL surface and 3.4-16 
km FTS column measurements both show a sharp minimum during late summer. While 
many factors influence the seasonal variation of tropospheric CO, consistent with 
previous studies [e.g., Novelli et al, 1998], we note that the seasonal CO maxima and 
minima occur several months later the corresponding variations expected for OH from 
seasonal changes in solar insulation. The late summer agreement between the FTS and 
CMDL mixing ratios implies that the CO mixing ratio profile was on average nearly 
constant with altitude in the free troposphere. This conclusion is also consistent with the 



15 



aircraft profiles measured in October 1991 close to Hawaii during the PEM-West A 
mission [Hoell et al, 1996, table 2]. The September 1997-February 1998 time period 
was anomalous in that the monthly averages showed maxima in surface CO (during 
October) and free tropospheric CO (during November). The agreement between the two 
sets of mixing ratios in late 1997 implies that the CO vertical mixing ratio profile was 
nearly uniform in the free troposphere during this anomalous time period. 

Pougatchev and Rinsland [1995] reported measurements of the CO seasonal variation 
in two layers deduced from infrared solar spectra recorded between 1982 and 1993. The 
observations were recorded from Kitt Peak located in Arizona, U.S.A., at 32°N latitude, 
1 12°W, 2.09 km altitude. The lower layer extending from the surface to 400 mbar (~7 
km altitude) sampled primarily the free troposphere. The upper layer extended from 400 
mbar to the top of the atmosphere. The asymmetrical seasonal variations in both layers 
are qualitatively similar to the variations indicated from the Mauna Lea surface and 
infrared specfroscopic measurements. An average ratio of 2.2±0.1 was derived from the 
Kitt Peak measurements by dividing the average mixing ratio in the lower layer by the 
average mixing ratio in the upper layer. This ratio implies that within the troposphere 
there is a more rapid decrease with altitude above Kitt Peak than above Mauna Loa, 
consistent with the continental location of Kitt Peak and its closer location to sources. 

Very few measurements of the seasonal variation of CO in the tropical and subtropical 
upper troposphere have been reported previously. Measurements of CO mixing ratios 
have been obtained at altitudes of 8.5-13 km during commercial airiine flights between 
Japan and Australia from April 1993 to July 1996 roughly at 140°W longitude [Matsueda 
et al. , 1 998a] . They provided unique measurements of CO variations as a function of 



16 



latitude and time in the upper troposphere over the western Pacific. The average CO 
seasonal cycle for this time period in the 15°N-20°N latitude band [Matsueda et al., 
1998a, Fig. 7] was derived by fitting the measurement time series with a linear function 
combined with three harmonics [Matsueda et al, 1998a, Eq. 1]. The best-fit seasonal 
component shows a minimum in mid-February with the peak amplitude of 10 ppbv and a 
maximum at the beginning of May with a peak amplitude of 20 ppbv. Little seasonal 
variation was observed at these heights during other times of the year [Matsueda et al, 
1 998a, Fig. 7]. Our measurements of the peak-to-peak amplitude of the seasonal cycle 
are generally consistent with the aircraft observations, though the times of the maxima 
and minima are different in the two data sets. The CO late summer minimum apparent in 
the Mauna Loa 3.4-16 km column measurement time series is not obvious in the aircraft 
flask sampling observations. The differences in locations of the two sets of observations 
and the limited samplings of both data sets are likely to contribute to these discrepancies. 

To date, the only near global observations of tropospheric CO were obtained by a 
nadir-viewing Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites (MAPS) instrument that flew 
onboard the U.S. Space Shuttle [Reichle et al, 1986, 1990, 1999; Connors et al, 1999]. 
Table 4 presents the monthly mean 3.4-16 km CO columns derived from our FTS 
measurements and values calculated from the MAPS observations. The measurements 
are sorted by month. The number of days included in the calculations is listed in the 
table. Values from the FTS observations are presented separately for the August 1995- 
August 1997 and the September 1997-February 1998 time periods. 

MAPS observations sample CO in the atmosphere [Pougatchev et al, 1998, Fig. 2] 
with a vertical sensitivity very similar to our FTS solar observations (Fig. 1). Both sets of 



17 



observations are sensitive to changes in middle and upper tropospheric CO but have 
practically no sensitivity to changes in boundary layer CO levels [Pougatchev et al, 
1998, Fig. 2]. In contrast, it should be noted that ground-based infrared measurements of 
CO are usually performed from a strong CO line at 4.7 ^im, which samples the 
atmosphere with a total column averaging kernel peaked at the surface, not in the upper 
troposphere {Pougatchev et al, 1998, Fig. 2]. 

The MAPS instrument measured CO near Mauna Loa during shuttle flights in October 
1984, April 1994, and October 1994. Average mixing ratios and standard deviations 
were computed from a 1° x 1° gridded product (S. R. Nolf, private communication, 
1999). Observations between 17°N and 21°N latitude and 150°W and 160°W longitude 
were included. Averaging was performed because many of the MAPS grid points do not 
have observational values due to the presence of clouds in the field of view or gaps in the 
spatial coverage during the limited time period of the shuttle flights. This region is 
located almost entirely over ocean. 

We next used our Mauna Loa CO a priori profile to calculate a multiplicative factor 
that relates the mean mixing ratio in the 3.4-16 km layer sampled by the FTS to a partial 
column integrated over the same altitude range. The Mauna Loa CO a priori profile used 
for the FTS retrievals was assumed. The derived conversion factor between mean CO 
mixing ratio to the CO column in the 3.4-16 km layer is 1 ppbv= 1 .196x10^* molecules 
cm'l This approach provides a quantitative correction for the reduced CO column 
sampled by the FTS observations from the high-altitude Mauna Loa station. Because of 
the close similarity between the FTS and MAPS averaging kernels and a priori profiles, 
the error in our conversion of MAPS mixing ratio to equivalent 3.4-16 km CO column is 



18 



estimated as 3%, significantly less than the 10% accuracy of the MAPS CO observations 
[Reichle et al, 1999]. Our approach for relating ground-based IR columns and MAPS 
mixing ratios is consistent with the analysis of Pougatchev et al. [1998]. 

As shown in table 4, the FTS monthly average CO 3.4-16 km columns measured after 
September 1997 are higher than values from the corresponding months of August 1995- 
August 1997. The ratio of monthly averages from the two time periods peaked at 
1 .43±0.30. This value and uncertainty were calculated from monthly averages and 
standard deviations for November 1997 relative to values for November 1995 and 
November 1996. Monthly means of January 1998 and February 1998 FTS measurements 
are only marginally higher than the corresponding values from the 1995-1997 time 

period. 

Tropospheric CO columns calculated from the MAPS measurements at the location 
of Mauna Loa show significant variations that are both higher and lower than the FTS 
averages. It is necessary to compare observations for the same months because of the 
large seasonal variation in CO. Although no FTS measurements were recorded during 
the month of April, we estimated a value for that month by averaging the FTS monthly 
means from March and May of 1995-1997. The MAPS measurement from its April 1994 
shuttle flight is higher than the calculated FTS mean by a factor of 1.17±0.24. The 
MAPS column for October 1994 is also higher than the FTS value from October 1995 
and October 1996 by a factor 1.24±0.19, but it was 0.98±0.20 times the FTS 
measurements from October 1997. The MAPS column from October 1984 is the lowest 
value measured during that month. The ratio of the MAPS October 1984 to the mean of 
the Mauna Loa March and May measurements from 1995-1997 is 0.65±0.12.

b.) Ethane (C2H6) 

The top panel of figure 4 illustrates a typical Mauna Loa spectrum and fit in the region 
analyzed to retrieve the C2H6 profiles. The time series of 3.4-16 km columns shows a 
distinct seasonal cycle that is very similar to the one observed for the 3.4-16 km CO 
columns. This result is consistent with an analysis of Mauna Loa C2H6 observations 
recordedbetweenNovember 1991 and July 1993 [Rinslandet ai, 1994], tvcn±ough 
the two sets of observations were recorded with different instruments, analyzed with 
different sets of spectroscopic parameters, and different spectral fitting programs were 
adopted. No significant long-term trend in the CjHe column has been found from either 

dataset. 

Table 5 presents monthly averages of the CjlU 3.4-16 km columns from the 1995- 
1998 series of measurements. As was done for CO, we report values separately for the 
August 1995-August 1997 and the September 1997-February 1998 time periods. The 
mean columns were systematically higher during October to December 1997 relative to 
values for the same months in 1995 and 1996. As for CO, the maximum enhancement 
was observed in November 1997 with an observed ratio of 1.43±0.41 relative to the 
corresponding observations from 1995 and 1996. The January and February 1998 
measurements show no obvious enhancements relative to the 1995-1997 observations 

from the same months. 

Figure 5 presents a plot of the daily average 3.4-16 km C2H6 vs. the daily average CO 
3.4-16 km columns. Measurements from all seasons are included with the solid line 
indicating a fit assuming a linear relation between the two sets of columns. Table 6 
compares the correlation coefficients and CiHe/CO slope derived from the Mauna Loa 



20 



spectroscopic observations with previous tropospheric spectroscopic column 
measurements. The previous measurements were obtained from Lauder and Km Peak 
[Rinsland et ai, 1998b]. The correlations between the integrated CO and C2H6 
tropospheric columns are likely to reflect common principal sources for both molecules 
(see Table 1) and their similar rates of reaction with OH [Rudolph, 1995]. Also, the 
C2H6/CO emission factor of 0.0094 derived from biomass fire measurements [Yokelson et 
al, 1997, Table 3] is very similar to the slope derived from the Lauder infrared 
observations during the southern hemisphere burning season. The best-fit Mauna Loa 
C2H6/CO 3.4-16 km columns ratio of 0.00935 and the correlation coefficient of 0.927 are 
also similar to values of 0.0073 and 0.92 deduced from C2H6 and CO mixing ratios 
measured in situ in the western Pacific basin between 10°S and 25°N latitude and above 2 
km altitude during February and March 1994 [Blake et al, 1997, Fig. 2]. 

We have also compared the Mauna Loa CO and C2H6 tropospheric columns with 
monthly values calculated by integrating profiles predicted for the same location with a 
global 3-D tropospheric model [Wang et al, 1998]. The model tropospheric columns (Y. 
Wang, private communication, 1999) reproduce the spring maximum and autumn 
minimum measured for both CO and C2H6 between August 1995 and August 1 997. The 
ratio of the monthly mean tropospheric columns to the corresponding model values has 
been calculated for this time period. The mean and standard deviation are 1 .06 and 0.08 
for CO and 1.61 and 0.21 for C2H6, respectively. Hence, the model values are in very 
good agreement with the measured CO tropospheric columns, but the model values are 
systematically low for C2H6. The discrepancy for C2H6 is likely to reflect an 



21 



underestimation of C2H6 emissions from southeast Asia (Y. Wang, private 
communications, 1999). 

Both observational and theoretical evidence indicates that the tropospheric mixing 
ratios of relatively long-lived hydrocarbons are determined by a combination of OH 
photochemistry and turbulent mixing during transport [e.g., McKeen et al, 1996]. In 
general, these processes cannot be distinguished. Although the observed ratio of 
C2H2/CO has proven to be a highly useful indicator of the combined effects of dynamical 
mixing and photochemistry, the absorption by C2H2 lines is weak in the high-altitude, 
low-latitude Mauna Loa solar spectra. Hence, it did not prove possible to measure C2H2 
tropospheric columns throughout the year and use the C2H2 to CO ratio to classify air 
masses, as has been done successfully during GTE field missions [e.g., Smyth et al, 
1996]. 

c.) Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN) 

Figure 6 illustrates fits to the Mauna Loa spectra in the HCN window. The two 
examples were selected to illustrate observations recorded during the month of November 
at nearly the same solar zenith angle but with HCN 3.4-16 km column abundances that 
differ by one order of magnitude. 

Figure 7 presents the measured tune series of HCN 3.4-16 km partial columns derived 
from the Mauna Loa measurements. Monthly averages and standard deviations are 
reported in table 7. As for CO and C2H6, results are reported separately for the August 
1995-August 1997 and September 1997-February 1998. As summarized in this table, 
the variations in HCN are substantially larger than those measured for CO and C2H6. 



22 



Higher HCN 3.4-16 km columns were measured throughout the October 1997 to 
February 1998 time period relative to those from corresponding months between August 
1995 and August 1997. A maximum ratio of 3.37±1 .70 was calculated fi-om the mean 
and standard deviation of the November 1997 monthly averages and the corresponding 
values from both November 1995 and November 1996. 

Solid curves in Fig. 7 display the seasonal variation and long-term trend deduced from 
the best-fits to the measurements. The long-term trend fit suggests a factor of two 
increase in the 3.4-16 km column over the observation period. However, northern- 
hemisphere ground-based total columns [Mahieu et al, 1995, 1997] and ATMOS lower 
stratospheric mixing ratios from solar specfra from 1985 and 1994 [Rinslandet al, 1996] 
show no evidence for a substantial change in HCN amounts at northern mid-latitudes 
over multi-year time periods. The apparent trend in the HCN 3.4-16 km column above 
Mauna Loa is due to the sharp increases observed after about September 1997. 

There is now both direct and indirect evidence that HCN is less uniformly distributed 
in the troposphere than indicated by an early assessment [Cicerone andZellner, 1983]. 
Ground-based infrared spectroscopic measurements of HCN recorded from the 
International Scientific Station of the Jungfi^ujoch (ISSJ) in the Swiss Alps and Kitt Peak 
showed variable enhancements in the total column of up to factors of two and three 
during spring, respectively [Mahieu et al, 1995, Figs. 3, 4; 1997]. The measured line 
shapes indicated that the springtime HCN enhancements occurred near the surface, and 
they were attributed to increased vegetative activity. Infrared solar occultation specfra 
recorded by the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) Fourier transform 
specfrometer indicated variable enhancements of up to a factor of 5 in the November 



23 



1994 tropical and subtropical upper troposphere [Rinsland et al, 1998a, Fig. 2]. 
Ground-based measurements of HCN derived from IR solar spectra recorded during a 
ship cruise between 60°N and 50°S on the central Atlantic also showed a pronounced 
peak in the total column of HCN. The maximum was observed in the southern tropics 
during October 1996 [Notholt et al, 1999]. The high HCN columns (corresponding to an 
average tropospheric mixing ratio of >200 pptv) coincided with elevated levels of CO, 
C2H6, and C2H2, which are well-known emission products of biomass fires [Yokelson et 

al., 1996, 1997]. 

The HCN enhancements indicated by the ATMOS and cruise tropical observations 
have been attributed to increased production of HCN in biomass fires {Rinsland et al, 
1998a; Notholt et al, 1999]. Evidence for this link originates primarily fi-om emission 
factors derived from laboratory fire studies [Lobert et al, 1990, 1991 ; Hurst et al, 
1994a,b; Yokelsen et al, 1996, 1997]. Although production efficiencies are observed to 
vary widely depending on the fiiel type and burning phase, we note that from some 
smoldering organic soils, HCN is the dominant detected nitrogen-containing biomass 
emission relative to CO [Yokelson et al, 1997]. Usually NH3 is the major nitrogen- 
containing emission detected from such fires [Yokelson et al, 1997]. Indirect evidence 
for elevated HCN upper tropospheric levels has been inferred from the large 
discrepancies between total reactive nitrogen (NOy) levels measured during GTE airborne 
field campaigns and values calculated by summing the mixing ratios of the individual 
components thought to comprise NOy [Bradshaw et al, 1998]. The observed differences 
are largest in the middle to upper troposphere [Bradshaw et al, 1998]. 



24 



Figure 8 compares the Mauna Loa CO, C2H6, and HCN 3.4-16 km partial columns for 
the last half of 1997. As can be seen from this plot, the measurements of the 3 molecules 
are highly correlated. The correlation coefficient between HCN and CO for this time 
period is 0.95. Tropospheric columns of HCN prior to the beginning of October 1997 
average 2 x lO'' molecules cm"' with mean 3.4-16 km mixing ratios close to the typical 
background level of 190 pptv in the free troposphere [Mahieu et al, 1995]. However, 
highly variable levels of all 3 molecules were observed, particularly during October and 
November 1997. Sharp peaks in HCN were measured on Oct. 18 and Nov. 15 with the 
mid-November maximum the larger of the two. The relative enhancements of HCN are 
by far the largest observed for the three molecules with a maximum HCN 3.4-16 km 
column of 9.14 x 10^' molecules cm"' on November 15. This value corresponds to an 
average free tropospheric HCN mixing ratio of 0.7 ppbv. After subtracting columns of 
HCN and CO based on the 1995 and 1996 measurements, we calculate that the 
November 1997 monthly mean correponded to an excess HCN/CO 3.4-16 km columns 
ratio of 0.00982, well within the wide range of values measured from laboratory fires 
(e.g. 0.00049-0.0581) [Lobert et al, 1991, Table 36.4]. The weekly Mauna Loa CMDL 
surface CO measurements from October-November 1997 show no obvious evidence for 
the sharp peaks detected in the infrared column measurements. 

5.) Trajectory Calculations and Discussion 

The correlated variations of CO, C2H6, and HCN and unusual seasonal cycles 
observed during the second half of 1997 suggest a common emission origin. The 
averaging kernels and the observed broad widths of the spectral lines imply that the 



25 



enhancements were located primarily in the upper troposphere. In an effort to identify 
the origin of the high concentrations of the trace gases, we performed back-trajectory 
calculations with the HYSPLIT4 (Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated 
Trajectory) model [Draxler and Hess, 1997]. Calculations were performed for two 
altitudes above Mauna Loa, 7 and 11 km. The 6-hourly FLN archive data from the 
NCEP operational model runs were adopted. 

Calculations were performed for up to a 10-day period ending at hr on each of 5 
days before and 5 days after the HCN 3.4-16 km column maximum on November 15, 
1997. Although there appears to be no consensus on the preferred methodology 
[Draxler, 1996], we performed runs based on the isentropic and the kinematic 
assumptions, which should be more realistic in the free troposphere than calculations that 
assume isobaric vertical motion. 

Figure 9 displays the kinematic back trajectories ending at the two altitudes above 
Mauna Loa.. The calculations were terminated shortly after land was encountered. 
Although there were significant variations among the calculated altitudes and to a lesser 
extent the geographic paths traversed by the back trajectories, essentially all of the 
calculated trajectories arrived above Hawaii from the west. The plots show that the low 
northern hemisphere tropical latitudes of Asia are the most likely origin of the enhanced 
emissions. Intense and widespread forest fires occurred in tropical Asia during 1997 and 
early 1998 and impacted a large portion of the population in that region [Liew et ai, 
1998; Phadnis et ai, 1998; UNEP, 1999]. Available satellite imagery and visual reports 
confirm the existence of widespread biomass burning in southeast Asia [Liew et al, 
1998]. Most of our calculated trajectories pass north of Indonesia and Malaysia where 



26 



the most intense burning occurred. However, the calculated trajectories are subject to 
errors in the thermodynamic and wind fields [Merrill, 1996]. Also, there is numerical 
uncertainty due to the use of the gridded data to represent the continuous flow of air 
[Draxler, 1996]. As demonstrated by previous studies [Mem//, 1996; Draxler, 1996], 
the errors accumulate with time and can lead to large uncertainties for long-range 
trajectory calculations, particularly over oceans where there are few soundings. Sample 
tests performed by rerunning 10-day back trajectories forward in time from their end 
point at an altitude of 11 km showed typical differences in calculated longitude and 
latitude of 1 5° and 2°, respectively. 

Support for a connection between our observations of enhancements in tropospheric 
CO, C2H6, and HCN columns and the tropical fires of 1997-1998 comes fi-om the 
measurements of CO observed in the tropical south Pacific during that time. Increased 
CO levels were measured at the CMDL station on American Samoa (14.2°S, 170.6°E, 
elevation 77m) and during shipboard transects between 5°S and 25°S latitude [NovellL, 
1998]. Relatively large annual mean CO values were also reported for 1997 from 
shipboard measurements in the low latitudes of the South China Sea. They reflect the 
very high CO levels observed during August, September, and October 1997 [CMDL, 
1999, section 2.4.2 and table 2.9]. A unique seasonal cycle with an extremely enhanced 
CO maximum tiiroughout the southern hemisphere was also observed at 8-13 km altitude 
during au-craft flights over the western Pacific in September and November 1997 
[Matsuedaetal, 1998b]. 

The observed enhancements and unusual seasonal variations in the fi-ee tropospheric 
columns of CO, C2H6, and HCN observed above Mauna Loa may be related to the 



27 



occurrence of ENSO (El Nino/Southern Oscillation) events. ENSO events influence air 
temperature and precipitation patterns [Ropelewski andHalpert, 1987; Halpert and 
Ropelewski, 1992], which in turn effect the distribution, frequency, and intensity of 
tropical biomass burning emissions. An index of spatially averaged sea surface 
temperature anomalies calculated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) (URL: 
http//www.coaps.fsu.edu/pub/JMA_SST_Index/jma.gif) and a classification of ENSO 
periods by the Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (COAPS). (URL: 
http//www.coaps.fsu.edu/~legler/jma_indexl .shtml) show the two most intense ENSO 
events since 1970 took place in 1982-83 and 1997-98. Similar to 1997-98, large amounts 
of burning took place in southeast Asia and New Guinea during drought conditions in 
1982-83 [Malingreau et al, 1985] with elevated levels of tropospheric ozone observed in 
that region [Fishman et al, 1990; Kim and Newchurch, 1998]. We note that high levels 
of tropospheric O3 are often accompanied by enhancements in CO and other trace gases 
[Browell et al., 1996]. However, de-seasonalized weekly surface flask sampling 
measurements of CO mixing ratios from Cape Kumukhai and Mauna Loa, Hawaii, and 
Samoa (14.2°S, 170.6°E) show no obvious enhancements during 1982-83 [Khalil and 
Rasmussen, 1988, Fig. 1]. These early CO flask sampling measurements may be 
unreliable because of stability problems [Fraser et al., 1988; Mansbridge et al., 1988], or 
possibly the prevailing winds did not transport the elevated CO emissions to Samoa or 
Hawaii. Hence, although a good case can be made for elevated emissions and ttansport 
of these emissions from southeast Asia to Mauna Loa in 1997-1998, to our knowledge, 
no conclusive observational evidence exists for a similar connection during the intense El 
Nino of 1982-1983.

6. Summary and Conclusions 

We have analyzed a time series of CO, C2H6, and HCN infrared solar measurements 
obtained with the high spectral resolution FTS located at the NDSC primary station on 
Mauna Loa, Hawaii. The measurements were recorded in solar absorption mode on over 
250 days between August 1995 and February 1998. The observations sample a broad 
altitude region with maximum sensitivity in the upper troposphere. Daily average 3.4-1 6 
km columns are reported for all 3 molecules and compared with previous measurements 
and model calculations. The comparisons include CO columns calculated for the same 
altitude and geographic region from the MAPS shuttle measurements in April 1994, 
October 1984, and October 1994, CMDL surface CO flask measurements from Mauna 
Loa during the FTS observing period, and GTE aircraft measurements obtained near 
Hawaii during several campaigns. 

Both the FTS and CMDL CO data show significant variability superimposed on 
changes by a factor of two with season. Prior to about September 1997, both sets of 
observations show a broad maximum between January and April followed by a sharper 
minimum in late summer. Differences of 10-20% between mean tropospheric mixing 
ratios calculated from the FTS column data and measured CMDL surface mixing ratios 
imply that the CO mixing ratio profile generally decreased with altitude in the 
troposphere during the first third of the year. In contrast, the CO surface and mean 
tropospheric mixing ratios agreed during late summer implying that on average 
tropospheric profile of CO was nearly uniform with altitude during that time. Values 
during other months are intermediate between these two extremes. Daily average partial 
columns of CO and C2H6 are highly correlated during all seasons. The best-fit Mauna 



29 



Loa C2H6/CO slope derived from spectroscopic column measurements and the C2H6-CO 
correlation coefficient are similar to values derived from GTE measurements over the 
western Pacific. The slope of C2H6 vs. CO correlation is intermediate between the lower 
values derived from the station in Lauder, New Zealand (45°S), and the higher value 
derived from solar spectra recorded at Kitt Peak in southern Arizona, U.S.A (32°N). 

The 3.4-16 km columns of the 3 molecules were enhanced beginning in about 
September 1997 with the highest levels observed during November 1997. The largest 
variations relative to background were observed for HCN with values up to a factor of 3 
above background. The observations also indicate that HCN remained elevated up to the 
end of the observation period. Back-trajectory calculations performed for November 
1997 show the low northern latitudes of Asia as the most likely source of the emissions, 
though contributions from other low latitude areas in the northern hemisphere are 
probable due to the relatively long lifetimes of all 3 molecules. As biomass burning is an 
important source for all 3 molecules and widespread burning occurred throughout 
southeast Asia at that time [Liewetai, 1998; UNEP, I999;Levme, 1999], we attribute 
the trace gas enhancements to those fires. Support for this hypothesis also comes from 
the high CO levels and unusual seasonal cycles measured in the tropical south Pacific at 
the surface [Novelli, 1998; CMDL, 1999, section 2.4.2] and at 8-13 km altitude 
[Matsueda et al. , 1 998b] during the same time period. Additionally, our observations 
provide fiirther evidence for HCN as an important though highly fiiel-composition- 
dependent emission product of biomass burning [Lobert et al, 1990, 1991; Yokelsen et 
al, 1996, 1997].

Figure 1. Averaging kernels calculated for CO, CjH^, and HCN. Values are shown for 
merged layers, 3.4-16 km and the total column, 3.4-100 km. 

Figure 2. Sample spectrum and fits in the region of the CO (2-0) band R(3) and R(6) 
lines at 4274.7047 and 4284.891 1 cm''. The measured spectrum was recorded on March 
13, 1997. The spectrum has been normalized to the highest signal in each interval. The 
astronomical zenith angle of the observation is indicated. Residuals (measured minus 
calculated values) are shown on an expanded vertical scale above each spectral plot. The 
measured 3.4-16 km CO column equals 9.99 x lO'"' molecules cm"^

Abstract 

Ti.e series of CO and C,He measurements have been derived fro. high resolution 
infrared solar spectra recorded in Lauder. New Zealand (45.0"S, 169. 7'E. altitude 
0.37 ion) and at the U. S. National Solar Observatory (31.9-N. 111.6-W. altitude 
2.09 km) on Kitt Peak. Lauder observations were obtained between July 1993 and 
November 1997 while the Kitt Peak measurements were recorded between May 1977 
and December 1997. Both databases were analyzed with spectroscopic parameters 
that included significant improvements for C,He relative to previous studies. 
Target CO and C.H^ lines were selected to achieve similar vertical samplings 
based on averaging kernels. These calculations show that partial columns from 
layers extending from the surface to the mean tropopause and from the mean 
tropopause to 100 km are nearly independent. Retrievals based on a semiempirical 
application of the Rodgers optimal estimation technique are reported for the 
lower layer, which has a broad maximum in sensitivity in the upper troposphere. 
The Lauder CO and C^H^ partial columns exhibit highly asymmetrical seasonal 
cycles with minima in austral autumn and sharp peaks in austral spring. The 
spring maxima are the result of tropical biomass burning emissions followed by 
deep convective vertical transport to the upper troposphere and long-range 
horizontal transport. Significant year-to-year variations are observed for both 
CO and C,H,. but the measured trends, (.0.3710.57)% yr- and (-0.64±0.79)% yr^. 
1 Sigma, respectively, indicate no significant long-term changes, n.e Kitt Peak 
data also exhibit CO and C,H, seasonal variations in the lower layer with trends 
equal to (-0.27±0.17)% yr- and (-1.2010.35)% yr-\ 1 sigma. respectively. Hence, 
a decrease in the Kitt Peak tropospheric C,He column has been detected, though 
the CO trend is not significant. Both measurement sets are compared with 
previous observations, reported trends, and three-dimensional model calculations. 



1 . Introduction 
Carbon monoxide (CO) and ethane (C.E,) are important indicators of 
tropospheric pollution and transport because they are emitted primarily by 
anthropogenic sources [Logan et al.. 1981; Rudolph, 1995], they have relatively 
high tropospheric abundances [e.g., Novelli et al., 1992; Blake and Rowland. 
1986], and moderately long tropospheric lifetimes. Hough [1991] used a two- 
dimensional global tropospheric model to estimate mean annual globally averaged 
tropospheric lifetimes of 52 and 59 days for CO and C,He, respectively. These 
lifetimes are significantly shorter than that of CH, (7 years [Hough, 1991]), and 
hence both gases are less well mixed throughout the troposphere than methane 
[e.g.. Reichle et al.. 1986; Singh and Salas. 1982]. However, the lifetimes of 
CO and C,He are long enough for both gases to be possibly influenced by multiple 
sources, over a large region, potentially with different emission fingerprints 
[McKeen et al.. 1996]. Dilution of emissions with "background" air during 
transport from distant source regions (especially during vertical mixing) is an 
important consideration for interpreting measurements at relatively unpolluted 
locations [Singh and Zimmerman. 1992; McKenna et al.. 1995; Smyth et al.. 1996]. 
Both CO and C,He share a common initial, principal tropospheric sink, their 
reaction with OH radicals [Levy, 1971; Crutzen and Gidel. 1983; Ehhalt et al.. 
1986; Rudolph. 1995] and are convenient chemical species for remote sensing of 
anthropogenic activity based on strong spectral signatures in the mid- infrared 
[e.g.. Wallace and Livingston. 1990; Zander et al. 1989; Ehhalt et al.. 1991]. 
These absorptions are readily measured in ground-based solar spectra, even at 
background conditions in the southern hemisphere [e.g., Goldman et al.. 1988; 
Rinsland et al., 1994a; Notholt et al., 1997a].

Nadir-viewing infrared .easure.e„ts of CO were obtained fron, the U.S. Space 
Shuttle in November 1981, October 1984. April 1994, and October 1994 by the 
Measurement of Air Pollution fro» Satellite (MAPS) experiment IReichle et al. , 
1,86- 1990; 1998; »ovelli et al.. 19981, and a few CO and C,He vertical profiles 
have been derived from Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS, Fourier 
transform spectrometer (FTS) infrared solar occultatlon observations in May 1985 
IRlnsland et al. , 1987] and November 1994 [Rlnsland et al. , 1998, , also from the 
U.S. shuttle. Because of the short duration of U.S. shuttle flights, these 
observations provide "snapshots" of the CO and C,H. atmospheric distributions 
with only indirect information about transport, dilution, and the spatial and 
temporal variations of CO and CJi, sources and sinks. 

seasonal variations of CO columns [e.g.. DlanovKlokov and Yurganov, 1989; 
zander et al., 1989; Wallace and Livingston, 1990; Pougatch.v and Rlnsland, 
1995a; Yurganov et al. , 1997; Notholt et al., 1997b, and C,H. columns [e.g., 
Ehhalt et al.. 1991; Rlnsland et al., 1994a,b; Notholt et al., 1997b, have been 
derived from ground-based Infrared solar absorption spectra. These measurements 
complement the spaceborne observations (cited above), airborne spectroscopic 
column measurements [Coffey et al., 1985; Toon et al., 1992), and In situ 
aircraft measurements of CO and C^H. [e.g. Blake et al., 1997; Talbot et al., 
1996; Matsueda et al., 1998, by providing databases covering longer time periods, 
potentially with information on long-term trends free of drifts in calibration 
standards [e.g., Mshleu et al., 1997,. Ground-based solar measurements sample 
a broad altitude range. Hence, they measure plumes of pollution, uplifted by 
deep convection from the surface to the upper troposphere and transported long 
distances from sources by the prevailing winds (Dlckerson et al. . 1987; 
Heintzenberg and Bigg, 1990; Chatfield et al., 1996; Pickering et al., 1996;

„ . J ^,1 IQQRI Such plvimes of pollution, located 

Fuelberg et al. , 1998; Matsueda et al. , 1998 j . bucn pium 

aloft, are not measured by surface level in situ sampling. 

Most of the surface emissions of CO and C,He originate at northern mid to 

high latitudes [Logan et al.. 1981; Khalil and Rasmussen. 1990; KanaUidou et 
al., 1991; Rudolph, 1995; Manning et al., 1997]. Surface sources of CO in this 
latitude range are mainly related to combustion, e.g. automobile exhaust 
emissions, coal and oil burning, and natural gas losses. Ethane surface 
emissions in these latitudes are primarily due to natural gas losses (see Rudolph 

[19951 and the references cited therein).

1998; Manning et .1., 1997, and C,H, [Rudolph et al.. 1989; Rudolph, 1995; 
Clarkson et al. , 1997] . The dominant cause of these variations is the long range 
transport of tropical bio-ass burning surface emissions (e.g., Watson et al., 
1,90; Heinzenberg and Bigg, 1990; Fish»an et al., 1991,. Pea. tropical biomass 
burning north of 5-, usually occurs from March to June and south of the e,uator 
between September and December [Hao and Liu. 1994,. In situ production of CO 
from the oxidation of atmospheric CH. during transport is also an important 

«. =1 19971 but the calculated yield is 
source of CO in the ETSH [Manning et al., 1997,, but tne 

,uite uncertain [Manning et al. , 1997; Conny and Currie, 199S, . although the 

tropospheric mixing ratios of CO and C,He are much higher in the northern 

hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere [e.g.. Logan et al. . 1981, Fig. 9; 

Rudolph, 1995, Fig. 4,, the exchange between the hemispheres is limited by the 

short lifetimes of CO and C^ in the tropics (about 1 month) relative to the 

interhemispheric exchange time (1 to 2 years) [Maiss et al. , 1996; Caller et al. , 



1997; Manning et al.. 1997]. Biogenic emissions of C,Yi, may be important on a 
relative basis in remote regions [Hough. 1991; Zimmerman et al. . 1978; Singh and 

Zimmerman, 1992; Rudolph, 1995]. 

The purpose of this paper is to report multiyear time series of CO and C^Yls 
measurements derived from high resolution infrared solar absorption spectra 
recorded at two remote stations, both located at midlatitudes , one in the 
northern hemisphere and the other in the southern hemisphere. A common set of 
spectroscopic line parameters and analysis procedures were used so that the 
results from the two sites are consistent. Significant improvements in the C,E, 
spectroscopic parameters relative to those assumed in previous studies have been 
incorporated. The observations have been analyzed and characterized with a 
line-by-line, multilayer algorithm based on the semiempirical version of the 
optimal estimation technique. The northern and southern hemisphere CO and C^He 
columns were derived for two nearly independent layers , the lower extending from 
the surface to the altitude of the mean tropopause (12 km for Lauder, 14 km for 
Kitt Peak) and the upper layer extending from the altitude of the mean tropopause 
to 100 km. Here we report and contrast the northern and southern hemisphere 
results for the lower layer. The southern hemisphere measurements were obtained 
with sufficient frequency over a 4.5-year period (1993-1997) to quantify the 
interannual variability of both gases and comment on the suggestion that tropical 
biomass burning may be either increasing [Watson et al., 1990; Houghton, 1991; 
Hao and Liu, 1994; Kim and Newchurch. 1996, 1998] or decreasing [Khalil and 
Rasmussen, 1994]. Rudolph [1995] highlighted C,He as a potentially useful gas 
for that purpose. Owing to their similar lifetimes, the near simultaneous 
observations of CO and C^Hg provide a measure of seasonal changes in the relative 
importance of surface emissions and in situ photochemical CO production from CH, 



6 



oxidation in the tropospheric column. This consideration is particularly 
important for interpreting measurements from the southern hemisphere, where the 
seasonal cycles of C,He and CO destruction by OH are in phase with the seasonal 
dependence of biomass burning [Rudolph et al., 1989]. 

We start with a discussion of the observational database (section 2) and 
the spectral analysis method (section 3). Section 4 describes the spectral 
regions and line parameters adopted in the analysis. As reported in section 5, 
after the initial retrievals were run, an objective procedure was used to remove 
poor quality measurements from the database. Section 6 discusses the error 
analysis and sensitivity studies. The time series of measurements from both 
sites are reported and compared with previous observations and model calculations 
in section 7. Finally, a brief summary of the results is given in section 8. 

2 . Observations 

Infrared observations were recorded at the two sites with different 
instrumentation. Regular infrared observations from Lauder, New Zealand, were 
obtained as part of a program dedicated to the Network for the Detection of 
Stratospheric Change (NDSC) [Kurylo, 1991]. Lauder is a designated primary NDSC 
station. Observations from Kitt Peak are recorded with a facility instrument, 
which is used for laboratory, atmospheric, and astronomical observations in the 
visible and infrared. Kitt Peak has been designated as a complementary NDSC 
station. 



2.1 Lauder database 

The Lauder station (altitude 0.37 km. latitude 45.0'S. longitude 169. 7=E) 
is located in a small town (population -50) in the middle of the south island 
of New Zealand in a region of minimal industrial activity. Local burnoffs occur 
occasionally between about April and September with the majority in August- 
October. Spectra recorded on days of particularly intense local burnoffs were 
examined for the presence of spectral features characteristic of short-lived 
gases emitted by biomass fires (for example, the enhanced IR features studied 
in the fire spectra of Worden et al. [1997]). None were detected. Infrared 
spectral features of NH3 have been observed in the Lauder solar spectra with a 
strong, positive correlation between the emissions and the local surface 
temperature; the most likely source for these emissions is the release of animal 
excretion at local farms during warm, dry surface conditions [Murcray et al.. 
1989]. Hence, except for occasional local farming- related emissions, the Lauder 
site is believed to be representative of background conditions at midlatitudes 

of the southern hemisphere. 

Broadband IR solar absorption spectra were first recorded from Lauder during 
campaigns in 1985. 1986. and 1987 at a resolution of 0.02 cm- [Murcray et al.. 
1989] . These observations covered the 3-5 pm and 8-12 ^m regions only, and hence 
included measurements of C,He. but not CO. These relatively low resolution 
measurements are not included in the present study. Regular high resolution IR 
solar observations did not begin until September 1990. Initially, these 
measurements were obtained with a Bruker model 120-HR FTS . which was replaced 
in September 1992 with a Bruker model 120-M FTS. Observations covering both the 
CO and C,He regions began with the new instrument in July 1993. The 120-M 



8 



spectra are of significantly higher quality than the earlier data, and hence, 
only the 120-M measurements recorded through November 1997 are reported here. 

The Lauder 120-M solar observations were recorded at unapodized resolutions 
of 0.0035 or 0.007 cm"^ (defined as 0.9 divided by the maximum optical path 
difference) with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled InSb detector and a KCl beamsplitter, 
optical filters were used to limit the spectral bandpasses to 1850-2100 cm- (CO 
fundamental band) . 2400 to 3100 cm- (C^H^ .. band) . or 4000 to 4300 cm- (CO 
overtone band) . The time required to record a single full resolution spectrum 
was 104 s. The typical signal-to-noise ratio for full resolution Bruker 120-M 
spectra was about 200:1 near 2000, 2900. and 4200 cm-. Most of the spectra were 
recorded between solar astronomical zenith angles of 45 and 85=. Boxcar 

apodization was applied. 

A major gap in the Lauder measurements occurred between September 1995 
and January 1996 when the 120-M instrument was returned to the manufacturer for 
upgrades and maintenance. Several observational gaps of 2 to 3 months also 
resulted from failures of the HeNe laser, which measures the optical path 

difference. 

instrumental performance varied at Lauder with minor phase errors observable 
in most spectra. Comparisons of ozone lines in the spectra with simulations 
based on correlative ozonesonde profiles [Rinsland et al., 1996] also indicate 
that the instrument line shape function is broader at higher wavenumbers than 
predicted from knowledge of the measurement parameters (maximum optical path 
difference, applied apodization function, and internal field of view). Modeling 
of both of these effects has been incorporated in the spectral analysis as 
described in section 3 . 



2.2 Kltt Peak database 

The McMath-Pierce 1-m maximum optical path difference Fourier transform 
spectrometer [Brault. 1978], on Kitt Peak in southeastern Arizona. U.S.A. 
(altitude 2.09 km. 31.9'N. 111.6'W). is located on a mountaintop in the Sonora 
desert, a semiarid region with sparse population. The FTS is a modified 
Mchelson interferometer capable of observations in the 550-45000 cm- range 
using a selection of different beamsplitters, detectors, and optical bandpass 

filters. 

-n.e measurements included in the analysis were recorded with maximum optical 
path differences greater than 20 cm and solar astronomical zenith angles less 
than 85". Liquid nitrogen cooled InSb detectors at the two output ports of the 
FTS were used. Typical signal-to-noise ratios of full resolution spectra are 
about 200:1, and 150:1 near 2900 and 4200 cm-, respectively. The Kitt Peak 
infrared atmospheric observations are recorded relatively infrequently, typically 
4 runs per year totaling a dozen days, but the database spans 1977 to 1997 with 
excellent uniformity in observational quality. Except for known problems, which 
affect relatively few observations (all of which were eliminated from this 
study) . the measured instrument line shape function agrees with the function 
predicted by theoretical calculations based on the instrumental settings. 

3. Analysis Method 
Th. Louder and Kitt Pe.k spectra «er. analyzed with the snT2 algorith., 
which has been codeveloped at NASA Langley and KI«A Lauder for the retrieval of 
vertical profiles of atmospheric gases fro» ground-based solar absorption 
spectra. The profiles of one or »ore trace gases as well as the column 



10 



abundances of interfering species are retrieved by simultaneously fitting one 
or more microwindows in one or more solar spectra. 

Analyses of IR solar spectra with SFIT2 have been reported by Pougatchev 
et al. [1995b, 1996] and Connor et al. [1996]. The studies of Pougatchev et al. 
[1995b. 1996] included comparisons of the SFIT2 ozone profile retrievals with 

Men ^rttal colujiins of scveral gases 
correlative ozonesonde measurements. Also, total coiumi 

retrieved with SFIT (Rlnsland et al., 1982a, 1984), which has the sa»e forward 
model as SFIT2. have been compared with retrievals fro. the same spectra obtained 
with independently developed NDSC algorithms I Zander et .1., 1993). 

SFIT2 contains all the components required for retrieval of vertical volume 
mining ratio profiles from atmospheric datasets recorded with a ground-based FTS 
m solar absorption mode (refractive atmospheric ray tracing, forward line -by- 
line radiative transfer model, FTS instrument model, solar CO absorption model, 
and the inverse model) . Modeling of Instrumental performance includes parameters 
to simulate symmetric and asy-etric distortions of the Instrumental line shape 
function. 

3 . 1 Forward Model 

Monochromatic transmittances are calculated at a uniform grid spacing of 

<0.0005 cm- With a llne-by-line model that assumes a Voigt shape [Drayson. 1976) 
for lines in all atmospheric levels. Refractive ray tracing [Gallery et al., 
19831 is used to generate density weighted effective temperatures and pressures 
for each of 29 layers with upper and lower model boundaries at the surface and 
100 km. vertical layer thicknesses are set to 2 km up to an altitude of 50 km. 
Higher altitude layer boundaries are at 60. 70, 80, and 100 km. 



11 



The FTS instrument response function is modeled by transforming the 
calculated monochromatic transmittance spectrum to the Fourier domain with a fast 
Fourier transform. The model interferogram is then multiplied by the applied 
apodization function and a function to simulate the decrease in fringe visibility 
with optical path difference due to the finite solid angle of the instrument 
internal field of view [e.g.. Bell. 1972]. In the absence of instrumental 
distortions, the synthetic spectrum is obtained from the inverse Fourier 
transform of the model interferogram. 

SFIT2 incorporates modeling of the combined effects of symmetric and 
asymmetric distortions of the line shape function [Guelachvili. 1981]. Several 
different functional forms have been implemented. Two parameters were introduced 
to model the Lauder data. One parameter is used to model the symmetric line 
shape distortions with the straight-line approximation of the effective 
apodization function [Park. 1983, Eq. 24]. A second parameter is used to model 
the asymmetric line shape distortions assuming a constant phase error [Park. 
1983. section 2B; Guelachvili, 1981. pp. 22]. The Lauder spectra were simulated 
by Fourier transforming the model interferogram (including the simulated 
distortion effects) back to the spectral domain. 

Atmospheric spectroscopic parameters defined in the format of the HITRAN 
database [Rothman et al.. 1998. Table 3] are read by SFIT2. All are used 
including the air pressure -shift coefficient and the coefficient of the 
temperature dependence of the air -broadening coefficient. The isotope code 
number is read to derive the isotopic mass needed to calculate the Doppler width 
in each layer. Because of large fractionation effects in the atmosphere. HDO 
is treated as a separate molecular species. The line intensity in each layer 
is computed from the variations of the rotational and vibrational partition 



12 



functions of the molecule with temperature relative to the reference values at 
296 K [Norton and Rinsland [1991, Eqs . 1-3]. An updated set of molecular 
parameters based on Norton and Rinsland [1991, Table II] is assumed. 

All telluric CO lines are overlapped by absorption from solar CO lines. 
Additional solar CO lines are observable in the solar spectrum because of the 
high solar temperature and the high dissociation energy of CO. A single layer 
at 4500 K is assumed to compute the solar CO lines with the Minnaert empirical 
formula [Kilston, 1975; Rinsland et al., 1982b], given by 

1/R, = 1/R, + 1/(K,U) ^^^ 

where R. is the residual intensity (absorbed fraction of solar continuum 
radiation), R. is the limiting residual intensity. K. is the monochromatic 
absorption coefficient at wavenumber . . and U is the solar CO column abundance. 
Line parameters from HITRAN 1996 [Rothman et al. . 1998] were assumed to calculate 
the solar CO line list at 4500 K. 

We further assume that all solar CO lines have a Voigt line shape with the 
Doppler line width at 4500 K scaled by a multiplicative factor to account for 
microturbulence in the solar atmosphere. The Lorentz width and the 
.icroturbulence scale factor are taken to be the same for all solar CO lines. 
A wavenumber shift parameter is included to account for the differential Doppler 
shift of the solar lines with respect to the telluric lines. In summary, five 
parameters are used in SFIT2 to model the absorption by solar CO lines. The 
parameters are R„ U, the Doppler width multiplicative scale factor, the Lorentz 
width, and the differential wavenumber shift. This model yields calculated solar 
CO lines with absorbances that match the observed values to ±5% or better.

3 . 2 Inverse model 

The inverse method used In SFIT2 assumes the optimal estimation formalism 
of Rodgers [1976] modified on the basis of its semiempirical implementation for 
NDSC microwave profiling of stratospheric O3 [Parrish et al. . 1992; Connor et 
al.. 1995]. Following the nomenclature in these papers, an observing system 
may be defined conceptually by 

(2) 
y - F(x,b) + €y 

where y is the vector of measurements. F is the forward model that characterises 
the measurements in terms of x, the state vector of parameters to be retrieved, 
b is the vector of model parameters which are assumed (not retrieved) . and ., is 
the vector of measurement errors, which are assumed to be normally distributed 

with zero mean. 

The optimal estimation method requires specification of the following 3 
inputs for x: (1) x,. the a priori state vector; (2) S,. the covariance of x.; 
and (3) S,. the covariance of the measurement errors, e,. The parameters to be 
retrieved simulate the target atmospheric absorptions. the interfering 
atmospheric absorptions, and the solar CO absorptions. Parameters are also 
included to model the instrumental performance. 

in practice, the true a priori profile and its covariance are not known, 
in the semiempirical approach to optimal estimation [Parrish et al. . 1992; Connor 
et al., 1995], the selections of the a priori mixing ratio profile is based on 
the best available information. Simulations are then generated and the 
covariance of the a priori state vector is adjusted empirically to yield the 
desired performance, specifically, spectral fits to the noise level of the 
measurements with minimal differences between the input vs. retrieved profiles 



14 



for the altitude range where the technique has sensitivity and avoidance of 
nonphysical oscillations in the retrievals. The simulated data are usually based 
on atmospheric observations, but ideally infinite resolution profiles with the 
true mean profile and covariances are used. 

An additional empirical modification to the method has been applied to set 
the values for the measurement covariance matrix S.. As already noted, formally 
the measurement errors are assumed to have a normal distribution. We further 
assume that S^ is diagonal; i.e. the measurement errors at each wavelength are 

, ,_ • » o»i- €n-r each soectral region on the basis of the 
independent with the variance set for eacn specui<ii. & 

measurement signal-to-noise ratio. 

3.2.1. Atmospheric state parameters. Modeling of the atmospheric state 
requires specification of the target gas a priori mixing ratios in each of the 
29 layers in the atmospheric model. Furthermore, all of the selected spectral 
windows contain significant absorptions by interfering molecules, which were 
individually modeled by either retrieving their vertical profile or by 
.ultiplicatively scaling the a priori volume mixing ratio profile by a single 
factor. selections of intervals for the C,He and CO retrievals are discussed 
in sections 4.1 and 4.2, respectively. 

The a priori atmospheric volume mixing ratio profiles for CO and C,He were 
obtained from several sources. For CO above Lauder, the vertical profile is 
based on the average of aircraft flask air sample measurements obtained during 
the months of April and October over Bass Strait and Cape Grim, Tasmania, and 
analyzed by gas chromatography (L. P. Steele and R. L. Langenfelds, private 
communication, 1997) . These observations have been described by Langenfelds et 
al. [1996] and Pak et al. [1996] and are reported in the NOAA/CMDL 
gravimetrically derived CO scale [Novelli et al. , 1991, 1998] . The two aircraft 



15 



profiles were extended above the highest measurement altitude of 8 km on the 
basis of the April-May 1985 ATMOS measurements at 48'S [Gunson et al.. 1990]. 
The two profiles are plotted in the paper by Pougatchev et al. [1998. Fig. 3]. 
The a priori profile for C^H^ above Lauder was taken as that described by 
Rinsland et al. [1994a] . This profile below 14 km is based on a seasonal average 
of the global two-dimensional model profiles calculated for the latitude of 
Lauder [Kanakidou et al.. 1991, Figure 7]. An exponential decline with a 3 km 
scale height is assumed at higher altitudes based on stratospheric measurements 

(e.g., Rinsland et al. [1987]). 

The CO a priori profile for the Kitt Peak analysis is based on an average 
of tropospheric aircraft samplings at Carr, Colorado (40.9-N. 104.8W) obtained 
between November 1992 and December 1996 [Tans et al. , 1996] and an average of 
3 ATMOS/ATI^S 3 profiles measured at 32=N±r latitude in November 1994 [Gunson 
et al.. 1996]. The Carr measurements, also on the NOAA/CMDL gravimetrically 
derived CO scale [Novelli et al.. 1991, 1998], were used to define the CO a 
priori profile from the surface to 10 km. Observations marked as having analysis 
or sample problems were excluded. The mean ATMOS measurement defines the a 
priori profile between 16 to 100 km. A spline fit was used to smoothly connect 
the two profiles in the intermediate altitude regime. The C^H^ a priori profile 
above Kitt Peak was adopted from the reference listing of midlatitude northern 
hemisphere profiles compiled by Smith [1982]. 

The mixing ratio of CO in the lower stratosphere is fairly constant because 
of its production from the oxidation of CH, is balanced by OH reaction losses, 
in contrast, there is a steep decline in the C,H, volume mixing ratio above the 
tropopause because of reactions with both OH radicals and CI atoms [e.g. . Goldman 
et al.. 1984; Rinsland et al.. 1987]. 



16 



Covariances for the CO and C,He mxing ratio vectors were taken to be 
diagonal. Additionally, we expressed the uncertainties relative to the a priori 
.ixing ratio in the layer. For CO. the diagonal elements in the S, matrix were 
calculated fro. s,, = (k,q.,)^ where q^. is the corresponding element of the CO a 
priori profile and k, equals 0.2 for all layers. This value was tested by 
generating synthetic spectra for a realistic set of atmospheric profiles and 
performing retrievals on the synthetic observations. Figure 1 illustrates a 
comparison for Kitt Peak of 2.09-14 km retrieved columns with the "true" columns. 
The results are based on individual CO profiles from 82 aircraft flights from 
Carr. Colorado during all 4 seasons. Each aircraft profile was extrapolated 
above the flight altitude, as already described. The rms difference between the 
"true" and retrieved CO 0.37-14 km columns is 2.735x10- molecules cm-. 2% of the 
0.37-14 km a priori column. As shown in the figure, there is no systematic bias 
between the "true" and retrieved columns over the full factor of two range in 

the measurements . 

unfortunately, there are no comparable sets of C,He tropospheric profile 

measurements appropriate for the Kitt Peak or Lauder analysis. We selected k,- 

1.0 for all layers. This weak constraint yields a small relative contribution 

of the a priori profile to the retrieval. 

An a priori value of 1.0 and a variance of 0.3 were assumed for the factor 
to multiplicatively scale the a priori mixing ratios to retrieve the total column 
of each molecule with significant interfering absorption. As expected, tests 
show that the a priori variance is a weak constraint (i.e.. the relative 
contribution of the a priori to the retrieval is small) provided that the 
interfering molecule absorbs significantly in the measured spectrum. 



17 
3.2.2. Solar CO parameters. As described in section 3.1, 5 parameters 
are required to model the absorption by solar CO lines with the a priori values 
set on the basis of window -by -window fits to ATMOS exoatmospheric solar spectra, 
except for the solar -atmospheric differential wavenumber shift, which was set 
to zero. The parameter values were assumed uncorrelated (off -diagonal elements 
equal to zero). Very small variances were assumed for R, and U, so that the a 
priori values were adopted in the retrievals. The variances of the other 
parameters were set large enough to make the retrieved values practically 
independent of the a priori settings; hence, the information used in the 
retrieval came almost entirely from the measured spectrum. 

3.2.3. Instrument performance-related parameters. Model parameters 
retrieved in the analysis are the wavelength scale calibration factor, the slope 
of the background (100% transmission line) in each window, and the phase error 
(Lauder data only). A priori values were set to realistic estimates (e.g. , zero 
for the background slope). The individual parameters were assumed to be 
independent (coefficients of off -diagonal elements set to zero). Variances for 
the individual parameters were set to large values to avoid underfitting the 
measured spectrum. The phase error was assumed to be independent of wavenumber 
in the analysis of the Lauder spectra. 

As already mentioned, the Lauder spectra also show an instrument function 
that is broader than the theoretical one with the discrepancy increasing at 
higher wavenumbers. The coefficient of the straight line effective apodization 
parameter used to model the symmetric broadening was assumed, not retrieved. 
The value for the C^Hg region was derived from spectral fits to strong, isolated 
O3 lines near the same wavelength with the vertical O3 profile distribution 
constrained to agree with same day ozonesonde measurements [Rinsland et al . , 



18 



1996] . Based on the measured dependence of the effective apodization coefficient 
with wavenumber (determined in the same way from O3 spectral fittings), an 
extrapolated value was derived for the analysis of the CO (2-0) band lines. The 
coefficient Cq [Park. 1983, Eq. 24] was set to -0.35 at 2976 cm'^ (C^Hg region) 
and -1.0 at 4200 cm"^ (CO region). 

The Kitt Peak instrumental function is close to the theoretical function 

calculated from the instrumental settings at the time of measurement. Hence, 

the theoretical instrument function was assvuned (cq-O.O). 

3.2.4 Additional assumed parameters 

The vertical temperature profiles for Lauder were specified on the basis 
of daily mean National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) measurements 
from to 55 km and smoothly connected to agree with the 1976 U.S. Standard 
Atmosphere above 65 km. The assumed temperature profiles for Kitt Peak are based 

on a similar procedure. 

The vertical volume mixing ratio profiles for the interfering molecules were 
assumed from previous observations near the same locations or compilations of 
reference profiles (e.g., Smith [1982]). 

4.0. Spectral Windows and Line Parameters 

Selections of the spectral intervals for analysis were based on 4 
considerations: (1) the availability of target gas spectral features with 
minimal interferences from other atmospheric and solar lines, (2) the quality 
of the available spectroscopic line parameters, (3) a minimal sensitivity of the 
target spectral features to errors in the vertical temperature profile, and (4) 
a similar vertical sampling of the atmosphere. The last criterion was dictated 
by the goal of comparing same day CO and C^E^ tropospheric measurements to take 



19 



advantage of their very similar tropospheric lifetimes with common principal 
destruction via reactions with OH radicals [e.g., Kanakidou et al. , 1991, Fig. 

4; Law and Pyle, 1993, Fig. 1]. 

The selection of the spectral intervals was also constrain by the existence 
of only relatively weak absorption features of C^Hg in ground-based infrared 
solar absorption spectra. The most favorable ones for remote sensing are the 
sharp PQ3 and -Qo subbranches of the u, perpendicular band at 3 pm [e. g. , Ehhalt 
et al.. 1991; Rinsland et al., 1994a.b] . Lines of CO with a wide range of 
absorption depths are present in ground-based solar spectra. 

Averaging kernels provide a direct assessment of the theoretical altitude 
sensitivity for an observing system in the absence of errors in the measurements 
and the model parameters [Rodgers, 1990, section 4]. They show explicitly how 
the true profile is smoothed in producing the retrieved profile. A perfect 
measurement system would sample the intended altitude region uniformly with no 
smoothing; put another way, the averaging kernel for each altitude would be a 

5 -function. 

Figure 2 presents partial column averaging kernels for Lauder profile 

retrievals of C^H^ (top) and CO (bottom) obtained with the selected parameters. 

The assumed a priori volume mixing ratio profiles, S. covariance matrices. 

spectral intervals, and spectroscopic parameters are described in sections 4.1 
and 4.2. The calculated kernels also depend on the signal-to-noise ratio and 
the spectral resolution of the measurements [Connor et al., 1996]. Typical 
Lauder observation values of 200 and 0.0035 cm"^ were assumed, respectively. The 
kernels for partial columns were first generated for the 29 layer atmospheric 
model, then combined to derive the curves for 0.37-12, 12-100, and the total 
column, 0.37-100 km. The boundary at 12 km was selected to correspond with the 



20 



average altitude of the tropopause above Lauder. The Lauder tropopause height 
varies between about and 17 km (G. Bodeker, NIWA Lauder, private communication, 
1997). Similarly, the Kitt Peak observations were analyzed in two layers, 2.09- 
14 km and 14-100 km, with the boundary selected to correspond the approximate 
average altitude of the tropopause above Kitt Peak. 

The Lauder partial column averaging kernels for the two layers (long and 
short dashed curves in Fig. 2) show little overlap with well separated peaks for 
the lower and upper layers with maxima at altitudes of 10.9 and 32.7 km for C^Hg 
and 8.0 and 34.2 km for CO, respectively. Hence, the atmosphere is being 
sampled for C^H, and CO with similar vertical sensitivities, and the measurements 
of the two regions are nearly independent of each other. The CO calculations 
in Fig. 2 are based on profile retrievals from two weak lines, the R(3) and R(6) 
transitions of the (2-0) band. 

Figure 3 shows the vertical sampling achieved for CO above Lauder with 
alternate spectral selections for CO and a different retrieval method. The upper 
panel shows CO partial column averaging kernels calculated for profile retrievals 
from the CO R(3) (1-0) line at 2157.2997 cm'^ This line is two orders of 
magnitude stronger than the two CO lines used for the Fig. 2 CO calculations. 
The partial column averaging kernel for the 0.37-12 km layer peaks at 5.5 km. 
The reduced sensitivity to profile changes in the 12.0-100 km layer results from 
absorption saturation near line center. The lower panel of Fig. 3 presents CO 
partial column averaging kernels obtained from the two weak CO lines used in Fig. 
2, but the retrievals were performed by multiplicatively scaling the a priori 
mixing ratio in all 29 model layers by a single factor. The 0.37-12 km and 12.0- 
100 km kernels both peak at 32.6 km with poor sensitivity to CO molecules in the 



21 
troposphere. Although not shown, results for C^H^ and the multiplicative scaling 
method are similar (the C^E^ absorption is weak). 

Results for the Kitt Peak partial and total columns are similar to those 
presented in Figs. 2 and 3 . The spectral windows, molecular and solar 
interferences, assumed spectroscopy, and the SFIT2 parameter settings are 
discussed for each molecule in the following 2 subsections. 

4 . 1 Ethane 

The retrieval C^n^ layer column abundances from the Lauder and Kitt Peak 
spectra is based on the analysis of the ^Q, subbranch of the ^, band at 2976.8 
cm-^ This feature is prominent in high resolution infrared solar spectra and 
has been used frequently for quantification of C^Hg atmospheric amounts. In the 
present work, we report significant updates to the spectroscopy in the 2976.8- 

cm~^ region. 

Pine and Stone [1996] reported the analyses of the PQ3 and ^Qo C^H^ 
subbranches from Doppler- limited and air-broadened laboratory spectra recorded 
at 161±5 and 29611 K and sub-Doppler resolution molecular beam C^H^ spectra 
recorded at an effective temperature of 50 K. The results of their -Q, analysis 
yielded measured positions for individual transitions up to J=16 in the A 
torsional state and J-IS in the E torsional state. A.-A^-type doublet splittings 
were measured for J>8 and modeled with a power- series expansion in J(J+1) . Also, 
air broadening coefficients and pressure shift coefficients in air were measured 
at 161 and 296 K [Pine and Stone, 1996, Table 1]. A single Lorentz air 
broadening coefficient and a single air -broadened, pressure -induced shift 
coefficient were found to fit the absorption by all lines at 161 and 296 K. The 
.asured Lorentz coefficient of 0.6708±0 .0043 cm"^ atm"^ at 296 K and a 



mei 



22 



temperature dependence coefficient n of 1.01±0.03, with n equal to 
ln(.(T)/7(To)/ln(To/T)) for To equal to 296 K. were derived from the air- 
broadening data at the two temperatures. These values are significantly lower 
and higher, respectively, than values of 0.09 or 0.10 cm- atm- at 296 K and 0.75 
assumed previously in our ground-based spectroscopic studies of C^H^ from Mauna 
Loa and Lauder [Rinsland et al., 1994a,b] . A value of zero for the pressure 
shift coefficient of all C^H^ lines has been assumed in previous analyses of 

atmospheric solar spectra. 

In the present work, we assumed C,He ^Qa subbranch line parameters from the 
work of Pine and Stone [1996] with extensions to include most of the additional 
lines in the region (see Pine and Stone [1996], Fig. 9 for a 296 K measurement- 
calcuation comparison without the additional lines) . Also, absolute intensities 
have been derived from the average of two sets of laboratory measurements. We 

summarize the results here. 

The prominent but previously unidentified feature in the Doppler- limited 

lab data [Pine and Stone, 1996] near 2976.855 cm- has been assigned to the ., 

^u,-u, PQ3 subbranch. Positions were calculated from Eq. 1 of Pine and Stone 
[1996] assuming manually adjusted values of u, for the A and E torsional states 

and a single value for AB (AD, AH. and A, were set to zero). Relative 
intensities were calculated from the equations and parameters of Dang-Nhu et al. 
[1984] with 289 cm- added for the vibrational energy of the v, torsional state 
[Duncan et al., 1983; Moazzen-Ahmadi et al., 1988, 1992]. The calculated 
intensity of the hot band PQ3 subbranch with respect to the intensity of the ., 
PQ3 subbranch was scaled by 0.8 to match the observed absorptions at 161 and 296 
K. The relative intensities and shapes of both features are well reproduced at 
the two temperatures with these parameters. Lines of u, and .3 ^ -n were added 



23 



to the linelist based on the positions and assignments of Pine and Lafferty 
[1982. Table 2] and the intensity expressions and parameters of Dang-Nhu et al. 
[1984] . The new linelist accounts for most of the absorptions observed in the 
PQ3 region at 161 and 296 K. Furthermore, it is apparent from plots of the 
measured versus calculated spectra that resonance mixing perturbs the positions 
and intensities of several assigned lines in the interval. Figure 4 presents 
comparisons of the measured and calculated Doppler- limited C^Hg laboratory 
spectra at temperatures of 161 and 296 K. 

Absolute intensities were derived from an unweighted average of values 
calculated from the intensity expressions and parameters of Dang-Nhu et al. 
[1984] and a set of intensities inferred from the laboratory measurements of 
Pine and Stone [1994]. The results from the more recent measurements are 0.955 
times the earlier ones. The discrepancy of the two intensity values primarily 
reflects the uncertainties in the pressure measurements , at low temperatures in 
the older study and at low pressure in the newer. The measurements of Rinsland 
et al. [1986] were not considered because of their low spectral resolution (0.06 

cm"^). 

The new CzHg spectroscopic parameters adopted here are a significant 
improvement relative to those assumed in our previous atmospheric studies 
[Rinsland et al. , 1987; Rinsland et al. , 1994a.b] . The previous model neglected 
torsional tunneling and A.-A^ splittings. Also, we previously assumed a 296 K 
Lorentz broadening coefficient «30% larger than the value measured for PQ3 by 
Pine and Stone [1996]. Further work to estimate the lower state energies of 
unassigned lines in the vicinity of the PQ3 subbranch, obtain an improved 
description of the intensity perturbations in the region, and calculate the 



24 

temperature dependent C^Hg partition function with improved accuracy is in 

progress . 

Except for CzHg, the spectroscopic parameters were taken from the 1996 
HITRAN compilation [Rothman et al.. 1998]. The weak temperature-sensitive 
absorption by the H^^O line at 2976.7839 cm"^ (lower state energy of 1574.679 
cm-^) directly overlaps the PQ3 CjHe subbranch. Parameters for this Hz^^O line 
were added in HITRAN 1996 [Rothman et al.. 1998]. Hence, no update was 

necessary. 

Figure 5 presents molecule -by-molecule simulations and a typical Lauder 
spectrum in the region of the unresolved PQ3 subbranch. The C^Hg retrievals 
reported in this paper are based on the fits to the 2976 . 62-2976. 94-cm-i interval 
shown in the figure. The importance of accurate modeling of the interferences, 
particularly H2O, at the low altitude of the Lauder station is evident, as was 
noted previously [Rinsland et al., 1994a]. Four molecules were fitted in this 
window: CA. H^O, CH,. and O3. Only the profile of C^Hg was retrieved; a 
multiplicative a. priori volume mixing ratio profile scaling factor was retrieved 
for each of the other 3 gases. The phase error and zero absorption level were 
also fitted in the Lauder spectra. A sample Lauder fit is presented in Figure 

6. 

The PQ3 C^Hg region of the Kitt Peak spectra is similar to the sample Lauder 
observations shown in Figs. 5 and 6 . However, the interference by HjO is 
significantly weaker because of the higher altitude of Kitt Peak. Columns of 
C^Hg obtained with the new line parameters are 13% less than values obtained with 
the parameters assumed previously [Rinsland et al. , 1994a,b] . 



25 



4.2 Carbon Monoxide 

The retrievals are based on spectral fittings of 2 intervals containing the 
i^co R(3) and R(6) (2-0) band lines at 4274.7047 and 4284.8911 cuT^ respectively. 
Figure 7 illustrates the intervals for a sample Lauder spectrum along with 
simulations for H,0, HDO, CO. CH,. and solar CO. The selected intervals avoid 
CH, octad lines not included in HITRAN 1996 [Rothman et al., 1998] and yield 
compatible simultaneous spectral fittings. An unpublished line list shows the 
importance of the CH, lines missing from HITRAN 1996 [Rothman et al.. 1998] in 
other portions of the the 4200-4300-cm-^ region (J.-C Hilico, private 

communication, 1997) . 

The HITRAN 1996 parameters [Rothman et al.. 1998] adopted for the CO 
analysis include CH, positions and intensities from Brown and Rothman [1982] with 
accuracies for single, unblended lines of ±0.0005 cm"^ and ±2%. respectively. 
Air-broadening coefficients and pressure -shift coefficients at 296 K based on 
the work of Malathy Devi et al. [1993] were assumed for CH, as given on HITRAN 
1996 [Rothman et al.. 1998]. A weak, unassigned absorption appears at 4274.81 
cm-^ in the Lauder and Kitt Peak spectra. A line of HDO was added at this 
position. The retrievals satisfactorily reproduce this weak feature for the 
range of observational conditions. 

The R(3) (2-0) band terrestrial line in the 4274. 62-4274. 82-cm-^ spectral 
interval is overlapped by absorption from the corresponding solar CO transition 
with only minor interferences from other gases in the interval. The 4284.75- 
4285.18 cm-^ spectral interval contains the R(6) terrestrial CO line, several 
solar CO lines, and the strong CH, line at 4285.1553 cm'^ The retrievals were 
performed by fitting for the vertical profiles of both CO and CH, . A 
multiplicative a priori HDO volume mixing ratio profile scaling factor was also 



26 

,-1 



retrieved to account for variations in the absorption by the 4274. Sl-cm"^ line. 
An example of a simultaneous fit to the two CO windows in a typical Kitt Peak 
spectrxim is presented in Fig. 8. 

5.0 Measurement selection criteria 

The quality control of retrieved profiles was based on a combination of 
criteria that measure the goodness of fit and the relative strength of the target 
absorption feature. The first criterion is the familiar root -mean- square error 
(rms) between the measured and fitted spectra in the selected intervals. The 
latter, called the signal strength ratio (ssr) . is the observed depth of the 
target absorption feature relative to the noise measured in a nearby window 
region. It serves the purpose of identifying spectra in which the target feature 
is too weak to be measured accurately. As illustrated in Fig. 9, a plot of rms 
versus ssr produces a scatter plot with points that define an elbow- shaped curve. 
Values for the maximum rms and minimum ssr are selected near the "elbow" of this 
curve to weed out unreliable retrievals. As a final step, all profiles that pass 
the rms/ssr criteria are displayed on a single plot, and any further profiles 
that are clearly unacceptable (large negative mixing ratio excursions, for 
example), are removed. This second step generally deletes only about 5% of the 
remaining measurements, which for a variety of reasons, including poorly modelled 
interferences, channel spectra, and unwanted instrumental artifacts, produce 
instabilities in the retrieval process. 

6.0 Error Analysis 

In Table 1, we report our estimates of the effects of both random and 
systematic errors on the retrieved lower layer CO and C^Hg partial columns. A 
single value is given for the two stations where appropriate. We next describe 



27 



the procedures and assumptions used in generating the uncertainty estimates. 
6.1. Temperature profile. As already noted, the analysis regions were 
selected to contain target lines with intensities insensitive to temperature, 
and all retrievals were performed assuming NCEP temperature profiles calculated 
for the date and location of the observations. We generated synthetic spectra 
for 3 randomly selected days assuming the nominal temperature profile. 
Retrievals were then performed by adding 2 K to the temperature at each altitude. 
The magnitude of the mean difference between the true and retrieved partial 
column is shown in the table; the errors are 1% or less for C^Hg and CO. 

6.2. Noise. Random numbers with zero mean, a normal distribution, and a 
root-mean-square deviation equal to 0.5% of the maximum transmission were added 
to synthetic spectra generated for the C,E, and CO analysis regions. The 
simulated noise is typical of the individual Lauder and Kitt Peak spectra. Ten 
different seeds were chosen. The retrieved partial columns show no bias with 
respect to the true partial columns. As shown in the table, the average 
difference between the noisy and true partial columns range from 2 to 7%. Note 
that daily averaging further reduces errors due to random instrument noise for 

both Lauder and Kitt Peak. 

6.3. Interfering atmospheric lines. As mentioned in section 4.1 and 
illustrated in Fig. 5, H^O is an important interfering molecule with absorption 
overlapping the target C^H^ ^Qa ^'y band subbranch. The two windows selected for 
CO contain only minor absorptions by atmospheric molecules. 

6.4. Spectroscopic parameters. We estimated a 2% uncertainty in the 
retrievals due to spectroscopic parameters errors in the two microwindows 
analyzed for CO. This small error estimate is based on the high quality of the 
CO parameters in the HITRAN 1996 compilation [Rothman et al., 1998] and our 



28 
avoidance of intervals containing poorly-modeled, interfering CH, lines. The 
spectroscopic updates incorporated for C,He in the present analysis are estimated 
to reduce the errors in the C,He retrievals from 10% [Rinsland et al., 1994a] to 
5% with the main source of error the uncertainty in the laboratory pressure 

measurements . 

6.5. State vector of unknowns. The retrieval is a linear combination of 

the true and a priori profiles with structures finer than the measurement 

vertical resolution poorly determined [Connor et al. . 1995] . Although we do not 

know the true C,H, and CO atmospheric profiles on the dates of observation. 

simulations based on correlative observations can be used to show the dependence 

of the retrieval on the a priori profile and the assumed S, and S, covariances. 

AS illustrated in Fig. 1. retrievals from synthetic spectra generated from a set 

of correlative vertical profiles and the adopted settings yield partial columns 

that track the values adopted in the simulations with no deviations from 

linearity over the factor of two range in the CO 2.09-14 km a priori partial 

columns. Based on these results, we estimate 1% as the error in the lower layer 

partial column retrieval due the influence of the a priori profile and the other 

state vector parameters . 

6.6. Instrument line shape function. A synthetic spectrum was calculated 
for the most common spectral resolution of the Lauder observations. The 
theoretical instrument line shape function was assumed. A retrieval was 
performed from this spectrum with the coefficient of the "straight line- 
effective apodization coefficient [Park. 1983] decreased from the nominal value 
of 0.0 to -0.1. This case simulates apodization function error that increases 
linearly from zero at zero path difference to 10% at the maximum optical path 
difference. Changes of 0.1% in the tropospheric layer partial columns of CO and 



29 
C^Hg were obtained. The Kitt Peak instrument function is well determined so that 
instrument function errors are negligible for both molecules. The Lauder CO and 
C2H6 0.37-12 km partial columns are much less sensitive to errors in the 
instrument function than those derived for the Lauder O3 0.37-12 km column 
[Pougatchev et al., 1996, Table 1]. 

6.7. Forward model. The forward model in SFIT2 is essentially the same 
as in SPIT and the algorithms developed at NASA Langley for the analysis of 
infrared laboratory [Benner et al., 1995] and infrared solar spectra recorded 
with Fourier transform spectrometers [Norton and Rinsland, 1991]. Based on 
retrieval comparison exercises that have been performed for atmospheric and 
laboratory studies [e.g. Zander et al. , 1993], we estimate that errors in 
simulated solar spectra generated with the SFIT2 forward model are unlikely to 
introduce C^H^ and CO lower layer partial column retrieval errors greater than 
4% for CO and 2% for C^Hg. The larger value was assumed for CO because of the 
additional uncertainty caused by errors in simulating the absorption by solar 
CO lines in the windows. 

7. Results and Discussion 

For Lauder. 0.37-12 km partial vertical columns were calculated by 
integrating the retrieved profiles. For Kitt Peak, the 2.09-14 km partial 
columns were computed. Daily averages were generated assuming equal weights for 
all observations; the number of observations per day ranged from 1 to 23 for 
Lauder C^Hg. and the number of observations per day ranged from 1 to 25 for 
Lauder CO. For Kitt Peak, the corresponding ranges of daily observations were 
1 to 13 and 1 to 14. 



30 
The daily average partial columns C^ were fitted with the expression 

Ct = ao + ai (t - to) + a2 cos 2^ [(t - t^) - tj (3) 

where ao is the mean value, t is the time of the observation in calendar years, 
to is the time of the first observation in calendar years, a^ is the long-term 
trend, aj is the amplitude of the seasonal cycle (assumed to be sinusoidal), and 
ti is the fraction of the calendar year corresponding to the time of the seasonal 
maximum. 

7.1 Lauder CzHg and CO 0.37-12 tan Time Series 

The top and middle panels of Fig. 10 present the measured Lauder daily 
average 0.37-12 km CjHg and CO partial columns between July 1993 to November 
1997. The total number of measurement days are 407 for CzHg and 390 for CO. The 
solid curves show the best- fits to the observations based on Eq. 3. This simple 
model does a poor job in reproducing the observed highly asymmetrical C^E^ and 
CO seasonal cycles, which show sharp peaks during austral spring and deep minima 
in austral autumn. Corresponding, peak column- average 0.37-12 km mixing ratios 
(shown on the right vertical axis) exceeded 0.6 ppbv for C^H^ and 100 ppbv for 
CO. The maximum mixing ratios are as high as measurements in upper tropospheric 
continental outflow regions between Brazil and Africa during September-October 
1992 [Talbot et al, 1996, Tables 2 and 3] . Year-to-year differences are apparent 
in the Lauder time series with particularly high 0.37-12 km partial CO and C^Hg 
columns observed during October 1994, August 1995, and September -October 1997. 
We attribute the sharp peaks to tropical biomass burning emissions lofted 
to the upper troposphere by deep convection. In the upper troposphere, where 
the present measurements have their highest sensitivity (Fig. 2), maximum wind 



31 



speeds exceeded 40 m s'^ in the southern subtropical jet stream (~30"S latitude) 
during the September-October 1996 Pacific Exploratory Mission-Tropics (PEM-T) 
experiment [Fuelberg et al. , 1998]. Although typical PEM-T upper tropospheric 
wind speeds were lower, calculations indicate that the strong, westerly upper 
tropospheric winds were sufficient to transport southern hemisphere air parcels 
thousands of km on a time scale of about a week during the mission [Fuelberg et 
al., 1998]. Once lofted to the upper troposphere, only relatively minor 
oxidative losses of CO and C^H, occur due to the rapid horizontal transport of 

the emitted plumes. 

No statistically significant long-term trend were detected from the Lauder 
C^Hg or CO measurement databases. The best-fit trends (a^/ao of Eq. 3) for C^Hg 
and CO from daily means between July 1993 and November 1997 are (-0.6410.79)% 
yr-^ and (0.37±0.57)% yr-\ 1 sigma. respectively. Recently, Matsueda et al. 
[1998] reported a series of upper tropospheric CO mixing ratios measured in situ 
during commericial aircraft flights at longitudes of 140'E to 152=E and latitudes 
30"N to 30-5 (Japan-Australia). A rate of CO decrease of about 5 ppbv yr"^ was 
derived from a fit to the 5°S to 30»S latitude observations during the 58 
sampling flights between July 1994 and June 1996. 

Ratios of the C^Hg/CO 0.37-12 km daily averages are presented in the bottom 
panel of Figure 10 for the 332 Lauder observation days in common. This plot 
illustrates that larger relative seasonal changes are observed for C^H^ than for 
CO with the seasonal variation of the C^He/CO 0.37-12 km partial columns ratios 
roughly in phase with the seasonal variations of both gases. The Lauder peak 
C,He/CO columns ratio is close to the value of 6.0 x 10"^ measured directly over 
(< 1 km) active savanna fires in Brazil and Zambia during the same season 
(September-October 1992 observations), but our peak value is significantly lower 



32 
than the enhanced, upper tropospheric ratio of 12.1 x lO'^ determined in the 
upper troposphere over the south Atlantic basin during the same time period 
[Talbot et al. , 1996]. 

Time series of CzHg and CO surface measurements of clean marine air at 
Baring Head, New Zealand (41. 2 "S, 174. 5 °E) have been reported recently [Clarkson 
et al.. 1997; Manning et al., 1997]. The Baring Head facility is a remote 
station located on the edge of an 80 -m cliff overlooking Cook Strait at the 
southern tip of the North Island [Brenninkmeijer, 1993; Clarkson et al., 1997]. 
We next compare these in situ measurements with mean 0.37-12 km mixing ratios 
derived from our spectroscopic time series. 

A sine curve fit to Baring Head CzHg monthly mean measurements collected 
during southerly winds (to avoid local land sources of pollution) and from 
measurements at Scott Base, Antarctica (77.5=S, 166. 4°E) between 1991 and 1996 
yields a peak CaHg mixing ratio of about 0.4 ppbv in September and a minimum of 
about 0.15 ppbv in March [Clarkson et al. , 1997. Fig. 3a] , though this curve does 
not capture the relatively high measurements (0.4-0.6 ppbv) common in the Baring 
Head data between January and May. The January-May peaks are not seen in the 
Lauder spectroscopic data. The Baring Head surface CzHg measurements are 
generally lower than the Lauder 0.37-12 km column average mixing ratios, and the 
Baring Head measurements do not show the sharp peaks present in the September - 
October Lauder spectroscopic observations. 

The June 1989 to June 1995 monthly average CO mixing ratios at Baring Head 
show median values ranging from 42 ppbv in March to 65 ppbv in October [Manning 
et al., 1997, Fig. 1]. The authors comment that while interannual variability 
was observed, no statistically significant CO trend was detected. As for CzHg, 
the Lauder CO 0.37-12 km column- averaged mixing ratio show a seasonal cycle with 



33 
maxima and minima at times close to those inferred from the Baring Head in situ 
data, but again, our spectroscopic 0.37-12 km daily mean CO mixing ratios show 
sharp September-October peaks not present in the monthly -averaged surface 

measurements from Baring Head. 

Insight into differences between the Lauder and Baring Head measurements 
can be obtained from a climatology of CO aircraft measurements obtained over 
southeast Australia [Pak et al. , 1996] . Although this location is quite far from 
New Zealand, there are no major surface sources in either region, and long range 
transport can be expected to bring gases originating at a similar set of distant 
surface sites to these sites. The aircraft CO measurements show tropospheric 
mixing ratios that increase with altitude throughout the year with the range of 
the average seasonal cycles increasing with altitude. Increases in CO occur in 
July and August prior to the observed mixing ratio peak [Pak et al. , 1996] . The 
range in the average CO seasonal cycle above Cape Grim is observed to increase 
with altitude. The Lauder data do not show the secondary mixing ratio maximum 
observed in March and April above Cape Grim in CO. CH,, and N^O [Pak et al., 

1996]. 

Tables 2 and 3 list the Lauder monthly average 0.37-12 km CO and C^Hg 
columns calculated by averaging the 1993 to 1997 daily means. The listings give 
the mean characteristics of the temporal variations over this time period, but 
they do not capture the sharp peaks during austral spring nor do they show the 
distinct year-to-year differences in the partial columns. 

To our knowledge, the only correlative measurements were obtained by the 
nadir-viewing MAPS gas correlation radiometer instrument [Reichle et al. , 1990] . 
Measurements of CO obtained by the MAPS sensor in April and October 1994 have 
been analyzed to derive equivalent CO total columns above sites performing 



34 



correlative observations, including the Lauder station [Pougatchev et al. , 1998] . 
The MAPS measurements, which have an estimated accuracy of about ±10% [Pougatchev 
et al., 1998], correspond to total CO columns above Lauder in April and October 
of 1.24 and 1.62 (in W molecule cm'^) , respectively. The averages of our 
retrieved daily mean total CO columns from observations during the April and 
October 1994 MAPS missions equal 0.95 and 1.30 (in lO" molecule cm'^) . 
respectively. Our values average 0.78 times the corresponding MAPS values 
despite the similarity of our total column averaging kernel (Fig. 2) to the MAPS 
total column averaging kernel [Pougatchev et al.. Fig. 2]. We note that our 
April and October 1994 total columns are 0.92 and 0.94 times those deduced from 
analysis of Lauder correlative solar spectral measurements of the ^^CO (1-0) band 
R(3) line by Pougatchev et al. [1998], respectively. The averaging kernel for 
spectroscopic measurements from this strong line (based on multiplicative scaling 
of the CO a priori profile) decrease with altitude from a maximum of 1.5 at the 
surface to 0.8 at 8 km [Pougatchev et al., 1998, Fig. 2]. The offsets between 
the two independently-derived spectroscopic correlative total columns may reflect 
inaccuraties in the spectroscopic parameters, errors in modeling the overlapping 
solar CO lines (particularly for the weak lines analyzed in this study) . and/or 
the differences in the vertical sensitivities of the measurements at the moment 
of the observations, as demonstrated by their averaging kernels. The cause of 
the larger differences between the two sets of spectroscopic total columns and 
the total columns inferred from the correlative MAPS measurements may reflect 
the strong, irregular spatial and temper ial variations of atmospheric CO above 
Lauder (e.g. Fig. 10), and the differences in the times and locations of these 
measurement sets . 



35 



7.2 Kltt Peak CJ&e »"<* ^0 2.09-14 km time series 

Figure 11 illustrates the time series of Kitt Peak 2.09-14 km C2H6 and CO 
daily average measurements between May 1977 and December 1997 . The total number 
of valid measurement days were 95 for C^Hg and 150 for CO with the number of 
measurements per day varying from 1 to 14 for CO and from 1 to 13 for C^H^. The 
results, displayed in the same format as Figure 10, show a distinct seasonal 
cycle for both molecules with spring maxima and autumn minima. Significant 
deviations from the best-fit curves were observed on several days. The trends 
(ai/ao of Eq. 3) determined from fitting the C2H6 and CO daily mean 2.09-14 km 
columns are (-1.20±0.35) and (-0.2710. 17)% yV^ 1 sigma, respectively. Mean 
Kitt Peak 2.09-14 km CjHg and CO mixing ratios are 1.08 and 103 ppbv, 
respectively. Corresponding Lauder 0.37-12 km values from the 1993 to 1997 
dataset are 0.32 and 57 ppbv. Hence, the mean C^n^ and CO tropospheric mixing 
ratios are higher in the northern hemisphere dataset relative to the southern 
hemisphere dataset by factors of 3.4 and 1.8, respectively. 

Table 4 and 5 list the monthly mean partial CO and C2H6 columns for the 
2.09-14 km layer. Unfortunately, the total number of measurement days is 
significantly fewer than obtained from Lauder. A plot of the Kitt Peak monthly 
averages from Table 5 shows the CO seasonal variation is asymmetrical with the 
amplitude of the spring maximum larger than amplitude of the autumn minimum. 
This conclusion is consistent with the results of Pougatchev and Rinsland 
[1995a], who analyzed the Kitt Peak measurements with a different retrieval 
method. The CzHg measurements show no clear evidence of an asymmetry in the 
annual cycle. Note that only a single CzHg measurement was obtained during 
August. 



36 
A substantial downward trend over this time period is indicated for CzHe, 
but not for CO. In contrast, Ehhalt et al. [1991] reported C^He column 
abundances deduced from the analysis of infrared solar spectra recorded at the 
the International Scientific Station of the Jungfraujoch (ISSJ, 46.55'N, 7.98''E, 
3580 m altitude). An exponential tropospheric CzHg column increase rate of 
(0.85±0.3)% yr'^ was deduced by comparing 1984-1988 measurements with low 
spectral resolution measurements from March and April 1951. More recent (1985 
to 1995) measurements of CaHg total columns above the ISSJ indicate a mean 
exponential trend equal to (-3.6±0.4)% yr-\ 1 sigma, which reduces to a trend 
of (-2.7±0.3)% yr'\ 1 sigma, when fitting the observations with a model that 
includes a sine function to account for the seasonal variations [Mahieu et al. , 

1997]. 

Wallace and Livingston [1990] derived CO total columns above Kitt Peak by 
fitting two lines of the (2-0) band in solar spectra recorded between 1979 and 
1985. A seasonal cycle with a spring maximum and autumn minimum was observed 
with no obvious long-term trend. No long-term CO trend was assumed in the 
analysis of Kitt Peak CO observations reported by Pougatchev and Rinsland [1995] . 
Although an average CO total column increase rate of about 1% yr" has been 
reported from infrared solar spectroscopic measurements above central Europe from 
1950-1951 to 1985-1987 [Zander et al., 1989] and above Zvenigorod, Russia, for 
1970-1995 [Yurganov et al., 1997], surface measurements at remote sites in both 
hemispheres show a shift from an upward CO trend during the 1980s to a downward 
trend in the 1990s [Khalil and Rasmussen, 1994]. The mean trend deduced from 
the Kitt Peak 1977-1997 CO measurements is consistent with the northern 
hemisphere 1987-1992 average linear trend of (-1.4±0.9)% yr"^ reported from 
surface in situ measurements [Khalil and Rasmussen, 1994, Table 1]. More recent 



37 



surface measurements from a global network of surface stations show an average 
northern hemisphere CO surface trend of about -0.5 ppbv yr"^ between 1994 and 
April 1997 (M. A. K. Khalil, private communication, 1998). Fits derived from 
April 1993 to March 1996 upper tropospheric CO aircraft measurements obtained 
between Japan and Australia show a downward trend of about 2 ppbv yr'^ at 
northern hemisphere latitudes [Matsuda et al., 1998]. 

The features observed in the northern hemisphere CO surface and upper 
tropospheric measurements, in particular the trend reversal since the late 1980s, 
have been noticed in the CO total columns monitored above the ISSJ between 1984 
and 1995. i.e. a mean exponential rate of change of (-0.5410.25)% yV^ 1 sigma; 
the negative rate is maintained but reduced to (-0.18±0.16)% yr"^ when fitting 
the observations with a function combining a sinusoidal and an exponential 
component [Mahieu et al. , 1997] . It should be noted that the CO column minima, 
which occur above the ISSJ around mid- September , were record low in 1992 and 
1993, i.e. , during two years following the Mt. Pinatubo volcanic eruption of June 
1991. 

7.3 Correlations between CO and CjHg 

The number of Lauder observations is sufficient to examine the correlation 
between CO with C^Hg as a function of season. Table 7 presents correlation 
coefficients and slopes derived by fitting the Lauder 1993-1997 CO and C,E, daily 
mean 0.37-12 km partial column observations to the expression 

[CzHg] = a + b [CO] ^^^ 

where [] denotes the daily- average value. 



38 
As expected from the bottom panel of Fig. 10, the minimum value of b is 
measured early in the calendar year. This time period shows the lowest 
correlation between the partial columns of the two species. Table 7 also reports 
corresponding values derived by fitting all the Kitt Peak 2.09-14 km measurements 
with Eq. 4. The correlation coefficient of 0.77 is only slightly less than the 
peak seasonal value derived for Lauder while b is several times higher than the 
corresponding value for Lauder. 

Slopes derived from fits to Eq. 3 with model calculated columns computed 
for the locations of Lauder and Kitt Peak (Y. Wang, private communication, 1998) 
are also shown. The model slopes are lower than the observed values from both 
sites. Model CzHg-CO correlation coefficients (not shown) derived from the model 
columns are >0.9, significantly higher than indicated by the observations. 

7.4 Comparisons of the observations with model calculations 

Figure 12 presents comparisons of the Lauder and Kitt Peak monthly mean 
tropospheric measurements with values calculated with a global 3-D tropospheric 
model [Wang et al., 1998a]. The standard model calculations, which assumed 2.5 
Tg C'^ yr"^ CzHg emitted by biomass burning, are significantly lower than the 
monthly average Lauder partial columns observed during all seasons. Also, the 
September-October peak is broader in the model results than in the observations. 
These differences are consistent with comparisons of the reported Lauder December 
1992-March 1994 CjHg columns [Rinsland et al. , 1994a] and the model results, as 
displayed in Fig. 15 of Wang et al. [1998b]. The authors comment that the 
agreement between the measured and calculated Lauder CzHg seasonal cycle is 
improved with the biomass burning emission rate increased to 6 Tg C yr . 
However, this emissions rate is also higher than the value of 2.7 Tg C'^ yr 



39 



derived for the southern hemisphere by Clarkson et al. [1997] . and it is outside 
their estimated budget uncertainty (1.6-5.2 Tg yr"^) . As pointed out by Wang et 
al. [1998b], the cause of the C^Hg model -measurement discrepancy is unclear 
because the model calculations reproduce observations of the southern hemisphere 
CO seasonal cycle very well (including the present data) and the C^He/CO biomass 
burning emissions ratio is well determined from field emission measurements. 

In contrast, calculations with the model of Wang et al. [1998a] are 
significantly higher than the Kitt Peak CO tropospheric column observations 
throughout the year, but the model reproduces the C^Hg measurements and their 
seasonal variation quite well during all seasons. The cause of the Kitt Peak 
CO model -measurement discrepancy is also unclear, but it is quite likely that 
the difference is unrelated to the discrepancy noted for Lauder. 

8. Summary 

In this paper we have reported multi-year time series of high spectral 
resolution infrared solar absorption CO and C,H, measurements from remote sites 
at midlatitudes of the northern and southern hemispheres. Target lines were 
selected to achieve similar vertical sensitivities based on averaging kernels. 
The Lauder 1993-1997 CO and C^Hg columns below 12 km (with peak sensitivities in 
the upper troposphere) show highly asymmetrical seasonal cycles with a minimum 
in about February, a maximum near September-October, and distinct year-to-year 
differences in the seasonal variation. Sharp peaks are observed in the partial 
columns of both gases near the seasonal maximum. The seasonal variation is 
larger for C,H, than from CO, which is also produced in situ by the oxidation of 
CH,. The elevated values observed in austral spring likely result from the long 
range transport of tropical biomass burning emissions, principally from Africa 



40 



and South America. Near the seasonal maximum, the peak column- average 
tropospheric mixing ratios of C,He and CO above Lauder are similar to upper 
tropospheric values observed in continental outflow regions between Brazil and 
Africa during the same season. The peak Lauder partial columns are also similar 
to the annual mean values observed above Kitt Peak. Although year-to-year 
differences are apparent, no significant trend was detected for either molecule 
above Lauder. The Kitt Peak 2.09-14 km partial columns also show distinct 
seasonal cycles with spring peaks in the mixing ratios of the two gases and 
larger relative seasonal variations for C^Hg than CO. An unexpected result of 
this study is the observed, statistically significant downward trend in the Kitt 
Peak C^Hs tropospheric column. No significant long-term trend in the 
tropospheric CO column was detected over the 20 year span of the Kitt Peak 
spectroscopic observations.

Figure Captions 

Figure 1. Comparison of "true" and retrieved CO 2.09-14 km column amounts 
(molecules cm'^) . The "true" profiles are based on synthetic spectra generated 
from 82 profiles created from merged aircraft tropospheric and ATMOS 
measurements. The retrievals were obtained by fitting the synthetic spectra with 
the a priori profile and retrieval algorithm settings described in the text. 

Figure 2. Partial column averaging kernels for vertical profile retrievals of 
CzHg (upper panel) and CO (lower panel) from Lauder observations and the spectral 
intervals used in the present study. Kernels for merged layers of 0.37-12, 12- 
100, and 0.37-100 km (total column) are presented. 

Figure 3. Examples of Lauder CO partial column averaging kernels for other 
selections of spectral lines and retrieval methods. Upper panel: Kernels for 
vertical profile retrievals from the strong CO (1-0) R(3) line at 2157.2997 cm'^ 
Lower panel: Kernels for the same CO lines as in Fig. 2, but assuming 
multiplicative scaling of the a priori mixing ratios by a single factor. 

Figure 4. Comparison of measured and calculated Doppler- limited CzHg laboratory 
spectra recorded in the region of the PQ3 subbranch of the Uy band with a 
difference -frequency laser spectrometer. The spectra were recorded at 296 K with 
an absorption path of 69.7 cm (upper panel) and 161 K with an absorption path 
of 8 m (lower panel). The measured and calculated absorbances are shown with 
solid and dashed lines at top in each panel; calculated absorbances obtained for

A series, E series, and other lines, offset vertically for clarity, are shown 
beneath. 

Figure 5. Comparison of a Lauder solar absorption spectrum in the CzHg 
measurement interval and simulations of the principal absorbing molecules. The 
molecule -by-molecule simulations are offset vertically for clarity. The Lauder 
solar spectrum (bottom) was recorded at an astronomical zenith angle of 62.61° 
on October 26, 1994, a spectral resolution of 0.006 cm-\ and a field of view of 
2.95 mrad. An arrow marks the location of the unresolved C^Hq ^Qa subbranch at 
2976.8 cm"^ Note the overlapping absorption by a weak H2O line at 2976.7810 
cm~^. 

Figure 6. Sample fit to a Lauder solar spectrum in the CaHg PQ3 microwindow. 
The measured spectrum (lower panel), normalized to the peak amplitude in the 
interval, was recorded at a resolution of 0.006 cm"^ on June 3, 1997. Residuals 
(measured minus calculated values) are shown on an expanded vertical scale in 
the upper panel . 

Figure 7. Molecule -by-molecule simulations of the absorptions by CO, CH^ , H2O, 
HDD, and solar CO, offset vertically for clarity, and a Lauder solar spectrum 
in the 2 intervals used to analyze CO. The Lauder spectrum, normalized to the 
peak signal in each interval, was recorded at an astronomical zenith angle of 
78.05' on October 26, 1994, at a resolution of 0.006 cm'^ The (2-0) band CO 
lines are identified beneath the measured spectrum. 



59 
Figure 8. Example of spectral fittings for the CO (2-0) band R(3) and R(6) lines 
in a Kitt Peak solar spectrum. The observation was recorded on April 9, 1997, 
at a spectral resolution of 0.01 cm"^ The measurements in each interval are 
normalized to the peak value in the interval. Measured minus calculated 
residuals are plotted on an expanded scale. 

Figure 9. Plot of Kitt Peak root mean square (rms) residual versus signal 
strength ratio (ssr) for the CzHg PQ3 subbranch at 2976.8 cm'^ Observations with 
ssr less than 10 and an rms residual greater than 1 were excluded from further 
analysis. 

Figure 10. Time series of Lauder 0.37-12 km daily average partial columns 
(molecules cm'^) between July 1993 and November 1997. Plus symbols show the 
observations; solid curves represent least- squares best- fits to the observations 
with Equation 3. The best-fit, long-term trend with the seasonal variation 
removed (a2=0 in Eq. 3) is shown with a dashed line. Results for CzHg and CO are 
shown in the top and middle panels, respectively, with the corresponding, 
approximate 0.37-12 km column average mixing ratios indicated on the right 
vertical axis. Daily average 0.37-12 km CzHg/CO columns ratios are plotted in 
the bottom panel. 

Figure 11. Time series of Kitt Peak 2.09-14 km daily average partial columns 
(molecules cm'^) between May 1977 and December 1997 and the daily average 2.09- 
14 km CgHg/CO columns ratios displayed in the same format as in Fig. 10.

WALDEN ET AL: ANTARCTIC LONGWAVE RADIATION SPECTRUM 



conclusions of the longwave study was that line-by-line radiative 
transfer models, although they agree well with each other, do not 
represent an absolute standard by which to judge less detailed 
models. Their output must therefore be compared with data from 
the real atmosphere. Spectral rather than broadband, and radiance 
rather than flux measurements, would be most useful because the 
causes of discrepancies between model and observation can be 
more easily identified if angular and spectral averaging has not 
been done. Specifically, the study concluded that spectral radi- 
ance data of moderate resolution (about 1 cm"') would be particu- 
larly valuable for comparison with a variety of radiation codes at 
various spectral resolutions. 

To resolve the differences among the most detailed radiation 
models, the ICRCCM participants recommended that accurate 
spectral radiance measurements be made coincidentally with the 
atmospheric variables necessary to calculate radiance [Ellingson 
efo/., 1991]. Currently, datasetsof this type exist for the follow- 
ing locations: (1) Coffeyville, Kansas, where the Spectral Radi- 
ance Experiment (SPECTRE) was performed [Ellingson and 
Wiscombe, 1996], (2) the Southern Great Plains site of the Atmo- 
spheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program [Stokes and 
Schwartz, 1994; Ellingson el al., 1995], (3) the California coast 
[Clough et al., 1989a], and (4) the tropical Pacific Ocean [Lubin et 
al., 1995]. ARM is now establishing a site on the Nonh Slope of 
Alaska. 

The Antarctic Plateau is an ideal location for acquiring spectral 
radiance data for testing radiative transfer models. Since the 
atmosphere is so cold and dry (<1 mm of precipitable water), the 
overlap of the emission spectrum of water vapor with that of other 
gases is greatly reduced. Therefore the spectral signatures of other 
important infrared emitters, namely, CO2, O3, CH4, and N2O, are 
quite distinct. In addition, the low atmospheric temperatures pro- 
vide an extreme test case for testing models. Even in summer the 
atmosphere is colder and drier than the sub-Arctic winter, the 
coldest of the five AFGL model atmospheres. The radiation con- 
ditions at the surface of the Antarctic Plateau in winter are similar 
to those at the tropopause at lower latitudes. Routine operations at 
South Pole Station provide good ancillary data for characterizing 
the atmosphere throughout the year. The South Pole Weather 
Office (SPWO) launches radiosondes once or twice per day and 
makes surface weather observations at least every 6 hours. The 
Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) of the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) pro- 
vides continuous near-surface concentrations of several radia- 
tively active trace gases, as well as ozonesonde profiles once or 
twice per week. 

Many previous Antarctic field programs have reported mea- 
surements of broadband radiation fiuxes [Hanson, 1960; Hanson 
and Rubin, 1962; Rusin, 1964; Kopanev, 1967; Kuhn et al., 1977; 
Yamanouchi et al., 1982; Carroll, 1982; Yamanouchi and 
Kawaguchi, 1 984]. Such broadband measurements, however, are 
not useful for identifying defects in radiative transfer models. 
Here our focus is instead on how the radiance varies across the 
infrared spectrum. In this paper we describe a data set taken at 
South Pole Station throughout the year of 1992, consisting of 
spectral infrared radiances together with observations from radio- 
sondes and other instruments to characterize the aunosphere. Par- 
ticular attention is given to the calibration and uncertainty 
associated with the radiation measurements. The calibration pro- 
cedure described here is an improvement over that of Van Allen el 
al. [1996], which used the same instrument at South Pole Station. 
Their experiment was designed to study stratospheric chemistry. 



which did not require the level of accuracy needed here for 
SPECTRE-type comparisons. 

The uncenainties associated with characterizing the atmo- 
sphere are also estimated, particularly with regard to temperature 
and humidity variations in the near-surface layer. Three test cases 
are constructed, using the highest-quality measurements from the 
data set, representing the meteorological and infrared radiation 
conditions in summer, winter, and spring under clear sky. These 
test cases are used to compare the spectral infrared radiances with 
calculations of the line-by-line radiative transfer model 
(LBLRTM) [Clough el al., 1992]. A brief description of 
LBLRTM is given below as it is applied to this work, including 
how the model calculations were adjusted for instrumental effects, 
so that the model results can be compared directly with the obser- 
vations. The radiance error in the LBLRTM calculations induced 
by uncertainties in the ancillary data is estimated; the major 
sources of error are identified for summer and winter conditions. 
The comparisons for our six test cases (two viewing angles on 
each of 3 days) are shown, and portions of the spectrum are exam- 
ined in detail. 

2. Field Program 

Spectral radiance was measured by a Fourier transform inter- 
ferometer (FTIR), manufactured by Bomcm, Inc., and modified at 
the University of Denver (UD) for outdoor operation at South 
Pole. It had been successfully operated through a previous winter 
at South Pole for the purpose of determining concentrations of 
atmospheric gases important to ozone chemistry [Murcray and 
Heuberger, 1990, 1991, 1992]. The radiance spectrum was mea- 
sured at viewing zenith angles of 45° and 75°, and also often at 
60°, every 12 hours throughout the year except during blizzard 
conditions. 

The state of the atmosphere is characterized by using various 
sources of data. Visual sky observations were made by Warren 
during each FTIR measurement, as well as routinely every 6 hours 
by the SPWO obser\'ers. Vertical profiles of temperature, water 
vapor, and ozone are constructed by using a combination of radio- 
sonde data from SPWO and CMDL, plus satellite data from the 
Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) [Reber et al., 
1993]. Tropospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, 
nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons were obtained from in situ 
measurements made at the surface by CMDL, and stratospheric 
concentrations were obtained from UARS. 

3. Selection of Test Cases 

Three da> s were selected for comparison of spectral radiance 
measurements to radiative transfer models: January 17, 1992, May 
1, 1992, and October 5, 1992. For each day the calibrated radi- 
ances at viewing zenith angles of 45° and 75° are determined. The 
three primary criteria for selection were clear skies with minimal 
visually observed atmospheric ice crystals, well-calibrated spec- 
tral radiance measurements, and time of year. The summer and 
winter cases were chosen to span the full range of atmospheric 
conditions over South Pole; the springtime case represents an 
atmosphere with a depleted ozone profile. Secondary selection cri- 
teria include availability of high-quality radiosonde and ozone- 
sonde information and minimal time between the radiosonde 
launch and the spectral radiance measurements (Table 1). The 
seasons at South Pole are defined by the annual cycle of surface 
temperature [Schwerdifeger, 1970; Warren, 1996]: summer

(December-January), autumn (February-March), winter (April- 
September), and spring (October-November). 

On the three days chosen, no visual clouds were observed in 
any portion of the sky by either the SPWO or Warren. The May 1 
case was chosen partly because the amount of clear-sky ice crystal 
precipitation ("diamond dust") was slight and partly because polar 
stratospheric clouds (PSCs) normally are not present until later in 
the winter [Poole and Pitts, 1994]. Polar stratospheric clouds arc 
hard to detect visually from the surface during nighttime, but the 
assumption that they were absent on May 1 is supported by the 
lidar data discussed by Cacciani el al. [1993]. 

The primary factor controlling the availability of good sonde 
data is the type of balloon used. During the winter, plastic bal- 
loons were used alternately with standard rubber balloons; plastic 
balloons typically reach higher altitudes (about 30 km) before 
bursting but are more expensive. Test cases were chosen for days 
on which the balloon reached high altitude. 



4. Spectral Radiance Measurements 
4.1 Data 

A Michelson-type interferometer was used: Bomem model 
MB- 1 00 with electronics upgraded to an MB- 120. Data acquisi- 
tion from the instrument is controlled by an IBM-PC compatible 
computer using software developed by Bomem and UD. Modifi- 
cations made at UD for operation in Antarctica include the follow- 
ing. A mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) semiconductor 
detector, cooled by liquid nitrogen, was installed for high sensitiv- 
ity at thermal infrared wavelengths. The liquid niu-ogen was sup- 
plied by a Joule-Thompson expansion cooler using nitrogen gas 
from high-pressure storage bottles. An external mirror assembly 
was attached to the interferometer, enabling it to view two exter- 
nal calibration sources and the sky at three zenith angles. 

The interferometer is a two-input, two-output instrument. The 
detector, placed at one of the output ports, records the superposi- 
tion of infrared radiation from the two input ports, one of which is 



an internal reference source; the other is the scene. The output 
varies as a function of the optical path difference of the scanning 
mirror; its DC offset is suppressed by the interferometer's elec- 
tronics by coupling to the variable portion of the signal [Beer, 
1992, equation (1. 14b)]. The total optical path difference is 
16,384 (633 nm) = 1.04 cm; the wavelength of the interferome- 
ter's laser is 633 nm. Typically, the mirror scans about 50 to 100 
times successively, with the output from all scans being averaged 
by a process called co-adding. (This number of co-added scans 
was necessary to ensure an adequate signal-to-noise ratio for UD's 
research [Van Allen et al, 1996].) The final co-added record is 
called an interferogram. The Bomem software apodizes the inter- 
fcrogram using the Hann-window function [Press et al., 1992], 
and performs a Fourier transform, producing an uncalibrated spec- 
trum for that individual measurement. The spectral resolution of 
the transformed data is 1 cm"' (full width at half maximum). The 
spectral bandwidth of the instrument is limited by the response of 
the MCT detector and the bandpass of the beamsplitter to the 
range 550-1667 cm'', or 6-18 nm. At these limiting wavenumbers 
the response is about 10% of the peak response at 900 cm''. 

During a typical spectral radiance measurement the interferom- 
eter views four or five different scenes successively. A "measure- 
ment sequence" consists of viewing zenith angles of 45° and 75° 
(and of\en 60°), bracketed by views of calibration sources: one at 
ambient air temperature and another at about 45 K above ambient. 
A typical measurement sequence takes 20-30 min. The calibration 
sources are grooved copper plates painted with Aeroglazc Z306, a 
polyurethane coating. Each source has two thermistors imbedded 
in the back of the copper disk, sensing its temperature. The cold 
source has one thennistor at the center of the disk and the other on 
the periphery. The warm source has a resistive heater attached to 
the center of its back surface, to elevate its temperature above 
ambient. One of its thermistors is therefore slightly off center, 
while the other is on the periphery. 

Measurement sequences were performed approximately every 
12 hours throughout the year at South Pole and during most rou- 
tine radiosonde launches made by the SPWO. Measurement

sequences were taken more frequently when the sky was clear, 
and special observations were made during some ozonesonde and 
water vapor sonde launches. "Housekeeping" information was 
recorded routinely during each sequence, consisting primarily of 
temperature measurements of various parts of the interferometer. 
These measurements were used to select test cases with good ther- 
mal stability, in which the instrument temperature drifted by less 
than 0. 1 K during the measurement sequence [Walden, 1995]. 

The interferometer was mounted atop the Skyiab building at an 
elevation of approximately 10 m above the upwind snow surface. 
The insuument was housed in about 10 cm of styrofoam insula- 
tion, while the external mirror assembly was exposed to the ambi- 
ent temperature. Thus the internal temperature of the 
interferometer varied only slowly as the ambient temperature 
changed. 

4.2 Calibration 

The method of Revercomb el al. [1988] is used to calibrate 
measurements of the sky. An uncalibrated spectrum, C, can be 
written as a linear function of the measured radiance, L, as 



C = r[L + LV*°]e'*, 



(1) 



where r is the instrument response function of the interferometer, 
L° represents the spectral offset radiance from the instrument 
itself, ^ is the phase response of the instrument due to optical and 
electrical dispersion, and ^° is any anomalous phase incorporated 
into the offset radiance [Revercomb el al., 1 988]. All the variables 
are functions of frequency. Subscripts w, c, and s are applied to C 
and L, referring to warm, cold, and sky (or scene). The uncali- 
brated spectra for the warm and cold calibration sources, C,^' and 
Cj, are used to calibrate the measurements of the sky, Cj', by tak- 
ing the real part of the ratio of difference spectra and solving for 
the scene radiance, Lj, giving 



Ls = r[L„-Lc] + Lc 



where 



Re

(3) 



L^ and Lj are the radiances emitted and reflected from the calibra- 
tion sources: 



L3 = ejB(T.)+(l-Ej)B(T,„,i„,), 



(4) 



where j is either w or c. B(T) represents the Planck radiance at a 
particular frequency for a given temperature T, Tj is the tempera- 
ture of the emitting surface of the source, E; is the spectral emissiv- 
ity of the source, and T,n,bijni 's the temperature of the ambient 
outside air. 

TTiere are implicit assumptions in equation (1). First, the out- 
put from the interferometer's detector is assumed to be lineariy 
related to the input radiance into the interferometer. The possibil- 
ity of nonlinearities in the detector is not considered in this study, 
since any resulting bias is probably small compared with the over- 
all radiance uncertainty discussed below. 

In addition, the assumption of thermal stability means that the 
offset radiance L°e'* is constant within a measurement sequence, 
so that it can be eliminated by the taking the difference of mea- 
surements C, which results in the numerator and denominator of 
equation (3). The maximum acceptable level of thermal drift of 
the interferometer during measurement sequences to be used for 



lest cases was chosen such that any radiance errors resulting from 
thermal drift are negligible compared with those from other error 
sources. However, a procedure for adjusting measurement 
sequences with larse thermal drift has been developed by Walden 
[1995]. 

The radiances from the calibration sources, L^^, and L^, must be 
known accurately, independent of the measurements, for proper 
calibration of atmospheric radiances. Thus the accuracy of the 
final calibrated radiances depends on accurate specification of the 
source temperature and emissivity. The uncenainties in these 
temperatures and emissivities must also be assessed to estimate 
the uncertainty in calibrated radiances. The source temperatures 
and emissivities described below differ from those used by Van 
Allen el al.[\99e]. 

4.2.1 Temperature of the calibration sources. The tempera- 
ture of each calibration source is measured by two thermistors that 
were calibrated to a temperature reference of the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST) by the manufacturer (Yellow 
Springs Instruments, Inc., Yellow Springs, Ohio). The electronics 
used to measure the source temperatures were checked by substi- 
tuting four different high-precision resistors in place of each ther- 
mistor. The resistors were chosen to represent a range of 
temperatures far exceeding the range experienced at South Pole. 
The voltage recorded by the electronics was converted back to a 
resistance value, which was then compared with the value of the 
precision resistors. Analysis of this cross-check procedure indi- 
cated that a small additional resistance needed to be added to the 
inferred resistances to reconcile them with the actual values. In 
the conversion of resistance to temperature this correction was sig- 
nificant when the resistance being measured was small (less than 
1000 ohms). The additional resistance ranged from 9 to 75 ohms 
and varied from channel to channel within the data acquisition 
system. Using the thermistor manufacturer's conversion from 
resistance to temperature, we derived temperature corrections for 
each thermistor. Figure 1 shows the corrections for the four ther- 
mistors on the calibration sources over the range of temperature 
values experienced by these sources at South Pole in 1992. The 
corrections are significant at high temperatures, or low thermistor 
resistance. Tlie corrections are 0.6 K and 1.3 K for the cold source 
thermistors at their maximum yearly temperature of -lO^C, and 
0.3 K and 1.3 K for the warm source thermistors at +35°C. 

Figure 2a shows the difference in temperature reported by the 
two thermistors on the cold calibration source. Since the cold 
source is at ambient outside temperature, the two thermistors 
should agree. True temperature differences between the ther- 
mistors would be due to random variation of environmental condi- 
tions such as wind speed and direction, causing only random 
scatter in the data. Figure 2a shows instead a consistent pattern of 
deviation with small scatter; the deviation exceeds the manufac- 
turer's tolerance limit at high temperatures. Figure 2b shows that 
after correcting for the thermistor electronics bias the cold source 
temperatures agree well for the entire temperature range through- 
out the year, thus validating the correction procedure. The true 
cold source temperature, T^, is then estimated by averaging T4" 
and T|o', where the prime indicates that the correction for the elec- 
tronics bias has been applied: 



t;ht, + a,,.

where A54 is the temperature correction for the thermistor elec- 
tronics bias of channel 4. A similar expression exists for T)o'. 

A similar analysis of the warm source is not possible since tem- 
perature gradients do exist within the heated plate, but the success

Figure 1. Thermistor electronics temperature bias (Ae) for the 
individual thermistors in the infrared calibration sources. The 
bias is shown for the range of temperatures experienced at South 
Pole during 1992. The th'crmislors are designated by their housc- 
Iceeping channel number; channels 4 and 10 for the cold source 
thermistors and channels 5 and 1 1 for the warm source ther- 
mistors. Channels 4, 10, and II are 300-ohm thermistors (YSI 
44002); channel 5 is a 3000-ohm thermistor (YSI 44005). All 
thermistors were manufactured by Yellow Springs Instruments.

of the electronics bias correction procedure for the cold source 
argues for its validity in general. We therefore apply the electron- 
ics bias correction to the warm source thermistors, T5 and Tn. 
However, for the warm source there is an additional correction 
that must be applied due to thermal gradients within this source. 
Figure 3a shows that there is a significant temperature difference 
between the two thermistors on the warm source, which increases 
as the source temperature (e.g., T5') rises above ambient (T^). 
This behavior is expected because all thermal gradients in the 
source should be proportional to the difference between its tem- 
perature and ambient. Since the two thermistors are at different 
temperatures, it was necessar>' to decide which sensor has better 
accuracy. T5' was chosen for two main reasons [yValden. 1995]: it 
has better sensitivity over most of the range of temperatures expe- 
rienced during 1992. and the thermistor electronics temperature 
bias is much smaller for channel 5 than for channel 1 1 (Figure I ). 

In addition to the radial temperature gradient between the ther- 
mistors shown in Figure 3a, there is evidence of a temperature dif- 
ference between T5' and the temperature of the emitting surface of 
the warm source as viewed by the interferometer. Three indepen- 
dent analyses described by Walden [1995, Appendix A] indicate 
that the portion of the source viewed by the interferometer is actu- 
ally warmer than T5'. This higher temperature is due to the loca- 
tion of the warm source's resistive heater in relation to its 
thermistors mentioned above, assuming that the interferometer 
views the center of the copper plate. The results from these analy- 
ses are reproduced in Figure 3b. The temperature difference 
increases as the warm source becomes increasingly warmer than 
ambient. 

A functional form for the thermal gradient temperature bias. 
A„, was determined by performing a linear regression fit to the 
data shown in Figure 3b. The fit was forced through the origin, 
since no thermal gradients exist within the calibration source when 



it is at ambient temperature. Our final estimate for the tempera- 
ture of the viewed portion of the warm calibration source, T^v, is 
then obtained by applying corrections for both the thermistor elec- 
tronics (Aj5) and thermal gradient biases, or

The larger of these two corrections is Ag. For the range of warm 
source temperatures experienced during the year-long field exper- 
iment. Ag was in the range 1-4 K, whereas A^s was at most 0.3 K. 
4.2.2 Emissivity of the calibration sources. The spectral 
emissivity of the UD calibration sources was not directly mea- 
sured but was inferred from the measured emissivity of a similar 
source built by Quantic Industries, Inc. (San Carlos, California) 
while Walden worked there. Both the UD and Quantic sources are 
grooved copper plates, coated with the same black paint, Aero- 
glaze Z306. The emissivity of nongrooved plates (constructed 
independently by Quantic and H. E. Revercomb's group at the 
University of Wisconsin, but both painted with Aeroglaze) com- 
pare well, indicating that perhaps the emissivity in the spectral 
range 750-1300 cm"' (the central portion of the interferometer's 
bandwidth) is not highly sensitive to the paint thickness [Walden, 
1 995, Appendix A]. The emissivity of the Quantic grooved source 
in this spectral region was the value used in deriving the thermal 
gradient bias described above.

In these spectral regions the emissivity of the UD sources is deter- 
mined in the following way, using monthly supplemental calibra- 
tion data taken with a third infrared source, a conical cavity 
constructed by the University of Wisconsin (hereinafter referred to 
as the WI source). (The three thermistors used in the WI source 
had been calibrated to a NIST temperature reference.) The instru-

where i and j can represent either the UD sources (w and c) or a 
series of measurements made with the WI source at different tem- 
peratures. Under the assumption that the ambient and instrument 
temperatures remain constant during the measurement sequence 
using each experimental setup, equation (4) can be substituted into 
equation (7) to obtain 



At the shortwave and longwave ends of the interferometer's 
bandwidth (550-750 cm^' and 1300-1667 cm'') the Quantic 
source is not a good proxy for the UD sources because the emis- 
sivity may be sensitive to the paint thickness; the emissivities of 
the nongrooved plates in these spectral regions are quite different.

The quantity P can be determined by using either the two UD 
sources (Pud) or the WI source (Pwi). The ratio, Puc/Pwi . y'c'ds 
the ratio of the spectral emissivities of the sources, Eud/ewi- Here 
Ewi is assumed to be 0.9956 independent of wavenumber, as mea- 
sured at the University of Wisconsin (R. O. Knuteson, personal 
communication, 1994), and thus Z\jo is determined. 

Figure 4 shows the spectral emissivity of the Quantic source 
and the calibration sources used in this study. The emissivity of 
the calibration sources is generally between 0.97 and 0.99 but has 
significant features at 600, 1600, and 1650 cm''. Accounting for 
these spectral features improves the agreement between the cali- 
brated radiances and radiative transfer calculations described 
below.

Figure 5 shows the calibrated spectra for the six comparison 
test cases. The contributions of several greenhouse gases are dis- 
tinctly visible as a result of the small amount of atmospheric water 
vapor. The 667-cm"' band of carbon dioxide is bounded by the

tional band of water vapor at wavenumbers v < 600 cm" . The

effect of the strong near-surface temperature inversion in winter 
(May) and spring (October) is most prominent in the center of the 
carbon dioxide band. Between 800 and 1200 cm'', emission from 
the water vapor continuum is very small. The 1042-cm ozone 
band stands out in the middle of the window region. Methane and 
nitrous oxide have emission bands around 1275 cm , and the 
1600-cm'' (6.3 urn) band ofwater vapor is visible at v>1350 cm''. 
The total downward infrared fluxes, as measured by a pyrge- 
ometer near the times of the spectral radiance measurements, are 
given in Table 1. 

4.4 Radiance Uncertainties 

Variables entering the calibration equations ((2), (3), and (4)) 
must be assessed for how their uncertainties propagate to uncer- 
tainty in the calibrated radiances. The interfcrometric measure- 
ments (Cy,', Cj', C5') arc subject to inherent instrument noise 
associated with the detector and its electronics, which when con- 
verted to radiance units is called the noise equivalent spectral radi- 
ance (NESR). Radiance errors from the calibration sources (L^^, 
and L^) arc due to uncertainties in the temperatures (aj) and emis- 
sivities (a^) of the emitting surfaces. The total estimated radiance 
error Ol is given as 



a L = o LT + CT Lc-t-NESR , 



(9) 



where we use au and Gle fof the radiance uncertainties due to 
temperature and emissivity uncertainties. All the quantities have 
units of radiance. There is additional error associated with the 
thennal stability of the interferometer, but on the 3 days used in 
this study this error is negligible compared with those listed in 
equation (9). 

To determine Olj, wc first estimate the temperature uncertain- 
ties in the warm and cold calibration sources, Oj^ and Cj^. The 
sky radiance is computed from a calibration using the standard 
temperatures, T,^ and T^, and from another calibration using 
T^w " ''Tw ^"^ ^c "*■ "Tc- "^^^ difference between these two radi- 
ances is taken as an estimate of the maximum radiance error due to 
temperature, since if both aj^ and aj^ were added or subtracted 
from their respective temperatures, the radiance error would be 
less than that for the case described. 

The dominant contributor to aj^ is the uncertainty in the ther- 
mal gradient temperature bias, Ag, for the warm calibration source. 
The uncertainty in Ag is proportional to the uncertainty in the 
slope shown in Figure 3b and also depends on the temperature dif- 
ference AT between the warm and cold sources, i.e., between the 
warm source and ambient air. The farther the warm source is 
above ambient, the larger Ag and its uncertainty; Oj^ increases 
from 0.4°C at AT = 25 K to 0.8°C at AT = 55 K. 

The uncertainty in the cold source temperature, cj^, depends 
on both the uncertainty given by the manufacturer for individual 
thermistors and the uncertainty in the thermistor electronics bias 
correction. The manufacturer's uncertainty dominates at low tem- 
peratures (< -50''C); the uncertainty (lo) for these thermistors 
(YSI 44002) increases from about O.IX at 0°C to 0.2°C at -SOX. 
At high temperatures (> -30°C), the uncertainty in the thermistor 
electronics bias dominates. 

The radiance error due to temperature uncertainties, Olj. 'S 
shown in Figure 6a for the worst (January 17 at 45°) and best 
(May 1 at 75°) error conditions of the six spectra shown in Figure 
5. It is largest in the spectral regions where the absolute radiance 
is small, i.e., where the atmosphere is relatively transparent. This 
is because errors in the derived sky radiance induced by the errors 
in the calibration sources arc greater when extrapolated to lower

radiance values. This situation is especially true in summer when 
the calibration source temperatures are relatively higher than they 
are in winter when compared with the brightness temperature of 
the sky. 

The radiance error due to the uncertainty in the calibration 
source emissivities is determined by taking the difference in radi- 
ance between a calibration using e and a calibration using e + o^. 
A generous estimate of Oe is used here; 0^ = 10.015. The corre- 
sponding radiance error Cle is shown in Figure 6b. 

The NESR was determined by Walden [1995]; it is significant 
primarily at the limits of the interferometer's bandwidth (Figure 
6c), as a result of the roll-offof the instrument response. The cho- 
sen bandwidth of the instrument restricts the NESR to an accept- 
able level for this study. 

The total radiance error (Figure 6d) shows generally the same 
spectral characteristics as Ou and Ole- The radiance error due to 
temperature uncertainty Olt constitutes most of the total error, but 
ole provides a sizable contribution. The effect of the NESR 
becomes significant at the ends of the insu-ument's bandpass and 
dominates at high wavenumbers. 

5. Specification of Atmospheric Composition and 
Structure

radiance was measured on January 17, May 1, and October 5. The

trace gases included in our model atmospheres are water vapor, 
carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, oxygen, CCI3F 
(CFC-11), and CCI2F2 (CFC-12). They are included either 
because they are major infrared emitters in the atmosphere (water 
vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide) or because 
their concentrations are readily available at South Pole Station 
(CFC-1 1, CFC-12). The values are summarized in Table 1 along 
with other information about the three selected test cases. 
Detailed information on each model atmospheric profile and their 
associated uncertainties is given by Walden [1995]. 

To select times when the sky conditions were most clear, we 
consult the visual sky observations made by the SPWO and by 
Warren. Clouds were detected at night when they were illumi- 
nated by moonlight or, in the absence of moonlight, by their 
obscuration of familiar stars. Slight diamond dust was observed 
by Warren in the interferometer's field of view on May 1 but not 
on January 17 and October 5. Sunlight was available for the 
observations on January 1 and October 5. Both the Sun and the 
moon were below the horizon on May 1 . 



5.1 Temperature 

The temperature profiles in the near-surface layer, from the sur- 
face (2.8 km above sea level) to 4 km, were obtained from SPWO 
radiosondes, corrected for thermal lag of the radiosonde's ther- 
mistor by the method of Mahesh el at. [1997]. The uncertainty in 
this correction depends upon how rapidly the temperature struc- 
ture changes with altitude and is therefore greater in winter 
(±0.6°C) than in summer (±0.2°C). Another concern is the tempo- 
ral constancy of the temperature within the inversion layer, since 
the temperatures were not measured coincidentally with the spec- 
tral radiances; the times of the FTIR measurement and the radio- 
sonde launch are shown in Table 1. For May I the uncertainty is 
estimated to be 0.6°C, and 0.9°C for October 5 [Walden, 1995). 
The total uncertainty in the near-surface temperature profile is 
obtained by combining the two uncenainties discussed above with 
the inherent temperature uncertainty (±0.5°C) given by the manu- 
facturer of the sonde (Atmospheric Instrumentation Research. 
Inc.. Boulder. Colorado). For the near-surface layer these are 
±0.5°C. ±1,0°C. and ±I.2''C for January 17. May I, and October 

5. 

The temperature profiles above 4 km are derived from the 
SPWO radiosonde data and data from the cryogenic limb array 
etalon spectrometer (CLAES) and the Halogen Occultation Exper- 
iment (HALOE) aboard the UARS [Roche et al., 1993; Russell et 
al.. 1993; Hervig et ai. 1995]. The radiosondes for our three case 
studies reached altitudes of about 30 km. The temperature uncer- 
tainty between 4 and 30 km is set to ±0.5°C, the manufacturer's 
estimate. Temperatures between 30 km and 60 km were obtained 
from the UARS data archive al the Distributed Active Archive 
Center (D,\AC) at Goddard Space Flight Center. The time refer- 
ence data product (3AT) was used. The retrieved temperatures 
from CLAES have better accuracy (1°-2°C) than those from 
HALOE (2°-5°C) and are therefore used whenever available. 
Only data with positive quality values are used, meaning that the 
data are based on actual atmospheric measurements rather than 
climatology. Even though the UARS instruments view only to a 
maximum southern latitude of 80°S, the temperatures from the 
radiosondes generally agree with those from UARS, where they 
overlap, to within the estimated uncenainties at the la level. This 
agreement is found as well for water vapor and ozone discussed 
below. 



The temperature profiles for the three model atmospheres are 
shown in the first two columns of Figure 7; the second column 
shows the near-surface layer with an expanded vertical scale. The 
atmosphere is warmest at all altitudes on January 17. By May 1 
the stratosphere has cooled as a result of the lack of sunlight. In 
October the temperatures between 14 and 17 km are below 195 K, 
cold enough for the formation of type 1 PSCs. The near-surface 
temperature structure on January 17 shows a small surface-based 
inversion, indicating that solar heating of the surface is not provid- 
ing enough energy to compensate for the loss of longwave radia- 
tion. On May 1 with no Sun, and October 5 with low Sun, the 
surface-based inversion is well developed. 



5.2 Water Vapor 

Water vapor is an extremely important atmospheric constituent, 
but it is the least well known of the gases measured at South Pole 
and used in this study. The tethered kite experiments described by 
Mahesh et al. [1997] are used to gain insight into the water vapor 
content of the near-surface atmosphere. Despite the fact that the 
carbon hygristors used for these tests were calibrated only down to 
-40°C, the data suggest that the relative humidity with respect to 
ice (RHi) is close to saturation in the near-surface layer. In fact, 
Schwerdtfeger [1970; 1984] took the frequent occurrence of dia- 
mond dust ice crystals as evidence that the lower atmosphere must 
be at least saturated with respect to ice. On the basis of the teth- 
ered hygristor data we assume that the near-surface inversion layer 
is saturated with respect to ice, and we bound the atmospheric rel- 
ative humidity (with respect to ice) in this layer with a range of 90- 

110%. 

Troposphcric humidity was measured by three different instru- 
ments; carbon hygristors used routinely by the SPWO, two frost- 
point hygrometers launched by NOAA, and capacitive-type 
Vaisala Humicaps that were packaged with the frost-point 
hygrometers and ozonesondes. Like the carbon hygristors the 
Humicaps are calibrated only down to -40°C. The frost-point 
hygrometers are designed to measure stratospheric humidities and 
thus are tuned for low absolute humidities (S. J. Oltmans, personal 
communication, 1993). 

On the basis of a small set of intercomparisons between these 
various instruments it is impossible to draw firm conclusions 
about the variability of troposphcric humidity. However, the data 
suggest that the troposphere can be either near saturation or sub- 
stantially subsaturated in the winter [Walden, 1995]. Because 
there is no agreement between the SPWO carbon hygristor and the 
Vaisala Humicap, some judgment is needed in specification of 
humidity for the model atmospheres, taking into account the atmo- 
spheric processes occurring over the Antarctic Plateau. For all 
three of our model atmospheres, RHj from 4 to 7 km is assumed to 
be 75% ± 25%. 

The microwave limb sounder (MLS) and HALOE instruments 
from the UARS are used here to provide water vapor information 
from about 30 to 60 km, or 100 to 0.1 mbar. Comparisons 
between MLS data and the two NOAA-CMDL frost-point 
hygrometers launched from South Pole in 1992 are very good 
despite the fact that the UARS data are for lower latitudes 
[IValden. 1995]. 

Figure 7 (right) shows the humidity profiles for the three model 
atmospheres. In all cases the troposphere is more humid than the 
upper atmosphere. The May and October cases have less water 
vapor in the near-surface layer and the troposphere because of the 
extreme low temperatures. The total column amount is 1 mm of

5.3 Other Gases 

Air samples were collected in flasks and analyzed for CO2 by 
NOAA-CMDL [Komhyr et al., 1983, 1985; Thoning et al., 1987]. 
Tlie values on January 17. May 1. and October 5 were 353.5, 
353.5. and 355.0 ppmv. respecjively. These mixmg ratios are 
used at all altitudes in the model atmospheres, since COj is well 
mixed in the troposphere and stratosphere. As a conservative esti-

data was excellent on January 1 7 (MLS) and May 1 (CLAES) and 
good on October 5 (HALOE). For these 3 days, the integrated 
ozone profiles agree to within 5% with the total ozone reported by 
CMDL"s Dobson spectrophotometer at South Pole and the total 
ozone mapping spectrometer aboard the Nimbus 7 satellite. 

The ozone profiles for the three model atmospheres are shown 
in Figure 8. On October 5, severe depletion is seen between 12 
and 18 km, coincident with the low temperatures in this region. 
The total column ozone amounts for January 1 7, May 1, and Octo- 
ber 5 are 287, 247, and 147 Dobson units (DU). 

Methane mixing ratios at the surface were obtained by analyz- 
ing flask samples [Steele et ai, 1987; Lang el al., 1990a.b}, col- 



lected approximately once per week during 1992. Nitrous oxide 
mixing ratios at the surface were also measured by CMDL (J. But- 
ler, personal communication, 1995). Profiles of tropospheric 
methane and nitrous oxide were not available, so their mixing 
ratios from the surface to 10-15 km were set equal to the monthly 
average surface values. Their seasonal cycles were used to esti- 
mate the uncertainty in the mixing ratios in the troposphere, about 
30 ppbv for methane and 1 ppbv for nitrous oxide. These uncer- 
tainty values were doubled between 10 and 15 km, where it was 
necessary to match the surface values to UARS data in some 
cases. Methane above 1 5 km was obtained from CLAES in Janu- 
ary and May and HALOE in October. Concentrations of nitrous

oxide for ihe January and May cases came from CLAES. Niirous 
oxide data were not available for October 5, so the values above 
15 km were set to one third the value of the CLAES data from Jan- 
uary 17 in rough agreement with data from Figure 6 of Randall ei 
al. [1994]. The estimated relative uncertainty for October 5 is 
double that of the January case. Figure 8 shows the vertical pro- 
files of methane and nitrous oxide used in the model atmospheres. 
The chlorofluorocarbons, CFC-ll and CFC-12, were included 
in a manner similar to that for CH4 and N2O. Their mixing ratios 
at the surface were measured by CMDL. The monthly average 
surface values were used up to about 15 km: about 266 pptv for 
CFC-1 1 and 495 pptv for CFC-12. Data from CLAES for January 
17 were used above 15 km for all three test cases, since data were 
not available for May 1 and October 5. Sensitivity studies showed 
that the downward radiance is insensitive to the uncertainty in the 
stratospheric concentration but that it is important to specify the 
observed decrease in concentration above 1 5 km. 

Oxygen was also included to account for its weak emission 
band from 1390 to 1760 cm"'. Its mixing ratio was set to 20.95% 
by volume [Goody and Yung, 1989]. 

(.'(.'I4 was not included because its coiilribulion 10 emission at 

790 cm"' appears to be within the estimated radiance uncertainty. 

HNO3 was not included because its tropospheric concentration 

was not measured at South Pole. 

6. Radiative Transfer Calculations 

6.1 Line-By-Line Radiative Transfer Model 

This model (LBLRTM) was developed for the ARM program 
[Clough et al., 1992] and has become a standard in the atmo- 
spheric radiation community. It is a vectorized version of 
FASC0D3 [Ctough el al., 1989b] and is used here to calculate 
radiance in a vertically inhomogeneous, but horizontally homoge- 
neous, atmosphere. Clough et al. [1992] described the numerical 
techniques and approximations used to implement the radiative 
transfer equation in LBLRTM and also compared its output with 
another LBL model that was used in the ICRCCM study. 
LBLRTM has also been compared with accurate spectral radiance 
measurements taken at midlatitudes [Clough el al., 1989a; 1992]. 
Example calculations were given by Clough et al. [1992] and 
Clough and lacono [1995]. Version 3 of LBLRTM, released in 
April 1996, is employed here in conjunction with the 1992 version 
of the high-resolution line parameter (HITRAN) database [Roth- 
man et al., \992]. 

The input to LBLRTM is provided by the model atmospheres 
described above. The specified wavenumber range in LBLRTM 
exceeds the bandwidth of the UD interferometer by at least 25 
cm"'. The zenith angle is set to the value of the angle readout 
given by UD's interferometer after being adjusted slightly for the 
measured tilt of the roof upon which the interferometer was 
mounted. The observation height specified within LBLRTM is 10 
m above the surface, because the interferometer occupied a roof- 
top location 10 m above the surrounding snow surface. The maxi- 
mum height and vertical resolution of the model atmospheres are 
specified below. All other values required by LBLRTM are set to 
the default values; in particular, the line shape calculation uses a 
Voigt profile that extends to 25 cm"' from the line centers. 

The water vapor continuum is represented by the Clough- 
Kneizys-Davies (CKD) model, version 2.2. Clough el al. [1992] 
showed the importance of including the self- and foreign-broaden- 
ing effects of water vapor in a manner consistent with observa- 
tions. They used the sub-Arctic winter standard atmosphere 10 



illustrate the particular importance of ihe foreign continuum for 
cold atmospheres. The original CKD model [Clough et al., 
1989c] has been updated on the basis of comparisons with atmo- 
spheric spectral radiance data. 

One advantage of using a model for calculating atmospheric 
radiances is that the full infrared spectrum can be examined, 
beyond the spectral lirnits of the measurements. Figure 9 shows 
radiance calculations for the three model atmospheres at a viewing 
zenith angle of 45° from 100 to 2000 cm"' (5 to 100 urn). In Fig- 
ure 9a the spectrum is labeled according to contributions from the 
major radiatively active gases. The radiance is lower in the winter 
(May 1) and early spring (October 5) than in summer (January 
1 7), because of lower atmospheric temperatures. 

The relatively transparent portion of the water vapor rotational 
band extends from the wing of the carbon dioxide band at 550 
cm'' to around 350 cm"'. This spectral region is of particular 
importance to the radiative balance of polar atmospheres. The

The imponance of the near-surface air temperature and the var- 
ious atmospheric window regions is seen by comparing the Planck 
unct ons with the spectral radiance. Two Planck functions are 
te : one for the surface air temperature at 2 m and the other fo 
he temperature at the top of the inversion. The peaks of the 
Planck functions for the January case are centered on the carbon 
xide band, whereas in May and October, when .he tempera 
lures are lower, the peaks are on the low-wavenumber side of he

6.2 Matching Calculations to Measurements 

To compare spectral radiance observations with the results of a 
high-spcctral-resoluiion radiative transfer model such as 
LBLRTM It is necessary to account for the finite field of view 
(FOV) of the interferometer and also to match the spectral r«o'": 
„on of the calculations to that of the observations. Steel [1964] 
ind Bell 119721 discuss such corrections in general terms. 1 he

this theorN' to comparisons of LBL calculations with interferomet- 
ric measurements of atmospheric radiance and transmission. In 
this studv 1 BLRTM calculations are converted to spectra suitable 
for Jomparisons with observed spectral radiances by using the fol-

7. Uncertainties in the Calculated Radiances 

There are many possible sources of error in the LBLRTM cal- 
cul tions These include uncertainties in the specification of the 
m?d atmosphere, the database of absorption '-e P-- t-

WALDEN ET AL: ANTARCTIC LONGWAVE RADIATION SPECTRUM 



7.1 Maximum Height of the Mode! Atmosphere 

The error in calculated radiance caused by truncating the model 
atmosphere is determined by subu^cting the radiance for a 60-km 
atmosphere from those truncated at 30, 40, or 50 km. These radi- 
ance differences are negative, since the emission from a truncated 
atmosphere is less. The radiance errors for a 30-km atmosphere 
are significant, especially near the I042-cm"' ozone band, where 
they exceed -0.8 mW m"^ sr"' (cm"')''. The errors are seen prima- 
rily in spectral regions with weak absorption, where emission can 
come from throughout the atmosphere. The difference in radiance 
between a 50-km atmosphere and a 60-km atmosphere is very 
small (less than -0.02 mW m"^ sf' (cm-')"' ), so we judge 60 km 
to be adequate and use this as the maximum height in all further 
calculations. 

7.2 Vertical Resolution and Temperature Structure 
in the Lowest 300 m 

Ideally, an altitude grid can be chosen that adequately repre- 
sents the near-surface temperature inversion over the plateau in 
winter, when it is steepest. Model atmospheres with extreme 
inversions and large zenith angles are most sensitive to changes in 
the vertical resolution, so it is best to use such cases for choosing 
the vertical resolution. We chose the October 5 atmosphere at a 
zenith angle of 75°, since its temperature gradient in the lowest 
100 m is the steepest of the three model atmospheres. Several dif- 
ferent altitude grids between the surface (2.84 km) and 3.15 km 
are defined: grids with uniform spacings (10, 20, and 30 m) and a 
variable grid with spacing varying from 5 to 100 m, increasing 
with altitude. Between 3.15 and 60 km the grid spacing varies 
from 150 m to 5 km, gradually increasing with altitude, and is held 
constant in these sensitivity studies. The appropriate vertical reso- 
lution is chosen by successively decreasing the uniform altitude 
spacing in the near-surface layer until the radiance difference 
between successive runs is smaller than a specified tolerance. 
This tolerance is chosen as the radiance error induced by uncer- 
tainties in the temperature profile, discussed below. 

The calculated radiance is sensitive to venical resolution 
mainly in spectral regions that are strongly absorbed; i.e., regions 
in which most of the measured radiance originated in the inversion 
layer. The 30-m grid causes significant differences, but the lO-m 
and 20-m grids give almost identical results. Both still show a dif- 
ference from the variable grid in the CO2 band, but this difference 
is small in comparison with radiance errors caused by the uncer- 
tainty in the specification of the temperature profile, discussed 
next. The calculations shown below use the variable grid. 

7.3 Radiance Error Due to Uncertainty in Atmospheric 
Temperature and Composition 

With the vertical resolution and the height of the mode! atmo- 
sphere chosen so that they induce linle error in the LBLRTM cal- 
culations, the radiance error is now determined by performing 
sensitivity studies by using the model atmosphere data and their 
uncertainties. Standard spectral radiance calculations are produced 
using the profile information presented in Figures 7 and 8. Radi- 
ance errors are determined by perturbing, one at a time, an individ- 
ual profile in the model atmosphere by adding its uncertainty. 
LBLRTM is then run with this perturbed model atmosphere, 
yielding a radiance spectrum. The radiance errors are found by 
subtracting the standard radiance case from that obtained with the 
penurbed atmosphere. The total radiance error is found by taking 
the square root of the sum of the squares of the radiance differ- 
ences due to the various profile perturbations. 



The results for January 17 at 45° and May 1 at 75°, represent- 
ing the warmest and coldest atmospheres at South Pole, are shown 
in Figure 10. These radiance errors represent the range of errors to 
be expected for clear-sky calculations with LBLRTM for the Ant- 
arctic Plateau. Only the four major sources of error are shown in 
Figure 10; the errors due to uncenainty in concentrations of car- 
bon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, CFC-1 1, and CFC-12 are all 
negligible in comparison with those shown. The radiance errors 
for October 5 arc similar to those for May 1. The total radiance 
error in summer is dominated by uncertainties in the temperature 
and water vapor profiles. In winter the uncenainty in zenith angle 
(discussed below) is also a major contributor. The total error in 
calculated radiance for these cases is comparable to the error in 
measured radiance shown in Figure 6. However, the spectral 
structure is different. It should be emphasized that the error esti- 
mates for the LBLRTM calculations assume the sky is clear. The 
visual sky observations were initially used to identify clear test 
cases, but subvisible clouds and aerosols may still have been 
present in the actual atmosphere. This possibility is examined 
below. 

The uncertainty in zenith angle is due to many sources, some of 
which are quantified here and some of which are estimated. The 
angle readout for the interferometer's mirror assembly was accu- 
rate to within a few millivolts, or roughly 0.1°. The lilt of the roof 
during 1992 was estimated as 0.4° ± 0.1°. Additional sources of 
uncenainty included the interferometer being mounted in a non- 
level position and inaccuracy in calibration of the angle readout 
(which is ideally set to 0° when viewing venicallv and 90° when 
viewing horizontally). One test indicated that the zenith angle was 
actually 73.8° at the 75° mechanical mirror stop, an offset of 1.2° 
if it is assumed that the angle readout was set to exactly the 75° 
voltage during that test (R. Van Allen, personal communication, 
1995). When all these sources of uncertainty are taken into 
account, a generous estimate of the overall zenith angle uncer- 
tainty is ±1.5°. 

The radiance errors induced by the uncenainty in the zenith 
angle are most significant in the wintenime. The largest contribu- 
tions are primarily in regions where gases have intermediate 
absorption, i.e., the wings of the carbon dioxide band, the weak 
bands of carbon dioxide (975 cm"') and nitrous oxide (1 168 cm"'), 
the ozone band, and methane, nitrous oxide, and water between 
1200 and 1500 cm"'. Emission from these regions comes from a 
long path length in the atmosphere and therefore comes on aver- 
age from a great distance from the observation point. The farther 
away the emission region, the greater the change in effective emit- 
ting temperature due to a given change in zenith angle (if the tem- 
perature varies with height). The radiance error is large in the 
ozone band because most ozone emission comes from the upper 
troposphere and lower stratosphere. The zenith angle uncenainty 
induces much less error in summer because of weaker temperature 
gradients; the enor is confined to the wings of the carbon dioxide 
band. 

The uncertainty in the temperature profile produces radiance 
errors in spectral regions where emission is from altitudes at 
which the temperature is changing rapidly and where gases are 
strongly absorbing. Most of the errors in both summer and winter 
are from emission within the inversion layer (carbon dioxide and 
water vapor), but there is also a significant contribution in the 
ozone band. 

The radiance errors due to water vapor and ozone are confined 
to regions in which they emit radiation. The enors are largest 
where the uncenainty in the individual profile is greatest. Thus, 
for water vapor, the errors occur in spectral regions where emis-

8. Spectral Radiance Comparisons 

The measurement and calculation for May 1 at 75° arc shown 
in Figure 1 1 along with their difference. This case is used for fur- 
ther discussion below, since it is the most extreme model atmo- 
sphere in terms of low surface temperature (-66°C), strength of the 
surface-based temperature inversion (30 K), and low temperatures 
throughout the atmosphere. Figure 12 shows the radiance differ- 
ences for all six cases. 

The overall agreement between the observations and LBLRTM 
is good. In absolute radiance, differences are comparable to those 
reported from SPECTRE [Ellingson and IViscombe, 1996]. We 
judge radiance differences to be significant, and requiring expla- 
nation, if they exceed twice the estimated combined radiance error 
from both the measurements and calculations. This situation 
occurs only in a few spectral regions, discussed below along with 
a general discussion of the overall comparisons in the following 
spectral bands: carbon dioxide (550-800 cm''), 1 1-nm window 
(800-990 cm''), ozone (990-1070 cm"'), 9-nm window (1070- 
1200 cm''), methane and nitrous oxide (1200-1350 cm''), and 
water vapor (1350-1500 cm'' and 1500-1667 cm''). Selected 
portions of the spectra for May 1 at 75° are plotted in Figure 13 
along with the radiance difference and the estimated error in the 
radiance difference. The error in radiance difference is the square 
root of the sum of the squares of errors in the measurements and 
calculations. 



8.1 Carbon Dioxide 

In the carbon dioxide band from 550 to 800 cm"' (Figures 1 1 
and 12) the agreement is fairly good in all cases. The spurious line 
at 667 cm'' often seen in the measurements and in the radiance 
differences is due to very strong absorption by carbon dioxide 
where the instrument mostly views its internal temperature. At 
this frequency the ratio of the difference spectra, y, is indetermi- 
nate: see equations (2) and (3). The spectral structure in the radi- 
ance differences between 600 and 725 cm'', panicularly in May 
and October when the temperature gradient is large, is probably 
due to error in specification of the temperature structure and zenith 
angle. The largest differences in this band are between 550 and 
600 cm'', shown in Figure 13a. This figure shows that the spectral 
details in the measurements and calculations agree quite well, giv- 
ing confidence in the field of view correction and the spectral res- 
olution correction, and indicating that the signal-to-noise ratio is 
adequate at this end of the interferometer's bandwidth, where the 
instrument response is dropping rapidly. The large offset between 
570 and 600 cm'' points to a consistent problem in the winter 
when the calculation is usually larger than the measurement. It is 
possible that the uncertainty in the calibration source emissivity 
has been underestimated in this spectral region (see Figure 4). 
This possibility precludes detection of faults in the radiative trans- 
fer model or the spectroscopic data in this spectral region.

8.2 The Il-nm Window 

The window region is the most transparent portion of the inter- 
feromcicrs bandwidth, and therefore emission from clouds, aero- 
sols, and diamond dust ice cr>'Stals are easily detected here. The 
skv obser\aiion for May I indicated the presence of diamond dust 
ice cr> siais. which is typical for clear skies in winter at South Pole. 
On October 5. PSCs may have been present over South Pole, since 
the temperature near 15 km (-81°C; Figure 7) was below the 
threshold (195 K or -78°C) at which they are expected to form. 
Ice crystals and clouds, if present, would cause the measured radi- 
ance to exceed the clear-sky calculation, which would give a posi- 
tive radiance difference (measurement minus calculation). 
However, the radiance differences plotted in Figures II and 12 
(and on an expanded scale in Figure 13b) are both positive and 
negative and not significantly different from zero in this spectral 
reaion. suggesting that they are not due to the presence of ice cr\s- 
tals or PSCs. This result is panicularly evident in the January and 
October cases where the calculated radiance exceeds the measured 
radiance Since no significant negative radiance differences exist 
in any of the comparisons, the emission from diamond dust ice 
crv'Stals and PSCs. if present, is within the estimated error. 

' In Figure 13b. emissions from CFC-1 1 and CFC-12 are appar- 
ent, as well as water vapor lines. The weak absorption band of 
carbon dioxide is visible around 960 cm"'. The radiance differ- 
ence between 850 and 900 cm"' is on average larger than other 



regions in Figure 13b because nitric acid was not included in the 
LBLRTM calculation. 

8.3 Ozone 

Ozone emission is seen in Figure 13c. The spectral details cor- 
respond well, validating both the HITRAN spectral line parameter 
data and the FOV and spectral resolution corrections applied to the 
calculations. The differences seen in Figure 13c are within twice 
the estimated radiance error. The six comparisons (Figure 12) 
show no consistent bias in the calculations in relation to the mea- 
surements and therefore suggest possible errors in the individual 
ozone profiles. 

8.4 The9-nm Window 

Ozone and nitrous oxide (1168 cm"') exhibit weak emission 
between 1070 and 1200 cm"', as Figure 1 3d shows. These Antarc- 
tic spectra are ideal for viewing these features, since elsewhere on 
Earth they are obscured by the water vapor continuum. The radi- 
ance differences are generally within the estimated errors. 

8.5 Methane and Nitrous Oxide 

In the portion of the spectrum where nitrous oxide, methane, 
and water vapor overlap (1200-1350 cm"') there is good agree- 
ment (Figure I3e). The spectral details seen in both the observa-

8.6 Water Vapor 

The tendency for calculations to exceed measurements between 
spectral lines is more pronounced from 1350 to 1500 cm'' (Figure 
130. where emission is primarily due to water vapor. In general, 
the peaks of spectral lines agree well, but there are large offsets 



3844 



WALDEN ET AL; ANTARCTIC LONGWAVE RADIATION SPECTRUM 



between lines with, in some cases, striking similarities in spectral 
detail (for instance, around 1380 cm''). Figure 12 shows the cal- 
culation generally exceeding the radiance observation (negative 
radiance differences) from 1250 to 1500 cm'' for all six cases, 
especially between strong water vapor emission lines. The radi- 
ance differences exceed twice the estimated error in all the model 
atmospheres, regardless of whether the residual calibration bias 
seen in the measured window radiances is positive or negative. 

Sensitivity studies were performed on both the interferometric 
calibration and the radiative transfer calculations in an attempt to 
identify the cause of the discrepancies between 1250 and 1500 
cm''. First, the temperature of the warm calibration source was 
adjusted to achieve bener agreement in this spectral region, 
assuming the LBLRTM calculations were correct. The low values 
of the measured radiance between spectral lines are more sensitive 
to the calibration source radiance than are the peaks of the spectral 
lines. Thus it is possible to fit the measured spectrum to the radi- 
ance calculation by changing the warm source temperature. The 
warm source temperature was chosen as a proxy for changes in the 
calibration source radiance, since it is typically the largest source 
of uncerrainty in the measured radiances. To minimize the spec- 
trally averaged difference in radiance in this band, the warm 
source temperature had to be decreased by about 6 K. This adjust- 
ment provided a better match of the low radiances shown in Figure 
13f, but it also increased unrealistically the radiance in other pans 
of the spectrum, panicularly the window regions. Furthermore, a 
decrease in the warm source temperature of this magnitude would 
imply that the interferometer was viewing a source colder than 
thai repoiied by the warm source thermistors, contrary to the evi- 
dence from three different tests shown in Appendix A of Walden 
[1995] and summarized in Figure 3b. Therefore miscalibration of 
the measured radiances cannot explain all of the radiance differ- 
ences between 1250 and 1500 cm''. 

Second, sensitivity studies with LBLRTM were performed by 
using different humidity profiles from the surface (2.8 km) to 7 
km above sea level. As discussed above, the uncertainty in the 
water vapor profiles is large. The calculated spectra are most sen- 
sitive to humidity changes below 7 km, since most of the water 
vapor is contained in the troposphere. The low radiance values 
between spectral lines from 1250 to 1500 cm'' are more sensitive 
to humidity changes than are the peaks of lines, because the peaks 
are saturated. Therefore the iropospheric humidity can be 
adjusted to fit the radiance calculation to the measured spectrum. 
As trial values, the tropospheric relative humidity with respect to 
ice (RHj) was set to 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. As RH; 
decreases from 1 00% to 50%, the discrepancies between the cal- 
culations and measurements also decrease. However, at RH| = 
25% the peaks of the spectral lines become subsaturated, and the 
agreement worsens. Therefore good agreement in both the peaks 
and valleys was impossible, but the best agreement was attained 
for tropospheric RHi values of 25-50%. These low humidity val- 
ues seem unreasonable, since ice crystal precipitation was 
observed on every clear day in winter and on most clear days in 
summer; the presence of precipitation implies saturated conditions 
somewhere within the lower atmosphere. 

Clough el al. [1992] and Thehault el at. [1994] showed the 
importance of the foreign-broadened water vapor continuum in 
this spectral region, particularly in cold atmospheres where the 
continuum increases the opacity between spectral lines. The oxy- 
gen continuum is also important in cold and dry atmospheres from 
1400 cm'' to beyond the high-wavenumber limit of the interfer- 
ometer [Timofeyev and Tonkov. 1978; Rinsland ei al.. 1989]. 



Revercomb el al. [1990] and Theriauli el al. [1994] found that cal- 
culations using FASCODE (the predecessor of LBLRTM) and an 
earlier version of the water vapor continuum mode! exceeded their 
measurements, as we also find. Theriauli et al. [ 1 994) calculated 
radiance along horizontal paths at temperatures of -8T to -4^ 
and water vapor amounts of 0.6 to 1.2 gem'-. They .■iugscstod that 
perhaps either the foreign-broadened absorption coefficient has a 
positive temperature dependence or the temperature dependence 
of the strengths of nearby water vapor lines is in en-or. The for- 
eign continuum absorption in the CK.D model used here has a 
slight temperature dependence through density, but the continuum 
coefficients themselves do not depend on temperature (S. .A. 
Clough, personal communication, 1995). 

The final spectral region considered here (1500-1667 cm"') 
shows significant radiance differences (Figures 1 1 and 12), espe- 
cially in January. This finding is surprising, since most of this 
spectral region is strongly absorbed by water vapor and thus 
should resemble a Planck curve, especially in January when the 
lowest 2 km are nearly isothermal. Sensitivity studies show that 
the choice of emissivity for the calibration sources has little effect 
on the comparisons. It is possible that the noise equivalent spec- 
tral radiance (Figure 6) was underestimated at these wavenum- 
bers. However, since the errors are largest in January and appear 
to be a bias rather than noise, the radiance differences may be due 
to slight water vapor variations within the warm and relatively 
moist instrument during the measurement sequence that are not 
accounted for in the calibration process. Errors of this type would 
be most prevalent in spectral regions characterized by strong 
absorption and emission, e.g., beyond 1500 cm" . 

9. Conclusions 

A data set of downward longwave spectral radiance, measured 
at South Pole Station in 1992. is augmented with ancillary data to 
describe the atmosphere. An error analysis shows that the primary 
source of uncertainty in the spectral radiances is the temperature 
of the warm calibration source; uncertainty in its cmissi\it\ also 
contributes significantly. The overall measurement error is largest 
in spectral regions that are relatively transparent, particularly the 
atmospheric window region (800-1250 cm"'). Three weil-cali- 
brated test cases are selected for clear-sky conditions. 

The state of the atmosphere at the times of the test cases is con- 
structed from radiosondes, water vapor sondes, and ozonesondes 
and from surface measurements of carbon dioxide, methane, 
nitrous oxide, CFC-II, and CFC-12 made at South Pole. Data 
from the UARS satellite are used to describe the upper atmo- 
sphere. Three model atmospheres have been constructed, includ- 
ing estimated uncertainties in all profiles. These data represem the 
coldest and driest test cases for radiative transfer models for ter- 
restrial conditions. 

The line-by-line radiative transfer model LBLRTM was used to 
calculate spectral radiances, using the ancillary data as input. 
Before the measurements were compared, the calculations were 
adjusted for instrumental effects, namely, the spectral resolution 
of the insu-ument and its finite field of view. Sources of error in 
the calculations have been estimated; they are induced by uncer- 
tainties in the viewing zenith angle and in the profiles of tempera- 
ture and the principal radiatively active gases. The major 
contributors to this error are the uncertainties in the temperature 
and water vapor profiles. The uncertainty in the viewing zenith 
angle becomes important in winter, when a steep near-surface 
temperature inversion persists over the Antarctic Plateau.

The differences in radiance between the measurements and cal- 
culations are generally within twice the combined error in the 
measurements and calculations. However, discrepancies exist at 
both ends of the interferometer's bandwidth. Another region of 
discrepancy is between spectral lines from 1250 to 1500 cm" . 
where emission is from the foreign-broadened water vapor contin- 
uum. Sensitivity studies show that the discrepancies are probably 
not solely due to enors in the spectral radiance calibration or to 
inaccurate specification of the water vapor profiles and therefore 
suggest errors in either the spectroscopic database or the mode! of 
the foreign water vapor continuum, or both. Future field measure- 
ments in the polar regions should concentrate on accurately deter- 
mining temperature and water vapor within the boundary layer. In 
addition, spectral radiance observations should be extended to 
wavenumbers as low as 300 cm'' to fully measure the unsaturated 
portion of the water vapor rotational band. These suggestions 
apply in particular to the ARM site on the north slope of Alaska 
and to the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) 
experiment [Moritz and Perovich, 1996]. 

The spectral radiance measurements and their corresponding 
model atmospheres are available to the modeling community 
through ICRCCM [Walden el ai, 1997].

Abstract A recently developed algorithm, SFYTl, is 
used to assess profile information available in ground- 
based FTIR measurements of HCl and HNO, and to 
analyze spectra recorded at Lauder, New 2i;ealand, and 
Arrival Heights, Antarctica. It is shown that the alti- 
tude range of HCl retrievals may be extended by using 
multiple spectral lines. A preliminary analysis of a 
five year record of HNOj at Lauder shows that the 
Pinatubo aerosol caused a large increase of HNO3 in a 
layer at about 20-30 km while having little effect at 
lower altitude. 



1. Introduction 

It has long been understood that ground-based in- 
frared Fourier transform (FTIR) spectra contain in- 
formation on the altitude profile of the absorbing 
molecules in the details of the observed lineshape. 
The current work is part of an ongoing attempt to 
exploit this information by applying techniques previ- 
ously used on ground-based microwave emission 
measurements (e.g. Connor et al., 1995). Results of 
ozone profile retrievals with SFTTl have appeared in 
Pougatchev et al., 1995 and 1996. 

SFrr2 is a radiative transfer and profile retrieval 
algorithm for use with spectra recorded in solar ab- 
sorption. One or more spectral windows recorded at 
one or more zenith angles are fit simultaneously. The 
goodness-of-fit to the measured spectra is controlla- 
ble, and may vary arbitrarily in different spectral in- 
tervals. 1 or 2 trace gas profiles as well as column 
amounts of interfering species, instrumental back- 
ground parameters, wavelength calibration factors, 
and an instrumental lineshape parameter may be re- 
trieved. 

2. Theoretical results 

Ground-based FITR measurements contain profile 
information primarily because of the pressure broad- 
ening of the spectral lines. This fact limits vertical 
resolution to about a pressure scale height, and usu- 
ally limits the altitude range of the retrieved profile to 
approximately the region where the pressure width is 



greater than the Doppler width, or about 25-30 km. 
Traditionally, ground-based FITR measurements have 
been used almost exclusively for determination of the 
total column amount. This is not as direct a measure- 
ment as it might seem, as the integrated absorption 
cannot be taken directly from the spectrum because 
only the relative (not absolute) absorption depth is 
measured. Thus the accuracy of such measurements is 
limited by the ability to calculate the spectrum with a 
radiative transfer model which necessarily includes an 
a priori assumption about the shape of the molecule's 
height profile. This assumption is often the limiting 
factor in the accuracy of the resulting column amount 
Retrieval of the height profile may be expected to 
better exploit the information in the spectra, and so 
improve the accuracy of the column determination. 

The theoretical altitude sensitivity of a given 
measurement may be directly assessed by examination 
of its averaging kernels (Rodgers, 1990). These are 
fiinctions which show explicitly how the atmosphere 
is sampled by the retrieved profile or column. For- 
mally, they are the derivatives of the retrieval with 
respect to the real profile. A perfect measurement 
would sample the intended region of the atmosphere 
uniformly, and not include contributions from outside 
that region. So for example, the averaging kernel for a 
perfect column measurement would be equal to 1 at 
all altitudes, while for a 10-20 km partial column, it 
would be 1 in that altitude range and elsewhere. 

ilHQ 

The HCl averaging kernels are shown in Fig. 1. 
Kernels for 3 different measurements are shown. The 
most familiar measurement is the total column deter- 
mination made by scaling an a priori profile to 
achieve minimum spectral residuals. The kernel for 
that measurement is the thick soUd line marked by 
crosses. It shows that the sampling of the atmosphere 
by the profile scaling technique is highly non- 
uniform This provides a good point of reference for 
the averaging kernels for profile retrieval techniques. 

Two sets of averaging kernels for profile retrieval 
are shown, one for which the analysis uses only the 
Rl line (2926 cm'; dashed curves) and one using the 
Rl, P5 (2776 cm'), and P7 (2728 cm') Uncs simulta- 



485 



neously (solid lines). In both cases high signal to 
noise (500-1000) is assumed. We first describe the Rl 
only measurement.

Fig. 1 HCI averaging kernels for high signal-to-noise. 
Results are shown for a retrieval with 3 spectral lines 
(Rl , P5, and P7) and for the Rl line alone. 

Six separate functions (kernels) are plotted, five for 
partial columns in 10 km thick layers from to 50 
km. and one (thick dashes) for the total column. The 
kernels for the 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 km partial col- 
umns exhibit good sensitivity within their respective 
ranges and fairly good discrimination outside them. 
The kernel for 30-40 km, on the other hand, shows an 
equal response both above and below 40 km, while 
the 40-50 km kernel shows very poor sensitivity at all 
altitudes. In short, the Rl line measurement has good 
sensitivity iip toabbiit 30 km. The kernel for the total 
column is much improved over the profile scaling 
case, showing that altitudes above about 15 km are 
well and uniformly sampled. At lower altitudes there 
is excess sensitivity (molecules will be overcounted) 
in the upper troposphere. 

When the P5 and P7 lines are used along with the 
Rl the kernels plotted as solid lines result. The tro- 
pospheric sensitivity is improved and the upper end of 
the range is extended to about 40 km. This is an inter- 
esting and in part unexpected result The key fact in 
interpreting it is that the pressure broadening coeffi- 
cients of the 3 lines vary over a range of 2.5 times, 
with the P lines being much narrower than the Rl. 
Therefore they will be more sensitive in the tro- 
posphere, since the absorption is less spread out That 
the P lines should improve sensitivity in the upper 
stratosphere is surprising. We believe the explanation 
is that the differing line widths limply that the lines 
respond differently to changes in the HCI profile, 
even at altitudes where the pressure width is less than 
the Doppler widdi, so long as the pressure width is 
still a significant component of the total. By using the 
three lines simultaneously the algorithm is able to 
exploit their differing behavior. 

In summary, theoretical analysis indicates that high 
signal-to-noise measurements of HCI should yield 
good profile information at 10 km resolution up to 30 
km if the Rl line is used, and up to 40 km if the P5 
and P7 lines are included. Furthermore, use of the 
profile retrieval algorithm, as opposed to a profile 



scaling, greatly improves sampling uniformity in the 
total column determination, by reducing dependence 
on the a priori profde shape. 

2.2 HNO, 

The left hand panel of Fig. 2 shows the averaging 
kernels for a high signal-to-noise ratio case, similar to 
that for HCI in Fig. 1. The spectral interval used is 
867-870 cm'. It is usually thought that there is little if 
any profile information in HNOj spectra because of 
the extensive line blending. However, Fig. 2 shows 
that the 10-20 and 20-30 km regions can be distin- 
guished reasonably well. Further, the total column 
kernel exhibits more uniform sensitivity for the profile 
retrieval than for profile scaling, as it did for HCI. 
However, the partial column averaging kernels are 
broader and less well defmed than for HCI, and the 
total column kernel shows less sensitivity in the tro- 
posphere. So while there is significant profile sensi- 
tivity in the HNOj spectra, it is less than for the un- 
blended lines of HCI. The profile information which 
does exist is probably due to the lines being partially 
resolved and to the use of multiple manifolds.

13 Practical Limitations 

Profile retrieval from pressure-broadened line- 
shapes requires the ability both to make high quality, 
low noise measurements, and to accurately simulate 
the observed spectra with a forward model. These are 
demanding requirements, and unfortunately it has not 
been possible to achieve in practice the results which 
might be expected based on the above theoretical 
analysis. In particular, the information available is 
limited by our ability to model the measurements and 
by systematic errors in the measurements themselves. 
Both effects are manifest by spectral residuals which 
are non-random, and larger on average than expected 
from noise. A number of factors are known to con-

For HNOj as measured at Lauder, the effective 
signal-to-noise (determined by the magnitude of the 
spectral residuals) is about 200; the averaging kernels 
for such measurements are shown on the right-hand 
panel of Fig. 2. While the comparison to the high 
signal-to-noise case in the left-hand panel is disap- 
pointing, there is still some ability to distinguish the 2 
layers, and the total column kernel is still better than 
that for profile scaling. In the next section we will 
show results which suggest that useful profile infor- 
mation may be acquired from such measurements in 
practice as well as in theory.

Despite both theoretical and practical limitations, 
early results of profile retrievals on atmospheric data 
are reasonably encouraging. We have made a prelimi- 
nary analysis of the Lauder HNOj data set, and ex- 
perimented with a small number of Lauder HCl meas- 
urements and HNOj measurements from Arrival 
Heights, Antarctica. It should be noted that this is 
work-in-progress, and that further developments can 
be expected.

4. Conclusions 

In summary, a theoretical analysis of the altitude 
sensitivity of FTIR measurements of HCl and HNOj 
shows that significant profile information exists in 
both measurements, and that in the case of HCl the 
range of sensitivity may be extended by use of multi- 
ple spectral lines. Experiments with HCl retrievals 
from Lauder data and HNOj retrievals from Arrival 
Heights have been performed. While the results are 
generally as expected, there is an apparent anomaly in 
the HCl profile which is unexplained. Preliminary 
analysis of a five year time series of HNOj data from 
Lauder shows a behavior in adjacent 10 km layers 
which is different in the 2 layers, yet rcpeatable from 
year to year, and also a response to the Pinatubo aero- 
sol consistent witii priori understanding of that event.

Abstract A recently developed algorithm, SFTH, is 
used to assess profile information available in ground- 
based FTIR measurements of HCl and HNOj and to 
analyze spectra recorded at Lauder, New Zealand, and 
Arrival Heights, Antarctica. It is shown that the alti- 
tude range of HCl retrievals may be extended by using 
multiple spectral lines. A preliminary analysis of a 
five year record of HNOj at Lauder shows that the 
Pinatubo aerosol caused a large increase of HNO) in a 
layer at about 20-30 km while having little effect at 
lower altitude. 



1. Introduction 

It has long been understood that ground-based in- 
frared Fourier transform (FITR) spectra contain in- 
formation on the altitude profile of the absorbing 
molecules in the details of the observed lineshape. 
The current work is part of an ongoing attempt to 
exploit this information by applying techniques previ- 
ously used on ground-based microwave emission 
measurements (e.g. Connor et al., 1995). Results of 
ozone profile retrievals with SFTH have appeared in 
Pougatchev et al., 1995 and 1996. 

SFIT2 is a radiative transfer and profile retrieval 
algorithm for use with spectra recorded in solar ab- 
sorption. One or more spectral windows recorded at 
one or more zenith angles arc fit simultaneously. The 
goodness-of-fit to the measured spectra is controlla- 
ble, and may vary arbitrarily in different spectral in- 
tervals. 1 or 2 trace gas profiles as well as column 
amounts of interfering species, instrumental back- 
ground parameters, wavelength calibration factors, 
and an instrumental lineshape parameter may be re- 
trieved. 

2. Theoretical results 

Ground-based FTIR measurements contain profile 
information primarily because of the pressure broad- 
ening of the spectral lines. This fact limits vertical 
resolution to about a pressure scale height, and usu- 
ally limits the altimde range of the retrieved profile to 
approximately the region where the pressure width is 



greater than the Doppler width, or about 25-30 km. 
Traditionally, ground-based FITR measurements have 
been used almost exclusively for determination of the 
total column amount This is not as direct a measure- 
ment as it might seem, as the integrated absorption 
cannot be taken directly from the spectrum because 
only the relative (not absolute) absorption depth is 
measured. Thus the accuracy of such measurements is 
limited by the ability to calculate the spectrum with a 
radiative transfer model which necessarily includes an 
a priori assumption about the shape of the molecule's 
height ptofile. This assumption is often the limiting 
factor in the accuracy of the resulting column amount 
Retrieval of the height profile may be expected to 
better exploit the information in the spectra, and so 
improve the accuracy of the colunm determination. 

The theoretical altitude sensitivity of a given 
measurement may be directly assessed by examination 
of its averaging kernels (Rodgers, 1990). These are 
functions which show explicitly how the atmosphere 
is sampled by the retrieved profile or column. For- 
mally, they are the derivatives of the retrieval with 
respect to the real profile. A perfect measurement 
would sample the intended region of the atmosphere 
uniformly, and not include contributions from outside 
that region. So for example, the averaging kernel for a 
perfect column measurement would be equal to 1 at 
all altitudes, while for a 10-20 km partial column, it 
would be 1 in that altitude range and elsewhere. 

2.1 HQ 

The HCl averaging kernels are shown in Fig. 1. 
Kernels for 3 different measurements are shown. The 
most familiar measurement is the total column deter- 
mination made by scaling an a priori profile to 
achieve minimum spectral residuals. The kernel for 
that measurement is the thick solid line marked by 
crosses. It shows that the sampling of the atmosphere 
by the profile scaling technique is highly non- 
uniform. This provides a good point of reference for 
the averaging kernels for profile retrieval techniques. 

Two sets of averaging kernels for profile retrieval 
are shown, one for which the analysis uses only the 
Rl line (2926 cm'; dashed curves) and one using the 
Rl, P5 (2776 cm'), and P7 (2728 cm"') lines simulta- 



485 



neously (solid lines). In both cases high signal to 
noise (500-1000) is assumed. We first describe the Rl 
only measurement.

Fig. 1 HCl averaging kernels for high signal-to-noise. 
Results are shown for a retrieval with 3 spectral lines 
(Rl, P5, and P7) and for the Rl line alone. 

Six separate functions (kernels) are plotted, five for 
partial columns in 10 km thick layers from to 50 
km, and one (thick dashes) for the total column. The 
kernels for the 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 km partial col- 
umns exhibit good sensitivity within their respective 
ranges and fairly good discrimination outside them. 
The kernel for 30-40 km, on the other hand, shows an 
equal response both above and below 40 km, while 
the 40-50 km kernel shows very poor sensitivity at all 
altitudes. In short, the Rl line measurement has good 
sensitivity lip tb'abbiit 3() km. The kernel for the total 
column is much improved over the profile scaling 
case, showing that altitudes above about IS km are 
well and uniformly sampled. At lower altitudes there 
is excess sensitivity (molecules will be overcounted) 
in the upper troposphere. 

When the P5 and P7 lines are used along with the 
Rl the kernels plotted as solid lines result The tro- 
pospheric sensitivity is improved and the upper end of 
the range is extended to about 40 km. This is an inter- 
esting and in part unexpected result The key fact in 
interpreting it is that the pressure broadening coeffi- 
cients of the 3 -lines vary over a range of 2.S times, 
with the P lines being much narrower than the Rl. 
Therefore they will be more sensitive in the tro- 
posphere, since the absorption is less spread out That 
the P lines should improve sensitivity in the upper 
stratosphere is surprising. We believe the explanation 
is that the di^eting line widths limply that the lines 
respond differently to changes in the HCl profile, 
even at altitudes where the pressure width is less than 
the Doppler width, so long as the pressure width is 
still a significant component of the total. By using the 
three lines simultaneously the algorithm is able to 
exploit their differing behavior. 

In summary, theoretical analysis indicates that high 
signal-to-noise measurements of HCl should yield 
good profile information at 10 km resolution up to 30 
km if the Rl line is used, and up to 40 km if the P5 
and F*7 lines are included. Furthermore, use of the 
profile retrieval algorithm, as opposed to a profile 



scaling, greatly improves sampling uniformity in the 
total column determination, by reducing dependence 
on the a priori profile shape. 

2.2 HNOj 

The left hand panel of Fig. 2 shows the averaging 
kernels for a high signal-to-noise ratio case, similar to 
that for HCl in Fig. I. The spectral interval used is 
867-870 cm'. It is usually thought that there is little if 
any profile information in HNOj spectra because of 
the extensive line blending. However, Fig. 2 shows 
that the 10-20 and 20-30 km regions can be distin- 
guished reasonably well. Further, the total column 
kernel exhibits more uniform sensitivity for the profile 
retrieval than for profile scaling, as it did for HCl. 
However, the partial column averaging kernels are 
broader and less well defined than for HCl, and the 
total column kernel shows less sensitivity in the tro- 
posphere. So while there is significant profile sensi- 
tivity in the HNOs spectra, it is less than for the un- 
blended lines of HCl. The profile information which 
does exist is probably due to the lines being partially 
resolved and to the use of multiple manifolds.

2,3 Practical Limitatioiis 

Profile retrieval from pressure-broadened line- 
shapes requires the ability both to make high quality, 
low noise measurements, and to accurately simulate 
the observed spectra with a forward model. These are 
demanding requirements, and unfortunately it has not 
been possible to achieve in practice the results which 
might be expected based on the above theoretical 
analysis. In particular, the information available is 
limited by our ability to model the measurements and 
by systematic errors in the measurements themselves. 
Both effects are manifest by spectral residuals which 
are non-random, and larger on average than expected 
from noise. A number of factors are known to con- 
tribute here, including the instrument response func- 
tion, spectroscopic parameters, and forward model 
approximations. The degradation of the available pro- 
file information may be seen m broader and flatter.

tween layers and more influence of the a priori. 

For HNOj as measured at Lauder, the effective 
si^nal-to-noise (determined by the magnitude of the 
spectral residuals) is about 200; the averaging kernels 
for such measurements are shown on the right-hand 
panel of Fig. 2. While the comparison to the high 
signal-to-noise case in the left-hand panel is disap- 
pointing, there is still some ability to distinguish the 2 
layers, and the total column kernel is still better than 
that for profile scaling. In the next section we will 
show results which suggest that useful profile infor- 
mation may be acquired from such measurements in 
practice as well as in theory.

4. Conclusions 

In summary, a theoretical analysis of the altitude 
sensitivity of FTIR measurements of HCl and HNOj 
shows that significant profile information exists in 
both measurements, and that in the case of HCl the 
range of sensitivity may be extended by use of multi- 
ple spectral lines. Experiments with HCl retrievals 
from Lauder data and HNOj retrievals from Arrival 
Heights have been performed. While the results are 
generally as expected, there is an apparent anomaly in 
the HCl profile which is unexplained. Preliminary 
analysis of a five year time series of HNOj data from 
Lauder shows a behavior in adjacent 10 km layers 
which is different in the 2 layers, yet repeatable from 
year to year, and also a response to the Pinatubo aero- 
sol consistent with priori understanding of that event

1. INTRODUCTION 
Spectroscopic parameters of ozone are required for virtually all remote-sensing applications 
involving the chemistry of the troposphere and stratosphere. The vertical distribution of ozone 
also influence the thermal structure of the atmosphere by absorbing and reemitting radiation 
in the 8-12 \xm window. Hence, the knowledge of the O3 vertical distribution is needed for 
climate research.^'* For these reasons, numerous experimental and theoretical investigations 
'have focused on improving our knowledge of infrared, microwave, and electronic ozone spectro- 
scopy.'-* 

The main purpose of this paper is to document the updates to the ozone spectroscopic parameters 
in the 1996 HITRAN compilation.'' A total of 30 bands have been added and nine bands have been 
modified since the 1992 edition,^"'" extending the upper wave number limit of the compilation from 
3400 to 4100 cm" '. The updates include lines of the i«0^*0'''0 and '*0''0'*0 isotopic species 
which appear in the microwave and infrared sections of the compilation for the first time. However, 
the new edition does not include the results of many recent studies, and in fact, presently, no 
parameters are included for the near infrared, visible, and UV spectral regions. Therefore, as 
a second part of the paper, we provide a brief overview of recent laboratory and modeHng work on 
ozone and its isotopes and highlight areas in need of further investigation. Finally, we present the 
identification of lines of V3 bands of »«0'*0'''0 and i«0'^0'*0 in high-resolution infrared 
ground-based and stratospheric solar absorption spectra.

Introduction 

The role of chlorinated fluorocarbons in the catalytic 
destruction of stratospheric ozone [Molina and Rowland, 1974; 
Stolarski and Cicerone, 1974] and greenhouse warming 
[Ramanathan, 1975] has lead to a series of international 
agreements [e.g.. United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), 
1987] limiting their use. Hydrogenated chlorofluorocarbons 
(HCFCs) are now widely used as replacements in industrial 
applications. These substitutes are similar to the fully halogenated 
fluorocarbons in physical and chemical properties, but they have 
shorter lifetimes due to their reactivity with OH radicals m the 
troposphere. The reduced radiative forcing and reduced potential 
for stratospheric ozone destruction [Fisher et al., 1990a, b] have 
made the HCFCs important replacements until suitable 
nonchlorinated compounds become available. 

The molecule HCFC-22 (CHCIFJ is widely employed as a 
substitute for CFC-U (CC1,F) and CFC-12 (CCl^F,) [Alternative 
Fluorocarbons Environmental Acceptability Study, (AFEAS), 
1995] Since 1980, atmospheric emissions of HCFC-22 have 
increased at a rate of about 8.5% yr' [NASA, 1994]. 
Approximately 3% of the tropospheric anthropogenic 
organochlorine loading is contained in HCFC-22 [World 
Meteorological Organization, {WMO) 1991, section 1.11].

Absorption by HCFC-22 was first identified in the infrared by 
Goldman et al. [1981]. In that work, the narrow, unresolved Q 
branch of the 2V6 band was measured in stratospheric solar 
occultation spectra recorded with a balloon-borne Fourier 
transform spectrometer. That investigation was followed by a 
series of ground-based, balloon-borne, and space-based IR studies 
(see the summary by Zander et al. [1994]), including recent trend 
studies based on total columns measured from the International 
Scientific Station of the Jungfraujoch (ISSJ), Switzerland (altitude 
3580 m 46 5°N latitude. 8.0°E longitude), between June 1986 and 
November 1992 [Zander et al., 1994], the National Solar 
Observatory on Kitt Peak (altitude 2090 m, latitude 31.9-N. 
longitude 111.6°W) near Tucson, Arizona, between December 
1980 and April 1992 [Zander et al, 1994], and the Table 
Mountain Facility (TMF). Wrightwood. California (34.4°N, 
117.7°W) [Irion et al. 1994]. In situ measurements have also 
been used to measure concentrations and the trend of HCFC-22. 
The most recent set of surface level air-sampling measurements 
of HCFC-22 were derived from analysis of flasks and archived air 
samples from sites between 90°S and 82°N latitude [Montdui et 
al., 1993]. The global U-end between 1987 and 1992 was 
calculated and the southern hemisphere linear trend in 1992 was 
inferred from the measured interhemispheric difference in HCFC- 
22 concentration. The interhemispheric HCFC-22 ratio has been 
estimated recently from simultaneous total column HCFC-22 and 
Hfi measurements from IR spectra recorded in California and 
Antarctica [Irion et al., 1994]. 

In this paper, we report the analysis of the first extensive time 
series of HCFC-22 infrared spectroscopic measurements recorded 
from the southern hemisphere. The observations were obtained 
from the Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change 
(NDSC) station in Lauder, New Zealand (altitude 0.37 km, 
latitude 45''S, longitude WO'E). The Under station is located in 
a small town (population -50) in a region of minimal industnal

and best fit calculated spectra and presents molecular 
identifications of the principal absorption features. Residuals 
(measured minus calculated values) are shown in the top panel on 
an expanded vertical scale. A total of seven parameters were 
fitted: a single parameter to scale the initial vertical distribution 
of each of the four main absorbing molecules (HCFC-22, Oj, 
COj, and HjO), a parameter to retrieve the shift between the 
wavenumber scales of the measured and the synthetic spectra, and 
parameters to model the level and slope of the 100% transmission 
envelope. The residual spectrum shows the adequacy of the 
present model in reproducing the measured absorption features to 
the noise level of the data. The 0.5% residuals in the ozone 
features are attributed to the shortcomings of the monthly mean 
P-T profiles and the assumed ozone volume mixing ratio. As for 
the sensitivity to the assumed P-T profiles, we estimate that 
uncertainty in the absorption due to interfering species introduces 
a random error of 1 % in HCFC-22 column retrievals. 

A low-frequency channel spectrum has been identified in some 
of the early spectra. For these cases, additional parameters were 
included in the analysis to model the relative amplitude, period, 
and phase of the channel spectrum. The introduction of these 
additional parameters allowed the channeling to be fitted to the 
noise level. 

Table 1 summarizes the sources of errors and the 
corresponding uncertainties in the HCFC-22 total columns 
attributed to the uncertainties in each component. Except for 
spectra with channeling, the most important sources of random 
error are the finite signal-to-noise ratio of the data and errors in 
fitting nearby interfering lines. The uncertainty in the 
spectroscopic line parameters is the dominant source of systematic 
error. We have retained the Zander line parameters for 
comparison purposes, as noted earlier.

with error bars representing the standard deviations of the 
monthly means. The number of measurements per month ranged 
from 6 to 30 for the post- 1990 observations with approximately 
one half of the measurements recorded during 1994. The solid 
curve in Figure 2 shows the fit to the data derived with the 
exponential increase model. This curve corresponds to a best fit 
column increase rate of (7.5±0.3)% yr ', lo, and May 1985 and 
November 1994 total columns (in 10" molecules cm"^) of 1. 10

is obtained with the linear increase model (dashed line), which 
returned a best fit colunrm increase rate of (5.9±0.2)% yr"', lo, for 
1994.0, and May 1985 and November 1994 total columns (in 10"

activity, so that the results should be representative of background 
conditions. The measurements cover the May 1985 to November 
1994 time period and are analyzed here to derive the long-term 
trend in the HCFC-22 total column. In addition, the south-north 
hemispheric HCFC-22 ratio is derived from comparisons of the 
Lauder southern hemisphere HCFC-22 columns with the altitude- 
corrected columns from two northern hemisphere sites. All 
columns were derived using the same set of spectroscopic 
parameters {Zander et ai. 1994; Irion et al, 1994]. This paper 
and the Zander et ai, [1994] paper used the same analysis 
method. Spectrum FIT (SFIT). which is briefly described below 
in the measurements and data analysis section. The Irion et al. 
[1994] paper used the ATMOS software, described by Norton and 
Rinsland [1991]. The present results are compared with recently 
published measurements, trends, and determinations of the 
interhemispheric HCFC-22 ratio. 

Measurements and Data Analysis 



The bulk of the 670 solar spectra analyzed for the HCFC-22 
total column was recorded between October 1990 and November 
1994 with a Bruker 120 M Fourier transform spectrometer 
operating at unapodized resolutions of 0.0035 or 0.006 cm ', a 
KCl beam splitter, and a liquid-nitrogen cooled HgCdTe detector. 
The individual spectra (typical signal-to-noise ratio of 150) cover 
the 750-950 cm' region (October 1990 to March 1993 
measurements) or 750-1250 cm' (April 1993-November 1994 
measurements) and have been used previously to derive total 
column abundances of HNO, [Jones et ai. 1994], COFj 
[Reisinger et al., 1994], and ClONOj [Reisinger et ai, 1995]. 
These measurements have been supplemented by earlier solar 
spectra recorded at Lauder during campaigns in May 1985, June 
1986, and February 1987 conducted in conjunction with the 
University of Denver. The campaign measurements cover the 750- 
1250 cm' region and were recorded with a Bomem Fourier 
transform spectrometer operating at a spectral resolution of 0.02 
cm' [Murcray et ai, 1989]. The target HCFC-22 absorption 
feature in both data sets is the narrow, unresolved CH^ClFj 2Vs 
band Q branch at 829.05 cm '. This feature is relatively weak, and 
therefore only spectra recorded at astronomical zenith angles 
above about 70° were analyzed in order to maximize the signal- 
to-noise ratio in the CHClFj Q branch feature. Only 15 suitable 
spectra were available from the pre- 1990 observations, whereas 
up to 30 spectra were analyzed from favorable months of 1993 
and 1994. 

The CHCIF2 total columns were derived from nonlinear least 
squares spectral fittings to the 828.7-831.0 cm' interval 
containing the HCFC-22 Q branch and lines of HjO. CO,, and O,. 
The SFIT, PC-based line-by-line retrieval algorithm used in these 
retrievals [cf. Rinsland et ai, 1994] assumes an atmosphere 
comprised of 29 homogeneous layers with vertical thicknesses of 
I km In the troposphere increasing to 2 km in the stratosphere 
and 5 to 10 km in the mesosphere. The pressure and temperature, 
as a function of altitude, are inputs to a ray-tracing program 
[Gallery et ai, 1983] to calculate the total air mass, mass- 
weighted temperatures, and mass-weighted pressures for each 
layer along the refracted ray path. For the purposes of this 
calculation we used monthly mean tropospheric and stratospheric 
pressure and temperature profiles, as measured by radiosondes 
launched weekly at the site, in preference to the U.S. Standard 
Atmosphere pressure-temperature (P-T) profiles. Sensitivity 
studies indicate that the use of monthly mean P-T profiles 
introduce a random error of the order of 1% (Table 1) in the 
retrieved HCFC-22 column. 



The volume mixing ratio (VMR) versus altitude distribution 
assumed for CHCIF^ is the "reference 1" profile of Zander et ai 
[1994, Table 1]. This profile assumes the mean 1985 
ATMOS/Spacelab 3 measurements above 12 km altitude [Zander 
et ai, 1987] and an extension with an almost constant VMR value 
in the troposphere. The CHClFj total vertical column 
corresponding to this distribution is 1.11 x 10" molecules cm" . 
The vertical profile distributions assumed for other molecules 
have been taken from reference lists, e.g.. Smith [1982]. 
Spectroscopic line parameters for CHCIF^ assumed in this work 
are the same as those described by Zander et ai [1994]. Recently, 
temperature- and pressure-dependent absorption cross sections 
have been derived for the HCFC-22 829.05-cm ' Q branch 
[Varanasi, 1992]. Zander et ai [1994] report excellent 
compatibility between their line parameters and values derived 
with the high-resolution absorption cross sections of Varanasi 
[1992]. We have chosen to retain the previous set of 
spectroscopic parameters in our analysis to maintain consistency 
with the previously reported IR measurements. The spectroscopic 
parameters for other gases were taken from a line list essentially 
the same as the 1992 HITRAN compilation [Rothman et ai, 

1992].

seasonal cycle is apparent in the 1985-1988 surface measurements 
from Cape Grim, Tasmania (41°S) [Montzka et al, 1993, Figure 
3], the only previous long-term, southern hemisphere HCFC-22 
data set, but published model-calculated total columns for the 
southern hemisphere predict a ±3% seasonal variation with a peak 
in August [Irion et al., 1994, Figure 3]. The same model predicts 
no seasonal variation in the northern hemisphere [Irion et al., 
1994, Fiure. 3], consistent with the analysis by Zander et al. 
[1994] of their 1986-1992 46.5°N latitude ISSJ total column 
measurement data set. 

In Table 2 the trend in the HCFC-22 total column deduced 
from the Lauder spectra is compared with recent trend 
measurements derived from infrared total columns [Zander et al., 
1994; Irion et al., 1994] and surface level air-sampling 
measurements [Montzka et al., 1993]. The agreement between the 
present results and these previous determinations is excellent. 

The HCFC-22 interhemispheric ratio has been derived by two 
methods. In the first method the infrared total column 
measurements from Lauder are compared with similar 
measurements from ISSJ [Zander et al, 1994]. Both studies (and 
that of Irion et al.) were performed with identical sets of 
spectroscopic line parameters. The ISSJ observatory is located at 
46.5°N, thus we obtain an approximate 45°N-45°S 
interhemispheric ratio, once altitude differences have been 
applied. The relative difference in the HCFC-22 column above the 
two stations was first calculated assuming the same vertical 
distribution above both sites and a constant volume mixing ratio 
between 0.37 and 3.58 km, the altitudes of Lauder and ISSJ, 
respectively. This factor, 1.508, was used to scale the ISSJ total 
columns derived for mid-year 1991 and 1992 [Zander et al, 
1994, Table 3] to correspond to values for the altitude of the 
Lauder station. The scaled ISSJ columns and the corresponding 
Lauder measurements are given in Table 3 along with the

computed south/north column ratios. The mean of the two 
determinations is 0.83. Similarly, Lauder columns were corrected 
to Jungfraujoch altitudes and interhemispheric ratios recalculated. 
The ratios agreed to within 2%, providing some confirmation of 
uniform mixing of HCFC-22 in the lower troposphere, and the 
long chemical lifetime of HCFC-22 in this region of the 
atmosphere. Thus given the uncertainty in the determinations of 
the columns at the two sites and the uncertainty in the assumed 
vertical profile shapes, this result is estimated to be accurate to 
better than 5%. 

Spectra containing the v,+2\)2 band of N2O at 2440 cm' have 
been recorded at Lauder since August 1993, permitting an 
independent determination of the interhemispheric ratio. 
Following the development of Irion et al. [1994] in which the 
NjO column serves as a surrogate air mass, we have calculated 
the HCFC-22/ N^O column ratio for 56 days in 1994 when 
spectra in both wavenumber intervals were recorded. To calculate 
an interhemispheric ratio for HCFC-22. the northern hemisphere 
HCFC-22/NjO ratios derived by Irion et al. were extrapolated to 
mid 1994, and assuming a negligible latitudinal or 
interhemispheric gradient in N,0 [Prinn et. at., 1991], this was 
ratioed with the corresponding ratio from Lauder data. Using this 
method we have calculated an interhemispheric ratio of 0.91 ± 
0.10. 

Our values of 0.83 ± 0.04 and 0.91 ± 0.10 may be compared 
with the south/north hemispheric ratio of 0.88 ± 0.04, lo, derived 
by Irion et al. [1994] from the results of surface-sampling 
measurements between 82°N and 90°S latitude reported by 
Montzka et al [1993], and 0.86 ± 0.08 derived from total column 
HCFC-22 aiid N^O measurements recorded in California and 
Antarctica [Irion et al, 1994]. These measurements also show 
that the largest gradient in the HCFC-22 instantaneous mixing 
ratio occurs in the tropics and that the midlatitudes data are 
characteristic of the latitude-weighted interhemispheric difference 
(S.A. Montzka, personal communication, 1996). Therefore the 
comparison between the two results is appropriate. All 
measurements agree within the respective uncertainties. 

Conclusions 

In this paper we have reported HCFC-22 total columns derived 
from the analysis of 670 high-resolution infrared solar absorption 
spectra recorded on 394 days between May 1985 and November 
1994 at the NDSC station in Lauder, New Zealand. The results 
show a steady, factor of 2.0 increase in the total column over the 
9.5-year span of the measurements. The exponential and linear 
increase rates and la uncertainties of (7.5 ± 0.3)% yr' and (5.9

measurements are in excellent agreement with previous 
determinations of the trend through 1992 \Txmder et ai, 1994; 
Montzka el al., 1993] and indicate that rapid accumulation of 
HCFC-22 in the atmosphere continued during 1993 and 1994. 
Comparisons of total columns measured at the Lauder station with 
corresponding values measured at ISSJ [Zander et at.. 1994] 
indicate an instantaneous south/north hemispheric ratio of 0.83 ± 
0.04. An independent calculation, based on the ratio of HCFC-22 
and N,0 columns gives an interhemispheric ratio of 0.91 ± 0.10 
for HCFC-22. These results are in agreement within the 
uncertainties with previous determinations based on surface air 
sampling [Montzka el ai. 1993] and infrared total column [Irion 
et ai, 1994] measurements.

University of Denver infrared spectral atlases 



A. Goldman, R. D. Blatherwick, F. J. Murcray, and D. G. Murcray 



Atmospheric and laboratory atlases of high-resolution infrared absorption spectra have^een generated 
from data obtained with the University of Denver Michelson-type interferometer balloon-borne 
spectrometer systems. The main objectives of the atlas work have been thejdentification and the 
detailed analvs^s of stratospheric infrared high-resolution spectral features. The stratosphenc atlwes 
cover many spectral intervals and provide tables ofline positions an dlpecies identifications. High Sun 
spectra are used for identification of solar lines. Latest editions of these atlases include selected 
sections in the 760-1950- and 800-i:00-cra-' regions at 0.02- and 0.002-cm-' resolutions, respectively. 
In addition to the stratospheric atlases, ground-based and laboratory spectral atlases have also been 
produced. The laboratory spectra of many molecules relevant to stratosphenc chemistry have been 
obtained A number of ongoing spectroscopic studies have been developed on the basis of the atlas 
work including studies of solar and atmospheric spectral features, c 1996 Optical Society of Amenca 



1. Introduction 

The spectral atlas project at the University of Den- 
ver DUi has been dedicated to the identification of 
stratospheric IR spectral features present in high- 
resolution solar spectra and to the spectroscopic 
analvsis of specific stratospheric molecules such as 
O3, HNO3, CIONO2, COF2, NO2, O2, CoHg, and others. 
The more recent of these studies have been based on 
balloon-borne solar absorption spectra at 0.002-cm-' 
resolution and corresponding laboratory spectra. 

The atlases produced by this work serve as state-of- 
the-art catalogs of atmospheric absorption features 
for use by researchers in identifying features in their 
own data. The line parameters generated from the 
spectroscopic analysis are essential to the quantifica- 
tion of molecular species from IR spectra. These 
line parameters have, in most cases, been added to 
the HITRAN (high-resolution transmission molecu- 
lar absorption) and other databases used by atmo- 
spheric spectroscopists. 

Initially, solar spectra for the atlas project were 
collected from Denver (elevation 1.6 km and the 
nearbv Mt. Evans lelevation 4.3 km: by the use of a 
0.06-cm-' resolution (apodized) interferometer sys- 
tem. From these data, the 775-1300- and 1925-

2175-cm-i regions of the atlas have been completed 
and pubUshed in two volumes.^ 

A short summary of the atlas work is given in 
Table 1. In 1978, the atmospheric spectroscopy 
group at DU started obtaining IR spectra with a 
0.02-cm"' resolution lapodizedi interferometer sys- 
tem. A large number of high-quality spectra have 
been obtained, including laboratory spectra, ground- 
based solar spectra, and aircraft-borne and balloon- 
borne solar spectra. The spectra were obtained in 
selected intervals in the 550-2300-cm-' region. 
Many of the laboratory spectra at 0.06- and 0.02- 
cm"'' resolutions have been pubHshed as a CRC 
handbook.^ 

Numerous excellent 0.02-cm-i resolution spectra 
were also obtained from the South Pole, which is a 
unique site for IR observations, in December 1978 
and December 1980. Thus work was also started on 
the Atlas of South Pole IR Solar Spectra.^ The first 
edition of the South Pole Atlas, including the 760- 
960-cm"i region, was published in March 1982. In 
the next large-format edition the 1220-1340-cm 1 
region was added. '^ 

The first large-format edition of the stratosphenc 
atlas, at 0.02-cm-i resolution, was published in 
February 1982.-' Several updated editions have 
since been issued, the most recent of which is the 
September 1987 edition.-' This atlas now covers the 
entire spectral region from 760 to 1950 cm"', except 
for the 960-1060-cm-i interval. The total number 
of spectral features identified as being genuine itellu- 
ric or solan exceeded 14.000. In parallel with the 
atmospheric spectra work, the laboratory spectra'^

were used not only to support the identification and 
the quantification of measured atmospheric features 
but also for molecular spectroscopy analysis. Nu- 
merous scientific publications resulting from the 
atlas work are listed in that report.'' 

In 1986 our atmospheric spectroscopy group at DU 
began using a new Bomem interferometer system 
with a total path difference of 250 cm and an 
unapodized FWHM resolution of 0.002 cm'^ The 
system was modified for balloon-borne measure- 
ments of IR solar spectra and has also been used to 
obtain numerous ground-based solar spectra and 
laboratory spectra. The 0.002-cm-i resolution ex- 
ceeds both the previous DU and the atmospheric 
trace molecule spectroscopy ATMOSi resolutions, 
and thus the DU balloon-borne spectra obtained 
since 1986 have revealed many new atmospheric 
features especially those stratospheric features that 
are blended at lower resolution' and have become an 
invaluable source for extending the atlases' work 
and probing the atmospheric trace gases. 

Results obtained from the high-resolution atlas 
studies are presented in the preliminary November 
1989 and April 1990 editions of the Atlas of Very 
High Resolution Stratospheric IR Absorption Spec- 
tra and the subsequent December 1990, April 1992, 
April 1993, and October 1994 editions.^ The spec- 
tra are now displayed in frames of 2-cm~^ intervals, 
which are needed to show the fine details of the 
spectra. The tabulated line positions were deter- 
mined with the same line-marking computer pro- 
gram employed in our previous atlases. For well- 



resolved lines, line positions given here have an 
estimated accuracy of ±0.0002 cm"' with reference 
to standard calibration lines of CO2 and NaO.'^ 

In the April 1993 edition, we added the 1540-1560- 
cm~' region, thus bringing the total number of 
spectral features identified as being genuine to over 
3300. Data for this new addition were recorded 
during a balloon flight from Palestine, Texas, on 17 
June 1991, with the exception of the top displayed 
scan high Sun scant, which is from a flight conducted 
from Ft. Sumner, New Mexico, on 19 April 1989. 
In the October 1994 edition, we added the 1560-1610- 
cm-i region, thus bringing the total number of 
spectral features identified as being genuine to over 
3500. Numerous publications describing findings 
from the 0.002-cm-' atlas work are listed in the atlas 
reports.^ 

Since 1990, our atmospheric spectroscopy group at 
DU has acquired improved Bomem and Bruker 
0.002-cm-' interferometers. These have been em- 
ployed for the NASA NDSC Network for the Detec- 
tion of Stratospheric Change) and other field measure- 
ments programs. Data from these systems have 
been available for studies that are complementary to 
the atlas work. 

Our ongoing laboratory spectra measurements 
have produced a large number of 0.002-cm-i resolu- 
tion spectra in selected spectral regions from 750 to 
3000 cm->. These include CCI4, CCI2F2, CsHe, CF4, 
CHCI3, CH2O, CH3CI, H2O2, HCOOH, HNO3, NO2, 
CIONO2, COF2, and COCI2, which are being pre- 
pared for an extended laboratory atlas.^ These 



2822 APPLIED OPTICS Vol. 35, No. 16 1 June 1996 



spectra are used for the identification and the quan- 
tification of atmospheric spectral features by either 
complete spectroscopic quantum-mechanical analy- 
sis or semiempirical methods. Several spectral re- 
gions, which include previously unidentified fea- 
tures of CIONO2, HNO3, COF2, and more, are 
currently under analysis and will be added to the 
atlas in the near future. 

During the atlas work, a number of atmospheric 
and solar features were identified, including the first 
spectral identification of stratospheric CIONO2, CF4, 
CHCIF.2IF-22I, C2H6, C2H2, HCOOH, and solar OH. 
Stratospheric mixing-ratio profiles were retrieved 
for most of the molecules of atmospheric chemistry 
interest. Below, however, we present in some detail 
several of the research topics of current interest that 
originated on the basis of the atlas work: O2 forbid- 
den lines in (O-li X^lg-, HNO3 hot bands, OH pure 
rotation lines, and solar emission IR lines.

The first identification and the initial line-parameter 
calculations of the electric-quadrupole eqi 1 0-1 ! vibra- 
tion-rotation O2 lines in X^lg were made on the 
basis of a peculiar unidentified triplet near 1603.8 
cm^' in DU balloon-borne 0.02-cm"^ resolution spec- 
[j.^ 10-12 These O2 transitions were soon confirmed 
in laboratory spectra.'^ In an unrelated study, eq

both eq and md transitions, the intensity calcula- 
tions were done^^'^'' from Hund's case 'b , and a single 
md moment was used with the energy eigenvectors 
for the md lines. Subsequent line-intensity calcula- 
tions of the eq lines in intermediate coupling starting 
from Hund's case la' and including vibration- 
rotation effects on the line intensities showed only 
minor improvements for a few lines compared with 
the initial eq intensity calculations in Hund's case 
bi.'^" 

Improved energy level constants'® prompted a new 
calculation of the line parameters.'^ These results 
provided improved agreement with DU high-resolu- 
tion (0.002-cm~') stratospheric spectra up to all the 
high J values observed. However, an ongoing line- 
intensity problem, which was mostly due to the (0-1) 
md lines, persisted. The comparisons of synthetic 
spectra with the observed spectra show excessive 
calculated intensity in the QP and QR lines and 
missing intensity in the QQ lines. 

The DU 0.002-cm-' resolution October 1994 atlas^ 
shows a number of frames with O2 eq and md lines 
among the other species. The complete identifica- 
tion list is in the Tables volume of the atlas. Figure 
2 shows the 1552-1553-cm"' section from the atlas, 
along with a theoretical simulation of the atmo- 
spheric components, including the eq and md O2 
lines. It demonstrates how the QR and the QP md 
lines are overcalculated. Additional quantitative

spectral fits of the simulations to the obsened 
spectra show how the O. md QQ hnes are undercalcu- 

lated. 

More recently, intermediate coupling intensity cal- 
culations starting from Hund's case -a'' were per- 
formed for the md lines with both parallel and 
perpendicular dipole moments. -^o-i These calcula- 
tions show significant intensity variation as a func- 
tion of the ratio of the parallel and the perpendicular 
components and that an optimal ratio of approxi- 
mately -0.1 improves the agreement with the ob- 
served spectra. Figure 3 shows such typical com- 
parisons. 

It is also anticipated that the corresponding elec- 
tric-dipole '^Qi^O lines will be obsen^able in the 
atmospheric spectra. Line parameters have been 
generated on the basis of published i«02 constants 
and theoretical isotopic ratios, and a search for these 
lines is being conducted. 

3. HNO3 Hot Bands 

The stratospheric and laboratory atlases' w'ork has 
contributed significantly to the study of the HNO3 
bands. The earher studies are too numerous to be 
discussed here. Of particular current interest are 
the recent and the ongoing studies of the hot bands 
and of the line and band intensities. 

In the 25-pm HNO3 region dominated by vg, the 
HITRAN 1992 compilation provides line parameters 
only for the V9 band.22 xhe vg line positions are 
based on the analysis of high-resolution laboratory

spectra.-" and the total band intensity is derived 
from previous low-resolution broadband measure- 
ment?.-' Recent extensive studies of this repon at 
hieh resolution led to a revised consistent identifica- 
tio^n of the hot bands in this region, and line param- 
eters for several of these bands are being generated.^^ 
New quantitative tunable diode laser measurements 
of individual intensities of vg lines and a correspond- 
ing total band intensity are in progress.-'' 

The new hot-band work in the vg region also 
provided interesting new results for the 11-pm re- 
gion dominated by vs and 2V9I. We have been 
aware, since 1971, of a weak band in the HXO3 
spectra near 830 cm'i. With the recent work, it 
became possible to assign this absorption to the 
3v9 - vg Q-branch and provide quantitative analysis 
of both laboratory and atmospheric spectra.-' The 
high-resolution laboratory spectra of this region 
clearly show torsional splitting in the V3 = 3 level. 

Quantitative analysis of atmospheric spectra of 
HNO3 is mostly performed from selected manifolds 
from the 1-5, 2'v9 region. The line parameters of 
these two bands have been improved significantly.^^ 
They show very good agreement with both labora- 
tory and atmospheric spectra and are included in the 
HITRAN 1995 compilation. However, the analysis 
of the hot-band transitions in this region is still 
incomplete. 

HITRAN '92 lists two hot bands^s g^ 877 and at 
885 cm"', which are assigned as v, + vg - i-g and 
3v9 - Vg, respectively. The first one is incorrect and 
has been ehminated from the line data. The second 
band is clearly seen in our laboratory and strato- 
spheric spectra as a sharp Q-branch centered at 
885.425 cm"^ The recent vg hot-band work allows 
us to assign it to V5 -i- vg - vg and provides initial line 
parameters for quantitative simulations. This work 
is in progress. Individual transitions from the V5 - 
Vg - Vg are not assigned yet, and additional studies 
are required. Figures 4 and 5 show recent DU 
0.002-cm"' balloon-borne data with the V5 ^ vg - vg 
analysis. For atmospheric applications, it is fortu- 
nate' that most of the absorption by this band is 
concentrated in the narrow Q-branch region, with 
only weak absorption outside. However, the spectro- 
scopic analysis of the Q-branch is difficult because of 
a lack of fine structure! and is still incomplete. 

Several recent and ongoing studies have been 
dedicated to a more accurate and consistent determi- 
nation of the absolute intensity for the HNO3 bands 
in the vo. V3 V4, and V5, 2v9 regions. The work is not 
complete, and the standing recommendation is to 
normalize to previous results^" with the proper hot- 
band correction. 

Further improvements are expected from inten- 
sity measurements of individual lines in this region, 
which is in progress.

features of stratospheric species in this region, which 
are mostly due to CF2CI2 (CFC-121 and HNO3. 
These spectral features are resolved to numerous 
components at higher resolution, and the detailed

Additional observations and studies of OH and O 
in the solar photosphere followed, on the basis of the 
DU spectra32 and of the Kitt Peak spectra.33 The 
latter provided Iv = lines up to u = 3. Further 
extension of the identification of the solar pure 
rotation OH lines were accomplished from the 
ATMOS solar spectra, with lines up to 1 4-4 .^^ 

Line parameters for the pure rotation OH lines 
were generated since their first identification, with 
the available state-of-the-art spectroscopic constants 
and assuming a fixed dipole moment function of 
1 667D.35 Improved absolute intensity by wave-

data sets to generate a new set of molecular con-

The 12-pm solar emission lines were initially ob- 
served in DU 1976 ground-based solar spectra at 
811.575 and 818.058 cm"' as two suspicious fea- 
tures which were deleted in the DU June 1980 
atlas 1 This can be seen in the 800-825-cm-i frame 
of the atlas. The features were confirmed by contin- 
ued investigation of ground-based, aircraft, and bal- 
loon-borne spectra obtained with different interfer- 
ometers and displayed simultaneously.*^ Unknown 
to the authors, the same features were also observed, 
but not reported, in the Kitt Peak spectra. 

Subsequently these features were identified as 
hicrh / Rvdberg transitions of Mg I." Additional Mg 
I and Ai I lines were identified,*' and the emission 
lines were found to exhibit Zeeman splitting. ■ 
More recently, a number of investigators hav-e worked 
with both the Kitt Peak and the ATMOS solar 
spectra on the modeling of line formation mboth the 
quiet Sun and the sunspot penumbra.*'-*' These

6. Summary 

Since 1978, the DU atmospheric spectroscopy group 
has published several spectral atlases of atmo- 
spheric IR spectra obtained from ground-based and 
balloon-borne platforms as well as from laborator\- 
data. 

The spectra in these atlases have provided the first 
spectroscopic identification and quantification of a 
number of stratospheric molecular species and have 
been the basis for the generation of many sets of new 
spectroscopic line parameters. 

The atlas work at DU has been supported by the 
National Science Foundation, Atmospheric Chemis- 
try Division. Acknowledgment is made to the Na- 
tional Center for Atmospheric Research, which is 
supported by the National Science Foundation, for 
computer time used in this research.

Abstract. Ozone total columns have been derived from 13 spec- 
tral intervals in 5 infrared bands and compared with values 
deduced from correlative measurements with a Dobson 
spectrophotometer. The observations were recorded on 10 days 
in 1994 at the Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change 
station in Lauder, New Zealand. The infrared total columns were 
derived from spectral fittings of unblended, temperature- 
insensitive ozone lines in high resolution solar absorption spectra. 
The line parameters on the 1992 HITRAN compilation were 
assumed with the O3 and HjO relative volume mixing ratio and 
temperature profiles specified from correlative balloon 
ozonesonde, microwave O3, and radiosonde measurements. The 
retrieved IR/Dobson total column ratios ranged from 0.96 to 1.02 
with the lower wavenumber bands yielding lower ratios. The 
results do not support the revised O3 intensity scale currently 
used to process O3 infrared measurements from 2 instruments on 
the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite. 

Introduction 

Accurate measurement of the total vertical column of ozone 
and its variation with time are crucial experimental problems in 
environmental science. For several reasons, ground-based 
infrared solar absorption spectroscopy is an attractive option 
among the methods in use for measuring O3. First, high spectral 
resolution (<0.005 cm'') is obtainable with modem, commerical 
Fourier transform spectrometers. Measurements at high 
resolution make it possible to select unsaturated, temperature- 
insensitive ozone features with minimal overlap by interfering 
lines. Suitable transitions are available between 2.3 and 13 /im. 
Second, extensive laboratory work on ozone in the infrared has 
been performed during the last several years. These studies have 
resulted in improved positions, intensities, air-broadening 
coefficients, and their temperature dependences [Flaud et al., 
1992]. Finally, solar absorption spectroscopy avoids the need for 
radiance calibration since the analysis is performed by fitting the 
measured spectral features with respect to the local 100% 
transmittance level. This level is accurately retrieved as part of 
the spectral fitting procedure. Therefore, biases produced by 
changes in instrument calibration are avoided. 

IR absorption spectroscopy is however affected by uncertain- 
ties of several percent in the absolute O3 line intensities on the

1992 HITRAN compilation [Rothman et al., 1992]. In an attempt 
to improve the accuracy, Pickett etal. [1992] derived absolute 
intensities for 49 lines in the 9.6 /im V3 band based on 
simultaneous O3 absorption measurements in the IR and at 
253.7 nm, where the absolute cross section is known to 1%. A 
multiplicative factor of 1.051 for the V3 intensities on the 1992 
HITRAN compilation [Rothman et ai. 1992] was derived, and 
has been applied in the analysis of the 9.6 /Jm O, measurements 
recorded by the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) 
[Bruhl et al., 1996] and the Improved Stratospheric and 
Mesospheric Sounder (ISAMS) [Connor et ai, 1996] instalments 
on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS). The 1992 
HITRAN parameters are assumed in the analysis for O3 from the 
14 /im UARS CLAES (Cryogenic Limb Etalon Spectrometer) 
instrument measurements [Bailey et al. 1996]. 

Additional problems with the infrared approach are the effects 
of uncertainties in the instrument line shape, the assumed vertical 
volume mixing ratio distributions of the target and interfering 
molecules, and the temperature profile [Zander et ai, 1994]. The 
source of line shape problem appears to be optical misalignments 
in the instrument which cause the actual line shape to differ from 
the theoretical one calculated on the basis of the internal field of 
view, the applied apodization function, and the maximum optical 
path difference. Sensitivity studies have shown that biases of up 
to several percent in retrieved total columns can result if these 
effects are not modeled [Zander et ai, 1994]. 

Recently, David et al. [1993] compared infrared total columns 
measured at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, with correlative Dobson 
spectrophotometer measurements. Based on 2 windows about 
0.5cm-' wide centered near 1146 and 1163 cm', the 1992 
HITRAN compilation spectral parameters [Rothman et al, 1992], 
and an initial O3 profile based on seasonally averaged measure- 
ments, the authors deduced IR total columns on average 1.046 
times lower than the Dobson values. Assuming the Pickett et al 
[1992] scaling of the 1992 HITRAN intensities [Rothman et al, 
1992], the average difference increased to 9.9% with the IR 
columns remaining systematically lower. 

The Dobson/IR discrepancy noted above highlights the need 
for further investigations to ascertain the quality of ozone total 
columns derived from high resolution IR techniques. We report 
here comparisons between ozone total columns deduced from 
13 spectral intervals covering 5 infrared bands and correlative 
Dobson total columns. The measurements were recorded on 
10 days at the Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change 
(NDSC) [Kurylo, 1991] station in Lauder, New Zealand (45.04'S, 
I69.68°E. 0.37 km a.s.l.). The sample is large enough to 
determine a statistically meaningful mean IR/Dobson column 
ratio and root-mean-square deviarion of this ratio for each 
spectral interval. Correlative profile measurements of ozone, 
temperature, and water vapor have been assumed to minimize 
errors arising from uncertainties in these parameters.

RINSLAND ET AL.: COMPARISON OF IR AND DOBSON OZONE COLUMNS 



Measurements 

The infrared solar spectra were recorded on 10 days between 
February 14, 1994, and October 21, 1994, with a Bruker 120 M 
Fourier transform spectrometer operating at unapodized 
resolutions between 0.0035 and 0.006 cm' (defined as 0.9 
divided by the maximum optical path difference), a KCl 
beamsplitter, and a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe or InSb detec- 
tor. The 120 individual spectra were recorded with bandpasses of 
750 to 1250 cm'. 1880 to 2200 cm', or 2400 to 3200 cm'. 
Between 1 and 10 interferograms were coadded and transformed 
to derive each spectrum. Measurements between 750 and 
1240 cm-' were recorded with the HgCdTe detector and have 
a typical signal-to-RMS noise ratio of 200. Spectra in the 1880- 
to 3200-cm' region used the InSb detector, which produced 
a higher signal-to-RMS noise ratio, typically 700. The 
measurements included in our analysis were restricted to solar 
zenith angles less than 80°. A typical measurement was recorded 
in 5 minutes during which time the airmass changed by 1.5%. 
Error in the airmass was reduced to less than 1% by calculating 
an effective solar zenith angle from the average of the angles 
corresponding to the zero path difference crossing times. 

Dobson spectrophotometers [Dobson, 1957] measure total 
column ozone based on differential solar ultraviolet light absorp- 
tion in the Huggins band (300-350 nm). Precisions and 
accuracies of the technique are estimated as 0.3% and 3.0%, 
respectively [Margitan et ai, 1995]. The present results were 
derived assuming new, standard, effective ozone absorption coef- 
ficients [Komhyret al., 1993] based on laboratory measurements 
[Bass and Paur, 1985]. The new absorption coefficients yield Oj 
total columns 2.6% lower than values obtained during July 1, 
1957. to December 31. 1991, from an earlier set of ozone 
absorption coefficients (see Komhyr et al. [1993] for a 
discussion). 

Assumptions and Analysis Method 

The infrared total columns have been retrieved with the SFIT 
nonlinear least-squares spectral fitting program developed for 
analysis of ground-based infrared solar spectra recorded with 
Fourier transform spectrometers [cf.. Rinsland el al., 1984]. The 



current version of the program can derive the total columns of up 
to 5 molecules from a spectral interval by multiplicative scalings 
of initial volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles of the target 
molecules and fittings of instrument performance related 
parameters. The total column of each molecule is obtained by 
multiplying the initial vertical column amount by the scale factor. 
The spectral intervals and the molecules fitted in each are given 
in Table 1. The intervals contain ozone lines having intensities 
with minimal sensitivity to temperature errors and minimal 
blending with telluric and solar features. 

The values of 4 instrument-related parameters were obtained 
from each spectral fit: one parameter accounts for the wavenum- 
ber shift between the measured and calculated spectra, two others 
determine the level and tilt of the 100% transmission curve as a 
function of wavenumber, and the fourth determines the coeffi- 
cient of a straight-line effective apodization function [Park, 
1983]. The last parameter is important because it allows the cal- 
culated instrument function to be adjusted to agree with the shape 
indicated by the measured spectral lines. Fits yielding effective 
apodization coefficients significantly different from the nominal 
value of 1.0 were discarded to eliminate measurements recorded 
when the instrument was misaligned. We adopted a 29-layer 
atmospheric model with vertical layer thicknesses of -1 km in the 
troposphere, 2 km in the lower and middle stratosphere, and 5 to 
10 km in the 35- to lOO-km region. Recently, total columns 
retrieved with SFIT and other independently-developed 
algorithms have been compared for a prespecified set of spectra 
and adjustable parameters [Zander et al., 1994]. 

The initial Oj VMR profile is based on same day 
measurements from Lauder. From the surface to 20 km we 
assumed the profile measured by a electrochemical concentration 
cell (ECC) ozonesonde launched between 9 and lOh local time. 
Between 20 and 24 km, cubic spline interpolation was used to 
smoothly connect the balloon ozonesonde profile to the profile 
measured by a microwave radiometer operating at 1 10.8 GHz. In 
all cases, the change in O3 VMR between 20 and 24 km was 
reasonably linear, and the error introduced by the interpolation 
procedure is believed to be <l% in the total column. The 
microwave measurements were assumed between 24 and 65 km. 
At higher altitudes, where the microwave instrument lacks

sensitivity, cubic spline interpolation was used to smoothly 
connect the microwave profile to the 1976 U.S. Standard 
Atmosphere ozone profile [Krueger and Minzner, 1976]. A 
description of the EEC ozonesonde sensor and estimates of the 
accuracy and precision of the measurements are given by Koinhyr 
el at. [1995] and Barnes el al. [1985]. At present, no papers 
describing the Lauder Oj microwave measurements have been 
published. However, this same instrument was used to derive Oj 
profiles at Table Mountain, California, during the 1989 
Stratospheric Ozone Intercomparison Campaign (STOIC). The 
precisions, accuracies, and vertical resolutions of the STOIC 
microwave measurements are 4%, 7%, and 10 km at 55 mbar 
(-20 km); 5%. 8%, and 10 km at 3 mbar (-40 km); and 6%, 10%, 
and 17 km at 0.2 mbar (-60 km), respectively [Connor et ai, 
1995]. 

The vertical temperature profiles assumed in the IR analysis 
are also based on a combination of same day measurements and 
climatology. From the surface to 22 km, we adopted measure- 
ments from a meteorological radiosonde flown with the EEC 
ozonesonde. A spline interpolation procedure was used to 
smoothly connect this profile with National Meteorological 
Center temperatures and pressures, which were assumed between 
30 and 50 km. Between 50 and 65 km we adopted temperature, 
density, and pressure profiles from the MAP (Middle Atmosphere 
Program) Handbook 16 zonal average tabulations [Burnett and 
Cornev, 1985], followed by the 1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere 
values from 65 to 100 km. The radiosonde temperatures are 
estimated to have uncertainties of -1 K. 

The initial HiO VMR profile for each day is also a combina- 
tion of values from the Lauder daily sounding and climatology. 
The radiosonde measurements were combined with the 1976 U.S. 
Standard Atmosphere HjO profile by assuming the balloon data 
to an altitude of 20 km, a linear change in the HjO VMR between 
altitudes of 20 and 34 km, and the 1976 U.S. Standard 
Atmosphere H^O profile above 34 km. Initial profiles for the 
other absorbing molecules are from a variety of sources. Care has 
been taken to verify the assumed profiles are realistic for the mid- 
latitude, southern hemisphere location of the Lauder station. 

The spectroscopic line parameters used in the analysis were 
taken from the 1992 HITRAN compilation [Rothman et at.. 
1992]. The solar features noted in Table 1 were included by 
adding a line at the appropriate wavenumber and fitting the solar 
absorption with a one layer model [cf , Rinstand et ai. 1984]. 

Results and Discussion 

Figure 1 shows a sample fit. Absorption by ozone in the 
region is dominated by the 3V3 band. The maximum 
discrepancies coincide with the locations of the stronger O 3 lines. 
Sources of error are inaccuracies in the assumed O3 line 
parameters, weak lines missing from the spectroscopic database, 
and inadequacies in modeling the interfering lines and the 
instrument line shape. Similar problems occur in other spectral 
regions. 

The mean and standard deviation of ratios calculated by divid- 
ing the ozone total columns retrieved from the IR measurements 
by the same day Dobson values are given for each spectral inter- 
val in Table 1 . The standard deviations of the ratios are typically 
3%, which highlights the consistency between the two datasets 
despite wide differences in instrumentation and data analysis 
methods. Although the IR and UV measurements were recorded 
on the same day. they were in general not coincident in time. 

The results in Table 1 indicate IR/Dobson mean column ratios 
from -0.96 in the v^ band to -1.02 in the 3V3 band. At 10 |im.

the average of the 4 IR/Dobson ratios is 0.982. Hence, to obtain 
agreement with the Dobson values, the IR intensities in this 
region need to be multiplied by 0.982. This factor is higher than 
the Mauna Loa IR/Dobson ratio of 0.956 deduced by David et al. 
[1993]. However. David et al. [1993] note that reprocessing of 
the Mauna Loa Dobson data with the new, effective O3 absorp- 
tion coefficents [Komhyr et ai. 1993] would increase the ratio to 
about 0.98, in excellent agreement with the present results. 

The errors that normally arise from uncertainties in the target 
molecule volume mixing ratio and temperature profiles are neg- 
ligible in the present work because correlative measurements 
have been adopted for those quantities. However, 3 other 
important sources of potential systematic error remain: ( 1) errors 
in the spectroscopic parameters, (2) errors in fitting the 
instrument line shape function, and (3) biases introduced by 
errors in the retrieval algorithm. Errors in the line intensities are 
not considered here since the goal is to determine the offset from 
the IR/Dobson column comparisons. The sensitivity to errors in 
the air-broadening coefficients and their temperature dependences 
have been estimated by repeating retrievals with the 1992 
HITRAN air-broadening coefficients of ozone [Rothman et al., 
1992] multiplied by 1.05. The ozone total columns increased by 
0.5%. The uncertainty in the instrument line shape function was 
estimated by repeating retrievals with the straight-line effective 
apodization coefficient [Park. 1983] increased or decreased by 
0.1 as compared to the retrieved value. Changes in the ozone 
total columns of -1.5% and +1.5% were obtained, respectively. 
Total columns retrieved with SFIT agree with values from 
independently-developed algorithms to about 2% when the same 
input parameters and fitting options are selected [Zander et al., 
1994]. On the basis of these studies, we estimate the uncertainty 
in the mean IR/Dobson ratios in Table I as ±3%. 

The ozone intensity scale on the 1992 HITRAN compilation 
[Rothman et at.. 1992] was transferred from the 10 ^m to other IR 
regions by measuring relative intensities of common lines in 
overlapping laboratory spectra. The present work suggests that 
this procedure was successful to within a few percent. Very

precise work will be required to determine if the small, systematic 
increase in the IR/Dobson column ratio with wavenumber 
measured in this work results from errors in the O3 mtensities, an 
artifact in the present analysis, or a combination of both effects. 

Recent laboratory measurements are consistent with the pres- 
ent results. Birk et aL [1993] compared measured absolute 
intensities of 26 transitions in the O3 v^ band with values on the 
1992 HITRAN database [Rolhman et al.. 1992]. The average 
measured-to-1992 HITRAN ratio was 0.965 ±0.031. close to our 
average ratio of 0.967. Barbe el al. [1994] reanalyzed the 2 v,, v, 
+ v,, and 2V3 bands in the 1850-2300-cm-' region based on 0, 
amounts calculated from the measured sample pressure and the 
assumptions that the initial sample contained only O3 and the 
only O3 decay product was O2. These new intensities show no 
significant bias relative to the 1992 HITRAN compilation values 
[Barbe et al.. 1994, Fig. 3]. De Backer and Courtois [1995] used 
a tunable diode laser spectrometer to measure the intensities of 
about 40 ozone lines in the 9.6 ^lmv^ band. They derived an 
average measured-to-1992 HITRAN ratio of 0.96 ± 0.04 (M. R. 
De Backer, private communication. 1995). A consistent value for 
the amount of ozone in the cell was found three ways: (1) UV 
measurements at 253.7 nm, (2) measurements of the sample 
pressure and the assumptions that the initial sample contained 
only O3 and the only O3 decay product was O2, and (3) measure- 
ment of the O3 vapor pressure at the temperature of liquid argon, 
where the O3 vapor pressure is well known. 

Summary and Conclusions 

Average IR-to-Dobson O3 total column ratios of 0.96 to 1.02 
have been derived from 13 intervals in 5 infrared bands and 
correlative Dobson spectrophotometer measurements. Both sets 
of measurements, accurate to about ±3%, were recorded on 
10 days in 1994 at the NDSC station in Lauder, New Zealand. 
Correlative O3 and H^O VMR and temperature profiles were 
specified in the IR analysis from correlative measurements to 
minimize systematic errors. The present results do not support 
the 1.051 multiplicative factor recommended by Pickett et al. 
[1992] for the 1992 HITRAN line intensities in the O3 V3 band 
[Rothman el al., 1992]. Our results agree with recent laboratory 
measurements of absolute O3 intensities and a comparison of 
Mauna Loa IR total columns with correlative Dobson 
spectrophotometer measurements [David et al.. 1993].

The final flight of the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy experiment as part of the Atmospheric 
Laboratory for Applications and Science ATLAS-S- Space Shuttle mission in 1994 provided a new 
opportunity to measure broadband 625-4800 cm"', 2.1-16 pm infrared solar spectra at an unapodized 
resolution of 0.01 cm "^ from space. The majority of the observations were obtained as exoatmospheric, 
near Sun center, absorption spectra, which were later ratioed to grazing atmospheric measurements to 
compute the atmospheric transmission of the Earth's atmosphere and analyzed for vertical profiles of 
minor and trace gases. Relative to the SPACELAB-3 mission that produced 4800 high Sun spectra 
which were averaged into four grand average spectra;, the ATLAS-3 mission produced some 40,000 high 
Sun spectra which ha%-e been similarly averagedi with an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of a 
factor of 3-4 in the spectral region between 1000 and 4800 cm" '. A brief description of the spectral

1, Introduction 

The Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy 
lATMOSl instrument is a 0.01-cm'i unapodized reso- 
lution Fourier transform spectrometer operating in 
the infrared for atmospheric observations between 
625 and 4800 cm"' (2. 1-16 ]im] from the Space 
Shuttle. Its first flight in 1985 as part of the 
SPACELAB-3 mission provided a proof of concept for 
the instrument and measurement technique, with 
20 occultations recorded over a 2-day period. The 
excellent quality of the spectra led to a detailed 
analysis of the composition of the middle atmo- 
sphere, including the profiling of more than 30 
gaseous species. The design, performance, and op- 
eration of the ATMOS experiment have been docu- 
mented in the literature. '"^ In summary, the instru- 
ment is a rapid-scanning, double-passed, Michelson

interferometer utilizing cat's eye retroreflectors and 
a KBr beam splitter to obtain interferograms with a 
total optical path difference of 50 cm (nominally 
800,000 points , which after transformation pro- 
duces a spectrum with a dispersion of 0.007533 
cm~^ pt. 

Although designed in the mid 1970's and delivered 
in 1982 by Honev-well,-' the instrument remains state 
of the art in 1995, and it still exceeds by far the 
capabilities iin terms of resolution, speed, band- 
width, sampling, and spectral bandpass of all cur- 
rent implementations of space-based Fourier trans- 
form spectrometers. The signal-to-noise ratio of the 
measurements is maximized through the use of 
optical bandpass filters, which divide the 625 to 
4800-cm-' region into narrower regions that are 
compatible with the sampling of the laser: 625- 
1500, 1100-2000, 1580-3400, 3100-4800, and 625- 
2450 cm"i (the last filter is an addition to the set used 
in SPACELAB-3 . The signal-to-noise ratios of spec- 
tra obtained with each of the filters is inversely 
proportional to frequency, with spectra in the long- 
wavelength region having a typical signal-to-noise 
ratio of 300:1, degrading to 50:1 in the 3100^800 
cm-i spectral region. The frequency response of 
the signal-to-noise ratio is largely the consequence of 
the frequency response of the HgCdTe detector and 
the modulation efficiency of the interferometer. 

The ATMOS instrument obtains a spectrum every 
2.2 s in order to provide adequate vertical resolution

during sunrise or sunset obsen-ations: pure atmo- 
spheric spectra are obtained by ratioing the transmis- 
sion at a given tangent height against a solar 
absorption spectrum that averages all spectra ob- 
ser\'ed above a tangent height of 165 km into a single 
spectrum. Consequently, for each of the solar occul- 
tation events, a high signal-to-noise ratio exoatmo- 
spheric solar absorption spectrum is obtained. In 
addition, during each mission, certain obser\-ation 
periods were dedicated to solar-only obsen-ations in 
which 4-40 min of continuous measurements were 
made by the instrument. Measurements are ob- 
tained with a Sun tracker that balances the signals 
from four quadrants of the solar disk. Hence the 
observations were nominally obtained at Sun center, 
with a bore-sighted video camera providing visible 
wavelength images for confirmation of the position 
on the solar disk. 

The ATMOS Solar Infrared Atlas^* and related 
studies'-^ have compiled and analyzed the 1985 
obser\'ations. Farmer^ has discussed future plans 
for solar observations as part of the ATLAS missions, 
specifically noting the need for improved signal-to- 
noise ratios possible by increasing the number of 
obsen'ations, and the possibility of investigating 
the center-to-limb variation in the solar spectrum. 
The material presented in this paper addresses the 
first priority, the generation of considerably im- 
proved solar spectra. The new spectra illustrate 
the effectiveness of the dispersion corrections in the 
formation of accurate observations of the solar 
spectrum and are compared with spectra from the 
SPACEIAB-3 mission in each of the figures. 



2. Spectral Calibration 

The methodology for correction and transformation 
of ATMOS spectra has been presented elsewhere. ^""'^ 
During the SPACELAB-3 mission, solar spectra were 
obtained over a 2-day period during which the 
Sun-spacecraft velocity remained relatively constant. 
As a result, the variation in the Sun-spacecraft 
radial velocity (which produces a Doppler shift is 
typically small during indi\-idual and between succes- 
sive observations, and consequently the solar spec- 
tra can be averaged together on a point-by-point 
basis, as has been documented in previous compila- 
tions of solar spectra^ and calibrated line identifica- 
tions.^'^ The ATLAS-3 observations were made 
from a lower altitude orbit 300 km as opposed to 360 
km in 1985) and over a 10-day period; consequently, 
the variation in the Sun-spacecraft velocity was 
sufficient to prevent point-by-point averaging of high 
Sun spectra from different observations into grand 
solar average spectra. Instead, all solar spectra 
above a tangent height of 165 km were interpolated 
to a stationary reference frame through the calcula- 
tion of the Doppler shift, and residual frequency 
shifts were assessed before averaging. 

The canonical dispersion of a Fourier transform 
spectrometer is Act = ui, 2N, where a^,/ 2 is the laser 
semifrequency and N is the number of points in the 



fast Fourier transform: in the case of the .A.TMOS 
interferometer, ai 2 = 7S99.0015 cm '. yielding a 
dispersion of 0.007533 cm ' pt. for a million-point 
transform. In contrast, to calibrate on-orbit spectra 
properly for all of the perturbations relative to a 
laboratory spectrometer, the laser semi-frequency 
must be corrected for the field of view and the 
Doppler shift: 



Gs = 0-i.Ws'l + I's cmI - O 41-. 



ill 



where ws is an empirical stretch factor used for final 
calibration relative to laboratory standards, Vs is the 
spacecraft-Sun velocity, c is the velocity of light, and 
n is the field of view (FOV! of the instrument. The 
FOV is small compared with the solar disk approxi- 
mately 32 mrad as viewed by the instrument:; typi- 
cally the FOV is 0.97 mrad, except for the long- 
wavelength filter (filter 12, 625-1500 cm"' , in which 
a FOV of 2.01 mrad is used to increase the signal-to- 
noise ratio. These FOVs are smaller than those 
used during the SPACELAB-3 mission 1.2 and 4 
mrad, respectively) and significantly improve the 
linearity of the measurements. In the presence of 
residual air within the instrument, the spectral 
point spacing will be nonuniform and consequently 
the dispersion will be a function of the frequency 



Ad = Gg 2.Vr,. 



12) 



where r, is the refractive index of air obtained with 
Edlen's formula'" and depends on the pressure, 
temperature, and humidity within the instrument 
typically this is only relevant during ground calibra- 
tion and outgassing immediately following launch). 

The mean dispersion over a spectral interval be- 
tween frequencies ui and CT2 is 



Aa = {a2 — CTj) !ct2 A(J2 - (Ti ActjI /, 



'3) 



where / is the interpolation factor typically 3 for 
atmospheric sounding, 1 for solar spectroscopy). 
The calibration factor, ws, allows for the adjustment 
of the dispersion to match accurately measured line 
positions, but in practice this complicates the com- 
parison of spectra obtained over the past decade as 
standards are continually refined. Instead, the 
SPACELAB-3 correction of 0.999998526 has been 
assumed for the ATLAS spectra; however, before 
spectra are averaged, any residual frequency shifts 
are measured and removed relative to an assumed 
stationary spectrum to ensure that the line positions 
and shapes are minimally distorted by the averaging 
process. Given a correct dispersion, each spectrum 
is interpolated to a reference frame with a dispersion 
of 0.007533067 cm"' (no interpolation) before averag- 
ing.

tra for (a) molecular transitions and (bi atomic transi- 
tions. A notable difference between the 1985 flight 
and the ATLAS flights was improved purging and 
reduced outgassing of the instrument, leading to 
significantly reduced instrumental water vapor lines 
as illustrated in Fig. 1. The upper panel contains 
two traces (one scaled by ten in the ordinate to 
accentuate small features) with four sharp, promi- 
nent instrument lines; in the lower panel, the same 
lines are greatly reduced in magnitude. The 
ATLAS-3 spectra are sufficiently free of instrumen- 
tal lines to permit the averaging of all sunrise and 
sunset data into a single grand average spectrum. 
Approximately 10,000 spectra were combined into 
this average. Figure 1 illustrates several other 
points: the method of spectral calibration is quite 
adequate, and although the spectra were accumu- 
lated over a 10-day period, it is possible to formulate 
an average (as indicated above) that does not signifi- 
cantly alter the solar line shapes; in addition, the 



lower trace indicates the improvement in signal-to- 
noise ratio during the ATLAS-3 mission. 

In Fig. 1 care has been taken to ensure that the 
frequency scale, for the SPACELAB-3 spectra, closely 
matches the calibrations developed by Geller^'^^; 
any residual frequency difference between the 
SPACELAB-3 and ATLAS-3 spectra results from 
differences in the definitions of the reference frame 
and should be removable with further calibration. 
The identification of solar features such as the two 
strong features in the lower panel as Fe transitions 
is a continuous process. '^ The improvement in sig- 
nal-to-noise ratio should permit the identification of 
new solar features: Fig. 1 illustrates_ a spectral 
region containing two weak NH features ^^ and instru- 
ment lines (marked with the letter I. Figure 1 
suggests that many features that are marginally 
present in the 1985 spectra can be clearly measured

that the averaging process has not significantly distorted the line shapes. Several marginally resolved : 198o NH features are clearly

identified by Geller at 3459.92 cm '. there is a 
comparable " feature at 3461.0 cm ' in the 1994 
spe'ctra that is lost in the noise in the 1985 spectra. 
Conversely, the 1985 compilation placed a line at 
3461.783 cm-i that is absent from the 1994 spectra, 
whereas there is a weak feature at 3461.95 cm"^ in 
the 1994 spectra that is essentially absent from the 
1985 spectra although there is a feature that is twice 
the noise level. The carbon double line identified at 
3469.213 and 3469.236 cm'^ in the 1985 spectra 
appears as a single line in the 1994 spectra, and 
realistically the doublet structure in the 1985 spec- 
tra is comparable with the noise in the spectrum. 

The improvement in signal-to-noise ratio should 
allow the identification of weak molecular and atomic 
features and the determination of more accurate 
molecular constants. Figure 2 illustrates a spectral 
region containing four CH spectral features.^^ As 
in Fig. 1, the recent identification of some unidenti- 
fied lines (e.g., Fe, in the lower trace of Fig. 2) 
indicates the evolution of solar spectroscopy, and the 
lower trace contains a number of features that are 
statistically significant and warrant investigation 
e.g., the weak features between 3030 and 3031.5 



cm '. Positive identification offeatures as real will 
require multiple measurements and corroboration 
from atomic and molecular calculations, especially 
in cases in which the signal-to-noise ratio is less 
than 3. 

4. Conclusions 

Exoatmospheric infrared solar spectra recorded by 
the ATMOS instrument on board the Space Shuttle 
are presented and contrasted with earlier measure- 
ments made in 1985. The improvement in signal-to- 
noise ratio mainly resulting from the larger number 
of spectra' is discussed and illustrated, and the 
method of calibration is presented. Four new spec- 
tra, global high Sun averages from the November 
1994 ATLAS-3 mission, are available in electronic 
form and may be obtained from the anonjTnous File

Abstract— New line parameters for two heavy odd nitrogen molecules HNOj in the V5/2V, 
region, and ClONO, in the v^ region are incorporated in the analysis of high resolution i.r. 
atmospheric spectra.' The line parameters arc tested and rcnormalized vs laboratory spectra, 
and then applied to retrievals from balloon-borne and ground-based solar absorption spectra. 



INTRODUCTION 

High resolution (0.002-O.003 cm"') Michelson type interferometer systems are used at the 
University of Denver to obtain i.r. solar absorption spectra of the stratosphere during ballooji 
flights, as well as ground-based solar spectra. The stratospheric spectra in the region 700-2200 cm 
cover spectral signatures of O3 (including isotopic species), NO,, HNOj, Oj, Nj, COFj, ClONOj, 
SF«, and others. For a typical study of new spectral features observable in such spectra see the 
discussion of the 6 June 1988 flight data by Goldman et al.' Ground-based spectra in the 3-12 pm 
region are obtained regularly from Mauna Loa (Hawaii) and Denver (CO), in support of the 
Network for Detection of Stratospheric Change (NDSQ and the Upper Atmosphenc Research 

satellite (UARS). u • ^ 

In support of the atmospheric observations, numerous laboratory spectra have been obtained 
with the same interferometer systems. The laboratory spectra cover mostly the region 
70O-3000cm-' and have also been extended down to 500 or up to SOOOcm"'. The molecules 
covered include CCl,. CCljFj. CCI,F. CF„ CHCIF:, CHjCi. CHCI3. CH,0. QH„ ClONO, 
COF„ COClj, COCIF, HCOOH, HNO.. HjOj, NOj, HNO3. NjO„ and others. Analysis of 
stratospheric spectral features, combined with analysis of laboratory molecular absorption spectra, 
improves the spectral line parameters and leads to more complete line identifications and more 
accurate retrieval quantification of atmospheric gases. 

In the present paper, updates of line parameters and their application to the University of Denver 
spectra will be presented for the 11 /^ region of HNO3 and the 780 cm"' region of ClONO,. 



RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Recent updates of line parameters for the HNO, V5/2V, bands, beyond the HITRAN 92 data 
base,- have allowed improved quantitative analysis of atmospheric spectra in the 1 1 p. region. The 
first update was initiated by A. G. Maki (unpublished) and included Fermi resonance effects on 
the energy levels but unperturbed intensities. This provided improved modeling of the v, manifolds 
in the 860-875 cm"' region of the atmospheric spectra, as reported by Goldman et al.'-' This set 
has been used successfully for most retrievals to date from high resolution airborne and 
sround-based solar spectra. Subsequent update was based on Maki and Wells,^ who extended the 
analysis with Fermi resonance, by adding unperturbed intensities to the published energies and line 
positions. This update covered both bands, with improved agreement in the v, manifolds and 



A. Goldman et al 



Q-branch, but the 2v, Q-branch was still poorly modeled. The more recent update, based on the 
irk of Perrin et al/'extended the treatment ^th both Fenni and Coriohs ^^"^^^^f^^^^^^^^^^ 
perturbed intensities. With this update the modeling of both the v, and the 2v, 2 -branches .s 
significantly improved, and the g-branches are now consistent v^ilh most P and R mamfolds. Line 
intensity plots for the two latest updates were shown m Fig. 1. • , • 

In order to apply these data to atmospheric spectra in a fashion consistent with previous 
retdevds from th'es/bands and from the other major m^'O, bands the total ^-^ mj---^-- 
norrnalized to the measured intensities of Giver et al.= divided by a hot bands factor of ^30 -fHcb 
amounts to multiplying the Perrin et al lines' (sho^v■n m Fig. 1) by 1.43. The hot bai^ds are not 
analyzed yet, but are not significant in the spectral intervals used for stratospheric retnevals, they 
are thus not considered in the line list for this study. .u tt ■„.,.;»„ 

Figure 2 shows a typical fitting in the v, manifolds with the latest Unes to data from the Umve'-s.ty 
of Denver balloon flisht of 6 June 1988. The improvements in the Q-branches modeling is 
demonstrated in Fig. 3. also with data from the 6 June 1988 flight. Compansons with g^o^nd^b^^^ 
spectra to be presented elsewhere, also show significant improvements in the spectral fitting^ 
Comparisons with retrievals with the previous two line parameters updates show consistency of 
better than 4% over the 860-870 cm"' manifolds. 

The first update of the initial cross-sections for ClONO, (HITRAN 1986 -- pro-ded by th 
work of Ballard et al,' which generated cross-sections in the 700-1800 cm at 213-296 k. These 
cross-sections were included in the HITRAN 92 data base.' , 

Recent analysis of the v,CIONO, region (the most useful for atmosphenc "inevals) by Bdl et al 
provided spectroscopic constants for the three main bands in this region, v. ClONO: v, 
"ClONO. and v. -f v, - v, "CIONO:. Based on this analysis, line parameters were genera ed in 
theTre^^n, with the relative intensities of the three bands normalized to 0.002 c-" .«so ufon 
laborato^ spectra taken at the University of Denver, and absolute intensities normahzed to the 
values of Ballard et al,« with the continuum removed (providing consistency of better than 3 /. w^t_h 
previous retrievals). The new line parameters were then applied to retnevals m the 780.2 cm 
«gion from D.U. ialloon-borne and ground-based spectra taken ^^ 0-002^.006 cm 'resolmion^ 
The new line parameters showed improved agreement with observed data, even though the fine 
structure is not fully modeled yet. Intensity plots of the normalized line parameters are shown m 
Fig. 4. Modeling of the 780.2 cm"' region from University of Denver laboratory data is shown m

"'?hV newTne parameters of HNO, and ClONO, were thus applied in retrievals of altitude mixing 
ratio profiles from sunset spectra obtained during two D.U. balloon flights made on 6 June 1988 
(from Palestine, Texas, with float altitude of 36.7 km) and 24 July 1992 (Palestine, Texas, floa^ 
lltitude of 34 km). Sunset scans were obtained during the 6 June 1988 flight f-^^^ '5,6<)kxn 
tangent altitude, but only down to 24.30 km tangent altitude dunng the 24 July 1992 flight, the 
Pin'atubo alrosol caused Ls of the source signal below this altitude. Both flights covered the same 
spectral interval of 700-1350 cm"' mih resolution of -0.0025 cm "'. The resolution and the ignal 
?o noise ratio were slightly better during the 6 June 1988 flight. Spectral fitting resuUs were tested 
by two non-linear spectral least squares programs, one based on the work of Niple et al, and one 
on Rinsland et al,'° combined with the onion-peeling method for the mixing ratio profile. The 
agreement between the two methods is better than 2% in any step of the on.on-peelmg, assuming 
the same atmospheric and spectroscopic parameters. „„,.;„„. 

The retrieved mi.xing ratios arc shown in Figs. 7, 8, which also include compansotis with pre%^ous 
resuUs-HN03 from D.U.,>' ATMOS,'^ LIMS,"^ WMO (1986),'^ and BLISS.-and ClONO ^om 
ATMOS " The results from the two flights are included in the compansons of CLAbb-UAKb 
retrievals and other correlative measurements and 2-D global model calculations, as reported b> 
Mer.enthaler et al.'' These comparisons show that both HNO, and ClONO. P-«« jf'^'' 
significant variabiHties, not fully modeled yet, even for mid latitudes, n particular, hifts m the 
altitudes of the peak of the ClONO, profiles such as seen in Fig. 8. also appear in ^h= CLAEb 
results." The improved line parameters will provide a more accurate and consistent quantification 
of these species from i.r. atmospheric spectra.

Abstract . A number of prominent Q-branches of the 
u, band of CjHg have been identified near 3000 cm"' in 
aircraft and" ground-based infrared solar absorption 
spectra. The aircraft spectra provide the column 
amount above 12 km at various altitudes. The column 
amount is strongly correlated with tropopause height 
and can be described by a constant mixing ratio of 
0.45 ppbv in the upper troposphere and a mixing ratio 
scale height of 3.9 km above the tropopause. The 
ground-based spectra yield a column of 9.0 x lO' 
molecules cm"" above 2.1 km; combining these results 
implies a tropospheric mixing ratio of approximately 
0.63 ppbv. 

Introduction 

After methane, the most abundant hydrocarbon in 
the atmosphere is ethane. Its importance for atmos- 
pheric chemistry lies principally in its reactions with 
OH and CI; it is potentially also a source for atmos- 
pheric CO [Chameides and Cicerone, 1978J. In the tro- 
posphere, the loss of C,Hg is largely by reaction with 
OH; the lifetime is highly variable, but typical values 
are approximately 100 days in the lower stratosphere 
[Rudolph et al., 1981). In the stratosphere both OH 
and CI react with C^Hj and the vertical profile of 
ethane has been used to infer the concentration of 
chlorine radicals in the lower stratosphere [Rudolph 
et al.. 1981; Aikin et al., 1082; Singh and Salas, 1982|. 
Measurements of the concentration of ethane near the

tropopause are thus important indicators of radical 
chemistry. 

Recently, infrared measurements of C^Hg in the 
upper troposphere and lower stratosphere were reported 
based on the analysis of spectra in the C,Hg f, band at 
822 cm"' [Goldman et al., 1984). The same study sug- 
gested the identification of the Q-branches of the i^^ 
C,H5 band near 3000 cm"'. These absorption features 
are an order of magnitude stronger than the v^ band 
Q-branches and thus are important for the remote sens- 
ing of CJig as well as of other trace constituents with 
spectral features in the same region. In this letter, we 
present atmospheric spectra with the identification and 
quantification of the C^Hg i^^ Q-branches. We also 
present the latitudinal dependence of the C^Hg column 
amount above 12 km as derived from spectra recorded 
aboard the NCAR Sabreliner aircraft, and a tropos- 
pheric amount derived from ground-based spectra 
recorded at Kitt Peak. 

Analysis 

Figure 1 shows atmospheric, calculated, and labora- 
tory spectra in the 2975-2990 cm"' region. The aircraft 
spectrum was recorded in July 1978 at 24 degrees 
North latitude and an average solar elevation of 2.75 
degrees. The three spectra in Figure 1 are all at 
0.06 cm"' resolution. The laboratory spectrum is taken 
from the laboratory atlas of Murcray and Goldman 
[198l|. The same atlas also shows a spectrum of the ^'g 
band of C^Hg in the 800 cm"' region recorded under 
the same conditions, so that the relative intensities of 
the Q-branches in the two regions are quite apparent. 
The line-by-line calculation in Figure lb includes lines 
of CH^. H^O, O3 and HCl [Rothman et al., 1983a,b], of 
which CH". and H.,0 are the major contributors. The

[Murcray and Goldman, 1981). 



features marked by arrows in the aircraft spectrum 
agree with the C^Hg Q-branches in position and relative 
intensity and are not accounted for in the calculations. 
The feature al 2982 cm"' in the observation is due to 
Si I in the sun's atmosphere. These identifications 
were further confirmed by comparison of line-by-line 
simulations with 0.01 cm"' resolution ground-based 
spectra obtained al Kilt Peak and additional labora- 
tory spectra. Samples of these spectra are shown in 
Figure 2 for the interval of 2976-2977 cm"'. It should 
also be noted that our simulations and comparisons 
with laboratory data showed that several CH^ line 
intensities in the 2990-3000 cm"' region in the AFGL 
tape are in large error. These values are being 
corrected for the next edition. 

From studies of spectra such as shown in Figures 1 
and 2 we have concluded that several prominent 
features, as marked with arrows on the figures, are 
dominated bv the C^H. Q-branches. The ^Q, feature 



Previous search for these features in balloon-borne 
spectra showed no measurable absorptions [Kendall and 
Buijs, 1983] for tangent heights down to 19 km. 
Unlike the u^ C,H. Q-branches, line parameters [Roth- 
man et al., 1983b] are not available for the u^ Q- 
branches, which are not resolved even at very high 
resolution. Recent studies of laboratory spectra by 
Pine and Lafferty [1982] and by Dang-Nhu et al. [198-41 
provide accurate energy levels for the three overlapping 
vibration-rotation bands in the 3 pm region (i/,, u^ and 
i/g + J/jj bands) and also approximate intensities for 
many of the weaker, resolved lines but exclude the Q- 
branches of atmospheric interest.

LATITUDE (Nocth) 

Fig. 3 Latitudinal dependence of the C^Hg column 
amount above 12 km altitude as derived from the 
aircraft data. Column amounts are averaged from 
spectra taken over 5 degrees of latitude and 
represent typically an average of from 8 to 10 indivi- 
dual spectra, some recorded in summer and others in 
winter. Also shown is the height of the tropopause. 
The solid circles are the average of winter and sum- 
mer tropopause heights from the nearest radiosonde 
observations to the aircraft location. 

The C^H, quantification is therefore based on the 
equivalent width method with the ''Q3 and ^Q^ intensi- 
ties measured from laboratory spectra. The C^Hg Q- 
branches quantified here "are very dense with spectral 
lines and not broadened significantly by the instrumen- 
tal spectral resolution. Thus, a small absorption by 
these Q-branches corresponds to the weak line approxi- 
mation, where the integrated absorption is proportional 
to the product of gas amount and the integrated inten- 
sity. .Assuming linear absorption in the laboratory 
spectrum of Figure 1 gives an integrated intensity of 
S = 3.23 ± 0.81 X 10"" cm"'/'"°'^*^"'^^ ^^'' (^'' 
296 K) for ^Q^. Laboratory measurements at NASA 
Langley, such as in Figure 2c, resulted in an integrated 
intensity for ^Q, of S = 3.91 ± 0.64 x lO"'^ 
cm"Vmolcules cm"" at 296 K. These values have been 
used in the present analysis. 

Aircraft spectra taken over a number of years and a 
wide range of latitudes show CjHg absorption above the 
flight level of 12 km. The C^Hg column amount is 
observed to have a maximum at low latitudes and 
decreases toward the pole. The variation with latitude 
is strongly correlated with the tropopause altitude as 
shown in Figure 3. 

Discussion 

The obvious correlation between column amount and 
tropopause height leads us to attempt to deduce the 
variation of density of C^Hg in the vicinity of the tro- 
popause by fitting the da"la to the values derived from 
a simple parametric model profile. We used a model 
with a constant mixing ratio below the tropopause and 
an exponential decrease of mixing ratio above the tro- 



popause. The two parameters which were fitted are the 
tropopause mixing ratio and the mixing ratio scale 
height. The parameters were determined by a least 
squares fit of the observed columns to the values calcu- 
lated from the model profile- The resulting best fit was 
for a mixing ratio at the tropopause of 0.46 ppbv and a 
scale height of the mixing ratio in the lower strato- 
sphere of 3.9 km. This analysis neglects several impor- 
tant variables, particularly the latitude, but the tropo- 
pause height is the most significant variable, and the 
liniited data set does not justify fitting more parame- 
ters. The rms difference between the observed and cal- 
culated columns is 0.25 x lO'^ molecules cm"-. 

The ground-based measurement in Figure 2 yields a 
C,Hg column of 9.0 x lO'^ molecules cm"- above the 
observation altitude of 2.1 km. The aircraft measure- 
ment at that latitude indicated 1.1 x lO'^ molecules 
cm"- above 12 km. Although the aircraft measure- 
ments were made at a different season, if we assume 
that they are representative of the time of the ground- 
based observation, the column between 2.1 and 12 km 
is 7.9 X 10'^ molecules cm"', corresponding to a mean 
mixing ratio of 0.63 ppbv. The ground-based and air- 
craft results are consistent with previous C^Hg sampling 
measurements [Randolph el al, 1981; Aikin el al., 
19S2: Singh and Salas, 19821.

The odd nitrogen family of moleciiles (primarily NO, NOj, HNO3, CIONO2, 
HO2NO2, and NjOj) is one of three key chemically-coupled families important in 
the catalytic destruction of ozone in the stratosphere (Crutzen, 1970) (the others 
are the odd hydrogen and odd chlorine families). Nitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) is a 
diumally-varying reservoir of the odd nitrogen family, and the present work reports 
the accurate measurement of the profile of this moleciile at simrise. 

Only a few measurements of NjOj have been reported previously. Roscoe 
(1982) and Evans (1986) reported tentative observations, based on low-resolution 
simrise measurements, which were followed by 0.015 cm"' resolution solar occul- 
tation measurements of the 743, 1246 cm"', and 1720 cm"' bands by the ATMOS 
Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) on Spacelab 3 (Toon et al., 1986; Toon,

1987; Rinsland et al, 1989), nighttime emission measurements of the 1246 cm"' 
band with a balloon-borne FTS (Kunde et al, 1988), and morning emission meas- 
urements of the same band with a balloon-borne FTS (Blatherwick et al, 1989). 

The present work reports additional measurements of the 1246 cm"' NjOj 
band obtained at sunrise with a high-resolution balloon-borne FTS operating in the 
solar occultation mode. The 1246 cm"' band is overlapped by absorption from a 
number of other atmospheric gases, principally CH4 and NjO, and to a lesser 
extent molecules such as COj, H^O, and COFj. To obtain accurate corrections for 
CH4 and N2O interferences, the profiles of both constituents have also been re- 
trieved from the spectra, and those results are also reported. 

2. Measurements, Data Analysis, and Results 

Table I summarizes the most important parameters of the LPMA (Limb Profile 
Monitor of the Atmosphere) instrument and the balloon flight data of 12 October 
1990, which are analyzed here. Instrumental details have been discussed by Camy- 
Peyre't et al (1991); note that a revised set of flight parameters are reported here. 
Briefly, the LPMA instrument is a rapid-scanning Bomem, Inc. model DA2.01 
FTS, which used a HgTdCd detector and a KCl beamsplitter to cover the 800 to 
1400 cm"' region during this balloon flight. The spectral signal-to-rms noise of a 
single scan exceeded 100 in the region of the 1246 cm"' N2O5 band. About 40 
good spectra were recorded between solar elevation angles of -5.42* and 2.47* 
firom the float altitude of 40.1 km. This altitude was derived firom measurements by 
an onboard pressure transducer which were converted to altitude from a correla- 
tive pressure-temperature profile (discussed below). The effective instrument reso- 
lution was about 0.052 cm"' FWHM (full width half maximum absorption). The 
field of view (FOV) of the instiimient (see Table I) as determined by an iris of 0.6 
mm at the detector and by tiie focal lengtii of tiie output collimator (100 mm) is 
6 X 10"^ rd, i.e. about 2/3 of tiie angular diameter of the sun. This FOV translates 
into a vertical span at tiie limb of about 2.3 km at a tangent height of 30 km. The

vertical resolution is also limited by the time between consecutive zero path differ- 
ence crossings (in our case 2 x 50s), which corresponds to a vertical sampling of 
about 2.5 km at the altitude range of interest. 

A pressure-temperature profile calculated by the National Meteorological 
Center (M. Gehnan, private communication, 1991) for the time and location of the 
balloon flight has been adopted for the analysis. Refracted ray paths for each 
spectrum were calculated using the FSCATM program (Gallery et ai, 1983) and 
the geometric parameters of the experiment. The time of recording the zero path 
difference signal was used in computing the solar zenith angles (Park, 1982; Kyle 
and Blatherwick, 1984). 

A nonlinear least-squares spectral fitting procedure (e.g., Rinsland et ai, 1982) 
was used to retrieve the CH4 and NjO profiles. The effective instrument line shape 
was first determined by least-squares fitting isolated CH4 lines in a high signal-to- 
noise spectrum produced by averaging all of the spectra with zenith angles less than 
90°. The retrieved instrument function was held fixed during the subsequent re- 
trievals. Independent onion-peeling retrievals were run using each of the spectral 
intervals listed in Table II. A sample fit is shown in Figure 1. The final profiles have 
been obtained by averaging the results from the different intervals. Line parameters 
from the 1991 HITRAN compilation (L. S. Rothman, unpublished results, 1991) 
were assumed in the analysis. 

Figures 2 and 3 show comparisons of the retrieved profiles with in-situ measure- 
ments obtained at the same latitude between 1982 and 1985 (Schmidt etai, 1986) 
and 2-D photochemical model profiles (M. K. W. Ko, private communication, 
1991). Error bars represent the total 1-ct uncertainty of the present measurements, 
about 10% for both gases. The error limits were evaluated from sensitivity studies 
of the effects of uncertainties in each of the assumed parameters. In tiiese studies, 
retrievals are repeated with each parameter varied by the amount of its estimated 
uncertainty while all others remain fixed at the assumed values. The total errors are 
then calculated from the RSS (square root of the sum of the squares) of tiie indi-

zero level can be checked on the edges of the bandpass and at the bottoms of 
saturated absorption features (H2O and O3 lines). Channel spectra, resulting from 
the combined effects of using a filter for isolating the spectral region of interest and 
a germanium window for rejecting the visible-UV part of the solar spectrum, are 
observable but rather weak. On a relative basis, the agreement between the infrared 
and in-situ measiurements is very good. The mean and the standard deviation of the 
ratio of the IR volume mixing ratios to the in-situ data are 1.13 ± 0.18 for CH4 and 
1.34 ±0.47 for NjO. The larger standard deviation for NjO reflects the larger 
scatter in the in-situ measurements. About half of the offset between the CH4 data- 
sets can be attributed to the long-term increase in CH4 between the time of the in- 
situ measurements (1983-1985) and our flight experiment (1990). The rate of 
CH4 increase at the surface is about 1% per year (e.g., Khalil and Rasmussen, 

1990). 

Analysis of the spectra to retrieve the N2O5 profile has followed the procedures 
described previously (Rinsland et al., 1989). In this method, microwindows spaced 
about 1 cm"' apart between 1210 and 1270 cm"', as given in Table 2 of Rinsland et 
al. (1989), were used to measure the integrated absorption by the N2O5 band. The

Even at the lowest level for which we have retrieved the NjO mixing ratio, the agreement between our 
determinations and the in-situ measurements is compatible with the error bars of each technique. 



measurements were made on ratio spectra computed by dividing the individual low 
sun spectra by an average high sun spectrum obtained by coadding all spectra with 
zenith angles less than 90". Corrections for residual atmospheric absorption in the 
microwindows were derived from simulations calculated with the retrieved CH4 
and N2O profiles. Reference volume mixing ratio profiles (e.g., the compilation of 
Smith (1982)) were assumed for calculating the absorption by other gases in this 
region. All of tiie species on the 1991 HTTRAN compilation (L. S. Rotiiman, un- 
published results, 1991) were included in the calculations. 

Figure 4 shows a sequence of microwindow measurements from several of the 
spectra. The growth of the NjOj band absorption with decreasing tangent height is 
readily apparent. Dashed Unes show the fitted 100% transmittance level for two of 
the spectra. Equivalent widths of the NjOj band have been obtained by integrating 
the absorption between 1226 and 1265 cm"'. The results from spectra witii the 
same zero path difference crossing times agree within the uncertainties and have 
been averaged. These times correspond to the short period at zero path difference 
for reverse and forward scans (one sided interferograms) recorded by the present 
instrument.

The profile of N2O5 has been derived from the measured equivalent widths 
using the onion-peeling retrieval method and an assumed temperature-indepen- 
dent band intensity of 4.32 x 10"'^ cm'Vmolecule cm"^. This value is the same as 
adopted previously (Toon et ai, 1986; Rinsland et al., 1989). Recently, Roscoe 
(1991) reviewed the pubUshed laboratory and atmospheric measurements of N2O5 
and recommended an integrated 1246 cm"' NjOj band intensity of 4.01 x 10"'^ 
cm~'/molecule cm"^. K this lower value is assiuned, the published ATMOS meas- 
urements and those reported in this study need to be multiplied by a factor of 
1.077. 

Figure 5 presents a comparison of our retrieved NjOj profile with previous 
published measurements and two photochemical model calculations performed for 
conditions corresponding to the ATMOS/Spacelab 3 sunrise measurements at 
47' S on 1 May 1985. Error bars on the LPMA profile increase with altitude, rang- 
ing from 22 to 30%. The uncertainty is dominated by the absolute uncertainty of

cate the 1-sigma uncertainties of the measurements. Models 1 and 2 denote the model calculations of 
M. Natarajan (private communication, 1989) and Allen and Delitsky (1990, Fig. 3), respectively. The 
latter study reported profiles derived witii three different values assumed for the NjOj absorption 
cross sections; the curve plotted in this figure (model 2) corresponds to the profile computed with the 
NjOj cross sections recommended by DeMore etal. (1987).

the equivalent width measurements are also important at the higher tangent alti- 
tudes (>35 km), where the NjOj absorption is very weak. Below about 31 km, the 
LPMA profile is in good agreement with the other data. At higher altitudes, the 
ATMOS volume mixing ratios and photochemical model profiles are lower than 
the present results, although there is agreement within the measurement errors. A 
sunrise N2O5 volume mixing ratio at 30 km has been calculated by Webster et al. 
(1990) from their simultaneous in-situ measurements of NO, NO2, HNO3, O3, 
N2O, pressure, and temperature on 13 September 1988, at 32" N latitude. Our

DETERMINATION OF TOTAL OZONE OVER MALNA LOA USING 
VERY HIGH RESOLUTION INFRARED SOLAR SPECTRA 

Shelle J. David. Sheryl A. Beaton. Mary H. Anclerbeig and Frank J. Murcray 

Department of Physics, University of Denver 



Ahslmci. A veiy high resolution infrared Fourier transform 
spectrometer has been used to record solar spectra at the 
Mauna Loa Obsei-vatoiy in Hawaii. Spectra are normally 
taken one day a week at sunrise. These spectra have been 
analyzed for ozone and N,0 total columns, and the ozone 
column compared with the value reported by the Mauna 
Loa Dobson spectrophotometer. Aside from the FTIR 
reporting about 57( lower values than the Dobson (which 
may be due to a systematic difference in the treatment of 
tropospheric ozone), the FTIR and Dobson agree to 
within 1.17/ (RMS) during this period. 

Introduction 

Ozone has long been recognized as one of the most 
important atmospheric trace gases. I-arly interest in the 
compound was due to its role in atmospheric radiation 
exchange. As a result, measurement of ozone column 
abundances and profiles were generally supported by 
various national meteorological offices. Long-term ozone 
records are somewhat sporadic because of the variation of 
national funding. 

Stratospheric ozone absorbs much of the solar UV-B 
radiation before it reaches the earth's surface, thus 
reducing the likelihood of skin cancer in humans. The 
possibility that changes in ozone could have serious health 
effects was first raised as a serious issue in conjunction 
with the environmental effects of the SST (supersonic 
transport). Since that time, research on the ozone layer 
has concentrated on determining the extent to which 
man's activities can result in the depletion of the strato- 
spheric ozone layer. 

Ozone also has several strong absorption bands in the 
middle infrared, some of which occur in regions that 
would othenvise be nearly transparent ("atmospheric 
windows"). Thus, in addition to heating the stratosphere 
by absorbing solar UV, ozone plays a significant role in 
the atmospheric greenhouse effect. 

While the initial measurement of atmospheric ozone by 
observing the absorption of solar radiation in the ultravio- 
let was p'erformed by Fabry and Buisson [ 1913. 1921 ]. the

was recognized by the meteorological communitv' and 
instruments of the Dobson design were installed at 
meteorological obsenatories around the world. Upgraded 
versions oi these instruments are still in use at many 
locations. The Dobson instrument and processing algo- 
rithm have been the subject of many studies to determine 
the absolute accuracy of the measured column. With 
properly maintained and operated instruments, relative 
accuracy of V'A or better can be achieved [Grass et al., 
1992]. the absolute accuracy is more difficult to estimate. 
The standard coefficients used differ by V/i from more 
recent values, while other known error sources are about 
Vy< |WMO. 1988|. 

Ozone has strong absorption around 9.6 /um due to the 
r, and i', vibration rotation bands. These bands occur in 
the 8-12 pm atmospheric window. The bands are very 
complex, consisting of thousands of individual absorption 
lines. ,\s recently as 1986. the molecular parameters 
required to accurately calculate the ozone absorptions 
were known to be incorrect. A new analysis of the 
available experimental data by Flaud et al. 11992) has 
greatly improved parameters for these bands. Also, 
instrumentation has been developed within the last decade 
that can measure isolated single absorption lines and their 
shapes. For the first time, accurate ozone amounts can be 
determined from obsei^/ations of the absorption of solar 
radiation in the infrared. 

The Network for Detection of Stratospheric Change 
(NDSC) (see Kurylo. 1991) is establishing an obseiving 
station at Mauna Loa Obseivatory (MLO). Hawaii. As 
part of a preliminary study, we have been recording 
infrared .solar absorption spectra in the 8-14 ^m region 
once a week since November. 1991. Fhe instrument being 
used is a very high resolution Fourier transform interfer- 
ometer system (FTIR). MLO has an automated Dobson 
instrument which has been measuring total column ozone 
amounts for manv years. In this study we do a prelimi- 
naiy comparison of the results obtained with the FTIR 
and the Dobson techniques. 

Instrumentation 

The solar spectrometer used in this study is a slightly 
modified commercial FTIR system built by BOMEM. Inc. 
of Quebec. Canada. It has a 2.50 m maximum path 
difference. For most of the data used in this study, 
spectra were obtained at 5 millikayser resolution (200 m 
path difference with apodization). The interferometer is 
controlled by a personal computer and the data is record- 
ed on the hard disk. At the end of a run the data are 
transferred to digital audio tapes (DAT). One DAT 
remains at MLO for backup, and a copy is mailed to 
Denver about once a month.

The interferometer is housed in a small dome. Solar 
radiation is directed through the wall into the interferome- 
ter entrance by an automatic biaxial solar tracker. 
Currently, the system must be started by an operator. 
Since manv of the chemical constituents of interest to the 
NDSC occur in trace amounts, long atmospheric paths are 
desired. MLO staff record spectra shortly after sunrise 
once each week, weather permitting. Normally, the 
observations are made on Wednesday. Occasionally, data 
are taken more frequently by University of Denver 
personnel while servicing the instrument or for satellite 
intercomparisons. 

Analysis 

A non-linear least squares spectral fitting algorithm 
(SFIT) has been adapted for use on IBM compatible 
personal computers by C. P. Rinsland (NASA l.angley. 
private communication). The program performs a line-by- 
line layer-by-layer calculation using the HITRAN molecu- 
lar data base JRothman. 1992|, or other parameters as 
desired. The program adjusts the amount of ozone by 
multiplying a starting ozone profile by a scaling factor. 
When the best fit is achieved, the total amount of ozone 
(and any other chemical compounds with absorptions in 
the spectral interval) is calculated. The program also 
adjusts several instrument parameters including the 1007r 
transmission level and frequency shift. F'igure 1 shows an

example of a solar spectrum, along with the calculated 
best fit spectrum. The ozone lines chosen were isolated 
and onlv weakly temperature dependent. This region 
includes two prominent ozone absorptions, several weaker 
ozone lines, and a strong line due to N,0. Input for the 
calculations includes the atmospheric temperature and 
water \apor profile from the Hilo. Hawaii radiosonde 
launch on the morning of the obseivation. the HITRAN 
1992 database, and an initial ozone profile based on a 
seasonal average of ozone sonde data (S. Oltmans. 
NOAACMDL. personal communication. 1992). TheN,0 
profile was the ATMOS midlatitude zonal average 
[Gunson et al. 1990]. with a 6 km upward shift to account 
for the high tiopopause over Hawaii. The difference be- 
tween the observed and calculated spectra is shown below 
the spectra on an expanded scale. The residuals show a 
predominantly random noise component except for a few 
points near the ozone lines with larger excursions. The 
larger residuals are probably due to the real ozone 
altitude profile being different than the average profile 
used bv the algorithm, but the total column is insensitive 
to the shape of the stratospheric part of the profile. 

Each day's data consists of 3 spectra covering 800 to 
1250 Kaysers. collected at 3 different solar zenith angles. 
Two small spectral intervals are fitted for each of the 
spectra. The intei^als and lines used are listed in Table 1. 
These fits result in 6 ozone and N,0 values, unless some 
of the spectra are discarded. Spectra aie rejected if they 
appear unusual, or if the residuals aie too large. The 
individual fit values are averaged to determine the ozone 
and N,0 columns. Each column amount included here is 
the average of at least 2 separate fits. 

Results 

The Dobson data used here was supplied by the WMO 
World Ozone Data Center (Toronto. Canada). The mean 
total ozone column determined by the FTIR is 4.6'/- lower 
than the Dobson. After multiplying FTIR results by 
1.046. the RMS difference between the FTIR and Dobson 
is 2.1'"''t . Figure 2 shows the total column ozone measured 
bv the nvo techniques (after multiplying the FTIR by 
l'046) for the period November I. 1991 through Septem- 
ber 6. 1992. when measurements were available on the

Discussion 

The agreement behveen the FTIR and Dobson after 
removing the bias is surprisingly good. We have not yet 
done a detailed error budget for the retrie\als. however, 
the NO columns have an RMS deviation of less than 
2.2'1^. The absolute accuracy of the ozone column 
retrieved depends upon several factors, including the line 
parameters and systematic errors in the retrieval. For the 
comparison done here, the absolute accuracy of the line 
intensities is of less importance than the accuracy relative 
to the UV cross-sections used by the Dobson instrument. 
Since the determination of the infrared intensities is 
almost alwavs done by measuring the ozone amount using 
the UV cross-sections, the IR to tV accuracy is quite 
hieh. Pickett et al. [1992| claim \''i on the average for 
this process. However, individual lines, which aie used 
here, may differ by as much as .5'y . Our two intervals are 
self consistent to less than 2'// . Pickett et al. also find that 
the ozone line intensities for this band on the HITRAN 
database should be multiplied by 1.051. This would 
further reduce the column reported by the FTIR making 
it 9.9^^ lower than the Dobson. On the other hand, we 
believe that using recent values of absorption for the 
Dobson data processing would reduce the FTIR and 
Dobson discrepancy by about 3T 

The techniques respond differently to changes in the 
vertical distribution of ozone. Surface ozone, monitored 
at MLO. can change by more than a factor of 2. If this 
change occurred throughout the troposphere, a significant 
(ssloVr) difference in the total column would result. We 
use a tropospheric ozone profile which increases slightly 
with altitude up to the tropopause. with a surface value of 
45 ppbv. Because of pressure broadening of the ozone 



lines at low altitudes, this FUR retrieval would report 
almost the same column for larger or smaller tropospheric 
amounts. The Dobson technique would report a change 
in the column. 

Although we know of no other direct comparisons 
between infrared and Dobson techniques. UV and FTIR 
instruments have been compared on aircraft |Margitan et 
al.. 1989), and aircraft borne FTIR systems compared to 
TOMS |Toon et al.. 1992|. Toon et al. noted a y/r bias 
between infrared and TOMS ozone values outside of the 
Arctic vortex. They attribute the difference to a discrep- 
ancy in infrared and ultraviolet cross sections, however, 
they notice the opposite bias inside the vortex. The 
infrared line intensities used may have to be adjusted due 
to the recent changes. Margitan et al. report a compari- 
son of FTIR and UV measurements from aircraft over 
Antarctica. Thev noted very good agreement on one 
flight, and some separation between two different FTIR 
instruments on a second flight. However, their ozone line 
intensities would have to be increased by either 9''/( (to 
match the 1992 HITRAN database) or 14'/. (to agree 
with Pickett et al.). resulting in too low FTIR reported 
columns. 

Conclusions 

The results of this study are extremely encouraging, 
even though it is based on a relatively small sample of 
overlapping measurements. The two techniques differ so 
widely in instrumentation, analysis, and spectroscopic 
properties, that the agreement to such high precision 
reinforces accuracy of both. 

We have difficulty accounting for the \07r bias implied 
by the Pickett et al. values for the line strengths. 

The data set is expanding rapidly, and further work is 
in progress. Comparison between FTIR and Dobson data 
will be done for other sites, and we are also trying to im- 
prove the FTIR retrieval for tropospheric effects.

High-resoluiion Fourier transform spectra covering the 720-920 cm"' spectral region have 
been used to perform a reanalysis of the i'2 band ((OIO)-{000) vibrational transition) together 
with the first analysis of the 2i': - is hot band of nitrogen dioxide ((020)-(OIO) vibrational 
transition). The high-quality spectra show that, for numerous i'; lines, the hyperfine structure is 
easily obsen able in the case of resonances due to the hyperfine Fermi-type operator. By performing 
a full treatment of the spm-rotation and of the hyperfine operators, a new line list of the v^ band 
(positions and Intensities) has been generated, and it is in e.\cellenl agreement with the experimental 
spectrum. Also, a thorough analysis of the 2('2 - i-j hot band has been performed leading to an 
extended set of new (020) spin-rotation levels. These levels, together with the [( 100). (020), 
(001 )} spin-rotation levels deduced previously from the analysis of the I'l. 2i':, and cj cold bands 
performed in the 6.3- to 7.5-Mm spectral range [.\. Perrin. J.-M. Flaud. C. Camy-Peyret, A.-M.

I. INTRODUCTION 

The cold V2 band and the 2i': - vi first hot band of nitrogen dioxide, located at 13 
^ira, correspond, respectively, to the (OIO)-(OOO) and (020)-(010) vibrational tran- 
sitions of this molecule; consequently, in order to have accurate line positions it is 
necessary to have precise parameters for both the upper and the lower vibrational 
states involved in these transitions. 

For the (000) and (010) vibrational states, the most recent spectroscopic parameters 
were obtained from a simultaneous fit of the available microwave or double resonance 
data (Refs. {1-8) and (9, 10) for the (000) and (010) state, respectively) and of the 
infrared spin-rotation energy le\els obtained from recent analyses of Fourier transform 
spectra recorded in the far infrared {11) and in the 13.3-Mm {12) spectral regions. 

In the analysis of the (OOO)-(OOO) band, even at the high resolution of the far- 
infrared experimental spectra, the hyperfine structure is usually not detectable, except 
in cases of /oca/ resonances due to the Fermi contact hyperfine operator. .Accordingly, 
the line list {11, 13. 14) of the pure rotation region of NO2 (~0-200 cm"') was 
generated by explicitly taking into account the spin-rotation and hyperfine structures. 

On the other hand, this effect could not be observed so accurately in the 13.3-;/m 
experimental spectrum which was used in Ref. {12) for the analysis of the vi band,

and consequently the line lisi ( i:-14) generated in the 13.3-Mm spectral range did 
noi include the h\pertine structure. 

For the (020) xibrational state, the most recent spectroscopic parameters were ob- 
tained from a recent analysis ( Z.-^) of the i-,. 2i';. and vy bands (( lOO)-(OOO). (020)- 
( 000 ) . and ( 00 1 )- ( 000 ) vibrational transitions, respectively ) using Founer transform 
spectra ( 75. 76) covering the 6.3-;jm region. .Actualh the (001) state is inxolved in a 
strong Coriolis interaction with the (020) and (100) states, and the very weak 2j'2 
band borrows its intensity from the strong !•, band. In fact, only the A'„ = 0-2 subbands 
for .V < 46 (because they appear in a clear window between r, and I'O and the K^ = 
6 subband for 19 < .V « 62 (because the corresponding (020) levels are strongly 
resonating with le%els of (001 ) state) could be analyzed at 6.7 ^m ( 15-17). Finally, 
it must be pointed out that for the energy level calculations of the {(100). (020). 
(001 )} interacting vibrational states, both the spin-rotation and the vibrational Co- 
riolis-type interactions were explicitly taken into account, but that the hyperfine struc- 
ture was not considered: 

(i) For the .^-type vj. band, which is by far the strongest band at 6.3 fim. the hyperfine 
resonances affect only some v:, nonresolved doublets, the spin splittings of which vanish 
in the upper and lower levels of the transition. In this case, the hyperfine structure is 
blended within the total line width, and the hyperfine components cannot be observed. 

(ii) Because of the weakness of the r, and 21^2 bands the hyperfine structures cannot 
be precisely measured on the spectra and consequenth the h\perfine resonances were 
not considered for these bands. 

Using new high-resolution Fourier transform spectra recorded in the 1 3.3-A^m spectral 
region, we report in this paper a reanalysis of the ;■; band (with a full treatment of the 
hyperfine structure), together with a first analysis of the hot 2i': - i': band of '""N "^O;. 

II. EXPERIMENTAL DET.AILS 

The spectra were recorded in the 720-960 cm'' spectral range at 0.002 cm"' res- 
olution with the BOMEM Fourier transform spectrometer of the University of Denver. 
The optical path length was 1 m. and two spectra were recorded at NO; pressures of 
1 and 2 Torr. The calibration of the spectra was performed by means of N:0 absorption 
lines (75. 79) in the 1150-1250 cm"' region, and the accuracy of the positions of 
unblended lines is estimated to be -0.0002 cm"' . 

III. ANALYSIS AND LINE POSITION CALCLLATIONS 

The i>: Band 

The analysis was started by comparing the experimental line positions to the line 
list calculated in Ref (72). ONcrall. the agreement was excellent except for transitions 
in which the upper or the lower state are involved in a hyperfine Fermi resonance. 
Consequently, a new line list was generated for the r; band, taking into account not 
only the electron spin-rotation interaction, but also, as described in Ref ( 77 ) for the 
(000) state, the magnetic hyperfine hamiltonian (i.e.. the Fermi contact operator to- 
gether with the spin-spin dipolar interaction operators ) and the nuclear quadrupole 
interaction. For this calculation we used the vibrational band center, rotational, spin- 
rotation, and hyperfine constants of Ref (12) and Ref (77). respectively, for the 
upper and lower state of the transition. 

The agreement this time pro\ ed to be excellent for all the lines. How e\ er. we obsened

ones uhich is due xo a sl.diiU diflcrent calibration of ihe spectra used in the present 
work ( IS yv) compared to that used CO) m 1988. This leads to a d.tierent vibrat.ona 
band center of the ,. band: £.0,0, = 749.652561 cm > (instead of 749.6^2961 cm 
obtained previouslv in Ref. ( /2)). r^^^^H 

To show the quality of the expenmental spectra and ot the calculations performed 
in the present work, we show in Figs. 1 and 2 ponions around 771.8 and 7^8.0 cm 
of the experimental spectra together with lme-b>-line calculations performed usmg 
either the line list generated m Ref. ( /2 ) ( no hx perfine structure ) or the line list denved 
here (full treatment of the hyperfine operators). In both regions, the improvement 
broueht bv the new calculation is %er>' clear. , , • ,u 

In^he first spectral region, the complex hyperline structure appears clearly m the 
V = even ''Qr-i subband. M 771.30 and 771.64 cm"' it is due to a strong hyperfine 
resonance involving the (010 1[22 2 20] and (010 ) [20 2 1 8 ] rotational leve s. At 77_ 
cm-' since the resonance is weaker, one obser^■es mainly a broadening of the A - 
18 doublet structure. The same hyperfine effect can be clearly observed in Rg^ 
around 758 cm"' for lines belonging to the ''O.-^u subband. It is worth stressing that 
in both cases the new calculation, which invohes the hyperfine operators, reproduces 
the experimental spectrum \xith high accuracv'.

However because this hot band is weak and because the (020) spectroscopic parameters 
available at that time were not precise enough ( onh the A", = 0. 1 . 2 (020 ) senes were 
derived from the analysis of the 2., band performed at 6.6 ^rra(17)). only a few lines 
involving the J^, = 0. 1. 2 (020) rotational series could be analyzed at 13.3 ^m. 

The (0^0) parameters were recently significanth improved from a new analysis ot 
the { ., 2.,, V, ] interacting bands {15). Indeed, more lines involving the A. - 1 
2 series were assigned: also, lines involving the K, = 6 rotational series of (020). 
which borrow their intensities from ., through a Coriolis interaction, were ob- 
served (15. 16). . . . ■ 

Consequently, from the ;( 100). (020). (001 ) I and (010) parameters obtained m 

Ref. {15) and Ref. ( 12) respectively, it has been possible to better predict the -r. 
i'. line positions, as performed in the present anah sis. 

" Because the ^'^ - ^- band is rather weak, only transitions of this band involving .\ 
< 30 rotational quantum number could be identified in the spectrum. For transitions 
involving the A". = 0-2 and A'. = 6 (020) energ> levels, the agreement between the 
obsened'and the predicted line positions was excellent, but this was not completely 
the case for lines involving the A", = 3-5 (020) rotational levels since small discrepencies 
(up to 0030 cm-' ) were observed. Using these new data, we then determined the 
vibrational band centers, rotational, spin-rotation, and coupling constants of the 
{(100) (0^0) (001)} resonating states. .As in Ref. (15) the Hamiltoman matnx 
explicitlv takes into account both the Conolis and the spin-rotation interactions. For 
this least-squares fit calculation, the 1 64 ( 020 ) new spin-rotation ^"^^g^^'^^J^ °^^f '"f 
in the present work for A", ^ 6 and A' < 30 were combined to the 32.0 ( 100) (001) 
and (020) energy levels obtained in Ref. {15).

pling constants deduced from the fit. together with their estimated uncertainty. The

Because of the rather high proportion of so-called IF ¥= AJ ¥= A.V "forbidden" 
transitions which were not considered in the 1988 calculation (72). the present cal- 
culated lines are more numerous than those in 1988 (30 620 instead of 8065 X 3,

High-resolulion Fourier transform spectra covering the 720-920 cm"' spectral region have 
been used to perform a reanalysis of the ci band ((OIO)-(OOO) vibrational transition) together 
with the first analysis of the 2i'2 - 1-2 hot band of nitrogen dioxide ((020)-(010) vibrational 
transition). The high-quality spectra show that, for numerous r; lines, the hyperfine structure is 
easily observable in the case of resonances due to the hyperfine Fermi-type operator. By performing 
a full treatment of the spin-rotation and of the hyperfine operators, a new line list of the ^2 band 
(positions and intensities) has been generated, and it is in excellent agreement with the experimental 
spectrum. Also, a thorough analysis of the 2i'2 - "2 hot band has been performed leading to an 
extended set of new (020) spin-rotation levels. These levels, together with the [(100). (020). 
(001 )} spin-rotation levels deduced previously from the analysis of the i-,. 2ii2.and 1-3 cold bands

I. INTRODUCTION 

The cold ^'2 band and the lv2- vi first hot band of nitrogen dioxide, located at 13 
;;m, correspond, respectively, to the (OIO)-(OOO) and (020)-(010) vibrational tran- 
sitions of this molecule; consequently, in order to have accurate line positions it is 
necessary to have precise parameters for both the upper and the lower vibrational 
states involved in these transitions. 

For the (000) and (010) vibrational states, the most recent spectroscopic parameters 
were obtained from a simultaneous fit of the available microwave or double resonance 
data (Refs. {1-8) and (9, 70) for the (000) and (010) state, respectively) and of the 
infrared spin-rotation energy le\els obtained from recent analyses of Fourier transform 
spectra recorded in the far infrared (77) and in the 13.3-Mm (72) spectral regions. 

In the analysis of the (OOO)-(OOO) band, even at the high resolution of the far- 
infrared experimental spectra, the hyperfine structure is usually not detectable, except 
in cases of /oca/ resonances due to the Fermi contact hyperfine operator. Accordingly, 
the line list (77, 13, 14) of the pure rotation region of NO2 (—0-200 cm"') was 
generated by explicitly taking into account the spin-rotation and hyperfine structures. 

On the other hand, this effect could not be observed so accurately in the 13.3-Mm 
experimental spectrum which was used in Ref (72) for the analysis of the V2 band,

and consequeniK the line list ( 12-14) generated in the l3.3-pm spectral range did 
iioi include the hyperline structure. 

For the (020) vibrational state, the most recent spectroscopic parameters were ob- 
tained from a recent analysis ( 75) of the r,. Ir^. and r; bands (( lOO)-(OOO). (020)- 
( 000 ) . and ( 00 1 ) -( 000 ) vibrational transitions, respectively ) using Founer transform 
spectra ( 15. 16) covering the 6.3-^m region. Actualh the (001 ) state is in\ol\ed in a 
strong Coriolis interaction with the (020) and (100) states, and the \en.' weak 2i'2 
band borrows its intensity from the strong vy band. In fact, only the A'„ = 0-2 subbands 
for .V < 46 (because they appear in a clear window between r, and vy I and the Ka = 
6 subband for 19 < N < 62 (because the corresponding (020) levels are strongly 
resonating with levels of (001 ) state) could be analyzed at 6.7 ^m ( 15-17). Finally, 
it must be pointed out that for the energy level calculations of the {(100), (020). 
(001 )} interacting vibrational states, both the spin-rotation and the vibrational Co- 
riolis-type interactions were e.\plicilly taken into account, but that the h\ perfine struc- 
ture was not considered: 

(i) For the .J-typeci band, which is by far the strongest band at 6.3 ^m. thehyperfine 
resonances affect only some vy nonresohed doublets, the spin splittings of \\hich vanish 
in the upper and lower levels of the transition. In this case, the hyperfine structure is 
blended within the total line width, and the hyperfine components cannot be observed. 

( ii) Because of the weakness of the r, and 2;'2 bands the hyperfine structures cannot 
be precisely measured on the spectra and consequeniK the h% perfine resonances were 
not considered for these bands. 

Using new high-resolution Fourier transform spectra recorded in the 1 3.3-Mm spectral 
region, we report in this paper a reanalysis of the ;': band (with a full treatment of the 
hyperfine structure), together with a first analysis of the hot 2!'; - I'^band of '"'N ' Oi. 

II. E.XPERIMENT.^L DETAILS 

The spectra were recorded in the 720-960 cm"' spectral range at 0.002 cm"' res- 
olution with the BOMEM Fourier transform spectrometer of the University of Denver. 
The optical path length was 1 m. and two spectra were recorded at NO; pressures of 
1 and 2 Torr. The calibration of the spectra was performed by means of N;0 absorption 
lines (18. 19) in the 1150-1250 cm'' region, and the accuracy of the positions of 
unblended lines is estimated to be -0.0002 cm"' . 

ill. ANAL>SIS AND LINE POSITION CALCULATIONS 

The V: Band 

The analysis was started by comparing the experimental line positions to the line 
list calculated in Ref (12). 0\erall. the agreement was excellent except for transitions 
in which the upper or the lower state are involved in a hyperfine Fermi resonance. 
Consequently, a new line list was generated for the !■; band, taking into account not 
only the electron spin-rotation interaction, but also, as described in Ref ( 77) for the 
(000) Slate, the magnetic hyperfine hamiltonian (i.e.. the Fermi contact operator to- 
gether with the spin-spin dipolar interaction operators) and the nuclear quadrupole 
interaction. For this calculation we used the vibrational band center, rotational, spin- 
rotation, and hyperfine constants of Ref (72) and Ref (77), respectively, for the 
upper and lower state of the transition. 

The agreement this time pro\ ed to be excellent for all the lines. Howe\ er. we observed 
a -0.0004 cm"' global shift of the observed line positions relative to the calculated

ones %vhich is due to a slidiiK diricrem calibraiion of ihe spectra used in the present 
work ( IS /V) compared to that used I JO) in 19SS. This leads to a diflerenl vibrational 
band center ofthe r; band: £.„o, = 749.652561 cm ' (instead of 749.6>2961 cm 
obtained previously in Ref. ( yj)). 

To show the qualitv ofthe experimental spectra and ofthe calculations performed 
in the present work, we show in Figs. 1 and 2 portions around 771.8 and 7>8.0 cm 
of the experimental spectra toeether with line-b>-line calculations performed using 
either the line list generated in Ref. ( 72 ) ( no h> pert^ne structure 1 or the line list denved 
here (full treatment ofthe hyperf^ne operators). In both regions, the improvement 
brouehl bv the new calculation is \ery clear. 

In^the f^rst spectral reeion. the complex hypert^ne structure appears clearly m the 
V = even ^^a-i subband. .At 771.30 and 771.64 cm'' it is due to a strong hyperiine 
resonance involving the (010)[22 2 20] and (010 )[20 2 18] rotational levels. At 772 
cm-' since the resonance is weaker, one observes mainly a broademng ofthe A - 
18 doublet structure. The same hvperfine effect can be clearly observed m Rg. _ 
around 758 cm"' for lines belonging to the ^Ca>u subband. it is worth stressmg that 
in both cases the new calculation, which involves the hyperfine operators, reproduces 
the experimental spectrum with high accuracy. 

The 2v2 - V2 Band 

Lines from the 2('. - v^ band were already obser%ed in the experimental spectrum 
( 7 7) which was used'in 1988 for the analysis ofthe l3.3-/im band of nitrogen dioxide. 
However, because this hot band is weak and because the ( 020 ) spectroscopic parameters 
available at that time were not precise enough ( only the A', = 0. 1. 2 (020) senes were 
derived from the analvsis ofthe 2^-, band performed at 6.6 mhi ( 7 7)). only a few lines 
involving the A:, = 0. 1. 2 (020) rotational series could be analyzed at 13.3 ^m. 

The (020) parameters were recently significantly improved from a new analysis of 
the {v, If^, Vi) interacting bands (75). Indeed, more lines involving the Ka = 0. 1. 
2 series were assigned; also, lines involving the K, = 6 rotational series of (020). 
which borrow their intensities from rj through a Coriolis interaction, were ob- 

sen-ed (75, 76). , • j ■ 

Consequentlv. from the ;( 100). (020). (001 ): and (010) parameters obtamed m 

Ref. ( 75) and Ref. ( 72) respectively, it has been possible to better predict the 2i'2 
I'. line positions, as performed in the present anahsis. 

" Because the 2i'^ - r. band is rather weak, only transitions of this band involving .\ 
^ 30 rotational quantum number could be identified in the spectrum. For transitions 
involving the A', = 0-2 and A', = 6 (020) energN levels, the agreement betsxeen the 
observed and the predicted line positions was excellent, but this was not completely 
the case for lines involving the A, = 3-5 (020) rotational levels since small discrepencies 
(up to 0.0030 cm"' ) were observed. Using these new data, we then determined the 
vibrational band centers, rotational, spin-rotation, and coupling constants of the 
{(100) (020). (001)1 resonating states. As in Ref. (75) the Hamiltonian matnx 
explicitly takes into account both the Coriolis and the spin-rotation interactions. For 
this least-squares fit calculation, the 164 (020) ne« spin-rotation energy levels obtained 
in the present work for A, < 6 and .V ^ 30 were combined to the 3230 ( 100) (001 ) 
and (020) energy levels obtained in Ref. (75). 

Table I gives the list of vibrational energies and rotational, spin-rotation, and cou- 
pling constants deduced from the fit. together with their estimated uncertainty. The

significant improvements were obtained in the present calculation for the ( 020 ) spin- 
rotation levels and to a lesser extent for the (001 ) levels compared with the results 
obtained previously (15): the percentages of experimental energy lex els which are 
reproduced within 0.001 cm"' are now 84.5 and 19. Vc instead of 69.5 and 77^o for 
(020) and (001 ), respectix'ely.

This section presents the calculations- which have been performed in order to gen- 
erate a precise line list of absorption lines of '''N '"O; in the 13.3-^m region.

Also, for this calculation the effect of the hvperfine structure was expliciily taken into 
account, as described in Ref (11). through the standard tensorial formalism using a 
F = J + I and J = N + S coupling scheme.

Because of the rather high proportion of so-called IF i^ \/ i= AA' "forbidden"

Using high-resolution Fourier transform spectra, a new analysis of the .. band of 
'^N '^O; involving the hNperfine structure has been performed for the first time together 
with the first extensive anahsis of the 2r: - <■: band of this molecule, leadmg to a very- 
accurate representation of the absorption of 'N '^O: in the 13.3-Mm region U must 
be mentioned that lines of the .3 band of NO: are visible in the Ln.vers.ty of Denver 
balloon flight spectra of June 1988 ( 22). and knowledge of their parameters (and ines 
of the hot band) may be important in attempts to detect the weakly absorbing lines 
of stratospheric CIO in the infrared {23).

1 . Introduction 

The Earth's atmosphere contains a trace amount (-few 
parts per tinllion) of SF^ . Earliest measurements [Krey etal., 
1977; Singh et al.. 1977] indicated concentrations of less than 
1 pai^t per trillion by volume (pptv) in the 1970s. Although 
there is no continuous long-term global monitoring of this 
gas, intermittent samplings [Singh et a!.. 1977, 1979; Leifer 
et al.. 1982] and sampling of ocean water [Watson and 
Liddicoat, 1985] have indicated an increasing trend. Recent 
papers by Rinsland et al. ( 1990fl. b] and Zander et al. [1991] 
provided additional evidence for the increasing trend. The 
possibility that SF^ may contribute to the global warming 
was raised by Ranmnathan et al. [1985. 1987], but no 
quantitative assessment was made by the authors. 

Assessment of the greenhouse warming impact of the 
species requires knowledge on its radiative property and 
information on its lifetime and atmospheric budget so that its 
future abundance in the atmosphere can be predicted. Our 
understanding of the life cycle (or budget) of atmospheric 
SFfe was hampered, in part, by the lack of global emission 
data. This paper discusses some of its commercial applica- 
tion and usage and provides an estimate of worldwide 
production of SF^, from which a global emission rate is 
derived and extrapolated for the next 20 years. The second

objective of the paper is to estimate the atmospheric lifetime 
of SFfi using several different approaches: estimates based 
on a known mechanism (e.g., photolysis and atmosphenc 
oxidation) and/or mass balance method. The third objective 
is to calculate the radiative forcing of SFj based on our 
recent laboratory infrared absorption cross section and to 
compute the expected warming over the time period 1950- 
2010 according to several emission scenarios. 

2. Uses of Sulfur Hexafluoride and Sources 
OF Atmospheric Emissions 

2.1. Applica tions for Sulfur Hexafluoride and Emission 
Sources 

Sulfur hexafluoride has a unique combination of chemical, 
physical, and electrical properties which make it ideally 
suited for some very specialized industrial applications. By 
far its largest use (approximately 80% of production) is for 
insulation of electrical equipment. The material's high di- 
electric strength and unique arc-quenching ability have en- 
abled the development of safe, reliable gas-insulated high- 
voltage circuit breakers, substations, transformers, and 
transmission lines. Sulfur hexafluoride provides an effective 
alternative to insulating oils (which suffer from high mainte- 
nance costs, disposal problems, and safety problems due to 
the flammable oil). SF^-insulated equipment also has impor- 
tant advantages over vacuum- or air-insulated equipment 
which require more space and are not well suited for 
switching very high voltages. 

There are two main sources of emission from bfj- 
insulated electrical equipment. SFg can escape from the 
container through seals and gaskets. Older equipment is 
prone to leak in this manner as it is typically pressurized to 
0.015-0.03 N m'^ (100-200 psi) with SF^. Newer designs for 
SFft-filled switchgear allow operation at near-ambient pres- 
sure and have greatly improved seals giving rise to leakage 
rates of less than 1%/yr. Emissions may occur when SF^-

emitted to the atmosphere in the same year. 



filled equipment is opened for servicing, which typically 
occurs after several years of operation. Earlier many utilities 
simply vented the SF5 to the atmosphere prior to servicing. 
The rapid increase in the concentration of atmospheric SF^ 
observed during the 1980s may largely be attributable to 
these sources. However, present standard industry practice 
minimizes losses as the gas is evacuated from the equipment, 
purified, and stored until the equipment is ready to be 
refilled. The recent improvements in equipment and gas 
recycling will tend to mitigate future increases. 

Another use (5-10% of production) is in blanketing or 
degassing molten reactive metals [MacNeal et a!., 1990]. 
Sulfur hexafluoride can be used to replace CFCs or chlorine 
in aluminum degassing. Dilute blends (5 vol % or less) of SF^ 
and an inert gas (nitrogen or argon) are bubbled through 
molten aluminum to remove solid impurities and entrapped 
hydrogen. Almost no sulfur hexafluoride escapes the molten 
metal as it readily reacts to form aluminum fluoride. Blan- 
keting of magnesium during alloying and casting is another 
but much smaller application. Unlike aluminum degassing, 
most of the SF^ is not consumed during this process. 

There are a number of smaller applications for sulfur 
hexafluoride. One of significance to atmospheric scientists 
has been its use as a tracer. Because of sulfur hexafluoride's 
very large electron capture cross section, detection of this 
gas below the parts per trillion range is possible. It has been 
used as tracers of pollutants in urban areas [Drivas and 
Shair, 1974; Vandeborght et al., 1982] and as a discharge 
testing agent for halon 1301 fire suppression systems. 

2.2. Historical Production and Release Data 

Yeariy production or sale volumes have never been re- 
ported; however, a rough estimate puts the 1989 worid 
production rate at about 5 kt/yr. Estimates for the historical 
release rate are available for the years 1953 to 1974 [see Krey 
et al., 1976]. The emission estimate shown in Table 1 was 
assembled by combining the emission estimates by Krey et 



al. [1976] for the period prior to 1974 with a roughly linear 
interpolation for the years 1974-1989 using the emission rate 
for 1974 and the estimated production rate for 1989. These 
estimates are only approximate because the amount of gas 
that is banked inside electrical equipment is highly uncer- 
tain. While this bank has never been thoroughly investi- 
gated, it appears that it could contain more than 50% of each 
year's production, particulariy for the past 5 to 10 years. 
Thus the values given after 1974 should be considered as the 
upper limits, assuming none of the SF^ is banked. The 
emission by 1989 could be as low as 2.5 kt if 50% of the 
production are indeed banked. The previously mentioned 
improvements in electrical equipment design (better seals) 
and gas recycling practices during maintenance combined 
with the retirement of older (more leak prone) equipment 
will eventually mean that nearly all the SFg that goes into 
this application will never be released. 

3. Atmospheric Lifetimes and Abundance of SFj 

Two approaches have been used to estimate the atmo- 
spheric lifetime of trace gases. The first one utilizes a 
numerical model to calculate the lifetime based on our 
knowledge of specific removal mechanism such as reactions 
with reactive species (0('D), OH), photolysis, hydrolysis, 
etc. [cf. Cicerone, 1979]. Alternatively, the lifetime may be 
derived, without knowing the specific removal mechanism, 
from the observed trends of the concentrations in the atmo- 
sphere together with the knowledge of the historical emis- 
sion rates [cf. Krey et al, 1977; Prinn et al., 1983; Cunnold 
et al, 1983]. Other more indirect approaches include con- 
sideration of the vertical distribution and/or interhemi- 
spheric asymmetries. This information is often helpful in 
pointing to the existence of other possible sources or sinks in 
the atmosphere. 



3.1. Observed Abundance and Lifetime 

Measurements of the tropospheric concentrations of SFj 
have been reported by Singh et al. [1977, 1979, 1983], 
Rasmussen et at. [1981], Rasmussen and Khalil [1983], and 
Watson and Liddicoat [1985]. Additional data have been 
reported using remote sensing techniques from space plat- 
form [KiVij/and ef a/. , 1990a], balloon platform [i?/n5/aA)c/ e/ 
al., 19906], and ground-based stations [Zanc^er era/., 1991]. 
Stratospheric concentrations from aircraft sampling program 
Project Airstream have been reported by Krey et al. [1977] 
and Leifer et al. [1982]. Additional information on the 
vertical distribution of SF^ were reported from the ATMOS 
data [Rinsland et al., 1990a] and balloon data [Rinsland et 
al., 19906]. These results are summarized in Figures 1-3. 
Results reported by Singh et al. [1977, 1979, 1983] indicate 
that the average surface concentrations for 1977 and 1981 
were 0.31 and 0.9 pptv, respectively, for the northern 
hemisphere and 0.27 and 0.8 pptv, respectively, for the 
southern hemisphere. The data reported by Zander et al. 
[1991] show the average tropospheric concentration at 32°N 
were 1.76 pptv in 1981 and 3.18 pptv in 1990. The results 
from Rinsland et al. [1990a, b] show average concentra- 
tions between 12 and 18 km of 1.17 pptv in 1981 and 2.02 
pptv in 1988. Each data set, taken by itself, shows an 
increasing trend in the SF^ concentration. As summarized 
by Zander et al. [1991], trends in the atmospheric concen- 
tration of SF5 have been reported based on the individual

data sets. Because the data were obtained at different 
geographical locations and because of possible differences in 
absolute calibration, it is difficult to combine the data sets to 
form time series for trend analysis. Watson and Liddicoat 
[1985] also reported seawater concentration and derived a 
trend for the atmospheric concentration based on the con- 
centration profile of SFft in the water. However, in the 
absence of reliable estimates for historical emission rates, it 
remains difficult to derive a lifetime from the trends. 

Krey et al. [1977] used the aircraft data between 1974 and 
1975 to estimate the tropospheric and stratospheric burdens 
of SFg and CFC II. A two-box model was used to calculate 
the burdens for this time period using historical emission 
rates between 1953 and 1975. Comparison of the observed 
and calculated burdens led Krey et al. [1977] to conclude that 
SF^ and CFC 1 1 have similar stratospheric lifetimes of about 
2 years, which translated into an atmospheric lifetime of 
about 30 years. However, there is considerable uncertainties 
in both the emission rates and the observed burden derived 
from the observations. 

Indeed, the derived lifetime for CFC 11 appears to be in 
conflict with recent findings. The analysis of Cunnold et al. 
[1986] used ground-based data of CFC 11 at five monitoring 
stations over a 5-year period between 1978 and 1983. Re- 
gression analysis comparing the observed trends at the five 
stations with the calculated trends from a nine-box model 
yielded a lifetime for CFC U of 74(4-31, -17) years. A 
lifetime as short as 59(-i-18, -11) years was obtained using 
the data from a single station. Recent updated estimates 
based on 10 years of data are 41 and 47 years depending on 
analysis method used [Kaye and Penkett. 1993]. 



3.2. Kinetic Data and Estimates for Atmospheric 
Lifetime 

Ravishankara et al. [1992] reported a measured rate for 
reaction with 0('Z)) (1.8 x 10"'" cm' s"'), estimated upper 
limit for reaction with OH (<5 x 10"'' cm' s '), and 
measured photolysis cross section at Ly a wavelength (1.8 x 
10"" cm-). Ravishankara et al. [1992] calculated a lifetime 
due to photolysis of about 13,500 years and a lifetime due to 
reaction with free electrons in the mesosphere of about 4200 
years. Their best estimate for the atmospheric lifetime due to 
photochemical reactions in the atmosphere is 3200 years. 

Using the AER two-dimensional model, which explicitly 
calculates the OH and 0('D) concentrations, we calculated 
the steady state atmospheric lifetime of SFft to be longer than 
60,000 years. With the upper limit value for the OH reaction, 
reactions with OH and 0('Z)) contribute about equal 
amounts to the removal rate. According to Hertzberg [1966], 
SFs absorbs UV radiation only below 110 nm. Measure- 
ments made on the UV cross section indicate an upper limit 
of 2 X 10"^^ cm^ between 185 and 300 nm (R. Bray, private 
communication, 1989). If one assumes a UV absorption 
cross section of 2 x 10"" cm- for wavelength less than 240 
nm and zero for wavelength longer than 240 nm, one obtains 
a photolysis lifetime of about 1000 years. This estimated 
lifetime will be much longer as the cutoff shift to wavelengths 
shortward of 240 nm. Other removal mechanisms include 
electron capture and ion reactions [see Fershenfeld, I97I]. If 
these reactions are assumed to be effective only in the 
ionosphere, estimated lifetimes will be of the order of 10 
years.

removal is also estimated to be of the order of 10^ years and 
longer. (See Wine and Chameides [1989] and Butler et al. 
[1991] for a discussion of estimating ocean removal lifetime.) 
The same argument would indicate that lifetime due to 
washout is long. We do not have any estimate for lifetime 
due to dry deposition. The lifetime is likely to be long based 
on the inert nature of SF^. 

3.3. Model Results 

With the emission rates given in Table 1 , we used the AER 
two-dimensional model [Ko et a/., 1991; Weisenstein et al., 
1992] to calculate the atmospheric concentration of SF^. 
Results from two simulations will be presented. In both 
cases the emissions are assumed to be restricted to the 
northern hemisphere between 23° and 62°N. Case 1 corre- 
sponds to the calculation assuming no photochemical re- 
moval in the atmosphere. In case 2 the photochemical 
removal rate for SF5 is assumed to be identical to that of 
CFC 11, corresponding to a model-calculated steady state 
atmospheric lifetime of 49 years. 

The calculated latitude-height cross sections for the mix- 
ing ratio of SF^ for 1975 are shown in Figures 4 and 5 for 
cases 1 and case 2, respectively. The calculated tropospheric 
burden is about 0.4 pptv with variations over latitude and 
altitude. In both cases the mixing ratio at the southern 
mid-latitude is typically about 20% smaller than the mixing 
ratio at northern latitude. The burden in case 2 is 10% 
smaller than that in case 1. The largest difference between 
the two cases is seen in the stratosphere with case 2 showing 
a much sharper vertical gradient reflecting the effect from the 
imposed stratospheric removal. The calculated concentra- 
tions in case 1 show little variation with altitude above 19 km 
indicating that SF5 is well mixed in the stratosphere. The 
altitude profiles for the average mixing ratio in the northern 
hemisphere are shown in Figure 6 together with the derived 
average profile for the northern hemisphere reported by 
Krey et al. [1977, Table 2]. Note that even in case 1 the 



mixing ratio is not uniform in the troposphere because the 
species is not in steady state. The vertical profile shows that 
the concentration at 25 km is typically 70% of the tropo- 
spheric concentration in case A. The calculated scale heights 
in cases 1 and 2 around 20 km are consistent with the 
1974-1975 Project Airstream data [Krey et al., 1977] and the 
mixing ratio profile derived from the ATMOS data 
[Rinslandet al., 1990a]. 

The calculated annually averaged concentrations of SFj 
between 1970 and 1990 at selected altitudes for AT'S, 28°N, 
and 47°S are shown in Figures 1-3, respectively. Included in 
the figures are the observations discussed in the previous 
section. Note that since the emission is increasing with time, 
the stratospheric mixing ratio consistently lags behind the 
tropospheric mixing ratio by about 4 years for case 1. 

In an ideal situation where the emission history and the 
atmospheric concentration are precisely known, comparison

of the calculated concentration with observation could pro- 
vide validation of the assumed lifetime. Two features could 
be used in the comparison. The first is the calculated burden 
at any point in time. The second is the vertical gradient of the 

mixing ratio. 

Comparison of the measured concentrations mdicates that 
an uncertainty of at least 10% exists in the burden derived 
from measured concentrations. The emission data in Table 1 
indicate that 62.6 kt of SFg would have accumulated in the 
atmosphere if there is no removal. An assumed lifetime of 49 
years and 100 years would imply that the burden by 1989 is 
15 and 10% smaller, respectively. Given these uncertainties, 
we estimate that it is difficult to use the observed burdens to 
distinguish lifetimes longer than 100 years. In addition, the 
uncertainty in the calculated burden due to uncertainty in the 
emission rate is of the same order. If we assumed that only 
a portion of the manufactured SFj is released to the atmo- 
sphere and that the fraction varies linearly from 1 in 1976 to 
0.5 in 1989, the accumulated burden in 1989 (assuming no 
removal) would be 48.7 kt, or 22% smaller. Given the 
uncertainty associated with deriving atmospheric burden 
from sampled data and the uncertainty in the emission rate, 
the available data base on the observed concentration of SF^ 
is of limited utility in distinguishing among lifetimes of 100 
years or longer. 

The second approach is the analysis of vertical gradient m 
the stratosphere. The model results showed that the calcu- 
lated concentration in the lower stratosphere for cases 1 and 
2 could differ by a factor of 3 (0.5 pptv versus 1 .5 pptv) in the 
present-day stratosphere. In the past this approach has been 
faced with the difficulty of determining whether the data 
collected from limited locations and times represent the 
climatological mean. Recent works associated with the var- 
ious aircraft campaigns [Schoeberl et al., 1989; Hartmann el 
al, 1989; Plumb and Ko, 1992] showed that simultaneously 
measured values of a dynamical or chemical tracer could be 
used to help interpret the measured values. Concentrations 
of N2O, a good chemical tracer, is available from the Project 
Airstream data that cover the time period from 1974 to 1979 
[Krey et al., 1977; Leifer et al., 1982]. Work is under 
progress in collaboration with R. Leifer (Environmental 
Measurement Laboratory, Department of Energy (DOE)) to 
reexamine the data. Additional data in the lower strato- 
sphere around the ER 2 altitude will be extremely useful in 
differentiating the lifetimes.

reported measurements from previous work. The values 
reported in this work are typically 10 to 20% larger than 
previous measurements. 

4.2. Long-Wave Flux 

Because of the small gas concentration in the atmosphere 
we use the mean absorption coefficient approximation to 
calculate the radiation flux for the individual absorption 
bands. In this treatment the layer absorption in the fre- 
quency interval Am,- is approximated by 



A/ = 1 - exp 



-k:U) 



4.1. Absorption Band Data 

SFfi has been identified, along with CF4 and C^F^ as one 
of many man-made species whose concentration may be 
increasing and may have a greenhouse effect [e.g., Ra- 
manathan et al., 1985]. Measurement was made in the 
Allied-Signal Laboratory (R. Bray, private communication, 
1989) to obtain the spectral absorption coefficient at 0.125 
cm"' resolution in the spectral region. 640-1225 cm ' taken 
at background Nj pressure of 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 atmosphere 
at room temperature. The major band has band limits 
915-960 cm"'. The spectra in this region for the 0.01 
atmosphere background case is shown in Figure 7. The 
spectra for the other backgrounds are almost identical. The 
integrated band strength is given in Table 2, together with 



where u is the gas amount in the layer and fc, = 5,/A«,- is the 
mean absorption coefficient over the band with band 

strength 5(. 

The validity of the mean absorption coefficient approxi- 
mation can be verified by comparing the results with more 
detailed calculations employing the high-resolution data. 
The previous results using molecules with a similar absorp- 
tion feature suggest that the mean absorption coefficient 
approximation is a good approximation for concentration up 
to a few parts per billion by volume (ppbv). 

4.3. Greenhouse Effect 

The mean absorption coefficients calculated from the 
spectral data were used in the AER one-dimensional RC 
model [Wang and Molnar, 1985] to calculate the direct 
surface warming due to SFe with a uniform concentration of 
1 ppbv. In the calculation it is assumed that SF^ does not

affect the concentrations of other greenhouse gases through 
photochemical interaction. The data with the largest inte- 
grated band strength (i.e., data taken at N2 background of 
0.01 atmosphere) was used to calculate the upper limit of the 
SFfi greenhouse efifect. The results indicate a greenhouse 
warming of 0.43°C/ppbv, compared to 0.14°C/ppbv for CFC 
11 calculated using the same model [F/j/ter era/., 1990]. The 
results suggest that on a per parts per billion by volume basis 
the greenhouse effect is larger than that of CFC 11 by a 
factor of 3. Note that the calculations do not account for the 
temperature dependence of absorption data. 

Values for the global warming potential (GWP) [see Inter- 
governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 1990] for 
different integration time horizons are given in Table 3. Since 
we are not certain about the lifetime for SFg, we have 
calculated the result for a range of lifetimes. The GWP for 
CFC 11 is also given in the table for comparison. 

5. Scenario Calculations 

To assess the potential greenhouse effects from future SF^ 
emissions, calculations were made to obtain the equilibrium 
surface warming for two hypothetical emission scenarios. 
The emission rates are given in Table 4. In both scenarios 1 
and 2 it was assumed that even with growing demand, the 
atmospheric release rate would stabilize after the year 2000.

librium warming between the years 1950 and 2010 for two emission 
scenarios as described in Tables 1 and 2, Results are shown for 
lifetimes of 25,000 years and 200 years. 



With improvements in the design of electrical equipment, 
gas recycling, other conservation measures, and the aware- 
ness of potential climate impact, this assumption does not 
seem unreasonable. 

The calculated concentrations between 1950 and 2100 are 
shown in Figure 8a for two cases corresponding to an 
effective infinite lifetime (i.e., no removal) and a lifetime of 
200 years. The latter case is included for comparison pur- 
pose. There is no observational evidence to indicate that the 
atmospheric lifetime is shorter than 1000 years. The corre- 
sponding equilibrium warming given by the product of the 
concentration and our calculated warming of 0.43°C/ppbv is 
shown in Figure %b. The equilibrium warming corresponds 
to the equilibrium response to the instantaneous forcing due 
to presence of the greenhouse gas. This is sometimes re- 
ferred to as the potential realizable warming [see Hansen et 
al., 1989]. Actual temperature response will be different 
because of time delay due to the heat capacity of the Earth 
climate system and the time scale for transport of heat into 
the deep ocean. The calculated equilibrium warming by 2010 
is about .004°C. These values are to be compared with the 
estimated equilibrium warming for the other trace gases in 
the same period as summarized in Table 5. 

The projected warming due to CO, and other trace gases 
in 2100 is estimated to be between 2°C to 5°C depending on 
assumed emission [see IPCC, 1990]. The projected SF^ 
warming is about 0.02°C.

respectively. 



6. Concluding Remarks 
The atmospheric lifetime of SF^ due to photochemical 
removal by any known mechanism is estimated to be longer 
than a thousand years. However, lifetime as short as 200 
years cannot be ruled out immediately based on the limited 
measured tropospheric concentrations and emission rates. 
Based on stratospheric measuremems obtained in the 1970s, 
a lifetime similar to that of CFC 1 1 has been suggested [Krey 
et al 1977]. This appears to be unlikely based on prelimi- 
nary analysis of more recent stratospheric data. Refinement 
of worldwide emission data together with additional mea- 
surement of SFfi in the lower stratosphere and/or long-term 
monitoring from ground-based stations will be useful in 
reducing the uncertainty associated with the lifetime and will 
provide a more accurate determination of the global warming 
potential. However, based on the experience of the Atmo- 
spheric Lifetime Experiment-Global Atmosphenc Gases Ex- 
periment (ALE-GAGE) program [Cunnold el al. 1983, 
1986], this may require monitoring over a time penod ot the 
order of half the expected lifetime. 

The infrared absorption cross section of SF^ is reported 
and found to be in good agreement with previously reported 
band strengths. Calculations showed that SF5 is 3 times 
more effective as a greenhouse gas compared to CFC 11 on 
a per molecule basis. However, based on projected emission 
scenarios, the calculated concentration is small. The ex- 
pected warming from SF^ through 2010 is small (0.004 C) 
compared to the warming from CO2 and other trace gases 

(0 8°C) 

The discussion presented here iUustrates a multidiscipline 
approach in which the laboratory kinetic data, emission 
information from the manufacturers, and field measurements 
are interpreted in the comext of the present-day atmosphere. 
This approach could be used to evaluate other greenhouse 
gases. The utility and limitation of this method will depend 
on the quality of the data for each individual species.

Abstract. Absorption features of the c, band of SO, have 
been identified in high resolution infrared solar absorption 
spectra recorded from Mauna Loa, Hawaii, on July 9 and 12, 
1991, shortly after the arrival of the first eruption plume 
from' the Mt. Pinatubo volcano in the Phillipines. A total 
SOj vertical column amount of (5.1 ± 0.5) x 10" molecules 
cm'^ on July 9 has been retrieved based on nonlinear least- 
squares spectral fittings of 9 selected SO, absorption features 
with an updated set of SO, spectral parameters. A SO, total 
column upper limit of 0.9 x 10" molecules cm ^ deduced 
from measurements on September 20-24, 1991, is consistent 
with the dispersion of the SO, cloud and the rapid conversion 
of the SO, vapor into volcanic aerosol particles. 

Introduction 

Lidar observations at Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO), 

Hawaii, indicate the initial arrival of the Mount Pinatubo 

volcanic plume above that station on July 1, 1991, followed 

by 3 generalized pulses or waves on approximately July 3, 

July 24, and August 9 [DeFoor et al., 1991]. Fortuitously, 

we recorded broadband IR solar spectra on July 9-12, 1991, 

shortly after the arrival of the first pulse. These observations 

provided a rare opportunity to measure a number of 

molecular constituents during the early phases of the 

evolution of massive volcanic plume. The present paper 

reports quantitative analysis of SO, absorption features 

identified in these spectra. Additional observations from 

MLO recorded on May 1 1 and September 20-24, 1991 , show 

no detectable SO, features, and are analyzed to obtain SO, 

total column upper limits. 

Observations and Analysis 

Table 1 summarizes the observations from MLO (19.53°N, 
155.58°W, altitude 3400 m) analyzed in this work. The 
solar spectra were recorded with a Bomem model D A3. 002 
Michelson interferometer system capable of operating at 
resolutions up to 0.002 cm"' (full width half maximum 
instrumental line shape). The observing runs were conducted 
as part of an effort to obtain a baseline of measurements at 
MLO for the Network for the Detection of Stratospheric 
Change (NDSC) [Kurylo, 1991]. Daily NDSC IR solar 
measurements are anticipated to commence at MLO next 
year.

Numerous features of the u^ band of SO, (centered at 
1157 71 cm"') have been identified between 1150 and 1190 
cm-' in the July solar spectra. Figure 1 shows several of 
these features in the 1154- and 1162-cm-' regions. The 
features are marked by symbols beneath a spectrum from 
July 9 (top scan), but they are absent in the spectra from 
May 11 (middle scan) and September 22 (bottom scan). 
Transitions of O3 and N,© are also identified in Figure 1. 
Note that the SO, and O3 lines are narrow, indicating 
maximum concentrations in the layers of low pressure 
broadening (i.e., the upper atmosphere). The v^ band is 
about one order of magnitude weaker in intensity than the v, 
band which is the strongest SO, band in the infrared. 
Unfortunately, the v, band (centered at 1362.06 cm"') is 
strongly masked from the ground because of strong 
attenuation by water vapor and methane absorption. Features 
of the SO, V} and ;/, bands have been identified in airborne 
solar absorption spectra of the Mt. Pinatubo plume recorded 
on July 8-14, 1991, over the Caribbean [Mankin et al., 
1991]. Features of the v^ band were used in the retrievals of 
the aircraft spectra. 

Improved spectroscopic parameters for the SO, i', band 
have been generated for this investigation. The line positions 
were computed from the work of Guelachvili et al. [1984, 
1987]. The new line positions are accurate to 0.0004 cm 
and differ by 0.003 cm"' from the values on the 1986 
HITRAN database [Rothman et al., 1987]. The band 
intensity of 3.519x10"" cm-'/(molecule cm"^) at 296 K on 
the 1986 HITRAN compilation [Rothman et al., 1987] has 
been retained since no clear revision could be noted based on 
the published papers (summarized by Smith et al. [1985]). 
The same positions and band intensity have also been 
assumed on the 1991 HITRAN compilation (L. S. Rothman, 
manuscript in preparation, 1991). As a first approximation, 
we adopted a constant air-broadening coefficient of 0.13 
cm-' atm-' at 296 K based on averages of the measurements 
of Hinkley et al. [1972] and the theoretical calculations of 
Tejwani [1972a,b]. The calculations of Tejwani [1972a,b] 
and recent tunable diode laser measurements [Kuhnemann et 
al., 1991] indicate that the air-broadening coefficients 
generally decline with increasing J quantum number; 
incorporation of this decrease will be considered in the next 
line parameters compilation update. Most of the SO, line 
groups used here for the spectral quantification have ground 
state energies in the range of 20-300 cm', which correspond 
to less than 1% intensity change per IK at stratospheric 
temperatures. The integrated lines absorption is small and 
thus insensitive to the halfwidths. The lines of the SO, v, 
band are located in a region of relatively strong atmosphenc 
absorption by 0„ H,0, N,0, HDO, and CH, lines. Hence, 
accurate spectroscopic parameters for these gases were also 
required in the analysis. We adopted the spectroscopic 
parameters from the 1991 HITRAN compilation (L. S. 
Rothman, manuscript in preparation, 1991) for these gases.

The improvements in the quality of the O3 parameters [Flaud 
et al., 1990a,b] were particularly important for accurate 
fitting of the spectra. Thus, all the spectral features are well 
modeled in the simultaneous fitting of SO2 and the other 
trace gases. 

The SO2 total columns were retrieved with a nonlinear 
least-squares spectral fitting algorithm [cf. Rinsland et al., 
1991a, b]. The total vertical column amount of a gas is 
retrieved from a spectrum by scaling an assumed relative 



volume mixing ratio (VMR) profile by a single multiplicative 
factor for all altitudes, which is iteratively adjusted along 
with the values of a number of instrumental parameters (e.g. , 
a wavenumber shift between the measured and calculated 
spectra) until the sum of the squares of the residuals 
(measured minus calculated signals) is minimized. The total 
column amount is calculated by summing the scaled vertical 
absorber column amounts in all layers. 

The reference volume mixing ratio profiles reported by 
Smith [1982] were assumed in our analysis. The profile for 
SO2 is a background profile corresponding to a SO2 total 
column above MLO of 1.1 x 10'^ molecules cm-^ well 
below our detection limit (see below). The Mauna Loa lidar 
measurements of DeFoor et al. [1991] indicate that the 
Pinatubo aerosols in early July were confined to a narrow 
altitude band in the lower stratosphere. We assumed that the 
SO2 was co-located with the aerosols and approximated the 
SO2 plume by a 4-km thick layer centered at 20 km based on 
the lidar profiles presented in Figure 2 of DeFoor et al. 
[1991]. The VMR of SO2 was assumed constant in this 
layer. Tests indicate that the retrieved total columns are 
dominated by the stratospheric layer and are insensitive to 
realistic changes in the assumed altitude and vertical 
thickness of the Pinatubo SO, layer. Since the local 100%

transmission level is retrieved in the fitting procedure, the 
retrievals are not affected by the broad band attenuation of 
aerosols from the eruption. 

Figure 2 illustrates a typical least-squares fit from a 
spectrum recorded on July 9 (the best out of the few 
available scans). The average of the total columns retrieved 
from nine narrow (<0.3 cm"' wide) intervals between 1 154 
and 1180 cm"' was adopted as the final result. An absolute 
uncertainty (1 sigma) of 10% was computed from the root- 
sum-square of the following error sources and their 
magnitudes: (1) SO2 spectroscopic line parameters 
uncertainties (±5%), (2) uncertainty in the assumed SO2 
vertical distribution (±3%), (3) temperature profile 
uncertainties (+2%), (4) interferences from other molecules 
(±3%), and (5) instrumental effects (zero level offsets, 
instrument line shape uncertainties, etc.) (±7%). The upper 
limits for the May and September observations were derived 
by increasing the SO2 VMR in the 4-km thick stratospheric 
layer until features more than 3 times the RMS noise level of 
the measured spectra were produced in simulations generated 
for the same conditions. 



molecules cm"^ (1.9 Dobson units) corresponds to a mean 
SO2 VMR in the assumed 4-km thick stratospheric layer of 
66 ppbv (parts per billion by volume). This value provides 
a clear indication of the high average SO2 concentrations in 
the plume above Mauna Loa at the time of our 
measurements; background SOj VMRs measured in the lower 
stratosphere are - 100 times less [Inn et al., 1981]. The SO2 
features were also seen in spectra recorded on July 12, but 
the reduced signal-to-noise ratio of the available data 
preclude an accurate measurement of the SO2 total column. 
The total column upper limit of 0.9 x 10" molecules cm"^ 
derived from the September 20 to 24 observations is a factor 
of 6 lower than the July 9 measurement. The absence of 
observable SO2 in September is attributed to the rapid 
dispersion of the gas cloud and the rapid conversion of SO2 
into aerosols. Bluth et al. [1991] used TOMS measurements 
of SO2 to estimate that the total amount SO2 had declined by 
one third 14 days after the Pinatubo eruption. 

The strong inhomogeneities and the rapid temporal changes 
in the plume indicated by lidar [DeFoor et al., 1991; Winker 
and Osborne, 1991] and SAGE II measurements [McCormick 
and Veiga, 1991] obtained during July indicate the 
difficulties inherent in comparing our SO2 measurement with 
those obtained in the Caribbean during the same time period. 
Nevertheless, our measurement is close to the total columns 
of 2.0 X 10" to 3.7 X 10" molecules cm"^ obtained using 
IR solar absorption spectroscopy [Mankin et al., 1991]. The 
mean SO2 column of 2.5 Dobson units derived from 
measurements with a differential, vertically-looking UV 
correlation spectrometer [Hoff, 1991] is also in good 
agreement with our result. 

A set of simulations were generated to search for 
absorption features of the HjS vj band in the window region 
between 1210 and 1250 cm'. These calculations were based 
on the H2S line parameters from the 1984 GEISA 
compilation [Husson et al., 1986]. No H2S features were 
found above the noise level of the spectra, and an upper limit 
of 2 X 10'^ molecules cm"^ has been estimated from the 
46.46° solar zenith angle spectrum recorded on July 9, 1991. 
The upper limit is very high because the H2S i'2 band is 
weak. 

The results of this study have shown that high resolution 
ground-based IR observations can be used to measure SO2 
total columns from large volcanic plumes. While the 
sensitivity of the technique is not particularly high for SO2 
(only total columns above 1x10'" molecules cm"^ are readily 
measurable), the regular series of observations planned at the 
NDSC stations might allow future large events to be 
monitored. Such measurements, especially if combined by 
simultaneous lidar observations from the same site, could be 
valuable for studying the conversion of SO2 into stratospheric 
aerosols. The IR observations of SO2 could also be used to 
verify the calibration of SO2 measurements by satellite 
instruments, such as TOMS.

Fig. 1. Examples of '^Nj ( 1-0) band quadrupole lines in the ATMOSand University of Denver infrared 
stratospheric solar occultation spectra. The upper panel (A) shows the region of the 5(9) line in a zonal 
average ATMOS spectrum with tangent altitude of 1 9.7 km. The slight decrease in signal to lower wavenumbers 
is caused by continuous absorption produced by the N^ pressure-induced (1-0) band and sub-Lorentzian 
absorption by the overlapping far wings of the intense COj vj fundamental band (11). The region of the 
0{ 16) line is plotted in the lower panel (B). The spectrum was recorded at a tangent altitude of 23.4 km 
with the University of Denver FTS. The nitrogen lines are identified and marked with vertical ticks in both 
panels. 

with decreasing tangent altitude. The most accurate measurements are obtained from spectra recorded near 
a tangent altitude of 20 km where the stronger 5-branch lines are prominent features in the ATMOS spectra 
(70).' At that altitude, the atmospheric pressure is ~40 Torr, so that the effect of pressure-induced line 
shifts should be small. At lower tangent altitudes, the signal-to-noise ratio is decreased by continuum absorption 
resulting from the collision-induced fundamental vibration-rotation band of N2 and sub-Lorentzian absorption 
produced by the superposition of the far wings of the intense COj vj fundamental band (7/). Also, the 
absorption by other telluric gases generally increases with decreasing tangent altitude so that interference 
effects become more of a limitation. For the present work, to improvf the signal-to-noise ratio, we derived 
the line positions from zonal average ATMOS spectra obtained by coadding neariy equal tangent altitude 
spectra recorded during four sunset occultations near 30°N latitude. The line positions were measured with

a second derivative line finder algorithm and calibrated using accurate line positions reported for the NjO 
vj ( /2) or », + lv2 bands (13). Nitrogen line positions from 1 to 4 ATMOS zonal spectra have been averaged 
for use in the subsequent analysis; the corresponding uncertainties were estimated on the basis of the standard 
deviation of the individual measurements and the calculated uncertainty derived from the formula given 
by Reuter et at. (6). A minimum uncertainty limit of 0.0002 cm"' was adopted to account for the uncertainty 
in the absolute wavenumber calibration. 

The balloon-borne solar spectra were recorded with a filter covering the 1580 to 2230 cm ' region and 
hence provide measurements of only high-^ Nj lines in the O branch. A total of 6 Nj lines between 0( 13) 
and 0( 1 9 ) were selected for measurement based on comparisons of the solar spectra with synthetic spectrum 
calculations. All of the measured transitions are calculated to be free of significant blending by other telluric 
lines. The 0(20) Nj line also appears to be present, but it is at the limit of detection and was not included 
in the analysis. As the Nj lines occur near the edge of the band-pass filter, the continuum signal-to-rms noise 
ratio of a single spectrum decreases from -100 at the 0( 19) line to -50 at the 0( 13) line. The positions 
of the Nz lines were measured from one to three spectra recorded between tangent altitudes of 28.1 and 
18.0 km. Mean values were used in the subsequent analysis. Calibration of the individual solar spectra was 
achieved by comparing measured positions of strong, isolated lines (e.g., H2O and CO2 transitions) with 
values derived from stratospheric spectra recorded with the same instrument during an earlier balloon flight. 
The calibration of this eariier dataset, which covers 1 400 to 1 960 cm"' , is based on H2O standard positions 
{14). sealed by the multiplicative factor recommended by Brown and Toth (15). The frequency scale of 
the new flight data was also checked using accurate NO2 1-3 band line positions (76), as well as direct 
comparisons of measured H2O line center positions with the data of Brown and Toth (15). \ second 
derivative line finder was used here to determine the location of the line centers. Uncertainties were estimated 
as described earlier. Figure 1 presents examples of the Nj lines in the ATMOS ( A ) and University of Denver 
( B) stratospheric solar spectra. 

The line position measurements were analyzed with the Dunham formula for the upper and lower state 

term values (17)

with the coefficients //; obtained from a weighted linear least-squares fit of the stratospheric measurements 
and additional data selected from reported laboratory experiments. Each weight was given by 1 /ff , where 
a is the estimated uncertainty. The additional data were required because the stratospheric dataset covers 
only a limited range of transitions in the O and S branches. Three additional datasets were included: the 
ground state Raman measurements of Bendtsen (i), the Raman (1-0) band 0-branch measurements of 
Bendtsen (i), and the quadrupole 0- and S-branch (1-0) band measurements of Reuter etai.(6). The Q- 
and S-branch ( 1-0) band Raman measurements of Bendtsen (3) were excluded from the fit because they 
show a bias of about -1-0.009 cm"' with respect to our measured line positions and our fitting results: this 
offset was noted previously by Reuter et at. (6). Similarly, the calibrated coherent anti-Stokes Raman 
(CARS) ( 1-0) band Q-branch measurements of Gilson el al. (5) were excluded from the fit because of a 
calibration bias in the data (also about -t-0.009 cm"'). No obvious offset was noted between our measurements 
and the O-branch ( 1-0) band positions from Ref. (i) so we retained those data in the analysis. 

Table I presents the two sets of Dunham coefficients obtained from the least-squares analysis. Set A was 
obtained by fitting the coefficients y,o, Xo, .>'... and Y02 with all other Dunham coefficients constrained to 
zero. For set B, the coefficient Y^ was fitted in addition to the same four Dunham coefficients. Also. Y^ 
was fixed at the value -3.28 X 10"', as determined by Lofthus and Krupenie ( 18), and Yoi was set to 4.78 
X 10-'^ a value estimated from Dunham's theory ( /7) by substituting the Xoi and X,, values from set A 
and the Y,o value of 2358.5665 cm"' from Ref. (5) into Eq. (2) of Reuter et al. (6). The r.o value from 
our analysis was not used in these calculations because only two vibrational states were studied in this work

HC«, HNO„ 0„ CJONO, and NO, from McMurdo, Antarctica during the spring 1987 ozone hole. In the M. Loa 
measurements it was found that the average tropospheric concentrations deduced for CO,, N,0 and CH, arc very 
consistent with correlative NOAA GMCC surface data. 

Of particular interest is the observed increase in the CF,C«, column amount above the S. Pole over the 6 year period, 
corresponding to (3.6 ± 2.1)% year"'. The column amount of HNO3 for both 1980 and 1986 were not sigmflcatitly 
different. Other data sets, such as from the National Solar Observatory (NSO) at Kitt Peak were used for "lomtonng 
trends of HF and HCJ from 0.02-0.005 cm"' spectra obtained during the 1977-1990 period. Lmear mcrease rates of (10.7 
± 1.1)% year"' and (4.9 ± 0.7)%year' have been obtained for HF and HCf respectively. 

We have also been conducting 0.002-0.003 cm' resolution solar absorption ground-based measurements, for periodic 
observations and monitoring of the atmosphere from Denver. The initial measurements were niade with the balloon- 
borne BOMEM FTS system.^ Typical results arc shown in Figures 2-5. More recently, dedicated BOMEM and 
BRUKER FTS have been used, one of which will be moved to Mauna Loa as soon as the NDSC station becomes 
operational. Preliminary results arc shown in Figures 6-10. 

The analysis of the ground-based spectra shows that the trace gases of interest to the NDSC can be well monitored 
from selected spectral intervals of raultiscans measurements, with temperatures and geometry and instrumental 
performance monitored from reference gases. It is apparent that no more than scale height vertical resolution can usually 
be expected for the altitude distribution of the trace gases, and in some cases only the tropospheric and stratospheric 
components could be separated. The translation of the statistical errors of the spectral least squares fitting to absolute 
errors estimates from a priori constraints and accuracies requires further studies. 

-< rnNCLUSiONS 

High resolution stratospheric spectra show many new spectral features not observed in previous lower resolution 
spectra. This requires new analysis of laboratory and atmospheric spectra and improved theoretical calculations for many 
molecular bands of atmospheric interest. Atmospheric spectra remain a powerful source for observing and monitoring 
our changing atmosphere. 

Retrieval methods based on spectral least squares arc best suited for spectroscopic quanlincation. but further 
development are desired.

Long-Term Trends in the Concentrations of SFg, CHCIF2, and COF2 

in the Lower Stratosphere From Analysis of High-Resolution 

Infrared Solar Occultation Spectra 

C. p. RiNSLAND,' A. Goldman.^ F. J. Murcray.^ R. D. Blatherwick,^ J. J. Kosters,^ 
D. G. Murcray,- N. D. Sze,^ and S. T. Massie^ 

Long-tenn trends in the concentrations of SF„ CHCIF: (CFC-22), and COF^ in the jower 
stratosphere have been derived from analysis of ca. 1980 and more recent infrared solar occu'u, 
spectra recorded near 32°N latitude at ~0.0:-cm-' resolution. Consistent sets of line parameters and 
spectral calibration methods have been used in the retrievals to minimize systematic error effects^ 
Ouoted error limits are 1 sigma estimated precisions. The SF^ and CHClFj results are based on 
Tpec^ra recorded by balloon-borne interferometers in March 1981 and June 1988 and a co^anson °f 
hese results with the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) f.''P«n'"^"^Spacelab 3 
measurements obtained in May 1985 near 30°N latitude. In the .3-18 km altitude ^"g^^e me^n 
measured SF^ mixing ratio in parts per trillion by volume (pptv) increased from 1.17 ± 21in March 
7^8! to 2 02 ±™20 pptv in June 1988, and the CHCIF, mixing ratio below 15 km altitude increased 
rom 51 ± 8 pptv in March 1981 to 102 ± 10 pptv in June 1988. The CHCIF: retnevals used new 
empirical CHCIF, line parameters derived from 0.03-cm-' resolution laboratory spectra recorded at 
si^rmpei^tures between 203 and 293 K; the derived mixing ratios are -30% higher than obtained with 
earlier sets of line parameters, thereby removing a large discrepancy noted previously belw«n m and 
in situ measurements of CHCIF,. Assuming an exponential growth model for fitting the "ends, b^ 
Lnd CHCIF, mean increase rates of 7.4% ± 1 .9% and 9.4% ± 1.3% year ' . are °btamed. respec .vely 
which corre'spond to cumulative increases by factors of -1.7 and -2.0 in the ">""" %°"^^ °f J"^ 
gases over the 7.2-year measurement period. Analysis of spectra recorded '" Octobe^ 1979 and April 
1989 yields COF^ volume mixing ratios that are respectively 0.44 ± 0.17 and 1.21 ±0.24 times the 
ATMOS/Spacelab 3 values, from which an average COF, increase rate of 10.3 ± L8% year over 
ihs thne period has been estimated. The present results are compared with P^fvously reported 
observations and trends and with one-dimensionaJ model calculations. The model calculated trends are 
in reasonably good agreement with the observations. 



1. Introduction 

The technique of infrared absorption spectroscopy has 
been used for many years to measure the concentrations of 
gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Because of the long time 
span covered by these observations, there has been consid- 
erable recent interest in analyzing the old spectra and 
comparing the results with newer data to determine the 
long-term trends of important atmospheric gases. For exam- 
ple, ground-based spectra recorded more than 35 years ago 
have been studied to estimate the mean trends in the total 
columns of CH4 and CO [Rinslandet al., 1985; Rinsland and 
Levine, 1985; Zander et al., 1989a, b]. IR spectral measure- 
ments of the stratosphere do not date back quite as far in 
time as the ground-based data sets. Moderate resolution 
(-0.2 cm"') stratospheric observations were first obtained 
in the late 1960s and eariy 1970s [e.g., Murcray et al., 1968, 
1969, 1975; Goldman et al., 1970], followed by high resolu- 
tion (-0.02 cm"') data in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
[e.g., Goldman et al., 1979; Buijs et al., 1980; Murcray, 
1984]. We have begun a program of systematic comparison

of the eariy stratospheric spectra with more recent spectra 
recorded with the same or similar instrumentation under 
similar observing conditions (for example, same latitude, all 
data in the solar occultation mode). An initial analysis of the 
data revealed clear evidence for rapidly increasing concen- 
trations of three important trace gases that have been the 
subject of only limited previous stratospheric investigations. 
In the present paper we report the trends derived for these 
three gases, SF^, CHCIF2, and COFj. 

Sulfur hexafluoride (SFg) and chlorodifluoromethane 
(CHCIF, or CFC-22) are man-made trace atmospheric gases 
with strong absorption bands in the climatically important 8- 
to 13-/xm window region. SFg is widely used as an electrical 
insulating gas in high-voltage electrical and electronic equip- 
ment such as circuit breakers, capacitors, transformers, and 
microwave components because of its high chemical stabil- 
ity and its ability to impede electric breakdown [e.g.. Brown, 
1966]. SFft has also been used as a meteorological tracer 
[e.g., Turketal., 196S; Reiter, 1971; Drivas and Sfiair, 1974]. 
CFc'-22 is primarily used in refrigeration, but about 35% of 
the total is used in fluoropolymer production, which results 
in little release of the gas into the environment [World 
Meteorological Organization, 1986]. Since both gases are m 
wide use and their atmospheric lifetimes are believed to be 
long (perhaps more than 500 years for SF^, [Ramanathan et 
al., 1985] and 10-28 years for CFC-22 [WorWA/ef^oro/o^/ca/ 
Organization. 1982, 1989; Wuebbles, 1983; Hammitt et al., 
1987; Golombek andPrinn, 1989; Fisher et al., 1990]), these 
molecules can be expected to accumulate in our environ- 
ment. The principal sink for CFC-22 is the reaction with 
tropospheric OH. Monitoring its trend and ascertaining its

emission rates provide a means to derive the atmosphenc 
lifetime of CFC-22 and the global average OH concentration 
[International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Programme. 
1989]. This latter result can provide an independent check on 
the global average OH concentration deduced recently from 
the observed methyl chlorofonn trends [Prinn et ai, 1987]. 
Carbonyl fluoride (COF.) is an intermediate product in the 
decomposition of chlorofluorocarbons in the stratosphere 
[Rowland and Molina, 1975; Sze, 1978]. The Atmosphenc 
Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) Experiment/ 
Spaceiab 3 (SL3) measurements indicate that COF2 repre- 
sents one third of the inorganic fluorine column m the 
stratosphere, with the remainder contained in HF [Raper et 
ai, 1987]. COF2 is produced mainly from the decomposition 
of CCI2F2 [e.g." Rowland and Molina, 1975; Jayanty et ai, 
1975] and', to a lesser extent, from other chlorofluorocar- 
bons, sucti as CFC-22 [World Meteorological Organization. 
1989]. Carbonyl fluoride is destroyed by photolysis and 
reaction with 0('D) in the stratosphere [Sze, 1978]. Its 
importance lies in the need to understand the reactions that 
follow the breakup of the chlorofluorocarbons in the strato- 
sphere. Recently, it has been suggested that COF, may react 
with H.O to form HF and CO2 on the surfaces of polar 
stratospheric clouds [Wofsy et al.. 1990]. Thus observations 
of COF, and HF could help elucidate heterogeneous chem- 
ical processes which are important for understanding strato- 
spheric ozone distributions, particulariy over polar regions. 
Carbonyl fluoride is also expected to be an important inter- 
mediate in the decomposition of currently proposed alterna- 
tive fluorocarbons [World Meteorological Organization, 

1989]. 

The measurements and trends reported in this paper are 
based on the analysis of ~0.02-cm-' resolution infrared 
solar occultation spectra recorded during four stratosphenc 
balloon fliehts from launch sites near 32°N latitude. The 
measurements were recorded in October 1979. March 1981, 
June 1988, and April 1989. All of the balloon flights were 
conducted by the University of Denver atmospheric spec- 
troscopy group. In addition, we have compared the retriev- 
als with results derived from the infrared solar absorption 
spectra obtained by the ATMOS experiment during the SL3 
shuttle mission in May 1985 (see Farmer. [1987] for an 



overview of the ATMOS experiment and the SL3 results). 
Care has been taken to use consistent sets of line parameters 
and spectral calibration methods to minimize systematic 
error effects so as to derive the most reliable long-term 
trends All of the measurement data (balloon flight plus the 
ATMOS results) have been included in deriving the trends. 
Model calculations are presented to compare with the ob- 
served trends. The calculations are based on the Atmo- 
spheric and Environmental Research (AER) one-d.nien- 
sional model [Sze and Ko, 1981] with updated rate data 
[NASA 19S7j. Tne niudcl domain is from to ,0 km. it 
includes 150 gas-phase reactions and calculates the concen- 
trations of the oxygen species (O, 0('D)), the hydrogen 
species (H, OH, HO2. H2O2), the nitrogen species (N. NO, 
NO, HNO3, HO,NO,. N2O5, NO3), the chlorine species 
(CI CIO OCIO. CI2O/, HCl, HOCl. CIONO2), the bromine 
species (Br, BrO, BrNO,, BrCl. HBr), and the troposphcnc 
source gases (CH4. N,0. OCS, CSj, CjH^, SFs, CH3CI 
ecu. CCI3F, CCI2F2, CHCIF2, CH3CCI3, CF3CC3. and 
other minor CFC species). The surface fluxes for CCI3F and 
CCl.F, are based on emission data reported by Gamlen et 
al [1986]. The emission data for CHCIF^ are uncertain 
[World Meteorological Organization, 1986]. The atnno- 
spheric release rates (lO' gm yr"') used in the present model 
calculations are 53, 86, and 95 for the years 1975, 1980, and 
1985, respectively. 

2. Balloon Flight Measurements 
Table 1 summarizes important flight and experimental 
parameters for the four balloon flights. In all four expen- 
ments the spectra were recorded at sunset in the solar 
occultation mode. The two eady balloon flights were con- 
ducted from Holloman Air Force Base near Alamogordo, 
New Mexico, on October 10, 1979, and March 23, 1981, 
using a modified Bomen model DA2.01 interferometer sys- 
tem (optical path difference of 50 cm). High and low sun 
spectra from these flights (and an eariier one on October 27,

measured positions and corresponding atmospheric and so- 
lar line identifications [Goldman et al.. 1987]. The launches

Scientific Balloon Facility (NSBF) near Palestine, Texas, on 
June 6, 1988, and from Fort Sumner, New Mexico, on April 
19, 1989, using a new interferometer, a modified Bomem 
model DA3.002 system capable of recording spectra with a 
maximum optical path difference of 250 cm. The new system 
has been described recently [Murcray et al.. 1990], and 
selected regions of the full resolution spectra from the 1988 
flight (and some of the high sun data collected during a 
balloon flight on November 18, 1987) have been published in 
an atlas [Goldman et at., 1989a]. A description of the trace 
gas features observed in the spectra has also been reported 
[Goldman et al.. 19896]. The full resolution spectra were 
recorded at tangent heights above 17 km (1988 flight) and 
above 29 km (1989 flight). Because spectral lines are pres- 
sure-broadened at low altitudes, very high resolution obser- 
vations are less useful in the lower stratosphere and tropo- 
sphere than at higher altitudes, and for this reason the 
interferometer was switched to a mode that allowed the 
rapid recording of spectra with a maximum optical path 
difference of 40 cm. Only the lower resolution spectra were 
used for the retrievals reported in this work. When appro- 
priate, the full resolution scans have been analyzed to verify 
the quality of the line parameters assumed in the analysis. 

3. Data Analysis and Results 

As in a number of earlier investigations, the technique of 
nonlinear least squares spectral fitting has been used to 
analyze the data. Details and examples of the application of 
this method to the analysis of solar occultation spectra are 
presented in papers by Niple [1980], Niple et al. [1980], 
Goldman et al. [1980], and Rinsland et al. [1982]. Initially, 
the vertical profiles of SF^, CHCIF2, and COF, were re- 
trieved from the balloon flight spectra using the onion- 
peeling technique [Goldman and Saunders, 1979). A com- 
parison of the retrieved profiles with the reported ATMOS 
profiles indicated no differences in the relative vertical 
distributions of the three gases outside the errors limits of 
the experiments. Therefore to maximize consistency of the 
results for the derivation of trends, we assumed the vertical 
distributions retrieved from the ATMOS observations and 
derived a single multiplicative scaling factor for each gas 
relative to the reported ATMOS profile. The scale factors 
were determined from the individual spectra, and then the 
average and the standard deviation of these values were 
computed for each occultation to determine the relative 
increase (or decrease) in the stratospheric amount relative to 
the ATMOS observations and a statistical estimate of the

to extrapolate the reported volume mixing ratio profiles to 
higher and lower altitudes, the assumed ATM0S/SL3 verti- 
cal distributions of SF^, CHCIF,, and COF, are listed in 

Table 2. 

Except as noted below, line parameters were taken from 
the 1986 Air Force Geophysics Laboratory high-resolution 
transmission (HITRAN) line list [Rothman et al.. 1987]. 
Correlative pressure-temperature profiles derived from ra- 
diosonde and satellite measurements were used in the ray- 
tracing calculations (M. Gelman and K. W. Johnson, Na- 
tional Meteorological Center (NMC), private commu- 
nications, 1982, 1989). The NMC analysis also yields an 
estimate of the tropopause height. The value for each 
balloon flight is listed in Table 1. 

The spectral intervals selected for the analysis are given m 
Table 3. In addition to retrieving the concentrations of SFj, 
CHCIF,. and COF2, we included intervals to retrieve the 
concentrations of CH4, N^O, and CO,. These additional 
gases were included in the analysis because of uncertainties 
in the instrument pointing angle (about ±0.07° which corre- 
sponds to about ±0.5 km in the tangent height, 1 sigma). 
Following the procedures used to analyze the ATMOS 
observations (see, for example. Zander et al. [1987]), the

tangent altitudes of the individual spectra were adjusted until 
the retrieved volume mixing ratios (VMRs) of CH4, N.O, 
and CO-, were consistent with measurements in the lower 
stratosphere. 

Ideally, we would have preferred to use Imes of N: and U2 
to retrieve the tangent heights of the spectra instead of CH4, 
N,0, and CO. lines because the VMRs of N. and O. are 
likely to be constant in the stratosphere to our measurement 
accuracy, whereas the VMRs of CH4. N.O. and CO, are 
probably increasing with time. These changes with time 
complicate the analysis of data sets from different epochs. 
The S branch lines of the N, electric quadrupole (l-O) 
vibration-rotation band, which are observable in atmo- 
spheric spectra near 2400 cm'' [e.g., Camy-Peyret et al., 
\9S\- Goldman et at., 1981a], are not included in the spectral 
regions covered by any of the four balloon flights. Numerous 
lines of the O2 electric quadrupole (1-0) vibration-rotation 
band have been identified in the 1500-1650 cm"' region of 
stratospheric spectra {Goldman et al., 1981a] and are seen m 
both the 1979 and 1989 balloon flights, but quantitative 
analysis of these features is hampered at present by the large 
uncertainty in the absolute values of the electric quadrupole 
intensities (about ±35%) [Reid et al., 1981; Rotliman and 
Goldman, 1981]. 

The assumed VMRs for CH4 and N.O were chosen on the 
basis of accurate measurements from the literature. For CH4 
we selected a reference value at ground level of 1.68 parts 
per million by volume (ppmv) for 1984.5, which corresponds 
to the results reported by Steele et al. [1987, Figure 6] for 
30°N latitude, and an annual increase of 15.2 pptv obtained 
by averaging the value of 17.5 pptv reported by Rasmussen 
end Khali! [1986, Table I] for 1975 to 1985 and the value of 
12.8 pptv reported by Steele et al. [1987] for May 1983 to 
April 1985. For N.O we selected the 1985.0 surface-level 
reference value of 307.3 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) 
measured in the pacific northwest United States and the 
mean annual increase of 1.04 ppbv determined from the 
pacific northwest United States measurements and south 
pole measurements between 1975 and 1985 [Rasmussen and 
Khalil, 1986, Table 1]. In the stratosphere we assumed the 
zonal mean northern hemisphere CH4 and N2O profiles (at 
~30°N) derived from the ATM0S/SL3 spectra [Gunson et 
al., 1990, Table 4a]. To account for the expected increases in 
the stratospheric concentrations of these gases with time, 
the ATMOS VMRs in each layer were scaled by the ratio of 
the calculated tropospheric abundance for the time of the 
balloon flight measurement to the calculated tropospheric 
abundance for the time of the ATM0S/SL3 flight. Because 
the stratospheric profiles of CH4 and N.O near 30°N show 
significant seasonal changes [Jones and Pyle, 1984] and the 
ATM0S/SL3 profiles show evidence for a "fold" in their 
vertical distributions between 30 and 40 km which is proba- 
bly the result of dynamical motions [Gunson et al., 1990], 
CH4 and N2O features were only used to retrieve the tangent 
heights of scans within ~5 km of the tropopause. where the 
lower stratospheric VMRs are very close to those in the 
troposphere [e.g., Goldan et al., 1980, Figure 17]. The 1986 
HITRAN compilation parameters for CH4 were replaced 
with improved values determined from recent analysis of 
high-resolution laboratory spectra [Bro^m et al., 1989; 
Champion et al., 1989a, b] 

All of the retrieved ATMOS profiles from the SL3 spectra 
are based on an assumed CO, VMR of 330 ppmv below 70 



km altitude [Gunson et al., 1990]. For consistency with the 
ATMOS observations we assumed this profile for the time of 
the SL3 observations and scaled it in accordance with the 
mean measured rate of increase of 1.42 ppmv yr"' observed 
at Mauna Loa Observatory between 1974 and 1985 [Thonmg 
etal 1989] In addition to the updated CH4 hne parameters 
[Brown et al., 1989; Champion et al., 1989a, b], the line list 
used in fitting the CO, microwindow regions included O3 
line parameters generated from recent high-resolution labo- 
ratory studies [Malathy Devi et al., 1987; Rinsland et al., 
1988a; Flaud et al., 1989; Camy-Peyret et al., 1990]. As 
noted in Table 3, Oj lines are observable in a number of the 
microwindow regions. For gases such as O3 we assumed 
reference profiles appropriate to mid-latitude northern hemi- 
sphere conditions [e.g.. Smith, 1982]. 

The precision of the tangent heights, about ±0.2 km (1 
Sigma), has been estimated from the scatter in the vanous 
determinations for each spectnim. There were no obvious 
differences in the tangent heights estimated from the vanous 
gases or different spectral regions. For a well-mixed gas in 
the lower stratosphere a 0.2 km change in tangent height is 
equivalent to change of about 3% in the VMR [Gunson et al. , 
1990] Systematic errors in the tangent heights are likely to 
result mostly from uncertainties in the assumed volume 
mixing ratio profiles of CH4, N,0, and COj, the assumed 
spectroscopic line parameters (primarily caused by en-ors in 
the line intensities), and the assumed pressure-temperature 
profiles. En-or budget calculations, similar to those per- 
fonned previously [Rinsland et al., 1983], indicate a tota^ 
estimated error of -0.5 km (1 sigma) in the individual 
tangent heights from the sum of these effects. The tangent 
heights of 'he spectra used in the retrievals are as follows: 
17 9 19 1 and 21.7 km, October 10, 1979, flight; 12.4 and 
14.3'km, March 23. 1981, flight; 13.8, 14.5, 15.3. and 16.3 
km, June 6, 1988. flight; and 19.0, 19.9, 21.1, 22.1, and 22.6 
km. April 19, 1989, flight. 



3.1. 5F« 

Analysis of SF^ is based on retrievals of the 945.0-949.0 
cm"' interval which contains the Q branch of the intense vj 
band of SFfc at 947.94 cm"'. This feature, which was 
recently identified in the ATMOS/SL3 spectra [Rinsland et 
al 1990], is observable in both the 1981 and 1988 University 
of Denver balloon flight spectra of the lower stratosphere 
and upper troposphere. 

In this investigation we assumed the same line parameters 
as adopted in the ATMOS analysis [Rinsland et al., 1990]. 
The primary modifications to the 1986 HITRAN compilation 
[Rothman et al., 1987] are the addition of SF^ line Parame- 
ters with positions and relative intensities for the vj band 
[Bobin et al., 1987], normalized to the band intensity of 
Schatz and Hornig [1953], and SF^ air-broadened half 
widths calculated by Tejy.-ani and Fox [1987]. The ozone 
lines on the 1986 HITRAN compilation [Rothman et al., 
1987] were replaced with a line list derived from analysis of 
laboratory spectra recorded with the McMath Fourier trans- 
form spectrometer on Kitt Peak [Flaud et al., 1990]. Analy- 
sis of the ATMOS observations indicated a constant SFj 
VMR of 1 4-' ± 0.37 pptv (1 sigma) between 12 and 18 km 
and a possible decrease in the SF^ VMR between 18 and 22 
km. The evidence for the decline was not conclusive because 
of the weakness of the SFg absorption.

by fitting the data' for COi'and H^O (no SFj lines in the analysis), 
and (d) a simulation of the absorption by SF^ only computed for the 
same atmospheric path and the retrieved SF^ atmospheric amount. 
The residuals in Figures 16 and \c (measured minus calculated 
values) and the calculated SF^ absorption spectrum (Figure \d) are 
plotted on the same venical scale, which has been expanded relative 
to the vertical scale of Figure \a for clarity. The absorption peaks of 
the SFs v-i and v-^ + Vf,- Vf,Q branches are located near 947.94 and 
946.83 cm"', respectively. The spectral data were recorded at 
sunset from a float altitude of 33.5 km and at an astronomical zenith 
of 94.92°. The corresponding refracted tangent height is 12.4 km. 



As illustrated in Figure 1, SFg absorption is weak in the 
1981 spectra owing to its extremely low atmospheric abun- 
dance, but the Q branch feature is detectable above the noise 
level of the data. From bottom to top the panels show 
(Figure la) an observed spectrum in the SF^ Q branch region 
at a tangent height of 12.4 km; (Figure \b) the residuals 
(observed minus calculated intensities) obtained by fitting 
the data for SF^, CO,, and H^O; (Figure \c) the residuals 
obtained by fitting the spectrum for COi and HiO without 
SFs lines in the analysis; and (Figure \d) the calculated 
absorption by SF^ alone based on the SF^ column amount 
retrieved from the spectrum. The standard deviation of the 
residuals with SF^ lines in the analysis is about one-half that 
achieved without SF^ lines. The maximum SF5 absorption in 
this example (~37c) is less than derived at the same tangent 
height from both the 1985 ATMOS observations (see Figure 
■Xb of Rinslcind el al., [1990] for a sample fit) and the 1988 
balloon flight spectra (not shown), indicating a significant 
increase in the VMR of this gas in the lower stratosphere. 

Relative to the ATMOS results, the analysis indicates SF5 
multiplicative scale factors of 0.82 ± 0.15 for the March 1981

The error limits indicate the estimated precisions (1 sigma) 
which were calculated by taking the standard deviation of 
the SF5 scale factors retrieved from the individual spectra. 
The scale factors correspond to SF^ VMRs in the 12-18 km 
altitude region of 1.17 ± 0.21 and 2.02 ± 0.20 pptv, respec- 
tively. The absolute uncertainties are, of course, larger. 
Considering the various sources of random error (for exam- 
ple, finite signal-to-noise ratio) and systematic error (for 
example, the uncertainty in the SFj line intensities and 
air-broadened half widths, uncertainty in the calculation of 
the interfering absorption lines near the SFj Q branch, 
uncertainty in the derivation of the tangent heights due to 
CH4 and N2O line parameter errors, retrieval algorithm 
uncertainties, errors in the assumed pressure-temperature 
profiles, and instrument distortions such as zero level shift 
and phase errors), the estimated absolute 1-sigma error 
limits are about ±45% and ±25% for the 1981 and 1988 flight 
data, respectively. The important sources of systematic 
error (such as the errors in the assumed line intensities) bias 
all the retrievals by the same relative amount so that the 
derived long-term trend is unchanged. The same is also true 
for the CHCIF2 and COF, analyses. 

The mean SF^ volume mixing ratios below 18 km derived 
from the balloon-borne spectra and the ATMOS spectra 
[Rinsland et al.. 1990] are plotted versus observation date in 
Figure 2. The dashed line shows the trend computed from a 
least squares fit to the three observations assuming that the 
SFj VMR is increasing at an exponential rate with time, that 
is. C = Co exp [PU - to)], where Q is the concentration at 
time fo. C is the concentration at time t. and /3 is the rate of 
increase. Assuming this equation, a fit to the results indi- 
cates an average SF^ increase rate between March 1981 and 
June 1988 of 7.4 ± 1.9% year"' (1 sigma) which corresponds 
to a factor of 1.71 increase in the SFj, VMR. If a linear 
increase in the SF^ volume-mixing ratio with time is as- 
sumed, a slightly poorer fit to the measurements is obtained, 
but the difference is not significant given the estimated 
precision ofthe data. The measured mean 7.4 ± 1.9% year

(I Sigma) increase rate is less than the AER one-dimensional 
model calculated rate of 10.3% year'' over the 1981 to 1988 
period on the basis of known emission data. Work is m 
progress on estimating the magnitudes of other sources and 
the sinks of atmospheric SF^ (M. K. W. Ko et al., manu- 
script in preparation, 1990). 

The present results can be compared with SF^ trends 
measured at the surface [Rasmussen and Khalil, 1983] and m 
the stratosphere [Leifer et al., 1982; Leifer and Juzdan 
1985] and the atmospheric trend inferred from the depth 
profile of dissolved SF, in the northeast Atlantic ocean 
[Watson and Liddicoat, 1985]. Rasmussen and Khalil 11983] 
analyzed surface level electron-capture gas chromatography 
measurements of SF, obtained between 1979 and 1983 and 
derived annual exponential increase rates of 12.9 ± 2.6% at 
the south pole and 8.6 ± 2.3% in the pacific northwest and a 
global average annual rate of 10.5 ± 2.4% (± values are the 
quoted 90% confidence limits). The trend denved from the 
IR data is slightly less than these results, but the IR and 
pacific northwest trends overiap within the error limits. The 
IR results agree very well with the trend and mixing ratios 
reported by Watson and Liddicoat [1985]. Their best fit to 
their data was obtained with a linear increase with time, C - 
34 + 0.084 (Yr - 1970), where Yr is the calendar year and 
C is the inferred SF^ atmospheric mixing ratio in pptv. 
Values computed with this formula and the corresponding 
measured IR mixing ratios are 1 .28 and 1 . 17 pptv for the 198 1 
balloon flight, 1.63 and 1.42 pptv for the ATM0S/SL3 
mission, and 1.89 and 2.02 pptv for the 1988 balloon flight, 
respectively. On the basis of electron capture gas chromato- 
graphic analysis of air samples, Leifer et al. [1982] estimated 
that the mean northern hemisphere stratospheric concentra- 
tion of SFs increased by 61 ± 20% between 1974 and 1979. 
Analysis of additional SFg measurements firom the san^ 
program yielded an estimated linear increase rate of 21% 
year"' between April 1974 and November 1983, correspond- 
ing to an increase from 0.16 to 0.48 pptv [Leifer and Juzdan^ 
1985]. On a compound basis this increase is equal to 12% 
year"' which agrees very well with a model calculated 
increase rate of 14% year'' over the decade 1973-1983 (M. 
K W Ko et al., manuscript in preparation, 1990). The 
smaller rate of increase (-7.4% year ') between 1981 and 
1988 derived from the infrared data suggests a dechne in the 
percent rate of SFs atmospheric accumulation. As noted 
previously [Watson and Liddicoat, 1985; Rinsland et al., 
1990], there appears to be a problem with the calibration of 
at least some of the reported SFj measurements. Our VMRs 
and those of Watson and Liddicoat [1985] are significantly 
higher than corresponding values reported by Rasmussen el 
al [1981], Rasmussen and Khalil [1983], Leifer et al. [1981, 
1982], Leifer and Juzdan [1985], Singh et al. [1977, 1979. 
1983], and Krey et al. [1977]. 

3.2. CHCIF2 (CFC-22) 

Retrievals of CHClFj are based on the narrow, intense 
absorption feature at 829.05 cm'', which was used for the 
first spectroscopic detection of CHCIF, in the lower strato- 
sphere [Goldman et al., l9Slb]. On the basis of an extensive 
analysis of the infrared bands of gas phase CHCIF,, this 
feature has been assigned to the Q branch of li'i band of 
CH^^CIF, [Brown et al., 1988]. According to this work, the 
enhanced'intensity of the 829.05-cm-' Q branch results from 



the Fermi resonance with the nearby strong v^ fundamental. 
The rotational structure of the 2i'6 band has not been 
analyzed The 829.05-cm-' Q branch feature is anomalously 
narrow even at 0.002-cm-' resolution, its width has been 
reported to be essentially instrument limited [Magill et al., 
1986] Unpublished low-pressure laboratory spectra re- 
corded at the University of Denver show the Q branch 
feature narrower at 0.002-cm "' resolution than at 0.02-cm 
resolution and without recordable fine structure. However, 
the measured Q branch width is 0.013 cm"' full width halt 
maximum absorption (FWHM) in a 0.002-cm-' resolution 
University of Denver spectrum recorded with 0.31 torr ot 
CHCIF, in a 5-cm-long absorption cell, indicating that the 
feature 'is significantly broader than the imerferon^eter in- 
strument function. The peak absorption by the CH CIF2 
Iv.Q branch is 30% in this spectrum so that the observed 
broadening is unlikely to be due to saturation effects 

As in previous studies [Zander et al., 1987; Rinsland et 
al 1988^ 1989], empirical CHCIF, line parameters were 
used to model the unresolved rotational structure of the 
CH"C1F2 21-6 band Q branch. We modified the previous sets 
of parameters based on new 0.03-cm-' resolution laboratory 
measurements recorded at six temperatures between 203 and 
293 K Details of the laboratory investigation and a descnp- 
tion of the spectra have been reported by McDamel et al. 
[1990] The measured cross sections are believed to be 
accurate to 10% or better. A recently reported room temper- 
ature measurement of the integrated intensity of the \2-m 
CHCIF, bands [Varanasi and Chudamani, 1988] is within 
5% of the corresponding value derived from the McDamel et 
al [1990] spectra, in agreement with this error estimate. 
Becau^' the CH^CIF, Q branch feature is unresolved in the 
McDaniel et al. tl990"] laboratory spectra and their cross- 
section measurements do not property take into the account 
the effects of pressure broadening, the selection of the 
CH"C1F2 Q branch parameters was also guided by fittmgs 
to higher-resolution measurements, the 0.003- and -0.02- 
cm-' resolution University of Denver stratosphenc soar 
spectra and -0.005-cm-' resolution ground-based solar 
spectra recorded from Kitt Peak over a range of zenith 
angles [Rinsland et al., 1989]. The shape of the modeled 2 
branch is essentially the same as adopted previously, but the 
integrated Q branch intensity at room temperature obtmiwd 
from the new laboratory measurements is lower by -20%. 
Also the peak CHCIF, cross section in the new laboratory 
measurements increases only by a factor of 1.13 as the 
temperature is lowered from 293 to 203 K. a s.gmficanUy 
smaller increase than is predicted with the earlier data. The 
combination of these effects produces line intensities at 
lower stratospheric temperatures that are -30% lower than 
assumed in the past [Zander et al., 1987; Rinsland et al., 
19886 1989], and therefore the retrieved CHCIF, VMRs are 
higher by the same amount. In both the laboratory and 
atmospheric analyses the vibrational partition function of 
CHCIF, was calculated as a function of temperature assum- 
ing the'harmonic osciUator approximation and the revised 
assignments and fundamental frequencies reported by 
Brown et al. [1988]. The assignments and fundamental 
frequencies of Plyler and Benedict [1951] were assumed in 
the previous studies [Zander et al., 1987; Rinsland et al, 
1988fc. 1989]. Over the range of atmospheric temperature 
(-200-300 K). this change introduces a difference in the 
calculated temperature correction to the CHCIF, line inten-

Fig. 3. Example of a least squares fit to a 0.003-cm"' resolution 
stratospheric solar occultation spectrum (June 6, 1988, balloon 
flight) in the region of the unresolved Q branch of 2k6 band of 
CH^ClFj at 829.051 cm"'. The spectral data were recorded at 
sunset from a float altitude of 36.5 km and at an astronomical zenith 
of 94.60° during the June 6, 1988, balloon flight. The corresponding 
refracted tangent height is 17.1 km. The residuals (measured minus

vertical scale. 



sities of <0.4%. The 1986 HITRAN ozone line parameters in 
this region were replaced with improved values determined 
in a recent analysis [Pickett et al., 1988]. 

The stratospheric spectra were analyzed over the 828.82- 
830.00 cm'' interval with the VMRs of both CHCIF2 and O3 
included as free parameters in the retrievals. First, the 
0.003-cm "' resolution spectra recorded during the June 1988 
balloon flight were fitted over this interval to verify the 
quality of the line parameters at the highest recorded reso- 
lution. Figure 3 illustrates the results obtained from analysis 
of a spectrum recorded at a tangent height of 17.1 km. As can 
be seen, the residuals are close to the noise level of the data 
(the location of the CH^ClFj Q branch is marked). The 
lower altitude 0.025-cm"' resolution scans from the 1988 
flight and the 0.02-cm"' resolution scans from the 1981 flight 
were then fitted. The ATM0S/SL3 zonal average spectra at 
3rN latitude were also reanalyzed for CHCIF2 and com- 
pared with the retrievals reported previously [Zander et al., 
1987]; the agreement between the observed and best fit 
spectra and the retrieved vertical profile shape are very 
similar to the earlier results, but the absolute CHCIF2 VMRs 
are -30% higher than obtained with the previous set of line 
parameters (for example, the retrieved mean CHCIF2 VMR 
below 15 km increased from 55 to 70 pptv). In the final 
analysis, all of the results have been expressed relative to the 
reported ATMOS vertical VMR distribution [Zander et al., 
1987] scaled by 1.28 to account for the efiFect of the changes 
in the CHCIF2 line parameters. 

Figure 4 shows the measured and AER one-dimensional 
model calculated CHCIF, VMRs plotted versus time. In the

the CHCIF2 VMR has been assumed to be constant. The 
dashed line is a fit to the measurements assuming an expo- 
nential rate of increase in the VMR during this time period. 
This curve corresponds to an average CHCIF2 exponential 
increase rate of 9.4 ± 1.3% year"' (1 sigma) which equals a 
CHCIF2 VMR increase of a factor of 1.97 between March 
198 1 and June 1988. As for SFj, a model that assumes a 
linear increase in the volume mixing ratio with time yields a 
slightly poorer fit than the exponential increase model, but 
the results from both are within the estimated precisions of 
the measurements. The AER one-dimensional model VMRs, 
which are on average 0.72 times the measurements, corre- 
spond to a calculated CHCIF2 increase rate of 8.2% year"', 
slightly lower than the measured IR trend. The calculated 
global increase rate of 10.8% year"' on October I, 1984, 
reported by Golombek and Prinn [1989, Table 2] based on 
calculations with a global three-dimensional atmospheric 
circulation and chemistry model, is slightly higher than our 
measured IR trend. The secular increase in CHCIF2 is 
illustrated in Figure 5 where the absorption by CHCIF2 is 
compared in nearly equal air mass spectra from the 1981 and 
1988 balloon flights. 

Measured CHCIF, trends have been reported previously 
by a number of investigators [Fabian, 1986; Fabian et al., 
1989; Khalil and Rasmussen, 1981, 1987; Rasmussen and 
Khalil, 1982, 1983; Watson et al., 1988, Table C-8.1; Rins- 
land et al., 1989]. As summarized by Rinsland et al. (1989], 
the reported ground-based studies indicate CHCIF, increase 
rates of 10-13% year"' before 1983, followed by a recent 
slowdown in the percent rate of CHCIF, increase (for 
example, 7.1% year"' at Cape Grim, Tasmania, 41°S lati- 
tude, for 1986 [Watson et al., 1988]). The only previously 
reported trend based on stratospheric observations [Fabian 
et al., 1989] yields a slightly higher rate of increase, ~I0% 
year"' for the 1982-1987 period. The rate of increase de- 
rived in the present study is somewhat less than the strato- 
spheric rate of Fabian el al. [1989] but more than determi-

nations of the recent trend infrared from surface-level 
sampling [Khalil and Rasmussen, mi; Watson et al., 1988. 
Table C-8.1]. The trend determined here from the strato- 
spheric infrared observations is also slightly higher than the 
trend of 7.8 ± 1.0% year"' (2 sigma) inferred from total 
column measurements derived from ground-based infrared 
spectra recorded between December 1980 and May 1988 
from Kitt Peak (31.9°N latitude) [Rinsland et al., 1989]. 

A discrepancy between the infrared and air-samplmg 
VMR measurements of CHCIF2 was noted recemly [Rins- 
land et al., 1988ft, 1989]. The magnitude of the difference 
was estimated as -30-40% with the infrared results system- 
atically lower than the in situ data. Analysis with the new 
CHCIF2 absorption cross-section measurements [McDaniel 
et al., 1*990] increases the retrieved infrared CHCIF, VMRs 
by -30%, so that the results of both techniques are now in 
much better agreement. Predicted atmospheric burdens de- 
rived from estimated industrial emissions appear to be lower 
than in situ measurements [Rasmussen et al., 1980; Khahl 
and Rasmussen, 1981; Wuebbles, 1983; Fabian, 1986; Fa- 
bian et al., 1989] except for the recent model calculations by 
Golomhek and Prinn [1989] who used the production data 
published by the World Meteorological Organization [1986]. 
Obviously, reliable estimates of industrial emissions are 
needed to ascertain whether there is a discrepancy between 
models and observations. The correction to the IR measure- 
ments of CHCIF, is also important because the absolute 
calibrations of CHCIF, and methychloroform (CH3CCI3) 
have been identified as important for the determination of 
average tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations 
[International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Programme, 
1989]. 

3.3. COF2 

Three bands of COF,, the t^e at 774 cm"', the 1/4 at 1243 
cm-', and the i', at 1944 cm'', have been identified in 



The absolute accuracies of COF, retrievals are signifi- 
cantly limited by the uncertainties in the COF, line param- 
eters At the time of the first detection of COFj. no line-by- 
line parameters were available for any of the three 
observable bands. Preliminary profiles derived froni mea- 
surements of the equivalent width of the v, band Q branch 
and spectral fits to several manifolds of the v, band near 1938 
cm-' using empirical COF, parameters were shown to differ 
by as much as a factor of 1.5 [Rinsland et al., 1986]. Since 
then the Vf, band has been analyzed [Thakur et al., 1987, 
Goldman et al., 1990] and preliminary line-by-lme parame- 
ters have been generated for both the .4 and ., regions (see 
Goldman et al. [1989ft] and Brown and Cohen [1989] for 
descriptions of the parameters for the .4 and .'i regions 
respectively), but difficulties remain because of the effects ot 
unmodeled perturbations in the ..4 and u, bands and incon- 
sistencies in the calibrations of the absolute intensities ina 1 
three COF, bands. As discussed by Goldman et al. [1990J, 
several chemical reactions are known to cause the decom- 
position of COF2 in laboratory samples, and impunties have 
often been reported. To minimize these error effects the 
COF2 trend reported in this paper has been denved from 
analysis of the vi band manifolds only. 

In the analysis of the v, region we used the preliminary 
COF, line parameters calculated for the Ferm. resonant i/, 
and 2., bands by Brown and Cohen [1989], provided to us as 
a private communication (1989). A mean COF^ air- 
broadened half width of 0.0896 cm"' atm"' at 296 K was 
calculated by averaging the six microwave N^-broademng 
measurements of Srivastava and Kumar [1976, Table 2]. 
This value was assumed for all COFj lines along with an 
arbitrary T-"''' half width temperature dependence. The 
vibration partition function for COF, was computed with the 
fundamental frequencies reported by Malbnson et «'• 11975J 
and the standard harmonic oscillator approximation. For O3 
we used the calculated line positions and intensities reported 
in a number of recent investigations [Malathy Dev^'a^-- 
1987- Rinsland et al., 1988a; Camy-Peyret et al., 1990] with 
O, air-broadened half widths computed using theernpincal 
polynomial expression reported by Flaud et al. [1990]. Solar 
CO lines were simulated as described by Rinsland et al. 
11982] using the Minnaert formula. 

Simulations with the new O3 line parameters indicate that 
O3 is an important interfered gas in the COF, ..band 
reeion. Ozone features with central depths of up to 3% are 
pr;dicted between 1930 and 1955 cm"'. A number of these 
features have been identified in the balloonborne solar 
spectra. The strongest O3 lines in this region are from h^ 
3.3 - ., hot band, which has a band center at 1942_^9509

manifolds are contaminated by the O3 absorption, for exam- 
ple, the 1937.522-cm-' feature. Ozone laboratory spectra

recorded at 0.005-cm~' resolution with the McMath Fourier 
transform spectrometer on Kitt Peak clearly show this 
overlapping O3 line. The ATMOS compilation [Brown et al., 
1987], which was used in the previous analysis of COF,, did 
not contain any O3 lines between 1926.89 and 1945.42 cm"', 
so that the O3 interference efifects were not noticed in the 
earlier study of COF2 in the i-i band region [Rinsland et al., 
1986], 

The 1936.0-1940-cm"' region is the most favorable inter- 
val for quantitative analysis of the i/, band manifolds of 
COF2. The COF2 manifolds in this region are near the 
intensity maximum in the P branch of the i-, band. The 
strongest R branch manifolds, which occur near 1950 cm"', 
are more severely contaminated by O3 lines. Table 4 pre- 
sents an evaluation of the interference effects for each of the 
COF2 manifolds in the 1936-1940 cm"' interval. Although 
simulations indicate that none of these ■COF2 features are 
isolated from atmospheric and solar interferences at the 
resolution of the present measurements, the manifolds at 
1936.259, 1936.682, 1937.104, 1938.357, and 1939.187 cm"' 
are only slightly contaminated and are believed to be the 
most favorable COF2 features for quantitative analysis from 
our data sets. 

Derivation of the COF2 long-term trend from the balloon- 
borne spectra is complicated by four factors: (1) the inter- 
ference problem already mentioned, (2) the weakness of the 
COF2 features (at most 3% absorption), (3) the occurrence of 
complex, relatively strong (-5% of peak intensity) channel 
spectra in the 1979 flight data (and to a lesser extent in the 
1989 flight spectra, and (4) the limited signal-to-rms noise of 
the 1979 flight spectra (-100) as compared to the 1989 flight 
spectra (-200). These efifects can be seen in Figures 6 and 7 
which illustrate the flight data and the results of the least 
squares spectral fitting analysis. 

In the upper panel of Figure 6, 1979 and 1989 flight spectra 
recorded at tangent heights near 19.0 km are compared with 
a simulation generated without COF2 lines. Tick marks at 
top and beneath each spectrum indicate the locations of the 
five nearly unblended COF2 spectral features. All five are 
easily seen in the 1989 flight spectrum (bottom scan). The 
features at 1936.259, 1936.682, and 1937.104 cm"' appear to 
be present in the 1979 flight spectrum (middle scan), but the 
ones at 1938.357 and 1939.187 cm"' are not obvious. Two 
heavy arrows have been drawn beneath the 1979 flight

Tick marks at top and beneath each spectrum indicate the locations 
of five COFi manifolds with minimal blending. In Figure 5a are 
plotted a simulation generated without COFi lines for a tangent of 
19.0 km (top scan), a 1979 flight spectrum recorded at a tangent 
height of 19.1 km (middle scan), and a 1989 flight spectrum recorded 
at a tangent height of 19.0 km (bottom scan). Two arrows mark 
regions containing only weak lines; the effects of channeling and 
finite signal-to-noise (especially in the 1979 flight data) can be 
noticed by comparing the measured spectra and the simulation in 
these regions. In the lower panel the simulation without COF2 from 
the upper panel is repeated at top, the middle spectrum is a coadd of 
1979 flight spectra recorded at tangent heights of 17. 1 , 19. 1 , and 21 .7 
km, and the lower spectrum is the 1989 flight spectrum recorded at 
a tangent height of 19.0 km. The measured spectral intensities in the 
middle and bottom plots have been divided at each wave number by 
the calculated 100% transmittance level derived from a spectral least 
squares retrieval analysis of the data; this procedure has been doiie 
to remove the effects of channeling from the spectra. Two arrows in 
each panel mark regions with only relatively weak solar and 
atmospheric line absorption. The background in these intervals can 
be used to judge the spectral signal-to-noise and the distonion 
effects due to channeling. 



background and the limited signal-to-noise ratio of the 1979 
flight data can be noted by comparing the three spectra in 
this region. 

Some improvement in the visibility of the COF2 features 
can be achieved by correcting the background envelope for 
channeling efifects and coadding 1979 flight scans with similar

close to the noise level in the spectrum. 



zenith angles to itnprove the signal-to-noise. In the lower 
panel of Figure 6, reprocessed spectra from the 1979 and 
1989 flights are compared with the same spectral simulation 
as shown in the upper panel. Each measured spectrum has 
been divided by the calculated 100% transmission curve 
determined from the spectral least squares retrieval analysis 
of the data. Note that the background in the two regions 
indicated by heavy arrows is now nearly flat, as in the 
simulation. The channeling correction has preserved the fine 
spectral structure, as can be seen for example by companng 
the weak lines near 1936.9 cm"' in the 1979 flight spectrum 
with the features in the simulation. The 1979 flight spectrum 
was produced by coadding spectra recorded at tangent 
heights of 17.1, 19.1, and 21.7 km. The signal-lo-noise of the 
coadded spectrum is improved, although it is still less than 
the signal-to-noise of the 1989 flight spectriim at bottom. 
Except for the COFj feature at 1938.357 cm , the marked 
COF2 manifolds appear to be present in the coadded 1979 
flight'spectrum, but their absorption depths arc consistently 
less than measured in the 1989 flight data. Furthermore, 
recall that the resolution of the 1979 flight spectra is a factor 
of -1.25 higher that the low-resolution spectra from the 1989 
flight, so that features of a given absorption strength should 
appear narrower and deeper in the 1979 data than in the 1989 
data. On the basis of these considerations, the balloon flight 
measurements indicate a substantial increase in the amount 
of COF-. in the lower stratosphere between 1979 and 1989. 
As for SFs and CHCIF,, the COF, retrievals were refer- 
enced to an appropriate ATM0S/SL3 profile. First, the 
ATMOS analysis was checked by retrieving a COF, profile 
from the ATMOS zonal average sunset spectra (30°N lati-

tude) using the new set of line parameters and comparing the 
retrieved profile with the published profile denved from the 
same spectral region [Rinsland et al., 1986, Figure 3, heavy 
fuU li"e] The two profiles agree within 5% below an altifjde 
of 38 km. Then, assuming the published ATMOS vertical 
VMR distribution (Table 2), each balloon flight spectrum 
was analyzed to retrieve a single multiplicative COF2 profile 
scaling factor. The gas amounts of CO2 and NO were also 
fitted along with parameters to model the solar CO absorp- 
tion lines, the background, channel spectra, and the effective 
instrument line shape. The COFj scale factors from the three 
analyzed spectra from the 1979 flight (tangent heights of 
17 1 19.1, and 21.7 km) were averaged and the standard 
deviktion was computed to derive a scale factor of 0.44 ± 
17 (1 Sigma). The same procedure was used to analyze the 
1989 flight spectra. A COF, scale factor of 1.21 ± 0.24 (1 
Sigma) was derived from fitting five spectra with tangent 
heights between 19.0 and 22.6 km. Figure 7 presents an 
example of the least-squares fitting results obtained from the 
1989 flight spectra. 

Figure 8 shows the measured and AER one-dimensional 
model calculated COF, plotted versus time. The dashed line 
is a fit to the measurements assuming that the concentrations 
of COF, are increasing at an exponential rate. The fitted 
curve co'rresponds to an average COF, increase rate of 10^3 
± 1 8% year"' (1 sigma) which is equal to a factor of 2.6/ 
increase over the 9.5-year period (October 1979 to Apnl 
1989). Referenced to a base altitude of 18.0 km, the fitted 
curve corresponds to an increase in the COF, total vertica^l 
column from 0.43 x lO'* to 1.20 x lO'^ molecules cm - 
over the observation period. The measured increase rate 
10 3 ± I 8% year-' (1 sigma) is slightly higher than the AER 
one-dimensional model calculated rate of 8.3% year for 
the same time interval. No other measured or model calcu- 
lated COF, trends have been reported.

by the National Solar Observatory on Kitt Peak near Tucson, 
Arizona. The upper panel shows the vi band manifold at 1936.259 
cm"' in a spectrum recorded at a mean solar astronomical zenith 
angle of 83.20° on the afternoon of November 29, 1988 (bottom 
curve), and simulations generated for the same spectral resolution 
and atmospheric ray path (upper two curves). The simulation are 
calculations of COFj absorption only (top spectrum) and the ab- 
sorption by all gases except COFi (middle spectrum). The tick mark 
beneath the measured spectrum marks the location of the COFi 
absorption peak as determined from the spectrum at top. The three 
spectra are offset vertically for clarity. The lower panel presents a 
simulation of the absorption by all gases except COFi (upper curve) 
and a Kitt Peak solar spectrum recorded at a mean solar astronom- 
ical zenith angle of 75.46° on the morning of December 1, 1988 
(lower curve). The two spectra are offset vertically for clarity. Solid 
triangles beneath the measured spectrum indicate the positions of 
strong COF2 absorption features determined from line center mea- 
surements on a 0.0O3-cm"' resolution laboratory spectrum of 
COF2. The strong features at 1234.226 and 1234.315 cm" are 
"CH4 and "0'^C"0 lines, respectively. Weak lines of O3 and 
N2O have also been identified in this spectral region. 



In the future it should be possible to derive the trend in the 
COF2 total column from analysis of high-resolution ground- 
based solar spectra. As illustrated in Figure 9, the strong 
COF2 V] and i'4 band features can be seen from Kitt Peak, 
but they appear as very weak absorptions. High air mass, 
high signal-to-noise measurements at resolutions greater 
than 0.01 cm"' are required. Care must also be taken to 
avoid interferences, especially O3 lines, which are visible in 
both spectral regions as narrow features, very similar in 
appearance to the COFt absorptions. Because atmospheric 
transmission in the COF, v\ band region is strongly attenu- 
ated by tropospheric water vapor absorption, any long-term, 
ground-based COF2 measurement program based on mea- 
surements of the f 1 band manifolds will require observations 
from dry, high-altitude sites. Observations such as the one 
illustrated in the upper panel of Figure 9 are seldom possible 
from Kitt Peak at an altitude of 2.1 km. At present, too few 
high-quality atmospheric observations of the COF2 I'l band 
manifolds have been recorded from Kitt Peak to measure a 
reliable long-term COF^ trend. Observations in the Vi band 
region are potentially more useful since regions less affected 



by H-,0 can be selected, but accurate COFj total column 
measilrements are not currently possible because of the 
absence of COFj line parameters in the 1230-1235 cm" 
region which is the best for ground-based remote sensing. 
The COFi fi and v^ band features have also been identified 
in high-resolution solar spectra recorded from the Jungfrau- 
joch station at an altitude of 3.58 km (R. Zander, private 
communication, 1990). 

4. SUMM.\RY AND CONCLUSIONS 

Long-term trends in the lower stratospheric concentra- 
tions of three trace constituents have been derived from 
analysis of high resolution infrared solar occulation spectra 
recorded between 1979 and 1989. The derived average rates 
of increase are large, 7.4% ± 1.9% year"' for SFft, 9.4% ± 
1.3% year"' for CHCIF2, and 10.3 ± 1.8% year ' for COF2 
(1 sigma), and in reasonable agreement with model results. 
The observed increases illustrate the rapid changes that are 
taking place in the composition of our upper atmosphere. 
The derived trends of SFg and CHClFj are in generally good 
agreement with the limited number of previously reported 
stratospheric trend measurements. The COF, trend mea- 
surements and model calculations are the first such results 
reported for this molecule. Both SFj and CHClFj are 
expected to be well mixed in the upper troposphere and 
lower stratosphere and thus will exhibit little seasonal or 
spatial variation. There are, however, significant variations 
in our calculated model distributions ofCOFj. Hence more 
frequent measurements are needed to further quantify its 
temporal trend. 

Over the decade of these observations, the IR absorptions 
of SFfi and COF2 increased from only slightly above the limit 
of detection to features that are readily observable (for 
example, Figures 5 and 6). For this reason, these gases were 
only recently identified. On the basis of these studies it was 
then possible to identify and quantitatively analyze these 
features in the eariier data sets. In the future, as other gases 
increase in abundance as the result of anthropogenic emis- 
sions, similar cases will occur so that these eariy IR data sets 
are likely to provide valuable information on the trends of 
molecules not yet readily observable. Comparisons of time 
series of spectra in the 8-13 /xm atmospheric window may 
also be useful in accessing of changes in the opacity of this 
climatically important spectral region. 

As demonstrated by this investigation, the systematic 
analysis of a time series of infrared solar occultation spectra 
can yield significant new information about the trends of 
stratospheric gases. The data are precise since no absolute 
radiance calibration is required, and temperature uncertain- 
ties and the attenuation by broad features (for example, 
aerosols and continua) are unimportant if appropriate fea- 
tures are selected for analysis. However, it is important to 
use consistent retrieval methods and consistent spectro- 
scopic linelists to minimize systematic error effects. Because 
of the sensitivity and broad spectral coverage capabilities of 
high-resolution solar occultation measurements, many spe- 
cies encompassing a wide range in concentration are re- 
corded simultaneously so that a comprehensive analysis of 
chemical families in such data sets can provide a unique 
opportunity to study the time history of the chemistry 
related to the catalytic destruction of stratospheric ozone.

Abstract. Total reactive nitrogen (NOy) between 15 
and 29 km was measured for the first time on board a 
balloon within the Arctic cold vortex. Observations of 
HNO3, aerosol, and ozone were made by instruments on 
the same balloon gondola which was launched from Es- 
range, Sweden (68°N, 20°E) on January 23, 1989. The 
NOy mixing ratio was observed to increase very rapidly 
from 6 ppbv at 18 km altitude to a maximum of 21 ppbv 
at 21 km, forming a sharp layer with a thickness of about 
2 km. A minimum in the NOy mixing ratio of 5 ppbv was 
found at 27 km. The measured HNO3 profile shows broad 
similarities to that of NOy. This observation, together 
with the observed very low column amount of NO2, shows 
that NOi had been almost totally converted to HNO3, 
and that NOy was composed mainly of HNO3. The en- 
hanced aerosol concentration between 19 and 22 km sug- 
gests that the maximum abundance of HNO3 trapped m 
the form of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) was about 6 ppbv 
at 21 km. The sampled air parcels were highly supersat- 
urated with respect to NAT. Although extensive denitri- 
fication throughout tlie stratosphere did not prevail, an 
indication of denitrification was found at altitudes of 27 
and 22 km, and between 18 and 15 km. 

Introduction 

Total reactive odd nitrogen defined as NOy = NO + 
NO2 + NO3 + HNO3 + 2(N20s) + HO2NO2 + CIONO2 
+ aerosol nitrate, plays an important role in the chem- 
istry of the winter polar stratosphere. HNO3, in combi- 
nation with H2O, forms aerosols composed of nitric acid 
trihydrate (NAT) at temperatures higher than that re- 
quired for water ice particle formation. These aerosols 
can provide sites for heterogeneous reactions, one of which 
converts HCI and chlorine nitrate (CIONO2, a tempo- 
rary reservoir of CIO) into reactive chlorine molecules and 
HNO3 [e.g. Solomon et ai, 1986; McElroy et al., 1986|. In

bulk these H2O and NAT aerosols are referred to as polar 
stratospheric clouds (PSCs). If aerosols grow to a suffi- 
ciently large size, gravitational settling can occur, leading 
to denitrification in the stratosphere. These processes are 
considered to be essential for the large ozone depletion in 
the Antarctic stratosphere in spring. 

Significant reduction of NOy within the polar vortex 
has been observed at an altitude of about 20 km in the 
Antarctic stratosphere during early spring [Fahey et al., 
1989a]. In addition, significant amounts of aerosols con- 
taining HNO3 have been sampled at temperatures above 
the H2O frost point [Fahey et al., 1989b|. By contrast, 
much less is understood about heterogeneous processes 
occuring in the winter Arctic stratosphere. To investi- 
gate heterogeneous processes in that region, instrumented 
balloons were flown from the Arctic in late January, 1989 
as a part of the TECHNOPS campaign organized by the 
Centre National d'Etude Spatiale (ONES). Parameters 
which were measured for this purpose included reactive 
odd nitrogen, NOy between 15 and 29 km, nitric acid, 
and aerosols. 

Instrumentation 
The balloon-borne NOy instrument is based on the 
principle of the conversion of NOy species into NO on 
a heated gold surface and the subsequent measurement of 
NO by a chemiluminescence detector. A detailed descrip- 
tion of the instrument is given in Kendo et al. [1989|. 
For the present experiment, a converter with a diameter 
larger than that described in Kondo et al. [1989) was 
used to increase the sensitivity. The converter consisted 
of 19 gold tubes each of which was 30 cm long, with an 
inner diameter of 5.7 mm and a 0.15 mm wall thickness. 
They were assembled as a single unit and mounted m 
a stainless steel tube 50 cm long, with an inner diame- 
ter of 30.5 mm. The temperature of the gold converter 
was controlled to be 300 ±1°C. Laboratory experiments 
have shown an NO2 conversion efficiency as high as 0.98 
±0.02, even at 5 mb. Nitric acid in aerosols evaporates 
in the converter and is therefore measured as NOy [Fahey 
et al., 1985, 1989a]. As both the velocity of the sampled 
air through the converter and the ascent velocity of the 
balloon are a few m/s, no significant enhancement in the 
sensitivity of particulate NO, should occur. The accu- 
racy of the NOy measurements is estimated to be about 

Other instruments which were mounted on the same 
gondola were an infrared radiometer from the Univer- 
sity of Denver [Murcray et al., 1969|, an aerosol counter 
and an ECC ozonesonde from the University of Wyoming 
[Hofmann et al., 1989], and a chemiluminescent ozone in- 
strument from the Service d'Aeronomie [Aimedieu et al. 
1987]. The radiometer was designed for measurement of

eas phase HNO3. This was accomplished by measuring at 
two wavelengths, one at the peak of the gas phase emis- 
sion and the other outside of the region of gas phase emis- 
sion but in the region of broad band emission of ice phase 
HNO3 or other emitting aerosols. The HNO3 profile was 
determined by noting the change in the gas phase emis- 
sion with altitude. The accuracy of the HNO3 me«"f«- 
ment is about 15%. The aerosol detector was a high-now 
(200 cm^s-^ optical counter with a short (5 cm) inlet 
tube insulated from the rest of the scattering chamber to 
avoid particle evaporation. The accuracy of aerosol mass 
measurements for small (r « 0.2Mm) spherical particles is 

estimated to be about 15%. , , , » 

Ground based measurements were also conducted to 
support the balloon measurements: column NO2 and 
ozone amounts were continuously measured by the 1 bL 
DSIR and Nagoya University groups at the Swedish 
Institute of Space Physics Observatory in Kiruna, us- 
ing a zenith viewing visible spectrometer [Johnston and 
McKenzie, 19891. These measurements were made over 
the period from 12 January to 28 February, 1989 and will 
be reported more fully elsewhere. 

Results and discussion 
The gondola was flown suspended under a 10^ m bal- 
loon which was launched from Esrange near Kiruna, Swe- 
den (68°N, 20°E) at 1430 UT on January 23, 1989. The 
ozone and temperature profiles measured during ascent 
are shown in Figure 1. The altitude was scaled according 
to the hydrostatic equation using the observed tempera- 
ture The approximate potential temperature is given on 
the right hand side of the figure. It- can be seen that the 
temperature was less than or equal to -85°C between 20 
and 25 km. Between 22 and 26 km, a reduction of about 
25%, compared to typical values of the ozone profile, can 
be seen; the possible cause for this variation is discussed 
in Hofmann et al. (19893]. 



The NOv and HNO3 mixing ratios, also measured dur- 
ing ascent! are shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that 
the NO, mixing ratio increased very rapidly from 6 ppbv 
at 18 km altitude to a maximum of 21 ppbv at 21 km, 
and that the NO,, layer centered at 21 km was only 2 kni 
thick. A sharp minimum in the N0„ mixing ratio of 5 
ppbv at 27 km was also seen. Judging from the potential 
vorticity maps of January 23 and 24, it is very likely tha 
the present observation was made inside the vortex but 
close to the boundary. Aircraft data show that 2 to 5 in 
latitude poleward of the vortex boundary NO, reached a 
maximum at potential temperatures between 420 and 470 
K (Kawa et a/., this issue]. The present NO, profile corre- 
sponding to these potential temperatures falls withm the 
range of their NO, values observed a few degrees insure 
the polar vortex boundary. Our measured column NO, 
amount integrated from 14.6 to 29.3 km was 2.0 x 10

Kiruna on January 23, 1989. 

A pronounced layer of aerosol, having a mode radius 
of about 0.2Mm, was observed between 19 and 22 km, 
as described in detail in Hofmann .t <' • ! ^f^^ The 
HNO3 mixing ratio contained in aerosol (lHN03|p) was 
calculated assuming that all the aerosols were composed 
of NAT, and is shown as the solid line in Figure 2. In 
this calculation, the observed concentration of aerosols 
with radii from 0.2 to 5 ^Lm was used; however aerosol 
with radii smaller than l;.m dominated the total volume 
of HNO3. Below 18 km, aerosols are composed mainly 
of sulfate and it can be seen that the sulfate particles 
contributed little to the total volume m the PSC layer 
between 19 and 23 km, and thus caused little error in 
the estimate of lHN03]p. The peak lHN03]p of about 
6 ppbv was reached at 21 km. The ^■^^"^'j^.i P'f ^ °^

ABSTRACT 

Tunable diode laser heterodyne 
spectrophotometry (TDIHS) has been used to make 
extremely high resolution ( < 0.0005 cm~^ ) solar 
spectra in the 9.6 micron ozone band. 
Observations have shown that a signal-to-noise 
ratio of 95: 1 ( 35% of theoretical ) for an 
integration time of 1/8 second can be achieved at 
a resolution of . 0005 wavenumbers . The spectral 
data have been inverted to yield a total column 
amount of ozone, in good agreement with that 
measured at the nearby National Oceanographic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ozone 
monitoring facility in Boulder, Colorado.

INTRODUCTION 



Tunable Diode Laser Heterodyne Spectrosccpy 
(TDLHS ) has the ability to produce very high 
resolution atmospheric spectra. The concept of 
heterodyning and its applications to instruments 
for atmospheric measurement have been discussed 
previously by a number of authors , including 
Fu j ii et al . [ 1978 ] , Menzies et al . [ 1981 ] , 
Glenaretal. [ 1983 ], and Kostiuk andMumma 
[ 1983 ]. In particular, Frerking and Heuhlner 
[ 1977 ] have applied TDLHS to the study of 
atmospheric ozone, with a resolution of 
. 0067 cm"-*- and a signal-to-noise ratio of 40. At 
the University of Denver, the instrument described 
by Allario et al. , [1979, 1980] has recently 
produced spectra having a resolution of 
. 0005 cm~^ or better, at wavelengths in the region 
of the 9 . 6 /im ozone band. Some of these spectra 
have been inverted to provide column ozone 
amounts which were found to be in good agreement 
with values obtained at the National Oceanographic 
and Atmospheric Adiministration (NOAA). A 
number of the line positions have been compared 
to the Hitran database [ Rothman et al. , 1987 ] , 
with updated ozone lines [ Goldman andMurcray, 
1988 ] and in the majority of the cases the 
frequencies are found to match to better than

2 . INSTRUMENTATION 

The theory behind heterodyne detection is 
well known, and its application to the TDms has 
been discussed by McElroy et al. [ 1988 ]. The 
voltage signal-to-noise ratio S^ [Blaney, 1975 ] , 



can be arrived at by considering our 
photoconductor to be a square-law detector and if 
we consider the noise bandwidth of the output 
filter to be on the order of 1/t , where r is the 
post-detection integration time constant of the 
system. Therefore, 

IPs 



S„ =

) 



where rj is the quantum efficiency of the 
photoconductor, u is the photon frequency, Bjp is 
the bandwidth of the intermediate frequency, 
S = [ exp (h jykTB) - 1 ] ~^, where Tg is the black- 
body temperature of the source , and ^ = 1 for a 
thermal source that oonpletely fills the field-of- 
view. If values typical to this instrument and 
atmospheric spectroscopy are used, that is, 
r? = 0.38, Tb = 5500K, B];f = 3.1MHz, T = 0.125s, 
V = 3 • lO^-Miz, Ps = 2h»'5i3Bj;p, and we apply the 
quantum limit h>'» kTg, then Sy is approximately 
1200:1. Other losses such as chopper efficiency 
(50%) and losses due to the optics (45%) result in a 
final figure of approximately 260:1. 

The University of Denver TDLHS was 
constructed by the NASA research group in 
Langley , Virginia . The instrument concept was 
described by Allario etal. [ 1979, 1980]. During 
the past year of its life at the University of 
Denver, the instrument has been considerably 
modified resulting in a reduction in temperature 
tuning errors and a consequent improvement in 
wavelength stability. The optical arrangement is 
more or less unchanged , except for the eiddition of

instrument . Mirrors are indicated by the 
letter M, diffraction gratings by G, the| 
beamsplitter by BS and the lens by LI. ^ 



focussing capability at the detector, and is 
illustrated in Figure 1 . Solar radiation is directed 
into the instrument by means of a clock-driven 
mirror . The solar tracker directs the light to 
mirror Ml , which reflects it to an off-axis 
paraboloid M6 , which produces an image of the sun 
at the pin-hole located immediately before the 
chopper. The light exiting the pinhole is 
collimated by mirror M5, dispersed by grating Gl, 
and f ocussed onto the exit pinhole HI by mirror 
M4 . The light exiting HI is collimated by mirror 
M3 and directed towards the beamsplitter BS by 
mirror M2 . Light from the TDL local oscillator is 
collected by lens LI and it then falls on the 
"beamsplitter where it combines with the solar beam 
with phase matching . After the beamsplitter, the 
composite beam is f ocussed upon a high-speed 
mercury-cadmium-tellurixim ( HgCdTe ) photcmixer 
biased as a photoconductor. The heterodyne 
signal , vtiich contains the spectral information, is 
then separated from the DC component. The 
amplified RF signal is then bandpass filtered to set 
the desired instrumental resolution. Currently, 
there are 7 different bandpass options available. 
The highest resolution is derived from a channel 
having a bandpass that ranges from 1 to 4 . 1 MHz . 
After the bandpass filtering, the signal is sguare- 
law detected by a broadband RF detector ( . 1 to 1 
GHz ) and subsequently phase-sensitive detected 
using a dual slope integrator. The integrator is 
ramped up during the open cycle of the chopper, 
and then ramped down again during the closed 
cycle. The phase-sensitive detection process 
provides a large rejection ratio for sources of 
noise such as detector thermal noise and other 
background sources which are unmodulated. 

It should be noted, that the signal from the 
detector RF amplifier is proportional to the square 
root of the soleir intensity, or equivalently, to the 
solar field strength. After the signal is square-law 
detected, a signal which is proportional to the 
solar intensity as well as the local oscillator 
intensity results . This is the signal which is 
phase-sensitive detected and then recorded as 
spectral data.

SPECTRAL ANALYSIS 



The spectra are viewed and manipulated by 
means of software written for an IBM PC/XT. All 
of the spectra presented here have had a 3 point 
( FWHM ) triangular filter applied to them. A 
wavelength calibration is generated through the 
application of calculated dispersion coefficients. 
The dispersion coefficients are generally calculated 
by taking the current scan values for selected 
lines and then performing a linear or quadratic 
regression against line positions as determined for 
the Bomem DA3 interferometer [ Murcray et al. , 
1988 ] , which is currently demonstrating an 
unapodized resolution of 0. 002 an~^ . For a linear 
regression , this method generally provides 
agreement between the wavelength calibration of 
the spectra of the order of 10"^ cm"-"- . In all 
cases, only fairly narrow, well-defined lines vrere 
used in these regressions, raie of v*iidi is required 
for each current scan . It is necessary to provide 
^a wavelength scale in this manner, because a 
sufficiently accurate independent method has not

and 1005.25 cm"^ . The Bomem spectrum 
was taken on Oct. 21, 1987 at a zenith

been incorporated into the TDLHS as yet. 

The signal-to-noise ratios quoted here were 
calculated by determining the standard deviation of 
a number of points in a region where the spectral 
intensity appeared to be relatively constant. Ihis 
method could well yield a noise level greater than 
the actual one , but it is unlikely to yield one that 
is less . The theoritical signal-to-noise ratio for 
the 4 . 1 MHz channel is 260 : 1 , while the observed 
signal-to-noise ratio ceilculated by this method is 
95:1, or 35% of theoretical. 

TDLHS spectra have been compiled in 4 
regions. They are as follows: 996 - 997 cm"^,. 
1004.9 - 1005.3 cm"^, 1009.6 -1010.2 cm"-'-, 
1012.0- 1012.5 cm~^. The observed TDms spectra 
have been compared to the Hitran database, and to 
Bomem DA3 spectra taken during October and 
November of 1987 . In each case the higher 
resolution and signal-to-noise of the TDIHS can be 
seen. Figure 2 shows three scans taken on 
February 26, 1988 from 1005.0 to 1005. 25 cm"^. 
Each scan was calibrated independently as 
described earlier. The higher resolution can be 
seen in that the TDLHS can better resolve a 
number of lines that the Bomem interferometer 
spectra show as slope changes in the sides of 
lines . Figure 3 shows a comparison between 
Bomem and TDLHS spectra in the region 
1009.6 cm"l to 1009.8cm~l. The TDIHS resolves 
a line at 1009. 61880 cm ^, while the Bomem 
spectrum indicates that there may be a feature at 
that frequency . A similar phenomenal is seen with 
the line at 1009.70334 cm"^. All the 
interferometer data were collected by scans of 4 
minute duration.

were taken on May 11 , 1988 at zenith

Figure 4 illustrates a spectrum taken January 
21, 1987 at the University of Denver ( altitude 
1.6 km, 39.5'N 105*W ) . This spectrum was taken 
while the instrument was in its original 
configuration, and it has a signeil-to-noise ratio of 
45:1, or 17% of theoretical . The curves in Figure 
5 compare an expanded portion of the obseirved 
spectrum taken at 0.0016 cm~^ resolution, to a 
simulation using line parameters which are the 
same as those on the Hitran compilation, with the 
exception of the line positions, which were 
adjusted to agree with the observed data. The 
climatological vertical distribution of ozone at 
mid-latitude was taken as a starting point for a 
non-linear spectral least squares fitting procedure 
which scaled the whole profile until the best 
possible agreement between the two curves was 
obtained [ Goldman et al . , 1983 ] . It can be seen 
that the three lines shown are not all fit with the 
same precision. This difference is due to the 
combined effects of inaccuracies in the compiled 
line intensities and half widths, and the fact that 
the observed lines result from states of rather 
different, relatively high, energies and are 
therefore affected differently by changes in the 
local temperature. 

In order to investigate the possibility that 
the observed and simulated spectra might be 
brought into better agreement if the temperature 
profile of the model atmosphere were chainged, the 
fitting program was run in such a way that the 
temperature profile could be scaled to achieve the 
best agreement between the data and the model 
results. When this was done a slightly different 
total column amount of ozone was obtained, with 
no apparent improvement of the fit, with the 
difference between the two amounts being about

This figure shows a comparison of the 
observed data and the results of a 
spectral simulation over a narrcw region 
containing several ozone lines. The 
ozone amount was adjusted to give the 
best fit, and the spectrum shown was 
calculated with 344 m-atm-cm of 

ozone in the model atmosphere. 



The Dobson total ozone amount was adjusted 
by 3 . 9% before being compared to the infrared 
results, with the reported 369 Dobson unit Boulder 
measurement corrected to 355 m-atm-cm. This 
adjustment is needed because the Dobson values 
are now known to read high compared to 
ultraviolet and chemical measurements of ozone 
[ private communication from J.B. Kerr, 
Atmospheric Environment Service, 1987 ]. 



4. CONCLUSIONS 

The TDLHS is just now beginning to realize' 
its potential . It is hoped that a better selection 
of TDL's will become available in the not to 
distant future , thereby increasing the number of 
spectral regions which can be investigated . The 
higher resolution of the TDLHS provides the 
potential to better resolve the spectral lines of 
absorbers whose lines overlap those of other 
atmospheric constituents. Higher spectral 
resolution will provide better resolution of 
constituent vertical profiles vMch would benefit 
line shape inversion studies.

1. Introduction 

This paper presents the results of a quantitative analysis of 
absorptions by a number of minor and trace atmospheric 
gases in 0.02 cm" ' resolution solar absorption spectra record- 
ed at a number of solar zenith angles on 4 days in February 
1987 by F. J. Murcray and F. H. Murcray at the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Geophysi- 
cal Monitoring for Climate Change (GMCC) program station 
at Mauna Loa. Hawaii Qatitude IQ.S'N, longitude 155.6°W, 
elevation 3.40 km). The spectral data were recorded with a 
Michelson-type Fourier transform spectrometer, with a maxi- 
mum path difference of 50 cm and a scan time of 62 s. This 
instrument has been used previously to obtain many balloon- 
borne, ground-based, and laboratory spectra by the University 
of Denver spectroscopy group (see Goldman et al. [1988] for a 
description of the instrument and data collection system). 

There were a number of reasons for obtaining these obser- 
vations. First, Mauna Loa is a dry, high-altitude site, where 
there is a very significant reduction in the spectral interference 

by the strong HjO absorptions usually present in IR spectra

recorded from ground-based sites. This reduction allowed us 
to obtain measurements of several key trace atmospheric gases 
not usually accessible through ground-based IR observations. 
For example, we have been able to obtain simultaneous 
measurements of the daytime diurnal variations of the total 
columns of NOj and NO through observations of NOj lin« 
of the strong Vj band at 6.2 ^m and the weaker v, + v, band 
at 3 4 fim and of the NO lines of the fundamental vibration- 
rotation band at 5.3 Mm. Second, we were interested in obtam- 
ing IR data from a low^latitude station. To our knowledge, no 
such ground-based IR bbscrvations have been obtained pre- 
viously in the tropics. The spectra compose a permanent 
record of the state of the atmosphere at the time of the obser- 
vations and can be compared with spectra from other lo- 
cations and times to establish latitudinal distributions and 
temporal trends of minor and trace species. We are m the 
process of collecting data from a number of sites at different

New Zealand, Kitt Peak in Arizona, Mount Evans in Col-

edge with the exceptions of ongoing total ozone measure- 
ments with a Dobson instrument and visible region measure- 
ments of NO, obtained in 1978 [_Noxon et al, 1983], the 
present results provide the only measurements of total col-

umns from Mauna Loa. Our results therefore provide bench- 
mark observations of the total burdens of a number of gases 
above this site. For gases concentrated primarily in the strato- 
sphere (e.g., HCl and HNOj), our measured total columns can 
be compared with values from airborne latitudinal surveys 
[e.g., Mankin and Coffey, 1983; Girard et al., 1982, 1983]. Our 
measured ozone total column can be directly compared with 
correlative Mauna Loa Dobson results. Finally, since Mauna 
Loa is a NOAA GMCC site, we were interested in using the 
[R measurements to deduce average tropospheric con- 
centrations of long-lived gases for comparison with the 
NOAA GMCC site measurements. As will be shown in this 
paper, our results for COj, CH^, and NjO are in excellent 
agreement with NOAA GMCC sampling measurements at 
Mauna Loa. This implies that the Mauna Loa surface sam- 
pling measurements of these gases are representative of their 
average tropospheric concentrations. Because of the high alti- 
tude of the tropopause, the stratospheric contribution to the 
total column is relatively small. Therefore the uncertainty in 
the assumed mixing ratio distribution in the stratosphere 
causes only a small uncertainty in the derived mean tropo- 
spheric volume mixing ratio. Also, although the height of the 
tropical tropopause varies on both intcrannual and annual 
time scales and with the solar cycle [Gage and Reid, 198L 
1985; Reid and Gage, 1981, 1985], these variations are smaller 
than at higher latitudes and hence of lesser significance in 
interpreting time series of IR measurements. For these rea- 
sons, we believe that Mauna Loa is more suitable for IR 
monitoring of the tropospheric concentrations of long-lived 
gases than higher-latitude sites, where the tropopause is lower 
and more variable in height. 



2. Data and Analysis Method 

The spectral data have been analyzed using the technique of 
nonlinear least squares spectral curve fitting. Details of the 
application of this method to the analysis of ground-based 
infrared solar spectra are described in several recent papers 
[cf. Rinsland et al., i982a; Goldman et al., 1983, 1987a]. Except 
as noted in the following discussion, line parameters were 
taken from the 1986 Air Force Geophysics Laboratory high- 
resolution transmission (HITRAN) molecular absorption da- 
tabase \^Rothman et al, 1987]. Radiosonde soundings from 
Hilo, Hawaii, on the date of the spectral measurements were 
used to define the vertical pressure-temperature profile for the 
analysis. The tropopause was between 17 and 18 km altitude 
during the observations. The 15°N annual atmosphere from 
the U.S. Standard Atmosphere (1966) supplements was used to 
extend the pressure-temperature profile from the upper alti- 
tude limit of the soundings (about 30 km) to 100 km. These 
pressures and temperatures were input to a ray-tracing pro- 



gram [Gallery et al., 1983] to calculate the total air mass, 
mass-weighted pressures, and mass-weighted temperatures for 
each of 17 layers for the analysis of each spectrum. The total 
vertical column amount of air above Mauna Loa is calculated 
to be 1.44 X 10^' molecules cm"^. 

Table 1 summarizes the spectra included in the present 
study. The signal-to-rms noise ratio of the spectral data is 
about 200. It should be recalled that each spectrum provides a 
simultaneous measurement of a large number of constituents 
in the same volume of air. 

Previous studies [e.g., Goldman et ai, 1983, 1987a; Murcray 
et al., 1987] have shown that the total columns of most gases 
can be retrieved from the University of Denver ground-based 
spectra to a precision of several percent and to absolute accu- 
racies of 10-20%. Following the procedures described in these 
earlier investigations, errors in the total columns have been 
estimated, based on the sensitivity of the results to changes in 
the assumed vertical mixing ratio distributions and the as- 
sumed pressure-temperature profile and on knowledge of the 
uncertainties in the spectroscopic line parameters. Examples of 
sensitivity studies are presented in a previous paper [Goldman 
et al., 1983]. 

Narrow lines arising primarily from absorption in the low- 
pressure stratosphere (e.g., HCl, Oy) show a small asymmetry 
in the spectral profile indicating residual phase distortion (see, 
for example. Figures 5 and 9 of this paper), probably caused 
by incomplete alignment of the instrument during the run. 
Total columns retrieved, using various assumptions to model 
the measured line profiles, vary by about 5%. This source of 
uncertainty has been included in all of the la total column 
error estimates reported later. Phase errors are believed to 
also distort the shapes of broader lines (e.g., HjO, CH^, N2O), 
but these effects are difficult to separate from line shape asym- 
metries caused by pressure-induced line shifts (significant air- 
broadened line shifts have recently been measured in methane 
near 7 nm [Rinsland et al., 1988a; Malathy Devi et al., 1988]), 
errors in the assumed line positions, and line-mixing effects. 
Note, for example, rather large, second-derivative-type re- 
siduals near the CH^ and CO2 lines in Figure 3, a NjO line in 
Figure 6, and the CH^ lines in Figure 7. 

Ground-based infrared solar spectra also contain infor- 
mation on the vertical distributions of the observable gases. 
However, the weighting functions in altitude are rather broad. 
For the present analysis a reference volume mixing ratio pro- 
file for each gas [e.g., Smith, 1982] has been scaled by a single 
multiplicative factor until the best fit to the spectrum is 
achieved.

versity of Denver spectra recorded from South Pole Station 
IGoldman et a/., 1987a, 1988; Murcray et ai, 1987]. The target 
molecules are listed along with identifications of additional 
telluric and solar species occurring in each interval. The re- 
gions were selected to provide features that have minimal tem- 
perature sensitivity and minimal overlapping interference. The 
natural isotopic ratios incorporated in the intensities on the 
1986 HITRAN compilation [Rothman et ai, 1987] have been 
assumed in the analysis of molecules other than HjO; for 
water vapor the H, '*0, Hj"0, and HDO isotopes have been 
analyzed separately. 

Water Vapor 

To analyze for the total column for each isotope, the water 
vapor line intensities were divided by the isotopic abundance 
assumed for each on the HITRAN compilation [Rothman et 
a/., 1987, Table IV]. The U.S. Standard Atmosphere (1962) 
water vapor profile given by McClatchey et al. [1972, Table 
Bl] was scaled by a multiplicative factor in the fittings of all 
regions. Because of the dryness of the stratosphere and the 
high altitude of the tropopause in the tropics, the relative 
contribution of stratospheric HjO to the total column is very 
small. With the assumed vertical HjO profile, over 99.9% of 
the H,0 molecules in the total vertical column are calculated 
to be located below the tropopause. 

It has proven quite difficult to locate isolated lines with 
suitable temperature-insensitive intensities for analysis. Figure 
1 shows a fit to the primary H,'*0 line, a 2v, band transition 
at 3155.348 cm"' with a lower state energy of 446.511 cm"'. 
Because of overlapping absorption by a methane line on the 
high wave number wing, the analysis required the simulta- 
neous retrieval of both the H^'^O and CH4 total columns. 



The retrieved H,'*© total column amount from this interval 
is 2.1 ± 0.4 X 10^' molecules" tm"^ As a check on this result, 
the 2819.2-2819.64 cm"' interval was also analyzed. It con- 
tains a more temperature-sensitive 2v2 band line at 2819.449 
cm"' (lower state energy of 782.410 cm"') with the F3 (1-0) 
band H^Cl line at 2819.559 cm"' overlapping on its high 
wave number wing. The retrieved H,'*0 column of 1.9 ± 0.2 
X 10^' molecules cm"^ is consistent with the result from the 
3155.348 cm"' line. A weighted average value of 2.0 + 0.2 
X 10^' molecules cm "^ has been adopted as the best estimate 
for the Hj'*0 column. The selected Hj"0 line at 3205.412 
cm"', a 2v2 band transition with a lower state energy of 
172.882 cm"', is isolated and yields a total column of 4.4 
+ 0.7 X 10" molecules cm"^ The fit to this line in the 80.34'' 
solar zenith angle spectrum of February 6, 1987, is shown in 
Figure 2. There are numerous intervals between 2620 and 
2680 cm" ' that contain isolated HDO lines with temperature- 
insensitive intensities. The three regions analyzed yield an esti- 
mate of 2.7 ±0.1 X 10' ' molecules cm"^ for the HDO total 
column. Figure 3 shows an example of one of the HDO fits. 

Standard mean ocean water (SMOW) is the generally ac- 
cepted standard for reporting isotopic compositions of oxygen 
and hydrogen in natural samples. According to the lUPAC 
Commission on Atomic Weights and Isotopic Abundances 
[1983], recommended values for the D/H and the "0/'*0 
ratios in SMOW are (155.76 ± 0.05) x 10"* [_Hagemann et ai, 
1970] and (2000.20 ± 0.45) x 10"* {_Baertschi, 1976], respec- 
tively. Normalized to these reference isotopic concentrations, 
the measured column amounts correspond to a column- 
averaged D/H ratio of 0.44 ± 0.06 and a column-averaged 
'»0/'*0 ratio of 1. 10 ±0.21. The deuterium depletion is ex- 
pected primarily because HDO, the main deuterated constit- 
uent, is slightly less volatile, and therefore it preferentially 
remains in the condensed phase. Large and increasing deple- 
tions of D with altitude are predicted iKaye, 1987]. The same 
effect should also produce small depletions of ''O in water 
vapor; such depletions have been measured [see Kaye, 1987]. 
At 0°C, Kaye [1987] calculates a depletion that is 9 times 
larger for D than for "O. Assuming the minimum D deple- 
tion and the maximum ""O depletion obtainable from the 
error limits of our measurements, we calculate a lower limit of 
~5 for the ratio of the deuterium to the "O depletion in the 
total column. 

The large depiction in D obtained from our total column 
water vapor measurements is similar to the values determined 
from other remote sounding measurements, e.g., our study of 
University of Denver South Pole solar spectra [Goldman et al., 
1988], long-path surface measurements with a gas filter corre- 
lation spectrometer [Cosden et al, 1977], balloon-borne and 
aircraft infrared solar spectra of the stratosphere IRinsland et 
al., 1984ft], and far-infrared thermal emission spectra of the 
stratosphere [Abbas et al, 1987]. Numerous in situ measure- 
ments of D/H in tropospheric water vapor have also been 
reported, all indicating significant depletions in deuterium 
relative to SMOW, especially in the middle to upper tropo- 
sphere (see, for example, Rozanski and Sonntag [1982] and the 
comprehensive review article on isotopic molecular frac- 
tionation in planetary atmospheres by Kaye [1987]). The re- 
sults show a great deal of variability from measurement to 
measurement, with a trend of decreasing D depletion with 
altitude in the troposphere, especially in the lower tropo- 
sphere. The latter result is supported by analysis of the same

HDO and Hj^O lines in IR solar absorption spectra record- 
ed by G. A. Harvey (NASA Langley Research Center, private 
cpnimunication, 1987) in October 1987 from near sea level at 
NASA Langley (37.1°N latitude, 76.3°W longitude, elevation 
10 m). A columA-averaged normalized D/H ratio of 0.75 has 
been retrieved from these data. 

: The low abundaiice of water vapor above Mauna Loa at 
the time of the observations can be demonstrated by noting 
that the retrieved H^O total column is ~ 10% lower than a 
value deduced from similar spectra recorded from South Pole 
Station on December 3, 1986 IGoldman et al, 1988]. Hence 
although 0.8 km lower in altitude than nearby Mauna Kea, a 
well-known site for infrared, submillimeter, atid millimeter 
astronomical observations, Mauna Loa Observatory can also 
be a very dry observing site. However, wide variations of at- 
tnospheric teibperature and humidity lead to wide variations 
in atmospheric HjO concentrations, so that observations at 
other times may be more or less favorable in terms of dryness 
than those reported here. 

Carbon Dioxide 

Four intervals containing temperature-insensitive lines of 
carbon dioxide have been analyzed. The 2626 and 2632 cm" ' 
intervals each contain a single R branch line of the 20002- 
00001 band of '«0'^C''0. The 2632 cm"' window was used 
by Farmer et al. [1987] in their analysis of ground-based solar 
spectra recorded from McMurdo, Antarctica. The 3201 and 
3204 cm"' intervals each contain a single line of the 21103- 



00001 band of '^C'*©,. Unpublished 0.01 cm"' resolution 
room temperature laboratory spectra of ozone recorded with 
the McMath Fourier transform spectrometer (M. A. H. Smith, 
NASA Langley, private communication, 1987) show several 
lines in the 3201.30-3201.65 cm"' analysis interval that are 
not on the 1986 HITRAN compilation {Rothman et al, 1987]. 
These O, lines are weak but clearly seen in the Mauna Loa 
spectra. Their presence has a negligible impact on the COj 
retrievals. 

The adopted COj line parameters are reported in Table 3. 
The positions and intensities for the two '*0'^C"0 lines are 
from the study by Malathy Devi et al. [1984]; the intensities 
are 0.5-1.0% lower than on the 1986 HITRAN compilation 
\Rothman et al, 1987]. This small difference results from the 
effect of a nonzero higher order F-factor coefBcient obtained 
by Malathy Devi et al [1984] but not included in the 
HITRAN calculation iRothman, 1986]. The positions and in- 
tensities for the two '^C'*Oj lines are from the study by 
Benner et al [1988]. These intensities are about 5% higher 
than on the 1986 HITRAN compilation [_Rothman et al, 
1987]. The air-broadened half widths are from the 1986 
HITRAN compilation [,Rothman et al, 1987]. A r"°'" tem- 
perature dependence was assumed for the CO2 air-broadened 
half widths. Figure 4 shows an example of a fit to one of the 
'«0'^C"0 lines. 

An estimate of 5.0 + 0.5 x 10^' molecules cm"^ has been 
obtained for the total vertical CO2 column amount near 1800 
UT on February 6, 1987. This corresponds to a column-

averaged volume mixing ratio (VMR) of 349 ± 35 parts per 
million by volume (ppmv), in excellent agreement with an un- 
published GMCC measurement of 346.7 ppmv at Mauna Loa 
during the same morning (P. Tans, private communication, 
1988). This GMCC value is from a preliminary reduction of 
the data and is estimated to be accurate to a few tenths of a 
part per million by volume. The inclusion of a decrease of 7 
ppmv from the tropopause to the midstratosphere in the as- 
sumed reference COj vertical distribution, as has been report- 
ed by Bischofet al. [1985], would raise the retrieved infrared 
mean tropospheric COj VMR by only 0.2%. 

Ozone 

Each of the three windows selected for analysis contains an 
isolated line of the v, band of '^Oj with a temperature- 
insensitive intensity. The adopted line positions and intensities 
for each are from the study of Flaud et al. [1987]. The 1986 
HITRAN compilation intensities for these lines are 0.917- 
0.926 times the Flaud et al. [1987] intensities. The air- 
broadened O3 half widths from the 1986 HITRAN compi- 
lation \_Rothman et al., 1987], which result from the calcula- 
tions of Gamache and Rothman [1985], have been multiplied 
by 1.07 to agree with the recent laboratory measurements of 
Smith et al. [1988]. The adopted line parameters are given in 
Table 4. A J-" '' temperature dependence has been assumed 
for the O3 air-broadened half widths [Gamache, 1985]. 

Figure 5 gives a example of one of the ozone fits. As noted 
in section 1. the line shape is slightly asymmetric. This asym- 



metry has been modeled in the calculation of the best fit spec- 
tra. 

From the fittings, the total vertical column amount of ozone 
above Mauna Loa on the morning of February 10, 1987, is 
estimated to be 6.67 ± 0.80 x 10" molecules cm"^ or 
248 ± 30 Dobson units (DU). The agreement between the 
various retrievals is 4%; this value has been adopted as the 
estimate of the precision. The rather large error estimate is 
dominated by the estimated 10% uncertainty in the absolute 
intensity scale for the O3 lines [Flaud et al, 1987]. There is an 
urgent need for laboratory studies to improve the absolute 
accuracy of infrared ozone line intensities. 

Umkehr spectrophotometric measurements of total column 
ozone were obtained at Mauna Loa on the same morning as 
our IR spectral measurements. The measured value of 235 DU 
(R. D. Evans, personal communication, 1988) is slightly lower 
than our value of 248 ± 30 DU, but in agreement within our 
measurement uncertainty. If the 1986 HITRAN O3 parame- 
ters [Rothman et al., 1987] are assumed in our retrievals, a 
total O3 column of 275 DU, 1.18 times the correlative 
Umkehr measurements, is obtained. This significantly poorer 
agreement suggests that there is need to update the HITRAN 
parameters using the results of Flaud et al. [1987] and Smith 
eta/. [1988]. 

Nitrous Oxide 

Two spectral intervals in the 3- to 4-/im region have been 
analyzed to retrieve the N^O total column amount. The lower

A relative profile with a constant N^O VMR in the tropo- 
sphere and a decreasing VMR in the stratosphere, based on in 
situ measurements and satellite measurements of the Nimbus 
7 Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder (SAMS) instrument 
has been assumed. The stratospheric values were obtained 
from the equatorial data presented in Figure 9 of Jones and 
Pyle [1984]; a smooth curve was drawn through the in situ 
data from 15 to 35 km and extended to higher altitude with 



the SAMS annual mean profile. Approximately 91% of the 
NjO total vertical column is located below the tropopause. 

The total columns obtained from the fittings agree to better 
than 5% and yield a total vertical column amount of 4.3 + 0.4 
X 10'* molecules cm"^, which corresponds to a column- 
averaged VMR of 299 ±25 parts per biUion by volume 
(ppbv). An estimate of 308 ± 30 ppbv for the mean VMR in 
the troposphere is obtained from the retrieved total column 
amount and the assumed vertical distribution, in excellent 
agreement with a value of 306.2 ± 2.0 ppbv, obtained from a

sample measurements of January 26, 1987, the date closest to

ppmv. An estimated mean tropospheric VMR of 1.64 ± 0.16 
ppm is obtained from the measured total column and the 
assumed vertical distribution. This value can be compared 
with data from flask samples collected at Mauna Loa within 
minutes of our infrared observations. The measured hourly 
averaged CH^ concentration of 1.665 ppmv between 1700 and 
1800 UT on February 6, 1987 (L. P. Steele, unpublished data, 
1988) agrees within 2% with our nearly simultaneous infrared 
data. (See Steele et al. [1987] for a discussion of the calibra- 
tion of the Mauna Loa CH^ NOAA GMCC data.) 

Comparisons of infrared mean tropospheric VMR and the 
NOAA GMCC surface measurements are potentially useful 
for detecting deviations from a uniform CH^ volume mixing 
ratio in the troposphere. A constant VMR profile is indicated 
by measurements obtained at northern hemisphere mid- 
latitudes by collection of flask samples from aircraft [Ehhah 
and Heidt, 1973; Reichle and Condon, 1979]. Also, the data of 
Rasmussen and Khalil [1982] show no conclusive evidence for 
differences in CH4 volume mixing ratios measured above and 
below the tropical boundary layer. However, a comparison by 
Steele et al. [1987] of the very precise NOAA GMCC data 
sets from Cape Kumukahi and Mauna Loa, Hawaii, which are 
in close geographic proximity but separated by 3.34 km in 
altitude, indicates that on average the Mauna Loa CH^ con- 
centrations are lower than the Cape Kumukahi values by 22 
ppbv (~1.5%). No conclusive evidence for differences in the 
seasonal cycles at these two sites was found. Vertical profile 
gradients that vary with season have been measured in the 
mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere; these data also 



show a significant reduction of the surface level CH« seasonal 
cycle in the middle troposphere and the absence of a seasonal 
cycle in the upper troposphere [Fraser et al., 1984, 1986]. 
Additional infrared spectral measurements from Mauna Loa 
at various times of the year would allow an opportunity to 
compare the seasonal variation in these results with those 
determined from the NOAA GMCC site data. 

Nitric Acid 

The HNOj vertical distribution assumed in the analysis was 
obtained by combining measurements and model predictions. 
In the stratosphere we have adopted the 20°N latitude Febru- 
ary 1979 monthly mean volume mixing ratios measured by the 
Limb Infrared Monitor of the Stratosphere (LIMS) experi- 
ment aboard the Nimbus 7 satellite IGille et al., 1984]. Below 
12 km altitude we have adopted the calculated HNO3 volume 
mixing ratios from profile A oi Logan et al. [1981, Figure 
12a], scaled by 0.225 to agree with the average daytime con- 
centration of 18 parts per trillion by volume (pptv) measured 
at the Mauna Loa NOAA GMCC station by Galasyn et al. 
[1987] during February 1985. Volume mixing ratios between 
12 km altitude and the tropopause were obtained by smoothly 
extending the upper and lower altitude distributions, using the 
reference HNO3 profile of Smith [1982] as a guide. Our refer- 
ence HNO3 distribution corresponds to a total vertical 
column amount of 5.9 x 10" molecules cm'^ About 86% of 
the HNO3 molecules are located in the stratosphere. About 
96% of the HNO3 molecules are above 12 km altitude, the

approximate base altitude of previously reported aircraft total 
column amount surveys. 

Two spectral intervals containing a number of strong P- 
branch manifolds of the v, band of HNO3 were analyzed, 
assuming the 1986 HITRAN compilation line parameters 
[Rotfiman et al., 1987]. Total column amounts retrieved from 
four spectra using these two intervals agree to 5%, a value we 
have adopted as the estimate of the precision. The average 
retrieved total column amount of 5.9 x 10" molecules cm"^ 
is estimated to have an absolute accuracy of 20%, based on 
sensitivity studies similar to those reported by Murcray et al. 
[1987]. Figure 8 shows an example of the fitting results. 

Results of a number of surveys of the latitudinal variation of 
the total vertical column amount of HNO3 are collected in 
Figure 2 of Murcray et al. [1987]. At the latitude of Mauna 
Loa, these values range from about 4 to 6 x 10" molecules 
cm"^. Hence our Mauna Loa result is located in the upper 
part of the range of these measurements. 

As noted above, measurements and model predictions sug- 
gest that the troposphere contributes only a relatively small 
amount to our measured total column. However, our infrared 
data were recorded in winter, when the HNO3 surface con- 
centrations at Mauna Loa are lowest {_Galasyn et al., 1987]. 
Highest concentrations were measured during the late 
summer. Assuming the average daytime surface concentration 
of 97 pptv measured in August to scale the same vertical 



distribution shape [Logan et al., 1981, Figure I2a, profile A], 
we calculate a total vertical column of HNO3 below 12 km 
altitude of 1.4 x 10" molecules cm'^, about 24% of our mea- 
sured total column. Hence seasonal changes in the tropo- 
spheric column amount need to be considered in interpreting 
a time series of HNO3 total columns measured from the 
ground, even from a remote site such as Mauna Loa. Al- 
though a diurnal cycle (higher concentrations during the up- 
slope wind hours of 0900-2100 LT) in the ground-level con- 
centrations at Mauna Loa was also observed, Galasyn et al. 
[1987] believe these changes are the result of depletion 
through dry deposition on the mountain's elevated surface 
and are unlikely to be reflected in the free troposphere. The 
daytime measurements of Galasyn et al. [1987] are consistent 
with GAMETAG measurements of free tropospheric HNO3 
[Huebert and Lazrus, 1980] obtained during the same time of 
the year (see Galasyn et al. [1987] for a discussion). 

Hydrogen Chloride 

As in two recent ground-based studies [Goldman et al., 
1987a; Farmer et al., 1987], we adopted the P2 transition of 
H"C1 at 2843.625 cm"' and the Rl transition of H"C1 at 
2925.897 cm"' as the principal lines for the atmospheric 
quantification of hydrogen chloride. The total columns 
derived from the fittings of these two lines agree to better than 
5%. An example of a fit to the Rl line is shown in Figure 9.

The HCl lines are narrow, even at the highest zenith angles 
indicating that most of the HCl molecules are located m the 
upper atmosphere. As concluded by Goldman et a. [1986] the 
nieasurements show little sensitivity to the details of the tro- 
pospheric HCl profile; the fitting results -d retrieved total 
column amount change very little for low and medium con- 
centrations of troposphericHClin the model. 

The retrieved total column amount of 1.6 ±0.2 x 10 mo 
ecules cm-^ is plotted in Figure 10 along with aircraft obser- 
:::!:;: and m'odd predictions of the HCi stratospheric 
column abundance, as presented in Figures 1-12 of the

Our measured total column is about a factor of 2 h-gher than 
three measurements obtained between 18.3»N and 24-5 Nlat. 
tude in 1978 [Manicm arui Coffey, 1983]. However, the Mauna 
Loa column is very close to the measurement of 1.5 ± U^ 
X 10" molecules cm"^ for the total HCl column near 25 N 
in 1980 [Girard el al., 1982]. The latter measurement was 
subsequently revised upward to 2.0 ± 0.5 x 10" molecules 
cm -^because of changes in the assumed spectroscopic pa- 
rameters iGirard et al, 1983]. The rather large discrepancy 
between hese two sets of aircraft total column amount 
n^tsurements needs to be resolved before the present data 
can be used to derive any information about the ^ng- erm 
trend in the HCl total column. Additional '-"surements are 
needed to assess the seasonal and short-term variability of the 
total column and to determine the contribution of tropo- 
spheric HCl to the total column.

Khalit, 1982; Ehhalt and Rudolph, 1984; Blake and Rowland, 
1986], the similarity between the Mauna Loa and the north- 
ern mid-latitude mean VMRs is surprising. The rather high 
Mauna Loa total column may result from the seasonal cycle 
of CjHj; the present measurements were obtained in winter, 
when CjHj concentrations are reported to be the highest 
[Tille el al., 1985; Blake and Rowland, 1986]. However, in 
another study, Singh and Solas [1982] did not find any evi- 
dence for a seasonal cycle during 1979-1981 at Point Arena, 
California (39°N). Additional Mauna Loa spectral measure- 
ments during other seasons would be useful to quantify the 
seasonal cycle of C^Hj. 

Difluorochloromethane (CFC-22) 

Figure 12 shows an example of a fit to the narrow, intense 
2vj Q branch of CHCIF^ at 829.05 cm"'. This feature has 
been used previously for atmospheric quantifications from 
ground-based [Zander et ai, 1983], balloon-borne [Goldman 
el al., 1981a], and space-shuttlc-bome solar spectra [Zander et 
ai, 1987]. The spectroscopic parameters adopted for CHClFj 
were provided by L. R. Brown (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
private communication, 1987) and are based on fittings to 
room-temperature and low-temperature laboratory spectra re- 
corded at 0.005 cm"' resolution with the McMath Fourier 
transform spectrometer at the National Solar Observatory on 
Kitt Peak. These parameters are described by Brown et al. 
[1987] and Zander et al. [1987]. Parameters for additional 
gases in the window region (only COj and CjHj are signifi- 
cant contaminants) were taken from the 1986 HITRAN com- 



pilation [Rothman et al, 1987]. The CHCIF2 vertical distri- 
bution reported by Zander et al. [1987] was assumed in the 
fittings. 

An estimate of 9.7 ± 2.5 x 10'* molecules cm"^ has been 
derived for the total vertical column of CHClFj above Mauna 
Loa. This corresponds to a column-averaged VMR of 68 ± 17 
pptv, close to column-averaged values from Kitt Peak (31.9°N 
latitude) solar spectra of 67 ± 16 pptv on April 26, 1981, and 
90 ± 18 pptv on March 6, 1982 [Zander et al, 1983]. Since 
the CHCIF2 volume mixing ratio decreases above the tropo- 
pause [Fabian et al, 1985; Zander et al, 1987], the tropo- 
spheric VMR is slightly higher than the column-averaged 
VMR; an estimate of 78 ± 20 pptv for the mean tropospheric 
VMR is obtained from our value and the vertical distribution 
we have assumed. This result can be compared with pre- 
viously reported infrared and in situ measurements of the 
troposphere. A profile covering the 10- to 30-km altitude 
range at 30°N was deduced from infrared spectra recorded 
with the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) 
instrument from the space shuttle in May 1985 [Zander et al, 
1987]. The Mauna Loa mean tropospheric VMR estimate is 
slightly higher than the ATMOS value of 55 ± 5 pptv at 10 
km. Unfortunately, CHClFj is not currently being measured 
at Mauna Loa. Published surface sampling measurements in- 
dicate that the concentration of CHClFj is increasing by 
about 12-16% per year [Khalil and Rasmussen, 1981; Fabian 
et al, 1985; Fabian, 1986]. The inferred Mauna Loa tropo- 
spheric VMR is 0.71 times an estimated northern hemisphere 
surface value of 110 pptv, derived by extending the trend in

the 1976-1982 data in Figure 7 of Fabian [1986] to February

The discrepancy between the IR and the extrapolated sur- 
face sampling data may be caused by (1) an error in the cali- 
bration of the surface sampling data, (2) a slower increase m 
the surface level CHClFj VMRs from 1982 to 1987 than as- 



sumed by us, (3) errors in the CHClFj line parameters utilized 
in the spectroscopic analysis, (4) a decrease in the CHClFi 
VMR with altitude in the troposphere, or (5) a combination of 
the above-mentioned factors. 

Nitric Oxide 

The daytime diurnal variation of NO has been measured 
from three spectra recorded during the early morning of Feb- 
ruary 8, 1987, two spectra recorded near noon on the same 
day. and two spectra obtained during the late afternoon of 

February 9, 1987. 

As in our recent study of infrared spectra recorded from 
South Pole Station [Murcray et al., 1987], the well-isolated 
NO lines at 1857.275 cm"' (P5.5) and 1914.990 cm" {Rll.S) 
were selected as primary features for the analysis. Spectral 
fitting retrievals were also run with the less favorable NO hnes 
at 1887 523 cm" (R2.5) and 1896.990 cm" (R5.5). The R2.5 
line is overlapped by a weak O, line at 1887.580 cm", and 
the R5.5 line is overlapped by a weak CO, line at 1897.023 
cm- ' The nitric oxide lines (actually unresolved X doublets 
with component separations of 0.011 cm") are weak features 
in the Mauna Loa spectra with maximum absorptions of 

-5% or less. 

Table 5 lists the retrieved NO total vertical column 
amounts. These values were determined assuming the 1986 
HITRAN spectroscopic line parameters IRothman et al.. 1987] 
and an NO vertical VMR distribution for clean troposphenc 
conditions ^Rinsland et al., 1984a, Table 3]. Figure 13 shows

columns in Table 5 is ~ 10%, based on the agreement of the 
individual retrievals from each spectrum and on photo- 
chemical model studies of errors resulting from the assump- 
tion of an NO vertical profile shape that does not change with 
time [Rinsland et al., 1984a]. The absolute accuracies of the 
total columns are lower, ~ 20%, since the values also depend 
on the accuracies of the assumed NO spectral line parameters, 
the assumed pressure-temperature profile, and the assumed 
shape of the vertical NO profile distribution; furthermore, as 
noted previously, they arc affected by the inaccuracies in the 
modeling of the phase distortions in the spectral line profiles. 

Uncertainty in the values of the NO line intensities is a 
major source of potential systematic error. The intensities on 
the 1986 HITRAN compilation [_Rothman et al, 1987] were 
calculated by Gi7/is and Goldman [1982] and are normalized 
to agree with the high-resolution measurements of individual 
P- and R-branch lines by Mandin et al. [1980]. Although this 
normalization is supported by the integrated absorption 
measurements of Holland et al. [1983], a number of other 
studies have obtained intensities that are ~ 10-15% lower 
[see Ballard et al, 1988]. A 10% uncertainty in the intensities 
has been assumed in our error budget calculations. 

Figure 14 compares the present results with total columns 
retrieved from a series of 0.01 cm""' resolution solar absorp- 
tion spectra recorded from Kitt Peak (latitude 31.9°N, lon- 
gitude 111.6°W, 2.095 km altitude) on February 23, 1981. It is 
reasonable to compare these results, since the two sets of 
measurements were obtained at nearly the same time of year 
from sites separated by only 12.4° in latitude and were derived 
using the same analysis techniques (nonlinear least squares 
spectral fitting). Also, the NO line parameters assumed for 
both studies are from the same calculation [Gillis and Gold- 
man, 1982]. The daytime diurnal changes derived from the two 
sets of measurements are consistent: an increase in the NO 
total column during the morning, late afternoon values about 
40-50% higher than in the morning, and a decline in the total 
NO column prior to sunset. The Mauna Loa data include two 
measurements obtained near noon. These values are ~I2% 



lower than the afternoon measurement at a zenith angle of 
63.74°, suggesting that the peak in the total column occurs 
sometime in the early afternoon, rather than at noon. How- 
ever, since this difference is very close to our estimated preci- 
sion, we believe that additional measurements need to be ob- 
tained to confirm this result. 

At the same time of day, the Mauna Loa total column is 
~0.7 times the Kitt Peak total column. This substantial differ- 
ence conflicts with the aircraft stratospheric total column 
measurements of Coffey et al. [1981] which, as shown in their 
Figure 9, indicate no significant latitudinal gradient below 
35"N in winter (however, their higher-latitude data show a 
clear decrease in the total column above 40°N in winter). 
Since the Kitt Peak and Mauna Loa data were obtained on 
single days in February 1981 and February 1987, it is possible 
that this discrepancy may be caused by variability and/or 
long-term trends, rather than a latitudinal gradient in the total 
column of NO. Additional aircraft and ground-based 
measurements are needed to resolve this discrepancy. From 
analysis of aircraft IR measurements obtained in November 
1976 near 20°N latitude, Girard et al. [1979] report a total 
column of 5.0 X 10" molecules cm"^ above 1 1 km at sunset, 
nearly a factor of 2 higher than the total columns measured in 
the late afternoon from Mauna Loa and the total column of 
3.08 X 10" molecules cm'^ above 12 km, measured at sunset 
on February 12, 1978, near 22.6°N latitude [.Coffey et a/., 
1981].

As noted previously \_Murcray et al., 1987], the intense Vj 
band of NO^ near 6.2 ^m is usually unobservable in ground- 
based solar spectra because of overlapping strong absorption 
by intense water vapor lines. Under especially dry conditions, 
NOj absorption features can be detected in several small 
(^2-5 cm"' wide) windows between 1585 and 1610 cm"'. 
These lines have been observed in solar spectra recorded from 
South Pole Station \_Murcray et al., 1987] and are clearly seen 
in the low to intermediate air mass Mauna Loa spectra, where 
signal-to-rms noise ratios of 200-500 arc achieved in the NOj 
window regions. Figure 15 shows the best window region in 
one of the Mauna Loa spectra; identifications of the observ- 
able atmospheric and solar features are given. Unfortunately, 
water vapor absorption is much stronger in the high air mass 
Mauna Loa spectra and, primarily for this reason, these spec- 
tra have too low a signal-to-noise ratio to obtain good quanti- 
tative results on NOj. 

To study the daytime diurnal variation of the total column 
of NOj, a total of 1 1 solar spectra have been utilized. Four of 
the spectra are the low to moderate air mass spectra showing 
the NO J Vj band features; they arc the same spectra that were 
used in the analysis of NO. To obtain NOj total columns near 
sunrise and sunset, we analyzed three spectra recorded in the 
early morning and four recorded in the late afternoon of Feb- 
ruary 6, 1987. They show weak features of the v, -I- Vj band of 
NO2 near 3.4 /jm, which is about 20 times weaker than the 
6.2-Ajm Vj band. The v, -1- v, band occurs in a relatively clear 
transmission region and has been utilized previously for 
ground-based IR studies of atmospheric NO^ iCamy-Peyret et 
al., 1983; Flaud et al., 1983, 1988; Murcray et al., 1987]. As in 
these studies, we have derived total columns from the NO^ 
feature at 2914.65 cm"', a composite of several closely spaced 
transitions. This feature is fairly well isolated, but is weak in

the measured spectra, with maximum absorption depths rang- 
ing from 0.5% (early morning spectra) to 1.5% (late afternoon 
siictra). A fairly wide interval (2914.4(^2914.70 cm-') was 
analyzed so as to include the strong CH, hne at 2914.4986 
cm- ' The CH* total columns retrieved from this hne agree to 
5%, thus verifying that the measured NO, diurnal changes are 
not an artifact of our analysis method. 

The NOj vertical mixing ratio distribution adopted in the 
analysis assumes low volume mixing ratios of NO^ in the 
troposphere, consistent with the narrow line widths of the 
NO, features in the solar spectra and visible region sunrise 
and sunset solar absorption measurements from Mauna Loa, 
which indicate a mean NO, mixing ratio of 30 pptv at 
30 ±05 km altitude [Noxon, 1981]. Our assumed vertical 
distribution has been obtained by smoothly joining the tropo- 
spheric and lower stratospheric mixing ratios from prohle 
"3N" of Noxon [1981, Figure 3] with the stratospheric volume 
mixing ratios of Camy-Peyret et al. [1983, Table 3] at 21 km 
altitude. With this distribution. 38% of the total vertica 
column is located below the tropopause. The mean altitude of 
NO, molecules in the assumed vertical distribution is 23 km, 
as compared to a mean altitude of -30 km derived from 
measurements at Mauna Loa in February 1978 [Noxon et al, 

19831. 

Line positions and intensities for the v, and the v, + v, 
- V NO, bands in the 62-y.m region, obtained from C. 
CamVpeyret and J.-M. Haud (private communicatioa. 1984) 
are from the calculation described by Camy-Peyret et al. 
ri982] Line positions and intensities for the v, + Vj and the 
V + V, + V3 -V, NO, bands in the 3.4-Mm region were 
taken from the 1986 HITRAN compilation IRothman el al., 
19871- the calculation of these parameters is descnbed by 
Perrin et al. [1982]. An air-broadened half width of 0.063 
cm- ' atm- ' at 296 K with a T-""' temperature dependence 
malathy Devi et al., 1982a, b] was assumed for all NO, lines. 
Absorption by other atmospheric gases in the selected regions 
(see Table 2) was calculated with the parameters from the 198b 
HITRAN compilation IRothman et al., 1987] and the mixing 
ratios retrieved from the other regions. Solar CO lines of the 
fundamental vibration-rotation sequence of bands are observ- 
able in the 6-/im Mauna Loa spectra (see Figure 15), but 
simulations of this absorption generated using the procedure 



described by Rinsland et al. [1982b] and studies of high Sun 
spectra recorded during University of Denver balloon flights 
IGoldman et ai, 19876, c] indicate negligible interference by 
solar CO lines in the selected windows. 

The retrieved NO, total columns are listed m Table 5. On 
the basis of considerations similar to those described for the 
NO analysis, the precisions of the NO, total columns are 
estimated to be ~ 10% for values deduced from the 6.2-;xm 
features and ~ 10-20% for values deduced from the much 
weaker 3.4-;.m feature. The line parameters arc well deter- 
mined in both regions, with uncertainties of only ~5/.. so 
that only a small error is believed to result by combining 
retrievals from the two spectral regions. A previous study has 
shown that the 3.4- and 6.2-;zm NO, bands yield consuitent 
quantitative results ICoffey et al.. 1986]. The absolute accu- 
racies are only slightly poorer than the estimated precisions: 
-15% for the retrievals from the 6.2-;im features and 
~ 15-25% for the retrievals from the 3.4-/im feature. 

Since previous ground-based studies show no evidence for 
differences in the NO, diurnal cycle over 3 days of observa- 
tions IFlaud et al., 1988], all of the Mauna Loa daU have 
been combined to study the NO, diurnal -^yf^- f-f" J 
presents a plot of the Mauna Loa measurements, along with 
total columns retrieved from 0.01 cm"' resolution solar ab- 
sorption spectra recorded from Kitt Peak at nearly the sa^e 
time of the year, February 23, 1981. ICamy-Peyret et ai, 1983] 
and March 1-2, 1986, IFlaud et al., 1988]. The latter measure- 
ments were obtained as part of a study of the diurnal variation 
of the NO, total column from daytime observations using the 
Sun as the source and nighttime observations using the Moon 
as the source. The same set of line parameters have been 
assumed in the three studies. Within the estimated precisions, 
all of the measurements overlap. All three data seU are consis- 
tent with a continuous increase of the NO, total column with 
time throughout the day, with a more rapid "« during the 
morning than in the afternoon. Total columns dedu«d from 
solar spectra recorded from Kitt Peak on Septembe 20 1982 
fFlaud et ai, 1983] show a diurnal variation similar to the 
iesults plotted in Figure 16; however, the absolute amounts in 
September 1982 were neariy a factor of 2 smaller than on the 

other dates.

NO2 measurements from the Mauna Loa NOAA GMCC sta- 
tion. The data were acquired during most of 1978 by visible 
spectral region spectrophotometers, which ran automatically 
and recorded spectra of the zenith sky for subsequent analysis. 
In February 1978, evening twilight NOj column abundances 
averaged ~3.7 x 10'* molecules cm"^ and morning twilight 
abundances averaged ~2.3 x 10" molecules cm"^, with 
short-term fluctuations of ~0.5 x 10" molecules cm"^ 
[Noxon et al., 1983, Figure 1]. It is not possible to make an 
exact comparison of these results with our measurements, 
since the data of Noxon et al. [1983] refer to times much 
closer to sunrise and sunset than our data. However, in both 
the morning and evening, the total columns derived from our 
highest air mass spectra are significantly lower than the corre- 
sponding values of Noxon et al. [1983]. Also, our late after- 
noon total columns are nearly a factor of 2 higher than those 
near sunrise, whereas the corresponding ratio of the Noxon et 
al. [1983] data is ~ 1.6. Since both the visible and the infrared 
methods are frequently used for measuring atmospheric NO2, 
we believe it would be useful to obtain simultaneous measure- 
ments with both techniques in the future to resolve such dis- 
crepancies. 

4. Other Gases 

The two most abundant chlorofluorocarbons, CFjClj and 
CFCI3. show strong absorption features in the 8- to l2-^tm 
region of the Mauna Loa spectra. However, the lack of accu- 
rate spectroscopic parameters precludes quantification of the 
total columns at this time. Work is in progress on the calcula- 
tion of parameters for the 923 cm"' CF^Cl^ Q branches (see 
Deroche and Goldman [1987] and Rinsland et at. [1988b] for 
discussions). 

Very weak absorption is observable at the position of the 
R]9 line of the v, band of CjHj (acetylene) at 776.0818 cm"'. 
However, this absorption is too close to the noise level of the 



present spectra to obtain a definitive identification of CiHj. 
An upper limit for the total vertical column of 1.5 x 10" 
molecules cm'^ has been estimated by scaling a C^Hj vertical 
distribution calculated for medium OH in the troposphere 
[Goldman et al., 1981b, Figure 2] by a single multiplicative 
factor, until an absorption feature 3 times the rms noise level 
is predicted. This upper limit total column is slightly less than 
total columns of 2.28 ± 0.34 x 10" molecules cm"^ on Feb- 
ruary 23, 1981, and 2.00 + 0.30 x 10" molecules cm"^ on 
October 1, 1982, derived from analysis of Fourier transform 
infrared (FTIR) spectra recorded at the National Solar Obser- 
vatory on Kitt Peak [_Rinsland et al., 1985]. Observations at 
higher air masses (the present spectra cover zenith angles of 
84.31° or less) should permit the identification and quantita- 
tive measurement of CjHj from Mauna Loa. 

A numhier of additional atmospheric gases have strong IR 
absorption bands outside the regions covered by the Mauna 
Loa observations. Of these, four have been detected using 
similar IR instrumentation and could be readily monitored 
from Mauna Loa. These gases and their most favorable IR 
bands are OCS (vj band at 2062 cm''), CO (1-0 band at 21 17 
cm"'), HCN (vj band at 3311 cm"'), and HF (1-0 band at 
3961cm"'). 



5. Summary and Conclusions 
The measurements and main conclusions of this study may 
be summarized as follows: 

1. A series of high and low air mass infrared solar spectra 
were collected from Mauna Loa, Hawaii, on 4 days in Febru- 
ary 1987. These spectra have been analyzed to deduce total 
vertical column amounts of 13 atmospheric gases. 

2. The mean D/H ratio of the total water vapor column 
was 0.44 + 0.06 times the reference value of 155.76 x 10"* for 
SMOW, indicating a large depletion in the deuterium content 
similar to previous measurements of the upper troposphere 
and lower stratosphere. 

3. Within the measurement uncertainties, thfere is agree- 
ment between ozone total columns deduced from the infrared 
spectra and correlative Utiikehr observations. 

4. Mean tropospheric volume mixiiig ratios of COj, CH4, 
and N2O deduced from our IR observations agree with cor- 
relative NOAA GMCC measurements within the measure- 
ment uncertainties. This implies that the NOAA GMCC sur- 
face volume mixing ratios are good measures of the mean 
volume mixing ratios of these gases in the troposphere. 

5. The measured HNO3 total column agrees within the 
errors with published aircraft and satellite measurements of 
the total stratospheric column. Published sampling measure- 
ments from Mauna Loa show a" significant seasonal cycle in 
the surface level concentrations of HNO3, with minimum 
values near the time of our IR measurements. On the basis of 
these data, tropospheric HNO, is estimated to contribute only 
a small amount to our measured total column. A significant 
tropospheric contribution is predicted for late summer. 

6. Although the measured HCI total column is about a 
factor of 2 higher than aircraft total column measurements 
obtained near the same latitude 9 years earlier by Mankin and 
Coffey [1983], discrepancies between these aircraft values and 
the higher aircraft values reported by Girard et al. [1982, 
1983] and the absence of measurements to assess the con- 
centrations of HCI in the troposphere above Mauna Loa

make it impossible at present to derive information about 
long-term trends in the HCl total column from our data. 

7. The mean tropospheric volume mixing ratio of CHClFj 
deduced from the infrared spectra is about 30% lower than a 
value obtained from an extrapolation of in situ surface data to 
the date of our infrared observations. 

8. Simultaneous measurements of the daytime diurnal 
variations of the total columns of NO and NO2 have been 
obtained. To our knowledge, these are the first such observa- 
tions that have been reported. 

The column amounts reported here were obtained from 
spectra recorded with a resolution of 0.02 cm"'. Absolute 
accuracies of about 10% have been achieved. The good agree- 
ment between the IR and the GMCC data is encouraging. It is 
important to recall that several of the sources of error are 
systematic (for example, the uncertainties in the assumed line 
intensities) and that these effects are eliminated or reduced 
significantly when results are normalized to study a time series 
of measurements. Hence additional sets of IR measurements 
obtained from Mauna Loa and analyzed in the same way 
should yield precise information on seasonal and long-term 
trends for a number of important atmospheric species. 

Observations with a new interferometer operating at a reso- 
lution of 0.002 cm"' are planned from Mauna Loa and 
should yield improved results. The increased resolution should 
permit details of the altitude distributions to be derived from 
analysis of the observed pressure-broadening effects as a func- 
tion of solar zenith angle. Such effects are apparent in HNO3 
features recorded in initial solar observations from the Univer- 
sity of Denver. Improved information on the vertical profile is 
necessary, for example, in interpreting secular trends in HCl, 
since significant variability of the tropospheric profile may 
mask increases observed in the stratospheric total column 
iWMO, 1986].

Introduction 
In December 1980 and November-December 1986. the 
University of Denver atmospheric spectroscopy group re- 
corded numerous high-resolution infrared solar absorption 
spectra from the Amundsen-Scott south pole station. These 
spectra were obtained by Frank J. Murcray and Frank H. 
Murcray with a Michelson-type Fourier transform spectrom- 
eter and show absorption features of a number of minor and 
trace atmospheric gases with a minimum of atmospheric 
water vapor absorption. Quantifications of the total column 
amounts of O3. CH4, N^O, and H^O from the 1980 observa- 
tions [Goldman et al., 1983] and HCl from the 1986 obser- 
vations [Goldman et al., 1987] have been reported along with 
an atlas of the 750-960 cm"' spectral region [Blatherwick et 
al., 1982]. In the present study, we report measurements of 
HNO3 total column amounts deduced from both data sets 
and NO, and NO-, total column amounts from the 1986 data 
set. Nitric acid may be important in the chemistry which 
creates the spring Antarctic ozone minimum, since it may 
condense in the cold winter polar stratosphere and become 
the dominant component of polar stratospheric clouds [Toon 
et al 1986; Crutzen and Arnold, 1986]. The present mea- 
surements were obtained shortly after the austral spnng 
ozone minimum and define for the first time the ambient 
levels of these nitrogen species immediately following the 
breakup of the polar vortex. 

Analysis of HNO, Observations 
Spectral intervals near 870 cm"' for which the best 
agreement is obtained between measured and calculated 
HNO3 absorption features have been selected for quantita- 
tive analysis from spectra obtained on December 5, 1980, 
and November 26, 1986. The most prominent absorptions 
contained in this region are the regularly spaced P-branch 
manifolds of the HNO3 fs band. The nearly constant solar 
zenith angle of the south pole observations allowed the 
coadding of several spectral scans on each day, yielding a 
signal-to-rms-noise of about 300 near 870 cm"'. The resolu- 
tion of the 1980 and 1986 spectra are 0.02 and 0.04 cm ,

respectively. A multiparameter nonlinear least squares spec- 
tral fitting method, the same utilized to quantify gas amounts 
in previous ground-based spectra analysis studies [Rmsland 
et al mi; Goldman et al., 1983, 1986], has been employed 
along with the line parameters of the 1986 HITRAN compi- 
lation [Rothman et al., 1987]. The HNO3 parameters cover- 
ing the 870 cm-' region in the HITRAN compilation were 
generated at the University of Denver [Goldman and Gilhs 
1984] and have been applied previously to the analysis of 
stratospheric solar absorption spectra obtained dunng a 
balloon flight [Goldman et al., 1984]. However, a constant 
air-broadened half-width of 0.13 cm"' atm" at 296 K is 
assumed on the 1986 HITRAN compilation Rothman etal 
mi] whereas a constant air-broadened halfwidth of 0.10

cm ' atm-' at 296 K was assumed in two previous atmo- 
spheric studies of HNO3 [Goldman et al., 1980, 1984]. This 
difference changes the retrieved HNO3 total column 
amounts by less than 5%. The major interference near he 
spectral region used is due to water vapor. Under the 
conditions that exist at the south pole, this interference is 

minimal. , , 

Figure 1 illustrates the agreement between measured and 
best fit calculated spectra. All of the observed features m the 
fitted region are attributable to HNO, [Blatherwick et al., 
1982] A total of six parameters have been adjusted simulta- 
neously in this fitting, five of which are instrumental param- 
eters to model the level and slope of the 100% transmission 
curve, the shift in frequency (cm"') between the measured 
and computed spectrum, and the amphtude and phase of a 
weak channel spectrum (period = 1.0 cm'') observed m the 
data The remaining parameter is a multiplicative scahng 
factor that converts an assumed relative mixing ratio in each 
layer to an absolute value. Notice that the calculated 100% 
transmittance level (dashed curve in Figure 1) is several 
percent above the measured spectrum. This difference re- 
sults from the many overlapping weak fundamental and hot 
band lines of HNO3 in this region. The presence of an 
unresolved HNO3 "continuum" in this region has also been 
noted in laboratory studies [Brockman et '''••1978]. 1 he 
HNO3 reference mixing ratio profile of Smith [1982] has been 
assumed in the analysis. The effective instrument line shape 
function has been determined from fittings of O3 lines near 
780 cm"' These lines show an asymmetric shape in the data

indicating residual instrumental distortions. Radiosonde 
soundings from the south pole on the date of the measure- 
ments have been used to define the atmospheric pressure- 
temperature profiles. 

Fittings to the 867.0 to 870.0 cm"' and 871.75 to 874.50 
cm"' regions were run and found to yield total column 
amounts consistent to 10%. The average results and their 
estimated total absolute uncertainties (1 sigma) are 1.6 (0.3) 
X 10'* molecules cm"'^ for the December 1980 spectra and 
1.4(0.4) X 10'* molecules cm"^ for the November 1986 data. 
The two measurements agree within the combined total 
uncertainties. The sources of error and the estimated uncer- 
tainty in the HNO3 total vertical column amount resulting 
from each are (1) uncertainty due to instrument effects 
(noise, channel spectra, line shape distortions, and zero level 
shifts) (±10% in the 1980 data and ±20% in the 1986 data), 
(2) uncertainty in the assumed HNO3 relative mixing ratio 
distribution (±5%), (3) uncertainty in the assumed HNO3 
hne intensities (±15%), (4) uncertainty in the assumed 
HNO3 air-broadened half-widths and their temperature de- 
pendences (±5%), and (5) uncertainty in the assumed pres- 
sure-temperature profile (±5%). 

As a check on the analysis method used in this study, a 
solar spectrum recorded on July 10, 1976, at 0.06 cm"' 
resolution from Mt. Evans near Denver, Colorado (elevation 
4.3 km) by the University of Denver atmospheric sciences 
group and a solar spectrum (G. M. Stokes, Battelle Obser- 
vatory, private communication, 1984) recorded on October 
6, 1982, at 0.005 cm"' resolution with the McMath Fourier 
transform spectrometer on Kitt Peak (31.9°N latitude, 
111.6°W longitude, elevation 2095 m) were fitted in the 870 



cm"' region to retrieve the HNO3 total vertical column 
amounts. The derived values, 0.98 (0.20) x 10'* molecules 
cm"^ from the Mt. Evans spectrum and 1.0 (0.2) x 10'* 
molecules cm"^ from the Kitt Peak spectrum, are within the 
range of previous measurements obtained near the same 
latitudes (see below). 

A number of surveys have measured the latitudinal vari- 
ation of the total vertical column amount of HNO3, although 
only a few of these studies include measurements in the 
southern hemisphere. Figure 2 shows the northern and 
southern hemisphere survey results included in a recent 
assessment document [WMO, 1986] along with the present 
measurements at 90°S. Also included are total column 
amounts [Gille et al., 1984] inferred from profiles obtained 
by the limb infrared monitor of the stratosphere (LIMS) 
experiment aboard the Nimbus 7 satellite and the measure- 
ments of Williams et al. [1982], the only total column 
amounts obtained south of 64°S latitude. The latter results, 
which agree very well with the LIMS total columns in the 
range of overlapping measurements (48°S to 64°), were 
derived from analysis of aircraft emission spectra with a 
band model and indicate a rapid latitudinal increase from 1.2 
(0.2) x 10'* molecules cm"^ at 53°S to 3.4 (0.7) x 10'* 
molecules cm"^ at 89°S during the second half of November 
in 1978. The south pole spectra were recorded at nearly the 
same time of year in 1980 and 1986 but yield total vertical 
column amounts nearly a factor of 2 lower than the corre- 
sponding value from the Williams et al. [1982] study. Be- 
cause of the diflference in the measurement techniques 
(emission versus absorption), methods of analysis (band 
model versus line-by-line and spectral least squares), it is 
likely that systematic sources of error may contribute to this 
diflference. 

Analysis of NO Observations 

The well-isolated nitric oxide lines at 1857.275 cm"' and 
1914.990 cm ' were utilized in fittings of a spectrum re- 
corded on November 28, 1986. These lines, which have been 
used in previous studies of spectra recorded with balloon- 
borne and aircraft-borne interferometers [Murcray et al., 
1980; Blatherwick et al., 1980; Coffey et al., 1981], are 
relatively weak in the present data set with maximum 
absorptions of less than 10%. 

Assuming the line parameters of the 1986 HITRAN com- 
pilation [Rothman et al., 1987] and the reference vertical 
distribution of Smith [1982], total vertical column amounts of 
5.42 x 10'^ and 5.27 x 10" molecules cm"^ are derived from 
the 1857.275 and 1914.990 cm"' lines, respectively. The 
mean value, 5.34 x 10" molecules cm"^, is estimated to be 
accurate to about 12%. The NO line widths are narrower 
than those of nearby CO2 and H2O lines; tests assuming 
diflferent NO vertical distributions indicate that most of the 
NO column resides about the tropopause. 

Latitude surveys of NO total column amounts are sum- 
marized in Figure 10-21 of WMO Report 16 [WMO, 1986]. 
These show a small amount of data in the southern hemi- 
sphere and none at high southern latitudes. The northern 
hemisphere data shows no indication of a latitudinal gradi- 
ent, however the small number of observations coupled with 
the scatter in the values make it difficult to draw any definite 
conclusions. The values reported by Girard et al. [1979] of 6 
x 10" molecules cm"^ at the equator and 4 x 10" molecules 
cm"^ at 50°S were derived for the total column above 1 1 km

Figure 13 of Giile et al. [1984]. The November 1976 latitude survey mission results were reposed by Girarrf [1979]. 
STRATOZ 1 and STRATOZ U results were reported by Girard el al. [1980] and Girard et al. [1983], respectively. 



with no measurable difference at sunrise and sunset. Our 
south pole column is slightly higher than the 60°S value of 
Girard et al. [1983], but additional measurements are needed 
before a reliable latitude trend can be established for NO in 
the southern hemisphere. 

Analysis of NOj Observations 

The NO2 feature at 2914.65 cm"', a composite of several 
closely spaced transitions of the vi + v, band, was selected 
for the quantitative analysis assuming the 1986 HITRAN line 
parameters [Rothman et al., 1987]. This feature is weak (less 
than 5% absorption) but well isolated in the present spectra. 
It has been used in previous ground-based studies of atmo- 
spheric NO2 [Camy-Peyret et al., 1983; Flaud et al., 1983]. 
Assuming the reference vertical distribution oi Smith [1982], 
a value of 8.03 (0.96) x 10'^ molecules cm'- is estimated for 
the total vertical column amount on December 3, 1986. 

In all previous ground-based spectra, the intense 1/3 band 
of NO2 near 6 fim is unobservable because of overiapping 
strong absorption by H20. In the south pole data the reduced 
H2O amounts allow the identification of several isolated v^ 
band NO2 features. However, because these lines occur in 
the wings of strong H2O lines, they are less favorable for 
quantitative analysis than the 3 /j.m features. Recently, it has 
been shown that both the 3 /i.m and 6 ixm. NO2 bands yield 
consistent quantitative results [Coffey et al., 1986]. 

Measurements of the vertical column of daytime NO2 
versus latitude are summarized in Figures 10-22 of WMO 
Report 16 [WMO, 1986]. This assessment incudes three sets 
of southern hemisphere spring measurements, but all were 
obtained north of 50°S. A more valid comparison is possible 
with the visible absorption total columns measured at Syowa 
Station (69.0°S, 39.6°E) in Antarctica [Shibasaki et al.. 



1986]. The results of Shibasaki et al. show seasonal variation 
with a winter minimum of 1 x 10'* molecules cm"^ and a 
summer maximum of 7 x lO" molecules cm'^ Keys and 
Johnston [1986] find a similar seasonal variation of total 
column NO2 at Arrival Heights, Antarctica. Measurements 
in eariy December 1984 [Shibasaki et al., 1986] indicate a 
total column of about 6.8 x 10" molecules cm -, slightly 
lower than our south pole results. 

Discussion 

The column amounts reported here were obtained after 
the ozone "hole" had disappeared over the south pole. Low 
readings of the total ozone were observed with the south 
pole Dobson instrument until November 15, 1986. While the 
data were obtained after the hole disappeared they are close 
enough in time that some residual eflfects may be present in 
the data. The data when compared with other data sets 
obtained earlier at the south pole or at other sites at lower 
latitudes show a number of interesting features. The first is 
the change in HNO3 column amount between 1978 and 1980. 
As noted in the discussion, the measurements were made 
using different techniques which may result in some system- 
atic errors; however, other tests indicate that these, if 
present, are small. 

The column amounts for both NO and NO2 are higher than 
observed at low latitudes. This is not unexpected, since, as 
was emphasized by Farman et al. [1985] during the Antarctic 
summer (particulariy the south pole), there is no diurnal 
change and compounds such as N2O5 which are formed at 
night will not be present at concentrations present at lower 
latitudes. Thus the NO and NO2 will be present at higher 
levels. The NO2 observations at other Antarctic sites [Keys 
and Johnston, 1986; Shibasaki et al., 1986] show the buildup

in NO2 column as the hours of dayhght increases. As noted 
in the discussion, the NO2 results agree with other observa- 
tions; however, the NO results do not agree with the con- 
clusion reached by WMO [1986] that the NO column is con- 
stant with latitude at a value near 3 x I0" molecules cm -.

QUANTIFICATION OF HCl FROM HIGH RESOLUTION INFRARED SOLAR SPECTRA OBTAINED 

AT THE SOUTH POLE IN DECEMBER 1986 

A. Goldman, F.J. Murcray, F.H. Murcray, and D.G. Murcray

Abstract. - Ground-based infrared solar spectra 
at 0.02 cm~ resolution obtained at the Amundsen- 
Scott South Pole station in December 1986 have 
been analysed for the atmospheric content of HCl. 
Nonlinear least-squares spectral fitting applied 
to the spectra yields a total HCl column amount 
of (6.4 + 0.8)xl0 molec/cm , most being strato- 
spheric. This amount is larger than that extrap- 
olated from earlier results on the latitudinal 
distribution of atmospheric HCl. 



This Letter reports the determination of HCl 
total column amount above the South Pole, from 
ground based solar spectra observations made at 
the Amundsen-Scott station (altitude 2.85km) in 
December 1986, by F.J.M. and F.H. M. The spectra 
were recorded with a 0.02 cm" resolution Michel- 
son type interferometer, the same system used to 
record many balloon-borne, ground based and lab- 
oratory spectra by the University of Denver atmo- 
spheric spectroscopy group. The South Pole solar 
spectra were obtained during November 26 - Decem- 
ber 3, 1986 and covered large portions of the 3- 
15 pm region. The nearly constant solar zenith 
angle allowed the co-adding of several spectral 
scans from a single day for Improved signal to 
noise ratio. The data analysis methods and spec- 
troscopic data base used are similar to those 
used previously [Goldman et al., 1983, Goldman et 
al., 1986], applying nonlinear least-squares 
spectral fitting for the quantification of HCl. 
Radiosonde ascents from the South Pole (kindly 
provided by NOAA, Boulder, Colorado) were used to 
establish the atmospheric temperature-pressure 
profiles. 

Figure 1 shows a typical analysis of the 2923- 
2929 cm" region, which Is dominated by strong 
CH. lines with some weak H2O lines, surrounding 
the quite isolated H-^^Cl Rl line at 2925.9 cm" . 
For the present analysis, the CH^ line parameters 
were updated [Rothman et. al., 1987], but for 
consistency of comparisons with other recent 
studies, the previous HCl line parameters were 
retained (however, the updated HCl parameters 
lead to only 1% decrease in the column amount). 
The residual phase distortions, not fully 
accounted for by the fitted synthetic spectrum, 
required a more specific fitting for the H^^Cl Rl 
line over a narrower interval. This is present- 
ed in Figure 2, which also shows a small asymmet- 
ry in the spectral profile (probably due to 
Incomplete adjustment of the Instrument). The 
narrow interval analysis (with larger weight 
assigned to the high wavejiumber half of the line) 



yields a total HCl column amount of (6.4 ± 
0.8)xl0 molec/cm, most of which is 
stratospheric, as concluded from spectral fit- 
tings with various HCl and temperature-pressure 
profiles [Goldman et. al., 1986]. The HCl in 
these spectra being mostly stratospheric could 
have been expected for a high observation point 
in a low tropopause region such as the south 
pole. However, the sensitivity of the current 
spectra (at 0.02 cm" resolution and a single 
solar zenith angle) to the altitude distribution 
of HCl is limited [Goldman et. al., 1983]. 
Several other HCl lines are quite isolated oti the 
South Pole spectra, such as the Rl and P2 H CI 
lines, and these lead to practically the same HCl 
column amounts. The complete set of the South 
Pole solar spectra in the 3vm region, collected 
during the week of the measurements, shows no 
significant change in the HCl amounts. 

This is the first HCl measurement reported 
from the South Pole and is of particular Interest 
to current studies of the chemistry and dynamics 
of the Antarctic atmosphere. Previous measure-

at 70 N, with an extrapolated value of 3.4x--

[Girard et. al., 1983] of HCl column above 11.5km 
show values Increasing from 0.8x10 molec/cm at 
1°S to 2.7x10^^ molec/cm^ at 60°S, implying a 
symmetrical North-South distribution for these 
latitudes. While there are unresolved difficult- 
ies In assessing the tropospherlc HCl content and 
variability. It has been established that most of 
the HCl total column is stratospheric, and that 
it has been increasing with time, at an annual 
rate of 5% per year. 

The present result for the column amount of 
HCl above the South Pole is larger than the 
extrapolated values from the northern or southern 
latitude's results, even if we assume a temporal 
increase of 5Z per year as has been reported by 
Mankln et al [1983]. It is probably characteris- 
tic of the Antarctic atmosphere at the end of the 
period of the spring ozone depletion. 

Work is In progress on the quantification of 
several other atmospheric trace constituents 
observable in the 1986 South Pole Solar spectra 



reported here. Further measurements need to be 
made for monitoring HCl and other species during 
the ozone depletion periods.

Abstract . Solar absorption spectra from two 
stratospheric balloon flights have been analyzed 
for the presence of H2O2 and HOCl absorption in 
the 1230.0 to 1255-0 cm region. The data were 
recorded at 0.02 cm" resolution during sunset 
with the University of Denver interferometer 
system on October 27, 1978 and March 23, 1981. 
Selected spectral regions were analyzed with the 
technique of nonlinear least squares spectral 
curve fitting. Upper limits of 0.33 ppbv for H2O2 
and 0.36 ppbv for HOCJ, near 28 km are derived from 
the 1978 flight data while upper limits of 0.44 
ppbv for H2O2 and 0.43 ppbv for HOd at 29-5 km 
are obtained from the 1981 flight data. 

Introduction 

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is thought to play a 
significant role in the HOj^ chemical family where 
it acts as a reservoir and sink gas. The impor- 
tance of HOCi with respect to the diurnal varia- 
tion of CJ.0 in the upper stratosphere has recently 
been discussed by Ko and Sze [l984]. Several at- 
tempts have been made to detect H2O2. The most 
recent is an upper limit of 0.05 ppbv at 26.5 Icm 
from spectra obtained with a Fourier transform 
spectrometer operating in the far-infrared [Chance 
and Traub, 1984]. A tentative measurement of 1.1 
ppbv from 27 to 35 km has been reported by Waters 
et al. [l98l] from the emission of H2O2 at 204.574 
GHZ. Analysis of infrared solar absorption 
spectra obtained with a grating spectrometer 
yielded an upper limit of 1.0 ppbv at 20 km for 
H2O2 [Murcray et al., 1978]. No measurements or 
attempted measurements of HOCi have been reported 
to our knowledge. Clearly, additional 
observations are needed to expand the measurement 
data sets of these two species. This paper 
describes the analysis carried out to derive upper 
limit profiles for H2O2 and HOCl from infrared 
solar spectra obtained during two stratospheric 
balloon flights. 

Observations and Spectral Analysis 

Spectra were recorded at 0.02 cm" resolution 
with a Michelson interferometer during two balloon 
flights from Alamogordo, NM (32.8°H, 106.0°W) on 
October 27, 1978 and March 23, 1981 from float 
altitudes of 39-1 km and 33-5 km, respectively. 
Selected flight spectra have been published in an 
atlas along with the positions and identifications 
of the atmospheric and solar features [Goldman et 



Copyright 19S5 by the American Geophysical Union. 

Paper number 5L6634 
OO9'l-S275/85/CO5L-6634$03.O0 



al., 1985]. For each flight, a sequence of scans 
obtained during sunset was selected for analysis 
to provide altitude coverage from the balloon 
float altitude down to approximately 23 km. 
The spectral data were analyzed with the 
technique of nonlinear least squares curve fitting 
[cf., Goldman et al., 1980]. There are several 
advantages in using this technique in an upper 
limit study. Since the profiles of the major 
absorbers can be obtained from the fitting 
process, the contribution of the weak interfering 
lines of these gases can be properly included in 
the analysis. The analysis also defines the 
background level, the noise level of the spectrum, 
and the effective instrument line shape. 

National Meteorological Center pressure- 
temperature profiles were assumed in the ray- 
tracing calculations. Mixing ratios of CH^, N2O 
and CO2 were included as unknowns in the fitting 
procedure. To simulate the absorption of H2O2 the 
30°S profile for April (equivalent to September, 
30°N) from Miller et al. [1981 ] was multiplied by 
a factor of 3.1 to yield a peak mixing ratio of 
0.64 ppbv near 33 km. 

Except as noted below, the line parameters were 
taken from the 1982 AFGL compilations [Rothman et 
al., 1983a, b]. Recent laboratory measurements of 
air-broadened CH^ half-widths [c. Rinsland, 
unpublished data, 1984] and the positions and 
intensities of weak hot band and CHjD lines [L. 
Brown, private communication, 1984] have been 
added to the set of line parameters. The H2O2 
line intensities in the AFGL compilation were 
multiplied by 0.78 to account for hot bands which 
were present in the room temperature integrated 
intensity measurements of Valero et al. [l98l] but 
not included in the normalization of the relative 
intensities [j. Hillman, private communication, 
1985]. Estimates of the line parameter uncertain- 
ties are developed in a following section. 

The selection of the 1230.0 to 1255.0 cm"' 
region for analysis was baaed on a tradeoff 
between maximizing the expected absorption of H2O2 
and HOCl and minimizing the interference from CH^, 
NpO and C02» Narrow window regions covering the 
stronger features of both gases were identified 
and are listed in Table 1. These regions were 
first surveyed for the presence of H2O2 or H0C8. by 
comparing the fits obtained with and without 
simulated absorption of these gases. From these 
results, a single region for each gas was selected 
for detailed study from which the altitude 
dependent upper limit was derived. The line 
parameters for the spectral features used in each 
region are listed in Table 2. 

Figure 1 shows the fitting results for the 
93.6° scan (1978 flight) with the mixing ratio of 
HpOp set to zero in all layers. The observed 
spectrum has been normalized to the highest

intensity in the region. The line identifications 
[Goldman et al., 1985] are indicated. The two 
weak features indicated with question marks per- 
sist over several scans and are also present in 
the 1981 flight spectra. They appear to be real 
and not noise but identification of these features 
has not yet been possible. The standard deviation 
of the fit is 0.44?. The larger amplitude 
residuals are due to minor inadequacies in the 
modeling of the instrument line shape and the 
complex channel spectra present in the data. 
Figure 2 shows a fit in the same region except 
that HoOj absorption has been simulated using the 
scaled H2O2 mixing ratio profile. The background 
level and slope and the amplitude, period and 
phase of the channel spectra were constrained to 
the values obtained from the fit without H2O2 
absorption. The simulated H2O2 absorption 
features (arrows) are clearly above the noise 
level. Analysis of the other window regions for 
the 1978 flight yielded similar results. Co- 
incidences between very weak spectral features and 
the simulated HjOj absorption occurred occasional- 
ly in both data sets but identification of a con- 
sistent series of HjOj lines was not possible. 

The altitude dependent mixing ratio upper limit 
is derived as follows. For each scan a known 
column amount of H2O2 is placed in the tangent 
layer and the fit repeated. The H2O2 column 
amount is then adjusted to reduce the depth of the 
simulated H2O2 absorption to the local peak-to- 
peak noise level. To illustrate this procedure 
horizontal dashed lines are drawn on the residual 
plot of Figure 1 near the strongest HjO, feature 
to define the peak-to-peak noise level (-0^%). 
The H2O2 residual in Figure 2 is almost 2.0% so 
the H2O2 column amount would have to be decreased 
by a factor of 2.5 in this example to reduce the 
depth of the H2O2 absorption to the peak-to-peak 
noise level. Note that this procedure is equiva- 
lent to requiring the H2O2 feature to have a depth 
of 4 times the standard deviation (a) of the local 
noise. We feel that this procedure produces a 



TABLE 2. Spectral Line Parameters 
Adopted in This Study 



conservative upper limit since an absorption 
feature greater than 4a could be positively 
detected in most cases. An upper limit average 
mixing ratio for each scan is calculated by 
assuming the entire H2O2 absorber amount is 
contained in a 5-km thick tangent layer. To 
account for experimental uncertainties, the 
estimated error shown in Table 3 has been added 
to the average mixing ratio value to obtain the 
final upper limit estimate. The resulting upper 
limit profile for the 1978 flight is plotted m 
Figure 3 at the ainnass-weighted effective 
altitudes for the 5-km thick layers. Figure 3 
also contains the upper limit profile derived from 
the 1981 flight data. Although the noise level in 
these spectra is slightly lower than that in the 
1978 flight data, this improvement is offset by a 
slightly degraded instrument resolution. 

The same analysis procedure was carried out for 
HOC! using the spectral regions listed in Table 
1. As with H2O2, the simulated HOCl absorption 
lines occasionally coincided with weak spectral 
features, but we were unable to positively detect 
HOCl. The inferred upper limit profiles are shown 
in Figure 4. The noise levels in all scans but 
one are similar to those found in the noisiest 
scan in the H2O2 region. This decreased 
sensitivity tends to cancel the improvement 
expected from the greater HOCil intensities, 
overall effect results in H0C2. upper limit 
profiles similar to those for H202-

Tentative Identification of the 780-cm~^ v^ Band Q Branch of Chlorine 
Nitrate in High-Resolution Solar Absorption Spectra of the Stratosphere 

C. p. RiNSLAND,' A. Goldman," D. G. Murcray,- F. J. Murcray,- F. S. Bonomo,- R. D.

Absorption by the Q branch of the v^ band of ClONO: at 780.2 cm" ' has been tentatively identified 
in a series of 0.02-cm~ '-resolution balloon-borne solar absorption spectra of the stratosphere. The 
spectral data were recorded at sunset from a float altitude of 33.5 km during a balloon flight from 
Holloman Air Force Base (32.8''N. I06.0°W) near Alamogordo, New Mexico, on March 23. 1981. A 
preliminary ClONOi vertical profile has been determined from the stratospheric spectra by using the 
technique of nonlinear least squares spectral curve fitting and new spectroscopic parameters deduced 
from high-resolution laboratory spectra of CIONO2 and O,. 



Introduction 

Models of the photochemistry of the stratosphere predict 
that chlorine nitrate (ClONO:) is an important temporary 
reservoir of stratospheric chlorine. At night, CIO is believed 
to combine in a three-body reaction with NO2 to form 
chlorine nitrate. During daylight, chlorine nitrate is de- 
stroyed by photolysis to form free chlorine and NO3. 

As a technique, infrared spectroscopy has the potential to 
provide important quantitative measurements of strato- 
spheric chlorine nitrate. Laboratory measurements have 
shown that relatively strong Q branches of CIONO2 occur at 
780, 809, 1292, and 1738 cm"' [Miller etal., 1967; Graham et 
al., 1977; Murcray and Goldman, 1981; Murcray et at., 
1984]. Evidence for absorption by the 1292-cm"' Q branch 
has been reported on the basis of analysis of a series of 0.02- 
cm"'-resolution balloon-borne stratospheric solar absorp- 
tion spectra recorded during sunset fropi a float altitude of 
39.1 km [Murcray et al., 1979]. The 780-cm"' spectral region 
was covered at a resolution of 0.2 cm"' during an earlier 
balloon flight [Williams et al., 1976]. Ozone and carbon 
dioxide have many absorption lines in this spectral region, 
and under the spectral resolution achieved on that flight, it 
was not possible to separate absorption that might be due to 
CIONO2 from absorption by interfering lines [Murcray et al., 
1977]. Since that time, additional laboratory spectra of 
CIONO2 and O3 and new stratospheric solar absorption spec- 
tra have been recorded that cover the 780-cm'"' region at 
higher resolution. In the present paper we report a detailed 
study of these spectra that has lead to the tentative identifi- 
cation of the 1-4 band Q branch of CIONO2 as a significant 
contributor to the observed stratospheric absorption near 
780.21 cm"'.

Laboratory Spectra 

Several samples of chlorine nitrate were given to the 
University of Denver in 1976 by L. C. Glasgow of E. I. 
DuPont de Nemours and Co. These samples were prepared 
by reaction of CUO with N2O3 at low temperature (typically 
starting at -78°C and slowly heating to 0°C in 15 hours) 
[Schmeisser, 1967] and were purified by trap-to-trap distilla- 
tions. A cold trap at -78°C eliminated HNO3, NO2, and 
N2O3, and a cold trap at -118°C eliminated CI2 (L. C. 
Glasgow, private communication, 1976) [Zahniser et al., 
1977; Kurylo, 1977]. Analysis of the samples by IR, UV, and 
mass spectroscopy showed the purity to be greater than 
99%, with the principal contaminant being NO-. [Birks et al., 
1977]. 

Upon receipt of the CIONO2 (in a stainless steel cylinder), 
it >vas kept at - 196°C with liquid nitrogen until ready for use. 
The entire sample was transferred by wanning the cylinder 
to -84T (ethyl acetate slush bath), passing the CIONO2 
vapor through a -lie'C trap (ethyl bromide slush), and 
freezing in a glass trap at - 196°C under high vacuum. All of 
the glass was flamed out whenever CIONO2 was to be 
handled in the vacuum system. Cells and the glass vacuum' 
system were conditioned with CIONO2 at several torts 
pressure for 10-15 min, followed by pumping to high vacu- 
um, and repeating this procedure if it was felt to be neces- 
sary. 

If the sample was stored for prolonged periods ( 1 year or 
more) or had been thawed and refrozen many times, it was

measured either with a slush of cyclopentanone at -51.3°C, 
where CIONO2 has a vapor pressure of 13 torr. or with ethyl 
acetate at -84°C, where ClONO: has a vapor pressure of 1.5 
torr. The chlorine nitrate was so stable in storage and 
handling that this occasional distillation was adequate to 
keep the sample pure. 

Infrared cell windows for ClONOj were AgCl, NaCl, or 
CaF:, of which the latter two were least affected by the 
sample. So long as the cell and vacuum system were kept 
absolutely dry by pumping and flame desiccation, ClONO: 
could be kept in the cell for many hours with little deteriora- 
tion. This stability of anhydrous ClONO: has been noted by

been modeled as a channel spectrum with the expressions 
derived by Niple et al. [1980]. However, since the amplitude 
of the modulation increases with ClONO: pressure, it may 
be due at least in part to unresolved weaker ClONO: 
absorption. No modulation was detected in the background 
of the 0.5-torr scan. Plots of the 750-840 cm ' and 1250- 
1330 cm"' intervals of the l.5-torr and 3.1-torr scans are 
contained in a compilation of high-resolution infrared spec- 
tra of atmospheric interest [Miircray et al.. 1984). 

Unfortunately, line positions and assignments have not 
been reported for the 1-4 band of ClONO:. For this reason we 
were forced to adopt an empirical model to analyze the 
laboratory measurements. The unresolved shape in the Q 
branch region is simple, and after trying a number of 
empirical forms, a good fit to the data was obtained by using 
a model with only four adjustable parameters. The values of 
these parameters have been determined from the analysis of 
the data with the technique of nonlinear least squares 
spectral curve fitting. From these results a listing of parame- 
ters for "artificial" ClONO. lines has been generated for use 
in the analysis of the stratospheric spectra. 

We have assumed that the absorption by the V4 band Q 
branch can be represented by a series of evenly spaced Voigt 
lines with an exponential distribution of intensities. The 
position v (cm'') of line n has been calculated from

Figure 1 shows the 779.0-781.0 cm ' region of laboratory 
spectra obtained with CIONO2 pressures of 0.5, 1.5. and 3.1 
ton- in a 5-cm cell. The spectral data were recorded at room 
temperature and at 0.02-cm'' resolution with the same 
Fourier transform interferometer used to obtain the strato- 
spheric spectra. Even at the high resolution and low pres- 
sures of these measurements, the Q branch is unresolved but 
considerably broader than the width of the instrumental line 
shape function. The Q branch feature is cleariy asymmetric: 
the absorption decreases more rapidly on the high wave 
number side of the peak than on the low wave number side. 
Additional spectra obtained with a new interferometer at 
0.004-cm"' resolution also do not show any fine structure 
within the O branch. The background in the 1.5-torr and 3.1- 
torr scans show a sinusoidal modulation in this interval with 
a period of =1.3 cm"'. In the analysis this modulation has

In (3), ^0 corresponds to the position of the absorption peak 
of the ClONO: Q branch. The values of fo, S^.A. and B have 
been derived from the least squares fits. Since neither 
quantum assignments nor measurements of the temperature 
dependence of the absorption are available, an arbitrary 
value of 300 cm"' has been adopted for the lower state 
energy of all lines. Runs were made with Lorentz half-widths 
■yoofO.I and 0.2 cm"' atm"' at 296 K to study the sensitivity 
of the results to the assumed half-width. 

The analysis of the laboratory spectra with the technique 
of nonlinear least squares spectral curve fitting followed the 
procedures described in previous papers [Goldman et al., 
1980; Rinsland el al., 1983a]. In the present work a subrou- 
tine was added to the analysis program to generate a line list 
from values for i\,. 5v, A, and B. These four parameters and 
two parameters for the background level and slope were 
adjusted simultaneously in fitting the 182 measured intensi- 
ties between 779.0 and 781.0 cm"'. For the 1.5 and 3.1 torr 
scans, parameters for the amplitude and phase of the channel 
spectrum were added; the period was held fixed at 1.3 cm"' 
in the analysis. The Fourier transform technique [cf. Siple et 
al., 1980] has been used to convolve the infinite resolution 
transmittances with the instrument line shape function.

tory spectrum and the least squares best fit to the data. The

intensity in the fitted region. Therms residual is 0.3% for this 
scan. The fits are slightly poorer for the 1.5-torr and 3.1 -torr 
scans. The rms residuals for these spectra are 0.5% and 
0.9%, respectively. The fit to the 3.1-torr scan is shown in 
Figure 3. As can be seen from this plot, the calculated 
spectrum slightly underestimates the absorption in the stron- 
gest part of the Q branch. For all three scans the rms residual 
of the fit was the same for assumed Lorentz half-widths of 
0.1 and 0.2 cm"' atm"' at 296 K. 

Table 1 presents the parameters derived from the fits to 
the three laboratory scans, assuming half-widths yo of 0.1 
and 0.2 cm"' atm"' at 296 K for all lines and that the 
measured pressure is due entirely to ClONOi. Also listed is 
the sum of individual line intensities 5,oi. For the three scans 
the parameter values derived from the fits are nearly inde- 
pendent of the assumed half-width. The agreement between 
the values determined from the 0.5-torr and 1.5-torr scans is 
quite good, but slightly lower values for S„ and S,ot were 
obtained from the analysis of the 3.1-torr scan. This differ- 
ence is believed to result from the inadequacies in the simple 
model used to analyze the laboratory spectra and possibly 
from the decay of CIONO: in the sample. Nitric acid was 
observed as a decomposition product in the 3.1-torr scan. 
The positions of HNO3 features in the 865-875 cm"' region 
were measured from this scan and compared to calibrated 
positions from the University of Denver Atlas of Strato- 
spheric Absorption Spectra [Goldman et al., 1983a]. The 
average of the differences between the observed and refer- 
ence positions was used as a calibration factor for the 
determination of i^ for this scan. Absorption by HNO3 was 
not detected in the 0.5-torr scan and is very weak in the 1 .5- 
torr scan. The values of v^ listed for these two scans are 
uncalibrated. 

Because of sample impurities, the values of 5v and 5,ot in 
Table 1 are lower limits. To obtain an estimate of the partial 
pressure of HNO3, the HNO3 features identified in the 3.1- 
torr spectrum were analyzed with the technique of nonlinear 
least squares spectral curve fitting. A HNO3 volume mixing 
ratio of 0.04 ± 0.01 was derived from a fit to the 867.0-870.0 
cm"' region with the line parameters generated by Goldman 
et al. [1984]. Absorption by HNO3 is miich weaker in the 1.5- 
torr scan. A volume mixing ratio of 0.03 ± 0.015 was 
estimated for this spectrum from the absorption depth of the 
vs band Q branch at 879 cm"'. An upper limit of 0.10 for the 
HNO3 volume mixing ratio in the 0.5-torr spectrum was 
estimated from the same spectral region. No other contami- 
nants have been identified in the 750-1300 cm"' region 
covered by these spectra. However.similar laboratory spec- 
tra of CIONO2 covering -the -1200-^2000 cm"' regionshow 
absorption by the .v^ band of NO2 near.1600 cm" ' . Also, it is 
important, to -note that contaminants with only weak or 
diffuse bands in the intervals covered in the laboratory 
spectra would not be identified. 

We compared the peak absorptivity {a = In UijDIpD 
derived from our laboratory spectra (assuming pure CIONO; 
samples) with the values measured by Graham et al. [1977] 
after they corrected for the decay of CIONO:. The values 
measured from our 0.5-torr, 1.5-torr, and 3.1-torr scans are 
38, 35, and 28 cm"' atm"' at STP, respectively. The lower 
value for the 3.1-torr scan probably results from the difficul- 
ty in determining the background (100% transmission) level 
caused by the stronger absorption of CIONO: if that spec- 
trum. The absorptivities derived by Graham et al. are a

Strong function of the resolution of the measurements. At the 
highest resolution (0.0625 cm"') a value of 49 cm"' atm"' at 
STP was determined for pure CIONO2. This result is about 
25% higher than our values. In assessing this difference it 
should be noted that Graham et al. assign an uncertainty of 
25% to their results and that our measurements were ob- 
tained at a resolution of 0.02 cm"'. The integrated intensity 
obtained in the present study is considerably larger than that 
derived from earlier spectra obtained at the University of 



Denver [Murcray et al.. 1977). This difference is believed to 
result from an unrecognized contaminant in the samples 
used in the previous analysis.

measurements was generated from natural oxygen by using 
the silent electric discharge technique [cf. Meunier et al., 
1982]. In the present analysis, spectra obtained with total 
pressures of 8. 1 torr and 23.2 torr in a 50-cm absorption path 
have been analyzed. Because of the problem of ozone 
decomposition, only relative intensities and line positions 
have been derived from the data. For both scans a signal-to- 
rms noise ratio in the 780-cm"' region of =500 was achieved 
with an integration time of 1 hour. 

The 779.0-782.0 cm"' region was covered by analyzing 
consecutive segments 1 cm"' wide with the technique of 
nonlinear least squares spectral curve fitting. Starting values 
for the ozone positions and intensities were obtained from 
the 1982 Air Force Geophysics Laboratory (AFGL) line 
parameters compilation [Rothman et al., 1983a]. These 
parameters were calculated as described by Goldman et al. 
[1982]. Lines with absorption depths at line center of less 
than =1% of the background intensity were included in the 
calculations but with position and intensity values fixed to 
those listed in the 1982 AFGL compilation. For the 23.2-torr 
scan this criterion corresponds to an intensity value of about 
2.0 X 10"^'' cm"'/molecule cm"- at 296 K. A self-broadened 
half-width of 0. 1 15 cm"' atm"' at 296 K was assumed for.the 
weakerOi lines."; This -value is Ithejaverage of 22ineasiire- 
ments obtained in the 3- and 5-^m regions by Meunier et al. 
[1982]. The half-widths of the stronger lines were included as 
free parameters in the analysis. 

Table 2 presents the line positions and relative intensities 
derived from the analysis of the 23.2-torr scan. The identifi- 
cations are based on the comparisons of the measured 
positions and intensities with values in the 1982 AFGL 
compilation [Rothman et al.. 1983a]. The line positions have 
been calibrated with respect to accurate NjO line positions 
in the 1255-1282 cm"' region from the tables of Olson et al. 
[1981]. For the stronger unblended lines the positions deter- 
mined from the 8.1-torr and 23.2-torr spectra agree to 
=0.00015 cm"'. The accuracy of the positions decreases 
with line intensity and is estimated to be =0.003 cm"' for the

at 780.6505 cm"' is observed to be much stronger than 
inciicated by the 1982 AFGL compilation. Perhaps, this 
difference is due to an overlapping line from an unassigned 
hot band. The line widths measured from the 23.2-torr scan 
are only slightly larger than the width of the instrument line 
shape function; for this reason the self-broadened widths 
derived from this spectrum are believed to be not very 
accurate and are not reported. 

The weak O3 line at 780.2148 cm"' occurs close to the 
position of the strongest absorption by CIONO2. When the 
23.2-torr laboratory spectrum is plotted on an expanded 
vertical scale, there is an indication that this line is blended 
with about a factor of 2 weaker, unassigned O3 line centered 
near 780.206 cm"'. This weaker feature is near the noise 
level of the present data; higher signal to noise and increased 
resolution are needed to determine if this weaker Oj line is 
real. 

Figure 4 shows the agreement obtained in the 780.0-781.0 
cm"' region between the 23.2-torr laboratory and best-fit 
calculated spectra. As in Figure 3 the residuals (observed- 
calculated) in the upper panel are expressed as a percentage 
of the maximum intensity measured in the region. The rms 
residual is 0.35%, very close to the noise level of the data. 
Similar results were obtained from the fits to the 779.0-780.0 
cm"' and 781.0-782.0 cm"' regions. 

Stratospheric Spectra and Analysis 

The stratospheric solar absorption spectra analyzed in this 
work were recorded during sunset with a Micheison-type 
Fourier transform interferometer with an apodized FWHM 
(full width at half maximum) resolution of 0.02 cm"'. The 
balloon flight was performed from HoUoman Air Force Base 
near Alamogordo, New Mexico, on March 23, 1981. Table 3 
summarizes important flight and experimental parameters 
and their estimated uncertainties. 

Figure 5 shows the'779.0-782.0.cm"' interval in baUoon 
flight spectra recorded under 1 high sun and low sun condi- 
tions and in the 0.5-torr laboratory spectrum of CIONO2. 
The solar and atmospheric features identified in the strato- 
spheric spectra are marked beneath one of the scans and are 
repeated and numbered at top. Table 4 lists the correspond- 
ing line positions and identifications. These identifications 
are based on comparisons between the observed spectra and 
simulated spectra generated with the line parameters and 
vertical profiles discussed below and on the agreement 
between the measured and reference line positions. An 
arrow beneath the low sun stratospheric scans indicates the 
feature corresponding in position to the strongest absorption 
by the ^4 band Q branch of ClONO:. Based on the consider- 



ations discussed in this section, we tentatively identify this 
feature as a blend of ClONO.. CO2. and O3. The other 
identifications, except for a few minor changes, which result 
from comparisons of the balloon spectra with the new O3 
laboratory spectra, are from the University of Denver Atlas 
of Stratospheric Solar Absorption Spectra [Goldman et al., 

1983a]. 

Line positions and intensities for O3 were taken from the 
analysis of the Kitt Peak laboratory spectra. The transition- 
dependent air-broadened half-widths calculated recently for 
296 K by Gamache et al. [1984] were assumed in the analysis 
(R. R. Gamache, private communication, 1984). ForClONG: 
the line list was calculated with our simple empirical model 
assuming the values of A and B derived from fitting the 0.5- 
torr lab scan with yo = 0.1 cm"' atm"' at 296 K, 1.25 times 
the value of 5v derived from the same analysis (scaled to 
agree with the measurements of Graham et al. [1977]) and 
the average of the two calibrated values of t\) determined 
from the fit to the 3. 1-torr lab scan. Line parameters for CO2, 
NO-, and HCN were taken from the 1982 Air Force Geo-

physics Laboratory CAFGL) major and trace gas compila- 
tions [Rothman et al.. 1983g, b]. Several lines of solar OH 
have been identified in this spectral region [Goldman et al.. 
1983a]; their absorption has been simulated by assuming a 
Doppler line shape and the positions and intensities at 6000 
K calculated by Goldman et al. [1983ii]. The temperature 
dependence of the air-broadened half-width has been as- 
sumed to be 7—0 " for O3 [Colmont and Monnanteuil. 1984],

.A 12-layer model was adopted for the analysis of one high- 
sun (81.91') and si.x low-sun spectra. Isothermal layer 
boundaries were defined by the tangent altitudes of the 



refracted rays of the low sun scans (23.8, 27.0. 28.4, 29.6, 
30.6, and 33.2 km), the balloon float altitude (33.5 km), and 
selected points above the balloon (35, 40, 45, 50. 70, and 100 
km). The ray-tracing calculations were made with the 
FSCATM program from FASCODIB [Gallery et al.. 1983], 
assuming a correlative pressure-temperature profile derived 
from global satellite and radiosonde measurements (M. 
Gelman, private communication, 1982).

The vertical scaling for each gas is the same, but the 
calculated spectra have been displaced vertically for clarity. 
At bottom the calculated spectrum obtained with all gases is 
plotted at the same vertical scale. The average daytime 
CIONO2 profile from the model calculations of Miller et al. 
[1981] and a constant CO2 mixing ratio of 325 ppmv have 
been assumed. The profiles for other gases are from Smith 
[1982]. The absorption by CIONO2 is calculated to be 
considerably broader than the width of single lines. The 
CIONO2 absorption depth is computed to be 1 .5% at the 
strongest part of the Q branch. In this region the CIONO2 
absorption is overlapped by lines of CO? and O3. The COj 
line is the stronger of the two. and its position is 0.018 cm 
higher than the ClONO, peak at 780.213 cm"'. Absorption 
by NOi. HnO. and HCN is calculated to be negligible in this 
interval. 

Because of the overlapping absorption by CO: and O3, the 
region near the CIONO2 Vi band Q branch was analyzed with 
the technique of nonlinear least squares, spectral curve 
fitting. Details of the application of this procedure to the 
analysis of University of Denver stratospheric spectra have 

been descnbed in several previous publications [Niple et al.. 

1980; Goldman et al.. 1980: Rinsland et al.. 1982, 1983*]. In 



the present work a relatively wide interval (779.14-781.75 
cm"') has been included in the fit to improve the accuracy m 
establishing the background and to pennit the comparison of 
the quality of the fit within and away from the CIONO2 £ 
branch region. In addition to the CIONO2 profile, the O3 
profile was derived from the analysis. However, only the O, 
profile shape is well determined, since the assumed O3 Ime 
intensities are relative rather than absolute values. The 
profiles of CO2, HCN, H2O. andNOj were constramed to 
initial values. Additional parameters were included to model 
the background level and slope, weak channel spectra (with 
periods between 1.1 and 2.5 cm"'), and minor residual phase 
distortions in the instrument line shape. 

Figure 7 presents the fitting results obtained for the three 
lowest sun scans with (left panels) and without (right panels) 
ClONO, lines included in the analysis. The measured mtensi- 
ties have been normalized to the peak intensity in the fitted 
region. Arrows beneath the spectra and in the residual plots 
mark the position of the strongest absorption by ClONO:, as 
determined from the laboratory spectra. Without ClONO: 
lines the absorption in the Q branch region is underestimated 
in the calculated spectra, and a weak broad feature results in 
all three residual plots. The rms residuals without ClONO:

lines in the fit (top to bottohi) are 1.0%, 1.1%, and 1.7%. The 
fits with CIONO2 lines included in the analysis are consider- 
ably better in the CIONO2 Q branch region. The rms 
residuals with CIONO2 lines in the fit (top to bottom) are 
0.9%, 1.0%, and 1.4%. 

Figure 8 compares the 0.5-torr laboratory spectrum of 
CIONO2 and the residuals obtained for the 92.61° and 93.19° 
scans without CIONO2 lines in the analysis. Despite the 
difference in the temperature of the laboratory run (=22°C) 
and that of the stratosphere and the problem of the contribu- 
tion from the overlapping lines of CO2 and O3, there is fairly 
good agreement in both the position and shape of the broad 
feature in the residuals and the CIONO2 absorption in the 
laboratory spectrum. The large residuals near 780.36 cm"' 
result from errors in fitting a strong O3 line: note that these 
residuals have a sharper appearance than those of the broad 
feature. 

Since CO: and Oi lines are calculated to produce discern- 
ible absorption near the CIOXO; Q branch position, it is 
important to try to determine if errors in the parameters 
assumed for these lines could cause the large residuals noted 
in the fits. The overlapping carbon dio.xide line is R29 from 
the temperature-sensitive 12201-03301 band of '-C'*0:. To 
our knowledge there have not been anv recent measure- 



ments reported for this band. However, the position for this. 
line in the 1982 AFGL compilation should be accurate to 
0.001 cm"' or better, since the molecular constants for both 
the upper and lower levels have been derived from numerous 
experimental measurements [see Rothman et al., 1983a, 
Table II). The 1982 AFGL compilation lists three additional 
lines of this band in the fitted region: R28 at 779.508 cm"', 
R30 at 780.976 cm"', and R31 at 781.692 cm"'. The line 
positions measured from the stratospheric spectra agree with 
these Values to 0.001 cm"' for R28-and R31 and to 0.005 
cm"' for R30, which is blended withanother CO2 line of 
about the same intensity. Only weak O3 lines are listed near 
these line positions in the 1982 AFGL compilation [Rothman 
el al.. 1983a]. The new O3 lab spectra also do not show 
measurable O3 absorption in the vicinity of these CO; lines. 
Minor contamination of the R28and R3I lines by O3 is likely, 
however, since an atlas of 0.04-cm~' resolution laboratory 
spectra [Damon et al.. 1981] obtained with 40 times more O3 
in the path than used in the Kitt Peak experiment show 
absorption near the positions of both lines. Despite these 
limitations, the quality of the fits to all three of these CO2 
features in the stratospheric spectra suggests that this CO: 
band has been simulated fairly well in our analysis. Figure 9 
shows an example of a fit near the R31 line on an expanded

factor has been added to the wave numbers to convert from a

scale. An analysis of the CO2 bands in this region is planned 
(L. R. Brown, private communication, 1984). 

The overlapping O3 Une at 780.215 cm~' is very weak in 
our 23.2-torr laboratoi^ spectrum. To obtain an upper limit 
for its possible contribution to the absorption, the retrievals 
were repeated with the intensity of this line increased by a 
factor of 2. Figure 10 compares the residuals in the ClONO: 
region with and without the doubling of the O3 line intensity. 
No CIONO2 lines were included in the analysis. The changes 
in the residuals are very small, and thus we conclude that 
most of the absorption near .780.2 cm"! cannot be explained 

by O3. 

The stratospheric spectra were also analyzed assummg the 
O3 line parameters on the 1982 AFGL compilation [Rothman 
ei al.. 1983a]. These parameters produce considerably poor- 
er fits to the stratospheric spectra than those obtained with 
the values hsted in Table 2. An extensive analysis of the new 
O3 lab data is in progress. 

Of the seven scans analvzed. only the four with the largest 
zemth angles (92.03'. 9:.32\ 9:.6r. and 93.19=) show suffi- 
cient absorption to derive quantitative values for ClONO:. 
The 92.03' scan has been used to determine an average 
mixina ratio of 0.5 ppbv above the tangent altitude of 29.6 
km. The absorption is ver> weak, and the uncertainty of this

value is estimated to be ±80%. Values of 1.1, 1.0, and 0.9 
ppbv were retrieved from the 92.32°, 92.61°, and 93.19° 
scans, respectively. The uncertainties in these mixing ratios 
are estimated to be +60%. The uncertainties for all four 
measured values are total uncertainties, which include the 
effects of the dominant sources of error: (1) influence of 
instrument noise, (2) the uncertainty in the simulation of the 
overlapping CO2 and O3 absorption, (3) the uncertainty in 
the fit to the background level in the CIONO2 region, and (4) 
the uncertainty in the intensity and shape of the CIONO2 1-4 
band Q branch at stratospheric temperatures. 

As a check of the results, retrievals were also made using 
equivalent width measurements. Within the uncertaintiesthe 
mixing ratios inferred with this procedure were found to be 
consistent with the values determined from the least squares 
fits. For example an equivalent width of 0.00450 cm was 
measured for the 780.16-780.28 cm"' interval of the 92.61°

scan (tangent height of 27.0 km). The equivalent widths of 
the overlapping CO: and O3 lines are calculated to be 
0.00066 cm" ' and 0.000 16 cm "' , respectively. The difference 
between the measured equivalent width and the sum of the 
calculated CO: and O3 equivalent widths is 0.00371 cm"'. 
Using this difference together with an integrated intensity of 
1.38 X 10"" cm" '/molecule cm"- for ClONO: in this region 
and a total air mass of 2.83 x 10-' molecules cm"-, an 
average mixing ratio of 0.95 ppbv is obtained (assuming the 
absorption is on the linear part of the curve of growth). 

Discussion 

Our analysis has shown that an absorption feature ob- 
served near 780.227 cm"' in a sequence of stratospheric 
spectra is too strong and too broad to be attributed solely to 
known lines of CO: and O3. Although the additional absorp- 
tion coincides closely with the ClONO: ^-i band Q branch in 
position and shape, the identification must be regarded as 
tentative because of the following considerations: 

1. It was not possible to identify the 809-cm"' and 1292- 
cm"' bands of ClONO: in the same set of spectra. The 
relatively weak i^ fundamental at 809 cm"' falls in a short 
gap in the flight data caused by the real-time filter used with 
the University of Denver instrument. High-resolution labo- 
ratory spectra [Murcray and Goldman. 1981 ; Murcray et al., 
1984] indicate the in fundamental Q branch is considerably 
broader than the Q branches of the 1/3 and v^ bands. The ih 
strongest absorption extends over the 1291-1293 cm"' re- 
gion. This region was covered during a balloon flight made 
on October 27, 1978. A ClONOj profile was determined from 
those data based on the assumption that a broadband absorp- 
tion occurring in this region was due to CIONO2 [Murcray et 
al., 1979]. It should be emphasized that the 1292-cm"' band 
results were based on simple equivalent width estimates and 
the assumption that all the broadband absorption is due to 
CIONO2. Thus the ClONOj profile from this earlier flight is 
not on as firm a spectroscopic basis as the current analysis. 
A complete analysis of the 1292-cm"' region has not been 
performed because of the lack of suitable spectroscopic 
parameters for HNO3 and CIONO2 in this region. Current 
plans call for nonlinear least squares analysis of this region 
with empirical line parameters for CIONO2 (similar to those 
used here for the 780-cm"' Q branch) and HNO3 spectrosco- 
pic line parameters for which work is in progress (A. Maki. 
private communication, 1984). 

2. The line parameters derived from the new laboratory 
data for O3 and CIONO2 produce considerable improve- 
ments in the least squares fits to the stratospheric spectra, 
but the residual plots indicate that problems remain in 
modeling the experimental data. The poorest fit is obtained 
for the 93.19° scan.anfi for this spectrum the rms residual is 
about twice the rms-noise of the data. These systematic 
problems are believed to be due mostly to minor inaccura- 
cies in the assumed hne parameters (particularly the posi- 
tions and intensities of the weaker O? lines), and their 
presence makes it difficult to analyze a feature as weak as 
the ClONO: Q branch. 

3. A weak line appears at 780. 180 cm"' in the 93.19^ scan 
and is also observed in the four lower sun scans obtained 
during this flight (zenith angles of 94.64' to 95.15'. corre-

intensity is calculated to be too weak to account for the 
observed line. Both the new Oj laboratory spectra and the 
atlas oi Damon et al. [1981] show no obvious absorption at 
this frequency. The presence of this unassigned line has only 
a minor influence on the fit to the 93.19° scan, but its 
occurrence points out the potential pitfalls of relying on a 
single, weak feature for a spectroscopic identification. 

In Figure 1 1 the two experimental CIONO2 mixing ratio 
profiles determined from University of Denver stratospheric 
spectra are plotted along with a daytime-averaged CIONO2 
profile for 30°N (dashed line) calculated by Miller et al. 
[1981] and a sunset CIONO2 profile (M. Natarajan, private 
communication, 1984) calculated for March at 30°N (solid ' 
line) with the model of Callis et al. [1983] and recent reaction 
rates [NASA Panel for Data Evaluation, 1983]. The experi- 
mental mixing ratios are higher on average than the calculat- 
ed values, but the experimental error bars are large. The two 
experimental profiles agree at all altitudes within the uncer- 
tainties. There is better agreement between the experimental 
and the model profile shapes, but it is difficult to draw firm 
conclusions because of the large uncertainties in the experi- 
mental values. 

Summary and Conclusions 

We have reported a tentative identification of the 780-cm"' 
Vi band Q branch of ClONO: on the basis of an analysis of 
0.02-cm"' resolution balloon-borne stratospheric solar ab- 
sorption spectra and new high-resolution laboratory spectra 
of ClONO: and O3. The preliminary altitude profile deduced 
from the data is similar to photochemical model predictions 
and to the results obtained previously from the 1292-cm"' 
band [Murcray et al.. 1979]. but the experimental values 
have large uncertainties owing to the difficulties of the 
measurements. We caution that only limited significance 
should be attached to the differences between the measured

and model profiles in view of the large experimental uncer- 
tainties and the tentative nature of our results. 

Improved stratospheric and laboratory spectra will be 
necessary to obtain a firm identification of ClONO; (which 
should be based on more than one feature in the same set of 
spectra) and to accurately quantify its vertical profile. In the 
near future we hope to use a narrow-band filter to record 
high-resolution stratospheric solar absorption spectra cover- 
ing the 780-cm"' and 809-cm"' Q branches of ClONO:. 
These measurements should have the higher signal-to-noise 
ratio needed to better study the weak, broad absorption 
feature detected at the position of the 780-cm"' Q branch. In 
the laboratory, additional spectra of GIONO: and O3 are 
needed. A key issue for ClONO: remains the possibility that 
the integrated intensities have been underestimated because 
of unrecognized contaminants in the sample. Both the abso- 
lute intensities and shapes of the ClONO: Q branches need 
to be measured at stratospheric temperatures. Improved Ime 
parameters for the weak O3 lines in the 780-cm ' and 809- 
cm"' regions would improve least squares fits to stratospher- 
ic spectra.

a concentrated load applied at the center. The ground state 
was recorded with all the apertures open. The subsequent 
exposures were taken by opening in turn only two apertures, 
one each on the two segments, and sequentially loading the 
object. 

The exposure times were all equal, and care was taken to 
ensure linearity of the recording. After processing, the 
specklegram was placed in the Fourier filtering setup, and 
various fringe patterns were photographed by filtering at the 
respective halos. Figure 2 shows the photographs for a x shear 
of 2 mm and central deflections of 5, 10, 15, and 20 \i.m, re- 
spectively. 

This method includes the earlier methods described in Refs. 
1 and 2 as special cases. It provides a more convenient 
method to multiplex any amount of information on the same 
plate. The split-lens arrangement provides a flexibility to 
apply shears of desired magnitude and direction. If flexibility 
is not a primary requirement, a normal camera lens with an 
appropriate aperture mask and a custom-made wedge plate 
covering half of the lens can be used.

The 3230-3340-cm-i interval of O.Ol-cm"^ resolution 
solar absorption spectra recorded with the McMath inter- 
ferometer of the National Solar Observatory on Kitt Peak 
(31.9°N, 111.6°W, altitude 2095 m) has been searched for the 
presence of absorption lines of atmospheric acetylene (C2H2). 
A total of 12 lines belonging to the strong va and 1/2 + 1*4 + "s 
bands has been identified in this interval. Several of these 
lines are well isolated in the solar spectra and are suitable for 
ground-based monitoring of seasonal and long term trends in 
the column amounts of atmospheric C2H2. In this Letter, we 
report the identification and analysis of selected atmospheric 
C2H2 lines in a representative set of Kitt Peak solar 
spectra. 

Figure 1 is a plot of small spectral intervals containing the 
two atmospheric C2H2 lines selected as most favorable for 
quantitative analysis. The sequence of scans shown covers 
the 1850-5500-cm~i region and was obtained on the morning 
of 23 Feb. 1981. The signal-to-rms noise ratio of the spectra 



is «1000 in the C2H2 region. The C2H2 lines are marked. 
Based on the positions and assignments reported in a recent 
laboratory study.^ the line at 3250.6633 cm"! is identified as 
P13 of the i'2 + "4 + H band, and the line at 3304.9686 cm'i 
is identified as R'd of the same band. The measured positions 
in the solar spectra agree with the laboratory values to 0.002 
cm-i. Lines of H2O at 3250.938 and 3305.172 cm-i are also 
indicated in the figure. 

The P2 line of the I'a band of HCN is observed at 3305.544 
cm~S just outside the interval shown in the figure. The C2H2 
and H2O lines are broad in the solar spectra, indicating they 
result from gases concentrated predominately in the tropo- 
sphere where pressure broadening is important. Simulations 
with the line parameters discussed below and the atmospheric 
trace gas concentration profiles of Smith^ indicate both C2H2 
lines are located in the far wings of broad strong lines but that 
no interfering absorption occurs near the C2H2 line centers.

However, long path laboratory spectra of CO2 obtained with 
the McMath interferometer show that there is minor con- 
tamination of the 3304.9686-cm~i ijne by the P46 line of the 
22202-01101 band of 12CI6O2.' This interfering CO2 line also 
appears in the CO2 atlas of Smith etai* Long path length 
laboratory spectra of N20,6 CH*,^ and O3 (Ref. 7) indicate that 
both C2H2 lines are free of overlap by weak lines of these 
molecules. 

The C2H2 line positions, intensities, and lower state energies 
for the analysis were taken from the 1982 AFGL trace gas 
compilation.^ Since, to our knowledge, no measurements of 
air-broadened halfwidths of C2H2 have been reported, we 
assumed the same dependence with |m| (m = J' -I- 1 for i?- 
branch Unes and m = -J" for the P-branch lines, where J" 
is the lower state rotational quantum number), as measured 
for N2 broadening in the (j'4 -f- Ps)^ band of "C2H2.^ These 
values are 0.0842 cm"* atm-i at 296 K for R9 and, by linear 
interpolation, 0.0803 cm-i atm"* at 296 K for P13. Since the 
background level of the P13 line is affected by strong nearby 
lines of H2O and the background level of the R9 lines is af- 
fected by strong nearby lines of H2O and CO2, these lines were 
included in the calculations assuming the parameters listed 
in the 1982 AFGL major gas compilation.^" The position of 
the interfering P46 line of the 22202-01101 band of i2Ci«02 
was changed from the 1982 AFGL value^o of 3305.0394 cm-i 
to the laboratory value^ of 3304.9482 cm-i. The 1982 AFGL 
intensity for this CO2 line^" is in good agreement with a pre- 
liminary intensity value determined from laboratory 
spectra.^ 

In situ measurements indicate very low stratospheric 
concentrations of C2H2 at 32°N latitude." Therefore, as a 
preliminary estimate, we have assumed that the C2H2 mixing 
ratio by volume is constant within the troposphere and that 
there are no C2H2 molecules above the altitude of the tropo- 
pause. Spectral data obtained in Feb. 1981 and Oct. 1982 
were analyzed with the technique of nonlinear least-squares 
curve fitting. Examples of the application of this procedure 
to retrieve information about the abundance and vertical 
distribution of atmospheric gases from ground-based solar 
absorption spectra tire given in several recent papers.'^"^* 
Table I presents the total vertical column amounts and cor- 
responding mean tropospheric mixing ratios deduced from 
analysis of the solar spectra. The retrieved average tropo- 
spheric mixing ratio values of 0.14 and 0.20 ppbv are slightly 
lower than groimd level mixing ratios of 0.3 ppbv determined 
over the Atlantic at SO^N latitude^* and 0.4 ppbv determined 
over the eastern Pacific at the same latitude. ^^ Since mea- 
surements^^ and calculations^i'i'' indicate that the C2H2 
mixing ratio decreases with altitude in the troposphere, the 
differences between the reported ground level measurements 
and our results for the average troposphere above 2.1 km are 
reasonable. Results of the fits to the solar absorption spectra 
are illustrated in Fig. 2. 



iJ -branch lines near 770 cm"' of the V5 band have been used 
previously for spectroscopic measurements of atmospheric 
C2H2. Goldman et al. ^"^ determined a preliminary upper 
tropospheric mixing ratio of 25 pptv near 9 km from solar 
absorption spectra obtained during a balloon flight from 
HoUoman Air Force Base near Alamogordo, N.M. (32''N, 
106° W). Zander et al. ^^ analyzed a different set of Kitt Peak 
solar spectra than used in the present analysis and determined 
a mean C2H2 mixing ratio of 27 ± 6 pptv. It is interesting to 
note that this latter value is almost an order of magnitude 
lower than derived in the present study. Although some of 
this difference is probably due to differences in the methods 
of analysis (the equivalent width method was used by Zander 
et al.^^) and uncertainties in the assumed values for the 
spectroscopic line parameters, the pressure-temperature 
profile, and the shape of the gas concentration profile with 
altitude, its magnitude seems too large to result entirely from 
these factors. On the other hand, our vertical column 
amounts for Feb. 1981 and Oct 1982 differ by only 14% so that 
large variability in the total abundance of atmospheric C2H2 
above Kitt Peak is unlikely. We plan to analyze additional 
Kitt Peak solar spectra to determine the range of seasonal 
variations in the C2H2 vertical column amount. 

The C2H2 lines reported here were also confirmed by Coffey 
and Mankin'^ from analysis of their stratospheric solar ab- 
sorption spectra obtained at 0.06-cm~i resolution from an 
aircraft at 12-km altitude. While most of the C2H2 lines in 
the 3200-3400-cm~^ region are partially or totally overlapped 
by other atmospheric lines, the 3250.66- and 3304.97-cm-i 
lines are quite isolated and show 3-5% absorption in spectra 
obtained with zenith angles of 91-93° . The nearby P2 HON 
line at 3305.544 cm-i absorbs ~5% in these spectra. Unfor- 
tunately, the available aircraft spectra do not allow an accu-

Abstract. Infrared solar absorption spectra 
recorded at 0.02-cm~ resolution during a balloon 
flight from Alamogordo, N.M. OS'N), on March 23, 
1981, have been analyzed for the possible 
presence of absorption by formic acid (HCOOH). 
An absorption feature at 1105 cm" has been 
tentatively identified in upper tropospheric 
spectra as due to the vg band Q branch. A 
preliminary analysis indicates a concentration of 
" 0.6 ppbv and " 0.4 ppbv near 8 and 10 km, 
respectively. 

Two recent studies have reported ground-level 
measurements of vapor phase formic acid (HCOOH) 
in both urban and nonurban environments [Dawson 
et al., 1980; Hanst et al., 1982]. Formic acid 
has also been identified as a major acidic 
component of rain in remote regions [Galloway et 
al., 1982]. Because these measurements suggest 
that HCOOH may be widely distributed in the 
environment, we have examined 0.02-cm~ resolu- 
tion solar absorption spectra recorded with a 
balloon-borne interferometer for the possible 
presence of HCOOH absorption. An absorption 
feature has been found in upper tropospheric 
scans which agrees well with the position and 
shape of the v$ band Q branch at 1104.86 cm" . 
We report here our analysis which suggests the 
possible occurrence of a significant amount of 
HCOOH in the upper troposphere. 

Figures la and lb show the 1100-1108 cm" 
spectral region in two scans recorded with the 
University of Denver interferometer system. The 
spectral data were obtained during a balloon 
flight from Alamogordo, N.M. (33°N) on March 23, 
1981. Each scan wts acquired in 40 seconds 
during sunset from a float altitude of 33.5 - 0.5 
km. The observed features are identified in the 
University of Denver stratospheric atlas [Goldman 
et al., 1983]. The dominant absorber in this 
Interval is atmospheric O3 . The O3 lines show 
maximum absorption in the 93.21* scan, in accor- 
dance with the well-known mid-stratospheric peak 
in the vertical O3 distribution. The H2O lines 
increase in strength over the full range of 
observed solar zenith angles, as is also expected 
from knowledge of the H2O profile. 

In the lowest scan, which was recorded at an 
astronomical zenith angle of 95.58° (tangent 
altitude =7.7 km), a broad absorption feature is 
superimposed on the lines near 1105 cm" . The 
pattern of this broad absorption is difficult to 
recognize in Figure lb because of numerous over- 
lapping strong lines (of O3 ) . It has been found 
that this broad absorption can be studied better

by ratioing the 95.58" spectrum to a higher sun 
spectrum with a nearly equal amount of O3 absorp- 
tion. In the ratio spectrum, the O3 lines are 
then largely cancelled. The 94.71" scan (tangent 
altitude - 14.7 km) has been found well suited 
for this purpose. 

Figure 2 compares a laboratory spectrum of 
HCOOH (upper plot) and the atmospheric 95.58°/ 
94.71° ratio spectrum (lower plot). Comparison 
with Figures la and lb shox*s the O3 lines are 
almost completely removed in the atmospheric 
ratio spectrum; the broad feature near 1105 cm" 
remains in addition to the lines of H2O. The 
modulation of the background results from a 
complex residual channel spectrum which is not 
cancelled completely in the ratioing procedure. 
The laboratory spectrum in Figure 2 was recorded 
at 0.06-cm~ resolution and 22°C [Wurcray and 
Goldman, 1981 ]. Comparison between the strato- 
spheric ratio scan and the laboratory scan 
Indicates good agreement in the position and the 
shape of the 1105-cm" feature. Figure 3 
presents versions of the same spectra convolved 
with a triangular response function with a full 
width at half maximum of 1.0 cm" . These spectra 
show clearer agreement in the stratospheric and 
laboratory band shape of the 1105-cm" feature. 
The strong residual HzO lines are marked with 
asterisks in the atmospheric spectrum. 

The integrated absorption of the broad 
1105-cm"' feature in the 9^.58°/94.7I° atmo- 
spheric spectrum is " 0.21 cm" . A weak feature 
also appears with the same position and shape in 
the 95.29" scan (tangent height = 9.8 km); an 
equivalent width of " 0.06 cm" has been measured 
from the 95. 29°/94. 71° ratio spectrum. A 
preliminary estimate for the HCOOH profile has 
been derived from these equivalent widths and an 
integrated Q branch intensity of " 28 cm" atm" , 
averaged from " 20 cm" atm" estimated from the 
University of Denver laboratory data and " 36 
cm" atm" estimated from other laboratory data 
[Maker and Niki, 1983]. Assuming that no HCOOH 
molecules occur above the tropopause height of 
10.4 km and that the measured absorption is on 
the linear part of the curve of growth, an onion- 
peeling inversion yields mixing ratios of " 0.6 
ppbv between 7.7 and 9.8 km and - 0.4 ppbv 
between 9.8 and 10.4 km (estimated accurate to 
within a factor of two). These concentrations 
are close to the ground level values measured in 
the southwest U.S.A. during clean conditions 
[Dawson et al., 1980] but are an order of magni- 
tude larger than predicted for the vapor phase in 
a recent study of aqueous-phase cloud chemistry 
[Chameldes and Davis, 1983]. 

Although the observed shape and close 
frequency coincidence support the conclusion that 
the observed atmospheric feature is due to HCOOH,

this identification must be regarded as tentative 
because it results from a single, broad feature. 
Also, the occurrence of a complex residual 
channel spectrum in the data makes it difficult 
to be certain that the observed feature Is real. 
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to 
identify the 1105-cm" feature in ground-based 
solar absorption spectra because ot interference 
by a weak, broad water vapor line near the loca- 
tion of the strongest HCOOH absorption. The V3 
band, centered near 1776.5 cm" , also has a 
prominent Q branch and is about an order of 
magnitude stronger than the 1105-cm~ band. 



Unfortunately, in low sun scans this region is 
strongly absorbed by H2O lines, as seen on the 
currently available balloon-borne scans at the 
University of Denver from the 10/10/79 flight. 
It is hoped that spectra recorded during a future 
balloon flight in that region with higher resolu- 
tion and higher signal-to-noise will provide an 
opportunity to look for absorption by HCOOH. The 
1220-cm~^ HCOOH band, which appears stronger than 
the 1105-cm band in standard chemical infrared 
catalogs, has been found to be due to the formic 
acid dlmer [Maker and Niki, 1983] and therefore 
should not be absorbing in the atmosphere.

QUANTIFICATION OF HCl FROM HIGH RESOLUTION INFRARED SOLAR SPECTRA OBTAINED 

AT THE SOUTH POLE IN DECEMBER 1986

Abstract. - Ground-based Infrared solar spectra 
at 0.02 cm~ resolution obtained at the Amundsen- 
Scott South Pole station in December 1986 have 
been analysed for the atmospheric content of HCl. 
Nonlinear least-squares spectral fitting applied 
to the spectra yields a total HCl column amount 
of (6.4 + 0.8)xl0 molec/cm , most being strato- 
spheric. This amount is larger than that extrap- 
olated from earlier results on the latitudinal 
distribution of atmospheric HCl. 



This Letter reports the determination of HCl 
total column amount above the South Pole, from 
ground based solar spectra observations made at 
the Amundsen-Scott station (altitude 2.85km) in 
December 1986, by F.J.M. and F.H.M. The spectra 
were recorded with a 0.02 cm" resolution Michel- 
son type Interferometer, the same system used to 
record many balloon-borne, ground based and lab- 
oratory spectra by the University of Denver atmo- 
spheric spectroscopy group. The South Pole solar 
spectra were obtained during November 26 - Decem- 
ber 3, 1986 and covered large portions of the 3- 
15 ym region. The nearly constant solar zenith 
angle allowed the co-adding of several spectral 
scans from a single day for improved signal to 
noise ratio. The data analysis methods and spec- 
troscopic data base used are similar to those 
used previously [Goldman et al., 1983, Goldman et 
al., 1986], applying nonlinear least-squares 
spectral fitting for the quantification of HCl. 
Radiosonde ascents from the South Pole (kindly 
provided by NOAA, Boulder, Colorado) were used to 
establish the atmospheric temperature-pressure 
profiles. 

Figure 1 shows a typical analysis of the 2923- 
2929 cm" region, which Is dominated by strong 
CHa lines with some weak H2O lines, surrounding 
the quite isolated H^^Cl Rl line at 2925.9 cm"^. 
For the present analysis, the CH^j line parameters 
were updated (Rothman et. al., 1987], but for 
consistency of comparisons with other recent 
studies, the previous HCl line parameters were 
retained (however, the updated HCl parameters 
lead to only 1% decrease in the column amount). 
The residual phase distortions, not fully 
accounted for by the fitted synthetic specjtrum, 
required a more specific fitting for the H CI Rl 
line over a narrower Interval. This is present- 
ed in Figure 2, which also shows a small asymmet- 
ry in the spectral profile (probably due to 
incomplete adjustment of the Instrument). The 
narrow interval analysis (with larger weight 
assigned to the high wavepumber half of the line)

yields a total HCl column amount of (6.4 + 
0.8)xl0^molec/cm, most of which is 
stratospheric, as concluded from spectral fit- 
tings with various HCl and temperature-pressure 
profiles [Goldman et. al., 1986]. The HCl in 
these spectra being mostly stratospheric could 
have been expected for a high observation point 
In a low tropopause region such as the south 
pole. However, the sensitivity of the current 
spectra (at 0.02 cm" resolution and a single 
solar zenith angle) to the altitude distribution 
of HCl is limited [Goldman et. al., 1983). 
Several other HCl lines are quite isolated 011 the 
South Pole spectra, such as the Rl and P2 H-'-'Cl 
lines, and these lead to practically the same HCl 
column amounts. The complete set of the South 
Pole solar spectra in the 3vjm region, collected 
during the week of the measurements, shows no 
significant change in the HCl amounts. 

This is the first HCl measurement reported 
from the South Pole and is of particular interest 
to current studies of the chemistry and dynamics 
of the Antarctic atmosphere. Previous measure-

ments and assessments [Mankln et. al., 1983, 
Molina et. al., 1985] of the latitudinal depend- 
ence of stratospheric HCl show total column 
values above 12km Increasing from 0.7x10^ 
molec/cm near the equator, to 2.7x10 molec/cm^ 
at 70°N, with an extrapolated value of 3.4x10^ 
molec/cm at 90°N. South latitude measurements 
[Glrard et. al., 1983] of HCl column above 11.5km 
show values Increasing from 0.8x10 molec/cm at 
l^'S to 2.7x10^^ molec/cm^ at 60°S, Implying a 
symmetrical North-South distribution for these 
latitudes. While there are unresolved difficult- 
ies in assessing the tropospheric HCl content and 
variability, it has been established that most of 
the HCl total column is stratospheric, and that 
it has been increasing with time, at an annual 
rate of 5Z per year. 

The present result for the column amount of 
HCl above the South Pole is larger than the 
extrapolated values from the northern or southern 
latitude's results, even if we assume a temporal 
increase of 5% per year as has been reported by 
Mankln et al [1983]. It is probably characteris- 
tic of the Antarctic atmosphere at the end of the 
period of the spring ozone depletion. 

Work is in progress on the quantification of 
several other atmospheric trace constituents 
observable in the 1986 South Pole Solar spectra 



reported here. Further measurements need to be 
made for monitoring HCl and other species during 
the ozone depletion periods.
