INTRODUCTION 

Background 

The vast bulk of the work reported to date on identification of structural dynamic systems has 
focused on identifying mathematical models that reproduce test results, but little consideration has 
been given to the physical basis for the identified system equations. Typically, the identification 
procedures make systematic adjustments to the system equation, commonly to the stiffness and/or 
mass matrices but also to the damping matrix, so that the identified eigenvalues and eigenvectors 
reproduce as closely as possible the results measured in tests. The result of this process is almost 
inevitably identified mass, stiffness and damping matrices that are fully populated, that is, which 
have nonzero values for almost all elements. Such matrices, while capable of producing plausible 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors, can nonetheless be physically implausible in the sense that the large 
numbers of nonzero elements throughout the system matrices implies direct connectivity among 
the degrees of freedom that does not exist physically. 

Identified mathematical models that are based on physically implausible system matrices may 
be quite acceptable if the objective. of the study is to develop a simulation model. However, such 
results for analysis purposes are generally unsatisfactory because it is difficult or impossible to 
relate specific features of the physical system to the analysis results. This problem is particularly 
troublesome when the objective of the identification of a system model from experimental 
measurements is an accurate system model that, in turn, will be used to make modifications to or 
improvements in the original physical system. Such an example might be the modification of an 
existing aircraft structure to accommodate a new mission. In this case it would be desirable to 
formulate a structural model for the present structure, verify its accuracy against experimental 
measurements, and then use it as the basis for the modifications. When the verification process 
yields identified system matrices that are mathematically acceptable but physically implausible, the 
resulting model may be useless as the basis for future structural modifications. 

The objective of the present work was to develop a method for identifying physically plausible 
finite element system models of airframe structures from test data. The assumed models were 
based on linear elastic behavior with general (nonproportional) damping. Physical plausibility of 
the identified system matrices was insured by restricting the identification process to designated 
physical parameters only and not simply to the elements of the system matrices themselves. For 
example, in a large finite element model the identified parameters might be restricted to the moduli 
for each of the different materials used in the structure. In the case of damping, a restricted set of 
damping values might be assigned to finite elements based on the material type and on the 
fabrication processes used. In this case, different damping values might be associated with riveted, 
bolted and bonded elements. 

The method itself is developed first, and several approaches are outlined for computing the 
identified parameter values. The method is applied first to a simple structure for which the 
"measured" response is actually synthesized from an assumed model. Both stiffness and damping 
parameter values are accurately identified. The true test, however, is the application to a full-scale 
airframe structure. In this case, a NASTRAN model and actual measured modal parameters 
formed the basis for the identification of a restricted set of physically plausible stiffness and 
damping parameters. 

Review of Previous Pertinent Work 

Airframes are generally modelled using powerful finite element analysis packages such as 
NASTRAN that are capable of representing.quite detailed aspects of the structural system. The 
accuracy of such models is determined by comparing the analytical results with flight or ground 
vibration test results. In the case of helicopter airframes, several recent efforts have focused on the 
correlation of NASTRAN model data with ground vibration test data 1 ' 3 . The conclusions reached 
in these studies suggest that in cases where there is some degree of correlation, the model 
frequencies compare favorably with test frequencies, but generally only in the low frequency range 



PRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED 



below about 15 Hz 1_2 . The frequency response functions at selected locations also compare 
reasonably well in this range. Outside this range the comparisons are generally unsatisfactory, and 
the eigenvectors do not usually compare favorably in either range. 

Although there have been numerous contributions to the literature in the area of the 
identification of structural dynamic systems 425 , the majority of reported methods are based on 
simply adjusting the elements of one or more of the K, M, and C matrices. While this approach 
is capable of yielding a system matrix whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors suitably match 
measured results, the methods generally lose all physical interpretability inherent in the original K, 
M and C matrices by not maintaining relationships among elements dictated by the model 
topology. These difficulties are compounded for large-scale models with thousands of degrees of 
freedom. 

Kuo and Wada 25 used nonlinear sensitivity coefficients (NSC) in the identification procedure. 
Their sensitivity coefficients are between the system parameters and eigenvalues. In the present 
work the interest is in the change of system matrices as a function of physical variables of the 
structure. A different type of sensitivity coefficient between system matrices and physical 
variables has therefore been developed. 

The most significant achievement in the present work 30 is to preserve the physical 
interpretability of the M, C, K matrices so that the identification can provide evidence of possible 
sources of erroneous modeling and point to specific regions of the model that are unduly sensitive 
and need additional consideration in modeling. The identification procedure developed in this paper 
is capable of adjusting physical quantities such as boundary conditions, moments of inertia, 
stiffnesses, damping or other selected physical parameters. 



PROGRESS DURING THIS REPORTING PERIOD 



Our previous work was tested on simple analytical models, 
simple structural systems like beams, and test results from AH1G 
Helicopter. The method yielded reasonably accurate identification 
of models and preserved physical interpretability of the system 
matrices. However, the use of proportional or nonproportional 
damping and nonlinear sensitivity coefficients did not adjust the 
model in certain regions. A careful examination suggested that we 
will need a more general representation of the damping behavior. In 
order to accommodate damping parameters, other than the linear 
viscous damping, we have studied the possible use of Hammer stein 
integral equation based models. These models can accommodate both 
linear and nonlinear systems. They have been used to consider 
nonlinearities in forcing terms. We have modified this approach to 
include linear and nonlinear damping. We have studied linear (non- 
proportional damping) and Coulomb damping. The appendix to this 
progress report contains some the details of our approach. 



WORK PLANNED FOR THE NEXT REPORTING PERIOD 



As a next step, we will study methods of including structural 
damping. Following this work, we would like to include the modified 
Hammerstein approach in our identification procedure that can 
preserve the physical interpretability of system matrices.

The identifying the constant c of a Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) nonlinear 
dynamic system and the estimating the parameters of Multiple Degree of Freedom 
(MDOF) nonlinear dynamic system have been illustrated in this report. 

These identification procedures are based on various models of nonlinear dynamical 
systems. Usually, a nonlinear system is represented by a set of nonlinear differential 
or integral equations. In man)' practical applications, an input-output approach of a 
nonlinear dynamical system is a means of describing a relationship between the input 
and the output, of the system in some straightforward way and is considered to be more 
useful. 

An approach for modeling a nonlinear dynamical system is by the use of Volterra Series

The Volterra Series, Eq (1.0.3), is a functional series, It maps past inputs into the 
present output. This means that many kernel values are required to estimate. Several 
techniques have been presented [3], [4], [5]. Because we have to decide which terms of 
Volterra Series are necessary for a given practical problem and to estimate many kernel 
values, the procedure of identification is usually a difficult procedure. 

Several other simple block-oriented input-output models for representing nonlinear 
dynamical systems are as folloows. [7]. 

• Simple Hammerstein Model. 

• Generalized Hammerstein Model. 

• Simple Wiener Approach. 

• Generalized Wiener Approach. 

• Extended Wiener Approach. 

• Simple Wiener-Hammerstein Approach. 

• Generalized Wiener-Hammerstein Model. 

• Extended Wiener-Hammerstein Model. 

The- block-oriented models have been widely used because of their simplicity. 

In 1985, a nonlinear difference equation model N ARM AX (Nonliear Autoregressive 
Moving Average Models with inputs) was presented by Leontaritis and Billings [9], [10] 



. The NARMAX model is considered as an unified representation of a finitely realizable 
nonlinear system. The finitely realizable nonlinear system in essence means that the 
state space of the system can not be infinite dimensional. This model maps the past 
inputs and outputs to current output. For the SISO (single input, and single output) 
nonlinear dynamical system with white noise, it can be denoted by [11] 

x(k) = F{x{k - 1), ...,x(k - n x ),u{k - 1), ...,«(& - n u )} (1.0.4) 

Where F(*) is an unknown nonlinear function. In general, it will be determined for a 
given real sampled nonlinear system. Leontaritis and Billings proved that a nonlinear 
discrete time invariant system can always be denoted by Eg. (1.0.4) in a region around 
an equilibrium point, if the response function of system is finitely realizable and a 
linearized model exists at the chosen equilibrium. 

The NARMAX model is derived assuming zero initial state response, but it can be 
carried over to the non-zero-initial-state cases. The response functions of a system are 
different for different initial condition, but the input-output NARMAX model for the 
system will always be the same within a region around an equilibrium point. Several 
simple forms of the NARMAX model have been proposed for nonlinear dynamic, system 
identification, such as the Bilinear Model.[ll],[12]

Haber and Unbehauen [7] prefer the NARMAX model, because the NARMAX model 
is parametric and has fewer parameters than the Volterra series. 



In aerospace engineering applications, a nonlinear structural dynamical system is 
usually described by a system of nonlinear differential equations. In SISO case , the 
nonlinear differential equation of a system is of the form 

x + hi + ex + f(iyx) - u(t) (1.0.7) 

where /(*) is a nonlinear fuction of x ,ar. If /(*) is represented by a polynomial 
extension for simplicity, Eq.( 1.0.7) becomes

x 4- hx 4 ex + a 2 x 4- a 3 x 4- ... 4- 

B 2 x 2 + (3 3 x 3 4- ... = u{t) (1.0.8) 

Every term in Eq.( 1.0.8) has a distinct physical meaning. Identifying the parameters 
of Eq.( 1.0.8) are useful for dynamic analysis, structural dynamic design, control and 
design modification. If the nonlinear structural dynamic system is modeled by using 
Eq.(1.0.8), the problem of the identification of a system is to estimate the parameters 
: 6,c, q 2 ,--- ,As, •■•• 

Many techniques for estimating these parameters have been proposed. Hanagud, 
Meyyappa and Craig (1985) [15] used the method of multiple scales to formulate a 
procedure for identification of parameters of Eq.( 1.0.8). Mook(1988) [16] used a model 
error method to find the model error d(t) which represents the nonlinear terms of the 
nonlinear dynamic system and then estimated the nonlinear parameters from d(t) by 
using a least square method. Yun and Shinozuka [17] proposed an approach that is 
based on two versions of Kalman filter for identifying the parameters. Ibanez [18] 
used an approach for estimating parameters in which it is assumed that the system 
response is dominated by a periodic response at the forcing frequency and an approx- 
imate transfer function is constructed. Broersen [19] replaced nonlinear terms in the 
equation by a series expansion for a system subjected to random excitation. Distefano 
and Rath, Yun and Shinozuka [20] [21] described several methods of of identification 
and applied nonlinear Kalman filtering techniques for estimation. 



If a structural control is considered, an input- output approach of nonlinear struc- 
tural dynamic system in time domain and its parameter identification is useful. For 
this purpose, the Hammerstein Feedback Model (HFM) has been considered here. 



Example 
In practical egineering, the real damping usually is different from design damping. 
Identification of the difference is useful for analysis, design, and control. If the mass 
matrix [A"], stiffness matrix [A'], and damping matrix [C] are known, the defference 
of damping can be estimated by using Hammerstein Feedback Model. The defference 
of damping is assumed to be [dC], We assume a linear dynamic system as foUowing 
deferential equation.
