NOTE:  Chapter 1 of the book also covers installation of the JDK.

Both versions of the JDK are self extracting archive files:  you must
first copy the file from the CD-ROM before you can unpack it (You cannot 
unpack it directly from the CD-ROM).

On the CD-ROM, the compressed file that contains the JDK is called JDK.EXE. 
After copying the file to your hard disk (or after downloading the JDK from 
Sun), you install it by double-clicking the self-extracting compressed file.

When the files have been extracted, you can move the resultant JAVA 
folder anywhere you like on your hard disk, although you'll probably
want it on the disk's root directory, which is where the book's 
examples assume it's located. 

If you examine the folders that make up the JDK, you'll see that the BIN
folder holds the developer tools such as the compiler, the interpreter, 
the debugger, and the profiler. The DEMO folder contains the many example 
applets that you can examine to learn more about the Java language and how 
it's used. In your JAVA folder, you'll also find a file called SRC.ZIP. 
This compressed file contains the source code for the classes included 
with the Java language.

Although the JDK includes many executable files, it doesn't make sense 
to add these files to your Start menu because they must be run from the 
Run dialog box or from a DOS command window.
