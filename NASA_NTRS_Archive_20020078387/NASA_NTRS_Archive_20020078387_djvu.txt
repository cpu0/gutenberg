D eveloped by 

INTERSOLV, Inc., a 
computer software 
developer located in 
Rockville, Maryland, Exceler- 
ator ll is a new software sys- 
tem described by the 
company as “smarter and 
more flexible, the next gener- 
ation of planning, analysis 
and design tools," Excel era- 
tor II incorporates technolo- 
gy developed by NASA to 
provide a complete environ- 
ment for rules-based expert 
systems. 

In addition to built-in sup- 
port for many popular 
methodologies, Excelerator 11 
takes advantage of the 
INTERSOLV LAN Repository’s 
Customizer, which allows a 
user to construct or tailor 
any methodology to the 
user's particular organiza- 
tional requirements. 

In previous versions of the 
product, INTERSOLV used a 
procedural language to check 
the consistency and com- 
pleteness of the LAN Reposi- 
tory. However, since the 
main task being executed is 
comparing patterns, the com- 
pany decided that a rules- 
based language was needed. 
The rules-based language 
selected was NASA's CLIPS 
(C Language Integrated Pro- 
duction System), a shell for 


ANALYSIS/DESIGN TOOL 


constructing expert systems. 
CLIPS was developed by 
Johnson Space Center to pro- 
vide high portability, low 
cost and easy integration 
with external systems. 

INTERSOLV chose CLIPS 
because the company's tech- 
nical staff could easily imple- 
ment the communication to 
the relational database. The 
staff was able to expand 
CLIPS with low level relation- 
al database access routines. 
With this rules-based envi- 
ronment, which the company 
calls the "INTERSOLV Rules 
Engine (IRE),” design prob- 
lems and errors are identified 
early in development, when 
they may be corrected quick- 
ly and cost effectively. 

“The IRE is a key position 
point in our analysis and 
design marketing approach, w 
says Shep Bostin, director of 
Excelerator II product man- 
agement * "Using CLIPS has 
enabled us to provide com- 
plex verification and transfor- 
mation routines based on 
pattern matching that would 
be an order of magnitude 
more complex and costly if 
we had to resort to procedur- 
al language." 

CLIPS was supplied to 
INTERSOLV by the Computer 
Software Management and 
Information Center 
(COSMIC)*', NASA's mecha- 
nism for making available to 
industry, academic and gov- 
ernment clients computer 
programs originally devel-
