A REGIONAL 17-18 MA THERMAL EVENT IN SOUTHWESTERN ARIZONA 
William E. Brooks, U.S. Geological Survey, Denver, CO 

A regional thermal event in southwestern Arizona 17-18 Ma ago is 
suggested by discordances between fission track (FT) and K-Ar dates in 
Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks, by the abundance of primary 
hydrothermal orthoclase in quenched volcanic rocks, and by the concentration 
of Mn, Ba, Cu, Ag, and Au deposits near detachment faults. A high conodont 
alteration index (CAI) of 3 to 7, is found in Paleozoic rocks of southwestern 
Arizona (1). The high CAI may have been caused by this mid-Tertiary thermal 
event. 

Resetting of temperature-sensitive FT dates (2) to 17-18 Ma with respect 
to K-Ar dates of 24 and 20 Ma has occurred in upper plate volcanic rocks at 
the Harcuvar and Picacho Peak detachments (3). Discordances between FT and 
K-Ar dates are most pronounced at detachment faults. However, on a regional 
scale FT dates from volcanic and sedimentary rocks approach 17-18 Ma, even in 
areas away from known detachment faults (fig. 1). Effects of detachment 
faulting on the K-Ar system suggest that dates of correlative rocks will be 
younger as the detachment fault is approached (4).' 

Anomalously high K2O is common in volcanic and sedimentary rocks in the 
southwestern United States (5,6). In Arizona, anomalously high K is present 
at the Harcuvar Mountains, 12 weight percent K2O (7) and Picacho Peak 
detachments, 13 weight percent K^O (8), and in listric faulted terrane in the 
Vulture Mountains area, 12 weight percent K„0 (9). 

Introduction of hydrothermal potassium has resulted in anomalous 
orthoclase (2 to 10 microns) in upper plate volcanic rocks at the Picacho 
Peak, Harcuvar, and Trigo detachments. K-Ar dates on metasomatized rocks are 
suspect because the date becomes a function of potassium available upon 
eruption and potassium introduced during the detachment/raetasomatic event 
17-18 Ma. 

Mineralization and potassium metasomatism caused by hydrothermal fluids 
is common near the detachments. Mn and Ba as well as Ag, Au, Cu, Pb, and Zn 
deposits are localized near most detachments (10,11,12,13). The presence of 
metasomatized and mineralized rock at the detachment faults indicates that the 
faults were likely pathways for the mineralizing fluids. Zirconium, 
considered to be an immobile element, occurs in concentrations as great as 350 
ppm at the Picacho Peak detachment and decreases to a normal concentration of 
about 180 ppm (14,15) 7 km from the surface trace of the fault. Li, As, Zn, 
Ce, and Cd are also spatially distributed. 

Paleozoic rocks with a high conodont alteration index (CAI of 3 to 7) 
indicate that a minimum regional temperature of 250 C was reached in 
southwestern Arizona. Correlative rocks in northeastern Arizona have a much 
lower CAI of 2 or less (1) where regional metamorphism should have affected 
the rocks equally. Also, several of the high CAI sites in southwestern 
Arizona are not near any mapped intrusions. Therefore, alteration of the 
conodonts by the 17-18 Ma thermal event seems likely. 

A regional thermal event is postulated for southwestern Arizona 17-18. 
Ma. The event caused reheating, as indicated by discordances between FT and 
K-Ar dates; potassium metasomatism as indicated by primary hydrothermal 
orthoclase in volcanic rocks; and concentration of Mn, Ba, and Zr as well as 
Cu, Ag, and Au at detachment faults in southwestern Arizona.
