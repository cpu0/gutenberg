x-archive-meta-description: A regional thermal event in southwestern Arizona 17 to 18 Ma ago is suggested by discordances between fission track (FT) and K-Ar dates in Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks, by the abundance of primary hydrothermal orthoclase in quenched volcanic rocks, and by the concentration of Mn, Ba, Cu, Ag, and Au deposits near detachment faults. A high condont alteration index (CAI) of 3 to 7 is found in Paleozoic rocks of southwestern Arizona. The high CAI may have been caused by this mid-Tertiary thermal event. Resetting of temperature-sensitive TF dates (2) 17 to 18 Ma with respect to K-Ar dates of 24 and 20 Ma has occurred in upper plate volcanic rocks at the Harcuvar and Picacho Peak detachments. Discordances between FT and K-Ar dates are most pronounced at detachment faults. However, on a regional scale Ft dates from volcanic and sedimentary rocks approach 17 to 18 Ma event in areas away from known detachment faults. Effects of detachment faulting on the K-Ar system suggest that dates of correlative rocks will be younger as the detachment fault is approached.
