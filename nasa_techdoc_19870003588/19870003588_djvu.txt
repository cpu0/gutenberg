PROTOTYPE SUPERCONDUCTING GRAVITY GRADIOMETER 



PREFACE 

This report describes research on the superconducting gravity gradiometer 
program performed at the University of Maryland from July 1980 to July 1985 
under NASA Contract NAS8-33822. 

This report consists of three main parts: Parts 1 and 2 describing the 
theoretical and experimental work on a prototype superconducting gravity 
gradiometer, respectively, and Part 3 discussing the design of a new advanced 
model of superconducting gradiometer. These three parts represent three 
separate papers being submitted for publication. In addition, two published 
papers, one reporting a null test of the gravitational inverse square law 
performed with the prototype superconducting gradiometer and the other dis- 
cussing space applications of the advanced three-axis instrument, are attached 
as appendices. 

An advanced three-axis superconducting gravity gradiometer, designed 
along the line proposed in Part 3 of this report, is being developed under 
new NASA Contract NAS8- 36165. An associated instrument, a six-axis super- 
conducting accelerometer, is under development with support from AFGL under 
Contract F19628-85-K-0042. Electronic control of the gradiometer has been 
supported in part by Army Contract DACA-72-84-C-0004.

SUMMARY 

A sensitive and stable gravity gradiometer is needed for precision tests 
of fundamental laws of physics and for moving-base gravity survey and inertial 
guidance. Through the five years of research and development at the University 
of Maryland we have demonstrated the feasibility that superconducting tech- 
nology can be utilized not only to lower the intrinsic noise of the instrument 
but also to meet many practical challenges of operating a sensitive gravity 
measuring instrument in a noisy environment. 

A relatively simple prototype single-axis superconducting gravity gradi- 
ometer has been constructed to investigate the basic physics of a superconduct- 
ing gradiometer. At the same time, a detailed analysis of the instrument 
dynamics has been carried out including extensive error modelling. Thorough 
experimental tests of the instrument have shown that the superconducting device 

closely follows the analytical model. The performance level of 0.3 "^ 0.7 

-1/2 -9 -2 
E Hz (1 E = 10 s ) achieved with this Instrument in the laboratory 

without any active control or compensation represents the best reported sensi- 
tivity of any gradiometer to date. The instrument has already been used 
successfully to perform a new null test of the gravitational inverse square 
law. 

Based on the experience obtained with this first instrument and additional 
superconducting technologies developed to improve the performance of the super- 
conducting gradiometer, an advanced design of a three-axis superconducting 
gravity gradiometer has been produced. Incorporated into the new design are 
the concepts of a "superconducting negative spring", "three-dimensional 
residual common mode balance" and a "six-axis superconducting accelerometer." 
Various feedbacks will be applied to control the instrument and the platform. 
This second generation superconducting gravity gradiometer should be able to

-4 -1/2 
meet the instrument noise goal, 3 x 10 E Hz , defined for NASA's Gravity 

Gradiometer Mission (GGM) • 

Part 1 of this report discusses the theory of the superconducting gravity 
gradiometer. Although the particular superconducting circuit used for the 
prototype is analyzed here, the method and results are quite general and can 
be readily applied to the new model. Part 2 reports details of the design, 
fabrication, and various tests of the single-axis gradiometer. Calibration 
experiments performed by using gravity gradient signals are described here. 
Part 3 contains the design and theoretical analysis of the new gradiometer. 
It is found that the improved common mode rejection characteristic and the 
ease of g-nulling in the new instrument would enable its operation in a more 
hostile terrestrial moving-base environment. A null test of the inverse 
square law by use of the superconducting gradiometer is reported in Appendix 
I. Finally, the basic concept of GGM is discussed in Appendix II. 

The Maryland superconducting gravity gradiometer project has served as 
an excellent training ground for physicists. A strong Ph.D. thesis was 
produced on the development of the prototype gradiometer and the test of the 
inverse square law (Chan, 1982). Another Ph.D. thesis is nearing completion 
on the development of the six-axis accelerometer. A third student is test- 
ing a transducer concept for the cryogenic gravitational wave detector, 
which came as a spin-off from the gradiometer project. The many challenges 
that one has to overcome to realize the fabulous sensitivity of the space- 
borne gravity gradiometer, orders of magnitude beyond the state of the art, 
and the exotic new technologies being invented to meet them have been inspira- 
tional to the scientific team of the Maryland gravity gradiometer project.

Due to the Equivalence Principle, a global measurement is necessary to 
distinguish gravity from acceleration of the reference frame. A gravity 
gradiometer is therefore an essential instrument needed for precision tests of 
gravity laws and for applications in gravity survey and inertial navigation. 
Superconductivity and SQUID (Superconducting QUantura Interference Device) 
technology can be used to obtain a gravity gradiometer with very high 
sensitivity and stability. A superconducting gravity gradiometer has been 
developed for a null test of the gravitational inverse square law and 
spaceborne geodesy. Here we present a complete theoretical model of this 
instrument. Starting from dynamical equations for the device, we derive 
transfer functions, common mode rejection characteristic, and an error model 
of the superconducting instrument. Since a gradiometer must detect a very 
weak differential gravity signal in the midst of large platform accelerations 
and other environmental disturbances, the scale factor and common mode 
rejection stability of the instrument is extremely important in addition to 
its immunity to temperature and electromagnetic fluctuations. We show how 
flux quantization, the Meissner effect and properties of liquid helium can be 
utilized to meet these challenges.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Highly sensitive gravity sensors are needed to investi'^ste fundamental 
properties of gravitation and to improve accuracies of gravity survey and 
inertial navigation. Torsion balances have been used over two centuries for 
sensitive gravity experiments [1]. Spring-mass, pendulum, and free-fall type 
gravimeters [2] have been developed as survey instruments as well as a 
superconducting version of the first type [3]. Research to develop detectors 
for gravitational waves of extraterrestrial origin has started over two 
decades ago [4]. Cryogenic mass-quadrupole type and laser interferometer type 
detectors are under vigorous development [5]. The last two decades have also 
seen dedicated efforts to develop room temperature gravity gradiometers [6-8] 
for moving base survey applications. Superconducting gravity gradiometers 
have emerged more recently as an outgrowth of the superconducting transducer 
work for low temperature gravitational wave detectors [9]. 

The extremely weak nature of gravitational interaction poses a challenge 
to the state of the art technology for signal transduction and amplification 
as well as isolation of environmental noise. To compound the problem, the 
gravitational field cannot be distinguished in a local measurement from 
acceleration of the reference frame by the Equivalence Principle. In order to 
separate gravity from frame accelerations, one must resort to a second order 
measurement using the tensor nature of gravitational field gradient or 
"gravity gradient". When the platform is undergoing a linear acceleration, a 
differential measurement over a baseline between two proof masses will cancel 
out the acceleration noise, leaving gravity to be detected as the signal. 
Likewise, an angular acceleration can be taken out by combining signals from 
four proof masses as we will see in Section II. Thus, unlike in 
electromagnetism, where a single test charge can be used to determine the 



-5- 



field uniquely, a tidal force sensor or a "gradioraeter" is the fundamental 
instrument in gravity which is capable of measuring its field, independent of 
platform motion. True acceleration measurement, in turn, requires removal of 
gravity noise which again calls for the use of a gravity gradlometer. It is 
therefore not surprising to find that instruments employed in most precision 
gravity experiments, such as torsion balances and Weber-type gravitational 
wave detectors, have actually been special types of gradiometers. 

The acceleration difference along the direction j per unit separation 
along the direction i is defined to be the ij -component of the gravity 
gradient tensor T: 

p (t t^ - .^mL^ (1) 

-2 
where (t)(r,t) is the gravitational potential. A very weak gradient of 1 nm s 

per ra is equal to one Etttvtts (E) unit, defined by 

1 E = 10-9 3-2, (2) 

Many ground-based survey applications call for such high sensitivity. Geodesy 
application in space requires even higher sensitivity at the level of 10 E 
Hz"^/^ [10]. The extreme weakness of gravitational interaction and the 
practical difficulties associated with balancing out the acceleration noise to 
a sufficient degree have limited the sensitivity of room temperature gradio- 
meters to a level of 1 ~ 10 E Hz'^/^ [iq]. Major improvements in sensitivity 
and stability are expected of the superconducting devices under development. 
It appears that a superconducting gravity gradioraeter of a relatively compact 
design will have a sufficient sensitivity for space applications.

Besides possessing low thermal noise and low mechanical drift as direct 
consequences of a cryogenic temperature, the new gtadtoraeLer takes advantage 
of many exotic properties of superconductivity. Quantized magnetic flux is 
used as an extremely stable tool to achieve transducer action and common mode 
balance. Operating at liquid helium temperatures, SQUID (Superconducting 
Quantum Interference Device) serves as the most sensitive amplifier of today. 
Superconductivity can be used to make a nearly perfect electromagnetic shield 
and superfluid helium can provide a stable, gradient-free temperature environ- 
ment. Flux quantization can further be used to accomplish stable levltation 
of proof masses against gravity in a terrestrial environment and to enhance 
the gradlometer sensitivity by means of a "superconducting negative spring" 
[11]. 

Two schemes (current-differencing and displacement-differencing) of 
superconducting gravity gradlometer have been demonstrated by Paik e^ al^ [12]. 
Error models were analyzed by Wang [13]. Mapoles [14] has extended the de- 
velopment of a displacement-differencing gravity gradlometer. In this work, 
we have chosen the current-differencing scheme. One advantageous feature of 
the current-differencing gradlometer is the remote coupling of the two dif- 
ferencing acceleration transducers independent of their separation and their 
respective orientations. Therefore, three iti-line (or diagonal) component 
gradiometers can be combined together by mounting all three pairs of accelera- 
tion transducers on the six faces of a common cube, with the sensitive axes 
normal to the surfaces of the cube, to form a three-axis in-line component 
gravity gradlometer. Construction of cross (or off-diagonal) component 
gravity gradlometer is feasible by orienting the sensitive axes of the 
acceleration transducers perpendicular to the direction of the baseline. A 
tensor gravity gradlometer to measure all the six T^^ components has been 



-7- 



proposed [15] as a combination of the In-line and cross component gradlo- 

meters. 

While developing a three-axis gradiometer for precision gravity experi- 
ments in Earth's orbit [16], we have completed, with our colleague, a proto- 
type single-axis in-line component gradiometer. This instrument has been used 
to perform a laboratory null test of the gravitational inverse square law 
[17], The details of this gradiometer development are described in Ref. 18 in 
which the theory of the gradiometer has been given a new formulation with 
generalization and more rigor than the preliminary analysis in Ref. 13. This 
paper (I) is a modified version of this new theoretical analysis with an 
extended error model of the Instrument. Paper II presents the construction 
and test results of the gradiometer. Although we confine ourselves to the 
discussion of an in-line component gradiometer with a particular 
superconducting circuit chosen, the methods developed in these papers could 
easily be adapted to cross-component gradiometers and different 
superconducting circuits.

II. PRINCIPLE OF GRAVITY GRADIENT DETECTICN 

In this section we briefly review the basic princtnle of s^r>aT-af--tnff 
gravity signal from dynamical variables and set a basis for the error model 
developed in Section V. Let the instrument platform be moving with respect to 
an inertial frame with an instantaneous angular velocity Q(t) and linear 
acceleration a(t). Then, the accelerations of a proof mass observed in the 
two coordinate systems are related by the well-known equation [19] : 

(Jim ■ (01p. - 2 X (S -) ^ 2S , {§^^ . (|1_, .t.t .(3) 

Here the subscripts in and pJl represent the inertial and platform coordinate 
systems in which respective measurements are made. The second and third terms 
on the right-hand side are the centrifugal and the Coriolis accelerations, re- 
spectively. If (|)(r,t) is the gravitational potential in the inertial frame, 
the resulting acceleration of the proof mass with respect to the moving plat- 
form is given by 

|'(?,t) -= [^) 

dt P^ 

= - ^ 4.(r.t) - ^ X (^ X r) - 2^ X {^)^^ - {^]^^ x r - l(t) . (4) 

The Coriolis term produces a force perpendicular to the velocity in the plat- 
form coordinates and therefore drops out when the proof mass is confined to 
move in a single direction. The quantity g'(r,t) is what is measured by an 
accelerometer or a gravimeter undergoing an acceleration. 

It is clear from Eq, (4) that the linear acceleration term, - a(t), can 
be eliminated by a differential measurement over a spatial coordinate x^ :

one finds 



r'j(r,t) = r^j(r,t) - (Q^Qj - Q^6^.) + I e^.^ oc^(t) 



(8) 



Notice that the angular acceleration term is antisymmetric whereas the 
first two terms in Eq. (8) are symmetric tensors. Therefore, one can further 
drop a(t) by symmetrization of T ' : 

The centrifugal acceleration term can be taken out in principle by taking 
another spatial derivative: i.e., by means of a third order gravity gradio- 
meter. In practice, one measures Q with the aid of gyroscopes and removes the 
effect of the centrifugal acceleration by actively stabilizing the platform or 
by compensating the induced error. 

The diagonal component of the tensor, T/^^n = ^ii » ^*" ^^ measured by 
detecting the relative acceleration along the in-line direction between two

proof masses, separated In the x^ direction. The off-diagonal components 
'^(ii) ^'^ * *'^' howpvpr. requires four proof masses because of the symmetri- 
zation. The relative accelerations in the cross directions in two pairs of 
accelerometers, which are separated in the k^ and x^ directions, respectively, 
can be added to yield r^-.v. Notice that one can instead subtract these two 
signals to determine the antisynmetric component : 

J IK 

The angular acceleration of the platform can be obtained by inverting this 
equation : 



«k(t> = ^ijk ^lijl^^'t) . (11) 



A time integration of this vector then gives an alternative means of 
determining the angular velocity Q . 

A tensor gravity gradiometer with common mode readouts is therefore self- 
sufficient for true gravity detection [15], On the other hand, the device can 
measure true linear and angular accelerations of a moving platform by removing 
gravity-induced errors. Equation (4) shows that the gravitational field -^^ 
remains as the fundamental error in linear acceleration measurement after 
removing dynamical error terms. The gravity gradiometer comes to the rescue. 
Tlie gradient output V can be integrated over a spatial coordinate to determine 
-?(}>. Therefore, a true accelerometer requires an aid from a gradiometer. 

The symmetrization technique discussed above has been incorporated in the 
rotating gravity gradiometers [6, 7] whereas, in the floated gradiometer which 
has only two proof masses [8] , the angular motion of the gradiometer is 



-11- 



attenuated by floating the proof masses in a liquid. In the rotating 
gradiometers, the common mode acceleration g' is further rejected by its 
frequency characteristic. The gradient f, being a tensor of rank 2, is 
modulated at the second harmonic of the rotation frequency whereas the 
acceleration g' is modulated at the fundamental frequency by its vector nature 
[6]. A side benefit of this heterodyne detection is the translation of signal 
bandwidth away from the 1/f noise region of the instrument in frequency space. 
The mechanical rotation, however, brings in a penalty: additional, 
dynamically induced errors. From Eq. (8) one can clearly see, for example, 
the devastating effect of the angular velocity error 6Q, which now contributes 
a first order term 0(Q6Q) to the measurement. 

For the prototype superconducting gravity gradiometer, we have chosen a 
non-rotating configuration. The extreme stability of the superconducting 
sensing circuit, combined with the low noise of the SQUID amplifier down to 
low signal frequencies, permits a very high degree of common mode rejection 
without rotation. For orbital applications, however, the superconducting 
gradiometer could be rotated to its advantage by spinning the entire satellite 
quietly. 

The symmetric nature of f^^. has been used to construct a gravity 
gradiometer. Further, the trace of this tensor is constrained by the Poisson 
equation:

^ii ^^'^^ " - ^^<t)<^.t) = - 4TtG p(r,t), (12) 



which is a consequence of the inverse square law of the gravitational force. 
This leaves five Independent components for the gravity gradient tensor T^^ . 
With a three-axis diagonal component gravity gradiometer, the validity of Eq. 



-12- 



(12) could be tested by summing the three outputs and comparing the result 
with the local mass density p. This experiment has been proposed as a 
precision null test of the inverse square law [20] , and an early result of 
such an experiment has been reported [17], In an actual experiment, the 
measured quantity is the trace of F'/^jn: 



I r'(ii)(r,t) = - 4iiG p(r,t) + 2 Q^(t). (13) 
i 



It is therefore important to suppress or separate out the centrifugal 
acceleration term carefully in such an experiment.

III. DYHAMICS OF THE SUPERCGNDUCTIN6 GRAVITy GRADICMETER 

The superconducting gravity gradiometer consists of a pair of supercon- 
ducting acceleration transducers and a superconducting inductive load which is 
connected to a SQUID amplifier. The coupling between the transducers and the 
output load is provided by flux quantization. 

The principle of one acceleration transducer element is first discussed 
and its equation of motion is then derived. Each transducer communicates to 
the rest of the superconducting circuit only through one current component 
that flows through the transducer. In a coupled circuit of a pair of trans- 
ducers and a load, flux quantization imposes constraints to the supercon- 
ducting circuit. For detection purposes, the currents at the load , rather 
than the current through the transducers, are the observable quantities at the 
output. The complete dynamical equations are then linearized and expressed in 
terms of these currents, the respective displacements of the proof masses, to- 
gether vrtth the applied common and differential acceleration signals [21]. 
Because the gradiometer is a differential accelerometer over a finite base- 
line, the gradiometer must reject common acceleration signals. The conditions 
for a common mode balance is derived. The parameters used to accomplish the 
balance are the persistent, but adjustable, currents stored in various super- 
conducting loops. Further, a wideband common mode balance is shown to be 
possible by iteratively adjusting at least two current components. After 
balancing the common accelerations, only differential acceleration will be 
detected at the load. The transfer function of an applied differential 
acceleration to the corresponding current output at the load is derived. 

Throughout the remainder of this paper, a variable with time or frequency 
dependency will be written explicitly as such functions, whereas the average 
values of these variables will be denoted by the same notation as the 



-14- 



function, but with the functional dependency deleted. 

A. Principle of a Superconducting Acceleration Transducer 

The principle of the superconducting acceleration transducer Is illus- 
trated schematically in Fig, 1. Analysis of this device as a resonant trans- 
ducer for a gravitational wave antenna and as a sensitive accelerometer has 
been given previously in a different format [9], A superconducting proof 
mass, which is suspended by spring and is confined to one linear degree of 
freedom, responds to an acceleration signal with a displacement relative to a 
sensing coil. The Inductance of the coil Is then modulated, due to the 
Meissner effect, by the superconducting plane of the proof mass. The coil is 
connected to an output inductor through a superconducting path and a quantized 
magnetic flux is stored in the superconducting loop formed by the sensing and 
output Inductors. The current flow through the output inductor is modulated 
as a result of the Inductance modulation of the sensing coil. The persistent 
current provides the stability of the transducer scale factor. A low noise 
SQUID amplifier is then used as a dc current-to-voltage power amplifier to 
produce a readout. 

B. Analysis of a Single Acceleration Transducer 

The transfer of mechanical energy to electrical energy is accomplished at 
the sensing coil. In order that the sensing coil converts a displacement to a 
current more linearly within a transducer, a symmetrical pair of "pancake" 
colls are utilized. The coils are located on the opposite faces of the proof 
mass and are connected in parallel (Fig. 2). Each having winding density n^^ 
and area A^, the coils are at mean distances of dg and d^ from the respective 
superconducting planes of the proof mass. If the displacement of the proof

by 

Lg(t) = ti [dg + x(t)] = Lg + A x(t), (14a) 

I^(t) = /V [db - x(t)] = Lj, - A x(t). (14b) 



Here 



2 
A = Uq n^ Al, (15) 



where \i is the permeability in free space and 

La = <La(t)> , I^ = <Lb(t)>, (16) 

as was noted earlier concerning notation. 

Two current components are needed to characterize the electromagnetic 
state of the two sensing coils. One obvious choice of variables [9, 13] is 
the currents Ia(t) and Ii3(t) which flow through each of the two coils, so that 
the electromagnetic energy in the two coils is 



vem = I Vt) v^)^ + i vt) vt)^. (17) 



However, in order to make the analysis simpler, a different choice [18] of the 
two current variables can be made with the aim that the expression for the 
electromagnetic energy has as simple a denominator as possible. Such a way of 
choosing variables is a classical analog of the renormalization procedure in 



•18- 



quantum field theory. 

Before making the choice, we make two observations. The first 
observation is that the series inductance of the sensing coils is a constant 
[9]: 

Lg(t) = LgCt) + Lb(t) = L3 + Lb = Lg. (18) 

Consequently, the current I through the superconducting loop of these two 
inductors in series is also a constant because the trapped flux ^ u in this 
loop is quantized. The second observation is that the parallel combination of 
the two sensing coils has a constant denominator in the expression for its 
inductance : 

L^(t) L^(t) ^ 
V""^ - L^(t) + I^(t) " L^ f I^ f^a^ - (L3 - Lb) A x(t) - AV(t)]. 

(19) 

In fact, even the numerator of this parallel inductance will also be a 
constant up to the first order if the mean spacings d^ and d^ are matched so 
as to make L^ = Lj,. The nonlinearity of the inductance modulation is 
exhibited by the second order term in Eq. (19). 

Expressed in terms of one parameter ffg^ and one current variable i(t), 
which flows through the parallel combination of Lg(t) and ^^(.t) , the 
electromagnetic energy has a constant denominator and has thus acquired a 
"renorraalized" form: 

""m-^TT^^lV^ i^(t). (20) 



-19- 



It Is straightforward to show that the expressions in Eqs. (17) and (20) are 
equivalent to each other [18]. 

The only variable i(t), once the parameter I or 9^^^ is fixed, possesses 
all the dynamical information in the electromagnetic system of the transducer. 
As the Inductances L (t) and Ljj(t) are modulated by the displacement of the 
proof mass, the current i(t) must always split between the two inductors 
according to the inverse ratio of the respective inductances in order to pro- 
duce equal and opposite magnetic flux contributions to the superconducting 
loop formed by the series inductor L^ + Ljj. The net currents lg^(t) and I^Ct) 
through L^Cf) and L|j(t) are therefore the following linear combinations of I 
and i(t):

where ^^(t) and \(t) denote magnetic fluxes in Lg(t) and I^(t), respectively. 
In terms of I and i(t), this force can be rewritten as 

, L (t) - L (t) 



-20- 



The total force acting on the proof mass consists of this magnetic force 
together v»ith a restoring force of the mechanical s"rin«»' suspension "f ♦"h^ 
proof mass and any externally applied force, f(t), on the proof mass relative 
to the platform of the sensing coils. We will ignore the effects of damping 
term for the time being. When the proof mass m is approximated as a point 
mass located at its center of mass r, the external force becomes 



f(t) = m n • g'(r,t) , (24) 



where n is the unit vector along the direction of the sensitive axis, and 
g'(r,t) is the specific force given by Eq. (4). The equation of motion for 
the proof mass in the platform frame can now be written as 

x'(t) + <4 x'(t) + I [I + I \\ L. ^ ' i(t)] i(t) = n . |'(?,t) ,(25)

where oi^ is the angular resonance frequency of the mechanical spring. An 
alternative derivation of this equation, in which an electromechanical 
Lagrangian approach is used for the superconducting transducer, is found in 
Ref. 18. 

The dc component of Eq. (25) defines the equilibrium position, x , of the 
proof mass. This position is shifted from the relaxed position of the 
mechanical spring by Earth's gravity, g , and by a dc magnetic force. Substi- 
tuting

where <l»p(r) , ^„ and \ are, respectively, Earth's gravitational potential, 
spin angular velocity, and the geocentric position vector of the coordinate

The linearized equation of motion for the ac part, after Fourier trans-

There are two independent superconducting loops in the circuit. The flux

representing j. as a constant. An additional constralut in the uynamical

Simultaneous equations (29) and (33) determine the dynamics of a single

for the proof masses in the transducers, being similar to Eq. (29), are 
written as

A i.. AI^ 



Here, the geometries of the sensing colls are again assumed to be identical so 
that they can be represented by a single parameter A. defined by Eq, (15). 
Also, the two flux quantization constraints In the superconducting loops L|^g + 
l^Yf have again been used In deriving Eq. (37). Two more constraints, similar 
to Eq. (33), are obtained by using flux quantization conditions in two other 
independent superconducting loops such as ^^(^^(t) + Lq. However, a generaliza- 
tion from Eq. (33) is needed here because the current through L^ is now the 
sum of the current outputs from each transducer. The linearized constraints 
are therefore given by 

A Ij^ Xj^(a)) = Lj^p 1^(0)) + L^ [1^(0)) + t^i^^)] . (38) 

Notice that these two equations are coupled through ij((o) and i2(w). 

The dynamics of the gradlometer, governed by the four coupled equations 
(37) and (38) in the four variables x^(a)) and l^^(w), has two degrees of 



-25- 



freedom. Each of the two transducers couple to the rest of the circuit 
through one single current signal, ij(w) or i2(w). Depending on the signature 
of the applied acceleration components, these current modulations can add or 
subtract at the output inductor L^. It is therefore convenient to use a new 
set of current variables i^jCw) and ij.(w) defined by the sum and half of the 
difference of the two transducer currents. In terms of ijC'jj) and i^Cu), the 
transducer currents ij((jj) and i2(w) can be expressed as 



iv(a)) = T idCw) + (-1)'' i^(w). (39)

Notice that ijj(«) is the actual current flowing through L^ and detected by the

The four parameters oi^^ and oi^^^ are, in general, not the two resonances 
of the gradloraeter. Nevertheless, comparing the expressions for these para- 
meters with Eqs. (34) and (35) suggests intuitive meaning to these nonobserv- 
ables . Thus , Wj^^ can represent the angular resonance frequencies that the two 
transducers would separately have if they were each connected to a short- 
circuited load. A short-circuited load arises in these models because, when 
i^(a)) = in the gradiometer circuit, the two transducers are driving the 
current i(,(t«)) in a push-pull manner, contributing zero impedance to each 
other. Likewise, tOj^j can represent the angular resonance frequencies that the 
two transducers would separately have if they were each loaded with an 
inductance of 2L but were otherwise decoupled from each other. The 
appearance of 2Lq here is due to the equal contributions of currents y id(w) 
to the signal at Lq. Thus, under the restriction i^i^) - 0, the flux 
modulation produced by each transducer at L^ as seen by the transducer itself 
is doubled by the presence of the other transducer. The transfer functions of 
these separated model accelerometers are given from Eq. (43) as

D. Goanon Mode Balance and Gradloneter Transfer Function 

For operation as a gradiometer in the presence of common accelerations, 
the transducers need to be tuned such that H . (w) = 0. No common acceleration 
signal will then appear at the output load L^, and the coupled acceleration 
transducers are said to operate in a "gradiometer mode". On the other hand. 



-28- 



parameters can be chosen such that H (co) vanishes instead. Then, the output 
will respond only to common accelerations and the system is said to operate in 
an "accelerometer mode" . The acceleroraeter mode operation is a powerful means 
of obtaining a precise calibration of the gradiometer. A detailed discussion 
of the accelerometer mode is found in Section IVB of Paper II. From Eq. 
(46b), the common mode balance is obtained when 



-Ai; m: 

- . (48) 



(-Ic - <^'> % ^4c - '^'> hp ' 

This balance condition can be satisfied at any single frequency by adjusting 
only one persistent current parameter. Balancing over a small frequency range 
near dc appears sufficient for normal low-frequency use of the gradiometer in 
which 0) « Wj^, 0)2^,. In the terrestial environment, however, the 
environmental vibrations occur in a wideband and are very large compared with 
the extremely weak gravitational signals. A wideband balance will help to 
immunize the gradiometer against such environmental vibrations. 

The four current components, Ij^ , I2, ij , and i2 , do provide more than 
sufficient degrees of freedom to tune for wideband balance. In principle, Eq. 
(48) becomes an identity if 

^Ic = "^Ic (^9a) 



and 



A i; A li 

-j-^ = -^ (49b) 

L, ^2 



Ip "2p 
are simultaneously satisfied. However, direct matching of Wj^^ is not 

-29- 



practical because these equivalent resonances are observable only when the 
output load Is shorted and when the two transducers are also decoupled 
mechanically [18]. In the experiment, a wideband balance can be achieved 
Instead by iterating the balance at two frequencies. Tuning I^ or I2 to 
balance out an applied common acceleration at a high frequency (u » w^^, (a)2(,) 
will achieve the condition (49b). This adjustment is followed by tuning of ij 
or 12 for balance at a low frequency (u « w^^,, '»'2c^» y^^^^^^S 

\ i: , 'v I' 

I L = _i £. r49c) 

^Ic ^P ''2c 2P 

The latter operation will, In general, affect the previous balance (49b), and 
iteration between the two balance procedures is needed. When the conditions 
(49b) and (49c) are both satisfied, the condition (49a) follows. This fre- 
quency-independent balance has been applied in the experiment and Is reported 
In Paper II. 

Upon substitution of Eq. (48) Into Eq. (46a), H .(u) assumes a simple 
form: 

r„d , .,-1 ,2 2v o 2 Ip . / 2 2v o 2 2p /cn\ 

[Hg^(a))] = (0,^^ - 0) ) — :j5^T — ^ + ("2d - " ) —rq -(^o) 

Notice that the transfer function of a balanced gradlometer becomes the 
harmonic mean of the transfer functions of the two separated model 
accelerometers, given by Eq. (47a). 

When the common mode balance Is not precise, H . (co) * constitutes an 
error coefficient. This error, which will be discussed in Section V, is 
obtained from Eqs. (46) as

In the foregoing analysis, the transducer has been approximated as a linear 
system. The dynamical equations (25) and (32), however, are nonlinear in 
nature so that the response current i^(.iji) must contain nonlinear terms in 
general, in addition to the linear terms shown in Eq. (45). These nonlinear 
terras may not drop out even when H . (u) = 0. The scale factor nonlinearity 
therefore constitutes an important error source, which will be discussed in 
Section V of this paper and in Appendix B of Paper II. 



E. Equivalent Accelerometer Representation 

With two coupled acceleration transducers in the gradiometer, only the 
differential acceleration is the measured signal at L^. The common accelera- 
tion drops out upon balance. Therefore, a convenient representation of the 
gradiometer is a single (differential) accelerometer which converts a dif- 
ferential acceleration into a signal current. Such a representation involves 
identification of the gradiometer transfer function with the parameters of a 
single accelerometer , as discussed in Section IIIB. These parameters include 
a resonance frequency, a mass and the parameters of a superconducting circuit. 

The two normal mode resonance frequencies of the gradiometer are some 
weighted average of the parameters Uj^^ and ^2^, for the common mode and also 
some other weighted average of Wj^^j and (1)2^ for the differential mode. In the 
particular case of wideband balance, 03^^ and 0)2^, are equal to each other and 
hence equal to the common mode angular resonance frequency, denoted by u^.. 
The differential mode angular resonance frequency, denoted by u^, is then 
defined from the singularity of H . (w) in Eq. (50). In practice, the gradio- 
meter need only be balanced at a limited frequency band of the signal. Then, 



-31- 



Eq. (50) is only valid in this limited frequency band. Therefore, the exact 
differential mode resonance is determined from the singularity of H .(a)) In 
the more general equation (46a). Yet, as far as signal transduction within 
the limited signal frequency band is concerned, we can still use Eq. (50) to 
define u)q.

While there is freedom in defining the individual circuit parameters 
which appear on the lefthand side of Eq. (52), one natural choice is to 
identify L^ with the load inductance and ly, with the output inductance of the 
superconducting circuit: 

P Ip 2p 

Then, the current parameter I' is defined by Eq. (52). With the aid of Eqs.

The transfer function in Eq. (53), has only characterized the overall 
signal transduction of the gradioraeter. The intrinsic noise of the gradio- 
raeter will be given in Section IV in terras of Brownian motion noise and 
amplifier noise. For a single spring-mass system, the Brownian motion depends 
on the mass and the fluctuating force of the spring. Therefore, once the 
effective mass in the equivalent acceleroraeter representation is determined, 
the Brownian motion of the two coupled acceleration transducers in the dif- 
ferential mode can be derived using this equivalent single spring-mass model. 
This effective mass requires a unique definition in order to give the correct 
Brownian motion noise of the gradioraeter and must therefore be derived from 
the dynamics of the gradioraeter. 

Dynamically, the gradioraeter consists of two coupled masses connected to 
the platform and to each other by three springs. Thus, the homogeneous 
equations of motion of the two proof masses are obtained by eliminating ii^Cw) 
from Eqs. (37) and (38):

Now, we need to find out what displacement variable, xAoi) , cause the signal 
current ij(a)). Thus, we break up the signal transduction Into two 
intermediate steps: g(j(w) to xj(u) and then x^Cw) to i|j((»)). From Eqs. (41)

The effective mass is therefore the inertia for the coupled spring mass system 
of Eqs. (57) - (59) towards the motion x^(ui) of Eq. (62). 

We next note that a simple scaling of the two separate displacement 
variables.

because, under these scaling, the dynamical equation (60) is invariant in form 
and both the kinetic and potential energies (within the frequency range of 
common mode balance) remain unchanged. 

Now, the effective mass corresponding to x^((j)) of Eq. (64) is Just the 
reduced mass of ra| and m^. By using Eqs. (63) and (65a), this effective mass, 
denoted by m, can be shown to satisfy a simple formula:

IV. NOISE AND OPTIMIZATION 

In the light of the equivalent accelerometer model given in Section HIE, 
the fundamental noise terms of the gradlometer will be derived by treating the 
gradiometer as a single accelerometer. In this section, we introduce damping 
and consider its effects. 

A. Transducer Brownlan Motion Noise 

The fundamental noise source of a spring-mass system at a temperature T 
is the Brownian motion of the harmonic oscillator at that temperature. The 
force of the spring on the proof mass undergoes random fluctuations. The 
spectral density of such force fluctuations at the resonance frequency Uq of 
the oscillator is related, by the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem, to the 
damping of the oscillator at resonance. 

In applying the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem, emphasis is made here 
that measurement of relaxation time xCWq) or quality factor Q(Wq) = (ji)qT((»)q) 
gives information on the force fluctuations only at 0)^. The Langevin equation 

is a modification of the equation of motion in Section III by including a 

T 
damping term and an acceleration noise g (u) term: 

t-"^ '■V(^'-%^ ^^'^^ = Sn ^''^' ^^^^ 

o 

Thus the energy of the oscillator at a temperature T: 



m (/ <x2(t)> = kg T, (68) 



where 



-36- 



<x2(t)> = /^ x(a)) x*(a)) du, (69) 

is dominated by its spectral density at resonance. Use of Eqs. (67) - (69) 
gives the Nyquist formula: 

o 
where S (to ) is the spectral density [22] of the acceleration noise g''^ at u^. 

5 O Ofl O 

The force or acceleration fluctuations at a signal frequency in « (ji is 
in general different from that at to^ because the noise could have a compli- 
cated frequency dependence which is governed by the nature of the loss 
mechanisms in the spring. The noise at u) due to force fluctuations in the 
spring is obtained from Eq. (70) with •t(a)Q) replaced by t((o) : 



s'^(ca) = - k T —~ . (71) 



A direct measurement of T(a)) requires shifting the resonance frequency from w 
to (0. In principle, one can increase the mass m or use a "negative spring" 
[11] so that the new spring-mass system indeed resonates at u and therefore 
the Q factor of this new system can be measured. From a knowledge of the new 
mass used or of the loss in the negative spring, the dissipation in the 
original spring can be determined. 

The Q factor of the accelerometer depends on both the mechanical and the 
electrical parameters because the electromechanical spring of the accelero- 
meter has contributions from a mechanical spring and two electromagnetic 
springs, in the ratio given by the three terms in Eq. (35), for the total 
spring constant and hence for the stored ac energy at cOq. The power loss in 



-37- 



each of these constituent springs is then proportional to this ratio of stored 
ac energies in these springs divided by a certain relaxation time at Wq. 
Therefore, the following relationship for the relaxation times results from 
the obvious observation that, at (O^, the total ac power loss is the sum of the 
power losses in the respective springs : 

Here i^UOq) , t:±(^o) and tj-.CUo) are the relaxation times that each spring 
would have if it is separately resonated at Oq, and y and P are the transducer 
energy coupling coefficients via i and I' defined by

In order to reduce dissipation in all the constituent springs, choice of 
material and geometry, material treatment, surface preparation as well as 
choice of electrical parameters must be optimized. 

B. SQUID ilapllfier Noise 

A SQUID can be modelled as an ideal current-to-voltage amplifier having 
an input inductor L^ and two noise generators for its voltage and current 
noise with spectral densities 8^(0)) and S j(u) , respectively, at the amplifier 
input (see Fig. 4a) [23], 

The optimum source impedance, (Sy/Sj)^'^, is much smaller than the para- 
sitic impedance wl^ unless L^ is tuned out (at one frequency) to noise match

the Input impedance. Therefore, when the SQUID is used as a wideband ampli- 
fier, the noise is dominated by Sj and can be characterized by an "Input 
energy sensitivity" : 

E^(w) = J l^ Sj((id). (74) 

In a practical gradioraeter design, the transducer output Inductance Lp is 
usually larger than I^ and a superconducting transformer is desired to bridge 
between l^ and I^. The equivalent load, representing l^ and the transformer, 
seen by the transducer is an inductor L^ : 

where k^, Lj and Lj^ are the magnetic-field coupling constant, the primary and 

the secondary inductances of the transformer. The ratio of the power being 

detected in Lj^ to the power sent from L, to L^ is the forward power transfer 

function H^'^^(a)) of the transformer and can be shown to be given by a fre- 
p

which has the equlvalei'it carrent noise S'(uj), as shown in Fig. 4b. 

The quantity of interest is the equivalent (differential) acceleration 
noise at the transducer that would correspond to the amplifier noise of Eq. 
(77), The conversion from current noise to differential acceleration noise is

C. Potential Sensitivity 

The fundamental noise of the gradioraeter is the sum of its Brownian 
motion noise and SQUID amplifier noise. In terms of an equivalent gravity 
gradient noise P , the spectral density of the gradiometer noise is 



SM = -y [Sg(a)) + Sg(a))] , (86) 



where i Is the length of the baseline between the two proof masses. 
Substitution from Eqs. (71) and (79) gives the one-sided noise spectral

'"^'^^77^^^'^'^^'^^ ' ^''^ 



where a factor 2it has been dropped from Eq. (71) by going from the angular 
frequency domain to the frequency domain. Here, the numeral 4 will become 8 
if m^ is used instead of the reduced mass m. 

In the usual case when t^ > Tj?, the optimum value for I' satisfies an 
inequality: 

a2i'2 

Q< m(L Tl) <1-1' (««> 

o p 

Toward the lower bound, the power coupled to the SQUID tends to zero. Toward 
the upper bound, the Brownian motion noise term increases because of the rela- 
tively short Tjt. If the amplifier noise dominates, the choice is made at the 
upper bound. If this bound is exceeded, the electromechanical spring has be- 
come so stiff that a given acceleration signal applied to the proof mass is 
producing less displacement, thus making it more difficult for the supercon- 
ducting circuit to measure. 

The SQUID input energy sensitivity E^(f) is usually a white noise plus a 
1/f noise at very low frequencies. In addition, a dc drift can be caused by a 
temperature drift of the gradiometer [14], The drift changes the penetration 
depth and hence the inductances of the superconducting circuit [24], Tempera- 
ture related drifts can be suppressed by regulating the temperature or be 
balanced out with an improved circuit [25]. This and other errors are the 
subject that will be considered in Section V. The noise given in Eq. (87) 
represents the fundamental noise of the gradiometer which can be reached only 



-43- 



when other instrument errors are suppressed sufficiently. However, having 
very low fundamental noise in the gradiometer itself is a prerequisite for 
achieving the desired high sensitivity.

V. ERROR MGDEL (F THE INSTRDMENT 

As we have seen in Section II, the gradioraeter measures in general a 
differential gravity signal superposed with specific pseudoforces such as 
centrifugal acceleration and angular acceleration. In addition, the large dc 
gravity bias is modulated by the motion of the platform, resulting in error 
signals which compete with the ac signals under investigation. Thermal and 
electromagnetic fluctuations of the environment can also be coupled to the 
gradiometer. It is important to have a complete error model of the instrument 
because, for many applications, errors could dominate over the gravity 
gradient signals and therefore must be compensated for to recover the true 
signals. We start this section with a derivation of general expressions for 
the driving accelerations gj(t) and g(,(t). We will then elaborate on specific 
error sources. The kinematic and dynamic error mechanisms discussed in this 
section are independent of the particular electrical circuit chosen for the 
superconducting gradiometer. Hence our results have general applicability 
beyond the specific instrument discussed in this paper. 

A. Geonetrical Metrology Errors 

Let us consider the case In which the gradiometer is used to measure a 
time-varying in-line component gravity gradient at r in the direction of a 
unit vector n fixed in the laboratory frame: 

^nn ^^'^^ = - (n . ^)^ (t)(r,t) . (89) 

Let r. and r- represent the actual position vectors for the centers of mass of 

A A 

the two proof masses mj^ and m2, and n^ and n2 be the unit vectors representing 
the actual sensitive axes of the two component accelerometers, as Indicated In 



-45- 



Fig. 5. Let p and I represent the average proof mass position vector and the 
baseline vector of the gradiometer, respectively, so that 



r^= p - f . (90a) 



r2 H p + f . (90b) 



Ideally, one wants p = r. In general, one has a gradiometer position 
error 6p : 



p = r + 5p . (91) 



A A A . 

Likewise, in an ideal gradiometer, n. , n_ and H = J./i are perfectly 

A 

aligned to each other and are oriented along n. In a practical gradiometer, 
however, there are various alignment and orientation errors. The axes 
alignment errors consist of the misalignmeat between the sensitive axes of the 
two accelerometers : 

AAA 

6n_ = n2 - n^ , (92) 

and the misalignment between the average direction of the sensitive axes and 
the direction of the baseline Z = I/A: 



6n . = y (n + n ) - i . (93) 



These alignment errors will be shown to cause coupling to the gravity gradient 

A 

output from the common linear acceleration component along the 6n_ direction 



-46-

-47- 



and from the angular acceleration component along the 6n ^ x n direction. The 
gradiometer orientation error is due to the directions A and (n„ + n.)/2 being 

A A A 

misoriented from n by 6A and 6 n <, , respectively: 

+n 



i = n + 5Z , (94a) 



J (n2 + n^ = n + 6n ^ , (94b) 

+n 



and will be shown to cause coupling from the differential acceleration 

A A 

component along the 6A + 6n ^ direction. Notice that only one of the two 

+n 
quantities 6A and 6n ^ in conjunction with the misalignment 6n ^ in Eq. (93) 

+n +Z 

Is sufficient to define the mlsorlentation of the gradiometer. Introducing 

additional notations in Eqs. (94), however, have the advantage of simplifying 

expressions for mlsorlentation errors by avoiding explicit reference to the 

misalignment parameters, defined within the gradiometer hardware. 

In order to find the specific forces acting on raj and m2, Eqs. (90) are 

substituted Into Eq. (4). After Taylor series expansion In 1, one finds 

•(?,,t) = - ^[1 - (| • ^) + yf (| • ^)^ - ^ (| • V)^ + ...] (t>(p,t)

where we dropped the Corlolls terms assuming a rectilinear compliance of the 



-48- 



proof mass suspension. In general, p and I are also time-varying due to the 
translational and rotational motions of the platform with respect to an 
inert ial frame. 

In Section TUB, we defined as the acceleration signal the time-varying 
part over the constant background gravity of Earth. Since we are now 
interested in the mechanisms which modulate the Earth's bias to produce error 
signals, we consider in this section the response of the gradiometer to the 
total accelerations: 



*. y> 



g^(t) = n^ . g'(r^,t) = g^(t) + n • g^Cr) . (96) 



We return at the end to the signal variables g|^(t) to connect back to the 
analyses presented in earlier sections. With Earth's gravity vector g„(r) as 
defined by Eq. (28), the last equality in Eq. (96) can be viewed as a rigorous 
re-definition of gj^(t). Here a point-mass (or a spherical-mass) approximation 
of the proof masses has been used to avoid volume integration of g'(r, ,t) over 
the finite dimensions of the proof masses. 

The total common and differential accelerations for the gradiometer , 
defined in a similar fashion as g(.(t) and gj(t) in Eq. (40), can now be shown 
to be 



g'(t) = (n + 6n .) . g'^(p,t) + i 6n • g'^(p,t) , (97a) 
+n d dI 

g^(t) = 6n_ . g' (p,t) + (n + 5n .) . g' (p,t) , (97b) 
d +n dI 

where g' (p,t) and g' (p,t) are the total true common and differential

accelerations acting at p ± A/2 ;

Here a(p) is the total linear acceleration experienced at p; 



a(p) =Bx(6xp)+axp+a, (99) 

and the time dependencies have been omitted on the rlghthand side of Eqs. (98) 

for notational simplicity. 

Equations (97) through (99) are in the platform frame representation. It 

is straightforward to convert these equations into the laboratory frame 

representation by substituting Eqs. (91), (93) and (94). The relative 

uncertainties between the two frames, 6p , 6n ^ and 6A, then constitute new 

+n 
error sources. Thus, it can be shown that Eqs. (97) become

-50- 



gradloraeter" can be defined by the average of (n + n„)/2 and A. 



B. General Description of Errors 

The accelerations in Eqs. (100) contain two types of error sources. The 
first type is intrinsic error sources due to angular motions as given in Eqs. 
(4) and (8), the second type is in geometrical metrology. Further error 
sources arise from non-ideal behaviors of the mechanical and electrical 
springs, scale factor mismatch. Incorrect calibration, and residual coupling 
of the gradloraeter to temperature and electromagnetic fluctuations of the 
environment, etc. Equation (45) can therefore be generalized as 



^d^^^ = "gi^'^) Sc^^^ + H^i(") gdCt^) + HqI^"^ ^'cc^*^) + «Gi^'^^ ^dd(<^> 



+ H^J(a)) G^^(oi) + H^^(a)) T^(a)) + Hj^(a)) T^(^) + ..., (101) 



where 0^.^(0)), Gjj(u3) and Gj,jj(a)) are the Fourier transforms of 

G(,c(t) = [gc(t)]^, (102a) 

Gdd<t) = [gi(t)]^, (102b) 

Gcd(t) = gc(t)gd(t), (102c) 

and Tj.(w) and T^(oi) are the Fourier transforms of the common and differential 
temperature fluctuations, Tj,(t) and T^j(t), over the two transducers, defined 
in Eqs. (A26). The coefficients in front of these functions represent the 
transfer functions for the signal variables that they are multiplied with. 

-51- 



The centrifugal acceleration and the linear and angular accelerations, which 
are coupled to the gradlometer due to its metrology errors, appear in Eq. 
(101) through errors in g(.(w) and gjj(w) that they cause. 

Notice that Eq. (101) contains the original signal variables, g^^^) ^^^ 
gj(u), which are identical to g'(«) and g'(u) due to the relationships: 

g^,(t) = g;(t) - n . g^(?) , (103a) 

gd(t) = g^(t) , (103b) 

which follow from Eq. (96). Equations (103) imply that the errors in the 
unprimed variables are given by the errors in the primed variables : 



6gc(t) = 5g^(t) , (104a) 



6gd(t) = 6g^(t) . (104b) 

It is also clear that the Fourier components of the errors are also 
identifical between the two sets of variables. Equations (100) and (103) can 
be combined to obtain the unperturbed acceleration signals : 



g^,o(a)) = g^^(a)) = n • [g(r,a)) - t(r,u))] , (105a) 



gdo(«) = gdo^"^ = A n . [f(r,a)) - C (u)] • n , (105b) 



where g(r,a)), a(r,a)), r(r,a)) and C (co) are the Fourier transforms of 



-52- 



g(r,t) = - ^<J)(r,t) = - ^(|)p(r,t) - ^(|)g(r) , (106a) 



a(r,t) = tp(r,t) + ^^ x [^^ x (t^ + r)] , (106b) 



f(?,t) = - ^(t>(r,t) = - ^(t.p(r,t) - ^(Dg(r) , (106c) 



C (t) = ^(t) ^(t) -Q^(t) I . 



(106d) 



Here (})g(r), Q^ and R^ are Earth's variables Introduced In Eq. (28); (|) (r,t) 
and ap(r,t) are the gravitational potential and the linear acceleration 
measured relative to Earth; and C (t) is the "centrifugal accelerator tensor." 
The dyadic notation is used in Eqs. (106) to represent rank-2 tensors. The 
first terra in Eq. (105b) is A times the gravity gradient signal rj^^^(r,u)) to be 
measured. 



It is useful to divide Eq. (101) by Jl H^^(a)) to obtain an equation of the 



form: 



f^nn(^.")]measured "17^= f^nn<^'"^J true ^j} ^^d.i^") ' ^'^'^ 



where 6g<j^i(w) is the equivalent error in the differential acceleration gj(a)) 
due to the i-th type error source. Derivation and discussion of 6go , for 
various error sources are given in Appendix. Equation (107) can be converted 
into another convenient form:

where 6cTp(ii)) and 60^(10) are the (dimensionless) calibration error coefficients 
for f(r,w) and C (u) , respectively. It is assumed that the zeroth order part 
of C ((o) has been measured independently and removed from the gradlometer out- 
put. Otherwise, 6a (o)) must be replaced by unity. The common acceleration 
error coefficient is read off Eq. (A21): 



e^^(a)) = - Sjin X ^^S^'^^ " ^^ " ^Jln> J (^"->A ' ^^^^^^ 



where 6ag(co) is the (dimensionless) scale factor mismatch between two 
constituent accelerometers. The coefficient for the first-order angular

where 6Qp = S- has been assumed and e^j^ is the totally antisymmetric tensor

Unlike in some conventional gravity gradlmeters, matching of proof masses 
and spring constants are not necessary in the superconducting device because 
the balance is achieved by tuning persistent currents. However, the alignment 
of the sensitive axes of the proof masses J^ still Important, 

The temperature error coefficient can be determined from the results of 
Section H of Appendix. Depending on the relative magnitude of the two 
competing thermal effects, the error coefficient can be written as 



e^(a)) = ^h^^(a)) , (109e) 



where h (u) is given by Eq. (A42a), or by 



Tc 



J(,,) = I 5<,g(^) g^ ^os 9^ ^ ^ , (I09e') 



where E(T) is the Young's modulus of the spring material at temperature T. 
In Paper II, we discuss the observed values or limits of these major 
error coefficients. Once these error coefficients have been determined ex- 
perimentally, the relevant dynamic variables can be measured simultaneously 
along with the gravity gradient by Independent instrumentation and the respec- 
tive errors can be compensated for by using the error model derived in this 
section and Appendix. In a three-axis gradloraeter, it is possible to suppress 
several error sources by using the geometrical properties of the device [18].

VI. SUMMARY AND CGNCLUSION 

A gravity gradiometer is a fundamental Instrument which can separate 
gravity from frame accelerations. A sensitive tensor gravity gradiometer 
needs to be developed to carry out precision tests on gravity as well as for 
applications in gravity survey and inertial navigation. Since a large common 
mode background has to be removed in gradiometry by differencing signals at 
two or more proof masses, extreme stability is required for the sensitive axis 
orientation and for the scale factors of the component acceleroraeters . We 
have shown how these challenges can be met at low temperatures by utilizing 
the stability of persistent currents, the enhanced mechanical stability of 
materials and the sensitivity of SQUID amplifiers. An accompanying penalty is 
of course the inconvenience of having to keep the instrument in liquid helium. 
The liquid helium environment, however, can be used further to isolate the 
gradiometer from the fluctuations in the ambient temperature and electro- 
magnetic fields. 

In this paper, we have analyzed a superconducting current-differencing 
gravity gradiometer. Complete dynamical equations have been derived from the 
first principles. Transfer functions, common mode balance conditions and 
procedures as well as a rather extensive error model have been developed from 
these equations. The complicated differential instrument has been reduced to 
an equivalent accelerometer which simplifies the noise analysis and the 
electronic control of the device. In Paper II, we report the performance of 
the superconducting gradiometer in the laboratory, which verifies details of 
the theory developed here. Although our analysis has been confined to a 
specific instrument reported in Paper II, the theoretical methods presented in 
this paper will be a useful guide in analyzing other superconducting inertial 
instruments that may be developed in the future.

APPENDIX: DERIVATIGN OF VARIOUS EEROR. COEFFICIBNTS 
A. Finite Size Effects 

There are two error sources related to the finite dimensions of a 
practical gradioraeter: (1) the finite volume of the proof masses and (2) the 
finite baseline of the instrument. The first effect can be minimized by 
choosing a nearly spherical geometry for the proof masses, whereas the second 
effect is reduced when the baseline length A = \x.\ is shortened. The finite 
baseline effect has been taken into account in Eqs. (95) by the Taylor expan- 
sion in I. The finite volume effect has been ignored in the previous analysis 
because of its high order nature. The departure from a spherical geometry 
gives a nonvanishing quadrupole moment to each proof mass or a small octupole 
moment to the gradiometer. Since this will couple at best to the fourth order 
derivatives of (t)(p,t), which is generally small except when the source is 
extremely close to the gradiometer, this error can be ignored in most situa- 
tions. Clearly, the finite volume error is always smaller than the finite 
baseline error. 

The dominant gravity error terms arising from the finite baseline are 
obtained from Eqs. (97) and (98).

When <t)(p,t) varies with a characteristic length R, these errors become

ignored when A/R « 1 .

B. Misposltlon of the Gradloneter 



Tlie acceleration errors due to the inisposltion of the grariloniptftr are 



obtained from Eqs. (4) and (100):

c,p 

6g _^(t) = - Jl (n . ^)[n . ^^(|)(r) • 6p] , (A2b) 

d,p 

to the leading order in 6p. These errors are usually negligible because of 
the higher order gradients involved. The displacement 5p(t), produced by the 
linear acceleration a(r,t), modulates the large dc gravity of Earth and 
produces errors that compete with ac signals: 



6g ,(t) = (^ gj . (A3a)

where gg = 9.8 m s~^, Tg = 3.1 x 10^ E and Rg = 6.4 x 10° m are the vertical 
gravitational acceleration, the vertical gravity gradient and the radius of 
Earth. It is clear that these errors can be ignored in general because 
6p(t)/RE « 1. 

C. Misalignment and Mlsorlentatlon of the Gradlometer 

The acceleration errors caused by the misalignments , 6n and 6n ^, and 

the misorientations , 6n ^, and 6A, are obtained from Eqs. (100):

Ilence these errors cause the cross components of the common acceleration and

In Eq. (A6b) , the misalignments within the gradiometer are expressed in 

A 

terms of the misalignment 6n_ of the acceleroraeter axes with respect to each 

A 

other and the misalignment 6n ^ between the average accelerometer axis

(n^ + n„)/2 and the baseline direction A. These errors cause coupling to 



-60- 



cross components of linear and angular accelerations which can be large com- 
pared with acceleration gradient signals o£ liiterest. The combinsd error 

6n A + 6A appearing in the second term of Eq. (A6b) represents the mis- 

+n 
orientation of the gradioraeter sensitive axis relative to the theoretical 

direction n fixed to the laboratory frame, which is used for interpretating 

the data. This raisorientation produces coupling to cross gradients. 

The coupling to the gradiometer from the dynamic variables of the plat- 

A A 

form, a(p,t), ^(t) and a(t), are revealed in Eqs. (A6). Since i and 6n are 
time-varying in general due to Q(t), the large dc gravity of Earth, (|)g(p), 
will te modulated to produce errors at the frequency of interest. This 
important error mechanism will be studied In detail in the next section. 

D. Angular Motions of the Platform 

The centrifugal acceleration appears without attenuation in Eq. (105b) in 
direct competition with the gravity gradient signal. This problem is funda- 
mental in any second-order gradiometer, in-line or cross compooent, as is 
evidenced by Eq. (9), and therefore does not depend on the particular design 
of the instrument. This makes the attitude control or detection as the most 
formidable task in precision gravity gradiometry. One can easily compute the 
required attitude rate (^) accuracy from Eq. (105b) for a given sensitivity of 

r. 

When the instrument is in a laboratory rotating at an angular velo- 
city ^ (t) with respect to an inertial frame, it is convenient to define 



^(t) = ^^(t) + ^p(t) . (A7) 



If uncertainties in ^ (t) and ^_(t) are 6^ (t) and 5^^(t), respectively, then 

O r O r 



-61- 



the error in the differential acceleration due to centrifugal acceleration is 
obtained from Eqs. (105b), (106d) and (A7) as 



6g Jt)=-2il{n'(.^^ + ^p)}{n«(6^^ +6^p)}-(6^ + ^p).(6^ +6^p)]. 
d, C 

(A8) 



If the gradloraeter platform is moving with a velocity v(t) with respect 
to Earth and the gradiometer is in a local geographic orientation, then ^ (t) 
is given by 



^^(t) = ^g + R^^ ^ X v(t) , (A9) 



where Q and IL, are the angular velocity and radius vectors of Earth, intro- 
duced in Eq. (28). In the case when the platform is stationary with respect 
to Earth; i.e. v(t) = 0, Eq. (AS) reduces, after Fourier transformation, to 

6g Jui) = -H [(n . ^p){n . 5^_(a))} - ^_. • 6^_(a))] , (AlO) 
d,C E P E P 

where we have assumed the condition Qp « Qg = 7.27 x 10"^ rad s~^ , which is 
not difficult to satisfy for a stationary platform. 

In a terrestrial laboratory, the modulation of Earth's gravity bias by 
the tilt of the sensitive axes is another important error mechanism, as was 
pointed out in Section C of this Appendix. Since the common mode errors in 
Eq. (A6a) produce second order errors in the differential signal when 
multiplied by the common mode balance error H^. according to Eq. (51), these 
errors will, in general, be dominated by the errors in Eq. (A6b), which is 
multlpled by H . . 



-62- 



When the platform moves at an angular velocity Qp(t) with respect to the 
terrestrial laboratory, the misalignment and misorientation vectors are 
modulated according to 



1^1 = ^p(t) X 1 , (All)

where A stands for 6n , 6n ^ , 6n ^ and 61. Equation (A6b) becomes, upon

where g^ = -V4)g, f^ = -W(j)g and a((o) = ju ^ (u) were substituted. The terra

arising from the angular modulation of 6n ^ produces a second order effect in 
Qp(a)) and therefore has been dropped. In the case when 



|6n_| > |6n . + 6Jl| x —^ , (A13)

the second term in Eq. (A12) can be ignored. The third term becomes

Comparing Eq. (A12) with Eq. (AlO), one finds that the time-varying tilt noise

even when 6^p = U , the worst case for the centrifugal acceleration error. 
In Paper II, we will see that the angular motion noise given by Eq. (12) Is 
Indeed the dominant error mechanism for our prototype superconducting gravity 
gradlometer. 

The foregoing discussion clearly reveals the advantage of operating a 
sensitive gradlometer In space where the gradlometer platform is freely 
falling. If an Earth-polntlng reference frame is chosen so that Q (t) coin- 
cides with the orbital angular velocity of the satellite, then Eqs. (A8) and 
(A6b) reduce respectively to

where T (r) is the gravity gradient tensor of (spherical) Earth. Comparison 
of Eqs. (A15) and (A16) leads to a conclusion that the centrifugal accelera- 
tion error could be dominant in most practical cases. 

One can see from Eq. (A8) that 6g (t) has a minimum when the gradio- 

d,C 
meter is in an Inertial orientation; i.e., Q =0. The worst situation for 

the centrifugal acceleration error is the case when the gradlometer is rotated 

at a frequency high compared to the signal frequency for heterodyne detection 

of the gravity signal. In this case, Q is the spin angular velocity which is 

large compared to Q . One advantage of the superconducting gravity gradio- 



-64- 



meter is that the heterodyne detection is not necessary , unlike in some con- 
ventional devices, because of its low drift and excellent low frequency noise 
characteristics. The superconducting gradiometer therefore permits complete 
freedom in orientation: inertial, earth-pointing, or spin-stabilized [26], 
Hence, an optimum orientation, which minimizes the overall error budget, is 
available to the superconducting instrument although the angular motion in- 
duced errors are fundamental. 

In Eqs. (AlO) and (A15), we considered only the first order errors in 
5^p(a)). This is justified when 6^ (w) is bandwidth limited. The Fourier 
transform of [6Q (t)] down-converts the centrifugal acceleration noise from ' 
high frequencies to the vicinity of dc, the signal bandwidth. A low-pass 
filter for angular vibrations of the platform is therefore needed to suppress 
this error. 

K. Scale Factor Errors 

There are two types of scale factor errors in a gradiometer: (1) a rela- 
tive error, which comes from the mismatch of the scale factors of the com- 
ponent accelerometers, and (2) an absolute error, which is the error in the 
calibration of the gradiometer transfer function. Since the scale factors are 
determined by persistent currents in the superconducting gradiometer, extreme 
stability is expected in the scale factor match and calibration. The passive. 
Iterative, common mode balance procedure described in Section HID allows in 
principle an arbitrarily precise match of scale factors in one direction inde- 
pendent of signal frequency. In practice, however, H . (w) is not precisely 

zero in Eq. (101), thus producing a common mode rejection error, and H .(w) 

gi 

also contains a calibration error 6H .((o). 

gi 

Let us define the (dimensionless) coefficients for scale factor mismatch

and gradiometer calibration error by

6a<5(u) = -^ , (A17a) 

6Hf.(a)) .- 

6ar((o) = -^ ^ , (A17b) 

■ nl^M 

and for the centrifugal acceleration calibration error by 60^(03), which is 
usually different from 5op((jj) because independent instruments, such as gyro- 
scopes, are used to measure and compensate the effect. The error arising from 
the use of an inaccurate value of A in the recovery of I'nn^'^'''^ from g^gCt) in 
Eq. (105b) is represented by the second term in Eq. (A17b). With the aid of 
Eqs. (105), the equivalent differential acceleration errors due to scale 
factor mismatch and calibration errors can be written as 

6gjj g(a)) = 6ag((jj) n • [g(r,a)) - a(r,to)] , (A18) 

6gjj c(a)) = Jl n • [6a|,(<j) f(r,u) - ba^i^) C(a)) ] • n . (A19) 

The platform motion terms usually dominate over the ac gravity terms in these 
equations. The second term in Eq. (A19) constitutes an additional rotation 
Induced error which must be added to the list considered In the previous 
section. The linear acceleration terra in Eq. (A18) will be discussed in the 
following section along with other translation induced error sources. 

Now, we briefly discuss 6ag((jj) which arises from the failure to apply the 
wideband balance procedure. If the balance is attempted at a single frequency 
w^j, Eq. (48) must be violated in general. Substituting Eqs. (46) into Eq. 
(A17a) and expanding it in a Taylor series, one finds

where 5ag(u)^j) is a residual balance error at Wjj. Although not essential, a 
highly symmetric gradioraeter is convenient because ^2^ ~ Uj and, therefore, 
the wideband balance can be achieved with only two persistent currents Ii and 
I2 = I^ while keeping i^ = i2 = 0. 

F. Linear Motions of the Platform 

Although several sources of linear motion induced errors have been shown 
in the previous sections, it is instructive to combine these effects here. 
The linear velocity dependent Coriolis force terra has been dropped in Eqs. 
(95) on the assumption that the proof masses are confined to move along the 
linear directions n^ and n^. A non-vanishing residual compliance in the 
directions perpendicular to the sensitive axes would allow the proof masses to 
respond to the transverse components of accelerations, thereby contributing to 
a velocity dependent error. It is therefore important to design the 
suspension spring with high stiffness for all undesired degrees of freedom 
while obtaining a very weak spring in a linear direction. We will see in 
Paper II how this condition is met in the actual design of the superconducting 
gradioraeter. 

It has been shown in Section B of this Appendix that the modulation of 
Earth's gravity by a time-varying displacement error 6p(t) can be ignored 
because of the higher order gradients involved. The dominant raechanisms which 
convert the linear vibrations of the platform into gradioraeter errors are 

A 

therefore (1) the sensitive axes misalignment 6n_, which couples the cross 
component accelerations, and (2) the scale factor mismatch 5ag(a)), which 
couples the In-line component acceleration to the gradioraeter output. 



-67- 



Combining proper terms in Eqs. (A6b) and (A18), one finds 



+ ^> 



6g ^(u) = - [6n + 6a_(u)) n] • a(r,to) . (A21) 
d,a 

The two terras in this equation are related by the condition of the common mode 

balance. The balance is obtained in the real instrument by requiring 

6g (Uv) = for a given applied acceleration, say, in the z-directlon: 
d,a 

a(r,(o, ) = a(to, ) z , (A22) 



Substitution of Eq. (A22) Into Eq. (A21) leads to 

6n • z 

6ag((j0j,) = TT — — + Sogg, (A23) 

n • z 

which can be substituted, in turn, into Eq. (A20) to obtain 6cTg(u)). Notice 
that, even with a wideband balance, SogCu) = 6og(a)^j) * due to the 
misalignment of the sensitive axes and the residual balance error 5ogQ. The 
impossibility of obtaining a balance with an applied acceleration normal to n, 

A A 

or (n, + n2)/2 to be rigorous, is Indicated by the divergence of Eq. (A23), 

A A 

which occurs when n • z = 0. 

6. Scale Factor Nonllaearlty and Dynaalc Range 

A nonlinear behavior of accelerometer scale factors arises from departure 
of the acceleration response of the mechanical suspension springs from the 
linear behavior predicted by Hooke's Law, higher order terms In the modulation 
of the pancake coil inductances, L^ and Ljj, higher order terms in the magnetic 
force Fgj^, and, finally, nonllnearity in the current-to-voltage transfer 



-68- 



function of the SQUID electronics. In Eqs. (14), we assumed perfect linearity 
^^ ^a anu jjj^ as xuncuxcns Oi. tuS coj-j. spacing. This assuuiptiGn is clearly not 
rigorous because of the grain structure of the pancake coils and edge effects. 
The higher order terras in Fg,^, which are apparent in Eqs. (23) and (25), have 
been ignored in our attempt to linearize the circuit equations. Therefore, 
even if the mechanical springs and the SQUID electronics are constructed with 
sufficient linearity, the response of each accelerometer will be somewhat non- 
linear due to the inevitable higher order response of the electrical circuit. 

In analogy to Eqs. (A17), we define the nonlinearity error coefficients 
hj,(,((o), hjj(w) and hj,j(a)) by dividing the nonlinearity transfer functions 
Hg^(a)), H^^(a)) and H^^(co), introduced in Eq. (101), by H^.(u). Then the equi- 
valent differential acceleration error due to scale factor nonlinearity can be 
written as 

^gd,N('^> = hj,^,((o) G^j,(a)) + hjj(w) G^jj(u) + h^j(u) G^,j(a)). (A24) 

Now, in most practical situations, the gravity terms are small compared to the 
platform motion terms in Eqs. (100) so that 



G^^U) = [n • a (r,t)]^ , (A25a) 



Gdd(t) = a2 [{n . ^(t)}^ - Q2(t)]2, (A25b) 

Gj.^(t) = i [n't (r,t)]f{n • ^(t)}^ - Q2(t)]. (A25c) 

It is clear that the Fourier transformation of these nonlinear functions of 
dynamic variables will down-convert the wideband platform noise to the 



-69- 



vicinity of dc, where the gravity gradient signal is to be detected. There- 
fore, It is imperative that the vibration and jitter noise of the apparatus be 
low-pass filtered before they reach the gradlometer. Detailed analysis of the 
nooise down-conversion process will be given in Paper II. 

It is difficult to determine the nonlinearity error coefficients analyti- 
cally. They can however be measured from the departures of the transfer 

functions h'^^ (w) and H .(u) from the linear behavior. In principle, the non- 
gi gi 

linearity in the two component acceleroraeters could also be matched. This 
would not, however, reduce all three error coefficients in Eq. (A24) to zero. 
A more powerful and practical approach to the problem is the linearization of 
the system by means of an electromechanical feedback. A feedback force, which 
is equal and opposite to the detected external force, can be applied to each 
proof mass so that the total force, the "error signal" for the feedback loop, 
is reduced by the inverse of the feedback gain. The reduction of the driving 
accelerations limits the actual displacement of each proof mass to a small 
amplitude, thereby reducing fig^ ^(to). The error coefficients h(a))'8 have 
therefore been effectively reduced. The average and differential feedback 
forces are direct measures of g(,(t) and gjCt). The gradlometer thus measures 
the specific force Instead of the resulting displacement. The negative feed- 
back comes with another important advantage : increase in the dynamic range of 
the device. This so-called "force rebalance" feedback has been successfully 
applied to conventional inertlal navigation Instruments [27] and gravity 
gradiometers [7], although it is yet to be applied to superconducting gravity 
gradiometers. 

One of the parameters responsible for the high sensitivity of the super- 
conducting gradlometer is the low damping coefficient of the electromechanical 
springs. The low dissipation is necessarily accompanied with high Q 



-70- 



resonances of the modes which tend to amplify the acceleration noise at the 
resonance frequencies. An elegant way Lo take care of this problem is an 
active damping method [28] by which the Q's are effectively lowered without 
increasing the Brownian motion noise level. The gradiometer response is 
narrowband filtered around the resonances, phase shifted by 90°, and fed back 
to the proof masses to actively drive down the resonant motions. This "cold 
damping" has been successfully demonstrated in superconducting gravity gradio- 
meters [13, 14]. 

H. Nomechanlcal Noise of the Envlronneat 

It has been pointed out in the Introduction that superconductivity can be 
used to make a nearly perfect electromagnetic shield. In a practical super- 
conducting shield with irapurifies, the Meissner effect does not exclude the 
magnetic field completely, but instead "freezes" some trapped magnetic field, 
thus providing a "perfect" shield against time-varying fields. One can 
combine high permeability shields with superconducting shields to attenuate 
both dc and ac electromagnetic fields as well as radiation very effectively. 
Therefore, the electromagnetic susceptibility of the superconducting 
gradiometer can be made negligible. 

The thermal fluctuations of the environment could also be shielded by 
immersing the apparatus in superfluid helium, the Bose condensate phase of He^ 
below 2.17 K. The infinite heat conductivity and the large heat capacity of 
the superfluid provides a stable, gradient free, thermal environment. Even 
normal fluid helium can provide an excellent thermal environment provided its 
vapor pressure is regulated. When the attenuation of the temperature fluctua- 
tions of the environment is not sufficient, one will have error terms that 
couple the temperature noise to the gradiometer output, as shown in Eq. (101). 



-71- 



The fluctuation in the gradlometer temperature can cause error signals through 
its interaction with (1) the mechanical part and (2) the superconducting 

circuit. 

In analogy to Eqs. (40), the temperature modulations of the two accelero- 
raeters, Ti(a)) and T2(u), are expressed in terms of their common and 
differential temperatures , Tj.(u) and Tj(u) : 

TiCu) = T^(a)) - J Td(u), (A26a) 

T2(u)) = 1^(0)) + J TjCu). (A26b) 

The mechanically coupled temperature-induced error could arise simply from the 
thermal expansion of the baseline: 



Mii)_.a(T) T^(co), (A27) 



where a(T) is the thermal expansion coefficient of the gradlometer body at the 
ambient temperature T. However, a(T) is extremely small for solids at liquid 
helium temperatures so that the dimensional change 5A(u) is negligible in any 

A 

practical situation [14], For the same reason, alignment changes 6n_j_(a3) 
resulting from temperature fluctuations are negligible, demonstrating the 
mechanical stability of the cryogenic gravity gradlometer. 

There is a more subtle coupling mechanism of the temperature noise 
through the mechanical part of the system. It is through the temperature 
dependence of Young's modulus E(T) of the mechanical spring [29]. Since the 
stiffness of the suspension spring changes as a function of temperature, a 
temperature fluctuation will cause a displacement modulation when the spring 



-72- 



is under stress either by gravity or by an unbalanced magnetic pressure. This 

can be seen iii Eq. (25) for an acceleroiueter. mien n = g-,(~) "r so that x^ ^ 

^— — — — — t, o 

2 
0, the temperature induced modulation of oj^ produces a first order effect in 

displacement. It is convenient to move this terra to the rlghthand side of Eq. 

(25) and define an additional effective driving acceleration: 



6g^(t) = - [o)^(T + 6T) - w^(T)] Xq. (A28) 



2 
The proportionality of the spring constant rau„ to E(T) can be used to rewrite 

n 

Eq. (A28) as 



6gT(t) = - a)^(T) Xq gi^ g 6T(t). (A29) 



Substitution of Eq. (27) into Eq. (A29) and Fourier transformation leads to 

gT(a,) o [g^ eos e„ + i (I + i ^5_A i) i] _1_^ dE ^^^^ ^ (^3^^ 

a b 

It is clear from this equation that this effect can be eliminated by choosing 
1 such that the quantity in the square bracket vanishes; i.e., by compensating 
the gravitational force with a magnetic levltation force. 

In the actual operation of the gradiometer reported in Paper II, i s 
was chosen so that the magnetic pressure term in Eq. (A30) was negligible. 
The temperature effect on the gradiometer can be found then by adding 



T 1 t^V 

Sc^"^ " 8e cos e^ £^ ^ Tj,(a)) , (A3 la) 



gj(a)) = gE cos ©n E(TT H "^d^") (A31b) 



-73- 



to gj,(u) and g^jCco) in Eq. (41). It is assumed here that the two suspension 
springs of the proof masses have an identical Young's modulus E(T). The 
temperature-induced current output can be written as 



where 



ij(a)) = H^^(a)) T^(cj) + H^^Cu) T^Cu), (A32) 



H^^(w) = H^^(a)) gE cos 9^ ^^ ^ , (A33a) 



H^^(a)) = Hg^(a)) gg cos 9„ ^^ ^ . (A33b) 



Notice that the common temperature fluctuation T^(o)) is balanced out to the 
same degree as the common acceleration . For a properly balanced gradiometer, 
therefore, this effect is expected to be negligible as long as i = 0. 

The second effect of the temperature noise, which acts on the supercon- 
ducting circuit directly, comes from the temperature dependence of the 
"penetration depth" \(T) of the magnetic field in the superconductor: 



'^^T) ^^°^ . wo . (A34) 

[1 - (T/T^rV'^ 

where T^ is the critical temperature for the superconductor. For niobium, 
\(0) = 5.0 X 10"^ m and T^ = 9.2 K. The variation of \(\) of the proof mass 
and pancake coils due to a temperature fluctuation 6Tj^(t) of the k-th 
acceleration transducer, 



6\(T^) = \(T^ + 6T^) - \(Ti^) - II 5Ti^, (A35)

modulates the superconducting inductances of Eq. (14) according to

^eb(t) = I^b "^ ^(1 + '^'^ ^^^\'> - ^ \(t) . (A36b) 



< C < 1 (A37) 



is the modulation efficiency of the penetration depth of the pancake coils. 
Approximation is made here that the sensing inductances are reasonably well 
matched so that distinction of C for each of these coils is not necessary. In 
Eqs. (A36), ^(t) is the dynamic displacement produced in self-consistent 
response to the current modulations resulting from the temperature-induced 

inductance modulations. Given the penetration depth modulations, the dis- 

T T 

placement response x, (t) and the current response lj(t) are solved from the 

dynamical equations of the gradiometer. The dynamical equations and their 

solutions are modifications of those given in Section III. 

Modifying Eqs. (18) and (19), the series and parallel inductances of the 

sensing coils Lj^^ and l^^ now becomes

H^^Cw) = H^^((o) h,j,d(w), (A46b) 



where the temperature error coefficients are obtained from Eqs, (A26), (A35) 
and (A44) as 



h,j.j,(a)) = [0^2(^2^ - 0) ) - WjCw^^ - 0) )](1 ■•■ '^) dT ♦ (A47a) 



h^j((A)) = J f°'2^"2\ ~ ^ ^ * "l^'^ix - <^ )Kl + C) jY . (A47b) 



In terms of these error coefficients, the equivalent differential acceleration 
error due to temperature sensitivity is 



^Sd^ji^) = hj^i(M) Tg(a)) + h^d Tj(w). (A48) 



It is apparent from Eqs, (A42) and (A47a) that the effect of T^(u) is 



-77- 



partially balanced by the match between pancake coil Inductances, I^^ and I^u, 
and by the common acceleration balance condition (48). On the other hand, 
Tj(a)) is usually negligible because the good thermal conductivity of the 
gradiometer body keeps the entire instrument in thermal equilibrium. 

It has been pointed out [18] that an exact common temperature balance 
could be achieved by adjusting the fourth persistent current ±2 with respect 
to Ij^, I2 and ij that are used for the wideband common acceleration balance. 
The adjustments are iterated such that both the common acceleration balance 
condition (48) and the common temperature balance condition, 

T 2 2 T 2 2 
"2^"2\ ~ '^ ^ " "l^'^'lX "<**)» (A49) 

are simultaneous satisfied. In practice, it will be easier to couple a 
separate superconducting loop, which senses only temperature, to the SQUID and 
adjust the persistent current in this loop to obtain the temperature 
balance. The advantage of the latter scheme is that the temperature and 
acceleration balances can be performed independently. 

A slowly varying temperature of the environment, if uncompensated, can be 
an important source of a dc drift of the gradiometer. Such a drift, however, 
does not produce a random walk of the output, but the error is bounded because 
the dc level of the output is locked to the temperature of the gradiometer 
which is self-regulated to a large extent by the liquid helium itself.

A sensitive superconducting gravity gradiometer has been constructed and 
tested. Coupling to gravity signals is obtaiaed by having two superconducting 
proof masses modulate magnetic fields produced by persistent currents. The 
induced electrical currents are differenced by a passive superconducting 
circuit coupled to a SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device). The 
experimental behavior of this device has been shown to follow the theoretical 
model closely in both signal transfer and noise characteristics. While its 
intrinsic noise level is shown to be 0.07 E Hz~^/^ (1 E E 10"^ s~^), the 
actual performance of the gravity gradiometer on a passive platform has been 
limited to 0.3 ~ 0.7 E Hz"^'^ j^g ^^ ^^.^ coupling to the environmental noise. 
The detailed structure of this excess noise is understood in terms of an 
analytical error model of the instrument. The calibration of the gradiometer 
has been obtained by two independent methods : by applying a linear accelera- 
tion and a gravity signal in two different operational modes of the instru- 
ment. This device has been successfully operated as a detector in a new null 
experiment for the gravitational inverse square law. In this paper, we report 
the design, fabrication and detailed test results of the superconducting 
gravity gradiometer. We also present additional theoretical analyses which 
predict the specific dynamical behavior of the gradiometer and of the test 
platform, and compare the results with experiments.

I. INTRODUCTION 

The Equivalence Principle prohibits distinction of "gravity" from 
"acceleration" by a local measurement. The same principle, however, implies 
that a sensitive accelerometer , or a gravimeter , can be used as an approximate 
detector of gravity in an environment where the platform accelerations are 
small. Thus, gravimeters, which measure absolute and relative magnitudes of 
the gravitational acceleration vector, usually from a stationary platform, 
have been employed as geophysical survey instruments [1]. This method of 
measuring gravity can be extended to a moving platform by independently 
determining and compensating for the platform accelerations with the aid of a 
geodetic navigation device such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) 
satellite network [2]. The latter measurement is clearly of a global nature. 

An alternative, more direct, approach to a rigorous determination of the 
gravitational field is by means of a gravity gradiometer , which measures com- 
ponents of the tidal force or the Riemann tensor [3]. Here an almost local 
measurement is made by monitoring relative motions of proof masses separated 
by a short, but finite, baseline. With the torsion balance as the predeces- 
sor, several advanced types of gravity gradiometers have been developed 
recently [4] . 

The superconducting gravity gradiometer, to be discussed in this paper, 
has been developed with the primary motivation being to perfoirm precise tests 
of gravitational theories in both terrestrial and space laboratories. A pre- 
liminary version of a null test of the gravitational Inverse square law has 
been carried out with this instrument [5]. While the instrument has served as 
a prototype for a three-axis superconducting gravity gradiometer [6] which is 
under construction, the system has undergone a thorough theoretical and ex- 
perimental analysis to test the physics of the instrument. The results could 



-84- 



easily be adapted to a more complicated device. 

In Paper I, a detailed theoretical analysis of the current-differencing 
gravity gradtometer was presented. This paper (Paper II) discusses the 
design, construction and test results of the actual instrument. These test 
results demonstrate that the physical device Is described by the theoretical 
model in great detail. In addition, we discuss here the principle and 
operation of two elegant experimental techniques, which have been applied to 
the superconducting gravity gradioraeter: (1) accelerometer mode calibration 
and (2) vibration isolation by means of pendulum action. Also, the error 
model of the instrument developed in Paper I is extended and applied here to 
the specific instrument configuration chosen. Paper II represents an 
extension of the experimental work reported in Ref. 7. 

The gravity gradient signal sought for is usually a small fluctuation 
over a relatively large background of the Earth's gravity and the seismic 
activity of the platform. Therefore, precise mechanical alignment of com- 
ponents and extreme stability of scale factors, as well as high sensitivity, 
are required for a practical gravity gradioraeter. Advantages of a super- 
conducting Instrument in these regards have been pointed out in Paper I. In 
this paper, we show how quantum-mechanical properties of superconductors are 
utilized specifically., along with careful mechanical design, to meet the 
challenge of constructing a highly sensitive gravity gradioraeter. 

Notations employed in Paper II follow those of Paper I, unless explicitly 
stated otherwise.

II. DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF THE SUPERCONDUCTING GRAVITY GRADIOHETER. 

A. Gradloaeter Hardware 

The gradiometer consists of two accelerometers, each with a proof mass, a 
suspension structure, and sensing coils. The suspension structure consists of 
mechanical springs which confine the proof mass motion along the desired 
direction. 

A folded cantilever suspension has been employed to produce a suspension 
with a linear spring constant which is weak, in the direction of motion, yet 
relatively rigid for other degrees of freedom. This type of suspension was 
suggested by Prof. Daniel DeBra at Stanford University and has been employed 
in the displacement-differencing gravity gradiometer [8]. The design contains 
eight folded cantilevers in an 8m symmetry (to be defined later) to suspend 
the proof mass at the center (Fig. 1). Each cantilever consists of three 
joined diaphragm strips, of length X^ and thickness tg, formed at the bottom 
of one radially oriented groove. The "fold" of the cantilever is at the 
radially outward ends of the strips. The radially Inward ends of the strip 
are the ends of the spring. The middle strip of width bg holds the center 
moving mass. The other two strips of width y bg link to a bulk mass which is 
a solid continuation of the outer rim of the suspension. This design allows 
the cantilevers to undergo pure bending without stretching in order to achieve 
linearity in the spring constant. There are four folded cantilevers on each 
of two parallel planes with 2Tt/8 rotation plus inversion symmetry (8m 
symmetry). Thus, motion of the center mass is linearized along the 
cylindrical axis. 

The entire suspension structure is machined out of a single piece of 
niobium (Nb) in order to insure mechanical precision and to obtain a high

quality factor of resonance. Eight grooves, four from each side, are first 
milled out, leaving a thick, diaphragm at their opposite sides. The metal is 
then stress-relieved at SOCC. The grooves are then electric-discharge- 
machined (EDM) to thicknesses of (0.35 ± 0.01) mm. Next, the suspension 
structure is chemically polished with a mixture of hydrofluoric acid (HP), 
phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and nitric acid (HNO3) in an ultrasonic cleaner. 
After the polishing, the Nb is partially recrystalized by annealing in a 
vacuum oven at llOO'C. The designed pattern of slots is then cut with a wire 
EDM. Finally, the finished proof mass suspension structure is chemically 
polished again. 

The center moving mass of the suspension is loaded with two mushroom- 
shaped Nb masses which screw into opposite ends to form one proof mass. This 
added load serves to increase the mass mj^, lower the suspension frequency f\^f^, 
and provide two superconducting planes which modulate the Inductances of the 
sensing coils. The mechanical suspension frequency of the proof mass is de- 
rived from the formula for a loaded beam and is given by

Here Eg = 1.03x10^^ N m~^ Is the Young's modulus of Nb and ng = 8 is the 
number of springs used. Also, tg = 0.35 mm, l^ - 19 mm, bg = 2.5 mm, and mj^ = 
0.40 kg, giving f^^ = 20 Hz. 

The sensing inductors are "pancake-shaped" coils wound out of thin (0,076 
mm in diameter) Nb wire in a single layer. The coil form is made of machin- 
able glass -ceramic, Macor (Corning Glass Works, Corning, New York), whose 
thermal expansion coefficient matches closely with that of Nb down to cryo- 
genic temperatures. A continuous length of Insulated Nb wire Is wound unl- 



-88- 



forraly on the flat coil form in a spiral shape. Low viscosity, transparent, 
TRA-CAST EB3002 epcxy (TRA-COM, Inc=, Medford^ Mflssaphnsfitts) Is used to bond 
the Nb wire. The coil winding procedure used here is a modification of that 
described in Ref, 9. 

Two such pancake coils are located next to the two plane surfaces of the 
proof mass ia each accelerometer. To a high accuracy, the inductance for each 
pancake coil. 



L(t) = \Xq n^ Al [d + x(t)] , (2) 



changes linearly according to its average spacing from the superconducting 
ground plane, and is Insensitive to any rocking or transverse modes of the 
proof mass. The coil forms are mounted rigidly on Nb holders using Nb screws 
and GE 7031 varnish. The two Nb holders are mounted rigidly to the outer rim 
of the proof mass suspension using titanium (Ti) screws to form a shielded 
accelerometer. Ti is closely matched in thermal expansion coefficient with 
Nb. The spacing between the coil and the proof mass is adjusted by adding Nb 
spacers cut out of Nb sheet. Parallelism between the coil and proof mass 
surface is desirable to allow the use of a small spacing between them. 

Two accelerometers are mounted on the opposite faces of a precision Ti 
(Ti V4 AJ16 alloy) cube to form a single-axis gradiometer (see Fig. 2). The 
surfaces of the cube have parallelism and orthogonality within 50 ppm. The 
same degree of parallelism is kept for the mating surfaces of all the gradio- 
meter parts. The Ti material at the center cube is continued down to an 
alurainum-to-titanium joint. An aluminum (Al) base is tight fitted onto the Ti 
at room temperature. Differential contraction tightens the joint further as 
the assembly is cooled down. A similar joint is made at the upper end. The

umbrella orientation. 



-90- 



baseline of the gradioraeter, which is defined by the distance between the 
centers of mass for the two proof masses, is X — 0.16 tt.. 

For most of the tests reported in this paper, one triagonal axis of the 
mounting cube is aligned with the vertical, as is shown in Fig. 2, so that the 
sensitive axis of the gradiometer is tilted by an angle 



e^ = tan~l /2 (3) 



from the vertical. This "umbrella orientation" has the advantage of allowing 
measurements in three orthogonal directions to be made by rotating the gradio- 
meter around the vertical axis by 120° increments. The fact that the large dc 
gravity bias is matched along the sensitive axes is an important scientific 
reason to prefer this orientation when a careful three-axis measurement is 
called for. The above procedure has therefore been used for the null test of 
the gravitational inverse square law [5], which will be discussed in Section 
VI. 

B. Superconductlog Circuitry 

The superconducting circuit for the gradiometer is shown in Fig 3. Lj^, 
LjIj, and L2g, l^y^ are pancake coil inductors for the two proof masses, raj^ and 
m2, respectively. S^^, Sj^^, 82^, 82^, and Sj are current leads from the 
current supply outside the cryostat. Hj^, Hj§, H2, and H25 are shielded heat- 
switch resistors. When currents are sent through these resistors, appropriate 
sections of the superconducting path are switched into their normal state. 
Rjg and R25 represent extremely low resistance current paths (3xl0~ Q). L^^ 
is the input inductor of the SQUID amplifier. Lj and Ljj are, respectively, 
the primary and secondary of a high coupling transformer.

The current Ij can be stored in Lj^^ + L^^ by turning H^ on and then off 
while the current is sent across S^^ and S^^. The Inductance L^^ + Ljv can be 
determined by measuring the flux trapped in it after a known current has been 
stored. The flux is measured by the time integral of the voltage decay across 
the leads S^^ and S^^ as Hj^ is turned on. This method has been described in 
Ref. 9. There is also a heat-switch, Hg, between Ljj and Lj^ that will be 
turned on in all operations involving current changes. This heat-switch 
serves to protect the Josephson junction of the SQUID ring against any surge 
current induced in the input coil I^ . The currents I^ and I2 in the two 
sensing loops can be fine tuned by letting the stored flux leak very slowly 
across an ultra low resistance path after a section of the superconducting 
path has been turned normal. If the heat-switch ^2^ is turned on, the current 
I2 in L2g + L2|j will decay across R25 with a decay time t = (l'2a "*" ^b^^^26 ~ 
3 x 10 s, which is extremely long. This current will rise or decay even more 
slowly if a second current, slightly greater or smaller than I2, is being sent 
across the leads S23 and 82^, while H25 is kept on. An additional current ii 
can be added in the loop formed by a parallel combination Ln-Z/LiK and Lj (see 
Fig. 3 of Paper I) by turning both Hj^g and H25 on and then off while a current 
is sent across Sj and either S^^ or Sj^j,. The decay of 1^ and I2 during the 
time required to store i^ is negligible because of the long decay time x. The 
directions of these persistent currents are as defined in Fig. 3 of Paper I. 

The superconducting circuit is shielded inside Nb. The outer surfaces of 
the Nb holders for sensing coils are shielded with additional Nb covers to 
form junction boxes. Circuit components such as superconducting joints, a 
superconducting transformer, shielded heat-switches and ultra low-value 
resistors are mounted in these junction boxes. 

The superconducting joints and transformers are similar to those used in 



-93- 



References 9 and 10. A pair of Nb lead wires to be joined are twisted 
together, wrapped around a brass screw, sandwiched between two Nb sheets, and 
clamped together under a brass washer. They are clamped hard by tightening 
the brass screw into a piece of insulated brass block. The Nb wires are 
chemically cleaned with concentrated HNOo before they are joined. Flatness 
and parallelism of the brass block surface relative to the screw head surface 
is found helpful for making very tight joints without breaking the thin Nb 
wires. A fresh section of the lead wire is used to make the joint. Joints 
made this way consistently have critical currents in excess of 3 A through 
several thermal cycles [11]. The transformer makes use of a Nb sheet to guide 
the magnetic field through the primary and secondary coils. 

Shielded heat-switches are made with a small cylindrical Nb cup which 
shields the superconducting circuit from the noise of the heater resistor. 
The heater element is a small 500 Q Allen-Bradley resistor which is glued with 
GE 7031 varnish inside the Nb cup. Shielding from the resistor is continued 
with superconducting lead-tin (PbSn) tubing which starts from inside the Nb 
cup to enclose the lead wires of the heater. The sections of Nb wire to be 
affected by the heat-switch are wound non-inductively on the outside surface 
of the Nb cup and are glued with the GE varnish. The cup is then glued on a 
piece of fiberglass which is held rigidly Inside the junction box. The Nb 
wires from the heat-switches are heat-sunk to the Nb mass of the junction box. 

The shielding of the heat-switches provides significant Improvement in 
preventing electrical pickup and rf Interference at the input of the SQUID 
amplifier. The shielding has a drawback, though, in possessing a higher heat 
capacity which prolongs the response time of the heat-switch. By making the 
heat-switch compact, we managed to obtain an on/off response time of about 0.2 
s with 4 mW supplied to the heater. 



-94- 



The ultra low-resistance heat-switch makes use of the radial conduction 
across a very thin cylindrical wail of copper. we simply solder Lwo lengths 
of copper-clad Nb wires together with PbSn solder. The copper coating gives 
extremely low resistance between the superconducting PbSn on its outside wall 
and the Nb wire inside. The resistance between the two Nb wires comes from 
two such resistors connected in series. This resistance is given by the 
formula : 



Cu Nb 



We used Nb wire of diameter 2rjj^j = 0.128 mm with copper coating which gives an 

overall diameter of Zr^^ = 0.166 mm. The resistivity of copper at 4.2 K is 

-9 
pQj 5 10 Q m. Therefore, when a wire of length Aq^ = 10 mm is used, we 

—8 
obtain R^ = 10 Q. This resistance has been verified in a decay time 

measurement of magnetic flux. The other two ends of the copper-clad Nb wires 
have their copper layer removed with concentrated HNO3 so that superconducting 
joints can be made there. In the rest of the superconducting circuit, Nb 
wires without copper coating are used to avoid ac losses due to eddy currents 
[9]. 

In the original circuit used for tests, an additional SQUID was coupled 
to the superconducting circuit to measure the common acceleration simul- 
taneously. Two identical superconducting transfonners were inserted into the 
paths that connect the two sensing loops to Lj (A and B in Fig. 3), with one 
on each accelerometer side. The primaries of these transformers completed the 
gradioraeter circuit. Their secondaries were connected in series with the in- 
put coil of the second SQUID. The current induced in this loop was propor- 
tional to the sura of the signal currents from the two accelerometers, per- 



-95- 



mittlng a simultaneous readout of the common acceleration In the "gradlometer 
mode". Although such a readout is useful for error compensation and active 
vibration isolation [12], we have omitted, for simplicity, this additional 
circuit In the later tests in favor of the basic circuit shown in Fig. 3.

III. CGNSTRUCTIGN AND PERFORMANCE GF TEST APPARATUS 

A. Mechanical and Thermal Design of Experlnental Space 

The superconducting gravity gradlometer is operated in a very quiet cryo- 
genic vacuum space with a stable temperature. A low boil-off liquid helium 
(He) dewar was designed and constructed with great care. Radiation shields 
with superinsulation are used in preference to a liquid nitrogen (N2) shield, 
because boiling liquid N2 is a much noisier source of vibration than boiling 
liquid He. Pressure pads are sandwiched near the bottom of the dewar between 
the fiberglass inner tube and the sturdy outer Al wall. The relatively weak 
inner tube is then damped against swinging motions. The inside dimensions of 
the dewar are 0.378 ra in diameter and 1.778 m in height. 

A low heat-leak insert has been constructed to complement the dewar. An 
Al vacuum can is supported by three equally spaced fiberglass tubes and one 
center fiberglass tube which permits access to the vacuum space from the dewar 
top. The vacuum space is 0.33 m in diameter by 0.61 m in height. The can 
remains totally submerged for one week with 60 liters of liquid He. A long 
hold-time of He is needed for an uninterrupted operation of sensitive 
measurements. The low boil-off rate is also important for lower boiling noise 
from the He and for lower thermal drift of the experiment. 

For most of the experiment, the gradlometer assembly was suspended inside 
vacuum by means of a fiberglass rod from the room temperature end of the dewar 
insert. All the lead wires are heat-sunk in liquid He before they enter the 
vacuum space through specially made feedthroughs. In this setup, long terra 
temperature variations of the gradlometer assembly over many weeks average 
about 10 mK. In a time scale of several hours, the temperature variations are 
within the 2 mK resolution of a germanium (Ge) resistance thermometer mounted 



-97- 



on the gradiometer. The heat capacity of the gradioraeter and the weak thermal 
coupling to the He bath form a low-pass filter for the temperature fluctua- 
tions between the gradiometer and the He bath. The response time is estimated 
to be on the order of minutes. 

B. Electromagnetic Shielding 

External magnetic field fluctuations and electrical pickup can produce a 
high noise level in comparison with the very weak gravitational force. Rf 
interference will also deteriorate the noise performance of the rf SQUID and 
can unlock the SQUID feedback loop. The first stage of magnetic field isola- 
tion is provided by a double wall mu-metal shield which surrounds the cryo- 
stat. Two additional superconducting stages of magnetic shielding are pro- 
vided by a 1 [im lead (Pb) film evaporated on the inner wall of the vacuum can, 
and by the Nb body of the gradiometer itself. Also, the Al walls of the dewar 
and the vacuum can aid in shielding high frequency electromagnetic radiation. 

The success of the electromagnetic shielding is evidenced by the achieve- 
ment of the optimum SQUID amplifier noise when the SQUID input is coupled to 
the gradiometer at full sensitivity. The magnetic shielding has also been 
tested when the gradiometer is balanced. A magnet producting 600 Gauss being 
flipped just outside the dewar produced a response less than an equivalent 
flux change of 2x10"^ ^^ or 4x10"^^ Wb at the SQUID input. 

Each current lead for storing a supercurrent has an inductive choke 
inside the vacuum can. The choke is a high-impedance path to attenuate the 
electrical noise that the wire can pick up outside the Pb shield and 
especially outside the dewar. The other leads pass through two stages of rf 
filters, one inside the Pb shield and the other outside it. The outside one 
Is an RC low-pass filter with the manganin wire down the dewar providing the 



-98- 



resistance and the Inside one is a capacitor In parallel with the load. 

C. Vibration Isolation 

Vibration proved to be the most troublesome source of noise. The test of 
the gradioraeter has therefore been conducted in a deep underground laboratory, 
which is secluded from the traffic of people. The most critical noise data 
have been obtained in the evenings to minimize the mechanical and electrical 
disturbance of the experiment. In spite of these precautions, the gradioraeter 
required careful mechanical isolation from the environment. 

The vibration isolation system consists of a three stage low-pass filter 
schematically shown in Fig. 4. The gradioraeter assembly is suspended by a 
fiberglass rod and a length of latex rubber tubing in vacuum which form the 
first stage of vibration isolation. Tlie vacuum is extended above the top of 
the dewar insert by means of a thick-wall plexiglass tube. The rubber tubing 
inside this plexiglass tube hangs from a connecting rod which is attached to a 
massive brass plate that seals with the plexiglass at the top. The height of 
the connecting rod can be adjusted from outside the vacuum so that the gradio- 
raeter can be lowered to the bottom of the vacuum can to short out the filter. 
When the gradioraeter is suspended by the rubber tubing, the vertical resonance 
frequency is 0.9 Hz. 

The fiberglass and rubber also give wideband isolation f rora tilt noise . 
The gradioraeter suspended by a long fiberglass rod constitutes a pendulum. A 
natural property of a pendulum is its tendency to align itself along the 
direction of gravity. The gradioraeter is therefore decoupled from a crucial 
error source : the ground tilt . which would cause an error signal due to 
modulation of Earth's gravity for a hard-mounted gradioraeter. 

Another Important property of the pendulum is that the mass at the end of

the rod is under a two-dimensional "free fall" in the horizontal plane. An 
aceci-eroiucter ruOuuteu on the pendulum bob therefore cannot experience any 
horizontal acceleration relative to the platform to the first order. A 
gravity gradioraeter can, however, couple to the angular velocity and the 
angular acceleration which result from the pendulum response to the horizontal 
acceleration (see Section V and Appendix A for detailed discussions of the 
pendulum action). The net effect of the pendulum action for the horizontal 
vibration is that of a low-frequency filter, in series with a wideband 
attenuator. 

Additional resonant modes of the suspension structure can deteriorate 
vibration Isolation at the resonance peaks. In spite of these limitations, we 
have chosen the pendulum suspension for the gradiometer because of its isola- 
tion characteristic for low frequency horizontal acceleration and its simpli- 
city in construction. The pendulum frequency (swinging mode) is approximately 
0.3 Hz and the rubber tubing gives a torsional mode at 0.08 Hz. In addition, 
the massive gradioraeter suspended by the long and therefore bendable fiber- 
glass rod gave a troublesome high-Q peak at 2.5 Hz. This peak was the result 
of a rocking mode of the gradiometer assembly around a horizontal axis. 

The massive brass top of the plexiglass column is suspended with a set of 
rubber tubings. The bottom of the plexiglass column is connected to the top 
of the dewar insert by a flexible vacuum bellows. The rubber tubing and this 
bellows form the second stage of the filter with a vertical resonance fre- 
quency of 2.8 Hz. This filter can be shorted out by connecting clamps across 
the bellows. 

The third stage of the filter is formed by three sets of rubber tubings 
that lift the dewar off the floor. The dewar is suspended from a framework by 
these rubber tubings and has a vertical resonance frequency of 0.5 Hz and a 



-101- 



swinging frequency of 0.3 Hz. The upper joints of the rubber tubings in this 
suspension are adjustable so that the dewar can be levelled. Again, this 
filter can be eliminated by lowering the dewar to the cart. 

The advantages of using latex tubing as a passive filter are its high 
elasticity and low Q. A latex tubing of initial length H^ can be extended to 
a final length Jl^ which is a few times A^. The cross-sectional area will 
decrease from Aj^ to A^ = k^H^/lf) in order to keep the volume constant. We 
assume that the modulus of elasticity is approximately constant even with such 
large extension. One can easily show then that the vertical resonance 
frequency is 

f = J.f_ii_ll/2 f^ll/2 (5) 

where Af is the new length determined by gravity gg acting on the load. The 
factor (Aj^/Af)^/2 corrects for a change in the cross-sectional area as the 
rubber elongates. By having large extension Af - A^, a low resonance fre- 
quency is obtained. The low Q provides self damping of the own resonance of 
the filter. Our latex tubing suspending the gradiometer in vacuum has Q = 10. 

The disadvantages of rubber are in relaxation and drift which worsen as 
the latex extends. A compromise is to keep A^ ^ U^. We used Af = 1.6 A^ for 
the rubber inside vacuum. Over a period of three months under load, it 
stretched by an additional 3 cm.

IV. GRADIOfETER PARAMETER MEASUREMENTS AND CIRCOIT GPTIMIZATION 

A. Detemlnatloa of Geometric Asymmetry 

The main asymmetries between the two component accelerometers in a 
gradioraeter come from the spacings of the sensing coils and mechanical spring 
constants. A high degree of matching for these parameters was not attempted 
because the mismatch can be compensated for by supercurrents. As can be shown 
from Section III of Paper I, the low frequency common mode balance condition 
in the small stored current limit with only two currents I^ and I2 reduces to 

The currents 1^ and I2 can therefore be adjusted to compensate for the 
mechanical asymmetry, and the ratio I2/I1 thus obtained measures the original 
asymmetry before it was balanced. We shall determine the ratios on both sides 
of Eq. (6) to check against the theory. This check will also indicate how 
good a "symmetric component-acceleroraeter approximation" is. Such an approxi- 
mation shall often be used later for simplicity. 

The parameters measured in a particular cool-down are summarized in Table 
1. The uncoupled mechanical frequencies of the proof masses were measured at 
4.2 K with the gradioraeter assembly firmly attached to an effectively infinite 

mass platform. This platform is simply the dewar and the ground. We have 

2 2 
measured '»'2m''"im ~ ^'^2, and the mass ratio m2/mj is estimated to be close to 

unity. Therefore, the ratio of the measured mechanical frequencies reflects 

the mismatch in the spring constants for the two proof masses. 

The experimental values of the various Inductances shown in the circuit 

diagram of Fig. 3 can be measured only when the system becomes superconduc-

B. Accelerometer Node and Gradloneter Mode 

In the gradlometer mode , the supercurrents are stored such that only 
differential accelerations at the two component acceleroraeters will produce 
signals. A common acceleration is "current-differenced" out before detection. 
If the relative polarity between the supercurrents at the two component 
accelerometers are reversed, the differential acceleration signals will then 
be current-differenced out. The gradlometer is, thus, activated in a "common 
accelerometer mode" . Being an identical electromechanical system, the 
accelerometer mode has the same characteristics toward common accelerations as 
the gradlometer mode has toward differential accelerations. 

In the experiment, the application of a pure acceleration is much easier 
than that of an acceleration gradient. Interchangeabillty of the roles 
between common and differential accelerations therefore provides us with an 
alternate method to evaluate and calibrate the gradlometer. This method is 
highly sensitive because a known acceleration can be applied with a much 
higher amplitude than a gravity gradient. 

In each mode of circuit operation , the two coupled component accelero- 
meters have two degrees of freedom and will have two normal modes of motion . 
The two proof masses move with the same phase in one mode at a frequency u^. 
and with opposite phases in the other mode at a frequency (o_. These normal 
mode frequencies and Q's can be measured experimentally and provide informa- 
tion on the gradlometer parameters. We will first show how they are related 
to the gradlometer parameters. 

The equations of motion and their constraints have been given in Eqs. 
(41) and (42) of Paper I. Strictly speaking, the normal mode frequencies u^ 
and a)_ are obtained as eigenf requencies of these equations. This can be done 
by first eliminating the current coordinates ij(w) and i^(a)). For free

where the frequency dependence of x^ and X2 have been omitted for simplicity. 
The resulting elgenf requencles are given in Ref . 10. We shall obtain approxi- 
mate solutions in simpler forms to illustrate the physics. 

The two component accelerometers In our gradloraeter are partially matched

which 1^ = l2» the frequencies are reversed:

The frequencies Wj^^ and wj^^ are effective frequencies for the 
"complementary" current (i^,) and "additive" current (ijj) modes, as is 
evidenced from their definitions in Eq. (43) of Paper I, and are theoretical 
parameters for describing the operation of the gradioraeter. The normal mode 
frequencies of motion, w^ and u_, on the other hand, are physically measurable 
quantities that provide us with approximate values of lii^^ and ^^» 

When the gradiometer assembly is suspended by a weak spring system of a 
low resonance frequency Q, the gradiometer platform has a finite mass M and 
will couple with the pair of masses. The three frequencies, Q, to^, and (jJ_, 
will all be shifted, and the equations of motion are modified. If we denote 
the platform position by X and measure the proof mass coordinates relative to 
it, the kinetic energy of the system is 



T = Y [MX^ + m^(X + xp^ + m2(X + X2)^] , (13)

and the potential energy V has an additional terra ■=- MQ X . The linearized 

equations of motion, Eq. (37) of Paper I, are then modified into

These equations are subject to the constraints given by Eq. (38) of Paper I. 

We again make the approximation of Eqs, (9) and (10), along with ij^ = ±2

This result indicates that the output impedance has been chosen sufficiently 
large. Using the value of A = 0.306 H m"^ calculated from Eq. (15) of Paper 
I, we find I^ = 23 ^H, which is consistent with inductance values in Table 
1. Also, we obtain I^ = 18 ^iH. Consistency in the measurements indicate that 
the symmetric component accelerometer approximation is sufficiently good for 
diagnostic purposes. 

The output inductance I^ is the equivalent inductance at the transformer 
primary when the secondary is loaded by the SQUID input of approximately 2 yiR.

The transformer has a turns ratio of 69:19 with calculated inductances of 42 
|iH and 3.2 ^H, respectively, to a 20 % accuracy. I^ can then be calculated 

from Eq. (75) of Paper I, and would have the above measured value of 18 |j,H if 

2 
we take the transformer coupling factor to be k = 0.93. However, the power 

transfer function of the transformer would then only be H ' = 0.51 ± 0.10, 

P 

as one can see from Eq. (76) of Paper I. The transformer has not been 
optimized in the past assembly, but this is not a problem until one reaches 
the amplifier-limited sensitivity. The resulting value of the effective 
electrical energy coupling to the SQUID is r| = 0.31. 

C. Circuit Optinlzatlon and Transfer Functions 

Equation (53) of Paper I shows that the gradloraeter transfer function, 
H . (to), of an equivalent acceleroraeter is proportional to I'/w in the low 
signal-frequency limit. In the symmetric component-accelerometer mode, u is 
identified with Wuj. 

In Fig. 6, we plot a measured curve of |l]j|/f versus \\\ to indicate 
the functional dependence of the differential-acceleration-to-response-current 
transfer function on the stored current \\\> This plot shows that the 
gradiometer sensitivity first increases as |l^| is increased from 0, and then 

slows down due to an increase in f^ caused by an increasing |\|. The gradio- 

2 2 
meter is expected to reach its maximum sensitivity when f = 2f, at | Ii^ | =2 

A. However, this maximum is very smooth so that a smaller current can be used 
without a substantial reduction in sensitivity. 

If the gradiometer sensitivity is SQUID noise limited, optimizing the 
above transfer function yields a maximum signal-to-nolse ratio for the gradio- 
meter. However, if the sensitivity is limited by the Brownian motion noise, 

1/2 2 
one would have to maximize the function Q_ 1%!/^ instead, where Q_ is the

quality factor of the out-of-phase mode: fg = f^. 

In Section III of Paper I, we used the response current in Lq to define 
transfer functions in harmony with the model of a reduced equivalent accelero- 
raeter. Here we prefer using the response current at the SQUID input L^, a 
quantity which can be directly calibrated using the SQUID transfer function. 

The in-phase mode of motion has the following parameters :

X + X 
x+ = ^ . (22) 

In the calibration experiment, a common acceleration is provided by applying a 
sinusoidal displacement X(u) to the gradiometer assembly. In this case, Eqs. 
(14) can be solved to obtain 



(-0)2 + 0)^) x^.((»)) = u2x(w) = gj,(a)). (23) 



This acceleration produces a response current 1^(0)) which is proportional to

The transfer functions in the two circuit modes are therefore related by

This simple relationship follows because Eqs. (25) and (30) contain the same 
resonance frequency oJq, as is expected from Eqs. (lib) and (12a). 

The function H , (to) is measured by applying a sinusoidal acceleration 
g„(w) = w X(a)) to the gradiometer assembly at u below 1 Hz. The response 
current is measured with the SQUID amplifier which has a current-to-voltage 
transfer function of 0.20 V |iA~^. The acceleration is applied to the gradio- 
meter In the vibration isolation system described in Section IIIC. An 
electromagnetic shaker is coupled with a weak latex tubing from one side to 
the other of a vibration isolation stage (see Fig. 4) to provide a vertical 
acceleration to the gradiometer. The weak tubing acts as an attenuator, 
permitting a good signal-to-noise ratio without degrading the vibration 
isolation. The platform acceleration produced by the shaker has been 
calibrated by measuring its displacement and later confirmed with a commercial 
accelerometer . 

Figure 7 shows the calibration of the accelerometer mode measured in 
terms of the current response i+ at the SQUID input as a function of the 
applied acceleration g . Very small stored currents are used because of the 
extremely high sensitivity of the accelerometer. From the graph, we obtain a 
transfer function of (1.55 ± 0.05) mA per ra s for the accelerometer with 
only Ij^ = 1 mA stored on each side. The transfer function should be linear 
with the stored currents for low current values that produce negligible shifts 
of proof mass frequencies. This linearity is confirmed by Fig. 8, which is a 
plot of the measured acceleration-to-current transfer function as a function 



of \.

at 0.3 ~ 0.7 E Hz~ ' level. Therefore, we would not lose sensitivity by 

using a somewhat smaller gain. Stored currents of 0.55 A were used in the 

tests reported in Section VI. The transfer function deduced from the 

accelerometer mode calibration gives 62 pA E~^ at this current level. In 

Section VIA, we will check this value with the direct calibration of the 

gradiometer which employs gravity gradient signals.

V. INVESTIGATION (F INSTRUMENT NOISE AND ERRORS 

A. Envlronneatal Noise and Gonmoa Mode Balance 

Vibrations were found to be the most serious environmental noise. Our 
early tests with the gradloraeter rigidly mounted inside a liquid N2 shielded 
He dewar have encountered a vibration noise energy of 10 J at the proof mass 
resonance frequency of 19 Hz. Such a noise level corresponds to an equivalent 
Brownian motion at a noise temperature of 7 x 10^^ K, which is 10 times the 4 
K Brownian motion in vibration amplitude! 

When the gradiometer is balanced against common accelerations, its 
response to the vibration noise is greatly reduced. In the experiment, 
however, the gradiometer can be balanced only if we can use its acceleration 
response as a guide. Sufficient vibration isolation to achieve a noise level 
of the unbalanced gradiometer well within the amplifier dynamic range is 
therefore essential. A minimum of 60 dB isolation is required at the proof 
mass resonance frequencies in order to be able to operate at the full 
sensitivity of the accelerometers. 

If vibrations have a white acceleration spectrum, the low frequency noise 
will be Q times less than that at the proof mass resonances; thus, this noise 
will not overload the amplifier. Therefore, we chose to start with vibration 
isolation at higher frequencies where the SQUID amplifier was being over- 
loaded. This isolation would enable us to balance the accelerations and 
obtain a working gradiometer. 

If the proof mass acceleration noise amplitude can be reduced by four 
orders of magnitude, one will be able to observe the actual Brownian motion at 
the resonances in a gradiometer with a 60 dB balance. Although such an obser- 
vation may not improve the acceleration noise at the low frequency end, it

could prove to be very informative. This observation would determine the 
Rrownlan tnotlnn 1 pvpI nf the Instrument, anti show whether the observed 
acceleration noise comes from the environment or from the intrinsic noise of 
the instrument. 

Although an electronic "cold damping" technique [8,10] could have been 
applied to selectively filter the vibration aoise at the proof mass 
resonances, there were other modes in the environment which require wideband 
isolation. Therefore, we chose to develop a passive vibration isolation 
system with which the gradiometer can be tested In its simplest form. 
Satisfactory vibration isolation of the gradiometer was an essential step in 
leading to a successful demonstration of its performance and the operation of 
the device as a detector in the Inverse square law experiment [7,5]. Various 
combinations of low-pass vibration filters were tried to Isolate the noise 
coming from the ground and the dewar. Filters were improved in steps with the 
guidance of vibration data obtained in each step. 

With the three-stage vibration isolation system described in Section 
IIIC, the noise at the proof mass resonance decreased to 2x10 K, corres- 
ponding to a displacement of 5 x 10 m. The achieved improvement at 20 Hz 
was therefore better than 100 dB. At frequencies above 60 Hz, the spectrum 
indicated the SQUID-limited noise level. 

We now turn to the wideband common mode balance method described in 
Section HID of Paper I. In this method, calibrated sinusoidal acceleration 
signals are provided in the vertical direction by means of an electromagnetic 
shaker. Two out of the three stored currents Ip !£ and ±2 are iteratively 
adjusted for balance at 0.9 Hz (« 0)^/211) and 70 Hz (» o^q/I-k) in turn. This 
is a painstaking procedure since a balance point is searched for in a two- 
dimensional parameter space and sufficient time should be allowed after each 



■121- 



adjustment of currents for the mechanical disturbance of the system to damp 
down. 

Figure 9a shows the - 50 Hz noise spectrum of the gradioraeter balanced 
in the wide band to 1 part in 10-^. The transfer functions are obtained from 
the accelerometer mode calibrations using the relationships discussed in 

Section IV. This procedure gives [H .(a))]~ = o) x /i = 1.29 m s"^ A~^. The

Thus, this spectrum represents the observation of the Brownlan motion of the 
proof masses in the differential mode at the liquid He temperature. All other 
peaks are attenuated by about 10-*, which is the degree of balance obtained. 
This data confirms that the observed noise is almost entirely environmental 
and is not intrinsic to the gradioraeter. 

Figure 9b shows the - 10 Hz spectrum. The vertical scale of the plot 
has been calibrated by using the accelerometer mode, and confirmed by a direct 
calibration with a known gravity gradient signal which will be explained in 
Section VI. The noise in the 5 - 10 Hz band reaches below 1 E Hz"^/^ but the 
background seems to be close to 0.3 E Hz~^'^. Excessive vibration noise has 
degraded the spectrum at several peaks. The noise In the 1 - 4 Hz range is 
heavily contaminated by the rocking mode of the gradioraeter (fj.) at 2.5 Hz and 
other modes associated with the vibration isolation system. The - 1 Hz 
spectrum shown in Fig. 9c exhibits the swinging modes (fgi* ^82^ around 0.3

Our low-pass filters introduced numerous peaks at their own resonances. 
These filters were needed initially to prevent the SQUID from overloading at 
the higher frequency peaks. After the common mode balance, the gradioraeter 
became intrinsically insensitive to the environmental noise. Therefore, in 
the gradioraeter mode, the filters could be reduced to a minimum. We found a 
single-stage filter provided by the rubber tubing inside the vacuum was 
sufficient for a balanced gradioraeter and eliminated many undesirable peaks 
from the signal bandwidth. 

B. Gradlometer Noise 

Figure 10 shows the noise spectra of the gradioraeter obtained with the 
single-stage filter. The upper trace is the noise spectrum measured with the 
gradlometer in the accelerometer mode. The lower trace is the gradioraeter 
output after the common mode balance to 3 parts in 10 has been achieved 

toward an applied acceleration at 0.18 Hz. The SQUID noise limit of 0.069 E 

—1/2 
Hz ' with the associated 1/f noise is plotted by a dotted line. The 

vertical scale shows both the acceleration and gradient noise calibrations, 

which are related by Eq. (32). The ratio of the two spectra at any frequency, 

therefore, represents the actual reduction of noise outputs at that particular 

frequency as a result of the balance. 

First, comments are due for the measured acceleration noise spectrum (top 

trace). The general structure of this spectrum, which contains a broad peak 

around 0.25 Hz and a dip around 0.1 Hz, and the noise level of approximately

after waiting sufficiently long for resonances in the gradloraeter platform to 
damp down. This noise data has been reproduced by using conventional 
accelerometers mounted at the room temperature end of the pendulum suspension 
and on the laboratory floor, with the exception of the dip at 0.1 Hz for which 
the room temperature accelerometers did not have enough resolution. Since the 
data represents the residual acceleration noise of a deep underground 
laboratory, the upper curve in Fig, 10 must reflect geophysically significant 
seismic activity, except for the broad peak near 1 Hz which is due to the low- 
Q vertical mode of the rubber suspension. It is noteworthy that, while 
acceleration noise spectra measured at the top end of the pendulum in the 
vertical and horizontal directions looked similar, the noise output of the 
superconducting accelerometer correlated closely (> 90%) with the vertical 
acceleration. This correlation Indicates that the horizontal acceleration Is 
Indeed attenuated by the pendulum action, as has been predicted by the 
analysis shown In Appendix A.. Since the gradlometer Is pointing at an 
umbrella aagle 9^ = tan~^ •2'= 54.7°, the noise spectrum of Fig. 10 should 
then be raised by a factor of sec Q^ = /J to obtain the proper calibration of 
the vertical acceleration noise at College Park, Maryland. 

The lower trace of Fig. 10 represents a typical residual noise spectrum 
of a balanced gradlometer, with the exception of the 0.1 Hz peak of the 
torsional mode which disappears Into the background noise In the quietest 
situations. Unlike the torsional mode, however, the swinging mode at 0.32 Hz 
Is always present with Its peak at around 100 E Hz~^'^ level. Also 
persistently present Is the low frequency excess noise below 0.1 Hz. The 
noise level Is approximately 0.7 E Hz~^'^ between 0.5 and 0.9 Hz and reaches a 
minimum value of 0.3 E Hz~^'^ in a narrow window around 0.15 Hz. Comparison 
of the two traces reveals that the noise was reduced only by a factor of 3 x 



-126- 



10 , which represents a discrepancy of a factor of 10 from the value expected 
from the common mode balance. Another noticeable teature Is that, although 
the general structure of the background spectrum of the balanced gradiometer, 
with the resonance peaks removed, appears similar to the shape of the 
acceleration noise, the two spectra are not well correlated. Therefore, the 
residual noise of the gradiometer must be coming from a source other than 
vertical acceleration. 

It is desirable to determine the Browian motion noise level of the 
instrument. The power spectral density of the thermal noise of the gradio- 
meter is given in Eq. (87) of Paper I: 



Sr,B(f)=^^. (34)

it is difficult to measure the et receive damping time T(f) at f « f 
directly. If one assumes the "white acceleration noise model", T(f) in Eq. 
(34) can be replaced by the measured quantity, T;(f_). The measured Q values

In either case, the thermal noise would be negligible compared to the SQUID 
noise level of 0.069 E Ylz~^^^. 

We therefore conclude that the observed noise spectrum is extrinsic to 
the instrument and is due to error mechanisms which couple environmental noise 



-127- 



into the gradiometer output. Error sources responsible for the observed 
residual noise of the gradiometer are Identified in the following section with 
the aid of Appendices. 

C. Instruaeat Errors 

The dynamics of a platform suspended as a pendulum is analyzed in 
Appendix A. The pendulum decouples the gradiometer from angular motions of 
the external world. The horizontal acceleration transmitted to the gradio- 
meter is almost exactly cancelled by the modulated Earth's gravity which is 
caused by the induced tilt of the instrument. It is found, however, that the 
resulting angular velocity and angular acceleration can couple to the gradio- 
meter through centrifugal acceleration and through the misalignment of the 
effective gradiometer sensitive axis with respect to the baseline. Since the 
vertical component of linear acceleration is balanced out to a sufficient 
degree, the horizontal acceleration can produce a limiting instrument error by 
driving a secondary angular motion. 

Experimentally, the noise of the unbalanced gradiometer correlates with 
the external acceleration in the vertical direction. This correlation and the 
absence of a pronounced resonance peak at the pendulum frequency f = 0.32 Hz 
in the upper trace of Fig. 10 prove that the horizontal vibration Isolation by 
the pendulum action really works for an accelerometer . A close examination of 
the noise spectrum reveals a barely visible resonance peak at f above the 
background noise. This result renders a remarkable proof for the theory 
developed in Appendix A. According to Eqs. (A13), the horizontal acceleration 
sensed by an accelerometer under the pendulum suspension should be peaked at 
its resonance with a net gain of unity. Since the measured frequency spectra 
of the horizontal and vertical accelerations agree within 10 dB, the supercon- 



-128- 



ducting acceleroraeter pointing at an umbrella angle should measure a hori- 
zontal acceleration with a maximum amplitude of approximately 3 times that of 
the vertical acceleration at fp. Therefore, the horizontal acceleration peak 
sticks out barely above the vertical acceleration background. 

The analysis in Appendix A also leads to a prediction that, for a 
gradlometer. the overall effect of the pendulum action is that of a wideband 
attenuator for a horizontal acceleration, with its attenuation improving as 
the frequency approaches dc. In particular, when u > Qg/|6n ^|, the dominant 
coupling mechanism for the horizontal acceleration is the induced angular 
acceleration, as given by Eq. (24). Below this frequency, the centrifugal 
acceleration error dominates. The cross-over frequency is 10"^ Hz when 
|6n ^1 = 10" . The frequency response of the angular acceleration, Ih (u) I , 
has been plotted in Fig. A2. One can see a strong resemblance between this 
curve and the gradlometer output, the bottom trace of in Fig. 10, above 0.2 
Hz. In fact, the agreement improves when the spectrum of the driving back- 
ground acceleration is taken into account. In Fig, 11, we plot typical ob- 
served spectra for the vertical (top dotted line) and horizontal (top dashed 
line) accelerations A (u) and A. (w) as well as the gradlometer noise output 
(solid line). The residual vertical acceleration expected from the vertical 
common mode balance of 90 dB is plotted by the bottom dotted line. The bottom 
dashed line is a fit obtained by multiplying the spectrum for X^(u) with its 
transfer function through the angular acceleration. The misalignment error 
required for this fit is |5n ^ | 3 7 x 10"^, which is in close agreement with 

the value determined from the observed centrifugal acceleration: |5n ^| = 6 x 

-4 "^^ 

10 (see Appendix B). Notice that the gradlometer noise above 0.2 Hz is 

completely accounted for by this single error mechanism: the horizontal 

acceleration coupled through the induced angular acceleration .

The value of 6n ^ (the misalignment of the average sensitive axis of the 
+i 
gradioraeter with respect to the baseline vector 1) found above is rather 

large in view of the fact that the parallelism of the mating surfaces of the 

mechanical components of the gradioraeter was specified to 5 x 10~^. This 

mechanical precision implies that the experimental value of 6n_ (the relative 

misalignment between the sensitive axes of the component accelerometers) is of 

the order of 10 . A similar value could have been obtained also for 6n ^ if 

the center lines of the two accelerometers had been located within 10"^ mm 

from each other, which is certainly feasible. However, without realizing the 

seriousness of the induced angular acceleration problem, we had left the 

centering of the accelerometers to crude positioning by the mounting screws. 

This must have produced a mismatch of the center lines by approximately 0.1 

mm, causing the observed misalignment |6n ^| = 6 x 10 .

We now turn our attention to the excess noise below 0.1 Hz, seen in Fig.

caused by relaxation of trapped magnetic flux [13], the observed low frequency 
noise did not decrease significantly when the ambient magnetic field was 
reduced by a factor of 10^ by adding mu-metal shields. With these electrical 
sources of low frequency noise eliminated, we suspect the temperature drift 
and various nonlinear effects as the most likely sources for the observed 
excess noise. As has been discussed In the Appendix of Paper I, the supercon- 
ducting gradioraeter can be rather sensitive to temperature noise and 
nonlinearltles In the system can down-convert the wideband vibration noise to 
a gradient noise near dc. These low frequency error mechanisms are analyzed 
In detail In Appendix B of this paper. Owing to the limited resolution of the 
Ge thermometer used to monitor the temperature of the gradioraeter assembly.

the low frequeacy noise spectrum due to temperature fluctuatloa is computed 
from an independent measurement of the temperature noise of a liquid He bath 
of a different experimental setup [8] with the aid of a model for heat 
conductivity between the He and the gradlometer. Tlie resulting spectrum is 
found to be 

[Sp^T^f)]^^^ ^ !•« ^ 10"^ E ^'^''^ (Oa_H^l2 , (36) 

The scale-factor nonlinearity is computed from the second order circuit 
equations for component acceleroraeters, generalized from Eqs. (29) and (33) of 
Paper I. The low frequency noise expected from this is of comparable 
magnitude as the temperature effect at 0.1 Hz, but has a slightly different 
frequency dependence: 

tS^,cc(f>]^^^< 1 ^ 10"^ E Hz-l/2 (M_H£)3/2 , (37) 

The effect of the centrifugal acceleration is found to be about two orders of 
magnitude smaller than this value. 

The temperature noise of Eq, (36) is plotted in Fig. 11 by a dash-dot-dot 
line. The actual low frequency noise, denoted by X(a)), is about 30 times 
larger than this calculation. Since the temperature drift of the He bath de- 
pends on the exact geometry and thermodynamics of the particular cryostat in- 
volved, and on account of additional uncertainties in the thermal model of the 
instrument, the discrepancy by a factor of 30 does not exclude a possibility 
that the observed low frequency noise is due to temperature fluctuations. 
However, because a comparable level of noise is also predicted from the non- 
linearity of the instrument, we cannot be conclusive, without further experi-

and the gradiometer will be linearized by means of a force rebalance feedback 
with a hope to eliminate the low frequency excess noise. 

Another interesting error mechanism discussed in Appendix B is the 
second-harmonic generation by the centrifugal acceleration. This effect has 
been observed for large resonance peaks when the system is disturbed 
mechanically (Fig. B2). During the quiet operation of the instrument, how- 
ever, no second harmonics were observed above the background noise spectrum of 
the gradiometer.

VI. GRAVIT7 (StADIENT MEASUREMENT AND SENSITIVIT¥ GALIBRATIGN 

We shall now describe the gravity gradient calibration with the observa- 
tion of signals in two types of experiments. A precise calibration of the 
instrument can be obtained by using a periodic gravity gradient generator and 
averaging the signal over a number of periods. For such an ac experiment, 
however, any electrical pickup or mechanical cross coupling at the signal fre- 
quency must be eliminated. A "dc" experiment, in which a compact object Is 
brought near the gradiometer and removed, fares better in this regard. 
Although the use of signal averaging to improve signal the signal-to-noise 
ratio is less applicable here, any cross coupling problem will appear as a 
transient which can be distinguished from the dc shift in the gradiometer 
output caused by the gravity signal. We have performed both experiments 
successfully, as well as an inverse square law test in which the gradiometer 
outputs in three orthogonal orientations of the sensitive axis are summed. 

A. AC Gravity Gradient Bxperlnent 

The ac calibration of the gradiometer was obtained with a large (M = 1.6 
x 10-^ kg) Pb pendulum. The Pb sphere was located approximately in the same 
horizontal plane with the gradiometer at an average distance r of 2.3 m away. 
The gradiometer sensitive axis was at an angle of cot"^ ^ with respect to the 
horizontal plane and was in the plane of swing of the pendulum. The gradio- 
meter thus measured a gravity gradient component given by 



Til = - 3 I tl + 3 cos (2 cot-1 /2)] = - ^ . (38) 



When the pendulum swung by Ar(a)), it generated a change in the gravity 
gradient by

AT'ii(u) =^Ar((o). (39) 

r 

The SQUID amplifier output was measured with a spectrum analyzer. 

In order to assure that the observed signal was truly gravitational, 
various precautions were taken. When all three vibration isolation stages 
were used, excess signals at various harmonics of the pendulum frequency were 
seen. Correlation studies indicated that a strong second harmonic was 
generated by an air current driven by the swinging pendulum. This effect was 
eliminated by shielding the entire apparatus with a wooden enclosure and by 
using only one rubber filter which was inside the vacuum (see Fig. 4). The 
possibility of direct mechanical coupling between the pendulum and the gradio- 
meter has also been investigated. With the gradiometer charged in the 
accelerometer mode and the pendulum swinging at its full amplitude ±30", we

noise. The problem of such mechanical coupling has been alleviated by several 
factors. The pendulum was suspended from the 2 m thick concrete ceiling; 
whereas the dewar sat on a firm floor, 12 m below the ground level, in the 
basement of the building. Furthermore, the gradiometer was balanced against 
common accelerations, and the pendulum suspension used for the gradiometer 
gave isolation of tilt at all frequencies. In order to avoid electrical 
pickup at the signal frequency, a pneumatic driving mechanism was developed 
for the Pb pendulum and a natural resonant oscillation was used for most 
tests. 

The rms voltage measured at the pendulum frequency of 0.228 Hz is plotted 
in Fig. 12 against the calculated rms gravity gradient generated by the 
pendulum. This plot gives a calibration of 58 pA E"^ and agrees with the 
accelerometer mode calibration, reported in Section IVC, to within 7 %. This

either calibration were not Intended for high precision. 

B. DC Gravity Gradient Bxperlaent 

The noise spectrum of Fig. 10 indicates that the noise is lower below the 
0.3 Hz swinging mode of the platform. In order to perform a dc experiment, we 
put in active low-pass filters which filtered off the peaks above 0.16 Hz from 
the amplifier output. The response function of the filters to a step dc 
voltage change is shown in Fig. 13a. The characteristic rise time and ripples 
of the filters will be seen when a step function, gravity gradient signal is 
applied. 

We then moved a Pb brick in and out manually near the dewar at 10 ~ 15 s 
intervals. The brick weighed 12 kg and was brought to 0.17 m from the gradio- 
meter. The gravity gradient generated was about GM/r = 40 E, with a geome- 
trical factor of the order of unity which depends on the exact source-detector 
orientation. 

In Fig. I3b, the Pb brick was moved in, out and then In again, roughly in 
the horizontal plane of the gradiometer. The times and directions of the 
movement of the Pb brick are indicated by arrows. The line of sight of the 
source was approximately at an angle of cot" /2 from the gradiometer axis. 
The expected signal is then

peak dc current change is 2.3 nA. This current corresponds to (38 ± 2) E, in 
good agreement with Eq. (40), if the accelerometer mode calibration of Section 
IVC is used. 

For Fig. 13c, the brick was moved in the same way but along a direction 
roughly perpendicular to the gradiometer axis. The expected signal, If the Pb 
brick were a point mass and were located accurately, is given by 

2 
- ^ (1 - 1^) = -34 E. (41) 

r r 

The value measured from Fig. 13c is (-25 ± 2) E. An error of 10 % in r and in 
angular orientation could produce this gradient error of 30 %. The brick has 
a long rectangular shape so that a substantial amount of its mass was at other 
orientations and at larger separations relative to the gradiometer. 

The experiments have been qualitatively repeated at a few other orienta- 
tions relative to the gradiometer axis. The results agree with what we expect 
from the tensor property of the single-axis gradiometer. The validity of a 
gravity signal has therefore been substantiated. 

C. Inverse Square law Experlnent 

The most impressive demonstration that the gravity gradiometer output is 
a genuine gravity gradient signal comes from the inverse square law data [5, 
7] in which the angular pattern of the gravity gradient tensor is checked. 
For this experiment, the sensitive axis of the single-axis gradiometer was 
turned into three orthogonal directions by rotating the entire experimental 
cryostat on a turn table incrementally by 120° around the vertical axis while 
the gradiometer was suspended in the umbrella angle. The resulting three 
outputs and their sum are plotted in Fig. 14 after signal-averaging over 500

The signal and noise In this result have been analyzed carefully and published 
as a null test of the gravitational Inverse square law [5], Within the 
Inverse square law, the mutual cancellation of the signals in three arbitrary 
orthogonal directions Is strong proof that the instrument is really measuring 
genuine gravity gradient signals since it will be highly unlikely that other 
error signals also satisfy the condition (A3).

VII. SUHMART AND CGNCIUSIGN 

A superconducting gravity gradiometer has been constructed and evaluated 
very carefully. Both the signal transfer and noise characteristics of the de- 
vice agree closely with the theoretical model. Practical error sources have 
been identified experimentally as well as analytically. Although the instru- 
ment has only been tested on a passive platform without any feedback or error 

-1 /? 
compensation, it has shown a performance level of 0.3 ~ 0.7 E Hz ' , which 

surpasses the value achieved in a sophisticated room temperature gravity 

gradiometer [14] by three orders of magnitude in power. Further reduction of 

noise should be possible by improving the alignment of component accelero- 

raeters or by actively stabilizing the gradiometer platform against horizontal 

accelerations. The temperature of the He bath could also be controlled to 

reduce the low frequency noise of the instrument. 

The instrument has been used to carry out a preliminary null test of 
Newton's inverse square law of gravitation. The successful operation of the 
superconducting gradiometer in a rather simple setting demonstrates that the 
macroscopic quantum mechanical phenomenon exhibited in superconductivity can 
be taken advantage of to meet many practical challenges posed by sensitive 
gravity measurements. The careful modelling of the instrument and its experi- 
mental confirmation establishes the feasibility of constructing a more ad- 
vanced superconducting gravity gradiometer and carrying out precision gravity 
experiments. 

Guided by the theoretical and experimental work reported in Papers I and 
II, we are in the process of constructing a three-axis superconducting gravity 
gradiometer of an advanced design [6, 15], The new gradiometer incorporates 
additional technical innovations such as a "superconducting negative spring" 
and a "three-dimensional residual common mode balance" as well as the cold

damping and force rebalance feedbacks to achieve an Instrument noise level of 
iu ■ E HZ -'- lioj. sucn a sensitive and stable gradiometer will Jrind 
Important applications In inertial navigation and geophysical survey as well 
as in fundamental physics experiments. A. series of precision inverse square 
law tests as well as tests of general relatlvlsttc effects are planned with 
this instrument both in the terrestrial laboratory and in space [17, 18]. The 
work presented here lays the ground work for further development of supercon- 
ducting technology for gravity and acceleration measurements.

APPENDIX A: VIBRATION ISOLATIGN BY PENDDUM ACTION 

Isolation of horizontal vibrations by pendulum action has been analyzed 
in Ref. 7 by treating the angular raotion of the pendulum in time domain. Here 
we treat the problem In frequency domain. For a platform suspended In a 
stationary laboratory, the angular amplitude of the pendulum is of the order 
of 10 rad at its resonance frequency. Effects that arise from second order 
contributions in angle will therefore be negligible in general. 

1. Vibration Isolation of an Acceleroneter 

We first consider a single acceleroraeter mounted on a platform suspended 
by a symmetric pendulum of effective length l the distance between the pivot 
point and the "center of percussion" of the platform (see Fig. Al(a)). The 
ettectlve length of the pendulum is defined from w , the degenerate (angular) 
resonance frequency of the swinging mode, by 



^p = Se/'^p • (Al) 



Let the center of mass of the acceleroraeter proof mass be located at a 
vertical distance Jl^ below the pivot point with its sensitive axis defined by 
n. We further assume a "perfectly rigid" pendulum in which the pendulum mass 
and the suspension rod form a perfectly rigid body and the pivot is perfectly 
rigid for linear motions while it is perfectly soft for angular motions. This 
condition could be approached in practice by designing the pendulum with the 
resonance frequencies of unwanted modes high compared to the swinging mode 
frequency u) . 

Under these assumptions, the acceleroraeter platform is completely iso-

lated from the angular motions of the celling from which the pendulum Is sus- 
pended. This Isolation is Independent of frequency although, in practice, 
finite rigidity for the torsional mode tends to make the pendulum a low-pass 
filter for the torsional jitter of the external world. No attenuation is ex- 
pected for vertical vibrations. Since linear accelerations can be balanced 
out in one direction in a gradiometer, our Interest is in the extent to which 
horizontal accelerations sl it) can be rejected by means of the pendulum 
action. 

Let us denote the horizontal displacements of the pivot point and the 
center of percussion of the platform by K^(t) and r. (t), respectively. Then, 
the equation of motion of the pendulum can be written as 



^h ^ ^I'^K - K^ ^ "p(^ - ^) = 0- (A2)

where the main contributions to the two terms in Eq. (All) have cancelled each

from the tilt of the platform.

At resonance, the platform is actually driven to an amplitude Q times larger, 
as can be seen from Eq. (AlO), and the pendulum action balances the horizontal 
acceleration to Q so that the net gain will be unity. Away from resonance, 
the horizontal acceleration is attenuated by Q~ times a frequency factor

which helps the isolation further. Thus, we have proved that the pendulum 
suspension Indeed provides wideband isolation of an accelerometer from 
horizontal accelerations as well as tilts except in the immediate vicinity of 
its resonance frequency. 

We have assumed symmetry of the pendulum frequency in two horizontal 
directions for simplicity. Equation (A12) shows that this assumption is not 
necessary for the operation of the pendulum action. Since the accelerometer 
is not sensitive to a horizontal acceleration perpendicular to n, the fore- 
going analysis will be valid as long as A^ is chosen to be equal to the effec- 
tive length of the pendulum A in the vertical plane which Includes n. 

2. Vibration Isolation of a Gravity Gradiometer 

We now turn to a gradiometer mounted on a platform under pendulum suspen- 
sion (Fig. Al(b)). In general, the two component accelerometers have slightly 

A A 

different sensitive axes, n. and n„, and are located at different distances, 
A, and I2* ^^°^ ^^^ pivot point. The distance between the pivot point and the 
center of percussion, which is near the midpoint between the two proof masses, 
is denoted by A^. Since a very small differential acceleration signal is 
sought for in general, errors coupled through misalignments of the sensitive 
axes will have to be examined carefully. The result of a general analysis of 
the misalignment errors is given by Eq. (A6b) of Paper I, which can be written 
in the form: 



6r. .(t) =|-5n . [L - a(t)]

I. The gravity gradient (f^) term can be ignored in comparison with the 
gravity (g^) term, and the correction terra to centrifugal acceleration can be 
dropped since the full centrifugal acceleration is regarded as a separate 
error source in Paper II, 

Upon Fourier transformation, Eq. (A14) becomes, to the first order in t .

where appropriate quantities for the pendulum suspension have been substituted 

into the linear and angular accelerations. Here X (w) is the horizontal

The first terra in Eq. (A19) is again minimized by choosing X^ = l^\ i.e., 
by locating the center of the gradiometer at the center of percussion of the 
platform. In this case, however, the horizontal acceleration couples in 
through the second term which represents the effect of the induced angular 
acceleration. In order to balance out A. (u) in the two terras, A^ should 
rather be chosen to satisfy 

X ~ % 
( P °) 6n + (n . z) 6n . - (6n . . z) n = 0. (A20) 

Since there are three independent components in this equation, it is impos- 
sible in general to satisfy this equation by adjusting a single parameter A^ 

even if 6n and 6n ^ are predetermined. Therefore, in order to obtain a wide- 

+A 
band rejection of the horizontal accelerations in a gradiometer by means of 

the pendulum suspension, a sufficiently small value of 6n ^ is required. 

An additional error term is generated through the centrifugal accelera- 
tion of the gradiometer proof masses Induced by X (w). This error is given by 
Eq. (AlO) of Paper I: 



6r ((o) = -2[(n . ^^) {n • ^ (w)} - ^^ • ^ (u)], (A21)

Equation (A23) shows that the pendulum works as an attenuator with an attenua-

tion factor proportional to (A/JJ.-,) |6n ^| and {XllJ){0.^/ii)) , respectively, for 
each error term, plus a high-pass filter with the cut-off frequency a)-. 
Therefore, for a gradiometer, the pendulum action attenuates the horizontal 
accelerations at all frequencies , with the isolation becoming perfe ct as the 
signal frequency approaches dc . This is usually sufficient because the signal 
bandwidth satisfies w < o) in most applications of a gradiometer. It is truly 
remarkable that the pendulum action accomplishes a nearly perfect , passive 
vibration isolation in two dimensions near dc because vibration isolation 
below 1 Hz is very difficult to achieve by means of conventional spring-mass 
isolators.

ment has an almost identical frequency response which cancels the direct 
transmission term to approximately Q . What is left over after this cancel- 
lation is the frequency characteristic of a high-pass filter given by Eq. 
(A25).

APPENDIX B: LOW FREQUENCY NOISE (F THE GRADICMETER 

Gravity gradient signals of Interest are usually at very low frequencies 
(10 ~ 1 Hz). Excess low frequency noise (red noise), which raises the 
overall instrument noise above the Brownian motion noise, is therefore of 
great concern in constructing a sensitive gravity gradiometer. Red noise in 
the gradiometer output can be generated by thermal and mechanical drift of the 
gradiometer, nonlinearities in the instrument, centrifugal acceleration of the 
platform, the 1/f noise and drift of the detecting electronics, etc. One way 
of overcoming certain types of such low frequency noise is an up-conversion of 
the gravity gradient signal by rotating the instrument followed by a 
heterodyne detection of the modulated signal [19]. The rotation, however, 
increases the centrifugal acceleration and introduces additional dynamically 
induced aoise sources. In this Appendix, we analyze how various error 
mechanisms contribute to the excess low frequency noise for a non-rotating 
gravity gradiometer. 

I. Temperature Drift 

Temperature coefficients of the superconducting gravity gradiometer have 
been derived in Appendix of Paper I. It has been found that the dominant 
effect comes from the functional dependence of the penetration depth X(T) on 
temperature T. The good thermal conductivity through the gradiometer body 
makes the differential temperature fluctuation Tj(a)) negligible compared to 
the common temperature fluctuation T^(a)). The temperature-induced error can 
therefore be written as 

^Si^lioi) = hTc(w) T^,(a)), (Bl)

Thus far the temperature-induced error has been analyzed in the frequency 
domain. Although this description is complete, it is often convenient to 
measure and compensate for the temperature effect in real time. Notice that

Thus, a linear temperature drift causes a 1/f^ power spectrum at the gradio-

In the experiment, the gradlometer was thermally isolated from the He 
bath through vacuum. The large heat capacity of the gradiometer body and the 
low conductivity through the electrical leads and the residual He gas formed a 
low-pass RC filter for heat flow with a transfer function: 



MO=rTl-2^^' (B13) 



where t^ is the filter time constant. In high vacuum, Xp exeeded 10^ s. In 

fact , we had to maintain a pressure level of approximately 10 mm Hg to bring 

the gradiometer assembly into thermal equilibrium with the He bath in a 

reasonable time after turning on heat-switches on the gradiometer. A typical 



1.COJ7UUOC UJ.1UC useu was ip = juu s. A ue crjerraoraecer was mounteo on tne 
gradiometer assembly to measure Tj,(t). However, the thermometer did not have 
enough resolution to track the stable temperature of the gradiometer. All we 
could determine directly is a rough estimate of the experimental upper limit, 
2 X 10"^ K hr"l, for dT^,/dt so that 



*rms i ^'^ ^ ^^"^ ^ ^~^' ^^^^^ 



Substituting t = 125 s, the sampling time used for the spectrum analyzer, and 
Eqs. (B6) and (B14) into Eq. (B12), we obtain 

[Sp^T(f)]l/2 < 2.9 X 10-2 g Hz-1/2 (£ii_S5.). (b15) 
In a separate experiment [8], the temperature of the He bath was measured 



■159- 



by dipping a "supercoaducting penetration depth thermometer" of the type 
similar to the one described in Ref. 21 into a storage dewar. The Fourier 

analysis of this data is shown in Fig. Bl . This data indicates that, in the 

—2 —1 
frequency range of interest between 10 Hz and 10 Hz, the spectrum can be 

described by 



fVf)]Ba?h = 1-1 ^ ^""'^ ^ «^"^^^ (^^). (B16) 



Since the exact behavior of the temperature noise should depend on the 
characteristics of the dewar and the insert as well as the barometric pressure 
fluctuation in the laboratory, this data should be interpreted as an order-of- 
magnitude estimate for the temperature noise in our experiment. Combining Eq. 
(B16) with Eqs. (B6) and (B13), one finds 

F 
This estimate falls within the approximate limit given by Eq. (B15). 

2. General Gonslderatlon of Nballnear Effects 

Since nonllnearlty Is a higher order effect, the most Important error 
coupling mechanisms will Involve the second order nonllnearlty. Thus we 
restrict our discussion to a nonlinear behavior of the form:

The driving acceleration g(t) could be either g„(t) or gj(t). In this

In practice, the 6-functions in these equations are replaced by continuous 
functions with finite peaks and widths due to the finite sample length t used 
in the computation of the spectral densities. Denoting this narrowband 
response function with a subscript t, the one-sided spectral densities can be 
written as

of g comes from the assumption that the phase 9 of the signal is random. For 

a signal in phase with the reference signal, g /2 must be replaced by g^ in 

I Eqs. (B27) and (B28). 

The exact line shape 6^(f) depends on the window function employed in the 

Fourier analysis. A simple box-car shape window yields 



5^(f ) = 6^(f ) = /l(2^ e-J2^ft dt = lilLi2Efil . (b29)

In the experiment, a Banning window function [23] with the characteristic

From the foregoing analysis. It is easily seen that 

Tlie value of |hjj(f)| obtained from this relationship could then be substituted 
into Eq. (B34). 

3. Nonllnearltles of the lastruiiient 

A general expression of the nonlinearity errors was given in Paper I: 

Sgd.N^^) = hcc^>^) G^,^(w) + hjj(w) Gjj^Cu) + h^^iui) 6^,^(0)), (B38) 

where 0^,^.(0)), G^jj(a)) and G^j(u)) are the Fourier transforms of [g^(t)]^, 
[gd(t)] and gc(t)gd(t). The derivation of the nonlinearity coefficients in 

I this equation requires knowledge of experimental details. 

We divide nonlinear mechanisms into three classes: 1) the instrument 
scale factor nonlinearity internal to the gradlometer, 2) dynamical nonlinear 
effects in which second order terms are produced by the finite compliance of 

^ the gradlometer structure in undesirable directions, and 3) nonlinear effects 
of the platform. The first class of nonlinearity can be overcome by 
linearizing the gradlometer by means of a "force rebalance" feedback; i.e. by 
operating the gradlometer as a null detector in a feedback circuit. This 
method, however, will not suppress the latter two classes of nonlinearity 



-165- 



errors inasmuch as these nonlinear effects are produced external to the 
instrument. In the pendulum-suspended platform, the third class of non- 
linearity is produced by the centrifugal acceleration of the platform. In 
this section, we discuss the first two classes of nonlinearity, deferring the 
treatment of the third class to the following section. 

The scale factor nonlinearity can come from a failure of Hooke's law in 
the mechanical front end (ax/3g) , from a nonlinear response of the transducer 
(ai/Bx), and from nonlinearity in the gain of the amplifier (av/ai) (see Fig. 
1 of Paper I). Since the SQUID operates in a negative feedback mode, it is a 
highly linear device and 9V/ai can be regarded as a constant. Further, the 
"cantilever" suspension spring for the proof masses has been specially de- 
signed to achieve a high degree of linearity along the sensitive axis. How- 
ever, the transfer function ai/ax of the superconducting transducer is 
intrinsically nonlinear, as can be seen In Eqs. (19), (25), and (32) of Paper 
I. The second order terras in the transducer transfer functions vanish if L^^ = 
Lv (symmetric coils) and i = (absence of symmetric current). The first 
condition, however, is difficult to satisfy in practice because the spacings 
between the coils and the surfaces of the proof masses are not easily matched. 
In order to obtain relationships between the nonlinearity coefficients of 
the component acceleration transducers and of the gradiometer, we expand the 
current responses iT^(t) of individual transducers as functions of driving 
accelerations g^^(t): 



iT^(t) = h^^ gi,(t) + h^^ gj(t) + ... = h^^ [gi,(t) + C^ g^(t) + ...]. (B39) 

Here an instantaneous response of the circuit has been assumed because of the 
low frequency nature of the signals under investigation. The coefficients of 



-166- 



the linear terms are matched by the common mode balance of the gradiometer so 
that the gradiometer output can be written as 

g^(t) = gjCt) + (C^ - C^^) [g2(t) +^g2(t)] + (C^ + C^) g^(t)gd(t) + .... 

(B40) 

The transition from Eq. (B39) to Eq. (B40) is approximate because the 
electrical coupling between the two component transducers affects C^, as they 
are combined into a gradiometer. Taking the Fourier transform of this 
equation and comparing it with Eq. (B38), one can identity 



nN „N 



h^cCtj) = Ah^dCu) = C^ - Cj , (B4la) 



M M 



h^^i^oi) = Cj + C^ . (B41b) 

Notice that nonllnearity arises in the gradiometer even when the nonlinear! tv 

coefficients of the individual acceleration transducers are matched: i.e., 

N JJ 
Cj = C^. The only way to eliminate the nonllnearity from the gradiometer 

scale factor is by making cj = C? = 0. 

In the low frequency limit , one can derive an approximate relationship : 

rN . _1 A ^a " H:b . . 1 V^S^ ,,,,, 

where d^^ is the average coll-to-proof-mass spacing. Substituting values 
listed in Table 1, we find C J = - 7.5 x 10"2 (m s~h~^ and C2 - 
-1.7 x 10~1 (m s"2)-l so that 



-167- 



-1 r» .-2^-l 



hj.(,(a)) = 4hjd^"^ ^ -1.0 X 10"^ (m s~^) \ (B43a) 



\^(ui) = -2.5 X 10"1 (m s~2)~l. (B43b) 



These values must be considered only as order-of -magnitude estimates in view 
of the approximations used in the derivation. 

The dynamic nonlinearity of the instrument arises from the finite com- 
pliance of the gradiometer structure which allows the misalignment angles 6n_ 

and 6n ^ to be driven by external accelerations a(t) or a(t). From Eq. (A6b) 

+i ^ ^ 

of Paper I, it is clear that a nonlinearity error arises if 6n or 6n ^ is 

+A 
proportional to a(t) or a(t). A bending mode of the structure can be excited 

by the perpendicular component of a(t) or a(t) applied to the midpoint between 

the two acceleroraeters. The symmetry of the induced motion is such that the 

sensitive axes of the component acceleroraeters, n^ and n^, go out of alignment 

with respect to the baseline vector A, with opposite signs for a(t), and with 

an equal sign for a(t). Therefore, the induced misalignments have functional 

forms given by 



6n_(t - f) = h^_^(t - f) aj^(t'), (B44a) 



aa 



6n .(t - t') = h^_^(t - f) aj^(t'), (B44b) 

+1 aa 



where the history dependence of the coupling coefficients has resulted from 
the resonant response. Equation (A6b) of Paper I is then generalized into 



6gd N^t) = - J^[6n_(t-t') • t(t') + A 6n .(t-t') x n • a(t')] dt'. (B45) 



-168- 



The general form (B18) is obtained if Eqs. (B44) are substituted Into Eq. 
(BAS). The corresponding equation for frequency domain is 

Hi^^ioi) = h^^(u) G^>(w) + h^_^(a)) G^^Co)), (B46) 
aa aa aa aa 

2 2 
where G (u) and G (u) are the Fourier transforms of a (t) and a,(t), 

aa aa 

respectively. 

The coefficient h (u) has been computed [24] for a circular tube that 
aa 
connects the two accelerometers. We only quote the result here: 



aa iw^ Q„ B B 



where 



f(r) = [(1 - r2) + Qg2 r2]-l/2. (b48) 



' Here Ug and Qg represent the (angular) resonance frequency and the quality 

factor of the bending mode Involved. A similar result Is expected for 

aa 

Experimentally, the mounting cube for the gradiometer was made rather 

rigid so that a)g/2ii ^ 300 Hz. This gives upper limits for the nonllnearlty 

error coefficients : 

|h^^(<^)| - l^^><^)| < ^-7 X 10"^ (m s~2)-l , u < Ug. (B49) 
aa aa 

This is completely negligible compared to the coefficients of the scale factor 
nonllnearlty, evaluated in Eqs. (B43). Unlike the latter, however, the former 



-169- 



cannot be reduced by means of feedback operation of the instrument. It can 

therefore become a dominant source of nonllnearity when a very sensitive 

gradioraeter is operated in the force rebalance mode. Further, larger values 

of h^^(u) and h^^Cw) may arise under certain conditions from undesirable modes 

aa aa 
of the suspension springs of the proof masses which are much more compliant 

than the mounting structure of the gradiometer. 

Experimental values for the scale factor nonlinearity coefficients can be 

obtained in principle from the curvature of the calibration curve of the 

instrument. In the calibration data displayed in Figs. 7 and 12, however, the 

stochastic measurement error was too large to determine a systematic departure 

from a linear response. Only an upper limit for Cv + CI, can be obtained from 

Fig. 7. For an applied acceleration g^=4xl0ms, the current response 

lies within 5 % from the linear fit of the data. Equation (B39) then implies 



i- (Cj + C^) g^ < 0.05 g^ (B50) 



or 



C^ + (^^ 0.1 g~^ = 2.5 (m s~2)-l. (B51) 

The predicted value for Cy + C, given by Eq. (B43b), is an order of magnitude 
smaller than this experimental limit. 

Using the nonllnearity coefficients predicted by Eqs. (43), one can com- 
pute the contribution of the scale factor nonlinearity to the low frequency 
noise spectrum of the gradiometer. The total common acceleration measured in 
the experiment is approximately 



-170- 



r S„(f') df < 10"10 (m s~2)2. (B52) 



Substituting this and |hj,j.(f)| = 0.1 (m s~^)"^, Jl = 0.16 m, t = 125 s into Eq. 
(B34), we find 



[Sp^^^(f)]l/2 < 1 X 10-2 E H^-1/2 (Oa_H^^3/2, (3535 

Effects coming from terms involving gj(t) can be shovm to be many orders of 
magnitude smaller. 



4. Centrifugal Acceleration 

Here we consider nonlinear effects of the platform which convert external 
accelerations into low frequency acceleration noise of the platform, which 
then couples Into th» CTraH^r«1TW»^pr bv fh«» Hnpar fransfer function of the 
instrument. A well-known nonlinear mechanism of the platform is its angular 
motion driven by an external acceleration. The resulting centrifugal 
acceleration is a second order effect. 

An accelerometer mounted on the pendulum-suspended platform will ex- 
perience a centrifugal acceleration a„(t), in the radial direction away from 
the pivot point, with a magnitude: 



ac(t) - Ap Qp(t). (B54) 



For sinusoidal motions : 



}p(t) = Qp cos (a)t/2 + Bq), (B55) 



-171- 



af,(t) = ap cos (ojt + ) + a^., (B56) 



Co' 



the amplitudes are related by 



^C = i ^p ^p • (B57) 



By using Eqs. (A6b) and (A12), Q can be related to the apparent acceleration 
gp measured by the accelerometer at the fundamental frequency f /2 : 

1 ^ 

|n • (Q X z) I p p 

where Q = Q /Q is the unit vector along the direction of Q and S.^ = A has 
been assumed. Likewise, a^^ can be related to the acceleration gg measured by 
the accelerometer at the second harmonic f: 



Aq = —;: TT- gg' (B58b) 

In • zl 



Substitution of Eqs. (B58) into Eq. (B57) leads to Eq. (B37) with the identi- 
fication : 

9 

|hj,(f)| = JVL , / . (B59) 

" |n . (Q X z)|2 gfi 

where Eq. (Al) has been used. The quantity |hjg(f ) | is the coefficient of 
apparent nonlinearity of an accelerometer suspended by a pendulum. 

When Aq # A for the accelerometer, Eq. (B58a) must be replaced by

Therefore, the magnitude of apparent nonlinearity coefficient depends on how 
well the horizontal acceleration is rejected by the pendulum action. 

For a gradioraeter mounted on the same platform, A_ should be replaced by 
A in Eq. (B54) so that 



aQ = j a Q^ . (B60) 



With the aid of Eqs. (A6b) and (A19) , Q and a^, can be related to the apparent 
differential acceleration signals gp and gg at f/2 and f, respectively:

This is the coefficient of apparent nonlinearity of a gradiometer suspended by 
a pendulum.

The condition i^ = X is satisfied for the common mode and the gradioraeter

In the experiment, we were able to observe |hjj(f)| at f = 2f by de- 
tecting the second harmonic amplitudes for the swinging mode of resonance fre- 
quency fp = 0.32 Hz. Figure B2 shows the data for the common acceleroraeter 
mode (crosses), the single acceleroraeter raode (dots), and the gradioraeter mode 
(triangles). The experimental values of |hjj(2f )| are deterrained frora these

Notice that all three of these values agree with the corresponding theoretical 
values within a factor of 2. 

This excellent agreement gives us confidence that the observed second 
harmonics are indeed the centrifugal acceleration of the platform. Since only 
one parameter, |6n ^|, Is relatively unknovm in Eq. (B62), one can use this 
equation and the measured value of |hjj(2f )| for the gradiometer to obtain a 
more reliable value of the misalignment : 



|6n J = 6 X 10"'^. (B66) 

+1 

This represents a better measurement of |6n ^ | than the estimate 7 x 10 
obtained from the observed wideband noise spectra in Section VC. 

We now compute the low frequency noise of the gradiometer which is 
generated by the centrifugal acceleration. The formalism developed in Section 
B2 of this Appendix can be directly applied to the nonlinear equation: 



6g (t) = S.[l - (n • Q)2] Q^Ct). (B67) 

d.C P 

Substituting Jl[l - (n • Q)''] 6(t - t') into hjj(t - t') and Qp(t) into g(t), 
one finds the power spectral density of the centrifugal acceleration error: 



A A 



S (t) = [1 - (n . Q)2] -^ -1 [/" S (f ') df ']2, (B68)

where S (f) is the power spectral density of Q (t).

where S_^(f) is the power spectral density of the horizontal acceleration X (t) 

of the pivot point. Thus, the pendulum acts as a narrowband filter centered 

at f so that S (oj/Zit) can be evaluated at f and taken out of the integral. 

^ A ^ 

The integral then has the well-known value it/2 so that

When the experimental values x^ = 150 s, t = 125 s, A- = 2.4 m, and S (f )

The derivation of this spectrum does not involve a detailed model for the 

apparent nonlinearity coefficient |h^(f ) | . Neither does it depend on the 

estimate of integrated acceleration noise such as Eq. (B52), since the high

A three-axis superconducting gravity gradiometer with a potential sensi- 
tivity better than 10"^ Eotvos Hz~^' is currently under development for 
applications in space. Though such a high sensitivity may be needed for only 
a limited number of terrestrial applications, superconductivity offers many 
extraordinary effects which can be used to obtain a gravity gradiometer with 
other characteristics necessary for operation in a hostile moving-base envi- 
ronment. Utilizing a number of recently devised techniques which rely on 
certain properties of superconductors, we have produced a design for a sensi- 
tive yet rugged gravity gradiometer with a high degree of stability and a 
common mode rejection ratio greater than 10^. With a baseline of 0.11 m, a 
sensitivity of 0.1 Eotvos Hz~^'^ is expected in an environment monitored to a 
level of 10"^ m s~^ Hz"^/^ for linear vibration and 7 x 10~° rad s~^ Hz~^' 
for angular vibration. A conventional stabilltlzed platform can be used at 
this level. The intrinsic noise level, which is two orders of magnitude 
lower, could be achieved by monitoring the attitude with a superconducting 
angular accelerometer which is under development. In addition, the new 
gradiometer design has the versatility of adapting the instrument to different 
gravity biases by adjusting stored dc currents.

I. INTRGDUCTIGN 

The Equivalence Principle of Einsteir. n^^kcs it impossible, evea l.i 
principle, to separate gravity and acceleration by a local measurement. How- 
ever, by making a differential measurement over a baseline, one can cancel out 
acceleration and detect gravity without being confused by platform motion. 
Although torsion balances have been used to detect gravitational force 
gradients for over two centuries, only in the most recent two decades have we 
seen serious efforts to develop moving-base gravity gradioraeters.^ '^'^ Re- 
search on superconducting gravity gradiometers started more recently as an 
outgrowth of the superconducting transducer work for low temperature gravita- 
tional wave detectors. 

In a superconducting instrument, the inconvenience of cryogenic operation 
is offset by the opportunity of utilizing many exotic properties of supercon- 
ductors to Imprnvp Mi^ «en«itl\'ity and stability of gravity sensors. Ii. aJdi- 
tion to the obvious reduction of the thermal noise of the instrument, the 
quantization of magnetic flux can be used to obtain "perfectly" stable means 
of signal transduction, scale factor matching, and proof mass levltatlon. The 
availability of SQUIDs (Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices) at 
liquid helium temperatures is another Important factor that makes the super- 
conducting device attractive. SQUIDs are highly sensitive flux measuring 
devices which are based on the concepts of Josephson tunneling and fluxoid 
quantization in superconducting loops. The commercial SQUIDs we employ are 
coupled to input colls for measuring small currents. The sensitivity of these

designed primarily for applications in space. However, a sensitive gravity 
gradiometer would also have a number of terrestrial applications if a satis- 
factory method of rejecting the high levels of environmental noise can be 
found. This paper describes a design for a superconducting gravity gradio- 
meter which incorporates several new features to help deal with the problems 
of a dynamically noisy environment. This design maintains a high sensitivity 
along with the convenience of a short base line. A versatile magnetic levita- 
tion Is applied to the proof masses so that the same hardware can be operated 
in any gravity environment from gg to 1 gg (gg is the earth's gravitational 
acceleration) by adjusting persistent currents in a number of superconducting 

coils. 

Although the analysis in this paper will be confined to an in-line (i.e. 
a gradiometer which is sensitive to the diagonal components of the gravity 
gradient tensor, Tj^^) component gradiometer, it can be extended to a cross- 
component gradiometer (i.e. one which is sensitive to an off-diagonal 
component of the gravity gradient tensor, T^^j , j * i). 

II. PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION 

An in-line component superconducting gravity gradiometer consists of a 
pair of spring-mass accelerometers coupled together by a superconducting 
circuit to measure differential acceleration.^ Each accelerometer consist of 
a superconducting proof mass confined to move along a single axis and a spiral 
superconducting sensing coil located near the surface of the proof mass (see 
Fig. 1). An acceleration will cause a displacement of the proof mass which, 
because of the Meissner effect, will modulate the inductance of the coil at 
frequencies down to dc. The sensing coil is connected to the input coil of a 
SQUID amplifier forming a closed superconducting loop. Since the flux in this

loop must remain constant, the change In the Inductance of the sensing coll 
results In a current change through the SQUID Input coll. In this manner very 
small accelerations can be detected. 

In the present design, each proof mass is confined to move along a single 
axis by a pair of low-loss cantilever spring systems. In practice, the 
dynamic axes of the proof masses cannot be perfectly aligned and this mis- 
alignment can cause various error signals to couple to the gradiometer output. 
These effects will be discussed in Section VI. As in any two-mass system with 
only one degree of freedom, the motions of the proof masses can be decomposed 
into a common mode (i.e. the displacements of the proof masses are in the same 
direction) and a differential mode (i.e. the displacements are in opposite 
directions). By coupling the two proof masses together by persistent currents 
Ijj and Ijj2» flowing in the closed superconducting loops shown by the solid 
lines in Fig. 2, and adjusting the ratio of 1^^ to 1^2' ^^® sensitivity of the 
system to common-mode accelerations can be balanced out. By using a similar 

C Q 

design, a balance of 2 parts in 10 has been demonstrated. Though this 
degree of balance should be sufficient in a low noise space environment, a 
higher degree of rejection to common-mode noise is necessary for terrestrial 
applications and ground tests of the instrument. 

By incorporating additional superconducting coils, shown by the dotted 
lines in Fig. 2, into the circuitry, the frequency of the common-mode 
resonance can be increased and the resonance peak passively damped without 
affecting the differential-mode resonance. This effect may be understood by 
noting that the flux in each of these loops, must remain constant. The 
electromagnetic energy in these two loops is given by,

where ^^-^ aad $^,2 ^^^ ^^^ trapped fluxes. In a zero-g environment, ^^-^ = ^^2 
Is chosen. In the earth's gravity environment, one of these fluxes can be 
greater than the other. When the gradiometer experiences a common-mode 
acceleration, the two Inductances In each loop change in a like manner re- 
sulting in a change In E. However, during a differential acceleration, the 
changes in the two Inductances cancel and E remains constant. Increasing the 
common-mode frequency decreases the sensitivity of the gradiometer to common- 
mode accelerations while making Isolation of the common-mode resonance peak 
from environmental noise a simpler task. This isolation, along with the 
passive damping, limits the amplitude of the signal produced by the common- 
mode peak at the input of the SQUID amplifier and allows greater dynamic 
range . 

The upward shifting of the common-mode spring constant not only increases 
the rejection to common-mode accelerations, but it also increases the 
linearity of the gradiometer by confining the motions of the proof masses. 
Though the springs are designed for a high degree of linearity, the spring 
constant still contains higher order terras which may become significant for 
large displacements. 

A conventional approach to the linearity and dynamic range problem of an 
inertial instrument is to use an active feedback network which senses and 
cancels the response of the proof mass. One disadvantage of this approach is 
the possible Introduction of a significant noise source from the feedback 
signal. Since the circuit discussed above is passive and superconducting, 
there are no additional noise sources to increase the fundamental noise level 
of the gradiometer. If necessary, active "force rebalance" feedback can of 
course be applied to both common and differential modes in addition to the 
simple passive circuitry.

IV. SUFERCONDUCING NEGATIVE SPRING 

A description of the superconducting negative spring has been presented 

Q 

in a previous paper . That paper, however, gave only a numerical solution. 
In this section, after a discussion of its application to the gradioraeter, we 

-194- 



present an anaiycicai solution which allows the data to be more easily related 
to other geometries. 

The noise power spectral density of the gradiometer can be expressed^^ as 

Sp(f) = —5- [2Ttf kgT R(f) + ^ E^(f)], (22) 

where m, Jl, E^(f), and 0t) are, respectively, the mass of each proof mass, the 
baseline, the amplifier noise energy (called the "input energy resolution"), 
and the energy coupling factor for the amplifier. The function R(f) is a 
frequency-dependent damping factor, which becomes equal to the inverse of the 
quality factor at the resonance frequency f = hi^^/lii^ The first term on the 
right hand side of Eq. (22) is due to the Brownian motion noise and the second 
Letiu oil the right is due to the noise ot the amplifier. This version of the 
sensitivity equation is different from the version which appeared in Ref. 
10. In its present form, the equation has been modified to include the fact 
that the magnitude of the force fluctuations at the signal frequency f is, in 
general, different from that at the resonance frequency. Namely, the Brownian 
motion noise has a frequency dependence which is governed by the nature of the 
loss mechanism in the spring. 

The superconducting gravity gradiometer at present has its fundamental 
noise limited by the amplifier noise rather than the Brownian motion noise. ^ 
Equation (22) indicates that one of the most obvious ways to increase the 
resolution of the gradiometer is to lower Its resonance frequency u j. 
Lowering the mechanical spring constant while maintaining rigidity along the 
nonsensitive axes is a difficult task. One method of overcoming this dilemma 
for a superconducting gradiometer has been previously demonstrated.^ This 
method uses a superconducting negative spring to counteract the positive 

-195- 



mechanical spring. Each negative spring consists of a disk with a semi- 
circular edge located In a solenoid with a length less than the thickness of 
the disk. The proof mass Is shaped to contain several of these "disks" (see 
Fig. 2). The negative spring constant can be adjusted by changing the per- 
sistent current 1^ In the solenoid. The lower limit for the resonance fre- 
quency will be determined by a number of factors. These factors Include the 
required bandwidth of the gradlometer, the 1/f noise of the SQUID amplifier, 
and the magnitude of the higher order terms in the spring constant. 

When two large spring constants are balanced to obtain a low frequency 
spring, the stability and linearity requirements for each of these springs can 
become much more Important. In the present design, the stability of the 
spring constants is maintained by a number of beneficial features which are 
available at liquid helium temperatures. These features Include the stability 
of materials, the stability of persistent currents in superconducting loops, 
and the stable temperature environment. The linearity requirement is substan- 
tially decreased by the common-mode rejection colls which confine the motions 
of the proof masses. Also, if necessary, the stability and linearity of the 
system can be further enhanced by standard feedback techniques. 

To estimate the negative spring constant (see Fig. 3), we approximate 
that the field between the solenoid and the superconducting surface is cons- 
tant for a given displacement. Then, the change in the magnetic field energy 
with displacement is due to a change in the effective volume of the solenoid. 
The volume as a function of displacement x is 

V(x) = y TtD [L(dQ + R) - R^e] = Vq - I" TtDR^e, (23) 



where

- 1180 N m~^. 

V. A PRACTICAL DESIGN 

If the effect of the resonance frequency is excluded, the determining 
quantities for the Brownlan motion and amplifier noise terms of Eq. (22) are 
R(f) and E^(f), respectively. Presently, the most sensitive commercially 



-198- 



available SQUID^^ has an energy resolution of E^(f) = 3 x 10"^^ J Hz"^''^ down 
to 0.1 Hz at which point 1/f noise becomes important. The damping factor of 
the proof mass motion contains contributions from both the mechanical and 
electromagnetic spring constants with the latter generally dominating for 
large coupling between the electrical and mechanical systems. Though dif- 
ficult to obtain, R(f) < 10~ has been observed in the superconducting coils 

12 
of similar design near 1 kHz. For the purpose of our sensitivity calcula- 

tion, we assume that R(f) = 10 can be achieved at low frequencies (f < 1 

Hz). 

With the above values in mind, and keeping with the objectives stated in 
the introduction, we propose the following parameters for a practical design: 
a differential-mode resonance frequency of 1.6 Hz, a baseline of 0.11 m, and a 
hollow niobium (Nb) proof mass 0.038 m in diameter by 0.029 m long with a mass 
of 0.1 kg. This design would give a sensitivity of 2 x 10"-^ E nz~^^^. The 
dimensions can be reduced further if the sensitivity goal is set at a more 
moderate level of 0.1 E Hz~^/^. 

For the common-mode rejection (CMR) coils and negative spring coils, the 
primary limitation is the critical field of the proof mass material. For 
Stanford grade niobium at 4.2 K, the critical field is 0.12 Wb ra"^.^"' A 
second limitation is the minimum spacing between the superconducting coils and 
the surface of the proof mass. These coils have been made in the past with 
niobium wire. With a wire coil, the minimum spacing is about 1 x 10 m. One 
should be able to reduce this value substantially using thin-film coils. 

For the CMR coils, the field value at the surface of the proof mass 
should be kept approximately 10% below the critical field value. This pre- 
caution would allow the gradiometer to withstand a common-mode acceleration of 
up to twice the earth's gravity without the field exceeding the critical value 

-199- 



and trapping flux in the superconductors. In order to maintain the correct 
spacing between the proof mass and the coils, two CMR circuits (containing 

persistent currents Ij,jq and Ic20» respectively) with one coil on each side of 

2 
each proof mass are necessary (see Fig. 2). For vertical orientation, I^^q « 

0.8 I 20 to compensate for the earth's gravitational field. Then, with 
HQnI^,^Q = 0.10 Wb m~^, Uq^^cZO " °'^^ ^ ™~^» d = 1 x 10"^ m and A == 
1.1 X 10"-^ m^, and with Eqs. (17) and (7), the common-mode resonance frequency 
is 230 Hz. With this increased stiffness, Eqs. (19) and (21) imply that a 
total CMRR (common-mode rejection ratio) of 1 x 10^ is achievable, if the 
gradioraeter is balanced to two parts in 10 . 

For the negative spring coils, the field strength can be near the 
critical value giving nl^ = 0.9 x 10^ A m~^. The expression in Eq. (27) has a 
maximum value of 0.27 at L/(R + d^) = 2//3'. If 12 disks with a diameter of 
3.8 X 10"^ m are used, one obtains k^^ = - 4.3 x 10^ N m~^, which can 
compensate a mechanical resonance frequency of 33 Hz at 4.2 K. By lowering 
the temperature to 1.1 K, the critical field will increase by 25% allowing the 
mechanical resonance and the common-mode frequencies to be increased to 40 Hz 
and 300 Hz, respectively. 



VI. ENVIRGNMENTAL NOISE AND INSTRUMENT ERRORS 

—3 —1/2 
In order to realize an operational sensitivity of 2 x 10 -" E Hz ' with 

a CMRR of 1 X 10^ and a baseline of 0.11 m, a linear acceleration noise level 

better than 2 x 10"^ gg Hz~^'^ is required. The seismic noise level in a 

relatively quiet place is less than 10"^ gg Hz~^'^; consequently, the passive 

CMR will be sufficient for a stationary platform. For a moving base applica- 

tion, however, the platform vibration level can be as high as 10 gg 

Hz"^''^. With this vibration level, a sensitivity of 0.1 E Hz"^'^ would still 

-200- 



be obtainable. This sensitivity would bs sufficient for man" amplications - 
To extend a moving base system to 10"-' E Ez'^'^, the platform vibrations would 
have to be monitored to a level of 10"^ gg Hz~^'^ to compensate the common- 
mode errors of the gradlometer. A vector measurement of the platform 
acceleration with this resolution could be made by using a triad of conven- 
tional accelerometers. Alternatively, in a three-axis gradlometer, an addi- 
tional SQUID could be coupled to the CMR circuit of each component gradlometer 
to obtain a simultaneous reading of the three linear acceleration components 
of the gradlometer. 

With the common-mode error removed, the second most Important error 
source is the angular motion of the gradlometer with respect to an inertlal 
frame. Angular motion about an axis other than its own sensitive axis pro- 
duces err'^'" •'■•'t"'^^'' ck-^ran ^n a narfanl-Tv a^^c^noH aTra/fi nmctfr fViT"r>iicrh f"h<a 

centrifugal acceleration, which is indistinguishable from an in-line component 

gravity gradient. In order to suppress this error to a level of 2 x 10"^ E 

-1/2 
Hz ' , for a vertical or horizontal orientation, the attitude rate of the 

gradlometer must be known or controlled to 1.4 x 10~" rad s~ Hz" '^. For 0.1 

E Hz~^'^, this value becomes 7 x 10~° rad s"'- Hz~^'^. The requirement for the 

-1/2 
0,1 E Hz instrument could be met with conventional gyroscopes mounted to 

the platform. The measurement of the attitude rate at the level of 10 rad 

-1 -1/2 
s Hz may be difficult for a conventional gyroscope. A superconducting 

"six-axis" accelerometer, which measures three linear and three angular 
acceleration components simultaneously with high sensitivity is under develop- 
ment and could be used for this purpose. 

Up to this point, this paper has dealt with a gravity gradlometer in 
which the sensitive axes of the component accelerometers are perfectly 
aligned. In a gradlometer whose sensitive axes are misaligned, linear and 

-201- 



angular motion will generate additional errors in the gradiometer output. 
Linear motion orthogonal to the direction along which a single-axis gradio- 
meter is balanced would couple directly to the gradiometer output at a level 
proportional to the degree of misalignment. Angular motion can couple in 
through axis misalignment in one of two ways. First, in the earth's field, an 
angular displacement will result in a change in the dc bias level for the two 
acceleroraeters . When the two sensitive axes are misaligned with respect to 
each other, the change in the bias level will be different for the two 
accelerometers. Second, the misalignment of the average sensitive axis with 
respect to the baseline will result in a direct coupling of angular accelera- 
tion to the gradiometer output. We summarize below the error model associated 
with these misalignments. 

Tlie gradiometer axis alignment errors can be described in terras of a 
misalignment between the sensitive axes of the component accelerometers : 



6n_ = n2 - n. , (29) 



and a misalignment between the average direction of the sensitive axis and the 
direction of the base line: 



6n . = y (n + n ) - 1 . (30) 



In these equations, n, and n» are the unit vectors in the direction of the 
sensitive axes of the two component accelerometers and Z is the unit vector in 
the direction of the baseline. In addition to causing a gradiometer orienta- 
tion error, these alignment errors cause coupling to the gravity gradient out- 
put from the common-mode acceleration component along the 5n_ direction and 

-202- 



from the angular acceleration component along the 6n ^ x n direction. 

+1 
In a terrestrial environment, a common-mode acceleration along the 6n 

direction is generated not only by linear motions, but also by angular motions 

which modulate the earth's gravity field g . The error terra along the 6n_ 

direction is then given by 

6r. (f) =|6n . [g_ X ^^(f ) +1 (f)] , (31) 

n 

where 9 (f) is the angular displacement noise and a (f) is the linear 
n n 

acceleration noise. The error terra along the n ^ x n direction is given by

where « (f) is the angular acceleration noise. A detailed derivation of Eqs. 
(31) and (32) will be published elsewhere. 

Using ordinary raachining techniques and taking care to relieve stress in 

the mechanical components, the alignment errors 6n_ and 6n ^ can be reduced to 

-4 ^^ 

the level of 10 . One possible method of improving the raechanical alignment 

is through the use of piezoelectric crystals. In such a systera, a set of 
three or four piezoelectric crystal stacks would be used to adjust the rela- 
tive angle of the sensitive axes of the two accelerometers in a single-axis 
gradiometer. An alignment of one part in 10 for both 6n_ and 6n ^ appears 
feasible by using this raethod. 

A second method for reducing the alignment error 6n requires a three- 
axis gradiometer. In this method, additional superconducting circuits which 
are sensitive to the common-raode components of the acceleration along two axes 
are coupled to the proof masses of the third "orthogonal" axis. By adjusting 



-203- 



the persistent currents in these circuits, in a manner similar to the one- 
dlraensional balance discussed in Sections II and III, the residual coupling 
between common-mode accelerations and the gravity gradient outputs due to axis 
misalignment is balanced out. Thus a rigorous three-dimensional balance i 
against sensitivity to linear accelerations is obtained. However, the angular 
acceleration error caused by the misalignment 6n ^ must be compensated for 
separately. 

Equations (31) and (32) determine the requirements for the attitude and 
attitude acceleration control/knowledge for a gravity gradlometer with a given 
sensitivity. In order to achieve 2 x 10"^ E Hz"^/^, 9^(f) and ajj(f) must be 
controlled or known to 2 x 10"^ rad Hz"^/^ and 2 x 10"^ rad s"^ Hz"^/^, re- 
spectively, if 6n_ and 6n ^ can be reduced to the level of 10"^. For 0.1 E 
Hz~^'^, these requirements become 10"^ rad Hz~^/^ and 10"^ rad s~^ Hz"^/^, re- 
spectively. Conventional gyroscopes could be used to satisfy these require- 
ments. If the alignment errors cannot be reduced sufficiently below 10~^, the 
gradiometer may be integrated with the superconducting six-axis accelerometer, 
which will have orders of magnitude improvement in attitude resolution over 
the conventional gyroscopes. 

We are also investigating a "pendulum suspension" ^*^ for the gravity 
gradlometer. If properly designed, a pendulum suspension can provide isola- 
tion in the three angular and two of the three linear degrees of freedom. 
Since the gradiometer can be balanced in the remaining linear degree of 
freedom, rejection of acceleration noise in all six degrees of freedom is 
achieved. Details of the pendulum isolation will be presented in a forth- 
coming paper. 

The extreme sensitivity of the gravity gradiometer requires careful iso- 
lation of the device from the thermal and electromagnetic fluctuations of the 

-204- 



environment as well. Below the lamda point (T^ = 2.17 K) , the liquid helium 
provides a stable and a gradient-free thermal environment. Also, the sensi- 
tivity of the instrument to temperature drift can be tuned out by employing a 
method similar to the common-mode acceleration rejection technique discussed 
in Section II." The superconductor itself is a nearly perfect shield against 
fluctuating magnetic and electric fields. Thus, the superconducting gravity 
gradiometer can be isolated very effectively from the thermal and electro- 
magnetic noise, leaving the mechanical noise mechanisms discussed above as the 
most important error sources. 

VII. CGNCIiJSIONS 

The necessity of operating a very sensitive gravity gradiometer in an 
environment with a large common-mode acceleration background requires extreme 
stability in the acceleration-to-current transfer functions of component 
accelerometers and a reliable means of balancing out the common-mode sensiti- 
vity. The perfect stability of quantized magnetic flux in superconductors can 
be used to obtain a very sensitive gravity gradiometer with a high CMRR. Com- 
bining experiences obtained with a prototype superconducting gravity gradio- 
meter and new technological innovations, we have produced a design which gives 
a sensitivity of 2 x 10"^ E Hz~^'^ and a CMR in excess of 1 x 10^. A three- 
axis in-line component gravity gradiometer, which incorporates many of the 
features discussed in this paper, is under construction for space applica- 
tions. This instrument has been designed for a relatively quiet environment 
and has been scaled up slightly to deliver a sensitivity of 10 E Hz~^'^ 

The new design utilizes magnetic levitation of the proof masses to null 
out the gravity bias, permitting operation of the instrument in an arbitrary 
orientation on the earth and in space. The low temperature environment gives 

-205- 



an opportunity to isolate the instrument from thermal aad electromagnetic 
fluctuations in the survey vehicle. The inherent sensitivity of all gravity 
gradiometers to angular motion induced errors makes the attitude control of 
the gradiometer platform a challenge. However, superconducting techniques can 
again be employed to monitor the linear and angular motions of the platform 
with sufficiently high sensitivity and stability. The feedback and error com- 
pensation techniques which have been developed for conventional inertial 
navigation systems and gravity gradiometers could be adapted to the cryogenic 
instruments discussed here.

16. ABSTRACT 

A sensitive and stable gravity gradiometer would provide high resolution 
gravity measurements from space. The instrument could also provide 
precision tests of fundamental laws of physics and be applied to inertia 
guidance systems of the future. This report describes research on the 
superconducting gravity gradiometer program at the University of Marylan 
from July 1980 to July 1985. The report describes the theoretical and 
experimental work on a prototype superconducting gravity gradiometer. 
The design of an advanced three-axis superconducting gravity gradiometer 
is also discussed.
