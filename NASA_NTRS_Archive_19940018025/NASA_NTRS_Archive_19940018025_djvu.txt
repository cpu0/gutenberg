\ Tiny Tim is a program which simulates Hubble Space Telescope imaging camera PSFs. It is 

portable (written and distributed in C) and is reasonably fas t. It can model the WFPC, WFPC 
II, FOC, and COSTAR corrected FOC cameras. In addition to aberrations such as defocus and 
spherical, it also includes WFPC obscuration shifting, mirror zonal error maps, and jitter. The 
program has been used at a number of sites for deconvolving HST images. Tiny Tim is available 
via anonymous ftp on stsci.edu in the directory software/tinytim.
