1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: A, 
F, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class to 
which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B and 
class L tests are expected to pro^ce errors at compile time and linx time, 
respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result when they are 
executed. rhree Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, and the 
procedure CHECK_FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT also 
provides a set of identity functions used to defeat some canpiler 
optimizations allowed by' the Ada standard that would circusr.'ent a test 
objective. The package SPPBTiS is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The proc^ure CHECK FILE is used to check the contents of text 
files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT arxi CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not opeTating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class B 
tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that All violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Soae of the class B tests contain legal 7«ia 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

i 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects violation of 
the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately conpiled units. Errors are 
expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values — for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provid^ in Appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and 
implementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this implementation are described in section 2.3.

INTRODUCTION 


V 


For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by the AVF, 
This customization consists of making the modifications described in the 
preceding paragraph, removing withdravm tests (see section 2.1), eind possibly 
removing some inapplicable tests (see section 2.2 and IUG891). 

In order to pass an ACVC 201 Ada ^mentation must process each test of the 
customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are irrelevant 
for a given Ada implementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may be 
supported by documents issued by the ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and commonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Commentaries are included as 
appropriate. 




IMPLEMENTATICW DEPENDENCIES 


The follwing 201 tests have floating-point type declarations requiring 
more digits than SYSTEM.MAX_DIGITS: 


C24113L..Y’ (14 tests)

C35713C, B86001U, and C86006G check for tlie predefined type LONG_FLQAT; 

for this iiiplementation, there is no such type. 


C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with a 
name otlier than FLOAT, LC*4G_FLQAT, or SHORT^FLQAT; for this 
inplementation, there is no such type. 

A35801E checks that FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST may be used as a range 
constraint in a floating-point type declaration; for this 
implementation, that rzinge exceeds the range of safe numbers of the 
largest predefined floating-point type and must be rejected. (See 
section 2.3.) 


C45531M..P cind C45532M,.P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations for 
types that requi *"6 a SYSTEM. MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or greater; for this 
implementation, MaX MANTISSA is less than 47. 

C45624A..B (2 tests) check that the proper exception is raised if 
MACHINE_OVERFLCWS is FALSE for floating point types aiid the results of 
various floating-point operations lie outside the range of the base 
type; for this implementation, MACHINEJCVERFLCWS is TRUE. 

B8600iy uses the name of a predefined fixed-point type other than type 
DURATION; for tliis implementation, there is no such type. 

C96005B uses values of typ)e DURATION'S base type that are outside the 
range of type DURATICW; for this implementation, the ranges are the 
same. 

CD1009C checks whether a length clause can specify a non-default size 
for a floating-point type; this inplementation does not support such 
sizes.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), £ind CD2A840 use length clauses 
to specify non-default sizes for access types; this implementation does 
not support such sizes. 

The tests listed in the following table check that USE ERROR ic raised 
if the given file operations are not supported for the given combination 
of mode and access method; this implementation supports these 
operations.

IMPLEMENTATICR^ DEPENDENCIES 


# 2.3 TEST MODIFICATIC^IS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 21 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
implementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the way 
expected by the original tests. 

B24009A B33301B B38003A B38003B B38009A B38009B 
B85008G B85008H BC1303F BC3005B BD2B03A BD2D03A 
BD4003A 

A35B01E was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by the 
AVO. The compiler rejects the use of the range FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST as 
tJie reinge constraint of a floating-point type declaration because the bounds 
lie outside of the range of safe numbers (cf. LRM 3.5.7:12). 

CD1009A, CD1009I, CD1C03A, and CD2A3iA. .C were graded passed loy Evaluation 
Modification as directed by the AVO. These tests use instantiations of the 
support procedure LENGTH CHECK, which uses Unchec)ced_Conversion according to 
the interpretation given Tn AI-00590. The AVO ruled that this interpretation 
is not binding under ACTVC 1.11; the tests are ruled to be passed if they 
produce Failed messages only from the instances of LENGTH_CHECK—i.e, the 
allowed Report.Failed messages have the general form; 

" * CHECK ON REPRESENTATION FOR <'m>E_ID> FAILED." 

AD9001B was graded fiassed by Test Modification as directed l^y the AVO. This 
test chec)cs that no bodies are required for interfaced subprograms; among the 
procedures that it uses is one with a parameter of mode 0?JT (line 36). This 
inplemenation does not support pragma INTERFACE for procedures with 
parameters of mode OUT. The test was minified by commenting out line 36 and 
40; the modified test was passed.

Testing of this Ada implementation was conducted at the customer's site by a 
validation team from the AVF, 


3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the custoirlzed test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming Language 
Standard, whether the test is applicable or inapplicable; otherwise, the Ada 
Implementation fails the ACVC [Pro92]. ' 

For all processed tests (inapplicable eind applicable), a result v;as obtained 
tliat conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard. 

The list of items below gives the number of ACVC tests in various categories. 
All tests were processed, except those that were withdrawn because of test 
errors (item b; see section 2.1), those that require a floating-point 
precision that exceeds the inplementation's maximum precision (item e; see 
section 2.2), and those that depend on the support of a file system — if 
none is supported (item d). All tests passed, except those that are listed 
in sections 2.1 and 2.2 (counted in items b and f, below).

3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) v;as 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were loaded onto a Sun SPARCcenter 2000 and then copied to the 
host computer system. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host con^ter, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 

The tests were compiled and linked on the host computer system. The 
executable iinages v.'ere then downloaded via a serial port to the target board 
and then executed. The results were captured on the host computer system via 
serial port. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the customer and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a complete listing of 
the processing options for this implementation. It also indicates the 
default options. The options invoked explicitly for validation testing 
during this test were; 

Option/Switch Effect 

-w Suppress warning diagnostics. 


Test output, compiler and linker listings, and job logs were captured on 
magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings exAmined cn-site by the 
validation team were also archived.

COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


ada Coonand Reference ada 

ada - invoke the Ada compiler 

Syntax 

ada (options) (source_filel.,. (object_file.o)— 

Arguments 

object_file.o non-Ada object file names. These files will be passed 
on to the linker and will be linked with the specified 
Ada object files. 

options options to the compiler. These are: 

-A (disassemble) Disassemble the units in the source file after 
compiling them. -A can be followed by arguments that further 
define the disassembly display (e.g., -Aa, -Ab, -Ad, -Af, 

-Al, -As). 

a Add hexadecimal display of instruction bytes to 
disassembly listing, 
b Disassemble the unit body (default), 
d Print the data section (if present) as well, 
f Use the alternative format for output. 

1 Put the disassembly output in file "filejnaroe.das'’ 
s Disassemble the unit spec. 

-a file name 

(arrive) Treat file name as an object archive file created 
by ar. Since some arBiive files end with .a, -a is used to 
distinguish archive files from Ada source files. 

-Bstatic/dynarftic (SPARCoinpiler Ada only) 

(static) If static is indicated, the Ada program is compiled 
linked statically. The default is dynamic. 

-c suppress the control messages generated when pragma PAGE 
and/or pragma LIST are encountered. * 

-D identifier type value 

(define) Define an identifier of a specified type and value. 


-DAl.O 

-DAl.l 

-DA2.0 

(architecture) Specify the architecture version tlie compiler 
should generate code for. These options override the ARCHITECTURE 
INFO directive [Default; -DAl.l) (HP PA-RISC only) 


-d (dependencies) Analyze for dependencies only. Do not do 





CX}HP1IATICN SYSTEM OPTIONS 


semantic analysis or code genetution. Update the library, 
marking any defined units as uncompiled. The -d option is 
used by a.make to est 2 dDlish dependencies among new files. 
This option will attempt to do imports for zmy units 
referenced from outer libraries. This should reduce 
relocation and reduce user disk space usage. 


"E directory 

(error output) Without a directory argument, ada processes 
error messages using a.error and directs a brief message to 
standard output; the raw error messages are left in 
source_file.err. If a directory name is given, the raw error 
output is placed in directory/source_file.err. The fils of 
raw error messages can be used as input to a.error. Only 
one -e or -E option should be used. 

-€ (error) Process conpilation error messages using a.error and 
send it to standard output. Only the source lines containing 
errors are listed. Only one -e or -E option should be used. 

-Eferror_file source_file 

(error) Process source file and place any error messages 
in the file indicated Ey error_file. Note that there is 
no space between the -Ef and error_file. 

-El 

-El directory 

(error listing) Same as the -E option, except that a source 
listing with errors is produced. Note that the source listing is 
directed to standard out while the raw errors are placed in 
source_file.err. 

-el (error listing) Intersperse error messages among source 
lines and direct to standard output. 

-Elferror_file source_file 

(error listing) Same as the -Ef option, except that u’ source 
listing with errors is produced and directed to standard output. 
The raw errors are written to error_file. 

-ev (error vi(l)) process syntax error nessageD using a.error, 
embed them in the source file and call the environment editor 
ERROR EDITOR. If ERROR_EDITOR is defined, the environment 
variaEle ERROR_PATTERN should also be defined. ERROR_PATTERN 
is zm editor search coniiand that locates the first occurrence 
of in the error file. If no editor is specified, vi(l) 

is invoked. 

The value of the environment variable ERROR_TABS, if set, 
is used instead of the default tab settings (8). 

-F (full DIANA) Do not trim the DIANA tree before output to 
net files. To save disk space, the DIANA tree will be 


B-3 



COirilATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


triiwoed so that all pointers to nodes tiiat did not involve 
a subtree that define a symbol t 2 ible will be nulled 
(unless those nodes are part of the body of em inline or 
generic or certain other values needing to be retained for 
the debugging or canpilation information). Itie trimming 
generally removes initial values of variables and all 
statements. 

-G (GVAS) Display suggested values for the MIN_(3VAS_ADDR 
and MWC_GVAS_ADDR INFO directives. 

-K (keep) Keep the intermediate Izmguage (IL) file produced 
by the compiler front end. The IL file will be placed in 
the .objects directory with the file name Ada_source. 

-L library_name 

(library) Operate in VADS library library_name. 

[Default: current working directory] 

-Ifile abbreviation (VADSself only) 

(library search) This is an option passed to the ld(l) 
linker, telling it to search the specified library file. 

(No space between the -1 and the file abbreviation.) 

-M unit name 

(main) Produce an executable program by linking the named 
unit as the main program. unit_name must already be 
coiifiiled. It must be either a parameterless procedure or 
a parameterless function returning an integer. The 
executable program will be named a.out unless overridden 
with the ~o option. 

-K source file 

(mainj Produce an executable program by compiling and 
linking source file. The main unit of the program is 
assumed to be the root name of the file (for foo.a the 
unit is foo). Only one file may be preceded by -M. The 
executable program will be naift^ a,out unless overrividen 
with the -o option. 

-N (no code sharing) Conpile all genetic instantiations 
without sharing code for their bodies. This option 
overrides the SHARE_BC»Y INFO directive and the SHARE_CODE 
or SHARE_BODy pragmas. 

-NX (NX) Link with NX startup code and with the NX archive libraries. 
This option is valid only it the -M option has also been invoked. 

(Sun SPARC -> Paragon only) 


-010-9] 

(optimize) Invoke the code optimizer. An optional digit 
(there is no space before the digit) provides the level of 
optimization. The default is -04. 


B-4 


COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-O full optimization 
-OO no optimization 

-01 copy propagation, consteint folding, removing 
dead variables, subsxaning nvoves between scalar 
variables 

-02 add common subexpression elimination within 
basic blocks 

-03 add global co,.inon subexpression elimination 
-04 add hoisting invariants from loops and address 
optimizations 

-05 add range optimizations, instruction scheduling 
amd one pass of reducing induction expressions 
-06 no change 

-07 add one more pass of induction expression reduction 

-06 add one more pass of induction expression reduction 

-09 add one more pass of induction expression 

reduction and add hoisting expressions common to 
the then and the else parts of if statements 

Hoisting from branches (and cases alternatives) cam be slow 
and does not always provide significant performance gains so 
it can be suppressed. 

Note tliat using the -OO option can alleviate some problems when 
debugging. For example, using a higher level of optimization, 
you may receive a message that a varizble is no longer active or 
is not yut active. If you experience these problems, set the 
optimizacion level to 0 using the -OO option. 

-o executable_file 

(output) ?his option is to be used in conjunction with 
the -M option. executahle_file is the name of the executeble 
rather than the default, a.out (self) or a.vox (cross). 

-P Invoke tlie Ada Preprocessor. 

-R VADS_library 

(recompile instamtiation) Force analysis of all generic 
instantiations, causing reinstantiation of any that are out 
of date. YADS library is the library in which the 
recompilation Ts to occur. If it is not specified, the 
recompilation occurs in the current working directory. 

-r (recreate) Recreate the library's gvaS_TABLE file. This option 
reinitializes the file and exits. This allows recovery from 
"GVAS exhausted" without reconpiling all the files in the library. 

-S (suppress) i^ply pragma SUPPRESS to the entire compilation 
for all suppressible checks. 

-sh (show) Display the name of the tool executable but do not 
execute it, 

-T (timing) Print timing information for the compilation. 


B-5 



COMPIIATIOJ SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-tcb 

(trace block) Generate code to trace entry into basic blocks and 
calls and returns (for use witli a.trace only) 

-V (verbose) Print compiler version number, date and time of 
compilation, name of file compiled, command input line, 
total compilation time and error sunmary line. Storage usage 
information about the object file is provided. 

-w (warnings) Suppress warning diagnostics. 

source_file name of the source file to be compiled. 

Description 

The ada command executes the Ada compiler and compiles the named A^la 
source file. The file must reside in a VADS library directory. The 
ada.lib file in this directory is modified after each Ada unit is 
compiled. 

By default, ada produces only object amd net files. If the -M option 
is used, the compiler automatically invokes a.Id and builds a complete 
program with the named library unit as the main progreun. 

For cross systems, the conpiler generates object files compatible with 
the host linker in VOX format. The VOX format is discussed in 
;^pe:idix A of the Programmer's Guide. 

Non-Ada object files (.o files produced by a compiler for euiother 
language) may be given as arguments to ada. These files will be passed 
on to the linker and will be linked with the specified Ada object files. 

Command line options may be specified in any ordv“r but the order of 
conpilation and the order of the files to be passed to the linker can 
be significant. 

Several VADS conpilers n«y be simultaneously available on a single 
system. Because the ada command in any VADS_location/bin on a system 
will execute the correct compiler components based upon visible 
library directives, the option -sh is provided to print the name of 
the components actually executed. ^ 

Program listings with a disassembly of machine code instructions 
are generated by a.db or a.das. 

NOTE: If two files of the same name from different directories are 
compiled in the same ada library using the -L option (even if the 
contents ana unit names are different), the second compilation will 
overwrite the first. For exanple, the coitpilation of 
/usr/directory2/foo.a -L ziisr/Vads/test will overwrite the 
compilation of Aisr/directoryl/foo.a -L /usr/vads/test in the 
VADS library /usr/vads/test. 


B-6 






COWPILATIO^ SYSTEM OPTICS'^S 


NOTE: It is possible to specify the directory for temporary files by 
setting the environment variable TMPDIR to the desired path. If TEMPDIR 
is not set, /tmp is used. If tlie path specified by TMPDIR does not exist 
or is not writeable, the program exits with an error message to that effect. 

Diagnostics 

The diagnostics produced by the VADS compiler are intended to be 
self-explanatory. Most refer to the RM. Each RM reference includes a 
section number and optionally, a paragraph number enclosed in 
parentheses.

If unit_name is a function, it must return a value of the 
type STANDARD.INTEGER. This integer result will be passed back 
to the shell as the status code of the execution. 

Description 

a.Id collects the object files needed to nake unit_naine a min 
progrcuti and calls the ld(l) lirher to link together all Ada and 
other Icinguage objects requited to produce an executable image in 
a.out (self) or a.vox (cross). The utility uses the net files produced 
by the Ada conpiler to check dependency information, a'.Id produces 
an exception mapping table auid a unit elaboration table and passes 
this information to the linker. The elaboration list generated by 
a.Id v/il] not include library level packages that do not need 
elaboration. Siniilarly, j;)ackages that contain no code that can raise 
em exception will no longer have exception tables. 

a.Id reads instructions for generating executables from the ada.lib 
file in the VADS libraries on the search list. Besides information 
generated by the compiler, these directives also include WITHn 
directives that allow the automatic linking of o):)ject modules 
compiled from other languages or Ada object modules not named 
in context clauses in tiie Ma source. Any number of WITlln 


B~9 



CCS1PILATI0N SYSTEM OPTIONS 


directives may be placed into a library but they must be 
numbered contiguously beginning at WlTHl. The directives are 
recorded in the library's ada-lib file and have the following fonti. 

WITHl;LINK:object_file: 

WITH2;LINK:archive_file: 

WITHn directives may be placed in the local Ada libraries or in 
any VADS library on the search list. 

A WITHn directive in a local VADS library or earlier on the 
library search list will hide the same numbered WITHn directive 
in a library later in the library search list. 

Use the tool a.info to change or report library directives in 
the current library. 

For VADSself on Silicon Graphics Computer Systems, the 
USE_LAST_LINK INFO directive speeds relinking by retaining a list 
of units, theTr types, seals eind dependencies. 

VADS_location/bin/a.Id is a wrapper program that executes the 
correct executable based upon directives visible in the ada.lib 
file. This permits multiple VADS compilers to exist on the same 
host. The -sh option prints the namve of the actual executable file. 

NOTE: It is possible to specify the directory for temporary files by 
setting the euvironment variable TKPDIR to the desired path. If TMPDIR 
is not set, /tmp is used. If the path specified by TMPDIR does not exist 
or is not writeable, the program exits with an error message to that effect.

APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDAHD 


APPENDIX F. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


1. Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 

1.1. INITIALIZE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers STATIC or DYNAMIC as the single 
argument. This pragma is only allowed within a library- 
level package spec or body. It specifies tliat all objects 
in the package be initialized as requested by the pragma 
(i.e, statically or dynamically). Only library-level 
objects are subject to static initialization{ all objects 
within procedures are always (by definition) dyneimic. If 
pragma INITIALIZE(STATIC) is used, and an object cannot be 
initialized statically, code will be generated to initialize 
the object and a warning message will be generated. 

1.2. I1'IL1NE_C»:ly Pragma 

The Il'fLiNE_ONbr pragma, wrieu used in the same way as pragma 
INLINE, indicates to the compiler that the subprogram must 
always be inlined. This pragma also suppresses the genera¬ 
tion of a callable version of the routine which saves code 
space. If a user erroneously makes an INLINE_ONLY subpro¬ 
gram recursive a warning message will be emitted and an 
PROGRAM_ERROR will be rais^ at run time. 

1.3. BUILT_IN Pragma 

The BUILT IN pragma is used in the implementation of some 
predefined Ada packages, but provides no user access. It is' 
used only to implement code b^ies for \diich no actual Ada' 
body can be provided, for example the MACHINE_C0DE package. 

1.4. SHARE_CODE Pragma i 

The SHARE_CODE pragma takes the name of a generic instantia¬ 
tion or a generic unit as the first argmrent emd cne of the 
identifiers TRUE or FALSE as the second argument. This 
pragma is only allowed imnediately at the place of a 
declarative item in a declarative part or package specifica¬ 
tion, or after a library unit in a compilation, bat before 
any subsequent cortpilation unit. 

When the first argument is a generic vmit the pragma applies 
to all insteuitiations of that generic. When the first argu-

merit is the name of a generic instantiation tiie pragma 
applies only to the specified instantiation, or overloaded 
instantiations. 

If the second argxnnent is TRUE the compiler will try to 
share code generated for a generic instantiation with code 
generated for other insteintiations of the same generic, 
^en the second argument is FALSE each instantiation will 
get a unique copy of the generated code. The extent to 
^ich code is shared between instantiations depends on this 
pragma and the kind of generic formal parameters declared 
for the generic unit. 

The naire pragma SHARE_BODY is also recognized by the inple- 
mentation and has the same effect as SHARE_CODE. It is 
included for compatedDility with earlier versions of VADS. 

1.5. NO_IHAGE Pragma 

The pragma suppresses the generation of the image array used 
for the IMAGE attribute of enumeration types. This elim¬ 
inates the overhead required to store the array in the exe¬ 
cutable image. An attempt to use the IMAGE attribute on a 
type vhose image array has been suppressed will result in a 
compilation warning and PROGRAM_ERROR raised at run time. 

1.6. EXTERNAL NAME Pragma 

The EXTERNAL NAME pragma takes the name of a subprogram or 
variable defined in Ada and allows the user to specify a 
different external name that may be used to reference the 
entity from other languages. The pragma is allowed at the 
place of a declarative item in a package specification and 
must apply to an object declared earlier in the same package 
specification. 

1.7. 1NTERFACE_NAME P ragma 

The INTERFACE_NAME pragma takes the name of a a variable or 
subprogram defined in anotlier language and allows it to be 
referenced directly in Ada. The pragma will replace all 
occurrences of the variJible or subprograni name witii an 
external reference to tlie second, link_argument. The pragma 
is allowed at the place of a declarative item in a package 
specification amd must apply to an object or subprogram 
declared earlier in the same package specification. The 
object must be declared as a scalar or an access type. The 
object cannot be any of the following: 
a loop variable, 
a constant, 

an initialized variable, 
an array, or 
a record.

APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


1.8. 1MPLICIT_C0DE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers W or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies that implicit code generated by the 
compiler be allowed or disallowed. A warning is issued if 
OFF is used zmd any implicit code needs to be generated. 
The default is W. 


1.9. 0PTIMI2E_C0DE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers CXJ or OFF as tlie single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies whether the code should be optim¬ 
ized by the compiler. The default is ON. When OFF is 
specified, the compiler will generate the code as specified. 

2. Implementation of Predefined Pragmas 

2.1. CONTROLLED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 

^.2. ELABORATE 

This pragma is inplemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.3. INLINE 

This pragiTBi is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.4. IN'IERFACE 

This pragma supports calls to 'C' and FORTRAN functions. The' 
Ada subprograms can be either functions or procedures. The 
types of parameters and the result type for functions )TOa5t 
be scalar, access or the predefined type ADDRESS in SYDTEM. 
All parameters must have mi^e IN. Record and array objects 
can be passed by reference using the ADDRESS attribute. 

2.5. LIST 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada PM. 

2.6. MEMORY_SIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The iitple- 


C-4 




APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.7. Na4_REENTRANT 

This pragma takes one argument which ceui be the name of 
either a library subprogram or a subprogram declared iranedi- 
ately within a library package spec or body. It indicates 
to the compiler that the subprogram will not be called 
recursively allowing the compiler to perform specific optim¬ 
izations. The pragma can be applied to a subprogram or a 
set of overloaded subprograsm within a package spec or pack¬ 
age body. 

2.8. NOT_ELABORATED 

This pragma can only appear in a library package specifica¬ 
tion. It indicates that the package will not be elaborated 
because it is either part of the RTS, a configuration pack¬ 
age or an Ada package that is referenced from a lemguage 
other than Ada. The presence of this pragma suppresses the 
generation of elaboration code and issues warnings if ela¬ 
boration code is required. 

2.9. OPTIMIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 


2.10. PACK 

5 pragma will cause the compiler to choose a non-aligned 
' :esentation for composite types. It will not causes 
t jcts to be packed at the bit level. 

2.1.1. PAGE 

This ragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the- 
Ada F -. 

2.1. PASSIVE 

The pragma has three forms ; 

PRAOIA PASSIVE; 

PRAOIA PASSIVE(SEMAPHORE); 

PRAOIA PASSIVE (INTERRUPT', < number >); 


This pragvt\a Pragma passive can be applied to a task or task 
type declared immediately within a library package spec or 
body. The pragma directs the compiler to optimize certain 
tasking operations. It is possible that the statements in a 


C-5 




APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


task body will prevent the intended optimization, in these 
cases a warning will be generated at compile time and will 
raise TASKING_ERROR at runtime. 

2.13. PRIORITY 

This pragma is inplemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.14. SHARED 

This pragma is recognized by the iitplementation but has no 
effect. 

2.15. STORAGEJJNIT 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.16. SUPPRESS 

This pragma is implemented as described, except that 
DIVISION CHECK and in some cases Cf\/ERFLCW_CHECK cannot be 
supresseH. 

2.17= SYSTEM_NAME 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

3. Implementation-Dependent Attributes 

3.1. P'REF 

For a prefix that denotes an object, a program unit, a 
label, or eui entry: 

This attribute denotes the effective address of the first of 
the storage units allocated to P. For a subprogram, pack¬ 
age, task unit, or ledsel, it refers to the address of' the 
machine code associated with the corresponding body or 
statement. For zm entry for which an address clause has 
been given, it refers to thr corresponding hardware inter¬ 
rupt. The attribute is of the type OPERAND defined in the 
package MACHINE_CODE. The attribute is only allowed within 
a machine code procedure. 

See section F.4.8 for more information on the use of this 
attribute. 

(For a package, task unit, or entry, the 'REF attribute is 


C-6 




APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


not supported.) 


3.2. T'TASKID 

For a task object or a value T, T'TASK_ID yields the unique 
task id associated with a task. The value of this attribute 
is of the type ADDRESS in the package SYSTEM.

5. Restrictions On Representation Clauses 

5.1. Pragma PACK 

in the absence of pragma PACK record components are padded 
so as to provide for efficient access by the target 
hardware, pragma PACK applied to a record eliminate the pad¬ 
ding where possible. Pragma PACK has no other effect on the 
storage allocated for record components a record representa¬ 
tion is required. 

5.2. Size Clauses 

For scalar types a representation clause will pack to tiie 
number of bits required to represent the remge of the sub- 
type. A size clause applied to a record type will not cause 
packing of components; an explicit record representation 


C-9 


appendix F of the Ada STANDARD 


clause must be given to specify the packing of the com¬ 
ponents. A size clause applied to a record type will cause 
packing of components only when the component type is a 
discrete type. An error will be issued if there is insuffi¬ 
cient space allocated. The SIZE attribute is not supported 
for task, access, or floating point types. 


5.3. Address Clauses 

Address clauses are only supported for variables. Since 
default initialization of a variable requires evaluation of 
the variable address elaboration ordering requirements 
prohibit inititalization of a variediles which have address 
clauses. The specified address indicates the physical 
address associated with the variable. 

5.4. Interrupts 

Interrupt entries ate supported with the following interpre¬ 
tation and restrictions: 

An interrupt entry may not have any parameters. 

A passive task that contains one or more interrupt entries 
must always be trying to accept each interrupt entry, unless 
It is handling trie inLerrupt. The task mast be executing 
either an accept for the entry <if there is only one) or a 
select statement where the interrupt entry accept alterna¬ 
tive is open as defined by Ada KM 9.7.1(4). This is not a 
restriction on normal tasks (i.e., signal ISRs). 

An interrupt acts as a conditional entry call in that inter¬ 
rupts are not queued (see the last sentence of Ada RM 
13.5.1(2) and 13.5.1(6)). 

No additional reqiiirements are inposed for a select state¬ 
ment containing both a terminate alternative and an accept' 
alternative for an interrupt entry (see Ada RM 13.5.1(3)). 

Direct calls to cin interrupt entry from euiother task are 
allowed amd are treated as a normal task rendezvous. » 

Interrupts are not queued. 

The address clause for an interrupt entry does not specify 
the priority of the interrupt. It sinply specifies the 
interrupt vector number. For passive ISRs, the nnn of the 
passive(interrupt,nnn) pragma specifies the interrupt prior¬ 
ity of the task. 

5.5. Representation Attributes 


C-10 









• *• 


APPEI'IDIX F OF THE Ada STANTM^D 


The ADDRESS attribute is not supported for the following 
entities: 

Packages 

Tasks 

Labels 

Entries 


5.6. Machine Code Insertions 
Machine code insertions are supported. 

The general definition of the package HACHINE_CODE provides 
an assembly language interface for the target machine. It 
provides the necessary record type(s) needed in the code 
statement, an enumeration t^'pe of all the opcode imeumonics, 
a set of register definitions, and a set of addressing mode 
functions. 

The general syntax of a machine code statement is as fol¬ 
lows: 


CODE_n'( opcode, operand {, operzmd) ); 

where n indicates the nxjmber of operands in the aggregate. 

A special case arises for a variable number of operands. 
The operands are listed within a subaggregate. The format 
is as follows: 

CODE_N'( opcode, (operaurd {, operand}) ); 

For those opcodes that require no operzurds, named notation 
must be used (cf, RM 4.3(4)). 

CODE_0'( op -> opcode ); 

The opcode must be am enumeration literal (i.e. it cannot be' 
an object, attribute, or a rename). 

An operand can only be an entity defined in MACHINE_iX)DEi. or 
the 'REF attribute. 

The arguments to any of the functions defined in 
MACHINE_C0DE must be Static expressions, string literals, or 
the functions defined in MACHINE_CODE. The 'REF attribute 
may not be used as an argument in any of these functions. 

Inline expansion of machine code procedures is supported. 

6. Conventions for inplementation-generated Names 


C-11

> There are no implementation-generated names. 

7. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clauses 

Address expressions in an address clause ate interpreted as 
physical addresses. 

B. Restrictions on Unchecked Conversions 
None. 

9. Restrictions on Unchecked Deallocations 


None. 


10. Implementation Characteristics of I/O Packages 

Insteuitiations of DIRECT_I0 use the value MAX REC_SIZE as 
the record size (expressed in STORRGE_UNITS) ^en the size 
of ELEMENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For example for uncon¬ 
strained arrays such as string where ELEMENT_TYPE'SI2E is 
very large, MAX_REC_SI2E is used instead. MAX_RECORD_SI2E 
is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a ^^rogram before 
instantiating D1RECT_I0 to provide an upper limit on the 
record size. In any case the maximum size supported is 1024 
X 1024 X STOPAGEJJNIT bits. DIRECT_IO will raise USE_ERROR 
if MAX_REC_SIZE exceeds this absolute limit. 

Instantiations of SEQUENTIAL_I0 use the value MAX_REC_SI2E 
as the record size (expressed in STOEAGE_UNITS) when the 
size of ELEMENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For example for 
unconstrained arrays such as string where ELEMENT__TYPE'S1ZE 
is very large, MAX REC_SIZE is used ~ instead. 
MAX_RECORD SIZE is defineH in SYSTEM and can be changed by a 
program beTore instcintiating INTEGER_I0 to provide an upper 
limit on the record size. SBQUENTIAL_I0 imposes no limit on 
MAX_REC_SIZE. 

11, Implementation Limits 

The following limits are actually enforced by the iinp]emen- 
tation. It is not intended to imply that resources up tv or 
even near these limits ate available to every program. 

11.1. Line Length 

The implementation supports a maximum line length of 500 
characters including the end of line character. 

11.2. Record and Array Sizes 

The maximum size of a statically sized array type is 
4,000,000 X STORAGE UNITS. The maximum size of a statically 


C-12 





« 

APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


sized record type is 4,000,000 x STORAGEJUNITS. A record 
type or array type declaration that exceeds these limits 
will generate a warning message. 

11.3. Default Stack Size for Tasks 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGE_SIZE length specifica¬ 
tion every task except the main program is allocated a fixed 
size stack of 10,240 STORAGE UNITS. This is the value 
returned by T'STORAGE_SIZE for a task type T. 

11.4. Default Collection Size 

In the absence of an explicit ST0RAGE_S12E length attribute 
the default collection size for an access type is 100 times 
the size of the designated type. This is the value returned 
by T'STCRAGE_S1ZE for an access type T. 

11.5. Limit on Declared Objects 

There is an absolute limit of 6,000,000 x STORAGEJUNITS for 
objects declared statically within a conpilation unit. If 
this value is exceeded the conoiler will terminate the coith 
pilation of the unit with a FATAL error message.
