CHAPTER 1 


INTRODUCTION 


This Validation Summary Report (VSR) describes the extent to which a 
specific Ada compiler conforms to the Ada Standard, ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A. 

This report explains all technical teinns used within it and thoroughly 
reports the results of testing this compiler using the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability (ACVC). An Ada compiler must be implemented 
according to the Ada Standard, and any implementation-dependent features 
must conform to the requirements of the Ada Standard. The Ada Standard 
must be implemented in its entirety, and nothing can be implemented that 
is not in the Standard. 

Even though all validated Ada compilers conform to the Ada Standard, it 
must be understood that some differences do exist between 
implementations. The Ada Standard permits some implementation 
dependencies--for example, the maximum length of identifiers or the 
maximum values of integer types. Other differences between compilers 
result from the characteristics of particular operating systems, 
hardware, or implementation strategies. All the depen dencies .observed—^ ? 

during the process of testing this compiler are given in this report. 

The information in this report is derived from the test results produced 
during validation testing. The validation process includes submitting a 
suite of standardized tests, the ACVC, as inputs to an Ada compiler and 
evaluating the results. The purpose of validating is to ensure 
conformity of the compiler to the Ada Standard by testing that the 
compiler properly implements legal language constructs and that it 
identifies and rejects illegal language constructs. The testing also 
Identifies behavior that is implementation dependent, but is permitted 
by the Ada Standard. Six classes of tests are used. These tests are 
designed to perform checks at compile time, at link time, and during 
execution.

1.1 PURPOSE OF THIS VALIDATION SUMMARY REPORT 


This VSR documents the results of the validation testing performed on an 
Ada compiler. Testing was carried out for the following purposes: 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs supported by the 
compiler that do not conform to the Ada Standard 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs not supported by 
the compiler but required by the Ada Standard 

. To determine that the implementation-dependent behavior is allowed 
by the Ada Standard 


On-site testing was completed November 30, 1989 at Newport, Rhode 

Island.

Compiler 


Failed test 


Host 


A processor for the Ada language. In the context of 
this report, a compiler Is any language processor, 
Including cross-compilers, translators, and

that demonstrates nonconformity to the Ada Standard. 

The computer on which the cootpller resides.

compiler is not required to support or may legitimately 
support in a way other than the one expected by the 
test. 


Passed test 


An ACVC test for which a compiler generates the expected 
result. 


Target 


Teat 


Withdrawn 


The computer which executes the code generated by the 
compiler. 

A program that checks a compiler's conformity regarding 
a particular feature or a combination of features to the 
Ada Standard. In the context of this report, the term 
Is used to designate a single test, which may comprise 
one or more files. 

An ACVC test found to be Incorrect and not used to check 
test conformity to the Ada Standard. A test may be 
Incorrect because It has an Invalid test objective, 
falls to meet Its test objective, or contains Illegal or 
erroneous use of the language. 


1.5 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conformity to the Ada Standard Is measured using the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains both legal and Illegal Ada programs structured Into six test 
classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name 
Identifies the class to which It belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests 
are executable, and special program units are- used to report their 
results during execution. Class B tests are expected to produce 
compilation errors. Class L tests are expected to produce errors 
becavise of the way In which a program library Is used at link time. 

Class A tests ensure the successful compilation and execution of legal 
Ada programs with certain language constructs which cannot be verified 
at run time. There are no explicit program components In a Class A test 
to check semantics. For example, a Class A test checks that reserved 
words of another language (other than those already reserved In the Ada 
language) are not treated as reserved words by an Ada compiler. A Class 


1-4 



A test is passed If no errors are detected at compile time and the 
program executes to produce a PASSED message. 


Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. 

Class B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled 
and the resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that every 
syntax or semantic error in the test is detected. A Class B test is 
passed if every illegal construct that it contains is detected by the 
compiler. 

Class C tests check the run time system to ensure that legal Ada 
programs can be correctly compiled and executed. Each Class C test is 
self-checking and produces a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message 
indicating the result when it is executed. 

Class D tests check the compilation and execution capacities of a 
compiler. Since there are no capacity requirements placed on a compiler 
by the Ada Standard for some parameters--for example, the number of 
identifiers permitted in a compilation or the number of units in a 
library--a compiler may refuse to compile a Class D test and still be a 
conforming compiler. Therefore, if a Class D test falls to compile 
because the capacity of the compiler is exceeded, the test is classified 
as inapplicable. If a Class D test compiles successfully, it is 
self-checking and produces a PASSED or FAILED message during execution. 


Class E tests are expected to execute successfully and check 
implementation-dependent options and resolutions of ambiguities in the 
Ada Standard. Each Class E test is self-checking and produces a NOT 
APPLICABLE, PASSED, or FAILED message when it is compiled and executed. 
However, the Ada Standard permits an implementation to reject programs 
containing some features addressed by Class E tests during compilation. 
Therefore, a Class E test is passed by a compiler if it is compiled 
successfully and executes to produce a PASSED message, or if it is 
rejected by the compiler for an allowable reason. 

Class L tests check that incomplete or illegal Ada programs involving 
multiple, separately compiled units are detected and not allowed to 
execute. Class L tests are compiled separately and execution is 
attempted. A Class L test passes if it is rejected at link time--that 
is, an attempt to execute the main program must generate an error 
message before any declarations in the main progr^ull or any units 
referenced by the main program are elaborated. In some cases, an 
implementation may legitimately detect errors during compilation of the 
test. 

Two library units, the package REPORT and the procedure CHECK_FILE, 
support the self-checking features of the executable tests. The package 
REPORT provides the mechanism by which executable tests report PASSED, 
FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE results. It also provides a set of identity 
functions used to defeat some compiler optimizations allowed by the Ada 
Standard that would circumvent a test objective. The procedure 


1-5 






CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of text files written by some 
of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada Standard. The operation 
of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of executable tests. These 
tests produce messages that are examined to verify that the units are 
operating correctly. If these units are not operating correctly, then 
the validation is not attempted. 

The text of each test in the ACVC follows conventions that are intended 
to ensure that the tests are reasonably portable without modification. 
For example, the tests make use of only the basic set of 55 characters, 
contain lines with a maximum length of 72 characters, use small numeric 
values, and place features that may not be supported by all 
implementations in separate tests. However, some tests contain values 
that require the test to be customized according to 
implementation-specific values--for example, an illegal file name. A 
list of the values used for this validation is provided in Appendix C. 

A compiler must correctly process each of the tests in the suite and 
demonstrate conformity to the Ada Standard by either meeting the pass 
criteria given for the test or by showing that the test is inapplicable 
to the implementation. The applicability of a test to an 
implementation is considered each time the Implementation is validated. 

A test that is inapplicable for one validation is not necessarily 
inapplicable for a subsequent validation. Any test that was determined 
to contain an Illegal language construct or an erroneous language 
construct is withdrawn from the ACVC and, therefore, is not used in 
testing a compiler. The tests withdrawn at the time of this validation 
are given in Appendix D.

2.2 IMPIIMENTATIC3N CHARACrEEHSTICS 


One of the purposes of validating ccnpilers is to detenuLne the behavior 
of a ccnpiler in those areas of the Ada Standard that permit 
inplementations to differ. Class D and E tests specifically check for 
such inplementation differences. However, tests in other classes also 
characterize an inplementation. Ihe tests demonstrate the following 
characteristics: 


a. Capacities. 

(1) Ihe ccnpiler correctly processes a caipilation containing 
723 variables in the same declarative part. (See test 
D29002K.) 

(2) Hie ccnpiler correctly processes tests containing loop 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See tests D55A03A. ,H (8 
tests).) 

(3) Hie catpiler correctly processes tests containing block 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See test 056001B.) 

(4) Hie ccnpiler correctly processes tests containing recursive 
procedures separately ccnpiled as subunits nested to 17 
levels. (See tests D64005E..G (3 tests).) 

b. Predefined types. 

(1) Hiis inplementation sijpports the additional predefined 
t^pes IDNG_INIEGER and nM3_FIDAT in the package STANDARD. 
(See tests B86001T..Z (7 tests).) 


c. Expression evaluation. 

Hie order in viiicli expressions are evaluated and the time at 
vhidi constraints are checked are not defined by the language. 
Vttiile the ACVC tests do not specifically attenpt to determine 
the order of evaluation of expressions, test results indicate 
the following: 

(1) All of the default initialization expressions for record 
ccnponents are evaluated before any value is checked for 
membership in a ocnponent's subtype. (See test C32117A.) 

(2) Assignments for subtypes are performed with the same 
precision as the base type. (See test C35712B.) 

(3) Hiis iiiplementatiCTi uses no extra bits for extra precision 


2-2 





and uses all extra bits for extra range. (See test 
C35903A.) 

(4) NUMERIC_ERKDR is raised for pre-defined integer coiparison 
and for pre-defined integer nanbership. NO EXCEPlTCai is 
raised for leirge_int cartparison or for large_int 
menbership. NUME3?IC_ERE?0R is raised for small_int 
cxmparison and for sniall_int menibership vben an integer 
literal operand in a caiparison or roenibership test is 
outside the range of the base type. (See test C45232A.) 

(5) NUMEE?ICJERKQR is raised when a literal operand in a 
fixed-point caiparison or membership test is outside the 
range of the base type. (See test C45252A.) 

(6) Underflow is not gradual. (See tests C45524A. .E (5 
tests).} 


d. Rounding. 

The method by viiich values are rounded in type conversions is 
not defined by the language. VJhile the ACVC tests do not 
specifically attempt to determine the method of rounding, the 
test results indicate the following: 

(1) The method used for rounding to integer is round away from 
zero. (See tests C46012A..E (5 tests).) 

(2) The method used for rounding to longest integer is round 
away from zero. (See tests C46012A..E (5 tests).) 

(3) The method used for rounding to integer in static universal 
real egressions is round toward zero. (See test C4A014A.) 


e. Array types. 

An implementation is allowed to raise NUMERICJERRDR or 
a»)STRAINT_ERROR for an array having a ’UENGIH that exceeds 
STANDARD. INTEGER'LAST and/or SYSTEM.MAX_INT. For this 
implementation: 

(1) Declaration of an array type or subtype declaration with 
more than SYSTEM.MAX_INr coiponents raises NUMERIC_ERIRQR. 
(See test C36003A.) 

(2) NUMERICJERRCfR is raised vhen '1F2*G?IH is applied to an array 
type with INEEGER'IAST + 2 coiponents. (See test C36202A.) 


(3) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised vhen 'lENGIH is applied to an array 









(See test 


type with SYSrEM.MAX_INT + 2 cxanponents. 

C36202B.) 

(4) A packed BOOIEftN array having a 'lENGflH eia^eeding 
INTEXSER'IAST raises no exc^jtion. (See test C52103X.) 

(5) A packed two-dimensionaLl BOOIIAN eurray with more than 
INTEGER'IAST conponents raises CJ»BTOAINr_EBKDR vAien the 
length of a dimension is ccd.culated and exceeds 
INIEGER'IAST. (See test C52104Y.) 

(6) A null array with one dimension of length greater than 
INIEGER'IAST may raise NUMERIC_ERRDR or OC»ISTRAINT_EREDR 
either when declared or assigned. Alternatively, an 
inplementation may acc^jt the declaration. Ifowever, 
lengths must match in array slice assignments. Ihis 
inplementation reiises no exception. (See test E52103Y.} 

(7) In assigning one-dimensional array types, the e^^iressicai is 
evaluated in its entirety before crNSIRAINr_ERRC3R is raised 
vdien checking vhether the expression's subtype is 
ocppatible with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.} 

(8) In assigning two-dimensional array types, the expression is 
not evaluated in its entirety before OCNSTRAINr_ERRCR is 
raised vhen checking vhether the expression's subtype is 
ocnpatible with the target's subtype. (See test CS2013A.) 

f. Discriminated types. 

(1) In assigning record types with discriininants, the 
expression is evaluated in its entirety before 
OONSTRAINr_ERRCR is raised vhen checking whether the 
expression's subtype is ccppatlble with the target's 
subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


g. Aggregates. 

(1) In the evaluation of a multi-dimensional aggregate, the 

test results indicate that all choices are evaluated tefore 
checking against the ind^ (See tests C43207A and 

C43207B.) 

(2) In the evaluation of an aggregate containing subaggregates, 
2 dl choices are evaluated before being checked for 
identical bcunds. (See test E43212B.) 

(3) All choices were not evaluated before aCNSTRAINr_ERROR is 
raised vhen a bound in a non-null range of a non-null 
aggregate does not -belong to an inc3ex subtype. (See test 
E43211B.} 


2-4 




h. Pragtoas. 


(1) The pragma INITNE is st^^ported for functions or procedures. 
(See tests IA3004A. .B (2 tests), EA3004C. .D (2 tests), and 
CA3004E..F (2 tests).) 

i. Generics. 

(1) Generic specifications and bodies can be ccirpiled in 

s^sarate corcpilations. (See tests CA1012A, CA2009C, 

C3^009F, BC3204C, and BC3205D.)

TEST INFORMATION 


3.1 TEST RESULTS 

Version 1.10 of the ACVC comprises 3717 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, 44 tests had been withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF 
determined that 519 tests were inapplicable to this implementation. All 
inapplicable tests were processed during validation testing except for 
285 executable tests that use floating-point precision exceeding that 
supported by the implementation. Modifications to the code, processing, 
or grading for 37 tests were required to successfully demonstrate the 
test objective. (See section 3.6.) 

The AVF concludes that the testing results demonstrate acceptable 
conformity to the Ada Standard.

3.5 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

Some tests do not apply to all compilers because they make use of 
features that a compiler is not required by the Ada Standard to support. 
Others may depend on the result of another test that is either 
inapplicable or withdrawn. The applicability of a test to an 
implementation is considered each time a validation is attempted. A 
test that is inapplicable for one validation attempt is not necessarily 
inapplicable for a subsequent attempt. For this validation attempt, 519 
tests were inapplicable for the reasons indicated: 

a. The following 285 tests are not applicable because they have 
floating-point type declarations requiring more digits than 
SYSTEM.MAX_DIGITS: 

C24113F..Y (20 tests) C35705F..Y (20 tests) 

C35706F..Y (20 tests) C35707F..Y (20 tests) 

C35708F..Y (20 tests) C35802F..Z (21 tests)

C45621F..Z (21 tests) 
C46012F..Z (21 tests) 


b. C35508I, C3S508J, C3S508M, and C35508N are not applicable because 
they include envuneration representation clauses for BOOLEAN types 
in which the representation values are other than (FALSE -> 0, TRUE 
-> 1). Under the terms of Al-00325, this implementation is not 
required to support such representation clauses. 

c. C35702A and B86001T are not applicable because this implementation 
supports no predefined type SHORT_FL0AT. 

d. The following 16 tests are not applicable because this 

implementation does not support a predefined type SH0RT_INTEGER: 

C45231B C45304B C45502B C45503B C45504B 

C45504E C45611B C45613B C45614B C45631B

e. C45S31M. .P (4 tests), C45532M. .P (4 tests) are not applicable 

because this implementation does not support a 48 bit integer 

machine size. 

f. B86001X, C45231D, and CD7101G (3 tests) are not applicable because 
this Implementation does not support any predefined integer type 
with a name other than INTEGER, LONG_INTEGER. or SHORT_INTEGER. 

g. B86001Z is not applicable because this implementation supports no 

predefined floating-point type with a name other than FLOAT, 

L0NG_FL0AT, or SH0RT_FL0AT. 

h. C86001F is not applicable because, for this implementation, the 
package TEXT_I0 is dependent upon package SYSTEM. This test 
recompiles package SYSTEM, making package TEXT_I0, and hence 
package REPORT, obsolete. 

i. C9600SB is not applicable because there are no values of type 

DURATION'BASE that are outside the range of DURATION. 

j. CD1009C, CD2A41A, CD2A41B, CD2A41E, CD2A42A, CD2A42B, CD2A42C, 

CD2A42D, CD2A42E, CD2A42F, CD2A42G, CD2A42H, CD2A42I, CD2A42J (14 
tests) are not applicable because this implementation does not 
support 'SIZE representations for floating-point types.

3.6 TEST, PROCESSING, AND EVALUATION MODIFICATIONS 

It is expected that some tests will require modifications of code, 
processing, or evaluation in order to compensate for legitimate 
implementation behavior. Modifications are made by the AVF in cases 
where legitimate implementation behavior prevents the successful 
completion of an (otherwise) applicable test. Examples of such 
modifications include: adding a length clause to alter the default size 
of a collection; splitting a Class B test into subtests so that all 
errors are detected; and confirming that messages produced by an 
executable test demonstrate conforming behavior that was not anticipated 
by the test (such as raising one exception instead of another). 

Modifications were required for 37 tests. 

CC3126A was modified by Inserting the Initializing expression 
(others -> 'H')" into line numbered 117. With this modification, this 
test reports PASS. 

For this Implementation CD2C11A and CD2C11B were modified by inserting 
the initialization 5.0" into variable W's declaration (note that W 

is declared along with one or two other variables in a single object 


3-6 





declaration; the initialization is not needed for them, but does not 
affect their use). With these modification, these tests report PASS. 

The following 34 tests were split because syntax errors at one point 
resulted in the compiler not detecting other errors in the test:

3.7 ADDITIONAL TESTING INFORMATION 
3.7.1 Prevalidation 

Prior to validation, a set of test results for ACVC Version 1.10 
produced by the AdaVAX, Version 3.0 (/N0_0PTIMIZE Option) compiler was 
submitted to the AVF by the applicant for review. Analysis of these 
results demonstrated that the compiler successfully passed all 
applicable tests, and the compiler exhibited the expected behavior on 
all inapplicable tests. 


3.7.2 Test Method 


Testing of the AdaVAX, Version 3.0 (/N0_0PTIMIZE Option) compiler using 
ACVC Version 1.10 was conducted on-site by a validation team from the 
AVF. The configuration in which the testing was performed is described 
by the following designations of hardware and software components:

The contents of the magnetic tape were loaded directly onto the host 
computers. 

The ACVC Version 1.10 was compiled, linked, and all executable tests 
were rxjin on the host/target VAX 8350 as listed above. Results were 
printed from the VAX 8350. 

The ACVC Version 1.10 was compiled, linked, and all executable tests 
were run on the host/target VAX 11/785 as listed above. Results were 
printed from the VAX 11/785 computer. 

The compiler was tested using command scripts provided by U.S. NAVY and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix E for a complete listing 
of the compiler options for this implementation. The compiler options 
invoked during this test were: 

For A, C, D, L Tests: 

/SUMMARY /N0_TRACE_BACK /N0_0PTIMIZE /N0_LIST 
For B, E Tests: 

/SUMMARY /NO_TRACE_BACK /N0_0PTIMIZE /SOURCE /N0_LIST 

Unless explicitly stated the following are the default options: 

N0_S0URCE, NO MACHINE, N0_ATTRIBUTE, NO CROSS_REFERENCE, 
N0_DIAGN0STICS, N0_SUMMARY, N0_N0TES, PRIVATE, CONTAINER GENERATION, 
CODE 0N_WARNING, LIST, NO MEASTOE, DEBUG, TRACE_BACK, N0_0PTIMIZE, 
CHECKS 

Tests were compiled, linked, and executed as appropriate using a single 
computer. Test output, compilation listings, and Job logs were captured 
on magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings were examined 
on-site by the validation team. 


3.7.3 Test Site 

Testing was conducted at Newport, Rhode Islaid and was completed on 
November 30, 1989.

Section 6 


The Ada Language for the VAX Target 


The source language accepted by the compiler is Ada, as 
described in the Military Standard, Ada Programming Language, 
ANSI/MIL-STD-iai5A-19a3, 17 February 19a3 ("Ada Language 
Reference Manual"). 

The Ada definition permits certain implementation 
dependencies. Each Ada implementation is required to supply a 
complete description of its dependencies, to be thought of as 
Appendix F to the Ada Reference Manual. This section is rhat 
description for the VAX/VMS target. 


6.1 Options 

There are several compiler options provided by all ALS/N 
Compilers that directly affect the pragmas defined in the Ada 
Reference Manual. These compiler options currently include the 
CHECKS and OPTIMIZE options which affect the SUPPRESS and 
OPTIMIZE pragmas, respectively. A complete list of ALS/N 
Compiler options can be found in Section 10.2. 

The CHECKS option enables all run-time error checking for 
the source file being compiled, which can contain one or more 
compilation units. This allows the SUPPRESS pragma to be used ir. 
suppressing the run-time checks discussed in the Ada Reference 
Manual, but note that the SUPPR ESS pragma(s) must be applied zo 
each compilation unit. The NO CHECKS option disables all 
run-time error checking for all compilation units within the 
source file and is equivalent to SUPPRESSing all run-time checks 
within every compilation unit. 

The OPTIMIZE option enables all compile-time optimizations 
for the source file being compiled, which can contain one or more 
compilation units. This allows the OPTIMIZE pragma to request 
either TIME-oriented or SPACE-oriented optimizations be 
perfromed, but note that the OPTIMIZE pragma must be applied to 
each compilation unit. If the OPTIMIZE pragma is not present, 
the ALS/N Compiler's Global Optimizer tends to optimize for TI.ME 
over SPACE. The NO OPTIMIZE option disables all compile-time 
optimizations for all compilation units within the source file 
regardless of whether or not the OPTIMIZE pragma is present.

6.2 Pragmas 

Both ioplementation-defined and Ada language-defined pragmas 
are provided by all ALS/N Compilers. The syntax defined in the 
Ada Reference Manual allows pragmas as the only element in a 
compilation, before a compilation unit, at defined places within 
a compilation unit, or following a compilation unit. The ALS/N 
Compilers associates pragmas with compilation units as follows: 

a. If a pragma appears before any compilation unit in a 
compilation, it will affect all following compilation 
units, as specified below, and in the Ada Reference 
Manual. 

b. If a pragma appears inside a compilation unit, it 
will be associated with that compilation unit, and in 
listings associated with that compilation unit as 
described in the Ada Reference Manual, or in this 
document. 

c. If a pragma follows a compilation unit, it will be 
associated with the preceding compilation unit, and 
the effects of the pragma will be found in the 
container of that compilation unit, and in listings 
associated with that container. 

The pragmas MEMORY^SIZE, STORAGE_ONIT and SYSTEM NAME are 
described in Section 137? of the Ada Language Reference Manual. 
They may appear only at the start of the first compilation when 
creating a new program library. In the ALS/N, however, since 
program libraries are created by the Program Library Manager and 
not by the compiler, the use of these pragmas is obviated. If 
they appear anywhere, a diagnostic of severity level WARNING is 
generated. 


6.2.1 Language-Defined Pragmas 

The following notes specify the language*'required 
definitions of the predefined pragmas. Onmentioned 
language-defined pragmas are implemented as defined by the Ada 
language Reference Manual.

pragma INLINE (subprogram_naffle}; 

There are three instances in which the INLINE 
pragma is ignored. Each of these cases 
produces a warning message which states that 
the INLINE did not occur. 

a. If a call to an INLINEd 
subprogram is compiled before the 
actual body of the subprogram has 
been compiled (a routine call is 
made inscead). 

b. If the INLINEd subprograms 
compilation unit depends on the 
compilation unit of its caller (a 
routine call is made instead). 

c. If an immediately recursive 
subprogram call is made within 
the body of the INLINEd 
subprogram (the pragma INLINE is 
ignored entirely). 

pragma INTERFACE (language^^name > subprogram_name); 

Two language^names will be recognized and 
implemented 

ASMVAX_JSB, and ASMVAX_CALLS. 

The language_name ASMVAX_JSB indicates that a 
subprogram written in the VAX/VMS assembler 
language will be called with a JSB 
instruction .and the parameters passed in 
registers. The language_name ASMVAX_CALLS 
will provide interface to~a VAX assembler 
language subprogram via the CALLS 
instructions, with the parameters passed on 
the stack, with the same parameter passing 
conventions used for calling Ada subprograms. 

The users must ensure that an 
assembly-language body container for this 
specification will exist in the program 
library before linking.

pragma PAGE; 

This is a listing control pragma using. 

Using the pragma causes a page break in the 
listing; all code that follows pragma PAGE 
will start on a new page. The pragma may be 
placed anywhere inside a compilation unit. 

pragma OPTIMIZE (arg) 

This pragma is effective only when the 
"OPTIMIZE" option has been given to the 
compiler. The argument is either TIME or 
SPACE. If TIME is specified, the optimizer 
concentrates on optimizing code execution 
time. If SPACE is specified, the optimizer 
concentrates on optimizing code size. 

pragma PRIORITY (arg) 

The PRIORITY argument is an integer static 
expression value of predefined integer 
subtype PRIORITY. The pragma has no effect 
in a location other than a task (type) 
specification or outermost declarative part 
of a subprogram. If the pragma appears in 
the declarative part of a subprogram, it has 
no effect unless that subprogram is 
designated as the "main” subprogram at link 
time. 

pragma SUPPRESS (argC,arg]) 

Pragmas to suppress OVERrLOW_CH£CK will have 
no effegt for operations of~integer types. 

A SUPPRESS pragma will have effect only 
within the compilation unit in which it 
appears, except that a SUPPRESS of 
ELABORATION^CHECK applied at the declaration 
of a subprogram or task unit will apply to 
all calls or activations.

6.2.2 Inplementation-defined Pragmas 

The following item is the only implementation-defined 
pragma: 

pragma TITLE (arg); 

This is a listing control pragma. It 
specifies a character string that is to 
appear on the second line of each page of 
every listing produced for a compilation unit 
in the compilation. This title'is printed 
until a new pragma TITLE is encountered. 

The pragma should be placed after the 
compilation unit specification; if it is not, 
a warning message is issued. The argument 
is a string literal. 


6.2.3 Scope of Pragmas 

The scope of pragmas is as described in the Ada Reference 
Manual except as noted below. 

MEMORY^SIZE No scope, but a WARNING diagnostic is generated 
PAGE No scope 

STORAGE^SIZE No scope, but a WARNING diagnostic is generated 
SYSTEM_NAM£ No scope, but a WARNING diagnostic is generated

6.3 Attributes 

There is one iaplementation-defined attribute in addition to 
t.he predefined attributes found in Appendix A of the Ada 
Reference Manual. 

X'DISP 

A value of type aNIVERSAL_INTEGER which 
corresponds to the displacement that is used 
to address the first storage unit occupied 
by a data object X at a static offset within 
an implemented activation record. 

ils attribute differs from the ADDRESS 
^.tribute in that ADDRESS supplies the 
absolute address while OIS? supplies the 
disolacement relative to some base value 
(such as a stack frame pointer). It is the■ 
user's responsibility to determine the base 
value relevant to the attribute. 

The following notes augment the language-required 
definitions of the predefined attributes found in Appendix A of 
the Ada Refere.nce Manual.

6.6 Declaration and Representation Restrictions 

Declarations are described in Chapter 3 of the Ada Language 
Reference Manual. Representation specifications are described in 
Chapter 13 and discussed here. 

In the following specifications, the capitalized word 'SIZE' 
indicates the number of bits used to represent an object the type 
under discussion. The upper case symbols D, L, and R corresoond 
to those discussed in Section 3.S.9 of ANSI/MIL-STD-181SA. 


6.6.1 Integer Types 

Integer types are specified with constraints of the form: 
range L..R 

where: 

R <» SYSTEM.MAX^INT & L >■ SYSTEM.MIN_INT 
For an integer type, length specifications of the form: 

for T'SIZE use N; 

may specify integer values N such that N is in 2..32, 

R <* 2**(N-1)-1 4 L >« -2**(N-1); 
or else such that 

R <» (2**N)-1 4 L >- 0 
and N is in 1..31. 

For a stand-alone object of integer type, a default SIZE of 16 
is used when: 

R <« 2**1S-1 4 L >■ 2**15 

Otherwise a SIZE of 32 is used. 

For components of integer types within pacKed composite 
objects, the smaller of the default stand-alone SIZE or the SIZE 
from a length specification will be used.

6.6.2 Floating Types 

Floating types are specified with constraints of the form: 
digits 0 

where 0 is an integer value in 1 through 9. 

For floating point types» length specifications of the form: 

for T'SIZE use N; 

may specify integer values N * 32 when 0 <» 6r 
or N ■ 64 when 0 <= 9. 

When no length specification is provided^ a size of 32 is used; 
when 0 <■ 6/ 64 when 0 is 7 through 9. 


6.6.3 Fixed Types 

Fixed types are specified with constraints of the form: 
delta 0 range L..R 


where: 


max (abs(R), abs(L)) < 2**31-1 
actual delta 

The actual delta defaults to the largest integral power of 2 
less than or equal to the specified delta 0. (This implies 
that fixed point values are stored right-’aligned.) 

For fixed point types, length specifications of the form: 

for T'SIZE use N; 

are permitted only when N * 32. Where no length specification 
is provided, a size of 32 is used. 

Specifications of the form: 

for T*SMALL use X; 

where the actual delta X must be an integral power of 2 
such that X <s 0.

6.6.4 Enumeration Types 

In the absence of a representation specification for an 
enumeration type T, the internal representation of T*FIRST « 0. 
The default SIZE for a stand-alone object of enumeration type T 
will be the smallest of the values 8r 16r or 32, such that the 
internal representation of T*FIRST and T'LAST both falls within 
the range: 


-2**(T'SIZE-1) .. 2**(T’SIZE-l)-i. 

For enumeration types, length specification of the form: 

for T'SIZE use N; 


and/or enumeration representations of the form: 

for T use <aggregate>? 

are permitted for N in 2..32, provided that the internal 
representations and the SIZE conform to the relationship 
specified above. 

Or else for N in 1..31, is supported for enumeration types 
and provides an internal representation of: 

T'PIRST>«0 .. T’LAST<»2**(T’SIZE)-!. 


For components of enumeration types within paciced compos 
objects, the smaller of the default stand-alone SIZE or the S 
from a length specification will be used. 


Enumeration representation on types derived from the 
predined type BOOLEAN will not be accepted, but length 
specifications will be accepted.

6.6.5 Access Types 

For access type, T, length specifications of the form: 
for T'SIZE use M; 

will not effect the runtime implementation of T, therefore N ^ 32 
is the only value permitted for SIZE, which is the value returned 
by the attribute. 

For collection size specification of the form: 

for T‘STORAGE_SIZE use N; 

for any value of N is peimitted for STORAGE_SIZE (and that value 
will be returned by the attribute call). The collection size 
specification will effect the implementation of T and its 
collection at runtime by limiting the number of objects for type 
T that can be allocated. 


6.6.6 Arrays and Records 

For arrays and records, length specification of the form: 
for T'SIZE use N; 

may cause arrays and records to be packed, if required, to 
accommodate the length specification. If the SIZE specified is 
not large enough to contain all possible values of the 
component(s), a diagnostic message of severity ERROR is issued. 

The PACK pragma may be used to minimize wasted space, if 
any, between components of arrays and records. The pragma causes 
the type representation to be chosen such that storage space 
requirements are minimized at the possible expense of data access 
time and code space. 

For records, a component clause of the form: 
at N [range i,. j ] 

specifies the allocation of components in a record. Bits are 
numbered 0..7 from the tight and bit 8 starts at the right of the 
next higher"number byte. Each location specification must allow 
at least X bits of range, where X is large enough to hold any 
value of the subtype of the component being allocated. 

Otherwise, a diagnostic message of severity ERROR is generated.

I For recordsf an alignment clause of the form: 

I at mod N 

I specify alignments of N bytes for 1 byte, 2 bytes (VAX “word”) 
and 4 bytes (VAX "liong_word"). 

If it is determinable at compilation time that the SIZE of a 
record or array type or subtype maybe outside the range of 
STANDARD.LONG_INTEGER, a diagnostic message of severity WARNING 
is generated. Declaration of an object of such a type or subtype 
would raise NDMERIC_£RROR when elaborated. Note that a 
discrimated record or array may never raise the NDMERIC_ERRCR 
when elaborated based on the actual discriminant provided. 


6.6.7 Other Length Specifications 

length Specifications are described in Section 13.2 of the 
Ada Reference .Ma.nual. 

A length specification for a task type T, of the form: 
for T‘STORAGE'SIZE use N? 

specifies the number of bytes to be allocated for the runtime 
stack of each task object of type T.

6.7 Systea Names 

Refer to Section li.7 of the Ada Language Reference Manual 
for a discussion of package SYSTEM. 

The available system names are "AdaVAX", ’'Ada_L", and 
"Ada^M**; and the system name is choosen based on the target(s) 
supported, but it can not be changed. In the case of VAX/VMS, 
the*system name is "AdaVAX". 


6.8 Address Clauses 

Refer to Section 13.5 of the Ada Language Reference Manual 
for a discussion of Address Clauses. Address clauses have no 
effect for the VAX/VMS target. 

The Runtime Support Library (RSL) for the VAX/VMS target 
does not handle hardware interrupts. All hardware interrupts are 
handled by the VAX/VMS operating system. However, the 7AX_’/MS 
target uses asynchronous*system traps (ASTs) in a manner similar 
CO interrupt entries. 


6.9 anchecked Conversions 

Refer to Section 13.10.2 of the Ada Language Reference 
Manual for a description of ONCHECXED^CONVERSION. 

A program is erroneous if it performs JNCHECXZD^CON^/SRSICN 
when the source and target have different sizes. ~ 


6.10 Restrictions on the Main (Sub)Program 

Refer to Section 10.1 of the Ada Language Reference Manual 
for a discussion of the main (sub)program. The subprogram 
designated as the main (aub)program cannot have parameters. The 
designation as the main (sub)program of a subprogram whose 
specification contains a formal^part results in a diagnostic of 
severity ERROR at link time. ~ 

The main (sub)program can be a function, but the return 
value will not be available upon completion of the main 
(sub)program's execution. The main (sub)program may not be an 
imported subprogram.

6.11 Input/Output 

Refer to Chapter 14 of the Ada Language Reference Manual for 
a description of Ada Input/Output. 


I 6.11.1 External Files and Ada Input/Output 

An external file name for Ada Input/Output can be any valid 
oath name. The "FORM" string parameter to the CREATE a.nd OPEN 
procedures in packages DIRECT^IO, SEQUENTIAL_:o and TEXT_:o are 
saved as long as the file is open. This allows the user to 
I retrieve its value via calls to the procedure FORM, but it has no 
other effect. 


6.11.2 Pile Processing 

Processing allowed on ALS/N files is determined by the 
access controls set by the owner of the file and by the physical 
c.haracteriscics of the underlying device. The following 
restrictions apply: 

a. A user may open a file as an IN^FILE only if that 
user has read access to the node. A user may open a 
file as an OCT^PILE only if that user has write 
access to the node. Finally, a user may open a file 
as an INOUT_FILE only if that user has read and write 
access to t?e node. 

b. The attempt to CREATE a file with the mode IN_FILE is 
not supported since there will be no data in the file 
to read. 

c. Multiple OPENS are allowed to read from a file, but 
all OPENS to write require exclusive access to the 
file. The exception OSE^ERROR is raised if this 
restriction is violated.' 

d. No positioning operations are allowed on files 
associated with a printer or hard-copy terminal. The 
exception aSE_ERROR is raised if this restriction is 
violated. ”

6.11.3 Text Input/Output 

The implefflentation-defined type COUNT that appears in 
Section 14.3.10 of the Ada LRM is defined as follows: 

type COUNT is range 0..INTEGER'LAST; 

The implementation-defined subtype FIELD that appears in Section 
14.3.10 of the Ada LRM is defined as follows: 

subtype FIELD is INTEGER range 0..INTEGER'LAST; 

At the beginning of program execution, the STANDARD_INPUT 
file and the STANDARD_ODTPUT file are open, and associated vith 
the ALS/M-supported standard input and output files. 

Additionally, if a program terminates before an ooen file is 
closed (except for STANDARD^INPUT and STANDARD^OUTPUT), t.hen the 
last line which the user put to the file may be lost. 

A program is erroneous if concurrently executing tasxs 
attempt to perform overlapping GET and/or PUT operations on the 
same terminal. Because of the physical nature of DecWriters and 
Video terminals, the semantics of text layout as specified in Ada 
Reference Manual Section 14.3.2 (especially the concepts of 
current column number and current line) cannot be guaranteed when 
GST operations are interweaved with PUT operations. Programs 
which rely on the semantics of text layout under those 
circumstances are erroneous. 

For TEXT_IO processing, t.he line length can be no longer 
t.han the maximum VAX/VMS record length minus one, i.e., 255 
characters. Ah attempt to sec the line length through 
SET_LINE_LENGTH to a lehgth greater than 255 will result in 
USE ERROR. An attempt to write over the record length boundary 
will raise USE ERROR.

6.11.4 Sequential Input/Output 

The following restrictions are imposed on the use of the 
package Sequential_IO: 


a. A null file name parameter to the CREATE procedure 
(for opening a temporary file) is not appropriate, 
and raises the exception NAME_ZRROR; 

b. Writing a record on a file associated with a tape 
adds the record to the file such that the record just 
written becomes the last record of the file; 

c. On a disk or tape, the DELETE procedure closes the 
file and sets its size to zero so' that its data may 
no longer be acessed; and 

d. The subprogram END_OF_FILE always returns FALSE for a 
character-orienced'device and RESET performs no 
action on a character-oriented device. 


6.11.5 Direct Input/Output 

The implementation-defined type COUNT that appears in 
Section 14.2.5 of the Ada LRM is defined as follows:

6.13 Machine Code Insertions 

The Ada language definition permits machine code insertions 
as described in Section 13.8 of the Ada Reference Manual. This 
section describes the implementation specific details for writing 
machine code insertions as provided by the predefined library 
package MACHIME_COOC. 


6.13.1 Machine Features 

This section describes specific machine language features 
which are needed to write code statements. These machine 
features include the DISP and ADDRESS attributes and the address 
mode specifiers. The address mode specifiers make it possible to 
describe both the address mode and register number of any operand 
as a single value by mapping these values directly onto the*first 
byte of each operand. The following is an enumeration of all 
mode specifiers: 


— The first 64 are the short literal modes. 

*— These mode specifiers signify (short literal modef value) 
combinations. The values are in the range 0 to 63.

6.13.2 ADDRESS and DISF Attributes 

The following restriction applies to the use of the ADDRESS 
and DISP attributes: 


a. All displacements and addresses (i.e., branch 
destinations, program counter addressing mode 
displacements, etc.) must be static expressions. 

b. Since neither the ADDRESS nor DISP attributes return 
static values, they may not be used in code 

. statements. 


6.13.3 Restrictions on Assembler Constructs 

These unsupported Assembler constructs within the 
MACHINE^CODC package are as follows: 

a. The VAX/VMS assembler’s capability to compute the 
length of immediate and literal data is not 
replicated in MACHINE__CODE. This means the user 
cannot supply a value^without specifying the length 
of that 'value. This disallows the assembler ooerand 
general formats: D(R), G, G*G, Icons, lcons[Rx'], 
D(R)rRxJ, GfRjcI, G*location[Rx], @D(R)(Rx:, @G[Rx], 
6D(R), @G such that 0 and G are byte, word or 
Long^word values. Operands must contain address mode 
specifiers which explicitly define the length of any 
immediate or literal values of that operand. 

b. The radix of the assembler notation is deci.mal. To 
express a hexadecimal literal, the notation 
16#literal# should be used instead of ‘*X. 

c. To construct an octaword, quadword, g__float or 
h_float number, it is important for the user to 
remember that the component fields of the records 
which make up the long numeric types are signed. 

This means that the user must take care to be assured 
that the values for these components, although 
signed, are interpreted correctly by the 
architecture. 

d. Edit instruction streams must be constructed through 
the use of the VAX data statements described in 
Section 6.12.3.

e. Compatability mode instruction streams must be 
constructed through the use c£ the VAX data 
statements described in Section 6.12.3, if still 
supported on the VAX computer being utilized as the 
target machine (i.e., VAX^ll/TSO and 785, but not the 
VAX-8600). 

£. No error messages are generated if the ?C is used as 
the register for operands taking a single register, 
if the SP or PC are used for operands taking two 
registers, or if the AP, FP, S? or PC is used for 
operands taking four registers. 

g. No error message is generated if t.he PC is used in 
register deferred or autodecrement mode. 

h. If any register other than the PC is used as both the 
simple^operand and as the index reg for an operand 
(see Section 6.14.1.2 for definitions of 
simple^operand and index reg), no error message is 
generated. An example ol this case is the VAX 
Assembler operand (7)[7]. 

i. Generic opcode selection is not supported. This 
means the opcode which reflects the specified number 
of operands must he used. For example, for 2 operand 
word addition, AOOW2 must be used, not just ADOW. 

j. The PC is not supplied as a default if no register is 
specified in an operand. The user must supply the 
mode soecifier which is maoped onto the PC.* Examoles 
are IMD, A, B PC, W PC, etc.

6.14 Machine Instructions and Data 

This section describes the syntactic details for writing 
code statements (machine code insertions) as provided for the VAX 
by the pre-defined package MACHINE_CODE. The format for writing 
code statements is detailed, as are descriptions of the values to 
be supplied in the code statements. Each value is described by 
the named association for that value, and its defined in the 
order in which it must appear in positional notation. The 
programmer should refer to the VAX-11 Architecture Handbook along 
with this section to insure that the machine instructions are 
correct from an architectural viewpoint. 

To insure a proper interface between Ada and machine code 
insertions, the user must be aware of the calling conventions 
used by the Ada compiler. 


6.14.1 VAX Instructions 

The general format for VAX code state.ments where the opcode 
is a one byte opcode is 

BYTE_^OP_CODE (OP »> opcode {, "opcode'* 1 => operand 
” ” {,"opcode^ 2 *> operand 

{,"opcode^ 3 »> operand 
{,"opcode”” 4 s> operand 
{,"opcode”* 5 «> operand 
{, "opcode”’_6 a> operand}}}}}}); 

The general format for VAX code statements where the opcode 
is a two byte opcode is 

WORD_OP_CODE (OP »> opcode2 {,"opcode2" 1 »> operand 
” ” {,"opcode2”’ 2 *> operand 

{,"opcode2”’ 3 »> operand 
{,"opcode2”’ 4 *> operand 
{,"opcode2”’ 5 »> operand 
{, "opcode 2 ”’__6 «> operand}}}}}}); 

where "opcode"_n and "opcode2"_n is the result of the 
concatenation of the VAX opcode, an underscore, and the position 
of the operand in the VAX instruction. The BYTS^OP CODE*and 
WORD_OP_CODE statements always require an opcode”an3 may include 
from 1 to 6 operands. The opcode .mnemonics are precisely the 
same as described in the previously referenced VAX-11 
Architecture Handbook. The VAX address modes divide the operands 
into six general categories, namely; Short Literal Operand, 
Indexed Operand, Register Operand, Byte Displace.ment Operand, 

Word Displacement Operand, and Long Word Displacement Operand.

6.14.1.1 Short Literal Operands 

The VAX/VMS assembler format for short literal operands is 
S'‘#cons 

where cons is an integer constant with a range from 0 to 63 
(decimal). 

The code statement format for short literal operands is 
(OP => short^lit) 

where short_lit is one of the enumerated values, range LO to L63, 
of the address mode specifiers in Section 6.11.1. 

The following are examples of how some VAX Assemoler short 
literals would be expressed*in code statements.

(For explanations of named and unnamed component association, see 
Section 4.3 of the Ada Language Reference Manual.) 


6.14.1.2 Indexed Operands 

The VAX/VMS Assembler format for the indexed operands is, in 
general 


simple_operandCRx] 

where a simple^operand is an operand of any address mode except 
register, literal, or index. 

The general code statement format for indexed operands is 

(index^reg, simple^operand) or 

(OP *> index_reg, OPND ■> simple_operand) 

where index_reg is one of the enumerated address mode specifiers, 
range X_R0 to X_SP, from Section 6.11.1. Simple operand is an 
operand”of any address mode except register, literal, or index.

6.14.1.6 Longwcrd Displacement Operands 

The VAX/VMS Assembler general formats for the longword 
displacement operands is 

L'‘d(Rn) -- Long^word displacement 

@L'‘d(Rn) — Long”word displacement deferred 

where d is the displacement to be added to the register 
represented by Rn. Longword displacement operands are 
represented in code statements by the general format 

{lword_disp_spec, value) 

or 


(OP ■> lword_disp^spec, LONG_WORD_DIS? *> value) 

where Iword^disp^spec is one of the enumerated address mode 
specifiers»“range L RO to L__?C for long word displacement mode or 
IL_R0 to IL PC for rongword^'displacement deferred mode, from 
Section S.lX.l. Value is in the range -2**31 to 2**31 - 1. 


The following are examples of how VAX/VMS Assembler 
long^word displacement operands would be written in code 
statements.

6.14.2 The CASE Statement 

The VAX case statements (mnemonics CASES, CASEW, and CASED 
have the following general symbolic form 

opcode selector.rx, base.rx, limit.rx, 

displ[0].bw, .. , displ[limit].bw 

where x is deoendent upon the opcode as to whether the operand is 
of type BYTE, WORD, or LONG WORD. Displ(0].bw, .. , 

displ[limit].bw is a list o? displacements to which to branch. 
Case statements would be written as code statements as:

APPENDIX C 


TEST PARAMETERS 


Certain tests in the ACVC make use of implementation-dependent values, 
such as the maximum length of an input line and invalid file names. A 
test that makes use of such values is identified by the extension .TST 
in its file name. Actual values to be substituted are represented by 
names that begin with a dollar sign. A value must be substituted for 
each of these names before the test is run. The values used for this 
validation are given below.

APPENDIX D 


WITHDRAWN TESTS 


Some tests are withdrawn from the ACVC because they do not conform to 
the Ada Standard. The following 44 tests had been withdrawn at the time 
of validation testing for the reasons indicated. A reference of the 
form Al-ddddd is to an Ada Commentary. 

A39005G 

This test unreasonably expects a component clause to pack an array 
component into a minimum size (line 30). 

B97102E 

This test contains an unintended illegality; a select statement 
contains a null statement at the place of a selective wait alternative 
(line 31). 

C97116A 

This test contains race conditions, and it assumes that guards are 
evaluated indivisibly. A conforming implementation may use interleaved 
execution in such a way that the evaluation of the guards at lines 50 & 
54 and the execution of task CHANGING_OF THE GUARD results in a call to 
REPORT.FAILED at one of lines 52 or 56. ~ 

BC3009B 

This test wrongly expects that circular instantiations will be detected 
in several compilation units even though none of the units is illegal 
with respect to the units it depends on; by AI-00256, the illegality 
need not be detected until execution is attempted (line 95). 

CD2A62D 

This test wrongly requires that an array object's size be no greater 
than 10 although its subtype's size was specified to be 40 (line 137). 

CD2A63A..D, CD2A66A..D, CD2A73A..D, CD2A76A..D [16 tests] 

These tests wrongly attempt to check the size of objects of a derived 
type (for which a 'SIZE length clause is given) by passing them to a 
derived subprogram (which implicitly converts them to the parent type 
(Ada standard 3.4:14)). Additionally, they use the 'SIZE length clause 
and attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic by the WG9 
ARG. 

CD2A81G, CD2A83G, CD2A84M & N, & CD50110 

These tests assume', that dependent tasks will terminate while the main 
program executes a loop that simply tests for task termination; this is 
not the case, and the main program may loop indefinitely (lines 74, 85, 
86 & 96, 86 & 96, and 58, resp.). 






CD2B15C & CD7205C 

These tests expect that a 'STORAGE_SIZE length clause provides precise 
control over the number of designated objects in a collection; the Ada 
standard 13.2:15 allows that such control must not be expected. 

CD2D11B 

This test gives a SMALL representation clause for a derived fixed-point 
type (at line 30) that defines a set of model numbers that are not 
necessarily represented in the parent type; by Commentary AI-00099, all 
model numbers of a derived fixed-point type must be representable values 
of the parent type. 

CD5007B 

This test wrongly expects an implicitly declared subprogram to be at the 
address that is specified for an unrelated subprogram (line 303). 

ED7004B, ED7005C & D, ED7006C & D [5 tests] 

These tests check various aspects of the use of the three SYSTEM 
pragmas; the AVO withdraws these tests as being inappropriate for 
validation. 

CD7105A 

This test requires that successive calls to CALENDAR.CLOCK change by at 
least SYSTEM.TICK; however, by Commentary AI-00201, it is only the 
expected frequency of change that must be at least SYSTEM.TICK -- 
particular instances of change may be less (line 29). 

CD7203B, & CD7204B 

These tests use the 'SIZE length clause and attribute, whose 
interpretation is considered problematic by the WG9 ARG. 

CD7205D 

This test checks an invalid test objective: it treats the specification 
of storage to be reserved for a task's activation as though it were like 
the specification of storage for a collection. 

CE2107I 

This test requires that objects of two similar scalar types be 
distinguished when read from a file--DATA_ERROR is expected to be raised 
by an attempt to read one object as of the other type. However, it is 
not clear exactly how the Ada standard 14.2.4:4 is to be interpreted; 
thus, this test objective is not considered valid. (line 90) 

CE3111C 

This test requires certain behavior, when two files are associated with 
the same external file, that is not required by the Ada standard. 

CE3301A 

This test contains several calls to END_OF_LINE & END_0F_PAGE that have 
no parameter: these calls were intended to specify a file, not to refer 
to STANDARD_INPUT (lines 103, 107, 118, 132, & 136). 


D-2 






CE3411B 

This test requires that a text file's column number be set to COUNT'LAST 
in order to check that LAYOUT_ERROR is raised by a subsequent PUT 
operation. But the former operation will generally raise an exception 
due to a lack of available disk space, and the test would thus encumber 
validation testing. 

E28005C 

This test expects that the string TOP OF PAGE. --63" of line 204 
will appear at the top of the listing page due to a pragma PAGE in line 
203; but line 203 contains text that follows the pragma, and it is this 
that must appear at the top of the page.

Option Function 


Listing Control 

Options: 

ATTRIBUTE 

Produce a symbol attribute listing. 

(Produces an attribute cross-reference listing 
when both ATTRIBUTE and CROSS_REFER£NCE are 
specified.) Default: NO_ATTRIBUTE 

DIAGNOSTICS 

Produce a diagnostic summary listing. 

Default: NO_DlAGNOSTICS 

MACHINE_CODE 

Produce a machine code listing if code is 
generated. Default: NO_MACHINE_CODE 


Code is generated when CONTAINER_GENERATION 
option is in effect and (1) there are no 
diagnostics of severity ERROR, SYSTEM or 

FATAL (2) NO_CODE_ON_WARNING option is in 
effect and there are no diagnostics of 
severity higher than NOTE. 

NOTES 

Include diagnostics of NOTE severity level in 
the source or diagnostic summary listings. 
Default: NO_NOTES 

PRIVATE 

Include listing of Ada statements in private 
part if source listing is produced, subject 
to requirements of SOURCE option. 

Default: PRIVATE 

SOURCE 

Produce listing of Ada source statements. 
Default: NO_SOURCE 

SUMMARY 

Produce a summary listing, always produced 
when there are errors in the compilation. 
Default: NO SUMMARY 

CROSS_REFERENCE Produce a cross-reference listing. 

(Produces an attribute cross-reference listing 
•when both ATTRIBUTE and CROSS REFERENCE are 
specified.) Default: NO CROSS REFERENCE

Special Processing Options: 

CHECKS Provide run-time error checking. NO_CHECKS 

suppresses all run-time error checking. 

Please refer to the Pragma SUPPRESS 
description for further information on 
on run-time error checking. Default: CHECKS 

CODE_ON_WARNING Generate code (and machine code listing, if 
“ requested) only when there are no diagnostics 

of a severity higher than WARMING. 

Default: CODE_ON_WARNING 

NO_CODE_ON_WARNING means no code is generated 
when there'”is a diagnostic of severity WARNING 
or higher (i.e., ERROR, SYSTEM, or FATAL). 

CONTAINER_GENERATION 

“ Produce a Container if diagnostic severity 

permits. NO_CONTAINER_GENERATION means that 
no Container“is produced even if there are no 
diagnostices. No code (or machine code 
listing, if requested), is generated if a 
Container is not produced because the 
NO CONTAINER GENERATION option is in effect. 
Default: CONTAINER_GENERATION 

DEBUG Generates debugger symbolic information and, 

as required, changes the code being generated. 

If NO DEBUG is specified, the compiler output 
includes only that information needed to 
link, export, and execute the current unit. 
Default: DEBUG 

The NO_DCBUG is ignored for a unit that: 

o is a package or subprogram specification, 
o is a subprogram body for which there is 
no previous declaration, or 
o contains a body stub, pragma INLINE, 
generic declaration, or a generic body. 

A diagnostic of severity NOTE is issued when 
the option is ignored.

MEASURE Generates code to monitor execution frequency 

at the subprogram level for the current unit. 
Default: NO_M£ASURE 

OPTIMIZE Enable global optimizations in accordance 

withthe optimization pragmas specified in the 
source program. Default: NO_OPTIMIZE 


When NO_OPTIMIZE is in effect, no global 
optimizations are performed, regardless of 
pragmas specified. The OPTIMIZE option 
enables global optimization. The goals of 
global optimization may be influenced by the 
user through the Ada-defined OPTIMIZE pragma. 
If TIME is specified, the global optimizer 
concentrates on optimizing execution time. 

If SPACE is specified, the global optimizer 
concentrates on optimizing code size. If the 
user does not include pragma OPTIMIZE, the 
optimizations emphasize TIME over SPACE. 

IF NO_OPTIMIZE is in effect, no optimizations 
are performed, regardless of the pragma. 

TRACE_BACK Provide calling sequence tracebacic information 
~ when a program is aborted because of an 

unhandled exception. Default: TRACE_BACK
