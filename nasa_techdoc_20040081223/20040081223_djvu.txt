ABSTRACT 

We present a study of the compatibility of some current models of the diffuse 
Galactic continuum 7-rays with EGRET data. A set of regions sampling the 
whole sky is chosen to provide a comprehensive range of tests. The range of 
EGRET data used is extended to 100 GeV. The models are computed with 
our GALPROP cosmic-ray propagation and gamma-ray production code. We 
confirm that the "conventional model" based on the locally observed electron 
and nucleon spectra is inadequate, for all sky regions. A conventional model plus 
hard sources in the inner Galaxy is also inadequate, since this cannot explain the

GeV excess away from the Galactic plane. Models with a hard electron injection 
spectrum are inconsistent with the local spectrum even considering the expected 
fluctuations; they are also inconsistent with the EGRET data above 10 GeV. 

We present a new model which fits the spectrum in all sky regions adequately. 
Secondary antiproton data were used to fix the Galactic average proton spectrum, 
while the electron spectrum is adjusted using the spectrum of diffuse emission it- 
self. The derived electron and proton spectra are compatible with those measured 
locally considering fluctuations due to energy losses, propagation, or possibly de- 
tails of Galactic structure. This model requires a much less dramatic variation in 
the electron spectrum than models with a hard electron injection spectrum, and 
moreover it fits the 7-ray spectrum better and to the highest EGRET energies. 
It gives a good representation of the latitude distribution of the 7-ray emission 
from the plane to the poles, and of the longitude distribution. We show that sec- 
ondary positrons and electrons make an essential contribution to Galactic diffuse 
7-ray emission.

1. Introduction 

Diflfuse continuum 7-rays from the interstellar medium are potentially able to reveal 
much about the sources and propagation of cosmic rays (OR), but in practice the exploitation 
of this well-known connection is problematic. While the basic processes governing the CR 
propagation and production of diffuse 7-ray emission seem to be well-established, some 
puzzles remain. In particular, the spectrum of 7-rays calculated under the assumption that 
the proton and electron spectra in the Galaxy resemble those measured locally reveals an 
excess above 1 GeV in the EGRET spectrum (Hunter et al. 1997). 

The Galactic diffuse continuum 7-rays are produced in energetic interactions of nucleons 
with gas via neutral pion production, and by electrons via inverse Compton (IC) scattering 
and bremsstrahlung. These processes are dominant in different parts of the spectrum, and 
therefore if deciphered the 7-ray spectrum can provide information about the large-scale 
spectra of nucleonic and leptonic components of CR. In turn, having an improved under- 
standing of the Galactic diffuse 7-ray emission and the role of CR is essential for unveiling 
the spectra of other components of the diffuse emission and is thus of critical importance for 
the study of many topics in 7-ray astronomy, both Galactic and extragalactic.

The puzzle of the "GeV excess" has lead to an attempt to re-evaluate the reaction of 
Tr'^-production in pp-interactions. However, a calculation made using modern Monte Carlo 
event generators to simulate high-energy pp-coUisions has shown (Mori 1997) that the 7- 
ray flux agrees rather well with previous calculations. A flatter Galactic nucleon spectrum 
has been suggested as a possible solution to the "GeV excess" problem (Gralewicz et aL 
1997; Mori 1997). Explaining the excess requires an ambient proton spectrum power-law 
index of about -2.4-2.5, compared to -2.75 measured locally (for a summary of recent data 
see Moskalenko et al. 2002). Such large variations in the proton spectrum are, however, 
improbable. A sensitive test of the large-scale-average proton spectrum has been proposed 
by Moskalenko, Strong, & Reimer (1998) based on the fact that secondary antiprotons and 
7-rays are produced in the same pp-interactions. The secondary antiprotons sample the 
proton spectrum in a large region of the Galaxy, and a flatter nucleon spectrum in distant 
regions would lead to overproduction of secondary antiprotons and positrons. The "hard 
nucleon spectrum" hypothesis has effectively been excluded by recent measurements of p/p 
ratio at high energies (e.g.. Beach et al. 2001). In addition, new accurate measurements 
of the local proton and Helium spectrum allow less freedom for deviations in the 7r°-decay 
component. 

A "hard electron spectrum" hypothesis has been investigated by Porter k. Protheroe 
(1997), Pohl & Esposito (1998), and Aharonian & Atoyan (2000). An essential idea of this 
approach is that the locally-measured CR spectrum of electrons is not a good constraint 
because of the spatial fluctuations due to energy losses and the stochastic nature of the 
sources in space and time; the average interstellar electron spectrum responsible for 7-rays via 
IC emission (and bremsstrahlung) can therefore be quite diflFerent from that measured locally. 
An extensive study of this hypothesis has been made by Strong, Moskalenko, &; Reimer 
(2000); in this model a less dramatic but essential modification of the proton and Helium 
spectrum (for the 7r°-decay component) was also required. The latter was still consistent 
with the locally-observed proton spectrum, as it should be since the proton fluctuations are 
expected to be small (Strong &; Moskalenko 2001a) as the result of their negligible energy 
losses. The "hard electron spectrum" hypothesis suffers however from the following problems: 

• It is hardly compatible with the local electron spectrum even considering the fluctu- 
ations due to stochastic sources and energy losses, as shown by a 3D time-dependent 
study (Strong & Moskalenko 2001b); 

• The fit to the shape of the 7-ray spectrum is still poor above 1 GeV (Strong et al. 
2000); 

• It cannot reproduce the spectrum in the inner and outer Galaxy and intermediate/high 
latitudes simultaneously (Strong, Moskalenko, & Reimer 2003a); 



These problems were already evident before the present study, but now we show in 
addition that 

• it predicts significantly higher intensities than the EGRET data above 10 GeV. 

Another suggestion which has been made (Berezhko & Volk 2000) is that the 7-ray 
spectrum contains a contribution from accelerated particles confined in SNR. The SNR 
proton and electron spectra, being much harder than the interstellar CR spectra, produce 
Tr'^-decay and IC 7-rays adding to the apparently diffuse 7-rays, while the SNRs themselves 
are too distant to be resolved into individual sources. 

A shortcoming of previous analyses was that the comparison with EGRET data was 
limited to particular regions, and the rich EGRET data have remained not fully exploited. 
Hunter et al. (1997) made an extensive comparison of the spectra near the Galactic plane 
|6| < 10°. Other analyses have concentrated on particular molecular clouds: Ophiuchus 
(Hunter et al. 1994), Orion (Digel et al. 1999), Cepheus and Perseus (Digel et al. 1996), 
Monoceros (Digel et al. 2001), high latitudes (Sreekumar et al. 1998). The previous anal- 
ysis by Strong et al. (2000) was limited to the inner Galaxy at low latitudes, and profiles 
integrated over large regions of longitude or latitude. In that study, we compared a range 
of models, based on our CR propagation code GALPROP, with data from the Compton 
Gamma Ray Observatory. Relative to the work of Hunter et al. (1997) we emphasized the 
connection with CR propagation theory and the importance of IC emission, and less to fit- 
ting to structural details of the Galactic plane. The study confirmed that it is rather easy 
to get agreement within a factor ~2 from a few MeV to 10 GeV with a "conventional" set 
of parameters, however, the data quality warrant considerably better fits. 

In the present paper we attempt to exploit the fact that the models predict quite spe- 
cific behaviour for diff'erent sky regions and this provides a critical test: the "correct" model 
should be consistent with the data in all directions. We show that a new model, with less 
dramatic changes of electron and nucleon spectra relative to the "conventional" model, can 
well reproduce the 7-ray data. The changes consist in renormalization of the intensities of 
the electron and proton spectra, and a relatively small modification of the proton spectrum 
at low energies. The model is compatible with locally observed particle spectra considering 
the expected level of spatial fluctuations in the Galaxy. We extend the 7-ray data compar- 
isons over the entire sky and to 100 GeV in energy. We also exploit the recent improved 
measurements of the local proton, Helium, as well as antiproton, and positron spectra which 
are used as constraints on the proton spectrum in distant regions. 

Our approach differs from that of Hunter et al. (1997) in that it is based on a model of CR 
propagation while Hunter et al. use CR-gas coupling and a relatively small IC component.

It is also different from Strong & Mattox (1996) in that it is based on a physical model, 
while that work was based on model-fitting to gas surveys to determine the 7-ray emissivity 
spectrum as a function of Galactocentric radius. 

The selection of a good model for the diffuse Galactic emission is critical to another 
topic, the extragalactic 7-ray background (EGRB). We have argued in Strong et al. (2000) 
and Moskalenko &: Strong (2000) that IC from a large halo can make up a substantial fraction 
of the high-latitude emission and hence reduce the residual EGRB (and modify its spectrum 
relative to Sreekumar et al. 1998). In a companion paper (Strong, Moskalenko, & Reimer 
2004) we present a comprehensive discussion of the EGRB, with a new estimate which is 
used in the present paper. 



2. Models 

The principles of the G ALPROP code for CR propagation and 7-ray emission have been 
described in Strong &c Moskalenko (1998) and Strong et al. (2000). Since then the code^ has 
been entirely re- written in C-f— f- (Moskalenko et al. 2002, and references therein) using the 
experience gained from the original (fortran) version, with improvements in particular in the 
generation of 7-ray skymaps. Both 2D (radially symmetric) and full 3D options are available, 
the latter allowing also explicit time-dependence with stochastic SNR source events (Strong 
& Moskalenko 2001b). For this paper the 2D option is sufficient since we need only kpc-scale 
averaged CR spectra (even if these differ from local CR measurements). 

An important point to note is that even in the 2D case, the symmetry applies only to 
the CR distribution; for the gas-related components (7r°-decay and bremsstrahlung) of the 
7-ray skymaps we use 21-cm line survey data for H I and CO ( J = 1 — > 0) survey data for H2, 
in the form of column densities for Galactocentric "rings," using velocity information and 
a rotation curve (see Appendix A for details). In this way details of Galactic structure are 
included at least for the gas, at a sufficient level for the present limited state of knowledge on 
e.g. the relation of cosmic rays to spiral structure. The longitude range 350° < I < 10° is not 
included in the H I and CO survey data due to lack of kinematic information; for the analysis 
interpolated values are used, and this is found to be fully consistent will the 7-ray data. The 
interstellar radiation field (ISRF) for computing IC emission and electron energy losses is 
the same as that described and used in Strong et al. (2000); pending a new calculation (an 
ambitious project) this is the best we have available. Although the uncertainty in the ISRF 
is a shortcoming, note that since we fit to the 7-ray data by adjusting the electron spectrum. 



^As usual the code and documentation is available at http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~aws/aws.html 



-6- 



inaccuracies in the ISRF spectrum will tend to be compensated. 

The radial distribution of CR sources used is the same as in Strong et al. (2000), since 
we find this empirically-derived form still gives a good reproduction of the 7-ray longitude 
distribution. Although flatter than the SNR distribution (e.g., Case & Bhattacharya 1998), 
this may be compensated by the gradient in the CO-to-H2 conversion factor whose metallicity 
and temperature dependences have the net effect of causing the factor to increase with R 
(Papadopoulos, Thi, & Viti 2002; Israel 1997). We use a uniform value of Xco= 1.9x10^° 
molecules cm~^/(K km s~^) as in Strong et al. (2000) and Strong & Mattox (1996); this 
is consistent with the value (1.8 ± 0.3) x 10^*^ molecules cm~^/(K km s"^) from a recent 
(non-7-ray) CO survey analysis by Dame et al. (2001). 

The parameters of the models are summarized in Table 1. The models differ only in the 
injection spectra of protons (and He) and electrons, while the injection spectra of heavier 
nuclei are assumed to have the same power-law in rigidity, for all models. For propagation, 
we use essentially the same diffusion reacceleration model, model DR, as described in Mos- 
kalenko et al. (2002). The propagation parameters have been tuned to fit the B/C ratio 
(Fig. 1) using improved cross-sections (Moskalenko & Mashnik 2003). The spatial diffu- 
sion coefficient is taken as ^Dq{p/ p^Y , where Dq — 5.8 x 10^^ cm s"-^ at po = 4 GV, and 
5 = 1/3 (Kolmogorov spectrum). The Alfven speed is v^ = 30 km s~^. The halo height is 
taken as z^ = 4 kpc as in Strong et al. (2000), in accordance with our analysis of CR sec-, 
ondary/primary ratios (Moskalenko, Mashnik, & Strong 2001; Moskalenko et al. 2002, and 
references therein). However, values z^, differing by 50% (the estimated error) with corre- 
sponding adjustment of Dq would provide essentially similar results since the IC contribution 
scales mainly with the electron spectrum which is here treated as a free parameter. 

The spectra are compared in the regions summarized in Table 2. Region A corresponds 
to the "iriner radian", region B is the Galactic plane excluding the inner radian, region C 
is the "outer Galaxy" , regions D and E cover higher latitudes at all longitudes, region F is 
"Galactic poles". Region H is the same as in Hunter et al. (1997) and is used for comparison 
with results of Hunter et al. In addition to spectra, profiles in longitude and latitude are 
an essential diagnostic; our latitude profiles are plotted logarithmically because of the large 
dynamic range from the Galactic plane to the poles. 

The EGRB used here is based on the new determination by Strong et al. (2004). Since 
this was derived for the EGRET energy bands, it is interpolated in order to produce a contin- 
uous spectrum for combining with the model Galactic components. The present analysis is 
however not sensitive to the details of the EGRB. Since our COMPTEL data do not contain 
the EGRB (see Section 3.2), we do not extrapolate the EGRB beyond the EGRET energy 
range when comparing with data.

The output of the GALPROP runs is in the form of FITS files; the visualization^ in the 
form of spectra and profiles, and comparison of the results with data involves integrations 
over sky regions and energy as well as convolution. The predicted model skymaps are 
convolved with the EGRET point-spread function as described in Strong et al. (2000). For 
the profiles the convolved model is directly compared with the observed intensities. For 
the spectra, the procedure is slightly diflferent: the predicted (unconvolved) intensities are 
compared with intensities corrected for the effect of convolution as given by the model under 
study. This procedure has the advantage that the spectra are spatially deconvolved, allowing 
for more direct interpretation and also the combination of data with other experiments, such 
as COMPTEL, with different instrument response functions. The effect of this procedure on 
the spectra is only significant below 500 MeV. 



3. 7-ray and cosmic ray measurements 

3.1. EGRET data 

We use the co-added and point-source removed EGRET counts and exposure maps in 
Galactic coordinates with 0.5° x 0.5° binsize at energies between 30 MeV and 10 GeV, 
as described in Strong et al. (2000). Apart from the most intense sources, the removal of 
sources has little infiuence on the comparison with models. For the spectra, the statistical 
errors on the EGRET data points are very small since the regions chosen have large solid 
angle; the systematic error dominates and we have conservatively adopted a range ±15% in 
plotting the observed spectra (Sreekumar et al. 1998; Esposito et al. 1999). For longitude 
and latitude profiles only the statistical errors are plotted. In addition we use EGRET data 
in the energy ranges 10-20, 20-50 and 50-120 GeV. Because the instrumental response of 
EGRET determined at energies above 10 GeV is less certain compared to energies below 
10 GeV, it is necessary to account for additional uncertainties. In particular the EGRET 
effective area can only be deduced by extrapolation from the calibrated effective area at lower 
energies (Thompson et al. 1993a). We accordingly adopt values of 0.9, 0.8, and 0.7 times the 
4-10 GeV effective area, respectively. On top of the statistical and systematic uncertainties 
as described above we account for the uncertainties due to the uncalibrated effective area of 
the EGRET telescope above 10 GeV with an additional systematic error of ±5%. However, 
the actual number of photons >10 GeV is small: 1091, 362 and 53 events respectively, and 
concentrated mainly in the inner Galaxy; hence the comparison with models above 10 GeV 



^An additional program GALPLOT has been developed for this purpose, with flexible plotting options 
and convolution; this will be made available with future versions of GALPROP. 



can only be made in this region. 

At low energies the EGRET effective area includes the so-called "Kniffen factor" (Thomp- 
son et al. 1993b) derived by fitting the Crab spectrum; this additional uncertainty (factor 
= 2-3.4 for 30-50 MeV and 1.2 - 1.6 for 50-70 MeV) should be borne in mind when 
comparing models with EGRET data. 



3.2. COMPTEL data 

The intensities are based on COMPTEL maximum entropy all-sky maps in the energy 
ranges 1-3, 3-10 and 10-30 MeV, as published in Strong et al. (1999). The intensities are 
averaged over the appropriate sky regions, with high latitudes being used to define the zero 
level. COMPTEL data is only used for the inner Galaxy spectra, since the skymaps do not 
show significant diffuse emission elsewhere. For this reason, the COMPTEL data shown in 
the figures does not include the EGRB. 



3.3. Cosmic rays 

In our conventional model we use the locally-observed proton. He, and electron spec- 
tra (solid lines in Figs. 2, 3). The nucleon data are now more precise than those which 
were available for Strong et al. (2000). The proton (and Helium) injection spectra and the 
propagation parameters are chosen to reproduce the most recent measurements of primary 
and secondary nuclei, as described in detail in Moskalenko et al. (2002). The error on the 
dominant proton spectrum in the critical (for Tr'^-decay) 10 - 100 GeV range is now only 
~ 5% for BESS (Sanuki et al. 2000). Relative to protons, the contribution of He in CR to 
the 7-ray flux is about 17%, and the CNO nuclei in CR contribute about 3%. The He nuclei 
in the ISM contribute about 25% relative to hydrogen for the given ratio He/H = 0.11 by 
number. The total contribution of nuclei with Z > 1 is about 50% relative to protons. 

In our optimized model we use the proton and He high-energy spectral shape derived 
from the local data (dotted lines in Figs. 2, 3). We allow however for some deviations in 
the normaUzation. The antiproton (Orito et al. 2000; Beach et al. 2001) and positron data 
provide an important constraint (Moskalenko et al. 1998; Strong et al. 2000) on the proton 
spectrum on a large scale. Since the low-energy protons are undetectable in the ISM, we 
allow more freedom in the proton and He spectrum below 10 GeV. We introduce a break at 
10 GeV which enables us to fit the 7-ray spectrum while still remaining within the constraints 
provided by the locally-observed antiproton and positron spectra. The deviations from the 



9- 



local measurements at low energies can be caused by the effect of energy losses and spatial 
fluctuations in the Galaxy. The modification of the low-energy proton spectrum may also 
be partly a compensation for errors in the models of neutral pion production at low energies 
(e.g., Stecker 1970), which rely on the data of 1960's (see Dermer 1986, and references therein) 
and do not provide the required accuracy now. Besides, the low-energy protons are strongly 
affected by solar modulation; while the effect of solar modulation is not fully understood, 
it is essential below 10 GeV. We refer a reader to Section 8 where various aspects of the 
uncertainties are discussed in more detail. For electrons, the injection index near ~1.8 at 
~1 GeV is consistent (see Strong et al. 2000) with observations of the synchrotron index 
^ = 2.40 - 2.55 for 22-408 MHz (Roger et al. 1999) and P = 2.57 ± 0.03 for 10-100 MHz 
(Webber, Simpson, & Cane 1980). 

Secondaxy and tertiary antiprotons are calculated as described in Moskalenko et al. 
(2002). Secondary positron and electron production is computed using the formalism de- 
scribed in Moskalenko &: Strong (1998), which includes a reevaluation of the secondary tt*- 
and iiT'^-meson decay calculations. Antiprotons, positrons, and electrons including secondary 
electrons are propagated in the same model as other CR species. 



4. Conventional model 

We start by repeating the test of the "conventional" model; the 7-ray spectra in the 
7 test regions are shown in Fig. 4. As required by the "conventional" tag, the proton and 
electron spectra are consistent with the locally observed spectra (Figs. 2, 3). This is the same 
"conventional" model as in Strong et al. (2000), with updated nucleon spectra, but because 
we compare with a more complete set of EGRET data than in Strong et al. (2000), the 
discrepancies become more explicit, and we can check whether they arise only in particular 
sky regions. Note that IC plays only a minor role in this type of model. As found in previous 
work, the GeV energy range shows an excess relative to that predicted; what is now evident is 
that this excess appears in all latitudes/longitude ranges. This is consistent with the results 
of Hunter et al. (1997) and Digel et al. (2001). It already shows that the GeV excess is not 
a feature restricted to the Galactic ridge or the gas-related emission. Further it is clear that 
a simple upward rescaling of the 7r°-decay component will not improve the fit in any region, 
since the observed peak is at higher energies than the 7r°-decay peak. In other words, since 
the spectrum is very different from 7r°-decay even at intermediate latitudes, a substantial IC 
component is required. 

Note that this version of the "conventional" spectrum is nevertheless in rather better 
agreement with EGRET data than in Strong et al. (2000), due to inclusion of secondary 



10- 



positrons/electrons, general improvements in the model (e.g., 7r°-decay, improved gas data) 
and the EGRET data treatment (direct use of the count and exposure data instead of the 
model-fitting analysis of Strong & Mattox 1996). The improvement is especially evident in 
the 30-100 MeV range, where secondary positrons/electrons make a substantial contribution 
(see Section 7). 

A test against antiproton and positron data also shows "excesses". The conventional 
model with reacceleration is known (Moskalenko et al. 2002) to produce a factor of ~1.5 
(~2.5a) less antiprotons at 2 GeV than measured by BESS (Orito et al. 2000). The antipro- 
ton spectrum for the conventional model is shown in Fig. 5. Positron data, though scattered, 
also show some "excess" at high energies (Fig. 6). It is thus clear that the "excesses" in GeV 
7-rays in all directions, in GeV antiprotons, and in positrons above several GeV found in the 
conventional model indicate that the average high-energy proton flux in the Galaxy should 
be more intense or our reacceleration model is invalid or there is a contribution from uncon- 
ventional sources (e.g. dark matter). For more discussion of antiproton and positron tests 
see Section 7. 

In the "SNR source" scenario of Berezhko & Volk (2000) the 7-ray spectrum in the inner 
Galaxy is attributed to an additional population of unresolved SNR, but this component 
cannot explain the excess observed at high latitudes, and hardly in the outer Galaxy^. The 
presence of the GeV excess in all sky regions is also a problem for the suggestion by Aharonian 
k Atoyan (2000) of a hard proton spectrum in the inner Galaxy. These explanations are 
therefore by themselves insufiicient, although they could give a contribution. 



5. Hard electron injection spectrum model 

This model is essentially as in Strong et al. (2000), recomputed with the current GAL- 
PROP code. The main feature is the electron injection index of 1.9. Comparison of the 
spectra in the 7 sky areas (Fig. 7) show that this model reproduces the GeV excess except 
in the inner Galaxy (region A) where it is still too low. However the spectral shape is not 
well reproduced. More significant, comparing with the new EGRET data above 10 GeV 
in the inner Galaxy, the spectrum is much too hard. Fig. 3 compares the locally observed 
electron spectrum with that from the model; the deviation at high energies is much larger 
than expected from the 3D study by Strong & Moskalenko (2001b). As discussed in the 
Introduction, there are therefore a number of reasons to lead us to consider this model as 
after all untenable. 



^Berezhko &; Volk (2000) did not address the question of regions away from the inner Galaxy.

6. Optimized model 

Since the conventional model fails to reproduce the observed 7-ray spectrum, and the 
hard electron spectrum model is untenable, we use the diflFuse 7-rays themselves to obtain an 
optimized solution. The average interstellar electron spectrum is sufficiently uncertain that 
we can look for a "solution" involving a less drastic change in the electron injection spectrum 
than the hard electron injection spectrum model. We find that an injection spectrum of 
electrons with a steepening from 1.5 to 2.42 at 20 GeV (see Table 1) produces sufficient 
curvature in the inverse Compton spectrum to explain the observed shape of the 7-ray 
spectrum, provided the electron spectrum is suitable normalized upwards by a factor of about 
4 relative to the locally observed spectrum. The proton injection spectrum is also normalized 
upward, by a factor 1.8; it has the same shape as for the electrons, as a function of rigidity, 
but the break energy is 10 GeV instead of 20 GeV. It has exactly the same slope above 10 
GeV as the conventional proton spectrum. 

The 7-ray spectra in the 7 test regions are shown in Fig. 8. The fits to the observed 
7-ray spectra are better than for the conventional and hard electron spectrum models, both 
in the 1-10 GeV region and above 20 GeV. The spectra in different regions are satisfactorily 
reproduced and there is no longer a significant GeV excess. Hence the spectrum can now 
be reproduced from 30 MeV to 100 GeV. The proposed scenario implies a substantial con- 
tribution from IC at all energies, but especially below 100 MeV and above 1 GeV. Also IC 
dominates at latitudes |6| > 10° at all energies. 

Longitude profiles at low latitudes are shown in Fig. 9. The agreement with the EGRET 
data is generally good considering that the model does not attempt to include details of 
Galactic structure (e.g., spiral arms), and the systematic deviations reflect the lack of an 
exact fit to the spectra in Fig. 8. The largest deviation (~20%) is at 2-4 GeV, but this is still 
compatible with the systematic errors of the EGRET data. Latitude profiles in the longitude 
ranges 330° < I < 30°, 30° < Z < 330° are shown in Figs. 10, 11, where the logarithmic scale 
is chosen given the large dynamic range and to facilitate the comparison at high Galactic 
latitudes. The agreement with EGRET is again good, in particular the reproduction of the 
high-latitude variation confirms the importance of the IC component which is much broader 
than the gas-related 7r°-decay and bremsstrahlung emission. In the inner Galaxy (Fig. 10) 
there is evidence for an excess at intermediate latitudes, perhaps related to an underestimate 
of the interstellar radiation field in the Galactic halo, or special conditions in the Gould's 
Belt. The outer Galaxy latitude profiles (Fig. 11) are in excellent agreement with the data. 

The local electron spectrum (Fig. 3) is compatible with the direct measurement con- 
sidering fluctuations due to energy losses and stochastic sources and propagation (Strong &; 
Moskalenko 2001b), and in addition uncertainties in solar modulation at low energies. In 



- 12 



fact the agreement can be even better if we consider the uncertainty in the ISRF, which can 
well be a factor 2 higher than our estimate. The electron spectrum is consistent with the 
synchrotron spectral index data (Strong et al. 2000), since it differs from the conventional 
model essentially only in the normalization, and this is in turn consistent with synchrotron. 
The interstellar proton spectrum (Fig. 2) is also compatible with direct measurements; the 
factor 1.8 may be attributed to fluctuations over the Galaxy relative to the local value, and 
also to the uncertainty in the large-scale CR gradient. 

Below 30 MeV the predicted spectrum lies about a factor 2 below the COMPTEL 
data, as found previously (Strong et al. 2000). There we proposed that a contribution from 
compact sources is the most likely explanation. Recent results from INTEGRAL (Strong 
et al. 2003b) indeed indicate a large contribution from sources in the hard X-ray band, and 
this would be consistent with the MeV region marking a transition from source-dominated 
to diffuse-dominated ridge emission. 



7. Secondary antiprotons, positrons, electrons 

7.1. Tests of the nucleon spectrum 

A sensitive test of the proton spectrum using the p/p ratio has been proposed (Mos- 
kalenko et al. 1998) based on the fact that secondary antiprotons and 7-rays are produced 
in the same pp-interactions. Positrons are also produced in pp-coUisions and thus may be 
used to support the conclusions made from the antiproton test. While some deviation from 
the locally-observed spectrum of primary protons is acceptable, secondary antiprotons (and 
partly positrons) trace the primary proton spectrum on scales up to ~10 kpc over the Galaxy, 
and hence allow us to put limits on deviations from the local measurements. 

As was noted in Strong et al. (2000) and Moskalenko et al. (2003, and references therein), 
the "GeV excess" in 7-rays and underproduction of antiprotons in the reacceleration model 
may indicate that the nucleon spectrum typical of large regions of the Galaxy differs mod- 
erately from the local measurements. The problem with secondary antiprotons in the reac- 
celeration model has been extensively discussed in Moskalenko et al. (2002, 2003). It is 
apparent that if the solution of the 7-ray GeV excess can not be found in modifications of 
the electron spectrum alone, the required modifications in the nucleon spectrum must satisfy 
the constraints from both antiprotons and positrons. 

Figs. 5 and 6 show the antiproton and positron fluxes as calculated in the conventional 
and optimized models. The modifications of the nucleon spectrum introduced in the op- 
timized model appear to be exactly what is required to reproduce the antiproton data ! 



13 



This in fact supports the factor 1.8 in the proton flux required for 7-rays, and the positron 
spectrum also agrees at high energies. At low energies the calculated positron spectrum is 
rather high but the solar modulation is a factor of ~1000 at these energies, and besides the 
scatter in the positron data may indicate large systematic errors. 



7.2. Gamma-rays from secondary positrons and electrons 

Secondary positrons in CR produced in interactions of energetic nucleons with interstel- 
lar gas are usually considered a minor component of CR. This is indeed so in the heliosphere 
where the positron to all-lepton ratio is small at all energies, e^ jttot ~ 0.1. However, the 
secondary positron flux in the interstellar medium is comparable to the electron flux at 
relatively low energies ~1 GeV because of the steeper spectrum of secondary positrons. 

The spectrum of secondary positrons and electrons depends only on the ambient spec- 
trum of nucleons and the adopted propagation model. Figs. 3, 6 show the spectra of electrons 
and secondary positrons for the conventional and optimized models. Secondary positrons 
contribute about half of the total lepton flux at ~1 GeV. Secondary electrons add up another 
10% (Fig. 12). This leads to a considerable contribution of secondary positrons and electrons 
to the diffuse 7-ray flux via IC scattering and bremsstrahlung and significantly increases the 
flux of diffuse Galactic 7-rays in MeV range. Therefore, secondary positrons (and electrons) 
in CR can be directly traced in 7-rays! 

Fig. 13 shows the contribution of secondary positrons and electrons to the IC emission 
and bremsstrahlung. Secondaries contribute more than 20% of the total IC in the 1-10 MeV 
energy range. More dramatic is the case of bremsstrahlung, where secondaries contribute 
about 60% of the total below ~200 MeV. It is the contribution of secondaries which improves 
the agreement with data below some 100 MeV. 



8. Discussion of uncertainties 

We now discuss the uncertainties which may eff^ectively cause the proposed deviations 
from the locally observed proton and electron spectra. Those most probable are the uncer- 
tainties in the 7r°-production in pp-collisions at relatively low energies, heliospheric modula- 
tion, and our evaluation of the ISRF. 

Mori (1997, and references therein) has re-evaluated the 7r° -production in pp-coUisions 
using modern Monte Carlo event generators HADRIN, PYTHIA, and FRITIOF. The HADRIN 
code, which is designed to reproduce nuclear collisions at laboratory energies below 5 GeV 



-14- 



and describes the threshold and resonance behavior of inelastic hadron-nucleon interactions, 
shows good agreement with isobar model calculations (Stecker 1970) at proton kinetic en- 
ergy Tp = 0.97 GeV. The isobar model is shown to reproduce the data on the secondary 
7r°-production at low energies, in particular, at Tp = 0.56, 0.65, 0.97, 2.0 GeV (Dermer 1986, 
and references therein). However, the data on Tr'^-production at GeV energies are now 40 
years old, they have large statistical errors and are very scattered indicating possibly large 
systematic uncertainties. Given the lack of new data, the deviations from the isobar model 
calculations by a factor of ~2 would be also consistent with the old data. However, the 
comparison to the Galactic diffuse 7-ray emission is now rather precise, and the uncertainty 
in the 7r°-production at low energies may be critical. Our required flattening of the proton 
spectrum below 10 GeV could thus be understood as a compensation for errors in the tt'^- 
production physics. At high energies, a comparison of Badhwar, Stephens, & Golden (1977) 
and Stephens k Badhwar (1981) scaling model with resuls of PYTHIA and FRITIOF shows 
generally a good agreement, but all of them overpredict the cross sections at high rapidities. 
Though it may result in systematic uncertainties of the 7-ray flux above ~100 GeV, this, 
however, is of less concern given the large error bars in the EGRET data in this energy 
range. 

Our knowledge of the heliospheric modulation is still incomplete, and it remains the 
source of a large uncertainty in the propagation models. Over the last years Ulysses made 
its measurements at different heliolatitudes so we know more about the solar magnetic field 
configuration and the solar wind velocity distribution. However the modulation parameters 
are usually still determined based on the assumed ad hoc interstellar nucleon spectrum. 
Estimates of the modulation made using the simplest force-field approximation show that 
the modulation changes the proton intensity below 1 GeV by a factor of 10 (Fig. 2), and by 
a factor of 100-1000 in case of electrons and positrons (Figs. 3, 6). This makes it difficult 
to speculate about the reasons for deviations of the calculated spectrum from the measured 
one by a factor of a few at low energies. 

For the calculation of the spectrum of 7-rays arising from IC scattering and electron 
energy losses, the full ISRF as function of position and wavelength is required, which was not 
available in the literature. The ISRF was evaluated in Strong et al. (2000) using emissivities 
based on stellar populations and dust emission. Given the complicated and uncertain input 
in this calculation a factor of two error is quite possible. The inaccuracies in the ISRF 
are compensated in our model by adjustment of the CR electron flux. Therefore, if the 
ISRF energy density is in reality higher, it will result in lower normalization of the electron 
injection spectrum making it closer to the local one. 

Finally, due to the random nature of SN explosions the CR spectrum fluctuates in space 



15 



and time (see simulations in Strong & Moskalenko 2001a). Further, since more CR sources 
are concentrated in the spiral arms (e.g., Case &: Bhattacharya 1996), the CR intensity in 
the arms might be higher. Both these effects can cause the locally measured CR intensity 
to differ from the large-scale average by the required factor of 2-4. 



9. Conclusions 

We have revisited the compatibility of diffuse Galactic continuum 7-ray models with 
the EGRET data. We confirm that the "conventional model" based on the locally observed 
electron spectrum is inadequate, for all sky regions. A conventional model plus hard sources 
in the inner Galaxy is also inadequate, since this cannot explain the excess outside of the 
Galactic plane. Models with a hard electron injection spectrum, while reproducing the 
EGRET spectrum in the few GeV region over much of the skj^, are not compatible with 
the locally observed electron spectrum (the expected fluctuations are not sufficient) and are 
inconsistent with EGRET data above 10 GeV. 

A new model, with relatively mild deviations of the electron and proton spectra from 
local, is shown give a good reproduction of the diffuse 7-ray sky. The agreement extends 
from 30 MeV to 100 GeV. It also gives a very good representation of the latitude distribution 
of the emission from the plane to the poles, and of the longitude distribution. IC emission 
is a major component of the diffuse emission and dominates outside the Galactic plane and 
at energies below 100 MeV. The model reproduces simultaneously the 7-rays, synchrotron, 
CR secondary /primary ratios, antiprotons and positrons. In this sense it goes a long way 
towards realizing our original goal, stated in Strong et al. (2000), to reproduce astronomical 
and directly-measured data on cosmic rays in the context of a single model of the high-energy 
Galaxy. 

Based on the optimized model, a new EGRB spectrum has been derived (Strong et 
al. 2004) which is lower and steeper than found by Sreekumar et al. (1998); it is barely 
consistent with a power-law, and shows some positive curvature. 

We would like to particularly thank David Bertsch for assistance and discussions on 
the subject of the events and instrumental response of the EGRET telescope above 10 GeV

A. Description of H I and CO data 

The H I and CO data used in this work are based on more recent surveys than those 
used in Strong & Mattox (1996) and Strong et al. (2000). They were provided by S. Digel 
(private communication) who provided the following description. 

The annular maps are generated for 8 ranges of Galactocentric distance on the assump- 
tion of uniform circular rotation with the rotation curve of Clemens (1985) parameterized 
for Rq = 8.5 kpc, Vq = 220 km/s. Emission beyond the terminal velocity is assigned to the 
tangent point, and emission at slightly forbidden velocities in the outer Galaxy is assigned 
to the local annulus (7.5-9.5 kpc). The longitude ranges within 10° of / = and I = 180° 
are excluded from the integrations in all annuli. The boundaries of the of Galactocentric 
distance annuli are 1.5, 3.5, 5.5, 7.5, 9.5, 11.5, 13.5, 15.5, 50 kpc. 

The CO data are from the 115 GHz line survey of Dame et al. (1987) and the latitude 
range is |6| < 25°. The coverage is not complete within this latitude range but little or 
no significant CO emission is believed to be missed. The maps are of CO line intensity 
integrated over the (longitude-dependent) velocity range of each annulus and they have 
angular resolution 0.5° x 0.5° (set by the sampling pattern of the constituent surveys; see 
Dame et al. 1987). The units are velocity integrated radiation temperature (Wco), corrected 
to the intensity scale of Bronfman et al. (1988), in K km/s. 

The H I data are a composite of several 21-cm line surveys (Table 3), which were 
interpolated to a uniform grid. Calibrations were checked against the Bell Labs H I horn 
survey of Stark et al. (1992). Brightness temperatures T{, were converted to column densities 
of atomic hydrogen on the assumption Tgpin = 125 K uniformly. The few positions with % > 
110 K had Tf, truncated to 110 K. The maps have units of column density N(lii i)/10^° atom 
cm~^. Angular resolution is somewhat better than 1° and the maps extend to \b\ = 40°. 

The Wco and iV(H i) maps described above were generated in 1996 using the then best 
available surveys of CO and H I. Since that time, surveys with greater coverage, angular 
resolution, sensitivity, and improved calibration have been published, see Dame et al. (2001) 
and Burton et al. (1994). However these improvements would hardly affect the results 
presented in this paper.

Fig. 13. — 7-ray spectrum of optimized model with (thick Unes) and without (thin hues) 
primary electrons, to show the contribution of secondary electrons and positrons. Brtot and 
Br2 labels denote the total bremsstrahlung and the separate contribution from secondary 
leptons, correspondingly. Similarly, ICtot, IC2 indicate the total IC and the contribution 
from secondaries.
