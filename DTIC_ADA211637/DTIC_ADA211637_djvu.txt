INTRODUCTION 


This Validation Summary Report (VSR) describes the extent to which a 
specific Ada compiler conforms to the Ada Standard, ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A. 
This report explains all technical terms used within it and thoroughly 
reports the results of testing this compiler using the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability j(ACVC). An Ada compiler must be implemented 
according to the Ada Standard, and any implementation-dependent features 
must conform to the requirements of the Ada Standard.' The Ada Standard 
must be implemented in its entirety, and nothing can be implemented that is 
not in the Standard. 

Even though all validated Ada compilers conform to the Ada Standard, it 
must be understood that some differences do exist between implementations. 
The Ada Standard permits some implementation dependencies—for example, the 
maximum length of identifiers or the maximum values of integer types. 
Other differences between compilers result from the characteristics of 
particular operating systems, hardware, or implementation strategies. All 
the dependencies observed during the process of testing this compiler are 
given in this report. 

The information in this report is derived from the test results produced 
during validation testing. The validation process includes submitting a 
suite of standardized tests, the ACVC, as inputs to an Ada compiler and 
evaluating the results. The purpose of validating is to ensure conformity 
of the compiler to the Ada Standard by testing that the compiler properly 
implements legal language constructs and that it identifies and rejects 
illegal language constructs. The testing also identifies behavior that is 
implementation-dependent but is permitted by the Ada Standard. Six classes 
of tests are used. These tests are designed to perform checks at compile 
time, at link time, and during execution.

INTRODUCTION 


1.1 PURPOSE OF THIS VALIDATION SUMMARY REPORT 

This VSR documents the results of the validation testing performed on an 
Ada compiler. Testing was carried out for the following purposes: 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs supported by the 
compiler that do not conform to the Ada Standard 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs not supported by 
the compiler but required by the Ada Standard 

. To determine that the implementation-dependent behavior is allowed 
by the Ada Standard 

Testing of this compiler was conducted by SofTech, Inc. under the 
direction of the AVF according to procedures established by the Ada Joint 
Program Office and administered by the Ada Validation Organization (AVO). 
On-site testing was completed 10 June 89 at Aloha OR.

Passed test An ACVC test for which a compiler generates the expected 
result. 

Target The computer for which a compiler generates code. 

Test A program that checks a compiler's conformity regarding a 

particular feature or a combination of features to the Ada 
Standard. In the context of this report, the term is used to 
designate a single test, which may comprise one or more 
files. 

An ACVC test found to be incorrect and not used to check 
conformity to the Ada Standard. A test may be incorrect 
because it has an invalid test objective, fails to meet its 
test objective, or contains illegal or erroneous use of the 
language. 


1.5 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conformity to the Ada Standard is measured using the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains both legal and illegal Ada programs structured into six test 
classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies 
the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable, 
and special program units are used to report their results during 
execution. Class B tests are expected to produce compilation errors. 
Class L tests are expected to produce compilation or link errors because of 
the way in which a program library is used at link time. 

Class A tests ensure the successful compilation of legal Ada programs with 
certain language constructs which cannot be verified at compile time. 
There are no explicit program components in a Class A test to check 
semantics. For example, a Class A test checks that reserved words of 
another language (other than those already reserved in the Ada language) 
are not treated as reserved words by an Ada compiler. A Class A test is 
passed if no errors are detected at compile time and the program executes 
to produce a PASSED message. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that every syntax or 
semantic error in the test is dete'’ted. A Class B test is passed if every

INTRODUCTION 


illegal construct that it contains is detected by the compiler. 

Class C tests check the run time system to ensure that legal Ada programs 
can be correctly compiled and executed. Each Class C test is self-checking 
and produces a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result when it is executed. 

Class D tests check the compilation and execution capacities of a compiler. 
Since there are no capacity requirements placed on a compiler by the Ada 
Standard for some parameters—for example, the number of identifiers 
permitted in a compilation or the number of units in a library—a compiler 
may refuse to compile a Class D test and still be a conforming compiler. 
Therefore, if a Class D test fails to compile because the capacity of the 
compiler is exceeded, the test is classified as inapplicable. If a Class D 
test compiles successfully, it is self-checking and produces a PASSED or 
FAILED message during execution. 

Class E tests are expected to execute successfully and check 
implementation-dependent options and resolutions of ambiguities in the Ada 
Standard. Each Class E test is self-checking and produces a NOT 
APPLICABLE, PASSED, or FAILED message when it is compiled and executed. 
However, the Ada Standard permits an implementation to reject programs 
containing some features addressed by Class E tests during compilation. 
Therefore, a Class E test is passed- by a compiler if it is compiled 
successfully and executes to produce a PASSED message, or if it is rejected 
by the compiler for an allowable reason. 

Class L tests check that incomplete or illegal Ada programs involving 
multiple, separaltly compiled units are detected and not allowed to 
execute. Class L tests are compiled separately and execution is attempted. 
A Class L test passes if it is rejected at link time—that is, an attempt 
to execute the main program must generate an error message before any 
declarations in the main program or any units referenced by the main 
program are elaborated. In some cases, an implementation may legitimately 
detect errors during compilation of the test. 

Two library units, the package REPORT and the procedure CHECK_FILE, support 
the self-checking features of the executable tests. The package REPORT 
provides the mechanism by which executable tests report PASSED, FAILED, or 
NOT APPLICABLE results. It also provides a set of identity functions used 
to defeat some compiler optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that 
would circumvent a test objective. The procedure CHECK FILE is used to 
check the contents of text files written by some of the Class C tests for 
chapter 14 of the Ada Standard. The operation of<<REPORT and CHECK_FILE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. These tests produce Diessages that 
are examined to verify that the units are operating correctly. If these 
units are not operating correctly, then the validation is not attempted. 

The text of each test in the ACVC follows conventions that are intended to 
ensure that the tests are reasonably portable without modification. For 
example, the tests make use of only the basic set of 55 characters, contain 
lines with a maximum length of 72 characters, use small numeric values, and 
place features that may not be supported by all implementations in separate

INTRODUCTION 


tests. However, some tests contain values that require the test to be 
customized according to implementation-specific values — for example, an 
illegal file name. A list of the values used for this validation is 
provided in Appendix C. 

A compiler must correctly process each of the tests in the suite and 
demonstrate conformity to the Ada Standard by either meeting tne pass 
criteria given for the test or by shoving that the test is inapplicable to 
the implementation. The applicability of a test to an implementation is 
considered each time the implementation is validated. A test that is 
inapplicable for one validation is not necessarily inapplicable for a 
subsequent validation. Any test that was determined to contain an illegal 
language construct or an erroneous language construct is withdrawn from the 
ACVC and, therefore, is not used in testing a compiler. The tests 
withdrawn at the time of this validation are given in Appendix D.

Communications Network: RS232 Serial Port 


2.2 IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS 

One of the purposes of validating compilers is to determine the behavior of 
a compiler in those areas of the Ada Standard that permit implementations 
to differ. Class D and E tests specifically check for such implementation 
differences. However, tests in other classes also characterize an 
implementation. The tests demonstrate the following characteristics: 


a. Capacities. 


(1) The compiler correctly processes a compilation containing 723 
variables in the same declarative part. (See test D29002K.) 

(2) The compiler correctly processes tests containing loop 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See tests D55A03A..H (8 
tests).) 

(3) The compiler correctly processes tests containing block 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See test D56001B.) 

(4) The compiler correctly processes tests containing recursive 
procedures separately compiled as subunits nested to 17 
levels. (See tests D64005E..G (3 tests).) 


b. Predefined types. 

(1) This implementation supports the additional predefined types 
TINY_INTEGER, SHORT_FLOAT, and SHORT_INTEGER in package 
STANDARD. (See tests B86001T..Z (7 tests).) 


c. Expression evaluation. 

The order in which expressions are evaluated and the time at which 
constraints are checked are not defined by the language. While 
the ACVC tests do not specifically attempt to determine the order 
of evaluation of expressions, test results indicate the following: 

(1) None of the default initialization expressions for record 
components are evaluated before any value is checked for 
membership in a component's subtype. (See test C32117A.) 


(2) Assignments for subtypes are performed with the same precision 
as the base type. (See test C35712B.) 









CONFIGURATION INFORK; TION 


(3) This implementation uses no extra bits for extra precision and 
uses all extra bits for extra range. (See test C35903A.) 

(4) Sometimes CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised when an integer literal 
operand in a comparison or membership test is outside the 
range of the base type. (See test C45232A.) 

(5) Sometimes NUMERIC ERROR is raised when a literal operand in a 
fixed-point comparison or membership test is outside the range 
of the base type. (See test C45252A.) 

(6) Underflow is gradual. (See tests C45524A..Z.) 


d. Rounding. 

The method by which values are rounded in type conversions is not 
defined by the language. Vhile the ACVC tests do not specifically 
attempt to determine the method of rounding, the test results 
indicate the following: 

(1) The method used for rounding to integer is round to even. 
(See tests C46012A..Z.) 

(2) The method used for rounding to longest integer is round to 
even. (See tests C46012A..Z.) 

(3) The method used for rounding to integer in static universal 
real expressions is round to even. (See test C4A014A.) 


e. Array types. 

An implementation is allowed to raise NUMERIC_ERROR or 
CONSTRAINT_ERROR for an array having a 'LENGTH that exceeds 
STANDARD.INTEGER'LAST and/or SYSTEM.MAX INT. 


For this implementation: 


(1) Declaration of an array type or subtype declaration with more 
tha’f STF.M.MAX_INT components raises no exception. (See test 
C?^- -.A.) 

(2) NUMERI” ERROR is raised when 'LENGTH is applied to a null 

array 'pe with INTEGER'LAST + 2 components. (See test 

'3620/;*.) 


(3) NUMERIC_ERR0R is raised when 'LENGTH is applied to a null 
array type with SYSTEM.MAX_INT + 2 components. (See test 

C36202B.) 


2-3 





CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(4) A packed BOOLEAN array having a 'LENGTH exceeding INTEGER'LAST 
raises NUMERIC_ERROR when the array type is declared. (See 
test C52103X.) 

(5) A packed two-dimensional BOOLEAN array with more than 
INTEGER'LAST components raises NUMERIC_ERROR when the array 
type is declared. (See test C52104Y.) 

(6) A null array with one dimension of length greater than 

INTEGER'LAST may raise NUMERIC_ERROR or CONSTRAINT_ERROR 
either when declared or assigned. Alternatively, an 

implementation may accept the declaration. However, lengths 
must match in array slice assignments. This implementation 
raises NUMERIC_ERROR when the array type is declared. (See 
test E52103y.) 

(7) In assigning one-dimensional array types, the expression is 
evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

(8) In assigning two-dimensional array types, the expression is 
not evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is 
raised when checking whether the expression's subtype is 
compatible with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


f. Discriminated types. 

(1) In assigning record types with discriminants, the expression 
is evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


g. Aggregates. 

(1) In the evaluation of a multi-dimensional aggregate, all 
choices are evaluated before checking against the index type. 
(See tests C43207A and C43207B.) 

(2) In the evaluation of an aggregate containing subaggregates, 
all choices are evaluated before being checked for identical 
bounds. (See test E43212B.) 

(3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised after all choices are evaluated 
when a bound in a non-null range of a non-null aggregate does 
not belong to an index subtype. (See test E43211B.) 


2-4 







CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


h. Pragmas. 

(1) The pragma INLINE is supported for functions and procedures. 
(See tests LA3004A..B, EA3004C..D, and CA3004E..F.) 


i. Generics 

(1) Generic specifications and bodies can be compiled in separate 
compilations. (See tests CA1012A, CA2009C, CA2009F, BC3204C, 
and BC3205D.) 

(2) Generic unit bodies and their subunits can be compiled in 
separate compilations. (See test CA3011A.) 


j. Input and output 

(1) The package SEQUENTIAL_IO can be instantiated with 
unconstrained array types and record types with discriminants 
without defaults. (See tests AE2101C, EE2201D, and EE2201E.) 

(2) The package DIRECT_I0 can be instantiated with unconstrained 
array types and record types with discriminants without 
defaults. (See tests AE2101H, EE2401D, and EE2401G.)

DIRECT 10. (See tests CE2102F, CE2102I..J, CE2102R, CE2102T, 
and CEI102V.) 

(5) Modes IN_FILE and 0UT_FILE are supported for text files. (See 
tests CE3102E and CE3102I..K.) 

(6) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for SEQUENTIAL_I0. 
(See tests CE2102G and CE2102X.) 

(7) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for DIRECT_I0. (See 
tests CE2102K and CE2102Y.) 

(8) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for text files. 
(See tests CE3102F..G, CE3104C, CE3110A, and CE3114A.) 

(9) Overwriting to a sequential file truncates to the last element 
written. (See test CE2208B.) 

(10) Temporary sequential files are given names and deleted when 
closed. (See test CE2108A.)

CHAPTER 3 


TEST INFORMATION 


3.1 TEST RESULTS 

Version 1.10 of the ACVC comprises 3717 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, 44 tests had been withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF 
determined that 344 tests were inapplicable to this implementation. All 
inapplicable tests were processed during validation testing except for 201 
executable tests that use floating-point precision exceeding that supported 
by the implementation. Modifications to the code, processing, or grading 
for 10 tests were required to successfully demonstrate the test objective. 
(See section 3.6.) 

The AVF concludes that the testing results demonstrate acceptable 
conformity to the Ada Standard.

3.5 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

Some tests do not apply to all compilers because they make use of features 
that a compiler is not required by the Ada Standard to support. Others may 
depend on the result of another test that is either inapplicable or 
withdrawn. The applicability of a test to an implementation is considered 
each time a validation is attempted. A test that is inapplicable for one 
validation attempt is not necessarily inapplicable for a subsequent 
attempt. For this validation attempt, 344 tests were inapplicable for the 
reasons indicated: 


a. The following 201 tests are not applicable because they have 
floating-point type declarations requiring more digits than 
SYSTEM.MAX DIGITS:

B86001W 


CD7101F 

d. C45531M..P (4 tests) and C45532M..P (4 tests) are not applicable 

because the value of SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA is less than 47. 

e. C86001F is not applicable because, for this implementation, the 
package TEXT_IO is dependent upon package SYSTEM. These tests 
recompile package SYSTEM, making package TEXT_I0, and hence 
package REPORT, obsolete. 

f. B86001Y is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined fixed-point type other than DURATION. 

g. B86001Z is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined floating-point type with a name other than FLOAT, 
LONG_FLOAT, or SHORT_FLOAT. 

h. C96005B is not applicable because there are no values of type 
DURATION'BASE that are outside the range of DURATION. 

i. CD1009C, CD2A41A..B (2 tests), CD2A41E, and CD2A42A..J (10 tests) 
are not applicable because this implementation does not support 
size clauses for floating point types. Hardware floating point 
instructions require IEEE 32/64 bit floating point representation, 

j. CD2A61I and CD2A61J are not applicable because this implementation 
does not support size clauses for array types, which imply 
compression, with component types of composite or floating point 
types. This implementation requires an explicit size clause on 
the component type. 

k. CD2A84B..I (8 tests) and CD2A84K..L (2 tests) are not applicable 
because this implementation does not support size clauses for 
access types. Access types are represented by machine addresses 
which are 32 bits on this machine. 

l. CD2A91A..E (5 tests), CD5012J, CD5013S, and CD5014S are not 

applicable because this implementation does not support size 
clauses for tasks or task types. 

m. The following 42 tests are not applicable because this 
implementation does not support an address clause when a dynamic

attempted. 

aj. CE2107G..H (2 tests), CE2110D, and CE2111H are not applicable 

because multiple internal files cannot be associated with the same 
external file when one or more files is writing for direct files. 
The proper exception is raised when multiple access is attempted.

is writing for sequential files. The proper exception is raised 
when multiple access is attempted. 

al. CE3111B, CE3111D..E (2 tests), CE3114B, and CE3115A are not 

applicable because multiple internal files cannot be associated 
with the same external file when one or more files is writing for 
text files. The proper exception is raised when multiple access 
is attempted. 


3.6 TEST, PROCESSING, AND EVALUATION MODIFICATIONS 

It is expected that some tests will require modifications of code, 
processing, or evaluation in order to compensate for legitimate 
implementation behavior. Modifications are made by the AVF in cases where 
legitimate implementation behavior prevents the successful completion of an 
(otherwise) applicable test. Examples of such modifications include: 
adding a length clause to alter the default size of a collection; splitting 
a Class B test into subtests so that all errors are detected; and 
confirming that messages produced by an executable test demonstrate 
conforming behavior that wasn't anticipated by the test (such as raising 
one exception instead of another). 


3-5 








TEST INFORMATION 


Modifications were required for 10 tests. 


The following tests were split because syntax errors at one point resulted 
in the compiler not detecting other errors in the test:

3.7 ADDITIONAL TESTING INFORMATION 


3.7.1 Prevalidation 

Prior to validation, a set of test results for ACVC Version 1.10 produced 
by the VADS VAX VMS -> 68K (68000) was submitted to the AVF by the 
applicant for review. Analysis of these results demonstrated that the 
compiler successfully passed all applicable tests, and the compiler 
exhibited the expected behavior on all inapplicable tests. 


3.7.2 Test Method 


Testing of the VADS VAX VMS -> 68K (68000) using ACVC Version 1.10 was 
conducted on-site by a validation team from the AVF. The configuration in 
which the testing was performed is described by the following designations 
of hardware and software components: 


Host computer: 

Host operating system: 
Target computer: 

Target operating system: 
Compiler: 


MicroVax 3600 
VMS, 5.0 
GPC68000 board 
bare board 

VADS VAX VMS -> 68K (68000), Version 5.7 


The host and target computers were linked via RS232 Serial Port. 


A magnetic tape containing all tests except for withdrawn tests and tests 
requiring unsupported floating-point precisions was taken on-site by the 
validation team for processing. Tests that make use of 
implementation-specific values were customized before being written to the 
magnetic tape. Tests requiring modifications during the prevalidation 
testing were included in their modified form on the magnetic tape. 

The contents of the magnetic tape were loaded directly onto the host 
computer. 


After the test files were loaded to disk, the full set of tests was 
compiled and linked on the MicroVax 3600, then all executable images were 
transferred to the GPC68000 board via RS232 Serial Port and run. Results 
were printed from the host computer.

TEST INFORMATION 


The compiler vas tested using command scripts provided by Verdix 
Corporation and reviewed by the validation team. The compiler was tested 
using all default option settings except for the following: 

OPTION EFFECT 


-V Suppress generation of warning messages. 

Tests were compiled, linked, and executed (as appropriate) using a single 
host and target computer. Test output, compilation listings, and job logs 
were captured on magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings 
examined on-site by the validation team were also archived. 


3.7.3 Test Site 

Testing was conducted at Aloha OR and was completed on 10 June 89.

APPENDIX F. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics - VAX'V MS->68k 


1. Impiementation*Dcpendeiit Pragmas 

1.1. INLINE_ONLY Pragma 

The 1NLINE_0NLY pragma, when used in the same way as pragmt. INLINE, indicates to the compiler 
that the subimgram must always be inlined. This pragma al^ suppresses the generation of a callable 
version of the routine which saves code space. If a user erroneously makes an INLINE_ONLY subpro¬ 
gram recuisive a warning message will be emitted and an PROGRAM_ERROR will be raised at rtm 
time. 

1.2. BUILT_IN Pragma 

The BUILT_IN pragma is used in the implementation of sonte predefined Ada packages, but provides 
no user access. It is used only to implement code bodies for which no actual Ada body can be pro¬ 
vided, for example the MACHn^_CX)DE package. 

U. SHARE_CODE Pragma 

The SHAR£_CODE pragma takes the name of a generic instantiation or a generic unit as the first argu¬ 
ment and one of the identifiers TRUE or FALSE as the second argument. This pragma is. only allowed 
immediately at the place of a declarative item in a declarative part or package specification, or after a 
library unit in a compilation, but before any subsequent compilation unit. 

When the first argument is a generic unit the pragma applies to ail instantiations of that generic. When 
the first argument is the name of a genetic instantiation the pragma applies only to the specified insian- 
oadon, or overloaded instantiations. 

If the second argument is TRUE the compiler will try to share code generated for a gt ■. antia- 
tion with code generated for other instantiations of ^e same generic. When the seccnu argiuneni is 
FALSE each instandation will get a unique copy of the generated code. The extent to which code is 
shared between instantiations depends on this pragma and the land of generic formal parameters 
declared for the generic uniL 

The name pragma SHARE^BODY is also recognized by the implementation and has the same effect as 
SHARE_CODE. It is included for compatability with earlier versions of VADS. 

1.4. NO_IMaGE Pragma 

The pragma suppresses the generation of the image array used for the IMAGE attribute of enumeration 
types. This elintinates the overhead required to store the array in the executable image. An attempt to 
use the IMAGE attribute on a type whose image array has been suppressed will result in a compilation 
warning and PROGRAM_ERROR raised at run time. 

U. EXTERNAL^NAME Pragma 

The EXTERNAL_NAME pragma takes the name of a subprogram or variable defined in Ada and 
allows the user to specify a different external name that may be used to reference the entity from other 
languages. The pragma is allowed at the place of a deci^tive item in a package specification and 
' must apply to an objea declared earlier in the same package specification. 


B-2 










U. INTERFACE_NAME Pragma 

The INTERFACE_NAME pragma takes the name of a a variable or subprogram defined in another 
language and allows it to be referenced directly in Ada. The pragma will replace all occurrences of the 
variable or subprogram name with an external reference to the second, link_argument. The pragma is 
allowed at the place of a declarative item in a package specification and must apply to an objea or sub¬ 
program declared earlier in the same package specification. The objea must be declared as a scalar or 
an access type. The objea cannot be any of the following: 
a loop variable, 
a constant, 

an initialized variable, 
an array, or 
a record. 

1.7. IMPLICTT_CODE Pragma 

Takes one of the idendfiecs ON or OFF as the single argument This pragma is only allowed within a 
machine code procedure. It specifies that implicit code generated by the compiler be allowed or disal¬ 
lowed. A warning is issued if OFF is used and any implicit code needs to be generated. The default is 
ON. 

IJ. OPTIMIZE_CODE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argumenL This pragma is only allowed within a 
machine code procedure. It ^tedfies whether the code should be optimized by the compiler. The 
default is ON. When OFF is specified, the compiler will generate the code as spedfied. 

2. Implementation at Predefined Pragmas 

2.1. CONTROLLED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no effect. 

2.2. ELABORATE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the Ada RM. 

2J. INLINE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the Ada RM. 

2.4. INTERFACE 

This pragma supports calls to ’C’ and FORTRAN functions. The Ada subprograms can be either func¬ 
tions or procedures. The types of parameters and the result type for functions must be scalar, access or 
the predefined type ADDRESS in SYSTEM. All parameters must have mode IN. Record and array 
objects can be passed by reference using the ADDRESS attribute. 

2.5. LIST 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the Ada RM 

2.6. MEMORY_SIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The implementation does not allow SYSTEM to be 
modified by means of pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.7. NON_REENTRANT 

This pragma takes one argument which can be the name of either a library subprogram or a subprogram 
declared immediately within a library package spec or body. It indicates to the compiler that the sub¬ 
program will not be called recursively allowing the compiler to perform specific optimizations. The 
pragma can be applied to a subprogram or a set of overloaded subprograsm within a package spec or 


B-3 









package body. 


:j. not elaborated 

This pragma can only appear in a library package specification. It indicates that the package will not 
be elaborated because it is either pan of the RTS. a configurauon package or an Ada package that is 
referenced from a language other than Ada. The presence of this pragma suppresses the generauon of 
elaboration code and issues wammgs if elaborauon code is required. 

2.9. OPTIMIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no effect. 

2.10. PACK 

This pragma will cause the compiler to choose a non-aligned representation for composite types. It will 
not causes objects to be packed at the bit level. 

2.11. PAGE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the Ada RM. 

2.12. PASSIVE 

The pragma has three forms : 

PRAGMA PASSIVE; 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(SEMAPHORE); 

PRAGMA PASSIVEONTERRUPT. <numbcr>); 

This pragma Pragma passive can be applied to a task or task type declared immediately within a library 
package spec or body. The pragma directs the compiler to optimize certain tasking operations. It is 
possible that the statements in a task body will prevent the intended optimization, in these cases a warn¬ 
ing will be generated at compile time and will raise TASKING_ERROR at nmdme. 

2.13. PRIORITY 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the Ada RM. 

2.14. SHARED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no effecL 

2.15. STORAGE_UNIT 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The implementation does not allow SYSTEM to be 
modified by means of pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.16. SUPPRESS 

This pragma is impiemenied as described, except that RANGE_CHECK and DIVISION_CHECK can¬ 
not be supressed. 

2.17. SYSTEM_NAME 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The implementadon does not allow SYSTEM to be 
modified by means of pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

3. Implementation-Dependent Attributes 
3.1. P’REF 

For a prefix that denotes an object, a program unit, a label, or an entry; 





This attribute denotes the effective address of the fint of the storage units allocated to P, For a subpro¬ 
gram, package, task unit, or label, it refers to the address of the machine code associated with the 
corresponding body or statement. For an entry for which an address clause has been given, it refers to 
the corresponding hardware intemipL The attribute is of the type OPERA.ND defined in the package 
MACHIN£_CODE. The attribute is only allowed within a machine code procedure. 

See section F.4.8 for mote information on the use of this attribute. 


(For a package, task unit, or entry, the ’REF attribute is not supported.)

5. Restrictions On Representation Clauses 


B-5 
















5.1. Pragma PACK 

In the absence of pragma PACK record components are padded so as to provide for efficient access by 
the target hardware, pragma PACK applied to a record eliminate the padding where possible. Pragma 
PACK has no other effect on the storage allocated for recod components a record representation is 
required. 

5.2. Size Clauses 

For scalar types a representaiion clause will pack to the number of bits required to represent the range 
of the subtype. A size clause applied to a record type will not cause packing of components; an expli¬ 
cit record r epre s entation clause must be given to specify the packing of the components. A size clause 
applied to a record type will cause packing of components only when the component type is a discrete 
type. An error will be issued if there is insufficient space allocated. The SIZE attribute is not sup¬ 
ported for task, access, or floating point types. 

S3. Address Clauses 

Address clauses are only supported for variables. Sirtce default initialization of a variable requires 
evaluadon of the variable addr^ elaboradon ordering requirements prohibit inidtalizadon of a variables 
which have address clauses. The specified address indicates the physical address associated with the 
variable. 

5.4. iDtarupts 

Intenipt entries are not supported. 

5 Representation Attributes 

The ADDRESS attribute is not supported for the following entities: 

Packages 

Tasks 

Labels 

Entries 

Sj6. Machine Code Insertions 
Machine code insertions are supported. 

The general defirudon of the package MACHINE_CODE provides an assembly language interface for 
the target machine. It provides the necessary record type(s) needed in the code statement, an enumera¬ 
tion type of all the opcode mneumonics, a set of register definitions, and a set of addressing mode func¬ 
tions. 

The general syntax of a machine code statement is as follows: 

CODE_/j’( opcode, operand {, operand} ); 
where n indicates the number of operands in the aggregate. 

A special case arises for a variable number of operands. The operands are listed within a subaggregate. 
The fonnat is as follows: 

CODE_N’( opcode, (operand {, operand]) ); 

For those opcodes that require no operands, named notation must be used (cf. RM 4.3(4)). 

CODE_0’( op => opcode ); 


B-6 






The opcode must be an enumeration literal (i.e. it cannot be an object, attribute, or a rename). 

An operand can only be an entity defined in MACHINE_CODE or the ’REF attribute. 

The arguments to any of the functions defined in MACHINE_CODE must be SDdc expressions, string 
literals, or the funcnons defined in MACHIN£_CODE. The 'REF attribute may not be used as an argu¬ 
ment in any of these funcnons. 

Inline expansion of machine code procedures is supported. 


6. Conventions for Implementation-generated Names 
There are no implementation-generated names. 

7. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clauses 

Address expressions in an address clause are interpreted as physical addresses. 

8. Restrictions on Unchecked Conversions 
None. 

9. Restrictions on Unchecked Deallocations 
None. 


10. Implementation Characteristics of I/O Packages 

tosta ntiations of D IRECT JO use the value MAX_R£C_SIZE as the record size (expressed in 
STORAGE_UNrrS) when Ihe size of El.F.MENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For example for uncon¬ 
strained arrays such as string where ELEMENT_‘fYPE*SlZE is very large. MAX_REC_S1ZE is used 
instead. Mi^_RECORD_SIS is defined in ^STEM and can be changed by a program before 
instantiating DKECT 10 to provide an upper limit on the record size. In any case the maximum size 
supported is 1024 x 1024 x STORAGE_UNrr bits. DIRECTJO will raise USE_ERROR if 
MAX_REC_SIZE exceeds this absolute limiL 

Instantiations of SEQUENTIAL_10 use the value MAX_R£C_SIZE as the record size (expressed in 
STORAGE_UNrrS) when the size of ELEMENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For exampte for uncon¬ 
strained arrays such as string where ELEMENT_TYPE’SIZE is very large. MAX_REC_SIZE is used 
instead. MAX_RECORD_SIZE is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a program before 
instantiating INTEGER 10 to provide an upper limit on the record size. SEQUENTIAL 10 imposes no 
limit on MAX_REC_S^ 


11. Implementation Limits 

The following limits are actually enforced by the implementation. It is not intended to imply that 
resources up to or even near these limits are available to every program. 

ILL Line Length 

The implementation supports a maximum line length of 500 characters including the end of line charac¬ 
ter. 


B-7 





11^ Record and Array Sixes 

The maximum size of a statically sized array type is 4,000.000 x STORAGE_LWrS. The maximum 
size of a statically sized record type is 4,000,000 x STORAGE^UNTTS. A record type or array type 
declaration that exceeds these limits will generate a warning message. 

lU Default Suck Size for Tasks 

In the ahoHtrf. of an explicit STORAGE_SIZE length specification every task except the main program 
is a fixed size stack of 10,240 STORAG£_UNlTS. This is the value returned by 

TSTORAGE_SIZE for a task type T. 

11.4. Default Collection Size 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGE_SlZE length attribute the default collection size for an access 
type is 100 times the size of the designated type. This is the value returned by T'STORAGE_SIZE for 
an access type T. 

lU. Limit on Declared Objects 

There is an absolute limit of 6,000,000 x STORAGE^UNTTS for objects declared statically within a 
compilation unit If this value is exceeded the compiler will terminate the compilation of the unit with a 
FATAL error message.

APPENDIX C 


TEST PARAMETERS 


Certain tests in the ACVC make use of implementation-dependent values, such 
as the maximum length of an input line and invalid file names. A test that 
makes use of such values is identified by the extension .TST in its file 
name. Actual values to be substituted are represented by names that begin 
with a dollar sign. A value must be substituted for each of these names 
before the test is run. The values used for this validation are given 
below.

APPENDIX D 


WITHDRAWN TESTS 


Some tests are withdrawn from the ACVC because they do not conform to the 
Ada Standard. The following 44 tests had been withdrawn at the time of 
validation testing for the reasons indicated. A reference of the form 
Al-ddddd is to an Ada Commentary. 


a. E28005C: This test expects that the string "— TOP OF PAGE. —63" of 
line 204 will appear at the top of the listing page due to a pragma 
PAGE in line 203; but line 203 contains text that follows the pragma, 
and it is this text that must appear at the top of the page. 

b. A39005G; This test unreasonably expects a component clause to pack, an 
array component into a minimum size (line 30). 

c. B97102E: This test contains an unintended illegality: a select 
statement contains a null statement at the place of a selective wait 
alternative (line 31). 

d. C97116A: This test contains race conditions, and it assumes that 

guards are evaluated indivisibly. A conforming implementation may use 
interleaved execution in such a way that the evaluation of the guards 
at lines 50 & 54 and the execution of task CHANGING OF_THE_GUARD 

results in a call to REPORT.FAILED at one of lines 52 or 56. 

e. BC3009B: This test wrongly expects that circular instantiations will 
be detected in several compilation units even though none of the units 
is illegal with respect to the units it depends on; by AI-00256, the 
illegality need not be detected until execution is attempted (line 
95). 

f. CD2A62D: This test wrongly requires that an array object's size be no 
greater tha^ 10 although its subtype's size was specified to be 40 
(line 1377. 

g. CD2A63A..D, CD2A66A..D, CD2A73A..D, and CD2A76A..D (16 tests): These 


D-1 





WITHDRAWN TESTS 


tests wrongly attempt to check the size of objects of a derived type 
(for which a 'SIZE length clause is given) by passing them to a 
derived subprogram (which implicitly converts then, to the parent type 
(Ada standard 3.4:14)). Additionally, they use the 'SIZE length 
clause and attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic 
by the WG9 ARG. 

h. CD2A81G, CD2A83G, CD2A64M..K, and CD50110 (3 tests): These tests 

assume that dependent tasks will terminate while the main program 
executes a loop that simply tests for task termination; this is not 
the case, and the main program may loop indefinitely (lines 74, 85, 
86, 96, and 58, respectively). 

i. CD2B15C and CD7205C: These tests expect that a 'STORAGE_SIZE length 
clause provides precise control over the number of designated objects 
in a collection; the Ada standard 13.2:15 allows that such control 
must not be expected. 

j. CD2D11B: This test gives a SMALL representation clause for a derived 
fixed-point type (at line 30) that defines a set of model numbers that 
are not necessarily represented in the parent type; by Commentary 
AI-00099, all model numbers of a derived fixed-point type must be 
representable values of the parent type. 

k. CD5007B: This test wrongly expects an implicitly declared subprogram 
to be at the address that is specified for an unrelated subprogram 
(line 303). 

l. ED7004B, ED7005C..D, and ED7006C..D (5 tests): These tests check 
various aspects of the use of the three SYSTEM pragmas; the AVO 
withdraws these tests as being inappropriate for validation. 

m. CD7105A: This test requires that successive calls to CALENDAR.CLOCK 
change by at least SYSTEM.TICK; however, by Commentary AI-00201, it is 
only the expected frequency of change that must be at least 
SYSTEM.TICK—particular instances of change may be less (line 29). 

n. CD7203B and CD7204B: These tests use the 'SIZE length clause and 
attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic by the WG9 
ARG. 

o. CD7205D: This test checks an invalid test objective: it treats the 
specification of storage to be reserved for a task's activation as 
though it were like the specification of storage for a collection. 

p. CE2107I: This test requires that objects of two similar scalar types 
be distinguished when read from a file—DATA_ERR0R is expected to be 
raised by an attempt to read one object" as of the other type. 
However, it is not clear exactly how the Ada standard 14.2.4:4 is to 
be interpreted; thus, this test objective is not considered valid 
(line 90). 


D-2 








WITHDRAWN TESTS 


q. CE3111C: This test requires certain behavior, when two files are 
associated with the same external file, that is not required by the 
Ada standard. 

r. CE3301A: This test contains several calls to END_OF_LINE and 

END_OF_PAGE that have no parameter: these calls were intended to 
specify a file, not to refer to STANDARD_INPUT (lines 103, 107, 118, 
132, and 136). 

s. CE3411B: This test requires that a text file's column number be set to 
COUNT'LAST in order to check that LAy0UT_ERR0R is raised by a 
subsequent PUT operation. But the former operation will generally 
raise an exception due to a lack of available disk space, and the test 
would thus encumber validation testing.
