Many companies have described their experiences with using Motorola G4 processors to provide 
the VSIPL CoreLite standard for military and medical computing, and others have described 
their efforts with highly optimized Core and Core+ profiles. 

This poster uses the experience of MPI Software Technology's existing Core+ optimized VSIPL 
implementation for G4 as the springboard for supporting other platforms of emerging interest to 
COTS, defense, medical and imaging customers. 

Three kinds of technologies are occurring in military computing that may unseat the 
preeminence of low-power G4-style RISC processors: 1) The growing power of DSPs including 
better development environments, as typified by TI TMS320C6x family (as opposed to SHARC 
2106x, which was harder to program strictly from C and libraries), 2) The use of medium-power 
systems with Pentium 4 based blades, 3) The growing perception that PowerPC is lagging 
Pentium in overall performance 

Furthermore, the clock speed of Intel Pentium line of processors is now reaching three or more 
GHz. Also, the vector processing registers (SSE) available on the Pentium III or later provide 
several orders of improved performance for single precision floating point operations. 
Additionally, the well-known Pentium family provides a cost-effective COTS solution for 
embedded hardware designers as well as the end users. This means that although high power 
consumption, their Flops/Watt are becoming more attractive. 

MPI Software Technology now has a fully optimized VSIPL (Core and CoreLite) library, known 
as VSI/Pro, for Pentium 4 / SSE platform targeting Linux, Windows, and VxWorks operating 
systems. The FFT performance of VSI/Pro is consistently better than Intel’s Math Kernel Library 
(a.k.a MKL), as illustrated in the following graph. VSI/Pro has a carefully designed API, i.e., 
VSIPL, which is well fitted to the needs of the signal and image processing community in the 
defense and medical industries.

The Texas Instrument’s TMS320C67 family of processors is a general purpose DSP chip that is 
specifically designed for FFT and FIR operations. This family of processor is widely used and 
accepted by the signal processing community with the applications including software radio, 
modems, and sonar. Unique features of this family of processor include: 1) a very deep pipeline 
and 2) a very large instruction word (VLIW) architecture. Texas Instruments provides an 
integrated development environment known as Code Composer, which supports the C and C++ 
programming languages. Also, Tiny C Compiler has the ability to produce correct code for this 
DSP chip. The porting of VSI/Pro to this family of processor has started by the hand tuning of 
FFT operations and the algorithm mapping from the original RISC/CISC implementation to DSP 
chip. 

Experiences, results, plans and future work for supporting Intel Pentium 4 and Texas Instruments 
TMS320C67 family within VSI/Pro are described in this poster.

Algorithm was engineered for the 
architecture to minimize problems arising 
from the scarcity of registers and lower 
cache associativity. 

The algorithm is auto-sort DIF, efficient not 
only on power-of-two sizes. 

The key functions are written in assembler 
supported by highly optimized C and C++ 
code, using SSE.

Single-precision optimization not a big concern outside 
embedded computing... 

Good free libraries exist (e.g., FFTW, LAPACK) and MKL 
exists as alternatives 

Academic basic kernels for matrix multiplication (non- 
ATLAS) are now mature enough to use with small code size, 
but these are not open source/redistributable (e.g., libgoto) 

Several universities working on better free libraries 

Code bloat an issue for certain library architectures when 
considering embedded (e.g., ATLAS code size) 

The merger of free libraries and free VSIPL has been tried, not 
as good a fully optimized library (e.g., VSIPL ERI, VSIPL 
Ref Implementation upgrade) 

Demand for commercial VSIPL for P4 remains a question 



© 2001-2003 MPI Software Technology, Inc. 






Distinct flavors of P4 (e.g., Athlon) have 
distinctively different optimal libraries 

- Cache architecture 

- Instruction decode differences 

- TLB and other memory issues 

- Register file differences (e.g., 16 vs 8) 

Strong potential that future embedded P4 
clones will also have different optimal 
choices in their hardware configurations

Why we think it is useful to have 
commercial VSTPL on P4 and C67 

• Shows true performance portability story between 
diverse architectures, not just different G4/Altivec 
OS’s and vendors 

• Allows system designers to work with assumption 
low software porting cost, and explore other aspects 
of design alternatives 

• Processors are getting harder to program 

• Precise mix of required optimizations for embedded 
not strong emphasis of free libraries per se

Technology \ 3 



Demand for VSIPL for non-G4 platforms is TBD... 
appears promising but not well developed 

Opportunities to achieve extremely high 
performance on clearly different architectures now 
evident 

Proof of concept may help drive adoption 

Technical hurdles involving hand-optimization 
remain for key inner kernels on each new platform, 
but do not require massive coding in assembly 
language if handled correctly 

C/C++ toolchain always an issue for new processor 
+ OS combinations
