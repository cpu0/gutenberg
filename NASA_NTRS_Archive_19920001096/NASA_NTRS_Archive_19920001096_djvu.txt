TECHNICAL REPORT 



The 

RICIS 

Concept 


The University of Houston-Clear Lake established the Research Institute for 
Computing and Information systems in 1986 to encourage NASA Johnson Space 
Center and local industry to actively support research in the computing and 
information sciences. As part of this endeavor, UH-Clear Lake proposed a 
partnership with JSC to jointly define and manage an integrated program of research 
in advanced data processing technology needed for JSC T s main missions, including 
administrative, engineering and science responsibilities. JSC agreed and entered into 
a three-year cooperative agreement with UH-Clear Lake beginning in May, 1986, to 
jointly plan and execute such research through RICIS. Additionally, under 
Cooperative Agreement NCC 9- 1 6, computing and educational facilities are shared 
by the two institutions to conduct the research. 

The mission of RICIS is to conduct, coordinate and disseminate research on 
computing and information systems among researchers, sponsors and users from 
UH-Clear Lake, NASA/JSC, and other research organizations. Within UH-Clear 
Lake, the mission is being implemented through interdisciplinary involvement of 
faculty and students from each of the four schools: Business, Education, Human 
Sciences and Humanities, and Natural and Applied Sciences. 

Other research organizations are involved via the “gateway” concept. UH-Clear 
Lake establishes relationships with other universities and research organizations, 
having common research interests, to provide additional sources of expertise to 
conduct needed research. 

A major rote of RICIS is to find the best match of sponsors, researchers and 
research objectives to advance knowledge in the computing and information 
sciences. Working jointly with NASA/JSC, RICIS advises on research needs, 
recommends principals for conducting the research, provides technical and 
administrative support to coordinate the research, and integrates technical results 
into the cooperative goals of UH-Clear Lake and NAS A/ JSC.

ART/ADA DESIGN PROJECT - PHASE I 


TASK 3 REPORT: TEST PLAN 


1. Introduction 


This chapter describes the plan for the integrated testing and benchmark of Phase I of the Ada-Based 
ESBT Design Research Project. 


1.1 Overall Objectives 

The integration testing is divided into two phases: Integrated Testing I and II. 

• Integrated Testing I: In this phase, the modules that do not rely on the Ada code generated by 
the Ada Generator are tested before the Ada Generator is implemented. 

• Integrated Testing II: In this phase, all modules are integrated and tested with the Ada code 
generated by the Ada Generator. Its performance and size as well as its functionality is 
verified in this phase. 


1.2 Target Platform 

The target platform is a DEC Ada compiler on VAX mini-computers and VAXstations running the 
VMS operating system. 


1.3 Resource Requirement 

The integrated testing and benchmark requires the following resources: 

• One principal investigator: Bradley P. Allen (BP A) 

• Two researchers: James T. Badura (JTB) and S. Daniel Lee (SDL) 

• Hardware: one VAXstation II, one Sun 3/260, and one IBM PS/2 Model 50 or 70. 

• Ada compilers: one copy of the DEC Ada compiler for a VAXstation, one copy of the Verdix 
Ada compiler for a Sun, and one copy of the Alsys Ada compiler for an IBM PS/2 

• C compiler: one copy of the VAX C compiler for a VAXstation, and one copy of the Microsoft 
C compiler for an IBM PS/2 

• ART-EM Version 1.5 

• ART/Ada Test cases: an extensive test suite similar to the ART-IM test suit, a small-size 
benchmark program (less than 100 rules), a medium-size benchmark programs (a couple of 
hundred rules), and other small test cases.

TASK 3 REPORT: TEST PLAN 


2. Integrated Testing I 

2.1 Objectives 

The objectives of Integrated Testing I are as follows: 

• To facilitate the individual module testing before the Ada Generator is implemented. 

• To integrate and test the modules that do not rely on the Ada code generated by the Ada 
Generator. 


2.2 Success Criteria 

The success criteria of Integrated Testing I are as follows: 

1. To assert a fact from an Ada main program. 

2. To retract a fact from an Ada main program. 

3. To watch facts while the fact is being asserted and retracted using the user interface. 

4. To use other features in the user interface. 

5. To have the exception handler handle errors correctly. 

2.3 Integration Plan 

In this phase, the modules that do not rely on the Ada code generated by the Ada Generator are 

r 

integrated and tested before the Ada Generator is implemented. 

The Verdix Ada compiler on a Sun 3/260 workstation will be mainly used for the integration and 
debugging because of its superior performance and the make facility. The final system should run on the 
DEC Ada compiler on a VAXstation as well. 


2.4 Testing Methodologies 

Extensive debugging messages will be implemented and enabled. These facilities include built-in 
facilities in ART/Ada such as "watch facts", and internal debugging facilities which will be taken out in 
the final system.

3. Integrated Testing II 

3.1 Objectives 

The objectives of Integrated Testing II are as follows: 

• To integrate and test all modules with the Ada code generated by the Ada Generator. 

• To verify the functionality of the whole system. 

• To compare the performance and size of the system with that of ART-IM. 

3.2 Success Criteria 

The success criteria of Integrated Testing II are mainly to verify functionality. 

1. To run small test cases. 

2. To run a test suite to completion. 

3. To run a small-size benchmark program, Monkey-and-bananas. 

4. To run a medium-size benchmark program, Medium. 

The performance and size are estimated as below, but will not be considered as the success criteria: 

1. To run a little slower than ART-IM on both benchmarks when compiled with the runtime 
constraint check disabled. 

2. To run with about the same size as ART-IM on both benchmarks. 


3.3 Integration Plan 

In this phase, all modules are integrated and tested with the Ada code generated by the Ada Generator. 

The Verdix Ada compiler on a Sun 3/260 workstation will be mainly used for the integration and 
debugging because of its superior performance and the make facility. The final system should run on the 
DEC Ada compiler on a VAXstation as well. 

3.4 Testing Methodologies 

In this phase, the functionality of the whole system is verified mostly using test cases. Small test cases 
will be used initially to get the easy bugs out. Then, a extensive test suite will be implemented and used 
to verify a variety of features.

ART/ADA DESIGN PROJECT - PHASE I 


TASK 3 REPORT: TEST PLAN 


After the functionality is verified, the performance and size of system will be measured using two 
benchmark programs: one small-size benchmark program and another medium-size one. These results 
will be compared with those of ART-IM.
