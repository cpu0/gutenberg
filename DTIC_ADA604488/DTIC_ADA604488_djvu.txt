An Automatic Identification System (AIS) reception indexer Java application was developed in the 
summer of 2011, based on the work of Lapinski and Isenor (Estimating Reception Coverage 
Characteristics of AIS, Lapinski and Isenor, Journal of Navigation, October 2011 [I]). This application 
gathers AIS messages and produces a coverage map, graphically representing the quality and fidelity of 
signals received by coastal sensors. The application gathers its inputs either from static data files or a 
streaming input source. OODA Technologies improved the application in 2012 under call-ups 5 [2] and 6 
[3, 4] to the standing offer W7707-115137. Several bugs were fixed, performance was improved, an alert 
system algorithm was implemented, several features were added and usability was improved. During the 
same period, an investigation was conducted by OODA Technologies, under call-up number 4 to the 
standing offer W7707-115137, about the feasibility of using the open source GeoNetwork application for 
information product management and access within TRINITY. As a result, GeoNetwork is being installed 
by MARLANT N6 in the Integrated Testing Environment (ITE) for TRINITY. This work involves the 
development of an application, the GeoNetwork Publisher (GNP) that automatically publishes to 
GeoNetwork AIS index reception maps produced by the AIS Indexer. Currently, the AIS Indexer 
interfaces with the GNP to publish maps. The GNP can however be re-used for the publication of other 
products. The use of GNP reduces the overhead of producing metadata for every publication and thus 
ultimately encourages Geonetwork usage. The GNP is part of a global effort to distribute and manage 
Maritime Information Support (MIS) products.

Abstract 


An Automatic Identification System (AIS) reeeption indexer Java applieation was devel¬ 
oped in the summer of 2011, based on the work of Lapinski and Isenor (Estimating Reeep¬ 
tion Coverage Charaeteristies of AIS, Lapinski and Isenor, Journal of Navigation, Oetober 
2011 [1]). This application gathers AIS messages and produees a coverage map, graphi¬ 
cally representing the quality and fidelity of signals received by eoastal sensors. The ap¬ 
plieation gathers its inputs either from statie data files or a streaming input souree. OODA 
Teehnologies improved the application in 2012 under call-ups 5 [2] and 6 [3, 4] to the 
standing offer W7707-115137. Several bugs were fixed, performanee was improved, an 
alert system algorithm was implemented, several features were added and usability was 
improved. 

During the same period, an investigation was eondueted by OODA Teehnologies, under 
eall-up number 4 to the standing offer W7707-115137, about the feasibility of using the 
open souree GeoNetwork applieation for information produet management and aeeess 
within TRINITY. As a result, GeoNetwork is being installed by MARLANT N6 in the 
Integrated Testing Environment (ITE) for TRINITY. 

This work involves the development of an applieation, the GeoNetwork Publisher (GNP), 
that automatieally publishes to GeoNetwork AIS index reception maps produeed by the 
AIS Indexer. Currently, the AIS Indexer interfaces with the GNP to publish maps. The 
GNP can however be re-used for the publication of other produets. The use of GNP reduces 
the overhead of producing metadata for every publieation and thus ultimately eneourages 
Geonetwork usage. The GNP is part of a global effort to distribute and manage Maritime 
Information Support (MIS) products.

1 Introduction 


In 2011, Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) Atlantic’s Maritime Infor¬ 
mation and Combat Systems Section was requested by Canadian Forces Intelligence staff to 
investigate the capabilities and applicability of GeoNetwork for use in managing geospatial 
information products. The investigation was a contracted effort with OODA Technologies 
Inc. 

This investigation has shown that GeoNetwork is a viable geospatial product management 
system for Department of National Defence (DND) TRINITY. It provides product storage 
and advertisement, allowing for users to search and discover relevant products based on 
various criteria. As a result, GeoNetwork is being installed by MARLANT N6 in the ITE 
for TRINITY. It has also been shown that GeoNetwork would be a viable means for the 
DRDC Atlantic MIS group to broadcast their research products. Moreover, the harvesting 
mechanism would allow both GeoNetwork instances (N6 and MIS) to communicate and 
share Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) products. 

Publishing a product to GeoNetwork requires the creation of metadata to describe the prod¬ 
uct and enable its discovery. The creation of quality metadata necessitates extra efforts and 
could bring resistance to GeoNetwork full adoption. 

OODA Technologies investigated the possibility of publishing automatically a product to 
GeoNetwork. As a result, the GNP was developed by OODA Technologies Inc. and inte¬ 
grated into the AIS Indexer (see [3] and [4] for more details about the AIS indexer). This 
application creates automatically the required Marine Community Profile (MCP) [7] com¬ 
pliant metadata based on a template and publishes AIS coverage index maps produced by 
the AIS Indexer to GeoNetwork. This application opens the door to a structured, easier and 
broader communication of MIS research efforts. 

The GNP assumes the following: 

. There is an up and running instance of GeoNetwork available on the network ^. 

. The GeoNetwork instance’s Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and administrator cre¬ 
dentials (login, password) are known. 

• The file for publication contains geographic information and is pertinent for publication 
on GeoNetwork as a MIS product. 

• The metadata format used is MCP [7]. 

. Python (at least version 2.6) is installed on the machine used to execute GNP. 

The GNP application was developed to publish AIS reception index maps (see [1, 8]), but 
can be modified to publish other products. Ligure 1 shows the AIS Indexer’s product as it 
appears after being published by the GNP. 

1. The ANZ-MEST software [5] was selected as the most convinient GeoNetwork version to use. The 
main reason is that it provides embedded support for the MCP. See [6] for more details on ANZ-MEST.

2 GeoNetwork Publisher 


GeoNetwork allows publishers to link their produets to the metadata description they pub¬ 
lish in the catalogue. The products can be downloaded by clicking on the Data for Down¬ 
load button, as illustrated in Figure 1. There are several ways GeoNetwork serves products: 
using online resources such as Web Map Service (WMS), File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and 
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) servers, or by offering downloadable hies. See [6] for 
more details about how GeoNetwork serves products. 

The GNP application is based on the GeoNetwork’s capability to use a Metadata Exchange 
Format (MEF) archive hie to create a product available for download. A MEF hie is a Z IP 
hie with the following structure: 


Root 


+- metadata.xml 

+- inf0.xml 

+- public 

I +- all public documents and thumbnails 

+- private 

+- all private documents 


The MEF hie contains all the information required by GeoNetwork to create the product 
and make it available for download. 

GeoNetwork provides access to several internal structures through the use of extensible 
Markup Eanguage (XME) services (see [9] for details). The capability to import a MEF 
hie for publication is implemented by the XME service mef. import. 

The GNP is used to: 

1. Produce a product compliant with GeoNetwork from a hie with geographic content; 

2. Publish automatically the resulting product to GeoNetwork ; and 

3. Grant privileges on the product. 

It has four main functional components illustrated in hgure 2: 

. Publisher, 

• MEE Builder, 

. MEE Importer, 

. Privileges Manager. 

These components are implemented by 6 Python modules: 


3 



• publish.pY, 

. mef.pY, 

. info.py, 

. metadata.PY, 

. geonetwork.pY and 
. config.pY that is used for configuration. 

This section describes each of the four functional components along with their implemen¬ 
tation.

2.1 Publisher 

The publisher is the product publication’s orchestrator. It calls successively: 

1. the MEF Builder to create a product and archive it as a MEF file; 

2. the MEF Importer to import the product to GeoNetwork; and 

3. the Privileges Manager to grant privileges on the product. 

The publisher is implemented by the Python module publisher.py. 

2.2 MEF Builder 

The MEF Builder has three roles: 

1. Create the inf o. xml file; 

2. Create the metadata. xml file; and 

3. Produce the MEF file.

parameters and tile's full path 



Figure 3: MEF Builder implementation. 

These three funetionalities are implemented respeetively by the Python modules: inf o. py, 
metadata. py and mef. py (see figure 3 ). 

The createMef function of the mef .py module calls successively info .py and metadata, 
py to create the required XML files and then organizes the files following the MEF structure 
and archives it. It takes as input the required parameters to create the product. These 
parameters are values that will change from one publication to another of the same product. 
In the case of the AIS reception index, these parameters are: geographic bounding box, start 
and end time of the index computation, and the full path of the map file, and the delta time 
used in the index algorithm. 

The following details how the MEF Builder creates the two XME files and the MEF 
archive. 

2.2.1 XML Files Creation 

The files info.xml and metadata.xml need to be created to produce a valid MEF file. 
Both of them are generated using a template file, identified in figure 2 and 3 as info.xml 
template and metadata.xml template. 

A template file is read, loaded into local memory and some of its fields are modified with 
the input information. These functionalities are implemented by the info.py module for 
the inf 0. xml file and by the metadata. py for metadata. xml. The output of these oper¬ 
ations is the XME file content. 

The motivation to use a template versus generating the whole XME file for each publication 
is to reduce the overhead and program complexity. Since only a small portion of each XME 
file needs to be modified from one publication to another, there is no need to re-generate 


5 













the same file over again. The Python Ixml toolkit [10] is used to load the eontent of the 
template file in memory and modify it. 

The following paragraphs deseribe the speeifie modifications made to each template. 

2.2.1.1 info.xml 

The info.py module is used to read the template info. xml file, load it in local memory 
and modify some of the fields, namely: 

. creation and change date, 

. product’s Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), 

. the GeoNetwork sites’s UUID, 

. the public and private file names. 

The creation and change dates are set to be the metadata creation date, i.e. the time when 
the publisher is invoked. The product’s UUID is created by the GNP while the site UUID is 
unique to the GeoNetwork instance used for publication (see section 3.3 for more informa¬ 
tion about this parameter). The public file name is the name of the thumbnail (see section 

2.2.2 for details about thumbnail generation) and the private file name refers to the file that 
will be available for download. The file extension is required in both cases and the full path 
is not needed for the private file. Note that more than one file can be made available for 
download. The possible file formats are (by extension): 

. Images: bmp, gif, jpg, jpeg, png, swf, tiff, tif and wbmp; 

• Applications: gml, wms, kmz and kml; 

. Text: txt, html, swf, xhtml and xml; 

The info. xml template file content for the AIS reception index is listed in annex A. 

2.2.1.2 metadata.xml 

The metadata.PY module is used to read the metadata.xml template file, load it in 
local memory and modify some of the fields, namely: 

. product’s title, 

. abstract, 

. publication and creation dates, 

. thumbnail’s name and format, 

. revision date, 

. geographic bounding box coordinates, 

. start and end dates, 

. URL, type of file for download and its description. 


6 


Here, the ereation date is when the product was generated and the publication date refers 
to the moment the product is published on GeoNetwork, i.e. the current date. The revision 
date is set to be the same as the publication date. 

Note that it is possible to modify metadata.py for updating other fields than the ones 
mentioned above. See section 4 to see how. 

The metadata.xml template file content for the AIS reception index is listed in Annex 

B. 

2.2.2 MEF File Creation 

To produce the MEF file, the MEF Builder creates a temporary directory within a sub direc¬ 
tory called met where the GNP is run. This temporary directory, referred here as met\tmp, 
has the MEF structure described in this section’s introduction. The XME content produced 
by the modules info.py and metadata.py (see paragraphs 2.2.1.1 and 2.2.1.2) is used to 
write respectively the info.xml and metadata.xml files to the mef\tmp directory. The 
file to download is copied to the mef\tmp\private directory. 

If the file to download is an image the MEF builder will automatically create a thumbnail 
version of it and write it into the mef\tmp\public directory. This thumbnail will be part 
of the product description within GeoNetwork, as illustrated on the right part of figure 1. 

Once all required files have been written in the mef\tmp, the MEF Builder zips recursively 
the content of mef\tmp and saves it in the mef directory under the name of the product’s 
UUID, e.g. mef\aa78838b-49ac-46cb-8cd0-359fb0a50aaa.mef. For each publica¬ 
tion, the MEF file is saved in the mef directory. If a publication fails, for instance due to 
a network problem, then the MEF file is available for manual import to GeoNetwork. The 
output of this operation is the absolute path of the created MEF file. 

2.3 MEF Importer 

The MEF Importer has a single role: to import the MEF file to GeoNetwork. This func¬ 
tionality is implemented by the importMef function of the geonetwork.py module. It 
uses the full path of the MEF file as input and outputs the local Identification Number (ID) 
of the product provided by GeoNetwork. The local ID is a simple integer and is different 
from the UUID. This functionality is simply an interface for the GeoNetwork XME service 
mef. import. It connects to GeoNetwork using the administrator credentials (see 3.3 for 
details about the credentials) and calls the GeoNetwork XME service. 

2. A file is detected as an image if it has one of the following extensions: bmp, gif, jpg, jpeg, png, swf, 
tiff, tif or wbmp. 


7 



2.4 Privileges Manager 

The Privileges Manager is used to give all privileges to a list of groups for a given produet. 
It takes the UUID of the produet and the group’s IDs as input. The seleeted groups should 
be registered to the GeoNetwork instanee beforehand. See seetion 3.3 for details about the 
groups IDs. 


8 


3 Execution 


This section describes how to execute the GNP directly or by using an interface. It also 
describes the required settings and configuration. 

3.1 Python 

Install Python (at least version 2.6) on the machine used to execute GNP. Python software 
and instructions for installation can be found in [11]. 

The GNP requires two extra Python packages: 

1. lxml-3.0.2, 

2. PIL-1.1.7. 

The Windows binaries for both packages can be found here: http: //www. Ifd.uci . edu/ 
-gohlke/pythonlibs/. 

3.2 GeoNetwork Settings 

As mentioned in the introduction, the GNP requires an up and running instance of GeoNet¬ 
work available on the network. See Annex C for installation instructions. 

Moreover, the GeoNetwork administrator should have created: 

. at least the group that will have full privileges on the products published by the GNP, 

. at least one user for each group. 


3.3 Configuration 

All GNP configuration parameters are defined in con fig. py. This file is read at execution 
time. Only the following parameters need to be modified: 

. gnUsername: GeoNetwork administrator’s user name (usually admin)', 

. gnPassword: GeoNetwork administrator’s password; 

. gnServletUrl: the URL of the GeoNetwork servlet. Use the full Internet Protocol (IP), 
e.g. http://70.82.193.119:8080/geonetwork/srv/en 
. metadataTemplateMCP: name of the metadata. xml template file, e.g. metadata_ 
template. xml. It is assumed that there is a copy of this file in the same directory of 
publisher.py. 

. infoTemplate: name of the info .xml template file, e.g. info_template. xml. It is 
assumed that there is a copy of this file in the same directory of publisher .py. 

• siteld: GeoNetwork instance UUID, e.g 9e48e6e4-9bfc-4b7c-9f77-77ac88b27085. 


9 



. groupids: the list of IDs of the groups that will have full privileges on the produet, e.g. 
[4,7]. 


There are two ways to get the site’s UUID: 

1. in a browser, go to gnServletUrl/geonetwork/srv/en/xml. info?tYpe=site or 

2. exeeute getSiteInfo of the geonetwork .py module. 

There is no apparent way to grant privileges using the name of the group instead of the ID. 
To get the group’s IDs: 

1. in a browser, go to gnServletUrl/geonetwork/srv/en/xml .group, list or 

2. execute getGroups of the geonetwork.py module. 

3.4 Execution 

As mentioned in section 2.1, the publisher orchestrates the product’s publication. There¬ 
fore, to run the GNP, one must execute publisher .py either 

1. directly by the command line (see section 3.4.1) or 

2. through an interface such as the Publisher. java Java interface (see section 3.4.2). 
directly 

3.4.1 Command Line 

The publish.py script reads a series of arguments as input. These arguments are used to 
create the metadata. It requires at least one argument: the product name. In the case of the 
AIS reception index, the product name is ais coverage map. 

For example, for the AIS reception index map file C: \Users\Public\Data\ais_coverage. 
14hours .png, with a delta time of 6 minutes, having 2011-02-02 21:33:33 and 2011-02- 
02 22:33:33 as start and end dates within a bounding box defined by a longitude between 
-130° and -110° and latitude between 51° and 70°, the command is: 


> python publish.py "ais coverage map" 

"2011-02-02 21:33:33 'UTC'" "2011-02-02 22:33:33 'UTC'" 
6 C:\Users\Public\Data\ais_coverage_14hours.png 
-110.0 -130.0 70.0 51.0 


The -- before the bounding box coordinates is used to handle the minus signs. The format

3.4.2 Publisher Java Class 


The Publisher elass was developed to integrate the GNP to the AIS reeeption indexer. It 
is used to exeeute the publish seript. When the user launehes the index eomputation, he 
is asked if he wants the output map to be published to GeoNetwork. If the answer is yes, 
the GNP is exeeuted at the end of the map eomputation. Sinee the AIS reeeption index 
applieation is implemented in Java, a Java interfaee was required to launeh the GNP. The 
Publisher eonstruetor requires the same arguments as the publish seript, with the exeeption 
that the date/time values are required as Java Calendar objeets 

3.5 Products Management 

The produet management on GeoNetwork is not performed automatieally by the GNP. The 
GeoNetwork administrator, or someone having delete rights designated by the administra¬ 
tor, has to delete produets deemed too old or not pertinent anymore. Sinee it is possible to 
publish a large number of maps eaeh day, the GeoNetwork administrator should be aware 
that the eatalogue’s size may inerease quiekly. It is worth mentioning that it would be pos¬ 
sible to implement a produet management meehanism to the GNP. The eapability to delete 
products in GeoNetwork is implemented by the XML service metadata. delete.

4 Addition of a new product 


This section details the steps required to use the GNP to publish products other than the 
AIS index maps. It is worth modifying and using the GNP only if it is planned to repeat¬ 
edly publish the same type of product, such as in the AIS reception index case. These 
instructions assume the reader is comfortable with Python, but not necessarily a s ki lled 
programmer. 

In order to illustrate the steps, consider a use case involving a fictitious product: a map 
containing ship routes produced from maritime data gathered by diverse sources. Let us 
suppose that a new map is generated each week, for a selected area. The changing metadata 
about the map is the time period it covers, the bounding box of the region and also, let us 
suppose, a numeric uncertainty value, ranging between 0 and 1, estimating the probability 
of error in the routes generation. 

The GNP could be used in that situation to automatically publish the map as a product on 
GeoNetwork. This would reduce the overhead associated to the production of metadata at 
each manual publication. 

The following sections describe the modules to modify. 

4.1 publish, py 

As mentioned in section 3.4.1, the publish.py script requires at least one argument: the 
product’s name. This argument is used internally by the application. For our use case, the 
product name could be ship routes. 

The function readArguments has to be modified to read the required input arguments. It 
is done by adding an extra if clause: 


if product.strip().lower() == "ship routes" 


All input arguments are stored internally using a dictionary ^ structure, where the key is 
the name of the argument and the value is the argument’s value. The naming is left to the 
developer, since it will only be used internally. However, if there is a file to upload, its full 
path must be stored using the key f ilePath. 

For the use case, the dictionary would have the following structure (values are only for 
example): 

product : ’’ship route” 

4. Note that a Python dictionary is an unordered mapping. 


12 




filePath : ”C:\Us ers\Public\Data\JudeRiver_routes.png” 
startTime : ”2012-11-01 20:30:00” 
endXime : ”2012-11-08 20:30:00” 

uncertainty : 0.11 
boundingbox : 

westLon : -180.0 
eastLon: 180.0 
northLat: 90.0 
soutbLat: -90.0 

Note that date/time is stored as a string and that boundingbox is also a dictionary. 

4.2 metadata template file 

It is required to make a new metadata template XML file. The best way to proceed is to 
first use the GeoNetwork Online Metadata Editor to create the product’s metadata. Then 
download the metadata XML file (by clicking on Save metadata as XML on the Online 
Metadata Editor or Viewer) and use it as the metadata template file. The main ad¬ 
vantage of this approach is to make sure that the product looks as wanted on GeoNetwork 
before starting to publish it. Note that the metadata template file format must be the 
MCP. 

4.3 info template file 

The info template file is simple and the one used for the AIS Indexer can be used here 
without any change. 

4.4 metadata. py 

It is required to make a new function to modify the required parts of the metadata template 
file with the input arguments. Eor our use case, the input parameters are the time period 
it covers, the bounding box of the region, the uncertainty value and the location in the file 
system of the map to publish. Let us suppose that the metadata impacted by these values 
are: 

. title, 

. abstract (which mentions the uncertainty value), 

. creation and publication dates, 

. bounding box (geographic extend) and 
. downloadable file description. 


13 


The same metadata as for the AIS Indexer product is impacted. 

The first step is to modify the construct function to add an if clause: 


if info['product'] == "ship routes" 


Then, the second step is to implement a new function, e.g. shipRoutes, that will load the 
metadata template file in memory, modify parts of its content and return the updated 
XML content. See coverageMap for an example of such a function. 

The idea is to first identify in the metadata template file which nodes will change at 
each publication and then modify the required fields. For example, the following gets and 
modifies the bounding box west bound: 


westBoundLongitudeNode = 

fIndNode([geoExtentPath,gmd( ' westBoundLongitude' ) , geo (' Decimal' ) ] , tree) 
westBoundLongitudeNode.text = str(boundingBox['west']) 


It is unlikely that other nodes than the ones in coverageMap have to be modified for a new 
product. If it is the case, it is strongly recommended to use the Ixml toolkit to interface with 
XML along with the already implemented functions and variables: gmd, geo, f indNode,... 
The navigation through the nodes is much simpler with these. 

Note that inf o. py does not need to be modified. 

4.5 config.py 

Only the parameters, as described in section 3.3, have to be modified according to the 
GeoNetwork installation and the name of the template files used.

<gmd:abstract> 

<gco:CharacterString>This is a product generated from AIS data obtained 
from the Maritime SafetY and SecuritY Information SYStem (MSSIS). 

The product displaYS a color coded reception index for a particular area. 

In the area where the color coding is beige, there has been at least 

1 received AIS message in the last 6 minutes, from everY known ship 

in that region. The fading of the color towards orange, indicates 

the reduction in the number of known ships reporting at least 1 AIS 

message in the 6 minute time window. A deep orange-red color indicates 

an area where vessels are appearing and disappearing, from an AIS 

perspective, based on the 6 minute window. For example, around 

the outer limits of the reception areas there will be deep 

orange-red where vessels are either appearing for the first time 

(i.e., because it is the beginning of a track) or are disappearing 

(i.e., the end of a track). Black indicates no messages 

received. For further information, contact the Principal Investigator.

Annex C: GeoNetwork Installation 


This section presents the procedures to install the ANZ-MEST version of the GeoNet¬ 
work and its framework on a Dell PowerEdge 2950 server with RAID 5. Although it is 
assumed that the operating system (in this case, Einux Ubuntu server) is already installed, 
the instructions and guidelines for installation are provided in the subsections below. These 
instructions were tested on a standard server hardware but not specifically on a Dell Pow¬ 
erEdge server. Some web links are provided below to prevent some potential problems 
related to the PowerEdge server. In case of a problem, please consult your Information 
Technology (IT) administrator or contact OODA Technologies for support. 

The instructions provided are based on the assumption that the Dell PowerEdge 2950 server 
elements are: 

. 2 Dual Core Intel® Xeon ® 5160 processors, 4MB Cache, 3.00GHz, 1333MHz ESB 

. SGigabyte (GB) 533MHz (4x2GB), Dual Ranked DIMMs 

• Integrated SAS/SATA RAID 5, PERC 5/i Integrated 

. 4 SAS Hard Drives, 300GB, 3.5-inch, lOK RPM Hard Drives 

. PERC 5/i, x6 Backplane, Integrated Controller Card 

. Dual Embedded Broadcom® NetXtreme II 5708 Gigabit Ethernet NIC 

. 24X IDE CD-RW/DVD ROM Drive 

The maximum memory for this server is 32 GB. Currently it has 4 slots with 2 GB memory 
each which totals 8 GB. It is recommended to fill the remaining 4 empty slots with the 
same memory module to increase the memory to a minimum of 16 GB. Another and better 
option would be to put 4 GB memory modules in each slot for a total of 32 GB. 


Before installation 

Although the installation procedure could work without firmware update, it is highly rec¬ 
ommended to update the BIOS and RAID card firmware. This is especially important if you 
want the server to be as reliable as possible and to make sure your Einux installation goes 
smoothly. The BIOS version should be updated to A21 (BR168380.exe). The firmware for 
the PERC/QC RAID Card should be updated to 2.8, using DEEE support site If you did 
not update the firmware and you encountered a problem (e.g. during RAID configuration), 
update the firmware and restart from the beginning. Updating firmware could be tricky, 
please request the assistance of your IT administrator. 

If not already done, connect a keyboard and a screen to the PowerEdge.

RAID configuration 

Configuration of the RAID array is done using the BIOS but mostly the PERC firmware. 
This video ( http: //www.youtube.coin/watch?v=044qCZNiUJE ) will provide you with 
valuable instructions for setting up the RAID 5 array. Before configuring the array, make 
sure that all valuable data (if any) from the array is backed up as the configuration process 
will erase the drives in favor of the new installation. For a tutorial on the different RAID 
configurations: http: //www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuwD7EhJ0dc. 

To access the BIOS, hold down F2 or FIO at BootUP. To access the PERC 5/i RAID 
firmware, hold down Crtl+R at BootUP. 

Here are some links that could help you to solve some of the RAID issues you may en¬ 
counter: 

• Detailed instructions on how to use the PERC 6 (not 5) integrated BIOS configuring 
utility^. 

. If the RAID is not visible, ensure that the nic (bnx2) and the controller driver (mpt2sas) 
are in the initial RAM disk (initrd) file for it to see the perc controllers 
. If at the first boot, the disks are still not accessible, you can reset everything by entering 
the BIOS and resetting all settings to default and reboot. The RAID setup prompt should 
pop up for you upon first boot. 

• Information on solving RAID problems on PowerEdge 

If major problems are encountered while trying to configure the RAID array, other options 
are still applicable for salvaging the PowerEdge: 

. Using a Software RAID strategy instead of using the PERC RAID card. 

• Using a couple of hard drives from the array, used as a non-RAID solution. It would be 
sufficiant for the purpose of the GeoNetwork. 


Ubuntu server installation and configuration 

We recommend using Ubuntu server 12.04 for the GeoNetwork server operating system. 
This version is Eong Term Support (ETS) version which will be supported for the next five 
years. This version performed well in a standard server test. Insert the Ubuntu Server CD 
and boot the PowerEdge server. If necessary, use the BIOS to give priority to the CD drive 
in the boot sequence. Make sure that the computer on which you install Ubuntu has access 
to the Internet, if a proxy is required, the installation process will allow you to enter the 
proxy coordinates. Use the TAB and the arrows to navigate in the installation interface. 
Perform the following steps:

1. Installation language: Select English. 

2. Main menu: Select the Install Ubuntu Server. 

3. Languages: Select English. 

4. Location: Select Canada. 

5. Keyboard layout: Select No. 

6. Keyboard layout: Select English (US). 

7. Keyboard layout: Select English (US) and wait a few seconds for the next panel. 

8. Host name: Enter the hostname of the new server (e.g. geoserver). 

9. Administrator name: Enter the full name of the administrator for this machine (e.g. 
Sean Webb or GeoNetwork Administrator). 

10. Administrator username: Enter the username used by the GeoNetwork adminis¬ 
trator (e.g. geoadmin). 

11. Administrator password: Enter a nontrivial password for the GeoNetwork admin¬ 
istrator account. 

12. Administrator password confirmation: Repeat the password. 

13. Encryption: Select No. You may select Yes but this option was not tested and can 
have unknown consequence. 

14. Timezone: If the proposed timezone is correct, select Yes, if not, select No then 
select Halifax. 

15. Disk partition and RAID: It is recommended to select Manual. In this section, you 
have to set your disk partition configuration. A typical setup is to set a bootable Ext4 
/boot partition of 10GB, a /swap partition of 10GB and the rest will become the 
root / Ext4 partition. Also, the IT administrator could either decide to use the PERC 
RAID controller or to use instead a Software RAID implementation, both being im- 
plementable on PowerEdge. This stage shoud be supervised by the IT administrator 
or revisited if installation failed. 

16. Confirmation: When partitioning is completed, select Yes to confirm writing the 
partition to disk and wait a few minutes while the base system is being installed. 

17. Proxy selection: DRDC is using a proxy site for connection to the Internet, input 
the coordinates on that line, if not, leave the field empty and wait a few minutes for 
the next panel. 

18. Automatic update: Select No automatic update. 

19. Manual package selection: DO NOT SEEECT ANYTHING, use the TAB key to 
select Continue and then, type Enter and wait for the installation process to com¬ 
plete. 

20. Grub: Select Yes. 


37 


21. Reboot: Wait for the automatic reboot, remove the CD after ejection and close the 
casing and then select Continue. 

22. Network configuration: First, log in using the username and password defined dur¬ 
ing the installation process. Become root with the command sudo su for which you 
will need to enter your password again. Using your favorite command line editor 
(e.g. vi), edit the file /etc/network/interfaces. First, replace the word dhcp 
by static. Add the following 4 new lines at the end of the file and replace the 
numerical values by the parameters provided by your IT Administrator (IP address, 
netmask, network gateway and local DNS server): 

address 192.168.0.123 
netmask 255.255.255.0 
gateway 192.168.0.1 
dns-nameservers 192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8 

23. /etc/hosts modification: Edit the /etc/hosts file: 

(a) Replace 127.0.1.1 by 127.0.0.1 

(b) Add a line after the first one, stating the IP address and the hostname you chose 
above (e.g. 192.168.0.123 geoserver) 

(c) Save your modifications and exit. 

24. Remote access: Ask your IT Administrator if you need to create a hosts.allow 
file (listing the IPs, separated by spaces, of the computers allowed to log in directly 
to the server for administration purposes). 

25. Reboot: Type reboot. 

26. DNS configuration: Ask your IT administrator to add the IP and hostname of the 
new GeoNetwork in the local DNS server so that the hostname is resolved when used 
by the researchers browsers. 

The server is now installed and configured for networking. For a good reference on how 
to manage an Ubuntu server, consult the document https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/ 
serverguide/serverguide.pdf. 

Software package installation and configuration 

The following instructions are for installing and configuring the software packages Java 
1.6 and MySQL 5.5 which are required for running the GeoNetwork. Each time you use 
the apt-get command, you will be invited to confirm the installation of the package and 
its dependencies. Type Y and type Enter on each occasion or just type Enter to use the 
default value. 

1. Login: Login on the server. 


38 


2. For mounting USB keys: 

sudo apt-get install usbmount 

It is highly recommended to edit the /etc/usbmount/usbmount. conf file and re¬ 
move the sync, option. It will speedup access to USB keys. 

3. Installation utilities: sudo apt-get install python-software-properties 

4. JAVA installation: Insert the GeoNetwork installation CD and execute the com¬ 
mand: 

(a) cp /media/cdrom/GeoNetwork/java_installer.sh ~ 

(b) sudo java.installer.sh 

Wait for several minutes as the scripts download the Java packages from internet 
and configure them as Ubuntu packages. When completed, execute the following 
commands: 

(a) sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk 

(b) sudo apt-get install ant 

5. MySQU installation: Insert the GeoNetwork installation CD and execute the com¬ 
mand: 

sudo apt-get install mysql-server 

This instruction will install MySQL 5.5, you will be asked to choose a password, 
REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORD as you will need it for your GeoNetwork con¬ 
figuration. 

6. Final update: Execute the commands: 

(a) sudo apt-get update (this updates the software lists available) 

(b) sudo apt-get upgrade (install the latest versions of the packages installed) 

MySQL, Tomcat and ANZ-MEST installation and 
configuration 

These are the simplified instructions for installing GeoNetwork. These assume that the 
GeoNetwork installation CD is still in the CD/DVD drive: 

1 . cd /opt 

2. sudo tar xzpf /medla/cdrom/GeoNetwork/geonetwork.tgz 

3. mysql -u root -p < /medla/cdrom/GeoNetwork/geonetworkjnysql_db. sql 

The above MySQL instruction will prompt you to enter your MySQL password. 

Edit the following files using sudo vi: 

1. /opt/BlueNetMEST/tomcat/conf/context.xml 


39 


2. /opt/BlueNetMEST/web/geonetwork/WEB-INF/config.xml 

3. /opt/BlueNetMEST/dist/web/geonetwork/WEB-INF/config.xml 

and replace any occurence of the string irasm902 by your MySQL password. 

The following instructions will ensure that the GeoNetwork server starts automatically 
when rebooting the PowerEdge: 

1. sudo cp /media/cdrom/GeoNetwork/geonetwork /etc/init.d 

2. cd /etc/rcl.d 

3. sudo In -s ../init.d/geonetwork K98geonetwork 

4. cd /etc/rc2.d 

5. sudo In -s ../init.d/geonetwork S98geonetwork 

At this point, restart the GeoNetwork server: 

sudo /etc/init.d/geonetwork start 

All default passwords are listed in the geonetwork.credentials .txt file on the instal¬ 
lation CD. It is recommended that you modify these passwords and keep a record of the 
values. 

Execution and testing 

To check if GeoNetwork is running: 

ps -elf Igrep java 

You should see a single Java process. Finally, you can connect remotely to the server using 
any browser using the following URL path: 

http://geoserver:8080/geonetwork 

where geoserver is the hostname you chose for hosting the GeoNetwork site. The web 
browsers currently supported by GeoNetwork are Internet Explorer v6-i- (Windows), Fire- 
fox vl.5-i- (All), Safari v3-i- (Mac OS X Leopard). Note that Google Chrome was used for 
this investigation without any noticeable problem. 

If the URL path is not working, verify the connectivity of the server to the network with 
commands such as ping geoserver. Check also if geoserver is recognized by your local 
DNS server. Contact your IT Administrator to solve this issue. 

If for some reason, you need to start GeoNetwork manually: 

sudo /etc/init.d/geonetwork start 
To stop GeoNetwork manually: 

sudo /etc/init.d/geonetwork stop 
If you need to adjust the Java memory parameters Xms and Xmx, edit the file: 


40 


/opt/BlueNetMEST/bin/start-geonetwork-tomcat.sh 

Tomcat errors are loggued in /opt/BlueNetMEST/tomcat/logs/catalina. out. GeoNet- 
work logs are loeated in /opt/BlueNetMEST/bin/logs/geonetwork. log. All other 
Ubuntu log files are loeated in the /var/log direetory. 

For further details about GeoNetwork eonfiguration, refer to seetion 7 of [6]. For instanee, 
you may have to eonfigure GeoNetwork to allow harvesting from a proxy proteeted site. 
Note that the eurrent installation already eontains a group named MIS and some users. 
Their logins/passwords are also in the geonetwork.credentials . txt file on the installa¬ 
tion CD. 

Refer to the annex of [6] for a eomplete GUI-based installation of ANZ-MEST . The eurrent 
installation instruetions are simplified for a maehine without GUI aeeess.
