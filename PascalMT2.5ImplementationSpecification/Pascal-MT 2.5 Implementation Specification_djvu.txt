Pascal/MT Implementation Specification 

November 8, 1979 
Release 2.5 


-1” Distributed, Implemented and Maintained by : 

MetaTech, 8672-1 Via Mallorca, La Jolla, Ca. 92037 
(714) 223-5566 x289 or (714) 455-6618 

-2- Machine: Intel 8080/8085 and Zilog Z80 

-3- System Configuration : 

•Pascal/MT operates under the CP/M operating system (or and equivalent system such as CDOS, 

IMDOS, etc.) in a minimum of 32K bytes of memory. 

The package consists of a compiler and symbolic debugger and generates 8080/Z80 object 
code directly from the Pascal program source. 

The symbolic debugging package is optionally copied into the output object file by the compiler. 
-4- Distribution: 

The Pascal/MT package is distributed on a single density 8-inch floppy diskette which contains: 

The compiler for Pascal/MT 

The symbolic debugging package 

The text for the compiler error messages 

Two utility programs written in Pascal/MT to Illustrate the facilities of the language 

Cost of a single system license for Pascal/MT (includes manual) is $99.95 

Manual available for $30.00 

Source for the run-time package is $50.00

Standard : 

Pascal/MT implements (in 2.5) a subset of the full Pascal language, 
both space and time* efficient code for 8-bit microcomputers. 


This was done to generate 


Pascal/MT also contains a number of "built-in” procedures. This allows source code using 
these procedures to be^portable to'other systems providing appropriate routines are implemented 
on the other systems. 


Pascal/MT omits the following features from the Pascal standard (Jensen & Wirth 2nd Ed.): 
*No LABEL declaration and therefore no GOTOs 
Non-standard file support for CP/M files 
*Enumeration and Record types not implemented 
PACKED is ignored on boolean arrays 

All variables and parameters are allocated statically 
Items marked with a * are being implemented in the subsequent releases of Pascal/MT. 


-6- Extensions: 

Pascal/MT contains the following extensions (in release 2.5): 

Pre-declared arrays "INPUT” and "OUTPUT" for manipulating I/O ports directly. 

EXTERNAL assembly language procedure declarations for using pre-assembled 
routines (using PL/M parameter passing) 

OPEN, CLOSE, DELETE, CREATE, BLOCKREAD, BLOCKWRITE routines for accessing CP/M files. 
Logical un-typed boolean operators for and (&) or ({) and not (a/) 

18-digit 3CD arithmetic package. 

-7- Measurements: 

Compilation speed is approximately 600 lines/min. 6K bytes symbol table space is available in 
a 32K system and 38K bytes table space is available in a 64K system. Run-time code (without 
debugger) is 5 to 10 times faster than P-code systems, and is 1.5 to 3 times larger than P-code 
systems (but Pascal/MT requires no interpreter). 

Availability: 

Pascal/MT Release 2.5 is available immediately. 

Enhanced releases will be made periodically throughout the next year.
