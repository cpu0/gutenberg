PREFACE 


VIGIL is sold on an "as-is" basis. Neither 
the author nor ABACUS SOFTWARE makes any 
warranty with respect to the software or 
the documentation as to its quality, performance 
or fitness for any particular purpose. Neither 
the author nor ABACUS SOFTWARE assumes any 
responsibility for the failure of this package. 


We at ABACUS SOFTWARE have been very enthusiastic about VIGIL 
ever since ROY WAINWRIGHT approached us about adding this game 
and graphics interpreter to our product line. 

Roy has worked for over a year developing VIGIL. The results of 
his diligence is this fine package. 

Roy created VIGIL using a very modest development system. How is 
this setup for a development system? 

* 8K OLD ROM PET 

* Built-in cassette drive for mass storage 

* Second cassette drive 

* Dot matrix printer 

* 6502 assembler written in BASIC 

So Roy developed VIGIL the HARD WAY. The VIGIL interpreter 
consists of more than 2000 assembler statements. His assembler 
being written in BASIC, takes more than 5 hours to complete the 
assembly. And Roy has assembled the VIGIL interpreter countless 
times. How is that for dedication, not to mention patience? He 
told me that he doesn't mind the long assemblies except when the 
cassette drive starts acting up forcing him to start all over 
again. He does admit however, that his wife has sometimes been 
delegated to oversee some of these long assemblies. So we must 
graciously thank Mrs. Wainwright too. 

The vast array of VIGIL commands provide the means to create 
interactive programs for the PET/CBM. But the real power of 
VIGIL is the ease with which these games and graphics 
applications can be developed and the performance advantages that 
the language offers over BASIC. 

We feel that VIGIL represents a genuinely new language for the 
PET/CBM user. We hope that you agree with our evaluation that 
Roy has a winner with his VIGIL. My thanks to Roy for entrusting 
ABACUS SOFTWARE with his "pet" VIGIL program.

VIGIL COMMAND SUMMARY A1 



INTRODUCTION- 


VIGIL is a new language for programming interactive games and 
graphics on the PET. The VIGIL program is an interpreter that 
executes VIGIL language commands to perform game and graphic 
interaction with the user. VIGIL is patterned after the Chip-8 
game language available on the RCA COSMAC VIP computer, but has 
much greater capabilities. 

It is much easier to program video games and graphics using VIGIL 
than using BASIC. It is easy to display and move patterns based 
on screen corrdinates. Also, testing for pattern collisions 
(hits) is easy. 

Programs are entered into the computer using the BASIC text 
editor built into the PET, the same way as programming in BASIC. 
The VIGIL program executes the game programs and performs video 
graphics at speeds higher than BASIC allows. VIGIL commands 
consist of BASIC keywords (such as GOTO, GOSUB, LET, etc.) and 
single letters or characters (E, =, >, etc.). One or more 
operands identify the data or register(s) to be used by the 
commands. Commands include instructions for arithmetic, logical 
and random functions. 

Two timers are available under program control. Input commands 
read the full keyboard as well as a 16-position (4X4 pattern) 
version of the PET numeric keyboard. The parallel user port can 
read joysticks or other attached devices. Normal output is on 
the screen. VIGIL sounds a tone if an audio amplifier is 
attached to the PET user port. Pitch and duration are program- 
controlled and operate simultaneously with screen action. 
Commands are also provided for memory access anywhere in the PET 
memory (including I/O areas) and for loading and executing 6502 
machine-language subroutines. 

This manual assumes that you have experience using BASIC on the 
PET. Some sections assume a knowledge of hexadecimal notation, 
arithmetic and logical operations (AND, OR, EXCLUSIVE-OR). 
However you can immediately see VIGIL in action by following the 
directions in one of the following sections: 

GETTING STARTED ON A TAPE SYSTEM 
GETTING STARTED ON A DISK SYSTEM 

Subsequent sections introduce you to the VIGIL language commands 
and cover more advanced topics.

- GETTING STARTED ON A TAPE SYSTEM - 

This section is intended to show by example how to use the VIGIL 
language system if you have a PET/CBM and a cassette tape 
recorder. 

The VIGIL distribution tape contains three different copies of 
the VIGIL interpreter on one side of the tape and the nine 
preprogrammed games on the other side of the tape. 

Versions of the VIGIL interpreter are available for the three 
different ROM sets that have been produced by COMMODORE for the 
various models of PET/CBM computers. The three versions are on 
the tape in the following order: 

Name on cassette Use if you have following powerup message 

VIGIL-ROM 1.6 *** COMMODORE BASIC *** 

VIGIL- ROM 2.0 ### COMMODORE BASIC ### 

VIGIL-ROM 4.0 *** COMMODORE BASIC 4.0 *** 

You will need to use the VIGIL interpreter that is appropriate 
for your particular model PET/CBM computer. You may load the 
appropriate version of the VIGIL interpreter by first rewinding 
the distribution cassette and typing: 

LOAD "VIGIL-ROM X.0" where X is the ROM version desired 

Type RUN and press RETURN. You should save this version onto 
another cassette tape by holding the SHIFT key and pressing V 
(save VIGIL) and RETURN. Use this new cassette tape as your 
working copy of VIGIL while retaining the original as a backup. 

You may want to save the other versions if you want to use VIGIL 
on other model PET/CBMs. We hope that you won't distribute 
illegal copies of VIGIL. VIGIL and all VIGIL documentation are 
COPYRIGHTED materials. 

The other side of the cassette tape contains the preprogrammed 
games. There are nine different games, and they are on the tape 
in the following order: 

1. BREAKOUT 

2. ANTI (anti-aircraft) 

3. SPACE-WAR 

4. SPACE-BATTLE 

5. U.F.O. 

6. CONCENTRATION 

7. MAZE 

8. KALEIDOSCOPE 

9. FORTUNE

The following are the instructions for using VIGIL with a 
cassette drive. You must use cassette drive #1. 


Insert the VIGIL interpreter tape into the cassette 
drive, making sure that it is completely rewound. 

Press and hold the SHIFT key and press the RUN/STOP 
key. 

Press PLAY on cassette drive #1. After the VIGIL 
interpreter is loaded, the message "RETURN, NO GOSUB, 
LINE #63110" will appear, along with a display 
of the 26 VIGIL registers. This is normal for VIGIL 
startup, since only the skeleton program has been 
loaded. 

Remove the tape containing the VIGIL interpreter from 
the cassette drive. Insert the tape containing the 
nine preprogrammed games into the cassette drive, 
making sure that it is completely rewound. 

To load the first game program from tape, simply hold 
the SHIFT key and press RUN/STOP again. The BREAKOUT 
program will be loaded and will start automatically. 

To load a game by name, simply type LOAD "gamename" 
and press RETURN. When the game finishes loading, 
type RUN and press RETURN. 

To stop any VIGIL game, press the RUN/STOP key 
(without SHIFT). 

When finished with VIGIL, it is necessary to restore 
the normal PET pointers and registers by typing SHIFT 
K and RETURN.

- GETTING STARTED ON A PISE SYSTEM - 


The following are the instructions for using VIGIL with a disk 
drive. 


This section is intended to show by example how to use the VIGIL 
language system if you have a PET/CBM and a disk system. 

The VIGIL distribution disk contains three different copies of 
the VIGIL interpreter and the nine preprogrammed games. 

Versions of the VIGIL interpreter are available for the three 
different ROM sets that have been produced by COMMODORE for the 
various models of PET/CBM computers. The three versions are on 
the disk in the following order: 


Name on diskette Use if you haye following powerup message 


VIGIL-ROM 1.0 
VIGIL-ROM 2.0 
VIGIL-ROM 4.0 


*** COMMODORE BASIC *** 

### COMMODORE BASIC ### 

*** COMMODORE BASIC 4.0 *** 


You should duplicate the VIGIL diskette to insure that you have a 
backup copy. However, we hope that you won't distribute illegal 
copies of VIGIL. VIGIL and all VIGIL documentation are 
COPYRIGHTED materials. 

VIGIL-ROM 1.0 version does not support the disk drive since 
COMMODORE does not support the disk drive with that level of the 
BASIC ROMS. You will need to use the VIGIL interpreter that is 
appropriate for your particular model PET/CBM computer. You may 
load the appropriate version of the VIGIL interpreter by typing: 

LOAD "VIGIL-ROM X.0",8 where X is the ROM version 

Type RUN and press RETURN. You should save this version onto 
another diskette by holding the SHIFT key and pressing Z and 
RETURN. Use this new diskette as your working copy of VIGIL 
while retaining the original as a backup. 

The diskette also contains the preprogrammed games. There are 
nine different games: 

1. BREAKOUT 

2. ANTI (anti-aircraft) 

3. SPACE-WAR 

4. SPACE-BATTLE 

5. U.F.O. 

6. CONCENTRATION 

7. MAZE 

8. KALEIDOSCOPE 

9. FORTUNE 


Insert the diskette into drive 0. 

Type: LOAD "VIGIL-ROM X.0",8 and press RETURN to load 

the VIGIL interpreter (where X is 
the ROM version desired). 

After the VIGIL interpreter is loaded, type RUN and 
press RETURN. The message "RETURN, NO GOSUB, LINE 
#63110" will appear, along with a display of the 26 
VIGIL registers. This is normal for VIGIL startup, 
since only the skeleton program has been loaded. 

To load a game program from diskette type 
LOAD"gamename", 8 and press RETURN. When the game 
finishes loading, type RUN and press RETURN. The game 
program will then start. 

To stop any VIGIL game, press the RUN/STOP key 
(without SHIFT). 

When finished with VIGIL, it is necessary to restore 
the normal PET pointers and registers by typing SHIFT 
K and RETURN.

— COMMAND NOTATION- 


The "heart" of VIGIL is a set of 26 one-byte registers. These 
are referenced by the letters A-Z. Each can contain a one-byte 
hexadecimal number (0-255 decimal). 255 can also represent -1, 
254 = -2, etc. Commands are provided to set, move, shift, 
increment, compare and clear the registers. Register Z is used 
to signal the result of certain operations and to contain the 
high-order byte of multiply results (see footnotel). Registers S 
& T are reserved for use as timers (VIGIL automatically 
decrements these registers). Some routines use registers A-C and 
W-Y as working registers. All others may be used for any 
purpose. 

RND puts a random number into the specified register. The range 
of the number is from 0, to and including the number in the 
command, (255=0-255, 3=0-3, 17=0-17, etc.). 


any register (A-Z) 

any program line number (0-63999) 

any constant (0-255) 

any memory location (decimal)

Rr=Rr-Rs (RZ=0 if Rr<Rs, RZ=1 otherwise) 

Rr=Rr*Rs (multiply) 

Since product is two bytes in size, Rr contains 
the least significant byte and RZ contains the 
most significant byte of product. 

Rr is compared with Rs 

RZ=0 if Rr<Rs, RZ=1 if Rr>Rs, RZ=2 if Rr=Rs 
Rr=Rr OR'D with Rs 
Rr=Rr AND'D with Rs 
Rr=Rr EOR'D (exclusive or) with Rs 
Rr is shifted right one bit 

RZ contains old lo bit-(0 or 1) 

Rr is shifted left one bit 

RZ contains old hi bit-(0 or 1) 

Increment Rr by kkk (use 255 for -1, 254 for -2) 

Rr = Random number in range or 0 to kkk 

kkk is maximum value and 0 is minimum value 
Clear all registers (set to 0) 


^The product of two one byte numbers can be up to two bytes in 
size. The rightmost byte of the product goes into the register 
specified in the command. The leftmost byte goes into register 
Z. If the product is less than 256, register Z may be ignored.

-DISPLAY- 


-PROGRAM BRANCHING- 

The GOTO, GOSUB, and RETURN commands function in exactly the same 
way as the BASIC commands function. The ON command branches to 
one of a series of line numbers, depending on the value in a 
specified register. Note that if a line number is not specified 
for a particular value, no error is detected. Instead, the 
program continues with the next line. 

Conditional branching is accomplished by commands which test a 
condition specified by the command. If the condition is true, 
VIGIL executes the next command and continues. If the condition 
is not true, VIGIL skips the next command and continues with the 
second command after the test command. 


VIGIL has three powerful commands which increment a register, 
test the new value against high and low limits, and if the new 
value is within limits, program execution continues with the next 
line. If the new value is outside the limits, the program will 
go to either the low or high line number (depending on which 
limit was exceeded). The value of the increment and the limits 
are either values stated in the command or values in registers.

Increment Rr by Rs then test limits as above 
ZrStull111(LOW),lllll(HIGH)

limits respectively. 


T he VIGIL program treats the PET screen as a grid of 
wide by 50 points high. 


80 points 



The E (erase) command erases the entire screen. The D (display) 
command shows a pattern at the coordinates given by a pattern 
pointer. The pattern pointer "points" to a display pattern which 
is stored as a line in the program. Such lines are called 
literals and may be inserted anywhere within the program. 
Literals are ignored by VIGIL, except when referenced as data for 
a display or command. The P (point) command tells VIGIL which 
literal to use, by "pointing" to the line number of the literal. 

The bits in the literal are displayed using the "exclusive-or" 
logic function (see LITERALS - next section). Zero bits in the 
literal do not change the display. Each one bit within the 
literal will turn the corresponding display point on unless it is 
already on. In that case, the point is turned off and register Z 
is set to 1. Register Z is set to 0 at the start of each display 
command, so RZ may be tested to see if two patterns overlap. In 
games, this can be used to test for a "hit." A pattern displayed 
a second time at the same location on the screen will erase 
itself (and nothing else on the screen). Therefore, a pattern is 
moved by displaying it at the same place to erase it, changing 
the registers to the new position and then displaying the pattern 
again. 

The screen may be shifted to show lower case letters. However, 
since VIGIL uses the PET special characters to display patterns, 
shifting to lower case will ruin pattern displays (it's ok for 
tejct in messages, etc.).

kkk=12 normal operation (graphic chars)

-LITERALS- 

There are two types of literals: 

Character display literals consist of normal upper-case or lower¬ 
case characters plus special control characters for reverse 
field, etc. 

Hexadecimal literals are entered as two hexadecimal "nibbles." 
Each nibble (1/2 byte) consists of a digit 0-9 or a character A-F 
(representing 10-15). For example, the hex literal for decimal 
10 is 0A, decimal 17 is 11, and decimal 255 is FF. 

VIGIL displays patterns using hex literals as follows: Each byte 
of the literal is analyzed as two four-bit (nibble) patterns. 

The table of bits and patterns is as follows: 



Second and subsequent bytes of the literal are displayed below 
the first. To turn all 8 bits in a row on, the literal would be 
"FF". To turn only one bit on, the literal is "80". To display 
an airplane, the literal "8DFF11" shows: 


8D gives 
FF gives

kkk displaces pointer to right within literal 

Displace literal pointer to the right by the

There are 16 precoded display patterns for the hex characters 0-F 
(0-15 decimal). They are referenced by using the "A" command 
specifying a register. ViaiL will set the display literal 
pointer to one of the 16 patterns corresponding to the low-order 
(ri grht-hand) nibble of the register specified. Executing the 
display command w Dxy5" will show the pattern (at the coordinates 
from registers in the display command). Note that these precoded 
patterns are 5 rows high:, so you must use 5 in the display 
command. 

- CHARACTER DISPLAY- 

VIGIL includes commands to print character information on the 
screen. The cursor position determines where the message will 
start. The position of the cursor is controlled by the values 
given in X and Y commands. The literal pointer must be set fP 
command) to point to a program line containing the characters to 
be shown. The carriage return (<-> starts a new line under the 
first character shown. The THEN command combines the cursor 
positioning values and literal into one command. The DATA 
command shows the 3-digit value of a register.

-DECIMAL DISPLAY ROUTINE- 

There is a 3-digit decimal display routine included automatically 
in VIGIL source programs each time the command to clear the 
program space (shift C) is executed. The routine will display 
the 3-digit value of any register in large numbers. To use it, 
registers RX and RY must contain the position coordinates of the 
upper left corner of the leftmost digit to be shown. The value 
to be displayed must be copied to register RW (use the =Wr 
command). Then execute a GOSUB63000. The routine may be 
eliminated from your program if not needed. Note that the same 
rule applies as with any other VIGIL display: before displaying a 
new value, erase the old pattern (value) by re-displaying the old 
value. Register RX must be re-initialized before the re-display.

INPUT 


Since most input to game programs is a selection of options or a 
very small amount of data, only the PET numeric keyboard is 
needed. In order that it may be used as a 4 X 4 grid, the 
special characters are assigned values as follows: 

= 10 So VIGIL sees: 

= 11 

"=" = 12 

"+" =13 

«** - i4 

"/" ■ 15 


The INPUT command reads the numeric keyboard only when the RETURN 
key is pressed and puts the value 0-15 into the register 
specified. If no number key was pressed, the value 253 is 
stored. 

The H command puts the value from the numeric keyboard into the 
register when, the number key is pressed. It is not necessary to 
press RETURN. The READ command puts the ASCII value of any key 
pressed into the register specified. Both the READ and H 
commands return the value once per key depression. If the key is 
held down, any following READ or H command will not "see" any key 
(puts 255 into the register). The READ and H commands use the 
PET keyboard buffering system which stores keystrokes until the 
READ or H commands are executed. 

The GET command reads the keyboard immediately, so multiple GETS 
will return the key value as long as the key is held down. 

Special test and skip instructions are provided to control 
program functions based on the value from the keyboard. The test 
commands work the same as a GET, and "see" the live keyboard. 
User port instructions test the bits at the port against the bits 
in the values from the command. 

-INPUT COMMANDS- 

COMMAND OPERATION 

INPUTr Let Rr=key value (0-15) when RETURN pressed 
(waits for RETURN) 

READr Get keyboard ASCII char into Rr (only one time per 

depression) 

Hr Get keyboard value (0-15) into Rr (only time per 

depression)

TIMERS — 


The two VIGIL timers count down to 0. When a value is loaded 
into a timer, VIGIL decrements the number until it is zero. 
Countdown continues during program execution. Expiration of the 
count is determined by testing for 0 in the timers. The WAIT 
command stops program execution until countdown is complete. The 
timers are the registers S and T. Register S counts down by one 
each second. Register T counts down by one, 60 times per second. 
Use of these registers for any other purpose may give strange 
results. Maximum counts are 4.24 (255/60) minutes and seconds 
respectively. 

-TIMER COMMANDS- 


Set seconds timer =kkk 
Set 60/sec timer =kkk 
Set seconds timer from Rr 
Set 60/sec timer from Rr 

Wait until second timer =0, then continue 
Wait until sec/60 timer =0, then continue 

- TONE OUTPUT- 

VIGIL also has provision to output various tones using the PET 
CB2 line on the user port. If an amplifer is connected to that 
line, the commands CONT and Q will sound a tone. The duration of 
the tone depends on the value (like timer T, time is measured in 
60ths of a second). The pitch of the tone may be altered by the 
CMD command. A value of 255 will give the lowest pitch and low 
values will give very high pitches. VIGIL sets the pitch value 
to 140 at the start of the program. This corresponds to A=440. 
The formula for the value is: (62500/F)-2, where F is the desired 
frequency in cycles/sec. The PET memory location which controls 
the pitch is 59464. The CMD command places a specified value in 
that location to alter the pitch. The VIGIL POKE or K commands 
may be used to alter that position.

To save a game program to cassette, type SHIFT S (save) and 
RETURN. To save a game program to diskette, type SHIFT D (save 
to disk) and RETURN. If line 5 is missing, the message "OUT OF 
TEXT LINE NOT FOUND" will appear. 

When writing is complete, the game program my be verified by 
typing VERIFY for cassette or VERIFY"gamename",8 for diskette. 

You may also save the entire VIGIL program along with any game 
program in memory. To save VIGIL and the game to cassette, type 

SHIFT V (save VIGIL to cassette) and RETURN. To save VIGIL and 

the game to diskette, type SHIFT Z (save VIGIL to diskette) and 
RETURN. Line 5 is the label, as with the game programs. The 
VERIFY command may also be used to check the saved file. To save 
only the VIGIL interpreter program, type SHIFT C (clear) to reset 
the game program space, insert a line 5 with the label you want, 
and then type SHIFT V and RETURN (to save VIGIL to cassette) or 
SHIFT Z and RETURN (to save VIGIL to diskette).

-VIGIL ERROR MESSAGES 

During execution of VIGIL, commands are checked for validity. rf 
any errors are found, operation of the program will stop and one 
of the messages below will be shown to indicate the cause of the 
error. The line number in error will also be shown, along with 
the contents of all 26 registers. If the "OUT OF TEXT LINE NOT 
FOUND" message is shown, the line number VIGIL is looking for 
preceeds the message. The process of program debugging can be 
facilitated by inserting an invalid instruction (such as the 
command F) at the end of a section of the program. This will 
stop processing at that point and display the registers. 


ERROR MESSAGES AND THEIR MEANIMG: 

INVALID CMD —— VIGIL cannot understand the command. Sometimes 
this is caused by VIGIL commands which accidentally make up 
BASIC keywords (such as IF5) . If this happens, change the 
registers used to avoid the keyword. 

OUT OF TEXT, tLINE NOT FOUND-This error will occur when VIGIL 

reads the last line of text and it is not a GOTO command.- 
This error may also be caused by a GOTO, GOSUB, ON, P, STEP, 
B, or Z command which specifies a line number not in the 
program. The line number before this message is the line 
number VIGIL is looking for. The line number below the 
message is the one with the bad line number. 

NO OP 1-The first register in the command is missing. 

NO OP 2-The second register in the command is missing. 

LITERAL SIZE-The " at the end of the literal has been found 

before the command is complete. This can be caused by the 
literal being too small or if the pointers to the literal are 
misplaced (using the NEXT command). This can also be caused 
if a P command has been forgotten. The line number shown 
w ith the message is the line number of the command. The 
literal will be the last one referenced before this line. 

RETURN, NO GOSUB-A RETURN command has been encountered 

without a matching GOSUB. This is usually caused by an error 
in the sequence of sections, so VIGIL runs into the RETURN 

before the GOSUB. The line number shown is that of the 

RETURN line.

- A FIRST LESSON IN VIGIL PROGRAMMING - 

The easiest way to learn to use the VIGIL language is to try some 
examples - 

Try a display. You don’t have to key the explanations which are 
in (). After typing SHIFT C (clear program space) and RETURN, 
key the following: 

10LETG45 

20LETR37 

30P100 (Set literal pointer to line 100) 

40DGR4 (Display pattern pointed to by line 100 at the 
coordinates given by register G [X coordinate] and 
R [Y coordinate]. Since G= 45 and R= 37, the 
pattern will start at point 45,37. The 4 says to 
display a 4-row pattern.) 

60STOP (The program will stop here.) 

100"F820797F" (This is the pattern for a left-going 
helicopter.) 



Type LIST to check that these commands have been inserted 
correctly, then type RUN. The screen will clear and the 
helicopter will show near the lower right corner. The message 
"PROG HALT LINE #00060" will also show. 

Next try a moving pattern. Type SHIFT C and RETURN to clear out 
the previous program. 

10LETA0 (X coord) 

20LETB10 (Y coord) 


30P100 (point to 
40DAB4 (show disp 

50DAB4 (erase dis 
60STEPA1,0,71,0,200 


(point to display) 

(show display) 

(erase display before moving) 


60STEPA1,0,71,0,200 (add 1 to A: if A>71 go to line 200, 

else continue) 

70GOTO40 (go back to display at next A position) 

100"1F049EFE" (helicopter going right) 



200STEPB1,0,46,0,300 (add 1 to B: if B>46 go to line 300, 

else continue) 

210DAB4 (display) 

22QDAB4 (erase display before moving) 

230GOT0200 (go back to step) 

300STOP 


19 




After listing the program to check it, type RUN. The helicopter 
will go across the screen and descend. 

Now change line 300 to GOTOIO. 

This will make the program repeat continuously. To stop it, use 
the STOP key. Note that all registers and the line number are 
shown. 

To make a pattern flash, use the timer. Simply set it, then test 
it for zero. If it is not zero, go back and retest until it is 
zero. Reset the program space with a SHIFT C and RETURN. Then 
key in: 


10LETA15 
20LETB27 
30P100 

40DAB4 (show the helicopter again) 

50INTI5 (set the timer for 15/60 sec) 

60$T0 (test timer (RT) FOR 0 - do next if unequal) 

70GOTO60 (go to test timer) 

80GOTO40 (go back to display to erase) 

100"1F049EFE" (helicopter pattern) 

Try different values in the INT statement to get a feel of the 
timer. 


Now use the built-in display routine — 


10LETS60 
20LETX60 
30LETY30 
40 =WS 

50GOSUB63000 

60@WS 

70GOTO60 

80LETX60 

90GOSUB63000 

100 G0T02 0 


(set seconds timer to 60) 

(set x-coord) 

(set y-coord) 

(move timer value to RW) 
(perform subroutine) 

(do next if KW=RS - no change) 
(go back to test) 

(RX must be reset to X-coord) 
(perform routine to erase) 

(go back and show next value) 


Now try messages — 

Reset the program space SHIFT C and RETURN. 

Then type: 

10THEN40,25,"THIS IS A TEST <-tLITERAL\ MESSAGE" 
20DEF14 (set lower case) 

30TBEN4G,35,"(HOLD SHIFT DOWN)ALSO LOWER CASE* 

40 STOP 


To try the random function, the following program fills the 
screen on random coordinates: 


10P20 
20-80" 
30RNDX7 9 
40RNDY49 
50DXY1 
60#Z0 
70GOTO30 


(literal for a single dot) 

(random # from 0 to 79) 

(random # from 0 to 49) 

(display dot) 

(do next if Z=0) 

(display next point if Z*Q, meaning no hit) 


7 0GOTO30 
80DXY1 

90GOTO30 


(display next point if Z=0 , meaning no hit) 

(if dot hits another, it will clear it. This 
turns it back on) 

(go back to loop) 


20 


21 








-MORE ADVANCED COMMANDS — 

-REFERENCING WITHIN LITERALS- 

The P command points to the first position (left end) of a 
literal. To point to a starting position elsewhere in a literal, 
type + and the displacement, after the line number in the 
command. For example, P100+4 points to the fifth position in a 
literal on line 100. For character literals, the displacement is 
the number of characters. For hexadecimal literals, it is the 
number of nibbles. 

It is also possible to point to various places within a literal 
under program control by using the NEXTr command. When NEXT is 
executed, the value in the register specified in the NEXT command 
is added to the current literal pointer. 

For example: 

10LETA4 (RA=4) 

20P100 

30NEXTA (move ptr by value of reg A (4)) 

40DAB1 
100"0123 45 " 

will display the pattern 45 instead of 01. 


—- REGISTER/MEMORY TRANSFER- 

Data can be transferred between registers and literals with the V 
and U commands. Transfers always start with register A. The 
command specifies the last register to be transferred. The 
literal pointer must be set before the V/U command by a P 
command. The literal must have two spaces for each register to 
be transferred. 

V transfers hexadecimal data to registers from a literal. For 
example, VD will transfer hex data from a literal into registers 
A,B,C, and D. 

U transfers register contents to hexadecimal literals. For 
example, UF will unload registers A through F into a literal (it 
would have to be at least 12 positions since each register is two 
nibbles). 


of the register. For example, if the register contains 197, the 
Mr command will set the literal " "to "010907". The 

normal next step is the VC command to load the 3 values 
(01 ,09,07) into registers A, B, and.C. Then the A command is 
used to select the display pattern for each digit. For an 
example, see the routine at line 63000 created automatically by 
the SHIFT C command after loading VIGIL. 


-PEEK/POKE- 

The command R reads a memory location into a register. The K 
command does the opposite. A special POKE command puts a string 
of hex data into memory. This makes it easy to include 6502 
machine language routines. These commands can also be used to 
access the I/O areas of PET memory. 


-REGISTER/LITERAL COMMANDS- 

COWHANDS OPERATION 

Ur RA thru Rr are unloaded into literal 

Vr RA thru Rr are loaded from literal 

Mr Literal is set to 3-digit decimal value of Rr 


- MEMORY PEEK/POKE COMMANDS- 

OQHHANDS OPERATION 

Rrmmmmm Read contents of memory address mmmmm(decimal) into Ri 
Krmmmmm Put Rr contents into memory location mmmmm(decimal) 
POKEmmmmm,"." 

Put hex data contained in "." literal into memory 

positions starting at mmmmm(decimal) 


-MACHINE LANGUAGE ROUTINES- 

COWHANDS OPERATION 

USRmmmmm Jump to machine language routine at mmmmm(decimal). 

Routine must end with RTS (HEX=60) instruction. 




-DECIMAL DECODE- 

In order to display the contents of a register in decimal using 
the large display numbers, it must first be decoded into a 6- 
nibble literal. This is done using the M command after setting 
the literal pointer to a 6-position "empty" literal. When the M 
command is executed, VIGIL sets the literal to the decimal value 


22 


23 












- HOW IT WORKS- 

The BASIC text editor built into the PET's read-only memory 
stores BASIC text in memory if the first character is numeric 
(line number). During the process, it scans the input line 
looking for BASIC keywords (IF, GOTO, etc.). When a keyword is 
found, it is converted to a special one-byte character. The 
remainder of the line is stored as keyed. This saves memory 
space and greatly speeds up execution of programs. VIGIL has 
been designed to read the text editor output in memory as its 
program. This makes it easy to key, modify, and list VIGIL 
programs exactly like BASIC. If a printer is attached, programs 
may be listed on it easily. The only disadvantage of the BASIC 
text editor is that it ALWAYS searches for keywords. This may be 
a problem when a VIGIL command and its register letter(s) form 
BASIC words accidentally (IF255 - increment RF by -1). BASIC 
will convert the "IF" to a one-byte special character. When 
VIGIL trys to execute that, it will stop on INVALID COMMAND. 
Simply change the register usage to avoid the keyword. 

The first instruction of every VIGIL program must be SYS826. 826 
is the starting location of the VIGIL interpreter program, the 
program which reads the game program and executes VIGIL commands. 
At the end of the program (or on the STOP key), VIGIL returns 
control to the BASIC text editor again. 

PET BASIC expects the text to start at location 1024 (400 hex). 
In order to fit the VIGIL program into memory, and to allow the 
VIGIL text to extend into extra memory, the text starts at 
location 4864 (1300 hex). But this prevents the use of the BASIC 
SAVE command which always begins SAVEing at 1024. VIGIL has a 
special tape and disk save routine. Keying a SHIFT S (save to 
tape) starts the save of a VIGIL game program to tape. Keying a 
SHIFT D (save to disk) starts the save of a VIGIL game program to 
disk. The entire VIGIL program plus any game program can be 
saved by keying a SHIFT V and RETURN to save to tape and by 
keying SHIFT Z and RETURN to save to disk. The VIGIL save 
routines require line 5 to contain the tape or disk label. This 
must be a REM statement. The label will be the first 16 
characters following the REM. The LOAD and VERIFY commands work 
unchanged with VIGIL. 

Because various low-memory pointers used by BASIC must be changed 
to upper memory addresses for VIGIL programs, a reset is 
necessary to change these pointers back to normal settings. 
Keying a SHIFT K (kill VIGIL) does this. 


24 


-PROGRAM EFFICIENCY- 

Comments on a program line are useful for documentation and do 
not slow execution at all (although they do increase loading 
time). One of the most time-consuming parts of the execution of 
VIGIL programs is the searching for line numbers in GOTO, GOSUB, 
and P commands. VIGIL looks two ways — if the desired line 
number is greater than the current line number, it scans forward 
— if not, it starts scanning from the beginning of the program. 
Therefore, the WORST place for a literal or subroutine is just 
BEFORE the requesting line. Better places are either shortly 
after the requesting line or at the beginning of the program. 

Another way to improve game speed is to minimize the number of 
constants in commands (such as IC15). VIGIL must convert the 15 
to hexadecimal every time the command is executed. The program 
will execute faster if a register is set to 15 once at the 
beginning of the program (LETU15) and then the add command is 
used to increment register C (+CU). 

Each display command waits for the TV retrace time (every 1/60 
second) to move data to the screen. This minimizes the "snow" on 
the screen, but it slows down program execution if many patterns 
are displayed. The synchronization routine may be nullified by 
including the following command in the VIGIL program: 
POKE894,"01". To restore synchronization: POKE894 ,"00". The 
synchronization control is reset at the beginning of every 
program.

VIGIL 


PROGRAM ORGANIZATION- 


Because the VIGIL display function requires re-displaying a 
pattern to erase it before moving it, display functions should be 
set up as subroutines. This minimizes the commands necessary and 
makes them easy to change as the program is being developed. 

Structured programming is an approach where subroutines are used 
extensively. The program is built in layers of GOSUB routines. 
This approach makes program writing easier because the top level 
of routines control the overall main flow of the program. Lower 
level routines are used to perform the detailed functions. In 
structured programming, the GOTO command is not used at all. 

VIGIL can work well with this type of programming. A suggested 
structure is: 

Standard VIGIL startup Sys commands lines 1-2 

Tape/disk label line 5 

GOSUBIOOOO perform initialization line 10 

GOSUBIOOO perform game mainline line 11 

Instructions to restart game lines 12-99 

Literals and subroutines lines 100-999 

Mainline (sub)routine lines 1000-9999 

Initialization (sub)routine lines 10000-62000 

See the programs included (ANTI, SPACE-WAR) for examples of this 
organization.

GAME PROGRAM LISTINGS 


The following pages contain listings of all programs included on 
the distribution tape or diskette. Comments have been added, 
along with explaination of the register usage to clarify the 
operation of the programs. 

If you have joysticks attached to your computer, the games which 
involve motion (BREAKOUT, SPACE-WAR, etc.) can be modified to use 
joysticks attached to the PET user port. Simply replace the "&" 
and "/" commands with the joystick commands and "NOT" 
respectively. The value of kkk in the command will have to be 
changed to sense the joystick output.

The TINY Pascal System turns your APPLE II or PET micro into a 16-blt P-machine. 
You too can leam the language that is slated to become the successor to BASIC. 
TINY Pascal offers the following: 

* LINE EDITOR to create, modify and maintain source 

* COMPILER to produce P-code, the assembly langauage of the P-machine 

* INTERPRETER to execute the compiled P-code (has TRACE) 

* Structured programmed constructs: CASE-OF-ELSE, WHILE-DO, IF-THEN- 
ELSE, REPEAT-UNTIL, FOR-TO/DOWNTO-DO, BEGIN-END, MEM, CONST, 
VAR ARRAY 


Our new TINY Pascal PLUS+ provides graphics and other builtin functions: 
GRAPHICS, PLOT, POINT, TEXT, INKEY, ABS AND SQR. The PET version sup¬ 
ports double density plotting on 40 column screen giving 80 x 50 plot positions. 
The APPLE II version supports LORES and for ROM APPLESOFT owners the 
HIRES graphics plus other features with: COLOR, HGRAPHICS, HCOLOR, 
HPLOT, PDL and TONE. For those who do not require graphics capabilities, you 
may still order our original Tiny Pascal package.
