4404 Al System 

The Tektronix 4404 Artificial Intelligence 
System provides a powerful, highly interac- 
tive environment for Al research and devel- 
opment. A low-cost desktop system, the 
4404 sets a new price/performance stan- 
dard for Al applications such as expert sys- 
tems, natural languages, vision systems, 
theorem proving, intelligent robotics and 
automatic programming. 

The 4404 comes standard with a high speed, 
proprietary implementation of Smalltalk-80, an 



extensible, object-oriented language which 
supports rapid prototyping and exploratory 
programming. Smalltalk-80, in conjunction 
with the 4404 display capabilities, offers the 
most sophisticated user interface available 
for Al program development. 

A bit-mapped graphics display with mouse 
input is closely coupled to the processor 
for a state-of-the-art user-interface. The 13- 
inch monochrome display has a 640 x 480 
pixel resolution and operates at 60 Hz, 
noninterlaced. It functions as a window into 
a 1024 x 1024 bit-map memory with smooth 
panning whenever the cursor reaches a 
physical display edge. The bit-mapped dis- 
play facilitates advanced concepts such as 
overlapping windows, "pop-up" menus and 
pointing with the mouse. Graphics perfor- 
mance makes screen animation possible. 
The full keyboard provides programmable 
function keys and a joydisk. 

4405 Al System 

The Tektronix 4405 Artificial Intelligence 
System joins the Tek 4404 and 4406 to of- 
fer a complete family of Al application de- 
velopment tools and delivery systems. The 
Tek 4405 offers a complete, state-of-the- 
art, personal Al development system that ri- 
vals units costing much more. 

Delivering significantly more processing 
power than the 4404, the 4405 is ideally 
suited for larger Al efforts. It provides all 
the software and hardware capabilities 
needed for developing major artificial intelli- 
gence programs. 

As with the 4404, the Smalltalk-80 program- 
ming environment is included standard with 
the 4405. 



4406 Al System 

The Tektronix 4406 Artificial Intelligence 
System is the highest performance mem- 
ber in the compatible 4400 Series Al Sys- 
tems. The 4406 has the power and memory 
to handle even the most complex Al pro- 
grams with speed and efficiency. The sys- 
tem includes a 32Mb virtual memory ad- 
dress space, a full 2Mb of dynamic RAM 
(expandable to 6 Mb) and a 90 Mb hard 
disk. The optional 4944 Mass Storage Unit 
further enhances 4406 performance by pro- 
viding incremental 90 Mb hard disk back-up. 
The 4406 inherits the innovative design and 
advanced manufacturing techniques pio- 
neered by the 4404. Employing VLSI archi- 
tecture and 32-bit data paths, the 4406 is 
nearly twice as powerful as the 4404. It is 
equally appropriate for Al research, applica- 
tion development, or as a cost effective de- 
livery system. 

Al Programming Environments 

The 4406 supports all the popular Al pro- 
gramming languages in use today. Small- 
talk-80, Tek Common LISP, Prolog, and 
Franz LISP all run on the 4406. Programs de- 
veloped on the Tektronix 4404 and 4405 are 
upwardly compatible with the 4406.

Smalltalk-80 



Extensible, Object-Oriented Programming 



Bit-Mapped Graphics User Interface 
Designed for Exploratory Programmin g 

Smalltalk-80 combines an object-oriented 
programming language with the most ad- 
vanced user-interface available. Pioneered 
at Xerox PARC, Smalltalk-80 permits explor- 
atory programming through rapid proto- 
typing and experimentation. Smalltalk-80 
provides an interactive approach to solving 
complex problems. 

High Performance Implementation 

Tektronix' implementation of Smalltalk-80, 
combined with the powerful hardware archi- 
tecture of the 4400 Series, provides graphic 
response fast enough to support screen ani- 
mation under direct control of Smalltalk-80. 

Smalltalk-80 satisfies the needs of program- 
mers in the Al field and is ideal for Al re- 
search and development. Smalltalk-80 can 
be extended by defining new instances of 
an object class (each with its own internal 
state) or by defining an entirely new object 
class with a distinct set of rules and default 
behavior. The class structure of Smalltalk-80 
provides both multiple inheritance and hier- 
archical inheritance mechanisms. Over 200 
predefined classes support the data and 
control abstractions most commonly used in 
Al applications development. 

Original Windowing System 

Bit-mapped graphics and window manage- 
ment were originally developed for Smalltalk- 
80. The Smalltalk-80 Model-View-Controller 
window-based manager supports the cre- 
ation of new window-based applications. 
Multiple processes are supported with a vir- 
tually unlimited number of overlapping 
windows. 



70 



Smalltalk-80 supports primitive graphic func- 
tions such as scaling, translation, rotation, 
logical combination of pixels and text 
attribute modification through its integral 
"BitBIt" operator. 

Virtually any activity— text editing, file ma- 
nipulation, compilation, execution, de- 
bugging—can be performed at any time, re- 
gardless of the current state. The user sim- 
ply "opens" another window and proceeds 
with the new operation. Smalltalk-80 allows 
immediate access to any of its subsystems, 
whether user-defined or predefined, for in- 
spection or modification. 



PROLOG 



Configured for 4400 Series Al Systems 
Interactive Development Support 
Modular Development Capability 



PROLOG, as implemented on the 4400 Se- 
ries, is a unique language that allows pro- 
grammers to solve problems by specifying 
what answers are needed rather than de- 
scribing a detailed solution procedure. PRO- 
LOG is non-procedural, based entirely on 
logical relationships or rules, among an 
assortment of facts. 

PROLOG operates on the principle of "con- 
trolled deduction." The programmer creates a 
network of facts and rules that describe the 
known relationships between the elements of 
a problem. Once the logical network is de- 
fined, PROLOG makes logical inferences 
from the relationships when queried by the 
programmer. These characteristics make 
PROLOG ideal for many Al applications in- 
cluding expert systems, natural language pro- 
cessing, data base query languages and 
automatic programming systems. 

Performance for Complex Problems 

PROLOG makes complex problems easier 
to solve and reduces program development 
time. The inherent efficiency of PROLOG is 
enhanced by the power of the 4400 Series 
hardware. The PROLOG system is an ideal 
vehicle for both software development and 
end-user Al applications. PROLOG is one of 
the acknowledged languages in artificial in- 
telligence technology. Now, Tektronix adds 
the programmer productivity and applica- 
tion development tools needed to move Al 
into the marketplace.

TEK® Common LISP 

A Full Common LISP Implementation 



Optimized for 4400 Systems 



Rapid Prototyping o f Al Concepts 

Run Time Compiler for Optimized 
Machine Code 



TEK Common LISP has been specifically opti- 
mized and enhanced for the Tektronix 4400 
Series. It provides Al researchers and soft- 
ware developers with a personal LISP pro- 
gramming environment previously available 
only on dedicated LISP machines. 

Common LISP was conceived by a large 
committee of academicians and Al research- 
ers as a language that would incorporate the 
very best features of other LISP dialects. Tek 
Common LISP is a full implementation of this 
language (as specified in "Common LISP, the 
Language" by Guy Steele). It offers a much 
richer set of data types and more complex 
program structures than other LISP dialects 
currently in use. 

A New Standard 

Common LISP is considered by many artificial 
intelligence experts to be a new industry stan- 
dard for Al programming environments. This 
consensus is reflected in the general parame- 
ters established for the language: 
Commonality: Common LISP focuses the 
features of several different implementations 
of LISP into a common dialect. 
Portability: Applications written in Common 
LISP are easily ported to any Common LISP 
implementation. 

Expressiveness: Common LISP is a very rich 
language that employs the most valuable 
constructs from other LISP dialects. 
Efficiency: Common LISP has features de- 
signed to facilitate the production of fast, 
high-quality compiled code. 
Compatibility: Since Common LISP is derived 
from a number of popular dialects, code from 
other LISP dialects should readily map into 
Common LISP. 

Additional Tek Common LISP Features 

Additional features include a powerful opti- 
mizing compiler with built-in debugging fea- 
tures; lexically scoped interpreter and compil- 
er; full featured package system for symbol 
name differentiation; rich collection of numeri- 
cal primitives and built-in functions; built-in 
garbage collector and dynamic storage man- 
agement; complete implementation of arrays, 
vectors and strings; flexible interactive user 
interface; flexible debugging aids; powerful 
facilities for structures and macros; lexical clo- 
sures; built-in user-extensible data type facili- 
ty; and built-in user-extensible parser and 
hash-table facility. 

The rich set of primitives available in Common 
LISP makes the language an appropriate can- 
didate for expert systems, natural language 
interfaces, and all types of symbolic program- 
ming. Tek Common LISP goes beyond the 
specifications of the language to provide on- 
line documentation; a user-definable error 
handler; powerful and robust foreign function 
interfaces to C and FORTRAN programs and 
a built-in Ravors system for object-oriented 
programming.

Franz LISP 



Configu red (or 4400 Al Systems 

Full-Feature d Development Language 

Optimizing Compiler Generates 4400 Series 
Machine Code 

A commercial derivative of the MacLISP 
language from MIT, Franz LISP is the long- 
time favorite for Al programming because 
of its uniqueness as a high-level machine 
language for symbolic processing. Many 
natural languages and expert systems have 
been built using the recursive programming 
facilities of LISP. Traditionally, LISP has re- 
sided only on expensive mainframe com- 
puters. Now, Franz LISP is available on the 
4400 Series Artificial Intelligence Systems. 
A Powerful Al Programming Environment 
4400 Series LISP is a programming environ- 
ment that includes many tools to enhance 
research and development. Besides the 
popular language primitives, functions and 
data types, LISP contains a powerful macro 
facility, and allows programs written in oth- 
er languages to be called. The system sup- 
ports separately compiled functions, UNIX- 
like file accessing, and I/O redirection. 
The language provides dynamic storage al- 
location and garbage collection. It provides 
operators for creation, accessing, and ma- 
nipulation of data types, data type determi- 
nation, and structure comparison. Users 
may create their own data types out of 
vectors and specify how standard system 
functions, like print, should handle them. 
Franz LISP provides simple arithmetic func- 
tions, arithmetic predicates, trigonometric 
functions, "bignum" functions and a host of 
conversion and special purpose arithmetic 
functions. It includes a set of operators to 
allow dynamic error indication and recov- 
ery, with nonstandard control flows, 
through the powerful catch, throw and 
errset functions. 

Franz LISP in the 4400 Series environment 
provides many functions for communicating 
with I/O devices, including I/O redirection to 
and from files. It supports UNIX-like disk file 
operations such as direct file access with 
the fseek function, allowing reading or writ- 
ing at random locations within a file. 
Many system functions allow interaction 
with internal components of LISP and the 
operating system. These include new pro- 
cess generation from within a program with 
the process and signal functions. 



NEW 4400 UNIX EMACS Editor 

An extensible display editor used for typing 
and modifying documents, programs, or 
other kinds of text, the EMACS uses a dis- 
play to interact with the user, keeping an 
accurate representation of what is happen- 
ing in the text visible on the screen. EMACS 
interacts with the user through several win- 
dows and a line at the bottom of the termi- 
nal screen for messages and questions 
from EMACS. 

Extensibility 

This is the feature that distinguishes 
EMACS from most other editors, allowing 
the user to tailor EMACS to individual re- 
quirements and design. 

Interactive Help Menus 

The detailed menus ensure smooth opera- 
tion and understanding of EMACS help ar- 
eas, commands, and key functions. 

Buffers and Windows 

The EMACS user views the buffer— the sec- 
tion of text being edited— through a win- 
dow. A buffer may be viewed in several win- 
dows, so the user can work on or examine 
several different areas of a file at the same 
time. Similarly, two different buffers can be 
viewed in two different windows simulta- 
neously. 

Other EMACS features include definable 
macros to identify and facilitate working 
with blocks of program or text, an interpret- 
er for a language similar to LISP, debugging 
tools, program structure commands, and 
the ability to handle multiple interactive 
subprocesses.
