Abstract 

Static aeroelastic computations are made 
using a C++ executive suitable for 
closely coupled fluid/structure 
interaction studies. The fluid flow is 
modeled using the Euler/Navier Stokes 
equations and the structure is modeled 
using finite elements. FORTRAN based 
fluids and structures codes are integrated 
under C++ environment. The flow and 
structural solvers are treated as separate 
object files. The data flow between 
fluids and structures is accomplished 
using I/O. Results are demonstrated for 
transonic flow over partially flexible 
surface that is important for aerospace 
vehicles. Use of this development to 
accurately predict flow induced 
structural failure will be demonstrated. 

Introduction 

Aeroelasticity that involves strong 
coupling of fluids and structures is an 
important element in the design of 
aerospace vehicles. Monolithic (off-line) 
software to compute fluids and 
structures interaction studies by using 
low-fidelity methods such as the linear 
aerodynamic flow equations coupled 
with the modal structural equations are 
well advanced. 1 Although these low- 
fidelity approaches are used for 
preliminary design, they are not 
adequate for the final design of 
aerospace vehicles which need a high- 
fidelity approach to analyze complex 
flow/structure interactions. Modem 
supersonic transports that have highly 
swept wings can experience vortex- 


2 

induced aeroelastic oscillations. Figure 
1 illustrates flow induced structural 
oscillations that can occur for a typical 
supersonic transport when it flys in the 
transonic regime at moderate angles of 
attack. Structural oscillations can occur 
because of the strong coupling of 
unsteady leading edge vortices and wing 
structures. In order to predict this 
phenomenon, a capability to directly 
couple the high fidelity Euler/Navier- 
Stokes(ENS) equations with the modal 

3 

structures was needed In Fig. 1, the 
strong fluid/structure coupling at 8 
degrees angle of attack leads to sustained 
structural oscillation that degrades the 
flying quality of the aircraft. As another 
example, aeroelasticity of launch 
vehicles that involve strong coupling of 
fluids, structures and controls is an 
important element in the design 

4 w 

process. An instability can occur soon 
after the launch vehicle gets separated 
from its carrier. The phenomenon is 
dominated by complex flows coupled 
with structural motions. From the results 
presented in Ref. 4 it can be concluded 
that low-fidelity method was not 
adequate to completely understand the 
instability phenomenon which involved 
non-linear flows coupled with structural 
motions. High fidelity equations such as 
the Euler/Navier-Stokes (ENS) for fluids 
directly coupled with finite elements 
(FE) for structures are needed for 
accurate aeroelastic computations for 
which these complex fluid/structure 
interactions exist. Using high- fidelity 
equations involves additional 
complexities results from numerics such 


1 


as higher-order terms. Therefore, the 
coupling process is more elaborate when 
using high fidelity methods than it is for 
calculations using linear methods.

In recent years, significant advances 
have been made for single disciplines in 
both computational fluid dynamics 
(CFD) using finite-difference 
approaches 5 and computational 
structural dynamics (CSD) using finite- 
element methods. 6 For aerospace 
vehicles, structures are dominated by 
internal discontinuous members such as 
spars, ribs, panels, and bulkheads. The 
finite-element (FE) method, which is 
fundamentally based on discretization 
along physical boundaries of different 


structural components, has proven to be 
computationally efficient for solving 
aerospace structures problems. The 
external aerodynamics of aerospace 
vehicles is dominated by field 
discontinuities such as shock waves and 
flow separations. Finite-difference (FD) 
computational methods have proven to 
be efficient for solving such flow 
problems. 

A major task for fluid/structure 
interaction studies is to combine 
individual discipline codes into a single 
computational environment. To date, 
monolithic serial codes such as 
ENSAERO 7 and STAR 8 , have been 
developed using conventional 
programming techniques based on 
FORTRAN for main frame type 
supercomputers. In the last decade, 
several monolithic software tools such as 

9 

HiMAP , that work on single image 
parallel systems, were developed. These 
monolithic approaches are typically 
limited to a specific class of problems. 
Monolithic approaches are less 
accommodating to substitute of new 
single discipline alternative algorithms. 

In the field of computer science, a new 
paradigm of programming technique 
known as problem solving environment 
(PSE) has evolved since the last decade. 
The main purpose of PSE is to provide 
an engineering workbench for a designer 
to integrate single discipline codes. Also 
PSE’s are designed such that the 
application can run either on single 
image, parallel, or GRID (a net work of 
remotely distributed computers) 
computing environments. The main 
feature of a good PSE is that it should 
require minimal changes to the 
application codes and provide a seamless 
environment. For example, SCIRun 11 , a 


? 


PSE developed at University of Utah 
provides an environment to integrate 
finite element based solvers for fluids 
and structures. 

This paper describes an approach to 
compute coupled static aeroelastic 
computations that can be ported to PSE 
or GRID computing environment. The 
approach is based on C++ executive that 
controls the FORTRAN modules. A 
typical 3D aerospace problem of 
transonic flow over a thin flexible 
surface is analyzed.

Flow and Structural Equations 

In this paper computations are limited to 
Euler equations of motion. The strong 
conservative law form of the Euler 
equations is used for shock-capturing 
purposes. The equations in Cartesian 
coordinates in non-dimensional 14 form 
can be written as 

d\. ok cfy dz. 


It is assumed that fluids and structure 
solvers are independent executables. 
Interfaces from fluids to structures 
(FTOS) and structures to fluids (STOF) 
are also considered as separate 
executables. All communications are 
made through I/O. This facilitates to 
port the present development to 
distributed computing. More details of 
this process will be given in the full 
paper. 

During coupled calculations it is 
important to monitor the convergence 
data on the fly. Therefore a 2D plotting 
capability based on the XMGRACE 12 
open source software is included in the 
process. Also it is necessary to save data 
for high end graphic visualization. In 
this process a capability is built to save 
data in the FieldView format at user 
specified intervals. Fig 2 shows the flow 
diagram of the process.

The finite element approach is used to 
solve structural equations. In this effort a 
1 8-degree-of-freedomplate/shell element 
in TRIP3D software written earlier 
under NASA HPCC project is used . 16 

The element details are shown in Fig 3. 
U, V, and W are displacements degrees 
of freedom and Uxx, Vyy and Wzz are

procedure described in Chapter 13 (by 
Guruswamy) of Ref. 6 .

Fluid-Structure Interfaces 

The Euler/Navier Stokes flow solvers 
use either patched, overset grids or 
unstructured grids. The surface grid data 
for CFD is triangulated in order to 
interface with structures codes which is 
based on irregular unstructured grid. 
Efficient tools such as MIXSUR 17 
developed in association with 


OVERFLOW 5 are available for 

triangulating the complex surface grids. 

Figure 4 shows the possible CFD surface 

grids. Once triangulated data is 

available the next task is to interface 

with structures data. In this work the 

1 8 

robust area co-ordinate approach is 
used. 

In this process, fluid grid points are 
identified with respect to finite element 
structural nodes i, j and k as shown in 
Fig 5. The force P at a fluid grid point is 
computed using the control area 
associated with that point. The 
contribution of total force P at a given 
fluid point to the structural nodal forces 
Pi, Pj and P k are computed using 

Pi = (P x A[)/A ; 

Pj ~ (P x A 2 )/A ; (4) 

P k = (Px A 3 )/A 

where Ai , A?, and A 3 are areas of the 
sub-triangles and A is the total area in 
Fig 5. This procedure is repeated for all 
fluid grid points. 

The displacements dj, dj,' and d k from 
structural analysis, are interpolated to the 
fluid grid point using 

D = (dj x A 1 +dj x A 2 +d k x A 3 )/ A (5)

Coupled Aeroelastic Computations 

Coupled aeroelastic computations play 
an important role in the design of 
aerospace vehicles. Static divergence of 
launch vehicles is a typical example. In 
order to test the process for coupled 
static aeroelastic computations using the 


FORTRAN-based CFD and FEM codes, 
flow over partially flexible flat plate was 
selected. The flow is modeled using the 
streamwise - upwind 3D Euler/Navi er- 
Stokes solver G03D. lD The structures 
code selected was TRIP3D. 16 

Initially static aeroelastic computations 
are performed. First, loads are computed 
using G03D, and then they are 
transferred to TRIP 3D through an 
interface module FTOS. This interface 
involves interpolating loads from CFD 
structured surface grids to finite element 
nodes. As a first step, CFD structured 
surface grid is converted to triangular 
grids. Then area coordinate approach 
(eq. 4) is used for interfacing data 
between fluids and structures grids. 
Based on these loads, deformations and 
stresses are computed using TRIP3D. 





The structural deformations are 
interpolated back to CFD grids using 
area coordinate method in interface 
module STOF using Eq. (5). The results 
are monitored on the fly for convergence 
using XMGRACE 12 plot utility. 

The physical problem selected is a flow 

over partially flexible surface. Such 

configurations are common in space 

vehicles. Coupled fluid/structure 

interaction computations are often 

essential in designing such components. 

The classical example is panels of lifting 

19 

surfaces that can experience flutter. 
Figure 5 shows the configuration 
considered for the analysis. The size of 
the flexible plate is assumed to 1 inch 
long, 0.5 inch wide and 0.005 inch thick. 
The size of the flow surface is 5 inch 
long and 1.5 inch wide. A dynamic 
pressure of 1.4 psi is assumed for all 
computations.

The 3-D flow over the plate is solved 
using the Euler option of G03D. A grid 
size of 97 x 3 lx 34 is used for 
modeling the flow surface. The portions 
of surface and sectional grids are shown 
in Fig. 6. Structural deformations and 
stresses are computed using 64 plate 
elements of TRIP3D as shown in Fig. 7. 
For this type of configurations both

G03D and TRIP3D are well validated as 
independent solvers. 16 For accurate 
computations it is important to 
communicate data between fluids and 
structures every time step particularly 
when one or both systems are non-linear. 

Computations were made updating fluid 
structure information every 1, 2, and 4 
time steps for a case at M = 0.85 where 
flow is moderately non-linear. For 
selected parameter structures was linear. 
Fig. 8 shows the effect of frequency of 
update on results. Updating information 
every 2 time step introduces significant 
error. Updating information every 4 
steps is not acceptable. 

The distribution of pressure coefficient 
Cp is shown in Fig 9 on half surface and 
vertical plane at mid span. Adaptation

of CFD grid to structural deformation 
can be seen in the figure. Due to 
flexibility of surface there is significant 
change in pressure distribution. The 
structural deformation and corres- 
ponding stress distribution can be seen in 
Fig 10. The variation on flow Cp leads 
to large structural stresses. The peak 
structural stress occurs close to 65% 
span near the area where Cp has large 
negative values.

on deformed structural surface. 

Flow/structure interactions shown above 
can lead to unsteady flows and structural 
failures. The coupling will be strong 
during such failures. In the full paper use 
of present development to predict such 
failures will be demonstrated. 

Conclusions 

A procedure suitable for distributed 
computing to compute tightly coupled 
fluid structure interactions is presented. 
The infrastructure accommodates 
general CFD and FEM codes. Data 
management and communication is done 
using C++ language which facilitates to 
port ' the present development to 
distributed computing system. The need 
to update fluid structure interface data 
when one of the systems is non-linear is 
demonstrated for a 3D problem. In the 
full paper use of present development to 
predict flow induced structural failures 
where the coupling is strong will be 
demonstrated. More details will be given 
in full paper.
