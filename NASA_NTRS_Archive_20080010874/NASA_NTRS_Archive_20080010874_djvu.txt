Core Business 


• We perform all of the Trajectory Analysis, Pre-mission 
Design, Operations, and Post-Flight Assessments for the 
Manned Space Program 

- We support the Space Shuttle Program (SSP), 
International Space Station (ISS), Constellation Program 
(CxP) and other vehicles 

- We support Ascent, Orbit, Rendezvous, and Entry Phases

Core Business 


Analysis: 

- How changes in the vehicle, environment, or procedures 
impact the vehicles trajectory, performance, and margins. 

- Both nominal and off-nominal conditions. 

- We answer “what if type questions 
Pre-Mission Design: 

- Determines what the specific trajectory will be for an 
upcoming launch or mission phase 

- Determines the margins for the flight 

- Results in products that are consumed by the rest of the 
program

Core Business 


Operations: 

- Monitor the vehicle, Determine where the vehicle is, Tell 
the vehicle how to get where it needs to go 

- During critical phases (Ascent, Rendezvous, and Entry) 
system failures cannot be tolerated and performance is a 
key concern 

. Possible loss of crew and loss of vehicle 

- Done by flight controllers in a highly collaborative 
environment. A lot of concurrent use of data and user 
interaction with the system.

Testing Results 


•Hibernate/MySQL 

- Standard Java Application with clustered MySQL 

- 20 threads performing 25K transactions 

- 1800 inserts/sec using Hibernate 

- 2800 inserts/sec using JDBC 


- Integrated JEE Application with clustered MySQL 

- greater than 1000 merges per second per node 

- greater than 1MB per second per node 


Note: MySQL connection time limit is configurable, but 
connection time required during initial start up creates 
need for 10 sec timeout setting

Project Conclusions 


• Java application computational performance is 
acceptable given the proper hardware resources. 

• JEE specification and supporting technologies can be 
used as a platform for mission critical operations. 

• Open Source implementations of JEE, such as JBoss 
Enterprise Application Platform, are a viable alternative to 
custom enterprise solutions. 

• NASA could elect to focus it’s expertise on aerospace 
solutions and reuse existing open source middleware 
solutions.
