3.0 Activities 


The activities undertaken during this task emphasized moving the VRC from 
technical feasibility to a working resource by which NASA scientists and engineers could 
use the WWW to collaborate on specific experiments. In order to meet this objective, 
successful completion of the subtasks listed in the statement of work was required. 

As a member of the VRC team, UAH was able to satisfactorily address all three 
requirements. A data archiving system was completed that allowed experiment 
collaborators to check documentation in and out as required. By building this shared 
library, scientists and engineers now have the ability to work in a more collaborative 
environment, a requirement of the complex science typified by NASA researchers. 

The further development of the graphical user interface (GUI) and Internet 
security was addressed by the UAH team. The principal GUI for the VRC was enhanced 
to provide a more user friendly and intuitive approach to the VRC participant. The 
security issues, including encryption and password authentication, were a substantial 
effort within this task. 


All software and documentation for the VRC task have been delivered under 
separate cover. 

4.0 Conclusion and Recommendations 

During the period allocated by the delivery order, members of the UAH Research 
Institute Systems Management and Production Lab, with the cooperation of 
representatives from NASA, designed, developed and implemented enhancements to the 
VRC. These enhancements addressed the archival, graphical interface and security 
subsystems of the VRC. Upon completion of these features, a number of NASA 
experiments were included within the VRC, and access was granted to those scientists 
and engineers who were developing those experiments. 

It is recommended that the VRC continue to be developed and enhanced. With a 
system based on the Internet technology, it is imperative that the system be continually 
maintained and updated. As the Internet evolves to provide the world with more and 
more functionality, the VRC can provide ever-greater service to the NASA scientific 

community.

1.0 Introduction 


Geographically distributed project teams need an Internet based collaborative 
work environment or "Intranet." The Virtual Research Center (VRC) is an experimental 
Intranet server that combines several services such as desktop conferencing, file archives, 
on-line publishing, and security. Using the World Wide Web (WWW) as a shared space 
paradigm, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) presents users with images of a lunar 
colony. Each project has a wing of the colony and each wing has a conference room, 
library, laboratory, and mail station. 

In FY95, the VRC development team proved the feasibility of this shared space 
concept by building a prototype using a Netscape commerce server and several public 
domain programs. Successful demonstrations of the prototype resulted in approval for a 
second phase. Phase 2, documented by this report, will produce a seamlessly integrated 
environment by introducing new technologies such as Java and Adobe Web Links to 
replace less efficient interface software. 

2.0 Statement of Work 

The statement of work, as outlined in delivery order 169, was as follows: 

UAH shall perform the following specific activities: 

Experimental Internet Based Multi-Media Archive . Geographically distributed 
teams require tools for archiving project related documentation and media. This archive 
tool provides a graphical user interface for checking documents into and out of a remote 
file server. Presently, a prototype archiving system exists but the process for checking in 
and out documentation is only partially automated. In addition to on-line text documents, 
this archiving system shall provide links to a variety of audio and visual material. 

Experimental WWW User Interface . This task will apply HTML, Java, and 
Adobe Acrobat Web Links and develop an experimental GUI. The GUI will provide 
geographically distributed design teams access to a variety of collaborative computing 
utilities, multi-media presentations, and operating system scripts. Objectives of this 
experiment include comparing different techniques and technologies for client/server 
multi-application integration. 

Application of Encryption Technology in an Internet Testbed , Security is a major 
concern of teams comprising representatives from industry. This experiment will apply 
encryption technology to an Internet based collaborative work environment. UAH shall 
install an encryption system and develop a multi-level approach to security in an Internet 
based collaborative computing environment.
