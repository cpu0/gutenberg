A Little Ruby, A Lot of Objects 
Chapter 1 : We've Got Class... 



What's this? 
1 




The Integer 1 


How can I make a 2? 




2 


What's another way? 




2x1 

But that seems silly. 


Bear with me. 

How can I compute a 


6? 


3x2x 1 


How about 24? 




4x3x2x1 


Does all this look familiar? 


Yes. Isn't it a function called factorial? 



Right. Do you know what this means when It means "5 factorial". It computes the 
you see it in a math textbook? value 120 like this: 

5! 5x4x3x2x1 

Exactly. What do you suppose this Ruby The name tells me it computes factorial, 
function does? but I'm not sure how. 

def factorial(n) 
ifn == 1 

n 
else 

n * factorial(n-l) 
end 
end 



chl -factorial. rb 



Let's figure it out. Can you turn the 
computation of n! into a single 
multiplication? 



If I knew (n-1)!, then n! would be 
n x (n-1)! 



Look familiar? 



Yes, that's like this line of the def: 
n * factorial(n-l)

But what happens if the n in n! is 1? 



I better not multiply by zero, so I suppose I 
should stop. 



Stop? 



I mean I shouldn't multiply the argument 1 
by anything. I know the answer is 1 
without multiplying. 



Do you see that in the definition of 
factorial! 



Yes. That looks like the if statement that 
returns n: 

ifn == 1 

n 



So can you describe factorial in words? 



"If the argument n is 1, the result is 1. 
Otherwise, the result is n *factorial(n-l)." 



And what is the result of this? 
factorial(5) 



120, because that's the result of 

5 *factorial(4), which is in turn 

4 * facto rial(3), which is 3 *factorial(2), 

which is 2 * factorial 1), which is 1. 



This is an interesting style of programming 
- breaking problems into smaller pieces, all 
solved in the same way. Would you like to 
know more about it? 



I would. 



The book to read is The Little Schemer, by 
Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen. 



OK. But why should I keep reading this 
book? 



You already bought it. 



Actually, I'm just browsing in the 
bookstore. I happened to pass it while I was 
jogging vigorously and healthily after 
consuming a breakfast of cauliflower and 
wheat germ. 



Oh. Well, this book is about a different 
thing. It's about object-oriented 
programming in its most free and most 
fundamental form. 



That sounds interesting, but I have no idea 
what an "object" is. 



What if I told you this was an object: 
1 



I would be unimpressed. What does that 
mean? 



It means that you can do more to it than 
multiply and divide. 



Such as? 



DRAFT 



DRAFT 



What do you suppose this means? 
I. next 



2? 



Right. Can you describe what's going on? 



The Integer object I is asked for the next 
Integer, which is 2. 



The jargon is that I is sent the next 
message, and it answers (or returns) 2. 

And what does this mean? 
l.next.next 



3, because l.next is 2 and 2. next is 3. 
But somehow this doesn't seem an 
improvement on 1 + 1 + 1. 



It isn't - yet. But what do you suppose this 
would mean? 

5. new factorial 



Perhaps it would compute 51 in a new way, 
a way with messages. It would send the 
newjactorial message to 5, which would 
answer the result 120. But would that work 
if I tried it? 



Not yet. First we have to tell the Integers 
how newjactorial works. That means 
defining a method. A method is the 
function that's invoked when a message is 
received by an object. 

We'll define Integer's newjactorial like 
this: 

class Integer 

defnewjactorial 
??? 

end 
end 

How do you think newjactorial should 
work? 



Roughly We, factorial does. 

5. newjactorial should multiply 5 by 

4. newjactorial. 



DRAFT 



DRAFT 



Using the structure of factorial for 
new factorial, we get this: 

class Integer 
def new factorial 
if??? == 1 

??? 
else 

??? * (??? - I). new factorial 
end 
end 
end 



factorial took an argument n, which was 
used in those places, newjactorial doesn't 
have an argument. It doesn't need one. The 
number to compute with is the Integer 
newjactorial is sent to. 

So we need something other than n to use 
in those spots. 



Why are the ??? marks there? 



Within the definition of any method, self 
always means the object itself. 



So here is newjactorial: 

class Integer 
def new factorial 
if self = = I 

self 
else 

self* (self- 1). new factorial 
end 
end 
end 



chl -new-factorial.rb 



Can you say that in words? 



"I am an Integer. 

To compute new factorial, I first check 
whether I am 7. If so, I return myself, 1, the 
factorial of 1. 

If I'm bigger than 1, the right result is 
obtained by multiplying me by the factorial 
of the number one less than me." 



Excellent. And what does 5.newJactorial 
do? 



5.new_factorial sends the message 
"newjactorial" to an object of class 
Integer, which responds by invoking the 
method of the same name and returning its 
result. Is that right? 



DRAFT 



DRAFT 



Exactly. 



That's pretty neat. I confess that I'm a bit 
disappointed, though, that there are two 
kinds of computation: message sends like 
newjactorial, and ordinary 
multiplications. 



Ah, but there really aren't. Let's be 
explicit. What do you suppose is the result 
of this? 

5. send( "newjactorial ") 



That seems to be another way of writing 
"send the message newjactorial to 5", so I 
suppose the answer is 720. 



Precisely. And what do you suppose is the 
result of this? 

3.send("*", 2) 



Send the message * to the object 3, giving 
it the argument 2? That would mean the 
same thing as this: 

3 *2 
That is, 

6 



Right again. What happens in response to 
3*2 is the same old (or, rather, new) 
message sending. "3 * 2" is just syntactic 
sugar. 



Agh! Sugar is poison! 



The designers of some languages agree. 
They use less syntactic sugar. Everything is 
more explicitly a message send. But people 
have grown up expecting some things, like 
arithmetic, to look a certain way, so Ruby 
follows that convention. 



But underneath, all computation consists of 
sending messages to objects, possibly 
including other objects as arguments. 

When I write a program, I'll be continually 
saying, "O object, please do such-and-so 
for me, using these other objects to help", 
right? 



Exactly. In some cases, you'll be thinking 
explicitly in those terms. In others, you'll 
probably let the syntactic sugar hide the 
underpinnings from you. 

You saw another example of syntactic 
sugar earlier. Where's the sugar in this? 
factorial(5) 



factorial is the message, but it doesn't 
seem to be sent to any object, unlike 
newjactorial. There must be an implicit 
receiver when none is explicitly mentioned. 



DRAFT 



DRAFT 



That implicit receiver is self. So this: 

factorial(5) 
is exactly the same as this: 

self.factorial(5) 



I understand what self is when I write 
something like this: 

5. new factorial 
But what is it when I write: 

selffactorial(5) 
outside of any class or def! 



For the moment, I shouldn't say. But as 
long as factorial doesn't use self (which it 
doesn't), what exactly self is doesn't 
matter. I promise that you'll understand the 
answer by the end of the book. 



Thanks, but heavy food makes me sleepy. 
A brisk set of jumping jacks should do the 
trick. 



Perhaps now would be a good time for a 
pizza break? 



The First Message 
Computation is sending messages to objects. 



What's this? 
"Ruby" 


It's a String. 


And this? 
"a" 


Another String. This one's only one 
character long. 


And this? 

"3" 


A one-character String, where the one 
character happens to be 3. 


Is "3" the same thing as 31 


No. One's an Integer and one's a String. 


What do you suppose this does? 
"a". next 


It asks for the next string after "a", "b" 
seems like it might be a useful answer. 


And how about this? 
"aaa".next 


"aab'l 



Right. What if you sent the "*" message to 
a string, as is done here: 

"Ruby"* 3 
or here: 

"Ruby".send("*", 3) 



I suppose you'd get "Ruby" three times, 
like this: 

"RubyRubyRuby" 



DRAFT 



DRAFT 



Do you think that every message you can 
send to a String can also be sent to an 
Integer? 



That doesn't seem sensible. There must be 
things you can do to Strings that make no 
sense for Integers. 



How about "upper case yourself'? 


That doesn't seem to make sense for 
Integers. 


What's the result of this? 
"Ruby".upcase 


"RUBY" 


And the result of this? 
3.upcase 


A message about "undefined method 
'upcase'". 



Can you think of a message to an Integer 
that wouldn't make sense for a String? 



How about "Ruby". new J'actoriall That 
shouldn't work, because we defined 
newjactorial for Integers. 



Integer and String are both classes. Judging 
from what you've seen so far, what are 
classes for? 



An object's class determines which 
messages it responds to. 



If you could look at String's definition of 
the method next, do you suppose it would 
look the same as Integer's definition of 
nexfl 



It doesn't seem like it could. They behave 
differently. For example, "z".next is "aa". 
Computing that seems different than 
computing that 9. next is 10. 



So two messages can be the same, but that 
doesn't mean the methods invoked when 
they're sent are. We say that message 
names are polymorphic. 



I see, though fancy words like 
"polymorphic" make me want to jump up 
and run around in tight little circles. 



We won't use the word much, but the idea 
is important. 



I'm afraid that I don't see what the big deal 
is. 



Let's look at a more substantial example. 
What should be the result of executing 
this? 

ascending? {I, 2, 3) 



true, I suppose, since 3 is bigger than 2 and 
2 is bigger than 1. 



Can you write ascending! 



Sure: 



def ascending? {first, second, third) 
first < second && second < third 
end 



chl-ascending.rb 



DRAFT 



DRAFT 



What should be the result of executing 
this? 

ascending ?( "first", "second", "third") 



true as well, "third" comes after "second" 
in the dictionary, and "second" comes after 
"first". 



Will the ascending? you wrote work for 
Strings? 



Yes, because it's not dependent on the 
classes of its arguments. 



first < second means "send the < message 
to first, passing second as an argument". If 
first is an Integer, < means what it 
normally means for numbers. But if it's a 
String, a completely different method is 
used, one that compares strings in 
dictionary order. 



Can you be more specific? 



Have we seen something useful? 



It's nice that I can write one method that 
works for two classes. Without 
polymorphism, I'd have to decide whether 
I wanted to go to the trouble of writing an 
ascending? for Strings. 



You've seen two classes: Integer and 
String. You'll soon see how to create your 
own classes. When you create your first 
one, will ascending? work with it? 



Yes, provided it defines the method <. 
Shall we do that? I'm eager. 



In a moment. I'm feeling a bit peckish right 
now. 



Have a celery stick. 



The Second Message 
Message names describe the desired result, independently of the object that provides it. 



What's this? 



It's a String containing no characters. 



And this? 



A String containing one character. 



And this? 



A String containing two characters. 



DRAFT 



DRAFT 



How can a String represent an Integer? 



A String with n characters represents the 
Integer n. 



Let's make a class that represents Integers 
that way. What would be a good name? 



How about FunnyNumber? 



OK. How would we begin to define 
FunnyNumber? 



class FunnyNumber 
end 



Suppose I want to create a new 
FunnyNumber that represents the number 
3. How should I do that? 



There are three key words in your sentence: 
"FunnyNumber", "new", and "3". But I'm 
not sure how to put them together. 



What is all computation? 



"All computation is sending messages to 
objects, possibly including other objects as 
arguments." 

Just as I can send the "*" message to the 
Integer 3, asking it to multiply itself by 2, 
perhaps I can send the "new" message to 
the class FunnyNumber, asking it to give 
me a new FunnyNumber that represents 3. 



What would that look like? 



FunnyNumber.new(3) 



Exactly. 



There's something odd here, something 
tantalizing, something invigorating, 
something that makes me feel able to bench 
press 150 kilos! 



And what's that? 



Let me see if I can express it. Up to now, I 
thought there were two things: objects, and 
their classes. You sent messages to objects; 
the object's class determined what methods 
were invoked. 



But now, it seems that classes are somehow 
themselves objects that can be sent 
messages, like new. For no reason I can 
articulate, that just seems incredibly 
powerful. 



DRAFT 



DRAFT 



It is indeed. Classes as objects are the 
computational equivalent of performance 
enhancing drugs. They give you the 
intellectual leverage to perform great feats 
of mental strength. 



I'm ready! Load up the conceptual barbell! 



However, as with physical weights, it's best 
to build up gradually to the desired goal. 



Rats. By the way, to be consistent, you 
should from now on use the same font for 
class names as you do for other objects. 



You're right. Once we have a 
FunnyNumber class, what would this code 
do? " 

FunnyNumber. new(3). inspect 



It would create a new FunnyNumber, then 
send it the inspect message. I suppose that 
puts the FunnyNumber into some pleasant 
format. 



Such as "Funny 3 (nnn)", perhaps? 



OK. The "nnn " is the representation and 3 
is the Integer represented (because "nnn " 
has length 3). 



inspect answers a String. To help you 
define it, let me tell you some of how string 
formatting works in Ruby. Suppose s has 
the value "hi". This String: 

"s. length = #{s. length}" 

turns into "s. length = 2". (Still more 
syntactic sugar.) Anything inside #{} is 
computed, and its value is substituted into 
the String that contains it. 



inspect would look something like this: 

class FunnyNumber 

def inspect 
"Funny #{???. length} (#{???})" 

end 
end 

I'm not sure what the ??? is, though, except 
that it's a String. For FunnyNumber. new(3), 
it's the String "nnn ". 



Could it be self! 



I don't think so. self Is the FunnyNumber 
itself. I'm looking for something that's the 
String that FunnyNumber uses to represent 
Integers. 



DRAFT 



10 



DRAFT 



Let's just call it @rep, short for 
"representation". @rep will be given a 
value when the FunnyNumber is created 
(via FunnyNumber.new) . 



So here's inspect: 

class FunnyNumber 

def inspect 
'Funny #{@rep. length] (#{@repj)" 

end 
end 



To be able to use inspect, you need a method defined 
below. You can read on before trying inspect, or you can 
load chl-funnynumber.rb now. 



Correct. 



The @ in @rep must mean something. The 
argument n to factorial didn't have an @ 
sign in front of it. 



It means that @rep is an instance variable. 

When an object is created with new, it's 
called an instance of its class. The instance 
variables are shared by all of that object's 
methods. 



So any method that I write for 
FunnyNumber can use @rep when it needs 
to use the representation. 



Yes. Where does @ rep's initial value come It must be first created as a result of the call 
from? to new: 

FunnyNumber. new{3 ) 



FunnyNumber.new creates a FunnyNumber 
instance, new takes the argument 3, which 
should be used to initialize @rep with the 
representation for 3 (which is "nnn"). 



You're implying that one object (the class 
FunnyNumber) should reach into another 
(the instance it creates) and set its instance 
variable. 



Would that be a problem? 



Perhaps not, but it would be annoyingly 
inconsistent. Before, we concluded that all 
computation is sending messages to 
objects, asking them to do something. 
Here, the FunnyNumber class isn't asking, 
it's ripping open the instance and messing 
with its guts. 



Put so graphically, that does sound 
unappealing. Perhaps the FunnyNumber 
class, having created the instance, should 
send it a message called initialize. 



So new would look something like this: 

def new(an_integer) 
instance = ??? instance creation magic 
instance. initialize(an_integer) 

instance 
end 



DRAFT 



11 



DRAFT 



What does the instance alone on a line 
mean? 



It means that the value of the whole 
method is the newly-created instance. 
That's what new answers. 



That's what new should look like. You 
don't have to write new, though, because 
it's provided automatically by Ruby. 



I do have to write initialize. 



It would look like this: 

class FunnyNumber 

def initialize(from_integer) 
??? 

end 
end 

What should ??? be? 



How about this? 

def initialize(from_integer) 

@rep = "n" * from_integer 
end 

That works because this: 

"n"*3 
computes this: 



chl-funnynumber.rb 



So, can you describe what this does? 
FunnyNumber. new(3). inspect 



new is a method of the FunnyNumber class. 
It creates a new instance, then calls that 
instance's initialize method, passing the 
value 3. 

initialize sets @rep, then returns to new. 
new answers (or returns) the newly-created 
object. 

That object is sent the inspect message, 
which answers this string: 

'Funny 3 (nnn) " 

Whew! That's quite a workout! 



DRAFT 



12 



DRAFT 



You know everything you need to create 
new classes. Can you add < to 
FunnyNumber? 



The skeleton would look like this: 

class FunnyNumber 

def <( other) 
??? 

end 
end 



I can think of several ways to fill in the 

999\ 

■ ■ ■ i3* 



What's one way that would not work? 



@argv. length < other. @argv. length 



Why not? 



The object getting the < message (self) 
can't reach into the argument (other) and 
peek at its instance variables. 



You could make the instance variable 
available via a method: 

class FunnyNumber 
def rep 
@rep 
end 

def <( other) 

self. rep < other. rep 
end 
end 



But then anyone who wanted to could look 
at the internal representation. 

As a person, I'm fond of my heart (which 
has a resting pulse rate of 52 beats per 
minute, by the way), but I don't wear it on 
my sleeve. Objects should be similarly 
restrained. 



How about this? 



class FunnyNumber 
def length 

@ rep. length 
end 

def <( other) 

self. length < other. length 
end 
end 



That's a little more modest, but what does 
the concept "length" have to do with any 
kind of "number"? Why should it make 
any more sense to say this: 

FunnyNumber. new(3). length 
than this: 

3. length! 

If I'm going to calculate something from 
@rep, I should calculate something useful. 



DRAFT 



13 



DRAFT 



How about this? 



class FunnyNumber 
def as_integer 
@ rep. length 
end 

def <( other) 

self. as integer < other. as integer 
end 
end 



Yes, it seems generally useful to convert 
FunnyNumbers to Integers. 

It's interesting that the name is all that 
changed - it's still length underneath. But if 
I ever decide to use a different 
representation - something other than a 
String - 1 will always be able to make 
asjnteger work. I might not be able to 
make length work. 



chl-ascending-funnynumber.rb 



Hiding representations behind general- 
purpose interfaces is good object-oriented 
design. 

Can you now use our old friend ascending"] 



This is true: 

ascending ?(FunnyNumber.new(l ), 
FunnyNumber. new(2), 
FunnyNumber.new(3 )) 

Shall we move to a stair-climbing exercise 
machine, then make our heartbeats 
"greater" by "ascending" its stairs? (Ho, 
ho!) 



I'm going to have a pastry. 



See you in the next chapter, then. 



The Third Message 
Classes provide interface and hide representation.
