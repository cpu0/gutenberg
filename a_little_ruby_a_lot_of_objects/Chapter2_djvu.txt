A Little Ruby, A Lot of Objects 
Chapter 2: ...We Get It From Others 



Exercise has left a fine sheen of sweat on I am. 
your brow. Are you ready to descend from 
the stair-climbing machine? 



Perhaps you should write a method called 
descending ?. 



I want descending? {3, 2, 1) to be true: 

def descending ?(first, second, third) 
first > second && second > third 
end 



ch2-directions.rb 



What kinds of classes wiU descending? 
work with? 



Any class that defines >. 



Can you write a method never_descendingl def never_descending?(first, second, third) 
It allows one of the arguments to be equal first <= second && second <= third 

to the next argument, but not greater. end 



never_descending?(l, 1, 2) is true 
never_descending?(l, 2, 3) is true 
never_descending?(2, 3, 2) is false 



ch2-directions.rb, again 



What kinds of classes wiU 
never_descending? work with? 



Any class that defines <= 



I notice that the sweat on your brow has 
been joined by a perplexed look. 



I'm thinking about how to tell someone else 
about this suite of methods I'm writing: 

"ascending? works with any class that 
defines <, descending? works with any 
class that defines >, never_descending? 
works with any class that defines <=..." 

and so on and on and on for all the methods 
in the suite.

Those are true statements. 



Yes, but who wants to hear all that? What I 
want to say is more like: 

"You know the normal comparison 
methods like <? This suite works with 
any class that implements those." 



Or, alternately, "This suite works when the 
arguments implement the Comparable 
protocol." 



I take it that "implements a protocol" is 
shorthand for "responds to the set of 
messages named wherever it is that the 
protocol is defined". 



Yes. 



Our class FunnyNumber doesn't implement 
the Comparable protocol because it only 
implements <. For a class to be 
Comparable, surely it should also 
implement >. 



And so what would happen if you changed 
the definition of ascending? from this: 

def ascending ?(first, second, third) 
first < second && second < third 
end 



to this: 



def ascending ?(first, second, third) 
third > second && second > first 
end 



ascending? would stop working with 
FunnyNumber. But it would continue to 
work with Integers and Strings because 
they implement Comparable. 

I can see another advantage to protocols. 
Once I added < to FunnyNumber, I was 
starting down a path - the path to a class 
whose objects can be compared in a widely 
accepted way. The Comparable protocol 
reminds me of everything I need to do to 
satisfy people's expectations of my code. 



Would you like to satisfy those 
expectations now? You'll need to define <, 
<=, ==, >=, >, and a method called 
between?. 



Heck, no. It would be easy enough to do 
(once you tell me what between? does). For 
example, I can define > like this: 

class FunnyNumber 
def > (other) 

self.as_integer > other.as_integer 
end 
end 

But the thought of writing all those trivial 
methods... well, it doesn't fill me with any 
great excitement. 



DRAFT 



DRAFT 



Would you be willing to write a single 
method? It would compare self to another 
object, returning -1 if self is less than the 
other, if it has the same value, and +1 if 
the other is larger. 



Maybe. Is such a method defined for 
Integerl 



Yes. Its name is <=> (sometimes called 
"the spaceship operator"). 



class FunnyNumber 
def <=>(other) 

selfasjnteger <- 
end 
end 



> other.as_integer 



What have I gained? 



Can you write comparison methods in 
terms of <=>? 



Sure. For example: 

class FunnyNumber 
def >( other) 

(self < = > other) 
end 
end 

What have I gained? 



If you can do it, so can someone else. And 
someone else did. They put the 
Comparable protocol methods in a module 
called Comparable. Just as ascending? 
works with any class that responds to <, the 
Comparable module works with any class 
that responds to <=>. 



Show me. 



Here's all that FunnyNumber needs to do to 
implement the Comparable protocol: 

class FunnyNumber 
include Comparable 

def < = > (other) 

self.as_integer < = > other.as_integer 
end 
end 



So does this Une: 

include Comparable 

have the same effect as these? 



def >( other) 

(self < = > other) = 
end 
def <( other) 

(self < = > other) = 
end 



= 1 



ch2-comparable-funnynumber.rb

Almost. There are some differences that 
we'll learn about later. 



Does it have something to do with a 
module being an object, just like a class is 
an object? 



Indeed it does. Modules and classes are 
very closely related. 

Would you have to include Comparable in 
order to say that FunnyNumber implements 
the Comparable protocol? 



I suppose if I wanted the extra work, I 
could implement <, >, and all the other 
Comparable methods myself. 



Implementing a protocol is a matter of 
which messages a class responds to. 
Including a module is just a convenient 
way of implementing a protocol. 



So the most important thing about a 
protocol is that it's an agreement among 
programmers. It's a way for me to teU my 
friends what kind of thing my class is. 



Would you like to learn another way to add 
a protocol and the methods that implement 
it to your class? 



Yes. But probably you should first interrupt 
the conversation with one of your 
messages. 



The Fourth Message 
Protocols group messages into coherent sets. 

If two different classes implement the same protocol, programs that depend only on 
that protocol can use them interchangeably. 



Suppose we want FunnyNumber to 



I'm getting tired of FunnyNumber. Can we 
have something that has more to do with 
the real world? 



Okay. What's the realest part of the real 
world? 



Exercise. 



As you wish. After you finished exercising, 
I noticed you writing something down in a 
notebook. What was it? 



I record the results of exercising: the 
number of calories consumed and so forth. 



Let's begin, then, by creating a class that 
models the simplest exercise machine you 
use. What would that be? 



Probably the rowing machine. 



DRAFT 



DRAFT 



So we want a class that represents a single 
session on a particular rowing machine. 



class RowingSession 
end 



How would you identify a session? 



By the name of the rowing machine and the 
amount of time spent on it. 

class RowingSession 
def initialize(name, time) 
@name = name 
@time = time 
end 
end 



What have you done here? 



I've written the initialize method that will 
be called by something Uke: 

RowingSession.new("buffy", 30) 

It assigns the given name and time to 
instance variables. 



"Buffy the rowing machine"? 



Look, I don't pick the names, I just use the 
machines. 



How would you print a report on the 
calories consumed? 

(You'll want to use Ruby's print method. It 
prints a string to the output. If the string 
ends with \n, print arranges for the next 
print to start on a new Une.) 



I'd add this method within class 
RowingSession: 

class RowingSession 
def report 
print "#{@time} minutes on #{@name} = " 
print "#(caloriesj calories.\n" 
end 
end 



Why did you use two print statements to 
print a single line? 



A one-line print statement would be 
marvelous, but this margin isn't large 
enough to contain it. 



DRAFT 



DRAFT 



What is calories'? 



It's a method that will compute the number 
of calories burned from the @time spent 
exercising. I'll also define it within 
RowingSession: 

class RowingSession 

def calories 
@time * 6 

end 
end 



So how can we use your new class? 



session = RowingSession.new("buffy", 30) 
session, report 

ch2-rowingsession.rb 



And the result is this output: 

30 minutes on buffy = 180 calories. 

What's a more complicated exercise 
machine? 



A stair climber. It's computer-controUed, so 
you can pick more than one type of 
workout. I use two programs: a steady 
cUmb, and one that simulates running hard 
up a steep hiU. 

The number of calories you burn also 
depends on your weight, since you're 
expending energy lifting yourself. 



So you need a new class. 



class Climbing Session 
def initialize(name, time, program, 
weight) 
@name = name 
@time = time 
@program = program 
@ weight = weight 
end 
end 



Suppose you'd also written the calories 
method. Could you then use the report 
method you wrote for RowingSessionl 



report is a message you can send to objects 
of class RowingSession. Objects of class 
ClimbingSession wouldn't know anything 
about it. But I wish I could use it. The code 
for a ClimbingSession report would be 
identical to RowingSession'^ version. 



DRAFT 



DRAFT 



Could you use a module to provide reportl 



I could, I suppose. Just as module 
Comparable provides a function < to any 
class that includes it and defines <=>, I 
could write a module CaloryReporter that 
provides report to any class that includes it 
and defines @time, @name, and calories. 



But, fi-ankly, the connection between the 
two Session classes seems tighter than the 
connection between Comparable and 
FunnyNumber. 



It does, doesn't it? For a clue as to the 
connection, notice the shorthand you used: 
"the two Session classes". 



When the difl'erences between a 
ClimbingSession and a RowingSession 
didn't matter, I abbreviated to Session. In a 
sense, I was referring to an imaginary class 
that captured what was common between 
the two kinds of sessions. 



Is method report an example of what you 
want to be common between the two kinds 
of sessions? 



Yes... I want to move report into a more 
"generic" class, because you can report on 
calories burned for any kind of Session. 



class Session 
def report 
print "#{@time} minutes on #{@name} = 
print "#{calories} calories.\n" 
end 
end 



If you're trying these examples out in IRB, exit and restart 
it before defining tlie above class. 



Let's draw a picture of the three classes and 
where the methods wiU live. 



Session 
report 




RowingSession 
initialize 
calories 



ClimbingSession 
initialize 
calories 



DRAFT 



DRAFT 



Now you need a way to say that a 
RowingSession is a kind of Session. 



How about this notation? 

class RowingSession < Session 
def initialize(name, time) 

@name = name 

@time = time 
end 



def calories 
@time * 3 
end 
end 



ch2-rowmgsession-as-subclass.rb. If you get a warning 
message, that means you forgot to exit IRB and restart it. 



What does that mean? 



A RowingSession is a kind of Session. 
Methods specific to RowingSessions live in 
the RowingSession class; methods that 
apply to all Sessions live in the Session 
class. 



Object-oriented people say that 
RowingSession is a subclass of Session and 
(conversely) Session is a superclass of 
RowingSession. 



It creates a RowingSession object. The 
arguments to new are given to the initialize 
method defined in RowingSession. 



What is the result of this? 

row_sess = RowingSession.new("buffy" , 30) 



What is the result of this? 
row_sess. report 



The RowingSession object is sent the 
report message. RowingSession doesn't 
define a report method. But, since 
RowingSession is a subclass of Session, 
Ruby looks for report there. It finds it and 
uses it. 



More specifically, the result is just as 
before: 

30 minutes on buffy = 180 calories. 



DRAFT 



DRAFT 



We say that RowingSession inherits report class Climbing Session < Session 



from Session. 

What would ClimbingSession look Uke? 
(Don't bother completing calories yet.) 



def initialize(name, time, program, 
weight) 

@name = name 

@time = time 

@program = program 

@ weight = weight 
end 



def calories 

end 
end 



Notice anything about the two versions of 
initialize! (RowingSession's and 
ClimbingSession's) 



They have two lines in common: 
@name = name 
@time = time 



Because all Sessions will involve a named 
machine and a time spent on it, I wish I 
could move those lines into the Session 
class. 



Can you do that for RowingSessionl 



AU I need to do is move the definition of 
initialize from RowingSession to Session: 



class Session 
def initialize(name, time) 
@name = name 
@time = time 
end 
end 



chl-rowingsession-initialize.rb 



What does our picture look like now? 



Session 
initialize 

report 




RowingSession 
calories 



ClimbingSession 
initialize 
calories 



DRAFT 



DRAFT 



What will happen as a result of this call? 
RowingSession.new("buffy", 30) 



The method new for the class 
RowingSession will create a RowingSession 
object. Then it will send an initialize 
message to that object. Since 
RowingSession has no initialize method, 
Ruby looks in its superclass, Session. It 
finds it there, so it invokes it. 



What about this call, keeping in mind that 
ClimbingSession's initialize hasn't moved? 
ClimbingSession. new( "biff, 23, 

"hill run ", 
84) 

You can't run this because ClimbingSession's calories 
hasn't been defined yet. 



The method new for the class 
ClimbingSession will create a 
ClimbingSession object. Then it will send 
an initialize message to that object. Since 
ClimbingSession defines initialize, that one 
gets invoked. The one in Session is 
ignored. 



Can you move the duplicate code from 
ClimbingSession to Session? 



I'm not sure how. Only two of the lines 
within ClimbingSession's initialize method 
can be moved. The other two lines have to 
stay, because they set instance variables 
unique to ClimbingSessions: 

class ClimbingSession 
def initialize(name, time, program, 
weight) 

@ name = name # can move 

@ time = time # can move 

@program = program # must stay 

@ weight = weight # must stay 
end 
end 



What's the problem? 



There must be an initialize method in 
ClimbingSession to initialize @program 
and @ weight. Ruby wiU caU that method 
when it sees 

ClimbingSession. new(. . . ) 
But how, then, wiU Session's initialize 
method be called? 



DRAFT 



10 



DRAFT 



Can you show me what you need in the 
form of code? 



I need to know what goes in the ??? slot. 

class Session 
def initialize(name, time) 
@name = name 
@time = time 
end 
end 

class ClimbingSession < Session 
def initialize(name, time, program, 
weight) 

999 

@program = program 
@ weight = weight 
end 
end 

It's something that calls the method of the 
same name in the superclass. 



Call that mechanism super. 



class ClimbingSession < Session 
def initialize(name, time, program, 
weight) 
super(name, time) 

@program = program 
@ weight = weight 
end 
end 



ch2-both-sessions.rb. Exit and reenter IRB before loading 
it. 



Please explain how initialization happens 
in this case: 

ClimbingSession.new( "biff, 23, 

"hill run ", 
84) 



The new method on class ClimbingSession 
creates a new object. It sends the initialize 
message to that object, which invokes the 
initialize method from ClimbingSession. 
The first thing that method does is invoke 
the initialize method in the superclass 
Session. After that version of initialize 
initializes @name and @time, the original 
initialize resumes and initializes @program 
and @ weight.

Whew! Maybe a picture of the structure, 
including instance variables, would help. 



Session 
@name 
©time 
initialize 
report 




RowingSession 
calories 



ClimbingSession 

©program 

©weight 

initialize

You've drawn the inheritance hierarchy 

of these classes. RowingSession and 
ClimbingSession inherit two instance 
variables from Session. RowingSession 
inherits two methods. ClimbingSession 
inherits only one {report), because it 
shadows the other {initialize). 



This moving of code from place to place - 
creating superclasses and subclasses as I 
discover commonality - is exhilarating. 
But I'm not ashamed to say it also makes 
me a bit nervous. I'm making the code 
more pleasing, but what if I break 
something that used to work? 



The technique is called "refactoring". The 
book to read is Martin Fowler's 
Refactoring: Improving the Design of 
Existing Code. 



I think m take a break, run off and buy it. 



How about a little summary of inheritance 
first? 



A superclass like Session defines protocol 
for its subclasses. Any class that inherits 
from Session responds to the message 
report. It must implement calories for 
report to work, so calories is also part of 
the protocol. 



In this way, inheritance is like including a 
module. 



Right. It seems, though, that a module 
provides implementation (method 
definitions) for aU the messages in its 
protocol. A class may leave some or all of 
the implementation to the subclasses. For 
example. Session leaves calories to the 
subclasses.

The Fifth Message 
Classes define protocols for their subclasses. 



Shall we play class badminton? It will help 
clarify how inheritance works. 



Many people of my culture and with my 
muscle mass would scorn badminton. But 
I, being cosmopolitan as well as muscular, 
realize it is a game of agility, wit, and 
reflex. So I'm ready. 



Here are the rules. In real badminton, two 
players hit a "shuttlecock" back and forth 
with rackets. We'U suppose we have two 
classes. Super and Sub, instead of rackets. 
A class "has the shuttlecock" when a 
method defined in it is executing. It hits the 
shuttlecock to the other class by causing 
one of that class's methods to execute. 



Oh. Mental agility and wit, not physical. 
WeU, I can do that too. 

Serve me up a problem. 



Sure. 



This: 



class Super 
def refined 
end 

def unique 
end 
end 



class Sub < Super 
def refined 
super 
unique 
end 
end 



class Super 
def^ 
en 




class Sub < Super^ 
def ret 
er 
ique 



Given Sub.new.refined, what happens? 

(If no initialize method is defined, aU that 
new does is create the object.) 

ch2-badmintonl .rb 



Sub gets it first, hits it to Super (via super), 
who returns it (by returning from refined). 
Sub hits it right back by explicitly calling 
unique. Super returns it, and Sub doesn't hit 
it back. Point for Super.

How about this one? 

class Super 
def inherited 
bounce 
slam 
end 

def bounce 
end 
end 



class Sub < Super 

def slam 

end 
end 



class Super 
def inherited 




class Sub < Super 
am 



What happens with Sub.new.inheritedl 



An exciting volley! Because Sub doesn't 
define inherited. Super gets the shuttlecock 
first. It calls bounce - in eflfect bouncing 
the shuttlecock up in the air on Super's side 
of the net. When the shuttlecock comes 
down {bounce returns), Super slams it over 
the net at great speed, expecting Sub to be 
helpless. But Sub is ready and returns the 
volley. Super, unprepared for the skillful 
return, drops the shuttlecock (by returning 
from inherited). 

I don't think bouncing the shuttlecock is 
legal badminton, though. 



ch2-badminton2.rb

DRAFT 



How about this minor addition? 



class Super 
def inherited 

bounce 

slam

def bounce 
end 
end 



class Sub < Super 

def bounce 
end 



def slam 
end 
end 



class Super 
def iiikefiied 
bo. 



def bounce 
end 
end 



class Sub < Super 
def bounce 




What happens with Sub.new.inherited this 
time? 

Note that Sub.new answers a Sub object. 
For a Sub object, Ruby will always begin 
looking for methods in the Sub class. 



ch2-badminton3 .rb 



Sub triumphs again! As before, Super tried 
to bounce the shuttlecock on its side of the 
net. This time, though. Sub had a bounce of 
its own. Because Ruby will look for 
methods starting at Sub, Sub's bounce 
method was called - converting Super's 
illegal move into a hit over the net. Super - 
disconcerted - handled Sub's return from 
bounce and tried to slam it back. Sub 
returned the slam, and Super dropped it. 
Stellar! 



Sub seems to dominate Super. 



Generally, I find the right side in any 
sparring, verbal or physical, fares better. 



Quite. Let's suppose the classes are as 
above, but the game begins differently: 
Super. new. inherited 



Since the object created is a Super, Ruby 
will always start looking for methods there. 
Sub is irrelevant. That leads to this: 



class Super / 


class Sub < S 


def inherited 




Arowice 


def bounce 


(\stcmiO 


end 


end 




\ def bounce 


def slam 


\nd 


end 


end 


end 



There is no slam method in Super, so 
execution must fail. 



DRAFT 



15 



DRAFT 



Super is what is called an abstract class. 

Abstract classes define protocols. They 
also provide method implementations and 
instance variables to the concrete classes 
that inherit fi'om them. But they aren't 
intended to be instantiated (made into 
instances, created as objects using new). 



A programmer creating an abstract class 
should make sure his fi^iends know what 
methods their subclasses should 
implement. 

And I suppose that suggestive names, like 
AbstractSession, would help avoid 
mistakes. 



Naming is an important issue. Kent Beck's 
Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns is the 
book to read. 



Smalltalk is a difl'erent language than 
Ruby? 



Yes, but it is also a "pure" object-oriented 
language. Most everything you'll see in this 
book can also be done in Smalltalk. 



I'll look it up. 



The Sixth Message 

If a class and its superclass have methods with the same name, 

the class's methods take precedence. 



We should explore how instance variables 
work with inheritance. Here's an example: 



I see two classes. Both of them change 
variables named @val. But is the @val in 
Super the same as the @val in Subl 



class Super 


class Sub < Super 


def super_set(val) 


def sub_set(val) 


@val = val 


@val = val 


end 


end 


def super _get 


defsub_get 


@val 


@val 


end 


end 


end 


end 


ch2-badminton4.rb 




Let's see. What is the efl'ect of this? 


s = Sub. new 




s.super_set(5) 




s. super _get 




s.sub_get 





Both super_get and sub_get answer 5. 



DRAFT 



16 



DRAFT 



And how about this? 

s.sub_set( "dawn ") 
s. super _get 
s.sub_get 



Both super_get and sub_get answer 
"dawn ". 



How do instance variables work with 
inheritance? 



When superclasses and subclasses use the 
same variable name, they mean the same 
variable. Variables are not shadowed the 
way that methods are. 



Let's explore why that happens. Please 
draw Super and Sub. 



Here: 



Super 
super_set 
super_get 



Sub 
sub_set 
sub_get 



I'm not sure where to put @val. It should 
only go in one place because either class 
can change it. 



Suppose you execute this code: 
si = Sub. new 
sl.sub_set(l) 
s2 = Sub. new 
s2.sub_set(2) 

Do the two objects have the same value of 
@va/? 



No. Each instance has a different value. 
That suggests that an instance should have 
a separate box, containing its unique 
instance variables: 



Super 
super_set 
super_get 



Sub 
sub_set 
sub_get 



creates 




Yes. I earlier had you put instance variables 
together with methods in one box. That 
was an oversimplification. 



But does this explain why Super and Sub 
share the instance variable? 



DRAFT 



17 



DRAFT 



Remember that self is always the receiver 
of a message. 


So, given sl.sub_set( 
the picture: 


ere; 


self is sl. Here's

So...? 



It's not really that Super shares Sub's 
variable or vice-versa. It's that they both 
refer to the same variable, stored in self. 



The Seventh Message 
Instance variables are always found in self.
