x-archive-meta-description: Current NASA flight rules limit the maximum cabin temperature (23.9 C) during re-entry and landing to protect crewmembers from heat stress while wearing the Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES) and Liquid Cooling Garment (LCG). The primary purpose of this ground-based project was to determine whether the LCG could provide adequate cooling if ambient temperature reached 26.7 ''C. The secondary objective was to determine whether there would be a graded effect of ambient temperature profiles with maximum temperatures of 23.9 (LO), 26.7 (MPD), and 29.4 C (HI). METHODS: Eight subjects underwent a 5-h temperature profile (22.8,26.7 C) in an environmental chamber while wearing the ACES and LCG. Subjects controlled the amount of cooling provided by the LCG. Core (T(sub core)),skin temperatures (T(sub sk)) and heart rate (HR) were measured every 15-min. A 10-minute stand test was administered pre- and post-chamber. Additionally, 4 subjects underwent the three 5-h temperature profiles (LO, MID, and HI) with the same measurements. RESULTS: In the 8 subjects completing the MID profile, T(sub core), and T(sub sk) decreased from the start' to the end of the chamber stay. Subjects completed the stand test without signs of orthostatic intolerance. In the 4 subjects who underwent all 3 profiles, there was no discernible pattern in T(sub core), T(sub sk), and HR responses across the temperature profiles. CONCLUSIONS: In the range of temperatures tested, subjects were able to sufficiently utilize the self-selected cooling to avoid any potential deleterious effects of wearing the ACES. However, these subjects were not microgravity exposed, which has been suggested to impair thermoregulation.
