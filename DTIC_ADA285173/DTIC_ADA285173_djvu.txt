INTRODUCTION 


The Ada implementation described above was tested according to the Ada 
Validation Procedures [Pro92] against the Ada Standard [Ada83J using the 
current Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC). This Validation Summary 
Report (VSR) gives am account of the testing of this Ada implementation. For 
any technical terms used in this report, the reader is referred to (Pro92). 
A detailed description of the ACVC may be found in the current ACVC User's 
Guide [UG89].

1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: A, 
B, C, D, e, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class to 
which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B and 
class L tests are expected to produce errors at compile time and link time, 
respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result when they are 
executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, and the 
procedure CHECK_FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT also 
provides a set of identity functions used to defeat some compiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. ahe package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of text 
files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class B 
tests are not executable. Each test in this class is .compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects violation of 
the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately compiled units. Errors are 
expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values — for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in Appendix A. in 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and 
implementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this inqplementation are described in section 2.3.

INTRODUCTION 


For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by the AVF. 
This customization consists of making the modifications described in the 
preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see section 2.1), and possibly 
removing some inapplicable tests (see section 2.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each test of the 
customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

INAPPLICABLE TESTS 


A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are irrelevant 
for a given Ada implementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may be 
supported by documents issued by the ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and commonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Commentaries are included as 
appropriate. 


2-1 




IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


The following 201 tests have floating-point type declarations requiring 
more digits than SYSTEM.MAX_DIGITS: 


C241'3L..Y (14 tests) 
C35706L..Y (14 tests) 
C35708L..Y (14 tests) 
C45241L..Y (14 tests)

C45521L..Z (15 tests) 
C45621L..Z (15 tests) 
C46012L..Z (15 tests) 


The following 20 tests check for the predefined type LCNG_INTEGER; for 
this implementation, there is no such type: 


C35404C C45231C 
C45502C C45503C 
C45613C C45614C 
C55B07A B55B09C

C45412C 

C45611C 

B52004D 

CD7101F 


C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with a 
name other than FLOAT, LCNGFLQAT, or SHORTFLOAT; for this 
implementation, there is no such type. 


A35801E checks that FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST may be used as a range 
constraint in a floating-point type declaration; for this 
implementation, that range exceeds the range of safe numbers of the 
largest predefined floating-point type and must be rejected. (See 
section 2.3.) 


C45531M..P and C45532M..P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations for 
types that require a SYSTEM.MAXJMANTISSA of 47 or greater; for this 
implementation, MAX_MANTISSA is less than 47. 

C45624A..B (2 tests) check that the proper exception is raised if 
MACHINE_OVERFLCWS is FALSE for floating point types and the results of 
various floating-point operations lie outside the range of the base 
type; for this implementation, MACHINE_CWERFLOWS is TRUE. 

B86001Y uses the name of a predefined fixed-point type other than type 
DURATION; for this implementation, there is no such type. 

C96005B uses values of type DURATION'S base type that are outside the 
range of type DURATION; for this implementation, the ranges are the 
same. 


CD1009C checks whether a length clause can specify a non-default size 
for a floating-point type; this implementation does not support such 
sizes. 

CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use length clauses 
to specify non-default sizes for access types; this implementation does 
not support such sizes.

CE3304A checks that SET_LINEJUENGTH and SET PAGE_LENGTtf raise USE_ERROR 
if they specify an inappropriate value for the external file; there are 
no inappropriate values for this implementation. 

CE3413B checks that PAGE raises LAYOUTJEFROR when the value of the page 
number exceeds COUNT'LAST; for this implementation, the value of 
COUNT'LAST is greater than 150000, making the checking of this objective 
impractical.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 22 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
implementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the way 
expected by the original tests. 

B24009A B33301B B38003A B38003B B38009A B38009B 
B85008G B85008H BC1303F BC3005B BD2B03A BD2D03A 
BD4003A 

A35301E was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by the 
AVO. The compiler rejects the use of the range FLOAT'FIRST. .FLOAT'LAST as 
the range constraint of a floating-point type declaration because the bounds 
lie outside of the range of safe numbers (cf. LRM 3.5.7:12). 

CD1009A, CD1009I, CD1C03A, CD2A22J, and CD2A31A..C were graded passed by 
Evaluation Modification as directed by the AVO. These tests use 
instantiations of the support procedure LH4GTH_CHECK, which uses 
Unchecked Conversion according to the interpretation given in AI-00590. The 
AVO ruled that this interpretation is not binding under ACVC 1.11; the tests 
are ruled to be passed if they produce Failed messages only from the 
instances of LENGTH_CHECK—i.e, the allowed Report.Failed messages have the 
general form: 

" * CHECK ON REPRESENTATION FOR <TYPE_ID> FAILED." 

AD9001B was graded passed by Test Modification as directed by the AVO. This 
test checks that no bodies are required for interfaced subprograms; among the 
procedures that it uses is one with a parameter cf mode OUT (line 36). This 
implemenation does not support pragma INTERFACE for procedures with 
parameters of mode OUT. The test was modified by commenting out line 36 and 
40; the modified test was passed.

PROCESSING INFORMATION 


3.1 TESTING ENVIRONMENT 


The Ada implementation tested in this validation effort is described 
adequately by the information given in the initial pages of this report. 

For technical and sales information about this Ada implementation, contact: 

Sam Quiring 

Rational Software Corporation 
1600 NW Compton Dr., Suite 357 
Aloha, OR 97006-1992 
(503) 690-1116 


Testing of this Ada implementation was conducted at the customer's site by a 
validation team from the AVF. 


3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming Language 
Standard, whether the test is applicable or inapplicable; otherwise, the Ada 
Implementation fails the ACVC [Pro92). ' 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was obtained 
that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard. 

The list of items below gives the number of ACVC tests in various categories. 
All tests were processed, except those that were withdrawn because of test 
errors (item b; see section 2.1), those that require a floating-point 
precision that exceeds the implementation's maximum precision (item e; see 
section 2.2), and those that depend on the support of a file system — if 
none is supported (item d). All tests passed, except those that are listed 
in sections 2.1 and 2.2 (counted in items b and f, below).

3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were loaded onto a Sun SPARCcenter 2000 and then copied to the 
host computer system. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host computer, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 

The tests were compiled, linked and executed on the host computer system. 
The results were captured on the host computer system. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the c stomer and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a complete listing of 
the processing options for this implementation. It also indicates the 
default options. The options invoked explicitly for validation testing 
during this test were:

MACRO PARAMETERS 


This appendix contains the macro parameters used for customizing the ACVC. 
The meaning and purpose of these parameters are explained in [UG89]. The 
parameter values are presented in two tables. The first table lists the 
values that are defined in terms of the maximum input-line length, which is 
the value for $MAX_IN_LEN—also listed here. These values are expressed here 
as Ada string aggregates, where "V" represents the maximum input-line length.

APPENDIX B 


COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


The compiler options of this Ada implementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer, unless specifically noted otherwise, 
references in this appendix are to compiler documentation and not to this 
report. 


B-l 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


ada Command Reference ada 

ada - invoke the Ada compiler 
Syntax ' 

ada [options) [source_file)... [object_file.ol... 

Arguments 

object_file.o non-Ada object file names. These files will be passed 

on to the linker and will be linked with the specified 
Ada object files. 

options options to the compiler. These are: 

-A (disassemble) Disassemble the units in the source file after 
compiling them. -A can be followed by arguments that further 
define the disassembly display (e.g., -Aa, -Ab, -Ad, -Af, 

-Al, -As). 

a Add hexadecimal display of instruction bytes to 
disassembly listing, 
b Disassemble the unit body [default], 
d Print the data section (if present) as well, 
f Use the alternative format for output. 

1 Put the disassembly output in file "file_name.das" 
s Disassemble the unit spec. 

-a file name 

(archive) Treat file name as an object archive file created 
by ar. Since some archive files end with .a, -a is used to 
distinguish archive files from Ada source files. 

-Bstatic/dynamic (SPARCompiler Ada only) 

(static) If static is indicated, the Ada program is compiled 
and linked statically. The default is dynamic. 

-c suppress the control messages generated when prapma PAGE 
and/or pragma LIST are encountered. 

-D identifier type value 

(define) Define an identifier of a specified type and value. 


-DAl.O 

-DAl.l 

-DA2.0 

(architecture) Specify the architecture version the compiler 
should generate code for. These options override the ARCHITECTURE 
INFO directive [Default: -DAl.l] (HP PA-RISC only) 


-d (dependencies) Analyze for dependencies only. Do not do 


B-2 




COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


semantic analysis or code generation. Update the library, 
marking any defined units as uncompiled. The -d option is 
used by i..make to establish dependencies among new files. 
This option will attempt to do imports for any units 
referenced from outer libraries. This should reduce 
relocation and reduce user disk space usage. 


-E directory 

(error output) Without a directory argument, ada processes 
error messages using a.error and directs a brief message to 
standard output; the raw error messages are left in 
source_file.err. If a directory name is given, the raw error 
output is placed in directory/source_file.err. The file of 
raw error messages can be used as input to a.error. Only 
one -e or -E option should be used. 

~e (error) Process compilation error messages using a.error and 
send it to standard output. Only the source lines containing 
errors are listed. Only one -e or -E option should be used. 

-Eferrorfile source_file 

(error) Process source file and place any error messages 
in the file indicated By error_file. Note that there is 
no space between the -Ef and error_file. 

-El 

-El directory 

(error listing) Same as the -E option, except that a source 
listing with errors is produced. Note that the source listing is 
directed to standard out while the raw errors are placed in 
source_file.err. 

-el (error listing) Intersperse error messages among source 
lines and direct to standard output. 

-Elferror_file source_file 

(error listing) Same as the -Ef option, except that a source 
listing with errors is produced and directed to standard output. 
The raw errors are written to error_file. 

-ev (error vi(l)) Process syntax error messages using a.error, 
embed them in the source file and call the environment editor 
ERROR EDITOR. If ERROR_EDITOR is defined, the environment 
variable ERRORJPATTERN should also be defined. ERFOR_PATTERN 
is an editor search command that locates the first occurrence 
of '###' in the error file. If no editor is specified, vi(l) 
is invoked. 

The value of the environment variable ERRQRJIABS, if set, 
is used instead of the default tab settings (8). 

-F (full DIANA) Do not trim the DIANA tree before output to 
net files. To save disk space, the DIANA tree will be 

B-3 







COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


trimmed so that all pointers to nodes that did not involve 
a subtree that define a symbol table will be nulled 
(unless those nodes are part of the body of an inline or 
generic or certain other values needing to be retained for 
the debugging or compilation information). The trimming 
generally removes initial values of variables and all 
statements. 

-G (GVAS) Display suggested values for the MIN_GVAS_ADDR 
and MAX_GVAS_ADDR INPO directives. 

-K (keep) Keep the intermediate language (IL) file produced 
by the compiler front end. The IL file will be placed in 
the .objects directory with the file name Ada_source. 

-L libraryname 

(library) Operate in VADS library library_name. 

(Default: current working directory] 

-lfile abbreviation (VADSself only) 

(library search) This is an option passed to the ld(l) 
linker, telling it to search the specified library file. 

(No space between the -1 and the file abbreviation.) 

-M unit name 

(main) Produce an executable program by linking the named 
unit as the main program. unit_name must already be 
compiled. It must be either a parameterless procedure or 
a parameterless function returning an integer. The 
executable program will be named a.out unless overridden 
with the -o option. 

-M source file 

(mainT Produce an executable program by compiling and 
linking sourcejEile. The main unit of the program is 
assumed to be the root name of the file (for foo.a the 
unit is foo). Only one file may be preceded by -M. The 
executable program will be named a.out unless overridden 
with the -o option. 

—N (no code sharing) Compile all generic instantiations 
without sharing code for their bodies. This option 
overrides the SHARE_BODY INFO directive and the SHARE_CODE 
or SHAREJBODY pragmas. 

-NX (NX) Link with NX startup code and with the NX archive libraries. 
This option is valid only if the -M option has also been invoked. 

(Sun SPARC ■> Paragon only) 


-0(0-9] 

(optimize) Invoke the code optimizer. An optional digit 
(there is no space before the digit) provides the level of 
optimization. The default is -04. 






COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-O full optimization 
-O0 no optimization 

-01 copy propagation, constant folding, removing 
dead variables, subsuming moves between scalar 
variables 

-02 add comnon subexpression elimination within 
basic blocks 

-03 add global cannon subexpression elimination 
-04 add hoisting invariants from loops and address 
optimizations 

-05 add range optimizations, instruction scheduling 
and one pass of reducing induction expressions 
-06 no change 

-07 add one more pass of induction expression reduction 
-08 add one more pass of induction expression reduction 
-09 add one more pass of induction expression 

reduction and add hoisting expressions common to 
the then and the else parts of if statements 

Hoisting from branches (and cases alternatives) can be slow 
and does not always provide significant performance gains so 
it can be suppressed. 

Note that using the -OO option can alleviate some problems when 
debugging. For example, using a higher level of optimization, 
you may receive a message that a variable is no longer active or 
is not yet active. If you experience these problems, set the 
optimization level to 0 using the -OO option. 

-o executable file 

(output) This option is to be used in conjunction with 
the -M option. executable_file is the name of the executable 
rather than the default, a.out (self) or a.vox (cross). 

-P invoke the Ada Preprocessor. 

-R VADSlibrary 

(recompile instantiation) Force analysis of all generic 
instantiations, causing reinstantiation of any that are out 
of date. VADS library is the library in which the 
recompilation Ts to occur. If it is not specified, the 
recompilation occurs in the current working directory. 

-r (recreate) Recreate the library's GVAS_TABLE file. This option 
reinitializes the file and exits. This allows recovery from 
"GVAS exhausted" without recompiling all the files in the library. 

-S (suppress) Apply pragma SUPPRESS to the entire compilation 
for all suppressible checks. 

-sh (show) Display the name of the tool executable but do not 
execute it. 

-T (timing) Print timing information for the compilation. 

B-5 






COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-v (verbose) Print compiler version number, date and time of 
compilation, name of file compiled, command input line, 
total compilation time and error summary line. Storage usage 
information about the object file is provided. 

-w (warnings) Suppress warning diagnostics. 

sourcefile name of the source file to be compiled. 

Description 

The ada command executes the Ada compiler and compiles the named Ada 
source file. The file must reside in a VADS library directory. The 
ada.lib file in this directory is modified after each Ada unit is 
compiled. 

By default, ada produces only object and net files. If the -M option 
is used, the compiler automatically invokes a.Id and builds a complete 
program with the named library unit as the main program. 

For cross systems, the compiler generates object files compatible with 
the host linker in VOX format. The VOX format is discussed in 
Appendix A of the Programmer's Guide. 

Non-Ada object files (.o files produced by a compiler for another 
language) may be given as arguments to ada. These files will be passed 
on to the linker and will be linked with the specified Ada object files. 

Command line options may be specified in any order but the order of 
compilation and the order of the files to be passed to the linker can 
be significant. 

Several VADS compilers may be simultaneously available on a single 
system. Because the ada command in any VADS_1ocation/bin on a system 
will execute the correct compiler components based upon visible 
library directives, the option -sh is provided to print th^ name of 
the components actually executed. 

Program listings with a disassembly of machine code instructions 
are generated by a.db or a.das. ^ 

NOTE: If two files of the same name from different directories are 
compiled in the same ada library using the -L option (even if the 
contents and unit names are different), the second compilation will 
overwrite the first. For example, the compilation of 
/usr/directory2/foo.a -L /usr/Vads/test will overwrite the 
compilation of /usr/directory1/foo.a -L /usr/vads/test in the 
VADS library /usr/vads/test. 

NOTE: It is possible to specify the directory for temporary files by 
setting the environment variable TMPDIR to the desired path. If TEMPDIR 
is not set, /tmp is used. If the path specified by TMPDIR does not exist 
or is not writeable, the program exits with an error message to that effect. 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


Diagnostics 

The diagnostics produced by the VADS compiler are intended to be 
self-explanatory. Most refer to the PM. Each RM reference includes a 
section number and optionally, a paragraph number enclosed in 
parentheses.

-DA2.0 

(architecture) Specify the architecture version the compiler 
should generate code for. These options override the ARCHITECTURE 
INFO directive (Default: -DAl.l] (HP PA-RISC only) 

-DO (objects) Use partially linked objects instead of archives 
as an intermediate file if the entire list of objects cannot 
be passed to the linker in one invocation. This option is 
useful because of limitations in the archiver on some hosts 
(including ULTRIX, HP-UX and System V). (VADSself only) 

-DT (time) Displays how long each phase of the prelinking process 
takes. 

-Du unit_list 

(units) Traces the addition of indirect dependencies to the named 
units. 

-Dx (dependencies) Displays the elaboration dependencies used each 
time a unit is arbitrarily chosen for elaboration. 

-DX (debug) Debug memory overflow (use in cases wher& linking 
a large number of units causes the error message "local 
symbol overflow" to occur). 

-E unitname

name of an Ada unit. It must name a non-generic subprogram. 

If unitjname is a function, it must return a value of the 
type STANDARD.INTEGER. This integer result will be passed back 
to the shell as the status code of the execution. 

Description 

a.Id collects the object files needed to make unit_name a adain 
program and calls the ld(l) linker to link together all Ada and 
other language objects required to produce an executable image in 
a.out (self) or a.vox (cross). The utility uses the net files produced 
by the Ada compiler to check dependency information, atId produces 
an exception mapping table and a unit elaboration table and passes 
this information to the linker. The elaboration list generated by 
a.Id will not include library level packages that do not need 
elaboration. Similarly, packages that contain no code that can raise 
an exception will no longer have exception tables. 

a.Id reads instructions for generating executables from the ada.lib 
file in the VADS libraries on the search list. Besides information 
generated by the compiler, these directives aiso include WlTHn 
directives that allow the automatic linking of object modules 
compiled from other languages or Ada object modules not named 
in context clauses in the Ada source. Any number of WITHn 

B-9 









COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


directives may be placed into a library but they must be 
numbered contiguously beginning at WITH1. The directives are 
recorded in the library's ada.lib file and have the following form. 

WITHl:LINK:object_file: 

WITH2:LINK:archive_file: 

WITHn directives may be placed in the local Ada libraries or in 
any VADS library on the search list. 

A WITHn directive in a local VADS library or earlier on the 
library search list will hide the same numbered WITHn directive 
in a library later in the library search list. 

Use the tool a.info to change or report library directives in 
the current library. 

For VADSself on Silicon Graphics Computer Systems, the 
USE_LAST_LINK INFO directive speeds relinking by retaining a list 
of units, theTr types, seals and dependencies. 

VADS_location/bin/a.Id is a wrapper program that executes the 
correct executable based upon directives visible in the ada.lib 
file. This permits multiple VADS compilers to exist on the same 
host. The -sh option prints the name of the actual executable file. 

NOTE: It is possible to specify the directory for temporary files by 
setting the environment variable TMPDIR to the desired path. If TMPDIR 
is not set, /tmp is used. If the path specified by TMPDIR does not exist 
or is not writeable, the program exits with an error message to that effect.

C-l 












APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


APPENDIX F. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


1. Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 

1.1. INLINE_ONLY Pragma 

The INLINE_0NLY pragma, when used in the same way as pragma 
INLINE, indicates to the compiler that the subprogram must 
always be inlined. This pragma also suppresses the genera¬ 
tion of a callable version of the routine which saves code 
space. If a user erroneously makes an INLINEjONLY subpro¬ 
gram recursive a warning message will be emitted and an 
PROGRAM_ERROR will be raised at run time. 

1.2. BUILT_IN Pragma 

The BUILT IN pragma is used in the implementation of some 
predefined Ada packages, but provides no user access. It is 
used only to implement code bodies for which no actual Ada 
body can be provided, for example the MACHINE_CODE package. 

1.3. SHARE_CODE Pragma 

The SHARE_CODE pragma takes the name of a generic instantia¬ 
tion or a generic unit as the first argument and one of the 
identifiers TRUE or FALSE as the second argument. This 
pragma is only allowed immediately at the place of a 
declarative item in a declarative part or package specifica¬ 
tion, or after a library unit in a compilation, but before 
any subsequent compilation unit. 

i 

When the first argument is a generic unit the pragma applies* 
to all instantiations of that generic. When the first argu¬ 
ment is the name of a generic instantiation the pragma 
applies only to the specified instantiation, or overloaded 
instantiations. 

If the second argument is TRUE the compiler will try to 
share code generated for a generic instantiation with code 
generated for other instantiations of the same generic. 
When the second argument is FALSE each instantiation will 
get a unique copy of the generated code. The extent to 
which code is shared between instantiations depends on this 
pragma and the kind of generic formal parameters declared 
for the generic unit. 


C-2 









APPENDIX F OP THE Ada STANDARD 


The name pragma SHARE BODY is also recognized by the imple¬ 
mentation and has ftie same effect as SHARE_CODE. It is 
included for compatability with earlier versions of VADS. 

1.4. N0_IMAGE Pragma 

The pragma suppresses the generation of the image array used 
for the IMAGE attribute of enumeration types. This elim¬ 
inates the overhead required to store the array in the exe¬ 
cutable image. An attempt to use the IMAGE attribute on a 
type whose image array has been suppressed will result in a 
compilation warning and PROGRAM_ERROR raised at run time. 

1.5. EXTERNAL_NAME Pragma 

The EXTERNAL NAME pragma takes the name of a subprogram or 
variable defined in Ada and allows the user to specify a 
different external name that may be used to reference the 
entity from other languages. The pragma is allowed at the 
place of a declarative item in a package specification and 
must apply to an object declared earlier in the same package 
specification. 

1.6. INTERFACE_NAME Pragma 

The INTERFACE_NAME pragma takes the name of a a variable or 
subprogram defined in another language and allows it to be 
referenced directly in Ada. The pragma will replace all 
occurrences of the variable or subprogram name with an 
external reference to the second, link_argument. The pragma 
is allowed at the place of a declarative item in a package 
specification and must apply to an object or subprogram 
declared earlier in the same package specification. The 
object must be declared as a scalar or an access type. The 
object cannot be any of the following: 
a loop variable, 
a constant, 

an initialized variable, 
an array, or 
a record. 

1.7. IMPLICITjCODE Pragma ‘ 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies that implicit code generated by the 
compiler be allowed or disallowed. A warning is issued if 
OFF is used and any implicit code needs to be generated. 
The default is ON. 


1.8. OPTIMIZE_CODE Pragma 


C-3 







APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies whether the code should be optim¬ 
ized by the compiler. The default is ON. When OFF is 
specified, the compiler will generate the code as specified. 

2. Incrementation of Predefined Pragmas 

2.1. CONTROLLED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 

2.2. ELABORATE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada rm. 


2.3. INLINE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.4. INTERFACE 

This pragma supports calls to 'C' and FORTRAN functions. The 
Ada subprograms can be either functions or procedures. The 
types of parameters and the result type for functions must 
be scalar, access or the predefined type ADDRESS in SYSTEM. 
All parameters must have mode IN. Record and array objects 
can be passed by reference using the ADDRESS attribute. 

2.5. LIST 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 


2.6. MEMORYSIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. i 

2.7. NON_REENTRANT 

This pragma takes one argument which can be the name of 
either a library subprogram or a subprogram declared inmedi- 
ately within a library package spec or body. It indicates 
to the compiler that the subprogram will not be called 
recursively allowing the compiler to perform specific optim¬ 
izations. The pragma can be applied to a subprogram or a 
set of overloaded subprograsm within a package spec or pack¬ 
age body. 


C-4 










APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


2.8. NOT_ELABORATED 

This pragma can only appear in a library package specifica¬ 
tion. it indicates that the package will not be elaborated 
because it is either part of the RTS, a configuration pack¬ 
age or am Ada package that is referenced from a language 
other than Ada. The presence of this pragma suppresses the 
generation of elaboration code amd issues warnings if ela¬ 
boration code is required. 

2.9. OPTIMIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 

2.10. PACK 

This pragma will cause the compiler to choose a non-aligned 
representation for composite types. It will not causes 
objects to be packed at the bit level. 

2.11. PAGE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 


2.12. PASSIVE 

The pragma has three forms : 

PRAGMA PASSIVE; 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(SEMAPHORE); 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(INTERRUPT, <number>); 


This pragma Pragma passive can be applied to a task or task 
type declared immediately within a library package spec or 
body. The pragma directs the compiler to optimize certain 
tasking operations, it is possible that the statements in a 
task body will prevent the intended optimization, in these 
cases a warning will be generated at compile time and toll 
raise TASKING_ERROR at runtime. 

2.13. PRIORITY 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.14. SHARED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 


C-5 









APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


2.15. STORAGE_UNIT 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.16. SUPPRESS 

This pragma is implemented as described, except that 
DIVISION CHECK and in some cases OVERFLOW_CHECK cannot be 
supresseH. 

2.17. SYSTEM_NAME 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

3. Implementation-Dependent Attributes 

3.1. P'REF 

For a prefix that denotes an object, a program unit, a 
label, or an entry: 

This attribute denotes the effective address of the first of 
the storage units allocated to P. For a subprogram, pack¬ 
age, task unit, or label, it refers to the address of the 
machine code associated with the corresponding body or 
statement. For an entry for which an address clause has 
been given, it refers to the corresponding hardware inter¬ 
rupt. The attribute is of the type OPERAND defined in the 
package MACHlNEjCODE. The attribute is only allowed within 
a machine code procedure. 

See section F.4.8 for more information on the use of this 
attribute. 

(For a package, task unit, or entry, the 'REF attribute is 
not supported.) t 


3.2. T'TASKID 

For a task object or a value T, T'TASK_ID yields the unique 
task id associated with a task. The value of this attribute 
is of the type ADDRESS in the package SYSTEM.

5. Restrictions On Representation Clauses 

5.1. Pragma PACK 

In the absence of pragma PACK record components are padded 
so as to provide for efficient access by the target 
hardware, pragma PACK applied to a record eliminate the pad¬ 
ding where possible. Pragma PACK has no other effect on the 
storage allocated for record components a record representa¬ 
tion is required. 

5.2. Size Clauses 

For scalar types a representation clause will pack to the 
number of bits required to represent the range of the sub- 
type. A size clause applied to a record type will not cause 
packing of components; an explicit record representation. 
clause must be given to specify the packing of the com-. 
ponents. A size clause applied to a record type will cause 
packing of components only when the component type is a 
discrete type. An error will be issued if there is insuffi¬ 
cient space allocated. The SIZE attribute is not supported 
for task, access, or floating point types. 


5.3. Address Clauses 

Address clauses are only supported for variables. Since 
default initialization of a variable requires evaluation of 
the variable address elaboration ordering requirements 
prohibit inititalization of a variables which have address 
clauses. The specified address indicates the physical 
address associated with the variable. 


C-9 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


5.4. Interrupts 

interupt entries are not supported. 

5.5. Representation Attributes 

The ADDRESS attribute is not supported for the following 
entities: 

Packages 

Tasks 

Labels 

Entries 


5.6. Machine Code Insertions 
Machine code insertions are supported. 

The general definition of the package MACHINE_CODE provides 
an assembly language interface for the target machine. It 
provides the necessary record type(s) needed in the code 
statement, an enumeration type of all the opcode mneumonics, 
a set of register definitions, and a set of addressing mode 
functions. 

The general syntax of a machine code statement is as fol¬ 
lows: 


CODEn' ( opcode, operand {, operand} ); 

where n indicates the number of operands in the aggregate. 

A special case arises for a variable number of operands. 
The operands are listed within a subaggregate. The format 
is as follows: 

CODE_N'( opcode, (operand {, operand}) ); 

For those opcodes that require no operands, named notation 
must be used (cf. RM 4.3(4)). 

CODE_0'( op -> opcode ); 

The opcode must be an enumeration literal (i.e. it cannot be 
an object, attribute, or a rename). 

An operand can only be an entity defined in MACHINE_CODE or 
the 'REF attribute. 

The arguments to any of the functions defined in 
MACHINE CODE must be static expressions, string literals, or 


C-10 







APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


the functions defined in MACHINE_CODE. The 'REF attribute 
may not be used as an argument in any of these functions. 

Inline expansion of machine code procedures is supported. 

6. Conventions for Implementation-generated Names 
There are no implementation-generated names. 

7. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clauses 

Address expressions in am address clause are interpreted as 
physical addresses. 

8. Restrictions on Unchecked Conversions 
None. 

9. Restrictions on Unchecked Deallocations 
None. 


10. Implementation Characteristics of I/O Packages 

Instantiations of DIRECT 10 use the value MAX REC_SIZE as 
the record size (expressed in STORAGEJUNITS) when the size 
of ELEMENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For example for uncon¬ 
strained arrays such as string where ELEMENTJTYPE * SIZE is 
very large, MAX_REC_SIZE is used instead. MAX_RECORD_SIZE 
is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a program before 
instantiating DIRECTIO to provide an upper limit on the 
record size. In any case the maximum size supported is 1024 
x 1024 x STORAGEJUNIT bits. DIRECT_IO will raise USEJERROR 
if MAX_REC_SIZE exceeds this absolute limit. 

Instantiations of SEQUENT IAL_I0 use the value MAX_REC_SIZE 
as the record size (expressed in STORAGEJUNITS) when the, 
size of ELEMENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For example for. 
unconstrained arrays such as string where ELEMENTJTYPE'SIZE 
is very large, MAX REC_SIZE is used instead. 
MAX_RECORD SIZE is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a 
program before instantiating INTEGER_IO to provide an ufcper 
limit on the record size. , 'SQUENTIAL_IO imposes no limit on 
MAX_REC_S 1 ZE. 

11. Implementation Limits 

The following limits are actually enforced by the implemen¬ 
tation. It is not intended to imply that resources up to or 
even near these limits are available to every program. 

11.1. Line Length 


C-ll 






APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


The implementation supports a maximum line length of 500 
characters including the end of line character, 

11.2. Record and Array Sizes 

The 103x10101" size of a statically sized array type is 
32,000,000 x STORAGE_UNlTS. The maximum size of a statically 
sized record type is 32,000,000 x STORAGE_UNITS. A record 
type or array type declaration that exceeds these limits 
will generate a warning message. 

11.3. Default Stack Size for Tasks 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGEJSIZE length specifica¬ 
tion every task except the main program is allocated a fixed 
size stack of 10,240 STORAGE_UNITS. This is the value 
returned by T'STORAGE_SIZE for a task type T. 

11.4. Default Collection Size 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGE_SIZE length attribute 
the default collection size for an access type is 100 times 
the size of the designated type. This is the value returned 
by T'STORAGE_SIZE for an access type T. 

11.5. Limit on Declared Objects 

There is an absolute limit of 6,000,000 x STORAGEJUNITS for 
objects declared statically within a compilation unit. If 
this value is exceeded the compiler will terminate the com¬ 
pilation of the unit with a FATAL error message.
