ABSTRACT 

Expert systems are computer programs which emulate human expertise in well defined problem domains. 
The potential payoff from expert systems is high: valuable expertise can be captured and preserved, 
repetitive and/or mundane tasks requiring human expertise can be automated, and uniformity can be applied 
in decision making processes. The C Language Integrated Production System (CLIPS) is an expert system 
building tool, developed at the Johnson Space Center, which provides a complete environment for the 
development and delivery of rule and/or object based expert systems. CLIPS was specifically designed to 
provide a low cost option for developing and deploying expert system applications across a wide range of 
hardware platforms. The commercial potential of CLIPS is vast. Currently, CLIPS is being used by over 
5,000 individuals throughout the public and private sector. Because the CLIPS source code is readily 
available, numerous groups have used CLIPS as the basis for their own expert system tools. To date, three 
commercially available tools have been derived from CLIPS. In general, the development of CLIPS has 
helped to improve the ability to deliver expert system technology throughout the public and private sectors 
for a wide range of applications and diverse computing environments. 

INTRODUCTION 

Conventional programming languages, such as FORTRAN and C, are designed and optimized for the 
procedural manipulation of data (such as numbers and arrays). Humans, however, often solve complex 
problems using very abstract, symbolic approaches which are not well suited for implementation in 
conventional languages. Although abstract information can be modeled in these languages, considerable 
programming effort is required to transform the information to a format usable with procedural 
programming paradigms. 

One of the results of research in the area of artificial intelligence has been the development of techniques 
which allow the modeling of information at higher levels of abstraction. These techniques are embodied in 
languages or tools which allow programs to be built that closely resemble human logic in their 
implementation and are therefore easier to develop and maintain. These programs, which emulate human 
expertise in well defined problem domains, are called expert systems. The availability of expert system 
tools has greatly reduced the effort and cost involved in developing an expert system. 

The C Language Integrated Production System (CLIPS) [1, 2, 3, 4] is an expert system tool developed by 
the Software Technology Branch at NASA’s Johnson Space Center. The prototype of CLIPS, version 1.0, 
was developed in the spring of 1985 in a UNIX environment. Subsequent development of CLIPS greatly 
improved its portability, performance, and functionality. The first release of CLIPS, version 3.0, was in 
July of 1986. The latest version of CLIPS, version 6.0, was released in August of 1993. A version of 
CLIPS written entirely in Ada, CLIPS/Ada, has also been developed. CLIPS is currently available to the 
general public through the Computer Software Management and Information Center (see appendix). 

KEY FEATURES OF CLIPS 

CLIPS was designed to address several issues key to NASA. Among these were the ability to run on a wide 
variety of conventional hardware platforms, the ability to be integrated with and embedded within 
conventional software systems, and the ability to provide low cost options for the development and delivery 
of expert systems. 

CLIPS is written in C for portability and speed and has been installed on many different computers without 
changes to the source code. At the time of its original development, CLIPS was one of the few tools that 
was written in C and capable of running on a wide variety of conventional platfams. CLIPS can be ported 


569 



to any system which has an ANSI compliant C compiler including personal computers (IBM PC 
compatibles, Macintosh, Amiga), workstations (Sun, Apollo, NeXT), minicomputers (VAX 11/780, 
HP90GO-500), Mainframes (IBM/370), and supercomputers (CRAY).

To maintain portability, CLIPS utilizes the concept of a portable kernel. The kernel represents a section of 
code which utilizes no machine dependent features. The inference engine contains the key functionality of 
CLIPS and is used to execute an expert system. Access functions allow CLIPS to be embedded within other 
systems. This allows an expert system to be called as a subroutine (representing perhaps only one small 
part of a much larger program). In addition, information stored in CLIPS can be accessed and used by other 
programs. Integration protocols allow CLIPS to utilize programs written in other languages such as C, 
FORTRAN, and Ada. Integration guarantees that an expert system does not have to be relegated to 
performing tasks better left to conventional procedural languages. It also allows existing conventional code 
to be utilized. The CLIPS language can also be easily extended by a user through the use of the integration 
protocols. 

To provide machine dependent features, such as windowed interfaces or graphics editors, CLIPS provides 
fully documented software hooks which allow machine dependent features to be integrated with the kernel. 
The I/O router system allows interfaces to be layered on top of CLIPS without making changes to the 
CLIPS kernel. The standard interface for CLIPS is a simple, text-oriented, command prompt. However, 
three interfaces are also provided with CLIPS that make use of the I/O router system and integration 
protocols to provide machine specific interfaces. These interfaces are provided for Apple Macintosh systems, 
IBM PC MS-DOS compatible systems, and X Window systems. Figure 2 shows the CLIPS interface for 
the Macintosh computer.

One of the key appeals of the CLIPS language results from the availability of the approximately 40,000 
lines of CLIPS source code. Because the development of an expert system tool can require irainy man-years, 
the benefits of using CLIPS as a starting point for research and the creation of special purpose expert 
system tools cannot be understated. CLIPS users have enjoyed a great deal of success in adding their own 
language extensions to CLIPS due to the source code availability and its open architecture. Many users have 
also developed their own interfaces and interface extensions [5, 6]. 

KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION 


Expert system tools are designed to provide highly productive environments by allowing knowledge to be 
represented flexibly. A flexible representation scheme allows the application developers to try several 
different approaches or to use an approach best suited to their problem. CLIPS provides a cohesive tool for 
handling a wide variety of knowledge with support for three different programming paradigms: rule-based, 
object-oriented, and procedural. In addition, CLIPS also supports the concepts of iterative refinement 
(refining an expert system with small iterative changes) and rapid prototyping (demonstrating proof of 
concept) which are found in many expert system tools. 

Rule-Based Programming 


The first (and originally the only) programming paradigm provided by CLIPS is rule-based programming. 
In this programming paradigm, rules are used to represent heuristics, or “rules of thumb”, which specify a 
set of actions to be performed for a given situation. A rule is composed of an if portion and a then portion. 
The if portion of a rule is a series of patterns which specify the facts (or data) which cause the rule to be 
applicable. The process of matching facts to patterns is called pattern matching. CLIPS provides a 
mechanism, called the inference engine, which automatically matches facts against patterns and determines 
which rules are applicable. The if portion of a rule can actually be thought of as the whenever portion of a 
rule since pattern matching always occurs whenever changes are made to facts. The then portion of a rule is 
the set of actions to be executed when the rule is applicable. The actions of applicable rules are executed 
when the CLIPS inference engine is instructed to begin execution. The inference engine selects a rule and 
then the actions of the selected rule are executed (which may affect the list of applicable rules by adding or 
removing facts). The inference engine then selects another rule and executes its actions. This process, 
illustrated by Figure 3, continues until no applicable rules remain.

RULES 


Figure 3. Execution of a Rule-Based Program 

To illustrate the advantages of rule-based programming, consider the problem of monitoring a series of 
sensors. The following example program written in the C programming language illustrates how these 
sensors could be monitored using a procedural programming paradigm to determine if any two of the 
sensors have bad values (which a hypothetical expert indicates represents an overheated device). 


571 



♦define BAD 0 
♦define GOOD 1 
♦define DEVICE_OVERHEATED 0 
♦define DEVI CE_NORMAL 1 

int CheckSensors (sensorValues, numberOfSensors) 
int sensorValues [ 3 ; 
int numberOfSensors; 

{ 

int firstSensor, secondSensor; 

for (firstSensor = 1; 

firstSensor <= numberOfSensors; 
firstSensor++) 

{ 

for (secondSensor =1; 

secondSensor <= numberOfSensors; 
secondSensor++) 

{ 

if ((firstSensor != secondSensor) && 

(sensorValues [firstSensor] == BAD) && 

(sensorValues [secondSensor] == BAD)) 

{ return (DEVICE_OVERHEATED) ; } 

} 

} 

return (DEVICE_NORMAL) ; 

l 

The CheckSensors function is implemented by storing the values of the sensors as integers in an array and 
then using two for loops to compare all combinations to determine if any two sensors have bad values. 
This function is relatively efficient if the sensors only need to be checked once. However, if this check is 
performed each time a sensor’s value is changed, then all possible combinations are rechecked which is 
inefficient In addition, the programmer has the responsibility for calling this function whenever an update 
is made to a sensor’s value. An additional function could be written to check only one sensor against all 
other sensors, however, this increases the burden on the programmer. For contrast, the equivalent CLIPS 
code for a rule which performs the same task is shown following. 

(defrule Two-Sensors-are-Bad 

(Sensor (ID-number ?id) (status Bad) ) 

(Sensor (ID-number ~?id) (status Bad) ) 

=> 

(assert (Device (status Overheated) ) ) ) 

The first line of the rule contains the keyword defrule which indicates that a rule is being defined. The 
symbol Two-Sensors-are-Bad is the name of the rule. The next two lines beginning with the symbol Sensor 
are the patterns that form the if portion of the rule. Essentially, the first pattern searches for any Sensor fact 
that contains a status value of Bad and the second pattern searches for another Sensor fact with a status value 
of Bad that does not have the same ID-number as the Sensor fact matching the first pattern. The => symbol 
serves to separate the if portion of the rule from the then portion of the rule. Finally, the assert command in 
the then portion of the rule creates a new fact which indicates that the device has overheated. 

Because of the overhead associated with the inference engine and the generality provided through pattern 
matching, a rule-based program generally does not execute as quickly as a procedural program. However, 
significantly less code is required and the programmer does not have to explicitly check for applicable rules 
when sensor values are changed. Rules are always looking for new facts which satisfy their conditions. 
Indeed, careless implementation of pattern matching capabilities in a procedural language may result in a 


572 



program which runs much less efficiently than its rule-based counterpart CLIPS ’s inference engine is based 
on die Rete algorithm [7] which is an extremely efficient algorithm for pattern matching. 

Ob ject-Oriented Programming 

The second programming paradigm provided by CLIPS is object-oriented programming. This progr ammi ng 
paradigm allows complex systems to be modelled as modular components (which can be easily reused to 
model other systems or to create new components). Object-oriented programming encompasses a number of 
concepts including data abstraction (the ability to define complex objects using high level representations), 
encapsulation (the ability to hide the implementation details of an object, thereby increasing its modularity 
and potential for reuse), inheritance (the ability to define new classes of objects by reusing existing classes), 
and polymorphism (the ability of different objects to respond to the same “command” in specialized ways). 



Output 1 


Figure 4. A Simple Electronic Circuit 

Figure 4 shows a diagram of an electronic circuit consisting of and, or, and not gates. In electronics, a gate 
is a circuit that has an output dependent on some function of its input The gates shown in Figure 4 all 
have boolean inputs and boolean output values. Physically, these boolean values would correspond to high 
and low voltages. Conceptually, these boolean values could be considered as On and Off or True and False. 
An and gate has an output value of True if all of its inputs are True, otherwise its output value is False. An 
or gate has an output value of True if any of its inputs are True, otherwise its output value is False. A not 
gate has an output value of True if its input value is False and an output value of False if its input value is 
True. In Figure 4, if Input 1 and Input 2 are both False and Input 3 and Input 4 are both True, then the 
output of Or Gate ill would be False and the output of And Gate #1 would be True. The output of Not Gate 
it 1 would be True since its input (the output of Or Gate #1) is False. The output of Not Gate tt 2 would be 
False since its input (the output of And Gate #1) is True. Finally, Output 1 from Or Gate #2 would be True 
since at least one of its inputs (the output from Not Gate #1) is True. 

Using object-oriented programming methodologies, it is relatively easy to model the behavior of the 
electronic circuit shown in Figure 4. The first step in modelling the circuit is to define classes which can be 
used to describe the gates used in the circuit Since all of the gates might have some attributes in common 
(such as a part number), it would be useful to first define a Gate class. Another class. One Input, could be 
used to describe the attributes associated with a single input gate (such as a not gate). Since a two input 
gate is essentially a one input gate with an additional input, the Two Input class could inherit the attributes 
of the One Input class and then define additional attributes for the second input. Similarly, a One Output 
class and Two Output class could also be defined. Figure 5 illustrates the basic classes used to describe the 
gate circuits in Figure 4. The classes described illustrate the basic concepts of data abstraction and 
inheritance. Note that even though the circuit gates shown in Figure 4 would not need to utilize the Two 
Output class, other types of gates could utilize this class. For example, a splitter gate (which splits its one 
input into two identical outputs) could make use of this class. 


573 




Figure 5. Classes Used to Describe Electronic Circuit Gates 

Once the base classes for the gates are defined, it is possible to describe the gates in terms of these classes. 
Figure 6 conceptually illustrates how this could be done for the not gate and the and gate. The type of 
inheritance shown in Figure 6 is called multiple inheritance since a single class is inheriting attributes from 
more than one class. For example, the And Gate class inherits attributes from the Two Input, One Output, 
and Gate classes. In contrast, die inheritance shown in Figure 5 is called single inheritance since a single 
class inherits attributes from at most one other class (such as the Two Input class inheriting attributes from 
the One Input class). Some object-oriented programming languages support only single inheritance. CLIPS 
provides support for full multiple inheritance. 

Once the gate classes have been defined, it is possible to define instances (or objects) of these classes. For 
example. Or Gate ft 1 would be a specific instance of the Or-Gate class as would Or Gate #2. It would have 
its own data areas for storing its input and output values. Thus a class serves as the prototypical definition 
which is used for creating objects belonging to that class. 



Figure 6. Building New Classes from Existing Classes 

In CLIPS, objects are manipulated by sending them messages which specify an action to perform. For the 
circuit example, an appropriate action might be to recompute the output of a gate based upon its inputs. 
Notice that even though the or gates and and gates are both Two-Input One-Output Gates, their outputs are 
computed differently. In object-oriented programming, procedures as well as data can be associated with 
objects. Rather than writing one routine to compute the output values for all gate types given their inputs, 
the routines for computing outputs for objects can be encapsulated inside the classes themselves. When an 
or gate is sent a Compute Output message, its output is computed to be True if either of its inputs are 
True, otherwise its output is False. When an and gate is sent a Compute Output message, its output is 


574 









computed to be True if both of its inputs are True, otherwise its output is False. Thus, both objects 
respond differently, yet appropriately, to the same message. This behavior is the essence of polymorphism 
and is illustrated by Figure 7. The procedures attached to classes are referred to as message-handlers.

Procedural Programming 

The third programming paradigm provided by CLIPS is procedural programming. This programming 
paradigm provides capabilities similar to those found in languages such as C, Pascal, Ada, and LISP. With 
respect to building expert systems, these are the least interesting capabilities provided by CLIPS. However, 
the ability to define procedural code directly within CLIPS allows new procedural capabilities to be added to 
CLIPS without the need of a compiler or linker. To add new capabilities to CLIPS which have been written 
in languages such as C, FORTRAN, or Ada, a compiler and linker are required to recompile and relink the 
new source code with the CLIPS source code. CLIPS allows the definition of global variables, functions, 
and generic functions. Generic functions are the most interesting feature of the CLIPS procedural 
programming language in that they allow different pieces of procedural code to be executed depending upon 
the arguments used when calling a function. This capability is called function overloading. As an example, 
the addition function could be overloaded so that numeric data types are numerically added and string data 
types are concatenated. 

CURRENT USES 

Although CLIPS was originally developed to aid in the construction of aerospace related expert systems, it 
has been put to widespread usage in a number of fields. CLIPS is being used by over 5,000 users 
throughout the public and private community including: all NASA sites and branches of the military, 
numerous federal bureaus, government contractors, universities, and many companies At the First and 
Second CLIPS Conferences held in August 1990 and September 1991 respectively, over 120 papers were 
presented on a diverse range of topics. In addition to aerospace and engineering applications, some other 
examples of CLIPS applications include: software engineering, network security, genetics, medicine, 
botany, and agriculture [5, 6]. Several CLIPS based programs have been recognized at the Innovative 
Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conferences [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. CLIPS has been used as the core of at 
least three commercial products and two college level textbooks are available which come bundled with 
CLIPS. 

CONCLUSION 

Because of its portability, extensibility, capabilities, and low-cost, CLIPS has received widespread 
acceptance throughout the government, industry, and academia. The development of CLIPS has helped to 


575 






improve the ability to deliver expert system technology throughout the public and private.sectors for a wide 
range of applications and diverse computing environments.
