1.0 SCOPE 

1.1 Identification 

This Software Programmers Marual (SPM) is wrinen for the Generic Avionics Data Bus 
Tool Kit (GADBTK) Version 1.1. The GADBTK is an Ada Technology Insertion Program 
(ATIP) sponsored effort to produce an Ada binding with the MIL-STD-1553B time multiplex 
serial data bus. 

1.2 System Overview 

The GADBTK is to produce an Ada binding to the 1553B standard by defining the 
hardware elements and data structures used in a 1553 data bus system in tenns of the Ada 
language. These definidons will then be used to provide various building block components 
from which 1553 data bus applications may be constructed. Finally a bus monitor application 
will be constructed from the components as a proof of concept Initial target system for this 
projea will be a Digital Equipment Corporation VAXStation 3200 series con^uter with a 
Computer Technology & Simulation Dept developed Microprogrammable Multiplex Bus 
Interface (CTSD-MMBI). 

1.3 Document Overview 

This manual will detail the programming environment in which the 1553 interface was 
developed.

3.0 SOFTWARE PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT 


a. Equipment configuration. 

In this application the host and target systems are the same. The system is a Digital 
Equipment Corporation VAXstation 3200 series CPU with a Trim Industries Q-BUS expansion 
chassis. Attached to the expansion chassis is a Bit-3 Corporation dual port shared memory. The 
other port of the dual ported memory connects to a Digital Equipment Corporation Uribus cabinet 
which is the host bus fw the CTSD-MMBI adapter. The CTSD-MMBI adapter is a micro- 
programmable bus interface configured for 1553 bus communications. 

b. Operational Information 

1. Machine cycle time. 

n.a. 

2. Word length 

The VAX word length is 32 bits. 

3. Memory capacity and characteristics. 

( The maximum memory is 64 ntegabytes. 

4. Instruction set characteristics. 

See the VAX macro programming handbook. 

5. Interrupt capabilities. 

There are 32 prioritized interrupt levels. 

6. Modes of operation. 

The VAX supports batch, interactive, and network modes with four privilege levels in 
each mode. 

7. Operational registers. 

See the VAX macro programming handbodc. 

8. Error indicators. 

See the VAX error handling facility manual.

9. Input / Output characteristics. 

See the VAX I/O Runtime reference manual. 

10. Special features. 

n.a. 

c. Compilations, assemblies, and linkages. 

The VAX VMS program develc^ment environment is based on an integrated set of 
editors, compilers, linker, and debugger. The linker and debugger arc an integral part of the VMS 
operating system environment and are therefore tied in to the vcrsicai of the operating system. 

This software was developed under version 5.4 of VAX VMS. Digital supplies several editors as 
a standard part of the operating system. In addition, they support a language sensitive editor 
calleo LSE which was used for the production of this program. The version of DEC Ada used for 
compilation was 2.3. To produce an executable image from the existing source code, aeate an 
Ada object library and load all source code files into the library. For information on how to do 
this please see the VAX Ada Programmers Reference Manual. After the source code has been 
loaded into the library, use the automated code management system compile command to con^ile 
the source code. Use the command "ACS LINK/DEBUG /NOOPT MONrrOR_1553" to invoke 
( the linker.
