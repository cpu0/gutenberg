The Asynchronous File Transfer System is used for interactively selecting 
and transmitting text files from the BDSD host processor to an IBM Personal 
Computer. The IBM asynchronous communications support package is used for handling 
the communications on the Personal Computer. An application program (NATURAL, 
COBOL, etc.) is used for selecting and formatting the records to be transmitted, 
and three subroutine modules residing on the BDSD host processor are used for 
interfacing the application program and the communications software. 

Each record transmitted to the Personal Computer must be in the standard 
ASCII format as illustrated below. This record format is directly accessible by 
BASIC and many of the Personal Computer software packages provide utility programs 
for converting them to the format required for the particular package in question. 

Standard ASCII Format 


data, data, "data, data" ,dataCRLF 


In this format each data .value is separated by a comma. A data value that 
has a comma embedded within it must be enclosed within quotation marks. The record 
is terminated with a carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) character sequence. 

Hardware and Software Requirements 


The following hardware and software is needed to access the BDSD host 
processor: 

IBM Personal Computer 

- 64 K bytes memory 

- Asynchronous Communications Adapter 

- IBM Disk Operating System (DOS) and Disk BASIC 

IBM Asynchronous Communications Support Version 2.0 (modified by BDSD) 

How To Use the Asynchronous File Transfer Facility 

Prior to using the Asynchronous File Transfer Facility, a terminal specifi- 
cation for accessing the BDSD host processor must be defined. The terminal 
definition parameters must be set as follows: 


61 



1 - Line Bit Rate (300 or 1200) 

2 - Type of Parity Checking (Even) 

3 - Number of Stop Bits (1 Bit) 

4 - XON/XOFE Support (Absent) 

5 - Line Turnaround Char Sent to Host (XOFF) 

6 - Local or Host Character Echoing (Local) 

7 - First Character To Be Deleted (All) 

8 - Second Character To Be Deleted (LF) 

9 - Third Character To Be Deleted (XON) 

10 - Fourth Character To Be Deleted (None) 

11 - Line End Character Send by Host (CR) 

The application program is responsible for selecting and formatting the 
records making up the file to be transmitted. Each record must be terminated 
with a carriage return character (ASCII Code - OD) . Consult the Personal 
Computer documentation for restrictions on the ASCII file format. The appli- 
cation program can be written in any language supported by COM-PLETE (BDSD's 
teleprocessing monitor) . 

The subroutine modules must be called by the application program to 
facilitate the file transfer. These modules are described below. 

FILEOP - The FILEOP module should be called prior to entering file capture 
mode on the Personal Computer. It sends the message READY DISK FOR FILE TRANSFER 
to the Personal Computer and waits for the operator to ready the disk and reenter 
terminal mode. After terminal mode has been entered, the operator must depress 
the return key to inform the host processor the file transfer is ready to be 
started. 


Format - CALL 'FILEOP'. (COBOL) 

CALL 'FILEOP' # DUMMY (NATURAL) 

Argument s - #DUMMY - Identifies a dummy argument required for the 

NATURAL CALL statement . 

FILEWT - The FIIJEWT module must be called for each record to be transmitted. 
This module converts the record passed by the application program into a format 
suitable for transmission. A line feed (LF) character is appended to the end of 
the record prior to transmission. 

Format - CALL ' FILEWT' USING # RECORD . (COBOL) 

CALL 'FILEWT' # RECORD (NATURAL) 


Arguments - /fRECORD - Identifies the record to be transmitted. The 

maximum length is 250 characters. 

FI LECL - The FILECL module must be called after all records have been trans- 
mitted. This module sends an end-of-file character (hexadecimal 1A) and the 
message FILE TRANSMISSION COMPLETE to the Personal Computer. This message will be

recorded on the Personal Computer's disk but will not be included as part of 
the file due to the end-of-file indicator preceding it. When the terminal 
operator receives this message, the file capture mode on the Personal Computer 
should be ended. The operator then returns to terminal mode. 

Format - CALL ' FILECI,' . (COBOL) 

CALL ' FILECL' # DUMMY (NATURAL) 

Arguments - # DUMMY - Identifies a dummy argument required for the 

~~ NATURAL CALL statement.
