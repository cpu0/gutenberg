THE SECRETARY'S NOTEBOOK 

For a FREE copy of the LogiCall Ensemble, email me at 
rswoger@aol.com or phone me at 630-837-7957. At 
present there are 58 copies of LogiCall that have been 
distributed. Try it, you’ll like it. 


You will all note that we are now using the website 
given us by Steve Bjork. Most like it and all the 
information it provides. A few felt more comfortable with 
the OLD site. SO, I provided both ways. Now, when you 
go to GlensideCCC.com, you will first see the old 
Classic site for about a second (we now refer to this as 
the SPLASH page) and then you will see the new site 
provided by Steve. At this point you can navigate back 
to the Classic site. In the second paragraph of Steve’s 
front page it reads: “To view the Glenside Color 
Computer Club's classic SPLASH page, please use this 
flinkl ” By clicking on the blue word [link], you will return 
to the old Classic web page. 

The new site offers meeting information, CoCoFEST! 
information on events and exhibitors, a calendar, 
resources list, photos, documents such as exhibitor 
contracts, Constitution & Bylaws, and newsletters, and 
contact ability to reach Glenside officers. Please check 
out our new website. John Mark has worked hard on it.

Vintage Computer Festival Midwest 
(VCFMW 8.0) and Emergency 
Chicagoland Commodore 
Convention (ECCC) Report. 

by 

John Mark Mobley 

I attended the VCFMW and ECCC. I spent a good 
amount of my time trying to figure out what the 
Commodore group was doing with their Ethernet cards. 
The answer is: 

1 ) Email (no attachments please) 

2) Internet Relay Chat (IRC) 

3) Telnet 

4) Networked video games 

5) Develop on a PC & then load files to the target 

6) Load and save file to a cloud based file server 

7) Web server 

They have had Ethernet cards for 1 0 years. They have 
developed two networked video games in that time. The 
first game is for two players. Each player aims a cannon 
and takes a shot over a mountain and tries to hit their 


opponent. The second game is for two to eight players. 
This game allows up to eight cars to race against each 
other. They are working on a third game. This game 
would likely allow two to eight players. The game is run 
from a cloud based server and the target is a dumb 
terminal. The target is told to display a sprite in a given 
position. Someone on an Android phone could play 
against someone on a Commodore. 

One person from the Commodore group recommended 
bypassing Ethernet and going directly to Wi-Fi to 
connect the Commodore to the Internet. He used 
Roving Networks RN-XV Module (Wi-Fi) and Adafruit 
XBee adapter kit 5V to 3.3V converter. 

Other Commodore users used a Cirrus Logic CS8990A 
chip to connect to the Internet. However, the chip does 
not include a TCP/IP stack, and therefore required a lot 
of extra code to make it work. 

The CoCo users should also come up with ways to 
connect CoCos over the Internet. Jim Brain 
recommended these chips to possibly be used with the 
CoCo: 

1 ) WIZnet 5500 (includes TCP/IP stack) 

2) WIZnet 5300 (includes TCP/IP stack) 

3) WIZnet 51 00 (includes TCP/IP stack) 

I see three ways to get Internet to the CoCo: 

Example 1 : 

CoCoFEST Wi-Fi => Wi-Fi USB wireless adapter => 
USB => Raspberry Pi (or PC) => USB => USB-to-RS- 
232-Serial => DriveWire cable => CoCo 
Example 2: 

CoCoFEST Wi-Fi => DD-WRT Repeater Bridge => 
Ethernet => CoCo Ethernet Card => CoCo. 

Example 3: 

CoCoFEST Wi-Fi => CoCo Wi-Fi Card => CoCo. 

CoCo users could play games with each other. How 
about a version of Tom Mix's P-51 Mustang Attack 
Flight Simulator that works over the Internet, rather than 
over a modem? This program currently allows two 
players to dogfight each other from separate CoCos 
over a modem. How about a version of Pong that lets 
you play another player over the Internet? 

We could experiment with networked games now. 
Perhaps we can load P-51 Mustang and bring up a P- 
51 Mustang server. The P-51 Mustang server would 
connect your CoCo's serial port over the Internet to 
another P-51 Mustang server. 

Is anybody up for the challenge? 

Duck Duck Go 

By John Mark Mobley 

Duck Duck Go is an Internet search engine that does 
not keep track of what you search for on the Internet. 
They do not sell your search history to advertisers, 
insurance companies, and such. There are no ads 
targeted specifically to you, although there are 
sponsored search results. Search rankings may be 
fairer, in that the search results are identical from one 


5 



user to another. This avoids a “filter bubble” where 
users become isolated from information that differs from 
their own taste/viewpoint/worldview/prior searches. My 
hope is that as more people use this search engine that 
the quality of the search engine will improve. I therefore 
encourage you to give Duck Duck Go a try.

Fest Quest Review 

By John Mark Mobley 

FESQUEST.BAS is an adventure game by Jim Gerrie. 
The game is based on a 1980’s game called “Pit with 
Monsters” for the Sinclair ZX81 (or Timex Sinclair 1000) 
by Jim Ennes. 

The following 3 paragraphs on strategy are from 

http://jimgerrie.blogspot.ca/2013/05/fest-quest-pit-with- 

monster-by-jim.html 


There are several aspects to game play beyond the 
trivia component. These are a legacy of PM (Pit with 
Monsters). The object is to explore and gather the right 
kind of items that will increase your geek cred. Other 
kinds of items add to your “floppy” supply. One must 
learn to recognize the differences between these two 
kinds of items. The opponents have different levels of 
geek cred (1-100). If you run into an opponent who has 
more geek cred than you, they will defeat you. If you 
have more geek cred than them, then you will defeat 
them, but you “use up” geek cred to do so (i.e. the 
amount of geek cred of your opponent is subtracted 
from your geek cred). So you must sometimes avoid 
such combat by using floppy trading (at least as long as 
your “disks” hold out) to overcome more powerful 
opponents. However, I added the trivia question 
component as a randomly occurring “save” feature (you 
only get asked a question half the time when geek 
combat occurs). If you meet up with someone with 
higher geek cred and you answer the question 
correctly, then you beat them no matter how much cred 
they have, but just barely, so your cred goes to 0. If you 
meet someone with higher cred, but flub the question, 
then you lose. But if you meet someone with lower cred 
and get asked a trivia question, but flub the question, 
then your geek cred goes to 0. If you battle someone 
with lower cred, and get the question, you beat them in 
the usual way (your cred is reduced by the # of their 
cred). 

So, in brief, navigating to the top floor takes a bunch of 
strategies. You need to collect floppy trading stuff (or 
equivalents, such as the coco CD or drive-wire cables). 
You also need to collect other items, which increase 
geek cred (manuals & cool hardware). You need to 
avoid combat with people with higher cred unless you 
feel you have enough floppies for floppy trading to 
defeat them, or you are confident enough that your 
trivia knowledge can save you in geek combat no 
matter what their cred. You also have to try to keep 
building up cred and floppy supplies, so sometimes 
careful exploration of rooms (and strategic retreats) can 
be more prudent than simply trying to move forward and 
upward via passages stairs and combat. Use the “s” 
option to see the status of your cred and floppy supplies 
at any “what direction” prompt. I should also mention 
the “q” can be used to start the game over. 

There are also some completely random elements of 
the game that can knock you back down a few levels 
(the object of the game now is to get to floor 20 of the 
hotel where the "NO MINIMUM BID AUCTION" is going 
on). A geek squad can abduct you, or you can 
accidentally wander into an elevator. These events add 
a kind of "snakes and ladders" element to the game. 

Fest Quest is on disk 44 of the LogiCall V7.0 Ensemble 
along with other games by Jim Gerrie.

My initial strategy for winning the game is... 

RUN the game. Press the <BREAK> key and type:

CONT 

H represents your Geek Cred/Health. L represents what 
floor/level of the hotel you are on. If L=1 then you are on 
the 20 th floor of the hotel. S represents how many 
floppies you have.

Adding LogiCall Features To Fest Quest 

By Bob Swoger 

LogiCall provides an easy way to launch programs on 
disk. After running the program the user will want to exit 
the program and return to LogiCall. 

Some programs reset the computer when they exit. 
This would boot the CoCo and LogiCall would start up 
again automatically. However, many programs simply 
halt. Typing RUN <ENTER> will run the program again. 


In a program or game such as FESQUEST above, the 
program normally halts. FESQUEST before halting 
prompts the user “ANOTHER GAME?”. If you respond 
with “N” then the program goes to line 2000 where the 
program puts on the screen; “GOODBYE. SEE YOU 
NEXT YEAR!” The next instruction is END, which 
HALTS the computer and there it sits doing nothing. 
You then have to RESET the computer to get started 
again. 

To get LogiCall running again, insert: GOTO 9998 
before: END so that the line now reads: 

2000 PRINT :PRINT”GOODBYE. SEE YOU AGAIN 
NEXT YEAR!”:G0T09998:END 

Next add the following line to the program: 9998 RUN”L 
Then add this line: 9996 SAVE ’’FESQUEST.BAS” 

Now type: GOTO 9996. Your modified program will now 
be saved and you will return to LogiCall. Leave 9997 
unused in case LogiCall is not on the current disk due 
to the disk being full and you need to direct the program 
to a different drive. For example, if your LogiCall 
program disk were in Drive 0, you would want to add: 
9997 DRIVE 0 to call LogiCall located on drive 0. 

Some game programs prompt the user for a response. 
This might be a good way to leave the game. Go into 
the program to find where you are getting prompted for 
a response. Add another possible response like “Q” for 
quit. Then, if you respond to the prompt with a Q the 
program can be made to G0T09998 and return to 
LogiCall. 

Turtle Graphics

The following messages are from the CoCoList: 

From: "John Mark Mobley” 

Subject: [Coco] Turtle Graphics 

I am looking for material for the next Glenside Color 
Computer Club Newsletter. 

Consider if you would like to write or contribute to an 
article on turtle graphics. 

Turtle graphics is available in the Python programming 
language. 

Perhaps the DECB Draw command has some turtle 
graphics capabilities? 

Perhaps someone knows of a turtle graphics application 
for the CoCo?

Subject: Re: [Coco] Turtle Graphics 
Color Logo and D.L. Logo and probably Super Logo 
(never ran this one) are all based on Turtle Graphics. 
Color Logo even has a "turtle” shaped cursor. All were 
available from Radio Shack. 

I used to run Color Logo quite a bit in the cassette days. 

I did run DL Logo a bit but not enough to learn it well. 
The DL Logo disk I had was in a box of disks I inherited 




from a CoCoNut migrating to PC and I never had the 
manual to learn the language.

I used to have both Color Logo and Super Logo. The 

only real difference with Super Logo that I knew of was 

the fact it could do decimal math so you could create 

circles. Color Logo was integer based so circles looked 

like a figure with a bunch of sides.

In Bresenham's circle algorithm, you don't need decimal 
math, nor a square-root function, nor even 
multiplications & divisions:

This computes squares and square-roots incrementally. 
The trick is that successive results of 1+2+3+4+5+... 
make a square-like sequence: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... also 
follows the pattern (x*x+x)/2. This allows to find

Reminds me of my Ruby/Tk program named 
TkTurtle.rb, which I wrote in 2001. After starting it, you'd 
write this on the prompt to draw the same octogon (no 
need to penup/pendown in this case): 

8.times {It 45; fd 50} 
which is very close to ColorLOGO's

It's available at:

There has been at least another turtle library for Ruby 
since then, but I've never tried it, and I think that it's 
quite recent. I also think that it's closer to Python's, 
whereas my inspiration was really just ColorLOGO 
(though I didn't really mean to replicate the language, 
just the turtle).

Turtle Graphics are a feature of Logo (ok, the best 
known feature), but I wouldn't say it was "based on" 
turtle graphics. D.L. Logo is actually a pretty good Logo 
interpreter and is capable of a whole lot beyond Turtle 
Graphics. 

Odds and Ends 

Bob, it has taken me two days to read the whole report. 
And I think that the magnifier is GREAT. And Allen did a 
real outstanding job. Very interesting all the way. I hope 
that he can do a lot more like that. The club should help 
him out financially I think. I don't have his email address 
or I would tell him myself how much I enjoyed his work. 
Please if you can, email this to him. I think that he is a 
great guy. Just as ALL the guys in the club are great. 
Thanks a lot Bob. 

George 

Hi George, Please excuse the friendliness of this letter. I 
hope it is all right for me to call you George. After 
participating in the auction via video feed with Allen 
Huffman’s help. I already feel like a member of your 
group of coco enthusiasts. After speaking with Bob 
Swoger, I would like to formally join the Glenside color 
computer club. 

After viewing the video feed Saturday and Sunday, I 
really feel I was there. I’m making plans to be there next 
year - at the CoCoFEST! I mean. I’d like to be at your 
annual picnic but I will probably not make that. How 
about a Skype feed for that too? I hope to meet you next 
year. Take care and happy CoCoing! Kip Koon 

Dear Bob, My brother David Macias has been a CoCo 
enthusiast since his first CoCo computer purchased in 
the 1970’s. He enjoyed the CoCoFESTIs and even 
dragged me there one time. After that I understood his 
affection for the CoCo. 

Sadly David died on 2/13/09. I would like to have 
someone benefit from his CoCo stuff someday. If there 
is a local contact who can help me gather that I would 
appreciate it. Sincerely, Elena Macias 

[Dave’s CoCo collection was present at the 2013 
CoCoFEST! “No Minimum Bid Auction” and was

Origin of the BASIC Programming Language 

By Kip Koon, Computer Doc 

I was talking to a friend one day about the Interpreted 
BASIC Language we are all familiar with in our beloved 
Color Computer, relating how the BASIC Language was 
originally a compiled language instead of the interpreted 
language we are all familiar with. He was surprised to 
hear that fact, if I recall correctly. 

I told him about a book I was reading called “Back to 
BASIC: The History, Corruption, and Future of the 
Language” by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz, 
who are the creators of the BASIC language. One holds 
a doctorate in Computer Science and the other holds a 
doctorate in Mathematics, but since I’ve had to move 
much of my stuff around a little before Thanksgiving, I 
can’t locate my copy of the book to verify any facts. It 
has been several months since I read the book, so I’m 
writing this article from memory. If I recall incorrectly, 
please forgive. Thank you. 

It was their insight into an observation of a growing 
need in students at Dartmouth College that led to the 
eventual creation of the BASIC Programming 
Language. Again I will say, “Did you know that the 
original form of the BASIC Language was a Fully 
Structured Programming Language implemented as a 
Fast Compiler?” When a student typed RUN on the 
console, their program was immediately compiled, not 
interpreted, on the spot, and the results displayed right 
there on the student’s screen. This was implemented on 
a GE Mainframe that until that time only had batch 
processing available to run computer programs for 
students (or faculty, for that matter). 

When I found out about that fact, I was shocked. I 
thought, “Well, if BASIC was that good, what happened 
to it?” According to John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz, 
BASICally, Bill Gates happened to it. In their book, John 
Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz both blame Bill Gates for 
the corruption and ultimately the bad reputation that has 
befallen the highly structured wonderful programming 
language that was their creation. 

John and Thomas wanted to create an easily-learned 
computer programming language for non-programmers; 
those students in other courses of study that needed a 
computer to accomplish and realize calculations 
needed to support their studies, but who did not want to 
have to learn computer science just to get their work 
done on the mainframe computer in the computer 
department. They were not there to become computer 
programmers, but rather to become experts in other 
fields of study. 

I have studied many examples of their language 
generously splattered throughout the book, and I must 
say if their BASIC Compiler had been implemented on 
our Color Computer, then we would have had a truly 
powerful, highly structured, easy-to-read programming 
language at our disposal. 


John and Thomas give many comparisons between 
several versions of the BASIC language which existed 
back then in widespread use on several 8-bit machines 
of the day, citing many examples as compared to the 
commands and structure available in their BASIC 
Compiler. Did you know that the file access commands 
like LOAD and SAVE, etc. weren’t really part of the 
BASIC Language itself? Those and several other 
commands were really part of the underlying operating 
system which ran on the GE Mainframe computer there 
at Dartmouth College in the Computer Science 
Department. 

The story behind the initial development and ultimate 
form the original version of the BASIC Compiler took, as 
designed and implemented by John Kemeny, Thomas 
Kurtz, and under their direction, by many computer 
programming graduate students, is a very interesting 
story to behold. I bet the computer room there at 
Dartmouth College was a flurry of activity as each 
graduate student that participated in the development 
and implementation of the BASIC Language compiler 
discovered and created many new ways to implement 
much-needed commands by the student population at 
large. 

After reading the book, I found a copy of the assembler 
source code, as well as a BASIC User’s Manual of one 
of those very first versions of the original BASIC 
Compiler that ran on that GE computer, and I must say, 
it reminds me a lot of 6809 Assembler Source Code. 

One of those implemented commands added later on 
during the development of their BASIC compiler is the 
MAT command. Behind that simple-sounding three- 
letter keyword was a massive programming effort 
culminating in one of the most powerful features of the 
entire language. With one single command, one could 
affect changes to entire arrays of data, or make 
calculations on a mountain of data all at once, to such a 
scale that it boggled the mind to think about it, much 
less to fully understand how it did it. My mind went 
round and round as I studied examples of its use, as I 
had only heard of it, but never had an opportunity to use 
it, since the BASIC interpreters I had available did not 
have it included. 

I’m sure many computer programmers can appreciate 
the effect such a command would have had in their 
programs. For one, programs would have been 
considerably smaller, had that command existed in the 
other BASICS available to them, and much more 
efficient. Yes, John, Thomas and all those graduate 
students there had their hands full, all right. 

If I recall correctly, the BASIC Language was born on 
May 6, 1964 at about 4:10 am when the first BASIC 
program was run, which has, sadly, been lost to time. It 
would have been interesting to see what form that very 
first BASIC program took, albeit probably a simple 
program indeed.

During the first five years of the life of the BASIC 
Language, much change took place in the look and feel 
of the language itself. The very first version of the 
compiler only contained just a few commands, all of 
which are well known in Disk Extended Color BASIC. 
Interestingly enough, the INPUT command was not one 
of them. In the beginning, there was no way to input any 
type of data whatsoever. 

The book mentions what those first few commands 
were and you all would recognize them. They are well 
known. Yes, I’m not mentioning all the details on 
purpose. I want you to enjoy reading the book like I did! 
If I remember correctly, I read it in just a few nights of 
nice golden silence at home in my favorite lounge chair. 
In other words, everybody else was sleeping. I get most 
of my work done at night and it was no exception in the 
reading of this book. I hope you all enjoy learning about 
the Origin of the BASIC Programming Language like I 
did. Qaplah! Starfleet Out! 



CoCo: The Colorful History of 
Tandy's Underdog Computer 

By John Mark Mobley 

Boisy Pitre and Bill Loguidice have written a new book 
on the CoCo. The book is scheduled to be released on 
December 16, 2013. 

The following text is taken from the Amazon Book 
Description... 

This is the first book to document the complete history 
of the Tandy Color Computer (CoCo), a popular 8-bit 
PC series from the 1980s that competed against the 
era's biggest names, including the Apple II, IBM PC, 
and Commodore 64. The book takes you inside the 
interesting stories and people behind this unique, 
underdog computer. 


Both noted computer science and technology 
advocates, authors Pitre and Loguidice reveal the story 
of a pivotal period in the home computing revolution 
from the perspective of Tandy's CoCo. As these 
computers were sold in Radio Shack stores throughout 
the United States and other countries, they provide a 
critical point of reference for key events in the 
unprecedented evolutionary period for the PC industry 
in the 1980s. The book also features first-hand 
accounts from the people who created and promoted 
the CoCo, from the original Tandy executives and 
engineers to today's active product creators and 
information keepers. 

The CoCo impacted many lives, and this book leaves 
no stone unturned in recounting this fascinating slice of 
the PC revolution that is still in play today. From early 
telecommunications experiments to engineering and 
budgetary challenges, it covers all the aspects that 
made the CoCo a truly personal, useful computing 
experience in as small and inexpensive a package as 
possible.

/ U Do You Remember These Bugs? 

These “Bugs” were on every book, article 
and column written from 1974 to 1984 
' and on every piece of hardware produced. 
Many from the Boomer generation would have 
seen these “Bugs”, and may have a memory of the 
materials they were associated with. Bugbooks, which 
later evolved into more than seventy books in the 
“Blacksburg Continuing Education Series”, were used 
in electronics and computer education. 



Why Bugs? 

In a book called “Computer Literacy” by John V. 
Lombardi, the author describes that in the heart of 
every microcomputer resides an electronic device 
known as a microprocessor. That chip of plastic, loaded 
+ with circuits, has an appearance like a rectangular bug. 
This microprocessor “bug-looking thing” is the brain 
of the microcomputer. 

A Picture of Technology From an Earlier Time- 

David Larsen and the LCF Group have arranged items 
for display which describe the newest technology as it 
was pre-1980 before cell phones and iPods. 

Also showcased are all of the popular \BugBooks' and 
'Blacksburg Continuing Education' series of books. 
In the '70s and '80s, these books were a staple for 
technicians, engineers and users of microcomputers-- 
an important part of the digital revolution. 


Conveniently located in suite 8 of The Village Green 
201 E. Main St. Floyd, Virginia 24091 • 540-808-2880 


A Retelling of History... 

of microcomputers 
and related electronics 
is interesting indeed! 

It has been a dream 
to share these stories, 
which have been written 
over a number of years. 

Not Only Computers... 

Other electronics and artifacts, timeline and histories 
from the microcomputer revolution, and other tools 
of the period are represented within the museum. 

The vacuum tube was a 
B necessary part of electronics in 
L the early 1900s. David displays 
f: some of his antique and vintage 
F vacuum tubes at the museum , 
g including an Edison lamp with 
I* carbon filament. 

A Large Collection! 

We strive to show a historical collection which is 
of 'Smithsonian quality'. The pieces at the museum 
represent some of a very large collection amassed 
over 40+ years by David and associates, which is 
stored in a Floyd County warehouse. We hope you 
enjoy the displays and exhibits; invite your friends 
to come and see!
