The NASA STI Program Office ... in Profile 



Since its founding, NASA has been dedicated to 
the advancement of aeronautics and space 
science. The NASA Scientific and Technical 
Information (STI) Program Office plays a key 
part in helping NASA maintain this important 
role. 

The NASA STI Program Office is operated by 
Langley Research Center, the lead center for 
NASA's scientific and technical information. 
The NASA STI Program Office provides access 
to the NASA STI Database, the largest collection 
of aeronautical and space science STI in the 
world. The Program Office is also NASA's 
institutional mechanism for disseminating the 
results of its research and development activi- 
ties. These results are published by NASA in the 
NASA STI Report Series, which includes the 
following report types: 

• TECHNICAL PUBLICATION. Reports of 
completed research or a major significant 
phase of research that present the results of 
NASA programs and include extensive data or 
theoretical analysis. Includes compilations of 
significant scientific and technical data and 
information deemed to be of continuing 
reference value. NASA's counterpart of 
peer-reviewed formal professional papers but 
has less stringent limitations on manuscript 
length and extent of graphic presentations. 

• TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM. Scientific 
and technical findings that are preliminary or 
of specialized interest, e.g., quick release 
reports, working papers, and bibliographies 
that contain minimal annotation. Does not 
contain extensive analysis. 

• CONTRACTOR REPORT. Scientific and 
technical findings by NASA-sponsored 
contractors and grantees. 



• CONFERENCE PUBLICATION. Collected 
papers from scientific and technical 
conferences, symposia, seminars, or other 
meetings sponsored or cosponsored by NASA. 

• SPECIAL PUBLICATION. Scientific, techni- 
cal, or historical information from NASA 
programs, projects, and mission, often con- 
cerned with subjects having substantial public 
interest. 

• TECHNICAL TRANSLATION. 

English-language translations of foreign scien- 
tific and technical material pertinent to NASA's 
mission. 

Specialized services that complement the STI 
Program Office's diverse offerings include creat- 
ing custom thesauri, building customized data- 
bases, organizing and publishing research results . . . 
even providing videos.

Preface 

Some of the primary objectives of the SeaWiFS Project, as stated in Volume 1 of the SeaWiFS Prelaunch 
Technical Report Series (Hooker, et al. 1992) are to achieve a radiometric accuracy to within 5% absolute 
and 1% relative, water-leaving radiances to within 5% absolute, and chlorophyll a concentration to within 35% 
over the range of 0.05-50 mgm"^. These goals are challenging, because they require very accurate estimation of 
a large number of variables, both radiometric and biological. The SeaWiFS Project, in collaboration with the 
SIMBIOS Project, continues to address calibration, measurement protocol, and data analysis issues associated 
with reducing the uncertainties in the key variables required to achieve the stated measurement goals. This 
overall effort has now been underway for a decade and continues. The work completed prior to the launch of 
SeaWiFS is documented in Hooker and McClain (2000). All 14 volumes of the SeaWiFS Postlaunch Technical 
Report Series have been dedicated to calibration and validation topics (these include two index volumes). 

Volume 15 is the report of the second Data Analysis Round Robin executed in March 2000 (DARR-00), which 
focused on variations in spectral upwelling radiance, downwelling irradiance, and diffuse attenuation coeffi- 
cients resulting from differences in data processing methods. The first Data Analysis Round Robin (DARR-94) 
demonstrated that different analysis techniques can produce reasonably similar results with so-called good data 
(Siegel et al. 1995); however, with noisy data, the results were inconsistent. DARR-94 did not recommend 
specific techniques as being clearly superior to others. DARR-00 represents a more detailed intercomparison, 
but does not include the same suite of analysis methods. The participants in DARR-00 were the Goddard Space 
Flight Center, the Joint Research Center, and Satlantic, Inc. All three groups have extensive experience and 
have worked on a variety of field programs together. Each has developed its own analysis approach making 
an intercomparison a natural extension of their ongoing collaboration. As might be expected, the results show 
differences in the derived products and in some cases, the differences are substantial. These results are of interest 
to the bio-optics community because many groups have also developed their own analysis methodologies and 
should be aware of the considerations outlined in this study. 

These analysis round robins were conducted on a voluntary basis with the philosophy and purpose of addressing 
difficult processing problems so as to deliver better data products. The DARR-00 group has dealt with a number 
of perplexing issues and has documented their approach and findings in an open and straightforward manner. 
Their efforts and honest appraisals are laudable, and advance the state of the art a step closer to meeting our 
data accuracy requirements.

Abstract 

The accurate determination of upper ocean apparent optical properties (AOPs) is essential for the vicarious 
calibration of the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) instrument and the validation of the derived 
data products. To evaluate the importance of data analysis methods upon derived AOP values, the Second Data 
Analysis Round Robin (DARR-00) activity was planned during the latter half of 1999 and executed during March 
2000. The focus of the study was the intercomparison of several standard AOP parameters: a) the upwelled 
radiance immediately below the sea surface, L^,(0",A); b) the downward irradiance immediately below the 
sea surface, Ed{0~,X)] c) the diffuse attenuation coefficients from the upwelling radiance and the downward 
irradiance profiles, ^^(A) and /^^(A), respectively; d) the incident solar irradiance immediately above the sea 
surface, Ed{0'^ , A); e) the remote sensing reflectance, RrsW] f) the normalized water-leaving radiance, [Lu/(A)]^; 
g) the upward irradiance immediately below the sea surface, Eu{0~), which is used with the upwelled radiance 
to derive the nadir Q-factor immediately below the sea surface, Qn(0",A); and h) ancillary parameters like 
the solar zenith angle, 6, and the total chlorophyll a concentration, Ct^, derived from the optical data through 
statistical algorithms. In the results reported here, different methodologies from three research groups were 
applied to an identical set of 40 multispectral casts in order to evaluate the degree to which differences in data 
analysis methods influence AOP estimation, and whether any general improvements can be made. The overall 
results of DARR-00 are presented in Chapter 1 and the individual methods used by the three groups and their 
data processors are presented in Chapters 2-4. 



PROLOGUE 

The Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) 
Project is tasked with executing a program to acquire a 
global ocean color data set, vahdate and monitor its ac- 
curacy and quality, process the radiometric data into geo- 
physical units using a set of atmospheric and bio-optical 
algorithms, and distribute the final products to the scien- 
tific community through the Goddard Space Flight Cen- 
ter (GSFC) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC). 
The long-standing objective of the SeaWiFS Project is 
to produce water-leaving radiances to within 5% absolute 
(Hooker and Esaias 1993). 

The accurate determination of upper ocean apparent 
optical properties (AOPs) is essential for the vicarious cal- 
ibration of an ocean color sensor like SeaWiFS and the val- 
idation of the derived data products, because the sea-truth 
measurements are the reference data to which the satellite 
observations are compared (McClain et al. 1998). The only 
economically feasible approach for minimizing spatial bi- 
ases for a global data set is to maximize the acquisition of 
in situ measurements by soliciting data from the oceano- 
graphic community at large. The SeaWiFS Bio-Optical 
Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS) is the database 
maintained by the Project for these data and SeaWiFS 
sponsored field activities (Hooker et al. 1994). 

The uncertainties associated with in situ AOP mea- 
surements have various sources, such as, the deployment 
and measurement protocols used in the field, the absolute 
calibration of the radiometers, the environmental condi- 
tions encountered during data collection, the conversion 
of the light signals to geophysical units in a data process- 
ing scheme, and the stability of the radiometers in the 



harsh environment they are subjected to during trans- 
port and use. In recent years, progress has been made 
in estimating the magnitude of some of these uncertain- 
ties and in defining procedures for minimizing them. For 
the SeaWiFS Project, the first step in the process of con- 
trolling sources of uncertainty was to convene a workshop 
to draft the SeaWiFS Ocean Optics Protocols (SOOP). 
The SOOP adheres to the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study 
(JGOFS) sampling procedures (Joint Global Ocean Flux 
Study 1991) and defines the standards for optical measure- 
ments to be used in SeaWiFS radiometric validation and 
algorithm development (Mueller and Austin 1992). The 
SOOP is periodically updated as deficiencies are identified 
and outstanding issues are resolved (Mueller and Austin 
1995, and Mueller 2000). 

The follow-on inquiries into controlling sources of un- 
certainty investigated a variety of topics. The SeaWiFS In- 
tercalibration Round-Robin Experiment (SIRREX) activ- 
ity demonstrated that the uncertainties in the traceabihty 
between the spectral irradiance of caUbration lamps were 
approximately 1.0%, and the intercomparisons of sphere 
radiance was approximately 1.5% in absolute spectral ra- 
diance and 0.3% in stability (Mueller et al. 1996). The first 
SeaWiFS Data Analysis Round Robin (DARR-94) showed 
differences in commonly used data processing methods for 
determining Lu{0~ , X) and Ed(0'^,A) were about 3-4% of 
the aggregate mean estimate (Siegel et al. 1995). Hooker 
and Aiken (1998) made estimates of radiometer stability 
using the SeaWiFS Quality Monitor (SQM), a portable 
and stable light source, and showed the stability of their 
radiance and irradiance sensors in the field during a 36- 
day deployment was on average to within 1.0% (although 



Results of the Second SeaWiFS Data Analysis Round Robin, March 2000 (DARR-00) 



some channels occasionally performed much worse). More 
recently, Hooker and Maritorena (2000) quantified differ- 
ences in the in- water methods and techniques employed 
for making radiometric measurements in support of Sea- 
WiFS validation and demonstrated a total uncertainty in 
the measurement of in-water AOPs at approximately the 
3% level. 

As part of the SeaWiFS Project calibration and val- 
idation activities, the SeaWiFS field program conducted 
specific experiments to investigate these issues. The ex- 
periments took place during several Atlantic Meridional 
Transect (AMT) cruises on board the Royal Research Ship 
James Clark Ross (JCR) between England and the Falk- 
land Islands. The odd-numbered, southbound cruises sam- 
pled the boreal autumn and austral spring: while the even- 
numbered, northbound cruises sampled the boreal spring 
and austral autumn (Aiken and Hooker 1997). 

The accuracy of any AOP determination is a function 
of the quality of the observational measurement, the data 
acquisition methodology, and the data processing method 
employed. The former includes the quality of the optical 
calibration and the radiometric stability of the instruments 
while they are being used in the field. To minimize observa- 
tional uncertainties, the SeaWiFS Project has sponsored a 
variety of multidisciplinary workshops to outline the obser- 
vations and sampling protocols required for bio-optical al- 
gorithm development (Mueller and Austin 1992 and 1995). 
One of the consequences of the workshops was the estab- 
lishment of the series of SIRREX activities to demonstrate 
and advance the state of the art for calibrating the instru- 
ments used in field activities. 

Although the SeaBASS architecture allows for some 
quality control (Hooker et al. 1994), it is based primar- 
ily on resolving obvious clerical errors in the reporting of 
where and when data acquisition activities took place — it 
does not attempt to quantify differences in the data analy- 
sis methods employed. The latter is, in part, a function of 
how the individual software packages deal with data filter- 
ing, binning, smoothing, and removing possible artifacts 
from changes in surface illumination, ship shadow, or re- 
flections and wave focusing. 

The focus of this intercomparison study is the estima- 
tion of a variety of optical parameters derived from ver- 
tical profiles of the downward irradiance, Ed{z,X), the 
upwelled (nadir) radiance, Lu{z,X), and the upward ir- 
radiance, Eu{Z:X)- In the results reported here, different 
methodologies from three international groups are applied 
to the aforementioned multispectral profiles to evaluate the 
degree to which data analysis methods influence AOP es- 
timation, and whether any general improvements can be 
made. In addition to GSFC, there were three groups in- 
volved: 

a) The University of California at Santa Barbara 
(UCSB) Institute for Computational Earth System 
Science (ICESS), 



b) The Joint Research Centre (JRC) Marine Environ- 
ment Unit of the Space Applications Institute, and 

c) Satlantic, Inc. (Halifax, Canada). 

The overall results of the second Data Analysis Round 
Robin (DARR-00) are presented in Chapter 1 and the indi- 
vidual methods of the three groups are presented in Chap- 
ters 2 4, respectively. The participants in the activity are 
given in Appendix A. A summary of the material presented 
in each chapter is given below. 

1. The Second SeaWiFS Ocean Optics DARK 

(DARR-00) 

The focus of this round-robin study was the estimation 
of a variety of commonly used data products derived from 
in-water optical measurements. Eleven parameters impor- 
tant to bio-optical analyses were determined and compared 
from three different in-water optical data processors fro;m 
the JRC, GSFC, and Satlantic, Inc. The parameters we;re 
calculated for a data set covering a large range of total 
chlorophyll a concentration (0.08-2.43 mgm"*^). All three 
processors were intercompared using 40 optical profiles; the 
JRC and GSFC processors were further intercompared us- 
ing an additional 10 casts (the larger data set increased the 
amount of data in very clear waters, thereby extending the 
lowest total chlorophyll a concentration to 0.027 nig iTi""^). 
In terms of overall spectral averages, many of the JRC and 
GSFC results intercompared to within 2.5%, but none of 
the Satlantic results intercompared with the other proces- 
sors at this level. Band- ratio averages, however, frequently 
intercompared to within 2.5% for all processor combina- 
tions, even when the overall spectral averages did not. 
These results suggest a database constructed with pro- 
cessed data from a wide source of contributors will have 
substantially higher uncertainties than a database con- 
structed with raw data which is processed with a single 
processor, although band ratios regularly provide reduced 
uncertainties with respect to individual spectral uncertain- 
ties. 

2. The GSFC Data Processing System 

The GSFC data processing system was designed to cal- 
culate apparent optical properties from underwater profiles 
of upv/ard and downward irradiance, as well as upwelling 
radiance, from a wide variety of open ocean regimes. The 
full processing involves three steps: a) the calibration of 
the data, b) the establishment of the extrapolation inter- 
val, and c) the derivation of the final data products. In the 
first step, special files containing dark voltages are used to 
remove detector offsets and apply a pressure tare to the 
depth sensor. The second step is done interactively while 
viewing all the optical and ancillary (sensor tilts, fluores- 
cence, etc.) fields. The final step is usually executed in 
batch mode using a file of extrapolation limits created in 
the second step. All of the code is written in the Interac- 
tive Data Language (IDL) programming environment from 
Research Systems, Inc. (Boulder, Colorado).

3. The JRC Data Processing System 

The JRC Data Processor was developed for the analy- 
sis of field data collected in coastal and marine regions in 
support of ocean color calibration and validation activi- 
ties. The code specifically supports the calibration, for- 
matting, visualization, and processing of in-water optical 
profiles of Lu{z,X), Ed{z,X), and Eu{z,X) collected with 
the Satlantic seven-channel OCR-200 and OCI-200 sen- 
sor series. The user can define a variety of options which 
permit the selection of the extrapolation interval for the 
computation of the near-surface values, and the removal 
of outliers through statistical filtering. Relevant features 
include the possibility to minimize measurement perturba- 
tions such as instrument self shading, bottom effects, and 
superstructure shading (although the latter is restricted to 
measurements performed at the Acqua Alta Oceanographic 
Tower (AAOT) site in the northern Adriatic Sea). Each 
step of the processing is supported by the graphic presen- 
tation of intermediate results. Output products are the 
subsurface values L^,(0",A), EdiO'^X), and Eu{0~ , X); the 
diffuse attenuation coefl[icients Kd.{X), Ki{X), and Ku{X)] 
plus the derived products it^(0", A), Rrs{X), [Lvv(A)]^, and 
Qn(0-,A). 



4. The ProSoft Optical Data Processor 

The ProSoft data processor was developed for the analy- 
sis of optical data collected with instruments manufac- 
tured by Satlantic, Inc., including profiling and fixed-depth 
(buoy) systems. The data processing steps are organized 
into different levels which follow, as much as possible, the 
procedures given in the Ocean Optics Protocols for Sea- 
WiFS Validation, Revision 1 (Mueller and Austin 1995). 
The processing involves three steps wherein the level -1 raw 
data (usually binary) are converted to calibrated values 
(engineering units) using one of several options for dark 
current correction, the level -2 data are averaged and cor- 
rected for acquisition and performance problems (if any), 
and the level -3 data are used to compute the final data 
products, e.g., i^rs, [^u/(A)]j^, photosynthetically avail- 
able radiation (PAR), etc. Processing can be done manu- 
ally (and interactively) by the user, guided by the ProSoft 
processing steps, or in a fully automated batch mode. A 
notable difference between ProSoft and other data proces- 
sors is the diffuse attenuation coefficient can be estimated 
using a traditional estimation of the slope of the optical 
variables within a user-defined extrapolation interval or us- 
ing a new methodology based on multiresolution wavelet 
analysis.

Abstract 

The focus of this round-robin study was the estimation of a variety of commonly used data products derived 
from in-water optical measurements. Eleven parameters important to bio-optical analyses were determined 
and compared from three different in-water optical data processors from the JRC. the GSFC, and Satlantic. 
Inc. The parameters were calculated for a data set covering a large range of total chlorophyll a concentration 
(0.08-2.43 mgm"'^). All three processors were intercompared using 40 optical profiles: the JRC and GSFC 
processors were further intercompared using an additional 10 casts (the larger data set increased the amount of 
data in very clear waters, thereby extending the lowest total chlorophylls concentration to 0.027mgm"^). In 
terms of overall spectral averages, many of the JRC and GSFC results intercompared to within 2.5%, but none 
of the Satlantic results intercompared with the other processors at this level Band-ratio averages, however, 
frequently intercompared to within 2.5% for all processor combinations, even when the overall spectral averages 
did not. These results suggest a database constructed with processed data from a wide source of contributors 
will have substantially higher uncertainties than a database constructed with raw data which is processed with a 
single processor, although band ratios regularly provide reduced uncertainties with respect to individual spectral 
uncertainties. 



1.1 INTRODUCTION 

The SeaWiFS calibration and validation plan (Hooker 
and McClain 2000) relies on radiometric measurements 
made at sea by a diverse community of investigators. One 
of the long-standing objectives of the SeaWiFS Project is 
to produce spectral water-leaving radiances, Lvv(A), within 
an uncertainty of 5% (Hooker and Esaias 1993), and the 
sea-truth measurements are the reference data to which the 
satellite observations are compared (McClain et al. 1998). 
The accuracy of the field measurements are, therefore, of 
crucial importance. 

If a total 5% uncertainty level is to be maintained for a 
vicarious calibration exercise (remote plus in situ instru- 
mentation), approximately half of the uncertainty budget, 
i.e., 2.5%) (actually if quadrature sums are used, the ground 



truth component is closer to 3.5%), is available for the 
ground truth component. Hooker and Maritorena (2000) 
investigated whether or not current deployment and pro- 
cessing schemes meet the 2.5% objective, and found several 
systems almost did. Their study considered four sources 
of uncertainty: calibration, in situ stability, data collec- 
tion, and data processing. They estimated data processing, 
which was restricted to a single data processing package, 
contributed approximately 2% uncertainty to the total un- 
certainty. 

The primary objective of DARR-00 was to use multiple 
data processors to investigate whether or not a data pro- 
cessing uncertainty below the 3-4% result determined for 
DARR-94 is achievable. Two uncertainty thresholds were 
considered for this inquiry: 2.5% as a hoped for minimum 



S. Hooker, G. Zibordi, J-F. Berthon, D. D'Alimonte, S. Maritorena, S. McLean, and J. Sildam 



(because it represents almost all of the ground truth un- 
certainty budget, but is below the DARR-94 results), and 
1.0% as a needed goal (because it permits some expansion 
in the other components of the total uncertainty budget). 

1.2 INSTRUMENTATION 

As part of the SeaWiFS Project caUbration and vali- 
dation activities, the SeaWiFS field program participated 
in AMT cruises on board the JCR and in deployments to 
the AAOT site. The AMT Program exploits the passage 
of the JCR as it transits more than 100° of latitude and 
50° of longitude in the North and South Atlantic Oceans 
between the UK and the Falkland Islands in support of 
British Antarctic expeditions. In September, the JCR sails 
from the UK, and the following April it makes the return 
trip with the vast majority of the sampling taking place in 
Case-1 waters (Aiken et al. 2000). 

The AAOT is located in the northern Adriatic Sea 
(12.51°E,45.31°N) approximately 15 km east of the city of 
Venice (Italy). The site has been visited on a monthly basis 
since the fall of 1995 in support of ocean color caUbration 
and validation activities. Because of its near-coastal loca- 
tion, the site may be characterized by Case-1 or Case-2 
conditions. 

The AOP instruments used on AMT and AAOT de- 
ployments included the SeaWiFS Optical Profiling System 
(SeaOPS) and the Low-Cost NASA Environmental Sam- 
pling System (LoCNESS) for the former, and the Wire- 
Stabilized Profiling Environmental Radiometer (WiSPER) 
and a variant of the miniature NASA Environmental Sam- 
pling System (miniNESS) for the latter. SeaOPS and WiS- 
PER are deployed using a winch and crane, whereas, LoC- 
NESS and miniNESS are floated away from the sampling 
platform and deployed by hand. 

Although there are many differences between optical 
instruments deployed with winch systems versus free-fall 
units, the primary differences are related to ship-induced 
perturbations, wave motion, and the time required to per- 
form a cast. Optical instruments deployed with winch sys- 
tems potentially suffer from more disadvantages than ad- 
vantages: 

1. Cranes have a limited reach, so platform perturba- 
tions can be a problem. 

2. For a ship, the vessel is not decoupled from the 
ocean surface, so roll and pitch can cause measure- 
ment problems (particularly for irradiance sensors). 

3. Winches and cranes are sophisticated systems, so 
there is a continuing vulnerability associated with 
breakdowns, especially with the hydraulic subsys- 
tems (this vulnerability is much reduced in the shal- 
low coastal environment where small electric winch- 
es are the most frequently used). 

4. At sea, winches and cranes are stowed during pas- 
sage, so they require relatively lengthy preparation 



time for operations to begin and end, which means 
a quick cast during optimal sky conditions is fre- 
quently difficult to achieve. 

5. The instruments are not submerged until they are 
far from the side of the platform, so there is very 
little chance of them being damaged by wave action. 

6. Many winches have low wire speeds, so the cycle 
rate for a complete ca,st is relatively long (in shallow 
water this is not the case). A long cycle rate means 
cloud contamination during a cast is likely, and the 
cast frequently must be temporarily halted to allow 
the cloud to pass, which adds to the time required 
(of course, a low wire speed means high vertical 
sampling resolution). 

Tethered (or free-fall) systems, in comparison, have more 
strengths than weaknesses: 

A. The profiler (and sometimes the reference) can be 
deployed away from the platform clear of any plat- 
form shading or reflections to the in situ light field. 

B. The profiler is not subject to wave action, but it 
must be properly trimmed to ensure minimal tilts 
during descent. 

C. A free-floating reference is not decoupled from sur- 
face motion, but engineering solutions and deploy- 
ment practices can be adopted to reduce this effect. 

D. There is a direct cable connection between the in- 
struments and the data acquisition units, so there is 
no complicated (hydraulic) machinery or electrical 
(slip ring) connection which can require long repair 
times in the event of a failure. 

E. The cable is usually a lighter material than steel 
(e.g., Kevlar®t), and is more easily damaged than 
the standard hydrowire used with winch systems. 

F. The instruments are usually hand lowered close to 
the side of the ship, so they are vulnerable to dam- 
age by wave action. 

G. Deployment and recovery can be accomplished with 
only two scientists which ensures a rapid cycle rate. 

The latter is particularly important, because it means casts 
can be executed in between cloud passage and more casts 
can be done in a particular unit of time. It also means 
station scheduling can be kept informal with the ship being 
stopped only when the illumination conditions are optimal. 
All of the radiometers, including any spares, were man- 
ufactured by Satlantic, Inc. (Halifax, Canada). The basic 
subcomponents of the light systems were the power and 
telemetry units, called DATA-lOOs, the series 200 Ocean 
Color Irradiance (OCI-200) sensors, and the series 200 
Ocean Color Radiance (OCR-200) sensors. The radiome- 
ters have seven channels, which were chosen to correspond

(Hooker et al. 1993). 

1.2.1 The AMT Instruments 

SeaOPS is composed of two sets of instruments. The 
in-water component is composed of a downward-pointing 
radiance sensor (OCR-200), which measures L^^(z,A), an 
upward-pointing irradiance sensor (OCI-200). which mea- 
sures Ed{z, A), and a downward-pointing irradiance sensor 
(OGI-200), which measures Eu[z,X). Internal tilt sensors 
quantify the vertical orientation ((^) of the profiler as it 
is lowered through the water. The above-water compo- 
nent, an OCT 200, is fitted to a pole on a mast and mea- 
sures the incident solar irradiance above the ocean surface. 
Ed{^^ , A). A custom-built T-shaped frame is used to carry 
SeaOPS, which is lowered and raised through the water 
column by a winch; data are collected during the lowering 
and raising of the frame as down and up casts, respectively. 

The positioning of the equipment on the SeaOPS frame 
was developed with a geometry that ensured the light sen- 
sors were in close proximity to one another while prevent- 
ing the radiance sensor from viewing any part of the sup- 
port (Fig. 1). The narrow geometry of the frame was de- 
signed to provide a minimal optical cross section. The field 
of view of the irradiance sensor was only influenced by the 
7 mm winch wire.

SeaOPS 



Fig. 1. A detailed layout of the SeaOPS com- 
ponents showing the dimensional relationships be- 
tween the pieces of equipment. 

Careful attention was paid to the balance of the instru- 
ment frame, even though SeaOPS had tilt and roll sensors. 
At the start of each cruise, the frame was trimmed wqth 
lead weights in air, accounting for the in-water weights of 
the sensors: final trim checks were carried out in situ dur- 
ing the first (test) station. The typical lowering and rais- 
ing speed of the winch was approximately 0.20-0.25 ms~^. 



For most stations, the sun was kept on the same side from 
wliich SeaOPS was deployed except if adverse sea or wind 
conditions prevented this. The crane used had about a 
10 m reach over the side of the ship. 

The LoCNESS profiler is not a new instrument per se, 
but instead is built up from the SeaOPS components. Sea- 
OPS has two pairs of internal tilt sensors, one pair for 
when it is oriented horizontally and one pair for when it is 
oriented vertically for the LoCNESS configuration. In its 
prototype configuration, LoCNESS measured two compo- 
nents of the light field (Aiken et al. 1998); the DATA-100 
and the two light sensors were connected in line using ex- 
tension brackets with an OCR-200 at the nose (pointing 
downwards to measure Ly,) and an OCI-200 at the tail 
(pointing upwards to measure E^,). The addition of weight 
to the nose bracket and buoyant (foam) fins to the tail 
bracket produced a balanced package that fell through the 
water column with minimum tilts (less than 2°). 

The Three-Headed Optical Recorder (THOR) option 
allowed LoCNESS to measure the same three components 
of the in-water light field as SeaOPS (Fig. 2). In all con- 
figuration options, the power and telemetry cable to the 
profiler extended through the field of view of the irradi- 
ance sensor, but the small diameter of the cable (7mm) 
minimized any negative effects on the measured light field . 
The irradiance incident at the sea surface was measured 
with a sensor installed on a mast situated above the ship's 
deck (often called the reference or decA^ cell measurement).

The principle advantage of LoCNESS in comparison to 
conventional free-fall profilers is its cost and flexibility: it 
can be assembled from relatively low cost components and 
it can be quickly reconfigured, because the radiometers 
used are not integral to the design. For example, the two

different nose sensors can be replaced with two identical 
sensors so they can be intercompared in situ. 

A summary of the center wavelengths for the SeaOPS 
and LoCNESS radiometers is given in Table 1. All of the 
instruments have very similar center wavelengths, and a 
common solar reference was used for the two systems. 

1.2.2 The AAOT Instruments 

The WiSPER system is permanently installed on the 
AAOT and is operated from a 7m platform extension on 
the southeastern side of the second level. A custom-built 
profiling rig and the positioning of the equipment on the rig 
were developed with a geometry that ensures all radiome- 
ters do not view any part of the mechanical supports. The 
radiometers are mounted on a 1 m extension boom which 
displaces them from the bulk of the underwater instrumen- 
tation and puts them approximately 7.5 m from the nearest 
tower leg. Two taught wires anchored between the tower 
and the sea bottom prevent the movement of the rig out 
of the vertical plane defined by the wires. 

The narrow geometry of the WiSPER frame was de- 
signed to provide a minimal optical cross section. The field 
of view of the irradiance sensor is obstructed by the power 
and telemetry cable a^ well as the stabilization wires, but 
all of these have very small cross sections. Careful atten- 
tion was paid to the rigidity and stability of the rig, so 
there is no need for tilt or roll sensors. 

WiSPER uses the same kind of optical sensors (the 7- 
channel OCR-200 and OCI-200 series of instruments) and 
makes the same measurements as SeaOPS: one OCI-200 to 
measure Ed{z,X), one OCR-200 to measure Lu{z,X), and 
one OCI-200 to measure Eu{z,\), One difference between 
SeaOPS and WiSPER, is the solar irradiance sensor for the 
latter is regularly occulted at the end of a cast to determine 
the diffuse (or indirect) solar irradiance, E^(0"*",A). 

A special kind of DATA-100, the MOR-005, provides 
the analog- to-digital (A/D) conversion and telemetry ca- 
pability for the WiSPER instruments. The equipment 
is powered directly from 12 V lead- acid batteries which 
are stored and kept charged on the tower. WiSPER is 
raised and lowered using a small electrical winch. The 
typical lowering and raising speed of the winch is approx- 
imately 0.08 ms"^ Visual sea- and sky-state observations 
are recorded during all casts. A schematic of the WiSPER 
system is shown in Fig. 3. 




Fig. 3. The measurements made with the WiS- 
PER system. The in-water sensors are shown in a 
distorted configuration, so each can be seen clearly. 
Their actual physical layout is similar to SeaOPS. 

The miniNESS profiler makes the same measurements 
as WiSPER, except it is deployed as a tethered, free-fall 
package (and has internal tilt sensors). It is a variant of 
LoCNESS and is built with the same modular components: 
a DATA-100 (with 16-bit A/D converters) for power and 
telemetry, and 7-channel OCR-200 and OCI-200 sensors. 
The main difference between the LoCNESS and miniNESS 
profilers is the former has all of the light sensors mounted 
at the ends of the rocket-shaped profiler, whereas the latter 
has the E^, and L^ sensors mounted on the fins and Eu on 
the nose. An adapter is used to mount the Eu sensor on 
the nose (a flared metal cage can be used to protect this 
sensor against accidental bottom impacts). 

Putting fight sensors on the fins destabilizes the profiler 
(although, careful trimming of the profiler has regularly 
produced tilts less than 2°), and it makes the L^ sensor 
more susceptible to shading. This problem was minimized 
by choosing where the mechanical termination was with 
respect to the sensors and the sun. In general, the two 
sensor fins, which are 180° apart, will align perpendicular

to the mechanical termination when the cable is pulled in 
to bring the profiler to the surface (before a profile). To 
minimize L^ shading, all that is required is to choose which 
of the other two fins should be used for the mechanical 
termination, so the Lu sensor aligns towards the sun. A 
schematic of the miniNESS profiler is shown in Fig. 4.

A summary of the center wavelengths for the WiSPER 
and miniNESS radiometers is given in Table 2, all of which 
are very similar. Multiple entries for a particular sensor 
type represent alternative configurations. For the solar ref- 
erence measurement, both sampling systems always used 
the same reference. 

1.3 THE DARR-00 DATABASE 

The DARR-00 data processing groups participated as 
volunteers, so to minimize the work associated with ingest- 
ing a potentially wide variety of formats, one data format 
was chosen: tab-delimited files complying with the Amer- 
ican Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), 
i.e., standard text files with the entries separated by tabs. 



Ten optical casts with supporting calibration and ancillary 
documentation from a diverse a set of bio-optical regimes, 
in terms of chlorophyll 0, concentration, were chosen for 
four different instrument systems (for a total of 40 casts). 
The types of instruments were classified into two broad 
categories based on the deployment method used, free fall 
or winch and crane (20 casts for each), so the importance 
(if any) of deployment methods could be determined. 

To further simplify the comparisons, the instruments 
involved were restricted to the OCR-200 and OCI-200 Sat- 
lantic series of light sensors. Restricting the data to ASCII 
files from one instrument series limited the data sources to 
the JRC and GSFC groups. The GSFC group submitted 
10 casts each from SeaOPS and LoCNESS, while the .JRC 
group submitted 10 casts each from WiSPER and mini- 
NESS. The instruments were also classified according to 
the primary sampling environment involved, deep ocean or 
shallow coastal (20 casts for each), which correspond in a 
general sense to Case-1 or Case-2 conditions, respectively. 

Although the submitted 40 casts covered a wide range 
of conditions, they did not adequately represent very clear 
waters, so an additional 10 casts from very low chloro- 
phyll a conditions were added to the data set (Sect. 1.5). 
Because the participating groups were volunteering their 
time and effort, not all of them could accommodate the 
extra burden of 10 more casts, so the only groups that 
analyzed these extra data were the JRC and GSFC. As 
will be shown subsequently, this had a minimal effect on 
the conclusions derived from the different results. 

1.3.1 The GSFC Data 

The GSFC data are filed using a simple naming scheme: 

MCCHDNNN.EEE, 

where the encoding letters are defined as 

M A one-letter code for each major campaign (A for 
AMT): 
CC A two-digit sequential campaign number: 
H A single letter indicating the hosting instrument for 
the measurement which is based on the serial num- 
ber (S/N) of the DATA-100 involved (0 for SeaOPS 
S/N 4, K for LoCNESS S/N 11, and L for LoCNESS 
S/N 4); 



S. Hooker, G. Zibordi, J-F. Berthon, D. D'Alimonte, S. Maritorena. S. McLean, and J. Sildam 



D A single letter indicating the deployment direction 
(D for down and U for up); 

NNN A three-digit sequential cast number; and 
EEE The file extension (SHO for GHz in-water optical 
data, and SHM for 6 Hz solar reference data) . 

An inventory of all the data used for the DARR-00 activity 

is presented in Appendix B. 

1.3.2 The JRC Data 

The JRC data are also organized using a simple algo- 
rithm to set the file names; 

ICCSNL.EEE, 

the encoding for which is defined as 

I A one-letter code for each instrument (W for WiS- 
PER and P for the miniNESS profiler; 
CC A two-digit sequential campaign number; 

S A single letter indicating the data type (S for station 
and D for dark); 

N A one-digit station number; 

L A sequential letter incremented for each cast (A for 
1, B for 2, etc.); and 
EEE The file extension (MOR for WiSPER, OCP for mini- 
NESS, and MVD for the solar reference). 

1.3.3 The Data Products 

Water-leaving radiance is a primary variable in the cal- 
ibration and validation process, not only because it is a 
first-order quantity (i.e., it appears explicitly in the radia- 
tive transfer equation governing the remote sensing obser- 
vations), but also because it is the central physical quantity 
for bio-optical studies in the upper ocean. Many variables 
used for the latter (e.g., RrsW) are derived directly from 
LwW and are the input data for the algorithms used to 
invert ocean color observations into chlorophyll a concen- 
trations. 

Many in-water techniques for calculating LwW are 
based on formulations well expressed by the Smith and 
Baker (1984) method. Variations are a consequence of 
the procedures (and platforms) used to acquire the data, 
and how the in-water data are propagated to the surface. 
The Lu{X,z) near-surface profile is usually used to com- 
pute the diffuse attenuation coefficient, Kl{X,Zo), as the 
local (around the depth zq) slope of ln[L^,,(A, z)]. Kl{X, zq) 
is used to extrapolate the upwelled radiance through the 
upper layer to null depth. LwW, is then obtained by 
properly propagating the near-surface upwelling radiance, 
L^4(A,0~), through the air-sea interface. 

The data products compared are those commonly as- 
sociated with bio-optical analyses: 

1. The upwelled radiance immediately below the sea 
surface, 1/^(0", A); 



2. The downward ir radiance immediately below the 
sea surface, Ed{0~ , A); 

3. The diffuse attenuation coefficients from the up- 
welling radiance and the downward irradiance pro- 
files, Ki{\) and Kd{X), respectively; 

4. The incident solar irradiance immediately above the 
sea surface, Ed{^'^ , A); 

5. The remote sensing reiiectance, Rrs{X); 

6. The normalized water-leaving radiance, [l/w(A)]^; 

7. The upward irradiance immediately below the sea 
surface, Eu{0~), which is used with the upwelled 
radiance to derive the nadir Q-factor immediately 
below the sea surface, <5n(0") ^); and 

8. Ancillary parameters like the solar zenith angle, 0, 
and the total chlorophyll a concentration, C^^, de- 
rived from the optical data. 

The latter is usually determined using one of the standard 
ocean color (OC) algorithms (O'Reilly et al. 1998). For the 
DARR-00 activity, the OC2v2 algorithm is intercompared, 
because all of the processors used this algorithm. 

Plots of calibrated optical measurements for selected 
casts from the JRC data set are shown in Figs. 5-7. A 
subset of wavelengths are shown to maintain clarity of pre- 
sentation. The first file, W56S7A from WiSPER (Fig. 5), 
was selected to show the influence of multiple stratification 
on the in-water light fields. The second file, P60S4R from 
miniNESS (Fig. 6), is an example of the significance of sur- 
face effects, i.e., wave focusing, which is most clearly seen 
in the Ed{z, A) data. The third file, W56S1A from WiSPER 
(Fig. 7), shows an ideal case with no in-water extra sources 
of variance and very stable solar illumination. 

Plots of calibrated optical measurements for selected 
casts from the GSFC data set are shown in Figs. 8-10. 
Again, a subset of wavelengths are shown to maintain clar- 
ity of presentation. The first file, A07KD025 (Fig. 8), corre- 
sponds to high chlorophyll a conditions ( Cxa =^ 1 . 1 8 mg m " '^ ) 
wherein several in-water parameters that characterize the 
water column are confined to the upper layer: the depth 
of the chlorophyll maximum (DCM) as estimated from the 
fluorometer data is 37 m, the mixed layer depth (MLD) is 
29 m, and the one-percent light level (OLL), based on the 
decay of the surface PAR value, is 38 m. The second file, 
A07KD040 (Fig. 9), is an example of a cast in very clear 
water (Cr^ =0.08 mgm"^) with typical deep ocean water 
properties: the DCM is 139 m, the MLD is 121 m, and the 
OLL is 124m. The last file, A060D033 (Fig. 10), is pre- 
sented to show a case with abnormally large vessel motion 
in eutrophic waters (Cra=2.43mgm"^) during otherwise 
very good conditions. 

1.4 DATA ANALYSIS METHODS

to be more correct than another, so an unbiased parame- 
ter is needed to compare the various methods. The aver- 
age unbiased percent difference (UPD) between two data

where t^ is the time associated with the sample (the i index 
selects a sample) , A^^ is the number of measurements be- 
ing compared, and ^ represents the data product, L^(0"), 
Ed{0~), Kd, etc. The A and B codes identify the proces- 
sors involved: J for JRC, G for GSFC, and S for Satlantic. 
The UPD between the upwelled radiances (at null depth) 
estimated with the JRC and GSFC processors, for exam- 
ple, is V^^*^(A) and represents the uncertainty between the 
two processors in estimating Lu(0~,A). 

Spectral averages of the UPD are calculated by includ- 
ing a summation in (1) over the requisite number of spec- 
tral bands. iV^:

Although several schemes can be devised for spectral aver- 
ages, the ones considered here are as follows: the average 
of the blue-green wavelengths, ^^^(Ai-s), the average of 
the red wavelengths, ^^^(Ae-?), and the average of all the 
wavelengths, ^^^(Ai-y). 

The primary interest in this study are spectral esti- 
mates of water-leaving radiance, but the most frequently 
used ocean color algorithms, OC2v2 (O'Reilly et al. 1998), 
uses band ratios, e.g., the 490 and 555 nm bands. Conse- 
quently, another important parameter for the above-water 
analyses presented here is the UPD for a band ratio:

where Q3 is the band ratio of a particular data product for 
wavelengths k and / (the data product for wavelength k 
is divided by the data product for wavelength I). For this 
study, the only band ratio presented is between 490 and 
555 nm. For example, the average band ratio results for 
L^(490) and L^(555) for the JRC and GSFC processors is 
denoted as ^l^{X3/s)> 

Most results are presented in tables as a function of 
data products and method codes. In these cases, a short- 
hand notation is used for spectral averages and band ratios: 

^1-7 The average of all (seven) wavelengths, 412-683 nm; 

^1-5 The average of the (five) wavelengths in the blue- 
green part of the spectrum, 412-555 nm: 

^6-7 The average of the (two) wavelengths in the red part 
of the spectrum, 665-683 nm: and 

^3/5 The average of the band-ratio results calculated for 
490 and 555 nm (bands three and five, respectively). 



The processing of the data does not always end with the 
calculation of Lw{X). The WiSPER and miniNESS data, 
for example, are collected in the proximity of a large struc- 
ture sited in shallow water, so there are other processing 
aspects which need to be considered: 

1. Instrument self-shading, which affects all in-water 
instruments, particularly in the red domain where 
water absorption is elevated: 

2. Bottom reflection, which can be important in shal- 
low^ water: and 

3. Platform shading, which can effect any instrument 
deployed in close proximity to a large structure (e.g., 
a research vessel or offshore tower). 

Correction terms for these effects are generally not applied, 
because they require accurate knowledge of several atmos- 
pheric and marine optical parameters, and they may re- 
quire extensive computations. 

1.5 RESULTS-STANDARD (VI) 

The first results presented are the comparisons derived 
from the processing of data using standard options for each 
processor, i.e., those procedures normally employed by the 
processing groups. These results are also referred to as 

the version 1 (VI) results, and subsequent changes to the 
processors are identified by increasing version numbers. 

In addition to the instrument types (SO, LN, WP, and 
MN), the data sets can be naturally divided into a vari- 
ety of categories depending on the sampling location, the 
deployment methodology, and the total chlorophyll a con- 
centration. The former two are encoded as follows; 
DO For the deep ocean data (SO and LN); 
SC For the shallow coastal data (WP and MN): 
WC For the winch and crane data (SO and WP): and 
FF For the free-fall data (LN and MN). 

The deep ocean data are all from Case-1 conditions, and 
the shallow coastal data are from Case-2 conditions or from 
water near the threshold between Case-1 and Case-2 in 
terms of the Loisel and Morel (1998) classification scheme. 
The CTa (in milligrams per cubic meter) is used to sepa- 
rate the data into three concentration (or trophic) regimes, 
which are encoded as follows: 

ET For the eutrophic regime {Cxa > I)i 
MT For the mesotrophic regime (0.1 < Cxa ^1); ^^^ 
OT For the oligotrophic regime (Ct^ < 0.1). 
These groups are a mixture of all instrument types, except 
all the oligotrophic data come from the LN data set. 

The various combinations of processor intercomparisons 
are identified by two-letter codes: 

JG For the JRC and GSFC processors; 
JS For the JRC and Satlantic processors: and 
GS For the GSFC and Satlantic processors.

As will be shown below, the JRC and GSFC processors 
are architecturally similar. Unlike the Satlantic processor, 
they are also maintained by individual investigators with 
narrowly defined user groups, so they can be quickly mod- 
ified without negatively effecting a large community. 

The contribution of each intrument type to the concen- 
tration regimes is presented in Table 3, which is divided 
into two groups given by the subtotal and total partitions. 
The former represents the data used for intercomparing all 
the processors, whereas the latter represents the additional 
data beyond the original 40 casts to ensure a reasonable 
number of samples in each concentration regime (which 
were only processed by the JRC and GSFC groups). 

Table 3. The number of casts from each instru- 
ment type within each concentration regime. Also 
shown are the sampling location and deployment 
method codes for each instrument, as well as the 
groups that processed the indicated casts.

The distribution of the instrument types within the var- 
ious categories shown in Table 3 will produce biases in 
some of the results. For example, the majority of the shal- 
low coastal data are in the mesotrophic regime, which also 
means the majority of these data are for stable references. 
These biases are not necessarily detrimental to the compar- 
ison process, because they allow a quantitative assessment 
of the differences between the instrument types, sampling 
locations, and deployment methods. It is important to re- 
member these biases, however, because they do mitigate 
the application of the results to broader generalizations. 

The various processing options that can influence the 
final determination of LwW can have a far-reaching effect 
on bio-optical analyses. Five different processing options 
are considered in the presentation of the results: 

1. Tilt filtering (this is usually a simple threshold — if 
the tilt of the instrument exceeds a particular value, 
the data are not used); 

2. Ed{0'^) normalization (to account for the influence 
of changing illumination conditions during the pro- 
file, some processors normahze the in-water light 
data by Eci{0'',t)/Ed{0'',to), where to is the start 
time of the profile); 

3. The type of linear fit used in the extrapolation pro- 
cess (simple least-squares regressions are common, 



but some processors use routines wherein any data 
with a large variance are weighted the least); 

4. Whether or not data are statistically filtered, i.e., 
any point more than a specified number of standard 
deviations {na) from the linear regression is consid- 
ered a so-called outlier and is ignored (this is a more 
extreme form of weighted fitting); and 

5. The limits of the extrapolation interval, i.e., the up- 
per and lower depths. 

For the three processors, the standard options used for 
each are as follows: 

J Tilt filtering (5"^ threshold), £^^(0"*') normalization, 
3a filter for outliers, least-squares (unweighted) lin- 
ear fit, and extrapolation depths chosen to ensure 
all wavelengths are well parameterized; 
G No tilt filtering, no £^^(0"^) normalization, not fil- 
tered for outliers, least-squares (unweighted) linear 
fit, and extrapolation depths chosen so the blue- 
green wavelengths are optimally parameterized; and 
S Tilt filtering (5° threshold), no Ed{0^) normaliza- 
tion, filtered for outliers, least-squares (unweighted) 
linear fit, and near-surface extrapolation based on 
binned data. 
All of the results presented in this section are based on 
these standard processing options. 

1.5.1 XJO-) 

All the DARR-00 processors calculated LwW from 
profiles of upwelled spectral radiance, Lu{z, A), so for this 
study, the most important parameter is arguably Lu{0~ , A), 
i.e., the null depth estimation of the upwelling radiance. 
Unfortunately, with the instruments and deployment meth- 
odologies currently available, it is not practical to measure 
L^(0", A) precisely at an infinitesimal depth below the sur- 
face. A profile of L^i(^,A) must, therefore, be measured 
over the upper few optical depths with sufficient accu- 
racy to determine Kl{z, A) for Lu{z, A), and to propagate 
Lu{z^ A) to the surface over a near-surface depth interval. 
The percent differences (or uncertainties) between the 
three data processors in the calculation of Lu{0~ , A) is pre- 
sented in Table 4t. There are several aspects of the inter- 
comparisons which are worth noting: 

a) The smallest uncertainties are associated with the 
JRC and GSFC intercomparisons (the Satlantic in- 
tercomparisons are, on average, a little more than 
twice cLS large); 



t In all of the results tables, the intercomparisons of the data 
processors based on the four instrument types (SO, LN, WP, 
and MN), are for the original 40-cast data set (usually the 
top three boxes of information in the table, but sometimes 
only the top box). The JG comparisons of different sampling 
locations (DO and SC), deployment methods (WC and FF), 
and concentration regimes (OT, MT, and ET), are for the 
extended 50-cast data set, and are always the bottom two 
boxes of information.

b) All of the intercomparisons have maximum uncer- 
tainties in the red part of the spectrum (665 nm), 
with minimal uncertainties in the blue-green do- 
main (490-510 nm) which increase towards the blue 
(412-443 nm); 

c) The band-ratio results are the smallest uncertainties 
(except for some of the Satiantic intercomparisons); 

d) The shallow coastal data (particulary the WiSPER 
data) have smaller uncertainties than the deep ocean 
data (most notably in the red wavelengths); and 

e) As a function of increasing chlorophyll a concentra- 
tion (OT to MT to ET), there is a general increase 
in uncertainties in the blue-green part of the spec- 
trum, but a decrease in the red wavelengths, and a 
decrease in the band-ratio uncertainties. 

In terms of the desired 2.5% intercomparison objec- 
tive, there are several cases where this threshold is sat- 
isfied. For the Satiantic processor, only the blue-green 
WP uncertainties and some of the band-ratio uncertain- 
ties are below 2.5% — most of the results are, on average, 
significantly above the threshold. For the JRC and GSFC 
processors, all of the WP, and many of the MN uncertain- 
ties, are below 2.5%, as are all of the band-ratio uncertain- 
ties. In addition, many of the shallow coastal plus winch 
and crane average results, as well as the oligotrophic and 
mesotrophic results, are to within 2.5% in the blue-green 
wavelengths, but all the red wavelengths results are above 
the 2.5% threshold. 

1.5.2 EdiO-) 

Profiles of the downward spectral irradiance, Ed{z,X), 
are required to compute the diffuse attenuation coefficient, 
Kd{z,\), and the irradiance reflectance, R{X). As with 
Lu{0~ , A), Ed{0~ , A) is usually determined by extrapolation 
over a near-surface depth interval from the profile data, in 
this case, Eci{z,X). The percent differences between the 
three data processors in the calculation of Ed{0~ , A) is pre- 
sented in Table 5. The results partition immediately into 
two groups, irrespective of the processors being compared: 
a) the best results are associated with a stable reference 
(WP, MN, and SC), and b) the worst results are associated 
with an unstabilized reference (SO, LN, and DO). 

The uncertainties associated with the Satiantic proces- 
sor are significantly higher (on average by a factor of 3) 
than the intercomparisons between the JRC and GSFC 
processors, the differences in the red wavelengths are higher 
than the blue and green by more than a factor of 2 (on aver- 
age), and the band-ratio uncertainties are always smaller 
than the individual wavelengths. In terms of the 2.5% 
threshold, the JG uncertainties for the shallow coastal data 
(WP, MN, and SC) are almost always to within 2.5%. 

Regardless of the processors being intercompared, the 
SO and LN (DO) data are always associated with higher 
uncertainties, with the latter being the highest. When 



coupled with the aforementioned shallow coastal data re- 
sults, this produces very good results for the WC and 
SC data categories (the latter are always to within 2.5%), 
and poorer results for the DO and FF categories (which 
are only to within 2.5% for the band-ratio results). The 
uneven distribution of instrument types and deployment 
methods results in a distribution as a function of concen- 
tration regimes which is hard to interpret. The ET data 
have the smallest differences while the OT data have the 
largest, but this is because the former are dominated by 
the SC systems and the latter by the DO systems. 

The overall poorer results obtained with the deep ocean 
data (SO and LN) is a consequence of two factors. First, 
most of these data are in clear water, so wave focusing 
effects can substantially influence where the top of the ex- 
trapolation interval is chosen (the greater vertical resolu- 
tion of the SO data helps reduce this effect). Second, the 
data are from arccis with deep mixed layers, so the bottom 
of the extrapolation interval is less constrained than that 
encountered in the shallow coastal environment. Taken 
together, these two factors can result in substantially dif- 
ferent top and bottom depth intervals from different oper- 
ators. If the number of points differ substantially and the 
total possible number of points in the extrapolation inter- 
val is not very large (possible with the high descent rates 
of free-fall instruments), this will effect the extrapolation 
process and, thus, the final Ed[^~ , A) estimate. 

This point is well quantified by considering the average 
number of points in the extrapolation ranges for the JRC 
and GSFC processing [Nj and Ng, respectively) of the 
SO, LN, WP, and MN data: 

SO Nj - 214 and Nq = 345; 

LN Nj = 39 and Nq = QS; 

WP Nj - 208 and No - 216; and 

MN Nj = 20 and No - 24. 
The percent differences for these data (using the largest 
value as the reference number) are as follows: 38% (SO), 
43% (LN), 4% (WP), and 14% (MN). The ranking of the 
JG results in terms of smallest- to-largest average percent 
differences is WP, MN, SO, and LN— so, the quality of the 
intercomparison is well correlated with how similarly the 
extrapolation intervals are defined. 

Although it is easy to understand why the type of ref- 
erence being used would influence the intercomparison of 
£'rf(0^,A) values, it is not so obvious as to why it influ- 
ences the Ed{0~, A) intercomparisons. The reason is a con- 
sequence of how the two variables are normally used dur- 
ing data processing. For most processors, the Ed{0~,X) 
estimate from the in- water profile is properly adjusted for 
the influence of the air-sea interface and then compared 
with the above-water measurement of Ed{0'^,X). The two 
should agree to within a few percent, and in most cir- 
cumstances, alternative (but valid) processing options are 
tried until they do. Consequently, there is usually a steer- 
ing effect of the solar reference data on the estimation

of Eci{0 , A). This point is developed more completely in 
Sect. 1.5.4 when the Ed{0'^,X) intercomparisons are made. 



1.5.3 Ki and K^ 

Diffuse attenuation coefficients are calculated from the 
vertical profiles of the in-water light field. The Lu{z,X), 
Ed{z,X)^ and Eu{z^X) data are used to calculate Kl{X), 
Kd{X), and Ku{X), respectively, which are needed to calcu- 
late (by linear extrapolation of the log-transformed data) 



the null depth values of the corresponding optical param- 
eters. Of the three attenuation coefficients, only ^^^(A) is 
intercompared for all three processors; Ki{X) is only in- 
tercompared for the JRC and GSFC processors, because 
Kl{X) is not normally reported by the Satlantic processor 
(although it is calculated and used). 

Given the importance of the attenuation coefficients to 
the derivation of the primary optical variables, it is im- 
portant they be estimated as accurately as possible. Sum- 
maries of the intercomparison of the Kd{X) and Kl{X)

values are presented in Tables 6 and 7, respectively. The 
smallest differences are associated with the JRC and GSFC 
inter comparisons. For the JG comparisons, the winch and 
crane data (WP and SO) are the best, and the free-fall 
data the worst (the LN data are notably poor). For the 
JS and GS comparisons, there is a mixture of best results 
between SO and MN instrument types; the LN results are 
always the worst, and in some cases, significantly so. In 
all cases, the band-ratio results are better than the spec- 
tral averages, but they are not always better than some 
individual wavelengths. 

One quality control parameter that can be apphed to 
the Kd{X) estimates is to compare them to Kd{X) values 
for pure water, Kyj{X), computed from the Pope and Pry 
(1997) absorption data and the Morel (1974) backscatter 
values for pure water. f The intercomparison is made by 
calculating the percentage of casts for each processor and 
the deployment methods (WC and FF) for which Kd{X) < 
Kyj{\) (in the original 40-cast data set), and the results are 
shown in Fig. 11 as a function of wavelength. Noting that 
one cast equates to 5% in each 20-cast category within the 
plot (FF or WC), the WC data satisfy the quahty control 
test except for the Satlantic results beyond the blue part 
of the spectrum, for which an increasingly large number of 
casts do not. All of the processors have difficulty with the 
FF data, for which there is a general increase in failures 
from the blue to the red domain. Although not shown in 
the plot, the majority of the failures come from the LN 
data (as inferred in Table 6).

1.5-4 Ed{0^) 

Changing atmospheric conditions, particularly under 
cloud cover, leads directly to variability of the in-water 
light field which must be corrected to obtain accurate es- 
timations of optical properties from irradiance or radiance 
profiles. First-order corrections for this variability can be 
made using above-water (on deck) measurements of so- 
lar irradiance, £d(0^,A). For the AMT and AAOT mea- 
surements, the emphasis is on collecting data only dur- 
ing clear-sky conditions, so the extra variance from at- 
mospheric variabiHty during optical profiUng is minimized. 
Regardless of whether or not the in-water optical data are 
corrected for atmospheric variabihty on a point-by-point 
basis (Sect. 3.3.2.2), the Ed{0^ , A) data are needed to pro- 
vide for the normahzation of LwW in the calculation of 
R,,{X) and [LwW]^- 

Although not as notable as the results for £^^(0 ,A) 
(Sect. 1.5.2), the Ed{0'^,X) differences also partition into 
two groups, as shown in Table 8: a) those associated with 
a stable reference (WP, MN, and SC), and b) those asso- 
ciated with an unstabilized reference (SO, LN, and DO). 
Because all of the intercomparisons for the three proces- 
sors are excellent — always to within 2.5% — it is easier to 
see this effect in the DO and SC intercomparisons for the 
JG extended data set. For these results, the unstabiUzed 
reference values are a factor of 5-6 larger with respect to 
the stabilized values (noting that this equates to a differ- 
ence of approximately 1.0%); the band-ratio results are, 
however, to within 0.1% in either case. All of the OT data 
are from unstabihzed references, so these results are the 
poorest, with some uncertainties approaching 2.5%. 

As discussed earlier, a useful diagnostic as to the effi- 
cacy of the Ed{0~,X) calculation is the ratio between the 
two with the latter adjusted for the effects of the air-sea 
interface: £^(0", A)/ [0.96^^(0"', A)]. A comparison of the 
UPD values for this ratio is presented in Table 9. For 
all processors, the lowest differences occur for the stable 
references, WP and MN (SC), and the largest differences 
occur for the unstabilized references, SO and LN (DO), 
with the latter reaching very high differences for the JS 
and GS comparisons. The variance associated with choos- 
ing the top and bottom extrapolation intervals is included 
in these results, so the true effect of an unstabihzed ref- 
erence will not be known until the processing options are 
made more equal (Sects. 1.6.1 and 1.6.2).

variable for estimating chlorophyll a concentration from in 
situ optical measurements. The OC2v2 algorithm, for ex- 
ample, uses logiQ [i?rs(490)/i?rs(555)] as the input vari- 
able. In addition, the remote sensing reflectance is one of 
the primary variables relating the AOPs of seawater to the 
inherent optical properties (lOPs). 

The excellent agreement between the processors in the 
calculation of Eci{0^ , X) (Sect. 1.5.4) suggests much of the 
variability in the derivation of Rrs{X) will be due to the dif- 
ferences in calculating Lvv(A). Because the water-leaving 
radiance is computed as a simple constant times the up- 
welled radiance at null depth, Lw{X) — 0.54L^,(0~A), the 
difl'erences in the Lu{0~X) comparisons will determine most 
of the Rrs{X) diff"erences. The exceptions will be when the 
diff'erences in £^^(0'^,A) were maximal, which will increase 
the differences above the levels found for Lu{0~X). 

The uncertainties for the Rrs{X) intercomparisons are 
given in Table 10. As anticipated, the levels of agreement 
closely follow the values established for Lu{0~ , X) (Table 4): 

1. The smallest differences are associated with the JG 
intercomparisons (the JS and GS intercomparisons 
are, on average, a little more than twice as large); 

2. The maximum differences are in the red part of the 
spectrum (665 nm), with minimal differences in the 
blue-green (490-510 nm) which increase towards the 
blue (412-443 nm); 

3. The band-ratio results are always the smallest dif- 
ferences (except for some of the Satlantic intercom- 
parisons); 

4. The shallow coastal data (particulary the WiSPER 
data) have smaller differences than the deep ocean 
data (most notably in the red wavelengths); and 

5. The results as a function of increasing chlorophyll a 
concentration, are not as simply defined as before, 
because of the elevated differences in Ed{0'^,X) for 
the OT regime. 

The 2.5% intercomparison objective is satisfied for nu- 
merous comparisons noted earlier. For comparisons with 
the Satlantic processor, only the blue-green WiSPER and 
some of the band-ratio uncertainties are below 2.5% — most 
of the results are, on average, significantly above the thresh- 
old. For the JG comparisons, all of the WiSPER, and some 
of the miniNESS differences, are below 2.5%, as are all of 
the band-ratio results. Many of the shallow coastal results 
satisfy the objective, but the winch and crane average re- 
sults do not (except the band-ratio results), because of the 
elevated differences in the estimation of £^^(0^, A). Aside 
from the band-ratio results, the only concentration regime 
with uncertainties below 2.5% is the mesotrophic regime 
(but only for the blue-green wavelengths). 



1.5.6 [Lw]^ 



tbe absence of any atmospheric loss with a zenith sun at 
the mean Earth-sun distance. The latter is accomplished 
by adjusting i?rs(A) with the (time dependent) mean ex- 
traterrestrial solar irradiance, Fo{X,d), which is usually 
formulated to depend on the sequential day of the year 
(SDY), d. 

The intercomparison of normalized water-leaving radi- 
ances for the different processors and data categories is 
presented in Table 11. Because [Lv\/(A)]j^ is calculated 
directly from Rrs{X), the uncertainties for the former are 
expected to follow those of the latter (Table 10). Although 
there is general agreement in the patterns between the 
two, in terms of the spectral shapes and the relationships 
between the analysis categories (e.g., the concentration 
regimes), the magnitude of the uncertainties differ signifi- 
cantly, with the exception of the JG band-ratio results. 

The most likely explanation for the increase in un- 
certainties is in the chosen values for the Fo(A) correc- 
tion term: the JRC processor uses the Neckel and Labs 
(1984) values interpolated to specific center wavelengths 
(Sect. 3.3.2.8), while the GSFC processor uses the Neckel 
and Labs (1984) values weighted by the spectral response 
of the SeaWiFS bands (Sect. 2.4.4). Figure 12 shows the 
relationship between the GSFC and JRC Fo(A) values (the 
GSFC processor does not include a value for 683 nm, be- 
cause this is not a SeaWiFS wavelength). There is a strong 
bias between the two processors with maximum differences 
in the blue (6.5% at 412 nm), intermediate differences in 
the green (3.2%) at 510 nm), and minimum differences in 
the red (1.9% at 665 nm). The band-ratio results for the 
JRC and GSFC intercomparison of Fo(A) are very good — 
the maximum percent difference is 0.4%o. The JG Rrs{X) 
band ratios are all less than 2.5%, so the excellent Fo{X) 
band ratios ensure very good [l/vi/(A)]j^ band ratios.

All of the individual spectral differences in Fig. 12 lie 
o" straight lines, which suggests there is a deterministic, 
at significant, difference in how the Fo(A) terms are cho- 
sen (this is also inferred by the band-ratio results). A 
comparison between the Satlantic and JRC processor is, 
however, somewhat different. The band-ratio results are 
all elevated, the overall average is 2.2%, and the maxi- 
mum individual wavelength differences range from 7.7% at 
412 nm, 3.2% at 510 nm, and 2.8% at 665 nm. When these 
are combined with the Rrs{X) differences, the [Lh/'(A)]j^ 
uncertainties are all larger. Very similar results are seen 
for the Satlantic and GSFC comparisons. 

Very few of the [Lvv^(A)]j^ uncertainties are less than 
2.5%. The only notable exceptions are the JG band-ratio 
results, and a few of the WP results. The range of differ- 
ences is frequently small for the JG results, e.g., the DO, 
SC, WC, and FF results at 412 nm range from 7.0-7.7%, so 
if the Fo(A) calculations can be reconciled, there is every 
reason to believe these uncertainties can be significantly re- 
duced. The latter is only partly true for the Satlantic com- 
parisons, because the i^rs(A) uncertainties were frequently 
large, but there is certainly a chance to improve the WP 
intercomparisons. 

1.5.7 Eu{0') and Qn{0') 

LuiO'.X) and Eu{0~ , X) are related by the Q-factor. 
This permits an alternative approach for the calculation of 
Lvy (A), based on applying the Q-factor to measurements of 
the irradiance reflectance, denoted R{z, A) and defined as 
Eu{z,X)/Ed{z,X). The uncertainties associated with this 
approach are only explored to the extent that intercom- 
parisons of Eu{0~,X), i?(0",A), and (5n(0~,A) are made 
for the JRC and GSFC processors (the Satlantic processor 
does not compute the Q-factor). 

The Eu{0~,X) uncertainties are presented in Table 12. 
The best agreement occurs for the shallow coastal data 
(WP and MN), which have overall uncertainties below 

2.5% in the blue-green part of the spectrum, slightly above 
2.5% in the red domain, and band ratios well below 2.5%. 
The deep ocean data are a mixture of low (LN) and high 
(SO) uncertainties, with universally high values in the red 
wavelengths. The poorer results for SO data are hard to 
explain, because this instrument produces more data per 
unit depth interval than LN. It is interesting to note a 
similar result for the L^,(0", A) results (Table 4), although 
it is not as significant. In comparison, the JG results 
for Ed{0~,X), show the SO uncertainties are substantially 
lower than the LN uncertainties (Table 5). 

The (unexpectedly) larger uncertainty with the SO data 
is the reason the FF category has a smaller average uncer- 
tainty than the WC category, and it produces a clear trend 
of increasing uncertainty with increasing chlorophyll a con- 
centration (the SO data represent a significant portion of 
the ET data, 60% of all casts, as shown in Table 3). This 
is a clear example of how biases in sampling (and then 



processing results) can influence the relationships between 
the different analysis categories. 

The intercomparison results for determining R{X) are 
presented in Table 13. These are necessarily a combination 
of the Eu{0~, A) and £^^(0", A) results, and there is a gen- 
eral elevation in uncertainties, even in the band-ratio re- 
sults. Although the increase in uncertainties is sometimes 
small, there are some notable changes in the relationships 
among the categories: a) the SO results are now lower than 
the LN results, so the WC uncertainties are less than the 
FF uncertainties; and b) the uncertainties as a function of 
concentration regime are more uniform. 

The Q-factor is the ratio between the upwelled irradi- 
ance and radiance, so intercomparisons of Qn(0", A), which 
are presented in Table 14, will be a combination of Ta- 
bles 12 and 4, respectively. The patterns of agreement 
for Qn{0~,X) closely follow the patterns established for 
Eu{0~,X) except there is greater uniformity between the 
instrument types (the WC and FF results are very simi- 
lar), there are much lower uncertainties in the red part of 
the spectrum, and there is less distinction as a function of 
concentration regime (the still anomalously high SO un- 
certainties elevate the ET results). 

Out of all the in-water variables, the overall uncertain- 
ties for Qn(0~, A) are the lowest, and many of the various 
categories of uncertainty are to within 2.5%. This is a 
direct consequence of the two input variables, Lu(0~,A) 
and Eu{0~,X), being upwelled measurements, so they are 
largely free of any surface effects (which raise the uncer- 
tainties in the measurements). 

1.5.8 Ancillary Variables 

Variables not immediately associated with the optical 
fields, but important to the derivation of optical parame- 
ters, plus those variables by which optical parameters are 
evaluated are important to the understanding of a total un- 
certainty budget. Examples of such variables are the solar 
zenith angle, 0^ and the total chlorophyll a concentration 
derived from the OC2v2 algorithm. 

The Satlantic data submission did not include the so- 
lar zenith angle, so only JRC and GSFC 9 values were 
intercompared. For all of the standard (40-cast) data, the 
uncertainty in 6 had an overall average value of 0.7%; the 
minimum-to-maximum differences for these data were 0.0- 
2.3%. For the 10 casts used to extend the standard data 
set, all of which were deep casts in oligotrophic conditions, 
the average uncertainty in was 1.1%, and the minimum- 
to-maximum differences were 0.3-5.0% (most of the vari- 
ance was attributed to slightly different reference times 
used in the computations). 

The intercomparison of the OC2v2 determination of to- 
tal chlorophyll a concentration between the three data pro- 
cessors and with the high performance liquid chromatog- 
raphy (HPLC) determination of total chlorophyll a is pre- 
sented in Table 15. The most obvious result is that the

OC2v2 algorithm does a poor job and this is irrespective 
of the data processor being considered. Nonetheless, there 
are substantial differences between the data types, with 
the winch and crane results proving superior to the cor- 
responding free-fall results, i.e., the SO results are better 
than the LN results, and the WP results are superior to 
the MN results.

It is also clear that the deep ocean results (SO and LN) 
are better than the shallow coastal results (WP and MN). 
This is expected, because the OC2v2 algorithm was formu- 
lated from Case-1 (deep ocean) data (O'Reilly et al. 1998), 
and, in general, is not suitable for coastal waters. The un- 
certainty in the OC2v2 algorithm, based on the original 
data set used to create it, is approximately 30.8%. If the 
AMT data set is used as a separate control to evaluate this 
uncertainty, the uncertainty in the OC2v2 algorithm based 
on the full AMT matrix (not just the data subset used for 
DARR-00) is approximately 34.4% when no filtering for 
possibly spurious observations is applied to the data; if 24 
stations, which appear as outliers are removed from the 
analysis (these usually correspond to unusual phytoplank- 
ton assemblages, highly heterogeneous water masses, etc.), 
the uncertainty is about 30.2%. 

The good agreement between the original uncertainty 
estimated of the OC2v2 algorithm and that achieved with 
the AMT data matrix suggests the large uncertainties seen 
with the SO and LN data in Table 15 are anomalously high 
and a consequence of dealing with a small subsample from 
a much larger database. 

1.5.9 VI Summary 

The standard results are hereafter referred to as the 
VI results, and processing options not in keeping with the 
VI options are referred to as nonstandard. A summary of 
the VI processing uncertainties is presented in Table 16. 
The results are organized according to the primary vari- 
ables and the three concentration regimes. The latter are 
included to investigate whether or not there is any depen- 
dence with respect to chlorophyll a concentration as a func- 
tion of the processing options and, of course, the individ- 
ual variables. It is important to remember the results for 
the concentration regimes are derived from the extended 



(50-cast) data set and only involve the JRC and GSFC 
processors, whereas the individual parameter results are 
from the standard (40-cast) data set and all available pro- 
cessor combinations (the data sets involved are noted in 
the table alongside the two-letter processor codes). The 
principal VI results are as follows (Tables 4-14 and 16): 

1. The smallest uncertainties are associated with the 
JG intercomparisons (which, on average, are signif- 
icantly less than the JS or GS results). 

2. Many of the intercomparisons have maximum un- 
certainties in the red part of the spectrum (665 nm), 
with minimal uncertainties in the blue-green wave- 
lengths (490-510 nm) which increase towards the 
blue domain (412-443 nm). 

3. The band-ratio uncertainties are almost always the 
smallest, and are frequently less than 2.5%). 

4. Most of the uncertainties exceed the 2.5% inter- 
comparison objective, but the JG uncertainties for 
L^,(0"), EdiO^i /^rs, EuiO"), and Qn{0~) are less 
than or close to 2.5% for many of the blue-green 
wavelengths. 

5. The shallow coastal data (in particular the WiS- 
PER data) have smaller uncertainties than the deep 
ocean data (most notably for the red wavelengths). 

6. The winch and crane data (especially the WiSPER 
data) have smaller uncertainties than the free-fall 
data (most notably in the red part of the spectrum). 

7. The uncertainties in the diffuse attenuation coeffi- 
cients, Kl and Kd, exceed the uncertainties in the 
corresponding extrapolated (null depth) radiomet- 
ric measurements, Lu{0~) and Ed{0~), respectively. 

8. As a function of increasing chlorophyll a concentra- 
tion (OT to MT to ET), there is a general increase 
in uncertainties in the blue-green part of the spec- 
trum, but a decrease in the red wavelengths, and 
a decrease in the band-ratio uncertainties (note the 
very large uncertainties for the Kd OT results). 

In addition to following the evolution in the aforemen- 
tioned principal results, the subsequent analyses are con- 
cerned with the following objectives (documented below in 
Sects. 1.6.1-1.6.4): 

a) Determine if results converge (i.e., the uncertainties 
approach zero) as the JRC and GSFC processing 
options are made more similar; 

b) Quantify the level of uncertainty associated with 
the processing options; and 

c) Establish which of the final uncertainties for the 
data products are within the 1.0%o or 2.5% objec- 
tives set at the beginning of the DARR-00 activity. 

As an easily referenced indicator of the convergence pro- 
cess, the final row in Table 16 gives the averages of all the

1.6 RESULTS-NONSTANDARD 

Nonstandard options to the JRC and GSFC processors 
were executed to investigate differences in the VI inter- 
comparison by processing profile data with nonstandard 
options. The results from the subsequent changes to the 
standard processing options are identified as follows: 
V2 For the JRC processor, the only change with re- 
spect to the standard processing options was to 
use the extrapolation intervals for the SeaOPS and 
LoCNESS data as defined by the GSFC processing. 
Similarly, for the GSFC processor, the only change 
was to use the extrapolation intervals for the WiS- 
PER and miniNESS data as defined by the JRC 
processing. No changes were made to the Satlantic 
processing configuration. 
V3 In addition to the V2 changes, no Ed{0^) normal- 
ization was used with the JRC processor (the JRC 
processor still filtered the data for outliers and the 
GSFC processor did not), and the GSFC proces- 
sor used a 5° tilt filter (as did the JRC processor). 
No changes were made to the Satlantic processing 
configuration. 
The JRC and GSFC processors were very similar for the 
V3 configurations — the only difference between the two 
was the JRC processor used outlier filtering and the GSFC 
processor did not (which potentially affects a small amount 
of data in each cast). These options were then used as a 
baseline to explore two different aspects of the processing: 
V4 In addition to the V3 changes, the GSFC processor 
was changed to use a robust linear fit, which weights 
the data in the extrapolation interval to minimize 
the significance of data points with higher variance. 



No changes were made to the Satlantic processing 

configuration. 

V5 In addition to the V3 changes, the GSFC processor 

did not use a tilt filter, and the JRC processor did 

not filter the data for outliers. No changes were 

made to the Satlantic processing configuration. 

A summary of the options used with the GSFC and JRC 

processors for each processing version is given in Table 17. 

1.6.1 V2 Summary 

The only change made for the V2 processing was to use 
the same extrapolation intervals for the JRC and GSFC 
processors. A summary of the effects of this change is 
shown in Table 18. In comparison to the VI results (Ta- 
ble 16), there are substantial improvements in most of the 
JG variables. No changes were made to the Satlantic pro- 
cessor, and the JS and GS uncertainties are largely un- 
changed. The most significant aspects of the improvements 
are the uncertainties are lower at all wavelengths and they 
are spectrally flatter. Given the largest uncertainties for 
the VI results are in the red domain, the largest improve- 
ments with the V2 processing are in the red domain. 

Because the JG values for the V2 results are spec- 
trally more uniform, ^1-5, ^6-7, and ^3/5 are appropriate 
variables for summarizing the improvements derived from 
identical extrapolation intervals (the i symbol represents 
a reduction in uncertainty with respect to the VI values): 

L,(0-) ^i_5 = 0.5(1 1-9)%, <^e-7 - 1.7(111-2)%, and 
^3/5 = 0.1(i 0.8)%; 
Kl ^1-5 = 0.8(i 5.8)%, ^6-7 = 2.0(116.2)%, and 
$3/5 - 0.4(i 2.3)%; 

Ed{0-) ^1-5 - L2(i 2.5)%, ^6-7 

^3/5 - 0.3(i 1.6)%; 

Kd ^1-5 = 3.2(110.3)%, ^6-7 

$3/5 = 1-6(1 6.1)%; 

Ed{0^) ^1-5 - 0.3(i 0.0)%, ^6-7 

^3/5 - 0.1(i 0.0)%; 



= 2.5(1 7.4)%, and 
0.8(i 4.0)%, and 
0.3(i 0.0)%, and

Note the Ed(0'^) uncertainties are the only ones that are 
unchanged. 

In terms of the individual parameters, the largest re- 
ductions are in the red wavelengths, except for the Kd 
values for which the largest change is in the blue-green do- 
main. The majority of the V2 uncertainties are less than 
2.5%, and almost all of the band-ratio uncertainties are 
less than 1.0%. The exceptions are Ed(0') at 683 nm, Kd 
for 412-555 nm, and [i^ivjj,^ for 412-683 nm. This excel- 
lent level of agreement is well summarized by the overall 
JG averages (along the very bottom of Table 18) which 
are all less than 2.5% (note the overall band-ratio average 
is less than 1.0%). The excellent JG uncertainties are a 
result of using the same extrapolation intervals with the 
JRC and GSFC different processors. 

There is still a dependence in the uncertainties as a 
function of the concentration regimes. In general, the JG 
uncertainties decrease with increasing chlorophyll a con- 
centration. Exceptions to this are the i^rs, [^u^]]sjj blue- 
green Ed(0'^), and blue-green Lu(0~) results for which the 
largest uncertainties are associated with the concentration 
regime end points (OT and ET). The Eu(0') and the blue- 
green Qn(0~) results show almost no dependence as a func- 
tion of concentration regime. 

1.6.2 V3 Summary 

The only changes made for the V3 processing with re- 
spect to the V2 processing was to remove the £^^(0"^) nor- 
malization usually used by the JRC processor, and to in- 
clude 5° tilt filtering for the GSFC processor. A summary 
of the effects of these changes is shown in Table 19. In 
comparison to the V2 results (Table 18), there are im- 
provements in most of the JG variables, but they are not as 
substantial as the changes between the VI and V2 results — 
the Satlantic processor was not changed, so the JS and GS 
uncertainties are, again, largely unchanged. 

The most significant aspect of the improvements is the 
the majority of the JG uncertainties are at the 1.0% level 
or less (the ] symbol represents an increase in uncertainty 
with respect to the V2 values):

All of the JG band-ratio uncertainties are below 1.0% — 
in fact, the overall band- ratio average is 0.1%. Almost all 
of the spectral uncertainties are at the 1.0%o level or less, 
except a) the red Ed(0') and R^s values, b) some of the 
blue-green R^s values are at 1.1%, and c) all of the [-^u/]f,j 
values are greater than 2.5%. All of the spectral overall 
averages are at the 1.0% level or less, except at 412 nm for 
which the overall average is 1.2%. 

There are still spectral dependencies in the results, but 
most of these are weak. For example, the difference be- 
tween the maximum and minimum Lu(0~) uncertainty is 
0.3%. Exceptions to this are seen for Ed(0~) and R^s in 
the red domain, and [^vvjjs^ in the blue-green. Overall, 
the difference between the maximum and minimum uncer- 
tainties for 412-683 nm is 0.5%, with most of the difference 
coming from the larger overall uncertainty at 412 nm. 

The convergence of the processors is well quantified by 
considering the average difference in the number of points 
in the extrapolation ranges, ATV, for the JRC and GSFC 
V3 processing of the SO, LN, WP, and MN data (the av- 
erage number of points in the extrapolation range is given 
in parentheses): 

SO AN = 5 (34), 

LN AiV = 3 (61), 

WP AiV = 2 (209), and 

MN A7V - (20). 

Although the AN values are small, the use of identical 
extrapolation ranges and very similar processing options 
does not result in exactly the same number of points in 
the extrapolation interval. The worst case is with Sea- 
OPS, but this is an instrument that is going up and down 
as a result of wave action (acting on the ship) as it is de- 
ployed. The surging motion can occur at an extrapolation 
boundary, and how the processors deal with the addition 
of new data after the boundary is first encountered can 
be different. The best case is with miniNESS data, where

the vertical resolution and extrapolation range are min- 
imized. Between these two, the processors are basically 
differing by one or two points at each extrapolation bound- 
ary. Differences at this level are to be expected, because 
the processors can be using different numerical precision 
in the calculation of depth, absolute or nearest neighbor 
Units can be employed for the boundaries, etc. 

Although there are variables for which the uncertainties 
either increase or decrease with increasing concentration, 
the majority do not show a significant dependence, i.e., 
the difference between the maximum and minimum uncer- 
tainty for the OT, MT, and ET results is usually less than 
1.0%. Notable exceptions are Eci{0^), Rrs, and [l^ivjjs^. 
The Ed{0^) result is associated with maximum uncertain- 
ties in the OT data which are composed solely of deep 
ocean data using unstabihzed references. The R^^ result is 
due to maximal uncertainties in the ET Lu{0~) data and 
the OT ^^(0"^) data. The [Lw]^ result is a consequence 
of the aforementioned differences in the Fo{X) coefficients. 

The DO, SC, WC, and FF partitioning of the V3 JG re- 
sults (using the 50-cast data set) are presented in Fig. 13. 
The dashed Unes set the 2.5% intercomparison objective 
and the dotted hues the 1.0% objective (plotted within 
the 4% uncertainty range achieved with DARR-94, except 
for the normalized water-leaving radiance which has an ex- 
panded scale). In terms of the uncertainty levels, the vari- 
ables can be separated into three groups: the first group is 
composed of variables with uncertainties always less than 
1.0%, i.e., Kl, Eu{0~), and Qn{0~); the second group has 
uncertainties frequently below 1%, with a few wavelengths 
slightly above 1%, i.e., L^(O-), £^(0"), Kd, Ed{0^), and 
R{0~); and the third group has uncertainties persistently 
above 1%, and even 2.5%, i.e., Rrs and [^Vi/j^- 

The uncertainties within the first group are so small 
and so similar, the differences within the various categories 
are probably not significant. There are, however, two no- 
table results associated with this group: a) the largest un- 
certainties are in the red wavelengths, and b) the Q^-factor 
is the only multivariate (i.e., normalized) parameter with 
uncertainties persistently below the 1.0% level. 

Within the second group, the differences between the 
various categories are more substantial: a) the shallow 
coastal data usually have lower uncertainties than the deep 
ocean data; b) the free-fall data usually have lower uncer- 
tainties than the winch and crane data; and c) the SC and 
FF Ln(0"), Ed{0~), EdiO""), and i?(0") uncertainties are 
always less than 1.0% (even though the corresponding DO 
and WC values are not). 

The third group is important, because it consists of 
parameters central to cahbration and vahdation activities, 
[Lw]^ and i^rs, respectively. Unfortunately, both vari- 
ables are associated with the largest uncertainties. The 
normalized water-leaving radiances have large uncertain- 
ties, because of the differences in Fo(A), as discussed in 
Sect. 1.5.6, The Rrs uncertainties are only large for the 
DO and WC categories— the SC uncertainties are always 



less than 1.0%, and the FF uncertainties are less than 1.0% 
in the blue-green domain (including the band-ratio value). 

There is also a general result supported by all three 
groups: the SC and FF uncertainties are less than the DO 
and WC values, respectively. The lower uncertainties with 
the SC data are a consequence of comparatively higher 
uncertainties for the SO data. The processing uncertainties 
for the JG (40-cast) data sets organized according to the 
four instrument types, are presented in Table 20 along with 
samples of the SO and LN uncertainties for the 50-cast 
data set. These samples show the differences between the 
two data sets for the SO and LN results are small and the 
general properties of the data (e.g., spectral dependence, 
overall averages, band ratios, etc.) are similar. 

For the L^(O-), EdiO'), Rrs, £u(0"), and Qn(0") vari- 
ables, SO uncertainties are significantly larger than the 
LN, WP, and MN uncertainties. If the SO uncertainties 
are ignored, the latter three usually agree to within 0.5% 
(except for the red Rrs wavelengths). 

The Kl, EdiO""), [Lw]^, and R{0^) uncertainties in 
Table 20 do not show any significant dependence as a func- 
tion of the instrument type. Interestingly, the SO K^ un- 
certainties are not distinguishable from the other instru- 
ment types even though the SO Lu{0') uncertainties are. 
The low Ed{0'^) uncertainties suggest the difference be- 
tween stabilized and unstabihzed references does not effect 
the processing uncertainties (when the processing options 
are made similar). The [Lw]^ uncertainties do not show 
a strong sensitivity to instrument type, but the smallest 
values are usually associated with the LN data. In com- 
parison, the ^(0"^) uncertainties also do not show a strong 
sensitivity to instrument type, but the largest values are 
usually associated with the LN data. 

As was seen with the Kl and Lu{0~) data, the Kd 
uncertainties do not follow the instrument dependence for 
Ed{0~): the largest Kd uncertainties are associated with 
the WP data, wherea^s the largest £^^(0') uncertainties are 
for the SO data. Given the direct importance of the atten- 
uation coefficients in determining the extrapolated (null 
depth) values, it is interesting that the uncertainties for 
the two are not always commensurate. As with the VI 
and V2 results, the Kd uncertainties in the red domain are 
significantly smaller than the blue-green uncertainties. 

The effect of processor convergence on the intercom- 
parison of the OC2v2 determination of total chlorophyll a 
between the JRC and GSFC data processors is as follows: 

SO 2.7%, 
LN 7.0%, 
WP 5.2%, and 
MN 7.2%, 
with an overall average of 5.5%. These are very similar to 
the VI results (Table 15), so even though the intercompar- 
ison of many of the primary optical variables has improved 
significantly, the net effect on the derived (OC2v2) chloro- 
phyll concentration is minimal. For comparison purposes.

the JS and GS average uncertainties for the OC2v2 in- 
tercomparison are 12.2 and 14.2%, respectively, which are 
very similar to the VI results. 

1.6.3 V4 Summary 

The only change made for the V4 processing with re- 
spect to the V3 processing was to use a robust hnear fit for 
the GSFC processor. The robust linear fit weights the data 
in the extrapolation interval to minimize the significance of 
data points with higher variance, which acts as a mild form 
of outlier rejection. The effects of this change are presented 
in Table 21. In comparison to the very low uncertainties 
achieved with the V3 results (Table 19), there are com- 
paratively large increases in the uncertainties of the JG 
variables — the Satlantic processor was not changed, so the 
JS and GS uncertainties are, again, largely unchanged. 

The most significant aspect of the change in uncertain- 
ties for the V4 processing is the majority of the JG ujicer- 
tainties are no longer at the 1.0% level or less, although 
many are to within 2.5%):

The Rrs and [Lw]^ uncertainties are not very differ- 
ent in terms of the percent increase of the V4 results with 
respect to the V3 results. The Ed{0'') uncertainties are 
unchanged, because there is nothing in the robust linear 
fitting that can influence the calculation of Ed{0^)- The 
i^rs and [Lw]^ are not strongly altered (from a percent 
change point of view), because the normalizing variable, 
Ed{0'^), is unchanged, and the absolute increases in the 
Lu{0 ) uncertainties are proportionately smaller, particu- 
larly for [i^wj^- 

Although the JG L^(0") and Kl uncertainties show 
similar increases, the increases in the Ed{0~) and Kd un- 
certainties are considerably different. This shows the type 



of fit is sensitive to the amount of noise in the data — the 
EdiO~) data are noisier than the Lu{0~) data, because of 
wave focusing effects. This can also be seen in the con- 
centration regime data. The L^(O') uncertainties do not 
show a clear trend as a function of concentration, but the 
EdiO~) uncertainties decrease as concentration increases. 

In most cases, the band-ratio uncertainties are much 
less than the spectral uncertainties, and most are less than 
1.0%. The notable exception is the Kd results for which 
the band-ratio uncertainty is very large and responsible for 
increasing the overall band-ratio uncertainty above 1.0% 
(but still within 2.5%). The latter is caused by the signif- 
icantly larger Kd uncertainties in the blue-green domain. 

The sensitivity of the primary variables to chlorophyll a 
concentration is a mixture of increasing and decreasing un- 
certainties as a function of increasing concentration. Per- 
haps the most significant results in this regard are the very 
large Kd uncertainties in the OT and even the MT regimes. 
This points to the difficulty of estimating the slope of the 
log-transformed light data in clear waters where surface 
effects add a considerable amount of noise to the data. 

1.6.4 V5 Summary 

The primary purpose of the V5 processing configura- 
tion wats to investigate the importance of filtering on the 
uncertainties, so the GSFC processor was set to its usual 
configuration (no tilt filtering and no outlier filtering), and 
the JRC processor was changed slightly: tilt filtering was 
enabled (as usual), but outlier filtering was disabled (usu- 
ally outlier filtering was enabled). A summary of the pro- 
cessing options is given in Table 17, and the effects of the 
V5 changes is shown in Table 22. In comparison to the V3 
results (Table 19), there are increases in uncertainties for 
most of the JG variables, but they are not as substantial 
as the changes seen with the V4 results (Table 21) — the 
Satlantic processor was not modified, so the JS and GS 
uncertainties remain largely unchanged. 

The most significant aspect of the change in uncertain- 
ties for the V5 processing with respect to the V3 processing 
is there is an overall increase in uncertainty values, but the 
majority of the JG uncertciinties for the blue-green wave- 
lengths are within, or close to, the 1.0% level, and most of 
the uncertainties in the red domain are less than 2.5%:

AH JG ^1-5 - 1.4(T 0.5)%, ^6-7 - 1-9(T 0.9)%, and 
^3/5 - 0.4(T 0.3)%. 

Note that in many cases, the increases in uncertainties 
due to filtering differences is approximately one half (or 
more) of the uncertainty levels achieved when the proces- 
sors were the most similar (V3). 

As was seen with the V4 and V3 comparisons, the V5 
Erf(0'^), Rrs', and [^w]^^ uncertainties are very similar to 
the V3 results, particularly in terms of the percent in- 
creases of the V5 results with respect to the V3 results. 
Again, the £^^(0"^) uncertainties are actually unchanged, 
and the R^s and [l^u/jj^r are not strongly altered (from 
a percent change point of view), because the normalizing 
variable, E,i(0"^), is unchanged, and the absolute increases 
in the Lu{0~) uncertainties are proportionately smaller, 
particularly for [^U/'j^^- 

The Ki uncertainties are similar to the Z/^(0~) un- 
certainties, both in magnitude and spectral dependence. 
The Kd uncertainties are larger than the £^^(0") uncer- 
tainty values, and have an inverted spectral dependence, 
i.e., when one is maximal, the other is minimal. With the 
exception of the Kd results, the band-ratio uncertainties 
are much less than the spectral uncertainties, and always 
less than 1.0%. 

1.7 DISCUSSION 

The most significant changes in the application of the 
various JRC and GSFC processing options occur from the 
progression from the VI, V2, and then V3 options. A 
summary of the evolution in uncertainties for the primary 
intercomparison variables is shown in Fig. 14 (the dashed 
and dotted hues set the 2.5% and 1.0% intercomparison 
objectives, respectively). The figure shows a significant 
reduction in processing uncertainties as a function of the 
processing versions (VI to V3) except for the Ed{0^) and 
[Lw(A)]^, variables. The former are small to begin with 
and stay small, and the latter are large to begin with and 
stay large. Another exception is some of the band-ratio 
results. The L^(O'), i^^s, [LwW]^. and Eu{0~) band- 
ratio uncertainties are less than 1.0% for the VI processing 
and remain so up through the V3 processing. 

Other aspects to note from Fig. 14 are as follows: 
1. The most significant improvement is seen in the red 
wavelengths, except for Kd which has the largest 
improvement in the blue-green domain; 



2. All of the uncertainties are reduced to within 1.0% 
for the V3 processing except for the Ed{0~) red 
wavelengths, all the [L\y(A)]^, values, and the R^^ 
values in the red domain; 

3. In terms of overall averages, the 1.0%o objective is 
achieved at all wavelengths except at 412 nm which 
is slightly above 1.0%o; and 

4. The largest improvement occurs for the VI to V2 
progression, i.e., making the extrapolation ranges 
the same has the strongest influence in reducing 
processing uncertainties. 

The uncertainties of the three processors based on the 
V3 processing of four of the most important primary vari- 
ables are presented in Fig. 15. The L^.(0") results (Fig. 15a) 
show the lowest uncertainties with the Satlantic proces- 
sor are for the shallow coastal data, and in all cases, the 
largest uncertainties are for the red wavelengths — none of 
the Satlantic uncertainties are below 1.0%., although, the 
blue-green WiSPER wavelengths are within 2.5%. The av- 
erage band-ratio uncertainty, ^3/5 ^ for both Satlantic in- 
tercomparisons are, however, below 2.5% (Table 19). The 
JG uncertainties are always below 2.5%, and mostly below 
1.0%o except for the blue and red SeaOPS data. The Kd un- 
certainties (Fig. 15b) show much higher overall uncertain- 
ties with respect to the Satlantic processor, particularly 
for the LoCNESS data set where every wavelength has an 
uncertainty above 25%. None of the Satlantic uncertain- 
ties are below 2.5%, whereas all of the JG uncertainties 
are, and most of the JG uncertainties are to within 1.0% 
(the primary exception are the WiSPER data). 

The ii^rs uncertainties (Fig. 15c) are similar to the 
Lu{0~) results, especially for the Satlantic intercompar- 
isons. The lowest uncertainties with the Satlantic proces- 
sor are for the shallow coastal data, and in all cases, the 
largest uncertainties are for the red wavelengths — none of 
the Satlantic uncertainties are below 1.0%, although, the 
blue-green WiSPER wavelengths are within 2.5%. Again, 
the overall band-ratio results are much improved and are 
a little larger than 2.5% (Table 19). Almost all of the JG 
uncertainties are below 2.5% (except for red deep ocean 
wavelengths), and the majority of the uncertainties are be- 
low 1.0% (all of the shallow coastal wavelengths are within 
1.0%). 

In terms of the identified processing configurations, the 
JRC and GSFC processors were the most similar for the V3 
options, and the minimum uncertainties, both individually 
and from an overall perspective, were seen with the V3 
results. 

The V4 processing results show the type of fit used to 
estimate the slope of the log-transformed data in the ex- 
trapolation interval is correlated with the amount of noise 
in the data, thus, the noisier Ed{0~) data (from wave fo- 
cusing effects) are more sensitive to the extrapolation pro- 
cess. This can also be seen in the concentration regime

data, wherein the Ed{0~) uncertainties normally increase 
as the chlorophyll concentration decreases. 

The V5 results show that differences in filtering tech- 
niques can account for a significant percentage of the un- 
certainty budgets. In nnany cases, the increases in uncer- 
tainties due to filtering differences was approximately one 
half (or more) of the uncertainty levels achieved when the 
processors were the most similar (V3). 

The overall sensitivity of the primary variables to chlo- 
rophyll a concentration depends primarily on the process- 
ing options. As the JG processors converged, any depen- 
dence on concentration weakened except for the aforemen- 
tioned larger Kd uncertainties in clear waters (the OT and 
even the MT regimes). 

In most instances, the band-ratio uncertainties are 
much less than the spectral uncertainties. Furthermore, 
once the processors were made more similar (i.e., con- 
verged), almost all of the band-ratio uncertainties were 
less than 1.0%. The largest band-ratio uncertainties are 
associated with the Kd results, which are maximal in the 
blue-green wavelength domain. 

1.8 CONCLUSIONS 

From the strict point of view of data processing, the 
most obvious conclusion from this study is that when sep- 
arate groups process data in ways they consider appropri- 
ate, this can lead to unacceptable uncertainties (greater 
than 2.5%) in the final products used for calibration and 
validation activities. Although in situ data are probably 
the best approach for vicarious calibrations, it is important 
to note the uncertainties associated with the products de- 
rived from in situ data can be relatively high if different 
data processors are used. 



There are several other aspects of this study that are 
relevant to calibration and validation activities: 

1. The persistently lower Lu{0~) uncertainties with re- 
spect to the [Lu/(A)]^ uncertainties suggest the 
validation of satellite radiometric data and the vi- 
carious calibration of space sensors might be best 
accomplished with LwW data collected at a time 
very close to the satellite overpass (which may be 
used without any normalization). 

2. Although a database constructed with processed 
data from a wide source of contributors will have 
substantially higher uncertainties than a database 
constructed with raw data processed with a single 
processor, the OC2v2 results are not very depen- 
dent on the processing options, because band ratios 
regularly provide reduced uncertainties with respect 
to individual spectral uncertainties. 

3. Data sets for mean Fo(A) used in the computation of 
[Lh/(A)]^ should be chosen in agreement with those 
used for satellite data processing to remove system- 
atic uncertainties in vicarious calibrations and in 
product validations. 

4. Because of the large uncertainties associated with 
the selection of extrapolation intervals, techniques 
should be developed to support the objective selec- 
tion of the limits for extrapolation intervals, as an 
attempt to standardize the selection of parameters 
used for the determination of subsurface values. 

5. Data collection fromi stabilized (i.e., fixed or gim- 
baled) platforms should be emphasized, and the ver- 
tical resolution of the in-water instruments should 
be maximized (either with a low descent speed or a 
high data rate).

Abstract 

The GSFC data processing system was designed to calculate apparent optical properties from underwater profiles 
of upward and downward irradiance, as well as upwelling radiance, from a wide variety of open ocean regimes. 
The full processing involves three steps: a) the calibration of the data, b) the establishment of the extrapolation 
interval, and c) the derivation of the final data products. In the first step, special files containing dark voltages 
are used to remove detector offsets and apply a pressure tare to the depth sensor. The second step is done 
interactively while viewing all the optical and ancillary (sensor tilts, fluorescence, etc.) fields. The final step is 
usually executed in batch mode using a file of extrapolation limits created in the second step. All of the code 
is written in the IDL programming environment. 



2.1 INTRODUCTION 

The GSFC processing software was developed to sup- 
port the activities of the SeaWiFS Field Team whose main 
objectives are a) the vicarious calibration of the space- 
borne sensor, b) the validation of the algorithms used to 
generate the SeaWiFS data products, and c) the evalu- 
ation of the instruments and protocols used for in-water 
radiometric measurements. Between September 1995 and 
April 1999, most of the field campaigns conducted by the 
SeaWiFS Field Team were performed during AMT cruises 
(Aiken et al. 2000). The codes described here were initially 
developed to process the AMT radiometric data for Sea- 
WiFS cahbration and validation purposes. The processing 
system was designed to produce, in near-real time, all the 
quantities (direct or indirect) that can be derived from ra- 
diance or irradiance optical profiles conducted in the water 
column. 

During the AMT cruises, the SeaWiFS Field Team de- 
ployed a variety of commercial and prototype optical sam- 
pling systems built by Satlantic, Inc. These instruments 
included winch and crane, as well as free-fall deployment 
platforms, with 2 or 3 optical sensors on each system, and 
7 or 13 channels in each sensor. The former are capable 
of sampling the closest to the surface (especially during 
the up cast when the instruments are emerging from the 
mostly undisturbed deep part of the cast), and the sensors 
are located at very nearly the same depth; the latter cannot 



return near-surface measurements for all sensors because 
of the tilting of the profiler during its initial righting pe- 
riod immediately after release, and the sensors at each end 
of the profiler are usually separated from one another by a 
vertical distance of approximately 1-2 m. The primary wa- 
ter type sampled during the AMT cruises was clear, deep 
ocean, Case-1 conditions, although a large range (approx- 
imately three decades) in chlorophyll a concentrations was 
sampled a^fter six cruises. 

The diversity in sampling equipment, a preponderance 
of deep casts (as much as 200 m) in clear water (Case-1 
conditions), the availability of coincident solar reference 
data, and the high quality of the in-water data were the 
governing forces behind the design of the GSFC processor. 
There was no need for a self-shading correction capability, 
a bottom correction scheme, or any other data handling 
requirements usually associated with the coastal (predom- 
inantly Case-2) environment, so these were not included as 
processing options. 

For the sake of eflficiency, the same core of code was 
adapted for all instruments and configurations, which also 
share a variety of utility programs. The processing code is 
written in IDL and has three main components: 

■ A calibration module for the conversion of the raw 
data (counts) to physical units, which also generates 
an ASCII file containing the calibrated data for each 
cast plus a vertically binned file;

■ A visualization module that plots the various data 
fields as a function of depth; and 

■ A module that generates the surface values, that is, 
it extrapolates the underwater data to the surface 
and computes quantities relevant to ocean color and 
marine optics studies. 

For the DARR-00 exercise, some minor modifications were 
made to the codes, so the processing system could handle 
the formats of the JRC data. 

2.2 DATA COLLECTION 

The emphasis during SeaWiFS Field Team deployments 
is to use instruments with absolute calibrations, traceable 
to the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST), and state-of-the art sampling and optical mea- 
surement protocols. For each deployment, every effort is 
made to hmit, as much as possible, experimental (ship 
shadow, superstructure reflections, instrument instability, 
etc.) and environmental (sea and sky state) perturbations 
in the measurements. Under most circumstances, the data 
were collected in Case-1 waters (Morel and Prieur 1977) 
during stable sky conditions. To ensure a full optical char- 
acterization of the euphotic zone, the profiles were usually 
deployed to a depth that included the 1.0% light level and 
the deep chlorophyll maximum. 

For each cast, two instruments are used: one collects 
the in-water data in the euphotic zone as a profiling sys- 
tem, and the second one simultaneously records the above- 
water incident solar irradiance. The free-fall profiling sys- 
tems are deployed far enough from the ship to avoid ship 
perturbations, the winch system uses a crane with suffi- 
cient reach over the side of the ship to significantly re- 
duce contamination of the in-water data from ship per- 
turbations, and for both systems, the surface reference is 
installed in a location chosen to minimize the possible in- 
fluence of the ship's superstructure. 

In addition to the in situ measurements, dark signals 
are recorded at least once a day for all light sensors. Dark 
levels for sensors are generally recorded for 3 min before or 
after a series of in-water profiles. While on deck, the pro- 
filer is kept under a white sheet that is regularly rinsed off 
to ensure the temperature is more similar to that encoun- 
tered during sampling. The dark data for the pressure 
sensor is also used as a pressure tare to ensure accurate 
depth readings during the in-water cast. 

The radiometric measurements always include the a) 
upwelled radiance, Lu{z,X)] b) downward irradiance, 
Ed{z,X)] and c) incident total (direct plus diffuse) solar 
irradiance, Ed{0^,X)- For most cruises, a third sensor is 
used to measure the upward irradiance, Eu{z,X). Ancil- 
lary in-water measurements are used to ensure the quality 
of the data or to understand the light measurements in 
terms of the basic water column properties. These extra 
measurements include the two- axis tilts of the sensor, flu- 
orescence, plus water temperature and conductivity. 



2.3 DATA FORMAT 

The SeaWiFS Field Team has developed its own data 
acquisition software, so the format of the raw data are 
different from that of the optical equipment manufacturer. 
The raw data (profile, surface reference, and dark measure- 
ments) are stored in ASCII, tab-delimited files composed of 
a header section followed by a line-by-line data block con- 
taining the digitized measurements (Fig. 16). Keywords 
are used at the start of each header entry which are termi- 
nated with the at-sign ((9). This architecture follows the 
design used with SeaBASS, which is the primary in situ 
database for the SeaWiFS Project (Hooker et al. 1994). 

The header section includes a number of values associ- 
ated with the configuration of the data acquisition module, 
the so-called DATA- 100, plus a variety of entries which 
identify the optical sensors used, experimental informa- 
tion, calibration documentation, etc. Note the use of an 
explicitly decoded Gregorian date — the month is spelled 
out — to prevent any time confusion. The data block be- 
gins with a header line and is followed by the sequentially 
numbered data lines. Explicit keywords for the beginning 
and ending of the data block are not needed, because it 
starts after the /endJieaderO keyword, and ends with the 
(platform-dependent) end-of-file (EOF) character. 

A data line begins with a sequential record number 
and a Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) time stamp based on 
the SDY. The format for the latter is yyyy dddhhmmss. ss, 
where yyyy is the year, ddd is the SDY, hh is the (24-hour) 
hour of the day, mm is the minutes of the hour, and ss . ss 
is the seconds of the minute (to within 0.01s). The digi- 
tized sensor counts appear ajpter the time stamp, which are 
followed by three quality control variables: Frame count 
is a sequential (circular) counter provided by the analog- 
to-digital converter unit, Checksum, and BadChecks\im pa- 
rameters. 

2.4 PROCESSING STEPS 

For most applications, the raw data are considered as 
the lowest level, the so-called level'O data. The basic archi- 
tecture of the GSFC processor is to convert these data to 
calibrated values, the so-called levehl data. The level-1 
data are then used to calculate the final data products. 
Typically, four raw data files are used to process a cast: the 
in-water data, the solar reference data, the dark measure- 
ments of the in-water profiler, and the dark measurements 
of the surface reference for that cast or station. 

2.4.1 Data Conversion 

The first step of the GSFC data processing system is 
the transformation of the raw data into physical units for 
all measured parameters. For each parameter, the stability 
of the dark measurements is controlled (coefficient of vari- 
ation, i.e., standard deviation divided by the mean, less 
than 0.01% for the radiometric data) and the mean dark

value is computed. The calibration files for each of the 
sensors involved in a particular instrument are read, and 
the relevant calibration coefficients are extracted. 

The raw data are converted to physical units based on 
a formulation given by the manufacturer of the sensor. For 
example, the zth sample for a radiometric sensor at center 
wavelength A, are converted to physical units according to 
the following equation: 



e5(A,tO = C,{\)Is{\)[V{\,U) - D(A)],

cessor, for which is replaced by Ed{z), Eu{z), Lu{z), 
or Eci{0'^); C'c(A) is the calibration coefficient; //(A) is the 
immersion factorj; V{X,ti) is the raw voltage (in digital 
counts) measured by the instrument at time t^ (which also

sets the depth, 2); and D{X) is the average dark value (in 
digital counts) measured during a special dark cast with 
the caps on the radiometer. 

Of the ancillary data available with the SeaOPS and 
LoCNESS profiling systems, the tilt of the profiler with 
respect to the vertical, (/?, is important in ensuring the 
quality of the optical data: 

(fi — tan"-^ Wtan^(/?^ -h tan^ (/?^ (5) 

where (p^ and (fy are the x- and y-axis tilts, respectively, 
with respect to the vertical coordinate. 

The dark calculations and the transformation into phys- 
ical units are done for the profiler and the reference suc- 
cessively. The two calibrated data sets are then combined 
into a unique ASCII file. The matchup between the in- 
water and reference data are based on the time stamp of 
each sensor record which must agree within a time interval, 
St, defined by the user. The default value for St is set for 



48

an agreement of less than 0.1 s. This vakie is based on the 
samphng frequency of the hght sensors which is 6 Hz, thus, 
each sample is generated and acquired within 167 ms, so 
a 6t value of 0.1 s is approximately one-half the sampling 
interval. 

An ASCII file containing the entire (unbinned) profile 
is then generated. It includes depth, radiometric measure- 
ments from the profiler and the reference, and all other 
available ancillary data. With the exception of the tempo- 
ral match-up filter between the in-water and surface ref- 
erence data, no other filtering is applied to the unbinned 
level -1 data. After the combined (unbinned) file is com- 
pleted, a vertically binned file is also generated. The ver- 
tical bin size, 6z, is defined by the user (the default value 
for 6z is 1 m). For this binned file, filtering of the data can 
be applied based on the two-axis tilts of the instruments 
during the cast. Threshold values for these angles can be 
set by the user resulting in the rejection of the data line if 
the threshold value is exceeded (the default tilt threshold 
is 10°). 

2.4.2 Data Visualization 

Although the profiles can be optionally displayed dur- 
ing the calibration step, the GSFC processing system has 
a specific data visualization module that allows the cali- 
brated data to be plotted for whatever depth range the 
user specifies. The default graphic window displays six 
panels: 1) the Lu{z,X) profile, 2) the Ed{z,X) profile, 3) 
the Ed{0'^, A) data (plotted as a function of time, but cor- 
related with the corresponding in-water measurements), 
4) the two-axis tilt profiles, 5) the temperature and con- 
ductivity profiles, and, 6) the fiuorescence profile. Other 
combinations of plots are possible and user definable. 

The visualization module permits a visual inspection 
of all the measured parameters. Because the data can be 
displayed for any desired depth interval, the visualization 
module is very useful for defining what depth range should 
be used to perform subsurface e^xtrapolations to the sur- 
face, which is required to determine the values of some 
parameters at null depth, 2 = 0". In the GSFC processing 
system, the selection of these depth ranges by the data an- 
alyst is a necessary step before any extrapolations can be 
achieved — there is no automated method for such a selec- 
tion. 

The selection of the data is based on the examination of 
the upper part of the profile (0 to 5-30 m depending on the 
clarity of the water). The data analyst selects the depth 
range to be used in the extrapolations (defined by an upper 
and a lower depth threshold) based on the characteristics 
of the radiometric and ancillary data. The stability of the 
^rf(0"^, A) data (no clouds or other perturbations), the lin- 
earity of the Lu{z,X) data (in semi-log space), two-axis 
tilts, the characteristics of the mixed-layei depth, and the 
features of the fluorescence profile are all taken into ac- 
count in that selection. There is some obvious subjectivity 



in this part of the process, because two different analysts 
might interpret the profiles in different ways, which would 
probably result in different depth threshold selections. 

A completely objective or automated procedure in the 
depth selection process is almost impossible to achieve and, 
in any case, is not considered desireable for two reasons: 
a) in the vicarious calibration process, each in situ ob- 
servation is potentially very precious, because only a few 
matchups are usually derived from each week of field work 
(Hooker and McClain 2000), so each cast must be pro- 
cessed to the highest standard possible; and b) automated 
procedures tend to produce biases or nonstochastic offsets 
in the data, which would add an unnatural variance to the 
algorithm validation database. 

Generally, the data in the first 1-2 m below the surface 
cannot be safely used, because of excessive sensor tilts and 
surface contamination effects (bubbles, foam, wave focus- 
ing, etc.). When correctly trimmed, free-fall profilers gen- 
erally reach their vertical stability after 1-2 m of descent. 
Aside from the characteristics of the Eci{0'^ , X) data, the 
lower depth to be used in the extrapolation range depends 
mostly on the clarity of the water. In clear water, the lower 
hmit can be as deep as 20 m, while in more turbid waters, 
this limit can be very shallow (less than 4m). 

One limitation of the GSFC data processing system 
is that it was not designed to generate accurate results for 
wavelengths which are strongly influenced by water absorp- 
tion (i.e., A > 570 nm). When water absorption is strong, 
the red bands require very specific, and generally very shal- 
low, depth ranges for the extrapolations to be meaningful. 
Because the SeaWiFS validation effort was initially focused 
on the first five SeaWiFS bands, no specific processing was 
developed for the red channels. Furthermore, as good data 
are generally collected once the L^ sensor is 2-3 m deep in 
the water column, this may frequently be too deep to al- 
low a relevant extrapolation of the red channels. The null 
depth values of the red channels are, therefore, acknowl- 
edged to be less accurate than the blue and green bands. 

2.4.3 In- Water Data Products 

Once the depths for the extrapolation intervals have 
been selected, the values at null depth are calculated for 
the L^,(z,A), Eu{z,X), and Ediz^X) data. This step also 
involves the computation of various other derived param- 
eters above or beneath the sea surface interface. These 
parameters, and how they are calculated, are described 
below. 

The first step of the in-- water computations consists of 
a series of regression calculations performed, at each wave- 
length, between the depth (corrected for any difference 
between the position of the pressure sensor and that of 
the individual light sensors) and the log-transformed (nat- 
ural logs) radiometric data. These regressions generate 
the L^,(0",A), Ed{0~,X), and Eu{0~,X) values, as well as 
the diffuse attenuation coeflficients for the subsurface re- 
gion (the extrapolation range): a) downward irradiance.

The slope of the regression provides the diffuse atten- 
uation coefficients, while the exponential of the intercept 
gives the Ly{0~, A), Ed{0~ , A), and £^^,,(0", A) values. By de- 
fault, the processing program uses a classic least-squares 
method for the regressions, but a robust least absolute de- 
viation method (Press et al. 1992). can also be used. For 
the latter, possible outliers (noisy points with a larger vari- 
ance) have a reduced weight in the analysis.

puted as

2.4.4 Above- Water Data Products 



The Ly,{0~ , X) value is transmitted through the sea sur- 
face to derive the upwelled radiance leaving the sea surface, 
the so-called water-ieaving radiance, Lvv(A), according to 

Austin (1974):

where p{X./d) is the Fresnel surface reflectance at the i) 
nadir angle and ny;{X) is the refractive index of seawater 
(all the in-water instruments use nadir- viewing radiance 
sensors for which vl — 0°). 

Except for a very rough sea surface or a high sun zenith 
angle, the transmission term in (8), (l - p{X,d))n~^{X), 
varies only slightly in magnitude and wavelength (Austin 
1980). The coefficient 0.54 has been shown (Mobley 1999) 
to be appropriate under most situations for transmitting 
the normal radiance from below, to above, the sea surface 
(Mobley 1999), so (8) is rewritten as: 



LwW = 0.54L,(0-,A). 



(9) 



The only directly measured above-water parameter is 
the incident solar irradiance. The stability of the light 
field for the time period matching the chosen extrapo- 
lation range is characterized by the coefficient of varia- 
tion in the corresponding ^(^(O^.A) values. The spectral 
means of the £^^(0"*", A) values for the extrapolation time 
period, Ed{^'^ , A), are used for the normalization of Lw{X) 
which results in a quantity, the remote-sensing reflectance, 



Another commonly used quantity is the normalized 
water- leaving radiance defined for in situ measurements 
as: 

[Lw{\% = Fo(A)i?,,(A), (11) 

where Fq is the mean extraterrestrial solar irradiance cor- 
rected for the Earth-sun distance which depends on the 
SDY, d. i.e.. Fq = Fo{X)do{d). The Earth-sun distance 
correction is computed as 



^'o(^) 



1.0 -f 0.0167COS 



27i(d - 3) 
365 



(12) 



The Fo(A) values used with the GSFC processor are in- 
terpolated from the Neckel and Labs (1984) data set, but 
weighted by the spectral response of the SeaWiFS bands. 

2.4.5 Ancillary Data Products 

The extrapolation module also calculates several other 
parameters: 

1. The solar zenith angle (computed from the average 
time measured during the extrapolation interval): 

2. The thickness of the mixed- layer depth (as deter- 
mined by a drop of 0.1°C in four consecutive Im 
depth bins) and the mean mixed-layer depth tem- 
perature: 

3. The surface PAR values; 

4. The depths of the 10%, 1%, and 0.1% surface PAR 
values; 

5. The depth of the chlorophyll maximum (determined 
from the fluorescence profile); and 

6. The surface chlorophyll a concentration as estimated 
by the 0C2 and 0C4 algorithms. 

For any particular cruise or experiment, the surface data 
and other derived quantities are saved in ASCII files. 

2.5 SUMMARY 

The GSFC data processing system has been developed 
to analyze the radiometric and ancillary data collected for 
calibration and validation purposes by the SeaWiFS Field 
Team. The processor includes 3 major steps: a) the conver- 
sion of the raw data to (calibrated) physical units, b) the 
visualization of the calibrated data and, c) the calculation 
of the surface values for ocean color quantities and other 
ancillary data. The codes can process data collected by 
Satlantic OCR-200, OCI-200, OCR-1000, and OCMOOO 
sensors. Several options can be selected throughout the

Abstract 



The JRC Data Processor was developed for the analysis of field ciata collected in coastal and marine regions 
in support of ocean color calibration and validation activities. The code specifically supports the calibration, 
formatting, visualization, and processing of in-water optical profiles of L^iz, A), Eci{z, A), and Eu{z, A) collected 
with the Satlantic seven-channel OCR-200 and OCT200 sensor series. The user can define a variety of options 
which permit the selection of the extrapolation interval for the computation of the near-surface values, and 
the removal of outliers through statistical filtering. Relevant features include the possibility to minimize mea- 
surement perturbations such as instrument self shading, bottom effects, and superstructure shading (although 
the latter is restricted to measurements performed at the Acqua Alia Oceanographic Tower site in the northern 
Adriatic Sea). Each step of the processing is supported by the graphic presentation of intermediate results. Out- 
put products are the subsurface values Lti(0",A), £'d(0~^A), and Eu{0~,X)\ the diffuse attenuation coefficients 
Kd{X), A'l(A), and /C^,(A): plus the derived products i?(0", A), i^rs(A), [Lvv(A)]^^, and Qn(0", A). 



3,1 INTRODUCTION 

The JRC Data Processor is a comprehensive software 
package for field data analysis. It was developed within 
the Coastal Atmosphere and Sea Time-Series (CoASTS) 
project (Zibordi et al. 2001) to support ocean color cal- 
ibration and validation activities. The processor ensures 
handling of marine and atmospheric measurements and, 
specifically, the analysis of in-water optical profile data. 

An important feature of the processor is the capabil- 
ity for removing measurement perturbations, like instru- 
ment self shading, bottom effects, and tower shading [the 
latter correction is specific to data collected at the Acqua 
Alta Oceanographic Tower site (Zibordi et al. 2001)] . This 
makes the code well suited for the processing of oceanic, as 
well as coastal, data. The processor is composed of a data 
calibration and formatting program plus a data filtering 
and processing program, and uses a graphical user inter- 
face (GUI) to interactively define the processing settings. 

The data calibration and formatting program has five 
main functions: 

1. Ingestion of ASCII raw (i.e., level -0) data in differ- 
ent formats; 

2. Calibration of the data, including dark correction 
for light sensors and pressure tare for depth sensors: 



3. Screening of data as a function of a user-selectable 
tilt threshold; 

4. Visualization of data as a function of depth; and 

5. Creation of the level-1 (output) data files. 

The DARR-00 exercise also required the implementation of 
specific routines for ingesting the GSFC ASCII raw data. 
The data filtering and processing program has six main 
functions: 

i) Definition of extrapolation intervals for the compu- 
tation of subsurface values and bottom reflectances; 

ii) Selection of normalization methods for in-water 
data with respect to above- water reference measure- 
ments; 

iii) Filtering of outlier data in the subsurface extrapo- 
lation interval, and removal of data below the noise 
threshold (defined as the radiance or irradiance 
given by 5 digital counts); 

iv) Correction for perturbation effects; 

v) Visualization of data as a function of depth together 
with extrapolated (surface and bottom) values; and 

vi) Creation of the level -2 (output) binned data and 
products.

All of the output files are in ASCII format, and can be 
quickly and easily used by the user. 

3.2 DATA REQUIREMENTS 

The JRC optical processor was primarily designed to 
support the analysis of data collected by Satlantic optical 
systems composed of multiple seven-channel OCR-200 and 
OCI-200 sensors to measure L^^(2,A), Eci{z,X), Eu{z,X), 
and Ed{0'^,X)- The analysis of in-water profile data re- 
quires the following ancillary data: 

a) Dark data for the cahbration process (including set- 
ting the pressure tare); 

b) Seawater absorption, a(A); 

c) Seawater single scattering albedo, uj{X)] and 

d) The diffuse-to-direct solar irradiance ratio, r(A). 
The latter is obtained from 



r(A) = 



E^{0\X) 



£d(o^A)-E,(o^A)' 



(13) 



where E^{0'^,X) is the diffuse solar irradiance (for the cor- 
rection of perturbation effects). 

3.3 DATA PROCESSING STEPS 

Data processing includes two steps: i) data calibra- 
tion and formatting to convert the raw data from counts 
(level-0 data) to physical units (level -1 data); and ii) data 
filtering and processing to remove outliers and create the 
level -2 data products. During each step, for each optical 
profile, the user can define processing parameters, which 
are stored in an information file and can be reloaded for 
subsequent automated reprocessing. 

3.3.1 Calibration and Formatting 

Data calibration and formatting involves five steps: in- 
gestion, calibration, screening, display, and output. 

3.3.1.1 Data Ingestion 

Input data for the calibration and formatting program 
include several ASCII files: i) the in-water radiance and ir- 
radiance files; ii) the reference above- water irradiance file; 
iii) the calibration files for the in-water and above-water 
devices (i.e., radiometers, pressure sensors, and tilt sen- 
sors); and iv) the dark data for the in-water and above- 
water radiometers. Specific ingestion routines ensure in- 
gestion of profile and reference data in different formats. 

3.3.1.2 Data Calibration 

The absolute calibration of the primary radiometric 
quantities, Lu{z,X), Ed{z,X), Eu[z,X), and Ed{^'^A). are 
obtained from: 

Z{\,U) = Cc{X)If{X)[V(X,U) - D{X)], (14) 



where 3(A,t^) is the calibrated value from the JRC pro- 
cessor, for which 3 is replaced by Ed{z), Eu{z), Lu{z), or 
Ed{0'*')r\ Cc{X) is the calibration coefficient; //(A) is the 
immersion factor; V{X,t^) is the raw voltage (in digital 
counts) measured by the instrument at time ti (which also 
sets the depth, z); and D{X) is the average dark value 
(in digital counts) measured at least once a day during a 
special dark cast with the system in air and caps on the 
radiometer. 

3.3.1.3 Data Screening 

An optional capability for screening the data as a func- 
tion of the instrument tilt (i.e., removing data above a tilt 
threshold value which can be set by the user) is computed 



from LP = tan ^ Wtan^ c/?^ + tan^ tpy , where tp^ and ipy are 
the two-axis tilts with respect to the vertical coordinate. 
The threshold for data rejection, ip^, is user-selectable and 
has a default value of (p^ — 5" . 

3.3.1.4 Data Display 

Cahbrated profiles, i.e., L^(z,A), Ed{z,X), and 
^11(2, A), can be displayed, together with tilts as a func- 
tion of depth in logarithmic scale. Ed{0'^ , X) is displayed 
as a function of the depth of the coincident in-water pro- 
file data. This easily ensures the identification of artifacts, 
which may affect the optical profile data. 

3.3.1.5 Output Data Format 

The output data are stored using the Coastal Region 
Long-Term Measurements for Colour Remote Sensing De- 
velopment and Validation (COLORS) data formatf which 
is composed of four blocks of information: 

a) The fieader block contains geographic and tempo- 
ral information, in addition to codes identifying the 
methods used during data collection; 

b) The calibration block contains information on the 
measurement systems, the sensors heads, and the 
calibration coefficients for each sensor; 

c) The data block description provides the list of quan- 
tities in the data block and the units assigned to 
each of them; and 

d) The data block contains the in-water data as a func- 
tion of depth together with the related above-water 
reference data, tilts, and time stamps. 

An example of the COLORS data format, for optical pro- 
file data, is given in Fig. 17. 



t The COLORS data can be reviewed on the World Wide Web 
at http: //marine. ie/datacentre/projects/colors/.

3.3,2 Filtering and Processing 

The primary purpose of the filtering options with the 
processor are to deal with data outliers and to correct for 
in situ perturbations to the fight field. 

3.3.2.1 Extrapolation Intervals 

The appropriate selection of the extrapolation inter- 
val, is the key element in extracting accurate subsurface 
data from in- water profiles. In coastal water, where op- 
tical stratifications may occur in the first few meters of 
the water column, an inappropriate selection of the ex- 
trapolation interval can induce large uncertainties in the 
final products. Although default values can be defined, the 
identification of an optimum extrapolation range satisfying 
the requirement for a linear decay of In [3(^, A)] is made 
by the operator on a cast-by-cast basis. 

In addition to the subsurface extrapolation interval, the 
selection of a bottom extrapolation interval is required to 
estimate bottom reflectance from profile data, when the 
correction for bottom effects is needed. 

3.3.2.2 Normalization of In- Water Data 

In-water radiometric quantities can be normalized with 
respect to £?d(0"*", A, t), with t exphcitly expressing the de- 
pendence with time, according to 



a(2,A,to) = a(^,A,t) 



Ed{0\X,to) 
£,(O^A,t)' 



(15) 



where ^{z^X^to) identifies the radiometric quantity as it 
would have been taken at all depths z at the same time 
^o; Eci{0'*' ,Xjt) is the solar irradiance taken at the same 
time, t^ as the in-water data; and Ed{0'^^ A, to) is the above 
water irradiance at time to (where to is generally chosen 
to coincide with the start of the cast). 

Alternatively, Ed{0^,X,to) can be defined as the me- 
dian for data records in the extrapolation interval. The 
normalization process can be skipped if data are not avail- 
able or are strongly affected by noise (e.g., ship motion). 
When £^^(0"*", A,^) is affected by harmonic noise (induced 
by the regular motion of the ship), Eci{0'^ ^ A, t) can be lin- 
early fitted as a function of t, and the fitted values can be 
used in the normalization of the profile data. For simphc- 
ity, the variable t is omitted in the following discussion. 

3.3.2.3 Filtering 

Data extrapolation in the subsurface layer is carried out 
using a least-squares hnear fit. This technique may pro- 
duce biased results in the presence of outliers, e.g., pro- 
duced by wave focusing effects. This bias may become 
larger as the number of points per unit depth decreases in 
the optical profile. Because of this, two complementary fil- 
ters have been implemented. The first ensures removal of 



points distant by more than na from the linear regression 
line obtained with all profile data, where n is a user-defined 
multipfier, and a is the standard deviation in the distance 
of the data points from the regression fine. 

The second filter computes successive regressions by 
adding depth increments to a defined basic extrapolation 
interval, and compares the slope of the resulting regres- 
sion line with the slope of the regression line obtained for 
the basic extrapolation interval. The latter filter may re- 
move all points below a certain depth within the chosen 
fitting interval, if for a given depth increment, the slope 
of the fitting line changes by more than a selected percent 
difference with respect to the initial value. 

Regression trials, to verify filtering in the extrapolation 
interval, are possible choosing a specific in-water quantity 
(i.e., Lu or Ed) and a specific wavelength, e.g., Ed{665), 
The use of Ed also allows a direct comparison of the in- 
water extrapolated value Ed{0~,X) with the solar refer- 
ence value, Ed{0'*', A), to immediately identify difficult sit- 
uations (i.e., those showing very different Ed{0~,X) and 
^d(0"*",A) values). The use of a channel in the red part 
of the spectrum, where seawater is characterized by high 
absorption and light levels exhibit a rapid drop to noise 
levels as a function of depth, helps in excluding noisy data 
from the fitting interval chosen for processing. 

All records (i.e., all quantities and channels) taken at 
the same time as data flagged by the filter are removed. 
The assumption made here is that all data collected at the 
same time are affected by the same perturbations. The 
input parameters are user selectable, so the filtering tech- 
niques can be used while retaining complete control in the 
removal of the outliers. 

3.3.2.4 Removing In Situ Perturbations 

Instrument self-shading, bottom reflection, and tower- 
shading effects can be removed through single or multiple 
selections. The correction factors are calculated assuming 
all the perturbations are independent from each other. 

Self-shading correction factors are computed using the 
scheme proposed by Gordon and Ding (1992) and the pa- 
rameterizations suggested by Zibordi and Ferrari (1995) 
and Mueller and Austin (1995). The computations are 
carried out using the solar zenith angle, ^, as well as a(A), 
r(A), and the ratio between the instrument diameter and 
the sensor entrance optics diameter. 

The correction factors for bottom reflection effects are 
estimated with a simple analytical model (Zibordi et al. 
2001) adapted from Maritorena et al. (1994). Compu- 
tations are performed using: a) the bottom reflectance, 
p(A) = Eu{zb,X)/Ed{zt^X)^ obtained from each profile at 
a depth z^ near the bottom; and b) the mean diffuse at- 
tenuation coefficient Kd{X) for the depth interval zq — z^, 
where zq is the subsurface depth identifying the upper- 
most value of the extrapolation interval. 

Tower-shading correction factors are obtained from 
look-up tables (Doyle and Zibordi 1998) derived from 



55 



Results of the Second SeaWiFS Data Analysis Round Robin, March 2000 (DARR-00) 



Monte Carlo simulations of the radiance and irradiance 
fields at the AAOT site for the specific point where the 
WiSPER measurements are made (Zibordi et al. 1999). 
For each center wavelength, A, the correction factors are 
indexed by discrete values of 9, a(A), u;(A), and r(A). 

3.3.2.5 Fitting 

Subsurface 3(0", A) optical values (L^^, E^, and Ed), are 
obtained from the exponent of the intercept given by the 
least-squares linear regression of In [3(2, A)] (computed 
from data not removed by filters) versus z within the ex- 
trapolation interval identified hy z^ < z < zi. Generally 
for the CoASTS profiles, 0.3 < 20 < Im and 2.5 < zi < 
4.5 m. The negative value of the slope of the regression fit 
is the diffuse attenuation coefficient K;^[X). 

An option, called "multicast processing"' enables the 
processing of data from a set of profiles, collected within a 
user-defined time interval (generally spanning a few min- 
utes), as a single optical profile. This procedure increases 
the statistical significance of regression analysis applied to 
subsurface data characterized by a low depth resolution 
(which is a usual characteristic of free-fall instruments) 
and affected by large perturbations (e.g., caused by sur- 
face effects). 

3.3.2.6 Data Visualization 

For each specific quantity and for ail wavelengths, it 
is possible to display the optical data and accompanying 
tilts as a function of depth. Regression lines for the near- 
surface extrapolation layer and the bottom layer are also 
shown. In addition, arrows at depth indicate the subsur- 
face extrapolated value, the subsurface extrapolated value 
corrected for perturbation effects, and in the specific case 
of Ed(0", A), also the corresponding Ed{^^ A)- 

3.3.2.7 In- Water Data Products 

The major in- water products obtained from optical pro- 
files are L^(0-,A), Ed{^-,\), Eu{0-,X), and Kd{X) com- 
puted from regressions in the extrapolation interval. Ad- 
ditional products are the subsurface Q-factor at nadir view, 
which is computed as Qn{^~^^) — Eu{0~ , X)/Lu{0~ , X), 
and the subsurface irradiance reflectance, R{0'',X), which 
is given by

3.3.2.8 Above-Water Data Products 

The above-water products are a) the total solar irra- 
diance measured at the start of the extrapolation range, 
Ed{0'',X,to)] b) the remote sensing reflectance, RrsW = 
Lvv(A)/Ed(0^, A,to); and c) the normalized water-leaving

The Fo(A) values used with the JRC processor are inter- 
polated from Neckel and Labs (1984) to the center wave- 
lengths of the sensors involved. 

Alternatively, if F^(0^, A) is not directly measured (with 
a separate sensor), RrsW and [Lu/(A)]^ are derived using 
Ed{0^,^^) values computed from F^(0~, A) according to 

where psW is the sea surface reflectance for downward 
irradiance. The latter is given by

the constant 0.66 is the sea surface albedo under diffuse

p,{X) -. pi9). 

3.4 SUMMARY 

The JRC Data Processing System has been designed 
to perform absolute calibration, formatting, visualization, 
and processing of in-water optical profile data. Data han- 
dling is specifically optimized for OCI-200 and OCR-200 
Satlantic seven-channel radiometers. The processor, devel- 
oped to ensure the analysis of both coastal and open ocean 
data, has options for the following: 

1. The selection of the extrapolation interval chosen to 
satisfy linear decay of the logarithm of profile data 
at all wavelengths; 

2. The normalization of the in-water profile data with 
respect to the above-water downward irradiance: 
and 

3. The capability of combining multiple casts to in- 
crease the statistical significance of single profile 
data collected with low vertical resolution. 

Additional relevant processing options are: 

4. The filtering of outliers through statistical analysis;

Abstract 



The ProSoft data processor was developed for the analysis of optical data collected with instruments manu- 
factured by Satlantic, Inc., including profiling and fixed-depth (buoy) systems. The data processing steps are 
organized into different levels which follow, as much as possible, the procedures given in the Ocean Optics Proto- 
cols for SeaWiFS Validation, Revision 1 (Mueller and Austin 1995). The processing involves three steps wherein 
the level -0 raw data (usually binary) are converted to calibrated values (engineering units) using one of several 
options for dark current correction, the level -1 data are averaged and corrected for acquisition and performance 
problems (if any), and the leveL2 data are used to compute the final data products, e.g., Rrs, [Lw(A)] PAR, 
etc. Processing can be done manually (and interactively) by the user, guided by the ProSoft processing steps, or 
in a fully automated batch mode. A notable difference between ProSoft and other data processors is the diffuse 
attenuation coefficient can be estimated using a traditional estimation of the slope of the optical variables within 
a user-defined extrapolation interval or using a new methodology based on multiresolution wavelet analysis. 



4.1 INTRODUCTION 

ProSoft is a data analysis package for processing op- 
tical data collected from oceanographic profiling systems. 
The primary goal in the development of ProSoft was to 
create a package capable of processing optical profile data 
in an automated manner to remove the subjective aspects 
of data processing, thereby ensuring any two investigators 
would get the same derived values from the same data set. 
ProSoft allows users to read, process, visualize, and pro- 
duce numerous data products from raw data sets collected 
from their instrumentation. 

The ProSoft program was developed over the past ten 
years by Dalhousie University (by the authors) and dis- 
tributed to users as source codef. ProSoft currently con- 
sists of about 220 program modules and 60 support files 
linked by a GUL The current version of ProSoft is 6.3d, 
and runs under MATLABJ version 6. 

This chapter is intended to give an overview of the main 
data processing steps carried out by ProSoft. It is as- 
sumed that the radiometric data have been collected with

an optical instrument whose raw data format is in compli- 
ance with the Satlantic Instrument Files Standard (SIFS) 
format§ or with GSFC level -0 ASCII files. It is also as- 
sumed that the radiometric data have been collected as 
a vertical profile of the water column with coincident ref- 
erence measurements from an instrument floating at the 
ocean surface. 

The ProSoft data processing steps are organized into 
different levels which follow, as much as possible, the pro- 
cedures given in the Ocean Optics Protocols for Sea WiFS 
Validation, Revision 1 (Mueller and Austin 1995). The 
processing blocks which exactly follow the Mueller and 
Austin (1995) recommendations are explicitly indicated. 
During processing, detailed notes, equations, and refer- 
ences for the various modules can be obtained by clicking 
on the Help button in any of the ProSoft (internal) menus. 

4.2 DATA PROCESSING 

ProSoft processing is segmented into four different lev- 
els: a) level -0 data are raw (usually binary) files from 
an instrument; b) level -1 data are calibrated (engineer- 
ing units), but unaveraged instrument data; c) level -2 data

are averaged and corrected instrument data: and d) level -3 
data are the final products, i.e., R^s, [Lw{^)]^, PAR, etc. 
Processing can be done manually (and interactively) by 
the user, guided by the ProSoft processing steps, or in a 
fully automated batch mode. User preferences, settings, 
and instrument configuration parameters are set in a con- 
figuration file (prosoft .cfg). ProSoft will output data 
files in three formats: tab-delimited ASCII text in ProSoft 
format, SeaBASS text format, or MATLAB binary format. 
The latter can be reingested by ProSoft much faster than 
the ASCII formats. 

4.2.1 Level-1 Data Processing 

Level -1 data processing begins with reading the raw 
level -0 data produced by Sat View (the Satlantic data ac- 
quisition program) compliant with SIPS 2000 (or GSFC 
level -0 data). These files typically contain detailed header 
information on the cast, in addition to the binary telemetry 
from one or more instrument systems. An instrument sys- 
tem usually consists of a profiling optical system (profiler) 
and a surface reference at some fixed depth or location 
above the sea surface (reference). ProSoft scans the data 
files and determines the number and type of instruments, 
prompting the user for the appropriate calibration files (or 
automatically loading the most recent file for that system 
in the current directory if the program is being used in an 
automated mode). The calibration information for each 
channel is then applied to the raw data to convert it to 
engineering units. 

4.2.1.1 Optical Data Calibration 

Standard optical sensor data formats are processed dif- 
ferently, based on the capabilities of the various types of 
acquisition systems. These are referred to as OPTICl (high 
resolution gain switching 24-bit systems), 0PTIC2 (stan- 
dard 12-, 16-, 24-, or 32-bit systems), and GPTIC3 (hyper- 
spectral systems with adaptive integration). Application 
of the calibration data to all optical and ancillary sensors 
is carried out in accordance with the procedures detailed 
in SIFS. 

Optical data are converted into engineering units using: 

e{\,u) = c,{X)if{X)[v{x,u) - 0(A)], (20) 

where 6(A,ti) is the caUbrated value from the Satlantic 
processor, for which (5 is replaced by Ed{z), Eu{z), Lu{z), 
or Ed{0'^)\ Cc{\) is the calibration coefficient; //(A) is the 
immersion factor; ^(A,^^) is the raw voltage (in digital 
counts) measured by the instrument at time ti (which also 
sets the depth, z)\ and D{X) is the dark value (in digi- 
tal counts). Within the ProSoft nomenclature, the dark 
value in (20) is referred to as the dark current, and can 
be obtained from a calibration file or from one of the dark 
current correction (DCC) methods described below. 



ProSoft currently implements DCC options other than 
calibration dark or shutter dark (which are explained be- 
low) only in the OPTICl (high resolution 24-bit systems) 
fitting mode-t The dark current can change under varying 
thermal conditions on the high resolution systems and has 
to be adjusted accordingly. 

In the OPTICl fitting mode, DCC other than that based 
on the calibration file (except HyperTSRB) can only be 
used for measurement frames obtained with a gain switch 
value of 1 or higher. In such a case, an analysis is first made 
of the measured frames according to the gain switches 
and applies the DCC according to the required correction 
scheme (e.g., PRO, BIN, or others). In the 0PTIC2 fitting 
mode, there are only two options available: CAL or NUL. 

4.2.1,1.1 CAL Darks 

The CAL DCC method is given by (20) and is based 
on using the dark values recorded in the calibration files, 
Z)c(A), for the instrument systems: 



6(A„fO = C,{\)Ij{X)[V{\U) - D,{X)\. 



(21) 



This is the default mode for both OPTICl and 0PTIC2 data 
types. 

4.2.1.1.2 NUL Darks 

The NUL dark correction scheme is a special mode in 
which no darks are subtracted during data calibration (note 
that in the OPTICl fitting mode, CAL darks are still sub- 
tracted for the data frames with a gain switch of zero): 



e[Ku) - Cc{x)If{x)v{x^^)^ 



(22) 



The NUL DDC scheme for 0PTIC3 data is explained in a 
later section. 

4.2.1.1.3 PRO Darks 

The PRO DCC option is a special mode for OPTICl data 
where a separate da.rk cast is taken. Immediately before 
or after a regular cast (profiler measurements with no caps 
on the sensors), a dark cast (profiler measurements with 
caps on the sensors) can be measured. Both profiles are 
first processed with the NUL option (i.e., no darks are sub- 
tracted), and then a second dark-corrected light profile, 
(Q{z,X), is obtained as a difference between the regular 
light profile, £(z, A) and the binned dark profile, {X>(2, A)): 



6(2, A) = £(2, A) 

M 



(D(2,A)), and 



(23) 



where the correspondence between the light profile and 
the binned dark profile occurs within plus or minus half a 
binning interval. Dark data binning (averaging) is carried 
out within 1 m depth intervals. 



t Explanations for the fitting modes are contained within SIFS.

4.2.1.1.4 BIN Darks 

If the profiler attains a depth for which all the optical 
sensors reach their dark levels, the darks can be computed 
from the average of a number of samples at the bottom 
of the profile. For each wavelength, the value of DCC is 
obtained from a layer, defined by ZnVm and ^max, where the 
average minimum light values, (£min(25 A)), are observed: 



6(2, A) - £(2, A) - (£min(2,A)), 



(24) 



where z = z^ 



:^n 



4.2.1.1.5 LUB Darks 

For each wavelength, the DCC factors for Lu(A) values 
are obtained from a layer wherein average minimum light 
values are observed (24). At the same time, -^^(A) values 
are dark corrected with a cahbrated dark value, Dc(A): 



6(2, A) = £(2, A) - Dc(A), 



(25)

4.2.1.1.6 LOG Darks 

Prior to, or just after, a light profile (profiler measure- 
ments with no caps on), darks can be measured on the deck 
with the profiler caps in place. Both data files are first pro- 
cessed with the NUL option (i.e., no darks are subtracted), 
then the LOG dark-corrected light profile is obtained as a 
difference between the original light profile, £(2, A), and 
the dark values, which are obtained at each wavelength as 
the result of time averaging all the calibrated dark data, 
:D(A): 

6(2, A) = £(z,A) - I)(A). (26) 

Note that in this case, the PRESSURE TARE value is not 
subtracted at the time of data processing with NUL option. 
The value of PRESSURE TARE is estimated as an average 
pressure of the measurements carried out on deck. The 
PRESSURE TARE value is subtracted during LOG processing. 

4.2.1.1.6 DCC of 0PTIC3 (Hyper spectral) Data 

Hyperspectral data are usually dark corrected with the 
values obtained from so-called shutter darks to obtain the 
most accurate correction. Shutter darks are continuously 
recorded during the measurements by occulting the input 
fiber with an optical shutter, typically after every five light 
samples. To calibrate hyperspectral data, the NUL DCC 
option should be used first, and the hyperspectral calibra- 
tion and subsequent DCC factors are determined in the 
following steps: 

1 . Correct the shutter dark counts obtained from a log 
file, 5(A), by the dark offset, Do(A): 



Ds{\) - D{X) - Do{X). 



(27) 



2. Convert the digital (voltage) dark counts into en- 
gineering units in accordance with the calibration 
equations. The cahbration equation for hyperspec- 
tral data is: 

2)(A) = C,(A)//(A)Z),(A)^, (28) 

where Cc(A) is the calibration coefficient, //(A) is 
the immersion coefficient, ^2 is the integration time 
during calibration, and ^1 is the integration time 
during the measurement. The former three are ob- 
tained from a calibration file, and the latter is ob- 
tained from the same log file as the optical data. 

3. Check the sequence of frame numbers, and flag the 
frames (i.e., set to a value of -999) that are not in 
sequence. 

4. Deglitch the dark data using a first diff'erence filter 
(optional). 

5. Smooth the shutter darks using a running boxcar 
filter. 

6. Interpolate shutter darks as a function of measure- 
ment time to match the number of dark and light 
data measurements. 

7. Correct the light data using the calibrated and cor- 
rected shutter darks: 



6(z,A) - £(2, A) - D(A). 



(29) 



8. Correct the light data using the thermal responsiv- 
ity correction: 



e{z,\) = 6(2, A) [1 + om{ciX^ + c2X^+ 

C3X + C4){T-20)]~\ 



(30) 



where Ds{X) is the corrected shutter dark values. 



where ci, C2, C3, and C4 are constants, and T is the 
temperature of the radiance or irradiance spectro- 
graph (ci = 6.79131 X 10-^ C2 = -1.09902 x 10-^ 
C3 = 6.51646 X 10"^ and C4 = -1.31056). 

4.2.1.2 Range Check 

Data that is suspect, out of range, or invalid is au- 
tomatically flagged (i.e., set to a value of -999). Sensor 
values of -999 are not used for any computations and are 
ignored. On graphs, these values are not shown and, thus, 
are displayed as a missing section of data. The thresh- 
old limits for various sensors, which determines whether 
or not a particular value will be out of range, are set in the 
configuration file (prosof t . cfg). 

4.2.1.3 Frame Check 

ProSoft checks whether a frame counter was present. 
If it was, the sequence of frames, which should increase 
monotonically until the maximum value is reached where- 
upon the frame counter resets, is checked. Any frames out 
of sequence are flagged.

4.2.1.4 Rate Check 

If the reference and profiler measurements are com- 
bined into a single data file, the data rates of both instru- 
ments (i.e., the number of frames per second) are checked 
(where time stamps are not available in the data). If the 
rates of both instruments are not equal, the following pro- 
cessing steps are executed (time stamps are optional dur- 
ing data acquisition, so the rate check and frame sequence 
procedures do not rely on them): 

1. Information about the sequence of the reference and 
profiler frames is obtained from a raw binary file 
(the sequence can be obtained, because profiler and 
reference frames have unique frame counters): 

2. Blank frames (i.e., frames with the variables set to 
values of -999) are added to the frames with the 
lowest data rate. This ensures that the number of 
frames corresponds to the measurement rates of the 
instruments; and 

3. The blank frames that belong to the instrument 
with the lowest sampling frequency are removed. 

Note that some blank frames could remain if the sequence 
of the reference and profiler data frames was not in strict 
accordance with the respective sampling frequencies. 

4.2.1.5 Profiler Data 

Profiler data are subjected to a number of corrections 
and checks before the level -1 data files are created. These 
include a) pressure tare (offset) correction, b) pressure 
spike check, c) wavelength sequence check, and d) a tilt 
quality control edit. 

4^2,1,5.1 Pressure Tare Correction 

Pressure sensors have a small offset value that varies 
with atmospheric pressure. The offset is removed by a pres- 
sure tare, which is stored in the header records by SatView 
when the data are acquired. The pressure tare is defined 
as the pressure value that is measured when the E^i sensor 
on the instrument system is located just at the surface. 
This value has to be subtracted later from the measured 
pressure values of a profile. If the profiler measurements 
were logged with SatView, the pressure tare value is op- 
tionally inserted into the file header. If no information is 
obtained, the pressure tare value is set to zero. 

4^2.1.5.2 Wavelength Sequence Check 

The wavelength sequence check resequences the optical 
data so that the data columns are organized from left to 
right as a function of increasing wavelength. 

4.2.1,5,3 Pressure Spike Check 

All frames with obvious pressure spikes are flagged. A 
deglitching procedure is applied using a threshold factor of 
100 (Sect. 4-2.1.6.2). 



4,2.1.5.4 Tilt Edit 

Profiler measurements can be edited interactively or 
automatically to remove any data records with unaccept- 
able tilt values. In manual mode, a plot is shown with 
profiler tilts (if available) and profiler velocity as a func- 
tion of depth. With the interactive graphical editor, the 
user defines an upper (surface) Zmin and lower z^^ax depth 
(the z coordinate is directed downwards). Data above Zmin 
or below 2nmx axe removed. 

A tilt threshold, Tiltlimit (the default value is 
V^max^''^^ in the prosoft.cfg file), is usually used for es- 
timating ^min and Zniax- In the case of a missing (or in- 
operative) tilt sensor, the free-fall velocity of the profiler 
can be used (zero or negative velocity is assumed to be 
associated with high profiler tilts). An automated editor 
module determines Zniin and z^ax in 10% of the upper and 
lower pari: of the profiler measurements. The upper depth 
and the lower depth are defined as the first depth level [z) 
where the following conditions are satisfied: 
1. 

2. 



and 



3. (Zn 



O.l^n 



for the top layer of the profile; 
for the bottom layer 



< z < z 



_: '^max 



of the profile. 
If a reference instrument is present, then the matching 
records in the reference data are also removed. 

4.2.1.5,5 Output Files with the PRO Extension 

The results of processing level -0 profiler data are saved 
in tab-delimited MAT (an optional MATLAB internal for- 
mat) and ASCII formats. 

4.2.1.6 Reference Data 

Reference data are checked before the level -1 data files 
are created. These checks include the wavelength sequence 
check and spike deglitching. 

4.2.1.6.1 Wavelength Sequence Check 

The wavelength sequence check resequences the optical 
data so the columns are organized from left to right as a 
function of increasing wavelength. 

4.2.1.6.2 Data Deglitching 

The (optional) deglitching module is applied to data to 
remove obvious glitches in sensor performance. For refer- 
ence data, the process begins with the application of a first 
difference operator to the time series of N data frames at 
each channel: 



d(A,t,) = E40\X,t^^i) - Ed{0',XA, 



(31) 



where t^ sets the sample index (in time or by frame count 
number), and the calculations occur over the interval i — 
l....,N -1. 



60 



S. Hooker, G. Zibordi, J-F. Berthon, D. D'Alimonte, S. Maritorena, S. McLean, and J. Sildam 



The standard deviation for each channel, (j(A), is then 
calculated as: 



^(A) 



/V-l 



N 



1=1 



0.5 



(32) 



where ^(A) is the average difference in the Ed{0'*',X) time 
series (of N frames). Any frames with differences more 
than lOcr from the average value are flagged. 

The general process described above is used with other 
deglitching requirements, except a new threshold value is 
used to match the type of deglitching under consideration 
(e.g., pressure spike removal uses a threshold of 100). 

4.2.1,6.3 Output Files with the REF Extension 

The results of processing level -0 profiler data are saved 
in ASCII and in MAT formats. 

4.2.2 Level-2 Data Processing 

The level-2 ProSoft data processing produces averaged 
(binned) profiles from the calibrated level -1 data as level - 
2a output. The data from the profiler sensors are also 
adjusted to the same reference depth (to account for offsets 
in depth between the sensors). In level -2b, the reference 
correction of the profile for surface irradiance fluctuations 
can be applied. The smoothed and adjusted data are then 
ready for the production of the level -3 data products. 

4.2.2.1 Level-2a Processing 

The purpose of the level -2a processing is to provide or 
prepare for most of the binning and filtering options. 

4.2.2.1.1 Calculation of Tilts 

From the level -1 data, the x and y components of tilt 
measurements are obtain ed in degrees. The tilts are calcu- 
lated using (p ^ tan"^ WtanVx +tan^c/?y, where ip^ and 
(p are the two- axis tilts with respect to the vertical. 

4.2.2.1.2 Constant Wavelength Intervals 

Interpolation to a constant wavelength interval can be 
carried out only with hyperspectral data. The interpo- 
lation interval is defined in the prosof t . cf g file by the 
DELTA.WL variable. If DELTA_WL= 0, no wavelength inter- 
polation is performed. 

4.2.2.1.3 Depth and Temporal Binning 

Data processing from level -1 to level -2a performs data 
averaging (referred to in ProSoft as "binning") as a func- 
tion of pressure (depth) or time. If both profiler and ref- 
erence or only profiler data is available, then the binning 
is performed as a function of pressure. Otherwise, binning 



is performed as a function of time. If a profiler, for some 
reason, was kept at a fixed depth level for a long time, how- 
ever, binning is still carried out as a function of time. A 
criterion for depth or time binning is based on the effective 
depth resolution. 

The effective depth resolution is the ratio of the number 
of data points measured between the maximum and mini- 
mum pressure indices to the m.aximum change in pressure. 
If the effective depth resolution is less than 1 mm, binning 
is carried out as a function of time; otherwise binning is 
carried out as a function of pressure. 

4.2.2.1.4 Calculation of Time and Velocity 

In addition to the measured variables, level-2 data in- 
cludes the variables that are derived from the measured 
ones: time {t) and velocity (;v). Note that time stamps, 
which can be added to a file during data acquisition, are 
optional. For this reason, ProSoft cannot rely solely on 
time stamps, but rather has to generate the time for each 
data frame using the start time, to (in hours), and the 
sampling frequency, fs (in hertz): 



^i = ^0 + 



2- 1 

3600 fs 



(33) 



where the calculations are performed over the interval i = 
The velocity at each data frame is computed as 



V{t^) = fs[z{tr^l)-z{t,)], 



(34) 



and calculated over the interval i ^ l,...,iV. After the 
computation is made, the velocity is smoothed using a box- 
car filter with a filter width of M. The value of M is the 
product of VEL_SMOOTH_TIME times fs (VEL_SMOOTH_TIME 
has units of seconds and is set within the prosof t.cfg 
file). 

4.2.2.1.5 Binning 

Binning is performed in several steps. In the first step, 
each instrument (i.e., profiler or reference) form an index 
vector that includes the sequential indices of the frames. 
The frame indices, Fi, depend on the measurement rate of 
an instrument in the following way: 



F,(z) - l + {i-l)fr, 2 = l,...,iV, 



(35) 



where N is the number of frames (measurements) carried 
out at a maximum rate, and fr is an integer part of the 
rates ratio given by MAXIMUM_RATE//5(j) for j = 1, . . . ,Nj 
and Nj is the number of instruments (usually Nj = 2). If 
the rates of all instruments are equal, Fi{i) = i over the 
interval i — I, . . . ,N. 

In the second binning step, a coordinate vector must be 
chosen (i.e., time or pressure) corresponding to the binning 
that will be performed (Sect. 4.2.2.1.3). If depth (pressure) 



61 



Results of the Second SeaWiFS Data Analysis Round Robin, March 2000 (DARR-00) 



binning is selected, the data are interpolated to ensure the 
difference between sequential frames is a constant (the de- 
fault resampling is 0.1 m). 

The third binning step adjusts the location between the 
Ed sensor and the other optical sensors based on the depth 
differences between the sensors. For example, the pressure 
measured at the Lu sensor is the pressure measured at 
the Ed sensor minus the PRO_LU_DIST value given in the 
prosof t . cf g file. 

The binning along the chosen coordinate vector is car- 
ried out in the fourth step. Currently, it is assumed that 
profiler measurements are always carried out at a higher 
rate, and prior to binning, the optical data are log trans- 
formed (whether or not the data are log transformed de- 
pends on switches given in the prosof t . cf g file). 

In the fifth and final step, the profiler optical data, 
other than Ed-, are adjusted to match the depth of the first 
Ed measurement (in the prosof t.cfg file, the respective 
sensor distance oflFsets are given by PRO_SENSORNAME_DIST, 
where SENSORNAME is, for example, Lu or Eu). Extrapola- 
tion is based on a linear regression fit of the log-transformed 
data versus pressure. The number of points used in the lin- 
ear regression calculation is defined in the prosof t . cf g file 
by the variable NUM_K_BINS. 

4.2.2.2 Level-2b Processing 

The purpose of the level -2b data processing is to com- 
ply with the SeaWiFS Ocean Optics Protocols (Mueller 
and Austin 1995) and as formulated in Smith and Baker 
(1984 and 1986), by weighting the in- water profiler data by 
the surface irradiance. The weighting is carried out usins: 



e{z,XAo) = e{zA;t) 



Ed{0\,XA) ' 



(36) 



but note that this procedure is different from the alternate 
method also given in Mueller and Austin (1995) using the 
solar irradiance measured when the profiler was at the sur- 
face {z = 0")t. The reason for this difference is mainly 
related to the problem- that Ed{0~ , X) is often unavailable, 
so ProSoft uses (36) instead. 

Level -2a to level -2b processing automatically follows 
the level -1 to level -2a processing if the REF_CORRECT_PRO 
variable is enabled (turned ON) in the prosof t.cfg file. 
Note also that the weighting given by (36) often introduces 
significant variations in the profiler data, particularly when 
clouds are present, so the default is for REF_C0RRECT_PR0 
to be disabled (set OFF). 



general, level -3 data processing can be divided into two 
parts: a) calculation of the products at the surface, and 
b) calculation of the products based only on the profiler 
measurements. 

The calculation of the products at the surface involves 
three steps: 

1. Propagation of all the radiometric data to the null 
depth, z = 0", level: 

2. Propagation of the radiometric data through the 
air-sea interface and, thus, above the surface, z -- 
0^: and 

3. Calculation of the various products, such as, the 
remote sensing reflectance, reflectance, normalized 
water-leaving radiance, diffuse attenuation coeffi- 
cient, PAR, and pigment concentration. 

In addition to the surface products, level -3 (vertical) 
profile products are calculated and involve the estimation 
of the diffuse attenuation coefficient, PAR, pigment con- 
centration, remote sensing reflectance, and reflectance. 

4.2.3.1 Surface K 

Surface values of K{X) and the primary radiometric 
variables, i.e., Ed{X) and L^(A), are obtained from a least- 
squares regression fit to the first N (looking down from 
the surface) log-transformed radiometric and depth (or 
pressure) data points, expressed here in terms of the delta 
indices:|:: 

ln[6(2„A)] = In [6(^0. A)] - Ke{zo,X)z,, (37) 

where Zi sets the sample index in terms of the depth (or 
the frame count), zq denotes the surface value (or initial 
frame count), and the calculations occur over the interval 
2 = 1,. ..,iV - 1. 

4.2.3.2 K Profile 

A vertical profile of K{X) is obtained from a least- 
squares regression fit which is applied to the A'' data points 
at a time 



ln[6(^^,A)] = \n[e{zmA)] - 



(38) 



where i — m + \,...,m^N and m — \, . . . .M — N , and 
M is the number of data points at a profile. 



4.2.3 Level-3 Data Processing 

The level-3 data processing is based mostly on the 
level -2 data. An exception is the estimation of the dif- 
fuse attenuation coefficient and the related level-3 prod- 
ucts from the level -1 (unaveraged) radiometric data. In 



t See Mueller and Austin (1995), Sect. 6.1.3, page 49. 



4.2.3.3 K from Fixed Depth Measurements 

In some cases, K{X) has to be estimated from a time 
series of upwelling radiance measurements, collected at a 



I Formulated from (31) on page 50 of Mueller and Austin 
(1995), which is based on the Smith and Baker (1984 and 
1986) traditional method of K analysis.

fixed depth (approximately 1 m) below the surface (this 
type of measurement is a common feature of nonprofiling 
instruments, like surface buoys). In this case, ProSoft esti- 
mates the spectrum of K{X) based on an empirical model 
(valid for Case-1 conditions): 

1. Compute K(490) and K{b2Q) from L^(443) and 
Lt,(550) using the Austin and Petzoid (1981) al- 
gorithms: 



K{A90) 

and 

K(520) 



0.022 + 0.0883 



0.044 + 0.0663 




-I -1.491 



-1.398 



(39) 



2. The Morel (1988) Case-1 empirical model for esti- 
mating K is inverted to obtain the pigment concen- 
tration C (chlorophyll a plus phaeopigments): 



^^490 — 

C'520 — 

and 

C = 



A"(490) -7^^(490) 
Xc(490) 

K{520) - K^{520) 
Xc(520) 

^^490 + C'520 



■^(490) 



^-1 



(520) 



(40) 



where K^{X) represents the diffuse attenuation co- 
efficient for pure water, and the coefficients XcW 
and e(A) are regression coefficients determined by 
statistical analysis of K{X) in Case-1 water for the 
wavelength range 400-700 nm (Morel 1988). 

The algorithm for computing K{X) is as follows: 



K{X) = K^(X) + Xc(A)C' 



e(A) 



(41) 



To calculate K{X) within the 700-800 nm range, Prosoft 
uses the following steps: 

i) The values of Ky,{X) within 700-800 nm are ob- 
tained from Smith and Baker (1981); 

ii) It is assumed that XcW ^^^ ^W decrease linearly 
from the values given at XcC'^OO) and e(700) to at 
800 nm; and 

iii) Using the above assumptions and K^{X) within 
700-800 nm, K{X) can be estimated for the 700- 
800 nm interval. 

4.2.3.4 Remote Sensing Reflectance 

The remote sensing reflectance is calculated using the 
ratio of the water-leaving radiance and incident solar ir- 
radiance, RrsW — Lw{X)/Ed{0'^ , X). Lw{X) is defined 



as, Lw = Lu(0",A)(l - p{X,d))n-^{X), where p{X,i9) is 
fixed at 0.021 for normal incidence, and n^(A) = 1.345 for 
seawater (Austin 1974). For the latter, if an above- water 
reference is unavailable, the incident solar irradiance is de- 
rived from the profiler Ed{z^X) measurements: 



Ed{0\X) = (l + Q)£;d(0",A), 



(42) 



where a is the Fresnel reflection albedo for irradiance from 
sun and sky (Gordon et al. 1988) which is fixed at 0.043. 
For these formulations, p and a are assumed independent 
of wind speed (Priesendorfer and Mobley 1986). 

4.2.3,5 Normalized Water-Leaving Radiance 

The normalized water-leaving radiance is estimated us- 
ing (63) of the SeaWiFS Ocean Optics Protocols (Mueller 
and Austin 1995): 



[Lw{X% 



L 



w 






(43) 



where, in ProSoft, the Neckel and Labs (1984) mean ex- 
traterrestrial solar irradiance data are reinterpolated to a 
0.1 nm resolution and then smoothed to match the 10 nm 
bandwidth of the radiometer detectors. The Lw{X) term 
in (43) is computed following the discussion in Sect. 4.2.3.4. 

4.2.3.6 PAR 

PAR, in units of quanta cm~^ s~\ is estimated using: 

^700 
/400 



rTOO \ 

PAR = / —Ed{X)dX^ 
J400 '^<^ 



(44) 



where h is Plank's constant, and c is the speed of light. 
The PAR formulation (44) is used for estimating PAR at 
the surface as well as for vertical profiles of PAR. ProSoft 
uses the MATLAB trapezoidal numerical integration rou- 
tine trapz.m to perform the iiitegration in (44). Prior to 
integration, EdiX) is interpolated onto a constant 1 nm in- 
terval and a minimum-maximum wavelength check is per- 
formed: 



if Al > 400 
if Xm < 700 



Ed{400) = Ed{Xi), and 
^^(700) = Ed{Xpj). 



(45) 



4.2.3.7 Energy Flux 

The energy flux, Fe, is computed as: 



100 



/•700 

/ EdiX)dX, 



(46) 



/400 



ProSoft uses the MATLAB trapezoidal numerical integra- 
tion routine trapz.m to perform the integration in (46). 
Prior to integration, Ed{X) is interpolated onto a constant 
1 nm interval, and a minimum-maximum wavelength check 



63 



Results of the Second SeaWiFS Data Analysis Round Robin, March 2000 (DARR-00) 



is performed as in (45). Fe is given in units of Wm~^. and 
because E^ is in units of /iWcm"^ nm~\ a scaUng factor 
of 100 is used in (46). The energy flux equation (46) is 
used for estimating Fe at the surface, as well as for verti- 
cal profiles of Fe- 

4.2.3.8 Estimating K Using Wavelet Analysis 

This section describes a new methodology for comput- 
ing K using the K from multiresolution (KMR) wavelet 
analysis method (Sildam et al. 1998). This level -3 module 
uses high resolution level -1 (unaveraged) data instead of 
the standard (Smith and Baker 1984 and 1986) method 
which uses level -2 (averaged) data. 

The following modules in ProSoft are experimental and 
are intended for advanced users. These subroutines do not 
follow the SeaWiFS Ocean Optics Protocols (Mueller and 
Austin 1995) and should not be used for submitting data 
to SeaBASS until further validation has been done. 

Estimation of K from optical profiles involves ambi- 
guity in the choice of the vertical scale. Usually, a noisy 
profile of K is obtained if K is estimated directly from: 



4.2,3.8,1 Mathematics of the KMR Method 

Multiresolution orthogonal Haar wavelet transforms de- 
compose the K{z, X) profile into M profiles at M scales, so 
that K[zm,^) 3Lt different scales are related to each other 
as: 

i^(2^_i,A) = K{z^,\) + K'{z^A): (48) 

where m = 1, . . . ,M and K'{zm,X) is the so-called detail. 
K{^m, A) is given by: 



K{z,X) - 



-1 AE, 

Ed{z,\) Az 



(47) 



where AE^ = Ed(zn+i. X) — Eci{zn,X) is calculated at 
the resolution of the measurements, Az, If AEd is esti- 
mated at an increased vertical scale mAz. i.e., A^"^ ~ 
Ed^Zj^^rri,^) ~ Ed{zy^,X) , smoother — but less detailed — 
profiles of K are obtained. Note that a similar problem 
holds also for estimating K using (38). The objective of 
the KMR methodology is to define an optimal depth in- 
terval for the determination of K that is objectively and 
automatically determined. 

Estimation of the K profile from discrete irradiance or 
radiance measurements makes the assumption that any ob- 
served profile can be divided into optically homogeneous 
layers. Usually the choice of the thickness of these layers 
is subjective. Moreover, it varies with wavelength, depth, 
time, and the geographical location of the measurements. 
Multiresolution wavelet decomposition of a K{z, X) profile 
(that is calculated with a fixed high vertical resolution) 
provides a hierarchy of profiles of K(z^, A) which are ob- 
tained by smoothing K{z,X) at different vertical scales. 
An optimal choice of the averaging scale at any depth level 
could then be based on a statistical approach (i.e., on the 
analysis of the K frequency distribution). 

In practice, having a few K estimates at a fixed depth, 
results in an inconclusive analysis of the K frequency dis- 
tribution. Frequency analyses, however, can be carried 
out over all observed depth levels if K is centralized and 
normalized by its standard deviation. The results of such 
an analysis show that in optically clear waters, recursive 
wavelet decomposition of the K profile combined with me- 
dian averaging can be used to obtain K profiles, which 
asymptotically reach the state of maximum probability 
(Sildam et al. 1998).

In (49), the depth location and scale are given by the n and 
m indices, respectively, (j)m,n is the so-called smoothing 
function, and (j>{z) is Haar's scahng function. 

In the KMR method, at every depth level z, m — 
1,...,M estimates of K{z,n,X) ^an be obtained. From 
these M profiles, a median profile (K{z,X)) can be eas- 
ily obtained. The median profile can be decomposed once 
again using the Haar scaling function, and a new median 
profile can be obtained. This iterative procedure can be 
repeated several times until an asymptotic K{X) is reached, 

4.2.3.8.2 Practical Steps of the KMR Method 

The practical steps of the KMR method are as follows 
1. Estimate the K{z,X) profile using 



I<{zA) -

Ed{z^:X) 
Edi^i + n', A)_ 



(51) 



where Az — z^j^ri - ^x represents the maximum al- 
lowed resolution (if z — 1, the maximum allowed 
resolution is equal to the depth resolution of the 
measurements). 

Apply the Haar multiresolution wavelet decompo- 
sition (50) to X(z,A). As a result, obtain M pro- 
files of iir(2rn, A), each calculated with a depth scale 
given by \z^ - 2^+l)2''', where m =- 1, . . . ,M. Note 
that n and m represent the minimum and maximum 
number of points, respectively, used in estimation of 

K{Zm.\)^ 

From the K{zm,^) profiles (m = 1,...,A'/), esti- 
mate a median profile, {K{z, X)). 
Repeat steps 2 and 3, each time using newly ob- 
tained {K{z, A)) until an asymptotic limit is reached.

4.3 SUMMARY 

The standard (40-cast) DARR-00 data were processed 
with ProSoft. Level -2 and level -3 products were submitted 
including [Lw/(A)]j^. For all the data, the K analyses (us- 
ing the methods described in Sect. 4.2.3.1) were executed 
using the auto-edited profiles as produced by ProSoft. For 
Case-2 water comparison, K was computed with and with- 
out editing, ignoring near surface tilts for one example. 
All files (light and dark) were processed first using the NUL 
dark correction. Once all the data were converted to engi- 
neering units, the LOG dark correction was used to subtract 
the DARK casts from the LIGHT. Table 23 presents a sum- 



mary of the ProSoft settings in the prosof t . cf g file for 
each of the instrument systems.

13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words) 

The accurate determination of upper ocean apparent optical properties (AOPs) is essential for the vicarious calibration of 
the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) instrument and the validation of the derived data products. To 
evaluate the importance of data analysis methods upon derived AOP values, the Second Data Analysis Round Robin 
(DARR-00) activity was planned during the latter half of 1999 and executed during March 2000. The focus of the study 
was the intercomparison of several standard AOP parameters: a) the upwelled radiance immediately below the sea 
surface, L^(0",X); b) the downward irradiance immediately below the sea surface, E{0\X); c) the diffuse attenuation 
coefficients from the upwelling radiance and the downward irradiance profiles, KjX) and /T^/A,), respectively; d) the 
incident solar irradiance immediately above the sea surface, E^{0^,X); e) the remote sensing reflectance, R^^(X)\ f) the 
normalized water-leaving radiance, [L (k)]^\ g) the upward irradiance immediately below the sea surface, £'/0"), which 
is used with the upwelled radiance to derive the nadir Q-factor immediately below the sea surface, Q^^(0\X); and h) 
ancillary parameters like the solar zenith angle, 9, and the total chlorophyll a concentration, C derived from the optical 
data through statistical algorithms. In the results reported here, different methodologies from thi-ee research groups were 
apphed to an identical set of 40 multispectral casts in order to evaluate the degree to which differences in data analysis 
methods influence AOP estimation, and whether any general improvements can be made. The overall results of 
DARR-00 are presented in Chapter 1 and the individual methods used by the three groups and their data processors are 
presented in Chapters 2^.
