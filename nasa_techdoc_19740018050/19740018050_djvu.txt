16. Abstract 



The authors consider the propagation of an electromagnetic 
wave in a spherically refracting medium on the basis of the 
optical-mechanical analogy between the trajectory of the ray 
and the trajectory of a material particle and use it to 
determine the refractive index of the medium. As an 
example of an application, the authors consider the 
refraction of radio waves in the solar corona.

OPTICAL-MECHANICAL ANALOGY 
0. G, Onishchenko 

In the study of the refraction of electromagnetic waves, /3' 
propagating in a spherically refracting medium, in the optical- 
geometric approximation, the apparatus developed for the motion of 
a material point (particle) in the central field can be used on 
the basis of the well-known analogy between the ray and the 
trajectory of the particle [1]. 

According to the Format principle, for electromagnetic rays 
propagating in a refracting medium

where Vx is the phase velocity of the wave, n Is the refractive 
index, c is the velocity of light in vacuum and ds is an element 
of length of the ray.

Henceforth, we will consider everywhere the trajectory of a /}\_ 
particle In a fixed central field UCr) and the trajectory of a 
ray In a spherically refracting medium, i.e. n = n(r). 

By comparing (1) and (2), it can be seen that the trajectory 
of the ray coincides with the trajectory of the particle when

In analogy with the law for the conservation of momentum of 
the particle

we can obtain from (1) the relation 

where ^ Is the angle between the radius vector r and the tangent 
to the trajectory (ray). Equation (5) is usually called the 
equation of the ray in a spherically refracting medium^ Using 
(5), in polar coordinates r, 8* the equation of the ray can 
be expressed in the following form

Equation (6) is analogous to the equation for the trajectory 
of the particle in polar coordinates [2]:

determine the boundaries of the region in which the ray propagates. 
When the region of admissible values r is bounded only by one 
condition r _> rj^^j^, the propagation of the ray is infinite. 
This corresponds to the case when the receiver and emitter are 
located at r _> ^-^^^i' When the region over which r varies has 
two boundaries rmin and ri^axj "the trajectory of the ray lies 
entirely in the interior of the ring

2. Determination of the Refractive Index of a Spherically_Re- 
fractlng Medium from the Total' Refraction Angle 

We will consider the propagation of electromagnetic waves in 
a spherically refracting medium, when the region in which the 
ray propagates is bounded by the condition r > rmin* 

In polar coordinates ,r, 8 , where is measured in the direc- 
tion of the point v^-^-^ where the ray is deflected, the equation 
of the ray (6) takes on the following form 

f 

where p is the impact parameter of the ray (see figure).

When the receiver and emitter /6_

Let us assume that it was possible to measure experimentally 
the relation x(p) for p > Pq. Then, assuming that 1 - n(r) is 
a monotonically decreasing function, we can reconstruct the 
relation n(r). To do this, taking advantage of the optical- /7 
mechanical analogy, we can use the known solution of the nonlinear 
Integral equation (12) for n(r) (see [2], §l8, problem 7). The 
final result can be expressed in the following form

Formula (13) implicitly defines the relation for all

Let us consider the case of a weakly refracting medium, i.e. 

where An{r) << 1. 

Under this assumption, the expression (12) for x(p) can he 
simplified by analogy with problems 1 and 2, §20 [2]. Using a 
series expansion In powers of An and transforming expression (12), 
it is possible to obtain:

Using the well-known solution of Abel*s integral equation, we 
can write

An expression for x(p) which is similar to (l4) was derived in 
a somewhat different manner in [3]. 

Let us consider the case when An is small and depends in the /8_

3. Application to the Refraction' of Radio'^Waves in the Regular 
Spherically Symmetric 'Solar' Coro'na 

It is known that in the transillumination of the solar 
corona by radio waves in the meter range in the region p < IORq 
(see figure, Rq ^1 6.96'10l'^ cm Is the radius of the photosphere), 
it is necessary to take into account, in addition to the 
scattering of the electron concentration by the inhomogeneities, 
also the refraction of the radio waves in the corona [4]. 

For radio waves with wavelength A = c/f <_ 8 m (f is the 
wave frequency and c the velocity of light), we can assume that 
An(r) << 1 in the solar corona in the region of heliocentric 
distances r ^ 3- Here 

^'^^^"-''-^T^i^Tr'^^?^—/^ ' (18) 



where m is the mass of the electron, N is the electron concentra- 
tion in el/cin-^ and e is the electron charge. 



To estimate the refraction angle of the radio waves in the 
corona, we will assume that some average distribution of the /9. 
electron concentration in the corona has the following form: 

where n = r/Ro ^^'^ ^e ^^ ^^^ numerical value of the electron con- 
centration on the Earth's orbit (ti ;^214). The first two terms in the right 
member of (19) are known as the Allen-Baumbach formula. The 
additional term in (19) describes the results of the measurements 
on the Earth's orbit. Substituting (19) in (l8), we obtain 



where a = const and g = const for a fixed value of f. The term 
'\'ri~ in (19) can be ignored, since it describes the distribution 
of the average electron concentration in the region 
1.03 < T] < 1.05. Using (17), we can obtain the relation X(p) in 
analytical form

It can tie seen from the table that for the model of the 
average electron concentration in the corona that was adopted, 
the total refraction angle x is not large.
