1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: 

A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class 
to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B 
and class L tests are expected to produce errors at compile time and link 
time, respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result f when they 
are executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, 
and the procedure CHECK_FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT 
also provides a set of identity functions used to defeat some compiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately compiled units. Errors 
are expected at link ti.me, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values -- for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in Appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and implementation- 
dependent characteristics. The modifications required for this 

implementation are described in Section 2.3.

INTRODUCTION 


For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by the AVF. 
This customization consists of making the modifications described in the 
preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see Section 2.1) and, 
possibly some inapplicable tests (see Section 2.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each test of 
the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are irrelevant 
for a given Ada implementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may 
be supported by documents issued by ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and commonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Commentaries are included as 
appropriate.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


The following 201 tests have floating-point type declarations requiring more 
digits than SYSTEM.MAX_DIGITS: 

C24113L..Y (14 tests) C35705L..Y (14 tests) 

C35706L..Y (14 tests) C35707L..Y (14 tests) 

C35708L..Y (14 tests) C35802L..Z (15 tests) 

C45241L..Y (14 tests) C45321L..Y (14 tests) 

C45421L..Y (14 tests) C45521L..Z (15 tests) 

C45524L..Z (15 tests) C45621L..Z (15 tests) 

C45641L..Y (14 tests) C46012L..Z (15 tests) 

The following 21 tests check for the predefined type LONG_INTEGER: 

C35404C C45231C C45304C C45411C C45412C 

C45502C C45503C C45504C C45504F C45611C 

C45612C C45613C C45614C C45631C C45632C 

B52004D C55307A B55B09C B86001W C86006C 

CD7101F 

C35713B, C45423B, B86001T, and C86006H check for the predefined type 

SHORT_FLOAT. 

C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with a name 
other than FLOAT, LONG_FLOAT, or SHORT_FLOAT. 

C45531M..P (4 tests) and C45532M..P (4 tests) check fixed-point operations 
for types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or greater; for this 
implementation, there is no such type. 

C45536A, C46013B, C46031B, C46033B, and C46034B contain 'SMALL 

representation clauses which are not powers of two or ten. 

C45624A and C45624B are not applicable as MACHIN£_OVERFLOWS is TRUE for 
floating-point types. 

E86001Y checks for a predefined fixed-point type other than DURATION. 

CA2009A, CA2009C..D (2 tests), CA2009F and BC3009C instantiate generic units 
before their bodies are compiled; this implementation creates a dependence on 
generic units as allowed by AI-00408 & AI-00506 such that the compilation of 
the generic unit bodies makes the instantiating units obsolete, (see 2.3.) 

CD1GC9C uses a representation clause specifying a non-default size for a 
floating-point type. 

CD2A53A checks operations of a fixed-point type for which a length clause 
specifies a power-of-ten type'small; this implementation does not support 
decimal smalls, (see 2.3.) 

CD2AS4A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use representation 
clauses specifying non-default sizes for access types. 








IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


CD2B15B checks that STORAGE_ERROR is raised when the storage size specified 
for a collection is too small to hold a single value of the designated type: 
this implementation allocates more space than what the length clause 
specified, as allowed by AI-00558. 

BD8001A, 3D80C3A, BD8004A..B (2 tests), and AD8011A use machine code 
insertions. 

AE2101C and EE2201D..E (2 tests) use instantiations of package SEQUENTIAL_IO 
with unconstrained array types and record'types with discrim_nants without 
defaults. These instantiations are rejected by this compiler. 

AE2101H, EE2401D, and EE24C1G use instantiations of package DIRE'CT_IO with 
unconstrained array types and record types with discriminants without 
defaults. These instantiations are rejected by this compiler. 

The tests listed in the following table check that USE_ERROR is raised if the 
given file operations are not supported for the given combination of mode and 
access method; this implementation supports these operations.

CE22C3A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of the external 
file is exceeded for SEQUENTIAL_IO. This implementation does not restrict

CE2403A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of the external 
file is exceeded for DIRECT_IO. This implementation does not restrict file 
capacity.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


CE3111B and CE3115A associate multiple internal text files with the same 
external file and attempt to read from one file what was written to the 
other, which is assumed to be immediately available; this implementation 
buffers output, (see 2.3.) 

CE3304A checks that USE_ERROR is raised if a call to SET_LINE_LENGTH or 
SET_PAGE_LENGTH specifies a value that is inappropriate for the external 
file. This implementation does not have inappropriate values for either line 
length or page length. 

CE3413B checks that PAGE raises LAYOUT_ERROR when the value of the page 
number exceeds COUNT'LAST. For this implementation, the value of COUNT'LAST 
is greater than 150000 making the checking of this objective impractical. 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see Section 1.3) were required for 109 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
implementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the way 
expected by the original tests.

E2S0C2E was graded inapplicable by Evaluation and Test Modification as 
directed by the AVO. This test checks that pragmas may have unresolvable 
arguments, and it includes a check that pragma LIST has the required effect; 
but for this implementation, pragma LIST has no effect if the compilation 
results in errors or warnings, which is the case when the test is processed 
without modification. This test was also processed with the pragmas at lines 
46, 56, 70 and 71 commented out so that pragma LIST had effect . 


2-4 







IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


Tests C45524A..K (11 tests) were graded passed by Test Modification as 
directed by the AVO. These tests expect that a repeated division will result 
in zero; but the standard only requires that the result lie in the smallest 
safe interval. Thus, the tests were modified to check that the result was 
within the smallest safe interval by adding the following code after line 
141; the modified tests were passed: 

ELSIF VAL <= F'SAFE SMALL THEN COMMENT ("UNDERFLOW SEEMS GRADUAL"); 


C83030C and C86007A were graded passed by Test Modification as directed by 
the AVO. These tests were modified by inserting "PRAGMA ELABORATE (REPORT);" 
before the package declarations at lines 13 and 11, respectively. Without the 
pragma, the packages may be elaborated prior to package report's body, and 
thus the packages' calls to function Report.Ident_Int at lines 14 and 13, 
respectively, will raise PROGRAM_ERROR. 

B83E01B was graded passed by Evaluation Modification as directed by the AVO. 
This test checks that a generic subprogram's formal parameter names (i.e. 
both generic and subprogram formal parameter names) must be distinct; the 
duplicated names within the generic declarations are marked as errors, 
whereas their recurrences in the subprogram bodies are marked as "optional" 
errors—except for the case at line 122, which is marked as an error. This 
implementation does not additionally flag the errors in the bodies and thus 
the expected error at line 122 is not flagged. The AVO ruled that the 
implementation's behavior was acceptable and that the test need not be split 
(such a split would simply duplicate the case in B83E01A at line 15). 

CA2009A, CA2009C..D (2 tests), CA2009F and BC3009C were graded inapplicable 
by Evaluation Modification as directed by the AVO. These tests instantiate 
generic units before those units' bodies are compiled; this implementation 
creates dependences as allowed by AI-00408 & AI-00506 such that the 
compilation of the generic unit bodies makes the instantiating units 
obsolete, and the objectives of these tests cannot be met. 

BC3204C and BC3205D were graded passed by Processing Modification as directed 
by the AVO. These tests check that instantiations of generic units with 
unconstrained types as generic actual parameters are illegal if the generic 
bodies contain uses of the types that require a constraint. However, the 
generic bodies are compiled after the units that contain the instantiations, 
and this implementation creates a dependence of the instantiating units on 
the generic units as allowed by AI-00408 & AI-00506 such that the compilation 
of the generic bodies makes the instantiating units obsolete—no errors are 
detected. The processing of these tests was modified by compiling the 
seperate files in the following order (to allow re-compilation of obsolete 
units), and ail intended errors were then detected by the compiler: 

BC3204C: CO, Cl, C2, C3M, C4, C5, C6, C3M 

3C32C5D: DC, D2, DIM 


2-5 





IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 

BC3204D and BC3205C were graded passed by Test Modification as directed by 
the AVO. These tests are similar to BC3204C and BC3205D above, except that 
all compilation units are contained in a single compilation. For these two 
tests, a copy of the main procedure (which later units make obsolete) was 
appended to the tests; all expected errors were then detected. 

CD2A53A was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by the 
AVO. The test contains a specification of a power-of-ten value as small for 
a fixed-point type. The AVO ruled that, under ACVC 1.11, support of decimal 
smalls may be omitted. 

AD9001B and AD9004A were graded passed by Processing Modification as directed 
by the AVO. These tests check that various subprograms may be interfaced to 
external routines (and hence have no Ada bodies). This implementation 
requires that a file specification exists for the foreign subprogram bodies. 
The following command was issued to the Librarian to inform it that the 
foreign bodies will be supplied at link time (as the bodies are not actually 
needed by the program, this command alone is sufficient: 

adalib> interface -sys -L=library AD9004A 

CE3111B and CE3115A were graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as 
directed by the AVO. The tests assume that output from one internal file is 
unbuffered and may be immediately read by another file that shares the same 
external file. This implementation raises END_ERROR on the attempts to read 
at lines 87 & 101, respectively.

PROCESSING INFORMATION 


3.'2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

Ar. Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming 
Language Standard, whether the test is applicable or inapplicable; 
otherwise, the Ada Implementation fails the ACVC [Pro90] . 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard.

(a+b+f) 


Ail I/O tests of the test suite were processed because this implementation 
supports a file system. The above number of floating-point tests were not 
processed because they used floating-point precision exceeding that supported 
by the implementation. When this compiler was tested, the tests listed in 
Section 2.1 had been withdrawn because of test errors. 


3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

Version 1.11 of the ACVC comprises 4170 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, the tests listed in Section 2.1 had been withdrawn because of test 
errors. The AVF determined that 295 tests were inapplicable to this 
implementation. All inapplicable tests were processed during validation 
testing except for 201 executable tests that use floating-point precision 
exceeding that supported by the implementation. In addition, the modified 
tests mentioned in Section 2.3 were also processed. 

A 1/4" Data Cartridge containing the customized test suite (see Section 1.3) 
was taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
tape were loaded directly onto the host computer. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host computer, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the customer and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a complete listing of 
the processing options for this implementation. It also indicates the 
default options. The options invoked explicitly for validation testing 
during this test were:

PROCESSING INFORMATION 


Options used for compiling: 

-f forces the compiler to accept an attempt to compile a unit imported 

from another library, which is normally prohibited. 

-q quiet, stops output of all compiler phase names. Not documented in 

product version as it is the default setting. Option -v was the 
default setting for the validation run. 

-c normally the compiler creates a registered copy of the user's source 

code in the library directory for proper operation of the remake and 
make subcommands to Adalib. 

-La forces a compiler to produce a listing even if no errors were found. 

No explicit linker Options were used. 

Test output, compiler and linker listings, and job logs were captured on a 

1/4" Data Cartridge and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site 

by the validation team were also archived.

APPENDIX B 


COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


The compiler options of this Ada implementation, as describe his 
Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically notea ^ e, 
references in this appendix are to compiler documentation and not to tnis 
report. 


B-l 




Compilation switches for Tartan Ada Sun-Sun. 

-a 

Generate an assembly code file. The assembly 
code file has an extension .s for a body or 
.ss for a specification (see Section 4.4). 

-A 

Generate an assembly code file with 
interleaved source code. The assembly code 
file has an extension .s for a body or .ss 
for a specification. 

-c 

Normally, the compiler creates a registered 
copy of the user's source code in the library 
directory for proper operation of the remake 
and make subcommands to adalib. 


This option suppresses the creation of this 
copy. 

-d 

When compiling a library unit, determine 
whether the unit is a refinement of its 
previous version and, if so, do not make 
dependent units obsolete. This check is not 
done by default. 

-e=<integer> 

Stop compilation and produce a listing after 
n errors are encountered, where n is in the 
range 0..255. The default value for n is 

255. The -e qualifier cannot be negated. 

-f 

Forces the compiler to accept an attempt to 
compile a unit imported from another library, 
which is normally prohibited. 

-g 

Compile with debugging information for 

AdaScope. 

-i 

Cause compiler to omit data segments with the 
text of enumeration literals. This text is 
normally produced for exported enumeration 
types in order to support the text attributes 
('IMAGE, 'VALUE and 'WIDTH). Tou should use 
-i only when you can guarantee that no unit 
that will import the enumeration type will 
use any of its text attributes. However, if 
you are compiling a unit with an enumeration 
type that is not visible to other compilation 
units, this option is not needed. The 
compiler can recognize when the text 
attributes are not used and will not generate 
the supporting strings. 

-L=[project: 

: ]library Select library and/or project for this 

compilation. This option takes effect after 
all commands from the .adalibrc file have 
been executed, thereby possibly overriding 
its effects. 





2 


La 

Generate a listing, even if no errors were 
found. The default is to generate a listing 
only if an error is found. 

Ln 

Never generate a listing. The default is to 
generate a listing only if an error is found. 

Op=n 

Control the level of optimization performed 
by the compiler, requested by n. The 
optimization levels available are: 


n = 0 Minimum - Performs context 
determination, constant fold¬ 
ing, algebraic manipulation, 
and short circuit analysis. 

n = 1 Low - Performs level 0 op¬ 

timizations plus common sub¬ 
expression elimination and 
equivalence propagation within 
basic blocks. It also op¬ 
timizes evaluation order. 

n = 2 Best tr&deoff for space/time - 
the default level. Performs 
level 1 optimizations plus flow 
analysis which is used for 
common subexpression elimina¬ 
tion and equivalence propaga¬ 
tion across basic blocks. It 
also performs invariant expres¬ 
sion hoisting, dead code 
elimination, and assignment 
killing. Level 2 also performs 
lifetime analysis which is used 
to improve register allocation. 
It also performs inline expan¬ 
sion of subprogram calls in¬ 
dicated by Pragma INLINE, if 
possible. 

n = 3 Time - Performs level 2 
optimizations plus inline ex¬ 
pansion of subprogram calls 
which the optimizer decides are 
profitable to expand (from an 
execution time perspective). 
Other optimizations which im¬ 
prove execution time at a cost 
to image size are performed 

n = 4 Space - Performs those 

optimizations which usually 
produce the smallest code, 
often at the expense of 
speed. This optimization 
level may not always produce 




3 


-r 


-S[ACDEILORSZ] 


the smallest code, however, 
another level may produce 
smaller code under certain 
conditions. 


For internal use only, this option is used by 
adalib when it invoices the compiler in 
(re)make mode. 


Suppress the given set of checks: 


A ACCESS_CHECK 

C CONSTRAINT_CHECK 

D DISCRIMINANT_CHECK 

E EIABORATION_CHECK 

1 INDEX_CHECK 

L LENGTH_CHECK 

0 OVERFLOW_CHECK 

R RANGE_CH£CK 

S STORAGE_CHECK 

Z "ZERO"DIVISION CHECK 


The -S option has the same effect as an 
equivalent pragma SUPPRESS applied to the 
source file. If the source program also 
contains a pragma SUPPRESS, then a given 
check is suppressed if either the pragma or 
the switch specifies it; that is, the effect 
of a pragma SUPPRESS cannot be negated with 
the command line option. See LRM 11.7 for 
further details. Supplying the -S option 
significantly decreases the size and execu- 


tion time 

are: 

of the 

compiled code. Examples 

-SOZ 

Suppress OVERFLOW_CHECK 

"ZERO"DIVISION_CHECK. 

and 

-S 

Suppress 

all checks. 


-SC 

Suppress 

CONSTRAINT_ERROR, 

equiv- 


alent to -SADILR. (Note that -SC 
is upward compatible with Version 
2 . 0 ) 


Print out compiler phase names. The compiler 
prints out a short description of each 
compilation phase in progress. 

Suppress warning messages. 


-x 


Include cross reference information for the 
source in the object file (see section 4.6). 


In addition, the output from the compiler may be redirected using the 
SunOS redirection facility including for stderr; for example

LINKER OPTIONS 

The linker options of this Ada implementation, as described in this Appendix, 
are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted otherwise, 
references in this appendix are to linker documentation and not to this 
report. 






Linker switches for Sun hosted Tartan Ada compilers. 

COMMAND QUALIFIERS 

This section describes the command options available to a user who directly 
invoices the linker. The option names can be abbreviated, to unique prefixes; 
the first letter is sufficent for all current option names. The option names 
are not case sensitive. 

-CONTROL file The specified file contains linker control commands. 

Only one such file may be specified, but it can 
include other files using the CONTROL command. Every 
invocation of the linker must specify a control file. 

-OUTPUT file The specified file is the name of the first output 

object file. The module name for this file will be 
null. Only one output file may be specified in this 
manner. Additional output files may be specified in 
the linker control file. 

-ALLOCATIONS Produce a link map showing the section allocations. 

-UNUSEDSECT10NS Produce a link map showing the unused sections. 

-SYMBOLS Produce a link map showing global and external 

symbols. 

-RESOLVEMODULES This causes the linker to not perform unused section 

elimination. Specifying this option will generally 
make your program larger, since unreferenced data 
within object files will not be eliminated. Refer to 
Sections RESOLVE_CMD and USE_PROCESSING for infor¬ 
mation on the way that unused section elimination 
works. 

-MAP Produce a link map containing all information except 

the unused section listings. 

Note that several listing options are permitted. This is because link maps 
for real systems can become rather large, and writing them consumes a 
significant fraction of the total link time. Options specifying the contents 
of the link map can be combined, in which case the resulting map will contain 
all the information specified by any of the switches. The name of the file 
containing the link map is specified by the LIST command in the linker control 
file. If your control file does not specify a name and you request a listing, 
the listing will be written to the standard output stream. 







APPENDIX C 


APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD

Appendix F to MIL-STD-1815A 


This chapter contains the required Appendix F to the LRM which is Military Standard, Ada Programming 

Language , ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A (American National Standards Institute, Inc., February 17,1983). 

5.1. PRAGMAS 

5.1.1. Predefined Pragmas 

This section summarizes the effects of and restrictions on predefined pragmas. 

• Access collections are not subject to automatic storage reclamation so pragma CONTROLLED has no effect 
Space deallocated by means of UNCHECKED_DEALLOCATION will be reused by the allocation of new 
objects. 

• Pragma ELABORATE is supported. 

• Pragma INLINE is supported. 

• Pragma INTERFACE is supported. It is assumed that the foreign code interfaced adheres to Tartan Ada 
calling conventions as well as Tartan Ada parameter passing mechanisms. Any Language_Name will be 
accepted, but ignored, and the default will be used. 

• Pragma LIST is supported but has the intended effect only if the command line option -La was supplied 
for compilation, and the listing generated was not due to the presence of errors and/or warnings. 

• Pragma memory_S IZE is accepted but no value other than that specified in Package system (Section 
53) is allowed. 

• Pragma OPTIMIZE is supported except when at the outer level (that is, in a package specification or 
body). 

• Pragma PACK is supported. 

• Pragma page is supported but has the intended effect only if the command line option -La was supplied 
for compilation, and the listing generated was not due to the presence of errors and/or warnings. 

• Pragma PRIORITY is supported. 

• Pragma STORAGE_UNIT is accepted but no value other than that specified in Package SYSTEM (Section 
5.3) is allowed. 

• Pragma SHARED is not supported. No warning is issued if it is supplied. 

• Pragma SUPPRESS is supported. 

• Pragma system_name is accepted but no value other than that specified in Package system (Section 
5.3) is allowed.

USER MANUAL FOR TARTAN ADA SUN 


5.12. Implementation-Defined Pragmas 

Implementation-defined pragmas provided by Tartan are described in the following sections. 

5.12.1. Pragma LINKAGE_NAM£ 

The pragma linkage_name associates an Ada entity with a string that is meaningful externally; e.g., to a 
linkage editor. It takes the form 

pragma LINKAGE_NA13 {Ada-simple-name, string-constant) 

The Ada-simple-name must be the name of an Ada entity declared in a package specification. This entity must be 
one that has a runtime representadon; e.g., a subprogram, exception or object It may not be a named number or 
string constant. The pragma must appear after the declaration of the entity in the same package specification. 

The effect of the pragma is to cause the string-constant to be used in the generated assembly code as an 
external name for the associated Ada entity. It is the responsibility of the user to guarantee that this string 
constant is meaningful to the linkage editor and that no illegal linkname clashes arise. 

This pragma has no effect when applied to a library subprogram or to a renames declaration; in the latter case, 
no warning message is given. 

When determining the maximum allowable length for the external linkage name, keep in mind that the 
compiler will generate names for elaboration flags simply by appending the suffix #GOTO. Therefore, the 
external linkage name has S fewer significant characters than the lower limit of other tools that need to process 
the name (e.g., 40 in the case of the Tartan Linker). 

5.122. Pragma FORElGN_BODY 

In addition to Pragma interface. Tartan Ada supplies Pragma FOR£IGN_body as a way to access 
subprograms in other languages. 

Unlike Pragma INTERFACE, Pragma FOREIGN_BODY allows access to objects and exceptions (in addition 
to subprograms) to and from other languages. 

Some restrictions on Pragma FORElGN_BODY that are not applicable to Pragma interface are: 

• Pragma FOREI GN_BODY must appear in a non-generic library package. 

• All objects, exceptions and subprograms in such a package must be supplied by a foreign object module. 

• Types may not be declared in such a package. 

Use of the pragma FOREI GN_BODY dictates that all subprograms, exceptions and objects in the package are 
provided by means of a foreign object module. In order to successfully link a program including a foreign body, 
the object module for that body must be provided to the library using the adalib foreign command 
described in sections 3.3.3 and 9.5.5. The pragma is of the form; 

pragma F ORE I GN_BOD Y (Language jiame [, elaboration _routine_name]) 

The parameter Language jiame is a string intended to allow the compiler to identify the calling convention used 
by the foreign module (but this functionality is not yet in operation). Currently, the programmer must ensure that 
the calling convention and data representation of the foreign body procedures are compatible with those used by 
the Tartan Ada compiler. Subprograms called by tasks should be reentrant. 

The optional elaboration_roudne_name string argument is a linkage name identifying a routine to initialize 
the package. The routine specified as the elaborationj-oiuinejiame, which will be called for the elaboration of 
this package body, must be a global routine in the object module provided by the user. 

A specification that uses this pragma may contain only subprogram declarations, object decorations that use 
an unconstrained type mark, and number declarations. Pragmas may also appear in the package. The type mark 
for an object cannot be a task type, and the object declaration must not have an initial value expression. The 
pragma must be given prior to any declarations within the package specification. If the pragma is not located 
before the first declaration, or any restriction on the declarations is violated, the pragma is ignored and a warning 
is generated. 


5-2 




APPENDIX F TO MIL-STD-1815 A 


The foreign body is entirely responsible for initializing objects declared in a package utilizing pragma 
foreign_body. In particular, the user should be aware that the implicit initializations described in LRM 3.2.1 
are not done by the compiler. (These implicit initializations are associated with objects of access types, certain 
record types and composite types containing components of the preceding kinds of types.) 

Pragma linkage_name should be used for all declarations in the package, including any declarations in a 
nested package specification to be sure that there are no conflicting link names. If pragma LINKAGE_name is 
not used, the cross-reference qualifier, -x, (see Section 4.2) should be used when invoking the compiler and the 
resulting cross-reference table of linknames inspected to identify the linknames assigned by the compiler and 
determine that there are no conflicting linknames (see also Section 4.6). In the following example, we want to 
call a function plmn which computes polynomials and is written in C. 

package math_funcs is 

pragma F0R£IGN_30DY ("C") ; 

function POLYNOMIAL (X: INTEGER) return INTEGER;

To compile, link and run the above program, you do the following steps: 

1. Compile math_funcs 

2. Compile MAIN 

3. Obtain an object module (e.g. math. tof ) containing the compiled code for plmn, converted to Tartan 
Object File Format (TOFF) using the aout_to_tof f utility (See Object File Utilities, Chapter 4). 

4. Issue the command 

adalib foreign math_funcs math.tof 

5. Issue the command 

adalib link main 

Without Step 4, an aoempt to link will produce an error message informing you of a missing package body for 
MATH_F T JNCS. 

Using an Ada body from another Ada program library. The user may compile a body written in Ada for a 
specification into the library, regardless of the language specified in the pragma contained in the specification. 
This capability is useful for rapid prototyping, where an Ada package may serve to provide a simulated response 
for the functionality that a foreign body may eventually produce. It also allows the user to replace a foreign body 
with an Ada body without recompiling the specification. 

The user can either compile an Ada body into the library, or use the command adalib foreign (see 
Sections 3.3.3 and 9.5.5) to use an Ada body from another library. The Ada body from another library must have 
been compiled under an identical specification. The pragma linkage_name must have been applied to all 
entities declared in the specification. The only way to specify the linkname for the elaboration routine of an Ada 
body is with the pragma FORElGN_BODY.

5.4. RESTRICTIONS ON REPRESENTATION CLAUSES 

The following sections explain the basic restrictions for representation specifications followed by additional 
restrictions applying to specific kinds of clauses. 

5.4.1. Basic Restriction 

The basic restriction on representation specifications [LRM 13.1] is that they may be given only for types 
declared in terms of a type definition, excluding a generic_type_definition (LRM 12.1) and a 
private_type_def inition (LRM 7.4). Any representation clause in violation of these rules is not obeyed 
by the compiler, an error message is issued. 

Further restrictions are explained in the following sections. Any representation clauses violating those restric¬ 
tions cause compilation to stop and a diagnostic message to be issued. 

5.42. Length Clauses 

Length clauses [LRM 13.2] are, in general, supported. For details, refer to the following sections. 

5.42.1. Size Specifications for Types 

The rules and restrictions for size specifications applied to types of various classes are described below. 

The following principle rules apply: 

1. The size is specified in bits and must be given by a static expression. 

2. The specified size is taken as a mandate to store objects of the type in the given size wherever feasible. 
No attempt is made to store values of the type in* a smaller size, even if possible. The following rules 
apply with regard to feasibility: 

• An object that is not a component of a composite object is allocated with a size and alignment that 
is referable on the target machine; that is, no attempt is made to create objects of non-referable size 
on the stack. If such stack compression is desired, it can be achieved by the user by combining 
multiple stack variables in a composite object; for example 


5-4 









APPENDIX F TO MIL-STD-1 815 a 


type My_Enum is (A,B); 
for My_enum'size use 1; 

V,W: My_enum; — will occupy two storage 

— units on the stack 

— (if allocated at all) 
type rec is record 

V,W: My_enum; 
end record; 
pragma Pack(rec); 

0: rec; — will occupy one storage unit 

• A formal parameter of the type is sized according to calling conventions rather than size 
specifications of the type. Appropriate size conversions upon parameter passing take place 
automatically and are transparent to the user. 

• Adjacent bits to an object that is a component of a composite object, but whose size is 
non-referable, may be affected by assignments to the object, unless these bits are occupied by other 
components of the composite object; that is, whenever possible, a component of non-referable size 
is made referable. 

In all cases, the compiler generates correct code for all operations on objects of the type, even if they are 
stored with differing representational sizes in different contexts. 

Note: A size specification cannot be used to force a certain size in value operations of the type; for 
example 

type my_int is range 0..65535; 
for my_int'size use 16; — o.k. 

A,B: my_int; 

...A + B... — this operation will generally be 
— executed on 32-bit values 

3. A size specification for a type specifies the size for objects of this type and of all its subtypes. For 
components of composite types, whose subtype would allow a shorter representation of the component 
no attempt is made to take advantage of such shorter representations. In contrast, for types without a 
length clause, such components may be represented in a lesser number of bits than the number of bits 
required to represent all values of the type. Thus, in the example 

type MY_INT is range 0..2**15-1; 
for MY_INT'SIZE use 16; — (1) 
subtype SMALL__MY_INT is MY_INT range 0..255; 
type R is record 

X: SMALL_MY_INT; 

end record; 

the component R.x will occupy 16 bits. In the absence of the length clause at (1), R.x may be 
represented in 8 bits. 

Size specifications for access types must coincide with the default size chosen by the complier for the type. 
Size specifications are not supported for floating-point types or task types. 

No useful effect can be achieved by using size specifications for these types. 

5.4J J. Size Specification for Scalar Types 

The specified size must accommodate all possible values of the type including the value 0 (even if 0 is not in 
the range of the values of the type). For numeric types with negative values the number of bits must account for 
the sign bit. No skewing of the representation is attempted. Thus 

type my_int is range 100..101; 
requires at least 7 bits, although it has only two values, while 


5-5 






USER MANUAL FOR TARTAN ADA SUN 


type my_int is range -101..-100; 
requires 8 bits to account for the sign bit. 

A size specification for a real type does not affect the accuracy of operations on the type. Such influence 
should be exerted via the accuracy_def inition of the type (LRM 3.5.7,3.5.9). 

A size specification for a scalar type may not specify a size larger than the largest operation size supported by 
the target architecture for the respective class of values of the type. 

5.423. Size Specification for Array Types 

A size specification for an array type must be large enough to accommodate all components of the array under 
the densest packing strategy. Any alignment constraints on the component type (see Section 5.4.7) must be meL 

The size of the component type cannot be influenced by a length clause for an array. Within the limits of 
representing all possible values of the component subtype (but not necessarily of its type), the representation of 
components may, however, be reduced to the minimum number of bits, unless the component type carries a size 
specification. 

If there is a size specification for the component type, but not for the array type, the component size is 
rounded up to a referable size, unless pragma PACK is given. This applies even to boolean types or other types 
that require only a single bit for the representation of all values. 

5.42.4. Size Specification for Record Types 

A size specification for a record type does not influence the default type mapping of a record type. The size 
must be at least as large as the number of bits determined by type mapping. Influence over packing of com¬ 
ponents can be exerted by means of (partial) record representation clauses or by Pragma PACK. 

Neither the size of component types, nor the representation of component subtypes can be influenced by a 
length clause for a record. 

The only implementation-dependent components allocated by Tartan Ada in records contain dope information 
for arrays whose bounds depend on discriminants of the record or contain relative offsets of components within a 
record layout for record components of dynamic size. These implementation-dependent components cannot be 
named or sized by the user. 

A size specification cannot be applied to a record type with components of dynamically determined size. 

Note: Size specifications for records can be used only to widen the representation accomplished by padding at 
the beginning or end of the record. Any narrowing of the representation over default type mapping must be 
accomplished by representation clauses or pragma PACK. 

5.42.5. Specification of Collection Sizes 

The specification of a collection size causes the collection to be allocated with the specified size. It is 
expressed in storage units and need not be static; refer to package system for the meaning of storage units. 

Any attempt to allocate more objects than the collection can hold causes a STORAGE_ERROR exception to be 
raised. Dynamically sized records or arrays may carry hidden administrative storage requirements that must be 
accounted for as part of the collection size. Moreover, alignment constraints on the type of the allocated objects 
may make it impossible to use all memory locations of the allocated collection. No matter what the requested 
object size, the allocator must allocate a minimum of 2 words per object This lower limit is necessary for 
administrative overhead in the allocator. For example, a request of 5 words results in an allocation of 5 words; a 
request of 1 word results in an allocation of 2 words. 

In the absence of a specification of a collection size, the collection is extended automatically if more objects 
are allocated than possible in the collection originally allocated with the compiler-established default size. In this 
case, STORAGE_ERROR is raised only when the available target memory is exhausted. If a collection size of 
zero is specified, no access collection is allocated. 


5-6 




APPENDIX F TO MIL-STD-181JA 


5.42.6. Specification of Task Activation Size 

The specification of a task activation size causes the task activation to be allocated with the specified size. It 
is expressed in storage units; refer to package system for the meaning of storage units. 

Any attempt to exceed the activation size during execution causes a storage_error exception to be 
raised. Unlike collections, there is no extension of task activations. 

5.42.7. Specification of ' SMALL 

Only powers of 2 are allowed for ' SMALL. 

The length of the representation may be affected by this specification. If a size specification is also given for 
the type, the size specification takes precedence; the specification of ' SMALL must then be accommodatable 
within the specified size. 

5.4.3. Enumeration Representation Clauses 

For enumeration representation clauses [LRM 13.3], the following restrictions apply: 

• The internal codes specified for the literals of the enumeration type may be any integer value between 
INTEGER' FIRST and INTEGER' LAST. It is strongly advised to not provide a representation clause that 
merely duplicates the default mapping of enumeration types, which assigns consecutive numbers in as¬ 
cending order starting with 0, since unnecessary runtime cost is incurred by such duplication. It should be 
noted that the use of attributes on enumeration types with user-specified encodings is costly at run time. 

• Array types, whose index type is an enumeration type with non-con tiguous value encodings, consist of a 
contiguous sequence of components. Indexing into the array involves a runtime translation of the index 
value into the corresponding position value of the enumeration type. 

5.4.4. Record Representation Clauses 

The alignment clause of record representation clauses [LRM 13.4] is observed. 

Static objects may be aligned at powers of 2 up to a page boundary. The specified alignment becomes the 
minimum alignment of the record type, unless the minimum alignment of the record forced by the component 
allocation and the minimum alignment requirements of the components is already more stringent than the 
specified alignment 

The component clauses of record representation clauses are allowed only for components and discriminants 
of statically determinable size. Not all components need to be present Component clauses for components of 
variant parts are allowed only if the size of the record type is statically determinable for every variant 

The size specified for each component must be sufficient to allocate all possible values of the component 
subtype (but not necessarily the component type). The location specified must be compatible with any alignment 
constraints of the component type; an alignment constraint on a component type may cause an implicit alignment 
constraint on the record type itself. 

If some, but not all, discriminants and components of a record type are described by a component clause, then 
the discriminants and components without component clauses are allocated after those with component clauses; 
no attempt is made to utilize gaps left by th** user-provided allocation. 

5.4.5. Address clauses 

Address clauses [LRM 13.5] are supported with the following restrictions: 

• When applied to an object, an address clause becomes a linker directive to allocate the object at the given 
address. For any object not declared immediately within a top-level library package, the address clause is 
meaningless. Address clauses applied to local packages are not supported by Tartan Ada. Address clauses 
applied to library packages are prohibited by the syntax; therefore, an address clause can be applied to a 
package only if it is a body stub. 


5-7 





USER MANUAL FOR TARTAN ADA SUN 


• Address clauses applied to subprograms and tasks axe implemented according to the LRM rules. When 
applied to an entry, the specified value identifies an interrupt in a maimer explained in section 5.6. 

• A specified address must be an Ada static expression. 

5.4.6. Pragma PACK 

Pragma PACK [LRM 13.1] is supported. For details, refer to the following sections. 

5.4.6.1. Pragma PACK for Arrays 

If pragma PACK is applied to an array, the densest possible representation is chosen. For details of packing, 
refer to the explanation of size specifications for arrays (Section 5.4 23). 

If, in addition, a length clause is applied to 

1. The array type, the pragma has no effect, since such a length clause already uniquely determines the array 
packing method. 

2. The component type, the array is packed densely, observing the component’s length clause. Note that the 
component length clause may have the effect of preventing the compiler from packing as densely as 
would be the default if pragma PACK is applied where there was no length clause given for the com¬ 
ponent type. 

5.4.62. The Predefined Type String 

Package standard applies Pragma pack to the type string. 

However, when applied to character arrays, this pragma cannot be used to achieve denser packing than is the 
default for the target 1 character per 8-bit word. 

5.4.63. Pragma PACK for Records 

If pragma PACK is applied to a record, the densest possible representation is chosen that is compatible with 
the sizes and alignment constraints of the individual component types. Pragma pack has an effect only if the 
sizes of some component types are specified explicitly by size specifications and are of non-referable nature. In 
the absence of pragma pack, such components generally consume a referable amount of space. 

It should be noted that the default type mapping for records maps components of-boolean or other types that 
require only a single bit to a single bit in the record layout, if there are multiple such components in a record. 
Otherwise, it allocates a referable amount of storage to the component. 

If pragma PACK is applied to a record for which a record representation clause has been given detailing the 
allocation of some but not all components, the pragma PACK affects only the components whose allocation has 
not been detailed. Moreover, the strategy of not utilizing gaps between explicitly allocated components still 
applies. 

5.4.7. Minimal Alignment for Types 

Certain alignment properties of values of certain types are enforced by the type mapping rules. Any represen¬ 
tation specification that cannot be satisfied within these constraints is not obeyed by the compiler and is ap¬ 
propriately diagnosed. 

Alignment constraints are caused by properties of the target architecture, most notably by the capability to 
extract non-aligned component values from composite values in a reasonably efficient manner. Typically, restric¬ 
tions exist that make extraction of values that cross certain address boundaries very expensive, especially in 
contexts involving array indexing. Permitting data layouts that require such complicated extractions may impact 
code quality on a broader scale than merely in the local context of such extractions. 

Instead of describing the precise algorithm of establishing the minimal alignment of types, we provide the 
general rule that is being enforced by the alignment rules: 


5-8 





APPENDIX F TO MIL-STD-1815A 


• No object of scalar type including components or subcomponents of a composite type, may span a target- 
dependent address boundary that would mandate an extraction of the object's value to be performed by two 
or more extractions. 

5.5. IMPLEMENTATION-GENERATED COMPONENTS IN RECORDS 

The only implementadon-dependent components allocated by Tartan Ada in records contain dope information 
for arrays whose bounds depend on discriminants of the record. These components cannot be named by the user. 

5.6. INTERPRETATION OF EXPRESSIONS APPEARING IN ADDRESS CLAUSES 

Section 13.5.1 of the Ada Language Reference Manual describes a syntax for associating interrupts with task 
entries. Tartan Ada implements the address clause 
for TOENTRY use at intID; 

by associating the interrupt specified by intID with the toentry entry of the task containing this address 
clause. The interpretation of intID is both machine and compiler dependent 

Task entries can be bound to SunOS Signals via the for ._ use at clause. See man signal for an 
explanation of the SunOS signal mechanism. 

Using the address clause 
for _ use at SIGNAL_NUMBER 

signals such as Control C can be bound to Ada handlers which allow for continuation of program execution, or 
orderly termination at the user’s discretion. An example of trapping Control C (SIGINT ex' 2) to an Ada handler 
follows: 

with SYSTEM; use SYSTEM; 
with text_io; use text_io; 

procedure int2 is 
task taskA is 
entry P; 
for P use at 2; 
end taskA; 
task body taskA is 
begin 

Put_Line("Package Interrupt Test"); 
loop 

accept P do 

Put_Line("Ada found SIGINT (Control C)”); 

end; 

end loop; 
end taskA; 

begin 

for i in 1..30 loop 
delay 1.0; 
end loop; 
abort taskA; 
end int2; 

All currently recognized SunOS signals may be bound to task entries, with the signal numbers ranging from 1 
to 31. In cases where the Ada runtimes assume a default operation for a given signal, the user’s Ada trap may 
prevent normal execution of Ada programs. 

The most critical example of this situation is in the case SIGALRM, that is, the SunOS Alarm Gock signal. 
The Ada runtimes use this signal to allow delayed tasks to wake up on schedule. If the user overwrites this 
handler with a replacement SIGALRM handler, no tasks may be delayed. Undesirable, and, depending upon the 
user’s program, unknown execution will result SIGALRM may be sucessfully mapped to a user’s Ada handler in 


5-9 






USER MANUAL FOR TARTAN ADA SUN 


cases where no tasks are delayed and the user would like to "wake up" the task entry that serves as the SIGALRM 
handler via the SIGALRM mechanism. 

Other examples of default runtime functions for certain signals all involve the mapping of signals into Ada 
exceptions. The user has the option, for these signals, to place a new signal handler in the Ada exception, or to 
override the raise of the Ada exception, by writing a replacement handler for the signal. Currently, signals which 
raise Ada exceptions are sigemt, which raises NUMERIC_ERROR, and SIGFPE, which raises 
RUNTIME_ERROR. 

Currendy, for all signals other than those mentioned above, there is no default handler, and a raise of the 
signal by the operating system will result in the behavior as described in the SunOS manual for that signal. In 
most cases, this is an abrupt termination of the program, possibly resulting in a core image dump. 

5.7. RESTRICTIONS ON UNCHECKED CONVERSIONS 

Tartan supports UNCHECKED_C0NVERSl0N with a restriction that requires the sizes of both source and 
target types to be known at compile time. The sizes need not be the same. If the value in the source is wider than 
that in the target, the source value will be truncated. If narrower, it will be zero-extended. Calls on instantiations 
of UNCH£CKED_CONVERS I ON are made inline automatically. 

5.8. IMPLEMENTATION-DEPENDENT ASPECTS OF INPUT-OUTPUT PACKAGES 

Tartan Ada supports all predefined input/output packages [LRM Chapter 14] with the exception of 
LOW_LEVEL_IO. 

SEQUENTIAL_IO and DIRECT_IO may not be instantiated on types whose representation size is greater 
than 32255 bytes. Any attempt to read or write values of such types raises USEJERROR. 

SEQUENT I AL_IO and DIRECT_IO may not be instantiated on unconstrained array types, nor on record 
record types with discriminants without default values. 

An attempt to delete an external file while more than one internal file refers to this external file raises 
USE_ERROR. 

When an external file is referenced by more than one internal file, an attempt to reset one of those internal 
files to out_file raises usejsrror. 

An attempt to create a file with file_mode in_file raises use_error. 

Since the implementation of the input-output packages uses buffers, output to one file cannot necessarily be 
read immediately from another file associated with the same external file. 

The form parameter of file management subprograms is ignored. 

An attempt to read a non-existent data record through the operations of sequential_io or DIRECT_I0 
raises DATA_ERROR, except that END_ERROR is raised when reading beyond the end of file. 

If a SunOS system call returns an en-or number that cannot be mapped onto a predefined Ada exception, the 
exception DEViCE_ERROR is raised. 

5.9. OTHER IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS 

The following information is supplied in addition to thai required by Appendix F to MIL-STD-1815A. 

5.9.1. Definition of a Mean Program 

Any Ada library subprogram unit may be designated the main program for purposes of linking (using the 
adalib link command) provided that the subprogram has no parameters. 

Tasks initiated in imported library units follow the same rules for termination as other tasks [described in 
LRM 9.4 (6-10)]. Specifically, these tasks are not terminated simply beca u se the main program has terminated. 
Terminate alternatives in selective wait statements in library tasks are therefore strongly recommended. 


5-10 






APPENDIX F TO MIL-STD-1815A 


5.92. Implementation of Generic Units 

All instantiations of generic units, except the predefined generic UNCHECKED_CONVERSION and 
unchecked_deallocat I ON subprograms, are implemented by code duplications. No attempt at sharing 
code by multiple instantiations is made in this release of Tartan Ada. 

Tartan Ada enforces the restriction that the body of a generic unit must be compiled before the unit can be 
instantiated. It does not impose the restriction that the specification and body of a generic unit must be provided 
as part of the same compilation. A recompilation of the body of a generic unit will casue any units that 
instantiated this generic unit to become obsolete. 

5.9.3. Implementation-Defined Characteristics in Package STANDARD
