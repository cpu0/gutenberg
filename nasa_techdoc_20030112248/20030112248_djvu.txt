Coupling Between Microstrip Lines With Finite Width 
Ground Plane Embedded in Thin Film Circuits

Abstract— Three-dimensional (3D) interconnects built upon multiple layers of polyimide are required for constructing 3D circuits on 
CMOS (low resistivity) Si wafers, GaAs, and ceramic substrates. Thin film microstrip lines (TFMS) with finite width ground planes 
embedded in the polyimide are often used. However, the closely spaced TFMS lines are susceptible to high levels of coupling, which 
degrades circuit performance. In this paper, Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) analysis and experimental measurements are 
used to show that the ground planes must be connected by via holes to reduce coupling in both the forward and backward directions. 
Furthermore, it is shown that coupled microstrip lines establish a slotline type mode between the two ground planes and a dielectric 
waveguide type mode, and that the via holes recommended here eliminate these two modes.

I. Introduction 

Demand is growing for Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuits (MMICs) and packaged MMICs with greater functionality, 
lower cost, and smaller size. Furthermore, the digital processing and control functions of the system are now often incorporated 
into the same package as the analog circuits and MMICs, However, consumer, military, and aerospace components must fit into 
smaller areas. Thus, two-dimensional packages are no longer suitable for many of these applications. Instead, three-dimensional 
(3D) packages and integration technologies are required. 

A widely used, low cost technology that is currently used for packaging individual circuits and integrated systems is Low 
Temperature Cofired Ceramic (LTCC). By laminating multiple layers of thick (0.1-0.15 mm) ceramic sheets with thick film 
metal lines on each layer and metal filled via holes to interconnect the various layers, complex 3D circuits are possible [1-3]. An 
alternative multi-layer packaging technology is commonly called Multi-Chip Module-Deposited (MCM-D) [4-6] or High 
Density Interconnect (HDI) [7] that consists of multiple layers of thin film polyimide deposited onto a ceramic carrier. Portions

of a thin film metal circuit are fabricated on each layer of polyimide and interconnected by etched via holes. MMICs and 
Integrated Circuits (ICs) may be attached to the upper polyimide layer after the final layer is deposited, or they may be placed in 
wells etched into the ceramic carrier. Instead of thin, deposited polyimide layers on ceramic and flip chip or wire bonded 
circuits, higher levels of integration and circuit variability are possible by depositing polyimide directly onto GaAs [8,9] and Si 
[10,1 1] substrates with all of the circuitry monolithically fabricated on the same wafer. In this way, passive circuit components, 
which occupy most of the area of ICs and MMICs, and antennas may be placed over the active circuits that are fabricated on the 
semiconductor. Another advantage of thin film polyimides on Si is that microwave passive elements and transmission lines 
placed directly on standard CMOS and BiCMOS grade Si, which have resistivities of 1 and 20 Q-cm respectively, have low 
quality factors (high attenuation), which necessitates novel transmission line structures [12] that are typically embedded in the 
polyimide. 

Achieving sufficient isolation between transmission lines embedded in multi-layer substrates is critical for proper 
circuit/system performance. However, when transmission lines are close together, direct coupling between them is high, and in 
multilayer circuits where transmission lines may be under each other, the coupling is even higher [13]. In addition to direct 
coupling, transmission lines on isotropic and anisotropic substrates may excite surface waves on the substrate that will leak 
power away fi-om the excited line and couple it to other lines on the substrate. It has also been shown that these leaky, surface 
wave modes may have an electromagnetic field distribution that resembles the field distribution of a microstrip line near the line 
[14]. Thus, it is easily excited in circuits. 

A commonly used transmission line in these multi-layer circuits and packages is microstrip or, as it is called when 
implemented on thin films, Thin Film Microstrip (TFMS). When used on Si CMOS and BiCMOS circuits, the ground plane 
shields the electromagnetic fields from the lossy Si [12], which provides a low loss transmission line. Coupling between 
microstrip lines with infinite ground planes built on Low Temperature Cofired Ceramic (LTCC) [15] and embedded in 
polyimide [16,17] with shielding structures built into the substrate have been thoroughly characterized. However, in many of 
these 3D circuits and packages, a finite width ground plane is used to enable higher levels of integration, and on LTCC packages 
where a high percentage of the ceramic must be open to ensure ceramic bonding and control shrinkage, finite width ground 
planes are required. TFMS with finite width ground planes has a higher loss than conventional microstrip lines, but, if the 
ground plane is greater than 3 to 5 times the strip width, acceptable attenuation is achieved [18]. Also, by reducing the ground 
plane width, ground planes may be placed on different layers to give another design option. For example, antenna radiation 
characteristics are modified by changing the ground plane dimensions of microstrip patch antennas [19]-[21].

Coupling between finite width ground plane microstrip lines embedded in polyimide has been experimentally investigated 
[22]. However, [22] raised questions about parasitic modes that could not be answered experimentally. In this paper, an analysis 
of the coupling between TFMS lines with finite width ground planes embedded in polyimide built upon CMOS grade Si is 
presented. This analysis includes a comparison of the coupling between transmission lines built on different layers of polyimide, 
and the use of metal filled via posts to connect ground planes on different layers. An emphasis is placed on a Finite Difference 
Time Domain (FDTD) analysis of the lines to understand the parasitic modes and their role in the coupling characteristics, 

II. Circuit Description 



Fig. 1 shows a cross sectional cut through two variations of microstrip lines embedded in polyimide upon a Si substrate. 
TFMS lines are characterized with ground plane widths of 3 and 5 times the strip width. Wl, W2, and W3 are 23 ^m, 52 jam, 
and 25 ^m respectively to yield 50 Q transmission lines for the polyimide thickness, h, of 10 ^m, As was proposed in [22] and 
will be expanded upon here, there is an advantage to connecting the two ground planes. Thus, in several coupled microstrip lines 
and in the FDTD analysis, the two ground planes on different layers are connected by a single row of 20 |im by 20 jam via holes 
spaced 100 jim apart, which is a via spacing less than one hundredth of a wavelength at 25 GHz. To accomplish this when the 
ground planes did not overlap, the ground planes were extended in one direction so that they overlapped by 20 ^m. The 
parameter C is the distance between the centerlines of the two TFMS lines. 

For the experimental characterization, a four-port circuit is used for measuring the coupling between the microstrip lines with 
probe pads orientated so that each port may be probed simultaneously with the port numbering as shown in Fig. 2, The 90 
degree bends are not required for the FDTD analysis. The coupling region, or the section of parallel transmission lines labeled L 
in Fig. 2, is 5000 ^im long for the experimental characterization, but the coupling length was varied from 3000 to 5000 jam for 
the FDTD analysis. While these are physically short lines, they have an electrical length between 180° and 270° at 25 GHz, 
which is required for rat-race, hybrid, and Wilkinson dividers. Longer lines, which would have higher coupling, would be 
required for antenna feed networks.

III. Theoretical Analysis 

The full-wave FDTD technique [23] is used for the theoretical characterization of the forward and backward coupling, S31 and 
S41 respectively, between the two parallel microstrip lines. The E- and H-field components are implemented in a leapfrog 
configuration. An adaptive grid with neighboring cell aspect ratio smaller or equal to 2 maintains a second-order global 
accuracy. 

Numerical meshes of 80-120 by 45 by 250 cells terminated with 10 Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) cells in each direction 
provide accurate results for a time-step of At=0.99Atmax- A Gaussian pulse with fmax-60 GHz is applied vertically as a soft source 
close to the fi-ont end of the microstrip, and its values get superimposed on the FDTD calculated field value for all cells in the 
excitation region for each time-step. The via holes are modeled as rectangular metal tubes with cross-section 23x20 |im. To 
account for the excitation of different modes in the microstrip lines, two simulations are performed for each geometry exciting 
both lines with equal amplitude and even or odd space distributions respectively. In addition, both microstrip lines are 
terminated with matched loads (Zo=50 Q) that are realized as the combination of shunt resistors placed between the microstrip 
and the bottom ground [24]. Probes placed at the front end and at the far end of one line are used for the combination of the 



results of the even and of the odd simulations. The application of the FFT algorithm derives the frequency-domain results from 
the time-domain data (usually 20,000 time-steps). 

As will be seen in a later section, multiple modes propagate along the coupled line. Therefore, to assure that the microstrip 
mode characteristics are being measured, two probes, equally spaced to the left and right of the center of the microstrip line are 
used and the average of those two probe voltages yields the microstrip mode voltage. 

IV. Circuit Fabrication and Characterization 

The four port microstrip circuits are fabricated on a 1 Q-cm Si wafer. The lowest level ground plane consisting of a 300 A Ti 
adhesion layer, 1.5 jim of Au, and a 200 A Cr cap layer is first evaporated onto the Si wafer. Then, Dupont adhesion promoter 
and 10 jam of Dupont PI-261 1 polyimide, which has a relative dielectric constant, Cr, of 3,12 measured at I MHz [25] and a loss 
tangent of 0.002 measured at 1 kHz [26], is spun onto the wafer. After curing the polyimide at 340 C for 120 minutes, a Ni mask 
is evaporated and patterned on the polyimide for the O2/CF4 reactive ion etching (RIE) of the via holes. After the via holes are 
etched and the Ni removed, 200 A of Ti and 2000 A of Au are sputtered onto the wafer to serve as a seed layer for the 1.3 jam of 
Au electroplating that is used to define the embedded microstrip lines and fill the via holes in a single step. This Au is capped 
with 200 A of Cr before applying the next layer of polyimide. Thus, all metal structures are 1.5 jim thick. This process is 
repeated for each layer of polyimide. A DEKTAK sixrface profile and an SEM analysis of the polyimide and metal strips show 
that the surface roughness is low enough that it can be neglected in the analysis. 

Measurements are made on an HP8510C vector network analyzer from I to 50 GHz. A Thru/Reflect/Line (TRL) calibration is 
implemented with MULTICAL [27], a TRL software program, using four delay lines of 1800, 2400, 4800, and 10000 ^im and a 
short circuit reflect fabricated on the same substrate as the circuits. To improve accuracy, each circuit is measured several times 
and the average of those measurements is presented in this paper. Two of the four ports are terminated in 50 Q loads built into 
especially designed RF probes during testing of the coupling circuits. 

V. Microstrip Characteristics 

The measured effective permittivity, Sem and attenuation of the microstrip lines embedded in polyimide are shown in Fig. 3. It 
is seen that for f< 40 GHz, lines of width Wl and W3, which have nearly identical width, have similar attenuation, and the 
microstrip line with width W2, which uses the entire polyimide thickness for its substrate, has lower loss. However, above 40 
GHz, the loss of the wider line on the thicker substrate is higher. This is probably due to higher radiation loss for the wider 
microstrip line. The effective permittivity of the completely embedded line, Wl, is equal to the relative permittivity of the 
polyimide at high frequency.

VL Microstrip Coupling 

The measured and FDTD analysis results for the embedded microstrip lines are compared across the frequency band of 1 to 50 
GHz for a typical case in Fig, 4. There is very good agreement with a maximum difference of 3 dB. Thus, conclusions from 
either technique may be assumed to be correct. Throughout the paper, the forward coupling is defined as -20Iog|S3i| and the 
backward coupling is -201og|S4i|. Measured forward and backward coupling of TFMS Hues is summarized in Fig. 5a and 5b 
respectively. It is seen that coupling decreases nearly linearly as C increases, decreases by 3 to 5 dB as the ground plane 
increases from 3 to 5W, and is 3 to 5 dB lower for the coupled TFMS of Fig. la. Thus, to improve isolation, a wider ground 
plane and thinner microstrip substrates are desirable. Note that these results are for widely spaced transmission lines (C/h>5), 

Returning to Fig. 4, it is noted that IS31I increases monotonically with frequency, but it does not increase smoothly as is typical 
of coupling between two TEM transmission lines [28] and coupled microstrip lines [17]. Backward coupling, IS41I, of two TEM 
transmission lines should have a series of maxima of the same magnitude and a periodicity dependent on the coupling length, L. 
However, as seen in Fig. 4, IS41I has a periodic frequency dependence and a component that increases monotonically with 
frequency. Both of these characteristics is an indication that there are two components of coupling, direct coupling and indirect 
coupling through phantom circuits or, as they are now commonly called, parasitic modes [28], This is not surprising because the 
coupled, finite width ground plane microstrip lines shown in Fig. 1 have four metal lines, which supports three independent 
TEM modes if the media was homogeneous. In addition, because the 3D-circuits consist of layers of low permittivity material 
over the higher permittivity Si, slab waveguide/dielectric waveguide modes are possible. Thus, indirect coupling through 
phantom circuits is expected. 

To reduce the number of modes, the two ground planes may be connected with via holes. It may be surmised that a coupled 
strip or slotline type mode propagates along the two coupled ground planes, and this mode is shorted by the metal intercormects. 



In [22], it was experimentally shown that connecting the two ground planes reduces coupling by 5 dB for a 5000 |Lim long 
coupled line section. FDTD analysis of 3000 jam long coupled lines, which is shown in Fig. 6, shows that the via posts reduces 
the effects of the parasitic modes. Note that IS41I is now periodic with frequency and IS31I increases smoothly with frequency for 
both cases (Fig la and Fig lb).

VII. Electromagnetic Fields of Coupled Lines 

While the measured and FDTD analysis coupling characteristics, IS31I and IS41I, support conclusions that connecting the 
ground planes of microstrip lines with finite width ground planes greatly decreases coupling and eliminates or reduces the 
magnitude of parasitic modes, this conclusion has not been proven. FDTD analysis is capable of mapping the electric and 
magnetic fields of coupled microstrip lines and separating them into the various modes by using cross-sectional probes for 
specific frequencies and identifying the differentiating features of the different modes. Figures 7 through 10 show the electric 
and magnetic fields for two cases of coupled lines shown in Fig. 1 both with and without via posts. The electric fields for the 
lines without via posts shown in Figs. 7a and 9a show high fields between the ground plane and silicon substrate of the coupled 
line. Similarly, Figs. 7b and 9b show there are high magnetic fields between the ground planes of two microstrip lines. Lastly, 
the electric fields under the coupled line and between the ground planes are stronger for the coupled lines shown in Fig lb. With 
the via posts, the fields between the two ground planes are completely eliminated, and the electric field under the ground plane 
of the coupled line is reduced. The effect is more prominent for larger spacing C between the lines (C=l 15 um vs. C=92 urn) 
that allows for the easier excitation of the slotline mode between the grounds. These qualitative observations indicate two 
parasitic modes: the first is a dielectric waveguide type mode and the second is a slotline type mode between the two ground 
planes. The via posts reduce or eliminate both of these modes.

microstrip mode 




Figure 11: Probe locations for determination of coupled microstrip modes. Probes 1 and 2 are the average of two probes spaced equal distant 
from center of line as shown above right hand side microstrip. Probe 4 is equal distance between the left and right microstrip lines. Probe 3 is 
directly under the ground plane of the left line. 



The field plots and the conclusions derived from them indicate the elimination of two parasitic modes. To confirm the 
existence of these modes and the effect of the via posts, the effective permittivity and magnitude of the electric field at 25 GHz 



14 

at locations shown in Fig. 11 are measured and shown in Table 1. First, note that, qualitatively, the Egff of microstrip lines Wl 
and W3 shown in Table 1 agree with the measured values shown in Fig. 3. The FDTD analysis did not account for metal loss 
and therefore the effects of internal inductance on Egff are not included. Thus a quantitative agreement cannot be obtained. 
Second, the addition of via posts does not change the Ceff of the two microstrip modes, which indicates that the microstrip modes 
are not effected by the via posts. The 3 dB reduction in magnitude of the electric field for probe 2, the coupled microstrip line, 
with via post is a measure of the reduction in coupling that was presented in Fig. 6a. The mode detected by probe 3 has an Eeff 
greater than the Sr of the polyimide, which indicates a mode that propagates in the silicon wafer and the polyimide below the 
ground plane. The via post reduces the magnitude of this mode by approximately 10 dB. In addition, the higher value of its Eeff 
for the via-enabled geometry indicates that in this case, most of this mode is eliminated from the via-shielded lower 8r polyimide 
and is concentrated in the silicon substrate. Because the 8eff measured by probe 4 is nearly equal to the £r of the polyimide, it is 
surmised that this is a slotline type mode between the two ground planes. This conclusion is supported by the elimination of this 
mode when the two ground planes are connected by via posts. However, without the via posts, this slotline mode is stronger than 
the microstrip mode in the coupled microstrip line. Other modes have magnitudes too small to influence the characteristics. 

VI. Conclusion 

In this paper, theoretical analysis and measured characteristics show that parallel, thin film microstrip lines with finite width 
ground planes support and excite multiple modes, which degrades the isolation between the lines. By interconnecting the two 
ground planes with via posts, two of these parasitic modes are reduced or eliminated. One of the modes is a dielectric waveguide 
type mode that the via posts reduce by 10 dB. The other is a slotline type mode that is very strongly excited in the coupled lines 
without via posts. These resuhs show that if finite width groimd plane microstrip lines are used for 3D-MMICs and thin film 
packages, it is advisable to connect the ground planes periodically with metal filled via posts and to use a wider ground plane 
width for higher isolation. Although these conclusions are based on experimental and theoretical analysis of thin film polyimide 
layers on silicon, they may be extended to other 3D circuits and packaging structures that include multiple materials.
