Early Life: 

• I was born and raised in Cuba. 

• Oldest of three childr^ ^boys / Igi: 

• Liked electronics and^^^t™# 

age (can't remember when it started). 

• Learned first computer language when I w 

(Pascal) and no one uses it anymore. ^ 

• Moved to Miami, FL when I was about to turn 16 
years old and have been there ever since. 




First Words: 

"Tornillo" and "Croqueta" 




E 



• Southwest Miami Senior High School 

High school Diploma (Spring 2010) 

• Florida International University 

BS Electrical Engineering (Spring 2014) 

MS Computer Engineering (In progress) 





Why you brought me in: 

(back from a time no one remembers) 




Crew Interface Systems(CIS) Mission Data Loads(MDL) Inputs 

What they are: 

• They are files that contained some of the data shown in the crew Displays. 

What did I do: 

• Familiarize myself with what they are. 

• Convened and led meetings to discuss the content and data. 

• Identified issues with structure and missing parts. 

• Integrated the data generators with the flight software coders to develop a data structure that will contain all necessary data and be 

formatted to be Ingested correctly Into the flight software for release 

• Validation with interested parties (CIS, Crew and Mission Systems(CMS), Mission Operations (MO), Avionlcs and Software (AV&SW), 
Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC), and others). 


What did you get from this (MO/Boeing): 

• An understanding of how MDLs work and what they are. 

• An actual set of working data. 

• Save money 

• Save time 

What did I get from this: 

• Expanded my knowledge (very little in the beginning) of spacecraft systems. 

• Got to interact with smart/outstanding people. 

• Learned what an MDL was. 

• Learned how to lead Engineering meetings. 


Landing Site Tool 

I , , * ‘ 

What theyare: 

• It is a tool that collects landing site information fcom an spreadsheet and generates an input file (Keyhole Markup Language KML) for 

Google Earth and MDLs for the spacecraft. ' ' ' . 

% ' ' . • • • 

% % • 

What did I do: . 

• Coordinated with GNC subject matter expertsfSMEs). . ' . 

• Learned how CST-100 chooses a landing site and what information it needs. . 

• Learned what KML files are and how they are structured. • ' . ' . « 

• Familiarized myself with the spacecraft fVIDLs structure and information. ■ ' . . 

• Developed a tool that takes in information about the landing sites and generates a KML file for Google Earth overlay and MDLs for 

CST-100. J 

’ ~ ; 

What did you get from this (MO/Boeing): | 

• A tool that generates visual representations ofithe landing site shapes and locations. 

• A configuration management(CM) tool that allows you to maintain information for multiple files in a single source. 

• Saved time and money. 

What did I get from this: 

• Expanded my knowledge of spacecraft systems; how GNC deorbits and lands the spacecraft. 

• Learned how landing sites are prioritized. 

• Learned what KML is and how it works. 

• Got to interact with smart/outstandfng people. 

• Lead Engineering meetings. 




Onboard Flight Manager(OFM) Mission Data Load(MDL) Inputs 

(I'm told this was a huge one) • • 

What they are: 

• OFM is the onboard flight manager which tells the vehicle what to do during flight, the MDL contains instructions that OFM will 
follow. ' \ • 


What did I do: . 

Coordinated with GNC, CMS, MO, and FSW subject matter experts(SMEs). ' 

Learned how CST-lOO's OFM is designecTand how it works. • • • 

Familiarized myself with the OFM MDLs stn|cture and information. 

Convened meetings between AV&SW, CMS. a nd MO to fix/resolve issues with the OFM MDL Workbook (WB). 
Developed java tools that ingest mission s^cific data and populates the OMF MDL WB. 

Created and went through peer review pr 0 cesses.and presented at the Spacecraft Integration Operations Panel (SlOP). 


What did you get from this (MO/Boeing): 

* An understanding and a process to fill in/populate the OFM MDL WB. 

* An interim tool (while we wait for a formal tool) to generate the WB. 

* Save precious time and money. 



What did I get from this: 

• Got to know how CST-100 operates and how OFM was designed and its operation 

• Perfected mediation abilities. 

• More Java experience. 


MDT DispIsyS (fun for e¥€ryorie) 

What they are: 

• tVIOT (MOD Display Tool) is a new tool for building Mission Control Displays that will be used for MCC-21 (the new version of the 

control center) and for the CST-100 missions. 

What did I do: 

• Tracked down and MDT manual and the MDT developers. 

• Learned how to efficiently code in MDT. 

• Collaborated/integrated with subsystems SMEs to understand CST-lOO subsystems and other divisions. 

• Familiarized myself with CST-lOO subsystems (EPS, ECLSS, NDS, GMC, ...). 

• Familiarized myself with CST-lOO crew displays. 

• Developed Emulated Crew Displays. 

• Taught coworkers how to use MDT and build displays.

• Free MDT classes © 

What did I get from this: 

• Learned MDT language. 

• Got super familiarized with CST-lOO subsystems; specially Electrical Power Systems (EPS). Huge plus for me ©. 

• Some of the code I developed will be used in new MCC tools and applications, (for posterity) 



XTCE Tool (Michael's) 

What they are: 

• The XTCE(XML Telemetry and Command Exchange) tool (developed by Boeing/Mlchael Nieves) takes telemetry and command 
Information from Boeing's CCTsdB and creates an XTCE report to be ingested by NASA's MO. 

What did I do: 

• Learned XTCE. 

• Get more familiarized with the CCTsdB. 

• Identify XTCE schema issues/vioiations in the report and database data errors. 

• Work with CMS and MO to tackle and fixes the issues. 

What did you get from this (MO/Boeing): 

• A more accurate reporting tool. 

• A working/valid XTCE report. 

• Saved time and money (thousands if not millions of $$ ©). 

• Made people's lives easier. 

What did I get from this: 

• Learned XTCE and how NASA and Boeing manage telemetry. 

• More Java practice. 

• Refined mediation abilities. (Almost a meeting expert by now ®) 



Duties As Assigned(AKA: small stuff) 

Deploying MDT Displays into MSOE (IViission Support Development Environment) and MSE (Mission Support Environment) for Boeing' 

trainers 

• This allows the Boing Training Simulation at Tower II to EOD (Exceed on Demand) into the MCC and run the displays that the flight 
controllers would see. 

Ops History Proxy 

• This was a proxy application I developed to be able to notify interested parties when documents were developed to OpsHistory 
without them having to be logged in into the system while they wait. 

• It saved time and money because we didn't have to outsource the development. 

Updating Risk Macros 

• There are some Macros that MO (Susan Beisert) uses to ingest Athena DB reports and generate Risk Reports. 

• These macros stop working on don't work correctly every time the DB reports change. 

• Every time the reports changes I modified the macros so they would work again. 

• Modified the macros to add some more information to the Risk Reports. 




. Because I 

wasn't busy 
^ enough and 

was often 

• S • 

found slacking 
around. 


I was allowed to go work 
for the Engineering 
Directorate (ER) over at 
buiidin^36.
