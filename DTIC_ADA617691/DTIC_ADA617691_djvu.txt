Project Scheduling Tool for Maintaining Capability 
Interdependencies and Defence Program Investment: A User's 

Guide 

Executive Summary 

Defence decision-makers are faced with the problem of scheduling and allocating funds 
to sustain the capability priorities identified by the organisation. Subsequently, an 
integrated Defence Capability Plan (DCP) is then prepared based on these capability 
development directions. The DCP is a living document influenced by a range of domestic 
and international factors. It contains projects and sub-projects which have a large number 
of interdependencies between their milestones. Any change to the DCP or a desire to find 
potential savings in the early years of the planning horizon brings about a rescheduling 
requirement. 

This may be viewed as a complex, multi-criteria decision problem that is amenable 
to balance of investment mathematical approaches directed at maintaining capability 
interdependences. Our mathematical programming approach is designed and imple¬ 
mented as a scheduling tool using public software to allow the required calculations to be 
completely automated. A typical analysis and numerical experiment are demonstrated 
with general guidelines to consider when using the scheduler software. 

The Scheduler is a software product which has the capability to conduct the following 
studies: 

• What is the maximum funding saving that can be achieved without violating any 
constraints? 

• What is a less disruptive reschedule of the current investment program that 
achieves almost the maximum saving found above? 

• How does one obtain other reschedules that meet various levels of funding saving 
with minimum changes? 

• How can various proposed schedules be compared and visualised in both tabular 
and graphical form? 

• How can the results be captured at any stage and export to other tools for different 
analysis types? 

The User guide provides help to minimise possible trouble by stating the actions that 
must be followed in using the scheduler. Implementing these actions will ensure that the 
scheduler will function as expected.

1 Introduction 

The Project Scheduling Tool which, is comprised of mathematical models implementa¬ 
tion and results visualisation & comparison, has been created as a practical companion 
to the technical paper titled An Approach for Maintaining Capability Interdependencies and 
Budgeting Program Investment [ 0]. The technical paper presents a mathematical Integer 
Linear Programming (ILP) technique used in Project Management, whereas the tool 
provides the opportunity to implement its proposed mathematical models for project 
scheduling & investment problems and to numerically solve them with various decision 
goals as well as to visualise and compare its found solutions. 

The Scheduler is a software product which has the capability to conduct the following 
studies: 

• What is the maximum funding saving that can be achieved without violating any 
constraints? 

• What is a less disruptive reschedule of the current investment program that 
achieves almost the maximum saving found above? 

• How does one obtain other reschedules that meet various levels of funding saving 
with minimum changes? 

• How can various proposed schedules be compared and visualised in both tabular 
and graphical form? 

• How can the results be captured at any stage and export to other tools for different 
analysis types? 

Noticeably, determining an optimal solution to this funding allocation scheduling 
problem has features in common with the knapsack problem [ , page 468]. The 
knapsack problem involves maximising the benefit from the contents of a knapsack, 
given a range of possible items that can be selected. Each item has a defined benefit 
and weight, while the knapsack itself has a total weight limit. There are extensions of 
this basic knapsack model in [1, 5, 13] and references therein. 

Here the Defence capability interdependency and funding allocation scheduling problem 
involves minimising the total number of funding changes to the current program investment 
of some Defence capability projects, while meeting budget guidance and maintaining 
the capability interdependency requirements. The Defence problem has an additional 
temporal dimension which is not present in the knapsack problem. In the knapsack 
problem, a resource is selected and used once in a given time period. However, in the 
funding allocation scheduling problem, the resource has been funded for multiple years. 
The Defence model also differs from the above by the nature of the objective functions 
and the proposed multi-stages analysis. 

The Norwegian Defence Research Establishment developed a stochastic model for this 
type of problem by considering the uncertainty of future-year budgets [4]. In our 
problem, project funding profiles are given and maximising funding saving is one of 
the decision goals. Therefore, we can restrict ourselves here to the deterministic model.

with discounted costs to cover an effect of variation on the budget. Our data structures 
for collection and model formulation are thus simple to implement. A decision support 
tool with model variation, result visualisation and comparison is also developed. 

Our previous work on a similar scheduling problem for Defence Logistics Funding [9] 
also developed a decision support tool. The project scheduling tool, by contrast differs 
from the past work by incorporating capability interdependencies and various analysis 
features within a single program. 

The free, open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) NetBeans [11] was 
used in the creation of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the tool. The external 
mathematical programming solver GLPK [8] and the Statistical Package R [6] are the 
main engines for solving mathematical models and analysing results. As with any piece 
of software, there may be bugs remaining in the code. To date the program has not been 
coded by professional programmers and has not undergone extensive verification and 
validation; it has been developed only for demonstration purpose. 

The scheduler was designed for use by people who have a knowledge of the method¬ 
ologies being used; and it is expected that they are familiar with the accompanying 
paper [10]. Our intention is not to release this software into the Public Domain, but to 
provide support to DSTO colleagues or Defence staff who might need it. 

The documentation also provides help to minimise possible trouble by stating the actions 
that must be followed in using the scheduler. Implementing these actions will ensure that 
the scheduler will function as expected . 


2 Getting Started 

2.1 Installation of the Project Scheduling Tool 



Figure 1: Installation of the Project Scheduling Tool 

To install the Project Scheduling Tool 1 , follow the steps below: 

1 This User guide refers to the installation of version 1.4 of Project Scheduling Tool released on May 2014.

DSTO-GD-0843 


1. Download the zip file 2 ProjectScheduler.zip. 

2. Unzip it to get the executable file ProjectScheduler.exe. 

3. Double-click the executable file to start the installation process. The screen shown 
in Figure 1 is displayed in which the user can enter the installation path if another 
location is required. 

4. Click the OK button. The tool will be extracted to the specified directory and 
automatically launched shortly. 

2.2 Packaging external tools and Java Runtime Environment 
(JRE) 

Notably, the two external tools, the mathematical programming solver GLPK [ 8 ] and the 
Statistical Package R [6] have been packaged into the above installation program. 

Also a JRE 1.6 (or higher version) is used for running the tool. For compatibility, it is 
included in this installation program. Newer JRE versions can be downloaded from 
http://www.oracle.com/us/downloads/index.html. 


3 Exploring Model Data 

This section of the document aims to guide the user to perform an update of the model 
data. The scheduler provides a full sample set of the model data, and the user can 
immediately run and test the tool. To create and update the model data, go to the 

directory InstaNation_Path\files\input and replace the required Comma-Separated Values 

(CSV) files. 

If one wanted to use the data source from Program Viewer [12] (a visualisation approach 
for information integration of projects and capabilities, from a number of different 
perspectives), then an extract data module can be set up and linked to Program Viewer 
for generating all CSV files automatically (see [ ] for the detail of such a set-up). 

Alternately, a manual process for data collection can be done as described below. There 
are currently six categories of data implemented. 


3.1 Project Milestones 

All projects data are stored in the DCP.csv file. As the tool lists the projects in the 
Defence Capability Plan (DCP) [ l] and Defence Capability Guide 3 (DCG) [2], the data in 
DCP.csv file contains the following project milestone dates: (1) First Pass Approval (FPA); 

2 The exact location of the file on the DSTO Community Portal can be obtained by contacting M.-T. 
Nguyen, minh-tuan.nguyen@dsto.defence.gov.au. 

3 the DCG is a new document and provides general guidance for industry on projects for the six year 
period following the four years Forward Estimates (FE) period of the DCP.

(2) Year Of Decision (YOD); (3) Initial Operational Capability (IOC) and (4) Final 
Operational Capability (FOC). The date value is the number of years counting from the 
study/analysis year. For example, if the requested analysis year is 2014 and the YOD of 
Project n is 2024, then we record YOD„ = 10. Below is the sample of DCP.csv file content: 

Listing 1: Sample data in DCP.csv 

Id , P roj e ct , FPA, YOD, IOC , FOC, Rem a rks 

1, P01,1,2,11,12,xxx 

2. P02.1,2,5,6,xxx 


Listing 1 shows here two DCP project records named P01 and P02 with the same FPA 
and YOD, but different IOC and FOC. These projects are assigned to the index 1 and 2, 
respectively, for cross-referencing in other data sets. 


3.2 Asset Milestones 

Asset data, e.g. Key Defence Asset (KDA) is managed by Defence Materiel Organi¬ 
sation (DMO), and is stored in the DMO.csv file. One of the important milestones of 
the KDA is the Planned Withdrawal Date (PWD). The date value is counted from the 
study/analysis year. 

Listing 2: Sample data in DMO.csv 

Id , Asset ,PWD 

1, A01,1 

2, A02,9 


3.3 Funding Data 

A multi-year estimated funding given profile of all projects is placed in the funding.csv 
file. Note that the Project Identification (prjld) in funding.csv file is linked to the index 
value (Id) in DCP.csv file to give its project name and all project milestones. The Year 
Index (yearld) is counted as 1 if it is the study/analysis year. 

Listing 3: Sample data in funding, csv 

Id , prjld ,yearld .funding 
1,1,1,101.029141 
2,1,2,100.890908 


Together with the funding data, a derived first funded year needs to be recorded in the 
fs.csv file.

3.4 Project Quarantine 

Some projects may, for various reasons, be deemed critical, and thus their funding, and 
milestones must remain unchanged or be delayed at most to a limited number of years. 
These quarantined projects and their maximum number of slipped years are placed in 
the quarantine. csv file. 

Listing 5: Sample data in quarantine.csv 

Id , prj Id , moveYear 
1 , 1,0 
2,2,3 


Listing 5 shows Project 1 is untouchable while Project 2 is allowed to delay up to 3 years 
(assumed from all its required milestones). 


3.5 Project Interdependencies 

The tool currently implements seven types of scheduling interdependencies between 
both projects and assets and includes 

• Replacement - a project realising a capability that is to replace an existing asset. Two 
files lOC-PWD.csv and FOC-PWD.csv record this interdependency type. 

• Requirement - a decision on one project must be taken before a decision on another 
project. Two files YOD-YOD.csv and YOD-FPA.csv record this interdependency 
type. 

• Pre-requisite - a capability realised by one project must be in service before a 
decision on another project. Two files lOC-YOD.csv and lOC-FPA.csv record this 
interdependency type. 

• Staggering - a capability realised by one project must be in service before a capability 
realised by another project. This interdependency type is stored in lOC-IOC.csv file. 

For example, if the FOC-PWD.csv file is shown in Listing 6 , then its first record indicates 
that FOCis of DCP Project 18 will not exceed PWD 42 of dependent KDA 42. 

Listing 6: Sample data of Replacement Type 

Id , P r j I d .Assetld 

1 ,18 ,42 

2 , 1,6 


Similarly, if the lOC-YOD.csv file (pre-requisite interdependency type) is shown in 
Listing 7, then its first record indicates that IOC 2 of DCP Project 2 will not exceed YOD 4 
of DCP Project 4.

3.6 Violation Fix 

To allow the possibility of removing the violation of some of the interdependencies, one 
has to open the seven files with their names in the format fixXXX-XXX.csv (where XXX- 
XXX is one of seven interdependency types listed in Section 3.5 and add the identification 
number (depID) of all violation fixes required (see a sample data in Listing 8).

Notice that the last three data categories can also be modified at the runtime (i.e. during 
the tool running). 


4 Exploring the Scheduler Environment 

When the scheduling tool is launched, the default values of parameters are displayed as 
in Figure 2. This section of the document guides the user through the functionality of the 
tool. 



Figure 2: Project Scheduler Main Top Screen 


4.1 Goal Panel 

The Goal panel of the Scheduler allows the 
user to switch between two options 4 :

Searching a less disruptive schedule (Option 1) is directed by a weighting factor (value 
from 0 to 1) that imposes the importance between the number of projects slipped and the 
total years slipped. The weight is set to 0.5 (equally important) by default for the initial 
experiment. 


In Option 2 (maximum budget saving), the weighting will be applied to adjust the 
importance between the 4-years forward estimates (FE) and the 10-years budget plan. 
The weight is set to 1 by default to count only the 10-years budget plan and ignore the FE 
saving.

4.2 Limit Panel 


The maximum number of projects slipped 
and the maximum years slipped for each 
project are set in this panel. The special 
quarantine projects (see Section 3.4) can be 
viewed, and their maximum number of 
slipped years can also be modified when 
clicking the Setting Quarantine Projects but¬

4.3 Budget Panel 

The Budget panel allows the user to set: 

• the discount factor to apply the 
funding in each year. For example, 
the value 0.1 of the discount factor 
means $1.00 today will be $0.9 next 
year, 

• the percentage saving level of the 
10 -years budget guidance, and 



Figure 6: Setting Discount Factor 
and Saving Percentages 


• the percentage saving level of the 
4-years forward estimates. 


4.4 Interdependency Panel 


All interdependency types listed in Sec¬ 
tion 3.5 (also in Section 3.6) are accessed 
from this panel when selecting a particular 
type and clicking the View & Set up but¬ 
ton. Figure 8 shows the interdependency 
pairs where it is possible to select the 
violation(s) to be fixed.

4.5 Finding & Viewing a New Schedule 


Once all options and parameters are set in the above panel, clicking the Start to find new schedule 
button (see the bottom left buttons of Figure 2) will activate the GLPK solver [8] to search 
for a schedule. The Solver Output panel will then display a status of the search. 

If one is found from the search, the solution detail of the modified schedule can be 
accessed by clicking the View Schedule button. 


4.6 Saving & Comparing Schedules 


To save a schedule for comparison or accessing later, first give it a name in the text box 


(see bottom right side in of Figure 2) then click the Save Schedule &. Compare button. The 
Summary Chart panel will then display a radar chart (produced by the Statistical Package 
R [ 6 ]) which includes all schedules saved in the running session of the tool. We will detail 
these features of the tool in Section 5. 


4.7 Exit Program 

To exit the program, click the Close icon at the top right corner of the main tool window 
(see Figure 2). Please note there is no prompt to save the current analysis when closing 
the tool, so you need to name and save the found schedule if you want to access it later. 


5 Typical Analyis Using the Scheduling Tool 

The installation program of the tool includes all model data samples and it is ready to 
carry out the illustrative example below. In our illustration, there are 96 Projects, 49 
assets, 30 interdependency conditions of various types and 46 quarantined projects 5 . 

A typical analysis using the scheduler can be conducted in the various runs, as follows. 


5.1 Maximum Budget Saving ( Max-Save ) 

The Max-Save problem finds the maximum funding saving that can be achieved without 
violating any constraints. 

Launch the scheduler and follow the steps below: 

1. Select Maximum Budget Saving option in the Goal panel, also keep the default 
weighting value of 1 (i.e. saving goal in 10-years plan budget, see Section 4.1). 
All other panels remain untouched. 

5 Note that all data presented here is fictitious and used for illustrative purposes only.

We follow similar steps as in Section 5.1. 


1. Select Minimum Schedule Change option in the Goal panel, also keep the default 
weighting value of 0.5 (i.e. equally important between number of projects and total 
years slipped). 

Also, enter 50 into the Over 10 years plan box at the Budget panel. All other panels 
remain untouched. 


2. Click the Start to find new schedule button. The Solver Output panel then displays a 
message from the solver. Note that the budget saving is nearly matched to the enter 
value 50. However, the number of projects slipped and number of years are both 
reduced to 22 and 197 (compared to 45 and 402 in Max-Save study), respectively.

5.3 Schedule with a Saving Target (Save- %) 

Save-% allows the user to obtain a reschedule that meets various levels (in %) of funding 
saving with minimum changes. For this illustrative purpose, carry out Save-15 where 
15% is the funding saving on the 4-years FE period. 


1. Select Minimum Schedule Change option in the Goal panel. 

Also, enter 15 into the Over forward estimate box and reset the Over 10 years plan box 
value to 0 at the Budget panel. All other panels remain untouched. 


2. Click the Start to find new schedule button. The Solver Output panel then displays 
a message below.

6 Summary 

This document has described how to access the mathematical models and update its 
model data in the Project Scheduling Tool. The typical analysis through using the 
proposed models in the scheduler has been also illustrated step by step. 

Together with this user manual and the companion technical paper on the proposed 
scheduling approach, this tool provides a resource for the conduct of project investment 
analysis. However, by itself the tool will not perform this analysis. Trained staff should 
still be used to interpret the inputs and the results of the model. 

As with any piece of software and due to its nascent state there may be bugs remaining 
in the program.

19. ABSTRACT 

This document is a user guide for the software product, the Project Scheduling Tool (version 1.4). The 
tool implements various mathematical Integer Linear Programming models, as well as an approach 
that visualises and compares model solutions. The scheduler is 'packaged' with public software to 
allow required calculations to be completely automated and results to be captured in both tabular and 
graphical form.
