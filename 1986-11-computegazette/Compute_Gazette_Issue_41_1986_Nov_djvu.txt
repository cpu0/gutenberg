When the Going Gets Tough, 
the Bard Goes Drinking* 



LJk nd the goinf^ is touj^h 
i. X in Skara Brae town. 
The evil wizard Mangnr 
has cast an eternal winter 
spell. Monsters control 
the streets and dun- 
geons beneath . Good 
citizens fear for their 
lives. What's worse, 
there's only one tavern 
left that serves wine. 
But the Bard knows 
no fear. With his trusty 
harp and a few rowdy 
minstrel songs he claims 




are magic, the Bard is ready 
to boogie. All he needs is 
a band ot loyal followers: 
a light-fingered rogue to 
find secret doors, a 
couple of fighters 
to bash heads, a con- 
jurer to create weird 
allies, a magician for 
magic armor. 
Then it's off to com- 
bat, as soon as the Bard 
finishes one more verse. 
Now what's a word that 
rhymes with "dead ogre?" 




4 classes of magic user, including 

wizard and sorcerer. 85 new 

magic spells in all. 




12H color monsters, many 
animated. Alt challenging. 




Full-color scrolling dungeons. 

16 levels, each better than the 

one before. 3-D cit>', too.

Just in case you're not a regular 
reader of the financial news, we're 
happy to relate that Commodore 
International President Thomas 
Rattigan announced a net profit for 
Commodore in the fourth quarter 
ending in June 1986. Commodore 
net sales for the quarter were up 58 
percent from the comparable quar- 
ter a year ago. Concurrendy, Com- 
modore Chairman Irving Gould 
pointed out that this net gain fol- 
lowed six consecutive quarters of 
losses. Rattigan also noted that the 
June quarter sales for the Amiga 
were the best since the computer's 
launch. 

This is one set of quarterly re- 
ports that many have been anxious- 
ly awaiting. Commodore has been 
battered by the same weaknesses 
that have plagued the rest of the in- 
dustry, as well as by Amiga sales 
that have been lower than antici- 
pated. Conversely, Commodore 64 
sales, and now 64C sales, have 
been consistently strong. Amiga 
sales, especially with the advent of 
internadonal markedng, are show- 
ing continued improvement. Com- 
modore has traditionally been quite 
strong in European markets, and 
has, in the past, been criticized for 
pushing products in Europe vigor- 
ously while soft selling their intro- 
duction in the U.S. With Amiga, 
Commodore apparently reversed 
the emphasis, and therefore only 
now is able to begin to draw on its 
reputation and sales in Europe after 
a slower than desired U.S. launch. 
We continue to hope that 
Commodore will retarget the 
Amiga, or perhaps an Amiga- 
equivalent machine, at price points 
more system-competitive with the 
ST. Perhaps the newly introduced 
Apple IlGS will assist the Amiga, al- 
beit in a convoluted way, by in- 
creasing interest in the market 
while helping highlight the signifi- 
cance of many of the Amiga features. 
We digress. For now, a profit- 
able quarter is significant. Let's go 
for back-to-back. 

6 COMPUTEI's Gazeae Wovamber 1966 



Looking Ahead 

We're looking forward to another 
good year for the GAZETTE. As re- 
flected in responses from you, our 
readers, we think we're providing 
the best coverage available for 
Commodore computers in each is- 
sue; 1987 will be no exception. 

We have already scheduled 
several outstanding programs — 
utilities, games, and educational 
programs. You'll also see some ex- 
cellent articles in our features sec- 
tion — -hands-on tutorials that meet 
the needs of both beginning and 
advanced users and programmers. 
In an upcoming issue, we'll also 
have an exciting report on new 
technologies, showing the slow, 
but increasing merger of audio and 
video technologies with personal 
computers, much of this currently 
or soon available for eight-bit Com- 
modore machines. 

In addition, you'll find first- 
hand reports on the winter and 
summer Consumer Electronics 
Shows (CES), which promise to 
bring forth a host of new software 
and hardware products for the 
Commodore machines. There will 
also be articles on the latest com- 
puter printers and how to use them, 
updates on new developments in 
telecommunications, more infor- 
mation on the graphics and sound 
capabilides of the 64 and 128, and 
much, much more. 

With computers as versatile 
and popular as the 64 and the 128, 
there's certainly no shortage of 
first-rate information and programs 
to be shared with our readers. 

A Remarkable Success Story 

The continuing popularity of the 
Commodore 64 — as shown most 
recently in healthy sales of the 64C 
computer — is a remarkable success 
story that's now approaching its 
fifth anniversary. Introduced in 
January 1982, the Commodore 64 
offered a combination of graphics, 
sound, and computing power that 
was remarkable when first an- 



nounced. Almost five years later, 
thousands of Commodore 64 own- 
ers are still finding new ways to use 
this versatile machine. 

What's more, software compa- 
nies both big and small have made 
commitments to condnue produc- 
ing Commodore 64 software for at 
least the next couple of years. Not 
only are these companies finding 
that the installed base of 64 and 1 28 
users is just too big and active to ig- 
nore, but their own programmers 
and software designers are now 
coming out with some of the best 
64 software ever produced. After 
spending more than four years 
learning the ins and outs of the 
Commodore 64 system, these pro- 
grammers are working wonders 
that couldn't have. been imagined 
when the 64 was first introduced. 

Couple that situation with the 
fact that the Commodore 128 has 
turned out to be even more success- 
ful than Commodore officials 
thought it would be, and you've got 
a terrific environment in which the 
GAZETTE and its readers can operate. 

One of the pleasures of pub- 
lishing the GAZETTE each month is 
that we're constantly hearing from 
both experienced 64 and 128 own- 
ers — some who've read the GA- 
ZETTE from its first issue — as well 
as brand-new 64, 64C, and 128 
owners. As always, the GAZETTE 
and its variety of readers create a 
synergisric effect that helps to keep 
the Commodore enthusiasm alive 
and well. 

Stay with us— 1987 should be 
an exciting year.

From the author of Flight Simulator 
II comes a new dimension in 
realism. Jet simulates two fast and 
maneuverable supersonic jet 
fighters, a land-based F-16 or a 
carrier-based F-18. The simulator 
includes modern electronic flight in- 
strumentation and the most 
advanced weaponry available. Jet's 
simulation sophistication, combined 
with excellent visual attitude 
references, makes it truly enjoyable 
to fly. 

Easy aircraft control coupled with 
ballistic thrust gives you the kind of 
aerobatic maneuverability only a 
modern jet fighter can provide. Jet's 
attitude indicator is easy to read no 
matter what your orientation. A full- 
screen out-the-window view helps 
you get the most out of Jet's ex- 
cellent flight controls. And that's a 
major consideration when flying at 
speeds in excess of 1300 ivlPH. 



With Jet you can fly through either 
structured or non-structured 
environments. Engage in a deadly 
variety of combat missions. Explore 
the wargame territory, or relax by 
practicing precision aerobatic 
maneuvers. Load in scenery from 
optional United States Scenery 
Disks, You can even load in scenery 
off the Flight Simulator II disk. 
New high-performance graphic 
drivers provide beautifully detailed 
scenery in either day or night-flight 
modes. You can look forward, left, 
right, rearward, or straight up out of 
the cockpit with a single keypress. 
The Jet simulator even includes a 
special view-magnification feature 
that lets you zoom-in to identify 
objects or details at a distance. 
Jet will run on any Commodore 64 or 
Commodore 1 28 computer with one 
disk drive and either color or — 
monochrome monitor.

A Good Idea For A Program 

After many years of programming 
games on my Commodore 64, I've fi- 
nally come up with a truly original idea 
for a game. My problem is I don't have 
the knowledge to write it. What I want 
to do is patent the idea, and then try 
and sell it to a software company. Have 
people done this before? Is there any- 
thing wrong with trying to do this? If 
not, how do I go about getting a patent 
for my idea? 

Paul Rapnikas 

Many software companies buy programs 
from outside programmers or develop- 
ment teams, but most wouldn't be very re- 
ceptive to buying an idea for a program. It 
would be tike sending an inquiry to a book 
publishing company asking if they'd like 
an idea for a story which one of their au- 
thors could write. You could ivrite to indi- 
vidual companies and ask them if ihey are 
interested, but most— if not all-^ouly buy 
the rights to completed programs. 

You could copyright the game, but 
only after writing the program. Only a 
creative original work (a story, a song, a 
computer program) can be copyrighted. 
An idea cannot. 

One thing you might consider is 
teaming up with a friend loho could make 
your idea a reality. Or you could continue 
to program and hope that eventually 
you'll have the skills to write the game 
yourself 



Listing A Program To The Printer 

I wrote a short program and would like 
to print it out after I run it, but I don't 
know how. Could you tell me how to 
print my program? 

Martha L. Cox 

While the program is in memory, type this 
line (make sure the printer is turned on 

10 COMPUTEl's Ga7Btte Novsmtier 1906 



before you press RETURN): 
OPEN 3,4: CMD 3: LIST 

This opens a channel to the printer 
(the file number is 3; the printer's device 
number is 4). If you'd prefer to see upper-/ 
lowercase characters, use a secondary ad- 
dress of 7 (OPEN 3,4,7). CMD transfers 
output to the previously opened channel, 
so the listing is sent to the printer instead 
of to the screen. 

When the program is finished listing, 
type this line: 

PRINT#3: CLOSE 3 

The PRlNJn flushes out any charac- 
ters that }nighi remain in the printer and 
CLOSE shuts down the channel to the 
printer. 

Returning To The Menu 

Can you use the printer to print out the 
menu from the GAZETTE Disk? I'd like 
to place a copy of the menu on the front 
of each month's disk envelope. 

Also, can you return to the disk 
menu program from a program without 
reloading? 

LN Lambprice 

A disk directory can be loaded and listed 
as if it were a program file. Type the fol- 
lowing lines to list the disk directory of 
any disk to the printer (the diskname after 
CMD 4 is optionalh 

LOAD "$0",8 

OPEN4,4: CMDi,"diskname": LIST 

PR!NT#4: CLOSE4 

If you load and list the directory from 
the GAZETTE Disk, you'll see the various 
programs for the 64 and 128, along with 
support programs and files such as the 
menu loader. If you'd prefer to see just the 
programs for the 64, type in the followiiig 
short program, which reads the contents 
file on the disk and prints it to the screen. 
This is a generic file-reading program that 
will work on any files that contain ASCII 
characters: 

FS 10 OP EN 1,8, 2, "64 CONTENTS" 
AE 20 GET#1,AS!S=ST 
MX 30 PRIMTA?! iIFS=<0THEN20 
EK 40 CLOSEl 

To read the file and send the results 
to the printer, use this program: 

FS 10 0PENl,e,2, "64 CONTEtJTS " 

SM IS 0PEN4,4 

AE 20 CET#1,A5!S-ST 



QR 30 PRINT#4,A5f iIFS"0THEN20 
RR 3S PRINT#4!CL0SE4 

EK 40 CLOSEl 

/( would be possible to have most 
programs return to the menu after they're 
done, but there are several problems with 
this suggestion. First, the original idea for 
the Disk was to provide exact copies of 
programs as they're listed in the maga- 
zine. The magazine listings don't return to 
a menu, so we'd have to make changes to 
the programs on the Disk. In some cases 
this would be simple enough, but other 
programs (especially ML games and utili- 
ties) rely on special programming tech- 
niques thai add wedges, introduce 
interrupts, or move memory around. 
Before returning to the menu, the program 
would have to undo the various changes 
that had been made to the computer. 

Another factor is that many subscrib- 
ers to the Disk make backup copies — 
games on one disk, utilities on another, 
and so on. A retum-to-menu command 
would generate error messages if the pro- 
gram ivas run from a disk that didn't con- 
tain the menu program. In the case of ML 
programs, it would be difficult for some of 
our readers to remove or rewrite the por- 
tion of the program that reloaded the 
menu. 

Adding the option of returning to the 
disk menu would please some subscribers, 
but it would displease many others. 



The SpeedScript Buffer 

I have a question about SpeedScript. 
Two of the commands deal with a buff- 
er. The buffer isn't mentioned in the ar- 
ticle, but the keyboard map shows the 
commands CTRL-R (retrieve buffer) 
and CTRL-K (kill buffer). Please explain 
how to insert text into the buffer and 
how to use these commands. 

Chip Mattson 

SpeedScript 's erase command automati- 
cally activates the buffer. After you press 
CTRL-E, a prompt appears on the top line 
to ask whether you want to erase a sen- 
tence, word, or paragraph (press S, W, or 
P). Whatever you erase is temporarily 
saved in the buffer. To retrieve the text, 
press CTRL-R. 

The buffer can be used in two ways. If 
you accidentally erase more than you 
wanted to, you can immediately retrieve 
it. Also, if you wish to move a section of a

document, you can erase it, move the cur- 
sor to the neu> location, and press CTRL-R 
to insert it there. You can retrieve the con- 
tents of the buffer any number of titnes, 
■which is handy for making repetitive 
forms (Name/Address/Phone, for ex- 
ample). Also, some (but not ai!) versions of 
SpeedScript ailow you to erase part of a 
document, load a new file, and copy lite 
buffered text from the first file into the 
second. 

The text in the buffer will remain 
there until you use CTRL-E again, at 
which point the buffer is zeroed and the 
newly erased text begins to fill it. If you 
loanl to add to what's in the buffer, use 
SHIFT-CTRL-E instead. 

When you 're erasing large portions of 
a document, you may reach a point where 
there's no more room in the buffer. To 
clear out the buffer, press CTRL-K. You 
can then resume erasing. 



The Meaning Behind CMD 

In the Septetnber issue of the GAZETTE, 
we said that the CMD statement doesn't 
seetn to be an abbreviation and suggested 
that it doesn't have a long form. Readers 
R.S. Meyer and jim Yost both sent letters 
with the same answer: CMD means 
Change Main (output) Device, which 
makes sense to us. Thanks for your letters. 



Moving Files Around 

How can ! reposition files on a disk di- 
rectory so that an often -used program is 
the first on the disk? This would be use- 
ful in loading programs with just an as- 
terisk (•). 

David Marz 

First, the asterisk doesn't always load the 
first program on a disk. If you have just 
loaded or saved a program and then type 
LOAD" "",8 you'll load the most recently 
accessed file— not the first on the disk. 
This is hattdy if you accidentally scratch a 
program. A scratched file is the most re- 
cently accessed, so you can LOAD"*", 8 
to retrieve it and then save it back to disk. 

To load the first [He on a disk, enter 
LOAD"0:*",8. Usually the shorter 
inAD":*",8 will also wo'rk. 

You can replace the first disk file 
with another file by using the DOS copi^ 
command in conjunction with the rename 
and scratch commands. Let's say you have 
a disk that contains ZEBRA as the first file 
and you'd prefer to have another program 
called AMBER at the beginning. First, you 
have to move ZEBRA out of the first 
position: 

OPEN 15,8,15 

PRINT#15, "CO:TEMP = 0:ZEBRA" 
PRINT#15, "SOiZEBRA" 
PRINT#15, ■'RO:ZEBRA = 0:TEMP" 

First, copy (CO:) the file named ZE- 
BRA to a temporary file on the same disk 

12 COMPUTEI's Gazetta Novemlwr 1986 



called TEMP. At this point, tlie same pro- 
gram is on the disk in two places, once as 
ZEBRA and once as TEMP, Next, scratch 
(SO:) ZEBRA, which frees up the first spot 
in tiie direclorv. Finally, rename (RO:) the 
file TEMP to its original name of ZEBRA. 
Now you have to copy AMBER to the 
newly opened first position in the 
directory: 

PRINT#15, "CO:TEMP = 0: AMBER" 
PRINT#15, "S():AMBER" 
PRINT#15, "R0:AMBER = O:TEMP" 
CLOSEIS 

This copies the file TIMBER (o tlie 
next available space in the directory 
(which happens to be the first filename, 
because ZEBR,\ was just moved). Then tlie 
original AMBER is scratched, and TEMP 
IS renamed to be AMBER. Finally, channel 
15 IS closed. Now, when you enter 
LOAD"0:*",il you'll get the AMBER pro- 
gram because it's the first one in the 
directory. 



Arrays Are lists 

Could you write an article about the use 
of the DIM statement? The reference 
books I own have very sketchy infor- 
mation. I've •;nclosed a partial listing of 
a program I'm trying to write for our 
bowling team. 1 keep getting an error 
message in the line that contains DIM. 
Any help would be appreciated. 

A.G. Trobaugh 

The DIM statement sets up the size (01- 
Mension) of an array of variables. An ar- 
ray is basically a numbered list of 
variables. The array has a single name, 
like a variable, but it is followed by an In- 
dex number in parentheses. Arrays are 
useful in a wide variety of applications. 
You can creaie arrays to contain strings or 
numbers, and they may have one or more 
dimensions. 

From the program listing you sent, it 
looks like you understand how to use ordi- 
nary variables. And there are sections of 
the program that would benefit from the 
use of arrays. For instance, there's one 
pari of the program that looks like this: 

310 INPUT NM 

320 IF NM " 1 THEN NM$ = 

"DOROTHY" 
330 IF NM " 2 THEN NM$ = "NESSY" 
340 IF NM == 3 THEN NM$ = "WALLY" 

and so on, with a total of eight IF-THEN 
statements. This is a situation that could 
be handled very nicely with an array. 
There are eight names, so you need to 
DIM the artay to a size of 8, and then as- 
sign the names to each position in the 
array: 

10 DIM B$(i)) 

12 BSd) = "DOROTHY": BS(2) = 
"NESSY": B$(3) = "WALLY" 

The rest of the array is then filled 
with the appropriate names. A shorter 



zvay to set up the array is to use a FOR- 
NEXT loop: 

10 DIM B$(8> 

12 FOR X =» 1 TO 8: READ BS(X): NEXT 

14 DATA DOROTHY, N^gSY, WALLY 

The DATA statement on line 14 must 
contain eight names for this to work prop- 
erly. Note that line 12 uses a variable in- 
stead of a number in parentheses. You can 
put either a number or a numeric variable 
"in parentheses. This means you could re- 
place the INPUT and eight IF-THENs 
starting at line ilO with the following two 
lines; 

310 INPUT NM 
320 NM$ = BSINM) 

A two-dimensional array needs two 
numbers (or variables) in parentheses. 
Let's say you want to keep weekly scores 
for each of the bowlers on the team. On 
paper, the grid would look like this: 



NB 


NW 1 






9 










WEEKl 


WEEK 2 


WEEK 3 


BOWLER 1 


680 


639 


591 


BOWLER 2 


501 


505 


542 


DOWLER 3 


48Z 


595 


4D3 


BOWLER 4 


... 


... 


... 



The number of bowlers (NB) runs 
doivn the left side, and the number of 
weeks (NW) runs across the top. To imple- 
ment this in BASIC, you need a line like 
this: 

10 NB = 8; NW = 33: DIM SaNB,NW) 

You also need a way to fill up the ar- 
ray with the appropriate numbers, wheth- 
er you INPUT from the keyboard, READ 
from DATA statements, or OPEN and 
READ a disk file. 

There are two problems in the line 
that's giving you the error message. The 
first is that DIM should be followed by the 
array name and parentheses containing 
the size of the array (see the examples 
above). Another, more serious, mistake is 
that there are several DIM statements 
sprinkled throughout the program. An ar- 
ray can be dimensioned only once. If you 
use DIM more than once on the same ar- 
ray you'll get a REDIM'D ARRAY error. 
A common practice is to put all DIM 
statements at the beginning of a program 
or in a subroutine that's called only once. 



Exception To The Rule? 

In one of your programs, you used neg- 
ative numbers in DATA statements. 1 
don't understand that. 1 thought all 
DATA statements were between 0-255. 
How does this work? 

Glenn Peterson 

Three of the tnost common uses for DATA 
statements are machine language pro- 
grams, custom characters, and sprite

shapes. All three of these require numbers 
to be POKEd into memory. An individual 
byie of memory can hold a number i;; the 
range 0-255, so in a sense you're right. 
When DATA statements hold numbers 
that are going to be POKEd into memory, 
the DATA statements must be limited to 
the range 0-255, 

But DATA statements can hold other 
sorts of information, too. If the data is 
names of people or bowling scores, the 
0-255 rule doesn't apply. Negative num- 
bers are acceptable in DATA, as long as 
the numbers aren't being POKEd to 
memory. 



How Much Room Remains On

I have a program to control a loan busi- 
ness. Each account is kept as a sequen- 
tial file. The individual file lengths vary 
from account to account, and it's some- 
times necessary to ascertain how much 
space is available on the disk. It would 
not do to suddenly run out of space.

any time the number of blocks free on a

Sprite Collisions And Hi-Res 
Graphics 

1 have two computers, a VIC and a 64, 
I've been writing machine language 
programs for both of them for about a 
month now. How can I write a program 
that detects collision between a certain 
sprite and a certain background charac- 
ter in machine language? Say a pro- 
gram that checks for collision between 
sprite one and the letter R and a colli- 
sion between sprite two and the letter 
A. 

Another question, I have a game 
that displays 16 colors in bitmap (hi- 
res) mode. How is this done? 

Sayam Tantasook 

16 COMPUTEI's Gazette NiwBmlMr 1986 



When a sprite-to-character collision oc- 
curs, you can PEEK location 53279 
($D01F) to determine xohich sprite was in- 
volved in the collision, but there's no easy 
way to figure out which character it hit. 
All you really knoiv is that a certain sprite 
happened to hit a character. You can't de- 
termine which character loas hit unless 
you PEEK the horizontal and vertical lo- 
cations (x and y coordinates) of the sprite, 
translate thetn into the equivalent row 
and column on the screen, and then PEEK 
screen memory in that vicinity. 

To answer your second question, 
there are several ways to set up a lu-res 
screen. The first is true hi-res, lohere you 
can turn on or off 64,000 picture elements 
(pixels) arranged in a pattern of 320 pixels 
across X 200 pixels down. Since a byte of 
memory contains eight bits, it can hold 
enough infortnation io control eight pixels 
on the hi-res screen. Thus, 8000 bytes are 
required to bitmap a standard hi-res 
screen. 

Color memory is also important. 
When you set up a hi-res screen, 1000 
bytes are set aside for color memory. Each 
memory location in hi-res color memory 
controls the foreground and background 
colors for an 8-pixel X 8~pixel section of 
the screen. Within each 8X8 section, 
you're allowed only two colors (not count- 
ing sprites that might be moving around). 
But each section is independent of the oth- 
er sections. So, for example, you could 
have an 8 X 8 chunk of the screen with a 
blue background and white pixels next to 
a section thai has a red background loith 
gray pixels. Each 8X8 area can contain 
only two colors, but the colors are inde- 
pendent of colors that might appear in 
other 8X8 areas. 

Another method to set up a bit- 
mapped screen is to use multicolor hi-res, 
if you choose to use multicolor mode 
(which could be called medium-res), you 
trade half the horizontal resolution in re- 
turn for two additional colors. Instead of 
320 X 200, the screen has 160 double- 
width pixels X 200 lines. Each pixel re- 
quires two bits (binary 00, 01, 10, or 21) to 
define the color. Color memory stilt con- 
trols an 8 X 8 section of the screen, but 
the pixels are twice as wide, so you really 
have only a4 X 8 area to work in. The 32 
pixels can contain one of four different 
colors. Again, the separate sections of the 
screen are independent of each other, al- 
though one of the colors is universal. 

Some screens that seem to be hi-res 
actually use custom characters. Each 
character can have an individual fore- 
ground color (based on the number in 
color memory) in addition to a background 
color shared among all characters. Multi- 
color characters can have an individual 
foreground color plus two other common 
colors in addition to the background. 

Characters can also be displayed in 
extettded background color mode, which 



reduces by a factor of four the number of 
available characters (64 instead of 256), 
but multiplies by four the number of back- 
ground colors. You can then choose one of 
the 16 available colors for the character in 
the foreground and one of four background 
colors for the rest of the 8X8 character 
grid. 



Pictures On Disk 

I recently purchased a Commodore 
128. One of the main reasons 1 chose 
the 128 is because 1 heard of its easy-to- 
use graphics capabilities that are acces- 
sible from BASIC, I have written many 
hi-res programs and wish to save just 
the pictures to disk, preferably with the 
BSAVE command. Is this possible? 
How could 1 do it? 

Brian Aljian 

After you've designed the hi-res picture 
and displayed it on the screen, type the 
following line in immediate mode— or in- 
clude it in your program: 

BSAVE "picturename", BO, P7168 TO 
PI 6383 

To load it back into memory, 
BLOAD"picturename",B0. For multi- 
color hi-res pictures, you'll have to set 
colors 2 and 3 before BLOADing the 
picture. 

BLOAD and BSAVE were intended 
primarily for machine language programs, 
but they can also be used to load and save 
hi-res pictures, sprite shapes, character 
sets, function key definitions, and so on. If 
you have a portion of memory you want to 
send to disk, BSAVE is a handy command. 



The Other Side Of The CP/M Disk 

I'm a Commodore 128 owner, and I 
was unaware that the CP/M disk was 
two-sided until 1 read about it in your 
magazine. 

After i booted it for the first time 
and before I copied it, 1 managed to 
"nuke" the disk. Now, the first side still 
boots up, but the second side gives me a 
disk error and prints a whole bunch of 
question marks. 

What happened to my disk and 
how can ! get it replaced? 

Jim Traverse 

The first side of the CP/M disk contains 
the boot sector for starting up CP/M and 
the second side does not. You must turn on 
the computer (or type BOOT) while side 
one is in the disk drive. After CP/M has 
booted, remove the disk and flip it over. 
When the second side is in the drive, 
type DIR to see if you can get a directory. 
If you still get question marks, try press- 
ing CTRL-C (hold down the CONTROL 
key and press C). This tells CP/M to log 
out the previous disk and prepare for a 
new one. Then type DIR again. Pressing 
CTRL-C may solve your problem.

Addressing Envelopes 

I have a Commodore 64 with a 1526 
printer. I routinely use SpeedScript for 
letters with tractor-feed paper. I have 
trouble with regular single sheet paper 
and I have been unable to type enve- 
lopes. How do I do this? 

George A. Clark 

When you're using SpeedScript with sin- 
gle sheets of paper, you should put the 
page-wait command at the top of the doc- 
ument. Hold down CTRL and press the 
English pound key. You'll be prompted for 
a format key; type the letter w (for "wait 
between pages"). You may have to set the 
bottom margin a little higher as well. 
When a page has printed, SpeedScript 
will print a line that reminds you to insert 
(he next sheet. 

The Commodore 1526 printer has a 
paper sensor that causes the printer to 
stop when it thinks it has run out of paper. 
By using the page-wait command, you can 
avoid most problems caused by the sensor. 

The printer won't print envelopes be- 
cause of the paper sensor. When you've 
lined up the envelope, the printer thinks 
it's out of paper and refuses to continue. 

Here's a way to use your printer to 
address envelopes: Place a piece of paper 
between the flap and the main envelope. 
Carefully pick up the paper and envelope 
together and insert them top first into the 
printer. Advance the paper until the top of 
the envelope shows. The piece of paper 
you've inserted fools the paper sensor into 
thinking there's more paper. 



A Fasthad Warm Start 

I am a happy owner of the Epyx Fast- 
load cartridge, but when I use the 64's 
system reset command (SYS 64738), 
Fasfload is disabled. Is there a reset 
command that will leave Fasttoad in 
place? 

Brian Johnson 

We don't usually respond to programming 
questions about specific commercial prod- 
ucts (it's best to address inquiries to the 
software company that produces the pro- 
gram), but within a week after we received 
your letter, two answers appeared in the 
"Feedback" mailbox, so this must be a 
common problem. Here they are: 

The Fastload manual states 
that the only way to use the car- 
tridge after it has been deactivated 
is to turn the 64 off and on again. 
However, through disassembling 

18 COMPUTEI's GazattB November 1988 



the program 1 have figured out haw 
to do both a warm start and a cold 
start. 

The warm start is easy; all it 
does is re-enable the Fastload com- 
mands without clearing the screen 
or erasing any program in memory. 
Just SYS 57194. The cold start is 
similar to SYS 64738 but also en- 
ables Fastload. Below is a program 
that does it. The variable S can be 
set to any value where there are 6 
free bytes of memory. 

10 5 = 820 

20 FOR I - S TO S + S: READ A; 

POKE I,A: NEXT: SYS S 
30 DATA 32,6,223,76,48,128 

David MacKenzie 

I'm sure Fastload users have 
found that SYS 64738 doesn't reset 
Fastload. This short routine can re- 
place SYS 64738: 

10 FOR I = 298 TO 293: READ A: 

POKE I,A: NEXT 
20 DATA 32,21,223,76,61,128 

After you run the program, you can 
reset the computer and re-enable 
Fastload with SYS 288. 

Albert H. Cooper, III 

Thanks to both of you for the answer to 
this question. 



80-Column Cables For The 128 

I would like to know where I may pur- 
chase the monochrome 80-coIumn ca- 
ble that you mentioned recently, and 
how much it is, 

Ricky Seidenstein 

The 128 has both monochrome and color 
80-column outputs. These two signals are 
available on the port labeled RGBI. To see 
80 columns in color, you need an RGB 
monitor and an IBM-compatible color ca- 
ble (almost any merchant that sells RGB 
monitors will also stock cables for the 
IBM, so they're not difficult to find). 

You can use either a monochrome 
monitor, also called a green-screen or an 
amber-screen, or a composite color moni- 
tor such as the 1 701 or 1 702 to obtain 80 
columns in monochrome. For the 1701 or 
1702, connect the monochrome input to 
the jack on the rear of the monitor labeled 
LUMA. Monochrome means one color, 
but you really have three colors: dark, 
light, and a gray shade that's between the 
(wo extremes. 

To build your own cable, buy a length 
of coaxial cable, an RCA male plug, and a 
standard male nine-pin D connector (Ra- 
dio Shack part #276-1537). The nine-pin 
connector is the. complement of a joystick 
connector, which is to say that a joystick 
plug will fit into this connector. Pin 1 of 
the RGBI connector is ground and pin 7 is 
the monochrome output. See page 352 of 
the 128 System Guide for a diagram, I 



which is arranged as if you were inside the 
computer looking out. Connect pin 1 to 
the outside portion of the coaxial cable 
and pin 7 to the inner wire. 

The Radio Shack parts cost about $5, 
and the cable is easy to make if you're 
good with a soldering iron. If you're not, 
you can buy one for $8-$15. Batteries In- 
cluded, Microvations, and Cardco have 
such cables for sale (ask your local Com- 
modore dealer for details). Some Commo- 
dore dealers also make their own cables. 



XMODEM: A Standard Protocol 

Where can i obtain the XMODEM pro- 
tocol? I am interested in designing my 
own terminal programs and need infor- 
mation on this. 

Ttnx KoUas 

XMODEM (also known as Modem7) is an 
error-checking scheme used to transmit 
files from one computer to another, 
usually over the telephone lines. It is 
without a doubt the most popular micro- 
computer protocol for uploading and 
downloading. 

The original XMODEM protocol was 
devised by Ward Christ ensen, who also set 
up the first computer bulletin board. Data 
is sent in blocks of 128 bytes, with a check- 
sum and other extra information which 
insures that each block is received 
correctly. 

XMODEM transfers always involve 
eight-bit bytes; if you are using a telecom- 
munications program, make sure that you 
are communicating with a word length of 
eight bits and no parity. Four ASCII char- 
acters have a special meaning in this 
protocol: 

i SOH start of header 

4 EOT end of text 

6 ACK acknmvledge 

21 NAK negative acknowledge 

The computers at both ends of the 
link use these characters as signals during 
the transfer. Respectively, they are used to 
mark the start of a data block (SOH), and 
to indicate when the transmission is com- 
plete (EOT), when a block has been re- 
ceived successfully (ACK), and when an 
error has occurred in receiving a block 
(NAK). 

A complete XMODEM block always 
consists of 132 bytes of information. The 
first 3 bytes of the block are called the 
header. The next 1 28 bytes contain the ac- 
tual data being transferred, and the last 
byte contains a checksum. The first byte is 
the start-of-header character (SOH, ASCII 
V which says to the receiving computer, 
"Here comes a block." The second byte is 
the block number, which begins at one and 
increases by one every time a block is suc- 
cessfully transmitted. When the block 
number exceeds 255, it flips over to zero 
(not one). The third byte is (he block com- 
plement, a value equal to the ones com- 
plement of the block number (256 — the

block mtmber). Together, the block mm- 
bermtd complvment alloto both computers 
to make sure they are synchronized (deal- 
ing with the same block). 

The 128 data bytes may contain any 
sort of eight-bit data (executable programs 
as well as ordinary ASCH text). The 
checksum is the eight-bit sumof all 128 
data bytes. It's reset to zero at the begin- 
ning of each block, and flips over to zero 
whenever it exceeds 255. hi BASIC, the 
checksum can be calculated with the 
statement CHECKSUM = (CHECKSUM 
+ BYTE) AND 255, where CHECKSUM is 
the checksum value and BYTE is ihe 
ASCII value of the current character. 
Here IS a nutshell description of a success- 
ful XMODEM transfer: 

Initiation. Sender waits for an initial 
NAKfrom receiver. Receiver sends a NAK 
to initiate the transfer. 
Transfer of blocks. Sender transmits a 
132-bytc block consisting of a one-byle 
SOH character, one-byte block number, 
oyie-byte block numlyer complement, 128 
bytes of data, and a one-byte checksum. If 
the receiver gets the block successfully, if 
sends an ACK lo say, "I got that block 
okay; send the next one." If an error oc- 
curs, the receiver sends a NAK to say, 
"Send the last block again. " This process 
continues until all blocks have been re- 
ceived successfully (or the transfer is 
aborted; see next section). 

Termination. Sender transmits an EOT 
character to signal the end of the trans- 
mission. Receiver sends an ACK lo say, "I 
see that you're done, so I'm quitting, too." 
Timing and error-checking are criti- 
cal parts of XMODEM. Since the transfer 
is largely automatic, each computer must 
have a means of aborting the process if too 
many errors occur. Here is a description of 
error-checking during an XMODEM 
transfer: 

Initiation. Sender aborts the transfer if it 
doesn't receive an initiating NAK from 
the receiver after ten lO-second timeouts 
(100 seconds total). Receiver sends the 
first NAK, then waits to get the first SOH, 
sending another NAK every ten seconds if 
no SOH appears. Receiver aborts the 
transfer if ten 10-second timeouts occur 
without its receiving an SOH. 
Triinsfer of block. Sender transmits a 
132-byte block, then waits for a response 
from the receiver. Sender aborts transfer if 
ten lO-second timeouts occur for any 
block without its receiving an ACK or 
NAKfrom the receiver. Receiver waits for 
each block to arrive, sending a NAK every 
ten seconds if no SOH appears, and abort- 
ing transfer if ten such timeouts occur for 
any block. After receiving an SOH, the re- 
ceiver reduces the timeout interval to one 
second for each of the 131 remaining bytes 
in the block, and sends a NAK to request 
retransmission if more than ten t-second 
timeouts occur for any single byte (this 

20 COMPUTEfs Gazette November 1986 



covers the case where a block contains too 
few bytes). If all 132 bytes arrive on time, 
the receiver sends a NAK if the first byte is 
not an SOH or if the block number, com- 
plement, or checksum does not match. If 
the receiver gets a duplicate block (caused 
when the sender fails to recognize an 
ACK), it throws away the duplicate and 
sends an ACK to say, "I got that block al- 
ready; send the next one." In this case, 
and whenever it needs to send a NAK, the 
receiver first purges the line by getting the 
remainder of the block (getting characters 
until no more characters are incoming) 
and throwing it away. 
Termination. If the sender's EOT is lost, 
or the settder simply stops senditig, the re- 
ceiver eventually aborts because it experi- 
ences ten 10-second titneouls without 
receiving anything. If the sender does not 
receive the receiver's final ACK, it aborts 
when ten 10-second timeouts occur. Note 
that if the very last black of data contains 
feuter than 128 bytes, the sender "pads" 
the block with extra characters, often 
nulls (ASCII 0). 

Though it's not provided in the origi- 
nal protocol, many iynplementations of 
XMODEM use another special character 
(CAN, ASCII 26) to allow either computer 
lo cancel the transfer immediately. Propo- 
nents of XMODEM claim an accuracy 
rate in excess of 99 percent (fewer than 1 
percent undetected errors). XMODEM 
zvas devised in the early days of personal 
computing, when the eight-bit CP/M ma- 
chine was king. Its major limitations arise 
because, understandably enough, it relies 
on eight -bit arithmetic. An improved ver- 
sion of XMODEM uses the CRC (cyclic re- 
dundancy checksum) method to reduce the 
likelihood of undetected errors. Programs 
designed for use with commercial infor- 
mation services often relax the timittg re- 
quirements (increase the timeout periods) 
as ivell, to allow for the delays caused by 
telephone packet-switching networks. 

XMODEM has also been criticized 
because it involves a high degree of over- 
head: For every 128 bytes of data, you 
must process a minimum of five non-data 
bytes (SOH, block number, complement, 
checksum, and ACK or NAK). More recent 
protocols such as Kermit transmit data in 
1024-byte or even larger blocks. 



Video Banks 

[ am in the process of writing an arcade- 
style game for the 64 which uses both 
sprites and hi-res grapliics. Unfortu- 
nately, 1 have more than 50 sprite 
shapes, so the shapes and the hi-res 
screen cannot be located in block zero. [ 
haven't been able to find out how to 
move sprites and the hi-res screen to 
block one. The screen memory and 
character memory must be moved also. 
Do the sprite pointers change from 



2040-2047 to 18424-18431? Since my 
game is in machine language, the place- 
ment of BASIC is not a problem. Can 
you help? 

Dean Kreutzer 

The VIC-U video chip handles all graph- 
ics, including sprites, hi-res screens, char- 
acter shapes, and screen memory for 
ordinary characters. This chip can only 
"see" 16K at a time, so you can choose 
from four video banks: 

bankO: 0-16383 
bank 1: 16384-32767 
bank 1: 3276S-4915I 
bank 3: 49752-65535 

W/icH you switch to a neio video 
bank, all video information moves there. If 
you have a character screen at locations 
1024-2023, with sprite pointers at 
2040-2047, and you move the video to 
bank 1, Ihe new sprite pointers will be lo- 
cated at 1S424-18431. 

To switch to a nao bank in BASIC/ 
use the following lines (where BANK is 
Ihe bank number): 

POKE 56578, PEEK(56578) OR 3 
POKE 56S76, (PEEK(565761 AND 252) OR 
(3-BANK> 

The machine language equivalent, 
assuming you want to switch to bank 1, is; 

LDA 56578 
ORA #3 
STA 56578 
LDA 56576 
AND #252 
ORA #2 
STA 56576 

You won't be able to print to Ihe 
standard text screen unless you also 
POKE 648, (PEEK(648)AND63y OR 
(BANK* 64). m

The Evolution Of 
Program Design 



Selby Bateman, Features Editor 

Will individual programmers be replaced by teams of program 
designers, each with his or her own specialty? It's been hap- 
pening for years in the mainframe and minicomputer environ- 
ment, and is fast becoming the norm in the microcomputer 
programming world. As computers grow more powerful, soft- 
ware becomes more complex — and programmers often find 
themselves with too much of a good thing. 



Veteran program designer Chris 
Crawford remembers leaning over 
his KIM-1 single-board microcom- 
puter in 1977, trying to program a 
game that would run in the ma- 
chine's 1 K of Random Access Mem- 
ory (RAM); that's 1,000 bytes of total 
memory — 1/64 the RAM of your 
Commodore 64 and 1/128 that of 
the Commodore 128. 

"I was sweating every bit, 
packing every bit; fitting it into 
RAM was the dominant consider- 
ation," says Crawford. "It's largely 
opaque to the user, but program- 
mers have always sweated RAM." 

He succeeded in finishing the 
game, and in the process learned a 
great many lessons about efficient 
program design and execution. 

Less than ten years later, 
Crawford is now working on a 
computer with 512K of RAM, de- 
signing a game that will operate 
only on computers with a minimum 
of 256K of memory. That mush- 
rooming growth in available mem- 
ory is the trend that Crawford says 
has most dramatically affected his 
work and that of every other pro- 
gram designer today. 



Running Away From Us 

At the same dme that he and other 
programmers are enjoying this ex- 
panded memory, Crawford issues a 
warning: "Basically, the hardware 
is running away from us," 

To understand that cautionary 
note, consider Crawford's own his- 
tory in the programming busi- 
ness — a tenure that surpasses that 
of most other programmers in dura- 
tion and success. 

After working in the impossi- 
ble space of IK in 1977, Crawford 
moved up to 8K in 1978 with his 
first commercial game, Tatiktics, 
then jumped to the then unheard- 
of 16K in 1981 with his popular 
game. Eastern Front. Another game, 
Excalibur, was created in 1983 to 
run on a machine with 48K, His re- 
cent highly acclaimed Balance of 
Power requires 128K of memory. 
And now he's in the midst of de- 
signing a game that requires 256K 
to operate. 

In the days when he had litde 
RAM to work with, Crawford dis- 
covered what many other program- 
mers — professional and amateur 
hackers alike — have since learned. 



When you want to squeeze a good 
program into a small space, you 
have to write your programs in ma- 
chine (assembly) language. 

So-called high-level languages 
like BASIC and Pascal are fairly 
large programs, which use up a lot 
of memory themselves. So, Craw- 
ford and many others studied ma- 
chine language, and discovered the 
thrill of communicating one-to-one 
with the computer. While the task 
was not a simple one, the programs 
were small, fast, and elegant. 

But when Crawford began to 
climb up to computers with larger 
memories, he quickly found a dif- 
ferent problem. 

"In small machines, you had to 
work in assembly language to 
accomplish much," says Crawford, 
"But when we got to 48K, it got a 
little rough to do everything in as- 
sembly language. 

"For me, the big transition was 
going to 128K in Balance of Power. I 
worked in Pascal. It's difficult to 
imagine someone writing a 128K 
program in assembly language. Al- 
though people do it, it's very hard." 

The Real Problem 

And something else began to hap- 
pen. A few programmers noticed 
that the extra memory was making 
some programmers lazy — wasting 
all of that formerly precious memo- 
ry by writing sloppy code. For ex- 
ample, a word processor that 
previously would have been 

COMPUTErs Gai^ene Novembar 19B6 23 



1>_^^ T^. »>,, 



squeezed into 20K when written in 
machine language might now be 
written in a high-level language like 
C, taking up lOOK or more of 
memory. 

But, says Crawford, that's not 
the real problem. All of this extra 
memory is cheap. It's the quality of 
the program itself that's suffering 
today, he adds. 

"Wasteful memory? That's not 
so much a problem. I)o you waste 
paper clips in your office? Big deal," 
says Crawford with a laugh. "The 
more serious problem is that pro- 
grammers have had problems ad- 
justing to the new RAM sizes, and 
using them effectively," 

When it comes to today's pro- 
gram design, Crawford is con- 
cerned with what he calls the 
difference between meat and meat 
extender. In earlier days, a 30K pro- 
gram might have had 12K of actual 
program (the meat) and 18K of data 
(the meat extender). Today, Craw- 
ford is seeing programs with 40K of 
real programming and 500K of 
meat extender. 

"They spend a lot more time 
throwing little nothings at the user, 
but the programs aren't much dif- 
ferent. Programmers arc shoveling 
a lot of filler into their programs^ — 
meat extenders." 

On the happier side of this 
equation, Crawford sees this as a 
temporary aberration. But, one that 
will change over time only slowly. 

Emerging Design Teams 

How are commercial program de- 
signers coping with this problem? 
For several good reasons, the enor- 
mous changes in available memory 
and much more powerful and flexi- 
ble computer systems have given 
rise to software design teams. Pro- 
grammers, graphic artists, testers, 
project directors — all work together 
to create the best possible program. 
These teams also use a host of pro- 
gramming tools, usually built up 
through earlier projects, which be- 
come a virtual library of program- 
ming tricks and timesavers. 

Sid Meier, who has designed or 
directed the design of virtually all of 
Micro Prose Software's popular sim- 
ulation and strategy games, says 
that MicroProse uses an interactive

The excellent visual effects in sucli Epi/x 
computer games as Summer Games ]1 
are created by computer art director 
Michael Kosaka and his team of four 
artists. 




Although Sid Meier's popular flight 
simulators and air combat software have 
been based on his oivu development 
libraries, he started from scratch when 
creating the screens for the MicroProse 
submarine simulation. Silent Service. 




Gorry Kitchen's GamcMaker package 
includes a SpriteMaker among its arsenal 
of progratmning tools for 
nonprogrammers. 



development language that includes 
many proven machine language 
routines and that was created inter- 
nally for the company's own use. 
This library of development tools is 
composed of building blocks, every- 
thing from a static background to 
sound and sprite programming rou- 
tines from earlier games the compa- 
ny has produced. "It lets you 
develop interactively without the 
hassles of machine language." 

Meier is responsible for such 
hits as Solo Flight . F-15 Strike Eagle, 
and Silent Service, in addition to de- 
signing the company's Command 
Series of strategy games. He's been 
a part of many changes that have 
made his teams of designers more 
effective. 

"For instance, the standards 
and levels of artwork required have 
improved dramatically," he says. 
"Generally today, you need an art- 
ist, or someone competent to do the 
graphic part of the program." 

Another example of shared re- 
sponsibilities is the MicroProse 
Command Series, including titles 
such as Crusade in Europe, Conflict 
in Vietnam, and Decision in the De- 
sert. While Meier may do much of 
the actual program design, it's Mi- 
croProse resident historian Ed 
Bever who conducts the research to 
make sure that the final product de- 
sign is as accurate as possible in a 
game. They work as a team, bring- 
ing together talents that would be 
difficult to find in just one designer. 

The Feel Of The Game 

At Strategic Simulations (SSI), a 
leader in strategy and fantasy 
games, the development teams are 
a mixture of talents as well. For ex- 
ample, Paul Murray worked with 
co-designer Keith Brors to create 
the fantasy game Wizard's Crowu. 
The approach they took with that 
game is similar to any program they 
might tackle, says Murray. 

"The first thing we do is to 
come up with what we want the 
game to do, what the feel of the 
game is. And then we write the 
rules. The emphasis from the start 
in Wizard's Crown was on tactical 
combat, 

"We came up with the basic al- 
gorithm, tested it to see if it worked.

then started doing the general 
stuff," he says. 

While Brors worked on the 
characters and the data surround- 
ing them, Murray concentrated on 
working out the combat situations. 
Later, the two put together what 
they'd worked out individually, but 
the entire process was one of con- 
stant interaction. Even SSI Presi- 
dent Joel Billings, who has 
extensive experience as a war 
gamer and a game designer, gets in- 
volved as a tester and fine-tuner in 
the SSI development process. 

Computer game enthusiasts 
today usually demand exceptional- 
ly well developed color graphics. 
To answer that need, one of the 
changes in program design is the 
emergence of the art director, 
whose job it is to make sure that the 
computer graphics are as effective 
as possible. At Epyx, a company 
known for its graphically excellent 
action games, Michael Kosaka 
serves as art director for computer 
graphics. 

Managing a staff of four other 
artists, Kosaka works with individ- 
ual project managers and program- 
mers, trying to get the right mix of 
graphics and game play. Like a 
number of other companies, Epyx' 
designers build many products 
with in -house development tools. 
Kosaka even has a set of graphics 
tools that let him create any images 
he wants without having to be an 
expert in machine language. 

Thrashing Things Out 

"I think my goal is to try to get the 
absolutely best images I can," he 
says. And he admits that part of 
what he likes most about his work 
is "thrashing things out with the 
programmers, working with them, 
pushing and learning from them. 

"It's very interesting. We've 
found a nice blend of give and take, 
and it works out real well." 

Kosaka also works with pro- 
grammers who may be hundreds of 
miles away. As a game designer and 
an artist himself, he sends samples 
of sprites and storyboards to the 
programmers for their development. 
Then, once the programming itself 
has started, Kosaka and the pro- 
grammers go back and forth decid- 

28 COMPUTEI's Gazatle November 1986 



ing what's possible to accomplish. 

He's seen the way that today's 
computers, especially the Commo- 
dore 64, can produce results far be- 
yond what programmers just two 
years ago felt were possible. "It's 
fascinating. It's the same basic ma- 
chine, but a lot of new things are 
going on with it. And a lot of that is 
experience, hacking away at it." 

Garry Kitchen is another suc- 
cessful program designer who's 
made a transition from working 
alone to working with a co-designer. 
After creating Activision's The De- 
signer's Pencil by himself. Kitchen 
began work on what was to become 
the popular GameMaker program. 

GameMaker is a package that 
lets the nonprogrammer create 
workable, stand-alone action 
games, including sprites, sound ef- 
fects, music, and background 
scenes. Just as commercial program 
designers now use their own devel- 
opment libraries and refined tools, 
GameMaker lets the nonprogram- 
mer have much the same thing — 
only less powerful, 

"The GameMaker code is prob- 
ably 150K; it takes up almost all of 
one side of a disk," notes Kitchen. 
Since GameMaker is essentially 
composed of five separate sound 
and graphics modules. Kitchen 
brought in programmer and musi- 
cian Alex DeMeo to create the 
SoundMaker and MusicMaker sec- 
tions of the program. All five mod- 
ules must work together, so Kitchen 
and DeMeo had to carefully design 
and program each section. 

"It's increasingly difficult to 
work alone with that much memo- 
ry," says Kitchen. "You have to 
generate vast amounts of assembly 
language code." 

Nevertheless, Kitchen has not 
made the jump to a high-level pro- 
gramming language such as Pascal 
or C. He prefers to stay with ma- 
chine language despite the rigors 
such a course involves with large 
programs, "I'm always dedicated to 
maxing out the hardware. If I write 
a program in assembly language 
and someone else writes in C, my 
program will be better," 

What's more. Kitchen's current 
project, a new game, is so far a solo 
effort, He admits, however, that he 



may bring in sonje help on the 
graphics work, 

A Monk In A Monastery 

Chris Crawford maintains that 
there's still plenty of room for the 
program designer who's willing to 
invest thought and energy. In fact, 
he's convinced that it's this type of 
programmer who will, in the long 
run, prevail. And that includes pro- 
grammers working alone as well as 
design teams, Crawford, who is 
continually studying the evolution 
of computer programming, is the 
author of the book, The Art of Com- 
puter Game Design: Reflections of a 
Master Game Designer (Osborne/ 
McGraw-Hill). 

"The fundamental question 
here is. What is programming? 
We're in the middle of a transition 
from one regime to another. The 
first regime is the monk in the mon- 
astery copying a manuscript— the 
programmer does what the com- 
puter does well," says Crawford, 

"The new regime is program- 
ming as an act of communication: 
The emphasis is on what we should 
say. People will become bored with 
communication that says nothing. 
That's rather like opening a book 
that has an illuminated manuscript, 
but is nothing more than 'Mary had 
a little lamb' — not saying anything. 

"I take a generally optimisdc 
view over the long term, but less in 
the short term," he adds. "When I 
take the long view, I can certainly 
say that the top ten products of 
1986 are better than those of 1983. 
There are a lot of weeds in the gar- 
den, but they're not choking out the 
roses." 

Whatever the course of pro- 
gram design, it's obvious that com- 
puters will always attract individual 
programmers like Crawford and 
Kitchen. Even with microcomputer 
memories quickly approaching one, 
two, and four megabytes, there will 
be designers who prefer a solo ap- 
proach to programming tasks. But, 
just as clearly, commercial software 
for microcomputers is now reach- 
ing a point where the combined tal- 
ents of a group of programmers can 
be a potent force in bringing new 
products to the software 
marketplace. a

A compiler is a powerful utility that translates programs zvr it- 
ten in a high-level programming language, like BASIC, into 
machine language that your computer can understand without 
first having to interpret each step. Here's a beginner's guide to 
one of the most useful items in a programmer's toolkit. 



The BASIC programming language 
has a buih-in speed limit that you'll 
encounter sooner or later. Let's say 
you've worked hard on writing a 
large and complex BASIC program. 
Perhaps it's an arcade-style game, 
or maybe it's a program to manipu- 
late 1000 customer records for a 
small- to medium-sized business. 
The program works; it mns without 
evident errors. But it's slow — ex- 
cruciatingly sluggish. You've hit the 
speed limit. 

The fact is, BASIC is not al- 
ways very good at high-speed 
screen movement, such as you'd 
need in an action game. And it's not 
very fast at sorting large lists, espe- 
cially if there are lots of strings of 
data involved. There are many oc- 
casions where a program written in 
BASIC will be excessively slow. 

Three Wise Men 

Let's say you bring your BASIC 
program to a local user group meet- 
ing and ask the two wisest pro- 
grammers for their advice. You're 

30 COMPUTE!'s Gazetle Novembef )986 



looking for techniques to put some 
more zip into the program. 

The first one, an experienced 
BASIC programmer, says, "I think 1 
see a subroutine that could be re- 
written. And this section should be 
removed and changed to a three-di- 
mensional array. You know, of 
course, that this bubble sort is not 
as efficient as a quick sort, although 
a shell sort might be acceptable. 
Yes, give me a week or two and I 
could have it running 20 percent 
faster, I'll speed it up, Why, my 
notebook is full of hints and...," 

The second one, the best ma- 
chine language programmer around, 
interrupts, "Yes, your collection of 
hints and tricks, I know. But that's 
just BASIC, I could rewrite it in ma- 
chine language, using my own al- 
gorithms and relative files and 
perhaps even some sprites and al- 
ternate video banks, Hmmm, that 
would be a nice touch. Of course, it 
might take a month or so to con- 
vert, but it would be worth it." 

Then a third person you've 



never seen before speaks up. "Ex- 
cuse me; this is my first meeting 
and I don't know a lot about pro- 
gramming, but I might be able to 
help. Give me a minute or two." 

He comes forward with a disk 
in hand, types a few commands, 
switches disks, presses a key, and 
waits for a few minutes. Your origi- 
nal program is changed, almost 
magically, into a new program that 
runs about four times faster, and 
not a single line has been changed. 
What's happened? Your slow 
BASIC program has been compiled. 

The BASICS Of Speed 

A BASIC compiler can significantly 
speed up a BASIC program by con- 
verting it into a form that's essen- 
tially machine language (ML), To 
understand how this is possible, we 
should first take a look at what hap- 
pens when you run a normal (un- 
compiled) BASIC program. 

Consider the PRINT com- 
mand. Its purpose seems simple 
enough — it prints something, 
usually to the screen — but it can 
perform a wide variety of actions: 

PRINT 

PRINT "HELLO" 
PRINT A 
PRINT ABS(A-i-B) 

PRINT "THE NUMBER"; LOG(VAL(AS)); 
'TS THE NATURAL LOG OF ";A$

When a program is running 
and a PRINT statement comes up, 
BASIC has to analyze the context. Is 
it a single PRINT with nothing after 
it? Is it followed by a string inside 
quotation marks? Does it refer to a 
variable? A function? A series of 
strings, functions, and variables 
separated by semicolons? 

You might think of PRINT as a 
single command, but it has many 
flavors. Before your computer exe- 
cutes a PRINT statement, it has to 
scan forward in the line to decide 
which sort of PRINT you intend to 
use. If there are parentheses, the 
process gets more complicated — 
the computer has to build up the 
meaning of the phrase by starting at 
the innermost parentheses and 
building outwards. 

There's also a second stage, at 
least when variables are involved. 
After the computer has figured out 
that PRINT AB means that it's sup- 
posed to print the number held in 
the variable AB, it has to find the 
variable's location in memory. If 57 
variables have been defined before 
AB is used for the first time, it will 
be 58th on the list of variables and 
the PRINT routine will have to 
search through all 58 variables 
before AB can be located. When AB 
is finally found, its value will be 
printed out. 

A Matter Of Interpretation 

This process of taking apart a line 
while the program is running — fig- 
uring out what a single command is 
supposed to do, analyzing the con- 
text, looking up variables, and so 
on — is called interpreting. While a 
BASIC program is running, every 
command that's executed has to be 
interpreted first. Interpreting takes 
time and generally slows down the 
program. 

A compiler speeds things up 
by interpreting some or all of the 
commands before the program is 
run. For example, a compiler might 
examine a command such as 
PRINT AB and assign a small por- 
tion of memory to this variable AB; 
let's say AB is going to occupy loca- 
tion 5003. The compiler will then 
store in the compiled program a 
command that reads something like 
this; PRINT (the value at 5003). 

Instead of having to look up 
the variable's location when the 

32 COMPUrers Gaiene November 1986 



program is running, which is what 
the uncompiled program will do, 
the compiler figures out the address 
at the time the program is com- 
piled. When the compiled program 
is run, the computer can go directly 
to that address instead of spending 
time looking through memory for a 
variable. 

As another example, consider 
the line A = C*34.85, which multi- 
plies a variable C by 34.85 and as- 
signs the result to the variable A. In 
a standard BASIC program, the 
computer will have to find the 
number in C and then find the 
floating-point equivalent of the five 
characters "34.85" (floating-point 
format is a way of representing 
numbers that makes it easier to per- 
form mathematical operations). 
The two numbers will then be mul- 
tiplied together and the result 
stored in A. 

A compiler has to go through 
the same steps, but most of them 
happen at the time the BASIC pro- 
gram is compiled. The compiler fig- 
ures out the floating-point format 
of the number 34.85 and decides 
ahead of time where A and C will 
be stored. When you run the com- 
piled program, the math is much 
faster because the computer doesn't 
have to spend time translating 
numbers and looking up variables. 
The compiler has already done much 
of the work — the interpreting. 

One more example: A com- 
mand such as GOTO 780 causes 
several actions to take place. First, 
the computer translates the three 
characters "780" to a binary integer 
(in low-byte/high-byte format), be- 
cause that's how line numbers are 
stored in memory. It then compares 
this number to the current line be- 
ing executed. If 780 is smaller, the 
program goes back to the first line 
of the program and searches 
through every line number, looking 
for line 780. If 780 is higher than 
the current line number, the com- 
puter starts searching forward in 
memory from where the program 
is. Finally, control is transferred to 
line 780.' 

Compare that to how a compil- 
er handles the GOTO. It, too, has to 
translate the number 780 to an inte- 
ger. It also has to locate the actual 
line and the equivalent memory ad- 
dress within the compiled program. 



Finally, it inserts a machine lan- 
guage jump (JMP) instruction at the 
appropriate place in the program. 
But all of the translating and 
searching happens during compila- 
tion, not while the program is run- 
ning. The result, of course, is a 
faster program. The compiler does a 
lot of the work ahead of time so the 
program can be speedier when the 
compiled version is run, 

A Few Handicaps 

As useful as they are, compilers do 
have some drawbacks and short- 
comings. 

One problem is that some 
BASIC compilers support only a 
subset of BASIC commands. There 
are some keywords they don't rec- 
ognize, so you can't use these com- 
mands in your programs. (Some 
compilers do support all BASIC 
commands, so this is not always a 
problem.) 

Some compilers are extremely 
fast when programs are limited to 
integer math (whole numbers), but 
not when fractions and decimal 
points are included. In a financial 
program that uses percentages and 
dollar amounts rounded to the 
nearest penny, the rime savings af- 
forded by a compiler might not be 
very significant. Again, this de- 
pends on the individual compiler. 

Programmers who program in- 
teractively generally prefer inter- 
preted languages. They like being 
able to type a few lines, run the pro- 
gram, change a variable or two, run 
it again, add a subroutine, use 
GOTO to test the routine, and so 
on. With BASIC, you can have the 
best of both worlds. Use the inter- 
preter to write the program and test 
it. Then, when it's all done, you can 
compile it to make it run faster. 
Some languages are available only 
in a compiled version, which means 
a few seconds (or possibly several 
minutes) of waiting for the source 
file to be compiled before you can 
test it. Interactive programmers 
suggest that this pause stifles their 
creativity. 

One thing that stops program- 
mers from using compilers is the 
fact that a compiled program is 
often several times longer than the 
uncompiled version. An already 
long program may compile into a 
version that's too big for memory. 
Or, if the program fits memory.

there may not be enough room left 
for all the variables. 

Some Comn:iodore owners ar- 
gue that compilers are nice, but if 
what you want is flat-out speed of 
execution, nothing beats machine 
language (ML). A well-written ML 
program will almost always beat 
the speed of a compiled program. 
You don't necessarily have to write 
a whole program in ML; if the slow 
part of the program is the alphabet- 
izing routine, you can use an ML 
sort program to take care of the 
problem. 

Beyond BASIC 

So far, we've discussed only com- 
pilers that speed up BASIC pro- 
grams. But compilers are also 
available for Pascal, C, Forth, and 
other programming languages. 

A compiled language generally 
requires that you type in the pro- 
gram (also called source code) using 
a word processor or a text editor 
program. When the source code is 
finished, you save it to disk and run 
the compiler program. The compil- 
er then creates the runnable pro- 
gram (the object code). To make a 
change, you must load the word 
processor or editor again, reload the 
source code, insert corrections, 
save, and recompile. It's rare to find 
a language that includes both an in- 
terpreter and a compiler, although 
both are usually available in Forth. 

You should also be aware that 
there are two types of compilers. 
The first kind compiles the source 
code directly into machine lan- 
guage. The second creates a file 
written in pseudo-code {p-code). A 
p-code program is then combined 
with a runtime package that in- 
cludes math routines, printing rou- 
tines, and all the other features of 
the language. You may have to load 
the runtime package as a separate 
program or use a compiler com- 
mand to append it to the end of the 
p-code portion of the program. 

We can only begin to scratch 
the surface here in detailing all of 
the many features related to differ- 
ent compilers. For more infor- 
mation, contact the following 
manufacturers about their particu- 
lar compilers for the Commodore 
64 and 128. While this list is not a 
comprehensive survey of all com- 
pilers available, those listed here 
should help you get started.

The PRINT Statement 



Larry Cotton 



As promised, we're going to look at 
more uses for PRINT, one of the 
most versatile BASIC statements. 
The best way to get familiar with 
PRINT is to write simple programs 
which feature it, which we'll do this 
month. 

But first, you need to know 
how to save a BASIC program on a 
disk. The procedure is as follows; 

1. The disk must be compatible 
with Con\modore computers. Al- 
most all are. If you have any 
doubts, buy your disks from a deal- 
er who knows what he's selling. 

2. A new disk must be set up 
(formatted) to receive information 
(files). To format a disk, put a new 
disk (or one that contains expend- 
able files) in the drive and close the 
door. For the Commodore 64 or 
VIC, type 

OPEN lS,8,lSrPRINT#15,"N0:MISC, 
GZ":CLOSE IS 

and press RETURN. That statement 
will also work on the Plus/4, 16, 
and 128, but those computers also 
have a simpler statement that per- 
forms the same function. Type 
HEADER "MISC",DO,IGZ 

and press RETURN. 

After a couple of minutes the 
drive will stop running and the 
busy light will go out. The disk is 
now formatted and ready to receive 
information. You can substitute any 
name for the word MISC as long as 
it's not over 16 characters long. In 
the VIC/64 command, follow your 
disk's name with a comma and two 
characters for the disk ID. The ex- 
ample statement above uses the let- 
ters GZ for the disk ID, but you can 
use any two characters you like. 
Just be sure to give each disk a 
unique ID. For the HEADER com- 
mand, the ID is specified in the two 
characters following the ,1 at the 
end of the command. 
36 COMPUTSrs Gazette November 1986 



3. Make sure there is enough 
room on the disk for your program. 
(One program we'll write takes 
about two blocks — a measure of 
disk capacity). To check the con- 
tents (directory) of the disk on the 
VIC or 64, type 

LOAD "S",B 

and press RETURN. That command 
also works on the Plus/4, 16, and 
128, but those computers have a 
simple command to perform the 
same function. Type 
DIRECTORY 

and press RETURN, (The 128 also 
has a CATALOG command, which 
functions exactly the same as 
DIRECTORY.) 

4. To save a program on the 
formatted disk {the program, of 
course, must be in the computer's 
memory), type 

SAVE "PRINT EXAMPLES",8 

and press RETURN. As with the 
other statements, the Plus/4, 16, 
and 128 have a simpler form. Type 
DSAVE "PRINT EXAMPLES" 

and press RETURN. 

The drive will run, the busy 
light will come on, and your pro- 
gram will be saved on the disk. 
Substitute anything you want, up 
to 16 characters long, for the file- 
name PRINT EXAMPLES, Once 
the drive stops, you can turn the 
computer off, which erases your 
program. By the way, it's not a good 
idea to cram a disk full. The more 
programs you have on a disk, the 
more you stand to lose if the disk is 
accidentally damaged or erased. 

5. If you really like a program, 
save it on two disks. 

The Versatile 
PRINT Statement 

The Commodore 64 Programmer's 
Reference Guide says there is "no 
statement in BASIC with more vari- 
ety than the PRINT statement.. .it 



might almost be considered as a 
language of its own,,,," 

You already know that PRINT 
sends information directly to the 
TV or monitor screen. You can put 
words, numbers, and symbols any- 
where on the screen using only 
PRINT. It may be used in either the 
immediate mode (as a command you 
just type on screen and follow by 
pressing RETURN) or program mode 
(as a statement within a program). 

Be sure to remember that any 
time you type something in imme- 
diate mode, you must press the RE- 
TURN key when you're finished 
with the command, or when you 
want to see the results. 

And when you're typing in, or 
changing, BASIC program lines 
(they always have numbers in front 
of them), be sure to press RETURN 
to store each line in the computer's 
memory, I'm not always going to 
note that you should press RE- 
TURN, except in unusual circum- 
stances, 

(Many non-Commodore com- 
puters call the RETURN key the 
ENTER key. The Commodore 128 
computer has an ENTER key with 
its new numeric keypad. It serves 
the same purpose as RETURN.) 

Printing Variables 

Start by typing this; X = 4. You 
should press the RETURN key right 
after that. This causes the computer 
to "remember" what X is until you 
change it or reset the computer's 
memory. X is known as a variable, 
because its value can vary. 

When you assign a letter a val- 
ue, you can see what its value is by 
typing PRINT x, where x is the let- 
ter representing the variable, (Inci- 
dentally, you can abbreviate PRINT 
with a quesdon mark.) For instance, 
type: ? X. You should see 4 (assum- 
ing you typed X = 4 above). Now 
add something to X — say 5, like 
this: PRINT X -I- 5. You should see 
9. You can also assign another vari-

able, such as Y, for the 5. Type Y = 
5; then type PRINT X + Y. (Think 
of the impUcations for doing math 
on your computer. Later, we'll de- 
vote a column or two to BASIC 
math functions.) 

You can also make words vari- 
ables. How does the computer dis- 
tinguish between numbers and 
words? Use a $ sign after the vari- 
able letter to make it a word. For in- 
stance, type A$ = "PIECE " (note 
the space between the E and the 
quotation marks); then type PRINT 
A$. You should see the word PIECE 
printed out. 

Believe it or not, BASIC allows 
words to be added together. Kow? 
Type PRINT A$ + "OF CAKE" (al- 
ways remembering to press RE- 
TURN). You should see PIECE OF 
CAKE printed to the screen. 

As with numbers, you can use 
another variable — say, B$ — for 
"OF CAKE": Type B$ = "OF 
CAKE", and then type PRINT A$ 
+ B$. Voila. These word variables 
($) are called strings. A$ is called A- 
string, B$ is called B-string, and so 
on. There are probably as many ap- 
phcations for manipulating strings 
as there are for arithmetically ma- 
nipulating numbers. 

Printing Symbols 

Temporarily, we'll leave printing 
numbers and words, and go to the 
symbols that are on the front side of 
the computer's keys. These are 
called graphics characters, and are 
unique to Commodore. They have 
many uses. 

You can print these symbols to 
the screen by holding the SHIFT or 
the Commodore key while typing 
any key with a graphics character 
on it. The best way to learn to use 
symbols is to experiment. Because 
of the variety of symbols, it's possi- 
ble to create pictures, graphs, and 
charts, and to enhance the appear- 
ance of a printed screen by using 
the symbols to form borders and 
boxes. 

Moving The Cursor 

The cursor's position — the spot 
where things are printed on the 
screen — can also be controlled with 
the PRINT statement. Commodore 
uses a somewhat arcane method of 
indicating which way the cursor 
will move; a short BASIC program 
and practice are the best teachers 

40 COMPUTE! 's Gazette November J 986 



here. (Remember, you can use a ? 
instead of typing PRINT. When you 
LIST the program, the word PRINT 
will be displayed.) {DOWN} 
means you should press the cursor- 
down key, located next to the right 
SHIFT key. 

10 PRINT'TIRST" 

20 PRINT'SECOND {DOWN}" 

30 PRINT"THIRD" 
40 PRINT" {DOWN}" 
50 PRINT'TOURTH" 

Run the program and study the re- 
sults. Line 10 prints the first word, 
then moves the cursor to print the 
next item on the line immediately 
below. In line 20, however, there is 
a cursor-down character before the 
second quotation mark, which 
makes the cursor skip a blank line 
between the second and third words. 

Line 40 contains a cursor down 
on its own separate line, which 
yields two blank lines between the 
third and fourth words. 

Also try experimenting with 
cursor-right, -left, and -up charac- 
ters. If you'd like to save your ex- 
periments on disk, do so now. Then 
reset the computer by turning it off, 
then on. 

Other PRINT-ables 

There are several other miscella- 
neous, but very convenient, uses 
for the PRINT statement; 

1, Moving the cursor to the top 
left corner of the screen, 

2, Moving the cursor to the top 
left comer of the screen and clear- 
ing the screen at the same time. 

3, Changing text colors. 

4, Printing characters in reverse 
video, 

5, Printing blank lines, 

A Demonstration 

We'll type in another short BASIC 
program, line by line, which illus- 
trates all the discussed uses for the 
PRINT statement. It will print two 
messages inside a small border. 

The example program contains 
a number of underlined characters 
and words in braces ({ }), These are 
the gazette's way of representing 
characters which require special 
typing. You'll need to understand 
these listing conventions to type in 
any programs in the magazine. For 
example, when you see an under- 
lined character, you should hold 
down the SHIFT key while typing 



that character. For a detailed de- 
scription of the conventions, refer 
to the article "How to Type In 
COMPUTEl's GAZETTE Programs" 
elsewhere in this issue. 

Let's begin the program with a 
line that turns the screen black — 
both background and border. To do 
this, we must use BASIC statements 
we haven't covered yet — POKE on 
the 64 and COLOR for the Plus/4, 
16, and 128. We'll look at these in a 
future column, but for now, just 
type line 10 as you see it. 

For the Commodore 64: 

10 POKE S3280,0:POKE 53281,0 

For the Plus/4, 16, or 128: 
10 COLOR 0,1:COLOR 4,1 

Now let's clear the screen 
(which also moves the cursor to the 
upper left corner of the screen — 
called the home position): 

20 PRINT"{CLR}" 

The cursor needs to be moved 
down somewhat from the top of the 
screen: 

30 PRINT" {6 DOWN}" 

(If you examine the gazette's list- 
ing conventions, you'll notice that 
the {6 DOWN} means to press the 
cursor down key six times.) 

The next line prints the top of a 
horizontally centered border. It's 
composed of cursor-right, SHIFT- 
U, SHIFT-*, and SHIFT-I charac- 
ters. Notice the rounded comer and 
horizontal line symbols on the U, *, 
and I keys. The cursor-rights are 
necessary because the cursor always 
starts at the left edge of the next line 
down after a PRINT statement. 
40 PRINT"{9 RIGHT}y{17 1)1" 
(Again, you'll need to understand 
the gazette's listing conventions to 
enter this line properly. For ex- 
ample, the [17 1} means to hold 
down the SHIFT key and type the * 
key 17 times.) 

To PRINT the sides of the bor- 
der, we'll use the same program 
line, repeated seven times. There 
are other ways to do this, but let's 
save them for another time. Type in 
the line 50 shown below and press 
RETURN, Then move the cursor 
back up over the 5 in the line num- 
ber and type a 6 to make 60; then 
press RETURN again. LIST the pro- 
gram. You'll see both lines 50 and 
60, and they will be identical. Do 
the same for lines 70-110. This is

what makes BASIC programming 
so easy on Commodore computers. 
50 PRINT"{9 RIGHT}B{17 SPACES }B" 

The bottom of the border is al- 
most like the top, so let's make a 
virtual copy of line 40. Just move 
the cursor to line 40 and type 120 
over the 40, change the SHIFT-U to 
SHIFT-J and the SHIFT-I to SHIFT- 
K, and press RETURN. 
120 PRINT" {9 RIGHT }j[{ 17 i)K" 

The next three lines assign nu- 
meric variables X and Y and string 
variables A$ and B$: 

130 X = 4:Y - S 

140 A$ = "X IS EQUAL TO" 

150 BS = "y IS EQUAL TO" 

OK, the border has been taken 
care of, and the values have been 
assigned to variables. We want to 
PRINT all four numeric and string 
variables inside the border. To do 
this we must move the cursor up: 

160 PRINT" {7 UP}" 

The next line will move the 
cursor over from the left edge of the 



screen and print the first message. 
The first character typed after the 
opening quotation mark is CTRL-8, 
which changes the text color to 
yellow. 

Note that the variables A$ and 
X are typed right after the second 
quotation mark. This insures that 
what you want to print stays on the 
same line with the cursor after it's 
been moved to the right. 
170 FRINT"{YEL}{11 RIGHT}"AS;X 

Now we want to print a blank 
line between messages. One way to 
do this is to type PRINT as a single 
statement. 

180 PRINT 

Next, the cursor must be 
moved to the right and the other 
two variables printed. This time, 
let's print them in reverse. The first 
character typed inside the quotes is 
CTRL-9, which reverses the text on 
the Commodore 64. Note again 
that the B$ and Y are typed imme- 
diately outside the quotes. 



190 PRINT"(RVS){n RIGHT}"B$;Y 

Last, let's send the cursor back 
to the upper left corner of the 
screen — the home position. 
200 PRINT"{HOME}" 

What do the colons in lines 10 
and 130 do? Their main purpose is 
to allow you to combine two BASIC 
statements on one line. If the state- 
ments were placed in separate lines, 
the program would run the same. 
Colons often separate BASIC state- 
ments which are similar. They 
make the program more compact, 
and, when used judiciously, easier 
for others to understand. 

Have you run the program yet? 
If not, do so, and don't forget to 
save it on disk for future reference. 

Next month we't! look at more 
features of the PRINT statement, 
and some new BASIC commands.

Tim J. Midkift, Editorial Programmer 



Challenge a friend in this fast -paced, action-strategy game for 
the Commodore 64. It's ivritten entirely in machine language 
for rapid play and smooth movement. Two joysticks are 
required. 



This two-player action game can be 
played at two conceptual levels: 
When you first play, it seems to be 
purely an action game — all speed 
and reflexes — but after you and 
your opponent master the basics of 
the game, you'll discover the im- 
portance of having a strategy. 

The object of "Bump-N-Run" 
is to get the ball and shoot it into 
the other player's goal. Of course, 
your opponent is trying to do the 
same, and this is the conflict which 
is the heart of the game. 

Typing It In 

Bunip-N-Run is a machine lan- 
guage game, so you must use 
"MLX," the machine language en- 
try program found elsewhere in this 
issue, to type it in. Be sure you un- 
derstand how to use MLX before 
you begin entering the data for 
Bump-N-Run. After loading and 
running MLX, respond to the 
prompts with the following: 

starting address: COOO 
Ending address: C6A7 

Save a copy to disk or tape 
when you've finished typing. To 

44 COMPUTEfs Gazette November 1986 



load the game, type LOAD"BUMP- 
N-RUN",8,1 (tape users should 
type LOAD "BUMP-N-RUN ",1,1) 
and SYS 49152 to begin play. Be 
sure to have two joysticks plugged 
in. Press RESTORE to exit the 
game, and SYS 49152 to replay. 




One player has the ball attd is threaten- 
ing to score. The oiher is goiuj^ to fry to 
steal the ball by bumping his opponent. 



Bumping And Running 

As with many computer games, the 
best way to learn this one is by 
playing it. The game begins with 
the ball in the middle of the court 



and each player guarding his own 
goal. The joystick in port 1 controls 
the purple player. The yellow play- 
er is controlled by the joystick in 
port 2, Catch the ball by touching it 
with your player. Your opponent 
can then steal the ball by bumping 
into you. The direction and speed 
your player travels is controlled by 
the joystick. When you first push 
the joystick, you move slowly; keep 
pushing and you'll accelerate. Press 
the fire button to shoot the ball. 
When the ball is released, you lose 
your speed, but the ball continues 
on with your previous speed and 
direction. Make sure your shot is 
accurate, because once you shoot 
the ball you can't catch it again un- 
til it bounces off a wall. Remember 
that you can steal the ball from your 
opponent at any time simply by 
bumping him. The first player to 
score 15 goals wins, and the game is 
reset when both players press the 
fire button. 

Here are a few more details 
concerning the physics of the game. 
When players collide, their veloci- 
ties and directions are exchanged. 
Collisions with the walls cause 
players to bounce back. A player 
may go beyond the walls only if he 
is pushed by another player.

Here's an example of bow to tap the power of BASIC 7.0. It's a 
short program and uses no machine language— yet the result is 
a fine, fast, two-player, hl-res action game. For the Commodore 
128. 



"Obstacle 128" is a short two-player 
arcade-style game for the 128. At a 
length of roughly IK, it's a much 
more condensed program than a 
similar version for the 64 would be. 
The game concept is not new. 
It's basically a version of the classic 
Tron game where two light-cycles 
duel to see who survives. Four 
choices face you as your light-cycle 
tools around the playing area: Do 
you move up, down, left, or right? If 
you make no choice, you continue 
in the direction in which you were 
already moving. 



Trailing behind each player is a 
wall of light, which both must avoid 
hitting. Eventually one player or the 
other gets trapped in an ever- 
shrinking area and crashes into a 
wall. The survivor wins one point. 

After typing Obstacle 128 in, 
save a copy. To play, load it and 
type RUN. Be sure to have two joy- 
sticks plugged in. The first player to 
accumulate five points is declared 
the winner. There is some variety in 
every battle as the size of the arena 
changes and the players start mov- 
ing in different directions. There are 



several strategies to this game, but 
in general the player who carves 
out the most area and commits the 
fewest mistakes will be the winner. 

How It Works 

The program is divided into three 
parts: the setup of the screen in 
lines 10-40, joystick control and 
graphics in lines 50-200, and sound 
effects and scoring in lines 210- 
320, Let's look at the program in 
some detail. 

In line 10, GRAPHIC 3,1 turns 
on the multicolor graphics mode 
and clears the screen. SOUND 
3,100,30000 generates an incessant 
beat of a low frequency (100 cycles 
per second) for 30000 jiffies, so this 
will last 8 minutes and 20 seconds, 
enough for the whole game.

Note how both players have closely 
followed each other in an attempt to 
cut each other off. Current positions 
are in the upper left section of the 
screen. 

Line 20 sets the background 
color, the border color, and multi- 
color 1 and 2. A random number 
between 30 and 69 determines the 
size of the playing field. The handy 
CHAR command places text any- 
where on the screen. The +S and 
— S in the DRAW commands are 
used to shrink the y-axis (the 
height) of the arena. 

Line 40 generates the locations 
and the starting positions of the 
combatants in the arena. X and Y 
are the x and y coordinates for the 



position of the first player, and A 
and B are the coordinates of the sec- 
ond player. In Une 40, X is subject to 
a little randomness, as is A, so that 
the players start at different ,t coor- 
dinates when the game begins. Y 
and B are set at 100, so both players 
will start in the middle of the screen. 
Next, random values are as- 
signed to J and K, the directions of 
movement of player 1. If J is 1, the 
player travels to the right, and if J is 
— 1, the player travels to the left. If 
K is 1, the player moves 4own, and 
if K is —1, the player moves up. 
Since this game has no diagonal 
movements, one of the two direc- 
tions has to be zero, while the other 
is nonzero. L and M are the corre- 
sponding movement directions for 
player 2. Notice that L = ] and 
M = K, so both players will start 
traveling in the same direction at 
the beginning of the game. 

The Main Loop 

After the board is set up, we're 
ready to start the game. Lines 
50-200 are the main loop, where all 
the action takes place. The joystick 
reading function (JOY) is quite 
handv. In line 50, J1=J0Y(1) as- 



signs a number to variable ]1 de- 
pending on where joystick one is 
pointing. If the joystick is untouched 
(centered), Jl equals zero and the 
program skips the next four lines. 

Lines 60-90 control the direc- 
tion of movement of player one, ad- 
justing the X and y coordinates based 
on the current state of the joystick. 

Line 100 sees it the cyclist 
bumps into anything such as his 
trail, the other player, or the arena 
walls. LOCATE X-I-J,Y-|-K moves 
the pixel cursor to the new position, 
which is calculated by adding the 
direction of movement to the play- 
er's current position. Then we read 
the dot color of the selected pixel, 
using RD0T(2). If the color is either 
2 or 3, player one has crashed into 
something and lost a battle. Thus, 
in line 100, if RDOT(2) > 1 THEN 
J3 = l, J3 is a flag which signals 
whether the player has crashed or 
not. Line 110 updates the position 
of player one, and the DRAW com- 
mand puts a small dot with color 3 
on the screen representing the 
player. 

Lines 120-180 are the analo- 
gous lines for player two. The only 
thing different is that new variables

are needed to store the data for 
player two. 

Line 190 tests whether either 
player has crashed. If so, the pro- 
gram jumps to the scoring section 
in lines 210-310. Line 200 directs 
the program back to the start of the 
joystick-reading part beginning at 
line 50 to continue with the move- 
ment of both players. 

The final part of the program 
contains the routines for scoring, 
sound effects, and printing crash 
messages on the screen. Line 210 
makes an explosion sound and 
prints the CRASHED message for 
player 2. Lines 220-230 detect the 
rare occurrence when both players 
crash at the same time. Line 240 
prints the CRASHED message for 
player 1. Line 260 creates another 
explosion, and the computer 
SLEEPS for one second so that the 
players can view the screen for a 
short time. The two scores are con- 
verted to strings, because CHAR 
can't handle numeric variables, and 
printed to the hi-res screen. Lines 
280-290 check whether either 
player has won five matches. If so, 
a congratulatory message is dis- 
played for the winner, and the pro- 
gram jumps to line 310. Otherwise 
J3 and J4 (the collision flags) are re- 
set to zero and another round begins. 

There are several ways pro- 
grammers could modify and en- 
hance the game. When a player 
crashes into a wall, perhaps you 
could use CIRCLE to draw a series 
of concentric circles to mark the 
spot where the crash happened. 
Then flash the hi-res screen by al- 
ternating background colors 
(COLOR 0) a few dmes. You might 
also want to experiment with the 
sound effects and the victory song 
at the end of the game. To make the 
game more challenging, use CIR- 
CLE or BOX to put some barriers on 
the screen. The players would face 
the additional challenge of avoid- 
ing the obstacles. 

It wouldn't be especially diffi- 
cult to convert Obstacle 128 to a 
one-player game — you against the 
computer. A simple technique for 
moving the computer player is to 
use RDOT to check for an imminent 
collision, then pick a right or left 
turn, A slightly more intelligent rou- 
tine would look ahead, to see which 
direction has more empty space.

Match Blox 

Mark Tuttle 

// i/oM like puzzles, try your hand at one of the five variations 
of this entertainiiig solitaire game for the 64, Plus/4, and 26. A 
joystick is required. 

"Match Blox" is a solitaire puzzle 
game in which you try to solve any 
of the five variations in the fewest 
number of moves possible. Each 
game is played on a 3 X 3 matrix of 
squares, and each square is colored 
blue or orange. The object is simple: 
Manipulate the squares until they 
match the pattern displayed. 

The program listing {Program 
1) for Match Blox is for the Commo- 
dore 64. If you have a Plus/4 or 16, 
type in Program 1, but substitute 
the lines from Program 2 for the 
corresponding lines in the Program 
1 listing. 

After you type in the program, 
save a copy. To use it, plug a joy- 
stick into port 2 (port 1 on the 
Plus/4 or 16), load it, and type 
RUN. The program first displays 
the titles of the game variations, 
numbered 1-5. A box at the bottom 
of the screen displays the number 1, 
which corresponds to the first game 
variation, (If you want to start with 
this one, just press the fire button.) 

so COMPUTERS Gazette Novamber 19B6 




You must think ahead for success in 
this solitaire stralegi/ game for the 
Commodore 64. 

To select any of the five games, 
move the joystick left or right. Right 
increments the variation number (it 
will roll over from 5 to 1), and left 
decrements the number (it will roll 
over from 1 to 5). Press the fire but- 
ton when the number displayed 
corresponds to the game you wish 
to play. 

The patterns to be matched for 
each of the game variations are as

SdENTISISi 




When we started our 
company on the west coast, 
people thought we were a little 
spaced out. So you can imag- 
ine their reactions when we 
announced we'd discovered 
a new universe. 

People laughed. People 
scoffed. And they really freaked 
out when we told them where 
we'd found it: 

Inside a Commodore 64. 

It's called GEOS. And it 
turns any Commodore into a 
powerful PC that holds its own 
against any computer, no matter 
what kind of fruit it was named 
after. 

GEOS: The superior 
intelligence. Of course, we 
always knew Commodores 
possessed superior brains. It just 
took GEOS to discover them. 

You see, GEOS opens your 
Commodore to a huge universe 
that can hold an infinite number of 
applications. Which means that 
GEOS can do just about anything 
the expensive PC's can do, 
including one thing they can't: 

Add even more GEOS 
applications that are being 
developed even as you read this. 

Increase your speed to 
warp factor 7. The first thing 
you notice with GEOS is how 
its diskTurbo speeds up your 
Commodore's disk loading and 
storing time. 







^ 



/ 



Not twice or three times as 
fast. But five to seven times 
faster than normal. Which lets 
you streak through files and 
documents at what seems like 
warp speed. 

And that saves you endless 
time. 



Every universe comes 
complete with a desk. The way 
to keep order in our universe 
is with the GEOS Desktop. It's 
just like your desk at home, only 
without the coffee stains. 

The Desktop keeps your art 
and documents filed, and comes 



W UNIVERSE 




with all the accessories you need 
to keep you organized: 

Aji alarm clock keeps you 
punctual. A notepad keeps your 
memos. And a calculator keeps 
your accountant honest. 

How to communicate 
with a new universe. With 
geoWrite, you can rearrange your 
written words. Move blocks of 
copy. Cut and paste. And even 
display your text in fonts of 
different styles and sizes, right 
on the screen. 

With geoPaint, you become 
a Michelangelo with a mouse. 




Sketching and painting with alt 
kinds of colors, textures and 
patterns. 

You can invert, mirror and 
rotate images. Insert them into 
your geoWrite documents. And 
save them in your GEOS Photo 
Album for use later. 

Finding your way through 
the universe. The most difficult 




thing about a new universe is 
finding your way around. But 
with GEOS, you only need to 
remember two things: 

Point and click. 

When GEOS offers you 
options, you just point to your 
answers and click your mouse or 
joystick. 

You want to draw? Point 
and click. 

You want to write? Point 
and click. 

You want to fill in that obtuse 
rhomboid with an air-brushed 
geometric pattern in a lighter 
shade of pink? Point and click. 

Easy, huh? And in case you 
ever do make a mistake, GEOS 
backs you up with an "Undo" 
feature that undoes the very last 
command you entered. 



il

Berkeley 
Softworks 



Running out of space. 

With GEOS, that's hardly likely. 
Because there's endless space in 
the universe for new applications. 

Unfortunately, there's only so 
much space in this ad. 

So zip down to your nearest 
software dealer. Tell him you want 
to explore the new universe in 
your Commodore.

ter and the pattern to be matched on 
the right. The computer randomly 
selects blue and orange squares, and 
places them on the game board. Be- 
cause the choices are random, there 
are over 500 possible initial configu- 
rations for each pattern, 

A flashing cursor appears at 
the center of the game board when 
play begins. Select the square you 
v^ish to change by moving the cur- 
sor with the joystick to the square 
and pressing the fire button. Only 
the orange squares may be changed. 
If you press the fire button while on 
a blue square, nothing happens. 
Choosing one of the four corner 
squares (1, 3, 7, or 9) reverses the 
color of that square and the three 
adjacent squares. Choosing an edge 
square {2, 4, 6, or 8) reverses its 
color as well as the two adjoining 
corner squares. If you select the 
center square, its color is reversed 
and so are the colors of the four 
edge squares.

Don't worry if at first it takes a 
long time to solve the puzzle. 
There's no limit to the number of 
moves you can make. A message 
will inform you when you solve the 
puzzle. In games 2-5, be careful not 
to change all the squares to blue. If 
you do, there are no legal moves 
available — remember, you can't 
reverse a blue square — and the 
game ends. It's suggested that you 
tackle game 1 (UNI-COLOR) first. 
It's the easiest of the five. When 
you've mastered this one, try the 
others. 

Strategy 

You'll probably develop your own 
way of solving the puzzles, but if 
you can't seem to get anywhere, try 
to establish some sort of symmetry 
on the board and then make moves 
which maintain that symmehy. This 
will make it easier to solve the puz- 
zle, since all the goals are symmetri- 
cal.

Vizawnte Classic 128 



Vizawriie Classic 328— written by Kevin 
Lacy, author of Omniwriter 64 and Vi- 
zastar 64 — may just be the most power- 
ful word processing tool presently 
available for the Commodore 128. 
Franl^ly, it's hard to imagine needing a 
word processor to do something that 
Vizawriie cannot do. Besides having all 
the standard word processing features 
that users have come to expect, such as 
moving, copying, and deleting blocks 
of text; searching and replacing words 
and phrases; and centering, justifica- 
tion, and highlighting of text, Vizawrite 
has many extraordinary features. Those 
include the ability to do news letter -like 
columns, a glossary of frequently used 
words and phrases for quick insertion, 
onscreen highlighting of text (boldface 
and/or underline), and automatic for- 
matting of each page as you type. Ex- 
cept for certain text enhancements, 
such as italics, Vizaivrite is a "what you 
see is what you get" word processor, 
permitting you to see onscreen what 
your document will look like when 
printed out. Vizawriie has over 59K of 
text memory, enough for a 25-30 page 
document. Of course, the program can 
link multiple files for creating extra long 
documents. To top it off, all of these 
features are in the 128's 2 MHz fast 
mode and are displayed in 80 columns. 

In addition to these many ad- 
vanced word processing features, Vi- 
zawrite provides a great degree of 
control and flexibility over the system. 
You can easily customize the display 
colors to your own choosing, and when 
a screen is customized and the file 
saved to disk, the color choices are 
saved along with it. A built-in calcula- 
tor with memory is available from a sin- 
gle keystroke, as well as online help 
windows that you can customize. A full 
range of disk commands is available 
from within the program — you can for- 
mat new disks; save, scratch, and verify 
files; and perform any DOS commands 
available from BASIC 7.0 (such as 
switching a 1571 from single-sided to 
double-sided format and vice versa). 

Vizawrite allows you to take full 
advantage of your printer's capabilities 
by employing a "printer profile" sys- 
tem allowing you to create a custom 
printer profile to meet the exact needs 

5a COMPUTEI's G«i»ff9 Novembsr 1986 



of your printer. The program then al- 
lows you to go through an extensive se- 
ries of options to define exactly what 
you want to print. Vizawrite's use of the 
printer is so extensive, however, that 
setting up a file to print the way you 
want may take some fime initially. Be- 
tween working through all the options 
and figuring out which are appropriate 
for use with your printer and the docu- 
ment in question, preparing to print is 
not simple. Fortunately, once you've 
completed the exercise, your choices 
can be saved with the file. I found it 
useful to set up the desired printing op- 
tions (and screen colors) and save a 
blank file to disk. Then before creating 
a new document, I load in the blank file 
containing the desired options and save 
the time and trouble of setting up the 
options for every new document. 

An additional printing capability of 
Vizawrite is its built-in proportional and 
near-letter-quality (NLQ) fonts. The 
program offers four different propor- 
tionally spaced fonts and three different 
NLQ fonts. However, 1 could not get all 
of the proportionally spaced and NLQ 
fonts to work with my Epson printer. 
Also, the NLQ fonts only permit 49-1/2 
lines per page, as opposed to the stan- 
dard 66 lines per page. The fonts that 
worked with my Epson looked ex- 
tremely good. In fact, the Vizawrite 
user's manual was produced using the 
program's NLQ fonts. 

Usually, the price of such power 
and versatility in a word processor is 
complexity and difficulty of use. How- 
ever, Vizawrite does an admirable job of 
making itself relatively easy to use. Vi- 
zawrite ufilizes a command bar at the 
top of the display screen and drop- 
down menus for most file, disk, print- 
ing, and utility commands. To activate 
the command bar, simply press the 
Commodore key; then use the cursor 
and RETURN key to drop a particular 
menu down into its subcommands. 
From there, you again use the cursor 
and RETURN keys to activate the de- 
sired subcommand. However, once you 
become familiar with the commands 
available, you can employ a much fast- 
er command execution by simply press- 
ing the Commodore key and then the 
key corresponding to the first letter of 



the words representing the desired 
command and subcommand. 

The word processing commands 
are fairly standard, using function and 
control keys. There are two quirks that 
may represent differences between Eu- 
ropean and American command con- 
ventions. First, the DELete key erases 
the character on which the cursor is 
placed. Second, commands executed 
with the CONTROL key (such as CON- 
TROL-E, which begins and ends the 
boldfacing of a portion of text) are ac- 
complished by pressing CONTROL 
and releasing it, then pressing the E 
key. The most common convention re- 
quires holding down CONTROL while 
pressing the other key to complete the 
command. 

The formatting of text is accom- 
plished by the use of embedded codes 
and what Vizawrite calls a format litte — 
a dotted line that appears above the text 
to be manipulated by the desired for- 
mat commands, such as tabs, margins, 
line spacing, column setting, and page 
breaks. Additionally, special printer 
codes can be defined on a format line, 
allowing the user to embed the neces- 
sary codes in the text to produce special 
characters or text enhancements, such 
as international characters, italics, and 
super- or subscripts. 

While the embedded codes, format 
lines, and faint dots Vizawriie places in 
text between words— and wherever else 
the user leaves a space using the space 
bar — may be visually distracting, Vi- 
zawrite provides the option to hide such 
formatting symbols. You simply press 
CONTROL and then H, and the for- 
matting symbols are "hidden" on the 
screen, thereby permitting you to view 
your document almost as it would ap- 
pear when printed on paper. I say at- 
mosi because some text enhancements 
are not displayed on the screen, such as 
italics, condensed print, superscripts, 
and subscripts. Seeing your document 
as it will appear on paper as you are 
editing is a tremendous feature in a 
word processor— one that cannot be 
overstated. Besides allowing you to be 
more creafive while writing, the hide 
option saves you a significant amount 
of time because you don't have to 
switch between an edit and a preview 
mode or print out the document to see 
how it will appear on paper. 







One for all.

Yet another great feature of Viza- 
write is its integrated 30,000-word dic- 
tionary, which allows you to access the 
spell -checking functions from the com- 
mand bar without having to save your 
document file to disk before checking 
the spelling. The spell-checking abili- 
ties include listing the words in your 
document alphabetically, according to 
usage, and by unrecognized words. 
Provided are several utilities which 
allow creation of a user dictionary for 
specialized use, and expansion and re- 
structuring of the existing dictionary. 

The package includes a disk con- 
taining the Vizawrite program on one 
side and the dictionary on the other, 
and a cartridge for the user port. Since 
the cartridge must be in place before the 
program will load, the disk is supplied 
to the user without copy protection. 
This enables you to easily make backup 
and working copies of the program and 
dictionary files. I must note, however, 
that I'm not crazy about having to plug 
in the cartridge every time I want to use 
the program. Between the Vizawriie 
cartridge, a cartridge to use Vizawrite 
128, and my fast load cartridge, I find 
myself pulling cartridges in and out 
much more often than I'd like. 

The program works with either a 
1571 or 1541 disk drive, but is fairly 
slow to load even on the 1571. Once 
loaded, however, the program disk is 
no longer needed, thereby eliminating 
most of the disk-swapping headaches 
of a single-disk-drive user. In fact, the 
program is almost easier to use with a 
single disk drive. While Vizawrite al- 
lows the user to define which drive the 



program should look to, it does not 
allow simultaneous use of two disk 
drives. Frankly, I find it easier to flip the 
lever on the disk drive and switch disks 
than to remember the command to 
switch to a different drive number, 

Vizawrite is not a program you can 
load up and use immediately. Fortu- 
nately, it comes with a fairly well- 
written and concise manual, as well as a 
couple of example document files on 
the program disk. While infrequent us- 
ers will probably find themselves leaf- 
ing through the manual periodically to 
refresh their memory on certain com- 
mands, the frequent user should be able 
to shelve the manual after the first few 
documents produced. 

All in all, Vizawrite is a top-notch 
program. Its power, versatility, and de- 
sign leave little room for disappoint- 
ment. It could become a, if not the, 
word processor of choice for the 126. 
The only noticeable shortcoming is the 
absence of an option to use a 40- 
column display, which makes the pro- 
gram unusable to 128 owners with a 
40-column monitor. Solid State Soft- 
ware has indicated that enhancements 
to Vizawrite are in the works that will 
enable it to take advantage of the RAM 
expanders for the 128 as RAMdisks, 
and to add a font editor permitting you 
to define your own font styles.

Nine Princes In Amber 



An interesting recent development in 
interactive fiction is the adaptation of 
novels into computer text adventures. 
While Infocom's The Hitchhiker's Guide 
to the Galaxy is among the most famous 
of these, Telarium Software has special- 
ized in them from the beginning. With 
early titles such as Fahrcniteit 451, Ren- 
dezvous with Rama, and DragotiworSd, 
Telarium has had plenty of experience 
bridging the two fields. 

Nine Princes in Amber ior the Com- 
modore 64 demonstrates the pros and 
cons of such an enterprise. Based on the 
first two novels of Roger Zelazny's 
well-known Amber fantasy series, the 
story takes you, in the role of Corwin of 
Amber, through many adventures on 
your hopeful path to tlie Amber throne. 
You begin, like the Corwin of the book, 
in a hospital bed, the victim of amnesia, 
and from there you play out many of 
the book's most important scenes. You 
meet your siblings— Eric, Random, Flora, 
Deirdre, Julian, and others — whom^ou 

60 COMPUTEI's Gaiene Novsmbsr 1966 



try to ally with you in your quest for the 
throne. On the way you must learn the 
art of fencing, and you must successfully 
walk the Pattern of Amber. 

If you understood the previous 
paragraph, you'll enjoy Telarium's 
product. You have also read the books. 
If you didn't understand the paragraph, 
you still might enjoy the product, but 
that is neariy impossible to predict. The 
major difficulty in adapting novels to 
interactive fiction is, I think, finding the 
balance between those who know the 
original and those who do not. If the 
adventure slavishly reproduces the 
novel, players who know the story will 
quickly become bored. But if knowl- 
edge of the original is assumed, players 
who have not read it will easily become 
confused. Nine Princes in Amber reflQcis 
these problems, but in the end it is a 
creditable adaptation. 

When I first tried the interactive 
version, 1 had not yet read the original. 
The whole thing was very strange to 



me, but after a while 1 gained a feel for 
Zelazny's world and an interest in Cor- 
win's situation. But then 1 hit a snag, a 
puzzle I simply could not solve. So 1 did 
the only reasonable thing: I gave up. 
Restoring games with the 1541 drive 
encourages surrender. 

Then I read Zelazny's books, and I 
decided to return to the game. Every- 
thing became, of course, much clearer, 
and 1 began to move through the story 
very quickly. I even got past the snag, 
because it is something Corwin experi- 
ences in the novel. Suddenly, though, I 
realized I was doing everything per- 
haps too quickly; having read the 
books, the challenge simply wasn't 
there. I began to wonder if 1 was going 
to just walk through the entire thing.

As it turns out, I didn't. After a cer- 
tain point, the adventure veers signifi- 
cantly from the course of the book. A 
new plot emerges, reminiscent of the 
original, but not merely a clone. You 
still play the 'role of Corwin, but Cor- 
win 's new tasks differ from his original 
tasks. But then 1 began to wonder if an 
Amber newcomer, one who had never 
read the books, would ever have made 
it this far. I know I wouldn't have, and 1 
suspect the same is true for others. Still, 
even for newcomers, the story is a good 
one, and those who hit snags can al- 
ways run to the library or the bookstore 
and read the original. 

Nine Princes, then, combines the 
established story with a new one. In do- 
ing so, it finds the balance between 
Amber newcomers and Zolazny veter- 
ans. Newcomers can play and enjoy the 
game, albeit with a fair bit of difficulty, 
and veterans will find something new 
to interest them. 

The game has two outstanding fea- 
tures. First, it uses a large vocabulary 
for interaction and diplomacy. Con- 
versing and dealing with other charac- 
ters is simple and interesting. Second, 
at certain points you enter the fencing 
game, with commands such as Parry, 
Thrust, and Feint that really work. Im- 
pressively, both features are as essential 
to the game as they were to the novel. 

Because these features, along with 
the adherence to the original story, 
show the game's faithfulness to the

novels, Niue Princes i» Amber is a 
worthwhile adventure game. With 
added touches such as graphics screens 
of important scenes, and occasional 
bursts of music, the game captures quite 
nicely Roger Zelnzny's weird and un- 
predictable world. I suspect it will ap-

The Musk System And 
The Advanced, Music System 



From Firebird come The Music System 
and its big brother. The Advanced Music 
System, the latest and perhaps most 
comprehensive single-disk "music pro- 
cessors" for the Commodore 64. In- 
tended for musical hobbyists, both 
packages are thoughtfully designed 
and well -produced, and they sport ex- 
cellent documentation, including many 
helpful diagrams. 

Both systems are substantial and 
complex. You'd need to spend some 
time and effort on both programs, as 
you would with any complete system of 
this scope. Outstanding features in- 
clude extremely clean hi-res graphics 
and Macintosh-style pop-up menus 
and icons. The programs also function 
well with monochrome monitors, and 
joysticks are not required. Icons and 
other graphics insure that anyone with 
minimal musical background may ap- 
proach these systems — another real 
strength, which should also facilitate 
use by those whose primary language is 
not English. The advanced system will 
even insert bar lines or automatically 
correct them for you. 

The systems are operationally 
well -conceived. Four function keys ac- 
cess standard sets of menus throughout 
(Files, Values, Commands, Info). And 
the space bar advances you clockwise 
(or counterclockwise) around the 
screen to access the various devices per- 
tinent to each program or to highlight a 
desired menu selection. Pressing RE- 
TURN enters your choice. The RUN/ 
STOP key always starts/stops se- 
quence play. And the Commodore- 
RUN/STOP key combination initiates 
record mode. 

Below this level, things get more 
complicated. It's difficult to remember 
which key(s) to press for what. Where 
options are most numerous — in The 
Advanced Music System — a most wel- 
come "Quick Key Reference Guide" is 
provided. (An innovative, but more ex- 
pensive solution would be to create a 
custom input device, such as a touch 
tablet. It seems that many special- 
purpose systems would be friendlier 
with similar peripherals.) Lacking such 
a device. The Music System designers 

62 COMPLITEra Oascatta NovemlMr 1986 



might have implemented the more in- 
tuitive back arrow and cursor control 
keys- — the latter remain unused in 
either package. 

The basic Music System package 
consists of two modules — a keyboard/ 
editor and a synthesizer — ^one on either 
side of the disk. Both modules contain 
sequencers. The programs write and ac- 
cess the same music and sound files, and 
the systems are 100 -percent compatible. 
Synthesizer modules in The Music Sys- 
tetn CTMS) and The Advanced Music Sys- 
tem (AMS) are virtually identical. In AMS, 
the keyboard and greatly expanded edi- 
tor are separate, however. Additionally, 
AMS includes linker, printer, and MIDI 
programs — all accessed through a mas- 
ter icon menu. These add-ons expand 
system capability, but the TMS basic sys- 
tem is complete and workable on its 
own. It's also much more approachable 
for the beginner. 

The keyboard modules allow you 
to enter — either in "tinker" or record 
mode — notes and rhythms from the top 
two rows of Commodore 64 keys. This 
arrangement gives immediate access to 
almost two octaves of pitches. Octave 
shifts higher and lower are available — 
as are a number of other options — by 
pressing special key combinations. It is 
these combinations that are difficult to 
remember. One voice only may bo per- 
formed at a time. On playback, you 
may select up to three voices. An ever- 
present visual metronome icon — -with 
variable tempo — keeps you in time, to 
three varying degrees of resolution. In 
AMS. it optionally "clicks" if a voice is 
available to play it. 

You may watch the single voice 
you play through the Voice Monitor 
Window. In TMS, you can also view all 
three voices on playback. This is the 
same window through which you edit: 
add, delete, change bar lines, pitches, 
rhythms, and instruments (which can 
be redefined at any point — an impor- 
tant feature). AMS doesn't use this win- 
dow to edit since it has a separate 
editing module. 

The keyboard/editor module in 
TMS is a most useful hybrid. Of course, 
it's appropriate in AMS — where editing 



tasks become more comprehensive — 
for this process to be handled separate- 
ly. Although your effort must be pains- 
taking, you can optionally enter 
compositions note by note through the 
Voice Monitor Window, one voice at a 
time. Most users will probably choose 
to play "rough draft" tracks on a key- 
board (synchronized aurally to previ- 
ous tracks and visually to the 
metronome) and then polish things 
with the editor. 

Whereas music/ sequence files are 
saved from the keyboard and editor 
modules, it's the synthesizer module 
that creates sound files. Sound files are 
groups of 15 "instruments" (waveform/ 
envelope combinations) and four sets of 
filter parameters. A single filter setting 
is available to all instruments simulta- 
neously; it may be switched in or out 
for each instrument as desired. Al- 
though only one sound file is active at 
any given time, a second is coresident 
in memory and may be manually 
"swapped" on a moment's notice. 

Experienced music hobbyists may 
miss the presence of ring modulation 
(there is no way of getting bona fide 
bell tones), sync, and voice 3 envelope 
and oscillator modulation. Perhaps this 
is why the packaged sound files (two in 
TMS, three in AMS) tend to sound rather 
bland and unexciting. Also, there is no 
way to tune voices to near unisons, for a 
rich, chorus effect. Filter cutoff points 
are preset by the user and cannot 
"track" oscillator pitch. 

However, this just opens the door 
for perhaps the most innovative device 
contained in TMS and AMS — the Dy- 
namic Response Envelope (ORE). The 
DREs are three-stage control-envelope 
contours, available either once per 
event (note) or repetitively. There are 
two of them for each instrument: one 
modulates pitch and/or pulse width; 
the other, filter contour. Each stage is 
expressed in terms of number of steps 
(time), slope of curve (rate), and step 
time (overall speed); they roughly cor- 
respond to envelope segments (and 
programming) on Casio CZ keyboard 
synthesizers. (Slower step times can 
create a limited range of "sampling" ef- 
fects.) As useful as this capability is, it's 
too bad that there are only three stages 
(a simple pulse modulation, like a mod- 
ern police siren, requires four stages), 
and that the contour ceases automati- 
cally at the onset of the note's release 
stage. This should be an option, not 
automatic. 

The advantage of the DRE ap- 
proach to modulation over the tradi- 
tional "voice 3" method is that it allows 
three-voice harmony to continue, and 
that all voices may be modulated simul- 
taneously, even with contrasting 
contours.

Integral 
Solutions 



the synthesizer module Is its ability to 
repeat sequences infinitely while you 
try out different instruments. It's like 
changing instrumentation while the 
piece is playing— a real arranging tool. 
Of course, there is also a key to press for 
a single tone or repeats thereof (you 
may specify pitch and duration). 

In AMS, editing capability is great- 
ly expanded to include the handling of 
triplets (notably missing in IMS), multi- 
ple repeat structures and "loops" (infi- 
nite repeats of specified sections), and 
"macros" to facilitate the editing of 
groups of notes (even complete voices). 
Also included is a "notepad" file which 
can be separately saved to facilitate 
moving material among voices, reposi- 
tioning it or copying it, and so forth. In 
contrast to TMS, the editor transposes in 
notation as well as in sound. 

Don't look to AMS for anything 
fancy in terms of MIDI capability. How- 
ever, the basics are covered, You'll need 
a SIEL or Passport MIDI interface plus a 
MIDI keyboard. With them, you can 
enter data from an external keyboard 
one voice at a time, edit the MIDI music 
files, and then play them back through 
the MIDI keyboard. Unfortunately, for 
editing, files must be converted from 
MIDI type to the normal AMS format. 
Whereas MID] allows up to six tracks, 
AMS files are limited to three voices, 
and they eliminate much important 
musical information (such as pitch 
bend, slides, after touch, modulation). 
Each MIDI track is limited to one voice, 
and only one MIDI keyboard can be 
controlled by the sequencer at a time. 
As a simple sequencer storage device, 
and for keyboard pitch and rhythmic 
input, the MIDI module would seem 
most useful. 1 am unaware of compara- 
ble hobbyist-oriented packages which 
offer this feature. 

The AMS linker module allows you 
to create link files, which are collections 
of individual music files. Longer ar- 
rangements, with complex sectioning, 
are thus possible. 

Finally, the printer module permits 
hi-res dot-matrix printing of one to 
three voices, at the rate of 10 to 15 min- 
utes per page. Commodore and Epson 
(Epson-compatible) printers are sup- 
ported. Although printing details are 
especially clean, the result is only mar- 
ginally useful since each voice is widely 
separated from the others and is printed 
on a double (grand) staff rather than on 
a single line, (Note that, with three 
voices, there is only one system per 
page.) This module also includes a text 
option, where you add text to the lead 
voice. Text is saved as a separate file, 
and several useful spacing options are 
provided. One limitation is that text is 
printed out only (optionally) under the 
top voice. 



Here are my recommendations. If 
you primarily want rich and/or "wild" 
sounds, are looking for a full-featured 
MIDI sequencer/editor, or are a profes- 
sional composer/ arranger, these prod- 
ucts are not for you. But consider The 
Music System seriously if you are an av- 
erage hobbyist seeking a reasonably 
priced, single-disk music package to ex- 
periment with or for making short, sim- 
ple arrangements. If you want an 
introduction to MIDI (wish to use a real 
keyboard) or want to make longer, 
more involved arrangements, take a 
good look at The Advanced Music Sys- 
tem. {A $40 upgrade to The Advanced 
Music System is offered with the basic 
package.) Both are solid, state-of-the- 
art pieces of software.

Superbase 128 

Superbase 128 is a database designed 
specifically to take advantage of the ad- 
vanced features of the 128. As such, it 
offers a lot: full 80-column display, 
automatic booting, and formatting of 
both sides of your data disks (with the 
1571 drive). And to keep everything 
both readable and easy on the eyes, the 
default screen colors are green on black, 
emulating a monochrome monitor. 
Rather suddenly, your computer is dis- 
playing the power you knew was there. 
But now what do you do with it? 

If you haven't yet used a database, 
a few definitions are in order so that 
you'll better understand the features to 
be evaluated. 

The smallest part of a database is 
the field. This is one item of infor- 
mation, such as a name. Multiple fields 
make up a record- — for example, the ad- 
dress, phone number, amount owed, 
and so on. Multiple records comprise a 
file. Ideally, all records in a file will 
have a common denominator, such as 
everyone who ov^es you money, And 
multiple files — everyone you know — 
comprise a database. 

Uses for a database go far beyond 
merely keeping lists of names and ad- 
dresses for your Christmas card list. De- 
pending on how powerful a base is in 
allowing you to manipulate fields, re- 
cords, and files, it may also be useful in 
building an invoicing system; keeping a 
"preferred customer" list complete 
with date and amount of last purchase; 
and cataloging your collection of Barbra 
Streisand albums with information on 
composer and lyricist of each song, as 



well as the writer of the liner notes. 

Fortunately, Superbase 128 has the 
power to do all this and more because it 
is a programmable database. And being 
programmable means that it has a great 
deal of flexibility, not only in creating 
records, but also in accessing infor- 
mation from records once they have 
been stored. 

If, for example, you want your 
Deadbeat file to print out (to screen or 
printer) everyone who owes you more 
than ten dollars, it is easily done. Or, if 
you want to access your invoice files to 
find out how many widgets were sold 
between May and July of 1985, the 
number of multiple sales, the number 
of repeat customers, and the average 
cost and selling price per widget, it can 
be done. 

The key to doing all this is in two 
parts: designing your files at the field 
level, and being able to write a program 
that will tell Superbase which file to re- 
port on and which fields to manipulate. 

For the former, Superbase allows 
for easy creation of records. From the 
first menu screen, you select Edit and 
are then presented with an almost 
blank screen. Type the title for the field, 
such as Lastname; specify the type of 
field (text); then set the length of the 
field according to the maximum amount 
of information you may have to enter 
(up to 255 characters for text, up to nine 
digits for numeric). 

When you get to a Date field, de- 
fine it as such and it will accept no other 
type of information. (If you use the Cal- 
endar designation, entering any date in 
this century will cause Superbase to sup- 
ply the day of the week.) Similarly, a 
Numeric field is designed to accept only 
digits and may include up to four deci- 
mal places. Use this for amount owed in 
your Deadbeat file. 

You can go on with this for quite 
some time: Each record can contain as 
many as 127 fields and comprise as 
many as four pages (screens) of infor- 
mation. Further, Superbase places no 
limits on the number of records that can 
be contained in a file. Think of this as a 
constantly expanding file cabinet; each 
time you add a new folder, the cabinet 
grows to accommodate it. 

If a record is to contain calcula- 
tions, you'll also want to specify a field 
to hold the result of those calculations. 
Once you've finished and saved the 
form of such a record, you'll be prompt- 
ed for a calculation for the Result field. 
In the case of our Deadbeat file, we 
could answer the prompt with: 

[balance] — [amount owed] — (amount 
paid] 

This example illustrates the pro- 
grammable part o( Superbase, and it can 
be as simple as that. Dozens of new.

plain-English commands have been 
added, and you'll be able to use all the 
math operators you've used in your 
other programming endeavors. 

Once a file of records has been cre- 
ated, you'll need to specify the type of 
information you wish to extract. Though 
the menu offers an Output option, this 
prints each record in full {to screen or 
printer) — and this may not always be 
desirable. 

For those times when you may 
want to see only the most pertinent 
parts of a record, there's an easy-to-use 
Report Generator included in Super- 
base. Answer the prompts concerning 
file to work on, calculations, breaks and 
subtotals, and so forth, and the genera- 
tor builds a BASIC program that will 
manipulate the information just as you 
want it to be manipulated. 

To check this out, select Program 
from the menu and you'll see your re- 
port in program form, complete with 
line numbers. As with any BASIC pro- 
gram created on the Commodore, full- 
screen editing allows you to alter or add 
to the program as you wish. 

While the documentation of over 
200 pages does all it can to provide clar- 
ity and detailed instructions, it does fall 
somewhat short as a reference tool. The 
novice, following the stcp-by-step in- 
structions in the three extensive tutori- 
als, will be able to create an address list, 
a simple invoicing file, and a more com- 
plex invoicing file — but only exactly as 
stated in the book. For any kind of re- 
port generation that is not detailed in 
the documentation, you must have 
something more than a nodding ac- 
quaintance with BASIC. 

In storing records, Superbase oper- 
ates on a "key field" basis. Any field in 
a record can be specified as the key, and 
in our Deadbeat file we would probably 
want that field to be LASTNAME. 
Though the explanation is simplified, 
think of it this way: When a record is 
completed and stored, a separate direc- 
tory consisting of only the key fields is 
set up on the disk. To access the record, 
specify the last name. Superbase picks it 
out of the key directory and finds a 
pointer leading to the full record. It is in 
this way that Superbase can retrieve a 
record in 0.3 seconds — and that's fast. 

You may direct that your sort be on 
a field that is not the key field, but re- 
trieval will not be as fast. You may also 
do multiple sorts on as many as 34 
fields: With this feature you could call 
up the records of those who owe you 
money; who live in zip code 63146; 
who have blue eyes; and who part their 
hair on the left side. And that is only 
four fields deep. Complex sorts require 
more time. 

1 also like the manner in which a 
record is entered. When it's complete, 

66 COMPUTEI's GazeHe Novamber 198B 



Storage is to disk rather than to RAM. 
While this process takes a few seconds 
more than simply storing the record in 
memory for later storage on the data 
disk, the time would certainly be worth 
it in the event of a power failure or a 
system lockup: Everything done up to 
the time of the crash would be saved. 

Superbase 1 28 was created by Preci- 
sion Software and is marketed by Pro- 
gressive Peripherals & Software. 
Precision also developed Superscript 
228 for word processing {also marketed 
by Progressive Peripherals), so it's not 
surprising that the two programs are in- 
tegrated. With such an arrangement, 
it's possible to design a database report 
that picks out only the names and ad- 
dresses from a file (and only the ad- 
dresses within a particular zip code if 
you like) and affixes them to form let- 
ters created with Superscript. A nice 
surprise is that Superbase can also work 
in this vvay with Commodore's Eas^- 
Script as well as with other word pro- 
cessors that create sequential files. 

To sum up, Superbase 328 is a pow- 
erful database, one of the most power- 
ful available for Commodore computers.

A Practical Program 



Richard Mansfield 
Senior Editor 



Last month we started using the 
primary tool of machine language 
(ML) programming: an assembler 
to create executable programs. Now 
let's put our assembler to work and 
write a program for the 128 and 64 
which will test RAM memory. 

The program will POKE in ev- 
ery possible number (0-255) that 
can be held in a RAM memory cell, 
and it will then check to see wheth- 
er that number really made it into 
the cell to which it was POKEd. 
Aside from allowing you to spot de- 
fective RAM chips (the roudne will 
report the address of any offend- 
ers), it will allow us to explore some 
fundamentals of ML programming. 
This month we'll set it up to test 
screen RAM so that we can see it 
working (128 users should set the 
screen to 40-column mode). 

Take a look at the "Screen 
Test" program below. When you 
first start to learn ML, the three- 
letter codes which are its com- 
mands seem quite mysterious, 
Actually, there are about as many 
commands in ML as in BASIC and, 
as you would expect, you'll use 
only about 20 of them most of the 
time. However, where BASIC spells 
out command words, ML abbrevi- 
ates. For example, RETURN in 
BASIC is the equivalent of ML's 
RTS (ReTurn from Subroutine) 
command; BASIC'S X = X -|- 1 be- 
comes INX (INcrement X); and 
GOTO becomes JMP (JuMP)- But 
you get used to these abbreviations 
very quickly. 

If you're using the simple as- 
sembler published last month, give 
10000 as the start address of this 
program and then type in the three- 
letter ML commands in the pro- 
gram. Note the different number at 
address 10041 required for the 64, 
If you're using a different assem-

bier, insert a comma between the 
right parenthesis and the Y in lines 
10010 and 10012: ),Y. 

When you're finished, you can 
SYS 10000 to test it. The screen will 
be POKEd with all the possible 
characters — but it will happen too 
fast to see. After each cell has been 
tested, the letter A, the last POKE, 
will remain behind. 



A Feel For The Language 

Let's now go through the program 
step by step to get a feel for how the 
language works. We start off by 
putting a 4 into address 253. Ad- 
dress 253 is going to be a pointer 
into memory. It will always hold 
the page of the address being acted 
upon while we PEEK and POKE 
during the program. Memory can 
be conveniendy divided into 256- 
cell chunks called pages. So, by 



putting a 4 into our pointer, we're 
directing the action to the fourth 
page (4 * 256 is 1024, the start ad- 
dress of the screen RAM cells in the 
64 and 128). 

When you want to POKE a 
number in ML, you must first enter 
that number into a register. The ac- 
cumulator is the most often used 
register. We LDA (LoaD the Accu- 
mulator) with 4 by using the # sign 
before the 4 to show that we mean 
the actual number 4 rather than 
whatever number might be current- 
ly held in address 4. So our first job 
is to set up a pointer, and we load 
the accumulator and store the 4 
(STA 253). Pointers are two-byte 
units, so we then put a zero into 
252, the less important part of our 
pointer. Address 252 points within 
the page defined by 253, So, by 
storing a zero into 252, we're leav- 
ing the pointer at 1024, If we put a 6 
into 252, the pointer will point to 
address 1030, 

When you STA, the register^ 
the accumulator — still holds the 
number you copied to the target ad- 
dress. So, we can take advantage of 
this by transferring the zero still sit- 
ting in the accumulator to the X and 
Y registers by TAX and TAY. We 
could have used LDX #0 and LDY 
#0, and the effect would have been 
the same; we just took a shortcut. 

We're zeroing X and Y because 
we're going to use them as loop 
counters. You don't have FOR- 
NEXT commands in ML, so you set 
up your own counters. Our main 
loop starts with STA (252)Y, which 
causes whatever is in the accumula- 
tor to be stored into the cell pointed 
to fcy the pointer we set up plus the 
value ofY. In this first pass through 
this command, Y is a zero, so a zero 
is stored in address 1024, and we 
then compare what's in the cell to 
what's still in the accumulator 
(CMP). They should be the same 
unless RAM is faulty and can't ac- 
cept the zero we just stored there.

GOTO And NEXT 

If there is a failure, we are sent off to 
an error-reporting subroutine at ad- 
dress 10037 within our program. 
BNE means Branch if Not Equal. It 
causes the program to GOTO its 
target address if the previous action 
(the CMP in this case) was not 
equal. In other words, if the number 
currently in the accumulator is not 
the same number discovered in the 
RAM cell sampled by the CMP, the 
branch takes place. Conversely, if 
the compared numbers are equal, 
the program passes right over the 
branch and ignores it. An ML 
branch, then, is the equivalent of 
IF-THEN-GOTO. 

Now we come to the ML equiv- 
alent of BASIC'S NEXT command. 
DEX reduces the X register by one, 
and BEQ (Branch if Equal to zero) 
tests to see whether the X register 
has reached zero yet. If so, we are 
branched out of this loop and sent 
down to address 10023. However, 
while X is still counting down, we 
don't want to branch, so we transfer 
the value of X {the next number 
we're going to be POKEing into the 
RAM cell currently under test). Then 



we jump back up to the start of our 
POKE-PEEK loop at 10010. 

When, however, X has counted 
down all the way to zero, we move 
ourselves to the next higher RAM 
cell in memory by raising the num- 
ber in the Y register. (Recall that Y is 
being added to the pointer address, 
so by raising Y we access a higher 
RAM address.) 

But Y — like the accumulator, 
the X register, and any single mem- 
ory cell — can hold only numbers 
between and 255. So, eventually, 
Y will go to 255, and then when we 
try to INY, it will reset itself to zero. 
It's at this point that the BNE com- 
mand located at address 10024 fails 
to trigger us back up to the start of 
our main loop, and we fall through 
to the command at address 10026, 
which raises the page number in 
our pointer by one. (INC means in- 
crement.) Then we load the page 
pointer into the accumulator and 
check to see whether it is yet an 8 
(which would mean we've reached 
the bottom of screen RAM). If not, 
we return to loop through the next 
page (we just INCed the page 
pointer, so now we're ready to test 



a new, higher 256-byte-size chunk 
of RAM). 

If, however, we have finished 
with page 8, we jump down to the 
RTS (RETURN) instruction which 
sends us out of ML and back into 
BASIC. 

The commands at 10037-10041 
access a subroutine buUt into the 
computer itself. It's located in ROM 
BASIC and, for BASIC, it prints Hne 
numbers to the screen during LIST. 
However, we can use it to print the 
address of a failed RAM cell if we 
simply load the page and cell point- 
er numbers into the accumulator 
and X register, respectively, before 
JSR Oump to SubRoudne). s

Fill-64 



Hubert Cross 

This exciting graphics utility for the Commodore 64 adds 15 
new comma7ids to BASIC. "Fill~64" allows you to paint any 
solid shape on the hi-res graphics screen at a speed that's fast 
enough for animation. Once an animated sequence is complete, 
you can store the entire animation on disk or tape, to be re- 
played at a future time. No machine language knowledge is 
needed to use this program. 



If you're interested in high-resolu- 
tion graphics on the Commodore 
64, you may have used programs 
that add commands such as PLOT 
and DRAW to BASIC. Most of these 
programs allow you to draw a 
closed shape on the screen with 
lines, then paint it with a command 
called something like FILL. Fill 
commands of this type often suffer 
from two drawbacks: They cannot 
draw over existing dots on the 
screen, and they are much too slow 
for animation. 

"Fill-64" lets you paint a solid 
shape anywhere on the hi-res 
screen, even over existing shapes, 
The program works so fast that it 
can even be used for animation. 
Since it adds new commands to 
BASIC, Fill-64 is easy for anyone to 
use. With simple commands such 
as FILL, CLEAR, RECORD, and 
PLAY, you can draw complete ani- 
mated sequences, store them on 
disk or tape, and redisplay them at 
your convenience. 

Typing It In 

Fill-64 is written in machine lan- 
guage and must be typed in with 
"MLX," the machine language en- 
try program found elsewhere in this 
issue. However, no machine lan- 
guage expertise is required to use 
the program. Read the MLX in- 
structions carefully before you type 
Program I, and be sure to save a 
copy when you're done. Here are 
the addresses required for Fill-64;

Ending addiess: 981F

must enter the following lines in 
immediate mode (with no line 
numbers). Don't forget to press RE- 
TURN at the end of each line, 

POKE 51,25S:POKE 52,63 
POKE 55,255:POKE 56,63 
NEW 

These statements move the top 
of BASIC memory down to a point 
24,577 bytes lower than usual. That 
leaves 14K for BASIC programs, 
more than enough for most applica- 
tions. The reserved 24K area is used 
to store Fill-64 and its data. It's very 
important that you perform this 
step every time you wish to use Fill- 
64; if you don't, the program can't 
work properly. 

Next, load Fill-64 with LOAD 
"PROGRAM", 8,1 for disk or 
LOAD "PROGRAM",!, 1 for tape. 
Replace the name PROGRAM with 
the name you used when saving the 
program with MLX, When the pro- 
gram has loaded, type NEW and 
press RETURN to reset the comput- 
er's BASIC pointers. 

To activate Fill-64, type SYS 
33846 and press RETURN. Fill-64 
makes two hi-res screens available 
at all times. When you first activate 
the program with SYS, it clears 
both screens and displays screen 1 , 
Use the function keys to switch 
from one screen to the other. The f5 
key displays screen 2, To return to 
screen 1, press f3. The f7 key clears 
the current screen, and fl returns 
you to the normal text screen. 

Fill-64 Commands 

Fill-64 adds 15 new graphics com- 
mands to BASIC, Following is a 



summary of what each command 
does. Later sections of this article 
contain programming examples 
and addidonal information about 
these commands. 

FILL number, color, xl,yl,„ 
xmtmber,y number 

The FILL command paints a poly- 
gon of the specified color at the des- 
ignated screen location. The first 
parameter (number) indicates how 
many vertices (corners) the shape 
has. For example, a triangle has 3 
vertices; a square has 4; and so on. 
Use a vertex number of 1 to draw a 
dot; a vertex value of 2 draws a line. 
The second parameter (color) sets 
the shape's color, using the same 
color numbers explained in your 
user's manual. After these values 
you must supply an appropriate 
number of x- (horizontal) and y- 
(vertical) coordinate pairs. To draw 
a triangle, for instance, you need 
three pairs of 3:,i/-coordinates, one 
pair to define each corner. This 
statement draws a triangle; 
FILL 3,2,10,10,50,10,30,30 

Notice that the FILL command 
automatically displays the hi-res 
screen. No special command is 
needed to switch from the text 
screen to hi-res. 

SWITCH 

SWITCH moves from one hi-res 
screen to the other. If you're in 
screen 1, SWITCH flips you to 
screen 2, and vice versa. SWITCH 
ordinarily erases the screen that it 
previously displayed. If you per- 
form SWITCH from the text screen, 
Fill-64 displays screen 1 without 
erasing its contents. 

FLIP 

FLIP works exactly like SWITCH 
but does not erase the previous 
screen, 

CLEAR 

This command erases both hi-res 
screens. It's useful at the beginning 
of a program, 

LOWRES 

The LOWRES statement switches 
to the text screen under program 
control. In immediate mode (when 
you're not running a program) you 
can also do this by pressing the fl 
key. 

SETCOLOR border, background,

Sets the screen border, background, 
and three hi-res colors. The default 
colors for Fill-64 are white, blue, 
black, yellow, and white, respec- 
tively. 

RECORD 

This command records animated 
graphics sequences. It tells Fill-64 
to "memorize" every graphics com- 
mand that follows, until it encoun- 
ters a REWIND or PLAY statement 
(see below). As a reminder, Fin-64 
sets the border color to red when- 
ever RECORD is active. 

PLAY 

Replays an animation previously 
recorded with RECORD or stored 
with DPUT or CPUT (see below). 
When Fill-64 is PLAYing an anima- 
tion, it can be interrupted only by 
pressing RUN/STOP-RESTORE. 

REWIND 

Exits RECORD mode. In effect, this 
command "rewinds" Fill-64's re- 
corder to the beginning, erasing 
any previously recorded animation. 

MEMORY 

Prints the number of bytes avail- 
able for RECORDing animations. 

DPUT "filename" 
Saves an animation to disk. Replace 
filename with any legal Commo- 
dore filename. 

DGET "filename" 
Loads a previously saved anima- 
tion from disk. 

CPUT "filename" 
Saves an animation to tape (the file- 
name is optional). 

CGET "filename" 

Loads an animation from tape (the 

filename is optional). 

Frll-64 Techniques 

Program 2 demonstrates just a few 
of the effects you can achieve with 
Fill-64, from detailed kaleidoscopic 
patterns to three-dimensional ani- 
mation. Program 3 loads and re- 
plays the animations created by 
Program 2, using the full speed of 
FilL64's built-in machine language 
routines. Since these programs use 
Fill-64 BASIC commands, you must 
install Fill-64 as described above 
before you type them in (naturally, 
you must also install Fill-64 when- 
ever you wish to run these pro- 
grams). Once Fin-64 is active, press 
fl to return to the text screen; then 

80 COMPUTEi's Gazelle November 19BS 



enter Programs 2 and 3 as you would 
any BASIC program. 

Program 2 creates several dif- 
ferent animations. For each animat- 
ed sequence, the program switches 
into RECORD mode, then performs 
a series of FILL commands. Then it 
replays the animation with PLAY 
and optionally saves the animation. 
When you run Program 2, it asks 
whether you wish to save the ani- 
mations. Answer yes (enter Y) the 
first time you run the program, and 
be patient- — some of the more com- 
plex shapes take considerable time 
to calculate. Notice how much fast- 
er the animation proceeds when re- 
played with PLAY. When Program 
2 has finished, you can run Pro- 
gram 3 to load and replay all the 
animations in rapid sequence. To- 
gether, these two programs demon- 
strate the complete process of 
drawing, recording, reloading, and 
replaying an animation. 

Fill-64 has two limitations 
when painting. First, you can draw 
any solid polygon with as many as 
18 vertices, but the polygon must 
be convex — that is, its inside angles 
must be equal to, or less than, 90 
degrees. To draw a shape contain- 
ing obtuse angles (angles greater 
than 90 degrees), break it down into 
two or more convex polygons. For 
instance, a star shape can be built 
from two triangles, one placed up- 
side down over the other. 

Second, although you may 
start defining the polygon at any 
vertex, you must proceed in a clock- 
wise direction. The FILL command 
ignores any vertex written in a 
counterclockwise direction. This 
feature is extremely useful for elim- 
inating hidden surfaces in three- 
dimensional objects. 

Let's look at a simple example. 
This command paints a small trian- 
gle in color 2 (yellow): 
FILL 3,2,10,10,50,10,30,50 

The first value (3) indicates the 
number of vertices in the shape, and 
the second (2) indicates the color. 
The remaining values contain the 
coordinates for the triangle. This 
program shows how SWITCH flips 
from one hi-res screen to the other. 



FC 100 FILL 3,2,10,10,50,10,30 

,50 
XD 110 SWITCH 
CX 120 FILL 3,2,11,10,51,10,31 

,50 
HE 130 SWITCH 



The triangle moves one pixel to 
the right. When an animation re- 
quires more than a few frames, 
you'll probably want to use a pro- 
gram loop. This example moves the 
triangle all the way across the 
screen with a FOR-NEXT loop: 

KP 100 FOR X»50 TO 150 

QC 110 FILL 3,2,10+X,10,50+X,1 

0,30+X,50 
AP 120 SWITCH!NEXT:LOWRES 

Notice that the triangle moves 
off the screen without painting any 
unwanted areas. Fill-64 automati- 
cally clips the edge of any shape 
that moves across a screen border, 
it faithfully paints only the visible 
portion of a shape as long as its co- 
ordinates do not exceed the range 
-32768-32767.

These photos illustrate just a few of the 
thousands of hi-res graphics designs you 
can create with "Fill-Si," a sophisticat-

Two new books from COMPUTE! 
bring you innovative ideas to exploit 
the capabilities of your computer to 
the fullest and to make use of it in 
ways you didn't know were possible. 
There's an in-depth look at desktop 
publishing — how to get started and 
how to set up your publication. A 
compendium of special software 
tells you where to purchase in- 
expensive software that will open up 
a new world of applications. The 
information is non-machine-specific 
and is designed for beginning to ad- 
vanced computer users. 



The Complete Desktop Publisher 

Daniel J. Makuta and Willtam F. Lawrence 
A comprehensive reference and guide to what is fast 
becoming one of the most popular uses of comput- 
ers, this book guides the novice through the in- 
tricacies of desktop publishing. Clearly written and 
understandable, this guide covers all the basics of 
typography, layout, and design. Sample formats and 
layout grids make it easy to get started. Details on 
using graphics to enhance publications, discussions of 
the desktop publishing software currently available, 
and comparisons of laser printers, typesetters, and 
other printing devices give you everything you need 
to make intelligent decisions. Chapters outline the 
elements of fitting copy, proofreading, binding and 
folding, and media conversion. You'll also find a 
wealth of information on telecommunications — how 
to transmit your publication for typesetting or print- 
ing — as well as tips on dealing with outside design 
agencies, typographers, and printers. The definitive 
guide.

I Didn't Know You Could Do That 
with a Computer! 
Dan Cutman 

There's more to computers than processing words, 
juggling numbers in a spreadsheet, or filing records in 
a database. A world of unusual, practical, and amaz- 
ing computer programs is available which can help 
you do anything from planting a garden to writing a 
will. These programs range from the simply fascinating 
to the outright esoteric. More than 100 little-known, 
yet intriguing commercial software packages are eval- 
uated and revievt«d: programs which can plot your 
astrological future, show you the night skies, plan 
your next road trip, help you raise your child, and 
give you the edge at the racetrack. Entertaining — cer- 
tainly unique — this book puts an end once and for all 
to the question "Now that I have a computer, what 
do I do with it?"

128 Instant Keywords 



Shawn K. Smith 

Save time and typing effort with this 
short utility for the Commodore 128. 
Up to 52 keywords can be entered, 
each an easy-to-remember, two-key 
combination. 

"Instant Keywords" can drastically 
reduce the time it takes to type in a 
program. This utility prints a BASIC 
7.0 keyword when the Commodore 
or SHIFT key is pressed in conjunc- 
tion with a letter key. For instance, 
pressing the SHIFT and L keys dis- 
plays the keyword LOOP, A total of 
52 keywords can be displayed in 
this fashion. Refer to the chart for a 
list of the key combinations. Also, 
pressing the SHIFT or Commodore 
key while in quote mode displays 
the standard graphics characters 
rather than a BASIC keyword, 

Instant Keywords is short and 
easy to use. Although it contains 
mostly machine language (ML), 
you don't have to know any ML to 
use it. In fact, you can just type it in 
and run it as a BASIC program. 
First, type in the program and then 
save a copy. When you run it, the 
BASIC loader stores the ML in an 
area of RAM which is determined 
by the value 5 in line 100 (changing 
the value of S will relocate the utili- 
ty). Once the data is stored in RAM, 
the utility is activated, the address 
to deactivate/reactivate it is dis- 
played, and the loader is erased 
from memory. Pressing RUN/ 
STOP and RESTORE is another 
way to deactivate the program. 

Modifying The Program 

Readers may wish to rearrange the 
utility to support a different set of 
keywords. This can be accom- 
plished with minor changes to the 
utility. But first, a quick background 
about keywords is in order. BASIC 
7.0 contains 130 plus commands or 
keywords. Most of the keywords 
(including all of the keywords in 
the 64's BASIC 2.0) are represented 
82 COMPUTE'-s Gazette November 1986 



by one-byte tokens. For instance, 
the command PRINT is stored in 
the computer with a token value of 
S99 (153 decimal). Because the 128 
has a larger vocabulary, the design- 
ers of the 128 decided to use two- 
byte tokens to represent some of 
the new commands. All of the new 
two-byte commands use $CE or 
$FE as the first byte of the token. In- 
stant Keywords will allow you to 
use any keyword except those that 
begin with $CE as the first token 
value. (This eliminates the use of 
only eight keywords.) 

The last 52 hexadecimal values 
in the loader (beginning with OB in 
line 200) are the token values of the 
keywords displayed by Instant Key- 
words, The first 26 hex values are 
for the SHIFT key (the token for 
SHIFT- A is the first, and the token 
for SHIFT-Z is the twenty-sixth). 
The last 26 values are for the Com- 
modore key. If you plan to add to- 
kens for any two-byte commands, 
leave off the first byte ($FE)— the 
program knows that it is a two-byte 
command and will adjust itself ac-

Getting your computer 
to do a lot doesn't have to 
cost a lot. Not when you 
have ftrsonal Choice 
Software. It's personal 
productivity software 
that takes on any assign- 
ment.Yet, it's every bit as 
affordable as it is efficient. 
For example, if you 
want to refinance your 
home, Planner's Choice 
turns your home computer 
into a spreadsheet. Simply type in the numbers 
and calculate the effects of different intei^t rates 
by pressing a button. 
You won't have to take' 
out a second mortgage 
for the privilege, either. 
Because Planner's Choice 
is priced to fit any budget plan. 

Ifyou're a writer, the 
value ofWriter's Choice is 
clear from the start. It 
includes featui^

BASIC Examiner 



Rick Kephart 

If you'd like to know how your Commodore 64 stores a BASIC 
program, this utility laill help. It operates with any BASIC 
program and offers a complete analysis of its structure — exactly 
as it's seen by the computer. 



What happens when you turn on 
your computer, type in a BASIC 
program, and run it? The Commo- 
dore 64 instantaneously performs a 
large humber of complex tasks — so 
fast that you probably don't realize 
that your BASIC program under- 
goes a radical transformation after 
you type a line and press RETURN. 
This article and the accompanying 
program demonstrate just what 
happens. 

Your BASIC program, as it's 
stored and run by your computer, 
looks quite different from what you 
mav expect. First, anv BASIC 
keywords (like FOR, NEXT, GOTO, 
and so on) are tokenized. This 
means that any word in BASIC'S 
vocabulary is converted to a single 
number as soon as the line is stored 
in memory, rather than as the word 
you type in or see when you type 
LIST. This reduces the size of the 
program in memory and allows the 
program to run much more quickly. 

The line numbers you type in 
are changed into a two-byte, binary 
form. For example, the number 100 
is converted to and 100 {0 X 256 
+ 100 = 100), and the number 
1000 is stored as 3 and 232 (3 X 
256 + 232 = 1000). 

As each program line is placed 
into memory, a is appended to the 
line to identify the end of that line. 
Three O's are placed at the end of 
the program to indicate the last line. 

84 COMPUTEra Qazane November 19BB 



Also added to the program are 
line links. These are two-byte num- 
bers that point to the memory ad- 
dress where the next line begins. 
Everything in the Commodore 64 is 
stored at a particular memory loca- 
tion between and 65535. Normal- 
ly, a BASIC program is stored in 
memory (RAM — Random Access 
Memory) beginning with address 
2049. The available RAM goes all 
the way up to address 40959. The 
program itself shares this space with 
all of its variables, arrays, and other 
odds and ends it requires as it runs. 

Besides the items just dis- 
cussed — the tokens, the tokenized 
line numbers, and the line links — 
each character that makes up the 
program is stored as an ASCII val- 
ue. For example, if you type in the 
number 3, it's stored as the number 
51— PRINT CHR$(51) will display 
a 3. The letter A is stored as the 
number 65— PRINT CHR${65) will 
display an A. (But remember that 
letters that make up BASIC 
keywords are tokenized and will 
not appear as individual charac- 
ters.) Anything typed within quota- 
tion marks is also stored In its 
ASCII form, even if it is a keyword. 

For Disk And Tape Users 

"BASIC Examiner," the program 
accompanying this article, demon- 
strates what we've discussed. It 
works with any BASIC program. 



To get started, type in the pro- 
gram and save a copy to disk or 
tape. Disk users must also type in 
the following one-line program and 
save it as a separate file, (For ex- 
ample, save the main program as 
"BASIC EXAMINER" and the one- 
line program as "EXAMINER 
LOADER".) 

10 P0KE44,192 iPOKE56,20BiPO 
KE49152,aiL0AD"BASIC EXA 
MINER", 8 

To use BASIC Examiner, load 
and run "EXAMINER LOADER" 
from disk. It will then automatically 
load BASIC Examiner. The loader 
program moves BASIC Examiner to 
another area in memory (address 
49152), out of the way of 'the BASIC 
program which it will analyze 
{stored beginning at address 2049). 
This method allows a BASIC pro- 
gram of any length to be loaded 
into its normal location for viewing 
without disturbing the Examiner. 

If you're using tape, first load 
the program you wish to examine 
just as you normally would, but do 
not run it. Then type the following 
two lines, pressing RETURN after 
each: 

POKE 44,192: POKE 56,208: POKE 

49152,0: NEW 
LOAD "BASIC EXAMINER",! 

When the program prompts 
you for a filename, press RETURN. 

Seeing It Work 

When run, Examiner requests a 
program name. If you're using a 
disk drive, type in the name of any 
BASIC program on the disk in the 
drive. (You may wish to view the 
Examiner itself. If so, type BASIC 
EXAMINER.) The program then

asks for a line number at which to 
begin dissecting the program. Press 
RETURN to start at the beginning 
of the program. You don't have to 
choose a line number in the pro- 
gram. The Examiner will automati- 
cally jump to the next available line 
if the line number you enter is not 
in the program. If the number en- 
tered is higher than the highest line 
number in the program, the Exam- 
iner will start at the last line, indi- 
cate that it has found the end of the 
program, and ask for another line 
number. {Whenever the end of a 
program is reached, you're asked 
for a line number to restart the pro- 
cess.) As noted, pressing RETURN 
starts examining at the beginning of 
the program. 

Every memory location used to 
store the program is displayed, one 
by one, in the following format; 

• The memory location. 

• The number stored in that 
memory location, displayed in both 
hexadecimal and decimal form. If 
the number represents a BASIC 
token or the end of a line, it is 
highlighted. 

• If the number is not a BASIC 
token, the character-string form of 
the ASCII number is displayed. 

• The BASIC token, or any es- 
pecially significant ASCII value 
(one that clears the screen or 
changes a screen color, for ex- 
ample), is printed. Also, if a number 
is part of a line link or line number, 
that information is printed, 



You may slow down the listing 
at any time by pressing the CTRL 
key. the listing may be paused by 
holding down SHIFT or SHIFT- 
LOCK. If you wish to view another 
part of the program, press and hold 
down RUN/ STOP, then type in the 
new line number. 

The top line of the screen re- 
tains the headings regardless of the 
rest of the screen's scrolling or 
clearing. A small machine language 
routine changes the interrupts to 
create the split screen. These inter- 
rupts are necessary for disk opera- 
tions, and therefore the disk drive 
cannot be used ivhile the split- 
screen is in operation. The RUN/ 
STOP key is trapped in order to 
prevent any attempt to use the disk 
drive while the split screen is being 
displayed. Use the RUN/STOP- 
RESTORE combination to break 
out of the program. This, in turn, 
will restore the normal interrupt 
and make disk operations safe. // a 
SYNTAX ERROR should stop the 
program while the headings are dis- 
played across the top of the screen, do 
not attempt any disk operations until 
that line has been removed by press- 
ing RUN /STOP-RESTORE. 

BASIC Examiner is written in 
BASIC, but includes a few machine

Mastering 128 Sound 

And Music 

Part 2 



D, C, Holmes 



Translating a melody from sheet musk is easy with the 128's 
PLAY statement. This rnonth the author describes and illus- 
trates how this can be done with one-, two-, or three-voice 
compositions, and includes a Bach minuet. 



Last month we discussed how the 
128 has streamlined the music- 
programming process with the 
sound and music statements of 
BASIC 7,0. The key to this instant 
virtuosity is the PLAY statement. 
This month we'll see how we can 
translate sheet music into BASIC 
program lines using the PLAY 
statement. 

The format for the PLAY state- 
ment is PLAY "V», Tn, On, U«, Xn, 
elements, notes". The capital letters 
represent characters you type; for 
the lowercase letters, substitute one 
of numbers or characters from the 
list below. Note that if you omit one 
of the control characters, the 128 
uses the default value. 

Vm - Voice {H-1-3, de/ault n- 1) 
Tn "■ Tonal envelope (n"'0-9, default 

On = Octave (n-0-6, default »-4) 
Un = Volume (fi-0-6, default n-9) 
Xn = Filter (« = 1 for on, n ~ for o/f; 

default )i-0) 
Notes; C,D,E,F,G,A,B 

90 COMPUm'3 QezBtte November 1988 



Elements: # — sharp ( |t ) 
$— flat( 1, ) 
W — whole note ( o ) 
H— half note ( J ) 
Q — quarter note ( J ) 
I — eighth note ( J^ ) 
S — sixteenth note ( ^) 
. — dotted note 
R— rest 
M — wait for end of measure 



For example, to play the first 
five notes of a C-major scale with 
voice 2 and volume 6, you would 
use PLAY "V2 U6 CDEFG" or you 
could use a string variable: A$ = 
"V2 U6 CDEFG": PLAY A$ (the 
spaces are optional, but they make 
the string a little more readable). 

The SID chip is capable of pro- 
ducing three independent voices 
(sounds) simultaneously. When the 
control character Vn appears in a 
character string used in a PLAY 
statement, it specifies which one of 
the three voices is to be pro- 
grammed by the characters which 
follow. The characters apply to that 



voice until another Vn control char- 
acter is found in the string. If no 
voice is specified, the default of VI 
(voice #1) is assumed. 

Tonal Envelope 

The tonal quality of each of the 
voices used can be selected from 
one of ten envelopes. One of the 
128's preset envelopes can be used 
(as we discussed last month), or 
you can create your own custom- 
ized tonal envelope using the EN- 
VELOPE and FILTER statements 
(we'll devote next month's install- 
ment to this). The control character 
Th specifies the envelope for the 
voice whose control character most 
recently preceded it. The SID will 
continue to be tuned to this enve- 
lope for this voice until this V« im- 
mediately preceeds another Tn. 

For example, take a look at line 
70 of this month's program, 
"Minuet": 
70 PLAY "VI 77 V2 TO" 

The SID is set to play voice 1 
(VI) in envelope 7 (T7) — a piano 
sound — and voice 2 (V2) in enve- 
lope (TO) — an organlike tone. 

If no envelope is specified for a 
voice, that voice will use the default 
envelope of 0. 



The semantics of the Tn con- 
trol character are somewhat differ- 
ent from the other control 
characters in the PLAY string. 
Whereas Th always refers to only 
the Vji which most recently preced- 
ed it, the other control characters 
(On, Vn, Xn) refer to the notes 
which follow, regardless of which 
voice is programmed to play them. 

Octave 

Notes may be programmed in a six- 
octave range, corresponding rough- 
ly to the middle 72 keys on the 
piano. The control character On in a 
PLAY-statement character string 
dictates the octave range for all 
notes which follow, until another 
On control character is encoun- 
tered. If no octave is specified, the 
default of 04 is assumed. 

Volume 

Dynamic level (volume) may be 
controlled by using the character 
Uh in a PLAY string. The parameter 
tt may range from (no volume) to 
9 (maximum volume), and it ap- 
plies to all notes which follow in all 
voices until another Uh character 
appears. You can't set individual 
volumes for the three voices, al- 
though changing the sustain values 
(with ENVELOPE) can make some 
sounds louder or softer than others. 
If U?i does not appear in a program, 
the default value of U8 is used. Vol- 
ume may also be specified using the 
VOL statement. The format is VOL 
d where rf is a value from (off) to 
15 (maximum volume). 

Notice that the range of vol- 
ume settings, normally 0-15 when 
controlling volume with the VOL 
statement or with POKEs, is com- 
pressed in the Un control character 
to 0-9, Apparently the program- 
mers who wrote the PLAY routine 
didn't want to have to deal with 
two-digit parameter settings (all the 
other PLAY control characters take 
only single-digit parameters), UO 
corresponds to VOL 0, while U9 
corresponds to VOL 15, Other vol- 
ume settings are distributed rough- 
ly evenly between. For example, U4 
corresponds to medium volume 
(the equivalent of VOL 7). The U;i 
control character in a PLAY string 
allows more precise volume control 
than the VOL statement, but there 
are situations when it is more desir- 
able to have volume control outside

Recently, a writer compared 
the revoiutionary 1040ST"' 
to Henry Ford's Model T"" 

You may be surprised to 
leam that we were very 
complimented. 

The truth is that both the 
ST'" and the Model T were 
designed to be machines of 
great power and usefulness 
at a price that was afTordable 
to everybody. 

The only difference is that 
the 16-bit 1040ST uses the 
most advanced technology 
in the wodd. And the result 
b a computer that has 1024 
Kbytes of memory for the 
amazingly affordable price 



of $999. That's actually less 
than $ 1 per Kilobyte. 

We think Henry Ford 
would be very proud.

of a character string, using the VOL 
statement. 

Filter 

The Xn control character allows ad- 
ditional creative control over the 
tonal quality of the 128's sound, XI 
turns on the filter for a given voice 
and XO turns it off. Within a compo- 
sition, you may use the filter on one 
or more voices. The SID chip has 
only one filter, however, and it ap- 
plies to all filtered voices at any one 
time. 

Notes And Elements 

To sound a note, place the letter of 
the note you want to play within 
the PLAY character string. Sharps 
and flats may be played by includ- 
ing the # (sharp) or $ (flat) element 
prior to the letter of the note. Oc- 
taves start at C and end at B, with 
middle C being 04 C, 

The length of time the note is 
to be held is specified by preceding 
it with one of the duration elements 
(W,H,Q,I,S), When a dot (.) pre- 
cedes a duration element, it in- 
creases the duration value of that 
element by half. For example, in

common time (4:4), the elements 
have these values:

A rest can be included in the 
PLAY character string by following 
a duration element with the R ele- 
ment (QR programs a quarter rest, 
SR a sixteenth rest, and so on). 

CQMPuren aazaaa Novsmber 1986 91 



The M element in a PLAY 
character string instructs the com- 
puter to wait for all voices currently 
playing to end the current measure. 

With all of this in mind, we're 
now ready to begin writing music to 
PLAY on the Commodore 128. Let's 
start with the first measure in voice 
1 of Bach's G Major Minuet. The 
first note is a quarter note D in oc- 
tave 5 (05QD). This is follou'ed by 
eighth notes G, A, and B in octave 4 
(04IGIAIB) and eighth note C in 
octave 5 (05IC), To play only the 
first measure of voice 1, type: 
FLAY "VI OS QD 04 IG lA IB 05 IC " 

Synchronizing voice 2 with 
voice 1 is a little trickier, though. 
Voice 2 begins with a half note G in 
octave 3 followed by a quarter note 
A in the same octave (03HGQA). 
We want to program these notes in 
such a way that the half note G be- 
gins at the same moment as the 
quarter note D in voice 1, and the 
quarter note A is synchronized with 
the eighth note B in voice 1. 

In order to understand the co- 
ordination of voices, let's consider 
the logical way the computer reads 
and plays the notes in a PLAY char- 



acter string. When the 128 reads a 
note, it follows these two rules in 
determining when to start playing 
that note: 

1. If the voice specified for this 
note is currently playing another 
note, the new note will begin after 
the old note has been played for the 
full duration specified. If this voice 
is not currently playing, the note 
begins immediately. (Remember that 
the voice is specified by the last V?i 
character to precede a note in a 
PLAY string.) 

2. The computer will not pro- 
ceed to the next note in a string un- 
til the note just read has begun to be 
sounded (regardless of whether the 
notes are specified for the same, or 
different, voices). 

So, we list the notes in the fol- 
lowing order to play both voices in 
sync: 

V203HG VIOSQD 04IG I A IB V203QA 

V105IC 

This measure is programmed 
by the character string A$ in line 90 
of the program "Minuet." I've 
found that the practice of assigning 
a name to a string in one line, and

then PLAYing that string in another 
line, facilitates organization and de- 
bugging of my musical programs. 

The notes of the second mea- 
sure are listed in the same manner 
to synchronize their playing: 
V105QD V203.HB V104IG IR IG IR 

This string is named B$, the 
third measure C$, and so on. 

Note that this melody was 
written in the key of G Major, and 
that there is one sharp (F#) in the 
key signature. The 128 doesn't 
know what key it's playing in, so 
any sharp or flat notes must be pre- 
ceded by a # (sharp) or $ (flat) in the 
PLAY character string. 

One more important note about 
synchronization: Tht Commodore 
128 System Guide offers this advice 
(page 156) on synchronizing notes 
of different durations: "As a rule, 
always start with the note with the 
longer duration." This is a rule with 
which I disagree. If we followed 
this rule, ^ve would come up with 
the following PLAY strings for the 
first six measures of "Minuet": 

A$ = "V203HG VIOSQD 04IG lA 

V203QA V104IB 05IC" 
B$ = "V203.HB VIOSQD 04IG IR IG IR" 
C$ = "V204.HC VIOSQE IC ID IE I#F" 
DS = "V203.HB V105QG 04IG IR IG 

IR" 
E$ = "V203,HA V105QC ID IC 04IB lA" 
F$""V203.HG V104QB OSIC 04IB lA 

IG" 

If you type these in and PLAY 
them, you'll find that the voices 
gradually lose their synchroniza- 
tion. By the end of the fifth measure, 
voice 2 is an eighth note ahead of 
voice 1. The explanation for this is 
fairly simple: There is a very small, 
but definite, period of time required 
for the computer to read and process 
each note. While a whole note 
should play for exactly the same du- 
ration as two half notes, the two half 
notes will take slightly longer to 
play on the 128 than the whole note 
because there are two notes to read 
and process instead of one. Four 
quarter notes, then, take longer to 
play than two half notes; eight 
eighth notes longer yet; and sixteen 
sixteenth notes even longer. 

To overcome this inherent 
problem with the PLAY statement, 
I have my own rule for synchroni- 
zation. To synchronize two or three 
notes to start playing at the same 
time, the notes should be listed in 
the following order in the PLAY 
character string: 



1. List first the note played by 
the voice which is the last to stop 
playing prior to the point of syn- 
chronization. If more than one 
voice is currently playing, this voice 
will be the one which was last 
named in a PLAY character string. 

2, List second the note played 
by the voice which is next to last to 
stop playing prior to the point of 
synchronization. 

You can see how I've followed 
this rule in lines 100-160 in Minuet, 
Strings B$, C$, D$, E$, and F$ all 
begin with voice 1 since voice 1 was 
playing the last note specified in 
each preceding string. 

Once these few concepts are 
understood, the listing of character 
strings for the rest of the piece is 
fairly straightforward. Although 
Minuet uses only two voices, the 
principles of Usting and synchroni- 
zation are the same for musical ar- 
rangements using all three voices. 
Next month, we'll explore the EN- 
VELOPE statement and its parame- 
ters in more detail. We'll see how to 
use this statement for creative con- 
trol of the SlD's tonal quality.

COMPUrers Gazette November 19S6 93 



64 Multitasker 



Richard F. and Sally J. Daley 

Mamj powerful computers — such as the Amiga — have an ad- 
vantage over the Commodore 64: They're capable of multitask- 
ing, running two or more programs at the same time. Here's a 
way to give your 64 the same capability. 



The April 1985 issue of the GAZETTE 
included a program which parti- 
tioned the memory of the Commo- 
dore 64 into three individual 12K 
blocks. "Triple 64" allowed you to 
treat each block of memory as an 
independent computer. Each block 
could contain an independent pro- 
gram with its own variables. Now, 
"64 Multitasker" takes this idea one 
step further and lets you run two 
programs simultaneously. 

Installing The Program 

Since 64 Multitasker is written en- 
tirely in machine language, it must 
be entered using the "MLX" ma- 
chine language entrj' program found 
elsewhere in this issue. Be sure you 
read the instructions for using MLX 
before you begin entering the data 
for Multitasker. When you run MLX, 
you'll be asked for the starting and 
ending addresses for the data you'll 
be entering. The correct values for 
Multitasker are as follows: 

Starting address: COOO 
Ending address: C30F 

When you've finished entering all 
the data, be sure to save a copy 
before leaving MLX. 

To use Multitasker, load the 
program with a statement of the 

94 COMPUTErs Oaistte November 1986 



form LOAD "MULT1TASKER",8,1. 
(Substitute the name you used 
when you saved the program. Tape 
users should substitute ,1,1 for the 
,8,1.) Activate 64 Multitasker by 
typing SYS 49152. After a brief de- 
lay, the computer will respond with 
a READY prompt. Now press the fl 
function key. You won't see any- 
thing happen yet (except possibly a 
blink of the cursor). Now type SYS 
49155 and press RETURN. This 
time the screen will clear and the 
message MULTITASKER EN- 
ABLED will appear on the second 
line of the screen. 

The memory is now configured 
into two separate and independent 
blocks — effectively two comput- 
ers — ready for your use. At this 
point, you're in block 2. To confirm 
this, press i7. This key tells you 
which of the two blocks of memory 
is currently selected. 

Blocks 1 and 2 each have 17917 
bytes of memory available — you 
can check this by typing PRINT 
FRE(O), Now press f3, and you'll in- 
stantly switch to block 1. (This was 
the block you were in before the last 
SYS command.) Pressing f3 switch- 
es you from one block to the other. 

Do uot, utTcier any circum- 
stances, use the RUN/STOP and RE- 



STORE sequence xvhile using 64 
Multitasker. It could cause the com- 
puter to lock up. 

A Simple Test 

If you've followed the procedure 
described above, you're now in 
block 1. If you're in block 2, press f3 
to go back to block 1. If you're not 
sure which block you're in, press f7 
to find out. Once in block 1, type in 
the following program: 

100 FOR 1 = 10 10000 
110 PRINT I 
120 NEXT I 

When you're finished, press f3 
to switch to block 2 and type in this 
program: 

100 FOR 1 = 10000 TO STEP -1 
110 PRINT ,1 

120 NEXT I 

You can see that both pro- 
grams are in memory at once by 
pressing f3 to switch between 
memory blocks and then typing 
LIST in each block. 

Now go to block 1. Type RUN 
and press RETURN. You'll see a 
column of numbers at the left side 
of the screen counting up from 
zero. Watch it for a few seconds; 
then press f3 to get to block 2. Type 
RUN and press RETURN. You'll 
see a column of numbers counting 
down from 10,000. Because of the 
comma in the PRINT statement, the 
column is about one-fourth the way 
across the screen. This lets you easi- 
ly differentiate between the two 



blocks. Watch the programs run for 
a few seconds. 

Press f3. You'll again see the 
program in block 1 running. Al- 
though pressing f3 allows you to 
switch between viewing the two 
programs running, the 64 still ish't 
really multitasking — if you watch 
carefully as you switch between the 
blocks, you can see that each pro- 
gram runs only while you view it. 
However, the more quickly you 
press f3, the closer you come to true 
multitasking. 

Even Closer 

You don't have to keep pressing f3 
to make your 64 a multitasking 
computer. Pressing f5 makes the 
computer quickly swap tasks back 
and forth by itself. You may notice 
that the counting slows down to 
about half its previous speed. Your 
Commodore 64 is now running two 
programs, even though you can see 
only one screen at a time. You can 
check this by pressing f3 to swap 
screens. 

The f5 key starts and stops the 
automatic functioning of the two 
blocks of memory as two indepen- 
dent computers. When you start 
multitasking, the program automat- 
ically switches between the two 
blocks, running both programs si- 
multaneously. This switching oc- 
curs every three system interrupts, 
or 20 times per second. 

The accompanying table is a 
guide for using the function keys. It 
also includes a number which can 
be POKEd into location 725 to sim- 
ulate the pressing of a function key. 
You'll find this useful if you write 
programs to run under 64 Multi- 
tasker. 

Applications 

You may already have some ideas 
for using the 64 Multitasker. If not, 
here are a few suggestions to get 
you started. 

Background processing is an 
exciting possibility. For example, if 
you have a long sort to run, set it up 
and run the sort in one block; then 
swap blocks and do something else 
in the other block. You could write 
or edit a program, play a game, list 
a program to the printer, or look at a 
disk file. 

How about creating a new 
form of game? You and a friend

could design competitive items, 
such as spaceaaft; then, using multi- 
tasking mode and sprites, you 
could let the two programs battle it 
out. The winner could be the pro- 
gram which destroys the creation of 
the other. Many variations on this 
theme are possible. 

There are numerous possibili- 
ties for switching blocks under pro- 
gram control (remember, POKE 
725,X — see the table). This can get 
compUcated, but you could have a 
program in block 1 which would 
call a subroutine from block 2. The 
advantages are that you wouldn't 
have to worry about screen setup, 
variables, line numbers, or any of a 
number of other possible conflicts. 
Each block has its own screen, vari- 
ables, and operating system memo- 
ry from to 1023. 

Limitations 

Unfortunately, 64 Multitasker does 
have some limitations. There are 
several items that are not separate 
for each block of memory. Most sig- 
nificant of these are the color mem- 
ory and the I/O block. Also, if you 
set up a video effect, it affects both 
blocks. This is useful, however, in 
that sprites could be controlled 
from both blocks on one screen — 
an advantage for the two-program- 
game idea discussed above. Other 
items such as high-resolution 
graphics, programmable characters, 
and sound effects are also common 
to both blocks. 

Another problem is the physi- 
cal limitation of having only one 
screen, keyboard, serial port, and so 
on. If a program requires keyboard 
input as it is operating in the back- 
ground, it must wait until you 
switch back into its block. An espe- 
cially cfiessy situation could occur if 
both programs tried to access the 
serial port at once. 

64 Multitasker uses the func- 
tion keys fl, f3, f5, and f7. If you 
wish to run a program that uses one 
or more of these function keys from 



within 64 Multitasker, you may 
have to change that program (f2, f4, 
f6, and f8 may be available). Anoth- 
er conflict arises when you try to 
run a program that uses memory 
beginning at location 49152 
($C000). This is the area where 64 
Multitasker resides. Unfortunately, 
many other programs also are de- 
signed to be used at this location. In 
cases like this, it may be possible to 
relocate the code or data above lo- 
cation 49934, where 64 Multitasker 
ends. 

Also remember that as long as 
two programs are running, each of 
them will run only at about half 
speed. This may affect some games. 

How It Works 

The principle of operation for 64 
Multitasker is to exchange the oper- 
ating system memory in pages 0-3 
(locations 0-1023) during each sys- 
tem interrupt. These pages are 
transferred to a holding buffer. The 
two screens are maintained in dif- 
ferent areas in memory, so they are 
not buffered — the video chip is 
simply set up to look at the user-se- 
lected screen. We chose not to ex- 
change color memory because of 
the need also to exchange color reg- 
isters in the video chip. 

Moving the stack (page 1 of 
memory — locations 256-511) 
causes a few headaches. If you're 
new to machine language, the stack 
is a place designed to hold return 
addresses for subroutines and inter- 
rupts. If the stack or the stack pointer 
has been changed, an RTS instruc- 
tion will not find the correct address 
on the stack. The CPU, unaware of 
the problem, will faithfully try to ex- 
ecute whatever instruction is found 
at the address located at the top of 
the stack. This usually results in a 
computer lock-up. The moral of the 
story is that the computer must copy 
the stack pointer and the stack 
whenever an exchange of system 
memory takes place.

1526 Underliner 



Georg Zimmer 

With this short machine language program, you can now have 
underlined characters on documents printed with the Commo- 
dore 1526 or MPS-SOZ printer. Written for the Commodore 64, 
it's fully compatible with SpeedScript versions 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, 
and 3.2. 



SpeedScript is a powerful word pro- 
cessor, but it doesn't allow you to 
underline words or sentences when 
used with 1526 or MPS-802 print- 
ers. Now, with "1526 Underliner" 
you can do just that. Although Un- 
derliner is designed to work with 
SpeedScript, you can use it with any 
BASIC program or any program 
that doesn't disturb RAM locations 
52809 to 53247. 

Using Underliner 
With SpeedScript 

First, you must modify SpeedScript 
so that it won't overwrite Under- 
liner. To make a new copy with the 
underlining feature, load Speed- 
Script. If you're using SpeedScript 
3.x, then type the following com- 
mands in direct mode: 
POKE 2481,205 
SAVE'XIL.SPEED",8 

If you're using SpeedScript 2.0, use 
these commands instead: 

POKE 2370,164 
POKE 2985,204 
POKE 6547,204 
SAVE"UL.SPEED",8 

Now type in Underliner and save a 
copy on the same disk as your modi- 
fied copy of SpeedScript (UL. SPEED). 
The next time you're ready to use 
SpeedScript with this feature, load 
and run Underliner instead. It will 
automatically load SpeedScript for 
you. Here's how to put Underliner 
into operation. A feature of Speed- 
Script known as printkeys — de- 
signed to let you use all of your 
printer's features — allows you to 
easily underline characters, words, 
or phrases. We'll use two of these 
printkeys. SpeedScript 2.0 allows 
only the numbers 1 — 8 to be used 

96 COMPUTEI's GazBtto Novembor 1986 



as printkeys, but SpeedScript 3.x al- 
lows any character. First, we'll de- 
fine a new underline character. To 
do this, go to the top of your docu- 
ment, press CTRL-£, and then press 
the key you wish to use for under- 
lining {I use the minus key (— ) for 
SpeedScript 3.x. Use 1 with Speed- 
Script 2.0). Then type " = 255". 
Now define a reset character with a 
value of zero. To do this, press 
CTRL-E again. Then press the key 
you wish to use (I use the key for 
SpeedScript 3.x. Use 2 with Speed- 
Script 2.0) and type " = 0". Speed- 
Script 3.x users should end up with 
something that looks like this: 

Text goes here. 4- 
Te X -t . . . HTh Is u 
Tex-t . . ,4- 
»- 

If you're using SpeedScript 2.0, 
you should see I's instead of minus 
signs, and 2's instead of O's. 

To toggle underlining, press 
CTRL-£, and then the minus key (1 
with SpeedScript 2.0). This is the 
same procedure normally used by 
SpeedScript to underline with non- 
Commodore printers. When you've 
finished typing, put the reset char- 
acter at the bottom of your docu- 
ment. To do this, go to the end of 
your file with CTRL-Z. Then press 
CTRL-£, and then {2 with Speed- 
Script 2.0). The reset character 
should now be the last character in 
your document. 

It's always a good idea to print 
the document to screen before print- 
ing it on paper just to make sure ev- 
erj'thing is how you want it. Do this 
by pressing CTRL-SHIFT-P and se- 
lecting SCREEN at the prompt. If 



everything looks correct, then print 
your document with CTRL-P. 

If you exit SpeedScript, Under- 
liner is, of course, turned off. To re- 
activate it and reenter SpeedScript, 
type: 

SYS 52809 
RUN 

Underliner also works with 
BASIC. Load Underliner and 
change line 12:0 to SYS 52809 (de- 
lete everything after the SYS in the 
existing program). Run the pro- 
gram. Now use CHRS(255) — the pi 
sign — -as the underline toggle. This 
can be done either in direct mode or 
within a program. To reset, print 
CHR${0), or SYS 52809. 

A Look Inside 

Underliner is a small machine lan- 
guage subroutine that "patches" 



ill be underlined! 



into the operating system (OS) of 
the 64. Whenever the OS wants to 
print a character, this subroutine 
takes control. It stores the charac- 
ters it receives into a 255-byte buff- 
er, then returns control to the OS, 
which sends the characters to the 
printer. When the OS tries to print a 
carriage return and linefeed, Un- 
derliner sends the carriage return 
only. It then scans the buffer for 
bytes of 255, which act as toggles 
for the underlining. If the underline 
toggle is on, it prints CHR$(164)— 
the underline character. If the tog- 
gle is off, it prints a space. Then it 
prints a linefeed, resets the buffer 
pointer, and returns control to the 
OS. Underliner repeats this process 
until the entire document has been 
printed.

POLAR 
AXIS 




POLE 



This program uses your input to create some fascinating im- 
ages on the high-resolittiou screen. Included are versions for 
the Commodore 64, 128, Plus/4, and 16. 



As a matter of introduction, polar 
art is not wliat happens when you 
give a polar bear finger paints. It is, 
instead, a result of the beauty and 
elegance of mathematical equations 
of the form R = f(A), in which the 
points of a curve are described by a 
distance R (radius) from an origin or 
pole, and by an angle A (see figure 
above}. This is different from the 
more familiar x,i/ method of graph- 
ing in the Cartesian coordinate sys- 
tem (named for Rene Descartes). 

The advantage of polar graph- 
ing is that certain types of curves 
(such as circles, ellipses, and heart- 
shaped figures known as cardioids) 
are more easily described by using 
polar rather than Cartesian equa- 
tions. The program that accompa- 
nies this article uses two different 
forms of polar equations and allows 
you to manipulate the constants. It 
then computes the coordinates of a 
number of points on the resulting 
curve and plots them on the hi-res 
screen. The result is polar art. 

After typing in the program 
(Program 1 for the 64, Program 2 
for the 128, Plus/4, and 16), save a 
copy. To use it, load it and type 
RUN. You're first asked to choose 
between two different drawing 
modes. Art I or Art II. Select one of 

98 COMPUTErs Gazette November 1986 



these; then, when you're prompted 
for input, simply type in the re- 
quired three or four constants 
{three for Art I, four for Art II). Sep- 
arate these values by commas; then 
press RETURN. For starters, try the 
values shown below; then substi- 
tute some of your own. As written, 
the program will not allow invalid 
entries, so feel free to try fractions 
(like 0.1 or 1.5), negative numbers, 
and very large numbers (like 20,000),

The Math Behind The Art 

In Art i, the equation is R = R1 + 
R2*SIN(N*A), where you choose 
the constants N, Rl, and R2, In 
most cases, this equation generates 
circular curves and patterns. 

In Art II, the equation is R = R1 
'SIN(N1'A) + R2*SIN(N2*A), 
where you set the constants Nl, 
N2, Rl, and R2. This equation can 
produce some very exotic curves. 




This three-petal flower is typical of 
the attractive patterns produced 
with Art l. (Values used for this 
pattern are W = 3, Rl = 5a R2 = 60.) 




Art II's formula created this 
complex shell-like picture. (Values 
used for this pattern are Nl =S, 
N2 = l, Rl^SO, R2^60.) 

Note that the greater the val- 
ues for the constants, the longer it 
takes to plot the resulting curve.

Draw 1 28 



Mike Cortese 

This short, easij-to-use 128 drawing program lets you sketch, 
draw circles, ovals, squares, and rectangles in any of 16 colors — 
and add text to your artzvork. Also included is the abiiity to 
save and load your work. A joystick is required. 



This program demonstrates how a 
compact program can be very use- 
ful with BASIC 7.0's powerful com- 
mands. "Draw 128" lets you create 
your own masterpieces with a few 
commands. The premise for the 
program is simple; With a joystick, 
you draw freely anywhere on the 
screen. By pressing any of the as- 
signed keys (see below), you can 
create circles, ovals, rectangles, and 
boxes, and fill designated areas 
with color. You can choose to draw 
in any of the 128's available 16 col- 
ors. Also included is a command 
that lets you add text to your graph- 
ics screen. Additional commands 
allow you to save and load draw- 
ings for future use. Finished prod- 
ucts can be used as title screens or 
pictures in your own BASIC pro- 
grams. If you're not yet familiar 
with BASIC 7.0, you can study the 
program listing and see how to use 
some of these powerful commands. 

An Empty Canvas 

To get started, type in the program 
and save a copy to disk. lload the 
program, then plug a joystick into 
port 2 and run Draw 128. The cross- 
hairs symbol appears at the center 
of an otherwise blank screen, and 
indicates the cursor position. You 
can toggle the cursor on and off by 
pressing the X key. Moving the joy- 
stick in any of the eight directions 
will result in moving the cursor and 
drawing a line if drawing mode is 



on (which it is when the program is 
first run). You can turn drawing 
mode on and off by pressing the D 
key. When the program is first run, 
it's in Fast mode — the cursor moves 
at a reasonable speed. If you want 
to draw in detail, you'll probably 
want to slow down the cursor 
speed. You can toggle fast mode on 
and off by pressing the F key. Also, 
when the program is first run, it's in 
Width 1 mode, which draws thin 
vertical lines. You can change these 
to double width (vertical lines only) 
by pressing W. Pressing W again 
turns off the double-width line.

»tHt» (jn»H)< 



This drazvmg program features hi- 
res graphics, text, and color. 



You can change the drawing 
color by pressing the C key until the 
color you want is displayed. The 
border color changes to indicate the 
drawing color. All drawing is done 
in the color selected, including 




drawing ovals and rectangles and 
painting. Note that if you draw 
with more than two colors in the al- 
lotted 8 X 8-pixel area, the color 
breaks will appear blocky (like 
stairsteps in many cases) and won't 
look as you intended. This is due to 
the color limitations in graphic 
mode 1, which is used to allow for 
the most detail. 

Rectangles, Squares, Ovals, 

and Circles 

To draw a rectangle or square, 
move the cursor (which can be on 
or off — see above) to one of the four 
corners and press B. Then move the 
cursor to where you want the oppo- 
site corner and press B again. The 
rectangle or square will then be 
drawn in the current drawing color. 
To draw a circle, move the cur- 
sor to the center of the area in 
which you want the circle drawn 
and press O. Then move the cursor 
left or right of the center (on exactly 
the same horizontal line) to the de- 
sired radius and press twice. To 
draw an oval, move the cursor to 
the center of the oval to be drawn, 
press O, then move the cursor up or 
down (actually, any direction ex- 
cept due east or west) relative to the 
center and press O twice. Note that 
when drawing an oval, the second 
cursor position marks the maxi- 
mum length and width of the oval, 
but does not lie on its outer boundary. 
It is suggested that you experiment 
with this feature before using it in 
any serious endeavor. The oval will 
be drawn in the current drawing 
color. This command can be used to 
make curves by having part of the 
oval drawn off the visible screen.

Fills And Text 

To paint — or fill — an object, move 
the cursor in the area to be painted 
and press P. If the object is not com- 
pletely closed, the color will leak 
out .into the rest of the screen. To 
paint an area, it's best to draw with 
the double-width feature. There's 
less chance of color leaking. 

To add text to your graphics 
screen, first select a color and then 
move the cursor to the position 
where you want the first letter to ap- 
pear. Press T and the screen will 
clear. Then respond to the TEXT: 
prompt by typing vour message. 
Press RETURN after typing the 
message, and the graphics screen 
will reappear with your text in place. 

Pressing the E key erases the 
entire screen, moves the cursor to 
the middle of the screen, and sets 
the drawing color to black. The 
back arrow {-) key — in the upper 
left comer of the keyboard — places 
the cursor back in the center of the 
screen. After a screen is erased, it 
cannot be retrieved unless it was 
saved to disk. 

The following keys move the 
cursor quickly to another part of the 
screen:

To save the graphics screen to 
disk, press S and type the filename. 
(Be sure the filename is unique, not 
one that already exists on your

then displayed again. 

To load a previously saved 
screen, press L and type the file- 
name. It Vk'ill automatically be load- 
ed and the screen will be displayed. 
Then you can modify the screen 
and resave it if you wish. To view

Turbo Format 



Ross Ouwinga 



If i/ou're interested in saving time, and wear and tear, on your 
1543 disk drive, you'll put this program high on your list of 
utilities. It formats a disk in only 9-1/2 seconds — a super 
speed-up from the usual minute and 20 seconds—and it elimi- 
nates head knocking. Also, it's easy to use — just answer a few 
prompts, and you're seconds away from a formatted disk. 



"Turbo Format" is a fast, easy-to- 
use disk formatting program. It for- 
mats a disk in only 9-1/2 
seconds — the standard 1541 format 
program requires one minute and 
20 seconds. That's a speed increase 
of over eight times. It's easy to use 
because you don't have to remem- 
ber the cryptic command line re- 
quired by the 1541 to format a disk. 
And you're prompted through each 
step of the procedure so there's no 
need to memorize anything. 

Typing It In 

The program is written entirely in 
machine language. "MLX," the ma- 
chine language entry program 
found elsewhere in this issue, is re- 
quired to type it in. After loading 
and running MLX, answer the 
prompts for starting and ending ad- 
dresses with the following: 

Starting address: OSOI 
Ending address: 0EC8 



Type in Turbo Format and save 
it to disk. To run it, type LOAD 
"fUename",8 and RUN. There will 
be a short delay (while most of the 
program is transferred to the mem- 
ory in the disk drive), and a title 
screen with the first prompt will be 
displayed. 

Three Easy Steps 

You're first prompted to enter the 
disk name (up to 16 characters). 
Virtually any character may be used 
in the name, but some may cause 
undesirable side effects, so caution 
is recommended whenever charac- 
ters other than letters or numbers 
are used. 

The second prompt is for the 
disk ID. This is the number used by 
the disk drive primarily to deter- 
mine when a disk has been 
changed. Normally this number is 
two characters long, but Turbo For- 
mat will allow up to five characters. 



More than five characters may be 
typed in, but only the first five will 
be used. Only the first two charac- 
ters will actually be used by the 
disk drive to identify the disk after 
it has been formatted, but all five 
will appear in the BAM (Block Allo- 
cation Map), 

Next, you'll be instructed to in- 
sert the disk to be formatted. Be sit re 
that you do not leave your disk with 
Turbo Format ttt the disk drive. For- 
matting the disk will erase every- 
thing. A recommended safeguard is 
to put a write-protect tab on your 
disk immediately after you have a 
working copy. Turbo Format does 
check the write-protect tab, and if 
one is present, the disk will not be 
formatted. Also, an error message 
will appear to notify you that the 
disk is write protected. 

Along with the prompt to in- 
sert a disk is an abort option. Press 
the fl key to abort. This causes the 
program to start again at the begin- 
ning, prompting you to re-enter the 
disk name. This option allows you 
to change your mind and enter a 
new disk name or ID or correct any 
spelling errors before formatting 
the disk. 

Two Kinds Of Formatting 

The formatting process does not ac- 
tually begin until you press the 
space bar or RETURN. Note, how- 
ever, that the space bar and RE- 
TURN do not perform the same 
function. If you press the space bar, 
the disk will be formatted and all 
data written to the disk will be 
checked for errors. If an error oc- 
curs, the formatting will stop and 
the type of error will be displayed 
on the screen. If you press RE- 
TURN, the disk will be formatted as 
quickly as possible without check- 
ing for errors. 

The reason for offering the two 
options is to allow you to use the 
program in a manner which most 
closely suits your needs. If the disks 
are verified, the procedure takes 17 
seconds rather than 9-1/2 seconds. 
Verifying provides more assurance 
that the disk is formatted correctly. 
The additional 7 or 8 seconds may 
not make much difference to you. 
On the other hand, if speed is im- 
portant, you may choose not to ver- 
ify your disks. Errors occur very 
rarely and most are self-correcting, 
provided the disk itself is not dam- 



aged. Also, if you have a disk which 
you know is faulty, but wish to for- 
mat anyway, you must use the no- 
verify option. 1 strongly recommend 
using the verify feature if you're 
formatting the back side of a disk 
certified only for single-side use, or 
if the disk is well used, or if you use 
an inexpensive, off-brand disk. 

No Knock 

After pressing the space bar or RE- 
TURN to format, the process be- 
gins. A feature that will be noticed 
immediately is that there is no loud 
knocking noise at the beginning of 
the format routine. A single short 
click is heard instead to indicate 
that the routine is working correct- 
ly. This feature is possible since 
Turbo Format is loaded from a disk 
at the start and the exact location of 
the read/write head is saved in 
memory in the disk drive. The pro- 
gram is then able to calculate the 
exact position of the first track with- 
out the excessive knock. The stan- 
dard format routine does not 
necessarily know the position of 
the read/write head; it therefore as- 
sumes the worst-case condition and 
tries to step the head down 45 
tracks. If the head reaches track one 
before it has stepped 45 times 
(which is usually the case), it bangs 
the head against the stop until the 
count of 45 is complete. It works, 
but it makes an awful racket and, in 
some cases, eventually works the 
disk drive out of alignment. 

When the format process is 
complete, a message is displayed 
and will indicate OK if there were 
no errors. At this point you have 
the option of formatting another 
disk or quitting. It's important that 
you press f 1 to quit. Do not reset the 
computer by turning it off and back 
on. The reason for this is that the 
format routine leaves the read/ 
write head on track 35 when it fin- 
ishes. By using fl to quit, the disk 
drive is sent an initialize command 
and also a reset command to set ev- 
erything back in order. If you acci- 
dentally turn the computer off, you 
should initialize the disk drive 
using the lO: command. Failure to 
do so could cause erratic operation. 
If "you accidentally restarted when 
you intended to quit, it will be nec- 
essary to press RETURN for the en- 
ter name and ID prompts and press 
the space bar with no disk in the 



disk drive. An error will be detected 
immediately and you will again be 
given the prompt to quit by press- 
ing fl. 

Using Turbo Format does not 
mean your disks will become less 
reliable. It's much faster because it 
eliminates several very unneces- 
sary and time-consuming routines. 
Most of the time used to format a 
disk is spent by a routine whose 
only function is to space the sectors 
evenly around the disk. Turbo For- 
mat sets this space the same for ev- 
ery sector on every track, but skips 
a time-consuming calculation pro- 
cess used in the standard format- 
ting process. It's amazing how 
much dme is saved by this one 
modification. To a lesser extent, 
time is saved by reducing delays 
when stepping between tracks and 
by eliminating unnecessary data- 
conversion routines. A technical 
discussion of this is beyond the 
scope of this article, but it should be 
noted that only those procedures 
that do not affect reliability were 
changed. Disks formatted with Tur- 
bo Format work just as well as 
those formatted the standard way. 

Intermediate or advanced ma- 
chine language programmers might 
be interested to know that the data 
recorded to the BAM of the disk is 
at locations $0BO0 (2816) through 
$OBFF (3071). If you have a thor- 
ough understanding of the BAM 
and its contents, you can modify 
this area of the program to custom- 
ize or personalize the BAM on your 
disks. Be aware, however, that 
modifying the BAM may have un- 
desirable side effects and is not rec- 
ommended for the beginner or 
someone who knows no more than 
the basics of disk drive operation. 

For those of you with disk 
drives other than the 1541, Turbo 
Format will likely work if the drive 
claims to be 100-percent compati- 
ble. Most of the program is trans- 
ferred to and operates in the disk 
drive and calls on several routines 
which are part of the standard pro- 
gram in the drive. If these routines 
are not at the same addresses as in 
the 1541, the program will not op- 
erate correcdy. No damage wi!i oc- 
cur to your disk drive if this should 
happen, but it may be necessary to 
turn it off and on again to regain 
control.

Each month, comfutei's gazette 
tackles some questions commonly 
asked by Commodore users. If you 
have a question you'd like to see 
answered here, send it to this 
column, c/o computei's gazette, 
P.O. Box 5406, Greensboro, NC 
27403. 

K^m With the VIC-20, you have 
approximately 3K of free BASIC 
memory. With the Commodore 
64, you have 38K of free BASIC 
memory. What crazy arrange- 
ment kept the VIC-20 from hav- 
ing a lot of memory like the 64? 
As a result of this, shouldn't the 
VIC have some other special fea- 
ture that the 64 doesn't have? 

/*• The "crazy arrangement" 
which limited the VIC-20 to 3K of 
BASIC memory was simply the 
state of computer technology in 
1981, the year the VIC was intro- 
duced. You may not realize how 
dramatically computer technology 
has advanced and prices have 
dropped in the past five years. 

Commodore's goal in 1981 
was to bring out the first home 
computer with color graphics and 
sound for less than $300. At that 
time, the only other personal com- 
puters with color graphics were the 
Apple II (about SI, 200 for 16K), the 
Atari 800 ($1,080 for 16K), the Atari 
400 ($630 for 8K), the TRS-80 Color 
Computer (about $600 for 8K), and 
the Texas Instruments TI-99/4 
(about $1,200 with 16K and color 
TV/monitor). None of those prices 
included a disk drive, tape drive, 
printer, or software. Floppy disk 
drives typically cost $500 to $800 
during that period, and a dot- 
matrix printer with no special fea- 
tures cost $500 to $1,000. A 300- 
baud modem was around $300, not 
including interface. A 16K memory 
expansion board for the Atari 800 
retailed for $200. 

The VIC-20, introduced at 

102 COMPUTEI'S Gajietle Novembef 1986 



$299, was a price breakthrough. It 
had 5K of RAM (3K free for BASIC), 
16 colors, three-channel sound, 
built-in BASIC language, and a 
typewriter-style keyboard. It 
hooked up to a TV set and didn't re- 
quire a special monitor, and for 
about $75 you could add a cassette 
recorder for loading and saving 
programs. The VIC was the open- 
ing shot in Commodore's home 
computer price war, and it played a 
major role in forcing down the 
prices of competitors. 

This was before 64K RAM 
memory chips were affordable 
enough to be used in home comput- 
ers. Instead, 16K RAM chips were 
the norm. A 16K RAM chip contains 
16,384 bits of memory, so it actually 
takes eight of these chips to yield 16 
kilobytes, which we commonly refer 
to as'l6K. Even the IBM PC, intro- 
duced soon after the VIC-20, origi- 
nally came with only 16K RAM. The 
VIC-20, at $299 for 5K, offered an 
attractive price/memory ratio of less 
than $60 per kilobyte. An 8K memo- 
ry' expander sold for about $80, or 
$10 per kilobyte. 

By the summer of 1982, whole- 
sale prices of the new 64K RAM 
chips had declined to the point 
where they became affordable for 
home computers. (Again, it takes 
eight 64K RAM chips to yield 64 
kilobytes of memory.) For technical 
reasons, however, it was not practi- 
cal to redesign the VIC-20 to accept 
the new chips. So Commodore in- 
troduced an entirely new com- 
puter — the Commodore 64. At its 
original retail price of $599, the 64 
was another breakthrough. It of- 
fered a price/memor}^ ratio of less 
than $10 per kilobyte. If the Com- 
modore 64 had been constructed 
with the older 16K RAM chips, it 
would have taken 32 memory chips 
to yield 64 kilobytes. Not only 
would the cost have been prohibi- 
tive, but the computer would have 
been much larger and may have re- 



quired a cooling fan. 

After the 64 was introduced, 
the home computer price war really 
heated up and prices plunged. To- 
day you can buy a Commodore 64 
for less than $150, or a Commodore 
128 with 128K of RAM for under 
$300 (less than $2.35 per kilobyte). 
Thanks to the new 256K RAM 
chips, which are replacing the 64K 
chips, prices are still dropping. The 
current price/memory champion is 
the Atari 1040ST, which comes with 
one megabyte of memory (I024K) 
for $999, including disk drive and 
monitor — less than $1 per kilobyte. 

On the horizon are one-megabit 
RAM chips. It takes only eight of 
these to yield one megabyte, and 
they should be commonplace with- 
in two years. 

V^* Is it possible to hook up 
both a TV and a monitor to a 
Commodore 64 at the same time? 
If so, can you show something 
different on each screen at the 
same time? 

/\» Yes and no. You can connect 
both a TV and a monitor simulta- 
neously, but you can't show two 
different screens simultaneously. 
Both screens will show exactly the 
same thing. 

To connect two screens to a 64, 
just plug a monitor into the com- 
posite output jack and a TV into the 
RF output jack. This capability 
comes in handy during group pre- 
sentations, such as user group 
meetings and in classrooms. You 
could also hook up a monochrome 
monitor to the composite jack for 
text displays, and a TV to the RF 
jack for color graphics. 

By the way, the Commodore 
128 can also display two screens si- 
multaneously — a 40-column dis- 
play connected to the standard 
monitor or RF modulator (TV) out- 
put, and an 80-column display con- 
nected to the RGB output. Q

Something Fun For Teachers 




Fred D'Ignazio 
Associate Editor 

For the last several months I've 
been conducting workshops to in- 
troduce teachers to computers, vid- 
eo, electronic keyboards, and other 
high-tech tools. 

The workshops have been an 
exhilarating, eye-opening expe- 
rience — for me as well as for the 
teachers. I've discovered that teach- 
ers are extremely interested in be- 
coming competent with high-tech 
products, and they are enthused 
about introducing these products 
into the classroom. Over the last 
several months 1 have created a nu- 
cleus of highly motivated teachers 
who have returned to their schools 
and have started to build multime- 
dia classrooms. The amount of en- 
ergy and creativity these work- 
shops have unleashed has been 
truly amazing. 

At first, however, I made lots 
of mistakes. 1 kept experimenting 
and trying to do better. Gradually 
an approach emerged that has 
proven to be very successful. In the 
hope that hearing about this ap- 
proach will benefit other workshop 
leaders, teacher trainers, and school 
administrators, I'd like to share 
some of the key elements with you. 

Honesty 

I've learned that the most effective 
way to reach teachers is to be abso- 
lutely honest. In this context, it 
means that I don't represent myself 
as a technology expert. Instead, I 
admit that I make mistakes and 
sometimes get confused about new 
machiner\' myself. 

When I make mistakes in front 
of the teachers, I don't try to cover 
them up; instead I go out of my way 
to dramatize them and make them 
humorous. I leave lens caps on cam- 
eras, plug cables in the wrong way, 
and crash disks with great poise and 
aplomb. I've learned to look forward 



to making mistakes, since they 
usually turn into the funniest mo- 
ments of each day's workshop. 

Teachers Come First 

I make the point early in each 
workshop that the equipment is not 
for kids; it's for the teachers. Teach- 
ers usually hear how computers 
and other high-tech materials are 
for kids, so no wonder they have 
little interest in the equipment and 
have little incentive to learn more 
about it themselves. If teachers see 
themselves as technicians or "facili- 
tators" who deliver computer-based 
learning to students, they can't help 
feeling devalued and threatened. 

Instead I stress that teachers 
come first and are central to the the 
personal development and growth 
of each student. In our workshops 
we look at things that computers 
can do that spark the interest of 
teachers and get them personally 
involved. I start every workshop by 
having all the teachers write me 
"Dear Fred" letters that tell me why 
they are really there and what they 
hope to get out of the workshop. I 
read their letters and let each teach- 
er know 1 don't care about schools, 
principals, parents, or kids. All I 
care about is the teacher and his or 
her need to have a personally 
meaningful experience with me. 

Quick Tech 

I begin each workshop by picking 
up a huge stack of manuals. I tell 
the teachers that these are the man- 
uals for the equipment that they see 
around them in the room. Then the 
manuals go into the wastebasket 
and the teachers are promised that 
they'll learn how to use all the 
equipment in two days without 
readiug about thern. There's usually 
applause at this point. 

The message within all this 
melodrama is that manuals can be 
an extremely inefficient way for be- 



ginners to learn something new. I 
get the teachers to pressing buttons 
and pulling switches with great 
glee and playfulness, and suddenly 
the need for manuals goes away. 
Manuals come later when you have 
the self-confidence and the curios- 
ity to learn how to do something 
specialized and can't figure it out on 
your own. 

Fun 

In the workshops, there are high- 
tech workstations all over — com- 
puters, video cameras, electronic 
synthesizers and digital samplers, 
amplifiers, TV monitors, VCRs, cas- 
sette recorders, and special -effects 
generators. But we avoid the word 
uwrkstatioti in favor of sandbox. 
Each high-tech work area is a sand- 
box, and it's to be treated as such. 
You ge there to play, be silly, be 
creative and imaginative, and have 
fun. You go there to lose your sense 
of time, and become oblivious to all 
the hubbub and confusion going on 
around you. 

The approach works. I've had 
teachers take off their shoes and 
play synthesizers with their stock- 
inged feet. Without embarrassment 
teachers climb onto tables and aim 
their video cameras at their class- 
mates. They shoot irreverent close- 
ups of my ears, knees, and beard. 
They write haunted house stories 
on the computer and set them to 
music. They use Print Shop and cre- 
ate banners, personalized posters 
with their names and the graphics 
icon that they most identify with, 
and certificates that say, "Graduate 
of Fred's Multimedia Sandbox." A 
recent workshop ended with one 
teacher videotaping the rest of us 
holding up a banner that read, "All 
It Takes Is All You've Got!" Some 
of the teachers blew and popped 
bubbles. All of us danced together 
to Beethoven's Third Symphony. 
Who said learning about high-tech 
couldn't be fun? O

Elegant Programming 



Todd Heimarck 
Assistant Editor 

Programmers sometimes describe a 
subroutine or technique as being el- 
egant. What is elegance? We might 
say that a short, simple, and fast 
program is more elegant than one 
that's long, complicated, and slow 
(although this isn't always true). It's 
almost an aesthetic judgment; a 
program that looks better and runs 
better is elegant. 

Let's examine two techniques 
that are sometimes used in BASIC 
programs. In both cases, there's a 
better (more elegant) alternative. 

A Page Of IF-THENs 

You'll occasionally see a program 
with several lines that look some- 
thing like this: 

60 IF A = 5 THEN B = 7 
70 IF A - 6 THEN B -- 13 
80 IF A = 7 THEN B = -3 
90 IF A = 8 THEN B - 6 

Let's say the value in variable 
A is an integer between 5 and 21; 
you'd need 17 IF-THENs to cover 
all possibilities. Not only do the 17 
lines take up memory, but they also 
slow down the program. If the vari- 
able A happens to equal 19, the 
program has to go through several 
tests: Is A equal to 5? No. Is it 6? No, 
Is it 7? And so on. 

The 17 lines of IF-THENs 
could be replaced by the following 
lines. First, put this at the beginning 
of the program: 

10 DIM ZZ(17): FOR X = 1 TO 17: READ 

ZZ{X): NEXT 
12 DATA 7,13,-3,6,... 

The DATA statement would 
have to be filled in with the appro- 
priate values, which are stored in 
the numeric array ZZ. Then, later in 
the program, where all the IF- 
THENs occur, a single line suffices: 

60 B = ZZ(A-4) 

Since the number in variable A 
is between 5 and 21, we subtract 4 
to match it up with the array num- 
bered from 1 to 17. The technique 
101 COMPUTEfs GazettB November 1988 



saves memory and noticeably im- 
proves the program speed. 

Substituting A Period 
For Zero 

In many cases, a period all by itself 
will act like a zero. Word has spread 
among Commodore programmers 
that a period is a good substitute. 
For obtaining random values, many 
programmers seem to prefer 
RND{.), which is said to be faster 
than RND(O) and more random 
than RND(l). We can test this with 
two programs. First we'll measure 
the speed of a period versus a zero: 

EG 10 TIS="000000" 

KM 20 FORJ=lTO1000:K=RNDt . ) :NE 

XTtPRINT TI 
SK 30 TIS="000000" 
PS 40 FORJ=1TO1000:K=RND(0} :NE 

XTjPRINT TI 
JF 50 Z=0:TI5="000000" 
KM 60 FORJ=1TO1000!K=RND(Z) :NE 

XTtPRINT TI 

On a 128 in 64 mode, the times 
were 174 jiffies (a jiffy is 1/60 sec- 
ond) when a period was used, 208 
for a zero, and 186 for a variable 
equal to zero. A period is about 16 
percent faster than a zero, which is 
quite an increase in speed. But if we 
substitute a variable equal to zero, 
the time saved is only about 6 per- 
cent. This example generates 1000 
random numbers in roughly 180 jif- 
fies, or 3/1000 second per random 
number. Six percent of ,003 sec- 
onds doesn't amount to much, es- 
pecially when you consider that 
getting a random number is only a 
small part of most programs. 

Now let's see how the random 
numbers are created. The program 
below creates 5000 random num- 
bers from 1 to 1000, A 1000- 
element array keeps track of how 
many times each is picked. 

AM 10 S=0:R=0 

GQ 20 DIM A( 1.000) 

EC 30 F0RJ=1T05!PRINTJ, 

BX 40 FORK=1TO1000!R=INT(RND(S 

)*1000+1) !A(R)=A(R)+1 
XQ 50 NEXTK.J: PRINT 
CP 60 FORJ=1TO100:PRINTJ,A(J) : 

NEXT 



When 5 was zero, RND(S) 
gave these results: 90 was picked 16 
times, 94 was picked 20 times, and 
98 was picked 19 times (your re- 
sults may vary slightly). The num- 
bers 91, 92, 93, 95, 96, 97, 99, and 
100 never appeared at all. 

That's not the way a random 
number generator should work. 
RND(O) hits every fourth number 
(at least when you're asking for a 
number between 1 and 1000). It's 
like shaking dice 5000 times and 
seeing only twos and sixes. If you 
substitute S = 1 in line 10, the distri- 
bution of random numbers im- 
proves greatly, RND(l) is clearly 
the better choice. 

It's true that using a period 
yields a miniscule improvement in 
speed. But you should avoid RND(.) 
because of the problems associated 
with RND(O), Plus, it's confusing. 
Even if you understand that periods 
can replace zeros, RND(.) looks 
awkward and inelegant. 

Professional Programmers 

If you've been reading the GAZETTE 
for a few years, you might remem- 
ber the "inside View" section, 
where we published interviews 
with programmers. Fans of that col- 
umn might enjoy a new book from 
Microsoft Press called Programmers 
at Work. It includes interviews with 
19 well-known and successful 
microcomputer programmers. It's 
not an especially technical book, al- 
though it helps if you know a little 
about programming. 

Two motifs that run through 
the book are elegance and simplic- 
ity. No two programmers define el- 
egance the same way, but after 
you've read a few interviews, you 
start to get a pretty good notion of 
what it means. 

Lots of books teach program- 
ming, but very few show you how 
programmers think. If you'd like to 
know more about how professional 
programmers do what they do, I 
recommend this book. •

mm How To Type In 
COMPUTEVs GAZETTE Programs 



Each month, computei's gazette 
publishes programs for the Com- 
modore 128, 64, Plus/4, 16, and 
VIC-20, Each program is clearly 
marked by title and version. Be sure 
to type in the correct version for 
your machine. All 64 programs run 
on the 128 in 64 mode. Be sure to 
read the instructions in the corre- 
sponding article. This can save time 
and eliminate any questions which 
might arise after you begin typing. 

We frequently publish two 
programs designed to make typing 
easier: The Automadc Proofreader, 
and MLX, designed for entering 
machine language programs. 

When entering a BASIC pro- 
gram, be especially careful with 
DATA statements as they are ex- 
tremely sensitive to errors. A 
mistyped number in a DATA state- 
ment can cause your machine to 
"lock up" (you'll have no control 
over the computer). If this happens, 
the only recourse is to turn your 
computer off then back on, erasing 
whatever was in memory. So be 
sure to save a copy of your program 
before you run it. If your computer 
crashes, you can always reload the 
program and look for the error.

special Characters 

Most of the programs listed in each 
issue contain special control charac- 
ters. To facilitate typing in any pro- 
grams from the GAZETTE, use the 
following listing conventions. 

The most common type of con- 
trol characters in our listings appear 
as words within braces: {DOWN} 
means to press the cursor down 
key; {5 SPACES} means to press 
the space bar five times. 

To indicate that a key should 
be shifted {hold down the SHIFT 
key while pressing another key), 
the character is underlined. For ex- 
ample, A means hold down the 
SHIFT key and press A. You may 
see strange characters on your 
screen, but that's to be expected. If 
you find a number followed by an 
underlined key encJosed in braces 
(for example, {8 A}), type the key 
as many times as indicated (in our 
example, enter eight SHIFTed A's). 

If a key is enclosed in special 
brackets, § 1, hold down the 
Commodore key (at the lower left 
corner of the keyboard) and press 
the indicated character. 

Rarely, you'll see a single letter 
of the alphabet enclosed in braces.

This can be entered on the Com- 
modore 64 by pressing the CTRL 
key while typing the letter in 
braces. For example, {A} means to 
press CTRL-A. 

The Quote Mode 

Although you can move the cursor 
around the screen with the CRSR 
keys, often a programmer will want 
to move the cursor under program 
control. This is seen in examples 
such as {LEFT} and {HOME} in 
the program listings. The only way 
the computer can tell the difference 
between direct and programmed 
cursor control is the quote mode. 

Once you press the quote key, 
you're in quote mode. This mode 
can be confusing if you mistype a 
character and cursor left to change 
it. You'll see a reverse video charac- 
ter (a graphics symbol for cursor 
left). In this case, you can use the 
DELete key to back up and edit the 
line. Type another quote and you're 
out of quote mode. If things really 
get confusing, you can exit quote 
mode simply by pressing RETURN. 
Then just cursor up to the mistyped 
line and fix it.

The Automatic Proofreader 



Philip i. Nelson, Assistant Editor 

"The Automatic Proofreader" helps 
you type in program listings for the 
128, 64, Plus/4, 16, and ViC"20 and 
prevents nearly every kind of typing 
mistake. 

Type in the Proofreader exactly as 
listed. Since the program can't check it- 
self, type carefully to avoid mistakes. 
Don't omit any lines, even if they con- 
tain unfamiliar commands. After finish- 
ing, save a copy or two on disk or tape 
before running it. This is important be- 
cause the Proofreader erases the BASIC 
portion of itself when you run it, leav- 
ing ordy the machine language portion 
in memory. 

Next, type RUN and press RE- 
TURN. After announcing which com- 
puter it's running on, the Proofreader 
displays the message "Proofreader 
Active". Now you're ready to type in a 
BASIC program. 

Every time you finish typing a line 
and press RETURN, the Proofreader 
displays, a two-letter checksum in the 
upper-left corner of the screen. Com- 
pare this result with the two-letter 
checksum printed to the left of the line 
in the program listing. If the letters 
match, it's almost certain the line was 
typed correctly. If the letters don't 
match, check for your mistake and cor- 
rect the line. 

The Proofreader ignores spaces not 
enclosed in quotes, so you can omit or 
add spaces between keywords and still 
see a matching checksum. However, 
since spaces inside quotes are almost al- 
ways significant, the Proofreader pays 
attention to them. For example, 10 
PRINT'THIS IS BASIC" will generate 
a different checksum than 10 
PRINT'THIS ISBA SIC". 

A common typing error is transpo- 
sition — typing two successive charac- 
ters in the wrong order, like PIRNT 
instead of PRINT or 64378 instead of 
64738, The Proofreader is sensitive to 
the position of each character within the 
line and thus catches transposition 
errors. 

The Proofreader does not accept 
keyword abbreviations (for example, ? 
instead of PRINT). If you prefer to use 
abbreviations, you can still check the 
line by LlSTing it after typing it in, 
moving the cursor back to the line, and 



pressing RETURN, LlSTing the line 
substitutes the full keyword for the ab- 
breviation and allows the Proofreader 
to work properly. The same technique 
works for rechecking programs you've 
already typed in. 

If you're using the Proofreader on 
the Commodore 128, Plus/4, or 16, do 
7tot perform any GRAPHIC commands 
while the Proofreader is active. When 
you perform a command like GRAPH- 
IC 1, the computer moves everything at 
the start of BASIC program space — in- 
cluding the Proofreader — to another 
memory area, causing the Proofreader 
to crash. The same thing happens if you 
run any program with a GRAPHIC 
command while the Proofreader is in 
memory, 

Thougn the Proofreader doesn't 
interfere with other BASIC operations, 
it's a good idea to disable it before run- 
ning another program. However, the 
Proofreader is purposely difficult to dis- 
lodge: It's not affected by tape or disk 
operations, or by pressing RUN/ 
STOP- RESTORE. The simplest way to 
disable it is to turn the computer off 
then on. A gentler method is to SYS to 
the computer's built-in reset routine 
(SYS 65341 for the 128, 64738 for the 
64, 65526 for the Plus/4 and 16, and 
64802 for the VIC). These reset routines 
erase any program in memory, so be 
sure to save the program you're typing 
in before entering the SYS command. 

If you own a Commodore 64, you 
may already have wondered whether 
the Proofreader works with other pro- 
gramming utilities like "MetaBASIC." 
The answer is generally yes, if you're 
using a 64 and activate the Proofreader 
after installing the other utility. For ex- 
ample, first load and activate Meta- 
BASIC, then load and run the 
Proofreader, 

When using the Proofreader with 
another utility, you should disable both 
programs before running a BASIC pro- 
gram. WhUe the Proofreader seems un- 
affected by most utilities, there's no 
way to promise that it will work with 
any and every combination of utilities 
you might want to use. The more utili- 
ties activated, the more fragile the sys- 
tem becomes.

MLX 



Machine Language Editor 
For The Commodore 64 



Ottis Cowper 
Technical Editor 



"MLX" is a labor-saving utility that 
will help you enter machine lan- 
guage program listings without error. 
MLX is required to enter all Commo- 
dore 64 machine language programs 
published in computei's gazette. 
This version of MLX was first pub- 
lished in the January 1986 issue; it 
cannot be used to enter MLX pro- 
grams published prior to that date, 
nor can earlier versions of MLX be 
used to enter the listings in this issue. 

Type in and save a copy of MLX. You'l! 
need it for all future machine language 
programs in COMPUTEl's GAZETTE, as 
well as machine language (ML) pro- 
grams in our companion magazine, 
COMPUTE!, and COMPUTE! books. 
When you're ready to enter an ML pro- 
gram, load and run MLX. It asks you for 
a starting and ending address. These 
addresses appear in the article accom- 
panying the MLX-format program list- 
ing you're typing. If you're unfamiliar 
with ML, the addresses (and all other 
values you enter in MLX) may appear 
strange. Instead of the usual decimal 
numbers you're accustomed to, these 
numbers are in hexadecima} — a base 16 
numbering system commonly used by 
ML programmers. Hexadecimal — hex 
for short — includes the numerals 0-9 
and the letters A-F. But even if you 
know nothing about ML or hex, you 
should have no trouble using MLX. 

After you enter the starting and 
ending addresses, MUC offers the op- 
tion of clearing the workspace. The data 
you enter with MLX is kept in a special 
reserved area of memory; clearing this 
workspace area fills the reserved area 
with zeros, which will make it easier to 
find where you left off typing if you en- 
ter the listing in several sessions. 
Choose this option if you're starting to 
enter a new listing. If you're continuing 
a listing that's partially typed from a 
previous session there's no point in 
clearing the workspace, since the data 
you load in will fill the area with what- 
ever values were in workspace memory 
at the time of the last Save. 

At this point, MLX presents a 
menu of commands: 

Enter data 

Display data 

Load data 

Save file 

Quit 

Press the corresponding key to select a 
menu option. These commands are 
available only while the menu is dis- 



played. You can get back to the menu 
from most options by pressing 

RETURN. 

Entering A Listing 

To begin entering data, press E. You'll 
be asked for the address at which you 
wish to begin. (If you pressed E by mis- 
take, you can return to the command 
menu by pressing RETURN.) When 
you begin typing a listing, enter the 
starting address here. If you're typing in 
a long listing in several sessions, you 
should enter the address where you left 
off typing at the end of the previous 
session. In any case, make sure the ad- 
dress you enter corresponds to the ad- 
dress of a tine in the MLX listing. 
Otherwise, you'll be unable to enter the 
data correctly. 

After you enter the address, you'll 
see that address appear as a prompt 
with a nonblinking cursor. Now you're 
ready to enter data. To help prevent 
typing mistakes, only a few keys are ac- 
tive, so you may have to unlearn some 
habits. MLX listings consist of nine col- 
umns of two-digit numbers — eight bytes 
of data and a checksum. You do not type 
spaces between the columns; the new 
MLX automatically inserts these for 
you. Nor do you press RETURN after 
typing the last number in a line; MLX 
automatically enters and checks the 
line after you type the last digit. The 
only keys needed for data entry are 0-9 
and A-F. Pressing most of the other 
keys produces a warning buzz. 

To correct typing mistakes before 
finishing a line, use the INST/DEL key 
to delete the character to the left of the 
cursor. (The cursor-left key also de- 
letes.) If you mess up a line badly, press 
CLR/HOME to start the line over. The 
RETURN key is also active, but only 
before any data is typed on a line. Press- 
ing RETURN at this point returns you 
to the command menu. After you type a 
character, MLX disables RETURN until 
the cursor returns to the start of a line. 
Remember, you can press CLR/HOME 
to quickly get to a line number prompt. 

Beep Or Buzz? 

After you type the last digit in a line, 
MLX calculates a checksum from the 
line number and the first eight columns 
of data, then compares it with the value 
in the ninth column. The formula 
(found in lines 370-390 of the MLX 
program) catches almost every conceiv- 
able typing error, including the trans- 
position of numbers. If the values 



match, you'll hear a pleasant beep, the* 
data is added to the workspace area, 
and the prompt for the next line of data 
appears (unless the line just entered 
was the last line of the listing— in 
which case you'll automatically ad- 
vance to the Save option). But if MLX 
detects a typing error, you'll hear a low 
buzz and see an error message. Then 
MLX redisplays the line for editing. 

To edit a line, move the cursor left 
and right using the cursor keys. (The 
INST/DEL key now works as an alter- 
native cursor-left key.) You cannot 
move left beyond the first character in 
the line. If you try to move beyond the 
rightmost character, you'll reenter the 
line. To make corrections in a mistyped 
line, compare the line on the screen 
with the one printed in the listing, then 
move the cursor to the mistake and type 
the correct key. During editing, RE- 
TURN is active; pressing it tells MLX to 
recheck the line. You can press the 
CLR/HOME key to clear the entire line 
if you want to start from scratch, or if 
you want to get to a line number 
prompt to use RETURN to get back to 
the menu. 

Other MLX Functions 

The Display data option lets you review 
your work. When you select D, you'll 
be asked for a starting address. (As with 
the other menu options, pressing RE- 
TURN at this point takes you back to 
the command menu.) Make sure the ad- 
dress corresponds to a line from the list- 
ing. You can pause the scrolling display 
by pressing the space bar. (MLX finish- 
es printing the current line before hatt- 
ing.) To resume scrolling, press the 
space bar again. The display continues 
to scroti until the ending address is 
reached, then the menu reappears. To 
break out of the display and return to 
the menu before the ending address is 
reached,, press RETURN. A quick way 
to check your typing is to compare the 
reverse video checksums on the screen 
with the data in the rightmost column 
of the printed listing. If the values 
match, you can be sure the line is en- 
tered correctly. 

The Save and Load menu options 
are straightforward. First, MLX asks for 
a filename. (Again, pressing RETURN 
at this prompt without entering any- 
thing returns you to the command 
menu.) Next, MLJC asks you to press 
either T or D for tape or disk. If you no- 
tice the disk drive starting and stopping 
several times during a toad or save, 



COMPUTE! s Galeae November 1986 109 



don't panic; this behavior is nonTial be- 
cause MIj; opens and reads from or 
writes to the file instead of using the 
usual LOAD and SAVE commands. For 
disk, the drive prefix 0; is automatically 
added to the filename (iine 750), so this 
should twt be included when entering 
the name. (This also precludes the use 
of @ for Save-with-Replace, so remem- 
ber to give each version saved a differ- 
ent name.) MLX saves the entire work- 
space area from the starting to ending 
address, so the save or toad may take 
longer than you might expect if you've 
entered only a small amount of data 
from a long listing. When saving a par- 
tially completed listing, make sure to 
note the address where you stopped 
typing so you'll know where to resume 
entry when you reload. 

MLX reports any errors detected 
during the save or load. (Tape users 
should bear in mind that the Commo- 
dore 64 is never able to detect errors 
when saving to tape.) MLX also has 
three special load error messages: 
INCORRECT STARTING ADDRESS, 
which means the file you're trying to 
load does not have the starting address 
you specified when you ran MLX; 
LOAD ENDED AT address, which 
means the file you're trying to load 
ends before the ending address you 
specified when you started MLX; and 
TRUNCATED AT ENDING ADDRESS, 
which means the file you're trying to 
load extends beyond the ending ad- 
dress you originally specified. If you get 
one of these messages and feel certain 
that you've loaded the right file, exit 
and rerun MLX, being careful to enter 
the correct ending address. 

The Quit menu option has the ob- 
vious effect — it stops MLX and enters 
BASIC at a READY prompt. Since the 
RUN/STOP key is disabled, Q lets you 
exit the program without turning off the 
computer. (Of course, RUN/STOP- 
RESTORE also gets you out.) You'll be 
asked for verification; press Y to exit to 
BASIC, or any other key to return to the 
menu. After quitting, you can type 
RUN again and reenter MLX without 
losing your data, as long as you don't 
use the clear workspace option. 

The Finished Product 

When you've finished typing all the 
data for an ML program and saved your 
work, you're ready to see the results. 
The instructions for loading the fin- 
ished product vary from program to 
program. Some ML programs are de- 
signed to be loaded and run like BASIC 
programs, so ail you need to type is 
LOAD ■'filename", 8 for disk or LOAD 
"fUename" for tape, and then RUN. 
(Such programs usually have 0801 as 
their MLX starting address.) Others 
must be reloaded to specific addresses 



with a command such as LOAD "file- 
uamL'",8A for disk or LOAD "file- 
name", 1,1 for tape, then started with a 
SYS to a particular memory address. 
(On the Commodore 64, the most com- 
mon starting address for such programs 
is 49152, which corresponds to MLX 
address COOO.) In any case, you should 
always refer to the article which accom- 
panies the ML listing for information on 
loading and running the program. 

By the time you finish typing in the 
data for a long ML program, you'll have 
several hours invested in the project. 
Don't take chances — use our "Auto- 
matic Proofreader" to type in MLX, and 
then test your copy thoroughly before 
first using it to enter any significant 
amount of data. (Incidentally, MLX is 
included every month on the gazette 
DISK.) Make sure all the menu options 
work as they should. Enter fragments of 
the program starring at several different 
addresses, then use the Display option 
to verify that the data has been entered 
correctly. And be sure to test the Save 
and Load options several times to en- 
sure that you can recall your work from 
disk or tape. Don't let a simple typing 
error in MLX cost you several nights of 
hard work.

protecllon from your expensive soUwaro, 
Irjflvlng you with UNPROTECTED. TOTALLY

This system has many advantages over Ihe 
Older nibbler type of ulililies. For one thing. 
you don't have lo experiment. Each 
parameter WILL backup the lilie It was ere

For another, a bact<-up oraalotl wiih

A Printer For 
All Reasons 

Search For The Best 

High Quality Graphic Printer 

The ResullB Are In We ran many printers through 
our battery of tests and this one came out first in its 
class. Our SP-1000. built by Seiko is a 100 ctiaracters 
per second. {12 horizontal by 9 vertical matrix), full bi- 
directional, logic seeking, true descender printer. The 
character matrix in NLQ {Near Letter Quality) mode is 
a very dense 24 {horizontal) by 18 (vertical). 

Features That Won't Quit With the SP-iOOO your 
computer can now print 40, 48, 68, 80. 96, or 136 
characters per line. You can print in scores of style 
variations. You not only have standard Pica, Elite, 
Condensed and Italics, but also true Superscripts and 
Subscripts. Use bold, or ;/a//cs to make the words 
stand out. Or. if you wish to be even more emphatic. 
underline the words. You can combine many modes 
and styles to make the variation almost endless. 

Forms? YesI Your Letterhead? Of Coursel 

The tractors are adjustable from 4 to 10 inches. You 
can also use single sheets, plain typing paper, your 
letterhead, short memo forms, labels, whatever you 
choose Any size to 10" in width. It will even load your 
paper automatically Multiple copies? Absolutely' Use 
forms up to 3 thick Spread sheets with many 
columns? Just go to condensed mode printing and 
print a full 136 columns wide all on a standard 8V/' 
wide page. Forget expensive wide-carriage printers 
and having to change to wide carriage paper. 

An Extra Long Life (2.5 million character) ribbon 
cartridge is only S1 1 00. Order M2001 . You need 
absolutely nothing else to start printing— just add 
paper (single sheet or tanfold tractor) 




The warranty has now been extended to 2 years and 
service centers are located nationwide for your 
convenience

THE ORB OF CELESTIAL HARMONY 

A danger-filled adventure . 
through a complex and ' 
colorful Oriental world of 
magiCf mysticism artd intrigue. 
^ By Greg Malone. 




'iV 



^ -^ ^ Available on Apple' 

oebius, the 
fabled deity of the 
island kingdom 
of Khantun, has 
chosen you, his 
'^ disciple, to recover 
the stolen Orb from the renegade 
Warlord and prevent the destruc- 
tion of the universe. 

You will journey through the 

ascending planes of Earth, Water, Air and Fire, At each 
level your challenges increase in difficulty, demanding 
greater courage and cunning. All of your martial arts 
skills will be required to survive the ninja-like assassins 
who seek to foil your quest. Sword-wielding rebel 
guards will test your blade every step of the way. And 
watch out for wild beasts that stalk the forests! 

Local villagers can help, but beware— the wrong 
approach will frighten them away, leaving you in a 
world where starvation looms ever-present. Wise use 
I! of magical charms, prayers and fireballs is essential in 
reaching the final confrontation with the treacherous 
f'-^ Warlord— where victory brings recovery of the long- 
sought Orb of Celestial Harmony. Good luck!
