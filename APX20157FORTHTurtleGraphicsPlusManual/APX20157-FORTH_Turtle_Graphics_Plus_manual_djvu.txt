OVERVIEW 

FORTH TURTLE GRAPHICS PLUS is a package of FORTH "words" (functions) that adds the 
standard turtle graphics of languages like ATARI PILOT and LOGO to EXTENDED fig-FORTH, 
available through AFX* Implemented in integer math* the package also supports a 
normalized coordinate system, the ability to create windows with clipped lines on any 
part of the screen display without having to modify a program, the twelve graphics modes 
available with the new GTIA chip, and the TRIG functions *SXN» *COS f and *TAN for use in 
FORTH programs* Also included is a graphics mode 8 screen dump utility for Epson printers 
with GRAFTRAX* Yet with all these features, FORTH TURTLE GRAPHICS PLUS compiles to only 
2K of memory! 



REQUIRED ACCESSORIES 

24K RAM (more for some graphics modes) 
Extended fig-Forth (AFX-20029) 
ATARI 810 Disk Drive 

OPTIONAL ACCESSORIES 

EPSON MX-80 or 100 Printer with GRAFTRAX

THE COORDINATE SYSTEM 

While you're using FORTH TURTLE GRAPHICS PLUS, the coordinate system is fixed and 
independent of the ATARI Computer's graphic coordinates* It is centered on 0*0 and 
extends to +/-1000 along both the X and Y axes* Figure 1 depicts the range along both 
axes*

Figure 1 Range along X and Y axes 

The two screen modes best used with FORTH TURTLE GRAPHICS PLUS are BASIC modes 7 and S« 
These modes are accessed by the functions GRS and GR7, which set the window to the entire 
graphic display* The GTIA modes are on screen 8, which includes the functions GR? and 

GR11* To use other modes* use the GR* function ( mode )♦ as described in the EXTENDED 

fig-Forth documentation* and set an appropriate window* 




TURTLE FUNCTIONS 



MOVE ( x 



Move in the current direction x units. 
TURN (x ) 

Turn x degrees to the right* 
TT7KKTO ( x ) 

Turn to a direction of x degrees* 
PEN ( x ) 

Select pen color x and place the pen down* The color corresponds to the COLOR 
command in ATARI BASIC* 

PENUP( ) 

Lift the pen up* 



PENDN ( 



) 




Place the pen down. 
GOXT ( x y ) 



Go to the coordinate x, y with the pen up. 



DRAWTO ( x y 



) 



Go to the 



linate x, y with the pen down. 



CLEAR < n ) 

Fill the window with color n. 
FRAMEIT ( n ) 

Draw a box around the window in color n. 



CENTER ( ) 



The same as a 0 0 GOXY command* 



BOX ( n ) 



Draw a box of dimension n* 



SCREEN DESCRIPTIONS 



Screen 1 

Contains the code to create the trig table used by *SIN* *COS* and *TAN* This table 
is located by the variable TRIGTAE* 

Screen 2 

The recursion function RECURSE is defined on line 0. This allows a FORTH word to 
call itself* Recursion is used by the function ANGSET, which converts any angle to 
an angle within 0-33? degrees* The trig functions are defined on this screen* The 
trig functions *$Dl# *COS, and *TAN are implemented by doing a look-up on TRIGTAB* 

Screen 3 

The variables used by FORTH TURTLE GRAPHICS PLUS are defined here. Some functions 
are also defined* The coordinate size* +/- 1000, is set on line 15* 

Screen 4 

Some of the clipping functions, the variables used by the clipping function* and the 
transformation to the window are defined here* 

Screen 5 

This screen contains the bulk of the clipping function ♦ which clips lines to the +/- 
1000 window* It is based on the FORTRAN clipping program in A Practical 
Introduction to Computer Graphics * This results in a larger FORTH function than 
is normally desirable* 

Screen 6 

The remaining turtle functions are defined here* Some examples of turtle functions 
(BOX* CUBE* and CIRCLE) are also defined* 

Screen 7 

The CLEAR and CENTER functions are defined here* 
Screen 8 

The GTIA extensions are defined* along with the demonstrations GSQUIRAL* BOXES, 
SPIRAL* DEMO 1 1 and BEM02* All demonstrations except DEM02 have a stack diagram ( 
)♦ specifying the number of iterations* (DEM02 does not affect the stack*) 

Screen 9 

This screen defines GRDUMP ( )♦ which sends a graphics mode 3 screen dump to an 

Epson printer with GRAFTRAX* You must execute a PON command before dumping* The 
data is echoed on the bottom of the screen J the data may include the bell character* 




9 LOAD 



to load in the screen containing the graphics mode 3 screen dump function* Then to dump 
the circle command, type 

GR8 INIT 100 CIRCLE PON GRDUMP POFF 

The figure looks like this: 




To dump the BOX command, type 

GRS INIT 50 0 BOX PON GRDUMP POFF 
The figure looks like thisJ 




To dump the CUBE command, type 

GRS INIT '!0 0 CUE:E PON GRDUMP POFF
