1. INTRODUCTION 

LHAZ version 5 is a full-featured, integrated, laser hazard assessment program. It combines a 
maximum permissible exposure (MPE) calculator and American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI) classification 1 routine with hazard assessment and range equations worksheets to make 
laser safety assessment and hazard control easier for laser safety officers, managers, and other 
key decision makers. 

LHAZ strictly adheres to the most recent version of the ANSI Standard Z136.1, ANSI Z136.1- 
2007 1 . 

Please note, however, LHAZ is not an “expert system.” It is not a replacement for a 
knowledgeable laser safety officer. It is only a tool to help laser safety officers in the 
performance of their duties. LHAZ 5.0 assumes that the user has a basic working knowledge of 
the ANSI Z136.1 Standard 1 . 

2. HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS 

To run this program, you need a PC with: 

• Microsoft Windows XP with .NET version 1.1 

• Approximately 20 MB of free Hard Drive space 

• A display capable of at least a 1024x768 resolution. 

3. GETTING STARTED 

There are several ways to learn LHAZ on your own. Experienced laser safety officers will find 
the program fairly self-explanatory and may wish to learn by trial and error. We suggest that you 
read through this guide with the program running in front of you. This way, you can follow 
along on the computer and execute the examples in the guide. Whichever way you decide to 
approach this program, please read the guide! 

3.1 INTENDED AUDIENCE 

LHAZ is not a replacement for a knowledgeable laser safety officer; it is only intended as a 
tool to help the laser safety officer. As such, both the guide and the program are intended for 
an audience that is already familiar with laser systems and laser safety. 

3.2 AFRL/RHD APPLICATION FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW 

Those familiar with ALRL/RHDO research and analysis capabilities will recognize that their 
most widely distributed analysis tool is the Laser Hazard Analysis Software application known 
as LHAZ. The typically delivered LHAZ 4.x Standard Edition application encapsulates the data 
and methodologies encapsulated in the ANSI Z136.1 (2007) 1 standard and also provides a 
propagation model and hazard distance computation model. Many may not be aware that LHAZ 
also comes in a professional edition which includes Vision Effects, ED50, LELAWS, and a laser 
system database. As the ALRL/RHDO development team added and extended LHAZ, they 
quickly realized that the basic LHAZ application was not originally designed for easy 
extensibility. One common theme that came up every time LHAZ was extended was the need to 
“re-plumb” the wiring to gain access to laser parameters and other common functionality. This 


1 

Distribution A, APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE; DISTRIBUTION UNLIMITED. 



drove the understanding that what was really needed was a plug-in based architecture that would 
allow common functionality to be used by any new analyses without duplication. 

The time saved on not re-implementing common functionality is time available to focus on the 
primary task of implementing the analyses themselves. The AFRL/RHD Application Framework 
provides a developer with just such a capability by encapsulating common user interface features 
in an easy to use library. Developers write “plug-ins” to the framework that focus on providing 
the user with parameters for the analyses, called “Properties”, and “Analysis Windows” which 
present the user with the results of the analyses. 

3.2.1 Assembly Architecture 

The AFRL/RHD Application Framework is a Microsoft .NET application. It consists of these 
assemblies found in the bin folder: 

• HEDO_AppFramework_Client.exe 

• HEDO_AppFramework.dll 

• PropertyGridHelper.dll 

• RichTextEditor.dll 

• MagicLibrary.dll 

• ZedGraph.dll 

The key assembly in the ones listed above is the HEDO_AppFramework.dll. As of this writing, 
the version number for the framework is 2.5.0.38. In addition to these standard assemblies for 
the framework, the LHAZ Plugin requires these assemblies: 

• LHAZ_Plugin.dll 

• LTMC_Adapter.dll 

• LTMC.dll 

3.2.2 Starting the Framework 

To start the application, run the HEDO_AppFramework_Client.exe found in the bin directory. 
When the program starts, it first opens a console window that is used for occasional debugging 
output. It also creates a dialog window that shows the plug-ins loaded from the bin directory. 



Application Loading Dialog 

If there are no plug-ins loaded, the framework will display this “About Window” that says that 
no plug-ins were loaded. The standard installation of LHAZ 5 places the plug-in dll’s, along with 
their dependencies, in their proper place in the bin directory. If you do see this window because 
no plug-ins were loaded, re-install LHAZ 5.

3.2.3 Menus and Window Layout 



The Framework Windows 

The framework application main form consists of a large client area with a menu and property 
grid. The title bar shows the name of the application, the name of the file that has been loaded or 
saved along with its modified status (an asterisk ‘*’ denotes that some property has changed 
since last saved), and which analysis window is active. The Property Grid may be hidden, 
shown, pinned, and docked with standard windows docking functionality. The size and dock 
position of the property grid, along with the framework window position and size, the last 
document loaded, and a list of recent documents are saved in an XML file in the user’s system 
settings folder. 

The top menu bar has a variety of menu and sub-menu options. Options that have keyboard 
shortcuts are listed in the menu. The main window has these menus: 


1. The File menu group has standard File Loading and Saving Functionality, as well as the 
ability to quickly load recent documents and Exit the application. 

2. The Edit menu group contains Undo and Redo functions. These functions will often 
show what operation is being undone and redone. 

3. The Windows menu allows the user standard operations on the open analysis windows, 
like the ability to close, close all, show or hide the properties grid, activate, cascade, tile, 
switch to next and switch to previous analysis windows. 


4 

Distribution A, APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE; DISTRIBUTION UNLIMITED. 







































4. The Analysis menu group is reserved for plug-ins to place their analysis windows. 

Groups of plug-ins may share a sub-menu, and all of the analysis windows available for 
those plug-ins may be opened from here. 

5. The Reports menu allows the user to open and save Rich Text Formatted (RTF) files and 
edit/save them directly from within the framework. The user may type on these reports 
and paste values from context menus in the analysis windows. There are also menu 
options for printing and saving Standard Reports . 

6. The Units menu group allows the user to select units globally for all of the analysis 
windows in the application. In LHAZ, for example, the user may change the units that 
are displayed for all hazard distances, not only for all of the analysis windows in LHAZ, 
but for any analysis windows in any other loaded plugin that subscribes to the Hazard 
Distances Global Unit set. 

7. The Help menu group allows the user to see an “About Window” that shows the date, the 
version of the framework, and a list of all of the loaded plug-ins. The user may select any 
plug-in from the list and see the full path fdename of the plug-in, the load status, and the 
version of the plug-in. The load status of LHAZ shows the current version of LTMC. 

The users may also right-click on any of the text fields in this about window and copy the 
text to the system clipboard or report.

Working with Properties 


Analysis windows are places where the user may see the results of the analyses provided by the 
plug-ins. When an analysis window is active, all of the parameters for the analyses featured in 
that analysis window are shown as properties in the Property Grid. When the user changes a 
value in the property grid, the analysis window either automatically updates the analysis results, 
or provides the user with the ability to re-evaluate the analysis if the analysis takes some time to 
complete. The user may also use “Ctrl-z” and “Ctrl-y” to undo and redo changes made to 
properties. 


6 

Distribution A, APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE; DISTRIBUTION UNLIMITED. 







































The Property Grid is a robust tool that allows the user to collapse categories and groups of 
properties. Most properties are just typed into the text fields. Some properties have advanced 
features that allow drop-down menus or separate dialog windows that allow for editing. 

Numeric values that have units may often be typed in using those units. If unit entry is allowed, 
analysts are provided a list of possible conversions in a drop down menu. Properties that 
represent files provide a standard Window’s File Dialog. The descriptions pane of the Property 
Grid describes the currently selected property in more detail. See the Properties section for more 
information on working with the Property Grid in general and the LHAZ properties in particular. 

The properties in the Property Grid, as well as the groups they are in, provide the user with a 
right-click context menu that allows the user to reset the value or group of values to a default, or 
to copy the values to the system clipboard or open report. 

3.2.6 Standard Reports 



The Standard Reports Menu 

As mentioned earlier, the Reports menu allows the user to create a new RTF report within the 
framework, open an existing report, or print and save standard reports. If the PRINT menu is 
used, the user is provided with a standard Print Preview Dialog Window of the completed 
standard report to print from. If the SAVE menu is used, the user is provided with a standard 
File Save As Dialog Window to save the file. The user may not edit these standard reports 
directly. 

Standard reports are generated when the user selects a report from the “Print Standard Report” or 
“Save Standard Report” sun-menu. These menus are generated by developers at AFRL/RHDO 
using macros that extract information from the analysis windows. When a standard report is 
generated, the analysis windows that are required to generate the report are opened and activated 
if they are not already opened, so the user may find analysis windows opened that were not 
opened when they started to generate the report.

3.2.7 User Edited Reporting 



Report Window 

The AFRL/RHD Application Framework provides plug-in developers with standard tools that 
allow users to create reports. The framework provides a rich-text-file editor that allows the user 
to create their report. Undo/Redo works from within the report windows, as does full featured 
find/replace and font dialogs. 

Many of the labels on the analysis windows, About Window, and Property Grid provide context 
menus that allow the user to copy the value to the system clip-board, for pasting into applications 
external to the framework, or to send the value to any open report window. Sending a value to a 
report window will paste the value at the current cursor position, overwriting any selected text.

Sending a string to a Report with a Context Menu 


The Property Grid also provides the user with a right-click context menu that allows the user to 
copy values or groups of items to the clipboard. When copying a single item, just that item is 
immediately placed on the clipboard. If copying a group, a separate window shows the user the 
block of text to be copied.

Analysis windows often also provide context menus for copying single items or blocks of text 
for analysis results to the clipboard with the same dialog window. The user may select from 
several versions of the report text to copy to the clipboard. 

3.2.8 Graphing 



Graph Windows are Accessed via Context Menus 

The AFRL/RHD Application Framework provides plug-in developers with standard tools that 
allow users to create graphs. These graphs are accessed by the user via context menus tied to the 
GUI widgets that display the results of graph-able analyses. The graphs can be customized for 
inclusion in any report, either as an image, or the data can be copied and pasted in any 
spreadsheet application.

3.2.9 Batch Reporting 

The AFRL/RHD Application Framework provides plug-in developers with standard tools that 
allow users to create batch reports. This feature is also accessed via context menus tied to the 
user interface fields that display the results of batch reportable analyses. These reports allow the 
user to perform an analysis over and over again on a set of parameters that can be varied.

Use the Context Menu to open the Batch Report Window 


Batch reporting in the AFRL/RHD Application Framework is performed by the user first 
generating, then populating, a template file (a .csv file that can be loaded in a spreadsheet 
program) with the appropriate parameters, then providing that template file to the framework. 
The framework then generates another .csv file that shows the inputs provided, along with the 
result of each analysis. The user provides the template file, where to write the output file, and 
starts generating the report via the Batch Report Window.

Distribution A, APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE; DISTRIBUTION UNLIMITED. 

































Batch Report Window 

The template file needs to be in a specific format. Pressing the “Export Input File Template” 
button first provides the user with a “File Save...” dialog that prompts the user as to where the 
newly created template file should be written. It then creates a file that is in the correct format, 
with a single line that represents the current input parameters and the results. The parameters 
listed will ONLY be those that are visible and enabled in the property grid when the batch report 
is run. The user can then use Windows Explorer to navigate to that file and open it. By default, 
a “.csv” file opens in a spreadsheet program, like MS Excel.

In the example shown above, we add five lines (rows 7-11) for a total of six batch runs to be 
completed, including the original. You can also modify the original parameters if you would 
like. When the batch report is generated, the results will be over-written. After making the 
modifications, save the template file. 

Back in the Batch Report Window; specify the output file by pressing the “Designate Output 
File” button. This will prompt you with another “File Save...” dialog that allows you to specify 
where the final output file will be written. The “Generate Report Window” button will be 
disabled until both input and output files are specified. Pressing that button generates the report, 
and opens a window that provides status and error information.

Output File Results 


The output file shows the results of each of the analyses in order. Note that each row shows the 
parameters that the user provided, and reminds the user of the other parameters that were not 
changed as well.

The user may also use the context menu to select units for many of the analysis results in the 
analysis windows. These context menus resemble those used in the property grid. The user may 
also use the “Units” top-level menu to select units which would affect all of the analyses of a 
particular type, rather than just that specific item. All of these unit settings are persisted for the 
next framework session. 

3.2.11 Saving Your Work 

The File menu group allows for standard document loading and saving. When the framework 
launches, it attempts to load that last used file. If that file no longer exists on the user’s system, a 
dialog box will inform the user of the failed attempt to load. A list of the most recently used files 
is listed in the File menu group as well. The title bar shows the file name of the currently opened 
document, along with an asterisk when the current document is modified from its original 
saved state. 

The document saved by the framework has the extension “.afs”. The document is in an XML 
text format that can be edited (carefully) in any text editor. The document contains the values of 
all of the properties for all loaded plug-ins in the framework. It also contains the positions and 
sizes of all of the opened analysis windows, as well as which one is active. The framework is 
robust in handling differences in the loaded plug-ins and versions from the time the file is saved 
to the time the file is opened. This means that a user may send a file to a colleague even if both 
users do not have the same set of plug-ins. 

3.3 INSTALLING LHAZ VERSION 5 

If you’re installing LHAZ from CD (and the “autorun” capability is turned on), you should 
simply have to follow the on-screen instructions to install LHAZ. If you have downloaded 
LHAZ, you will need to open the Setup.exe file (usually by double-clicking it), and then follow 
the on-screen instructions. 

3.4 REMOVING LHAZ VERSION 5 

LHAZ can be removed from your system by looking under the “Add/Remove Programs” option 
in the Windows Control Panel 

3.5 UPDATING LHAZ VERSION 5

3.6 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING 
TIPS 

1) Q: My LHAZ 5 installation CD does not start the install process automatically 
when I insert the CD. How can I get LHAZ 5 to install? 

A: Open your Windows Explorer and right-click on the icon for the CDROM drive. 
Select “Explore” and find the “Setup.exe” file. Double-click the setup.exe file, and the 
installation process should begin. 

2) Q: How do I remove LHAZ 5 from my computer? 

A: From the Windows Start Menu, select Settings, Control Panel. Double-Click the 
“Add/Remove Programs” Icon. In the list of programs installed, there should be an 
LHAZ 5. Remove the program by selecting the appropriate removal option for the 
version of Windows that you currently have installed. 

3) Q: I cannot view the User’s Guide on the CD, or/and I cannot view the User’s 
Guide from the LHAZ group in the Start Menu. What is wrong? 

A: You must have either Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat Reader Installed on your 
computer in order to view the User’s Guide. You can download the Adobe Acrobat 
Reader from the internet at: http://www.adobe.com/ . 

4) Q: Can I give LHAZ 5 to someone else to install on his or her computer? Can I 
make copies of the LHAZ 5 CD? 

A: No. Please direct anyone interested in obtaining LHAZ 5 to AFRL/RHDO. The 
distribution is limited to DOD employees and DOD contractors. We keep a record of the 
number of installations throughout the DOD and keep a record of user information so that 
they can be notified of any changes or updates to LHAZ. Accurate records of the number 
of installations are also critical to our ability to continue providing future versions of 
LHAZ. 


5) Q: Where can I get support or information regarding updates to LHAZ 5? 

A: LHAZ 5 is maintained by the Air Force Research Laboratory, Optical Radiation 
Branch at Brooks City-Base, TX. Updates are occasionally available to the software, as 
well as the Users Guide. Information regarding the latest version of LHAZ can be found 
by contacting them (see Appendix FT Users can request an updated version of LHAZ or 
the latest user’s manual.

6) Q: Where can I register my copy of LHAZ 5? 

A: When you receive and install LHAZ 5, please take the time to register the software 
with the Air Force Research Laboratory, Optical Radiation Branch at Brooks City-Base, 
TX. See Appendix F for contact information. This will allow us to notify you if there are 
any updates, and contact you when the next version of LHAZ is released. Note that you 
will not receive updates if you have not registered your software. 

It is very important for AFRL/RHDO to accurately track the number of LHAZ 
installations DOD-wide, so that continued funding for this important project will 
continue. 

7) Q: Can I view the LHAZ 5 User’s Guide without installing the software? 

A: Yes, an Adobe Acrobat version of the User’s Guide is included on the LHAZ 5 
distribution CD in the top-level directory. Adobe Acrobat Reader™ is required to view 
the document. 

8) Q: How can I determine what version/release of LHAZ I have installed? What is 
the LTMC version number? What should I do if there is an update available? 

A: The framework’s “Help”, “About AFRL/RHD Application Framework...” pull-down 
menu will open a dialog box that will give the current version of the AFRL/RHD 
Application Framework and each of the plug-ins that are currently installed. Select 
“LHAZ Plugin” from the list of installed plug-ins (it may be the only one) to see the 
version, release, and build number of LHAZ and LTMC. The version of LHAZ should 
be 5.0.#.#, where the “#” represents some numeric value. Also shown will be an LTMC 
version number, most likely 3.#.#. The LTMC library is used by LHAZ to perform 
hazard calculations. It is basically the “smarts” behind LHAZ and is used in many 
AFRL/RHDO laser applications; as a consequence, it may be updated occasionally to 
include additional features that will not affect LHAZ. 

AFRL/RHDO may update the distribution CD and this will be given a “Release 
Number”. A given Release Number will have changes to the content of the distribution 
CD, and may include updated versions of LHAZ or LTMC. For details on any updates, 
contact the Optical Radiation Branch by telephone, e-mail, or their web site. See 
Appendix F for contact information.

4. CHANGE NOTES 

LHAZ has evolved through several iterations to provide more features and accurate analyses to 
our users. The early versions of LHAZ 3 were written as a DOS console application. LHAZ 4 
was written as a tabbed windows application. This newest incarnation of LHAZ is written as a 
plug-in to the AFRL/RHD Application Framework. 

4.1 SYNOPSIS OF CHANGES FROM LHAZ V4.4 TO V5.0 

This newest version of LHAZ is a complete reengineering of the LHAZ application. It 
implements the new American National Standard for Safe Use of Lasers (ANSI Z136.1-2007)'. 

It also incorporates the AFRL/RHD Application Framework, leveraging the Framework to 
provide a common, powerful user interface for multiple analyses. The design of LHAZ 5 is 
meant to aid the user in seeing more analyses at one time, and is more robust, allowing additional 
analyses or parameters. 

Changes between earlier versions of LHAZ are listed in Appendix G .

5. PROPERTIES AND ANALYSIS WINDOWS 

There are three Analysis Windows that can be opened in LHAZ. These can all be accessed via 
the menu “Analysis LHAZ”. These three analysis windows correspond to the three tabbed 
analysis panes of LHAZ 4 of the same name. Each of these windows shows the results of 
various analyses. As with any plugin for the Application Framework, making an analysis 
window active will cause all of the properties relevant that window’s analyses to be shown in the 
Property Grid. This design allows for each analysis window to take up less screen real estate 
than before. This means that more can be shown on the analysis window, and also that multiple 
analysis windows can be placed on the framework’s “desktop”. The analysis windows often 
share some of the same properties, like the laser parameters. This means that the user can see the 
effects of changes to a specific parameter across multiple analysis windows. There may even be 
plug-ins in the future that share properties. 

5.1 PROPERTIES 

5.1.1 General Property Notes 

Properties are organized into categories in the properties grid, which can each be expanded. 
These categories are: 

• Exposure Parameters 

• Laser 

• Reflection Exposure Parameters (Only for the Reflections Analysis Window) 

There are times when some properties are hidden because they are not applicable, due to the 
value of some other property. One example would be that the “Energy per Pulse” property is not 
visible when the user has chosen “CW” (for continuous wave) for the “Pulse Mode” property.

Using the Standard ANSI Defined Range or the User Defined Range 

The ANSI standard 1 recommends values for many of the properties based on the values of other 
properties (like wavelength or the existence of aided viewing). For properties where there is an 
ANSI 1 recommendation, there is typically another property just above it that allows the user to 
choose between “Standard” and “UserDefmed”. The default, Standard, will cause the actual 
property to be grayed out. The property will always be updated to reflect the ANSI standard 1 
recommended value based on the other properties. If “User Defmed” is selected, the 
corresponding property will be enabled, allowing the user to edit the value.

The “Optical_Transmissivity” uses the ANSI standard default. 

Some properties, like “OpticalTransmissivity”, may be entered as a percentage, like “90%”, or 
as a multiplier value, like “0.90”. Many of the properties may be entered in units that relate to 
the property. For these kinds of properties, a drop-down window on the property provides the 
available conversions, or the user can type the value with the units. If a value is typed without

EXAMPLE: Your laser has a pulse width of 20 x 10~ 9 s. You could enter this value in many different 
ways, and LHAZ would still recognize it. You could enter “20 ns”, or “0.02 us”. LHAZ also 
recognizes scientific and engineering notations, such as “20e-9 ”, “20E-09 ”, or “2.0E-8”. Distance 
and length fields are treated in a similar manner; “km” refers to kilometers, “mm” refers to 
millimeters, etc. Other examples include kilohertz (“kHz”), milliseconds (“ms”), nanometers 
(“nm ”), and micrometers (“um ”). Note that you cannot place a comma in a number entry field. 

The following sections list all of the properties to be found in LHAZ, along with which category 
they belong to, description, valid ranges, default values, and how the properties depend on each 
other.

The OD specifies on a logarithmic scale the amount that the laser power or energy is 
reduced. For example, a laser operator may be wearing LEP with an OD of 3.0 at the 
wavelength of the laser. This LEP is reducing the potential exposure to the laser by a 
factor of 1,000. LHAZ will compute the NOHD and (additional) OD requirements for 
the exposure conditions supplied.

Default Value: Vacuum, no attenuation 

Range & Exceptions:

Description: The visibility conditions at 100 km. An option also exists for user 

defined attenuation and military standard for visible ground to ground scenarios. 


Atmospheric attenuation can also be specified. The reduction of laser exposure at long distances 
can be significant even when visibility is good. LHAZ is limited to constant atmospheric 
attenuation coefficient, which exponentially reduces exposure as a function of distance. More 
advanced models may be required for high-energy lasers which are directed above the 
atmosphere. The user may select the Visibility Conditions from a pull-down menu, and the 
recommended atmospheric attenuation will be computed based upon the visibility and the 
wavelength of the laser. If this value is not appropriate in the opinion of the LSO, the value may 
be over-ridden by using the “User Defined” option and typing in the desired attenuation 
coefficient in the Atmospheric Attenuation property.

The range from laser to reflected target. 


LHAZ assumes that the laser is hitting the surface at normal incidence for its analysis of 
hazards. The Laser to Target Range is the distance measured from the output aperture of 
the laser to the reflecting target. Note that this distance can be important because the 
beam may be attenuated by the atmosphere, and the beam diameter at the target will be 
influenced. 


Target to Observer Range 

Category: Reflection Exposure Parameters 

Type & Units: Distance (mm, cm, in, ft, yd, m) 

Default Value: 100 cm 

Range & Exceptions: > 0 

Dependencies: none 

Description: The range from reflected target to the observer. 

As part of the diffuse reflection hazard assessment geometry, the user can specify a 
distance from the reflecting target to the viewer. The OD requirement value is computed 
based upon this distance. Therefore, any distance smaller than the computed NHZ will 
generally produce an OD requirement greater than zero. Also, the atmospheric 
attenuation will apply to this target to viewer range as well as the laser to target distance 
that the beam traverses.

The user can also set the target reflectance coefficient. A reflectance coefficient with 
values of zero (no reflectance) to one (maximum of 100% reflectance) can be assigned if 
known for the target material. Otherwise, the reflectance should be left at 100% as a 
worst-case analysis. Appendix B provides typical reflectance values for common 
materials.

Description: The viewing angle offset in degrees. 0 deg is the worst case, in line 

with the laser, which is perpendicular to the reflector. 90 degrees is completely orthogonal to the beam. 

The angle from normal incidence at which the reflection is being viewed can also be 
specified. The angle should be left at zero degrees if the viewing geometry is unknown. 
This will provide the worst-case NHZ and OD requirements for the diffuse reflection 
exposure. LHAZ assumes that the laser is hitting the surface at normal incidence for its 
analysis of diffuse reflection hazards. Note that this value is not used for specular 
reflection hazard assessments. 


5.2 ANALYSIS WINDOWS 

5.2.1 MPE & Classification Analysis Window 

Since this version of LHAZ is a plug-in for the AFRL/RHD Application Framework, the user has 
more access to the laser parameters than he had with LHAZ 4. Another difference is that each 
Analysis Window does not need to be the same size as the others. In LHAZ 4, each tab on the 
tabbed pane took up the same amount of screen real-estate as the others. We can make our 
analysis windows be more concise and small, so that several analysis windows might potentially 
be placed on the screen at the same time, along with all of the available relevant parameters. 

The MPE and Classification tab in LHAZ 4.x showed 4 columns representing different potential 
exposure durations, and eight rows. Many of these rows did not make sense with the columns 
that were available (e.g. MPE for skin shown in the column representing the recommended 
exposure duration for ocular exposures). This data filled the tab, but the amount of information 
displaced overwhelmed most users. In LHAZ 5, the user can specify a user-defined exposure 
duration for eye exposures, or can easily adopt the standard exposure the ANSI 1 recommends. 

He may also specify a different exposure for diffuse/skin exposures, or use the ANSI 1 
recommended value.

5.2.3 Reflections Analysis Window 

LHAZ 5 provides for the placement of both the laser and target in the diffuse reflection hazard 
assessment geometry. Also included are differing exposure times from the direct beam exposure 
hazard analysis. An explanation of diffuse reflection hazard assessments can be found in Section 
7. The reflection hazard assessment worksheet is illustrated below. The LHAZ 5 version of this 
Analysis Window shows the results of diffuse and specular calculations simultaneously. A 
diffuse reflection analysis assumes an ideal, lambertian reflector, while a specular reflection 
analysis assumes a flat mirror-like surface. There are a number of properties available for the 
reflection hazard analysis. Some of these properties are common to all hazard analysis, while 
some exposure parameters are specific to reflections. For the purposes of LHAZ, we have 
termed the hazard distance due to a diffuse or specular reflection the Nominal Hazard Zone. The 
distance is measured from the reflecting surface.

7. COMPUTATION METHODS 

LHAZ 5 executes many calculations in order to arrive at a complete set of hazard analysis 
results. The following sections explain the fundamentals of the calculations performed in each 
analysis window and the assumptions behind the results. For the purposes of much of the 
discussion presented here, we will work with a gaussian profile, circularly symmetric beam so 
that the example computations can be compared with tractable hand calculations. 

7.1 LASER PARAMETERS AND BEAM PROPAGATION 

The laser parameters group of the properties grid allows the user to enter all parameters related to 
the laser that are necessary to complete a laser hazard analysis. These parameters describe the 
amount of energy or power output from the laser, and the geometry with which the beam will 
propagate when it exits the laser. The laser parameters are illustrated in Figure 1.. Parameter 
definitions can be found in Appendix E . 

7.1.1 Beam Geometry 



Figure 1: Laser Beam Propagation Geometry Assumed for LHAZ. 


Figure 1 demonstrates the beam geometry assumed for intra-beam computations with LHAZ. 
This is the recommended geometry according to the ANSI Z 136.1 Standard 1 . The beam is 
assumed to expand from a minimum beam diameter, or waist, according to a hyperbolic 
function. The beam diameter as a function of range along each of perpendicular, major and 
minor axes is described by Equation 1. Note that the beam waist position is not necessarily 
located at the output aperture of the laser, and that there may be differing beam waist diameters, 
divergences, and aperture to waist distance for each axis. Beam diameter and divergence values 
must be specified at the 1/e intensity points of the gaussian distribution.

Equation 1 


The concept of extended sources is a bit more difficult to include and understand in the laser 
hazard analysis process. Basically, some laser sources when viewed appear to emit over a large 
area and not simply a small point. An example of an extended source emitter is an array of diode 
lasers closely assembled to form what appears to be a large slab of laser emission. Typically, 
this light cannot be focused to a small point on the retina, but will create an image that has a 
certain angular extent. Figure 2 illustrates an extended source image being formed on the retina. 



Figure 2: An extended source laser forming an image on the retina. The symbol alpha is 
used to denote the angle subtended by the laser source. 


The Source Size value entered in LHAZ can have two distinct modes: a constant diameter or a 
constant angle subtended in the observer’s vision. The mode for the extended source is 
determined by the units selected for the value. If the dimensions are specified in cm, then the 
source is assumed to have a constant diameter, and the visual angle subtended (a) can be 



approximated by r 

Equation 2. On the other hand, if the dimensions are specified in mrad, the source is assumed to 
subtend a constant visual angle until it reaches the diameter specified by the Aperture Diam 



value. At distances beyond this point, the visual angle subtended is given using

Equation 2 with D s replaced by the laser output aperture diameter, 5 . Note that the laser aperture 
diameter has no impact on the evaluation unless a constant angular (in mrad) source size is 
specified.

Equation 2 


7.1.2 Pulse Mode and Pulse Parameters 

Laser output is assumed to be single pulse, multi-pulse, or CW. Pulsed laser output energy (go) 
is specified in joules per pulse, and CW output power (Of is specified in watts. Although the 
CW and single pulse laser outputs are self explanatory, the multi-pulse is subject to a few 
constraints. The multi-pulse laser hazard evaluation is limited to laser output of constant pulse 
repetition frequency (F), and a constant pulse duration (t) in seconds and constant energy in 
joules (J). This allows for the average output power of the laser to be related to the energy per 

pulse by ~ Qo ‘ F 

Equation 3. 


= Q° F 

Equation 3 


When conducting a multi-pulse laser hazard analysis, the average power should be computed and 
displayed in the “grayed” Average Power input field. 

7.1.3 Beam Profile and Distribution 

Three beam profile shapes and two cross-sectional distributions can be selected within LHAZ. 
These values allow the user to accurately depict commonly occurring beam profile shapes. The 
user should select the combination of profile and distribution that most accurately mimics that 
seen from the laser emitter. 

Note that when elliptical or rectangular Beam Profile shapes are selected, the Beam Geometry 
group allows for values to be entered along both an X and Y-axis. Note that diameter values 
should be assembled such that all values along one axis are entered together. 

Figure 3 depicts several measured beam profile shapes, which illustrate the values that may be 
selected in LHAZ. The images are labeled to allow the user to select the one that most closely 
represents the laser system being evaluated.

7.2 MPE CALCULATIONS AND CLASSIFICATION 

LHAZ calculates the small source, extended source, and skin MPEs for CW, single-pulse, and 
multiple-pulse lasers. Additionally, it classifies the hazard potential of the laser according to the 
ANSI Z 136.1 classification 1 guidelines. 

7.2.1 MPE Calculations 

The computation of the Maximum Permissible Exposure can depend on nearly all parameters on 
the Laser Parameter Worksheet. In most instances, the MPE will depend on wavelength of the 
laser, the source size (extended sources), and the pulse properties. In several wavelength ranges, 
the MPE will depend upon the beam diameter, and therefore the range at which the exposure is 
evaluated. These laser parameters are also important in the computation of MPE values for 
diffuse reflections that are often extended sources. 

MPE computations are conducted according the ANSI Z136.1 Standard 1 . The most important 
section to review in order to accurately compute MPE values is Section 8 of the Standard 1 . 

50 

Distribution A, APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE; DISTRIBUTION UNLIMITED. 























ANSI Z136.1 Table 5a 1 and Table 5b 1 provide MPE values for ocular exposures from small 
sources and extended sources, respectively. ANSI Z 136.1 Table 6 1 provides a number of 
correction factors required as intermediate steps in the computation of MPE values. ANSI 
Z 136.1 Table 7 1 lists MPE values for skin exposures. A number of example MPE computations 
can also be found in Appendix B 1 of the ANSI Z 136.1 Standard 1 . 

Limiting Aperture Diameter, commonly represented by the symbol Df, defines the circular area 
over which laser power or energy is averaged for the purpose of laser hazard analysis. LHAZ 
uses this limiting aperture to compute the number of watts or joules of exposure present, and 
compares them with the value of the Class 1 AEL to determine hazard distances and optical 
density requirements. Note that determination of the limiting aperture diameter for a multi-pulse 
hazard assessment can be tricky, and the reader is encouraged to read a recent paper on the 
subject. 

The fourth value, the Class 1 AEL is a convenient value for comparisons of exposure limits to 
measurements, and is used in the determination of the Classification of the laser system. The 
Class 1 AEL is computed using Equation 4 and is equivalent to the MPE multiplied by the area 
of the limiting aperture. 


n-D) 

AEL C _, = MPE —P 


Equation 4 

The fifth row in the MPE and AEL group is the limiting aperture diameter for skin exposures. 
This is followed by the MPE for skin exposures. The skin exposure MPE is computed using 
Table 7 of the ANSI Z136.1 Standard 1 . 

It is beyond the scope of this manual to provide detailed procedures and associated equations for 
the accurate determination of MPE values in all situations. The user of LHAZ is assumed to be 
relatively experienced in laser safety. However, if a difficult computation arises or if an 
interpretation of the ANSI Z136 Standard 1 is required, the user should feel free to contact the 
Optical Radiation Safety Team using the contact information listed in Appendix F . We have in 
many cases assembled detailed tutorials on a number of specific topics such as multiple pulse 
laser hazard assessment and extended source MPE computation. 

7.2.2 Laser Classification 

The hazard class of a laser system determines required administrative and engineering control 
measures. Therefore, a critical step in hazard assessment is the assignment of the proper laser 
hazard classification. The laser hazard classification will determine not only the level of concern 
for user safety, but could also have a financial impact on manufacturing, installation, and field 
use of the laser. For example, a Class 3B 1 laser system may require that users have an eye exam 
as part of the administrative control measures, while a Class 3R 1 laser system may not. This can 
be a significant financial burden in large organizations such as the military, which requires these 
eye exams. A second example would be the additional engineering control measure of interlocks 
on protective housings for Class 3B 1 or Class 4 1 lasers. 


51 

Distribution A, APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE; DISTRIBUTION UNLIMITED. 




Section 3 of the ANSI Z136.1 standard 1 contains AELs for each of the primary laser 
classifications - 1 through 4. The Class 1 laser is the least hazardous, the Class 4 laser most 
dangerous. The ANSI Z136.1 standard 1 also includes selected examples directly relevant to laser 
classification in Appendix B, Section B4. 

The classification scheme established by the ANSI Z 136.1 standard 1 is based upon the laser 
beam’s capability to injure personnel. This capability to cause injury is determined through a 
comparison of the “Accessible Emission” or “Accessible Radiation” from the laser to an 
established limit for each class. If the limit is exceeded, the laser falls into at least the next more 
hazardous class. Each of these limits is therefore termed an “Accessible Emission Limit” or 
AEL. 

Four primary laser classes are used to separate the capability of lasers to cause injury into easily 
discemable categories. Both administrative and engineering control measures have been 
established commensurate with the hazards of each category. Section 4 of ANSI Z136.1 
Standard 1 contains detailed recommendations and requirements for these control measures for 
each class of laser, with a summary provided in Table 10 1 . 

Laser Classification procedures have changed in LHAZ 5.0 to reflect changes in the ANSI 
Z 136.1 Standard 1 . The updated classification procedure is described in Appendix C . 

Note that the updated classification procedure uses ranges for both Condition 1 (aided viewing 
possible) and Condition 2 (unaided viewing). LHAZ 5.0 computes default value for both of 
these. Currently, the user overrides the default value of one of these using the Eye Range 
property. The user may provide a user-defined value for this, or accept the value computed 
(based on the Eye Exp. Duration property). If the Use Aided Viewing property is True, then this 
value is used in place of the default Condition 1 range. If it is False, then it is used in place of 
the default Condition 2 range.

7.3.1 NOHD Computations 

The method for computing intra-beam NOHD values within LHAZ involves the computation of 
power or energy transmitted by the limiting aperture as a function of range and determining the 
point at which the exposure drops below the MPE. The method is outlined in Example 39 of the 
ANSI Z136.1 Standard 1 . For example, a circular-gaussian beam profile, the power or energy 
transmitted by an aperture of diameter D/ is given by Equation 5 and Equation 6.

Equation 6 

Equation 5 and Equation 6 can each be solved for r, with the appropriate &mpe or Qmpe 
substituted for tfyand Qf to obtain the hazard distance. Solving for r, and labeling this range as 
r H D, we obtain Equations 12a and 12b for CW and pulsed lasers respectively. 




Equation 8 


Equation 7 and Equation 8 work very well, although they initially seem rather complex. They 
compare the MPE directly to the energy or power transmitted by the limiting aperture, and do not 
suffer from special averaging problems for small beams. Note that Equation 7 and Equation 8 
apply only to circular gaussian profile beams, and must be re-derived for other beam profile 
models. These equations and methods are beyond the scope of this manual. 

7.3.2 Optical Density Computations 

The optical density (D>.) is an expression of the logarithm of the reciprocal of the transmittance 
( Tx) of an optical element. An equation for this definition is given below. 

„ , 1 

Ai = logio — 

Equation 9 

In order to determine the optical density requirement for a given laser exposure, our goal is to 
choose a transmittance of laser power or laser pulse energy through our limiting aperture that 
allows an amount of energy equal to the MPE in terms of power or energy to pass through the 
filter and limiting aperture combined. Since transmittance is simply the ratio of “power out” to 
“power in” we can state this as shown in Equation 10 and Equation 11.

These apply to CW and pulsed lasers, respectively. Replacing transmittance (x^) in our

CW and pulsed lasers, respectively. Note that the notation Ompe is shorthand for the AEL in 
terms of power.

Also note that Of and (9/can be computed at any range by incorporating the beam diameter at 
that range. In order to determine optical density requirements at range for a given laser, a model 
for the propagation of the beam must be specified. LHAZ determines Qf and Of for the 
exposure in question. As an example, for a circular gaussian beam distribution, Equation 5 and 
Equation 6 can be used. 

LHAZ 4 also provides a value labeled Maximum under the OD values. This value is computed 
by substituting the power or energy of the laser for Of or Qf. The value is corrected only for 
atmospheric loss and transmittance of any optics used for aided viewing. 

7.3.3 Atmospheric Attenuation 

Atmospheric attenuation is incorporated in LHAZ computations by using the common 
approximation of Beer’s Law in which //, an atmospheric attenuation coefficient (in cm' 1 ) is used 
to describe an exponential decay of the power or energy transmitted by the atmosphere as a 
function of range, r. The equations below describe the relationship in terms of power or energy.

Equation 15 


Note that these equations are applied to any distance that the beam propagates, including 
distances from diffuse reflectors to the viewers. 

7.3.4 Optically Aided Viewing 

When optical viewing aides such as binoculars or telescopes are used to view the laser from 
within the beam (intra-beam viewing), the hazard is increased by as much as the square of the 
magnifying power. The addition of optics, which will typically collect light over a much larger 
aperture than the naked eye, can significantly increase optical density requirements and hazard 
distances. The transmittance of the optical device must also be included, as they may attenuate 
the beam significantly. Most optics will transmit light effectively in the visible and near-infrared 
portions of the spectrum. Nominal values for the transmittance of optical viewing aids have been 
provided in the ANSI Z 136.1 Standard 1 in Table 9 1 and are default values for LHAZ. Figure 4 
illustrates the basic parameters associated with an optical viewing aid. 



Figure 4: Parameters associated with aided viewing hazard analyses. 


The Gain (G) of an optical system is the ratio of the radiant exposure or irradiance at the cornea 
when viewing is aided by an optical system. It is defined by Equation 16 below. 


G = 


f D ^ 
2_o 

vAy 


= P 2 


Equation 16 


Commonly, 7x50 binoculars have a power of 7.0 and an exit port diameter slightly larger than 
7.0 mm. The gain for these optics is therefore approximately 49. This gain factor represents the 
maximum increased hazard from a laser beam due to the concentration of power or energy by the 
optical device. 


The gain factor (G) alone does not account for all of the internal transmittance losses in the 
optical system. All optical systems transmit some amount less than 100%. A transmittance 


56 

Distribution A, APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE; DISTRIBUTION UNLIMITED. 






value assigned the symbol x^, is used to correct the gain of the system and is multiplied by G. 
The subscript X emphasizes that the transmittance will be a function of laser wavelength. 

When viewing laser sources at closer distances, the laser beam diameter (Dl) may be less than 
the diameter of the collection optic (Do). Also, optical devices with a power greater than seven 
often have an exit port diameter (D e ) that is less than 7-mm in diameter. In order to account for 
the amount of light collected and to be applied to a hazard analysis, a “collecting aperture” with 
diameter D c is defined as the minimum of the entrance diameter of the optics and the optical 
power multiplied by the exit aperture diameter (De). 

D c =min (d o ,PxD € ) 

Equation 17 

This collection aperture can be used to define an “effective gain” when coupled with the 
transmittance of the optical instrument and the minimum of the two values D c and D L are used 
for Do in Equation 16. 


'eff 



Equation 18 


It is important to remember the definition of effective gain. The effective gain is a multiplicative 
factor representing the increase or (or possible decrease if x^ is small) in the effective irradiance 
or radiant exposure that is incident on the limiting aperture. 


The derivation of equations for the NOHD and optical density requirements when optical aids 
are present requires the computation of an effective collection aperture. Also, the transmittance 
of the optics must be taken into account. 


In order to account for the amount of light collected and to be applied to a hazard analysis, a 
collecting aperture with diameter Dk is defined as the minimum of the entrance diameter of the 
optics and the optical power multiplied by the minimum of the limiting aperture diameter (Dj) 
and the exit aperture diameter ( D e ). The extra step of considering the limiting aperture diameter 
is included because in some cases the limiting aperture diameter will be less than the exit 
aperture of the optical device. 


D k = min(D 0 , P x min[D t ,, D f ] ) 

Equation 19 

This aperture diameter ( Dk ) is then used in place of D/in Equation 5 and Equation 6 and in the 
derivation of Equation 7 and Equation 8. It is the effective collection aperture diameter for the 
purposes of determining the energy or power to be compared to Of or Qf. The total energy or 
total power is also multiplied by a factor of tx to compensate for the transmittance of the optics. 


57

Completion of the derivations yields equations for the optical density as a function of range, and 
forNOHD. 


Combining the effects of aided viewing and atmospheric transmittance, we can derive equations 
for the NOHD. Again, for a circular, gaussian profile beam Equation 20 and Equation 21 give 
the result that LHAZ will use. Note that these equations include vhd on both the right and left- 
hand side of the equation. This is because the vrd cannot be isolated algebraically. This type of 
equation is known as a transcendental equation, and must be solved numerically. Fortunately, 
this type of equation can be solved quickly by a computer, and numerical methods for doing so 
have been implemented in LHAZ, making the extensive work transparent to the user.

7.4 DIFFUSE/SPECULAR REFLECTION HAZARD ANALYSIS 

The changes in LHAZ from version 3.0 to 4.2 have included additional parameters for the 
analysis of diffuse reflection hazards. The user can now specifically indicate the exposure time 
for the diffuse reflection hazard assessment, with values recommended from the ANSI standard 1 
provided. Also, the distance from the laser to the target, and the distance from the viewer to the 
target can be specified. The target reflectance can be specified. Aided viewing effects are 
accurately incorporated. 

The Z 136.1 standard contains several revisions for extended source hazard assessments. These 
have increased the complexity of the extended source hazard assessment, which commonly 
comes into play for diffuse reflection hazard assessment. LHAZ 4.0 and 4.2 have incorporated 
these changes, and provides the user with an up-to-date hazard analysis tool. 

In addition to diffuse reflection hazard analysis, LHAZ also provides for the computation of a 
limited specular reflection analysis. This analysis is limited to planar specular reflectors, which 
are assumed to be larger in diameter than the laser beam. 

7.4.1 Diffuse Reflection Analysis Geometry 

The beam propagation and reflection geometry for diffuse reflection hazard analysis is illustrated 
in Figure 5. The laser beam is assumed to be incident on the diffusely-reflecting surface at a 
right-angle to the plane of the surface, or normal incidence. The laser beam propagates from the 
output aperture of the laser to the target, and may lose energy or power due to atmospheric 
transmission losses. The observer is assumed to be positioned at a distance v\ from the reflecting 
target, at an angle @ v as measured between the laser beam and the line from the center of the 
laser beam on the target. The beam diameter at the target is assigned the symbol D p . The target 
reflectance is given a value of between zero and one and is labeled p.

7.4.2 Diffuse Reflection Exposures 

Within LHAZ, diffuse reflections are modeled according to Lambert’s Law. This assumes that 
the diffusely reflecting surface is an ideal diffuse reflector and the Irradiance or radiant exposure 
at the observer’s location can be modeled according to Equation 24 or Equation 25, respectively.

Equation 25 


The MPE for a diffuse reflection must often be modeled as an extended source, as the entire 
illuminated surface becomes an emitter of laser energy. The angle subtended by this diffuse 
reflection can be approximated by Equation 26 for small angles. When combined with the 
exposure duration and wavelength, MPE values for diffuse reflections can often be functions of 
radiance, which must also be computed for the diffusely reflecting source.

Equation 26 


7.4.3 Diffuse Reflection Nominal Hazard Zone 

By substitution of the MPE for the exposure in Equation 24 and Equation 25, and solving for rj, 
a basic equation for the hazard distance from a diffuse reflection can be derived. The result is 
Equation 27, shown below.

Equation 27 

The difficulty with Equation 27 is that the MPE may be a function of the visual angle subtended 
(a), and depending upon the value of a, different MPE equations may apply. For example, 
examination of Table 5b 1 of the ANSI standard 1 reveals that the correction factor Ce applies to 
any source subtending an angle of greater than 1.5 mrad for laser wavelengths that are in the 
retinal hazard region of 400 to 1400 nm. 

LHAZ addresses this problem through a numerical solution. Knowing that the worst-case hazard 
distance is achieved by assuming that the MPE is a small source (a < 1.5 mrad), the NHZ is 
estimated using Equation 27 with an MPE value from Table 5a. LHAZ then uses a numerical 
procedure to determine the hazard distance iteratively by testing extended source MPE values at 
various ranges. 

Note that LHAZ will apply the atmospheric attenuation coefficient to the laser energy that is 
scattered from the diffuse reflector. This creates yet another reason for numerical solution as the 
equation is transcendental, as is seen for intra-beam NOHD computations. 

The hazard distance for the diffuse reflection is labeled as an NHZ, in order to differentiate the 
hazard distance from that of an intra-beam exposure. 

7.4.4 Diffuse Reflection Optical Density Requirements 

The optical density computation for a diffuse reflection is much more straight-forward. Because 
the exposure distance is pre-determined, the MPE can be computed for the reflection even if it is 
an extended source. The exposure in W/cm or J/cm can be compared with this MPE and the 
OD requirement can be computed using Equation 28 or Equation 29.

For these two equations the value of E 0 b s or H 0 i, s can be computed using Equation 24 or Equation 
25 for CW and pulsed laser analysis, respectively. 


7.4.5 Notes on Aided Viewing of Diffuse Reflections 

LHAZ also includes the option of including optical viewing aids in the performance of diffuse 
reflection hazard analyses. For these computations, the viewing aid is assumed to increase the 
amount of laser energy collected by a multiplicative factor equal to the effective gain for the 


61 

Distribution A, APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE; DISTRIBUTION UNLIMITED. 



system, as given by Equation 18. Note that this equation includes the losses due to the optical 
transmittance of the viewing aid. Also, the visual angle a, subtended by the diffuse reflection is 
assumed to increase proportionally to the magnification specified for the optics. 

7.4.6 Specular Reflection Analysis 

The analysis geometry for specular reflections is illustrated in Figure 6. The analysis is identical 
to that described for intra-beam NOHD and OD values in section 5.3, with two minor exceptions. 

• The laser beam is attenuated through multiplication by the target reflectance 
coefficient, p. 

• The hazard distance is computed as the farthest range from the target for which 
the MPE is not exceeded. 

• The optical density requirement is computed based upon the beam diameter at a 
net range of (r+ri).

APPENDIX A EXAMPLES 


In this section, a few detailed examples are presented that illustrate the analysis process 
used in laser safety, and shows how LHAZ can be used to simplify this process. Section A 
of each example presents a “by hand” analysis, and section B illustrates how to do the same 
analysis using LHAZ. 

NOTE: This is not a tutorial in laser safety analysis. It is assumed the reader is familiar 
with the topic. For those not familiar, numerous examples of laser safety analyses can be 
found in Appendix B of ANSI Z136.1 standard. It is also assumed that the reader has read 
the LHAZ manual and is familiar with the operation of the software.

MPE 


The MPE for a multiple-pulse exposure is computed using the “Three-Rule” 
method described in the ANSI Z 136.1 Standard. The relevant parameters and steps 
are shown below. 


Rule 1: Single Pulse MPE 

a. The pulse duration ( t ) is 16-ns (16 x 10' 9 sec). 

b. For a 16-ns, 1064-nm pulse, we find in Table 5a and Table 6 of the ANSI 
Standard:

MPE :H = 5.0xC c x 10" 6 J ■ cm' 2 
C c = 1.0 

c. This is the single pulse MPE and is expressed in J cm' , so we label it MPEi 

MPE X = 5.0xl0“ 6 /-cm“ 2 

d. The limiting aperture for a 1064 nm, 16-ns ocular exposure found in Table 8 
is 

D f = 7.0 mm 

e. The value of Qmpe-i is computed using MPEi and the limiting aperture.

Qmpe-\ =1-92x10“ 6 J 
Rule 2: Average Power MPE 

a. The recommended total exposure time ( T) for an inadvertent exposure to a 
1064-nm laser is 10 seconds from Table 4a. We choose this value because 
the exposure is specified as T max in the problem statement. 

b. The MPE for a 10-second exposure to a 1064 nm laser from Table 5a and 
Table 6 of the ANSI Standard is (note convention of time interval). 

MPE :£ = 5.0xC c x 10" 3 IT • cm" 2 
MPE : £ = 5.0x l.Ox 10“ 3 ir • cm~ 2 
MPE : E = 5.0x 10“ 3 ir -cm~ 2 
Labeling this MPEcw, we have 

MPE CW =5.0xl0" 3 IE-cm" 2

c. For a 10-second exposure, MPEcw can be converted to a radiant exposure as 
MPE : H = (MPE :E)T 


MPE : H = 5.0 x 10 -3 W ■ cm~ 2 x 10 sec 


MPE :H = 5.0x\0~ 2 J ■ cm~ 


MPE CW =5.0x10 J -cm~ 


d. We must compute n from the equation given for the special case since the 
wavelength is 1064 nm. Here T 2 = 10 sec, because we have a small source 
laser. 

n = F ■ min (T , T 2 ) 
n = (20 Hz ■ lOs) 
n = 200 

e. Now we compute the MPE per pulse for the repetitively pulsed laser. 

MPE , = MPE cw 


MPE 2 = 


5.0x\0 2 J-cm 2 


MPE 2 =250x\0~ 6 J-cm 2 

f. The limiting aperture diameter for a 10-second, 1064-nm exposure is found 
from Table 8 of the ANSI Standard to be 

D t = 7.0 mm 

g. The value of Qmpe for the pulse group, Qmpe-2 is next computed.

We must determine n e ff, k, and MPEtsp- 

b. Since t min = 50 x 10" 6 sec for 1064 nm, and our pulse duration has the value t 
= 16 x 10' 9 sec, we use the case 2.a. ( t < t min ) and MPE T sp is the MPE for 

t = 1 ns. From Table 5a and Table 6 (noting our conventions for time 
intervals with t = 1 ns), we obtain 

MPE : H = 5.0 x C c x 10' 6 J ■ cm~ 2 

C c = 1.0 

MPE :H = 5.0x\0~ 6 J ■ cm" 2 
MPE tsp =5.0x10 ~ 6 J-cm~ 2 

c. To determine k and n e /f, we use the procedure listed in the text above and 
first get k, the number of pulses that occur within t mm . 

k = F ■ min(t min , T) 

k = F-min(50x\0- 6 s,\0s) 

k = 20Hz-50xl0~ 6 s 

k = lxlO -3 

Which is rounded up to the next whole number so that 

k = 1 

We then determine n, the number of pulses that occur within time T. Note 
that a special case applies (use minimum of T and T£) because the 
wavelength is 1064 nm, and we also note that for a small source, T 2 is 10 
sec, the same as our exposure time, T. 

n = F -min(r,r 2 ) 

n - 20 Hz-10 s 

n = 200 

Since k= 1, we find from (3.c.) n e /f= n. 

n eff = 200

there is no need to compute 0/for comparisons. We can select the smallest 
MPE to be used in all subsequent hazard analyses. In this case, MPE 3 is the 
applicable MPE. Our final set of parameters to use in these analyses is

The determination of MPE values can immediately be completed by viewing the 
MPE and Classification worksheet. The Range is set to 20 cm by the user, as 
specified by the problem statement. The User Defined Exposure Duration column 
indicates that the MPE for a 10.0 second exposure will be 1.330e-006 J/cm 2 in 
excellent agreement with the hand-computed value of 1.33 x 10" 6 J/cm 2 .

The NOHD value is found on the NOHD and OD worksheet. The exposure 
duration for the eye is confirmed to be 10 seconds. The atmospheric attenuation 
coefficient is set to zero, in accordance with the problem statement. The resulting 
NOHD is 6.92 x 10 5 cm for unaided viewing, in excellent agreement with the hand- 
computed value of 6.9 x 10 5 cm. 

OD 

The OD value is also computed on the NOHD and OD worksheet. In addition to 
the settings for the NOHD, Range and Skin Range are set to 20 cm. The resulting 
OD is computed by LHAZ to be 5.58 cm for unaided viewing, in excellent 
agreement with the hand-computed value of 5.6.

The question next is: Is the beam spot on the target considered a small source (a 

less than 1.5 mrad) from a distance of 1.0 m. We apply ^

The resulting angle of 1.1 mrad means that the small source MPE does apply and 
our NHZ is 93.7 cm.

For a target-to-viewer range of 50cm, we must first determine the MPE for a source 
size determined using Equation 26. From our NHZ computation, we know that the 
beam diameter on the target is 0.1 cm.

Of these two values, the “Thermal” MPE is the smaller, and so it is applied to the 
computation of the optical density requirement. The value of the optical density

B. LHAZ Results 
Intra-beam MPE (0.25 s) 

The MPE for a CW small source exposure is relatively simple to determine using 
the MPE and Classification Worksheet after entering our laser parameters into the 
Laser Parameter worksheet of LHAZ. We obtain a small-source MPE of 2.598 x 
10' W cm' . This is in good agreement with the value of 2.56 x 10' W cm' 
computed by hand. We note that the small discrepancy is due to two factors: 
rounding errors in our hand computations and the fact that LHAZ uses a non- 
rounded coefficient of 1.837380237 in the MPE computation, instead of the 1.8 
prefix found in Table 5a of the ANSI Standard. 

Intra-beam QD 


The intra-beam OD requirement can be determined from the NOHD and OD 
worksheet. We verify that the viewing distance and exposure duration are correct 
and obtain an OD requirement of 3.70 OD. This agrees exactly with the value 
computed by hand of 3.70.

Diffuse Reflection NHZ 


The diffuse reflection NHZ for a 30,000 second exposure is determined using the 
Diffuse/Specular Reflections worksheet. The results for Example 2 are shown in 
Figure A4. The NHZ computed using LHAZ is 93.492cm, while the value 
computed by hand is 93.7cm, a good agreement.

Diffuse Reflection OD 


With LHAZ 4.2, the computation of this OD requirement for a target-to-viewer 
range of 50 cm is quite easy. We make sure that the target to viewer distance is set 
correctly along with other parameters. The resulting OD requirement for a 30,000- 
second exposure is 0.55. This result is in good agreement with the hand-computed 
value of 0.6. LHAZ values will typically be slightly smaller than those computed 
by hand, as LHAZ uses a slightly more accurate radiometric prediction of irradiance 
for a near-field exposure.

A. By Hand Results 

Since this is a CW laser, we will use the procedures that apply to CW lasers. 

1. To determine T max we note that no maximum exposure time is identified by the 
problem. We therefore apply the guidance of the ANSI Standard, and determine 
that T max = 30,000 seconds. 

2. The measurement aperture diameters (D m ) from Table 9 of the ANSI Standard are 
7.0 mm for Condition 2 and 50.0 mm for Condition 1. 

3. We next compute the Accessible Emission ( Q m ), which is the laser power or energy 
transmitted through the measurement aperture, for both Condition 1 (0„,i) and 
Condition 2 ( O m 2 ). Since we know that the beam diameter at the smallest point for 
an exposure is D L = 0.5 cm, we obtain

4. We next detennine from Tables 8a or 8b of the ANSI Standard that the limiting 
aperture diameter (D t ) for X = 0.532 pm and ocular exposure duration of t = 30,000 
s yields 

D f = 1.0 mm 

5. From Table 5a and 6 of the ANSI Standard, we determine that the MPE for our 
laser wavelength (X = 0.532 pm) and for an exposure time of T max = 30,000 s is 
given by 

MPE:E = \x\O^W-cm ^ 

6. We next compute the AEL from the MPE in Step 5 and the limiting aperture 
diameter in Step 4.

This is the Class 1 AEL for the laser. 

7. Since T max > 0.25 s in this problem and we have a visible laser (X = 0.532 pm), we 
compute the MPE for a 0.25-second exposure using Table 5a of the ANSI Standard.

9. Since our laser wavelength is 0.532 pm, we compute the Class 3R AEL as: 

Class 3 R AEL = 5 x Class 2 AEL 
Class 3 R AEL = 5 x 1 x 10 -3 W 

Class 3 R AEL = 4.9 x 10' 3 W 

10. We now determine the Class 3B AEL for the wavelength of the laser. Since our 
wavelength is 0.532 pm, we use the criteria: 

a) (400 nm < X < 1400 nm) An average power less than 500 mW (T > 0.25 
sec) and unable to produce more than 30 Ca mJ per pulse (for a single 
pulse). 

Since the laser is CW, we determine from the above statement that our Class 3B 
AEL is given by: 


Class 3 B AEL = 500m W 

Steps 11 - 13 determine if the laser is a Class 1 or 1M Laser (Class 1 AEL) 

11. We next compare the Class 1 AEL from Step 6 to & m i and 0 „2. 

<D ml = l.OxlO -3 W 
O m2 =8.59xl0“ 4 W 
Class 1 AEL = 3.85 xlO~ 4 W 

Since both 0 m i and 0„,2 > (Class 1 AEL), the laser is not Class 1 so we continue 
with Step 13.

Steps 13-14 determine if the laser is a Class 2 or 2M Laser (Class 2 AEL). Class 2 
specifications apply to visible lasers only (400 nm <A < 700 nm) 

13. We next compare the Class 2 AEL from Step 8 to &„,i and @„, 2 - 

O ml = l.OxlO -3 W 
O m2 = 8.59xl0 -4 W 

Class 2 AEL = 9.8x1 O' 4 IT 

Since & m i > (Class 2 AEL), we continue with Step 14. 

14. For visible wavelengths (400 nm < X < 700 nm), if O m2 < (Class 2 AEL), compare 
the Class 3B AEL from Step 10 to @ m i. 

O ml = l.OxlO -3 W 

Class 3 B AEL = 500 x 10 " 3 W 

Since & m i < (Class 3B AEL), the laser is Class 2M so we STOP.

Entry of the laser parameters into LHAZ, and viewing of the MPE and

A. By Hand Results 
Intra-beam MPE (0.25 s) 


The MPE for a CW extended source exposure requires the determination of source 
size. Since we have a constant-angle source, with a limiting diameter of the output 
aperture, we must determine the source size and if it over fills the output aperture. 
At a distance of 2 meters, the source diameter can be determined by Equation 2.

D s =a-r 

D s = 4.0 xlO 3 rad • 200 cm 
D s = 0.8 cm 

Since the diameter of the source is less than the diameter of the output aperture, we 
use the diameter of the source for our hazard analysis. The MPE must be 
determined from Table 5b of the ANSI Z1361.1 Standard as we have an extended 
source. For an exposure duration of only 0.25 seconds, there are no dual limits to 
compute as in Example 2.

is important to enter the source size on the Laser Parameters worksheet correctly, 
noting the source size entry in mrad. After entry of the 200 cm for Exposure 
Range, we obtain an Extended Source MPE of approximately 6.93 x 10 ' 3 W cm' 2 , in 
good agreement with the value computed by hand of 6.8 x 10 ' 3 W cm" 2 . This slight 
discrepancy is due primarily to the correction of rounding of the 1.8 in the MPE 
expression by the ANSI Standard to a value with more significant digits. 



Figure A6. MPE Results Summary for Example 4. 

Optical Density Requirement 

LHAZ quickly provides us with the OD requirement summary that we need by 
viewing the NOHD and OD worksheet. We set the Range for OD Requirement 
value to 200 cm, and obtain a value of 0.71. This is in good agreement with the 
value of 0.76 obtained by hand computations. Again, there is a slight discrepancy 
due to the rounding correction by LHAZ and rounding errors in our by-hand 
computation. Figure A7 illustrates the parameters entered and results obtained 
using LHAZ.

APPENDIX C CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURE 


C.l PROCEDURE FOR CW (AND SINGLE PULSE) LASER 
CLASSIFICATION 

2. Determine T max . Consider the maximum exposure time from the design of the laser 
in addition to the time for T max established in the ANSI Standard and summarized in 
the Evaluation Parameters section of this paper. The value of T max is established 
from the minimum of these two values. For single pulse lasers, T max is the duration 
of the pulse. If the pulse duration is > 0.25 s, the output is regarded as a CW laser. 

3. Determine the measurement aperture diameter ( D m ) from Table 9 of the ANSI 
Standard. Use the value of T max from Stepl, and the laser wavelength for this 
determination. The measurement aperture diameters for Condition 1 and Condition 
2 must both be considered for evaluation. 

4. Compute the accessible emission ( 0,„), which is the laser power transmitted through 
the measurement apertures, for both Condition 1 (0 m /) and Condition 2 ( & m 2 ), 
using Equation 5. For a single pulse, convert pulse energy to pulse power using 
Equation 8. The value of D L for Condition 2 is usually determined at the distance 
indicating the greatest hazard, but no closer than 10 cm from the closest point of 
human access. For Condition 1, determinations of hazards from optically aided 
viewing (i.e., telescopes and binoculars) should be made at the distance indicating 
the greatest hazard, but no closer than 200 cm from the laser exit port, for all 
wavelengths (0.302 to 2.8 pm) that transmit through common optics. 


97 

Distribution A, APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE; DISTRIBUTION UNLIMITED. 



5. Determine the limiting aperture diameter (Dj) for the wavelength of the laser and 
exposure duration of t = T max . Tables 8a and 8b of the ANSI Standard contain 
values of Df. 

6. For the wavelength of the laser, compute the MPE for the exposure time of T max . 
Use Table 5a or 5b of the ANSI Standard, depending upon which applies for the 
laser system. Table 6 contains supplementary information for computing the MPE. 

7. Compute the AEL from the MPE in Step 5 and the limiting aperture diameter in 
Step 4 using Equation 7. This is the Class 1 AEL for the laser. 

8. If the laser wavelength is 400 nm < X < 700 nm, compute the MPE for the exposure 
time of 0.25 s. Use Table 5a or 5b of the ANSI Standard, depending upon which 
applies for the laser system. Table 6 contains supplementary information for 
computing the MPE. Note that there are no single pulse Class 2 lasers, with t < 

0.25 s 

9. For visible wavelengths, compute the AEL from the MPE in Step 7 and the limiting 
aperture diameter in Step 4 using Equation 7. This is the Class 2 AEL for the laser. 
Note: The limiting aperture can be used from Step 4 because in the wavelength 
range of 400 nm to 700 nm, the limiting aperture diameter is constant for all 
exposure durations. 

10. Compute the Class 3R AEL. The Class 3R AEL is computed as: 

a) Class 3R AEL = 5 x Class 2 AEL if (400 nm < X < 700 nm) 

b) Class 3R AEL = 5 x Class 1 AEL if (T < 400 nm or X > 700 nm) 

11. Determine the Class 3B AEL for the wavelength of the laser. These can be 
summarized as: 


98 

Distribution A, APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE; DISTRIBUTION UNLIMITED. 



a) (180nm <X< 400 nm, 1400 nm < X < 1 mm) An average radiant power less 
than or equal to 0.5 W for an exposure time T > 0.25 s, or a radiant energy 
less than or equal to 0.125 J within an exposure time T < 0.25 s. 

b) (400 nm < X < 1400 nm) An average radiant power less than or equal to 0.5 
W for an exposure time T > 0.25 s and a radiant energy less than or equal to 
the minimum of 0.03 Ca and 0.125 J per pulse. For this limit, pulses 
separated by less than t m ; n are to be considered one pulse. Note that Ca is 
determined from Table 6 of the ANSI Standard. 

12. Compare the Class 1 AEL from Step 6 to O m i and O m 2 from Step 3. If both O m i 
and 0„,2 < (Class 1 AEL), then the laser is Class 1 and STOP. Otherwise, for 
visible wavelengths (400 nm < X < 700 nm), continue with Step 12. For other 
wavelengths (A < 400 nm or A >700 nm), continue with Step 13. 

13. For visible wavelengths (400 nm < X < 700 nm), if 0 m j > (Class 1 AEL), Q m i < 
(Class 2 AEL), and 0 m 2 < (Class 1 AEL), then the laser is Class 1M and STOP. 
Otherwise continue with Step 14. 

14. For other wavelengths (. A < 400 nm or A > 700 nm), if 0 m i > (Class 1 AEL), 0 m i < 
(Class 3R AEL), and 0„,2 < (Class 1 AEL), then the laser is Class 1M and STOP. 
Otherwise continue with Step 16. 

15. For visible wavelengths, compare the Class 2 AEL from Step 8 to 0 m i and 0 m 2- If 
both 0 m i and 0„,2 < (Class 2 AEL) then the laser is Class 2 and STOP. Otherwise 
continue with Step 15. 


99 

Distribution A, APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE; DISTRIBUTION UNLIMITED. 



16. For visible wavelengths, if O m i > (Class 2 AEL), O m i < (Class 3R AEL), and O m 2 < 
(Class 2 AEL), then the laser is Class 2M and STOP. Otherwise continue with Step 
16. 

17. Compare the Class 3R AEL from Step 9 to & m i and 0„,2. If both 0„,i and 0„2 < 
(Class 3R AEL) then the laser is Class 3R and STOP. Otherwise continue with 
Step 17. 

18. Compare the Class 3B AEL from Step 10 to 0,„i and 0,„2- If both 0 m i and 0 m 2 < 
(Class 3B AEL), then the laser is Class 3B and STOP. Otherwise continue with 
Step 18. Note that Q gr <m P and Q pu ise do not apply for a CW laser. However, for a 
single-pulse laser, the accessible emission for Condition 1 ( 0 ml ) and Condition 2 
( 0 n a) needs to be converted to the quantities for the Class 3B AEL, using the 
following: Q group = Q pulse = 0„ x t. 

19. The laser or laser system is Class 4. 

C.2 PROCEDURE FOR MULTIPLE PULSE LASER CLASSIFICATION 

1. Determine T max . Consider the maximum exposure time from the design of the laser 
in addition to the time for T max established in the ANSI Standard and summarized in 
the Evaluation Parameters section of this paper. The value of T max is established 
from the minimum of these two values. Note that T max is not determined from the 
duration of a single pulse emitted, but the duration of the exposure which may 
contain several pulses. 

2. Determine the measurement aperture diameter ( D m ) from Table 9 of the ANSI 
Standard. For a multiple pulse system, measurement aperture diameters based upon 
the single pulse duration, the total exposure duration (T max ), and t min must be

is determined from t. For Rule 2 (Average Power), D m is determined from T max . 

For Rule 3, D m is determined from the greater of t and t mm . 

3. Compute the accessible emission ( Q m ), which is the laser energy transmitted 
through the measurement apertures, for both Condition 1 (Q m i) and Condition 2 

(< Q m 2 ). There may be different applicable measurement aperture diameters for each 
of the three rules for determining MPE. The value of Dl for Condition 2 is usually 
determined at the distance indicating the greatest hazard, but no closer than 10 cm 
from the closest point of human access. For Condition 1, determinations of hazards 
from optically aided viewing (i.e., telescopes and binoculars) should be made at the 
distance indicating the greatest hazard, but no closer than 200 cm from the laser exit 
port, for all wavelengths (0.302 to 2.8 pm) that transmit through common optics. 

4. Apply the Three Rule Method to compute the various AEL (per pulse) values for an 
exposure time of T max . The Three Rule Method will determine three applicable 
AEL values. These are the Class 1 AEL values for the laser. This may not be a 
simple task, and the reader should reference our earlier tutorial on the subject. 4 

5. For visible wavelengths (400nm < X < 700 nm), apply the Three Rule Method to 
compute the three AEL values (per pulse) for a 0.25-second exposure. These are 
the Class 2 AEL values for the laser. 

6. Compute the Class 3R AEL values for the laser. The Class 3R AEL value is 
computed as: 

a) Class 3R AEL = 5 x Class 2 AEL if (400 nm < A < 700 nm) 

101

b) Class 3R AEL = 5 x Class 1 AEL if (A < 400 nm or A > 700 nm) 

7. Determine the Class 3B AEL for the wavelength of the laser. These can be 
summarized as: 

a) (1 80nm < A < 400 nm 1400 nm < A < 1 mm) An average radiant power less 
than or equal to 0.5 W for an exposure time T > 0.25 s, or a radiant energy 
less than or equal to 0.125 J within an exposure time T < 0.25 s. 

b) (400 nm < A < 1400 nm) An average radiant power less than or equal to 0.5 
W for an exposure time T > 0.25 s and a radiant energy less than or equal to 
the minimum of 0.03 Ca and 0.125 J per pulse. For this limit, pulses 
separated by less than t mi „ are to be considered one pulse. Note that Ca is 
determined from Table 6 of the ANSI Standard. 

8. Compare each of the Class 1 AEL values from Step 4 to their corresponding values 
of Q m i and Q ,„2 from Step 3. If Q m i and Q ,„2 < (Class 1 AEL), then the laser is 
Class 1 and STOP. Otherwise, for visible wavelengths (400 nm < A < 700 nm), 
continue with Step 9. For other wavelengths (A < 400 nm or A > 700 nm), continue 
with Step 10. 

9. For visible wavelengths (400 nm < A < 700 nm), if Q m i > (Class 1 AEL), Q m i < 
(Class 2 AEL), and Q m 2 < (Class 1 AEL), then the laser is Class 1M and STOP. 
Otherwise continue with Step 11. 

10. For other wavelengths (A < 400 nm or A > 700 nm), if Q m i > (Class 1 AEL), Q m i < 
(Class 3R AEL), and Q m 2 < (Class 1 AEL), then the laser is Class 1M and STOP. 
Otherwise continue with Step 13. 


102 

Distribution A, APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE; DISTRIBUTION UNLIMITED. 



11. Compare the Class 2 AEL values from Step 5 to their corresponding values of Q m i 
and Q m 2 from Step 3. If Q m i and Q m 2 < (Class 2 AEL), then the laser is Class 2 and 
STOP. Otherwise continue with Step 12. 

12. If Qmi > (Class 2 AEL), Q,„i < (Class 3R AEL), and Q „,2 < (Class 2 AEL), then the 
laser is Class 2M and STOP. Otherwise continue with Step 13. 

13. Compare the Class 3R AEL values from Step 6 to Q m i and Q m 2 from Step 3. If Q m i 
and Q m 2 < (Class 3R AEL) then the laser is Class 3R and STOP. Otherwise 
continue with Step 14. 

14. Compute 0 avg and Q gr ou P , using Equations 2 and 3 respectively, for a 0.25-second 
exposure for each Condition. Compare the Class 3B AEL values from Step 7 to 
Qmi and Q m2 , C P avg i and 0 avg2 , and Q groU pi, and Q gm u P 2, as appropriate. If Q ml and 
Qm2, 0 avgi and 0 avg i , and Q gr0U pi and Q gr 0 U p2, as appropriate, are each less than the 
corresponding Class 3B AEL then the laser is Class 3B and STOP. Otherwise 
continue with Step 15. 

15. The laser or laser system is Class 4. 

C.3 SHORTCUTS: 

For higher power lasers (0o > 500 mW average power, or Qo > 30mJ) do a quick check 

against Class 3B AEL. If 0 m exceeds the Class 3B AEL we have saved several steps. 

For visible lasers, do a quick check of 0 m against Class 2 AEL. This will save at least 

one step because it will immediately indicate if the laser is a more hazardous class than 

Class 2.

APPENDIX G CHANGES FROM EARLIER VERSIONS 

G.l SYNOPSIS OF CHANGES FROM LHAZ V4.2 TO V4.4 

The update of LHAZ from version 4.2 to version 4.4 represents continuation of development 
according to combined planned LHAZ and Laser Threat Modeling Component (LTMC) 
software library schedules. These changes include many new features, improvements in 
computation precision, as well as additions requested by individual users. A few minor bugs 
have been identified and fixed in this revision. 

The average user of LHAZ 4.4 will note few differences in the user interface or capabilities. 
Updates to the Standard Edition of LHAZ 4 include a new user interface for graph output such 
that multiple graphs can be displayed simultaneously. A simplified menu for producing a 
default hazard analysis report has been included. Also, an option to import files from version 
3.0 of LHAZ has been incorporated. 

The Professional Edition of LHAZ 4.4 has again expanded the advanced capabilities for laser 
threat analysis. Updates in the LTMC software libraries have allowed for a user interface to 
the complete LELAWS 3.0 accredited damage assessment models published in 1993. 
AFRL/RHDO has completed a migration of these libraries from FORTRAN to C++ in the 
LTMC libraries. Merged with the existing capabilities of LTMC, this allows a user to now 
incorporate probabilities of exceeding multiple hazard or threat threshold types while 
considering atmospheric scintillation, beam bore sight error, damage threshold probability 
functions, and system jitter. 

Other changes to LHAZ that may be noted by the more experienced user will include small 
differences in hazard distances computed for non-circular beam types. Numerical methods that 
are more accurate and avoid the use of approximations in exposure levels have been 
implemented. Also, more accurate estimates of the “worst case” exposure distance have been 
included which take into account atmospheric attenuation. Users will also note a few areas 
which include more detailed summaries of exposure levels used in optical density (OD) 
computations. 

Minor bug fixes include updates to the user interface to clarify wording, functionality, or 
behavior of default parameters, such as the wavelength ranges within the graphs. Also, minor 
changes in default report templates have been included. No changes representing erroneous 
computational results were implemented. 

G.2 SYNOPSIS OF CHANGES FROM LHAZ V4.0 TO V4.2 

The updates of LHAZ from version 4.0 were primarily user-requested enhancements, including 
an expanded LHAZ 4.2 PROFESSIONAL edition used by expert analysts. The standard 
edition updates included the addition of an atmospheric attenuation coefficient computation 
based upon visibility conditions. Users may now set the units in which hazard distances are 
displayed. The new context-sensitive status bar provides users with a brief description of 
parameters as they are entered. Also added to LHAZ were several new graph types. 

The Professional Edition of LHAZ 4.2 greatly expanded the advanced capabilities for laser 
hazard and threat analysis. Incorporating the new features of the Laser Threat Modeling 


115 

Distribution A, APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE; DISTRIBUTION UNLIMITED. 



Component (LTMC) software libraries, LHAZ 4.2 provides the detailed estimates of the 
threshold for ocular damage (Minimal Visible Lesion ED-50 Estimates). Also included are 
vision models for the determination of target obscuration from visible-wavelength lasers. 
These provide separate worksheets, which include hazard distance calculations and the 
associated report-generation capabilities. 

Addressed in the update to LHAZ 4.2 are several bugs identified by users of LHAZ 4.0. 
These include a change in the laser classification procedure, which applied the aided viewing 
transmittance to unaided viewing conditions. The correction for unaided viewing will increase 
the hazard classification of some UV and far-IR lasers. 

Other bugs appeared in several graphs using a logarithmic X-axis scale. The first point in the 
series would be obviously inaccurate. Another significant bug addressed was in the 
computation of the limiting aperture in certain UV-wavelength multi-pulse laser conditions. 
This did not significantly affect the hazard analysis, except in the case of small beam 
exposures. The input field for the laser beam parameters in the case of elliptical or rectangular 
beams was corrected to allow input values under all circumstances. In version 4.0, a bug 
prevented the user from changing the values from their defaults. 

Finally, several minor changes in the behavior of LHAZ 4.2 compared to LHAZ 4.0 have been 
implemented. The most significant of these is the dependence of MPE and AEL graphing on 
the user-defined exposure time from the MPE page. The exposure time previously was based 
upon the exposure time from the NOHD-OD worksheet. In order to clarify the exposure time 
upon which the graph is based, the exposure time used was added to the graph title. 

Users will also note that parameter entry fields now change to yellow in color when parameters 
are entered. Also, when aided viewing conditions are selected, a binocular icon appears in the 
lower right comer on the status bar. When the OD worn by the observer is set to any value 
greater than zero, a person with laser eye protection appears on the status bar. These icons 
remind you of the current viewing conditions while on any worksheet. Other minor changes 
appear in the sections that follow. This user’s guide contains illustrations from version 4.2 of 
LHAZ along with the explanations of functionality. Changes from version 4.0 are pointed out 
when possible. 

G.3 SYNOPSIS OF CHANGES FROM LHAZ V3.0 TO V4.0 

The motivation for the development of LHAZ Version 4 was the release of the revised ANSI 
Standard for the Safe Use of Lasers (ANSI Z136.1-2000). The changes between ANSI 
Z136.1-1993 (upon which LHAZ V3.0 is based) and the new release were significant enough 
to require a new release of LHAZ. 

The basic operation and capabilities of the program have been significantly revised, primarily 
to provide for operation under a Microsoft Windows ™ operating system. Expanded 
computation capabilities provide an increased number of variables which can be assigned for a 
given laser exposure, and an expanded reporting capability, including graphical representations 
of hazard analyses, and report templates which can produce a variety of file formats.
