ADA DUAL-USE COMMITTEE MEETING RECAP 


The Ada Dual-Use Committee met on November 9, 1993 to review the 

findings, conclusion and recommendations of the DoD sponsored Ada 
Dual-Use Workshop that was held last month in Vienna, Virginia. 
The meeting, which was chaired by the Honorable Emmett Paige, 

Jr., Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, 
Communications and Intelligence (ASD/C3I), consisted of several 
senior level executives and flag officer representatives from 
within the Department of Defense. The Ada Dual-Use Committee 
members included LTG Alonzo E. Short (DISA), Lt Gen Albert J. 
Edmonds {J6), LTG Kind (USA), Lt Gen Carl O'Berry (USAF), 

Mr. Lloyd Mosemann (SAF/AQK), RADM John G. Hekman (USN/NISMC), 
Brig Gen Bruce J. Bohn (JIEO), and Mr. Ronald Elliott (HQ/USMC), 
Ms. Cynthia Kendall (OASD (IM)), and Dr. Howard Frank (ARPA). 

Presentations were made to the Committee members by each of the 
following Panel Chairs; academia: (Dr. Charles McKay), 

governm.ent: (Dr. Kurt Fisher), industry: (Dr. Terry Straeter) and 
Vendor: (Mr. Bill Carlson). A summarization of recommendations 
and an action plan were then presented by Mr. Jerry Russomano and 
Mr. Donald Reifer on behalf of the Defense Information Systems 
Agency, Joint Interoperability and Engineering Organization, 
Center for Information Management (DISA/JIEO/CIM). 

Upon conclusion of Che meeting, Mr. Paige strongly endorsed the 
Department of Defense's commitment to Ada. DISA will proceed to 
implement the following action items: 

1. A detailed Program Plan for the DoD Ada Dual-Use Initiative 

should be developed to itemize and prioritize investments in each 
of the recommended strategy areas (Office of Primary 
Responsibility: DISA/JIEO and the Ada Joint Program Office 

(AJPO) . 

2. Migration systems should be pursued as the major target of 
opportunity for the DoD Ada Dual-Use Initiative (Office of 
Primary Responsibility: DISA and the Services). 

3. Current marketing efforts should be expanded to increase Ada 

awareness and appeal to commercial firms (Office of Prirnai-/ 
Responsibility: DISA/JIEO and the AJPO). 

4. Investments in hidings (Ada interfaces to operating systems, 
tools/environments, frameworks, commercial off-the-shelf 
packages, etc.) tools, education, and training should be pursued 
under the Ada Technology Insertion Program (Office of Prirnai'y 
Responsibility: DISA/JIEO and the AJPO). 







DISA/JIEO/CIM, Ada Dual-Use committee Meeting Recap 


5. Strategic partnerships with academia, industry and other 
government agencies should be used whenever possible to achieve 
Dual-use goals. Such partnerships require all participants to 
invest equally in developments (Office of Primary Responsibility; 
DISA/JIEO and the AJPO). 

6. Reward structures should be revamped to provide positive 
incentives to both contractors and government personnel who 
demonstrate excellence in Ada (Office of Primary Responsibility: 
DISA/JIEO and the AJPO). 

7. DoDD 3405.1 should be rewritten to clarify misinterpretations 
and provide consistent guidance (Office of Primary 
Responsibility: DASD (IM)). 

8. Reuse libraries need to be openly identified to distribute 
Ada Reusable Software Components (RSCs) to the software 
engineering community (Office of Primary Responsibility: 

Software Reuse initiative, DISA/JIEO and the AJPO). 

9. AdaSAGE source code should be disseminated to the Ada 
software community. (Office of Primary Responsibility: DISA/JIEO 
and the AJPO). 

Proceedings of the DoD sponsored Ada Dual-Use Wor)<shop will be 
distributed during December 1993. Additional copies and general 
information may be obtained from the Ada Information 
Clearinghouse (Phone: 1-800-232-4211). 

An Ada Dual-Use Initiative Workshop is being planned for the fall 
of 1994. This Workshop will discuss accomplishments during F'Y94 
and detail plans for the coming year.

PRESS RELEASE 


In cooperation with academia, industry and other government 
agencies, the Department of Defense has been exploring ways to 
increase the commercial use of Ada. An Ada Dual-Use Committee 
meeting chaired by the Honorable Emmett Paige, Jr., Assistant 
Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and 
Intelligence (ASD/C3I) was held on November 8, 1993 to review the 
findings, conclusions and recommendations of the Ada Dual-Use 
Workshop that met during October 19-20, 1993 in Vienna, Virginia. 

Upon conclusion of the meeting, Mr. Paige endorsed the continued 
use of Ada and directed tne Defense Information Systems Agency, 

• Joint Interoperability and Engineering Organization (DISA/JIEO) 
to develop an Ada Dual-Use Initiative Program Plan aimed at 
executing the actions recommended by the Workshop panel chairs 
beginning this year. These actions are aimed at promoting Ada 
more effectively, providing support and incentives, and enforcing 
the Ada programming language mandate. 

The proceedings of the DoD sponsored Ada Dual-Use Workshop will 
become available in early December. The Program Plan is expected 
to be released during mid-January 1994 .

Allow Ada 9X compilers in validation for use in 
non-critical production systems 








Tlie Ada community cannot afford to wait six months for tools to support Ada 9X. Otherwise, Ada 9X will fail. Also, the DcD should look at 
allowing non-validated Ada 9X compilers in the market until validated con^ilers exist.

ll'.e DoD should plan and inplement early applications of Ada 9X within DoD. Goals are to validate the quality of the Ada 9X 
implementations, to create favorable refer^ces for Ada 9X technology, and to provide constructive user feedback to help the vendors improve 
their Ada 9X products. DoD programs will have to be fjnded to pay the cost of their leadership in the Ada 9X transition. The Ada Technoloti)' 
Insenion Fhogram (ATIP) is a model for wiiat is required, but the required funding will be three to five times greater than previous fundincj of^ 
the ATIP initiative ($10M-$15M). ^

Ada Dual-Use Workshop Surrauary 


1.0 ENTRODUCnOV 

Approximately 175 individuals participated in the Ada Dual-Use Workshop, held on October 
19-20, 1993. The workshop was sponsored by Defense Information Systems Agency's 
(DISA) Joint Interoperability and Engineering Organization (JlEO), Center for Infoimation 
Management (CIM), Software Systems Engineering Directorate ( T'XE). 

DiSA/JIEO/CIM/TXE has been assigned the responsibility to evaluate current Ada initiatives 
and to align the strategies of the commercial and government sectors. This Workshop 
provided participants the opportunity to influence Ada commercialization strategies Ijeing 
developed. 

The Honorable Emmett Paige Jr. opened the Workshop v/itli a keynote address (see Appendix 
A for a copy of his address), which personally challenged participants to ’ provide [him] with 
the input [he] needed to make a difference." Representatives (see Appendix B for a list of 
attendees) from the academia, government, induspy, and vendor communities addressed this 
challenge and recommended actions that DISA/JIEO/CIM/TXE could take to both make Ada 
more attractive for use within the DoD and expand its utilization within the commercial sector 
under the auspices of a dual-use initiative. 

The purpose for commercialization is simple. DoD would like to increase the overall demand 
for Ada products, services, and applications, so that it can use market forces to stimulate 
increased investment and use of Ada by non-defense organizations. While this increased 
demand will create the pull toward Ada, the Congressional mandate will create the pu^h. 

Both the carrots and the sticks are deemed necessary to make Ada successful. 


2.0 PURPOSE 

Tire main objective of the Ada Di.ial-Usfc Workshop was to identify ways to increase the use 
of the Ada programming language and related technology in both defense and commercial 
applications. To acconplish this goal, the workshop was organized into the following four 
panels: academia, government, industry and vendors. Each panel deliberated to determine 
ways to make Ada more attractive to both DoD and commercial users. The conclusions and 
rec*:)mmendations resulting from the panel discussions are summarized belov/. A detail 
review of the panel session is contained in Appendices C, D, £, and F. In section five of this 
report the primary product of the workshop is a top-level commercialization action plan to be 
presented to high-level decision makeis within the DoD for concurrence and funding.

3.0 REPORT ORGANIZATION 

This report is organized into the following seven sections and six appendices. Section 1 
introduces the reader to the workshop and discusses why it was held. Section 2 defines tlie 
goal of the workshop and the methodology used to achieve this goal. This section discusses 
the report's organization and points readers to sections of pc)tential interest. Section 4 
summaiizes the conclusions which were gleaned as a result of the workshop. Section 5 
presents the consensus recommendations and actions tliat need to be taken to promote Ada's 
use in both defense and commercial applications. Section 6 provides a summarv of the 
results for the four panel sessions. Section 7 provides an overall summary for the report. 


4.0 ADA DUAI^USE WORKSHOP (DONCLUSIONS 

During the workshop, the panels heard a wide variety of testimony. Many issues were 
discussed along with suggestions about what to do to address them Oppci^'Tiities tor dual- 
use were also identified along with ways to take advantage of them. The retationships 
between tliese issues and the actions are illustrated in the cause and elTect diagram which 
appears as Figure 1 (Most executives have been exposed to these fishbone diagrams Ln their 
Total Quality Management training. The technique, often associated with Kaoru Ishikawa, is 
referred to as a fishbone because the representadcn between eflfect and all possible causes 
takes the appearance of a skeleton of a fish). As Figure 1 clearly illustrates, the issues 
thought to be inhibiting Ada commacialization ca ^ be caiegorizi^ in three main areas; 

• Marketing Ada fi’oni both a technical and business point-of-view. 

• Providing technical support and incentives for the expanded use of Ada within both 
the DoD and commercial sectors. 

• Strengthening the DoD Ada mandate. 

Many additional conclusions were made which aie contained in the individual panel 
summaries. Tlie most cited of these include; 

• Ada is a true dual-use technology as demonstrated by firms like Boeing on its 777 
aircraft. Motorola on its cellular phene systems and Silicon Graphics on its virtual 
reality simulation applications. Broader use in the commercial sector iiceds to be botli 
encouraged and stimulated.

Ada DuaJ-Use Workshop Summary 


There is no compelling reason for the DoD to rethink its Ada mandate. The reasons 
used to justify the development of Ada still exist, and the results achieved to date v/ith 
its use in both the DoD and commercial sectors have been extremely favorable. 

While teclmical issues still exist, the primary barriers that seem to inhibit adoption of 
Ada continue to be educational, psychological and managerial. Ada is peiceived by 
many as a DoD language. Its merits have neither been properly pmmoted nor 
adequately communicated to the commercial sector. 

'fhe advent of object-oriented technology and the mcnemcnt to disli'ibuted cliait-server 
arcfdtectures provides the Ada community with a rare "second window of 
opportunity ". During the late 1980's many organizations chose C inste-.d of Ada as 
they moved away from Fortran and COBOL into second and third gener.Jtion 
conqDuting environments. As the technology changes again, tlie choice seems to be 
between C+ - and Ada 9X 

To take advantage of this "window", additional partnerships (with industry, academia 
and odier government agencies) >are needed along with additional investments to take 
advantage of the positive market forces. Partnerships that exist with Department of 
Energy (DOE), Department of Transportation (IX)T)/FAA, and NASA as well as 
academia need to strengthened as the outreach program is solidified. 

A business environment conducive to continued commercial investment in Ada needs 
to be cieated. DoD should incentivize using Ada through the award, fee, and 
overhead structures of contracts. 

An aggressive marketing, promotion, and public relations campaign needs to be waged 
to improve Ada's image, communicate facts, and advance the teclmical and business 
cases needed to broaden Ada's use in the commercial sector. 

Tlic existing support base for Ada needs to be strengthened as a first order of business. 
Perceived ri.sl;s need to be mitigated and the Ada 9X transiti&n needs to be accelerated 
to solidify the existing DoD and commercial sector support base. 

A variety of contractual (evaluation points, preferences in hiring, etc.) and financial 
incentives (tax credits, changes in accounting practices, making training and too! costs 
allowable, etc.) should be put into place, stimulating private firms to continue 
investing in Ada

Ada Dual-Use Workshop SumnaiY 


• Career incaitives are needed to stimulate DoD program managers and acquisition 
executi\es to emphasize /VJa in their procurements, reseaich, and in-house projects. 

• Educational training and flmded research initiatives arc needed to motivate universities 
and alleges to both teach Ada and use it in their research. 

• Strategic partnerships which jointly fiind and develop needed capabilities (educational, 
industrial, governmental, etc.) should be strongly encouraged 

- DoD should encourage industry, academia, piofessional societies and other non-DoD 
groiqis to actively participate in its initiatives. 

» DoD should give priority to investments in bindings and COTS tools which increase 
the attractiveness of A^da within the commercial sector. 

• The Ada Joint Program Office (AJPO) has been doing many of the riglit things. 
However, as die technology transfer agent, it needs additional fimding and support to 
make Ada commercialization a reality. 

• While tlie policy requiring the use of Ada remains strong, it has not been consistently 
interpreted, applied or enforced by DoD components, FFRDCs, and research 
institutions. Policy deployment continues to be an issue as DoD downsizes and 
middle managers strive to cut costs. 

• DdD needs to empower and provide DISA the means to execute this revitalization 
initiative. 

• DISA, as DoD's executive agent for Ada, should give a high priority to moving Ada 
9X from the laboratory (current state) into practice (desired state). 

• DISA needs to reprioritize current Ada actions and reorient them towards increased 
commercial use. Their actions should be primarily focused on marketing, not 
technology development. 

• EoD should not forget that Ada was designed and targeted for defense systems, it 
should resist attempts to eliminate required fimctionality in an attempt to gain market 
acceptance. 

These conclusions represent a consensus of w'hat was heard in all of the panel deliberations.

Ada Dual-Use Workshop Summary 


5.0 ADA DUAL-USE WORKSHOP RECOMMENDATIONS 

Figure 2 represents tlie actions DoD executives can take to remove the barriers to Ada 
adoption, address perceptions, and focus on accomplishing its commercialization goal. Each 
action in this fishbone iagram respond to a corresponding challenge shown in Figure 1. The 
specific actioas are briefly explained below. 

To iinfsprove Ada's image, the following acUons are needed: 

• Build a business case and use it along witii success stories to communicate Ada's 
excellence. Work with the Ada Software Alliance (ASA) to develop a real Ada Trade 
Association (Ada vendors, proponents, etc.). Provide ASA and SIGAda with the "hard 
data" they need to make their eflbrls successful. Communicate the resulting products 
to DoD program managers and industry executives via an aggressive public relations 
campaign and a Service school initiative (academies, DSMC, National Defense 
University, etc ). Cooperate with the National Software Repository effort mounted by 
the Air Force (Mosemann initiative) and provide tliem the data they need for their 
effort.

Ada Dual-Use Workshop Summary 


Based iqx)n the workshop, we have identified ten near-term targets of oppoitunity as sliown 
in Table 1. It is recommend that the dual-use committee provide us witli direction to 
proceed with taking advantage of these within the near-term 

An initial assessment of potential investment is presented in Table 2. Although more details 
are needed, we believe funding at approximately $20 million per year for five years is 
required to make Ada commercialization a reality. The DoD dual-use program within ARPA 
is the primary source for these funds. 

Of course, any initiative of the magnitude presented needs to be managed as a major program 
within the DoD. Therefore, we recommend that the Ada progra!n be elevated and given its 
program element within the DoD budget. Reporting and management cognizance for the 
program should be given to DISA

Ada Dua]*Use 'Vorkshop Siamnary 


Tlie key topics derived from the two day ucadeinia panel session are suimnarized as follows: 

a. L^eveiaging academic accomplishmaits with Ada 83 as a foundation for 
subsequent inrorovements 

b. '^The relationship between Ada and related software engineering activities 

c. Availability of low cost environments, bindings and tools 

d. The role of educational trairang and research in stimulating Ada dual use 

e. Consistency of the EtoD commitment to Ada 

The academic panel concluded that this tv/o day workshop produced a useful discussion of 
key issues and possible approaches for institutionalizing Ada 9X within academia and thereby 
contributing to the commercialization of 9X However continuing dialogue and cooperation 
will be required if academia is to be involved as a frdl-fledged partner v/ith government, 
industry and vendors in achieving the goals identified for this workshop. 

Gov'emment, industry, vendors and academia have made notable progress toward goals 
Gonplementary to those of this workshop, 'fho infrastructure and accomplishments of this 
past work should be leveraged as a foundation for subsequent irrp-ovements. 

There is already a good baseline of Ada-literate teachers, computer science texts, free or 
inexpensive compileis, Ada-related academic organizations, and non-defense successes. 

The Academic panel has concluded tliat we need MORE of what has made Ada succeed, 

NOT whole new efforts! 

The academic panel recommends the following actions be immediately undertaken: 

a Restore/initiate consistency in DoD's treatment of Ada and Software 
Engineering. 

b. E?q)and an existing forum, ASEET (Ada Software Engineering Education and 
Training), to serve the needs for timely information and technology exchange 
among all educators friat are stakeholders in Ada 9X 

c. Lx)w cost/free environments, tools and other resources supporting instmction 
and research in and widi Ada 9X should be made available to educators and 
students as soon as possible.

Ada Dual-Use Workshop Summary 


Based on the briefings that were presented by the participants, the government panel 
summarized their recommendations as follows; 

a IVbriietiiig: - The EX)D should provide information that substantiates the benefits of using 
Ada during a given project's Life Cycle Management (LCM) process. This includes providing 
examples that are considered major Ada success stories. In essence, tlie DoD should advertise 
"succ stories" witfiin publications whose readership includes the audience that we are 
trying to reach - particularly, the business world executive (examples of such publications 
include Business Week, Forbes, Datamation, etc.). 

h Traiiiiiig and Education - The DoD should develop videos in conjunction \vith other 
federal agencies that identify existing programs, provide statistics, teach the lessons that have 
been learned, and describe a listing of available sources of information for instmctional help 
on Ada. Tlie Ada community as a whole needs to educate the universities and colleges about 
Ada, and support and proliferate its use. The DoD needs to sponsor efforts at the elementary, 
secondary and community college education levels to ensure corrtinued and successfiil 
utilization of the language. 

c. DoD Mandate - The DoD needs to clarify and promulgate the Ada mandate for the 
defense industry. DoD also needs to better inforce the Ada policy. This will support the 
Dual'Use initiative and will refute the claim that "the mandate is not directed at me". The 
DoD needs to lead by example. 

d Efindiiigs - The Ada community needs to foster an effort that focuses on Ada bindings 
through identifying required bindings, working with industry and NIST to develop and publish 
standard binding specifications, narrowing the choices among competitors, stimulating 
comparison efforts, publishing specifications, supporting prototype implementation through the 
subsidy of binding efforts, interfacing with numeroiis laiiguages at every level, and finally, 
standardizing the appropriate specifications. 

e. Tools - Ada tools need to be supported. Ada needs to have a rich set of tools that support 
new language versions such as Ada 9X, just like "C" does. AdaSAGE needs to keep current 
wifii Ada 9X In addition, DoD needs to publicize the availablity of Ada tools through the 
I-CASE program. 

f. bicailives - Tlie DoD and other federal agencies need to recognize Program Managers of 
Ada intensive projects with a special conference/gathering that rewards their involvement and 
efforts. The reward could be provided through the OASEXC31). Spot awards could possibly 
be made throughout the DoD and federal government.

Ada Dual-Use Workshop Summary 


g. Reuse Libraries - The community as a whole needs to provide reusable Ada libraries for 
all environments, domains, and platfonns. 

h. Validation - The DoD needs to allow superset/'subsets of Ada. This would help Ada reach 
colleges and universities. Also, the DoD should look at allowing non-validated Ada 9X 
compilers for non-critical systems until validated ones reach the market. This would speed 
the process of Ada 9X reaching the Ada community. 

i. Research - The DoD needs to subsidize more research in Ada and especially Ada 9X The 
funding for research could be provided through ARPA dual-use Hinds 

6.3 INDUSTRY PANEL SUMMARY 

The Industry Panel Session consisted of briefings presented by members of the software 
engineering community as a whole, not just the Ada community. Participants consisted of 
users, project managers, and senior executives throughout the industry sector, including both 
government contractors and commercial markets. Refer to Appendix E, Ada Dual-Use 
Workshop - Industry Panel Proceedings for the supporting data which includes a 
summarization of the panel findings, conclusions, and recommendations for each question. 
Participants briefed panel members on the following questions: 

1. What actions can we take to get Ada accepted as the preferred lai^v^c for 
development of software wititin your organization? 

2. What investments can we make to increase the comnercial rse of Ada? 

3. \Miat can we do to increase Ada's appeal, adoption, and popularity within your

Ada EXial"Use Workshop Summary 


Based on the briefings that were presented by tlie participants, the ’’ndustry panel suinmarized 
their reconuTiendations as follows: 

a. DoD Mandate - The DoD should strengthen the Ada inandale by enforcing the waivei' 
process and adhering to public law. Reinforce the DoD's language policy to include high 
integrity, research and development and infonnation systems wheie life cycle cost issues are 
paramount. Provide incentives tor those firms that have proven Ada capabilities on legacy 
systems, or provide awards for DoD Program Managers and firms who demonstrate Ada 
competence during contract performance. 

bt Business Case - In order to place a business focus on Ada plans and strategies, the DoD 
should cooperate with existing efforts (SIGAda, Ada Software Alliance, etc.) to substantiate 
Ada's excellence. A solid business case and briefing should be developed for Ada with global 
statistics that represent quantitative data on comparative performance (cost, schedule, qu^ity, 
etc.) of quality issues throughout the life cycle. In addition, the DoD should capture success 
stories, leverage lessons learned, and focus discussions on why Ada was selected and what 
benefits resulted. 

c. Bindings and Tools - There is a need for more bindings and COTS tools. The DoD 
should establish partnerships with Ada vendors to jointly develop high demand items on a 
cost-sharing basis (Government could take limited rights; contractor could get marketing 
rights). Additionally, the DoD should use reuse libraries as a distribution mechanism for high 
demand items on a fee-for-service basis. Finally, the DoD's strategy should look toward 
aiexistence, not toward exclusive use of Ada A coexistence approach with othei’ languages 
(C and C-H- based products), in their technically appropriate area of application, should be 
evaluated. 

d Maiteting - The DoD should define a marketing strategy for the commercialization of 
Ada. This should include defining the market and market needs for Ada within the DoD. 

The DoD's marketing strategy should include a plan for improving the outreach of Ada This 
could be accomplished by establishing a marketing objective for the AJPO ^lat includes 
interacting with professional societies, FFRDCs, trade associations, other government 
agencies, universities, and industry. The DoD should also reconstitute the Ada Board to act 
as a sounding board for new ideas. The focus of the board should be to develop a plan to 
move fi'om a technology-driven strategy to one that is market-driven. In addition, to solidify 
the existing Ada base, ^e DoD should view migjation systems witliin DISA as a potential 
opportunity to spotlight Ada

Acki Dual-Use Woitehop Sumrnai^' 


e. Education and Trainii^ - The DoD should stimulate educational use of Ada by permitting 
language subsets and supersets and by providing grants and other fomis of assistance to higli 
schools, universities, and colleges for Ada-based software engineering training. Reference in 
hiring should be given to Ada trained software entry level engineers and programmers within 
the DoD. A teaching environment and low-cost compilers for Ada-based software 
engineering training should also be supported by the I^D. In additioit the DoD should place 
a greater emphasis on training government personnel. This could be accomplished by 
providing videos and Multi-Media based educational software for self-paced management and 
programmer education. 

f. Reuse Libraries - The community as a whole needs to prordde reusable Ada libraiies for 
all environments, domaias, and platfoims. 

g. Incentives - The DoD should pro\dde incentives that will motivate investors to raiew tlieir 
Ada initiatives, and should stimulate industry' to develop and recognize core competency in 
Ada. Ibe DoD should establish joint inveshnents and strategic partnerships with other 
government agencies, universities a”d colleges, professional stxieties and trade associations, 
and dual-use programs (NIST, ARPA, NSF, etc.). Incentivize contracts for Ada use. 

6.4 '/ENDOR PANEL SUMMARY 

The Vendor Panel Session gave participants the opportunity to present their particular 
viewpoints and recommendations for increasing Ada utilization and commercialization. 
Briefings were presented by members of the software e gineering community as a whole,, not

Adii Dual-Use Workshop SiuniTiary 


The key topics derived from the two day vendor panel session are sunnoarized as follows: 

a. DoE) commitment to use Ada 

b. Awareness of 7\da in the awnmercial sector 

c. Providing a business environment that is conducive to vendor investment 

d. Role of Ada 9X in promoting dual use 

The vendor panel determined that the DoD aid Ada vendors can be effective partners in 
increasing the market for Ada goods and services in dual-use applications. This can be 
accomplished by focusing on sjiecific market segments and capitalizing on their respective 
strengths. 

The panel concluded that a particular tai'get of opportunity is the reengineering of Information 
Systems into architecturally designed Ada components which can be ported easily to nm in 
diverse environments ranging from mainframes to open client/serv'er configurations and 
personal computer s. Ada's technical benefits, especially portability and facilitation of reliable 
component level reuse, are especially valuable in tliese applications. 

The four higliest priorities for E)oD action are; 

• To demonstrate a consistent commitment to iLse Adii for DoD upplications. 

• To partner with industry/ in promoting an awareness of Ada's benefits. 

• To create a business environment which is conducive to private in\estment. 

• To accelerate the availability of higli qirality Ada 9X products. 

The DoD should be aggressive in impleinenting these h'gh priority actioas. A detailed 
analysis of each action area, including the findings which motivate the recommendation, 
conclusions, and specific inifrlementation steps is provided in Appendix F 

Vendors must also do their part, fliey must provide high quality products and services to 
meet DoD requirements, and they must be aggressive in promoting their products and services 
within non-Defense sectors.

Ada Dual-Use Workshop - Mr, F’aige's Keynote Address 


^rhe Honorable Emmett Paige Jr.'s speech was taken literally from transcripts provided by 
court reporters. 

General Short, 1 want to thank you for your remarks. 1 think back when we started with tlie 
Infor.nation Systems Command and reach back to find a tall army colonel that was supposed 
to be my deputy at Adelphi and promoted him to brigadier general, then moved him to my 
command, my new command. Then I sent him upi to Monmouth and then to ISAC. And he 
was supposed to do all that was needed to be done with Ada he and General Salisbury. And 
I don't iinagine Salisbury is coming today. But wlnat 1 should do is put you and Salisbury up 
here and get me a belt, a leather one, and whip on you all a little bit, because if you all nad 
worked harder at it, and if you all had really believed in it then, we wouldn't be here today. 

So I don't want you leaving here when you retire from the army and go out and start talking 
and saying bad things about Ada So if you have anything bad to say, you better put them on 
the table now, because when you leave the service, we can always call you back if you don't 
act right. 

Now, first off, before I even get to my prepared remarks, 1 want to tell you that I'm not a 
supporter of Ada for tlie sake of Ada If I didn't believe in it, if I didn't think it was 
necessary, I wouldn't be here, and never would have been a supporter of it from 1979, when I 
moved across the highway at Fort Monmouth to find out what it was all about. 

And I can assure you that the whole reason for Ada, in the first place, still exists. Tlie need 
today is probably greater than it ever was, greater than it was then. And a lot of people out 
there Uiat didn't even believe in automated systems back in those days are now believers in 
automated systems. So I say the need for Ada is even greater than it was in tlie beginning. 
And that's my vision and my view of the world. 

Since its introduction, DoD and the softwaie engineering community, 1 believe, have 
benefitted greatly from Ada. With the features that Ada 9X promises to bring to the table, 
things will get even better. While we took some early heat f^ause of lack of quality and 
validated compileii in the early days, tlie results to d^e show quantitatively that Ada makes 
sense, both technically and from a business point of view. 

Needless to say, die policy official in DoD that's responsible for C-4IA is finnly committed to 
the Ada strategy. Any speculation that DoD is wavering on die commitment to Ada is 
wrong. Based upon the results that we'\'e seen today, we liave no compelling reason to 
rethink our Ada strategy. This strategy uses Ada as a kingpin to bring a software engineering 
discipline into DoD. And I'm sure that most of you, if not all of you people that are here 
today, recognize the need to make software engineering really a discipline. In my hiunble 
\new, we have held Ada too tightly in the past. And as someone sai^ it's just not getting 
enough air. And we've got to loosen our grip. 


Defense Infonnation Systems Agency A-1 


Novembei 8, 1993 






Ada Dual-Use Workshop - Mr. Paige's Keynote Address 


Based on my experience within the Department of Defense, combined witli my recent 
experience in the private sector, there appears to be a common misconception that Ada has 
not received the level of support that is necessary to ensure its acceptance within all of the 
Department of Defense and Ae commercial sectors. I know for a fact that there are many 
private firms that have embraced Ada. For ex^anple. I've read that Silicon Graphics is using 
Ada in some of its virtual reality simulations. And I'm sure that they would not be using Ada 
if they did not think it was the best language to use for tlie particular piupose. N ASA and 
FAA are using Ada in their major prrjects. And, certainly, we will not blame all of the 
computer problems and other disasters that NASA has suffered in the past few years to their 
use of the Ada language. Likewise, we cannot blame FAA's use of Ada for the program 
delays that they've encountered. Many firms overseas, like Ferrani, Nippon, are using Ada 
with positive results. 

However, while I have not witnessed tliese examples firsthand, 1 nonetheless feel that Ada has 
not penetrated the commercial sector to the degree that we, within DoD, had hoped. The Ada 
market is perceived as a niche m^irket by maiiy of the vendors that 1 talk w.th. And, 
personally, I believe there is a lot of truth to this assessment. That's one of the reasons why 
we are here this morning. And that's one of the issues that we need your help in addressing. 
We've got to inaease tlie appeal of Ada outside of the Department of Defense, and outside of 
the federal government. We will, forever, have to carry the burden of the industrial Tower- 
of-Language-Babble on our shoulders if we don't do something to improve the utilization of 
Ada throughout our sector. While we are not afi'aid to continue our investments, the best of 
all possible worlds would be one in which the market itself caused others who would spend 
their money to enhance their market share of a larger Ada market internationally. The pull 
needs to accompany the push or else our chances of success in the future will be limited. 1 
would like to see U.S. companies leading the world in building jobs in this country, 
producing applications using tlie Ada language. 

In my view, we in the federal government have tried to piime the pump with Ada, but so far 
we've failed to find the answer to cause the commercial sector in the United States to pick up 
the Ada baton and use it for their own purposes. A few years ago, 1 used to say tliat tlie day 
that we see IBM adopt Ada for their commercial systems will be the day that we can say that 
Ada has arrived. Today, I will say that tlie day that we see Microsoft and Borland using Ada, 
we can say that Ada has arrived. 

There are other issues, as well. A lot of people still believe Ada is an overkill, tliat it's slow, 
that it's non-responsive. But I believe that we've come a long way in the area of 
performance. All of the benchmarks that I've heard about indicate that most Ada applications 
run as fast and are more robust than their counterparts in other languages. Witli regard to 
richness, this has never beai a handicap to tliose properly trained in software engineeiing in 
Ada As a matter of fact, those people that are Pained in Ada love the capabilities that tlie 
language provides to them

Ada Dual-Use Workshop - Mr. Paige's Keynote Address 


The availability of quality compilers, tools and environments, including the linkages, has also 
been raised as an issue in the past. And, again, 1 believe we've come a long way in this area 
in the past ten years. Those of you who are old enough to remember the early compilers will 
recall, as 1 did, the inefficient beast that consumed whole machines. Today, compilers can 
run effectively on work stations on your desktop. And when combined with ICASE, 
hopefully, and 1 repeat, hopefiilly, we will finally get the quality environment that we in the 
community have all b^n looking for. I'm told that Rational will provide their new 
environment. Tool Set, fi’ee or eiiarge to educational institutions across the country. 

Certainly, that will enhance the training of people in the Ada language in many curriculums. 
And that, too, will hopefully help institutionalize the language throughout the industry. 

To paraphrase Mark Twain, "The rumors of Ada's demise have been greatly exaggerated." 

M I said earlier, Ada is alive in the Department of Defense and within segments of our 
commercial industry. But being there is not enough. We want it to thrive. We've got to take 
Ada to a higher level. And we're trying to build strategies within DoD in the private sector 
to do just this. However, as the questions that we sent to you indicate, we are not 
presunptuous enough to assume that we have all the answers. We need your input. And we 
need your recommendations. That's the primary reason why we're here today. 

Our strategy focuses on strategic partnering, cooperative efforts, integration and bindings. 

And we are considering a more aggressive commercially-based approach. We are looking at 
many carrots and maybe a few sticks, as Jeny said. And we ne^ to inake Ada easier to use 
than not to use. We need to provide those, in a right-sizing environment, compelling reasons 
for using Ada What we have in mind is marrying Ada with several of our other initiatives. 
Just as an example, we are considering providing bindings to C and 0++, so that Ada 
programmers can access proven, reusable software components in other languages through 
Ada interfaces; providing educators with a quality teacliing environment for Ada, as 1 
mentioned a few moments ago, also will help. We also need to better market Ada and get rid 
of those misconc^tions that inhibit commercial use of this powerful technology. 

The users of Ada in the government contracting community and in the v;ommercial sector is, 
and will continue to be, our greatest, most effective marketing source, 'i'ou mirst talk about 
your successes as well as your failures. Talk about your problems, any problems, any 
successes that you have in using the Ada language. We simply have not done enough talking 
about the utilization. We intend to help you do that better than we have in the past. And to 
irrplement change, we need to ensure that our investment strategy spends money on the 
things that will really make a difference. 

For me, again, that's a primary output of this dual-use workshop. What 1 really want to do is 
to take your recoimnendations and run witli them 1 went to make your job and our job 
easier. 


I\i'ense Informcaion Systems Agency A-3 


November 8, 1993 



Ada Dual-Use Workshop - Mr. Paige's Keynote Address 


Let me tell you what's going to happen as a result of your input. On November 8, my 
executive-level coinmittee will meet to review all of the findings and recommendations tliat 
come out of this workshop. We will prioritize your suggestioas and task the director of the 
Ada joint program office to incorporate those in the plan for this ypor. 

Your challenge is to provide me with the input 1 need to make a difference. I'm counting on 
you. And you can count on me to keep the interest and the enforcement of the OSD theater 
policy on the front burner. 

1 certainly intend to enforce it. And those people who tell you that they can get waivers, 
remind them about Stan Fins, if you will. The then-assistant secretary of the army for 
financial management and Clyde Jeffcoat, both two tough guys, were determined that they 
were not going to use Ada And although the assistant secretary of the army was, I guess, 
supposed to be my boss, he didn't take me on. So I'm going to take on anybody that comes 
in and asks for a waiver. And if General Short gets one, and he doesn't send it up to me, 
well, then, he'll retire early. 

As 1 frequently say, I did not come back to OSD to play any games. 1 absolutely did not. 1 
came here to try as hard as 1 can to be a strong stalwart in getting on with the job that must 
be done in the C41 business across corporate DoD. Business, as usual, will not get the job 
done. Working together, we can make things happen. 

That's enough of a pep talk. I would now like to share my broader vision with you. 1 see a 
time, during my tenure, when DoD software engineers use Ada not just by mandate but by 
preference. 

They have the tools at their fingertips and the processes in place to make a difference when 
they have open access to quality, reusable software components from our reused repositories 
and reap the benefits from their controlled use. 

I see commercial software l>ouses investing in owning Ada because tlie market is there and to 
do otherwise would be a ccmpetiiive disacK'antage. 

1 see a steady^ stream of Ada-trained software engineers flowing out of our colleges and our 
universities. 

1 see the DoD being viewed as leaders, not followers, in software engineering and teclinology 
exploitation. 

1 see software costs continuing to go down and quality continuing to go up. 

And, most inportant, 1 see and desire compelling managers to select Ada because of business 
as well as technical justification.

That's my vision. And I thank you for your indulgence and getting up early enough tliis 
morning to come in here to see what I was going to say to you. I know that you've donated 
your time, and in many cases, your travel fimds, to assist us this week in this effort. For that, 
I want to say thank you. I'm especially giateflil to you. I'm pleased witli the turnout.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 

Tills Appendix contains the findings, conclusions, and recoinmendaticins for the four questions 

tliat were posed to the academia panel. This data supports the summary of tlie academia 

panel as described in the Ada Dual-Use Workshop Summaiy. 

2.0 ACADEMIA QUESTIONS AND FINDINGS 

2.} QUESTION #1: What actions can we take to make Ada one of the primaiy teacliing 

lai^u^cs within major colleges and universities? 

FINDINGS 

The following findings were a result of the participant briefings: 

• Ada is a foundation language taught in the first or second course for computing 
instruction at ^proximately 100 institotions of higher education. Ada is taught 
somewhere in Ae curriculum of several hundred other institutioas. However, this is a 
small "market share" of academia. 

• In order to achieve greater market share as a teaching language for Conputer Science 
(currently the largest computing discipline), Ada would have to supplant the predominant 
teaching language Pascal and Pascal's current academic challengers, C and 0++. 

However, there is a real window of opportunity. Pascal is generally acknowledged as 
being antiquated, but C and C derivatives are perceived by the Pascal community as 
retreating to a pre-engineering past. Therefore, the Pascal community could be persuaded 
to embrace Ada as a logical software engineering successor (and a buttress against popular 
erosion of software engineering support). 

• Computer Science instmctors prefer to teach programming languages tliat they are also 
using in tlieir research activities. 

• Perceptions are a part of reality even when tlie perceptions are not tme. Many educators 
still believe that Ada conpilers are not widely available and are too expensive for 
educational institutions to adopt. This includes the belief that Ada compilers and tools 
will not execute satisfactorily on existing, personal computing platforms. 

• Perceptioas are a part of reality even when the perceptioris are, but need not be, true. 

This includes the belief that demand is decreasing for Ada skills and knowledge and that 
U.S. ftmding agencies (i.e., ARP A and NSF) are anti-Ada

• Some existing Ada 83 organizations and projects aie doing some of the nght things. We 
should intensify and build upon this work For example, GNAT, BAA, efforts bj’ .“^iSEET 
and the AdalC are all committed to the adx'ancement of the goals and objectives of Ada

CONCLUSIONS 

• Ada, the programming language, is an important by-product and facilitator of software 
engineering. Promoting Ada 9X as another programming language will not be productive. 
Promoting Ada 9X in terms of its support for software engineering can contribute to 
achieving these goals. 

• Ada is a superior teaching language because it provides the right constructs - including 
support for concunency - for effective, disciplined development of reliable systems, and 
b«;ause the strong standard and compiler validation makes Ada programs much more 
portable ftian programs in any other available language. 

• In spite of the above advantages, "major universities" are characterized by their research. 
Until there is sustained and appropriate funding for Ada-related and Ada-based research 
initiatives, faculty at these (and other) universities will do their research (and teaching) in 
newer or vdiat is perceived-to-be more fundable languages. Other colleges and 
universities fiequently follow the lead of these "majors." 

• The GNU-NYU Ada Translator (GNAT) will serve a uniquely effective purpose in 
bringing Ada 9X to academic researchers. A very high proportion of academic 
institutions already have GNU software installed. GNAT will be distributed as an 
inherent part of the next version. This means that no major university will be vrithout a 
usable Ada 9X compiler, the availability of source code for this conpiler will enable 
GNAT to become an important vehicle for academic research projects. This will improve 
Ada's acceptance in research and cause a "trickle-down" effect to computing curricula 


'le to do Ada-based research and curriculum development, 
jecU would increase.

in Ada) to bolster the position of Ada as a foundation

2.2 QIJESTICXV #2: What initiatives can we mount to inciease Adti's aprpieal, ailopition 

and popiularity within the acadenic comrimoiit} ? 

FINDINGS 

The following findings were the result of participajit hnefings' 

• The Ada ommunity is isolated and the Ada programming language lias not been properly 

romoted. Ada needs to be marketed more broadly to increase Ada awareness witiiin the 
broader academic community. 

• The AdalC does good work popularizing Ada, but is inadequately and inconsistently 
funded. 

• Computer science based research efforts are not adequate for a wide variety of efforts that 
could make Ada more popular at academic institutions (e.g., distributed systems, high 
integrity systems, MS). 

• Ada's lack of bindings to popular packages such as x-windows, data bases and 
spreadsheets irrqiedes its broadei' use within academia 

• Curriculum development workshop, Ada training workshops and supporting software 
would all stimulate greater Ada awareness and appeal in academic institutions. Travel and 
per diem money is a necessity to assure good ac^emic attendance at such events. 

• Ada libraries with useful software for a variety of domains and accessible to the academic 
community are desirable by academia. However, many of the DoD reuse libraries are 
inaccessible to educators and have arcane aser interfaces that reflect only source code 
concerns. 

• Academic institutions could participate in designing and performing experiments showing 
the benefits of Ada 9X 

• Ada 9X could be positioned as a powerful tool for object-oriented programming and 
component-based programming. These capabilities could be researched in colleges and 
universities to increase academic community awareness. 

CXTNCLUSIONS 

• Even without a coordinated, full-fledged partnership of government, indastry, vendors and 
academia, the participants in evolving and applying Ada 83 have made notable progress 
toward goals complimentaiy' to tliose of this workshop. The infrastructure and 
accomplishments of this past work should be leveraged as a foundation for subsequent 
jn5)rovCTnents.

Ada EXuil-Use Workshop - Acadeinia Panel Siumnary 


• Tlie goals, rationale and successes of Ada 83, botli within and outside of DoD, have not 
lieen widely disseminated and marketed. Ada 83 is a rich and successflil language and 
has little to apologize for. Ada 9X will be even richer and more successflil. Tlie Ada- 
advocates within academia have had scarce resources and incentives to help promote the 
needed outreach. 

• Ada should be the foundation language (i.e., the language taught to majors in as many 
community colleges, colleges, and universities as possible). Ada should be the first, but 
not the ordy language taught in computing curricula Text books and other supporting 
instnictional resources should be developed to use Ada as the language of choice in 
advanced courses such as operating systems and data base management systems. 

• A conprehensive, integrated, software engineering curriculum should be evolved. The 
SEl, along with organizations such as ASEET, should play a leading role in this evolution. 

2.3 QUESTION #3: Wliat investments can we make to inciease the consneicial use 

of Ada? 

FUNDINGS 

The following findings were the result of participant briefings: 

• Ada 9X compilers and related tools could be used to stimulate interest in Ada 

• Lack of Ada bindings to popular windowing and database packages impedes tlie use of 
Ada in commercial applications. 

• The academic community thought that advertising could be a key area in attracting 
interest to new products and technologies such as Ada. 

• Ada needs more investment in CASE tools and products targeted for personal conputers. 

• Ada is often perceived as applicable for only large scale projects in the defense industry 
or for embedded systems in general. These misconceptions shoiJd be cleared up throng 
a public relatioas program 

ODiNCLUSIONS 

• Althougli it is easy and popular to recommend increased marketing and public relations 
activities as the key to commercialization of Ada 9X, such activities are only a subset of 
the broader and more important issues of successful technology hansfer.

• Berkley Unix and X-Windows (trademarks) aie only two examples of academic research 
products that have had a major impact on commercial software products. With planning, 
leadership and funding, Ada products of academic research projects can be used to address 
next-generation computing problems with similar results. 

2.4 Ql^STIQV #4: What steps can we take to increase the pool of entty level peisonnel 

with Ada skills, knowledge, and experience? 

FINDINGS 

The following findings were the result of participant briefings: 

• Many of tire findings to question #1-3 are applicable to this question. 

• Student internship programs were cited many times as a way to develop "hands-on" Ada 
skills during college. 

• Ada instruction needs to be expanded beyond a single course to a set of courses 
emphasizing software engineering that begin in hi^ school and continue tliroughout 
college. 

• The software engineering community draws practitioners from numerous disciplines. 

Efforts to increase the number of Ada skilled personnel should not be limited to the 
computer science field. 

• fhere is a perception that DoD and ARPA over-emphasizes the influence of major 
research institutions in training Ada programmers and researchers. A successful dual-use 
program lias to build on the important and sizable grass-roots constituency in hundreds of 
colleges and universities tlirou^out the country. DoD needs to learn how to 
communicate with and to mobilize that constituency. This is a successful and enthusiastic 
base of educators to build upon. 

CONCLUSIONS 

• Government procurements have failed to incentivize industry and vendors to emphasize 
Ada education, training, experience, achievement, and excellence. The result is that 
academia is concerned with the lack of jobs available for graduates that want to work in 
Ada-related projects. 

• Satisfying the issues of questions #1-3 would help resolve the issues of questions 4 and 
vice versa

Ada EXial-Use Workshop - Academia Piuiel Summary 


3.0 OVERALL RECOMMENDAnONS 

The following recommendations were derived from the findings and conclusions listed abo\e; 

• This two day workshop produced a useful discussion of key issues and possible 
approaches for institutionalizing Ada 9X within academia and thereby contributing to 

, the commercialization of 9X However, continuing dialogue and cooperation will be 
required if academia is to be involved as a fiJl-fledged partner with government, 
indastry, and vendors in achieving the goals identified for this workshop. 

• The following recommendations require a very small amount of additional DoD 
investment compared to the potential benefits and to the potential costs of failing to 
make such an investment. 

1. Low cost/free environments, tools and other resources supporting instruction and 
research in and with Ada 9X should be made available to educators and students as 
soon as possible. 

Discussion: Such support should be consistent with the software engineering goals and 
objectives of 9X and rewarding for the initial and the more experienced user. At the 
entry level, the visual interfaces and other support for student learning must be at least 
as good as that now provided in competing languages and environments such as C-H- 
and Turbo Pascal (tr^emarks). In addition, the Ada 9X environments, tools, and 
resources must clearly support the principles of software engineering. 

2. Expand an existing forum, Ada Software Engineering Education and Training 
(ASEET), to serve the needs for timely information and technology exchange among all 
educators that are stakeholders in Ada 9X 

Discussion; Membership should include, but not be limited to, educators from: 
military academies, universities, colleges, technical institutes, community colleges, high 
schools, commercial training firms and Software Engineering/Ada instructors within an 
organization. 

3. Libraries of reusable conponents usefitl for instmction and research should be made 
available at little-or-no cost to educators. 

Discussion: Such components should span the software engineering life cycle and 
include bindings, intierfaces and implementation components. 

4. DoD should sponsor an initiative to effect curriculum improvement tliat covers and 
integrates issues across the software engineering life cycle (Preferably, this should 
involve a number of other organizations as cosponsors).

Ada Oual-Use Workshop - Academia Panel Summary’ 


Discussion: The initiarive should include tlie use of Ada 9X in a variet}^ of domains 
including, but not limited to, mission cn’tical embedded systems, C31 and MIS. Such 
an initiative should build upon other efforts such as tlie ARPA BAA and tlie AJPO 
TIP. However, this initiabve should be focused upon software engineering as a whole 
and upon relevance to education and training in particular. In addition to ASEET (see 
Recommendation 2), tlie SEI should serv'e as a focal point for this work. 

5. NSF-style faculty development workshops should be made available to facilitate tlie 
expansion and integration of Software Engineering and Ada 9X instruction and research 
in academia 

Discussion: This means travel, per diem, and a small stipend should be available for 
educators who are interested in participating in such workshops. 

6. An Ada-based, software engineering, research agenda for at least the next five years 
should be established and publicized. 

Discussion: Such an agenda should include the kind of large-scale, basic research 
issues now addressed by ARPA initiatives. At the otlier end of the spectrum, the 
agenda should also include opportunities for smaller-scale, apj)lied resear ch projects 
that might be addressed by new faculty members in smaller institutions. This means, 
for example, that a new faculty membCT interested in Software Engineering and Ada 
9X could depend i^xrn the availability of related research funding for a sufficient 
period (i.e., at least five years) to establish an academic career. 

7. Fund iiLstmction, research, and service that helps place Software Engineering and Ada 
9X in "fi'ont of ^e wave." 

Discussion: Strengths of Ada 9X, such as reliability and maintainability, are not as 
attractive to potential students as perceived applicability to such current hot topics as 
virtual reality. However, virtual reality is only one of the current hot topics tliat could 
benefit fi-om Ada 9X sponsorship of Ada 9X based research in such subjects along 
with sponsorship of student team competitions can raise the visibility and desirability of 
including Ada 9X and Software Engineering in academia 

8. Restore/initiate consistency in DoD's treatment of Ada and Software Engineering. 

Discussion: Say what you mean Mean what you say. Budget and act accordingly. 

The supporters of Ada and Software Engineering within academia fiave paid a very 
high price for the vacillations anc inconsistent signals of DoD. A mandate that is 
ignored without consequence, that is unsupported by any major, Ada-based research 
initiatives in academia, and tliat is not generally peiceived to relate to anytliing other 
than the issues of DoD's programming language preferences undermines the best 
interests of all stakeholders and strongly argues against the inclusion of Ada in 
academia

9. Ai outreach program should be mounted in conjunction with implementing tlie above 
recommendations so that the necessary public relations, marketing and other technology 
transfer acti vities support the timely insertion of Software Engineering and Ada 9X into 
education and training. 

Discussion: The AdalC should play an iinportant role in this dissemination. 

10. Coordinate a long tenn, cooperative program among government, industry, 
vendors, and academia to advance the goals and objectives for Software Engineering 
and Ada 9X 

Discussion; Sponsorship of thesis students, faculty and student researchers, cooperative 
research and instruction, internships and exchange programs are some examples of such 
coordination. 

4.0 BRIEFING SUMMATION 

This section lists the major issues and observations provided by the participants in the 
workshop. Each participant was allowed 15 minutes to address the four questions. The panel 
members then ev^uated each issue and observation, to produce the consensus 
recommendations in the main body of the r eport. Not dl of the issues and observations listed 
in this appendix were considered valid or significant by the panel, but all of the participants 
added considerable value by raising ideas and stimulating discussion. 

4.1 SCOPE 

Major research universities, teaching colleges, and two-year institutions should all be 
supported by any efforts to increase the use of Ada in academia Tlie smaller universities and 
the commimity colleges produce far more entry-level software engineers than the research 
schools, and getting Ada into those institutions is at least as important as getting it into 
institutions like MIT and CMU. The panel’s observations and recommendations are 
addressed to all types of two and four-year, post-high school educational institutions. The 
commercial training industry is an irrportant supplement, but this panel did not develop any 
specific recommendations to aid it. One participant suggested tliat an effort to increase Ada 
teaching in high school was needed, but this received only limited support. 

4.2 THE FOCUS OF ADA EDUCATION 

Software Engineering was described as the main focus of Ada education efforts by many 
participants. It was pointed out that “Engineering” is a word tliat is “owned” by the 
Engineering (not Corrputer Science) part of many Universities, and that in some states 
Engineers of all types have to be certified and registered, so this temr is not readily usable at 
all institutions. The consensus was that Software Engineering, as we have traditionall>' 
understood it, is the right focus, but that another term may be needed.

Ada Dual-Use Workshop - Academia Panel Siunmary 


Another observation was that making new graduates conifouMe with Ada is at least as 
important as making them fluent in Ada. Ulien they reach industry', students will resist 
languages they are not comfortable with. If they feel tliat Ada is a sensible, leamable, useful, 
modem language, they will not resist it even if tliey are not used it themselves. 

Ada should not be the only language taught. One participant stated that a “computer 
scientist” who knew only one language would be unemployable. 

Another common theme was that Ada should be tauglit as a means, not as an end. For 
example, it is very effective to teach a course on artificial life, using Ada as 
the implementation language. An exciting main topic motivates students and makes learning Ada 
easier. 

It was also suggested that Ada Education efforts should focus on “component engineering”. 

4.3 ENSURING A MARKET POR ADA PEOPLE 

If the majority of eirployment advertisements for software professionals named Ada as a 
mandatory or preferred language, Ada would immediately become the foundation language in 
most universities with no further action by the DoD. 

There was general agreement that there are already enough Ada-qualified people for the jobs that 
require the use of Ada More people knowing Ada would tend to increase the number of projects 
that use Ada by choice, however, Though a significant number of large DoD programs are using 
Ada veiy few DoD facilities use Ada for the majority of the work done in house or by local 
contractors. For example, one participant had recently surveyed DISA’s internal requiiements, 
and determined that C and C-H- skills were needed much more than Ada skills for current work. 
Thus, Ada is not a strong requirement in the job market even in locations which are dominated 
by a DoD laboratory. 

One participant stated that advertisements may stress C or C++ more tlian the employers really 
mean, because naming particular programming languages and systems is easier th^ identifying 
sofhvare engineering skills in the communication from engineeiing tlirough personnel departments 
and into a few square inches of newsprint. Nonetheless, market demand is a critical factor. 
There was a consensus that anything the DoD can do to increase its own, or private industry's, 
use of Ada will also expand Ada’s use in academia 

4.4 RESOURCES 

The use of Ada as a foundation language (the first language taught to scientists and engineers) 
is dependent on resources. Currendy, there are more and better resources to support other 
languages, as discussed below. 


Defense Information Systems Agency C-9 


November 8, 1^93 








Ada EXial-Use Workshop - Academia I’aiiel Siunmiuy 


4.5 CURRICIIUJIVI DEVELOPMENT 

One of the most common themes was that a full, mulh-yeai', Ada-based Computer Science and/or 
Software Engineering curriculum, with associated books, luaterials, and exercises, was needed. 
Using Ada continuously, from entry level courses through Junior and Senior year courses and 
projects was seen as very important. 

There are two external impediments: Tlie AP (advanced placement) test requires Pascal; and the 
AACSB (American Association of Colleges and Schools of Business) includes COBOL as part 
of its mandatory curriculum Changing either requirement will take a concerted effort over many 
years, and must be in the context of a growing Ada market share. 

The DARPA BAA for curriculum development was considered extremely valuable. Several 
participants suggested that it be better funded and better advertised. It was also recoiumended 
that two current rules be relaxed: participants wanted the BAA to cover the updating of existing 
course material to Ada to be covered instead of only new courses, and they wanted multi-year 
projects to be allowed, 'fhere was a consensus that it takes several years to develop a good 
curriculum and its supporting materials. 

It was stated that running the BAA through DARPA lends prestige. It was also stated tliat 
DARPA-run procurements are not accessible to smaller universities, and other schools; tlie 
smaller institutions expect to get most of their money from the National Science Foundation. The 
NSF is also farther removed fi'om the military, which makes it a better funding agency for many 
faculty members. 

There are many textbooks on Ada for students. However, there is no textbook for the teachers. 
We need a “how to teach Ada” manual to make it easier for new adopters, 
fhere is also a shortage of textbooks that cpply Ada It would be very helpful if the language 
used in texts on A1 or operating systems, for example, used Ada for its code samples. Some 
textbooks come with a floppy disk containing C source code, but none come witli Ada 

4.6 PROOF THAT IT WORKS 

One participant said “we must stop relying on anecdotes and opinions and provide real data on 
the effectiveness of Ada in education”. A large-scale, hypotliesis/experiment scientific study was 
recommended. The groiqj recognized the value in this, but their implementation details were not 
worked out. One participant recommended post-giaduation interviews with students, to learn 
whether they are applying software engineering and/or Ada skills in theft jobs. 

4.7 FUNDING RESFARai 

Most people defined “major schools” as the leading research colleges. Ihe non-major schools 
turn out far more graduates, and theft use of Ada is also very important, but they do follow the 
lead of the research colleges to a significant extent.

Ada Diial-Use Workshop - Academia Panel Suimnary 


NSF's selection is based on Peer Review. Regardless of top inanagement intentions, basing an 
NSF research proposal on Ada practically ensures that the proposal will be rejected during peer 
review'. It was suggested that some bucket of funding be set aside at NSF for University research 
related to Ada Everyone agreed that it would be unproductive for DoD or Congress to pressure 
NSF to require Ada, or even to favor it. NSF likes to do joint programs, and if DoD can provide 
part of the funds for projects, it can specify Ada with no problem. 

Another suggestion was to seek out leading Computer Science researchers and offer them an 
opportunity and funding to connect their work to Ada. Supporting research requires appropriate 
reusable components. GNAT is an excellent start. AdaSAGE would also be useful, especially 
in for Information Systems students, if it were more available to universities. Tliere was 
widespread sentiment that this government-funded product should be available with full source 
code at no cost. 

There is also a need for inplementations of operating systems and other high-tech software 
systems in Ada Bindings to systems in other languages serve the needs of the production 
community, but for research to be connected to Ada it is necessary that the implementation be 
in Ada as well. 

Some participants recommended that e\>ery DoD grant and contract have some Ada connection. 
However, others said that this would be unacceptable to the research community. Providing 
“extra jwints” in evaluation for Ada related programs was broadly supported, however. 

One way to increase the use of Ada in research would be to provide assistance in writing grants 
to faculty members that propose Ada, The DoD could prov'ide a staff which helped to find 
opportunities and/or to create the actual application or proposal. 

Senior researchers working in C or C-H put pressure on the entry-level instmciors to teach C and 
C-H- so the students are ready to join the project in the later years. 

4.8 TOOLS AND ENVIRONIVIENTS 

“We must give Ada neM’ a/rantages with respect to tools and software components”. 

Universities choose languages more on the associated tools and environments than on the features 
- of the language itself For education, tools need to be “student friendly”. Aspects of this that 
were stressed by the participants were: 

• A Gradual Learning Curve; Students should get some results immediately, rather than having 
to learn a wiiole system before tliey can use it. The paradigm is “learn a little, do a little”. 

• Fun; Students need to be interested, challenged, and excited. Tools and environments for 
students should use high-quality GUIs, multi-media, graphical views of programs, and 
generally attractive technology. 


Defense Information Systems Agency C-11

Ada Dual-Use Workshop - Academia Panel Summary 


• Moderate Resources: Most colleges have PCs, and not the most modem and powerful PCs 
at that. While the community appreciates the Ada vendors efforts to make their products 
available for free or minimal cost, it does not meet the need when an Ada environment 
requires high-end workstations with large amounts of RAM for reasonable performance. 

• Avoid Blockiiig on Syntax: Students need to be able to concentrate on the impcitant issues. 
Student tools should help witli syntax so the students can learn real computer science rather 
than where to put the semicolons. 

MiniTual requirements include: multi-window editors, full compiler integration, graphical display 
of dependencies, automatic recompilation, and a navigable library manager. 

Student-fast means that there is no time for a distraction to set in while waiting for a compilation. 

Today’s Ada tools do not generally meet the ease-of-use standard set by current C and C++ tools. 
Novices require highly visual environments. 

There was a call for a “free Turbo-Ada for Universities”. Objections were raised that this could 
hurt the commercial compiler industry, and that current prices were low enough 

“It’s not enough to teach Ada and generate enthusiasm if in industry the Ada tools and 
environments don’t work”. 

There are many useful tools out there; what’s needed is to add the missing 10-20 percent, and 
ensure that these systems actually reach the educators who need them 
There was a wish that Microsoft and Borland would sell Ada compilers and environments. It 
was acknowledged that this would be extremely difficult to accomplish until such time as Ada 
was a bigger market than C or C++. 

4.9 GETTING IN FRCWF OF THE WAVE 

The “essentially cool stuff’ that computer science students want to use and learn about is being 
written in C, C++, LISP, and other languages. Virtual reality, Al, parallel processing, multi- 
media, and other state-of-the-ait, exciting technologies are the interests of students, and the proper 
focus of computer science departments. The experimental and protot>ping work researchers do 
under DoD funding is widely considered to be “outside” the DoD Ada mandate. The DoD can 
always redevelop pjroduction versions of this software in Ada, or write an Ada binding to it later, 
when the technology is sufficiently mature for use in weapon or information systems, but this 
approach does not address academia’s needs. It leaves Ada always behind the wave, catching 
up with technology that was first available in C, LISP, or some otlier language. 

Engineering students (whetlier Software Engineering or enother field such as Electrical 
Engineering) are less sensitive to the implementation language used in conputer science research. 
However, Ada’s current position behind a another wave does limit its appropnateness for these 
students: this is the tools and environments wave discussed above.

Ada Diial-Use Worksliop - Acadeinia Pajiel Siiminaiy 


To rapidly expand the use of Ada as a foundation language in software engineering and computer 
science ^ucation, it is necessaiy to get ahead of the wave in research artifacts and in 
development environments. Tliis could be done by ftinding a large-scale \artual reality research 
project tliat would use Ada, for example. A development environment better than Visual Basic 
or TurboC is needed to get ahead of the tools and environments wave. Ada environments must 
become technically better than Borland’s C-H-. 

DoD’s repositories are not serving academia’s needs. They are not accessible without 
burdensome paperwork and delays. Though access may be “streamlined” from the \aewpoint of 
DoD contractors and project offices, the academic community compares it witli tlie instantaneous, 
paper-fi'ee process it now uses (anonymous ftp tlie internet, coupled with infonnal 
archiving/indexing systems maintained on a volunteer basis). Nearly all four-year institutions 
have internet access, at least for selected faculty, and can t^ into hundreds of archjves, 
containing millions of lines of useful, working code. Cross-repository searching mechanisms are 
informal, but can be used very effectively by experts. M\ of this software is eithei' pubhc 
domain or otherwise usable for university research without permission, paperwork, fees, or 
delays. Very litde of tliis software is in Ada In comparison to the C and LISP software 
instantly available on the Internet, DoD’s Ada software is locked iqi and unindexed. DISA is 
not connected to the Internet. 

4.10 OITTREACH 

Steps are needed to improve Ada’s image in industry and academia, and to put Ada educational 
resources into the hands of educators, as discussed below. 

4.11 RJBUC RELATIONS 

The name of the AJPO sounds too military. It should be changed. Anything would be an 
improvement. Call it “snoopy” or “AdaSEX”. Avoid the military image, which is very 
undesirable to students and faculty. “I am not going to teach a language thk is primarily for 
building bombs”. We should never ase military or violent example programs in instruction and 
publicity. If industry gives tools to universities, they should come back later and find out how 
its working out. We should make a disk (with a picture of Ada on the cover) containing success 
stories, summaries of resources, statement of commitment, and general advertising for Ada; make 
hundreds of copies; and give them away fi'ee at conferences (not TriAda, outside the Ada 
community, and targeted to the education community. That we must stop preaching to the choir 
was a common theme. We should participate in SIGPlan as well as SIGAda 

A consistent message fi-om the DoD is an essential part of any public relations effort. The 
periodic anti-Ada blasts from hi^ DoD levels are very harmful. The DoD needs to consistently 
support Ada in both words and actions.

Ada Dual-Use Workshop - Academia Panel Summary 


Pascal is tlie foundation language in neaiiy hiilf of cunent University progntms. It is being 
gradually displaced by C or C++. Ada could and should go after the Pascal share of the iruirket. 
^le C language rode in on the coattails of UNIX Ada needs somethittg tliat does tlie stune thing 
UNIX did for C. Retuse, reliability, portability, tnaintainability and the other major featiues that 
make Ada attractive to the DoD are not attractive to students. Students want to lecini cUid use 
languages that are modem, interesting, popular, fun, and “essentially cool”. We shouldn't dlow 
Ada to be compared with non-Software Engineering languages. 

<.12 HELPING FACULTY GET STARTED 

Educators are busy, 'fhey tend to teach the same course yeai' after year, with the same materials. 
They would be happy to update tlie courses, but don’t have time. Tliis inertia handicaps Ada 
introductioa People teach v.'hat they know, like, and use. 

Tlie DoD si ould sipport a touring team of Ada educators to help universities get started teaching 
and using Ada. The .ASEET program is a good beginning, and very modest additional travel 
ftmding coiqiled with volunteer efforts from academia will help. The purpose of these teams 
would not be to piersuade universities to switch to Ada: it would be to help them get started once 
they have chosen Ada However, knowing that the help was available would be a strong positive 
for Ada in their decision. Tlie DoD should fund summer workshops to teach Ada and Ada 
instruction to educators. '^The NSF operates such workshops in many other technology areas, and 
this would make a good model. Educators should receive travel and lodging costs and perhaps 
a small stipend to attend. 

4.13 FURl HER OBSERVATIONS 

Though not recommendations or issues, the follo\ving observations were made and well-received 
by the panel: 

• All faculty' members are eager to do research and gel funding for it. 

• Stars and the SEI get lots of money, but haven’t produced many pioducts useful to the 
academic community. 

• Even educators who currendy use C and C++ as a foundation languages acknowledge that 
they are poor languages fi'om a teacliing viewpoint. C or C++ are chosen because they are 
popular and well supported by tools and other resources Ada is clearly better as a language, 
but more resources and more “outreach” are needed to make it a practical choice for many 
institutions. 

• rhere is enormous “downward press’.ire” on intrcxiuctory-level instructors to switch to C. 
This is because industry' and students believe diat drey can get jobs with C skills, but not vvaih 
Ada This percqjtion (which may be a .at) has a strong influence on University 
management.

Ada Dijal-Use Workshop - Academia Panel SiiniiTiaiy 


• "Ada Research” is not respectable. It is like doing “COBOL reseaich”. AcLi ciui Ixj used in 
many other research projects (some people iugued d! other reseaich). but is not a topic in 
itself. 

• Tlie DoD never had a reasonable plan to incremenUdiy transition its own staff and work to 
Ada. DoD had tlie intention, but never created a real, tactical pkui. A “big biutg” transition 
could never have worked. 

• To make Ada succeed, 90% of DoD people (military, civilian, md inaisienis such us DA RPA 
managers) must get on-board. 

• Academics are beginning to realize how bad C is (for software engineering and teaching in 
general), and that C+-t doesn’t fix it. Beginners can do too many things wrong, and tlie 
compilers don't help. Ada slaps your hand if you write something stupid; C assumes you 
know what you’re doing. 

• Summer funding is extremely valuable in small colleges, because salaries and supplemental 
funding for instaictors are tight in their existing budgets. 

4.14 OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DOD ACTION 

• “The DoD should never buy a piece ofhardware without an Ada compiler on it”. DoD needs 
to actually buy the compilers with the hardware, not just note that one is available. Systems 
which don’t have any compileis or development tools don’t need Ada compilers either, but 
if the machine si^iports development in any other language, it must have support for Ada 
as well. This point is tied to the need for a consistent message from DoD and the need to 
stimulate the corrpiler and tools industry to make better products. 

• In commercializing Ada, the DoD should target particular application domains, or market 
niches, and invest in the infrastructure for each niche. Examples of domains are 
Simulation, On-Line Transaction Processing, and Computational Fluid Dynamics. In each 
targeted domain, it would be necessary to develop Ada equivalents of the important 
reusable software and COTS tools now used in that domain. 

• Qven the necessary infrastructure, the DoD could sponsor pilot projects or “shadow” 
programs to show how effective Ada is in that domain. 

• Tlie DoD should require that all COTS software it purchases provide equal support for 
Ada; If the product provides a programming interface to C, COBOL, or any other 
language, it must also provide one for Ada It would not be necessary tliat tlie CO ITi 
products be written in Ada, only Ada bindings be included for any programming 
interfaces.

Acki I>,uil-lJsc Worksliop - Academia P;iiiel Siuiim<iiy 


• If the DoD would incentivize software engineeniig iuid soflwaio reuse, raid include life- 
cycle costs in the evaluation of progr^un managers, it would increase the ilsc of Ada on 
E)oD programs. 

• A minority held tliat the inandate was hannful Ixicause of “reverse psychology”, but the 
majority supported the mandate because of the needs for an assured base of employment 
opportunities for Ada-trained graduates and for a consistent public i\da message from 
DoD, 

• Providing companies who work in Ada with small financial incentives to bring in co-op or 
summer students would have great leverage: it would create a demand for Ada-fluent 
students in the universities, give tlie students experience and success stories, and 
encourage more contractors to use Ada.

Software Component Engineering and 
the Future of Ada 


Muraii Sitaraman 

Dept, of Statistics and Computer Science 
West Virginia University 
Morgantown, WV 26506 - 6330 


Correspondence: muraii@cs,wvu.edu 







Key Points 


Emphasize the influnces of introducing software 
component engineering principles early and 
throughout the CS curriculum on the US industry 

Fund design of multi-year course sequences to 
introduce SE principles 

Fund long-term experimental evaluation 


-. Bottom line ... 

Hypothesis :— Strengths of Ada will make it the ideal 
choice for a software component-based curriculum 


Note: The Curriculum Development initiative is right on the money, but 
does not currently support long-term investigations. 









Why SE Principles Should Be Introduced Early? 

Or 

Problems Facing Undergraduate CS Education 


Absence of a context to learn fundamental principles 
such (e.g., abstraction) early in the curriculum 

Absence of motivation for (formal) specification and 
design issues early in the curriculum 

Relatively late exposure to SE principles resulting in 
graduates with little experience in practising SE 

Minimal exposure of SE principles for non-computer 
science majors; and 

Software construction not viewed as an assembly of 
“well-engineered” reusable components. 



An Example Sequence 


CS 1 (introductory course) 

CS 2 (data structures course) 
CS ? (algorithms analysis) 

CS ? (compilers) 

CS ? (software engineering) 
CS ? (component engineering) 


An Example Issue 

Specification-based generic component reuse across 
courses —facilitated readily by Ada 










Long-Term Evaluation 

Evaluate the influences of teaching SE principles 
on student careers in academia and the industry 

Evaluate abilities of multiple programming languages 
in learning SE principles 

Evaluate the influences of interleaving languages 
Evaluate the influences at a spectrum of institutions 


Results will be two-fold 

• Experimental evidence that Ada is an excellent 
vehicle for introducing SE principles 

• Ada and serious Ada-competitors (e.g., C++) can 
co-exist in academia 








Actions for Making Ada A Primary Language and 
Initiatives for Enhancing Ada's Appeal 

1. Stress the importance of integrating software 
component engineering principles thioughout the 
curriculum; evaluate influences on student careers 

2. Support multi-year curriculum redesigns to instill 
software engineering/software reuse principles 

3. Make a coherent series of textbooks available for such 
SE-based course sequences 

% 

4. Show experimental results on comparing/interleaving 
Ada with other programming languages 







Investments 


Fund 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the previous slide: 

Fund multi-year, multi-institutional efforts for integrating 
software component engineering principles in CS 
curriculum and evaluating long-term influences of such 
efforts

Premise: 


The advantages of C are largely due to 
history: the quantity and diversity of software 
and tools available have made language features 
secondary in language adoption decisions. 


Course of action: 

We must give Ada new advantages with 
respect to tools and reusable software: 

• Tools with new functionality, support 
for interoperability, prototyping, etc. 

- Highly reusable software libraries, 
including Ada i mplementations (not

Ada Dual-Use Workshop 
Position Paper, Academia Panel 
Richard E. Bolz 
Ada Consultant 


I served as an Associate Professor of Computer Science for many years at the USAF 
Academy. Following my remement from the USAF in 1985 I began a private independent 
consulting practice primarily involved with Ada training. Counting academic courses, 
tutorials and professional seminars, I have taught the language over 100 times since 1979. I 
have given faculty and gradutite student Ada seminars at several major universities. 

My information regarding Computer Science faculties might be a bit out-of-date, it is 
gleaned from my experience as a faculty member, my discussions with faculty members of 
other institutions and anecdotal research formed by discussing university experience with my 
current students, most of whom are experienced professionals in the computing field. 

I was involved in the Ada training and development for the STANFINS project 
conducted by CSC for the US Army at Ft Benjamin Harrison, IndianapoUs, Indiana. This 
project redesigned and converted the army's Standard Financial System from COBOL to Ada 
The project was accomplished by a staff of over 90 software developers most of whom knew 
only COBOL prior to the project The system was delivered under budget and virtually on 
time. The following project, STAJRFIARS, an inventory and accounting system, has made 
good use of the lessons learned and technologies developed in the STANFINS project 


Projects fail for sociological reasons, not technological reasons 

Bolz’s Law 

-A corollary to this law might be transition to using Ada in the commercial world is a 
sociological problem, not a technological problem. I begin with the premise that there are no 
technological barriers to tlie increased use of the Ada language in the commercial world. 

Most of the issues discussed herein are people issues. 

1. What actions can we take to make Ada one of the primary teaching languages within 
major colleges and universities? 

a. 'Fliere must be economical, efficient translators available. Until we can provide a 
capability like Turbo Pascal or even WATFOR, we will not be able to accommodate 
the mass requirements of an introductory course in CS. If such translators exist, 

we should find a means of getting them to the universities at little or no cost. This is 
the only suggestion that is primarily technological. 

b. There must be strong faculty suppon. (see # 2) 

c. We must be able to show, convincingly th.Tt Ada is a legitimate language for 








teaching, (see #2). must be well-versed in all of the arguments that might be 
raised. 


1) . Gather information from schools that currently use Ada. I assume that 
ASEET already has much of that information available. 

2) . Develop a sample curriculum showing the benefits of using Ada from 
course to course. 

3) . Establish a team or teams which could tour selected departments offering 
seminars, discussing proposals with faculty and gathering data regarding 
perceived stumbling blocks. 


2 . What initiatives can we mount to increase Ada's appeal, adoption and popularity within 
the academic community? 

a. Many university departments honor research above teaching. The clearest patli 
to adopting Ada as a teaching language would be along the research lines. 

1) . Issue an RFP for schools to test the viability of using Ada in at least a 
three course curriculum, 'i'his curriculum should probably consist of 
Introduction to Programmmg, Data Structures, and Algorithm Development. If 
the language is as effective a teaching language as we predict, those schools 
will likely continue with the use of Ada in these and also more advanced 
courses. 

2) . Insist that certr in research projects given to selected universities be 
accomplished in A,ja. 

b. In many CS deparments, the curriculum is only nominally integrated (if at all). 
That is, software engineering courses tend to tout the language-independent nature of 
life-cycle approaches They often overlook the benefits of certain languages over 
otliers relative to such issues as abstraction and information hiding. Students are 
rarely introduced to the concept of a compilable specification. 

c. It is difficult to experience principles of programming-in-the-huge at the university 
level. Semester imitations allow only examples of programming-in-tlie-small, medium 
or, in the case of multi-semester courses, programming-in-the-large. Provide a suite of 
case studies which exemplify the scale-up difficulties of very large systems and the 
benefits of the Ada language in dealing with such difficulties. 

d. Most faculty members have not taken the time to learn the language. One 
approacn to solving this is to have a teach-the-teachers course, touilly government 
funded, for CS faculty members of taigeted univ rsiries. 


e. Many schools are beginning to focus on object-oriented methodologies. It might be 
wise to wan for Ada 9X before trying to 'infiltrate' these schools. 

3. What investments can we make to increase the commercial use of Ada? 

a. A partitioned approach will probably work best.. We should target the commercial 
world sector-by-sector. That is, the plan for increased use should probably vary from 
application area to application area. The optimum approach for the MIS sector might 
not be the optimum approach for the simulation sector. 

b. We should not try to convince the commercial side to merely 'switch' languages. 
We must be able to discuss the benefits of the language in terms of the entire life- 
cycle. Perhaps the best approach would be to focus on certain Ada-oriented CASE 
approaches. 

c. We must be able to show successes, from the DOD world, in the particular sector 
we are targeting. The commercial side is very results-oriented. If we target the MIS 
sector, tlien we might show the success of STANFINS and STARFIARS which dealt 
with US Army finance, accounting and inventory. 

d. While the absence of DOD success stories in the sector would be damaging, the 
presence of such stories, in and of itself, will not be convincing. We must take steps 
to actually build success experiences in the commercial area itself. One approach 
would be to fund and partially staff parallel development of selected projects. 

e. Realize that we will be dealing with a great amount of resistance-to-change. 
Fh-ofessional software developers have gotten comfortable with a cenain way of doing 
business. We must, somehow, minimize the trauma of transition. 

1) . One approach would be to provide a 'woik alike' environment so that the 
software developers have the assurance that all the tools they are used to using 
have some kind of counterpart in die new environment This allows a smooth 
transition, one new idea/tool at a time. An example would be to provide a 
CICS-like capability for the MIS sector. CICS is available on HP systems. 

2) . Another approach is to provide functional equivalency at a higher level. 

This might occur if we introduce Ada within the context of a CASE 
environment that includes such capabilities as automatic capturing of 
requirements via screen 'painters' and al.so automatic generation of Ada 
software and documentation from the captured requirements 

f. If the target sector is one with enhanced suppon from Ada 9X (MIS for example) 
dien the appeal for transition will be made easier if we wait for Aria 9X to become a 
reality. Of course, we would not have the success stones to share for a while. 






g. 'I'here is a CASE environment in existence that builds on the success of the 
STANFINS and STARFIARS projects. A small company, Ventura Technology 
International, has developed its Advanced System and Software Engineering 
Repository and Toolset (ASSERT). This environment, while applicarion and language 
independent, has been shown to be effective when used on MIS systems written in 
Ada. It includes capabiliries for interactive capture of design information via screen 
painters, automatic generation of Ada code, and automatic generation of supporting 
documentation. It is hosted on HP-UX, HP's Open System Enviromnent(OSE). 

h. There is an increairing interest in object-oriented methods. We should have a 
working forum within certain selected sectors (MIS for example) with the intent of 
designing and even implementing class libraries to support various activities within the 
sector. 

i. Regarding the COBOL community: It has been my experience that COBOL 
programmers have no particular difficulty making the transition to Ada. There will be, 
of course, some initial resistance-to-change. That is easily overcome by validating the 

students’ experience and treating them as the professionals they are. 

4. What steps can we take to increase the pool of enhy level personnel with Ada skills, 
knowledge, and experience? 

a. This will partially take care of itself if we have successfully accompIi.shed the goals 
of numbers 1 thru 3. Many of those in gcvemment service with Ada experience will 
migrate to the commercial sector as the open marketplace has its effect. This, of 
course, will force us to reconsider the question in light of increasing the pool for 
DOD. 

b. Vigorously target smaller schools, including community colleges. Often these 
schools have very few CS courses available. They might appreciate a 3-course 
curriculum (see 2.a) with slides, ca.se studies, examples, lesson plans etc. 

c. Provide a forum for these smaller schools and local industry to enter into symbiotic 
relationship. The local industries can provide adjunct faculty, advice on curriculum 
and entry-level employment for graduates from the institutions. 

Conclusion: 

Primary suggestion for success in the MIS commercial sector: 

Migrate STANFINS to an OSE and deploy

Promoting the Use of Ada in 
Computer Science Curricula 


Timothy J. Long 


Ohio State University 







To 


ease Use of Ada in Academia: 


• Supplant Pascal 

• Compete with the move to C/C++ 


Necessary to Achievji.ng Both Are: 


« Wide availability of good materials 

• Textbooks 

• ProgTcLmming assigmnents 

• Software libraries 

• Wide avcdlability of ‘‘student’* compilers 

• Inexpensive 

• Fast 

• Very friendly 

• Run on variety of "low-end” equipment 


A Philosophical Stand on the Computer 
Science Undergraduate Curriculum: 


• The backbone of the curriculum is a 
REDESIGNED sequence of courses, CSl, 
CS2, CSS,... , on progrmriiiiing and 
software development/engineering. 

• THE ENTIRE SEQUENCE IS FIRMLY 
GROUNDED IN SOFTWARE 
ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES. 

• The entire sequence is uniform, 
presenting a consistent view of what 
software is and how it should be 
developed. 


Then, to Supplant Pascal: 


• From DAY 1 OF CSl emphasize software 
engineering principles that require 
features not present in Pascal: 

• Object-oriented design 

• Reusable and extencSble softwar e 
components 

• Information hiding beyond 
procedural abstraction 





Proof of Principle: 


• Long-term studies can track students 
measuring: 

• Student attitudes towards the 
principles and practices taught 

• Whether students apply these 
principles and practices in other 
courses 


• Positive responses in such studies would 
imply that students have the 
EXPECTATION to use similar languages 
and practices in the COMMERCIAL work 
place. 





Please Note - This Proposal is EXPENSIVE: 


• It requires consistent, uniform materials 
over a sequence of courses. 

• It is unlikely that current CS1 materials 
are appropriate, so the effort starts with 
CSl. 

• Multiple faculty will need to be involved. 

• Tracking studies must be well designed 
and scientifically rigorous in order to 
cany weight, 

• The entire project has to be funded for the 
long term. 


But, a BIG study showing good results could 
very well have a BIG PAYOFF. 






Meeting the C/C++ Challenge: 

• Promoting Ada as the second language in 
the curriculum probably will not work. 

• There is “downward” pressure for C++, 

® Students are susceptible to “C++ 
fever”. 


• C should not pose any serious 
competition. 

« Tliere is very little support in C for 
good software engineering principles. 







C++ Will Be Strong Competition in Academia: 


® Object-oriented natnre of C++ makes it 
attractive,. 

• There is “downward'’ pressure in tlie 
curriculum for C++. 

• There is pressure from tlie textbook 
industry for C++ materials. 


Consider a Co-existence Sltrategy: 


• In a longer coLirse sequence, there is 
plenty of room for both languages. Ada 
would be pedagogically prefei able for tdie 
first language, 

• Consider comparative studies measuring 
the relative strengths of each language 
and effects of using botli in the 
curriculum. 


Additional Point: How Will Ada 9X Impact the 
C++ Issue? 


To Summaiize: 


• For use in academia, the strengths of Ada 
are its support for 

® object-oriented desi^pti, and 
• good software engineering practices. 


• Fund projects that are based on this view 
of the strengths of Ada, and tliat are based 
on 


• making object-oriented design and 

• software engineering principles and 
practices 

the cornerstone of the undergraduate 
sequence in programming and software 
engineering, beginning witli CSL 


• Fund long-term projects having the 
greatest potential for 

• demonstrating the effectiveness of 
this approach to the undergraduate 
curriculum, and 

• developing the corresponding 
materials for such a cuiriculum. 


• Seize the mitiati\^e now, or lose it C++!!

Used Ada in: Software Engineering, 

Operating Systems, 
Programming Languages, 
Introductory Ada course 


1. What actions can we take to make Ada one of the primary 
teaching languages within major colleges and universities? 


A. Give us 'Turbo Ada" . Invest funds to develop a PC based 
^ compiler as user friendly and capable as Borland C. 

- You are competing with C++’s support environment, 
need to be competitive with C++ in terms of tools, 
availability and price. 

- Compiler should have a debugger similar to Borland’s 
with the ability to step through source code line by line 
and inspect values of variables. 

- The compiler should have speed similar to Borland’s 

- implement various subsets of Ada if necessary 

- the into course should be as "Borland-like" as 
possible. 


Reasonable hardware requirements, so can be used in a 
University with minimal upgrade requirements (if any).

2 . Wiiat initiatives can we mount to incix^ase Acla’a aijpeaJ, 
adoption and i) 0 ])ularity witliiii the acadcanic coiTiinunity? 



A. Do not make Ada’s use required by law. 

“ Forcing people to do something just makes them want 
to oppose it on principle. 

- The reaso use Ada should be because it is the best 
language (l i> 




Fix the Softwa ? repositories. 

- Repositories need to house only tested, reliable Ada 
code. 


- Locating the components needed within a repository 
should be convenient, simple, fruitful . 


C. Develop Ada introduction teams . 

- Provide interested universities with a means for 
acquiring the necessary Ada progTamming exposure. 

- Need to combat the tendency of people sticking to what 
they already know, opposing change. 





o 


What investnicnts siioiild we make to increase the coinmercic 
use of Ada? 


A, Again, do not force Ada’s use. Ada needs to (and can) 
stand on its own merits. 


4. What steps can we take to increase to pool of entry level 
personnel with Ada skills, knowledge and experience. 

A. Industry demand drives this equation. Teaching schools 
need to provide their graduates v/ith skills that are in 
demand, where the iobs are.

Robert A. Willis, ,lr 
1 lamptoii (Inivcrsity 


Q)uestions: My Rcs[X)iiscs 

Pc,ssimislic Response 

There is nothing that can be done to inaease Ada's use signiliaintly in aaidemia and 
industry. 

Anything that would be attempted could be classified as "too little too late". 

There have been many mistakes made in the promugation of Ada It is impossible to 
overcome these mistakes, 'fhe Edsel was a superior product. Superiority in American culture 
has never been a key to success. 

1 have listed to many of the presentations and with notable exceptions (Phillip Miller and 
Timothy Long) nothing was said that hasn’t been said (over and over again) for the past 10 
years. Wliat was said is correct but irrelevant . 

The Ada community has missed the wir dow of opportunity which was open approximately 3 
or 4 years ago. Most C.S. professors were at least receptive to the atneept of using Ada in 
their respective curricular. They are not nearly so receptive now. 

C/C+H is bigger than Ada This language has monentum. Remember the C vs. Modula 2 
arguments during the CPM original MSDOS days? Where is Modula 2 now? 

Pragmatic Response 

The pessimistic response is one I'm sure no one wants to hear. But its outcome is hi^y 
probable. The widespread use of Ada will never happen. 

But negative response are counter productive, in an attempt to be productive and/or helpful I 
have prepared more pragmatic responses, short term 

1 Ada needs good public relations. Everyone in the Ada community must show (prove) 
that Ada is the superior product. 

2 DOD must do a better P.R. job (much, much, much better). You can't make people 
accept Ada you must convince them. 

No IX)D (in fact no Government) (XDntract or research grant should be awarded that 
docs not have tin Ada component. Academics require funds to do research.

The SICA program sponsors undergraduate and graduate summer- 
internships at Goddard Space Flight Center for the purpose 
of introducing space applications to the students. They 
typically use Pascal, C, and Fortran. 

Students could intern at sites which use Ada for various 
applications. 

- Publish some results showing Ada's safety and reliability 
characteristics. 

- Publish ail application areas 

- We have received calls about Ada courses

Ada DiiaJ-Use Workshop - Goveniment Panel Proceedings 


1.0 INTRODUCTION 

Tliis appaidix contains the findings, conclusions, and recommendations for the tliree 

questiotis tliat were posed to tlie government panel. Tliis data supports the siamnaiv’ 

of the government panel as described in the Ada Dual-Use Workshop Siunmary. 

2.0 QUESTICXV #1: VMiat actions can we take to make Ada the jiriniaiy tool for 

developir^ software systems within your government 
otganization? 

FINDINGS 

The following findings were the result of participant briefings: 

• Knowledge of Ada's benefits as a language and a software engineering tool is 
lacking. Program Managers believe there is a higher risk using Ada than otfier 
languages. 

• Many DoD Program Managers ignore the Ada mandate. 

• DoD has failed to ensure the development of appropriate higli quality Ada bindings; 
and they, in fact, do not exist. 

• The current Ada policy is unclear. It appears that if a Program Manager believes 
Ada is not cost-effective, then a waiver is not required. 

CTJNCLUSIONS 

Based on the session findings, the following conclusions were made by tlie panelists: 

• Information about Ada successes (defense and commercial) is not reaching 
government executives making programming language decisions. 

• The Ada mandate is not well communicated and adhered to througliout the DoD. 
Tliis provides a negative example to the software community as a whole. 

• DoD commitment to Ada ap[5ears weak, or at best, academic. 

• Robust, high quality bindings are needed for widely used standards, COTS products, 
and defacto standards. 

• We need to evolve to a single binding standaid witli multiple implementation 
capability.

RFm\1MENDATIONS 

The following recommendations were denved from the findings and conclusions listed 

above: 

• DoD should develop and collect standard metrics tliat show tlie relative cost, 
schedule, and quality advantages experienced in Ada projects. 

• OASD (C31) should recognize Program Managers of Ada intensive projects with a 
special one or two day annual conference that has as its keynote speaker the ASD 
(C3I). 

• DoD should collect Ada success stories in defense applications and publish articles 
in publications that reach MIS management and technical personnel (e.g., Business 
Week, Information Week, DatamatiorL PC Maga 2 dne, PC Week, Byte Magazine). 
(This recommendation is an appropriate response to question #2 as well.) 

• DoD should develop a video that describes the Ada policy, identifies programs 
using Ada, shows the meuics, teaches the lessons learned and describes available 
Ada help. The video should be disseminated widely, including industry, and be 
required viewing for all software managers in DoD. (This recommendation is an 
appropriate response to question #2 as well.) 

• A focused binding effort should be fostered which includes the following steps: 

- Identify candidates 

- Narrow choice among competitors 

- Stimulate comparative development effort 

- Publish specifications 

- Subsidize prototype implementation 

- Standardize appropriate binding specifications

3.0 QUIlSTION # 2 '. What investments can we make tn increase dn' conniereial 

use of Adji? 

RNDINGS 

The following findings were tlie result of participant briefings: 

• Most non-defense software developers (including universities) perceive Ada as a 
programming language solely for defense applications. 

• Among the general programming community, there; is not a high level of 
enthusiasm for Ada training and education. 

• DoD has not been proactive in urging vendors to de\ elop and provide Ada 
bindings. 

• Most colleges and universities can't afford the liigh cost of Ada tools. 
CONCLUSIONS 

Based on the session findings, the following conclusions were made by the panelists 

• Infonnation about Ada successes (defense and commercial) is not reaching industry. 

• Information about Ada is not reaching colleges and universities. 

• DoD needs to provide encouragement to the academic community and small 
business companies to implement teaching and training in Ada 

• DoD should motivate commercial product vendors to provide timely, fully 
functional Ada interfaces. 

• DoD should ease the process for waivers/exceptions for interface code to non-Ada 
applications. 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

The following recommendations were derived fi'om the findings and conclusions listed 

above: 

• DoD Ada-related events need stronger press coverage.

• A qualifying chiuacteristic for the new .AIIX) Director should be that he she have 
broad appetil and be able to relate to the entire softvviue coininiuiit>, not Just IXd) 
weapon systems. 

• OASD (C3I) should give a spot award ($500) to DoD authors of cUlicles about Ada 
in non-Ada specific press. 

• DoD should infonn colleges and universities of tlie availability of Ada tools through 
the Free Software Foundation. 

• DoD should continue to support and fund tlie Free Software Foundation, especially 
in tlie area of the Ada compiler witli Ada 9X enhancements. 

• DoD should donate older versions of Ada tools to colleges and universities. 

• DoD should promote Ada within the academic community (universities, junior 
colleges, high schools) as an excellent tool for teaching software engineering 
techniques. 

• DoD should promote/provide accessibility of compilers to educittional institutioas. 

• DoD should encourage private industry to offer a variety of Ada Paining courses. 

• DoD should emphasize Ada as the primary software language at all military 
academies. 

• DoD should involve tlie academic community in research projects regaiding 
software development problems and challenges. 

• DoD should prohibit the acqiusition of software applicatioas that do not have Ada 
bindings. 

- Emphasize tlie rigorous development of Ada 9X, A}ipendix M, "Interface to Other 
Languages". 

4.0 QUESTION #3: What can we do to increase Ada's a{){ieal, adoption, and 

^xipularity within your software conmunity? 

RNDINGS 

The following findings were tlie result of participant briefings: 

• The Ada community is a close icnit and frequently weafxms system orierited group. 
They currently don't comniimicale well witli the I^S community.

Acki IDiial-Use Workshop - Cioveninieiit Feuiel lAocccdings 


• Adii is not highly sup}X)i1ed by the DoD acquisition coniniiuiit\'. 

• Acquisition typically does not concern itself uith long tenn support issues. 

• Within DoD, "C" (and its variants) is almost a dominant language for researcli, 
prototyping, and even many new systeias. 

• The perception, outside and inside DoD, is that "playing Ada" is an all or notliing 
game - variants are not permitted; waivers are often the path of least perceived 
"cost"; tlie evolutionary process is ver}y' slow and witliout incentives. 

• The perception is tliat Ada tools lack the modem capabilities of otlier language 
tools. 

• Program Managers and PEOs are not motivated to consider the long tenn 
(maintenance) benefits of Ada. 

CONCLUSIONS 

Based on the session findings, the following conclusions were made by the panelists 

• DoD must package and communicate Ada 9X as the "Now" language. 

• DoD's Ada use policy and acquisition methods should dovetail with the way 
industry wants to sell Ada tools. 

• The acquisition process is not well defined or is out-of-date. 

• DoD commitment to Ada appears weak. 

• The DoD mandate and commitment is not well communicated or defined botli 
inside and outside of DoD. 

• Ada tools are not popular or widely used. 

• There is a need for quality, portable Ada tools across multiple platforms and 
environments. 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

Tlte following recomniCTidations weie derived fiom die findings and conclusions listed 

above: 


• EdD must market A.da 9X more stiongly than is cuirenlly l)eing done

Ada Diial-Use Woikshop - Government Piuiel h oceedings 


• DoD Should ensure Ada compilers cuid libraiies aie included in "lunbreUa" 
hardware and software procurements. 

• r.)oD should create a fonnal software engineering education and Paining prognim 
for acquisition personnel. 

• Program management plans must consider long temii system goals and program 
management should be graded against their criteria. 

• DoD should establish central control over mandates and waivers, and charge that 
entity with enforcement of and consistency among tire Ada rules. 

• DoD should inform colleges and universities of Ada tool availabilit\' and 
distribution sources. 

• DoD should ensure that quality Ada tO(5ls are available to adequately support the 
software life cycle process. 

• DoD should ensure tliat Ada's support environment is comparable to otlier 
development environments. 

« DoD should ensure that a lich set of tools and reusable components exist for 
Ada 9X when it is released

Observations on the Use of Ada Within DOD 



■p, ...» » ■ I . . . . . . - .. -1 1 .. . <^ 1 ., . y . 


MiTr« 















COBRA DANE Example 



« Raytheon estimate: cost $40M to do software in Ada 

- Raytheon had no prior Ada experience, and wanted to use 
JOVIAL 

- Estimate was $17M MORE to do software in Ada 

• Government insisted on Ada 

- Raytheon teamed with TRW for the software 

• TRW bid $25M to do software component in Ada 

• Software development completed ahead of schedule and vhthin 
budget (280K SLOG In 24 months, $25M) 

• Schedule predicts IOC will occur 3 months early 


Observation: Ada successes are considered *100 good to be true”! 




Changes in Systems Development 


• Technology trends 

- Software as minor component -> Software as major 
component -> Software IS the system 

- Increases In hardware performance 

• Industry caught up with DOD requiiements 

• Software Engineering trends 

~ Methodologies 
~ CASE 

- Sofhvare process 

• Now system development is integration, not development 

~ Open Systems 
~ Reuse 

~ Interoperability/lnterconnectivity 

- System Architectures 



















Ada and Open Systems 



MTTRE 















Wither Ada? 

(Concluded) 

• Commercial acceptance of Ada depends on many things 

- Cost (compilers MUST get cheaper/better) 

- Interfaces to other products (bindings, again) 

- Political Correctness/Perception 

• Commercial acceptance of software engineering is real 
problem 

• Ada Is quite acceptable as a 000 niche language 

‘^Ada isn’t intended for all kinds of software development, ^ 
just software that you intend to use and update for more than 
one year, software too complex to be written by one person, 
software that must handle concurrent tasks, software that is 
readable, portable and reusable, and by the way, software 
that must be highly reliable and perform welL” 

“Everything else can be written in C.”

Acquisicion System Program Protection Plan Explanation and 
Protection of Essential Program Information, Technologies or 
Systems (EPITS) 


1. Assistant Secretary of the Army Research, Development and 
Acquisition (ASARDA) nas recently implemented the Army 
Accfuisition Svstems Protection Program. The amount of time 
cecveen the fielding of a new U.S. weapon system and the enemy 
fielding a counter system or copy has been steadily eroding to 
the point where enemv counters are fielded almost simultameously 
or even before the U.S. weapon system fieldings. In addition, 
friendly allies have been selling copies of U.S. weapon systems 
based on key U.S. technologies thereby diminishing our market 
share ajtd decreasing cur economic advantage. 

2. As a result of the above, DoD has mandated that ail 
Acquisition Category IC and IP programs must have an Acquisition 
Progtram Protection Plan (Acq PS") updated at each railestcne. The 
Acq P3 identifies crttical or unique technologies of a system and 
states how they will he protected. The critical or unique 
technologies are called EPITS. 

3. The EPITS are not necessarily classified but since they are 

what "maJces it tick" they must be protected- The Acq P3 provides 
guidance on how the EPITS are to be protected. Since the AFATDS 
Acq P3 will not be ccmpleted for a few months, t.his memo will 
provide interim, cursoiy guidance for protection of the AFATDS 
EPITS: Since software has unique properties making it difficult 

to separate EPITS from the entire AFATDS software program, the 
following are instructions for protecting the entire AFATDS 
program and consequently the AFATDS EPITS : 

a. Access to the AFATDS source code should be liiiD.ted to 
personnel who have direct involvement with AFATDS or those who 
have been authorized access by the PM or DPM AFATDS. This should 
include remote on-line access. 

b. Do not allow copies of either part or the entire AFA'TDS 
source code to be made or taken from t.he area.

November 8, 1993 







BackGround 


Based upon prior work experience 

- DBMS development 

- Database applications 

- Artificial Intelligence 

These are my personal opinions, not those of 
my employer 


“Technical” 

Need Ada 9X desperately 

- Too many missing features in Ada 83 , e.g. inheritance 

Bindings 

- UNIX, X, SQL 

- Needed five years ago 

“Visual Ada” 

Needed - Create acceptance of Ada on personal 
computers 

- Includes large class libraries and visual programming 







Language 


Current “business” applications are being 
built using 4GUVisua! Programming 

3GLs (e.g. C/C++ and Ada) are being 
relegated to “systems” programming and 
“extensions” 

Ada must be usable as an extensions 
language 

- eliminate (or minimize) run-time library requirement 

- callable from other languages without an Ada “main” 


“Standards” 


Most of computing community proceeds 
ahead of standards 

- C++ de facto standard, not yet official standard 

Ada community lags behind standards 
development 

- Must standardize before software/tools become available 

Need to encourage innovation with Ada 

- E.g., accept language “extensions”

tool for developing software systems within your 
government organization? 

• Whal investments can we make to increase the 
commercial use of Ada? 

• What can we do to increase Ada’s appeal, adoption

19-20 October 1993 


Institute forOelense Analyses 


Why worry about Ada bindings? 


• So that there are not multiple Ada bindings to a 
standard or to a product — X, for example 




So that there is some consistency to the Ada 
bindings (“thin” versus “thick” bindings) — early 


POSIX 


19-SO Odober 1993 


Inslllute lot Delensfl Analyses 







Why a single Aaa oinaing < 


• So that implementors have only one binding to 
implement — not several 

• So that tool vendors can develop their tools once, 
then port them to different implementations of the 
Ada binding 

• So that end-users can develop their applications 
once 

• So that training for Ada development will be more 
uniform and thus less costly 


1G-2D October 1993 Inslllule (or Delenaa Analyses 


Ada Bindings 


• Investigate Ada bindings to popular products and 
standards, such as those mentioned earlier 

• If multiple Ada bindings exist, narrow the choice 
down to (hopefully) one 

• If no Ada bindings exist, encourage cocpe^ation 
among interested parties to defln.! an Ada tending 

• Once the Ada binding exists, publish the Ada 
package specifications widely and publicly, and 
encourage the market to supply package bodies 

• Perhaps, in some cases, standardize the Ada 
package specifications 


19-20 October 1993 


irislitule lor Defense Analyses 







Ada Bindings 


• Find out what people would like Ada bindings to 

• Go beyond the Ada community and get other parties 
interested in the development of Ada bindings — 
commercial vendors, standards groups, ... 

• Increase the number of other products/systems that 
are accessible to Ada programs 

• Many vendors now deliver products with other 
language bindings, can we ask them to deliver Ada 
language bindings, too? 

• Increase coordination with standards groups to 
influence their development so that Ada bindings 
can readily be defined 

• Promote Ada bindings 


19-20 Oclobpr 1993 


Inatliule for Defense Analyses 


Ada Bindings 


• Investigate the “right” way to develop Ada bindings 
by looking at: 

- Ada binding technology: what Is the best way to define an Ada 
bindin.g? 

- How to go about developing an Ada binding 

- How to move from another language binding to Ada 

- "Thin” versus “Thick” Ada bindings 

• Make existing Ada bindings better, expecially for 
Ada9X 

• Try to affect products during the development stage 

• Try to affect standards during the standardization 
process, not after they have become standards 

• Publicize who Is producting/provIding Ada bindings 
and what are they interfacing to

Academia 


Having Ada bindings to the popular products 
and tools, especially on PCs and workstations, 
will infTease interest in Ada by instructors, 
thus making it a primary teacning language at 
major universities; this will also increase the 
poo! of entry level personnel with Ada skills.

Government 


Having Ada bindings to existing program 
building blocks will increase the adoption and 
popularity within DoD and other government 
organizations, thus making Ada a primary tool 
for developing large software systems. 


19-20 October 1993

Industry 


Having implementations of Ada bindings 
ubiquitous and inexpensive can help Ada 
become the preferred language for developing 
software, increasing its appeal and popularity 
within industry.

Hardware and Software vendors 


Having Ada bindings will help to increase the 
market for Ada products and services beyond 
the defense community, thus investing in the 
development and possibly the standardization 
of Ada bindings will increase Ada’s commercial

Marine Corps AdaSAGE Experiences 


Presented by 


Major Gerald A. DePasquale 

Marine Corps Computer and Telecommunications Activity 

Quantico, Virginia 


Request 


$1 Million Annually to Support AdaSAGE 


[Commitment will pay large dividends.] 







Lesson 1 


Marines love AdaSAGE. 


[AdaSAGE is a Marine Corps standard development tool.] 


Lesson 2 


AdaSAGE is good - Ada is bad. 


[To use AdaSAGE effectively, 
introductory level Ada training is required.] 








Lesson 3 


AdaSAGE means 

"you get a meritorious service medal" 


[Using AdaSAGE, new Ada programmers are 
productive in six weeks vice six months.] 


L esson 4 


AdaSAGE means 
"you get a vacation" 


[AdaSAGE reduces our development time by 50%.] 








I A'SSOI! 5 


AdaSAGE means 

"you get mo money, when you lie about your effort" 


[ AdaSAGE provides 55% of our applications.] 


Les son 6 


AdaSAGE means 

"commercial DBMS vendors must get serious about Ada" 


[AdaSAGE often outperforms commercial DBMS products.] 







Lesson 7 


AdaSAGE is 

"a deadly weapon in the hands of a high school graduate". 


[A high school graduate 
+ one month of Ada training 
+ two weeks of AdaSAGE training 
= productive programmer.] 


Lesson 8 


AdaSAGE Video Training means 
"you don’t have to train that stupid bastard" 


[Beginning AdaSAGE Video Training Materials 
provide effective refresher and introductory education,] 






I esson 9 


AdaSA(=;E 


Video Training also means 


'you catch up on your sleep" 


[You must stay awake when yiewing the Adyanced AdaSAGE 
Video Training Materials to glean valuable adyanced 
knowledge.] 


AdaSAGE means 


"you can let the students do all the work" 


[AdaSAGE can be used as an aid 
to teach software engineering teams.] 






Lesson 11 


Enhanced AdaSAGE means 
"everyone will love you" 


[Marine programmers have rewritten applications developed 
back in late 1980s, adding new functionality made possible 
by AdaSAGE enhancements, while simultaneously reducing 
SLOG, increasing execution speed, reducing executable size, 
and improving maintainability.] 


Le sson 1 2 


AdaSAGE Users Group means 
"if you have money, you have a friend" 


[Enrollment in the AdaSAGE users group is worth the 
investment. Technical difficulties, wrestled with for days, 
have been solved over a single phone call.] 


Lesson .13 


AdaS4GE management means 
"you own the system" 


[Enhancements requested by the user community get 
completed.] 


Lesson 14 


AdaSAGE means 
"damn those compiler vendors" 


[The Corps has purchased compilers explicitly for use with 
AdaSAGE only to find out that the new' compiler release is 
incompatible with AdaSAGE.] 








Lesson 15 


Badinoutliiiiji AdaSA(iL 
"can jiet you killed" 


[Captain Hernandez, IRMD Albany, challenges all detractors 
to talk to him before claiming AdaSAGE can not meet their 
general purpose data base management programming needs.]

PRESENTING OBSERVATIONS OF ADA BOARD 

DEC 92. APR 93 



PERCEPTIONS AND REALITY USING Ada 


Major categories 

A. Economic/ business issues 

B. Education/ research Issues 

C. Systems integration problerr.s 

D. DoD Ada mandate, acquisition policies 

E. Technical issues 








ECONOMIC/ BUSINESS ISSUE: 
EXPENSE 



Issues: 

Ada compilers too expensive, large, and complex; 
development costs too high 


Ada compilers are large and require more resources than 
compilers for traditional languages, e.g. "C" 

Ada users develop on large projects that demand 
additional expensive tools to achieve optimum 
productivity 

Operating costs to develop a first system are higher for 
Ada, particularly as a result of the lack of trained 
personnel at all levels. Situation improves drastically, 
however, v^/itli increased training of personnel 



RESPONSE 


Compiler vendors will indeed have to invest large amounts of 
resources 

However, comparable transition to C++ from C will be large as 
well. Retooling and retraining for this transition is expensive 
for firms using C on large projects. 

Object oriented features of Ada 9X eliminate claims of 
superiority by C++ 

Maintain standardization effort using 9X via the international 
standardization route 



ECONOMIC/ BUSINESS ISSUES 


Issue 

Response 

F^ouso of Ada 

American firms consider productivity 

programs is not 

gains through Ada reuse a competitive 

meeting 

advantage - do not want to highlight 

expectations 

The Japanese have 
publicized 
success with 
significant levels 
of code reuse, 
but the US has 

not 

advantages of Ada 



ECONOMIC/ BUSINESS ISSUE 


Issues 

Response 

Compiler vendors 

Size of Ada market is small relative to 

are not marketing 

C++. Ada vendors tend to 

Ada sufficiently. 

concentrate in small niclie areas of 

This is claimed in 

the market. Greater flexibility and 

relation to 

technical interest associated with 

j marketing ot C++. 

Ada 9X should offset this trend. 





EDUCATION/RESEARCH ISSUES 



Issue Response 


Ada should be used 
byIhe research 
communily 

Researchers have investments in tools 
that facilitate use of other languages 
Lack of incentives to conduct research 
in "new*' language, esnecially w'hen 
already comfortable using C or 
FORTRAN 

Financial incentives 
for Universities 
to use Ada 

AJPO/DARPA initiative for Ada 

introduction via software-engineering 
courses 

Learning curve for 
first use in 
education 

Professors concerned about steep 
learning curve to bring into curricula 
Easy to learn - rnore difficult to leach 



EDUCATION/RESEARCH ISSUES 


Issue 

Response 

Ability to deploy 

Large startup costs of several million 

limited resources 

dollars pe- year 

to optimize 

Ada require: more powerful or at least 

introduction of 

as large amount of memory to 

Ada into 
education 

populate laboratory 

process 


Transition to Ada 

Research lends to be done in other 

technology from 

languages 

research to Ada 

Principal investigators on DoD 

applications 

contractors need to have incentives 

[ 

for doing research in Ada 

















EDUCATION/RESEARCH ISSUES 


Issue Response 


Must transition 
from prototypes 
into production 
using Ada. They 
currently tend to 
be written in C/ 
C++/Lisp 

Transition from prototype to production 
seems to be enhanced; language 
remains the same 

Overhead of using 

Ada is too large 
for teaching 

Designed for large-scale systems; 
using Ada with small classroom 
examples sometimes not appropriate 



SYSTEM INTEGRATION PROBLEMS 


Issue 

Response 

Ada weak in large- 

Many of the characteristics of Ada, 

scale systems 

which make if suitable for ttie 

integration. 

development of large systems, make it 
suitable for the integration of largo 
systems: 

Ada's encapsulation and modularization 
facilities improve the reliability and 
simplify the niaintenance of large 
systems, regardless of whether they 
are implemented using development 
or integration strategies. 

Ada’s implicit enforcement of sound 
software-engineering princif)ler. like 
strong typing have the effect of 
ensuring fhaf the interlace 
assumptions of the subsystems are 


not violated. 






DoD Ada MANDATE- ACQUISITION POLICIES 


Issue 

Procurement 
praclic.-'s 
incompatible with 
Ada benefits 


Response 

Financial arguments for using 
Ada are based on lifecycle cost 
savings, while procurement 
practices emphasize front end 
of the lifecycle. Benefits of 
Standardization and Logistics 
issues were primary criteria for 
moving to a standard 







DoD Ada MANDATE- ACQUISITION POLICIES 



Issue 

Response 

Scope of ('lanciafe 

Original application domain was for 

perceivoci as 

embedded systems 

being loo broad 

No single language is suitable loi ail 


conceivable application domains 

UK ministry of Defense docs not 

"mandate" any language, but requires 
validation and evaluation of 
compilers to suit needs of project 
office -- 

Result: very few projects bid 
without specifying the Ada 
language. 

UK Defense Industry largely supports 
the language 

Require validation of other non-Ada 
languages as well 



TECHNICAL ISSUES 


Issue 

Response 

Ada Is inferior to C/ 

Research proves otherwise: 

C++ 

Ada vs C+ + 


Ada 9X vs C++ 

Ada not best 

Ada has proven successful In Al and 

technical choice 

real-time applications 

lor all problems 

Support lor distributed/ parallel 


processing untested 

Bindings slow In 
coming 

ATiP Is helping

Ada Dual-Use Notes 


Jack Garman 

NASA Johnson Space Center 


• Loosen up the rules (especially w.r.t 
upward compatible extensions) 

• who wants to build something they can’t 
"improve" (industry, other gov’t, research, 
etc.) 

• "if it works, don’t fix it" but if it works its 
obsolete 







• Subsidize (foster, support) libraries and 
buildings 

• former is another/special form of reuse 

• latter speaks to reality; heterogeneous 
systems and away from egocentrioity 


• Tell us (outsiders), unbiased, what Ada 
has done for DoD! (study, review) 

• failures & issues as well as expected & 
unexpected benefits 

• it might help DoD reassess, redirect, get 
its "house in order" w.r.t. Ada 









Why don’t we use Ada (more 
than we do)? 


• We don’t know how to manage studies on a 
large scale (across “stove pipes") 

• It is weak in heterogeneous environments 
(New sys; COTS & reuse; legacy; increment 
re-engineering) 

•Weak Areas (tools, cost, real time...) 

• It’s just not "in" (popular) (egocentric, DoD 
only)

November 8, 1993

Defense Mapping Agenc\' 

CREDENTIALS: 

I liave 30 years software experience - none in Ada. 1 don't know what an Ada statement 
looks like (ends tvith a semicolon?). 

I work in an agency of 7500 employees -- all of whom don't write software. 

We make maps - we don't write software. 

We don't ftmd 6.1 and 6.2 research and development initiatives at all. 

We wan software that works and is cost-effectively maintainable. 

All our software needs are taken care of by contractors. Maintenance is provided by 
contractors, too. Actually we do have about 200 programmers who do a variety of small 
programming maintenance tasks, but not in Ada. 

I don't really care "vhether Ada is the language of choice or not, but if 1 did, I'd have at least 
three reasons: 

1. I believe you believe Ada is worthwhile, and I believe the business case studies. 

2. I am responsible in DMA for ensuring DoD Ada policy is implemented. 

3. It's die law. 

With this background, I thought I could provide a different view of needs of Ada, and why 1 
think it's important to improve Ada's appeal within the software community. Along the way 1 
will comment on your three specific questions. 

I want to talk in two areas: 

1. Problems we are facing at DMA 

2. Comments on what I've heard here so far and some recommendations (or perceived 
needs). 

Desenption of DPS system. 

- Ten year development 

- Seven million LOC with 900 KLOC Ada 

- Not critical life-dependent 

- 60,000 embedded software errors 

- Suca^ss but charging requirements 

* Ada seems to be more aist effective to maintain, but we haven't made an etfon to capture 









significant metrics. 


Real problem is to understand tools and techniques for sotlware con\'crsion/recngineering int(') 
Ada. (These could he 4GL Ada generators. ) 

Fund R&D initiati\'es in these areas if they don't e.xist. 

Provide and advertise central, well-advertised location lor inibrmation about Ada tools and 
techniques (Ada generally). 

- Ada Information Clearin^ouse? 

- Internet "central site" repository? 

Comments on three questions: 

Many good comments from all presenters, but 1 really liked Judy Keman's recommendation, 
and I support all of them. They were thoughtfiil and reasonable to implement, and 
represented a good summary of others' comments. 

Regarding question 1 -- Making Ada the primary tool 

- Perception problems hae need correcting 

- Ada success stories 

- BYTE/MacUser/Govt Computer News... 

- Real problems providing excuses for not using Ada mast be solved 

- Incentivizing PMs to worry about life-cycle costs 

- Disincentivizing PMs to ignore Ada 

- Mr. Paige mast stop permitting highly-placed DoD employees from 
disparaging Ada publicly 

- Clarifying I)oDD 3405.1 regarding tlie "one-third" threshold 

- Re-engineering needs must be addressed — suspect tliere's a lot of code ripe for re¬ 
engineering into Ada 

- If there, need to publicize, make available 

- If not there, neeti to fund R&D to develop 

Regarding question 2 -- Increasing commercial ase of Ada 


- 1 don't care about this 

- "Commercial use" mcaas to me what vendois ase to develop C^''TS packages 
1 can buy 

- Not my worry' -- market will detennine what hapfxras and we shouldn't try' to

1 have been invited to this panel as a "government" participant, but actual!)' m\' background 
spans the academic, vendor, and del'ense industrs' communities as well. So, in the interests ol 
tmth in advertising, I should let you know that 1 began my career as an academic, doing 
research in language and compiler theory, which I continued at Bell Laboratories. In late 
1980, Ada was on the horizon, and I became Technical Director of CSC's Ada Integrated 
Environment Phase I effort for the Air Force. In 1982, I co-founded Verdix Corporation, 
served as Executive Vice-President, and managed the Ada Products Division. During that 
time I was also elected Treasurer of the ACM’s Special Interest Group on Ada, \vhich had 
grown to about 4,000 members. By 1987, Verdix had become profitable, but I became 
convinced that its continued success was essentially dependent on the strength of DoD's 
commitment to Ada, and that commitment was wavering. So I took a vacation—became a 
lawy/er, and practiced bid protest law for several yeans. I also founded, and am now chairman 
of I^gma Systems Corp., which has been licensed by the Software Engineering Institute as a 
vendor of software process assessments. Today, however, I am addressing you as Director of 
the Tax Systems Modernization Institute, an FFITDC that w'as established earlier this year by 
IIT Research Institute to advise the Internal Revenue Service in the areas of strategic 
planning, acquisition, and technology assessment, related to the ongoing program to 
modernize the nation's tax systems. I should emphasize at the outset, tliat the views 1 express 
are my own, and not those of Verdix, SIGAda, fTagiua Systems, IIT Research Institute, the 
IRS, nor the American Bar Association. 

This is the first Ada-related conference that I have attended in about seven years, and I have 
to confess that I feel as if I have entered a time warp. The same people are here - albeit a 
few years older and a few years more cynical — but the conversations and the central issues 
have not changed one bit. The topics of today are precisely the topics of 1986; "when is the 
DoD redly going to enforce tlie Ada mandate?" and, "what can we do to increase the use of 
Ada in the commercial sector?" It is both amazing and depressing to see how little real 
progress has been made in the Ada community, given the very real strides that have been 
made elsewhere in the computer industry. 

I believe this lack of progress can be directly attributed to four factors. And I am going to 
address each of these because they provide us with valuable lessons learned, they identify 
mistakes that we cannot afford to repeat, and they ser/e to guide our investments for the 
future. 

Firs and foremost, DoD has simply not enforced its own Ada mandate, 'fhe history of the 
Ada program is replete with waivers, ITie public perception is that by granting such waivers 
the DoD has demonstrated a lack of courage in its own convictions. Without such courage, 
DoD can have no rational expectation that Ada will be adopted commercially. I was 
particularly heartened yesterday to hear General Paige state emphatically - and this is a quote 
- "I am going to enforce it." Mandates are easy to write, tlicy are only words. Enforcement 
is quite another matter, 'fhis commitment to enforcement that I heard yesterda)', if effective, 
is a substantial and absolutely necessary step to the promotion of commercial use. 1 should 









add, however, that ihe enfbreeinenl mast he per\'asive. Il’-ere shoidd lie a miuidalon IXd) 
l-'AR elaase in ever)' solicitation, in ever>' contract, that requires all code tt) he developed in 
Ada. No exceptions should be made lor Small Business Innovative Resairch programs, lor 
ARPA programs, or lor universiW research grants. Insletid of bemoaning the lact that the 
research community has not imibraced Ada LKd) can and should simply require that Ada be a 
prerequisite for all DoD-sponsored research. Moreover, DoD should further insist that c\'er\ 
item of software it purchases; — whether source code or object c<k1c — must be written in Ada. 
Imagine what would happen it' DoD truly enforced the Ada mandate, and refused to buy any 
operating system, any word processor, aiy spreadsheet, unless it were written in Ada. 

Second, DoD's investments tn Ada technology have actively discouraged the condor 
community. I remember back in 1983 or '84 when we were raising money for Verdix and 
developing our compiler, the Army announced that it was going to make the ALS compiler 
available for free. Needless to say, our investors expressed some concern. Fortunately, 1 was 
able to allay their concern i.vith the observation that no software tool developed and 
distributed under Govemm(mt contract had ever been much of a success. Unfortunately, it 
took the Army several more years, and untold tens of millions of dollars, before it abandoned 
the ALS as a failure. The other services made the same mistake — the Air Force with the 
AIE, and the Navy with the ALS/N. In stark contrast, those vendors wlio developed their 
Ada compilers without the benefit of DoD contracts produced significantly better software 
and garnered most of the market, all at a small fraction of what was spient on the DoD- 
sponsored efforts. In technology, the proper role of Government is to establish standards, not 
to compete with private industry. DoD did an excellent job of establishing the Ada standard 
and the associated validation suite. It has done an abysmal job of managing the development 
of Ada tools. Imagine where we would be today if those untold tens of millions of dollars 
had been invested in both universities and defense contractors, earmarked for the acquisition - 
not foi the development - of commercial-off-the-shelf Ada tools. 

Third, DoD has failed to adequately assess and advertise the significant life-cycle cost savings 
that we all believe are obtainable with Ada. We have all heard anecdotal evidence of such 
cost savings. But even such limited evidence rarely makes it into the popular or trade press. 
Adequate funding must be provided to organizations such as the Ada Joint Program Office 
and Software Engineering Institute to collect in a systematic fashion data demonstrating the 
cost savings of .Ada, and to perform and promote studies based on that data. While DoD 
must continue to enforce and reinforce the Ada mandate wafriin the defense community, 
ultimately the commercial world will adopt Ada only after it is convinced that Ada will save 
money. 

the foregoing factors have all addressed what DoD can do to rectify its pas mistakes. My 
fourth and final factor places some of the onus on industry. That is people resist change and 
therefore large numbers of short-sigjited people who market Ada training have been able to 
convince the community that Ada caanot be; used without weeb if not months of training in 
the proper u;e of the language and in the use of modem software engineering practices. I 
have heard some of these people despair that such training may likely not be effective for 
anyone over the age of 30. Ihis conventional view that enormous up- front training costs are 
required for Ada is hogwash, but continues to intimidate potential DoD and non-DoD users. 








Itoiti personal experience. 1 can attest that Ada is easier to le^an ilian I', il'onl)' lor tlie 
simple lact thtil Ada prograia) -ire niueh easier to read and di-buy ih;ui e' pa'igrams. Anyone 
with programming! experience in any third-generation language can obtain an adetjuate 
£;rounding in Ada in less than a w'rek. sell'-tauglit. given a text hook, access to a eom[viler, 
and proper motivt,lions. Certainly there is a time ajid a place for training in Aida ;.uid 
software engineering, but the Ada training community must stop scaring away its ciLStomem 
before they are even in the door. 

To atnclude, I would like to address Parti t Question #1: "Wliat actions can w'c lake to 
make Ada the primaiy Kxtl for developin vare systems ',\ithin your government 
organization?" fdy government organizat o L.e IlCS, and litis is not an easy question. The 
lies currently maintains millions of lines o. . le that comprise the tax system. Until 198.5, 
this was nearly all assembler axle; in 191 5, n vv modules began to be written in COBOL. 
Ibese millions of lines of code - by and lai ;? - work. In contrast tot the software programs 

we see in the defense community’, these mill is of lines of code directly impact eveiy' 
taxpayer in tliis county. Adso, each year tlic S devotes a considerable number of staff-iiours 
to incrementally revise this code to accomm le changes in the tax laws and regulations. 

Now I firmly believe that if all of this axli ' re to be entirely re-engineered in Ada, the 
risk-adjusted life-cycle savings would far < i^i the billions of dollars that such re¬ 
engineering would cost. But I can also g,i ee that Congress is not going to authorize 
these billions of dollars based on my pers iissessment of risks and life-cycle costs. For 
Ada to be adopted by organizations such u: die IRS, organizations that are saddled with 
substantial legacy software systems, you must come up with proof beyond a retisonable level 
of doubt that re-engineering in Ada will be cosl-efiective.

Recommendations for Expanding tiie use of Ada within DoD 


1. Either entbrce the Ada mandate or eliminate it. Don't assume the absence of waiv er 
requests means that DoD is using it. It may only mean that few people are requesting 
waivers. Many people ignore the mandate or assume it doesn't apply to them. Specilicalh’. 
since you don't have the staff' to check out evcr>' line of code being developed I recommend 
the following approaches: 

a. Identify every program under development at DISA. Perform a random audit of 
the software being developed. Ask to see the code. Do the same thing at DLA and 
the other defense agencies. Do the groups developing software in other languages 
have waivers or does the mandate not apply to them? Do something about your 
discoveries. 

b. Require that requests for training in C or C+-f only be approved for programs that 
have approved waivers, unless the mandate doesn’t apply to them. Check 1556s for 
compliance. Check 1556s for the last six months. 

c. Read the CBD. Perform word searches on Ada Software Engineering. Object- 
Oriented, C-H-, compilers. Identify DoD procurements that are requesting compilers 
for C-H-. Identify DoD software development efforts that indicate a language other 
than Ada. Do they have an approved waiver? Why is DoD issuing requests for tools, 
compilers and development in other languages? 

2. Clarify the Ada mandate. Who, explicitly, does it apply to? What 
organizations/applications are not included in the mandate? The numbei' of DoD people who 
claim that "the mandate doesn't apply to us", is astonishing. 

3. Broadcast Ada success stories. Promote technical seminars (perhaps about two hours in 
leng^) on a regular basis (quarterly'.^ that identify programs being implemented in Ada 
within an agency. Advertise the programs agency-wide. Encourage attendance. Show the 
metrics. Teach the lessons learnt. When warranted give the project (or individuals) an 
award or bonus, (for reuse, high productivity, high reliability, quick response?) Ada needs 
more visibility than just being mandated. Have General Paige or General Short sponsor the 
seminais and attend them (in DISA for example). Show that you really are committed to 
Ada. 

These recommendations are specific, inexpensive and easy to implement. Each one will show 
commitment, something that may be perceived as lacking in DoD. I will be happy to disciLss 
any of these ideas further. I can be reached at (301)924-0050.

The Ada Technology Incubator 

Tlie Ada community has benefitted enormously from the work of the Ada Software .'Uliance (ASA). 
It looks like die ASA’s recent Ada marketing campaign is poised to blaze new trails into the market¬ 
ing fronticc Tnis campaign coupled witli the general medias increasing curiosity with Ada9X should 
prove to be a market increasing siraadon. Indeed the ASA train is heading down the right track and 
it seems that the political and maikcdng end of this technology is definitely being cared for. 

The Ada Technology Incubator (ATI) is (or could be) an entity that focuses on increasing the Ada 
market and creating new Ada business through the direct injection of Ada technology into the com¬ 
mercial sector. 


The ATI could :: 





Act as a showcase for all Ada technology, without marketing pressures, on a level playing field 
Provide a channel for Ada vendors to offer tools at a reduced cost to qualifying ccmmcrcial efforts. 
Aid commercial efforts in porting products to a wider variety of platforms. 

Nurture and support new startup companies selected for their potential to increase the .\da market 
Give birth to a newsstand quality Ada magazine. 

Act as the needed seedbed and marketing medium for the software components industry. 


The ATI should be 


• Stocked and lughly supported by aH Ada vendors. 

• Funded by the govemment

Perspective commercial u.sers could benefit from a place that showcased a large selection of Ada 
technologies thus allowing a user to taste and test and without the usual sales pressures. Vendors 
would benefit from “displaying'* their wears in a hands on environment Potential users might be 
able to receive a few days of free Ada training as a result of several Ada training vendors offering 
one day ’’samples” of their cmriculum. Component manufactures could benefit from an environ¬ 
ment that can demonstrate first hand portability of theirproducts across a large number of platforms. 


Provide a channel for Ada v endors to offer tools at a reduced cost to qualify inzj:omm£ r^ia l 
The initial costs of adopting Ada technology can be qufr high, especially in a startup situation. All 
would benefit from putting low cost Ada technology into the hands of those would need it. Keep 
in mind that it is a very risky thing for an Ada vendor to venture out and drastically reduce product 
price in order to increase market share. If not successful the resulting decreased profit margin from 
the existing customer base could prove disai trous. What’s needed Ls a channel for vendors to offer 
their products at a reduced cost (without jeopajdizing existing profit margins) to customers who 
could otherwise could not afford to use Ada in their business ventures.

I see an entity like the ATI been used to spawn a news stand quality, highly circulated Ada magazine 
that would compete with the likes of Report and Journal of Object Oriented Programming, 
a maga 2 Line that would reflect the professionalism found in the Ada culture. The magazine could 
serve as an inexpensive marketing medium available to supporting vendors, as wcU as a medium 
for any Ada vendor. The magazine would help validate the Ada market and provide a sustained, pres¬ 
ence of Ada within the larger mainstream software marketplace. Tlic magazine could also serve as 
a sorely needed marketing medium for the software components industry, .software components 
could be advertised in the same medium as their supporting compilers. 

Aef - gtS’ Ihe needed see dbed and marketing medium for the software components industry. 
Developing components to run on as many platforms as possible is the ideal situation for the devel¬ 
oper, for the tool vendors it pays to have as many components available as possible that add value 
to their products. The ATT could serve both component developers and compiler vendors by provid¬ 
ing a rich environment where components can be developed, tested and validated across a large num¬ 
ber of platforms, a situation that would otherwise be impossible to achieve by the developer alone. 
The component developers could then use the previously mentioned Ada magazine as one of their 
marketing outlets. Tool vendors could guide the component developers by suggesting specific API’s 
and other components needed by their customers and that add value to their products. 

The ATT could be a shinning example of how vendors, although direct competitors, can join 
forces to increase market share and promote their common technology. 









Ada in Academia 


To any willing umversity, college, technical school, or high school, offer the following:: 

'Hie Acia cuiriculum t±at ARPA is working on. 

The Ada technology of their choice. 

The hardware if it’s needed, 

.And what ever training is needed to teach the teachers. 

Sdpulate that they must implement the curriculum, and at some time in the future must participate 
in a nationwide test geared to determine the effectiveness of tlte effort TJie test should take the form 
of a "National Software Engineering Competition", it should be team oriented, and offer prize 
money in amounts that can not be ignored. 

I’ve dealt with high schools concerning the subject of Ada and belive me the carrot has to be wrapped 
in a wad of bills. When it comes to furthering Ada in academia you have to make them an offer they 
can’t afford to refuse. 

Code Gue st 

Develop a (possibly multimedia) educational "adventure game” (hopefully in Ada) and call it say 
"Code Quest”. The object of the game could be to accumulate knowledge and correctly answer a 
large number of questions pertaining to Ada9X. The user would reach plateaus one of which would 
yield a ’token’ redeemable for an Ada compiler of their choice. You could make it so that reaching 
further plateaus would require the use of an Ada compiler and hands on programming experience. 
You should be able to produce enough material to make the courseware require ai least 40 to 80 hours 
of interaction before yielding its ultimate prize of say a 1000 to 5000 dollar scholarship for the first 
say 1000, to complete the quest

I am unable m attend the Ada Dual Use Workshop. These are the inpuc I would have 
.conveyed in person to the Industry PaneL 

Personal background relevant to the Workshop: 

• I have been working with Ada since 1980 when I was a member of the United 
Stares Air Force Academy’s first Ada research team. 

• I have been working wirh Ada full time since 1987. In the last six years I have: 

- Designed and built Ada systems for real-time and noa-real-tirne 
applications. 

Consulted on numcroos Ada projects. 

- Worked on the Ada/C-H-Business Case Analysis in 1991. 

- Tanght Ada classes as a TRW and CEA onph^ee and as a part-time 
instructor for two different colleges. 

• I have been very active in the Association for Carr^rating Machinery’s Special 
Laterest Group for Ada (ACM SIGAda). 

- I have been the organizaiioa’s secretary ftir two years. 

- I have cwi.ee been the Tutorial Chair for TRI-Ada, the major conference 
sponsored by SIGAda. 

- I am the Program Chair for the next TRI-Ada. 

• Summary: I am well informed of mnitiplc aspects of the Ada wcrl± 

- The technical side of the language and how to apply it to large softw^are 
systems. 

- Ihc teaching of the lan^ge and the issues aitrand it. 

- The politics and marketing of the language. 

1. What acnons can we cake to get Ada accepted as the prefcoed language for 
dcvclopmeat of software within your o rga nization? 

• My comparry and all the companies I have worked with respond to the 
customer's direction. DoD contractors will do whatever the DoD asks them to 
do. If the DoD says “do it in .Ada,” we will If ±e DoD asks “what language 
do you iccornrncnd?” we will probably recommend C or C-r+ (for reasons that 
are not essential to this disciEsion). Tins does not incau it is in DoD’s best 
intciest for os to use C or C-^. The Business Case Analysis detennined tiiat 
development costs are rougMy equal (within 10-15%) for Ada and C-J-t*. The 
data is not avaiLable yet for life cycle costs. I believe that Ada wO be proven to 
be more, cost-effective for maintenance than C or C4-f. 









Inputs to the Ada Dual Use Wonkshop

Page 2 


Recommendations: 

Enforce the Ada mandate. GDcrractors will respond to government 
direction. 

- Start to collect the data necessary to do a life cycle cost analysis of Ada 
and other languages. 

- Don't separate development contracts from maintenance contracts. Tnc 
key to winning a contract is lowest credible cosL By including the 
mamtcnancc cost with the development cost, I believe Ada wiU prove 
more cost-effective. 

• The standard accounting practices established by tiic Financial Accounting 
Sondards Board (FASB) require that the cost of developing software be 
expensed in the year the cost is acemed even though the software win be used 
as a capital asset in the femie. If the rule were changed so that the cost of 
developing software could be depreciated over the life of the product, it would 
be more economical to develop software. 

Recommendation: 

- Work with the F.ASB to change Financial Statement 86 so that software 
developed in a rigidly controlled, internationally standardized language 
can be depreciated rather than expensed. 

2. Wbat irrvestrnenis can we make to increase the commercial osc of Ada? 

- Tlie two biggest arguments I hear against Ada are that the existing software base 
is not Ada and tiiar it is hard to interface Ada to non-Ada prodnos. 

- Using the New York Universiry Gnu Ada Translaior (GNAT) project as 
a model Wd efforts to develop the faindhgs fiom Ada to the most 
conaroonly used products. 

- Caotimic to ftmd the development of the Ada 9X Appendix M, 

*Ta[a£ace to Other Languages." 

3- What can wc do to increase Ada’s appeal adoption, and popularity within your 

a^frwa re cn mTT m nity ? 

- The app^ of Ada is limited to developers with the wisdom to appicciarc the 
disdplinc diat Ada cnfon:cs on ihcir software. Not many developers appreciate 
that discipline. Therefore., the issue today is not to improve Ada’s app^ or 
popularity but to improve Ada's adoption. Given the desires and sophistication 
of most deveiopersi meet, adoption is promoted from above. 
Recommendations: 

- Emphasize the long term quality and life cycle cost of software products 
in the hrmal procmeraent cycle by procuring both the development and 
maintenance phases at the same time. 

- Enforce the Ada mandate. The feet that no Ada waivers are granted 
does not mean that Ada is being used exclusively, it means that the 
waiver is not requested and the lack of a waiver is not enforced. 

CcHitinue to fund the Ada Software Alliance’s marketing effort into the 
commercial sector empha.sizing the life cycle savings and higher quality 
software possible with Ada. 

- (Collect and promulgate the merries that prove Ada’s long term benefits 
in lowering life cycle costs.

Dept, of EleciricaJ Engineering ;uid Computer Science

Washington, DC 20052 

Dear ^Echael; 

Thank you for inviting rnc to comment on the state of Ada today. I looked at the four 
questions >’ou sent, and thouglit about how to answei' them I realized tiut my answer to each 
of them was the same; 

"Increase the 'viability of Ada as a commercial programming language" 

As an adjunct professor in computer science for some local colleges and universities, I 
am not in a position to determine curriculum Iherefore, I am asked to teach courses that 
these institutions feel will attraa students (read "make money"). Tins is especially true m the 
continuing education comses that I normally teach. Since these courses are attended by people 
who want to improve their skills (usually with an eye to improvmg employment status), they 
are definitely market driven. After putting .Ada courses in the catalogs in past semesters, it has 
become ob'vious to me (and the colleges!) that the general prograatiming public has no interest 
in Ada training. .As a result, I have been informed by one university that these courses will no 
longei' be offered if there is no attendance m the spring semester. 

We can say all we want about the usefulness of .Ada as a teaching language (it's gr eat) 
zmd the uselessness of C C-— (tiiey suck), but unless people can get jobs progr amm ing m .Ada, 
it will remam a cunosity, not a viable programming language. The colleges c ann ot get 
enough people to teach the C C-^— courses; they are alvvavs full. A quick perusal of the 
Sunday watrrt ads wt” show .f - more jobs available m C/ C— than .Ada; m fact, .Ada is hardly 
mentioned. If you were a student trying to get a job in this tough market, which language 
would you choose? 

Given the above, what can be done about gettmg .Ada into the programming 
mainstream'!’ Step number one is that the DoD has to stop their two-faced treatment of .Ada. If 
the language is mandated, then it should be used almost c.xdusively. This is certainly not the 
case. In many projects, it is a gii'cn that .Ada will NOT be used; the mandate is totally 
disregarded. If the "champion" of the language has such mixed feelings about it, how can we 
e.xpecT any one else to wholeheartedly adopt it? I personally feel that this has a lot to do with 
the current commercial market. If I weis m tlic miliiary writmg programs and expeaed to get a 
civilian job when I left, which language would I want to be learning? (Hint: it isn't .Ada). 

Second, we need more publicity about .Ada. The Metcalfe article m InJ!bWorld was 
great; we need more like it. We need companies who have had commercial success witii .Ada 
to be more public about it V\'e need to be more visible at conierences and trade shows.

POSITION STATEMENT 

ORGANIZATION TYPE: FRDC 

The primary mission of the Institute for Defense Analyses(IDA) is to assist the 
Departme nt of Defense address important National security issues of both immediate and 
enduring concern. In canying out this mission, IDA has been involved in assessing tech¬ 
nology that enables the department to maintain military superiority. Suppon for the Ada 
program has been one of these enabling technologies. Now it is becoming clear that eco¬ 
nomic considerations are of imponance for National security as we are beginning to be 
involved in the development of National enabling technology statements. Our community 
of users are (I) in the R&.D business (2) policy or program, analysis business (3) managers 
of large military or busin; ; projects. I have paraphrased the questions asked of government 
panel participants to fit our organizational experience with these three communities of DoD 
clients. 

Question 1: To what degree is Ada encouraged/required by our DoD clients or by 
the in-house development staff? 

Our clients who are in the R&D business or policy/program analysis business have 
two immediate concerns, development cost and time-to-dcliver usable software. The pro¬ 
gramming language used is of very Utdc concern except that less programming is better 
than more. What is generally wanted is a “prototype” where performance is of less impor¬ 
tance than demonstrations of concepts, requirements, and simple tools for the user. The 
solution for these clients is usually COTS with minimal prograimming in C or Visual Basic. 
A client who is managing a large military or business project may or may not be interested 
in “prototyping” but, if prototypes are done they must be done quickly at minimal cosL 

The frequently heard conunent from our clients and our in-house staff is: 

“When we can buy a Turbo Ada compiler for S300, libraries of functions and bind¬ 
ings for another $100, then we will seriously consider using Ada for prototyping.”

DRAR' 


10 / 18/93 


Clients who do not prototype but are using Ada because of DoD policy are now 
being approached by contractors who arc riding the Object Onented bandwagon. Project 
managers are somewhat confused about OOD or OOP but they have been told that .Ada is 
incompatible with both. 

Recommendation: 

(1) Invest in the GNU Ada compiler (execution version) and make it available to 
anyone who will pay a nominal fee for its distribution. 

(2) Analyze the operation of a successful C/C-(-+ company (e.g. Turbo). Look at 
what they are providing (libraries), how its being priced and distributed, how it is being 
advertized, and product improvement cycles. Copy what they arc doing to produce “Turbo” 
Ada. 

(3) Focus software engineering education on project managers who need to be con¬ 
versant with Ada facts and latest fads in methodologies. 


Question 2: What can we do to make Ada the primary tool for developing soft¬ 
ware systems? 

The plain answer to this question is that there is no “silver bullet” but there are some 
policy practices that can help level the playing field. There has been a perception that 
because Ada is a DoD language it is the only one that has a compiler validation require¬ 
ment. The fact is that ail PTPS languages have compiler validation requirements and ail 
software that enters the Federal Govenunent inventory must have been produced by a FTPS 
language compiler that has curre/if validation status. This requirement is not being enforced 
or else we would not have software inventories for obsolescent versions of COBOL and 
FORTRAN, C and C-H-. 

Recommendation: 

(1) Revise DoDD 3405.1 to include the requirement for maintaining validated sta¬ 
tus for all FTPS compilers, or, 

(2) Issue this policy in some other appropriate form.

Question 3; What can we (BoD) do to increase Ada’s appeal, etc. for dual use? 

Some small things have been clone, to decrease the perception that Ada is a language 
that is designed for use only wiihi.n Defense. One of these actions is the recent MOU unth 
the Department of Commerce (NTST) by which Ada validation certificates carry bodi DoD 
and NIST logos. Another action was the declaration by the AJPO that the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability (ACVC; is in the public domain and exempted from expon controls. 
However, “advanced software environments” using Ada examples are sdll on the Miliary 
Critical Teclinology List (MCTL). Tlie whole policy of teclmology control is undergoing 
change ii .1 light of world-wide developments. It is an advantageous rime to ensure that Ada 
and Ada tools or re-usable software are considered as National enabling technologies rather 
than technology to be held close by only DoD and DoD contractors.

Proposal 

The Future Success of Ada 94 
19 October 1 993 

Although Ada S3 is an excellent language for a variety of application domains, it has not 
enjoyed commercial acceptance. Ada 94 offers system developers a current technology 
language with facilities such as object orientation which are in high demand. By considering 
the lessons learned from the history of Ada S3, Ada 94 may be afforded greater acceptance 
by the government and the commercial sector. 

After the initial excitement over the introduction of 4da 83, two important barriers to its 
acceptance as a full system development language became obvious. These were: 

1. The Ada compilers were not mature and contained errors and inefficiencies 
which were not present in commercial quality compilers for other languages. 

2. There were rarely any packages or tools available in the domains required by 
full system developers. It was after all, "just a programming language", not a 
development environment. 

Ada 94 is well designed offering modern structures and methods. It has been favorably 
compared against the C+ + language as a desirable language for large system development 
using object oriented programming techniques. With proper ground work, Ada 94 could be 
accepted as a viable full system development language upon ics release, and the experiences 
with its predecessor, Ada 83, would not be wasted. 

1. The current compiler vendors have years of experience in Ada and are 
improving their products. With this experience, and the paths paved by the 
GNAT compiler, the technology to produce commercially competitive compilers 
is available. If these compilers also offered a quality development environment 
and tools, they would be commercially competitive, and the resulting economic 
competition would provide incentives for further improvements. 

2. Ada 94 should be released with a rich set of reusable components (objects and 
clas.ses) which provide the developer with a useful development platform. With 
the incorporation of objected oriented methods, these tools should be designed 
to be further enhanced and complemented by the original developers as well as 
any commercial developer wishing to provide third party tools. Since AdaSAGE 
is one of the most widely accepted and successfully used development tools 
in Ada, and it is sponsored by the U.S. government, it could be enhanced to 
provide object oriented capabilities for Ada 94 which would promote immediate 
acceptance by the many programmers now experienced in its use. It could be 
made available at no cost to government and commercial developers to provide 
a rich set of tools and a basis for further development.

AdaSAGE is currently composed of abstractions implemented as modular packages and stand 
alone processors which provide a development tool set for application programmers. The 
capabilities of Ada 94 will be. utilized to recast the existing abstractions into classes. The new 
object oriented AdaSAGE would take advantage of reuse through inheritance and 
polymorphism. Associated tools would also be revised to present an extensible object 
oriented development paradigm. Insure compatibility with available standard contract 9X (94) 
compilers.

Abstract 

AdaSAGE i: an applicadoo development tool for Adn progranunen implemented as a set of Ada 
paclcages and a set of executable programs used as support utilities during application 
development and operation. Many questions have been asked regarding the characteristics of 
AdaSAGE (i-*^- B AdaSAGE relational?). Herein several such questions are posed and 
answered. 


What is the purpose of AdaSAGE? 

AdaSAGE was designed to provide tools and an environment for Ada pnogrammers to develop major non- 
ptDprietary systems completely in Ada which are as good as or better than systems developed using alternate 
methods. 

Who uses AdaSAGE? 

The SAGE system began at the INEL (Idaho National Engineering Laboratory) in 1982. In 1987, it was made 
available in the Ada programming language for use on U.S. Marine Gjips projects. S'mee then, it has been used 
by ail of the major services of the DOD (Department of Defense), the DOE (Department of Encrg;') and pr 'ate 
industry. It is available through a variety of distribution channels to both govenunent, academia and pnv te 
indtistry. 


Where can one get AdaSAGE?

AclaSAGE Notes 


Can AdaSAGE be used to develop large systems? 

Since AdaSAGE is wntten in Ada, it supports the developmcn'. of very large systems. In practice, it has been 
used for the development of small to very large systems, supporting both large program and capacity 
requirements. Some of the capacity constraints follow;

Are training and support available? 

Beginning, advanced and graphics tralring courses are available at the INHL or rt a requested locadoa if a 
sufficient number of snideats is available. The AdaSAGE Users' Group supports registered users with a technical 
suppoit line, new release upgrades, a bulletin board, a newsletter and other training and assistance. For more 
iofonnation, contact the AdaSAGE Users' Group at (208)526-0656. 

Is AdaSAGE maintained? 

AdaSAGE is supported by the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (a DOE laboratory) with funds supplied by 
the AJPO (Ada Joint Program Office) and other DOD agencies. A long term agreement is in place between cic 
DOE ani. DOD for continual support in the future. Woric is currently underway for conversion to other computer 
platfonus, open system architecture adherence, and other areas. 

Does AdaSAGE have a Data Dictioaary? 

A data dictionary contains the data structure (schema) and often other ancillary' information about tl-.r. data and its 
structure. AdaSAGE supports an independent data dictionary and a facility for defining, modifying, and 
reporting on this info rm a ti on. This capability allows many different applications to acce;>s the same data 
dictionary and provides physical and logical data independence as specified in rules 8 anc 9 of Codd's Rules. 

What security support is included in AdaSAGE? 

AdaSAGE provides many levels of security. Even though data integrity checks are a form of security and 
provided by AdaSAGE, they "/ill not be discussed here. Access security is provided by password protection at 
the database, relation (flat file), and the individual attribute (column) level. These are iefined wi thin the data 
dictionary and enforced throughout the system for both programmers and asers. Additional secuniv is often 
requmsd within applications. Many such applications have been provided using AdaSAGE with addition'^ 
protection through user tables which contain user identification information, statistical information, and network 
and system information concerning user logon identifiers and privileges.

AdaSAGE Notes 


Does AdaSAGE s^apport the development of relational data bases, 
and if so does it support Codd's rule*^? 

One of the many feature of AdaSAGE is its support for relational data base development. E.F. Codd, a 
mathematician, first defined the relational rules which were presented in a paper published in ACM 
romxounications, June 1970. Later, in 1985, he summarized a foundaiioa principle and twelve rules which 
should be adhered to by a relational system. He staled that a darahase system fulfilling at least half of these rules 
and having the capabilities eventually to fulfill ail of them can be considered relational. The following table 
indicates the adherence to these rules by AdaSAGE, ANSI SQL (the source for FIPS 127 and FTPS 127-1), and 
IBM's DB2 which is considered by Mr. C. Date of the Reiaticnal Institute to be the leading SQL representative 
data base.

Does AdaSAGE speak SQL? 

Speaking SQL usually refers to an RDBMS. Ada-SAGE is not an RDBMS. AdaSAGE is an application 
dev''lopmeat tool that provides facilities for creating an application specific relational data base. 

There are two aspects of SQL dialog to consider. First is listening to SQL and responding by executing the 
requested command. Second is issuing SQL to get a foreign system to execute some process on your behalf. In 
the first case AdaSAGE provides both an imbedded SQL technology and an interactive SQL system adapted to 
comply with ANSI-SQL DML Level 1. In the second case AdaSAGE does not provide any capabilities for 
creating SQL commands, but since AdaSAGE is a set of Ada packages there is no reason that a package could not 
be developed to do so. 

Does AdaSAGE support multiuser system development? 

AdaSAGE provides for both single user and multiuser systems. Both types of systems have been represented in 
fielded applications. A unique feature of the AdaSAGE multiuser system (MultSagc) is the distribution of not 
only the data to be shared by many I'scrs, but also the distributed processing concept where each user contributes 
his CPU to the multiuser database management and locking functions. This concept is used for LAN (local area 
network) type applications.

AdaSAGE Notes 


Are there audit trail and recoverability features in AdaSAGE? 

The capability to record all tnmsactians and roU forward from previous dates gives an audit trail and recover 
capability. These features arc often provided within d-na base management systems, and are provided witlt 
AdaSAGE as a logging option, bui seldom if ever arc they used in final applications because of the exce-vnve time 
and data storage requirements. An application using AdaSAGE may be developed to provide full or partial 
capabilities in this area using the Ada language and AdaSAGE provided packages. More often, applications 
regularly backup or copy cunent data to another device to provide data recoverability. As well, AdaSAGE 
provides a facility to rebuild or recover cunent data base informatioa in place. 

Will AdaSAGE interface to DBMS's? 

Neither Codd’s rules for a relational system nor ANSI SQL specifies the physical storage format of data. 
Logically, it must appear to be two dim ensional and is often refei-ed to as being composed of relations (or a less 
precise term, flat files). Each data base system, therefore, tends to have its own unique method of physical data 
stoiage. A method to move data between different systems is often required. There are some commonly used 
formats of files from which many DBMS's load and unload data. This is one method of interface between two 
DBMS's and is supported by AdaSAGE. With AdaSAGE, the Ada language may also be used to directly and 
much more quickly move data from a DBMS into an AdaSAGE relation or in the reverse direction. The only 
requirement is that the DBMS support an Ada interface. 

Is AdaSAGE a code generator? 

Currently there are no components of the AdaSAGE system that generate code. The application paradigm 
supported by AdaSAGE results in applications that are data driven. This data is contained in a data diedonary 
containing infonnation about the relational structure of the application's data, the application's user presentation 
and various other application specific informatioa. 

Are AdaSAGE packages reusable? 

AdaSAGE provides many Ada packages, ail of which are reusable. Many of them are independent and may be 
used within any Ada system without causing the inclusion of the data base or user interface facilities. These 
include libraries for sorting, data movement, binary operations, bit manipulations, graphics, .string manipulation, 
and others;. There are also packages which directly access the data base system and others which access the user 
.lnti_Tfacc facilities. 

AdaSAGE adheres to the concept of 'black box' modularity which emphasizes the reuse of code through data 
ecicapsulatioa and extensibility through inheritance. 

All of the provided Ada packages are designed to be understandable, useful and usable, and are loosely coupled 
and highly cohesive at their level of abstraction.

1.0 INTOODUCnON 

This appendix contains the findings, conclusions, and leconmiendations tor' tire three question 
that were posed to the Industrv' Panel. Tliis data supports the surrunruy of the iridusm panel, 
as discussed in fire Ada Dual-Use Workshop Summary'. 

2.0 QUESTION ^1: >\hat actions can we make to get Ada accepted as the preferred 

langic^e for development of software within your organization? 

nNDINGS (We Heard) 

The following findings were the result of participant briefings: 

• The mandate is weak, not consistently applied, and often ignored by our customers. 

• More case studies and global statistics which substantiate the business case for . Vda are 
needed. 

• More bindings (especially to standards like Windows) and COTS tools are needed. 

• Better education and training for managers and programmers (both Government and 
Industry') is needed. 

• Better marketing and communications are needed to promote and sell Ada. 

• Availability of Ada 9X tools, training, and implementation guidance needs to be 
accelerated to meet the window-of-opportunity within industry. 

• Incentives are needed both to defer cost and increase profit for those who demonstrate 
Ada excellence. 

• The means to make more effective use of reuse rejrositories is needed. 

• Educational use needs to be stimulated by permitting language subsets and supersets. 

• Pilot projects to demonstrate proof of concept of new ideas should be performed. 

• Adti should be incorporated into SEI Capability Maturity Model's Software Process 
Assessments and Software Capability Evaluations. 

• Tire industry' should be stimulated to develop and recognize core competency in Ada.

Ada Dual-Use Workshop - Industry Panel Proceedings 


(XKNCUJSIONS (We Think) 

Based on the session findings, the following conclusions were inade by the panelists: 

• Testimony supports the fact that Ada has been successful in mission-critical, sofKvaie- 
intensive systems within DoD and elsewhere. We should not comipt tliis support in die 
name of winning a popularity contest or by mo\ang Ada into a market it was not designed 
to support. 

• We need to shore up the perception of an eroding base for Ada within die DoD. 
Solicitations in mission critical systems which do not call for Ada should not be allowed 

• Our strategy should look towards coexistence rather than exclusive use. A coexistence 
approach with other languages such as C and C-H- based products (COTS and reuse) in 
their technically appropriate area of application should be evaluated. 

• Tlie "software engineering market" is very different from the "general software market". 
We need to focus on the market that Ada was designed for (the mission-critical systems 
area) and not be diverted to entering a highly competitive and price-driven marketplace. 

• The government needs to let good software contractors make money. 

• The government needs to make Ada excellence a competitive advantage. 

• The DoD mandate is not achieving its intended objectives. It is too flexible and doesn't 
have teeth. 

• The business case supporting the use of Ada is not well constructed and has not been 
communicated well to industry executives. There are not enough global statistics to 
substantiate Ada's excellence. 

• Ada has not been well marketed. 

• A continuing need exists for a broader-based education and training program for all le\'els 
of government and industry personnel. 

• Ax ailability of quality tools, bindings, and COTS products continues to he an impediment 
to adoption.

RECmiMENDATIONS (\ ou Do) 

In order to strengthen the niandbite, the following actions are tieeded: 

• Eliminate warier process for mission-critical systerns (close the door). 

• Reinforce DoD langaiage policy to include high integrity, R&D, and infonnation 
systems where life cycle cost issues are paramount. 

• Proride incentives in hiring during source selections for those linns who liave proven 
Ada capabilities and who practice an Ada mandate within their own internal software 
efforts. 

• Provide awards for DoD Program Klanagers and firms who demonstrate Ada 
coirpetence during contract perfonnance. 

• Have IG investigate compliance of major programs to public law and good engineering 
practices. 

• Refocus the Software Engineering Institute's programs to Ada. 

In order to develop a business case, the following actions are needed; 

• Capture success stories and lessons learned. Focus on why Ada was selected and vdiat 
benefits resulted. 

• Develop quantitative data on comparative performance (cost, scliedule, quality, etc.) of 
Ada on a life cycle basis in cot^peration with tlie propx)sed National Repository 
(Mosernann initiative). 

• Cooperate with existing efforts (SIGAda, Ada Software Alliance, etc,) to develop a 
business case white paper and briefing. 

In order to better market Ada, the following actions are needed: 

• 13efine the market and market needs for Ada within tlie DoD (Remember the concern 
oxer not nraking this a [wpularity contest.) 


• Improve the outreach by establisliing a marketing objective for tlie AJPO and a plan to 
realize it - reach out to professional scx;ieties, FFRDCs, trade associations, otlier 
goveniment agencies, universities, and indusUy', 

• Establish an executive Ixiard to act as a sounding board for ideas (reconstitute tlie Ada 
Ixiard). Ivlake sure tire j^^eople needed to move Ada from a technology-diix en to a 
maihet-driven strategy are on it.

In order to provide incentives, the followir.g actions aie needed lx; cf^nsidered 


• Permit tirrining and tool costs to 1)6 directK' ciiaiged to the contract. 


• Increase the Acki competence ol tlie accinisition staff (including their iffPdX's mid 
support contractors). 

• Provide advantages in competitive evaluations for Ada excellence. 

• IVovide incentives in award fee and incenti\'e fee contracts for the irse of Ada. 

• Permit software development enxironment assets to be earned as capital equipment to 
promote (rather tlian inhibit) invesnnent in quality environments such as Ada tools. 

In order to fill tlie continuing need for broad-based education and training, tlie following 
actions are needed. 

• Provide grants and other forms of assistance to liigh schools, universities, and colleges 
for Ada-based software engineering training. 

• Provide a teaching environment and low-cost axnpilers (free, if possible) for Ada- 
based software engineering training.

education. 

• Direct Service; schools (DSMC, etc ) and academies to offer Ada-based software 
engineerin,gymanagement curri cd um. 

In order to provide necessary tcxils, bindings, and COTS products, the following actions are 
netxied: 


' Perfonn a market survey t .r define the liigli return investments. 

• Enter into partnerships (CRADA's, TRF-''s, etc.) to jointly develop higli demand items 
on a cost-sharing basis (government talces limited rights, contractor gete marketing

RNDINGS O^eHeaid) 

The following findings were tlie result of participant briefings: 

» Tools and bindings (WINDOWS/PC first) were noted as die investments with some of the 
highest potential return. 

• The availability of Ada 9X tools, bindings and implementation supfX)!! needs to be 
accelerated to maintain the aura of ctirrency, 

• Education and trctining subsidies/grants to colleges and universities who teach Ada and use 
it in their research seem warratited. 

• Stnrtegic partnerships (with otnei government agencies, finns and universities) should be 
pursued. 

• Wide exposure/marketing investments are needed to ciiange image and create market push. 

• Research is needed to resolve Ada 9X technical issues and stimulate universities to teach 
Ada in both tfieir graduate and undergraduate curriculum 

• The development of Ada 9X superset/subset for education needs to be supported. 

• Financial incentives for businesses are needed to motivate them to renew their Ada 
initiatives. 

• Investments in ASIS (Ada Semantic Interface Specification) seem warranted in order to 
provide the means to interface Ada langu jge and CASE tools through a common 
repository. 

• Reuse needs to \k incenti\ized by resohing the management issues which act as tlie 
major inhibitors (daUr riglrts, infiastructure costs, organizational issues, etc.). 

• Sp'/iisorship of true dual-use programs are needed to enable small businesses to take D(.iD 
tecluiology and biild products s^'hich can be sold broadly to the private sector. 

• Gi\diig job preference to those witli Ada skills should be cxinsidered.

• A professional m;uket research linn should lx; hi'ed to understtuid the commercial 
marketplace and develop strategies for effective penetration. 

• 'Hie entry costs for Ada for educators and their students (costs for compilers, courseware 
development, etc.) should be lowered, 

• The development of a low cost, production-!e\'el Ada teaching environment for educators 
should be subsized. 

• Sharing data rights witli finns to lower costs for software development should be 
considered, 

CX)NCXL’SIONS (We Thirik) 

Based on tlie session findings, tlie following conclusions were made by the panelists: 

• Irtcreased DoD investments are necessary to achieve higher* degrees of commercial use. 

• The following investments seem to have potential high payoffs: 

- Bindings (interfaces to standards like X-Windows, databases and generators) 

- COTS products (standard packages like math libraries, etc.) 

- Marketing/IAonrotion 

- Tools (debuggers, linkers/loaders, design packages, etc.) 

-• Education and Training 

- Trade shows 

• A broader buy-in to Ada wdl help the OdD leverage its investments arrd achieve broad- 
based success. 

• Tire DoD and a3mrnercial markets are different; do not force Ada in system areas tliat are 
not appropriate for Ada.

RECX)MIV1ENDAnONS (\ oul)o) 

Tlie DoD should ensure there is an Acki market hy solidil>ing the existing base and \ ie\ving 
migration systems witliin DISA as a potential cpportiuiity for showcasing Ada. 

To develop a \aable Ada iiu'estment strategy-, the following actions are needed; 

' Take the results of the dual-use workshop and develop a prioritized plan which lavs out 
tasks, schedules, budgets and deliverables incTementally. 

• Acquire funding and go do it, 

• Provide quarterly feedback and reporting to t)Oth ASD (C31) and DISA, and an 
executive-level advisory board (company presidents and CEOs, university deans, and 
department chairs, etc.). 

The DoD should establish joint investmenls/strategic partnersliips witfi: 

- Other government agencies (DOT/FAA, NASA, DOE, NIST, etc.) 

- Universities/colleges 

- Industry/professional societies/trade associations 

- EXial-Use programs (NIST, ARPA, NIST, etc.) 

The DoD should make reuse commercially viable by opening the reuse libraries and 
stimulating technology transfer using the dual-use initiative. 

4.0 QUESTICKN #3: What can we do to inciease ada's appeal, adoption a nd popularity 

within your softw are conwmnity? 

FINDINGS (WeHeaid) 

The following findings were the result of participant briefings: 

• Make sure there are jobs for Ada professionals. 

• Institute cooperative initiatives with professional societies, trade associations, etc. 

• Stimulate research into Ada issues. 

• Provide more widespread exposure to the reasons why Ada was developed and wliat it can 
do for firms adof)ting it. 

• Expand the use of Ada into other government acti\nties. 

• Change accounting rules (FASB) to stimulate investments in Ad'.

• Make Ada more attractive by integrating it with tlie DoD reuse initiative. 

• Provide inexpensive tools and compilers. 

• Reconstitute the Ada Board as an executive ad\isory board. 

• Foster- consistency by providing positive communications. 

CXfNCLUSIONS (We Think) 

Based on the session findings, the following conclusions \%cre made by the panelists: 

• There is a "seatnd” window of opportunity' for Ada stimulated by: 

- Megaprogramming 

- Object-oriented technology 

- High integrity systems 

- Distributed systems client-server architectures 

• We need to widen the market base outside of the DoD niche, but we must realize tlrat it is 
not for every market 

• We need to encourage research institutions to employ Ada as a core technology'. 

• We need to encourage investment in software by clianging the accounting niles and riglits 
in software clause of the F.AR 

RECOMMENDATIOiMS (You Do) 

In order to take jidvantage of the "2nd window of opjxtrtunity" the following actiotrs rue 
needed: 

' Put more biLsiness focas on Ada plans and strategies 

• Accelerate tire rnigjatioiLs to Ada 9X by providing access to quality tcnrls, bindings, 
training, transition support, and implementation guidruice widiin tire next 6 rnontlis.

Ada Dual-Use Workshop 


Harry F. Joiner, Ph.D. 
Chief Scientist 
Telos Corporation 



Why Isn’t Ada Popular? 

• Education in software engineering 

• Restrictions on programmer freedom (i.e», 
encourages the engineering of SW) 

• AvaiSability of inexpensive tools and 
compilers 

• Availability of standard software packages/ 
assets 

” Too much horsepower and complexity for 
small projects 

• Lack of management support 














Ada and Popularity 


Do you have to win the popularity contest to 
be successful? 

What does commercial popularity buy you? 



Ada is currently 
the best technical solution 

• Large system development 

• Safety-critical systems 

• Long-lived systems 

• Software reuse 










Ada’s Major Drawbacks 


f 

ki 

k 


Lacks state-of-the-practice development 
tools/compilers 


Lacks standardized interface mechanism 
for O/S, windows, DBMS (and SQL) 



r 


The Questions, Please 



Ada acceptance within our organization 

Investments to increase the commercial use 
of Ada 

Increase in Ada’s appeal, adoption, and 
popularity 





Action Plan I 


Participate more aggressively in the 
development of commercial standards 
(including de facto standards, such as X- 
windows) 

Support the development and use of 
secondary standards/common packages for 
Ada 

Pay for the development of commercially 
competitive development tools and distribute 
them widely 




Action Plan II 


Support the investment of transitioning DOD- 
maintained softV\/are systems to the 
commercial market through common 
architectures and reuse 

Make DOD software assets available for 
commercial use 

Support the implementation of professional 
standards for sofhr^are engineers

Ada Dual Use Workshop Position Paper 
How DoD Can ‘^Revitalize” Ada 


1. Introduction 


There ai'e majny dungs that die Department of Defense — through DISAyJIEO/CIM — can 
do to “revitalize” Ada. In this context, “revitalize” means combadng the perception that Ada 
isn't successful, isn't growing, and isn’t a viable technical solution. DoD, alone, cannot 
“revitalize" Ada, however, in a partnership with industry, academia and other Federal 
Agencies, DoD can effectively expand Ada’s visibility and use. 


Key Activities 


Five specific DoD Ada revitalization activities arc recommended below. These activities 
address ways in which the DoD can build upon its current leadership role in the Ada world 
and revitalize Ada throughout the software cnginccririg community. The five activities arc: 


A. Reconfirm DoD's Commitment to Ada 


This is die most important acuon that DISA and the DoD can undertake. Expand 
opporranities to advertise the fact that Ada is DoD’s corporate standard and that it has been 
chosen for very good reasons. Many programmers view languages as an almost religious 
issue and attempts at standardization and uniformity will encounter resistance. To reduce 
costs, many corporations standardize on one language for corporate wide use — - this is an 
appropriate ar.d accepted fact 

DoD must continue to aggressively enforce the Ada standard on all types of systems and 
minimize the exceptions. Get the support of ARPA, NSA, MITRE and others. Additionally, 
DoD must place great emphasis on presenting a single, consistent positive message in all 
public forums — that Ada is the DoD's choice for software development and is a successful 
positive technology. 


B. Collect and Disseminate Ada's Successes 


Ensure that success stories are collected and disseminated. To accomplish this, several 








soFTecH 


things can be done: 

(1) Policy can be established requiring a/I software projects within DoD to collect and 
report several, simple, kinds of information (e.g. size of the project, number of 
developers, length of the project, outcome, etc.). Funding and expenditure reports on 
DoD scfrv/are development activities also can be collected by DISA (more specifically 
to the AJPO and AdaJQ. Business case studies for Ada usage and savings car, then 
be developed and disseminated. 

(2) DoD must collect appropriate Ada project information and write "Ada success story" 
professional papers for presentation at Ada and non-Ada conferences. Ada succe.ss 
stories also can be disseminated using several media: 

a) press releases to newspapers and newsletters, 

b) articles submitted to conferences and magazines, 

c) postings to electronic m ailin g lists and bulletin boards, 

d) advertisements in journals and ncwspai>crs, 

c) packets of detailed project success stories available from the AdalC, 
f) booths at conferences and trade-shows. 

This effort to document DoD Ada use must be supplemented with the collection of non-DoD 
statisacs as well. Currently industry, academia and organizations such as SIGAda do this on 
a volunteer basis; DoD can supplement its volunteer effort with appropriate incentives. 

Create additional positive press for Ada. DISA can suppon the creation of both press 
releases and articles on Ada. These should be targeted at magazines and newspapers that 
have not typically had heavy Ada coverage. These would include: Con.putcrworld, 
Government Computer News, Datamation, IEEE Software, Journal of Object Oriented 
Programming, etc. DISA should coordinate the release and placement of these oress releases 
and articles with the Ada vendor community so that the vendors can place ads for products in 
the same magazines at the same time as news articles appear. These articles need not (and 
perhaps should not) be written by the DoD. However DISA can provide additional funds to 
successful Ada projects to document their results in the form of articles submitted to 
(traditionally) non-Ada magazines and conferences. Qosc cooperauon witli Industry trade 
groups and ACM SIGAda is necessary to suppon this activity. 

C. Focus DoD and CIM Efforts on Ada 

Ensure that DoD reuse repositories focus on Ada reusable components as a core technology. 
DISA (through its Center for Standards) can supplement its Technical Reference Model by 
ensuring that Ada bindings exist for all standards and are freely available rhrough the 
repositories. For those bindings that do not exist DISA should subsidize efforts to develop 
and place them in the public domain. This should include efforts to submit these bindings for 






softgch 



su-Jid.-irdiz^tion by ANSI or ISO. Addirionally, DISA should not restrict its effo^^s to only 
ANSI or ISO standards, but should work vvith vendors who supply “defacio" standards to 
ensure that Ada bindings (APIs) are available for those products as well (e.g. Microsoft 
Windows, X-windows, etc.) 

Provide a presence on industry coordination groups, who over the past five years, have 
emerged as a powerful factrjr in setting “defacto standards”. DoD and DoD contractor 
participation in these groups can balance the heavy C and Ch-(- bias and promote Ada 
requirements, paiiicularly in the Ada API and/or bindings areas. These groups should 
include, as an exantplc, OMG (which is defining the CORBA arid ORB sets of services), the 
MIT X consortium, OSF. XOpen, COSE (Common Open Systems Environment), CCITT 
(telecom), X12 (Electronic Data Interchange), SQL Access Group, and ODA Consortium 
(Open Document Architecture). 

D. Promote Industry Dual Usage For Ada 


Provide Dual Use Incentives. The DoD can provide contracting policy and regulations that 
provide incentives to contractors who demonstrate duaJ-use of Ada within their non-DoD 
commcrcjaj. applications. Incenrves could take the form of proposal evaluation criteria which 
promote .contractor dual use of .\da in their non-DoD business areas, AddidonaUy, the 
government could provide “dual-use” funds (similar to the AJPO’s highly successful ATIP 
program) to leverage government Ada investments into “duaJ-usc” technologies. These efforts 
should be followed up with large amounts of positive press in the form of articles in major 
newspapers (e.g. Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, etc.) and frequent demonstrations of 
Ada technology in “dual-use” situations by high ranking government officials. 


Accelerate deployment of Ada compilers on strategic platforms. As one of the largest 
customers of Ada software, the DoD can influence the direction taken by the current Ada 
compiler vendors. By worldng closely with the compiler and hardware vendors the DoD can 
ensure that Ada compilers, like C and C-m- compilers, arc available simultaneously with the 
release of new' hardware platforms. Hardware buys contingent upon the availability of Ada 
compilers on those platforms also encourages industry cooperation. 

DoD also needs to provide a clear message to the vendors that as a customer, it wants 
compilers that are priced competitively with C-h- compilers for the same platform. DoD could 
also encourage vendors to offer a “sidegrade” from a compenng C-m- to an Ada compiler to 
entice people to try Ada. Finally, DoD could approach Borland and Microsoft to provide Ada 
compilers along with their tools for other languages (even if these compilers arc simply 
OEMd from existing Ada vendors). 

E. Promote Ada 9X and Ada 9X Education 


Educate the non-Ada community on Ada 9X. Embark on a joint campaign with trade 
a.ssociations, ACM SIGAda, and academia to educate the sofTwarc/bardw,are industry on the 






soFTecH 


benefits and features of the new Ada9X. Addiuonaily, target existing object oriented 
programming languages (OOPL) markets which may provide new niches tor Ada; 

• Reengineering MIS applications from legacy COBOL to Object Oriented Clicnt/Scn-'cr 
systems in OOPL (include revcrsc.i'rccnginr.cring tool vendors). Ada9X could be used. 

• Organizations who are considering developing their new applications using OOP and 
C-f r. Ada9X’s object oriented featmes v-dU be superior. 

• Distributed applications including client/server, simulation, and supercomputing. Ada 
9X's nev' distributed computing capabilities are well suited for this area, 

• Non-DoD small embedded systems such as the popular emticddcd controDers found in 
cars, household appliances, nnedical insmimcnis, etc. 'Phis community shares much 
with the DoD and could benefit from the many Ada lessons learned. 

Create promotional material. DISA, using a professional marketing/PR firm, could create 
promotional material on Ada 9X’s features and benefits similar in quality and style used to 
market large weapons systems in congress. These materials should be distributed widely 
through AdalC, Ada vendors, conferences, industrial trainers and university educators at no 
cost Materials should appear "generic” to avoid any perception of DoD bias. 

Fund appearances at non-Ada trade shows. DoD can and should use the Ada Information 
Clearinghouse, in joint cooperation with an Ada industry trade-group and with ACM SIGAda, 
to promote Ada in new markets. Significant presence at non-Ada conferences both nationally 
and inicmaiionally can provide new developers the necessary information to get interested and 
get started. DoD could initially sponsor an Ada booth represented by a professional 
organization such as ACM SIGAda. Target major Object Oriented conferences (OOPSLA 
and Object World), MIS conferences (such as DPMA — the Data Processing Management 
Association, and ITAA -The Informat on Technology Association of America), CASE 
conferences (CASEWorld, etc.), embedded softwarc/rcaJ-time/distributed systems conferences 
(such as Embedded Systems Conference), and major “general” software conferences (such as 
Comdex). 

3. Conclusion 

The DoD has a multitude of opponunities to make real progress in efforts to "revitalize” Ada.. 
There are large numbers DoD workers and suppon contractors who art knowledgeable and 
enthusiastic supponers of the language. That is not enough. To achieve strategic long term 
Aba benefits the DoD needs a solid professional marketing campaign. Markcnng, coupled 
with a focused program of technology insertion incentives and data collection and reporung. 
will provide the DoD a solid foundation for Ada revitalization throughout the community.

As a businessman considering investing more money to start new Ada 
businesses (or invest more in my Ada software reuse service), given the 
dual-use climate that is spreading, and DoD interest in commercializing 
Ada, I (and others) must look at the costs and benefits of doing so. 
Benefits are easy to recognize - more sales of Ada compilers, co-nponents 
and services. Given Ada's minor presence outside the Mandated world, I 
am sure some sort of linear relationship exists between the amount of 
money invested and tlie potential profits - the market is very elastic. 

The costs of commercializing Ada is a much more complex subject, because 
of the existing behavior patterns for the supply and demar.d of programming 
products and programmers (i-e C/C++ is too entrenched and too competitive). 
In thinking about these costs, it is hard not to conclude that Ada is not 
very conmercializable, short of sub-billion dollar investments by the Ada 
cozmnunity. Other languages are too successful, and corporations making 
their next generation commitments now, for Ada to easily win market share. 
What follows is my proof on why Ada is not commercializable under current 
DoD economic assumptions. 

The following argument is pessimistic for the s<ike of argument. I do 
not fully bfjlieve my own argument, as if I did, I would not be undertaking 
the great expense (at least for me) of attending the. Ada Summit, nor would 
I continue to try and sustain my software reuse business in the Ada 
community. I make the argxment so that tliose attending the Summit and 
readers on comp.lang.a da who have little contact with the non-Mandated 
business world can uncerstand how difficult it is for those of us fighting 
for Ada acceptance. It also reflects what goes on in our minds as 
developments are announced inside and outside the Mandated world. 


EFFORTS TO COMMERC} M,TZF. ADA With BE AS STRONG AS ITS WEAKEST LINKS. 


W,£AT FOLIJOWS AliE THE WFJVK LINKS. 




1) The future standard pIatfoni>. has two Pentiums running Windows/dnxx 
on which compilers cost $199 or less, a prohibitive price for Ada 
compiler vendors. 

2) Jobs, jobs, jobs - there are 100 times more non-Ada jobs. 

3) There is i^isufficient demand for an Ada components industry to 
bootstrap itself. 

4) The embedded world does not like it's tasking built into the 
language. 

5) It is too expensive to translate legacy projects in advanced 
software research from their existing languages to Ada. 

6) The related worlds of signal processing, graphics, multimedia, 
networking and communications are dominated by companies closely 
tied to C/Ct+. 

7) CASE tools make megaprogramming increasingly cost effective with 
C+t and SmalataJk. 

8) Megaprogramming will increasingly become irrelevant. 

9) The leaders in the academic world will never adopt Ada. 

10) Growing ap>athy inside the Pentagon towards Ada 

11) ARPA will never agree to put its enthusiasm and funding behind Ada. 

12) The Aria Mandate will never force Ada compiler vendors to become 
competitive. 

13) There is no marketing and demographic data for progrcumning 
languages on which to make decisions and future plans. 

14) Think of TCP/IP, CALS, VHDI. AUDL, SEI's CMM, all from the DoD. 
Their success implies Ada meets no piessing needs.

Tlio - 1 OUT' piat.ifjini in which to iii.iiki't Adii : m.i i.n( raim>;;, 

niiiiicompi wot kc.T.nUiorv.; and mi crocoint.nitiers. 'J'he t i i st t hree markip.s 

are too si to sustain a profitable business marrketi iiq Ada [iroducts. 

Maintramo.s -tre a dyinq market - just look at the aqonies of IBM eind 
Fujitsu. ither than their massive communications and file servinq ability, 
there is nothing attractive about niainf rames. And even these t'wo l>eriefits 
are slowing being surpasscjd by other technologies. Even the bob is getting 
rid of its mainframes for networks of small machines. The business that is 
still left in the mainframe market is mostly serving existing customers, 
aund existing mainframe 3.anguages ~ Cobo.l and Foirtran. Little demand there 
for Ada products, on top cf competition from C vendors (such as SAS). 

Ard if nothing else, IBM has made it quite clear it is has no interest in 
promoting Ada in the mainframe world - kiss of death. 

Minicomputers - same thing. Substitute Wang, Data General, DEC, Prime, 
Hewlett Packard and others (except for their workstation products) for IBM 
and Fujitsu eind the Scune arguments hold. What business is left is sezrvicing 
existing customers with their existing lainguages - little room for /.da 
products to sustain a profitable business. Aga.in, while IBM has a strong 
market in nu.iiiccmputers (ASIZX series), it has no InLeresi. iai promoting 
Ada here also, (In fact, its upsetting that the leading STARS prime, IBM, 
refuses to connnercialize Ada anywhere, preferring C+^- and Smalltalk). 

Workstations have three problems that limit Ada penetration in the market. 
First workstations were bom out of the Unix/C world, and both C and C++ 
are heavily entrenched here. All of the big commercial software vendors, 
all the large university research efforts, and much of the communications 
and networking world using workstations are all based on C/C'++. On top of 
which, many in the workstation world of the softwai'e hacker nature don't 
have a high regard for anything out of the DoD including Ada - a dumb but 
common attitude. Combine this with the Free Software Foundation, and 
the billions of lines of C/C++ workstation source cixle that float over the 
Internet every day, the many, many software research projects funded by 
the DoD in Ct+ et.ai., and you have a tough, tough market to breiik into. 

Second, there i.s not a big market for supporting products and libraries, 
to Eusiain sales of Ada products other than compilers and CASE tools. 

Can you think of any software product like 1-2-3 that drove the \forkstation 
market - a so-called "killer app" other than Unix itself? Given advertising 
and technical support costs, it would be hard to bootstrap a successful 
solely-Ada product into this market. And third, eventually all workstation 
software prices will coverge to PC prices (as PCs become more powerful and 
fast Windows and Macintosh emulators [WAPI for one] become available on 
workstations). Also GNAT will cannibalize some compiler sales in this 
market, and Cyqnus-like companies can thrive but do not make an industry. 


HI CRWIOMf in’ERS 


Wliich brings us t the microcom^-iuter market, in particular, that market 
based on platfor with Intel microprocessors running Microsoft/Hovell/IBM 
operating systems. As much as they may hope, all the non-Intel processor 
efforts (Sun, Motorola, MIPS) will never dislodge Intel from its dominant 
position. Intel is too good and too tough. Similarly no one will dislodge 
Microsoft, Novell, IBM and the Unix groups from their dominant operating 
system positions. It is here where the battle of Ada commercialization 
will be fought, a terrain where Ada is at a hugh disadvantage from the 
outset, having to charge up steep nills into tiie guns of C and C+-t. 

For one, all of the dominant operating systems are C/C++ basedt Windows, 
Novell OS, OS/2, and Unix. Microsoft a^one has sold over 65,000 Windows 
NT developer kits at a cost comparable to that of Ada compilers. 65,000 
is a number at least twice as great as all sales of Ada compilers, even 
including the Mandated world- These systems, and other applications, 
each total millions and millions of lines of C and C++. Most of the top 
100 independent software vendors selling into this market use C or C++. 

Most of the new software technologies available for this > rrket are done 
in C/C++; OO databases, multimedia, communications, multiprocessing, AI, 
natural language, etc. 

New entrants usually succeed by having a small tecim code up a beta-product 
for version 1 to be marketed as quickly as possible. What's the language 
of choice for this SEI CMM-rating-of-0 development style? C/C++. 

Second, there is intense competition between programming language vendors. 
ETveiryone is trying to get market share from Borland and Microsoft, who in 
turn seem to revel in fighting with each other. hist prices for many 
compilers are often over $400, but, if you present them with the cover sheet 
to a manual from a competitors products, they will chop off up to fifty 
percent of the price. Newcomers breaking in have to offer even lowttr prices 
tiian the market leaders, usually less than $200, and throw in some gimmick 
like a free CDROM or a trip to Hawaii. And whenever liorland feels a cash 
crunch, they make their prices $99. Wi h their current cash streams, Ada 
compilers vendors would go bankrupt trying to compete in this market. 

Third, the Ada community bar ten years of non-reiaticni with the press in 
the microcomputer nuiirket to make up for. There is little editorial coverage 
on Aria by the non-Miindatixl press (and even th«.‘ Mandated press like GCN does 
as ouch to help Ada as hurt. Ada wit.ti i ts ctivor.i.je') . There are movers and 
shakers in the microcomputer world, none ol wfioui really are lamiliar wit.h 
the Aia community. How can people to frhoose Ada if they never: Si:e 

i i. nH>nt.io.ued and reviewed in the' pr-b 1 i ca t > ons they read?

[SObUTION: Subsidize Ada compiler vendor:: to market tlu! current vor:;ion:; 
of their I'C compilers for $19.9S, or some other really loi^ amount. This 
is a tactic others in the PC business are using to quickly capture market 
share and profit off of future upgrades. Cost at least $15,000,000. 

Either that or nationalize Microsoft :-) 

I constantly argue the government shouldn't do this stuff, but if ARPA 
is going to spend $100 million on commercial CAD, DoD can do so for Ada.] 


2) Jobs, jobs, jobs - there are 100 times more non-Ada jobs. 

Almost every economic commentary today revolves around jobs. NAFTA, 
Clinton's health plan, the Space Station, etc. Those who have them are 
in no mood to risk them, and those that vrant them will do what it takes 
to get the job. All of which is bad news for Ada programmers, because if 
you have been following the help wanted ads for progr amm ers over the past 
few years, it becomes evident that there are over 100 times as many as 
non-Ada jobs outside the Mandated world as there are Ada jobs. 100 times. 
This is even more pronounced in the major software metropolitan areas like 
Route 128, Silicon Valley, Southern California, and Austin. 

This sends out a very strong signal to the market to shift resources 
to those languages where there are new hires, because this is where many 
of the new programming language sales comes from. With growing dominance 
of microcomputers in the corporate computing world (see 1 above), there is 
the growing dominance of C/C-<-+. And as the 1990 SEI infrastructure report 
mentions, and those familiar with terminal Markov chain states, once a 
programmer gets into the C/C++ market, there is little incentive to 
transition out. So as DoD downsizing continues, the job market will result 
in many qualified Ada programmers being absorbed by the C/C++ world. 

Nothing worse than a "Body Snatchers" scenario (and no, those are not pods 
l>einq harvested on the remaining farms of th<! Silicon Valley and Boston 
areas - just funny shaped pumpkins and melons :-) 

Thus the dynamics of the job nuarket do not create many opportunities 
tor new Ada sales. People sell where jxsople are being hired and outfitted. 
Also see #9) below - academic worJd. Schools teach Ada because companies 
hire C/C+^ programmers because schools teach Ada. 

[SOLUTION; Fund a Works-Project-Administriition-like effort by paying [Xjople 
to develop and initially market comjxrnenf libraries for Ada. See below. 
Cost $20,000,000. ] 



3) There is insufficient demand for ait Ada co.-.iponents industry to 
bootstrap itself. 

Markets are driven by people with a strong incentive to see their 
sector succeed. One reason why Apple's Macintosh became so popular, 
despite the higher prices of their machines, was that a lot of dedicated 
and profit hungry people wrote some great software for the Macintosh. 

In the programming language market, one of the great drivers is the supply 
of third party applications libraries: graphics, communications, databases, 
debuggers, memory management, GUIs, etc. A big factor in choosing a new 
language is the ability to find those libraries that you depend on in that 
library. For example, this explains one reason why the scientific groups 
never switched to Ada and slowly to C/C+-*- - no one has bothert^d to convert 
tlieir massive Fortran numerical analysis libraries. 

Many companies in the C/C++ world have grown from basements to nice 
sized companies selling these third party libraries and pr^oducts, because 
in these markets people are willing to pay for reusable source code, even 
in object library format. More available libraries turns into mere sales 
of compilers which results in more available libraries ad infinitum. A 
nice self-sustaining cycle that helps drive the C/C++ market, a process 
that is not passive. Also, the compiler companies work with tliird party 
suppliers and VARs to help this process along. 

It is very difficult to start such a process for the .Ada world. Given 
the marginal demand for Ada compilers outside the Mandated world, it is 
hard for a third party Ada component supplier to be profitable solely on 
sales outside the Mandated world, especially where there is so little 
support from Aria compiler vendors. Presently there are only a handful of 
Ada component suppliers, and the same ones everyone has beer touting for 
the last ten years - Booch comp<;:)rK?nts, Grace components and a few others. 
(For some reason, CAMP seems to h.ive droppenl off the face of the earth). 
There is no growth, few successful new entrants - all indicators of a 
stagnating market. 

One strategy joight be to use sales inside the Mandated world to funn 
marketing and sales in the non-Mandatod world, using the generous flows ot 
money in the Mandated world to launch non-Mandatod businesses. Nice idea 
in practice, but Mandated conti'actors are notorious for being unsup[X3rtive 
and disinterested in the third party component, pfrcxlucts, especially given 
often lamenttid but never changed 2‘j0+ l)ol) softwan.* procurement reijulations,

4 ) The embedded vrorld does not like it' s tasking built into the 
language. 

The growing power of « 2 inbedded processors and their cheap costs make it 
possible to stick them in almost any product. This in turn fuels a booming 
embedded programming market, as evidenced by i;;mi)edded Systems Programming 
magazine and tlie Embedded Systems conferences. In following tlie enibedded 
marketplace, I never get the feeling that programmers want tasking built 
into their language. There are dozens and dozens of multi- and real-time 
tasking executives for sale, each offering a different solution to tlie 
problem of many different instances of tasking in real-time products - 
Maybe they do want it in their compilers, but the don't seem to be 
flocking to Ada, and in the interim, Ijtiese products help drive the C/C++ 
market. 

Furthermore, as microcomputer operating systems become increasingly 
sophisticated (something like Windows NT), with tasking and other recil time 
capabilities avai.lable as system calJs, the demand fer such capabilities 
explicitly in the language becomes a minor benefit,and sometimes a problfiua, 
as t he programmer has to disable the programming leinguage's tasking and 
real time features to use another executive. 

And frtinkly, the Maiidfited world lost big • ir’C d'le to bEI's inability 
to work with CMU. Had they been able to got 7 da uscKi for developing Mach, 
which is being adopted by many as the oj,>ernt,'.r g system kernel, Ada would 
have beliefit.cjd greatly. A tough soil (see workstation az'gument) but at 
the time it would have iKJcn woi't h the effort.

5) It is too oxptisisive to translate legacy p)rojects ii* advanced 
software research from their existing languages to Ada. 

Prograoiming language sales come from two place.s - new efforts and 
existing efforts. tlxisting efforts usually imean legacy projects, and in 
many prograauning couiraunities, this raean.s large aasounts of code that have 
to be converted bt^fore a new language can be adopted. In the scientific 
programming world, no one will switch unless their large numerical analysis 
libraries are converted. In the workstaition and acadeatic worlds (which 
until quite recently was the same), you are talking about legacy projects 
in C and Ci-t. In all of these wor.lds, you are talJclng about hundreds of 
millions of lines of code in an existing language. 

You may argue bindings and Ada pra<jroas, but tln.s has never been a 
popular approach in any language. Besides even here, .Ada is be.ing Iseaten 
out by other languages. For example, ParcPlace has a nice system for 
practically wrapping Cobol mcxlules ins.ide of Smalltalk objects, so that 
gradually a top-down reengineering of Cobol legacy systems can be done in 
a manageable and cost effective way. I am not argu.i.ng that this is a good 
or bad thing to do, but that for those doing it, othexr la.n(j(.iages a.re 
beating Ada to the marketplace. OMG efforts with CORB-A also make other 
languages equally attractive for CX) as compared to Ada9X. 

Even in the DoD w»3rld, there are popular legacy systems that have 
never been converted to Ada as part of sf.jme evangelizing effort. IX)li'fTRAN 
and ASCA from the Air Force; GRASS, BIjAST and BKIXIAI) from the Army; NPSNKT 
and NEC from the Navy and other programs are popular, important and still 
not in Ada. Many of the research projects at the service academies qualify 
as legacy projects, and most are not being done in Ada, which is a shame, 
since the service academies (esix?cially the NFS and AFIT) do some great 
work. And it would have b<^on nice if .someone had fundc<i a .lovi a 1 - to-Ada 
converter year;; ago. Every four months I get a swarm of phoneca.lls as some 
Jovia.L conversion effort hits thr.': strtret and everyone start.s looking for a 
Jovial converter, yet no one individually has the funding or interest to 
have one: develop*Kl (yea, I know translators never work-iook at the mi.L.l;ons 
spent on the now forgotten WWNMCS Fortran and Cobol translators), but a 
decent set of assistance tools could be develo)"Xi<l. 

Thus for those interested in pursuing coirane:ci;i 1 ization through t.hrur>t:s 
into the academic arid corjKrrat.e wor Ids, th(!j:e is a birj proliJrmi of f:onv<;r t i tiq

All '.f tfic enter t:a inment companies, tfie telephone and cable companies, 
and m.iny sof tware developers are jumping into this market. It is (jstimated 
that: everyday in the San Francisco Bay Area one new multimedia company is 
being formc^d. Tens of billons of dollars are being thrown around nith 
reckless abandon (not really - these people are bottom-liners all the way), 
with Japan and its billions also joining in. 

Unfortunately for commercializing Ada, there is little Ada use by these 
collaborating groups. The entertainment companies don't program, the 
cable companii s follow teleconnnimications companies, the teleconanun.icati.on 
companies (AT y Baby Bells, Sprint, MCI) are all using C/Ct+, and the 
software comp.jiies in multimedia ctnd graphics, with tJieir Macintoshes and 
PCs, are also all using C/C++. Sure there is the occasional company like 
Silicon Gre )hics successfully and proudly using Ada to do this type of 
work, but < .:onomically they have only a nvarginal. presence. 

If you read the magazines lor electrical engineers (Electronic Design, 
Electroni.c fingineering Times, Embedded Systems Programm.ing) where the 
hardware tor the global multimedia world is covered, all you see is ads 
for C/C-^ + products and tools. Ditto for the software developers (Computer 
Graphics, Mew Age Media, Wired, many of the ACM and IEEE magazines). 

Global interactive roultijnedia connnunications is the next big industry ~ 
and Ad has iio presence at its birth. 

And someone stop tlie havy and Air Force from showing their really nice 
distributed graphics progr unming system (NPSNet) written i.n C++ to tlie 
graphics world (also funded by ARPA - C++ being distributed to industry). 

I know that they are proud, and they should be for their effo.rt, hut it 
is kind of embarassing for the Mandatc^d World that it is not in Ada. 

Again, commercializing Ada in this marketplace will be quite hard, 
for the usual reasons of entrenched t.i.rst -ent.ry-ers. (I could go on with 
similar stories for the AI, paralle! and mu It i.procssing. database and 
other doniain.s, but it .is just the same as Irere). Too much money is l>einq

software application, initially target tl'.e advancevl sottwaru R&D .in 
those areas (paiailei, OO, Al, «5l c) , which conveniently has a lot luiided 
by ARPA - sr'e #11) below] 





7) CASE tools make megaprogramnLing increasingly cost effective with 
C++ and Smalltalk. 

liny campaign to cormnercialize Ada will ha\ .-o be founded on whatever 
strengths Ada does have in relation to other languages. Once such strength 
is the use of the language in megaprogramniing projects, those large team 
multi-progrcimming projects prevalent in the Defen.se world. For these 
projects, use of Ada has consistently shown the benefit of doing so. (Of 
course it would help if some of the megaprojects (FAA, WWMCCS, STANFINS] 
didn't get into so much trouble and bad press for non-Ada reasons). 

The problem in commercializing Ada using the megaprogamming benefit as 
a selling £)oint is that increasingly, CASE tools are making megaprogramming 
possible with other languages. For example, at a 1991 OOPSLA conference, 
someone from Rational argued this very point - that Rational's tools can be 
used to allow development of > 100,000 lines of code projects in C++. If 
you attend commercial CASE shows, yc'i see more and more tocis trom other 
companies offering similar capabilities. And success stories from companies 
using C++ for large projects (ATT, Microsoft, Mentor) and SmaJItalk (Xerox, 
American Airlines) only strengthens the case for these languages. 

I am tired of Ada people bragging about the strong type checking you 
get with Ada. This is a lousy marketing argument, since such features are 
increasingly available with CASE tools for other languages. I have heard 
this brag being ’ade for Ada9X. Well it is no longer an impressive feature. 

Now it may turn out that in fact using languages other than Ada for 
megaprogramming is not as cost effective as some may claim, that there are 
hidden costs that have b«;en ignored or not accounted for. But from a 
mcirketing point of view, enough of a case for non-Ada me japrogriunic'ng can 
Ixi made to weaken l.hi.s approach to commercializing Ada. 

[SOLUTION: Again, another tough one. Given the "egaivalent" capabilities 
of Ada9X and C++ and Smalltalk, it is hard to design a C^VSE tool for Ada 
that can't equally as well be used for these other languages The only 
hope l)ere is to loudly and endlessly publicize success stories with Ada 
projects to at least keep Ada's good news in the public's eye. Cost is 
$2,000,000 to fund a professional publicity campaign. And please, can 
someone at gunjxiint force the STARS fKiople to start showing up iit the 
conunei’cial trade .shows and conferences dealing with CASE? j

.ire all competing to be dominant in tliis area. Sure in some indust.rios 
(avionics always being touted) inegaprogramming will have some role, with 
wrns for Ada, but never enough to sustain a thriving Ada industry. 

As the corporations downsize lx3th themselves and their information 
processing activities, mainframes and megaprogramming will gradually 
diminish in scope, and while providing sales to an installed base, will 
present few opportun,ities to sustain healthy Ada sales. And it certainly 
wouldn't hurt for the DoO to question its reliance on megaprogramming - 
the wars of the future might be better served with distributed systems - 
it work.s for the wars of commerce. 

[SOLUTION: There is none here. The future is not megaprogramming. If 

you wriit to know the future, read the science fiction book "Ender's Game" 
by O.rson Scott Card, to see how the large distributed simulation wargames 
the DoD is increasingly using (all in C/C++) will eventually blur the 
line between virtual and live combat.] 


9) The leaders in the academic world will never adopt Ada. 

This follows from a lot of tJie other sections, but I mention it 
explicitly becuase so many in the Ada community seem to be placing their 
hopes on using GN.AT in the academic community to launch some campaign to 
eventually win market share for Ada. I am dubious, for the following 
reasons. 

First academic success of a language means little. For example, the 
most popular undergraduate teaching language is Pa.scal, but it is rarely 
used in the cojrporate world (compared to Cobol/C/C++/Fortran). And if an 
academic institution geared its langxiage choice vocationally, it would 
choose C/C++ as the professors road the help wanted ads, and hear from 
their former scudents looking to hire part-time people. An argument, can 
be made for leam.iiiq with the Ixjttor language, Ada, but in tight job 
markets, fxjople want wtiat is l>eing hired on their resumes. 

S<H.:ond, most .ret<iin<Hl <ie<t<Jemic computing ex{x?rienco com<?s 1 roin work on 
academic rtj.sear'Cli projects as a junior' or senior, or qiiidu.'ite ::tudent. 
Uowi?ver, most of these? leepn'y <ri<? lurt. in Ada, and v'i 11 rarely it 

ever." be translated. So even though you might expo-se a student to Ada as 
a freshman or sophmorr? in the introeluctory coui'ses, most of the advanct^tl 
courses and work will not be done? in Ada, t hf'ugli will be the most ie?c;enL 
experiences to iretain. 


Third, NOT TO DENIGRATE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS OR RELEVANCE TO SOCIETY, 
but most of the institutions teaching Ada or where Ada can be introduced, 
are not the "leading" software academic institutions. Most of the top 
software institutions, as measured by the presence of their students in 
those companies dominating, driving and creating new markets, by their 
presence in leading software metropolitan areas, by rheir receipt of the 
advanced software research government funding from the DoD, DoE, NASA, NSF 
and NIST, for the most part don't use or care for Ada. MIT, Harvard, 
Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, Berkeley and the rest of the UCAL system, 
Cornell, etc, are not and probably never will be Ada institutions. 

Fourth, the service academies don't have the be^t record for using 
Ada. If you measure the programming language use in theses issued by 
the NFS and AFIT, you will see Fortrem, Pascal, C/C+-t and Ada equally 
distributed - better th£ui academic institutions in general, but not the 
most toutable record for DoD service academies. It's a shame, because 
the work I see in these theses is first rate and would be a big credit 
to Ada if it was all done in Ada. 

Thus, I am dul)ious about the strategy of commercializing Ada through 
the route of academic acceptance, especially if Microsoft starts flooding 
the universities with the source code to Windows NT. GNAT helps, but 
only as a skirmish in a much larger battle. 

[SOLUTION: As part of #2), #3) and #5), fund efforts in the major 

universites to convert some of their legacy projects into Ada. Also 
flood the service academies with Ada compilers. Make ARPA tie academic 
funding to Ada use.] 


10) Growing apathy and bickering inside the Pentagon towards Ad<i 

To quote Ralph Crafts, "there is a resentment and fear in the various 
components of the DoD regarding the Ada directive", that he has been 
told by lower ranking Pentagon officials that "no one has ever explained 
to them why Ada is a gocxl idea or how Ada can help them in accomplishing 
their mission"; instead they have been told "thou shalt use Ada" without 
a shrtid of accomp.inying justification and rationale.

is probably nob d<^<!p <niouqh stabi st: i ca J ly (soc #13 below), bub 1 do qet. 
around. For exvain[jle,, bhoio have been a decreasing number o£ UoD SBIR 
bopics involving Ada, wibh bhe most, recenb 1994 solicibabion compiebely 
devoid of any menbions of Ada. The majoriby of the success articles 
that I read for Defense prograimning activities use non-Ada languages. 

The majority of source code l.isted in DoD service academy theses and 
technical reports, and general DoD technical reports, is not Ada. Sure 
the large, mega projects inside the DoD are in Ada, and should be, but 
the majority of everything else is not in Ada. 

As many have noted pubt'cly and privately (T have endless quotes if 
you want them), the Ada waiver process is a joke, which wouldn't be if 
the DoD was tiAiiy behind Ada. In recent months, a variety of DoD 
officials (for example. General Blind) have suggested that maybe Ada 
needs some reexamination. To quote Ralph Crafts, "There's been no 
continuity, enforcement or explanation to the people in the field who 
^lre supposed to implement the Ada requirement. I've been witli several 
organizations over the last few months, and there's confusion, resentment 
and anger because they get the word one way one month and then some 
high-level person comes in ^ma says 'Just go ahead and do it this way. 
Ignore the Mandate until we get caught." and "The Ada waiver is ludicrous. 
There are claims by the services that they are fully behind Ada, and they 
have granted no waivers or a handful of waivers over the last couple of 
years. Well, that's a really nice facade because people who don't want 
to use Ada don't bother to go through the waiver process. They go off 
and do what they want and hope they don't get caught until they have so 
much invested in it that they can't be told to stop. It's interesting 
that people can just ignore taie Ada Mandate with impunity and they will 
go off and rcjquire the use of C and C++". 

And then there are ancedotes like the following: "I watchcKl in amusement 
(for five years, no less) senior officers in the Air Force decide that 
their old COBOL systems needed only 30% of their software rewritten to 
repair the junk. The only reason they stopped at 30 was because they had 
to use Ada if it h.it 33%. Of course, two years later, they'd REestimate 
that ANOTHEJl 30% had to be rewritten — deftly avoiding the Mandate without 
fear of getting into trouble." 

And it doesn't htdp when DoD ollicials like Raul Strassraan, once 
bhtjy are out of oflit:t‘, brash A<J.i publicly. Many in the corjxjrabe world 
read of these bickerings in the trade press, and use it as an excuse to 
not. consider Ada. To quote Paul Strassraan, "The economic driver really 
is software reuse. The underlyinq reason for Ada or i g i ra !. ’ y was software 
reuse and software mxlularity. Today, by and large, software reuse is 
being driven by the fact that .software objects are commercially available, 
and most of the software objects on the market a.re just no Ada objects. 

The world is not going the Ada way". Ho doesn't mention that because DoD 
contractors don't like buying Ada objects, most of the few Ada components 
suppliers can't remain in business. Hut in any event, his comments, as 
an ex-DoD softw.ire otli<-i.il, hurls A<ia credibility. 





So in general, the unity of attitude towards Ada tliat some in the DoD 
claijns exists, doesn't exist. There is a lot of conflicting attitudes, 
concerns, frustrations, and programming langu<aqe practices. 

[SOLUTION: I have absolutely nothing to suggest here. Had I oeen able 

to figure out this messy politics, I would have figured out how to win 
a contract. In six years I haven't done the latter, so don't expect 
much from me on the former.] 


11) ARPA will never agree to put its enthusiasm and funding behind Ada. 

An anonymous ARPA Ada quote, seen in 9/14/92, pg 98 Government Computer 
News, "It makes absolutely no sense to have a law to mandate the use of 
Ada. It was not the intent of the Ada program to have absolutely one 
programming languge. The law CANNOT apply to ARPA." 

In the eyes of many decision makers in the corporate world, ARPA is the 
DoD's leading software agency. ARPA funds all of the advanced research in 
software and has a reputation for starting computing sub-industries. And 
when ARPA likes something, it goes after it enthusiastically, to the point 
of crossing over political policy lines. Craig Fields was willing to be 
fired as director of ARPA when he tried to inject some venture funding in 
a semiconductor company, crucial apparently, to help ARPA needs. GAO and 
Congress chastised ARPA for its meddling in the supercomputing market, 
where it directed companies to purchase and use certain machines favorite 
to ARPA. Recently ARPA anted up $100 million to help commercialize 
the CAI) industry vis-a-vis DoD needs, with Martin Marietta receiving 
$53.4 million and Lovckheed Sanders $42.5 million. Ajid then there are the 
hundreds of millions that have gone into SEMATECH. ARPA will also ftmd up 
to $48 million to help the active matrix liquid crystal display industry. 

So when ARPA likes something, it REALLY likes something. 

Here's an example of a project ARPA could have forced Ada to be used, 
but didn't, and an example of how they spend big bucks on everything but 
Ada. ARPA is funding the Center .or High Performance Computing (CHPC) 
with $15 million to create a real-time operating system scheduling 
framework, distributed file systems, a high-performance fiber-optic 
connection and multi-processor modules to work with the OSF's Mach 3 
microkernel (again where was SEl with CMU?) . Ada is NOT being used by 
CHPC to do this work. To quote CPHC director (an ex-Marine), "I'm a big 
Ada advocate, but commercial developers jast aren't producing the kind 
of Ada products that would make it catch on. The realities are such 
that you aren't going to see conunercial software done in Ada. When 
companies like Microsoft make Ada compilers, then I'll believe Ada has 
a future". Why should commercial developer.s umr Ada when ARPA refuses 
to make this project, and ot.nvM;;, use Ada?

.important to the DoD as is the commercial Ada industry, and a lot mori" 
healthy than t.ho commercial Ada industry, certainly whatever reasoning jed 
to aiding the commercial CAD industry with $100 million should have led 
AKP.A to a sirnrlar decision for Ada. 

And the Ada ARPA does get involved with, like STARS, seems more like 
fiftli columvi unde.rtakings tlian anything else (and until someone from STARS 
shows up at a comanercjtl CASE show and starts displaying the benefits so 
often touted within the STARS community, fevr outside the Mandated world 
are going to take STARS seriously; if the Air Force can commercialize 
the non-Ada XBSA, certainly ARPA can try commercializing STARS). 

Commercializing Ada requires handling perceptions. Aiid one perception 
to many in the corporate world (or at least those who bother to follow Ada 
at all) is that the DoD's leading software agency does not like Ada. An 
agency tliat many in the corporate world pay attention to, if for nothing 
else than the fact that ARPA doesn't get reorganized every few years. 

[SOLUTION: Quite simply, does DISA have the blood and guts to fight AJIPA, 

and have the DoD force ARPA to embrace Ada? If not, then this whole thing 
is a complete waste of time. If we can't sell ARPA on Ada, won't be 

able to sell anyone else on Ada. For those of us spending our own money 
on trying to commercialize Ada, it is frustrating seeing the DoD continualy 
ducking this issue. DISA needs to put ARPA irto a headlock over Ada. 

MAybe give a contract to Hulk Hogan.] 


12) The Ada Mandate will never force Ada compiler vendors to become 
competitive. 

In a world where the DoD disconnects itself from the general software 
.industry, and xs willing to pay any cost to develop defense software 
systems, the Ada Mandate is a viable, beneficial mandate to have. Use one 
language - simple, clear and very conducive to reuse and maintenance. 

In any other world, the Ada Mandate is a failed microeconomic distortion 
of the marketplace. At their current price levels and capabilities, Ada 
compilers are uncompetitive. To compete in the microcomputer marketplace, 
and even the workstation marketplace, Ada vendors will only be able to win 
market share by charging $99 or less for their compilers. Yet once they do 
so, they have to charge the DoD and its contractors the same amount, and 
as they have admitted, they cannot afford to do so. As long as the Ada 
Mandate is in its current form, the DoD can have one langiiage or ic can 
have competitive Ada compilers, but not both. 








[To show how vicious PC pricing is, norland is trjdng to capture 
market share, and pass Lotus to be nuinber two in the PC spreadsheet market, 
by selling the latest \ersion of their Quattrr. spreadsheet for $49, 90% 
off the list price of $495. Any Ada compiler vendors want to offer 90% 
discounts to everyone to steal some market share from C/C++?] 

Further, Ada credibility is weakened by Ada compiler vendors trying to 
survive at any costs. I have seen more ads from Ada vendors and contractors 
marketing C++ products than I have seen for Ada products. I can understand 
the Ada vendors trying to survive, but it is at the expense of their own 
Ada sales, and tes+.imony to the problems caused by the market distortions 
of the Ada Mandate. In recent months, I have seen ads from Telesoft for 
their TeleUse C++ GOI code generator. Intermetrics for their 68000 C 
compilers for the embedded %rorld, many from IBM pushing C++ and Smalltalk, 
Meridian with their C++ Designer, DDC-I with their C++ multitasking 
executive. Rational selling the Booch components in C++ with their Rational 
Rose, and Tartan selling a C-i-+ DSP compiler. In aggregrate, as much is 
being spent by Ada vendors on these non-Ada product advertisements as for 
their Ada products if not more - vmderstandable but not credible. 

[SOLUTION: Unfortunately, while I can see ways to address many of the other 
problems cited above, fixing the Mandate escapes me. Get rid of it, and 
the vendors can't suirv^ive on their Ada sales. Expand it to include C++, and 
the same thing happers. Even worse, the longer this non-solvable issue 
goes unsolved, the more costly it will be for tJie DoD to solve it. 

One suggestion would be to subsidize the Ada compiler vendors to flood the 
markets with $19.99 pricing cn the current versions of their compilers, in 
order to profit in the future from upgrades to a much larger installed 
base. But frankly, I don't think they should be awarded in this way, 
given their past histories. After all, they should have txj the ones 
organizing this Ada Summit, not DISA. Though if nothing else for their 
advertising consistency over the past few years, I could see funding Alsys 
and Aotech. ] 


13) There is no marketing and demographic data for programming 
languages on which to make decisions and future plans. 

One vital element in any business plan, especially when you are 
approaching venture capitalists, is the market survey. This involves 
determining the potential demand for your product, and current suppliers 
that you will be competing with. Such data dees not exist for the 
programming language market vis-a-vis Ada interests. I have hoard that 
DISA is secretly devolopii.g plans to "save" Ada - well if they are (why 
in secret?), they should stop il they don't have the following data. 







In .Illy ('vcnl , insiilc .iii<i I In' 'i.uil.itic) vVc > i I c 1 , wt ■ to know: 

what: pioij I .iiimi i nq 1 anipi.Hjo;; .irn boiiiij iiin-d, %,'h<i ' in.viiq lln'iii, lor what,

engineering trade shows and conferences, dynamics ot. software development 
at the top 200 independent software vendors, academic use of programming 
languages for both teaching and R&D, DoD use of prograunming languages at 
all scales and for all applications, flows or reusable software, and other 
marketing factors. 

Such data is vital for successfully coitmercializing Ada, and it is 
collectable, as I have demonstrated with my occasional statistics postings 
to comp,lang.ada. To proceed without such data is a very risky gamble 
that most likely will fail. 

[SOLUTION: Fund such a study at a cost of $500,000.] 


14) Think of TCP/IP, CAI.S, VHDL, AHDL, SEI's CMM, all from the DoD. 

Their success implies Ada meets no pressing needs. 

Surprisingly for a government bureacracy, the DoD has had some successes 
in developing software technologies that the general software industry 
accepted commercially and profitably for entrepreneurs. TCP/IP, CALS, VHDL, 
AHDL (the new analog design language), and SEI's CMM rating have all 
enjoyed commercial success. Why? Each met some need industry had, and 
each were a good solution for that need, all of vdiich have spawned many 
self sustaining compeuriies and/or incorporated into product lines. Even 
for these successes, it took many years of use to gain wide acceptance. 
Overnight stardom cculd not be mandated. 

Ada has not had the same degree of acceptance and success. It is not 
too rash then to conclude it mets no pressing need, and probably won't 
fill any pressing need for the next few years. Thus commercialization 
becomes difficult to achieve. 

[SOLUTION: Look 5 out of 6 success with software technologies is not a 

bad record, more successful than my ventures. Chalk up the defeat to 
learning, and move on].

These interfaces will allow tool builders to access 
detailed semantic information, without investing in 
a compiler front-end. 

With these interfaces, a whole r'ew generation of 
support tools can be developed. 

Support for AS!S version 1.1 (Ada 83) is slowly 
building, but could use a boost. 

Version 2.0 (Ada 9x) should be expedited, so that 
9x can be supported in this area.

II is time to begin marketing the Ada alternative, 
outside of the defense community. 

Almost ten years of experience with Ada in the 
defense community shoutd be shared with the 
commercial sector. 

From a technical perspective, Ada 9x will compare 
favorably to the alternatives. 

From a business standpoint, it will take effective 
reuse, and superior programming support 
environments to win the business.

All of the issues presented are being reviewed at 
some level by the Government or Industry groups. 

The committees, groups, action teams and 
agencies need adequate funding to finish their 
tasks in a timely manner. 

In addition to these groups, commercial vendors 
will need "incentives" to help otfset the costs 
associated with providing support for ASIS and 
Ada 9x within a relatively small Ada marketplace . 
































4da Dual-Use Workshop 
Recommendations Provided By 
Magnavox Electronic Systems Company 


Introduction 

Magnavox has been using Ada on large Command and Control applications since 1984. In 
fact, we have actively cracked and been involved wi± the language that became Ada since 
the inception of the Higher-Order Language Working Group (HOLWG) in the mid-l970's. 

It is from this inside perspective that we offer an integrated response to the questions posed 
by this panel: 

• What actions can we take to get Ada accepted as the preferred language for development 
of software systems within your organization? 

• What investments can we make to increase the commercial use of Ada? 

• What can we do to increase Ada's appeal, adoption and popularity within your software 
community? 

Response to Questions 

As a software developer for the DOD, Ada is the required and prefened language for most 
of our large projects. In addition to these large systems, we also produce many small 
embedded systems in which C is currently the language of choice for various reasons. In 
order for Ada to become the preferred language company-wide, the following must be true; 

• Ada compilers must be able to operate with a niinimum of resources. Many smaller 
projects are developed with only a few PCs or workstations as the programming 
environment—these cannot provide the resources needed by many of the Ada 
development environments. 

• Compiled code must be extremely op timized in both size and performance. In some 
cases we have switched to Ada because improvements in computer and compiler 
technology have made the use of Ada feasible for the first time. Some of our embedded 
system products arc extremely small with stringent size, power, weight and 
performance constraints. As technology has improved we have been able to use Ada in 
applications that previously required carefully crafted assembly language. 

• Ada programming erivironments must be affordable. Small projects can not easily 
afford the high cost of today's Ada environment, wluch is mainly targeted to large- 
scale development. 

There are many issues related to the commercial acceptance of Ada, many of which wUl 
most likely be covered by participants from others areas. We would like to see invesunents 
in the following areas: 

ASIS 

The recent introduction of the ASI 5 (Ada Semaiic Interface Specirica rion) provides the 
opporTumrv for Ada environments to become far supencr to other languages in terms of 
tool integrarion. Magnavox has successfully used the LRM interfaces (a precursor to 
ASIS) provided in the Ranonal environment, to build several tools for automatic code 
gcncranon. These tods could not have been produced in a cost effective manner, without 
these intenaces. 

Ada compiler and r.ool vendors must be given the proper encouiagement to quickly adopt 
this standard and produce integrated development environments. The effon to produce an 
ASI3 interface for Ada 9x should also be expedited. 










Interfaces & Binding 

Bodi the cotnmerciaJ and defense worlds are struggling to integrate available components 
into large systems which meet customer and market needs. The challenges of large scale 
systems integration in an Ada environment is further complicated by the lack of Ada 
interfaces to many of these commercial products. Even though the Ada language provides 
the capability for a developer to integrate multiple languages into a single program, the 
practical aspects of maintaining a development environment for more than one language can 
greatly increase developmental costs. 

Oualitv Ada interfaces to commeraal off-the-seif products (COTS) are needed to provide a 
more cost effective environmenr for Ada-based integranon of commercial and defense- 
related svsTetr.s. These interfaces need to offer multiple integration strategies that are 
flexible and allow the developer some implementation opnons. Interface paradigms such as 
client-server, blocking/non-blocking, and type conversion issues need to be addressed by 
these interfaces, to allow a seamless integration with the Ada environmenL 

Developers need C and C++ binding to products such as windowing environments, 
databaises, and operating system services. Significant effort has been focused on this area, 
but reliable interfaces are not easy to locate. These bindings must be readily available for 
the many different products, and must be free or extremely inexpensive, in order for Ada to 
compete with environments which do not require bindings. 

Reuse 

This is, of course, one of the honest topics in the software development community. The 
Government needs to continue the e ffons lo make large scale reuse libraiies available to 
both defe nse and corr mercial users. Cost effective use of these libraries depends on the 
case in which developers can quickly locate and retrieve desired components. To gain 
confidence in these libraries, the components must be highly reliable and well maintained. 
Incentives must be provided to both DOD and commercial developers to provide quality 
components to keep the libraries well stocked. 

Ada 9x 

Ada 9x represents a significant and long awaited improvement to the Ada programming 
language. These improvements will allow Ada to become a serious contender in the object- 
oriented programming world. The new features provided by Ada 9x will allow Ada to be 
used for many of our small embedded systems. The question is, who will suppon .Ada 9x 
in terms of compilers, language sensitive editors, debugging facilities and other 
progiamming suppon tools? Proper incentives should be provided to vendors to help get 
Ada 9x off to a running stan. Vendors should be encouraged lo provide full suppon for 
the language including the annexes. 

Advertising 

The marketing "word" on how to cost effeenvely implemeni Ada and obtain benefits 
(technical, financial, tunc-to-market, quality, etc.) must get out throug.b tradinonaJ industry 
publications such as ComputerWorld, InfoWord, PCVVeck, etc. It is time to share the 
experiences of the defense community with the commercial world so that they can act a 
boost from almost ten years of expcnencc with Ada, 

Summary 

The quesnon asked was "what can we [Government] do...?" Most of the areas addressed 
in this paper are being reviewed at some level by the Government. The comnuttecs. 
working groups, Acnon Teams, and agencies need receive proper funding to compicic their 
tasks in a timely manner. 











In addition lo these groups, commercial vendors will need "incennves" to help offset the 
costs associated with providing suppon for ASIS and Ada 9x within the relatively small 
Ada marketplace. 

Continued support in both of these areas will be needed until Ada gains enough of the 
market share to become industry supported.

Ada Dual-Use Workshop: 
Comments for the Industry Panel 

Sheraton Premiere at Tysons Corner 
October 19-20, 1993

Action Items for DoD/DISA to 
Increase Commercial Use of Ada 

Three Major Categories: 

1. Get serious about DoD's Ada directive 

2.. Work more effectively with outside organizations 

3. Market, promote, and advertise 











Get Serious About DoD’s Ada 
Directive 


o Top execs must be clearly and forcefully 
committed 

0 Provide incentives (both positive and negative) 
that encourage the use of Ada 

0 Promulgate the "whys" of using 4 da 

0 Put the onus of "proofon the other languages 

0 Back up the words with funding and programs 

0 Revamp/eliminate debilitating standards 


Work Effectively With Other 
Organizations 


o Explore cooperative actions/programs with 
other gov^ernment agencies 

o Provide mechanisms for exploring & exploiting 
common needs 

0 Learn about the needs of commercial entities, 
and communicate at their level 

o Facilitate cooperative efforts with Ada 
organizations and events (i.e., TRI-Ada, 

WAdaS, SIGAda, ASA) 












Market, Promote, and Advertise 


o Commercial successes are not often technically 
superior 

o PR, marketing, promotion, and advertising are 
critical to commercial image and success 

o The sales and marketing models are different 

o DoD is not skilled in these areas--it will need 
help 

o The Ada community also needs to be educated 
as to how to work with commercial markets 


Summary 


o Ada is still the best choice for accomplishing 
the DoD's mission^-rnake that fact known 

o The DoD must be serious about using Ada, and 
clearly show its commitment, to influence 
commercial interest 

o Enormous benefits can be obtained by working 
with other organizations 

o Marketing, promotion, and advertising are 
absolutely essential for success

Ada as a Preferred Language 

• Provide affordable retraining of existing 
staff in 

Software Engineering 

- Object Orientation 

- Ada 

• Publicize the availability of a production 
quality Ada compiler and run-time for 
existing mainframe platforms 


Convince decision makers by actions and 
words that DoD’s commitment to Ada is 
strong 

Provide tools that ease conversion and 
re-engineering of legacy systems in other 
languages 

Make Ada the centerpiece of government 
research programs 











• Promote the "better, faster, cheaper" 
attributes of Ada in non-Ada communities 

• Convince Congress and non-DoD 
agencies that software policies should be 
based on the long-term economic 
advantage 


Investments for Commercial Use 

• Continue/increase funding of GNAT 
compiler and environment until sufficiently 
mature to make a good first impression 

• Fund public domain translators from all 
popular programming languages 

• Fund efforts to standardize bindings to all 
popular COTS products 











• Support the commercialization of 
products developed tor the DoD 

• Support revisions in procurement 
regualtions that facilitate development of 
and with reusable software 

• Fund Ada I.C. presence at non-Ada trade 
shows 


Increase Ada’s Appeal, Adoption, 
and Popularity 

• Promote publication of Ada success 
stories and lessons learned 

• Make Ada the centerpiece of government 
research and development programs

and encourage other government 
agencies to adopt Ada 










• Promote Ada technology transfer outside 
of the DoD 

• Provide a supply of trained Ada software 
engineers and a demand for more 

• Ada education in area high schools 
(Washington Ada Symposium (WAdaS)) 

- Provide low cost training 

- Provide forum for technical exchange 

- Emphasize Ada successes and lessons

Expanding The Use of Ada in The 

Marketplace 

• Market Ada to managers 

• Make Ada desirable to programmers 

• Get Ada into schools and colleges 









Market Ada to Engineers 


• Fund comparative studies of Ada and 
other languages 

• Disseminate studies to widely read 
periodicals

Make Ada Desirable to 
Programmers 

Invest In tools and libraries 

Allow Ada to keep up with a changing 

world 

- C and C++ compilers change every 
nine months, Ada changed every 13 
years (if we’re lucky) 








Make Ada Desirable to 
Programmers 

• Subsidize a low-cost PC-based 
development environment 

• Get serious about Ada reuse i 

- Incentives to put code in libraries | 

- Incentives to use code from libraries 1 

I 

- Force DoD agencies to share software | 

sources I 


Get Ada Into Schools and 
Colleges 

• Subsidize a low-cost PC-based i 

development environment 

• Get a good author to write a useable Ada 

textbook I 

• Encourage Ada 9X as the standard and 
teach "object oriented programming with 
Ada", not "Ada, an object oriented 
language"

Summary [ 

□ Department of Defense has enough software 
requirement to support a gigantic Ada industry. 

□ If the DoD truly supports Ada, the commercial 
marketplace will follow. 

□ Commercial software developers consider DoD Ada 
commitment to be something of a joke. 

□ Worse yet, many DoD software managers think it is a 
joke. 

□ What happened to the days when a commander gave an 
order, we snapped an acknov;ledging salute, and carried 
out that order?

Ada Dual-Use Workshop - Veudor i'aiid Pioei^cdiii^s 


1.0 irNTRODlJCnON 

This appendix contains tlte findings, conclusions, and recomniendarions for the three questions 

that were posed to the Vendor Panel. This data supports the suimnary of the \'endor ptuiel, as 

discussed in the Ada Dual-Use Worksliop Siunniary. 

2.0 QUESTION #1: can we |I>oD and industiy as partner ' do to increase the 

market for Ada goods and services within the non-defense sectors? 

FINDINGS 

The following findings were the result of participant briefings: 

• Eiach of the Ada vendors is focusing on specific market segments, and striving to provide 
high quality cost effective solutions to customer needs in the chosen segments. 

• Many DoD applications aie dual-use, either in the specific sense that the exact product 
used by DoD is used by non-DoD customers (e.g., a medical instrument) or in the generic 
sense that DoD and commercial customers purchase similar products (e g., aircraft fliglit 
control systei.is). 

• DoD information systems are dual-use in the generic sense - DoD lias unique 
requirements, but there are many similarities between DoD and commercial systems. 

• Most information systems in both the DoD and coinmercial sectors are still written 
and maintained in COBOL. 

• In patlifinding applications such as S fANFINS, DoD has learned tliat Ada has 
signi^" advantages over COBOL for Information Systems applications. 

• Ada 9X will provide significantly enhanced capabilities for Information Systems 
development, including object oriented programming. 

OONCUJSIONS 

Based on the session findings, the following conclusions were inade by the panelists: 

• DoD and Ada vendors can be effective partners in increasing tlie market for Ada goods 
and services in dual-use applications by focusing on specific market segments and 
capitalizing on their respective strengths. 


Defense Informcaion Systems Agepxy F-1 


Novembers, 199.1 








Adii LXiiil-Use Woikshop - Vendor l^aiicl Proceeditigs 


• A paiticular target of opportiuiity is the reeiigineaing of Infomiation Systems into 
architecturally designed Ada compcMiaits which can lie ported easily to iiui in diverse 
aivironments ranging from mainframes to open cliait/server configurations and pasonal 
computers. Ada's technical benefits, especially portability and facilitation of reliable 
component level reuse, are especially \uluable in these applications. 

The four higliest priorities for DoD action are: 

1. Demonstrate a consistent commitment to use Ada for DoD application.s. 

2. Partner witli indusUy to promote awareness of Ada's benefits in targeted dual-irse 
applications 

3. Create a business environment which is conducive to private investment. 

4. Accelerate tlie availability of higli quality Ada 9X products. 

RECX)MMENDATiaVS 

The following recommendations were derived from the findings and conclusions listed above: 

• DoD should be aggressive in implementing the four actions listed above. A detailed 
analysis of each action area, including the findings which motivate the recommendation, 
conclusions, and specific implementation steps, is provided in tlie pages which follow. 

• Vendors must also do their part. Tliey must provide b.igh quality products and services to 
meet DoD requirements, and they must be aggressive in promoting their products and 
services witliin non-Defense sectors. 

Action Ami I: Demonstixie a Consistent Convntment to use Ada for DoD Applications. 
FINDINGS 

31ie following findings were the result of participant briefings: 

• All vendor panicinants felt tliat Ada must be perceived as successftil in the Ek)D sector to 
achieve a commercial market.

Novemb>er 8, 19^)3 



Ada I>,ial-Use Workshop - Vendor Piuiel Pioceedings 


• Idle Ada vendor coimnunity unanimoasly rated IDoD cominitnient to Ada and related 
success in the DoD software sector as the most importtmt pre-conditions for success in 
the commercial sector. 

• While DoD represents the Ada community's # I reference account, DoD personnel are 
reluctant to appear to be promoting contractor products and services. Tliis * iucUuice 
hinders die reference process tliat is an integi al component of attracting commercial 
business. 

• Vendor participants consistently cited the DoD's need to collect long-tenn project cost 
data as an important step in rallying die DoD behind Ada. 

• DoD's inconsistent posture on Ada and its failure to follow through on its Ada mandate 
are senous impediments to Ada dual use. The DoD Ada mandate and level of 
commitment to Ada are not well communicated iaside and outside of DoD. 

CXDNCLUSIOVS 

Based on the session findings, the following conclusions were made by the panelists: 

■* DoD must make a clear consistent statement of its commitment to Ada and demonstrate 
that commitment through conaete acrions. 

• DISA should take the lead in the use of Ada 9X for Infonnation System applications. 
Whereas Ada 83 was designed for embedded applications, Ada 9X has bew extended 
with excellent support for infonnation systems. Given DlSA's mission and its central role 
in the Ada program, it must complete a patlifinding application of Ada 9X to Infonnation 
Systems at the earliest possible date. 

RECX)[VlMENDATIONS 

Tlie following recommendations were derived from the findings and conclasions listed above: 

• The DoD should prepare and distribute a succinct statement of why tliey are committed 
to language standardization and why they have selected Ada. This story should l:)e told 
consistendy across DoD.

Ada Dua]~lJse Workshop - Vendor Panel Proceedings 


• DISA shoulc’ ' le a specific schedule to migrate its applications to Ada, At least one 
migration sy .liould be conveited this yeai'. We suggest a budget of $2M - $3fvl this 
year, and recoi; icnd that the objectives of this initial migration effort (i.e., size and 
complexity of system) be established appropriate to that level of effort, 

• The DoD needs to eliminate embarrassing incidents which impede commercial use of the 
language, A few of tlie examples cited are the following: 

- Ada not taught at tlie service academies 

- Military and civilian personnel ignoring policy, law, and directives with impunity 

- Lack of 6,1 and 6.2 funds for research supporting Ada 

- iTie selection of a COBOL finance system over Ada alternatives (STANFINS) 

• 'ffie DoD should demonstrate its commitment tlirough concrete actions 

- Public scrutiny for non-use 

- Penalties for non-use 

- Incentives for Ada use 

- Numerous announcements of specific systems which are being converted or 
implemented in Ada. 

Action Area 2: Ihonutte Ada Amtreness in the Convnercud MaHietplace 
FINDINGS 

The following findings were die result of participant briefings: 

• Ada is the best technical choice for creating applications diat are reliable, maintainable, 
can evolve ovei a long period of time, can benefit from component level reuse, and must 
lie rehosted to run on a variety of diflerent bardw'are configurations during dieir life cycle. 

• Ada is beginning to receive the attention and resjiect it deserves in die non-Ada 
community (for example, favorable references in technical papers and discussions in non- 
Ada conferences), but vendors would like to see a much highci lev^el of favorable public 
awareness. 

• Ada vendors would like to see wide dissemination of Ada success stories from lAiE^ 
applications, especially applications which are ‘exciting”. Vendors want to work widi 
DoD to present <^uch stories in a way whicli vvill be effective and understandable to the 
non-DoD corranunity. 'fire rxissibility of a negative reaction to DoD’s involvement was 
discussed, but die consensus wa> that interesting and factual stories will be well received 


! k’feme Infonnation Sysiems Agifncy F-4 


November 8, P)9,3 





Ada Duai-Use Workshop - Vendor Panel Proceedings 


• Ada success stories are not widely disseminated for a variety of reasons, including the fact 
tliat 1) DoD personnel are reluctant to appear to be promoting contractor products and 2) 
commercial users are reluctaiii to dissejninate infonnation about their strategies and 
internal [)rocesses. 

• About b-'lf the people attending the vendor session would be pleased to see DoD support 
markei activities aimed at enhancing positive Ada awareness, such as advertising of 
Ada teiefits and trade show participation. The other half of the attendees were con\'inced 
tihat DoD could be more effectiv'e at enhancing the commercial inarket for Ada througli 
public relations activities (see above), and feared that advertising and trade show activities 
wouM lie undei-funded, and inconsistently executed. ITiey feaied, therefore, that tlie 
resuits would be disappointing. 


CONCLUSIONS 

Based on the session findings, the following conclusions were inade by the panelists: 

• DoD will benefit greatly if there is a widespread appreciation for Ada benefits and the 
business case for using Ada. TTiese benefits will be in tlie areas of increased availability 
of products to meet DoD’s needs, lower prices for tlie products and services DoD buys, 
and increased availability of Ada trained personnel to work on DoD programs. DoD and 
industry must work together to erihance Ada awareness. 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

The following recoinmendations were derived from the findings and conclusions listed above: 

• Focus DoD's participation in Ada awarene.ss activities on DoD’s strengths - publicizing 
EXdD’s successful uses of Ada in a forceful and dramatic way. Specific approaches 
include: 

1 Have senior decision-makers highliglit Ada’s benefits :and DoD’s rationale for using it. 

2. Encourage DoD personnel and contractors to publish technical articles and give 
presentations at technical ainferences which provide the facts and benefits of asing 
Ada, 

3. Make it clear that it is appropriate for DoD personnel to be “references” foi Ada 
products and services which have I'Kjen used effectively on DoD projects,

4. Develop, in paitnership with coimTiercial companies, effecti\'e presentations of the 
business case for Ada, 

5. Explain DoD's rationale for committing to Ada to civnlian government personnel, 
especially targeting personnel involved in joint programs witli tlie DoD. 

• Make it clear that DoD personnel are encouraged to work witli vendors in enhancing the 
public awareness of Ada benefits, business cases, and success stories. 

• Issue press releases on systems implemented in Ada, 

Action Area 3: Create a Cotulucive Business Envinmnent 
RNDINGS 

The following findings were the result of participant briefings: 

• The Ada market is substantial! Ada tools market data suggests the current market for 
Ada compilers and tools is about $300M per year, and there are about 50,000 people now 
using Ada 

• While the Ada market is substantial, the overly optimistic estimates of an extiemely large 
marketplace during Ada's formative years (initial estimates of total annual Ada software 
development and maintenance exceeding $100B were cited) may hinder efforts to attract 
venture capital fimding to launch a dual-use initiative. See the Background Notes Section 
for further clarification on the structure of the Ada market, 

• Vendors were generally enthusiastic about establishing a partnership with government to 
stimulate the dual use of Ada, There were, however, some diffeiences of opinion about 
government's proper role in this partnership (e.g., good customer, good reference, direct 
funder of specific products), 

• Several vendors cited specific instances of practices by tlie DoD that tlie\' perceiv ed as 
providing direct competitors to tlieir product lines, 

• Vendors wanted DoD to focus its invesUnent dollais on standards and ciislomer 
applications which meet specific DoD needs, not on tlie development of software products 
which compete wntli industry' 

• ITie DoD was positively cital for its efforts to stimuhite a vigorous Ada parts business

Ada Dual-Use Worksliop - Vendor Panel lAticeedings 


through software reuse centers. Paiticipants felt that government could foster this .-\dii 
parts business and that a robust parts business could aid in toenetiation of comnierci ,ii 
sector applications. 

• Many vendors suggested strategies of iiK-t^ntives for using Ada and penalties lor not 
using Ada on DoD de\ elopmeitts as a means for stimulating Ada usage. 


CONCUSIONS 

Based on the session findings, the following conclusions were made by the panelists: 

• The DoD should emphasize its role as an infonned cui sumer of Ada goods and seivices. 

• The DoD should be straightforward, open, and consistent about its procurement intentions 
for Ada products and for developing applications written in Ada. The vendor communih' 
will meet the Ada product and serv ice needs of die DoD. 

• The vendor commiuiity should lead the thiust of packaging Ada goods and sen ices foi' 
use in the commercial sector. 

RECOMIVIFNT)A'nONS 

The follo'Aing recommendations were derived from die findings and cxinclusions listed above: 

• Doli) should focus first and foremost on its need to liave its software written in Ada The 
DoD should be rock-solid in its commitment to Ada and it should liave a plan to 
im^plement all new systems in Ada and to transition legacy systems to Ada. dlie plan 
s!io«ild be im}ilemented and tracked, and progress should lie periodically released. 

• If someone vvill be writing DoD software, DoD should make sure tliat they have an Ada 
compiler and tools, including CASE tools dial support development and pnxluction ol' 
quality Ada software. DISA's broad software process assessment capability should 
used to monitor Ada usage within DoD CentiaJ Design Activities (CDAs) and at DoD 
develojier sites

Action Ami 4: Accelente the AviulMlity of IR}’h Qnidity Ada 9X hvidncts 

FINDINGS 

The following findings were the result of paiticipant briefings: 

• Ada 9X extends Ada with features which provide object-oriented capabilities and 
inproved consistency of real-time performancue. 

• DoD personnel and contractors should use Ada 9X as soon as there are proven quality 
implementations. Ada 83 is an excellent tool, and there is no reason to rush tire transition 
to Ada 9>C This attitude is reflected in tire Ada 9X transition plan. 

• Once high quality inplementations of Ada 9X can be delivered, air exc-ellent strategy for 
expanding commercial use of Ada is to position Ada 9X as a hcm’ language providirrg scfe 
reliable ohjeci-onenfeci programming. This (.M rmmercial positioning is somewhat 
incoirsistent with tire facts (Adrr 9X i iechnic.d!y an evolutionary improvement on Ada 
83, and upwardly consistent from the point of view of existing Ada applications), but the 
positioiring will be useful in convincing commercial users to coasider using Adrr (9X), 

• One way to reconcile the facts that Ada 9X is the best available tool for nraiketing Ada to 
the commercial cormnunity rmd that DoD should not use an Ada 9X corrpiler arrd tools 
until tlrey are proverr is to accelerate tire availability of hjglr quality Ada 9X tools. 

• Ada compiler verrdors estirrrate that the transition to Ada ‘ ^X will cost between $1M and 
$5M, deperrding on the niunlrer of hosts, targets, and tools they support, arrd various 
technical factor s. There are aboirt fifteen base corrpiler tec hnologies which have Ireerr 
rehosted, retargeted, and integrated to create tire hurrdreds oT speci fie Ada prrxlircts in the 
rrrarket trxlay. 

CXTNCIIJSIONS 

Biased on tire sessiorr tindings. tire follouirrg cotrclusiorrs were made by tire parrclists: 

• IToD should accelerate ihe availability olTrigh qturl;,y Adrr 9X irrrj)!emerrtations. 

• DoD shoitld provide rnoneUiry incentives arrrtbiacj with cirreflrl evaluation of .Ada 9X

• A DoD coiTiniitiTient of $10M would pay between 20% and 40% of the cost ol migrating 
die base compiler technologies to Ada 9X 

• Any Li>oD flinding aimed at accxilerating 9X availability' S' 'uld be done as a oartnership 
with vendors, and done in a way which incentixizes commercial inv estment in Ada 9X 
products. 

RECaVlMENDATIONS 

The following recommendations were deriv'ed fiom the findings aid conclasions listed above: 

• Invest at least $10M this year to buy Adti 9X compilers, t*x)is, and bindings for future 
deliveiy. This DoD investment will acxelerate tlie transitions to Ada 9X and stimulate the 
recipients to make die additional investments to complete die products. 

• Plan and implement eaiiy applications of Ada 9X witliin DoD Cioals are to validate die 
quality of the Ada 9X implanentations, to create favorable references for Ada 9X 
technology, and to prov'ide constructive user feedback to help the vendors imjirove their 
Ada 9X products. DoD progranrs will hav'e to be funded to pay die cost of tlieir 
leadersliip in the Ada 9X transition. Tlie Ada Technolo^iy Insertion Program (ATIP) is a 
model for what is required, but the requirai funding will be dnee to five times greater 
than previous funding of die ATIP initiative ($IOM-$15rvr). 


3.0 QUESTION #2: Wliat investments should we (DoD and industiy in fiartneishipj 

make and initiatives should we takir to increase tiie coiranercial use 
of Ada outside of defense ajipiications 


FINDINGS 

Tlie I’ollow'ing findings were die result of paiticipant bneliiigs:

would eliminate the niaiket, since no revalue is gaiaated when a pirxluct is given avva>'

Ada i>ial-Use Workshop - Vendor Panel IVoeeedings 


‘ There was siibstai'.tial discussion on the pros and cons of tlie goveniinent paying to hax e 
softw.'ue developed and tlien giving it away. GNLI Ada and AdaSAGE were particularly 
controversial. A few of tire participants believe that it is never appropriate for tlie 
government to give software away Most participants believed that it is appropriate for 
the government to give software away in specific situations, but tliiat the danger of 
eliminating the incentive for pnvate investment must be considereti in the government's 
decision making process. 

• Bindings (interft ees) to popular commercial database manag'j?rent systems, teleprocessing 
and network software, opeiating systems, and graphics user interfaces must be available as 
COTS products. Bindings are most efficiently implemented as features of the Ada system 
and the prod, ct being interfaced (i.e., the DBMS, TP and network software, OS, or Gl d). 

CONCLUSIONS 

Based on the session findings, tlie folk-wing conclusions were made by the panelists: 

• A majo ity of ti’e particip;mts were glad that GNU Ada is being created and will be 
available to increase academic interest in Ada. ITie participaiits did not have enough 
infonnation to make any recoim ner.dation related to AdaSAGE. A voctil minority felt 
strongly that AdaSAGE products, thereby nuiximizing innovation and not providing free 
products that inliibit priv'ate investment. 

• If DoD can adopt open domain specific architectures which are consistent with 
commercial practices and the re-quiranents of non-DoD users, then Ada vendors can sell 
dual-use products, such as tools and reusable comjxinents, to botli tlie DoD and 
commercial customers. 

• DoD should incentivize vendors to provide Ada bindings to COTS products. 

RECX)MIVIENDATIONS 

ITie following recommendations were derived from tlie findings aid conclusions listed above: 

• Implement all tlie recommendations provided in response to fA*‘^stio:'. I 

• Invest in the analysis and definition of standaid open software architectures which Ixitli 
niavt DoD requirements and meet tlie needs of as many cixnmercial customers as }x>ssible 
Develop tliese standards in partnership vvitli industiy. Incentivize vendo:s to provide

• The highest priority recommended investments are as follows: 

- Continue funding for the Ada 9X I^ogram cuirently planned. 

- Invest in a DISA /Vda migrition plan and the neai-temi conversion of one migianon

" Joint investments by DoD and industry to develop Ada 9X compilers, tools, and

- increase funding for ATIP and focus specificrJly on Ada 9X 

4.0 QUESTIOV #3: Wiat can we (DoD and industry as partners) do to increase Ada's 

appeal, adoption and popilaiity? 


FINDINGS 

The following findings were the result of participant briefings: 

• All the findings, conclusions, and recommendations provided in answer to tlie first two 
questions are relevant to this question. 

• Present Ada marketing efforts need to intensified. 

• In the consiunei' market (i e., des'Ktop PCs), it would be too expaisive to try to match the 
volun,: and sizzle of C and C-H- promotions. Tlie key is co-existence and careful 
targeting of Ada awaieness activities to customers who can benefit most from Ada's 
technical advantages. On the product side, co-existence can be die patli to making state- 
of-the-art "windows" environments available. 

• Ada is often perceiv^ed as too tightly controlled by the L\)D, even tliough it is an ANSI 
and ISO standaid and tliere is significaiit non-E>oD use. 

• On tlie prtxluct side, a higli priority is for bindings and interfaces which aliow software 
v.Titten in C, C-K, and other languages to be used as components of applications written 
in Ada.

CXJNCLl SIGNS 

Based on the session findings, the following conclusions were made by tlie panelists: 

• We need to inject excitement and fun into Ada promotion. For example, Silicon Graphics 
takes Ada demonstrations to 80 conferences a year, and they are/?rn. (Only a few of tliese 
conferences are attended by the Ada community, so Silicon Graithics is deli\ering the 
message that Ada programs can be fan to a lot of new prospects.) 

• Industry', in cooperation with DoD, must revitalize its efforts to increase Ada's share of 
the market for programming languages.

RECOMMENDATIONS 

The following recommendations were derived from the findings and conclusions listed above 

• hnplement all tlie recommendations pro\aded in response to Question 1. 

• In implementing the second recommendation, vendors (and perhaps DoD) should make a 
special effort to deliver the message that programming in Ada is state-of-die-art and fun. 

• Where appropriate, it will be helpful if DoD can demonstrate high perfoimance airplanes 
and other exciting systems which depend on softv^are written in Ada for their

Overview of Ada 9X 


Full Support for Object-Oriented Programming 

C^Ada 9X adds type extension (Inheritance) 
and class-wide programming (run-time 
Polymorphism) to Ada 83's existing 
support for Abstraction and Modularity. 

Enhanced Support for Large Programs and 
Extensible Subsystems 

C^Ada 9X supports a hierarchical library 
and multi-partition programs. 

Full Support for Multi-Threaded/Multi- 
Processor Programming 

II^Ada 9X adds protected types (for efficient 
Data-Oriented Synchronization) to Ada 
83’s existing Rendezvous-Oriented 
Synchronization. 









Overview of Ada 9X 

(continued) 

Full Support for Information-Systems 
Applications 

[I^Ada 9X supports exact decimal arithmetic 
and International character sets, and 
through standard packages and pragmas, 
character and string handling, picture- 
oriented output, and Cobol interfacing. 

A Much More Complete Standard Library 

C^Ada 9X defines standard packages for 
Random Number Generation, Elementary 
Functions, Complex Arithmetic, Low- 
Level Task Control, Dynamic Priorities, 
Interrupt Handling, Per-Task Attributes, 
etc. 









I 


Ada 9X Business Case 


Ada 9X is a iherently Reliable Language 
•^Extensi\< compile-time error detection 
•^Thorougl run-time error detection 

“^Very Str ng Type Checking (Integers, 
Enumc! ons, Arrays, and Pointers are 
all stri ly typed, with no implicit 
converij ons between user-defined types) 

Dynamic Binding is easily recognized 
(only occurs when operands are. of a class 
wide type). 

Interfaces are checked and Information 
Hiding is enforced every time you compile 
(unlike checking based on separate tool) 

O Ada's thorough compile-time and run-time error 
detection automatically provides better detection for 
coding errors than a typical user-written test suite can. 


Ada 9X programs will be more reliable when 
fielded, and errors wall be caught earlier during the 
development cycle, w'here they are less expensive to fix. 








Ada 9X Business Case 

f continued) 

Ada 9X Systems are Flexible and Safely 
Extensible 

•^Abstractions can be extended both by 
extending individual types and by adding 
child packages. 

•> Programs can be constructed dynamically 
from independently linked, cooperatively 
executing partitions, while retaining 
strong type checking across partitions. 

•^Synchronization primitives can be 

constructed efficiently using protected 
types as a building block, 

•^Dynamic Storage Allocation, 

Initialization, Assignment, and 
Finalization are all under programmer 
control. 

•>Ada 9X programs can easily interoperate 
with subsystems written in other 
languages, through shared data objects 
and calls (both call-outs and call-ins). 









Ada 9X Business Case 

(continued ) 


Ada 9X will be an ISO standard, and Ada 9X 
systems will be highly portable 

ISO Standardization is well underway (at 
least a year ahead of C++). 

Implementation dependences have been 
minimized in Ada 9X. 


Additional bounds have been placed on 
implementation-dependent behavior. 








Perspectives on C+ + 


C++ is based on C, and inherits much of C’s 
inherent unreliability 

0 Pointer arithmetic substitutes for array 
indexing (no array bounds checking, and 
no array parameters, only pointers) 


0 Numeric types are all implicitly 

interconvertible (no way to distinguish a 
count of apples from a count of oranges) 

0 There is no integer overflow detection (it 
generally just wraps around) 

0 There is no null pointer detection (it just 
reads or writes page zero) 


The vs, 

statements 


” problem remains in “if” 


The “missing break” problem, remains in 
“switch” statements 


0 The confusing declarator syntax remains 







Perspectives on C+ + 

(continued) 

A quote from a C++ user: 

“Hi, in this relatively small C++ project 
Fm working on, some very random weird 
errors started occurring and it 
eventually turned out to be accessing a 
function through a NULL pointer. Sigh. 
Anyway, it was quite difficult to track 
down, and *Deeper sigh* I just added a 
whole lot of code to the project and 
similar symptoms started occurring. 

...Also, are there any ‘safe programming’ 
technioues which are used to avoid 

A 

errors like this? Short of switching to 
another language 

[From comp.lang.C+ + , 12- Sep 1993 (with 
permission of the author, who says... 

“1 DO like C+ + ... just those *#&*! memory/pointer 
errors...”).] 






Summary 


Ada 9X and C++ are essentially 
equivalent in expressiveness. 

D Ada 9X provides more sophisticated type 
composition (discriminant-dependent 
array components, access discriminants), 
Wvhile C++ has a more elaborate built-in 
inheritance mechanism. 

□ Ada 9X provides a more sophisticated 
namespace control mechanism integrated 
with three-level visibility control 
(visible part, private part, and body), 
while C++ provides three-level 
accessibility control as part of the class 
cons truct. 

But... Ada 9X and C++ differ 
dramatically in their inherent 
reliability features. 

D Ada 9X detects many errors at compile- 
time, and still-more at run-time 

□ C + + has weaker compile-time, and no run¬ 
time checking.

Be Sure to Maintain a Core Government Ada Market 


Without the core government-sector market, 
commercial interest in Ada would be nearly 
impossible 

- The current Ada US market of -50,000 engineers (< 5%) is 
barely large enough 

Address Ada 9X uncertainties and risks 

- Upward compatibilities 

~ Risks of a backward slide in compiler maturity 

- Compiler availability and commercial tool support 

- Funding for risk reduction and migration activities 

Address key Ada interface issues to keep 
pace with emerging COTS capabilities 











Ada Must Better Support 
Heterogeneous Language Applications 



• Provide better compilation system support for 
heterogeneous language applications 

- particularly C and C f+ 

• Provide interfaces for easy use (reuse) of 
emerging COTS object-oriented software 

- GUIs, object bases, OO system software 

• Fix the Ada policy to intelligently allow 
heterogeneous language applications 


I 






New Object-Oriented Software 
Encourages You Not to Use Ada 




• GUIs 

- C callbacks, X-events, DLLs 

- instantiated C++ graphic object instances 

» Object-oriented databases 

- C++ subclasses compiled in with the object base for 
application semantics 

• Next generation object-oriented system 
software 

- CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architeclure): 
interface Desciriphon Language (IDL) tools generates C++ 
headers to be compiled in with your applicatioii 


^SPS^ 


V 


Ada must accommodate the use of these new OO 
technologies with better interfaces and support for 
heterogeneous language applications. 




Take a Market Approach 
to Commercial Ada Applications 


• Identify high potential segments 

- Good product discriminators (e.g., real time, safety) 

- Sufficient market size and growth (e.g., process control) 

- Good comp Jtitive position (i.e., no firmly entrenched 
languages) 

• Invest in dual-use technologies to give Ada a 
competitive advantage in key segments 

- Reusable software 

- Domain-specific architectures 
“ Standard interfaces 

• Do not try to compete in all segments 

- Do not sell Ada is as a “do it all” language 

- Focus on selected target segments

ADA DUAL WORKSHOP 

1. What can we do to increase the market for Ada goods and services within the non-defense 
sectors? 

To create a demand in new sectors such as transportation systems, telecommunication systems, 
medical instrumentation systems or management information systems, we need to make sure that 
the technical and, more importantly, business cases are made known. We need more success 
stories about the benefit of using Ada from DoD and industiy'. 

2. What investments should we make and initiatives should we take to increase the commercial 
use of Ada outside of defense applications? 

For the last ten years large investments have been made to develop the Ada technolog>' and to 
have commercial off the shelf products available. TTiose products are today technically mature. 
To increase the commercial use of Ada, new investments are needed in the field of marketing 
to get the world to know that a commercial offering of Ada products exists today. Since the 
amount of spending that Ada vendors are doing to promote their products is directly related to 
the level of revenue in selling products, delays in funding DoD projects impact badly this effort. 
Since the case for Ada has been established, DoD and Defense industries should buy more COl'S 
Ada products to allow Ada vendors to spend more in promotion. The increase in sales volumes 
will lead to cheaper products due to competitive pressure. 

3. What can w'* do to increase Ada's appeal, adoption and popularity? 

Ada is not visible enough outside of the Ada community. We have to make sure that Ada is 
represented in all conferences, exhibitions and trade shows who puipose is Software Engineering 
and not only Ada. Ada 9X is a new opportunity to talk about Ada. 

Not enou^ people are trained to use Ada. To increase the number of skilled people we need 
to provide Academia and Training Institutions low cost but high quality and easy to use products. 

We need to transform tlie initial "missionary approach" into a business oriented marketing 
approach.

1 am VP of Product Development at Ventura Technology International (VTI). I have 
a strong Ada/MIS background based upon my experience as a key staff member on the 
-STANFINS and STARFIARS Ada programs at Ft. Benjamin Harrison, Indianapolis, Indiana 

1. What can we do to increase the market for Ada goods and services in ncn-defense 
sectors? 

Answer: Demonstrated Commitment 

The DoD should establish that all software procured shad adhere to the Vigorous 
Technical Initiative (VTI). Procured software would include all Commercial Off The Shelf 
(COTS), Government Off The Shelf (GOTS) and Non Development-Item (NDI) products. 
This approach reflects commitment to the DoD’s own standards of software development. 
Specifically, all software should include: 

- X % written and maintained in Ada 

- Y % written and maintained in 4GL (where appropriate) 

- where X > Y and X + Y > = 95 

- where Open System Environments (OSE) are given preference 

- and where commercial RDBMS u.se is given preference 

The VTI should include tiers of compliance. The above describes Tier 1 compliance. 
Tiers 2 and 3 would have decreasing demands in each area. In order for an organization to 
procure software, Tier 1 must be examined first. If it can be demonstrated that no software 
exists at Tier 1 compatibility. Tier 2, and then Tier 3, products may be examined for 
procurement. There should be consideration given to a demonstrable migration path to 
compliance. Purchasing offices should be held accountable and incentives should be created 
for using products from Tier 1, then 2, etc. 

The successful implementation of VTI will have two enormous benefits. 

First, the DoD will be creating, expanding and most importantly supporting a large 
cadre of software disciples, competent in the very areas of software development and 
expertise that DoD has emphasized for its own software. This cadre exists today but has 
lacked support from the DoD. 

An excellent example is Rational. They are a provider of a world class Ada/Softwarc 
Engineering Environment and they have done everything in Ada. 

Another example is Intermetrics, a company that uses Ada to develop software (its 
compilers) even i:: an Adn-hostile environment like IBM/MVS. 

Neither of these linns made this decision because there w'as a mandate. The results 


Copyright V ) 1 Ot.lubet 1 ‘.J!) 




are world class, maintainable software systems and more. Since these firms have first hand 
experience applying the language, they bring to their customers this expertise. This level of 
dedication to the DoD’s own existing standard must be recognized and rewarded if Ada is to 
'survive. Customers of Rational or Intermetrics get the benefit of a direct line to the 
knowledge and experience gained by implementing medium and large scale software 
programs in Ada. VTl will facilitate the rapid growth and cohesion that this small but 
talented group has lacked in the past. 

Second are the tools, departments and even firms which will be created to meet the 
demands of complying with VTI. Some will develop home grown tools to assist in the 
transition. Others will seek outside assistance. In either case, these tools will make their 
way to the market and all will benefit. Firms will emerge from the transition with more 
maintainable, more marketable software systems and tool vendors will have an opportunity 
perhaps unparalleled to make an impact on their market. 

The pilot program for VTI in MIS has already been developed, tested, 
transitioned and killed. 

The STANFINS legacy is VTI. Computer Sciences Corp. was contracted to team 
with DFAS/Indianapolis to implement STANFINS, an Army financial management system, 
in Ada. Later this team was tasked to deliver STARFIARS, an Army inventory accounting 
system, in Ada as well. No MIS project w'ith a scope similar to STANFINS had ever been 
attempted in Ada. In order to accomplish the task, the team developed four distinct 
supporting tools: a CaSE repository, a program management tracking system, a suite of 
product painters (and analysis tools) and a suite of code generators. These tools were 
responsible for: 

1) allowing analysts (non programmers) to ’paint’ specifications for screens, 
reports, databases and etc 

2) generating from design specifications 75% of the (ielivered source code that 
comprised STANFINS 

3) generation from a central repository a complete set of DoD Std 1935A 
documentation 

These tools gave the staff the near real-time access to the work-in-progress of their 
colleagues yielding the confidence to accomplish tasks such as changing architecture that 
affected entire systems/subsystems over a weekend. The energy created by enabling the staff 
to make such large changes in such a small amount of time led them to create more and 
better tools, to continue to improve the way the delivered systems worked, and to move with 
confidence to iinihemeni those improvements again and agtiin. 








And all of these tools were written in Ada. 

As STANFINS headed toward the chopping block (not for technical reasons) some of 
the staff who saw the great value of and market potential for the tools used in developing 
STANFINS came together and formed a company exclusively to create a product which 
brings this Software Engineering experience to the market. 

This story can be written again and again if the courage and vision exists to 
implement VTI. The DoD has the opportunity to create many STANFINS and an enormous 
number of startups in support of pursuing a standard which will taxe DoD and the market 
into the future. 

2. What investments should we make and initiatives should we take to increase the 
commercial use of Ada outside of defense applications? 

Answer; Demonstrated Commitment 

The DoD must invest in establishing the VTI. Although not free, the cost will be 
reasonable. VTI stands ready to assis* in this effort. We will participate in any way that we 
can. We feel this is an important endeavor for DoD, the government and the profession at 
large. 


3. What can we do to increase Ada’s appeal, adoption, and popularity? 

Answer: Demon .s trated Coinin i tnicn t 

The DoD must stand by its commitment to Ada STANFINS and STARFIARS are 
the largest Ada/MlS systems ever attempted and need to be put forward by the DoD as 
examples of how Ada can be applied to non-embedded applications. These systems must be 
thrust into the limelight and fielded today with an eye towards compliance whh VTI. The 
DoD must take two actions to make this happen. First a decision must be made to move 
forward. Second, resources need to be applied. 

These systems should be transitioned to an OSF. as soon as possible from theii current 
proprietary platform. DFAS is already moving toward an OSE solution for STARFdARS, 
VTI suinds ready to assist in any way to facilitate the transition and fielding of these systems. 

DoD must move to reduce the cost of using Ada to develop software. The free 
.Ada9x compiler is a first step but many, many more must be taken. Ada will continue to be 
a hard sell until the costs associated with using it approach those ot rOBOl,, 

There are no lechnological issues associated with moving from COBOl to Ada. 


V ^ i Of luht'i 1 ‘JB’i 








Time after time visiters came to the S'l'ANh'INS site with preconceived notions about Ada 
and her (in)abiiity to be used for tl'cir programs. And in every case we were able to 
demonstrate Ada being used. One visitor came in saying, "We can’t use Ada because Ada 
won’t talk to CiCS (an IBM/MVS ba.se IP monitor)". Of course that argument fell apart 
when we executed Ada programs that had been talking to CICS for some time. 

Of course these stumbling blocks turned out to be stepping stones that allowed the 
STANFINS team to grow. Here is a partial list of stumbling blocks turned stepping stones 
encountered on STANFINS: 

CICS 

CA/Datacom/Db 

MVS 

CPF (CICS Print Facility) 

MVS Internal Reader 
EBCDIC 

In each of the above cases and many more, Ada gave the staff the power to prevail. 

In conclusion, I submit that the technical case for Ada has been made time and again. 
The missing component is commitmertt. DoD must stand up and renew its commitment to 
Ada. Revitalize your commitment to the mandate and strengthen your overall commitment to 
•Ada by adopting VTl today.

1. What can we do to increase the market for Ada goods and services in non¬ 
defense sectors? 

2. What iiivestnients should we make and initiatives should we take to increase the 
commercial use of Ada outside of defense applications? 

3. What can we do to increase Ada’s appeal, adoption, and popularity? 

In answer to these questions several issues come to the forefront , These issues are; 

What is the market 
What needs to be done 
What can I do, as a CASE vendor 
What can DOD do 


What is the market 

Ada was explicitly made to address the software crisis. Thai is Ada’s strength and 
that is Ada’s market. Ada’s market, at least the information Systems (IS or MIS or DP) 
portion of it, consists of a rapidly growing number of Information Systems that are 
impossible to maintain. Furthermore not only is the number of Information Systems growing 
but the systems themselves are also growing in size and complexity. 

It is worth noting that the software crisis, the problem that Ada was created to help 
solve, is net in the nature of a one-time fix like working down a backlog. The real nature of 
the problem is two fold; 

how to produce bigger, better, maintainable, and cheaper systems; 

* how to migrate the current inventory of aging and unmaintainable systems of today 

to the bigger, better, maintainable, and cheaper systems of tomorrow. 

This is no small job. The market is huge. [**$2,300,000,000,000 in COBOL 
maintenance ** SLIDE] This is the market for Ada goods and services. More accurately 
this is Just the Information Systems part of the market. 


What needs to be done 

There are (wo ways of bringing Ada to bear op this market. Both are equally 
important, both are critical to each other’s success, and when both are combined they make 
Ada so powerful as lo be unbeatable. These two ways are; 


Copyright VII October 1993 








1) using Ada to build development support tools such as CASE tools (eg 

ASSERT) and APSEs (eg Rational), and 

2) using Ada as the implementation language for Information Systems. 

The use of Ada-built tools to build Information Systems in Ada has already been 
demonstrated. The STANFINS project of DFAS, an Ada system made by using Ada-built 
tools, achieved staggering productivity gains in the life cycle of the project. Subsequent use 
of the tools and lessons of STANFINS on the STARFIARS project replicated and improved 
the accomplishments. 

STANFINS was done by a staff of COBOL experienced developers using Ada for the 
first time. Some of the results of that first time development and use of Ada-built tools to 
make an Ada-based Information System are; 

* 6 times the industry norm for lines of code production (SLOC per staff- 

month), and 

* from a common repository the: 

* generation of over 75% of 2 million lines of Ada code directly from 

design specs, 

* generation of a full suite of DoD 7935 documentation, 

* the support of all life cycle tasks. 


However the really big results of using Ada have not been shown yet. The really big 
results of using Ada would show up in the maintenance portion of a project’s life cycle. 

Unfortunately STANFINS was not deployed so its life cycle was not continued long 
enough to get a good measurement of maintenance benefits. But based upon the 
demonstrated results and the maintainability that was evidenced in STANFlNS’s software 
acceptance phase, there is every reason to believe that the maintenance benefits would be 
even more staggering than the benefits experienced in the development phases of the life 
cycle. 


When results like these are achieved then it shows that Ada does fulfill its promise 
when used to do what it was made to do. It also shows what happens when the Ada 
mandate is truly enforced and the Ada vision Is vigorously embraced. 


Copyright VII Oc.ober 1993 









The promise of the Ada vision has been proven to be real. The size of the market 
promises huge rewards for putting Ada to work doing what it was made to do. What needs 
to be done is clear: 


ENFORCE THE MANDATE 
EMBRACE THE VISION 


What can I do as a CASE vendor 


Use Ada. Embrace the vision. 

If Ada remains unused then the vision will never be attained. 

What I have done, as a software developer, is use Ada. 1 first used Ada because the 
DOD made me. When the DOD enforced the Ada mandate for STANFINS I had a clear 
choice: dther embrace Ada and get the job done, or find another job. 1 embraced Ada to get 
the job done. 

Now, as a businessman, I use Ada by choice. Knowing the results of using Ada, and 
looking at the market, 1 became a COTS vendor of Ada-built CASE tools. 1 want to get to 
the non-defense market because 1 have an incredible competitive advantage from using Ada. 
All I need is a track record of solving big IS problems and a supply of business cases and 
economic analyses. 

What I will do, as a CASE vendor and a software developer, is commit to using Ada 
in a big way. We challenge the rest of the industry to make the same commitment. Some 
have, and some haven’t. 

The second issue to consider is that 1, or any vendor, niust bring to the market 
capabilities that are comprehensive, fle.xible, affordable, and powerful enough to do the 
job. To offer these capabilities 1 need two things: CASE tools and the expertise to use them. 

Thanks to DOD, and STANFINS, I have Ada which has been proven to be a superior 
tool-building as well as an implementation language. Additional I need some other advanced 
technologies like 4GL and powerful RDBMS but again, thanks in large part to the DOD, 
these technologies are readily available. By using these technologies 1 produce capabilities 
that are comprehensive, flexible, affordable, and powerful. 

The expertise to use Ada in solving IS problems is anotiier matter. The expertise that 
is needed is in twe tightly related areas: tool-users and Ada users. The same things can be 


Copyright VTI October 1993 








said for both. When there are Ada jobs people learn Ada. When vendors use Ada 
technology they transfer the technology to their clients. When the iiumber of pragmatic Ada 
users reach critical mass then significant problem solving will occur and the big job will get 
done. 


What can DOD do 


The single most important thing DOD can do to help the market is to focus on 
tackling the real job and avoid distractions. As the largest single aggregate Information 
System shop in the world DOD faced up to the problem long before the non-defense sector 
did and designed a tool to tackle the problem. DOD tested the tool and it worked. But 
DOD hasn’t put Ada to work in a real way to solve the big problem. 

DOD needs to put Ada to work in a big way by enforcing the Ada mandate across 
the board. The mandate has not been enforced and during that time the real problem of the 
software crisis has not gone away and in fact continues to grow. The failure of the non-Ada 
market over the last 15 years to produce any solutions powerful enough to handle the real 
problem indicates that none are forthcoming. Enforcing the mandate would at the very least 
force DOD Information Systems developers to come to grips with the various principles and 
practices of software engineering. 

If the mandate is not enforced across the board then at least incentivize the use of Ada 
by giving funding priority to projects using Ada and Ada-based tools. 


The second important thing DOD can do is to build an increasing community of 
Ada user expertise. We need significant projects that are held accountable for results, NOT 
protected, sheltered pilot programs. 

When tool-users are held accountable for results then tools are seen as vital. 
Consequently the tool-builders are accountable to the tool-user. As shown by STANFINS 
when tool-builders are responsive to the needs of tool-users then tools are made that enable 
the users to get the job done. Useful tools must be flexible, adaptable, comprehensive, 
affordable and maintainable. When faced with an opportunity to make money by providing 
these kind of tools then vendors will either use a suitable language, i.e. Ada, or miss the 
market. If DOD were to nudge them along that path by requiring some significant amount of 
the tools be in Ada and that the tools support Ada then so much the belter. In the course of 
making Ada-based tools and supporting Ada-based projects vendors will develop Ada-based 
expertise in solving big IS problems. Big IS problem-solving expertise is wiiat is desirable to 
the non-defense market regardless of the language. 


Copyiigh; VTI October 1993 







Get serious about the size and nature of the job by: 

Using CASE tools to put the power of automated development support into the 
developer’s hands to enable them to do their job. 

Using COTS tools so that tools are built and supported by commercial tool- 
builders thereby allowing project resources to be dedicated to making systems 
rather than split between project and tool support. 


Require tools to use Ada thereby increasing the cadre of Ada expertise. 


Make it easy to get to Ada-built and Ada-supportive tools by putting them on 
contract vehicles. 


To move Ada from being from undesired to desired we must: 

Deploy STANFINS so the maintenance benefits of Ada can be documented 
beyond any shadow of a doubt. 

Document and publicize big Ada success stories by producing business cases and 
economic analyses much like the GAO does. 

This should help to; 

Jispel the Ada myths. 

Remove Ada’s stigma of being an intellectual and high-tech tool by putting 
Ada to work in the IS world. 

Increase the number of Ada cadre experienced in solving big IS problems.

Recommendations: 


To increase the use of Ada within commercial 
technologies, the government should: 

1. Make a Firm DoD Commitment 

2. Develop and Maintain Standards...not Software 

3. Popularize Ada 


Recommendation: 

“Who will answer the call of the uncertain trumpet? 


1. Make a Firm Dot) Commitment 


2. Develop and Maintain Standards...not Software 

3. Popularize Ada 










A Simple Business Case 


• Does a need exist for the product? 

• Can we build a new or better product? 

• Can we compete at a profit? 

• Should we risk the capital? 


Does a Need Exist for Ada Products? 

Ada must be used! _ 

The Department of Defense mandated Ada in 1983. (DoD S000.3) 

Public Law mandated Ada in 1991 (PL 101-511). 

Ada should be used by industry and the g overnment! 

Ideal for large complex systems. 

Improves quality and reliability 
Reduces life , ycle costs 
Internationally accepted 

Ada shou ld be used in acade mia!_ 

Embodies principles of Software Engineering 

Allows instruction in concurrency, strong typing, exceptions... 

Ada should be cost-effective for vendors! 


Portability increases the market for vendors products. 

Reusability reduces R&D , reliability reduces bugs, maiciainabihfy makes it easy to fix them. 







Does a Need Exist for Ada Products ? 

Market Perceptions say No! 

Ada is far more reliable and almost as efficient as C but... 

... is still used for most DoD applications 

Ada tools and libraries now exist for MIS systems but... 

... obsolete COBOL systems are still being maintained 

Ada educational products are priced at Pascal and C but... 

... No Service Academies use Ada for Computer Science 1 

Ada has been mandated by the Department of Defense, but... 

... the mandate is largely ignored! 


The Business Case 


Does a need exist for Ada? ?? 

Can we build new or betier products? Yes 
Can WG make a profit? ?? 

Should we risk the capital? * No 









The Certain Trumpet 


. Enforce Existing Ada Mandates 

• Use Ada for CS-1 at Service Academies 

• Achieve Unanimity at this Meeting 

• Publicize DISA Commitment 


DoD Regulation 3000.3 

July 1983 

The intent of the law is that you use Ada: 


7 he Ada programming language shall become the single 
standard computer programming language for all defense 
mission critical applications. ” 






Public Law 101-511 


November 1990 

Unless you can prove otherwise, you must use Ada, 
because: 


"Not withstanding any other provision of law, after June 1, 
1991, where cost effective, all Department of Defense software 
shall be written in the programming language Ada, in the 
absence of special exemption by an official designated by the 

secretary of Defense"

Recommendations:

2. Oeveicp and Maintain Star»dards.„not Software 








Supply and Demand 


If few people are using Ada then 

• Ada products will be expensive 

• Reusable Ada software will be rare 

. DoD Ada systems will be costly and risky 

If many people are using Ada then 

. Ada products will be competitive 

• Ada quality will be increased 

• DoD systems will be cheaper and better 

Therefore, it makes sense for the government to help 
popularize Ada! 


Thoughts on Popularizing Ada 


“Ada must become the language of choice.,, 
not the language of mandate!” 


“People must use Ada because they want to., 
not because they have to!” 


“Ada must come from the bottom up, not the top down!” 


“If Ada is e\ er to be popular, then Ada compilers 
for the PC must have all the features of other 
languages, and must be fun and easy to use!”

State of the Art of Ada 


''You can now do anything in Ada that you can do in C or 
C++ and do it faster, better, and more reliably; therefore, 
there is no reason to grant waivers for the use of the C 
programming language!” 


Recommendations: 

To stimulate the use of Ada, the government 
can help popularize Ada by: 

Refusing to grant waivers __ 

PC applications of any kind {C++), 

MIS upgrades (COBOL) 

Artificial Intelligence (LISP) 

Windows (C or Visual Basic) 

DBMS (Oracle,Informix,etc) 

Dem an ding th e Stat e-o f the-Art in DoD Sys tems 

Modernize Ada PC’s in DoD Computer Schools 

Mandate Ada in Service Academies 

Specify State-of-the-Art capabilities in new RFP’s 

Mandate Technology Upgrades on existing PC contracts (DTIV)

A Key Problem 



An IMMOVABLE 
OBJECT 

The User Community 



The Mandate may not in Itself be Sufficient 
to Cause the Lisei Community to Move 
(It has not, so far) 

What are the Factors that Imj>ede 
Movement? 



A Success Story 

The USNA High Speed Fleet Broadcast System 


^ Real Time Embedded System 

★ Mandated Software Documentation in Ada 

★ RJO delivered the HSFB System and Software: 

- On Time 

- Within Budget 

- To Specification (as existing at the time of Delivery) 

★ System has been Successfully Installed aboard Operational 
Ships and Shore Stations 

★ Delivery of more than 50 Systems to Date 


A Success Story 

The USNA High Speed Fleet Broadcast System 

★ System Control Software Developed and Documented using 
RJO’s Auto-G CASE Tool Set 

- Requirements Analysis 

- Design (All Levels) 

★ The Delivered Ada Code generated using RJO’s Autoada Code 
Generator 

★ The Generated Ada Code Compiled and Executed without 
Manual Modification or Intervention 

★ Maintenance Performed Only at the Design Level 

- Any Design Modifications Carried Out Using Auto-G 

-- New Ada Code is Generated from the Modified Design (No Hacking 
or Patching)

★ The Ada Gap is Significant, in Particular for Real '’'ime Embedded 
Systems 

★ For the HSFB Systesn the Ada Gap was Successfully Bridged by 
the automated Ada Code Generation Anchored in Auto-G 


> If the Ada Gap is Too Wide and Cannot bo Successfully 3 ridged 
the User Community WilS Not Jump 




Mandated Use of Ada will not Reduce the Ada Gap 










How Can the Ada Gap Be Bridged or Reduced? 


★ By Using Auto-G or some CASE Tool with Similar Capabilities to 
Generate Ada83 Code 

- Does Not Reduce the Ada Gap 

- Will Not Permanently Bridge the Ada Gap Unless the Generated 
Code is 100% Executable (No Hacking or Patching of the Generated 
Code 

- Significant Performance Overhead 

★ By Using Ada9X 

- Significantly Reduces the Ada Gap. 

- The Remaining Gap may be Bridged much more Simply than for 
Ada83 and Without the Performance Overhead
