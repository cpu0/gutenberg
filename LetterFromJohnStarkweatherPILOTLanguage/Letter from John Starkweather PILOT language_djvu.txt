Dear Ted: 




This will give you some of the history of how PILOT got 
started. I started playing with the idea of a simplified 
interactive aid in about 1960 and I called my first attempts 
COMPUTES! 1 . The design philosophy grew out of experimentation 
with an IBM 1620 computer that arrived on the DC San Francisco 
campus in 1961. Somewhere I have a 5-minute 16mm film showing 
what it looked like at about that time. In 1965 I obtained a" 
grant from the U.S. Office of Education that supported further 
development and application of PILOT 1 s predecessor, CGMPUTEST, 
m a nearby elementary school district. I will enclose a 
copy of a 1966 issue of an early EDUCOM bulletin that 
oescrioes sometning about this program (see page 3 in the 
bul 1 et in) . 

My first publication of a cescr iption of the 
language was in 1969 (1,2). Since tnen many people have 

implemented it on a variety of macnines. In 1973 a group of 
people in the San Francisco oay area interested in computer- 
cased instruction worked with me to define a standard "core** 
to the language ana specify the manner in which extensions 
should be made. This is called the PILOT *73 standard, 
reierred to in the Ramp ana Starkweather article that I will 
enclose ( 3 ) . 



In the initial design of PILOT, we were trying to make it work 
on a number of time-sharing systems. The continuing problems 
that users had with remote communication made me keep looking 
for a way to return to a single-user machine. The micros were 
not yet here, but the Datapoint desktop computer seemed a 
possibility. Although it was expensive ($12,000 for a 12K 
machine with two cassettes), a grant, this time from the 
National Library of Medicine, allowed the experiment to be 
ir. ace. As it turned out, Dstapo int had been in a joint venture 
with Intel in the design of the 8008 processor, so what I 
developed was a program in 8G08 code, later converted to the 



1 



8080 . 



Datapoint PILOT is still in use at (JCSF. 



I have just completed a greatly extended version of PILOT that 
runs on 8080 ana Z80 microcomputers under the CP/M operating 
system. It has advantages over other extended versions I have 
seen, since it remains compatible with the PILOT *73 standards 
but aoos many useful items to the toolkit. The creation of 
CP/M oata files is an obvious example, as is the much improved 
ability to manipulate string, nun, eric, and logical variables. 
It nas a lot of similarity to ATARI PILOT in some of its 
functions, and it still maintains the basic simplicity of the 
language. An integrated screen editor makes PILOT program 
development an easy interactive process. 



Sincerely ,
