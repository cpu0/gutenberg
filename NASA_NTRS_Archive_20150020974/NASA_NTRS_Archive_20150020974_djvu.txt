Application Background 


• Application - Payload Integration Tool (PIT) 

• Purpose 

- Provide Configuration Management on delivered payload data 

- Validate data 

- Generate integrated products for down stream processors 

• Re-engineered from IMS application 

• Restriction 

- Must fit with existing legacy applications (process OS390 PDS) : 

- Must adhere to strict security measures 

• Data Files 

- Input: PDS from Legacy System; XML from new system 

- Output: PDS for delivered products 

• Massive Data Movement/Manipulation 

• Size - 2M to 10M per flight

Features 


• Data Loaded into Intermediate Tables 

- To satisfy verification requirements 

- XML (JAR file) => Java XML Parser => Intermediate Tables 

- PDS => SQL*Loader => Intermediate Tables 

• Data Merged from Intermediate into Master Tables 

• All PIT data manipulation are performed on Master Tables 

• Process Execution 

- Using Oracle as the “middle man” between Application Server and OS390 

- PDS data are copied in/out of USS using batch JCL 

- Continuously running processor on OS390 to pick up batch job in the 
queue, submit job, and update completion code 

• Data Cleanup 

— Scheduled nightly DBMS Jobs to clean up data marked for deletion 

• Lots of PL/SQL stored procedures/functions

Features (continued) 


• Generated products are stored in tables to allow viewing and writing to file 
system without re-generating 

• Query results are generated in XML to provide wide range of data distribution 
and are formatted into HTML and PDF documents

Development Proce ss 

• Utilizing RUP (Rational Unified Process) with existing processes 
- Build a little, test a little 


Implement the most risky, the most complicated, (requirements) the least 
stable UseCase first 

• The Good 

- UseCase Specification forces user involvement 

— Allowed requirements/design/code to mature ALMOST concurrently 

- Early verification catches error early in the cycle 

• The Ugly 

— Frustration level very high for first iteration

Wish List 

We wish... 

• BFILE feature worked in Oracle 8.1.5 (supposed to be in 8.1.7) 

• Oracle would provide OCI support for USS 

• Stored procedure supports Java (supposed to be in 8.1.7) 

• UTL_FILE supports NFS mounted data files
