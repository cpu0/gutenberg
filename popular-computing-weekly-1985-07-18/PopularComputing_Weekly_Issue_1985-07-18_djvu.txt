Already there is an MSX 
version with Electnc Software 
developing Spectrum and QL 
versions. Other UK firms will 
be working on adaptors (or 
the Commodore 84, BBC B, 
and other leading micros. 

Eleclric Software's own 
range of Rom games for the 
MSX is already available on 
credit card - or Sofcaid, as 
Astat calls il - retailing at 
between £14.95 and £19,95.

anii-piracy device. Accord- 
ing 10 Mike Hall, Electric Soft-

Activision and tIS Gold are

The major drawback, how- 
ever, is price - as Mike Hall U 
ready to adrml. "If we cannot 
gel the price of gai 
Sofcard to £9.95 within a year, 
the whole thing will tail," 

At presenl, Aslar haa pro- 
duced Rom cards, which 
have lo have the program put 
on the chip at the factory, and 
Epiom cards, which users 
can write to once only.

He also suggested that Sin- 
clair was close lo getting 
funding for the project, which 
has been estimated to require 
some £50 million. 
• He also confirmed that the 
Pandora, the Sinclair IZSK 
portable micro under devel- 
opmenl, would be compali- 
bie with Ihe Spectrum, sup- 
porting Sir Clive's recent 
slalemenl on Thames TV's 
Database thai the Pandora 
would use Specmim, rather 
than OL, microdrives. 

If so, Ihe Pandora would 
have to include a Z80 or com- 
patible chip, but Richard Cul- 
ling also remarked that "the 
era of the Z80 is coming lo an 
end" and went on to suggest 
Ihat the 6B000 was its logical 



applicanons. 

Amongst these are security 
devices, keys and small 
credn cards. Husinesa soft- 
ware houses are apparently 
parncnlarly inleresled in

the hideous, unspeakable, in- 
credibly dumb - the Trivia

the questions are pretty ob-

a biologist who studies smut

have gueased that the answer

adds to Ihe fun. Being an 
American game, the ques- 
tions ate all related to the 
USA, so they can prove to be 
a bit taxing tor us Bnts. (Do 
you know how the Qeveland

Making small talk 

The end of the line for Basic? Boris Allan looks at the state 
of languages today and speaks his mind 

Whilst home computers adll, 
stubbornly, come equipped 
with BaEic ihere la every rea- 
son to believe that Basic's days are 
numbered, Thsie are a numbei ot de- 
velopments in computer languages that 
go beyond tinkerings between difteient 
versions of Basic but fundamenlally re- 
way itopeiales. 

The future looks mteresting because, 
increasingly, computing is becoming in- 
leracbve. and the environment in which 
computing takes place is becoming 



frame and supercomputer, i 



a. Given the 



ed only by speed of execuli 
increased importance of 
lions networks, where micro can lauc lo 
supercomputer and let the 
supercomputer do the work, the concept 
of the 'micro' as an independent ma- 
chine iE going lo seem less relevant. 

Tlus convergence is explained by 
many factors, bul the main reason is the 
mcreaamg importance of the operatmg 
system, and the effect this is having on 
the lartguages we use. First, however, 
'language 



(he scale m compuiei operation. Pro- 
graitmiing languages occupy various 
pDinia along the continuum [rom ma- 
chine code to operating system, and 
some operating systems overlap in their 
capabilities vnlh some programming 
languages. 

The difference balwaen an operating 
syalem, a programming language, and 
machine code, is best illustrated by how 
each copes with the peripherals and 
devices attached to the computer. For 
example, control of a device (say a 
printer) by use of machine-code pro- 
grams is usually a matter ot depositing 
information m specific computer loca- 
, main- tions according to specific rules. An 
starting ordinary programming language usual- 
irenliBt- ly controls a device by name, without the 
having 



very high-level operating system. C 
does not depend upon tfnii. C is s 
language which gives almost complete 
control over the workings ol your com- 
puter {a bit like Forth) bul in a more 
human maimer than most Forth syElems. 
I have chosen a systems programming 
language as one of my four languages of 
the future because such a language ful- 
fills a particular and unique aet of 
requirements. 

Alan Kay, one of the key language 
irmovBlors - author of the icons lan- 
guage, Smalltalk, believes there is no 
real need for operating syslems, be- 
cause the programming language 
should fully contain and therefore 



place Ihe operatmg system. V 



Kay n

rks, eg, Ltist. An operating 
system, however, will frequently allow 
the primer to be accessed via an on- 
screen command, so that the printer 
becomes only one of a range of possible 
Outpul devices (including disc fUes). 

The extensiveness of an operating sys- 
tem is reflected by the system's ability to 
control the devices available to the pro- 
grammer. The more powerful and the

computers illustrate such 



- Functional programming languages output needed by any programnung 



(lor example, Apl): 
' Object oriented languages (for exam- 
ple. Smalltalk-8D); 

- List processing languages (for exam- 
ple. Lisp or Logo); 

- System programmmg languages (tor 
example, C or BCPL), 

Different aspects of these languages 
will interact to produce new hybrids 
such as Objectve-C [an object oriented 
systems programming language), but 
these are the four key styles in the future 
development of programnung 



system, and it is for this reason that 1 
think It IB useful to establish what 
distuiguishes an operating system from a 
prDgramming language, flapads such 
as windowmg, use of mouse, or drawing 
by turtle graphics are relatively unim- 
portant, because all these facililies can 
be emulated in most languages. What is 
important are the other things a lan- 
guage can do. 

If you consider machine code as being 
the fundamental level of computer oper- 
adon. in that computers function by exe- 
cuting sei]uences of instructions ex- 
preasad as machine code, than an 
operating system is the opposite end of 



language. Unix, for example 
many facihties (indeed an abundance) 
for controlling the operation of the sys- 
tem, thai the prograimning language 
developed to implement Unix has ab- 
surdly simple input and output facilitieB. 
C is a very low-level programming

somethmg which can accept information

in some way which is specific lo the 
object, and then return information (a 
message) in a suitably modified form. 

For example, if the object is the vari-

(such as Cobol ot Fojtran) whose whole 
aim is lo crunch numbers or {in the case 
of Cobol) peiform simple sums. Recently 
certain numerical piogrammers have 
isolated the 'von Neumann bottleneck' in 
languages such as Cobol or Fortran, 
where the bottleneck ia how quickly data 
can pass through via the data bus. When 
a computer pertorma its operabora 
can only perform one acuon at a lii 
though amazingly quickly in the caai 
some computers. Traditional piogi* 
ming languages, such as Algol, Pascal, 
or Basic, were developed around ideas 
which assumed the boitleneclt: every- 
thing was repetitive, one step at a tin 
because the computet was repetili' 



sum - sum ' array (count) 

in no language m particular. The idea is 
that it would be far better to say some- 
thing like; 
apply + array 

that IS. apply the plus operator lo the 
elements of the array, The reaull of this 
approach is to produce languages which 

Neumann computers, but with multiple 
processors (and parallel computers) 

(APL IS one example). For numerical 
work in particular, such languages are 
far better suited to newer lorms of 
computer. 

My final style of language tot the 
future are the list processing languages 
Buch as Lisp or Logo, both of which are 
languages of greatflexibihty in database 
apphcaliona, or Gelds such as Amfidal 
Intelligence and Expert Systems. 
Though both Lisp and Logo overlap with 
Smalllalk in that Smalltalk also has hst 

difference m orientation for me lo be- 
lieve in llieir separate futures. Given 
the undoubted benefits of some of 
the techniques of Al, list processing 
specific languages are bound to contin- 




perfectly suited for every type of appU- 
cation, so there will always be a demand 
for specific types of language (such as 
those isolated above). 

Foe example, list processing lan- 
guages such as Logo are capable of 
constiucling very complex data atiuc- 
turea (due lo the power of the idea of a 
'list'), bul this strength is bought al the 
expense of speed ol execution for float- 
ing point arithmetic. In theory, a lan- 
guage could be all powerful and all 
enccmpassmg (as could an intelbgent 
computer?), bul the size ot such a lan- 
guage translator would be so large Ihat 
problems would be created. 

Even if Ram was so cheap that it did not 
present any problem, and a processor 
was so fast that it could cope (or multiple 
piocesBors could cope), there are cer- 

' 1 rather more insoluble probU

■ how unreli- 

makes more sense to nave specific lan- 
guage systems (with good general facili- 
ties) where each language can easily 
communicate its results for use by other 
languages. For such an arrangement we 
need an operating system, preferably an 
environment which is also a language. 
This IB my fumie scenario. The micro 



In practice, no language could aver be puta 






fisentially a total 



(such as Smalltalk), where the appear- 
ance of the screen display has much in 
commonwith the Xerox Star workstation 
or Hie Tektronix M04 Artificial Intelli- 
gence System (like the Mac or ST). The 
object oriented system produces a co- 
herent, consistent environment in which 
the user can program, can use pack- 
ages, or can use the computer to commu- 
nicate with other systems. 

For many purposes the abject orient- 
ed language will fulfil all the lequire- 
menla for general programming, but for 
specific types of application the user will 
choose to use one of ihe other types of 
language. The object oriented language 
is inleraclive, and distfnciions between 
compilateis and interpreters will be- 
come less obvious (and much less 
important). 

Operating syslema on microcomput- 
ers are becoming more important all the 
tune, and languages are developmg so 
quickly th^t - given the relative dedine 
m Ihe cost of hardware - in a few years 
cheap systems with the facilities of the 
Tektronix 4404 will be with us. 

The liberation of the individual which 
started with the Apple E will grow 
apace, as computers become far more 
open systems with fewer restrictions - 
and that's good news for everybody, not 
just programmers.

who wanled computing power, without One feels forced 



having 

learning a low-level programming 

language. 

Thus, in the middle 19BOs, the need for 
a high-level progtammmg language 
evolved. Thai ia, a way of communicat- 
ing with the eompuler without an inti- 
mate knowledge of what is gomg on 
inside. Look at a short example - the 
Basic program; 10 Inpot a 20 Pnnl a. The 
piograra will read a amgle number mput 
from the keyboard and then pnnl it to 

Now think of the actual machine opera- 
tions involved m this 'simple' process, 



ask the big ques- 

why? Why can't we all write in 

Basic? Why go lo the bother of develop- 
ing new languages when there are so 
many around already? 

Mr David May, Chief Computer Archi- 
tect at inmos, the British aemi-conduclot 
manufacturer, is as well qualified as the 
nest person to answer such questions. 
He is the author of one such new comput- 
er language - Occam - designed 10 
complement Inmos' novel Transputer 



key words of the artificial inlelligenca 
world of Ihe SIh generation computer. 

Many modem computer appbcalions 
demand that several tasks be undertak- 
en at the same time - David gave the 
example ol his work with mobile robots 
in the early 703. 

"It was difficult using conventional 
sequential programming (that ia. as m 
Basic, when one instruction is earned out 
at a time). Our robot needed to move 
and analyse sensory information at the 
same lime. Switching from one task lo 
another tended 10 produce very jerky 
movement." 

The other nend that led lo Ihe devel- 
opment of Occam was the progress of 
VLSI (Very Large Scale Integtahon) chip 
technology - not totally unconnected 
with Inmos' own Transputer chip- 

"The usual Von Neumann-type c... 
puler architecture assumed that pro- 
cessing power was expensive com- 
pared to memory - so you had one 
central processor linked to memory by 
one data bus. But wilh Memory/Proces- 
sor equality now m bolh size and cost, 
'his all changes." 
The tesull is thi

he explained, grinning broadly. "It's 
p'rogr'am LtseU only when you start getting downjo «

Much of the groundwork towards the 
cieaQon of Occam had been done din- 
ing David's research into conciuienl 
programming al Warwick Univeiaity in 
' mid-seventies: in Tact when writing it, 
he deliberately anempled lo take the 

going on in concurrency about thai time. 
Initially, a great deal ol effort waa 
spent in defining what he calls Ihe 'Se- 
mantics' of the language. "Generally (o 



writing is putting things in which only 
mighr be needed. Soon it then becomes 
bulky and unwieldy - and once you've 
put 3 particular feature in, it's harder to 

With only 23 leaerved command 
words ' no-one can claim that Occam is a 
bulky language, "Each additional con- 
cept is genuinely adding something 
quite new," claims David, He continued, 
"Having got aome kind ol spec, t would 
write a very rough compiler lo satisfy 
myself it would implement various 
things efficiently. 1 was writing the m- 
stTuction Get for the Transputer at the 



on the 68000-basad Sage IV machme, ao 
It could be adapted with relative ease for 
the ST and ilmiga machines - the home 
rtiicro market may yet see a version of 
Occam! 

Bui what would be its advantages over 
a decent Basic? "It depends what you 
wanted lo -do. It you wanted to write

May maintains that his new language 
genuinely offera something novel and 
isn't just a rehash of an existing system. 
"] think a lot of language development in 
Ihe 1970s was teniiing lo elaborate on 
existing sequenlial languagea instead of 
presenting new ideas." 

Occam waa named after the t4th cen- 
tury Engliah philosopher William of Oc- 
1, whose learned principle can be 
abbreviated to: 'If in doubt, leave it out.' 
David apphed this rigorously to Occam.

I 'iormahsm'. The idea is that a

programs and simula- 
nons. uiven tne potential size and com- 
plexity of multi-processor systems, such 
tests could never bo eihauative, so Oc- 
cam adheres to a number of formalisdc 
principles: good structure, no jumps and 
no pointers. 

Although Occam waa designed in tan- 
dem with the Transputer, May hopes he 
has produced a new language of general 



aehilnea 
There is 



n running al present 



He does stress the ease of wntmg 
programs in Occam - several universi- 
ties now use it as a 6ial language lo teach 
concuirency. "There are tricks in Ihe 
compiler and the instruction set that the 
progianimei doean'l need lo worry 
about. What 1 tried was lo present appli- 
cations programmers with a virtual ma- 

the applicaBon and only lO"'.. on Che

Over 6,000 copies of the Occam Pro- 
gramming Manual have been sold now - 
and It IS Bigni&canl that half have found 
their way to Ihe Land of the Rising Sun - 
underlining the fact that Occam has been 
tipped as one of the possible Sih Genera-

Fast saving and loading on (he CPC464 
brought to you by Brian Cadge 



mhe CPC's casselle syslem

of speeds; two are 
1000 and 2000 baud. 






speeds, saving a 


creen dump 


otape 



s. This is mainly 






and read back in blQ 
long. Between each block there 
interblock gap and header of about five 
aeconds. This is there lo allow Basic to 
perform operations on the data read in 
(especially on text files). On long tiles ol 
continuous data, such as screen duinpa, 
these gaps simply waste time. 

The program presented here adds 
two new RSX commands to Basic. These 
are fSave and \FLoad. They allow 
screen dumps (or any olher block of data 
from memory), to be saved as one con- 
tinuous block at the ^tesl safest speed 
ol 2200 baud. This speeds up loading 
times dramalically; for example, the 
screen dump now saves and loads at 
twice the speed of the normal 3000 band 
save/load commands. For longer sec- 
tions of data the saving is even benec. 

The commands suppon filenames of 
up to 20 characters long and upper/ 
lower case is significant. The syntax al 
the commands are as follows. The .fS^ve 
command is followed by the Glename 
string, and optionally the start and length 
□I the data. Q only the filename is given, 
as in the following; ft- "Piciuib- 
-■ l":,FSavB,@lS, (hen the program as- 
sumes that a screen dump is lo be saved, 
and the data saved starts al 49 132 and is 
163B4 bytes long. 

You can save any other block of data 
by using tfie full formal of the command 
as follows; lt= "Data File- 1 ": FSave. 
@a,30000.5000, the memory starting at 
address 30000 will be saved for SOOO 
bytes. A 30 byte header is saved before 
the data block, clus contains the filename, 
slarl and length values. There will be no 
prompts lo 'Press Play', etc, with these 
new ccimmands. Pleasing £scwill report 
an Input/Output error, as wiU faulty tape 

The FLoad command has three lor- 
mats. In its simplest form, \FLoad on its 
own will load in the Brsl FSavsd file it 
finds, regardless of filename. The fol- 
lowing messages are output by the 
\FLoad command; "Searching. . ," 
means that [FLoad is still nailing to find 
an FSavBd file. 

"Found: filename" means that \FLfiad 
tias found the file 'filename' but this does 
not match the filename given, so i1 is 
being skipped over, and "Loaduig: 
Slsname" means that the file is being 
loaded. 



The second formal of the FLoad com- 
mand is to follow it by the spe<nfic 
filename to be loaded, as in; 
/S= "Picnire-y':\FLoad,@£S any file en- 
countered before "Piclure-I" will be 
skipped over. Finally, Ihe third formal of 
the FLoad conmiand is to add an option^ 
al '1' to the end as in; ff- "Piciure- 
1": FLoad, @ffl,I. This tells the program 
not to print any messages, although Er- 
ror messages are always printed. This 
last option is useful from within pro- 
grams lo stop a screen display being 
ilistuibed. It is logically similar lo add- 
ing an 'I' as the fiisl ' 



As different sync characters are used 
in the headers of the lieader and data 
blocks, the normal CPC casselle com- 
mands LcadlSavejCal. etc, will not 
recognise FSaved files and will skip 
over them, and similarly, iFloadwill not 
recognise files saved by the normal CPC 
commands and will skip over Ihem, 

To use the program, type in and save 
the Basic Loader program, taking care, 
asalways, with the data statements. Once 
this has been Run successfully it can be 
NeWBd and Ihe two new commands will 
be available until the machine is Reset or 
turned off. Of courae, it is not worth 
loading in the new commands if you only 
intend to save small amounts of data, but 
for a program, such as a screen designer 
where screens are to l>e saved arid 
loaded frequently, the time saved is well 
worth the eHon of typing in the program.

program listing, 

A Forth screen is simply a work area 
cotisisting of 16 lines of 64 characters, on 
3 which Forth words are placed in 
leanmgful order. The Imes are num- 
bered from to 15. If you consider a 
Basic program listing, divide it into 
groups ol 16 lines (making sure that no 
IE longer than 64 characters), then 
have just envisaged what a Forth 
>n looks Uke. Each screen has a 

White Lightning this IS 12 screens for ihe 
■ ised version (which must keep all 
1 m memory), and 38 screens for 

ost versions of Forth, screens 
ig used are stored m memory buff- 
called Blocks. These are 10S4 char- 
rs long (16 • 641), and in theory 
ate lo disc storage, in other words. 

the Forth system, it is always m the basic 
of the block - you can only read oi 
e whole blocks. However, because 
t micro-computers do not have discs 

characters. Fig-Forth defines a variable 
called BjScr. This is the number of disc 
■ ■ ■ ■ irs) that make op on 1034 

chara clerscreen. 

nmce does this have to 
1541 disc drive owners? Simply thai each 
Forth screen consists of four blocks of 
l56 characters, which are exactly equiv- 
Jent to disc sectors. Tha program given 
n this article is uilended to lei users 
ccess Forth screens using normal Basic. 
However, since Ihe principle involved is 
simply to read sectors and display them 



display their 
sefiil form; for example, examining the 
omenta o! tha directory track (track 18). 
As it stands, the program will Hst four 



1 simply a matter 
of adding code after line 1430 to replace 
non-printable characters by (say) a 'V 
symbol. For further information on this. 
see the program notes. 

In order lo imderstand the program, it 
is necessary to look at how the 1541 
works to allow random accessmg of disc 
sectors. The 1541 has a small amount of 
workspace Ram (about 2K) used for sys- 
tem variables and also a number of S5S 
byte buSera used for translering data to 
and from the computer. Any readmg or 
writing of sectors is performed by copy- 
ing the entire contents of the sector to or 
buffers. At the same 
kept of exactly how 
many bytes within the bufler are valid 
data. When the user attempts to read 
beyond this value, an end-of-lile

is the command channel, which la num-

access the data from one ol the 266 byte 
buffers. To show that we wish lo access 
one of these buffers, we use a filename of 
■'#" (see tine 1 130). The drive will auto- 
matically assign one of Ihe buffers to this

columns, but it will have a chatty light- 
heaited approach. I will give more inf or- 

they won^l have to send any money 
without knowmg what it is all about." 
Nick can offer help in a vast range of 
advenmiea, including the Zorks. Myate- 
nous. Level 93, Arties and all the popular 
new releases. "Please ask your readers 
to send any adventure-related articles, 
aitwork or reviews in exchange for free 
copies, and general help and their ad- 
dress in order to build up a large 
helpline base." 

The best way to ensure that these 
clubs work is, first of all, for the 
organisers to make very sure they are 
set up to handle the mass of enquiries 
that they will certainly get. Particularly if 
money is mvolved. the set-up musr be 
capable of keeping labs on a large mem- 
bership, and keeping everyone happy. 
The second requisite is psrtidpaCion or 
the part of the membaiB - if you wan 
help in an adventure, send details of 
another game that you have completed, 
with maps where poaaibie. or even •' 
tails of your progress so tar, 

A regular correspondent lo the C 
ner is Hugh Walker, ol Guildford. ^ 
will probably recogiuae his name if i 
are a regular reader, and 1 should have 
mentioned his sterling cartographic 
abilities m the piece on Lords of Time a 
little while ago. This time he says: "Us 
■mere mortals' (see the Comer of 20-26 
June) are the equal of Beebeis in devi- 
ousness. We too can take a peek at the 
dictionary of Level 9 games (prior to 
Erik the Viking, after which the games 
are Breakprolected). Here's how: 
Break and irisl the program, then 
PrinlFiJ'rintC and note the values,

there, try other limits lor Loop F. When

only 3D, more commonly as-

Curious.

the music is good, some o( the
