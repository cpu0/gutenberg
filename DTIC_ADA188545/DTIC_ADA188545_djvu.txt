15. COMPUTER PRODUCT ABSTRACT ^ j 

3' The Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC) is a suite of tests designed to deter- | 
mine an Ada compiler's conformance to MIL-STD-1815A, the Ada Language Reference Manual 
(LMR). Version 1.10 was released in December 87 and will become the official ACVC ' 
version, replacing 1.9, in June 88. ACVC 1.10 will be the official version until 
June 89 when it eill be replaced by ACVC version 1.11. 

Each of the 3719 tests in the ACVC 1.10 is designed to test a single test objective 
specified in the Ada Implementer’s'Guide (AIG), a document enumerating the LRM into 
discrete test objectives in order to aid compiler development. 





CTWTBTTBd t.Software Description: The model is written in the Ada 
programming language for implementation on a DEC VAX-11/780 computer 
using the YMS^opgizating..system. Memory reguirement is ..3,D JC.bytes.-
