1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: A, 
B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class to 
v^ich it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B and 
class L tests are expected to produce errors at compile time and link time, 
respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking maurmer and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result vhen they 
are executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, 
and the procedure CHECK FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT 
also provides a set of Identity functions used to defeat some compiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada standard are detected. Scxne of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code vhich must not be flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately compiled units. Errors 
are expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In scxne tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values — for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in Appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and 
implementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this implementation are described in section 2.3. 


1-2 



INTRCOUCTION 


For each Ada in^lementation, a customized test suite is produced by the 
AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications described in 
the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see section 2.1), and 
possibly removing some inapplicable tests (see section 2.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each test of 
the customized test suite according to the Ada Steuidard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are irrelevant 
for a given Ai^ implementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may 
be supported by documents issued by the ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Ccmmientaries £uid commonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Ccmnentaries are included as 
appropriate.

C35713C, B86001U, and C86006G check for the predefined type 

LCMj_FLQAT; for this implementation, there is no such type. 


C35713D and B860012 check for a predefined floating-point type with a 
name other than FLOAT, LCM3r_FLQAT, or SHORT_FLClAT; for this 
implementation, there is no such type. 


A35801E checks that FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST may loe used as a range 
constraint in a floating-point type declaration; for this 
implementation, that range exceeds the range of safe numbers of the 
largest predefined floating-point type and must be rejected. (See 
section 2.3.) 


C45531M..P and C45532M..P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations for 
types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or greater; for this 
implementation, MAX_MANTISSA is less than 47. 

C45624A..B (2 tests) check that the proper exception is raised if 
MACHINE_JVERfIjCWS is FALSE for floating point types euid the results of 
various floating-point operations lie outside the range of the base 
type; for this inpleme-itation, MACHINE_OVERFLCWS is TRUE. 

B86001Y uses the name of a predefined fixed-point type other than type 
DORATIC»l; for this implementation, there is no such type. 

C96005B uses values of type DURATICW's base type that are outside the 
range of type DURATICW; for this implementation, the ranges are the 
same. 


CD1009C checks whether a length clause can specify a non-default size 
for a floating-point type; this iitplementation does not support such 
sizes. 


2-2 





IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use length clauses 
to specify non-default sizes for access types; this inplementation 
does not support such sizes. 

The tests listed in the following tc±»le check that USE_ERROR is raised 
if the given file operations are not supported for the given 
combination of mode and access method; this iinjlementation supports 
these operations.

IMPLEMENTATIOJ DEPENDENCIES 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIC»IS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 23 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
inplementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the 
way expected by the original tests. 

B24009A B33301B B38003A B38003B B38009A 

B38009B B85008G B85008H BC1303F BC3005B 

BD2B03A BD2D03A BD4003A 


A35801E was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by 
the AVO. The con^iiler rejects the use of the remge 

FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST as the range constraint of a floating-point type 
declaration because the bounds lie outside of the range of safe numbers 
(cf. LRM 3.5.7:12). 

CD1009A, CD1009I, CD1C03A, CD2A22J, CD2A24A, CD2A31A..C (3 tests) were 
graded passed by Evaluation Modification as directed by the AVO. These 
tests use insteintiations of the support procedure LENGTH_CHECK, vhich uses 
Unchecked_Conversion according to the interpretation given in AI-00590. 

The AVO ruled that this interpretation is not binding \ander ACVC 1.11; the 
tests are ruled to be passed if they produce Failed messages only from the 
instances of LENGTH_CHECK—i.e, the allowed Report.Failed messages have 
the general form; 

" * CHECK ON REPRESENTATION FOR <TYPE 1D> FAILED." 


AD9001B was graded passed by Test Modification as directed by the AVO. 
This test checks that no bodies are required for interfaced subprograms; 
among the procedures that it uses is one with a parameter of mode OUT 
(line 36). This iiH)lementation does not support pragma INTERFACE for 
procedures with parameters of mode OUT. Tne test was modified by 
commenting out line 36 euid 40; the modified test was passed.

3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming 
Language Standard, vdiether the test is applicable or inapplicable; 
otherwise, the Ada Inplementation fails the ACVC [Pro90]. 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was

Itie list of items below gives the number of ACVC tests in various 
categories. All tests were processed, except those that were withdrawn 
because of test errors (item b; see section 2.1), those that require a 
floating-point precision that exceeds the implementation's maximum 
precision (item e; see section 2.2), and those that depend on the support 
of a file system — if none is supported (item d). All tests passed,

3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
talcen on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were loaded onto a RDI Britelite ITX laptop eund copied over 
Ethernet to the host computer. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host conputer, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada inplementation. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the customer and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a complete listing of 
the processing options for this implementation. It also indicates the 
default options. The options invoked explicitly for validation testing 
during this test were;

Test output, compiler and linker listings, emd job logs were captured on 
magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site by 
the validation team were also archived.

COMPILATICW SYSTEM OPTIONS 


The compiler options of this Ada in 5 )leinentation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer, unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to compiler documentation and 
not to this report. 


Syntax 

ada {options] [source_file]... (linker_options] 
[object_file.o]... 

IDescription 

The conmand ada executes the Ada compiler and coopiles the 
named Ada source file, ending with the .a suffix. The file 
must reside in a VADS library directory. The ada.lib file in 
this directory is modified after each Ada unit is compiled. 

The object for each compiled Ada unit is left in a file with 
the same name as that of the source with 01, 02, etc. 
substituted for .a. The -o option can be used to produce an 
executable with a name other than a.out, the default. For 
cross compilers, the default name is a.vox. 

By default, ada produces only object and net files. If the 
-N option is used, the compiler automatically invokes a.Id 
and builds a complete program with the named library unit as 
the main program. 

Non-Ada object files (.o files produced by a compiler for 
another language) may be given as arguments to ada. These 
files will be passed on to the linker and will be linked 
with the specified Ada object files. 

Command line options may be specified in any order, but the 
order of compilation and the order of the files to be passed 
to the linker can be significant. 


B-1 






COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


Several VADS compilers may be simultaneously available on a 
single system. Because the ada command in any 
VADS location/bin on a system will execute the correct 
ccxnpTler ccm^nnents based upon visible library directives, 
the option -sh is provided to print the name of the 
ccxnponents actually executed. 

Program listings with a disassembly of machine code 
instructions are generated by a.db or a.das. 

Options 

-a file_name (archive) Treat file_name as an ar file. 

Since some archive files end with .a, -a is used to 
distinguish archive files from Ada source files. 

-d (dependencies) Analyze for dependencies only. Do not do 
semantic analysis or code generation. Update the library, 
marking any defined units as xonccmipiled. The -d option is 
used by a.make to establish dependencies among new files. 

-e (error) Process compilation error messages using a.error 
emd send it to standard output. Only the source lines 
containing errors are listed. Only one -e or -E option 
should be used. 


-E 


-E file 

-E directory (error output) Without a file or directory 
argument, ada processes error messages using a.error euid 
directs a brief output to standard output; the raw error 
messages are left in ada_source.err. if a file pathname is 
given, the raw error messages are placed in that file. If a 
directory argum»^nt is suf^lied, the raw error output is 
placed in dir/source.err. Ihe file of raw error messages can 
be used as input to a.error 

-el (error listing) Intersperse error messages among source 
lines and direct to standard output. 


-El 


-El file 

-El directory (error listing) Same as the -E option, except that 
source listing with errors is produced. 

-ev (error vi(l)) Process synteuc error messages using 
a.error, embed them in the source file, and call the 
environment editor ERROR_EDITOR. (If ERROR_EDITOR is 
defined, the environment variable ERROR PATTERN should also 




COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


be defined. ERFOR_PATTERN is aui editor search connand that 
locates the first occurrence of '#♦#' in the error file.) If 
no editor is specified, call vi(l). 

-K (keep) Keep the intermediate language (IL) file 
produced by the compiler front end. 

-L library_name (library) Operate in VftDS library 
library_name (the current working directory is the default). 

-lfile_ad>breviation (library search) Ihis is an option 
passed to the UNIX linker, ld(l) telling it to search the 
specified library file. (No space between the -1 and the 
file abbreviation.) 

For a description of the file abbreviations, see also 
Operating system documentation, ld(l) 

-M \init_name (main) Produce an executable program using 
the named unit as the main program. The unit must be either 
a parameterless procedure or a parameterless function 
returning an integer. The executedile program will be left in 
the file a.out unless overridden with the -o option. 

-M source_file (main) This option is like -M unit_name, except 
that the unit name is assumed to be the root 
name of the .a file (for foo.a the unit is foo. Only one .a file 
may be preceded by -M. 

-o executable file (output) This option is to be used in 
conjunction with the -M option. executable_file is the name 
of the executable rather than the default a.out. 


-0(0-9] (optimize) Invoke the code optimizer (0PTIM2). An 
optional digit (there is no space before the digit) limits 
the number of passes by the optimizer: 



no -0 option, make one pass 


-0 

no digit, optimize as far as possible 


-oo 

prevents optimization 


-01 

no hoisting 


-09 

full optimization 


The addition of the INFO directive, OPTIM3:INFO:TRUE, to the 
ada.lib will cause the con?)iler to use a new optimizer (0PTIM3) 
that generates faster code. 

The default level of optimization for 0PTIM3 
that optimization levels for 0PTIM3 are more 

is 04. Note 
them singly 


additional iterations: 


B-3 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-0 full optimization (same as 0PTIM2 ada -09) 

-OO prevents optimization 

-01 no hoisting (same as 0PTIM2 ada -Ol) 

-02 no hoisting but more passes 

-03 no hoisting but even more passes 

-04 hoisting from loops 

-05 hoisting from loops but more passes 

-06 hoisting from loops with maximum passes 

-07 hoisting from loops and bramches 

-08 hoisting from loops and branches, more passes 

-09 hoisting from loops and branches, maximum passes 

Hoisting from branches (and cases alternatives) can be slow 
and does not always provide significant performance gains so 
it can be suppressed. 

For information on linker INFO directives see USER'S GUIDE, 
INFO Directive Names on page 

a.info on page , and for more information about 
optimization, see USER'S GUIDE, Conpiler Optimizations on 
page . 

-R VADS_library (recompile instemtiation) Force eunalysis 
of all generic insteuitiations, causing reinsteuitiation of 
any that are out of date. 

-S (suppress) i^ly pragma SUPPRESS to the entire 
conqpilation for all suppressible checks. 

-sh (show) Display the name of the tool executable but do 
not execute it. 

-T (timing) Print timing information for the compilation. 

-V (verbose) Print conpiler version number, date auid time 
of conpilation, name of file conpiled, ccxnmemd input line, 
total conpilation time, and error stannary line. Storage 
usage information about the object file is provided. With 
0PTIM3 the output format of compression (the size of 
optimized instructions) is as a percentage of input 
(unoptimized instructions). 


B-4 




CQMPIIATICW SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-w (warnings) Suppress warning diagnostics. 

See also a.das on page ; a.db on page ; a.error on page ; 
a.Id on page ; a.inklib on page ; and Operating System 
reference documentation for the ld(l) utility. 

Diagnostics 

Ihe diagnostics produced by the VADS compiler are intended 
to be self-explanatory. Most refer to the RM. Each RM reference 
includes a section number and optionally, a paragraph number 
enclosed in parentheses. 


LINKER OPTIOaS 

The linker options of this Ada inplementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to linker documentation and not 
to this report. 


a.Id 


prelinker 

Syntax 

a.Id [options] unit_name (ld_options] 

Options 

-DX (debug) Debug memory overflow (use in cases v^ere 
linking a large number of units causes the error message 
local symbol overflow" to occur). 

-E unit name (elaborate) Elaborate unit_naine as early in 
the elaEoration order as possible. 

-F (files) Print a list of dependent files in order emd 
suppress linking. 

-L library_name (library) Operate in VT^S library 
library_name (the current working directory is the default). 

-o executable file (output) Use the specified file neune as 
the name of tEe output rather than the default, a.out. 

-sh (show) Display the name of the tool executable but do 
not execute it. 

-U (units) Print a list of dependent units in order and 








COMPIIATIW SYSTEM OPTIC»IS 


suppress linking. 

-V (verbose) Print the linker coitanand before executing it. 

-V (verify) Print the linker conimand but suppress 
execution. 

Description 

a.Id collects the object files needed to make \ 3 nit_name a 
main program and calls theUNIX 
linker ld(l) to link together all Ada and other language 
objects required to produce an executable image in a.out. 
unit_name is the main program and must name a non-generic 
subprogram. If unit_name is a function, it must return a 
value of the type STANDARD.INTEGE31. This integer result 
will be passed back to the UNIX shell as the status code 
of the execution. The utility uses the net files produced 
by the Ada coitpiler to check dependency information, a.Id 
produces an exception mapping tcdale and a unit eleJxjration 
te±)le and passes this information to the linker. 

a.Id reads instructions for generating executedDles from the 
ada.lib file in the VADS libraries on the search list. 
Besides information generated by the compiler, these 
directives also include WITHn directives that allow the 
automatic linking of object modules compiled from other 
languages or Ada object modules not named in context clauses 
in the Ada source. Any number of WITHn directives may be 
placed into a library, but they must be numbered 
contiguously beginning at WITHl. The directives are recorded 
in the library's ada.lib file emd have the following form. 

WITHl:LINK;object_file: 

WITH2:LINK;archive_file: 

WITHn directives may be placed in the local Ada libraries or 
in any VADS library on the search list. 

A WITHn directive in a local VADS library or earlier on the 
library search list will hide the same numbered WITHn 
directive in a library later in the library search list. 

Use the tool a.info to change or report library directives 
in the current library. 

All arguments after unit_name are passed on to the linker. 
These may be options for it, archive libraries, library 
edsbreviations, or object files. 

VADS_location/bin/a.ld is a wrapper program that executes 
the correct executable based upon directives visible in the 


B-6 






COMPILATICW SYSTEM OPTIONS 


ada.lib file. This permits multiple VADS compilers to exist 
on the same host. The -sh option prints the name of the 
actual executedDle file. 

Diagnostics 

Self-explanatory diagnostics are produced for missing files, 
etc. Additional messages are produced by the UNIX linker Id.

end STANDARD; 


C-1 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


APPENDIX F. Iiraplementation-Dependent Characteristics 


1. Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 

1.1. INLINE_CWLY Pragma 

The iNLINEjC^ILY pragma, vAien used in the same way as pragma 
INLINE, indicates to the conpiler that the subprogram must 
always be inlined. This pragma also suppresses the genera¬ 
tion of a callable version of the routine vrtiich saves code 
space. If a user erroneously makes aui INLINE_(»ILY subpro¬ 
gram recursive a warning message will be emitted and an 
PROGRAM_ERROR will be raised at run time. 

1.2. BUILT_IN Pragma 

The BUILT IN pragma is used in the implementation of some 
predefined Ada packages, but provides no user access. It is 
used only to implement code bodies for vAiich no actual Ada 
body can be provided, for exanple the MACHINE_C0DE package. 

1.3. SHARE_CODE Pragma 

The SHARE_CODE pragma takes the name of a generic instantia¬ 
tion or a generic unit as the first argument and one of the 
identifiers TRUE or FALSE as the second argument. This 
pragma is only allowed immediately at the place of a 
declarative item in a declarative part or package specifica¬ 
tion, or after a library unit in a compilation, but before 
any subsequent conpilation unit. 

When the first argument is a generic unit the pragma applies 
to all instcuitiations of that generic. When the first argu¬ 
ment is the name of a generic instcuitiation the pragma 
applies only to the specified instantiation, or overloaded 
instantiations. 

If the second argument is TRUE the compiler will try to 
share code generated for a generic instantiation with code 
generated for other instantiations of the same generic. 
When the second argument is FALSE each instantiation will 
get a unique copy of the generated code. The extent to 
which code is shared between instantiations depends on this 
pragma and the kind of generic formal parameters declared 
for the generic unit. 

The name pragma SHARE_BODY is also recognized by the imple- 


C-2 



APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


mpntation and has the same effect as SHARE_CODE. It is 
included for compataUaility with earlier versions of VADS. 

1.4. NO_IMAGE Pragma 

The pragma suppresses the generation of the image array used 
for the IMAGE attribute of enumeration types. This elim¬ 
inates the overhead required to store the array in the exe¬ 
cutable image. An attenpt to use the IMM5E attribute on a 
type whose image array has been suppressed will result in a 
conpilation warning and PROGRAM_ERROR raised at run time. 

1.5. EXTERNAL_NAME Pragma 

The EXTERNAL NAME pragma takes the name of a subprogram or 
variable defined in Ada eind allows the user to specify a 
different external name that may be used to reference the 
entity from other languages. The pragma is allowed at the 
place of a declarative item in a package specification and 
must apply to an object declared earlier in the same package 
specification. 

1.6. INTERFACE_NAME Pragma 

The 1NTERFACE_NAME pragma takes the name of a a varieible or 
subprogram defined in another language and allows it to be 
referenced directly in Ada. The pragma will replace all 
occurrences of the varieible or subprogram name with an 
external reference to the second, link_arguraent. The pragma 
is allowed at the place of a declarative item in a package 
specification and must apply to an object or subprogram 
declared earlier in the same package specification. The 
object must be declared as a scalar or an access type. The 
object cannot be any of the following: 
a loop variable, 
a constant, 

an initialized variable, 
an array, or 
a record. 

1.7. IMPLICIT_CODE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies that implicit code generated by the 
compiler be allowed or disallowed. A warning is issued if 
OFF is used and any implicit code needs to generated. 
The default is ON. 


1.8. OPTIMIZE_CODE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers CW or OFF as the single argu- 


C-3 






APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


merit. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies whether the code should be optint- 
ized by the conpiler. The default is ON. When OFF is 
specified, the compiler will generate the code as specified. 

2. Implementation of Predefined Pragmas 

2.1. CC»ITROLLED 

This pragma is recognized by the inplementation but has no 
effect. 

2.2. ELABORATE 

This pragma is inpleroented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.3. INLINE 

This pragma is inplemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.4. INTERFACE 

This pragma supports calls to 'C' and FORTRAN functions. The 
Ada subprograms cam be either functions or procedures. The 
types of parameters and the result type for functions must 
be scalar, access or the predefined type ADDRESS in SYSTEM. 
All parameters must have mode IN. Record and array objects 
can be passed by reference using the ADDRESS attribute. 

2.5. LIST 

This pragma is iin)lemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.6. MEMORY_SIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the inplementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be reconciled. 

2.7. NC»J_REENTRANT 

This pragma takes one argument which can be the name of 
either a library subprogram or a subprogram declared immedi¬ 
ately within a library package spec or body. It indicates 
to the conciler that the subprogram will not be called 
recursively allowing the compiler to perform specific optim¬ 
izations. The pragma can be applied to a subprogram or a 
set of overloaded subprograsm within a package spec or pack¬ 
age body. 


C-4 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


2.8. NOT_ELABORATED 

This pragma can only appear in a library package specifica¬ 
tion. It indicates that the package will not be elaborated 
because it is either part of the RTS, a configuration pack¬ 
age or an Ada pa age that is referenced from a language 
other than Ada. The presence of this pragma suppresses the 
generation of elaboration code and issues warnings if ela¬ 
boration code is required. 

2.9. OPTIMIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the inf^lementation but has no 
effect. 

2.10. PACK 

This pragma will cause the compiler to choose a non-aligned 
representation for conposite types. It will not causes 
objects to be packed at the bit level. 

2.11. PAGE 

This pragma is in^lemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.12. PASSIVE 

The pragma has three forms : 

PRAGMA PASSIVE; 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(SEMAPHORE); 

PRAOIA PASSIVE(INTERRUPT, <number>); 


This pragma Pragma passive can be applied to a task or task 
type declared immediately within a library package spec or 
body. The pragma directs the conpiler to optimize certain 
tasking operations. It is possible that the statements in a 
task body will prevent the intended optimization, in these 
cases a warning will be generated at conpile time and will 
raise TASKING_ERROR at runtime. 

2.13. PRIORITY 

This pragma is inplemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.14. SHARED 

This pragma is recognized fay the implementation but has no 
effect. 


C-5 





‘appendix F of the Ada STANDARD 


2.15. STORAGE_UNIT 

This pragma is recognized by the inpleroentation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be reconciled. 

2.16. SUPPRESS 

This pragma is inclemented as described, except that

supresseH. 

2.17. SYSTEM_NAME 

This pragma is recognized by the inpleroentation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

3. Implementation-Dependent Attributes 

3.1. P'REF 

For a prefix that denotes an object, a program unit, a 
lc±)el, or an entry; 

This attribute denotes the effective address of the first of 
the storage units allocated to P. For a subprogram, pack¬ 
age, task unit, or label, it refers to the address of the 
machine code associated with the corresponding body or 
statement. For an entry for vhich an address clause has 
been given, it refers to the corresponding hardware inter¬ 
rupt. The attribute is of the type OPERAND defined in the 
package MACHINE_C0DE. The attribute is only allowed within 
a machine code procedure. 

See section F.4.8 for more information on the use of this 
attribute. 

(For a package, task unit, or entry, the 'REF attribute is 
not supported.) 


3.2. T'TASKID 

For a task object or a value T, T'TASK_ID yields the unique 
task id associated with a task. The value of this attribute 
is of the type ADDRESS in the package SYSTEM.

5. Restrictions On Representation Clauses 
5.1. Pragma PACK 

In the absence of pragma PACK record conponents are padded 
so as to provide for efficient access by the target 
hardware, pragma PACK applied to a record eliminate the pad- 


C-8 








APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


ding where possible. Pragma PAOC has no other effect on the 
storage allocated for record components a record representa¬ 
tion is required. 

5.2. Size Clauses 

For scalar types a representation clause will pack to the 
number of bits required to represent the range of the sub- 
type. A size clause applied to a record type will not cause 
packing of components; an explicit record representation 
clause must be given to specify the packing of the cooh- 
ponents. A size clause applied to a record type will cause 
packing of components only v^en the con^nent type is a 
discrete type. An error will be issued if there is insuffi¬ 
cient space allocated. The SIZE attribute is not supported 
for task, access, or floating point types. 


5.3. Address Clauses 

Address clauses are only supported for variables. Since 
default initialization of a variable requires evaluation of 
the variable address eledxtration ordering requirements 
prohibit inititalization of a variables which have address 
clauses. Ihe specified address indicates the physical 
address associated with the variable. 

5.4. Interrupts 

Interupt entries are not supported. 

5.5. Representation Attributes 

The AEMDRESS attribute is not supported for the following 
entities: 

Packages 

Tasks 

Labels 

Entries 


5.6. Machine Code Insertions 
Machine code insertions are supported. 

The general definition of the package MACHINE_CC»E provides 
an assembly language interface for the target machine. It 
provides the necessary record type(s) needed in the code 
statement, an enumeration type of all the opcode mneumonics, 
a set of register definitions, and a set of addressing mode 
factions. 


C-9 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 




Itie general synteuc of a machine code statement is as fol¬ 
lows: 


CODE_n'( opcode, operand {, operand} ); 

vdiere n indicates the nxanber of operamds in the aggregate. 

A special case arises for a vari2^1e ntunber of opereunds. 
The operands are listed within a siabaggregate. The format 
is as follows: 

CODE_N'( opcode, (operand {, operand}) ); 

For those opcodes that require no operauids, named notation 
must be used {cf. RM 4.3(4)). 

CODE_0'( op «> opcode ); 

The opcode must be an envuneration literal (i.e. it cannot be 
eui object, attribute, or a rename). 

An operand can only be an entity defined in MACHINE_CODE or 
the 'REF attribute. 

The arguments to any of the functions defined in 
MAC3IINE_C0DE must be static expressions, string literals, or 
the functions defined in MAailNE_CODE. The 'REF attribute 
may not be used as an argument in any of these fxjnctions. 

Inline expansion of machine code procedures is supported. 

6. Conventions for Implementation-generated Names 
There are no iiqplementation-generated names. 

7. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clauses 

Address expressions in an address clause are interpreted as 
physical addresses. 

8. Restrictions on Unchecked Conversions 
None. 

9. Restrictions on Unchecked Deallocations 
None. 


10. Inf)lementation Characteristics of I/O Packages 

Instantiations of DIRECT_IO use the value MAX_REC_SIZE as 
the record size (expressed in STORAGE_lWITS) when the size 
of ELEMENr_TYPE exceeds that value. For example for uncon- 


C-10 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


> 




Strained arrays such as string v^ere ELEMENT_TYPE'SIZE is 
very large, MAX_REC_SIZE is used instead. MAX_RECORD_SIZE 
is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a program before 
instantiating DIRECT_IO to provide an upper limit on the 
record size. In any case the maximum size supported is 1024 
X 1024 X STORAGE_UNIT bits. DIRECT_IO will raise USE_ERROR 
if MAX_REC_SIZE exceeds this absolute limit. 

Instantiations of SEQUENTIAL_I0 use the value MAX_REC_SIZE 
as the record size (expressed in STORAGE_UNITS) when the 
size of ELEMENT_TyPE exceeds that value. For example for 
unconstrained arrays such as string where ELEMENT_TYPE'SIZE 
is very large, MAX REC_S1ZE is used instead. 
MAX_RECORD SIZE is define3 in SYSTEM and can be changed by a 
program before instantiating INTEGER_IO to provide an upper 
limit on the record size. SEQUENTIAL_IO imposes no limit on 
MAX_REC_SIZE. 

11. Implementation Lim'ts 

The following liFi^s are actually enforced by the implemen¬ 
tation. It is not intended to inply that resources up to or 
even near thei.a limits are available to every program. 

11.1. Line Length 

The implementation supports a maximum line length of 500 
characters including the end of line character. 

11.2. Record and Array Sizes 

The rwocimum size of a statically sized array type is 
4,000,000 X STORAGE_UNITS. The maucimum size of a statically 
sized record type is 4,000,000 x STORAGEJUNITS. A record 
type or array type declaration that exceeds these limits 
will generate a warning message. 

11.3. Default Stack Size for Tasks 

In the absence of an explicit ST0RAGE_S1ZE length specifica¬ 
tion every task except the main program is allocated a fixed 
size stack of 10,240 STORAGEJUNITS. This is the value 
returned by T'STOR^E_SIZE for a task type T. 

11.4. Default Collection Size 

In the absence of an explicit ST0RAGE_SIZE length attribute 
the default collection size for an access type is 100 times 
the size of the designated type. This is the value returned 
by T'STORAGE_SIZE for an access type T. 

11.5. Limit on Declared Objects 


C-11 








V APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


There is an absolute limit of 6,000,000 x STORAGE_UNITS for 
objects declared statically within a conpilation unit. If 
this value is exceeded the conpiler will terminate the com¬ 
pilation of the unit with a FATAL error message.
