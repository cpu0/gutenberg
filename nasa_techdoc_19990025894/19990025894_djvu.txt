A. Progress Under NASA Grants NAGW 1404 and NAG5-4316 

Using theoretical quantum chemical calculations, I have successfully described the dissociative 
recombination (DR) of 2 leading to the excited 'S state of atomic oxygen, the upper state of the 
well known green line emission. The process is described by 

0* 2 + e - -> O('S) + O('D) (1) 

where e" is an electron and the product oxygen atoms are both excited. This process is important 
in the atmospheres of Venus, Mars and Earth. I have shown in prior calculations [Guberman, 
1987, 1988] that only one repulsive potential curve of 2 , f '£„, can generate O('S) from DR of 
the lowest vibrational levels of 2 . However, in the prior results, the calculated quantum yield 
( i.e. the number of O('S) atoms produced for every two product atoms ) from the 2 v=0 level 
was smaller than the laboratory and atmospheric measurements by more than an order of 
magnitude. Including only direct recombination, the calculated quantum yield for O('S) is only 
0.0016 [Guberman, 1987, 1988]. In a calculation [Guberman and Giusti-Suzor, 1991] that 
accounts for both direct and indirect recombination, the quantum yield is 0.0012. The range of 
experimentally determined quantum yields is between 0.01 and 0.23. Because of this large 
difference between the theoretical and experimental quantum yields, it was thought for some time 
that the ionospheric and laboratory 2 must be vibrationally excited since for excited levels, 
theory gave quantum yields that are similar to experimental yields. It was also suggested that 
some other process was generating O('S) but none could be identified [Bates, 1992]. 

Under current NASA support, I have found that reaction (1) proceeds via an unusual 
mechanism. The f 'E* state does not cross the ion between the turning points of the v=0 level of 
the 2 ground state. The lack of a favorable crossing leads to a very small calculated DR rate 
coefficient. However, this mechanism assumes that initial electron capture must occur into the 
repulsive state that leads to O('S). Instead, I have found that initial electron capture occurs mostly 
into the B 3 Z U state which crosses the ion between the turning points of the v=0 ion level and has 
a large DR rate coefficient. The B state dissociates to O('D) and 0( 3 P). After capture, some of 
the flux is transferred to the f'X„ state via symmetry mixed intermediate Rydberg states. The 
neutral Rydberg states are a mixture of 'E„ and 3 £„ symmetry. The mixing is due to spin-orbit 

1 



coupling which splits the ground state of 2 into two states separated by only 200cm" 1 . Two 
mixed symmetry Rydberg series are involved. The lower Rydberg series limit is at the v=0 level 
of the X 2 n i/2g state and the other limit is 0.025eV higher at the v=0 level of the X 2 n 3/2g state. 

In order to do these calculation, the multichannel quantum defect computer code that is used 
for the calculation of DR cross sections and rates was extensively revised to handle the spin-orbit 
coupling. The calculations also make use of an earlier revision to handle ion core excited states 
since the upper spin-orbit level is a core excited state. The resulting cross section is shown in 
Figure 1. The region between O.OOleV and 0.025eV shows much resonance structure. The first 
resonance, shown by the dip near 0.002eV is an 
n=24, v=0 Rydberg state having as its core the 
2 n 3/2g ion. This series of v=0 levels has its limit 
at 0.025eV at the v=0 level of 2 n 3/2g . These 
resonances appear as dips because the '£„ 
dissociative state is only weakly connected to 
these levels due to a poor Franck-Condon factor. 
The peak near 0.03eV is due to a Rydberg 
n=9,v=l state with the lower 2 n i/2g core. The 
next peak near 0.06eV is due to the n=9, v=l 
Rydberg level with the 2 n 3/2g core. The peak at 
0.07eV is due to n=10, v=l with the 2 n i/2g core. 
These three resonances all have peaks because 
both f 'E* and B 3 E U have a high Franck-Condon 
factor with these levels leading to an increase in 
the O('S) quantum yield at the resonance 
positions. The calculated rate constant at 300K electron temperature for DR of the X 2 n i/2g v=0 
level is 0.39(+0.31 -0.19) x 10 s cmVsec. For the upper v=0, X 2 n 3/2g level the DR rate constant 
is 0.16(+0.16 -0.13) x 10" 8 cm 3 /sec also at 300K electron temperature. The calculated quantum 
yield from the v=0, X 2 n i/2g level is 0.020(+0.015 -0.010) at 300K electron temperature and falls 
within the range of quantum yields deduced from laboratory and rocket experiments.
