x-archive-meta-description: Using theoretical quantum chemical calculations, I have successfully described the dissociative recombination (DR) of O2() leading to the excited S-1 state of atomic oxygen, the upper state of the well known green line emission. The process is described by O2()  e(-) yields O(S-1))  O(D-1) (1) where e(-) is an electron and the product oxygen atoms are both excited. This process is important in the atmospheres of Venus, Mars and Earth. I have shown in prior calculations that only one repulsive potential curve of O2, f(sup l)Sigma(sub u, sup ) can generate O(S-1) from DR of the lowest vibrational levels of O2(). However, in the prior results, the calculated quantum yield (i.e. the number of O(S-1) atoms produced for every two product atoms) from the O2() v = 0 level was smaller than the laboratory and atmospheric measurements by more than an order of magnitude. Including only direct recombination, the calculated quantum yield for O(S-1) is only 0.0016. In a calculation that accounts for both direct and indirect recombination, the quantum yield is 0.0012. The range of experimentally determined quantum yields is between 0.01 and 0.23. Because of this large difference between the theoretical and experimental quantum yields, it was thought for some time that the ionospheric and laboratory O2() must be vibrationally excited since for excited levels, theory gave quantum yields that are similar to experimental yields. It was also suggested that some other process was generating O(S-1) but none could be identified. Under current NASA support, I have found that reaction (1) proceeds via an unusual mechanism. The f(sup 1)Sigma(sub u, sup,) state does not cross the ion between the turning points of the v = 0 level of the O2() ground state. The lack of a favorable crossing leads to a very small calculated DR rate coefficient. However, this mechanism assumes that initial electron capture must occur into the repulsive state that leads to )(S-1). Instead, I have found that initial electron capture occurs mostly into the B(sup 3)Sigma(sup u, sub -) state which crosses the ion between the turning points of the v = 0 ion level and has a large DR rate coefficient. The B state dissociates to O(D-1) and )(P-3). After capture, some of the flux is transferred to the f(sup 1)Sigma(sup u, sub ) state via symmetry mixed intermediate Rydberg states. The neutral Rydberg states are a mixture of Sigma(sub u, sup )-1 and Sigma(sub u, sup -)-3 symmetry.
