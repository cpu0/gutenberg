13. Abstract 


This report presents the results of the Feasibility Study ^S) performed for the 
Ammuni tion Demolition Activity (ADA) Area of Umatilla Depot Activity (UMDA) near 
Hermiston, Oregon. 

From 1945 to the present, ordnance and other solid wastes generated at UMDA were 
burned, detonated, or otherwise disposed of (by dumping or burial) at the ADA. Twenty 
sites at which these activities were or are still being conducted, have been identified. As 
a result of these activities, soil at the ADA is contaminated with a variety of chemical 
compounds (including explosives and pesticides) and metals. In addition, there are 
unknown quantities of unexploded ordnance (UXO) on the surface and in the subsurface 
of the ADA. 

This Feasibility Study addresses the contamination of soil at the ADA; develops 
objectives for soil remediation; and identifies, develops, screens, and evaluates soil 
remedial action alternatives. 

Basic components of the remedial alternatives subjected to a detailed evaluation for 
contaipinated soil at the ADA include: No Action; Institutional Control (with and 
without UXO clearance); Containment; On-Site Stabilization/Solidification; On-Site 
Incineration and Stabilization/Solidification; and Off-Site Treatment and Disposal. 

An evaluation of remedial alternatives was conducted addressing the response of the 
alternatives to specific criteria including: Protection of human health and the 
environment; compliance with Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements 
(ARARs); Long-term effectiveness and permanence; reduction of toxicity, mobility, and 
volume through treatment; short-term effectiveness; implementability; and cost.

1.0 Introduction 


This report presents the results of the Feasibility Study (FS) performed for the 
Ammunition Demolition Activity (ADA) Area of Umatilla Depot Activity (UMDA) near 
Hermiston, Oregon. This report was prepared by Arthur D. Little, Inc., for the U.S. 
Army Environmental Center (USAEC), formerly the U.S. Army Toxic and Hazardous 
Materials Agency (USATHAMA), under Task Order No. 2, Contract No. DAAA15-91- 
D-0016. The FS has been conducted in accordance with the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as 
amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 and 
its governing regulations, the National Contingency Plan (NCP) 40 CFR Part 300. 

Eight operable units (OUs) have been identified at the UMDA site based on the results of 
the Preliminary Assessment (PA)i and the Remedial Investigation (RI)2: 

• Inactive Landfills 

• Active Landfill 

• Ground Water contamination from the explosives washout lagoons 

• Ammunition Demolition Activity Area (ADA) 

• Miscellaneous Sites 

• Explosives Washout Plant (Building 489) 

• Washout Lagoon Soils 

• Deactivation Furnace and surrounding soils 

This FS is focused on the evaluation of remedial alternatives for 20 sites at UMDA that 
are grouped together as the ADA Operable Unit (OU-4). The other seven UMDA OUs 
will be evaluated in separate FS reports. 


1.1 Purpose and Organization of Report 

1.1.1 Purpose 

UMDA is a U.S. Army ordnance depot located near Hermiston, Oregon. From 1945 to 
the present, ordnance and other solid wastes generated at UMDA were burned, 
detonated, or otherwise disposed of (by dumping or burial) at the ADA. Twenty sites at 
which these activities were or are still being conducted, have been identified. Each of the 
sites has been associated with a specific ordnance or solid waste disposal activity. 

The risks associated with future exposure to the contaminated soil of the ADA exceed the 
NCP guidelines and indicate that remediation is required. These risks are based on the 
release to the public of the ADA area upon closure of UMDA and the restriction of future 
use of the site for military training and practice operations. 

In addition to the chemical contamination of the soil at the ADA, the site is impacted by 
the presence of unexploded ordnance (UXO) as a result of the ordnance disposal 
operations that took place. UXO is a significant concern with respect to future use of the

1.0 Introduction 


ADA and, as such, factors into the analysis of remedial alternatives and the final selection 
of the remedial alternative to be pursued 

This FS addresses the contamination concerns at the ADA; develops objectives for soil 
remediation; and identifies, develops, screens, and evaluates soil remedial action 
alternatives. Remedial alternatives pertaining to ground water are not addressed in this 
FS (see Section 1.2.5.43, Ground Water at the ADA). However, overall risks for the 
ADA sites include those relating to exposure to ground water and preliminary remediation 
goals (PRGs) are identified accordingly. 

This FS follows the guidelines provided in the EPA’s Guidance for Conducting Remedial 
Investigations and Feasibility Studies Under CERCLA 3, including defining the 
contamination problems; formulating remedial action objectives for the soU; and 
developing, screening, and evaluating soil remedial action alternatives. The results of this 
evaluation will be used by the Army, in consultation with the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODE(3), to select 
and propose a preferred remedial action for the ADA. After the Proposed Plan is 
reviewed by the public, the Army and the EPA will formalize the soil remedial action 
decision in a Recoid of Decision (ROD) document with concurrence from ODEQ. A 
similar process will be followed for the seven other OUs. 

The NCP encourages the evaluation of innovative technologies where they might offer 
the “potential for comparable or superior treatment performance or implementability, 
fewer or lesser adverse impacts... or lower costs for similar... performance than 
demonstrated technologies” [40 CFR 300.430 (a)(l)(iii)(E)]. As a baseline for these 
technologies, the impact of taking no action at the site is also presented. Other potentially 
applicable remedial technologies are discussed in the technology evaluation and screening 
sections. 

The FS is also intended to satisfy the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). The FS evaluated both the short-term and 
long-term impacts of several alternatives, including no action. In addition, a NEPA-type 
public review will take place after completion of the FS and Proposed Plan and prior to 
issuance of the ROD. 

1.1.2 Organization 

As the first step in the FS development process, existing data on UMDA and the ADA 
were compiled, summarized, and interpreted. These data are presented in Section 1.2, 
Background Information. This background serves to establish an historical and physical 
perspective of the ADA as well as to provide an understanding of the nature and extent of 
the contamination. In addition, these data were used as the basis for the conduct of the 
Human Health Baseline Risk Assessment (RA)^ which is summarized in Section 1.2. 

Based on the interpretations and analyses of site-related data, remedial action objectives 
were defined and possible general response actions and associated remedial technologies 


JM.670e2-45.OU4.Flnal FS.11«3 1-2 




1.0 Introduction 


were identified The response actions and the remedial technologies were screened; first 
for general feasibility, and then in more detail on the basis of effectiveness, 
implementability, and cost. The remedial objectives and the results of the screening 
procedure are presented in Section 2.4, Identification and Screening of Technology 
Types and Process Options. 

The results of the identification and screening analysis were used to develop remedial 
alternatives to be carried through detailed analyses. These alternatives consist of 
individual technologies and process options as well as appropriate combinations of 
technologies and process options. These alternatives and the rationale used to develop 
them are present^ in Section 3.0, Development of Alternatives, 

In Section 4.0, Detailed Analysis of Alternatives, the evaluation of each of the selected 
remedial alternatives is described. This evaluation addresses criteria specified in the NCP 
including: ovanll protection of human health and the environment; compliance with 
Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements (ARARs), long-term effectiveness; 
reduction of toxicity, mobility, or volume; short-term effectiveness; implementability; and 
cost. Following the summary of the response of each alternative to these criteria, all of 
the alternatives are compared to identify strengths and weaknesses to allow for an 
informed decision to be made with respect to the selection of the most appropriate 
alternative to be pursued. 


1.2 Background Information 

This section describes the background and physical setting of UMDA and the ADA, 
including the nature and extent of the existing contamination at the ADA sites. The 
primary references used in developing this background information were the installation¬ 
wide Preliminary Assessment^ and the RI.2 Also included in this section is a summary 
of the Human Health Baseline Risk Assessment.'* 

1.2.1 Site Location and History 

UMDA is located in northeastern Oregon on the border of Umatilla and Morrow counties, 
near the city of Hermiston, as shown in Figure 1-1. It was established by the Army in 
1941 as an ordnance facility for storing conventional munitions. Subsequently, the 
function of the facility was extended to include am m unition demolition (1945), 
renovation (1947), and maintenance (1955). In 1962, the Army began to store chemical- 
filled munitions and containerized chemical agents at the facility. UMDA continues to 
operate today as a munitions storage facility, and will be conducting activities associated 
with the Army’s Qiemical Demilitarization and Installation Restoration Programs. 

The facility occupies a roughly rectangular area of 19,728 acres; 17,054 acres are owned 
by the U.S. Government, while the remainder are controlled by restrictive easements that 
provide a safety zone around the facility2. Although ownership of the latter is private, the

1.0 Introduction 


easements grant perpetual rights to the U.S. Government, including the right to prohibit 
human habitation and to remove buildings. The owners retain the right to farm the lands 
and to graze livestock. 

The UMDA facility is currently one of sevaal installations scheduled for realignment 
under the Department of Defense (DoD) Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 
program. Under this program, the Army will eventually vacate the installation and 
relinquish ownership to another governmental agency or private interests. Although 
future use of the installation in general has not been determined, light industrial or 
residential use is a possibility. At the ADA a third future use alternative that has been 
proposed is retention of the site under government control for use in military training. 

The ADA is located in the western portion of UMDA. Twenty sites have been identified 
as areas of historical or current activities at the ADA. The location of these sites are 
indicated in Figure 1-2. 

Activities at the ADA sites consisted of operations to bum, detonate, and otherwise 
dispose of (by dumping or burial) ordnance and other solid wastes. The types of 
activities involved a range of chemical compounds and metals, including: 

• Explosives contained in ordnance being burned, detonated, or disposed of (2,4,6- 
trinitrotoluene [TNT]; 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene [TNB]; 2,4- and 2,6-dinitrotoluene 
[DNT]; nitrobenzene; hexahydro-l,3,5-trinitro-l,3,5-triazine [RDX]; octahydro- 
l,3,5,7-tetranitro-l,3,5,7-tetrazocine [HMX]; and 2,4,6-tetranitro-N-methylaniline 
[tetiyl]) 

• Metals (e.g., lead, chromium, antimony, cadmium, copper, mercury, and nickel) 
contained in ordnance and munition casings being burned, detonated, or disposed of 

• Pesticides (e.g., DDT, DDE, and dieldrin) applied or disposed of 

1.2.2 Site Description 

1.2^.1 Regional and Installation Setting 

1.22.1.1 Topography and Surficial Geology. The portion of Oregon within an 
approximate 50-mile radius of UMDA includes parts of two geomorphic regions:5 the 
Deschutes-Umatilla Plateau and the Blue Mountains (Figure 1-3). Both of these regions 
lie at least partly within the Umatilla River Basin. 

The Deschutes-Umatilla Plateau has relatively little relief. It gradually rises southward 
from elevations near 260 feet above mean sea level at the Columbia River to 
approximately 800 feet at the foot of the Blue Mountains. Near-surface deposits 


JM.67062^.OU4i^inal FS.11/93 1 '5 



































1.0 introduction 


underlying the Plateau consist primarily of Miocene basalt flows, basalt debris and silts 
deposited as alluvial fans. Quaternary silts and clays, and Quaternary alluvial gravel and 
sand deposited by catastrophic floocUng of the Columbia River 5 

The edge of the Blue Mountains lies approximately 40 miles south and southeast of 
UMDA. The Blue Mountains reach elevations ranging from 3,500 to 6,000 feet. The 
mountains are considerably dissected by streams, which have eroded many steep-walled 
canyons.6 Near-surface deposits are primarily basalt and rhyolitic tuffs, with smaller 
areas of metanoorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks of probable Triassic age, and 
diorite and other intrusive rocks of provable Cretaceous age. 

The topography of the UMDA site, illustrated in Figure 1-4, can be naturally divided into 
three areas: Coyote Coulee; sloping lands east of the coulee; and rolUng hiUs west of the 
coulee. 

Coyote Coulee is a linear depression, about 0.25 mile wide, that trends north-northeast to 
south-southwest across UMDA. About one-third of UMDA lies east of Coyote Coulee. 
The east side of the coulee is a steep escarpment about 50 feet high. Although the land 
rises westward from the bottom of the coulee, the top of the escarpment is at a higher 
elevation than any nearby land west of the escarpment along most of the length of the 
coulee. The coulee is thus asymmetrical, unlike an erosional canyon where the elevation 
of the top of both canyon walls is generally the same. The top of the escarpment is near 
650 feet in the north half of UMDA, but slopes southward to 600 feet near the southern 
boundary. The escarpment vanishes quite abruptly at the southern boundary. 

East of Coyote Coulee, the surface slopes smoothly to the southeast, away from the 
escarpment, at a slope of approximately 50 feet per mile (ft/mi). The principal exceptions 
are a low hill near the southeast comer of UMDA, and a nearly level area around the 
administration area. West of Coyote Coulee, the surface consists largely of rolling hills. 
The highest hill (677-foot elevation) is near the northern boundary, just west of Coyote 
Coulee. A broad area of high ground extends to the southwest from this hill; from the 
high ground, the surface slopes, with many irregularities to the northwest and south. 

The northern half of the area west of Coyote Coulee has many linear hills and valleys, 
trending east-northeast to west-southwest, 10 to 20 feet high and up to 0.5 mile in length. 
These features may be large ripples associated with catastrophic flooding that occurred 
during drainage of Glacial Lake Missoula. 

No natural streams occur within UMDA because of highly permeable soil. Drainage 
patterns are very poorly developed because of highly permeable soil, low precipitation 
and the recent formation of the landscape. No direct information on storm water drainage 
is available for most of UMDA. Storm water runoff apparently does not travel far, 
except near the administration area, where runoff is collected by storm sewers. Many 
areas of closed drainage exist, particularly west of Coyote Coulee, with the largest about 
100 acres in size.

1.0 Introduction 


The ADA, consisting of approximately 1,750 acres in the northwestern comer of UMDA, 
is characterized by gently sloping to undulating topography. Elevations range from 400 
feet above mean sea level (MSL) to approximately 580 feet above MSL. 

Surface water mnoff generally follows topography and flows in a north-northwest 
direction. Drainage patterns are poorly developed. The southeastern comer of the ADA 
contains topographic depressions that may pond surface water for short periods of time. 

1.2.2.12 Stratigraphy. This section provides an overview of the stratigraphy of 
UMDA, discussing only the geological units investigated by drilling during the RI and 
previous on-post investigations as well as a recently completed post-RI investigations. 
The geology of the ADA conforms to the stratigraphy of the UMDA region. 

As described in the RI, three distinct geologic units underlie UMDA. These are, from 
oldest to youngest, unweathered to moderately weathered basalt flows and associated 
interbed deposits of the Columbia River basalts; “cemented basalt gravel/weathered 
basalt” (CBG/WB) and underlying gravel; and unconsolidated alluvium. However, 
recent investigations have indicated that the CBG/WB is actually the first basalt layer 
(Elephant Mountain Member) and represents a confining layer for the Rattlesnake Ridge 
Interbed as shown in Figure 1-5. 

Columbia River Basalt Flows and interbeds. The unweathered to moderately 
weathered basalt flows and associated interbed deposits are lithologically consistent (but 
not homogeneous), and laterally continuous across UMDA. In general, the tops of the 
basalt flows are moderately weathered, vesicular, and highly fractured. This zone grades 
downward to less weather^, massive basalt with fewer fractures. The base of the basalt 
flows is relatively sharp. Permeable interbed deposits lie between the massive basalt 
flows. The interbeds are much thinner than the basalts and are derived from weathered 
basalt gravel and possibly other sedimentary materials It is difficult to distinguish basalt- 
derived sedimentary interbeds from weathered flow tops on the basis of drill cuttings and 
video logs. 

A total of six individual basalt flows and associated interbeds have been penetrated by on¬ 
site wells. The first unit, informally referred to as the CBG/WB in the RI, has been 
determined to be the Elephant Mountain Member in the post-RI investigation. The 
Elephant Mountain Member is underlain by approximately 30 feet of basalt-derived 
unconsolidated sands and gravels, which is the Rattlesnake Ridge Interbed. These 
gravels appear to be distinct from the overlying flood-deposited alluvial gravels, which 
are gene^ly more rounded and contain a greater variety of source rock types. 

The second basalt flow is the thickest encountered, having an approximate thickness of 
170 feet This unit is interpreted to be the Pomona Member of the Saddle Mountain 
Basalt, based on stratigraphic characteristics and position in geologic sequence. This 
basalt flow is underlain by a thinner interbed horizon, which is interpreted to be the Selah

1.0 Introduction 


Interbed of the Ellensburg Formation. The four deep monitoring wells at Site 4 are 
completed in this interbed. Where fully penetrated on UMDA, the thickness of the Selah 
Interbed ranges from 20 to 70 feet. 

The Selah Interbed is underlain by another basalt flow and associated interbed, which are 
interpreted to be the Umatilla Member of the Saddle Mountain Basalt and the Mabton 
Interbed of the Ellensburg Formation, respectively. Only two water supply wells fully 
penetrate both the Umatilla Member and the Mabton Interbed; the thicknesses of these 
units in these two supply wells are approximately 50 and 25 feet 

These two water supply wells also penetrate at least three more thin basalt flows and 
associated interbeds below the Mabton Interbed. These thin basalt flows are interpreted 
to consist of the upper portion of the Frenchman Springs Member of the Wanapum 
Basalt. The Frenchman Springs Member is composed of several individual basalt flows 
separated by unnamed interbeds of the Ellensburg Formation. A total thickness of over 
230 feet of basalt flows belonging to the Frenchman Springs Member and associated 
unnamed interbeds is encountered in these two deep supply wells. 

The top of basalt (i.e., Pomona Member) occurs beneath UMDA at elevations ranging 
from 300 to 404 feet above MSL, based primarily on the borehole geophysical logs. The 
top of basalt is relatively flat across most of the installation. However, depths 
encountered in water supply wells (supply -6 & -7) are significantly deeper, indicating 
that the basalt dips northward in the vicinity of these wells. 

Alluvium. The alluvium consists of unconsolidated clay, silt, sand, and gravel 
containing cobbles up to at least 6 inches in diameter. These sediments probably represent 
catastrophic flood deposits or associated lower energy deposits in “quiet” waters. 
Lithologically, the unconsolidated detritus consists of quartzitic, felsic, and basaltic 
clasts. Throughout UMDA, sands or gravel are generally encountered at the surface. 
These deposits tend to become finer grained with depth, typically grading to sandy or 
clayey silts near the base of the alluvial section at its contact with the CBG/WB. Silt and 
clay beds up to tens of feet thick occur near the bottom of the alluvium in some parts of 
the installation (e.g.. Site 11). Coarser sands and gravels extend to a greater depth in the 
southern jwrtion of UMDA, with a layer of silty clays still present above the CBGAVB. 
The angular basalt gravel underlying the CBG/WB is not considered part of the alluvium, 
because it appears to be of a different age and origin. 

The thickness of the alluvial section penetrated in monitoring wells at UMDA ranges fiom 
approximately 42 feet in the northern part of the ADA area to 173 feet at Site 11. In 
addition, a thickness in excess of 2(X) feet was estimated in one of the water supply wells 
based on borehole geophysical logs. Most of this variation is due to differences in 
surface elevation; the elevation of the base of the alluvium varies less than that of the land 
surface.

1.0 Introduction 


12.2.1.3 Hydrogeology. Ground water occurs beneath UMDA in a number of 
distinct hydrogeologic settings, in a series of relatively deep confined basalt aquifers and 
in a highly productive permeable unconfined aquifer in the south of UMDA (extending 
off post). Geologically, the confined basalt aquifers consist primarily of the flow top 
interbeds between unweathered basalt flow interiors. The basalt flow interiors act as 
confining layers separating the interbed aquifers; however, structural discontinuities may 
be present within these flow interiors, providing local, vertical hydraulic connections 
between flow top aquifers. The unconfined aquifers consist of the saturated permeable 
alluvium and the saturated silty alluvium. The CBG/WB and the underlying gravels were 
originally thought to be part of this unconfined aquifer, however, that interpretation has 
been revised based on post-RI investigations and this layer is now considered to be the 
Rattlesnake Ridge Interbed. A representative cross section illustrating the major 
hydrogeologic features of Site 4 at UMDA is presented in Figure 1-5. 

Confined Basalt Aquifers. Ground water occurrence in the basalt is primarily within 
interbed units consisting of gravels and vesicular flow tops lying between basalt flows. 
Ground water is under confined conditions in these basalt aquifers. Based on borehole 
geophysical logs of water supply wells; supply-6 and supply-7 (i.e., the deepest on-post 
wells), as many as five confined aquifers could be present beneath UMDA between 
ground surface and a depth of 700 feet. However, the four deep basalt monitoring wells 
at Site 4 and approximately half of the water supply wells penetrate only the uppermost 
confined aquifer, which occurs in the Selah Interbed. This aquifer appears to be 
continuous beneath UMDA and to extend beyond the installation boundaries. The lateral 
extent of the underlying interbeds (confined aquifers) beneath UMDA is largely unknown 
due to the lack of deep wells that penetrate them. 

The interbeds are fairly productive aquifers, yielding 29.5 gpm for a period of eight 
hours at Site 4 and could have produced noore if the pump had been set deeper in the 
well. Large yields are obtainable from water siq)ply wells that penetrate one or more 
interbeds. Water supply well supply-1, for example, is capable of producing 1,000 gpm 
with 10 feet of drawdown9. Therefore, this well has a relatively high specific capacity of 
100 gpm/ft. Supply-5 and supply-7 have even higher specific capacities, 133 and 130 
gpm/ft, respectively, but are limited to smaller yields of 500 and 650 gpm by the 
capacities of their pumps. 

The unweathered basalt flows act as confining beds or leaky confining beds to retard 
vertical movement of water between the alluvium and basalt interbeds and, apparently, 
between different interbeds. Structural discontinuities may be present to provide local 
hydraulic connections between flow top aquifers. The vertical hydraulic conductivity of 
the basalt has not been measured at UMDA. However, permeability data for flow 
interiors are available for the Hanford site in Washingtonio. Reported horizontal 
permeabilities range from 1 x 10-7 to 1 x lO-io cm/sec. Field-derived vertical

1.0 Introduction 


permeability estimates are not available from Hanford. Based on simulations and 
statistical analyses of fracture data, DOE estimates that vertical permeabilities will be 
found to be within a factor of 10 of the horizontal conductivities. 

Unconfined Aquifer. As previously stated, the unconfined aquifer at UMDA consists 
of the sand and gravel of the alluvium and the silty clay of the alluvium. Areally, 
unconfined ground water occurs in two distinct hydrogeologic units beneath UMDA -- a 
permeable southern aquifer (termed the Ordnance Aquifer) and a less permeable northern 
aquifer. The behavior of ground water in these two aquifers is distinctly different. 

Ordnance Aquifer. The Ordnance Aquifer is located in the southern portion of UMDA 
and extends off post both to the south and to the east, corresponding to the “Ordnance 
Critical Ground water Area.” To the south of UMDA, the aquifer is tapped by numerous 
shallow wells that produce as much as 1,000 gallons per minute. Although regional 
water levels have declined since initiation of irrigation pumping in the 1950s and 1960s, 
the specific capacities of these irrigation wells are high. The use of the aquifer has been 
the subject of regional studies to evaluate the impact of withdrawals and artificial recharge 
activitiesio. Ground water levels in the Ordnance Aquifer have shown a net annual 
increase since the initiation of artificial recharge activities and reduced pumping in the 
1970s. 

Permeabilities of shallow wells in the southern part of UMDA (Ordnance Aquifer) are 
typically much greater than in wells to the north. Average permeability values from wells 
in the Ordnance Aquifer at Sites 4 and 12 are on the order of 2.1x lO-i cm/sec (585 
ft/day), with a maximum of 9.6x10-1 cm/sec (2,721 ft/day). Ground water gradients 
within the Ordnance Aquifer are very low (approximately 0.00015 ft/ft), further 
suggesting high aquifer permeabilities. An evaluation of hydrographs from the Ordnance 
Aquifer monitoring wells at Sites 4 and 12 shows a significant seasonal response to off- 
post pumping and artificial recharge activities to the south and east of UMDA. 

The saturated thickness of the Ordnance Aquifer is known only at Site 4, where four 
monitoring wells penetrate through to the Pomona Member. At this site, the saturated 
thickness of the entire unconfined aquifer ranges from approximately 100 to 127 feet. 
These estimates include the entire saturated thickness of the alluvium, the CBG/WB, the 
underlying gravel, and the upper 10 feet of the Pomona Member (which is fractured and 
moderately weathered). 

Ground water flow directions in the Ordnance Aquifer reverse seasonally in response to 
off-post pumping and recharge activities. During the summer and early fall, flow is 
toward the east and south as irrigation activities peak. During the winter and early 
spring, when irrigation activities are at a minimum, ground water flow is to the north and 
west. It is probable that prior to initiation of irrigation in the 1950s and 1960s the natural 
direction of flow in the Ordnance Aquifer was to the northwest toward the Columbia 
River and in the direct vicinity of the Umatilla River, possibly to the northeast. 

Currently, because water level declines have occurred in the aquifer, discharge is

1.0 Introduction 


probably exclusively to irrigation wells. There is likely insufficient head now to drive 
ground water either into the finer sediments of the norAem aquifer or over the top of the 
finer sediments within the more pomeable sediments (which are now dewatered and 
overlie the finer northern aquifer sediments). 

Northern Aquifer. The Northern Aquifer pinches out along an east-west transect 
slightly north of Site 4. Ground water gradients to the south of this contact are low and 
reverse seasonally in response to off-post stresses. Ground water gradients to the north 
of this contact are much greater (0.0085 ft/ft) and show no seasonal reversals. Flow is 
consistently to the northwest, where it probably discharges to the Columbia River. 
Hydrographs of selected wells indicate that the wells do not respond to off-post irrigation 
activities, suggesting that they are not in hydraulic contact with the Ordnance Aquifer. 
Northern aquifer permeabilities are typically much less than those to the south, with an 
average value of 9.5x10-3 cm/sec (27 ft/day) and a maximum value of 1.8x10-1 cm/sec 
(503 ft/day). 

The saturated thickness of the northern aquifer beneath UMDA, exclusive of the Elephant 
Mountain Member, is about 30 to 60 feet in most places. In the ADA area, the alluvium 
reaches a maximum saturated thickness of 70 feet; but it is zero in the north, where the 
elevation of the top of the Elephant Mountain Member is above the water table. 

1.2.2.1.4 Streams Within the Umatilla Basin. UMDA is located in the Umatilla Basin. 
The basin’s area is about 2,545 square milesi3. The principal stream is the Umatilla 
River, whose principal tributaries rise in the Blue Mountains and flow generally 
northward toward the Columbia River, which bounds the basin to the north. The 
Columbia is a major river in the area, with a mean discharge of 2(X),(XX) cubic feet per 
second (cfs)ii. Its level is stabilized at an approximate elevation of 265 feet by the John 
Day Dam. 

Mean discharge of the Umatilla River fiocated approximately 1 to 2 miles east of the 
installation boundary, depending on location) at Yoakum, 17 miles downstream from 
Pendleton, was 669 cfs from 1935 to 198512. A lower gage at Umatilla, near the mouth 
of the river, has a considerably smaller mean discharge, 490 cfs, because of irrigation 
diversion, and does not reflect natural streamflow. Butter Creek, the largest tributary in 
the area of the Umatilla Basin, has a mean discharge of 28 cfs at Pine City, 20 miles 
above its junction with the Umatilla River. 

Streamflow varies considerably through the year. At Yoakum, mean flow is 1,665 cfs 
during April, but decreases steadily to 91 cfs in October. During the irrigation season, 
most streamflow in the Umatilla River and Butter Creek is diverted for irrigation use. 

Much of the northern part of the basin near the Columbia River has no (or poorly 
developed) surface drrinage because of highly permeable soil. Surface runoff has 
occasionally been observed from Sand Hollow. This mnoff fills depressions about 2 
miles south of UMDA, from which the water infiltrates into the gravelsii.

1.0 Introduction 


1.2.2.1.5 Ground Water Use, Artificial Recharge, and Water Balance. An estimated 
ground water balance (an accounting of gains to and losses from the ground water 
system) has not been reported for the entire Umatilla Basin. However, Millerii provides 
information that makes possible an estimate of the ground water balance of the Ordnance 
Critical Ground Water Area (referred to below as the Ordnance Area), a 35-square-mile 
area that adjoins UMDA on the east and south. The Ordnance Area contains an unusually 
productive unconfined aquifer that has been tapped for irrigation. Additional information 
that supports an estimated natural recharge rate of approximately 0.5 inch per year (in/yr) 
is supplied by Bauer and Vaccaroi^. The water balance primarily reflects the alluvium, 
though some pumping occurs from basalt aquifers. The water balance is dominated by 
artificial effects, as discussed below. 

The water balance for the Ordnance Area is summarized in the following list, which 
reflects conditions fiom 1978 to 1984: 

• Recharge to ground water 

Precipitation^nfiltration 
Stream seepage 
Canal leakage 
Inflow from west 
Artificial recharge (mean) 

• Discharge from ground water 

Springs/seepage to Umatilla River 2,000 af/yr 

Ground water outflow Unknown 

Direct evapotranspiration Small

I, (X)0 acre-feet per year (af/yr) 
Unknown 

II, 000 af/yr 
2,000 af/yr 
5,400 af/yr 


Recharge to Ground Water. Ground water recharge from precipitation in the vicinity 
of UMDA is estimated to be approximately 0.5 in/yr or lessi4. In the area immediately to 
the southeast of UMDA, however, recharge rates of approximately 2 to 5 in/yr are 
estimated due to irrigation activities. 

Seepage from the Umatilla River probably occurs when its level is high, but the rate is 
unknown. Leakage fiom canals east of UMDA is fairly accurately measured at 11,000 
af/yr. Leakage fiom canals south of UMDA is probably much less because of less 
permeable soil.

1.0 Introduction 


An area of 29,780 irrigated acres west of the Ordnance area is irrigated by water from the 
Columbia River. In the past, excess irrigation water may have recharged ground water in 
this area at a fast enough rate to cause northeastward flow into UMDA from off post. 

An artificial recharge canal 1 mile south of UMDA is operated by the County Line Water 
Improvement District. It consists of 2.5 miles of unlined canal, 15 feet wide, that is 
supplied with water from the High Line Canal, which obtains water from Butter Creek. 
Recharge from the canal began in 1977, with recharge of 469 acre-feet of water. 

Between 1978 and 1984, annual recharge ranged from 3,149 to 6,763 af/yr, with a mean 
of 5,358 afryr. Ground water levels south of UMDA have increased approximately 12 
feet since 1977, and at least half of this increase is attributed to the artificial recharge 
canal^L 

Discharge from Ground Water. Springs occur along the Umatilla River near the 
northeast comer of the Ordnance Area. Their discharge, though estimated, increases 
markedly during the irrigation season because of leakage from nearby canals. 

Ground water flows out of the Ordnance Area in the subsurface, but information on 
gradients and flow direction is too sparse to estimate its flow rate. 

Evapotranspiration directly by plants whose roots reach the saturated zone is probably 
slight, because in most parts of the area the depth to ground water appears to be several 
tens of feet. 

Pumping, largely for irrigation, is the major discharger of ground water. Total pumpage 
(18,600 af/yr) has been relatively stable since 1971. 

12.2.1.6 Meteorology. The following meteorological information is compiled from 
data from Gale Research Company and U.S. Environmental Data Serviceis. 

UMDA is located within the northern portion of the Columbia Basin, which enjoys a 
relatively mild climate. The temperature ranges from 24° to 90°F, with a mean annual 
temperature of 52.6°F. Normal daily average temperatures vary from 35°F in January to 
70°F in July. The mild temperatures are a result of the moderating effect of the Pacific 
Ocean to the west. 

The majority of the moisture picked up from the Pacific Ocean falls on the western slopes 
of the Pacific Coast Range and the Cascades as the air mass moves eastward. 
I*recipitation in the Hermiston area is relatively low, with an annual mean of 8.87 inches. 
Only about 10 percent of the annual precipitation falls in summer. For the month of 
January, the mean total precipitation is 1.91 inches; during July, the mean total is only 
0.23 inch. The area receives an average of 9.8 inches of snow annually. 

Mean relative humidity varies from 80 percent in January to only 35 percent in July. The 
humidity tends to be approximately five percent higher in the morning throughout the

1.0 Introduction 


year. Consistent with the low summer humidity, 80 to 90 percent annual evaporation 
occurs between May and September. 

1.2.2.2 Individual Site Descriptions 

12.2.2.1 Site 7 - Aniline Pit. The Aniline Ht is located within a small fenced area in 
the south-central portion of the ADA area. This pit was reportedly used to dispose of 
aniline, a missile fuel component 

Most of the fenced area is currently vegetated with low scrub grasses, and there is a small 
area of bare gravel in the center. There is currently no evidence of a pit within the fenced 
area, although a pit was identified in aerial photographs from 1956 through 1975. As 
evidenced fix)m the aerial photographs, the pit was in active use from 1958 until 1970. 

The Aniline Pit covers an area of approximately 10,000 square feet. Topography is 
relatively flat and gently sloping to the northwest. Average elevation within the site is 
about 570 feet above MSL. Surface drainage is in the direction of slope, but is poorly 
developed. 

Soils within the Aniline Ht area consist of poorly graded, fine- to medium-grained sand 
to approximately 4 feet. Below 4 feet, the soil becomes a well-graded sand. 

1.2.2.2.2 Site 8 - Acid Pit. The Acid Ht is a small, limestone-lined, pit located 
immediately south of the Aniline Ht. The pit was reportedly used for the disposal of red 
fuming nitric acid (RFNA), a missile and rocket fuel oxidizer. 

The Acid Pit was first seen in aerial photographs from 1956 and is currently in evidence. 
Based on the aerial photographs, the pit was most active around 1958 and activity was 
observed to be declining in 1965. 

The Acid Ht covers about 1,600 square feet. Topography of the area is charactoized by 
small northeast-southwest trending ridges and a gently northwest slope. The elevation of 
the site is approximately 570 feet above MSL. Surface drainage is in the direction of 
slope. 

Ground water elevation at the site is approximately 465 feet and the flow direction 
appears to be nearly due north. 

Soils at the Acid Ht were observed to be primarily fine- to medium-grained sands and 
gravels, becoming silty with depth. 

1.2.2.2.3 Site 13 - Smoke Canister Disposal Area. The Smoke Canister Disposal Area 
is located in the west-central portion of the ADA. This area was used to dispose of 
burned debris from the UMDA canister burning operations that took place at Site 39, QA 
Function Range. 


JM.67062-45.OU4.Final FS.11/93 1-18 






1.0 Introduction 


The western and central portions of this area consist of a long, narrow, and 
discontinuous mound of soil (500 feet long and 30 to 40 feet wide) containing abundant 
smoke canister debris and other metal debris. The eastern one-quarter to one-third of the 
site consists of a shall ow grass-covered trench with no metal debris observed at the 
surface. The Smoke Canister Disposal Area was visible in a 1950 aerial photograph and 
was apparendy active until sometime between 1965 and 1970. Grading has occurred at 
the site. 

The Smoke Canister Disposal Area covers about 2.5 acres. Topography of the area is 
relatively flat and gently sloping to the northwest with the most obvious features being 
the long, discontinuous mound and shallow depression making up the site itself. Die 
elevation of the site is approximately 520 feet above MSL. Surface drainage is radially 
away from the mounded area. 

Ground water elevation at the site is approximately 440 feet and the flow direction is 
apparently north-northeasL 

Soils at this Area are predominantly fine-grained sand, that grades to silty sand at depths 
of approximately 70 feet. 

1.2.2.2.4 Site 14 - Flare and Fuse Disposal Area/Bird Cage Burn Area. Site 14 is 
located in the west-central portion of the ADA. This site was used to dispose of burned 
residue from the UMDA flare and fuse burning operation. Reportedly, pyrotechnics 
were burned at this site in a separate area referred to as the “bird cage.” 

This area is currently characterized by a 30- by 50- by 5-foot high mound of soil with a 
few metal fragments visible on the mound surface and in the general vicinity. The bird 
cage” is first visible in aerial photographs taken in 1956. The mound of soil is visible in 
1968 photographs. Changes in the area were observed in aerial photographs from 1956 
to 1980. 

Site 14 covers approximately 30,(X)0 square feet Topography of the site is relatively flat 
with a gentle northwest slope. The elevation of the site is approximately 525 feet above 
MSL. Surface drainage at the site is radially away from the mound. 

Ground water elevation in the vicinity of Site 14 was estimated at about 465 feet 
Indications are that the main ground water flow direction within the site is north- 
northeast. 

Soils at Site 14 are predominantly fine- to medium-grained sand that grades to silty-sand 
at a depth of approximately 55 feet 

1.2.2.2.5 Site 15 - TNT Sludge Burial and Burn Area. This area is located in the 
north-central portion of the ADA. Previous investigations at this site concluded that 


JM.67062-45.OU4.Fjnal FS.11/93 1-19 




1.0 Introduction 


TNT-containing sludges from the Explosives Washout Plant (Building 489) may have 
been dumped and burned here. Former installation personnel, however, in^cated that 
paint sludges, shot blast wastes, and deactivation furnace ash and residue were more 
likely to have been disposed of or burned at this site. 

There are at least two mounds of reddish-brown dried sludge material at this site in 
addition to a variety of burned metal and wood debris. Vegetation is sparse and appears 
to be stressed. Based on aerial photographs, activities at Site 15 took place in 1950 (or 
before). Changes in the site were observed through a series of aerial photographs dating 
from 1950 to 1988. Over the years, the site has apparently been subjected to occasional 
(and sometimes extensive) grading. 

The total area of Site 15 is approximately 4.4 acres. The site is relatively flat but with a 
gentle slope to the north. The elevation of the site is approximately 490 feet above MSL. 
Surface drainage is to the north, in the direction of topographic slope. 

Ground water beneath Site 15 is estimated at a depth of about 75 feet. Ground water 
flow was determined to be in a north-northeast direction in the vicinity of the site. 

Soils at Site 15 are a fine- to medium-grained, well-graded sand with some silt The silt 
concentration becomes greater with depth. 

12.2.2.6 Site 16 - Open Detonation Pits. The Open Detonation Pits are located in the 
central portion of the ADA. These pits have been, and are cxurently being used for the 
detonation of various conventional munitions. UMDA currently conducts detonation 
operations at this site under an Air Contaminant Discharge Permit from the ODEQ16. 
These operations will cease in September 1994 at which time they will be closed under 
the conditions of the permit. Possible soil contamination at this site will be addressed as 
part of the ADA operable unit in this Feasibility Study. 

There are several rows of pits, with about 8 to 12 pits (spaced approximately 100 feet 
apart) per row. The pits are typically 15 feet wide and approximately 5 to 8 feet deep. 
Very little vegetation exists in the active part of this site. Sparse and stressed vegetation 
and abundant debris were observed at various locations. Aerial photographs dating from 
1950 give evidence of activities at the site. Throughout the course of site activities, aerial 
photographs give evidence that more than 40 pits existed in the site area. Some of the 
pits had been graded over. 

Site 16 covers approximately 62 acres. Topography of the area is relatively flat and 
consists of a number of low-lying ridges extending northeast-southwest. The elevation 
of the site is approximately 560 above MSL. Surface drainage is to the north-northwest, 
in the direction of topographic slope. 

Ground water beneath Site 16 is estimated to be at a depth of approximately 95 feet 
There is an overall northwestward ground water flow direction across the site. 


JM.67062-45.OU4.Flnal FS.11/93 1 -20 





1.0 Introduction 


Soils at Site 16 arc fine- to medium-grained, moderately graded sand becoming sUtier 
with depth. In some pits, soil samples indicated the presence of an ash material and 
cemented sands. 

1.22.2.7 Site 17 - Aboveground Open Detonation (OD)Area. The OD Area is located 
in the central portion of the ADA. The Area was used for the detonation of 
decon taminat ed M55 rockets and M23 land mines. 

In OD operations at Site 17, munitions were placed in a horizontal steel tube running 
through the center of a 5- by 5- by 4-foot high, gravel-filled metal bin for detonation. 
Abundant metal fragments are present on the soil and a mound of fine-grained soil, 
possibly containing some ash material, is present. The site was apparent only on aerial 
photographs taken in 1980 and 1988. 

Site 17 is approximately 2.3 acres. The topography of the area is relatively flat, but the 
site is bordered by a small ridge immediately to the north. Average elevation of the site is 
515 feet above MSL. Surface drainage is poorly developed, but runoff from the ridge to 
the north may cause ponding in the vicinity of the site during periods of heavy rainfall. 

The depth to ground water at Site 17 is estimated at approximately 72 feet. The probable 
direction of ground water flow beneath the site is to the north-northeast. 

Surface soils encountered at Site 17 included poorly graded, fine- to medium-grained 
sand and well-graded, coarse-grained sand. 

1.2.2.2.8 Site 18 - Dunnage Pits. The Dunnage Pits are located in the north-central 
portion of the ADA. The two cuircntly visible pit areas are separated by a gravel road 
with the larger pit on the west side of the road. 

The Pits were reportedly used to dispose of and bum dunnage and possibly liquid wastes 
such as waste solvents, oils, paint strippers, and sludges from the Explosives Washout 
Plant operations. 

Aerial photographs indicate that a least six dunnage pits once existed in the area east of 
the current pits. When pits were full, they were apparently graded over and new pits 
were dug. The pits were first apparent in 1956 photographs. The two existing pits were 
first not^ in the 1988 photographs. 

The entire Site 18 area covers approximately 6.5 acres. The site is relatively flat, with a 
gentle slope to the north. The elevation of the site is approximately 495 feet above MSL. 
Surface drainage is to the north, in the direction of topographic slope. 

Ground water depth is estimated at approximately 79 feet below the siuface. An overall 
northwestward ground water flow direction across the site is indicated. 


JM.67062-45.0U4.Flnal FS.11/93 1 -21 




1.0 Introduction 


Soil immediately below Site 18 is fine- to medium-grained, poorly to moderately well- 
graded sand becoming siltier with depth. In sample test pits located in Dunnage Pits, soil 
was discolored and contained ash and charcoal material. 

12.2.2.9 Site 19 - Open Burning (OB) Trenches!Pads. The OB Trenches/Pads are 
located in the north-central portion of the ADA. The trenches were reportedly used to 
bum a variety of debris and waste, including ordnance waste. Former UMDA personnel 
indicate that explosive sludges from Explosives Washout Plant operations were burned 
in the northernmost trenches and that pesticides and furnace ash may also have been 
burned in this area. 

The site consists of two adjacent parts; a row of approximately 10 former bum trenches; 
and a bum field area to the north and east of the bum trenches. Pits and trenches at the 
site have been apparent in aerial photographs dating from 1950. The site has been 
subjected to periodic grading. 

Site 19 covers approximately 50 acres. It is relatively flat, with a gentle topographic 
slope to the norA. The elevation of the site ranges from approximately 460 feet above 
MSL in the north to 530 feet above MSL in the south. Surface drainage is poorly 
developed, but is expected to be to the north, in the direction of topographic slope. 

Depth to ground water at Site 19 ranges from 67 to 95.5 feet, with an estimated average 
of approximately 81 feet. Ground water flow direction varies somewhat across the site. 
A northwestward flow was detected beneath the eastern part of the site. Ground water 
flows nearly due north beneath the western part of the site. 

Site 19 is immediately underlain by fine- to medium-grained, poorly to well-graded sand 
with minor gravel. The gravel does not appear to be native to Ae ADA. Several of the 
soil samples in the trenches indicated the presence of ash or a cemented white material. 

1.222.10 Site 21 - Missile Fuel Storage Areas. The Missile Fuel Storage Area is 
located in the south-central portion of the ADA. The area contains sheds that were used 
to store missile fuel components. 

Three sheds were first apparent in aerial photographs taken in 1956. In 1965 
photographs, a fourth shed was observed. In 1968, graded areas on the south and east 
edges of the site were observed. In 1974 photographs, one of the sheds was gone. 
Changes to the site were observed in aeri^ photographs from 1956 to 1980. 

Site 21 covers approximately 40 acres. The site is characterized by gently rolling 
topography, with an overall slope to the north. A typical site elevation is 574 feet above 
MSL. Surface drainage is poorly developed, but is generally to the north. 


JM.67062-45.0U4.FinaJ FS.11/g3 1 -22 




1.0 Introduction 


Ground water was encountered during well installation at a depth of 76 feet. Water level 
data from weUs adjacent to the site indicate that the primary ground water flow direction 
under the Missile Fuel Storage Area is nearly due north. 

1.2222.11 Site 31 - Pesticide Pits. The Pesticide Pits are located in the south-central 
portion of the ADA. Some former UMDA personnel indicated that these pits wCTe used 
to bum or dispose of pesticide solutions. Other personnel contended that pesticide 
solutions were never disposed of at UMDA, but were shipped off site to other Army 
depots for disposal. 

Currently, 10 open pits are located in an east-west trending row in the site area. Every 
other pit is offset along this row. The open pits are approximately 15 feet in diameter and 
are partially filled with debris to a depth of about three feet below grade. In addition, at 
least two former pits are located in line with, and east of, the 10 open pits. The site was 
first apparent in aerial photographs dating from 1950. Pits were first observed in 1958 
photographs. Based on aerial photographs, activities at the site were conducted from the 
1950s to the 1980s. Grading at various portions of the site took place throughout those 
years. 

The Pesticide Pits cover an area of approximately 36 acres. The site is relatively flat with 
a gentle topographic slope to the north. The elevation of the site is approximately 570 
feet above MSL. Surface drainage is to the north, in the direction of topographic slope. 

Depth to ground water is estimated at approximately 86 feet. Overall ground water flow 
direction is indicated to be to the north. 


Soil at the site consists of fine- to medium-grained, poorly to well-graded sand with 
minor surface gravels. With depth, the sand gradually fines to silt and finer sands near 
the water table. 

1.22.2.12 Site 32 - Open Burning Trays. Two areas of Open Burning Trays are located 
in the central portion of the ADA: one area is in the north area, the other is in the south 
area. The steel trays with aluminum covers are used to bum explosives and propellant 
fiom disassembled smaU munitions. UMDA conducts burning operations at tins site 
under an Air Conta minan t Discharge Permit fixtm the ODEQ16. These trays will cease 
operation in September 1994 at which time they will be closed under the conditions of the 
permit Possible soil contamination at this site will be addressed as part of the ADA 
operable unit in this Feasibility Study. 

The southern tray site was in evidence in aerial photographs taken in 1950. The northern 
site was visible in 1951 photographs. Various levels of activity existed at the northern 
and southern sites from 1950 to Ae present. 

Each area of Site 32 covers approximately one acre. Topography within boA areas is 
relatively flat However, regional topographic slope is to Ae norA. The elevation of Ae

1.0 Introduction 


northern bum tray is approximately 508 above MSL, while the elevation of the southern 
bum tray is approximately 530 feet above MSL. Surface drainage in both areas is poorly 
developed, with precipitation expected to infiltrate rapidly into the coarse-grained near¬ 
surface soils. 

Depth to ground water at the northern tray site is approximately 75 feet Ground water at 
the southern tray site is approximately 85 feet below the surface. The primary direction 
of ground water flow at toth Site 32 areas is expected to be due north. 

Surface soils collected at both Site 32 areas consisted of poorly graded, medium- to fine¬ 
grained sand. This soil was intermixed with some non-native gravels from the gravel 
pad. 

1222.13 Site 38 - Pit Field Area. The Pit Field Area is located in the central portion of 
the ADA. It is believed that these pits may have been used to explode and dispose of old 
or faulty ordnance. 

Aerial photographs and on-site observations reveal the existence of several rows of pits 
^proximately 8 to 10 feet in diameter and about one to two feet deep. Nearly 100 pits 
were identifi^ during on-site inspections. The pits are visible in aerial photographs as 
early as 1950. Later photographs indicate that the pits were periodically used until 1968. 
There was apparently no grading of the area during this period. 

Site 38 covers approximately 52 acres. The site is characterized by small northeast- 
southwest trending ridges, with an overall topographic slope to the north. The elevation 
of the site ranges ftom approximately 520 feet above MSL in the north to approximately 
545 fee above MSL in the south. Surface drainage is poorly developed, but is generally 
to the north. 

Based on available data, ground water beneath Site 38 is at an average depth of 76 feet 
An overall northeastward ground water flow direction is assumed at the site. 

Site 38 is immediately underlain by fine- to medium-grained, poorly graded sand and 
silty sand, with some cementation or compaction at various depths within the top 10 feet 

122.2.14 Site 41 - GB/VX Decontamination Solution Burial Areas. Site 41 is the 
location of a suspected burial area for solutions used to decontaminate munitions 
containing GB or VX. The site is located at the northwestern part of the ADA. 

The site was first observed in aerial photographs taken in 1956. Initially, a trench and a 
pile of soil were observed. The pile of soil was no longer visible in 1958 photographs. 

In 1970, the trench appeared to be abandoned and a new pit was noted. The pit was 
observed to be active in 1972. No significant level of activity was noted from 1974 to 
1988. In 1988 photographs, it was observed that both the trench and the pit had been 
covered with soil. 


JM.67062^.CXJ4.Final FS. 11/93 1 -24 



1.0 Introduction 


Site 41 consists of a trench and a pit. The topography in the general area is relatively flat, 
but with a gentle slope to the northwest. The surface elevation at the site is approximately 
460 feet above MSL. Surface drainage is to the northwest. 

Ground water beneath Site 41 is estimated to be at a depth of approximately 64 feet. 
Ground water flow direction is to the north. 

Soil at the site is characterized by loose, poorly graded sand to a depth of 10 feet. The 
soil gradually fines with depth to a silt before bedrock is encountered at a depth of 
approximately 60 feet. 

1.2.22.15 Site 55 - Trench/Burn Field. Site 55 is located in the northcentral portion of 
the ADA. It consists of several rows of bum trenches; however, interviews with current 
or former UMDA personnel did not reveal any specific operations that took place at the 
site. 

The bum trenches (consisting of three northwest-southeast trending rows of trenches) 
were observed to be quite active in 1950 aerial photographs. These trenches appeared to 
have been abandoned by 1956. In the 1956 photographs, the TNT Sludge Burial and 
Bum Area (Site 15) had been constmcted over the eastern portion of Site 55. 

Site 55 covers an area of approximately 9 acres. Topography within the area slopes to 
the northwest, with an average elevation of about 490 feet above MSL. Surface drainage 
is poorly developed, but is generally in the direction of slope. 

It is estimated that depth to ground water beneath this site is approximately 70 to 80 feet 
Ground water flow direction is expected to be northeast 

The surface soil encountered at the site consisted of poorly graded, fine- to medium¬ 
grained sand. 

1.2.2.2.16 Site 56 - Munitions Crate Burn Area. Site 56 is located in the northcentral 
portion of the ADA. This area was reportedly used to bum empty wooden crates that 
were used to hold munitions. 

Aerial photographs indicate that Site 56 was active prior to 1950 through 1965. In 1950 
photographs, the area consisted of a dark-toned circular area with a diameter of 
approximately 80 feet. Some grading was apparently performed at the site between 1956 
and 1958. The site was apparently abandoned by 1956. 

The Munitions Crate Bum Area covers approximately 2 acres. Topography of the area is 
relatively flat and gently sloping to the northwest. Average elevation of the site is about 
520 feet above MSL. Surface drainage is poorly developed but expected to be to the 
northwest. 


JM,67062^.0U4.FlnaJ FS. 11/93 1 -25 



1.0 Introduction 


Depth to ground water at Site 56 is expected to be 80 to 90 feet. A northwestward 
ground water flow direction is assumed. 

Soils near the surface (to 3.5 feet) consisted of a well-graded, fine- to medium-grained 
sand. Soil from 3.5 to 5.5 feet deep samples indicated a poorly graded, fine- to medium¬ 
grained sand. 

1222.17 Site 57 - Former Pit Area Locations. Site 57 consists of three areas 
designated as Locations 1,11, and n located in the northcentral, central, and southcentral 
portions (respectively) of the ADA. Although specific uses of the sites were not revealed 
in interviews with former UMDA personnel, it is assumed that operations involving the 
detonation and/or burning of munitions were conducted consistent in nature to those 
conducted elsewhere in the ADA. 

All of the areas were active or appeared to be disturbed in aerial photographs prior to 
1950. No activities at Location I were observed in subsequent photographs and a recent 
on-site inspection revealed that these pits are no longer apparent. Changes at Location 11 
were minimal in photographs from 1950 to 1988; however, the pits are still apparent. 
Some activities were observed at Location ID in 1951 and 1956 photographs. No 
changes were observed at Location in from 1956 to the present, although the pits are still 
apparent 

Location I covers approximately 18 acres. The topography at this location is relatively 
flat with a gentle slope to the northwest. Elevations range from approximately 470 to 500 
feet above MSL. Surface drainage is poorly developed, but is generally to the north. 
Ground water depth is approximately 72 feet and flows nearly due north. 

Location II covers roughly 20 acres. The site is situated in a valley between two 
northeast-southwest trending ridges. Topography is relatively flat, with the exception of 
the long mound created by Site 13 that overlays the area. Elevations average about 518 
feet above MSL. Surface drainage is poorly developed, but is generally toward the valley 
from either ridge and radially from the mound formed by Site 13. Depth to ground water 
is estimated at 65 to 90 feet. Ground water flow direction is slightly northeast 

Location HI is approximately 60 acres in area. Topography consists of a series of 
northwest-southeast trending low-lying ridges and an overall gentle northwest slope. 

The average elevation in this area is approximately 570 feet above MSL. Surface 
drainage is poorly developed, but is generally to the northwest Depth to ground water is 
estimated at approximately 82 feet Ground water flow direction is nearly due north. 

Soils underlying Locations I and 11 consist of fine - to medium-grained, poorly to well- 
graded sand. Location HI is immediately underlain by fine-grained, silty sand.

1.0 Introduction 


1.222.18 Site 58 - BorrowIBurnIDisposal Area. Site 58 is l^ated in the northeast 
comer of the ADA. The specific activities that took place at this site are unknown; 
however, it is assumed that ammunition demolition or disposal activities similar to those 
conducted elsewhere took place. 

The site appeared as a bare, light-toned area in a 1950 aerial photograph. Photographs 
fiom the mid-1950s indicate that burning activities may have taken place at the site. 
Limited activities at the site were apparent in photographs through 1968. By 1970, site 
definition was minimal Current visual inspections revealed only a light-toned grass and 
a few charred pieces of wood. 

Site 58 covers approximately 4 acres. Topography consists of gently rolling hills, with a 
regional slope to the northwest. Surface elevation of the site is approximately 460 feet 
above MSL. Surface drainage is poorly developed, but is expected to be toward the 
northwest. 

Depth to ground water at Site 58 is estimated to be about 70 feet. A northwestward 
ground water flow direction is assumed. 

Soils at the site consist of a moderately well-graded, fine- to medium-grained sand. 

12.22.19 Site 59 - GBIVX Decontamination Solution Disposal Areas. This site is 
located in the central portion of the ADA. Reportedly, GBAOC decontamination solutions 
were disposed of on the bare soil in site areas in the early 1960s. 

Bare soil areas were visible in aerial photographs from 1950. In 1958 photographs, the 
northern part of the site was shown to contain a spot that appeared to be wet or stained by 
a liquid. Photographs from 1958 to 1980 indicate limited activities at the site. A 1988 
photograph shows a bare area of ground in the southern part of the site. Based on the 
photographic observations, it was concluded that the two identified areas were the most 
likely disposal locations. 

Site 58 consists of two pits. The site is relatively flat, but with a gentle slope to the 
northwest. The surface elevation at the site is approximately 560 feet above MSL. 
Surface drainage is to the northwest, in the direction of slope. 

Depth to ground water at Site 59 is estimated to be at an average depth of approximately 
105 feet Overall ground water flow direction is apparently to the north-northwest. 

Surface soil at the site consists of fine- to medium-grained, well-graded sand. 

Subsurface soil is similarly grained, but poorly graded. 

12.2220 Site 60 - Active Firing Range. The Active Firing Range is located near the 
southwest comer of the ADA. The site includes an active rifle and machine gun and 


JM.67062.45.CXJ4.FlnalFS.11/93 1-27 




1.0 introduction 


grenade range in the western portion and an active pistol range in the eastern portion. 

The firing range has been in use by the National Guard since the early 1980s. There are 
no man-made impact areas behind the targets in either shooting location. 

A review of aerial photographs revealed no significant information regarding this site. 

An on-site visual inspection revealed the presence of a significant number of bullets and 
blue plastic grenade fragments. 

Site 60 covers approximately 18 acres. A small northwest-trending ridge is present at the 
center of the site. Typical site elevations are 570 to 575 feet above MSL. Surface 
drainage is poorly developed, but is in the direction of topographic slope. The firing 
range is sparsely vegetated, which increases the extent of wind erosion at this site. 

The depth to ground water is estimated at about 50 feet. It is expected that the ground 
water flow direction is probably north or slightly northeast, consistent with overall ADA 
ground water flow. 

Surface soils consist of poorly graded, medium- to fine-grained sand. 

1.2.3 Nature and Extent of Contamination 

The following discussion provides a brief description of the nature and extent of 
contaminants detected at the ADA sites. This summary is based on data and information 
developed in the RI (and supplemented by the RA) and describes the occurrence of 
contaminants of concern. A more detailed description and summary of contaminants of 
concern in soil and ground water is provided in Section 1.2.5.1, Selection of 
Contaminants of Concern. The development of affected (contaminated) areas and soil 
volumes is presented in Section 2.3.2, Estimated Areas and Volumes of Contaminated 
Media Requiring Remediation. It should be noted that since the completion of the RI and 
RA, additional soil sampling and analyses have been performed at ADA 
Sites 15,17,18, and 19. The effect of these additional soil characterizations on the 
development of contaminated soil areas and volumes is provided in Appendix B of this 
report. 

At each site, it was determined that the primary route of migration of contaminants in soil 
was through windblown dust. Based on data developed in the RI, it appears unlikely that 
soil contamination at the ADA sites has impacted ground water quality underneath the 
ADA.

1.2.4 Contaminant Fate and Transport 

The exposure to humans and the environment imposed by the contaminants of concern 
identified at UMDA is influenced by a number of factors. These factors include the 
interrelated characteristics of the contaminants such as physical and chemical properties 
and environmental fate and transport parameters. Fate and transport profiles for each of 
the contaminants of concern at UMDA are presented in Appendix C of the RA^. Physical 
and chemical characteristics and environmental fate parameters for orgaitic and inorganic 
contaminants of concern at UMDA are summarized in Tables A-1 and A-2 in Appendix A 
of this FS. Note that Appendix A has been extracted from the RA; full reference citations 
are provided in the RA4. 

The primary factors that affect the fate and transport of contaminants of concern in soil at 
the ADA include: photolysis, sorption (absorption and adsorption) to soil; and 
bioaccumulation. To a more limited extent, biotransformation and biodegradation may 
impact the fate and transport of the orgaruc contaminants of concern. Mobility of the 
contaminants through soil to ground water is not a particular concern at the ADA due to 
the relative immobility of the contaminants of concern as well as the depth to ground 
water (in excess of 5() feet). 


JM.67062-45.0U4.FinaJ FS. 11/93 1 -30 




1.0 Introduction 


In general, the metals found at the ADA are relatively immobile in soil. This immobility 
is affected by the insolubility of the metals in water as well as the sorption of some metals 
to soil particles. The metals are generally present in nonvolatile forms and are 
nondegradable, both characteristics that will limit the potential for natural restoration of 
the soil. Many of the metals found at the ADA will bioaccumulate and therefore impact 
specific human and environmental exposure routes. 

The fate and transport of explosive contaminants of concern at the ADA are primarily 
affected by photolysis and soiption. Although the explosives are generally resistant to 
biodegradation, degradation has been observed under optimum conditions. In general, 
the explosive contaminants are nonvolatile and are insoluble in water. 

Sorption of pesticide contaminants of concern to soil is an important factor in the 
environmental fate and transport of these compounds. In dry soils, volatility of the 
pesticides is not a significant factor in their transport. The pesticides are relatively 
insoluble in water. 


1.2.5 Human Health Baseline Risk Assessment 

This section of the FS summarizes the results of the Human Health Baseline Risk 
Assessment (RA) of the ADA4. For a detailed presentation of the results, and a thorough 
discussion of methodology employed, refer to the RA. 

1.2.5.1 Selection of Contaminants of Concern. The data used in the development 
of the RA are from the Westoni7 and/or Dames and Moore (1990-1992) remedial 
investigations. These particular data were selected because they better represent current 
site conditions and because sample collection and analysis were conducted using 
USATHAMA protocols. The potential contaminants of concern from those 
investigations were those that met one or more of the following criteria: 

• Positive detection in at least one sample in at least one medium 

• Significant elevation above method blanks (5-10 times the method blank 
concentration depending on the compound) 

• Inorganic compounds present at concentrations above the maximum background 
sample concentration 

• Tentatively Identified Compounds (TICs) if known to be site related 

• Identified as transformation products of other contaminants of concern 

Ck)ntaminants identified in ground water and soil based on the above criteria for the ADA 
are summarized in Table 1-1 and Table 1-2, respectively. For reference, background 
concentrations of the contaminants are included (if available or appropriate) in these 
tables. In addition, for future reference. Table 1-2 provides risk-based concentrations of 
contaminants that represent an excess cancer risk of 1 x 10-6 or a hazard quotient of 1. 
These data will be discussed in Section 1.2.5.5, Risk Based Remedial Action Criteria, 
and are presented here for reference only.

1.0 Introduction 


In identifying contaminants in soil, it was assumed that soil at depths greater than 10 feet 
would not be available for exposure; therefore, only soils collected from 10 feet or 
shallower were included in this analysis. 

From the information presented in Tables 1-1 and 1-2, the following is observed: 

• Of the sites for which ground water was sampled and analyzed. Site 59 does not 
contain contaminants of concern in ground water (note that ground water was not 
characterized at Sites 7,17,21,32,56,58, and 60 - typically because of the 
proximity of these sites to others where ground water was characterized). 

♦ Of all the ADA sites. Sites 7,58, and 59 do not contain contaminants of concern in 
soil. 

Note that the contaminants presented in Tables 1-1 and 1-2 reflect only those 
contaminants that are classified as contaminants of concern based on Ae above criteria. 
Subsequent assessments to determine and identify contaminants that contribute to 
unacceptable risk are summarized on a site-by-site basis in Section 2.3.2, Estimated 
Areas and Volumes of Contaminated Media Requiring Remediation. 

1.2.5.2 Toxicity Assessment. The purpose of the toxicity assessment is to 
qualitatively and quantitatively assess the toxicological hazards of the contaminants of 
concern as a function of the anticipated route of exposure (e.g., ingestion or inhalation). 

Toxicological profiles were developed as part of the RA and are included in the Appendix 
of that document. The profiles include the following information (when such information 
is available): noncarcinogenic effects and reference doses for oral ingestion and 
inhalation; carcinogenic effects, slope factors and weights-of-evidence for oral ingestion, 
dermal absorption, and inhalation; and references. 

Quantitative toxicity data are presented in terms of reference doses and slope factors. 
Reference doses (RfD) values are used to evaluate noncarcinogenic effects. RfDs are 
derived from "no-observed-adverse-effect levels" (NOAELs), which represent the 
highest experimental exposiue level at which a particular critical toxic effect is not 
observed. 

Cancer slope factors (SF) are used to evaluate potential human carcinogenic risks. An SF 
is defined as an estimate of the upper 95 percent confidence limit of the slope of the dose- 
response curve extrapolated to low doses, and is considered to be a measure of the cancer 
causing potential of a chenucal. RfDs and SFs are provided for both ingestion and 
inhalation exposure pathways. 

Toxicity values used in the RA were obtained from the Integrated Risk Information 
System (IRIS), the Health Effects Assessment Summary Tables (HEAST), EPA Region

in toxicity criteria, the Public Health Risk Evaluation Database, Drinking Water Criteria 
documents, Ambient Water Quality criteria documents, Air Quality Criteria documents, 
and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) toxicity profiles. 

Toxicity values used in the RA are summarized in Table 1-3 for contaminants of concern 
identified in ground water and soil at the ADA. 

t.2.5.3 Exposure Assessment The purpose of the exposure assessment is to: 
identify potential human and environmental receptors; identify and evaluate potential 
current and future exposure pathways; and determine the extent of exposure under site- 
specific current and ftiture land use scenarios. The following 12 potential exposure 
pathways were identify for current and future receptors at UMDA as well as in the 
vicinity of the installation: 

Pathway Description 

1 Dermal contact with contaminated soil 

2 Inadvertent ingestion of contaminated soil 

3 Inhalation of contaminated soil as airborne dust 

4 Inhalation of vapors volatilized from soil 

5 Ingestion of contaminated drinking water 

6 Inhalation of volatile contaminants emitted fiom ground water during 
showering 

7 Dermal contact with contaminated ground water during showering 

8 Dermal contact of contaminated ground water during non-showering 
use 

9 Inhalation of vapors during non-showering use of ground water 

10 Consumption of game that feeds on vegetation that grows in 
contaminated soil 

11 Consumption of livestock (or their milk) that feed on vegetation 
growing in contaminated soil and/or that consume contaminated 
ground water 

12 Consumption of crops irrigated by contaminated ground water and/or 
grown in contaminated soil 

Pathways were reviewed for both current and future land use. Under current land use 
conditions, it was assumed that two receptors exist: UMDA employees and nearby 
residents. 

Specific receptors identified for future land use are dependent on the selected use. 
Scenarios considered for future land use include: residential, industrial, military, 
agricultural, and recreation. Of the possible future land uses, residential land use 
generally yields the highest exposures because of the long exposure fiequency and

1.0 Introduction 


duration for this population. Therefore, the residential scenario is assumed to be the most 
conservative future scenario and the most appropriate land use to consider when 
estimating risks or hazards. 

At the ADA, the future military use of the sites by the Oregon National Guard for tank 
training exercises was evaluated in addition to residential future use. In this scenario, 
only pathway 3 (inhalation of contaminated soil as airborne dust) was considered. 

Pathways that were excluded from consideration at a specific site were done so using the 
following rationale: 

• Sampling was not performed because the medium and/or contaminant was not 
considered to be of concern. 

• The contaminant source applicable to the specific pathway has been shown to not 
exist based on sampling results. 

• The transport mechanism for the pathway does not exist at the site. 

• The receptor does not exist at the site. 

• The exposure route cannot exist at the site for other reasons. 

In addition, on a site-by-site basis, certain pathways may not have been quantified 
because: (1) the exposure resulting from the pathway is much less than that from another 
analogous pathway; (2) the potential magnitude of the exposure is low; or (3) the 
probability of the exposure occurring is very low. 

Pathways included for quantification for the ADA are summarized in Table 1-4 for 
current land use and Table 1-5 for future land use. 

For each quantified pathway, an average daily intake is calculated using a variety of 
assumptions including: receptor body weight; frequency of exposure; exposure duration; 
respiration rates; absorption factors; skin surface areas; and ingestion rates. For detail 
regarding specific parameters that are included in the individual pathways, refer to the 
RA. 

1.2.5.4 Human Health Risk Evaluation. The purpose of the human health risk 
characterization is to relate exposure estimates to toxicity to estimate the potential health 
hazards and/or risks posed by the contaminated media. 

The risk characterization is conducted by combining the toxicological data with the 
average daily intakes. For the ADA patiiways, potential incremental cancer risks (risks) 
are calculated by multiplying the daily intake averaged over the receptor's lifetime by the 
SF. According to the NCP, acceptable exposure levels resulting from these calculations 
are genwally those that represent an excess upperbound lifetime cancer risk to an 
individual of between 1x10-4 and 1x10-6.

1.0 introduction 


Hazard quotients (HQ) are calculated for noncarcinogenic risks by dividing the average 
daily intake by the RfD. Risks and HQs are calculated for each pathway and then 
summed to yield the total site risk and HQ. Human health hazards related to exposure are 
generally considered of concern when the HQ exceeds 1. 

It is acknowledged that the total risks and HQ for each pathway are probably 
overestimated, because combining risk and hazard quotients assumes the additivity of 
toxic effects within the human body when, in fact, chemicals with different mechanisms 
of toxic action may act independently^. 

In addition to the calculations described above, an uptake/biokinetic model was used in 
the RA to evaluate potential exposure to lead at the ADA sites. The evaluation was 
conducted for the various sites at UMDA where lead concentrations in soil exceed 2(X) 
ppm. The results of application of this model indicate that several sites have lead 
concentrations that may yield unacceptable exposure levels. The exact number of sites 
will depend on the percentage of the population to be protected and the blood lead cutoff 
level selected. The implications of this calculation will be presented in Section 1.2.5.5, 
Risk Based Remedial Action Criteria. 

1.25.4.1 Current Land Use Scenarios. A summary of risk and hazards estimated 
under current land use conditions at UMDA (including the ADA sites) is presented in 
Table 1-6. These risks and hazards reflect those imposed on the 11 receptor populations 
quantitatively evaluated in the baseline RA as shown. Of the current receptors, the 
highest risks and hazards apply to the OD pit/open burning tray workers, whose multiple 
pathway risk and hazard are 8x10-7 and 2xl0-i, respectively. These values are below the 
levels of concern (cancer risk less than 1x10-6 and HQ less than 1). 

1.25.42 Future Land Use Scenarios. A summary of risks and hazards calculated for 
ADA sites at which contaminants of concern were identified is presented in 
Table 1-7 for both residential and military future use. As shown in Table 1-5 (summary 
of pathways quantified for each site), risks and hazards were calculated in the RA for 
crop and/or game ingestion (pathways 10,11, and 12). Risks associated with these 
ingestion pathways are not included in the quantification of risks and hazards for the 
ADA in accordance with guidance from EPA and DEQi^. Table 1-7 reflects this deletion. 

The risks and hazards summarized in Table 1-7 indicate the following: 

• For future residential use, risks and hazards are below a cancer risk of 1x10-6 
and/or HQ of 1 at Sites 21 and 60; these risks and/or hazards are exceeded at all 
other sites. 


For future residential use, risks and hazards are below a cancer risk of 1x10-5 
and/or HQ of 1 at Sites 21,321,56, and 60; these risks and/or hazards are 
exceeded at all other sites.

1.0 Introduction 


• For future military use, risks and hazards are below a cancer risk of 1x10-6 and 
HQ of 1 at Sites 13, 16,17, 321, 38, 41, 56, 571, 5711, 57ni, and 60; these risks 
and/or hazards are exceeded at Sites 14,15,18,19, and 31. 

1.2.5.43 Ground Water at the ADA. The above discussion reflects contamination 
and resulting risks and hazards relating to both ground water and soil at the ADA. 
Although both media contribute to the overall risks and hazards, a few observations with 
respect to ground water at the ADA need to be discussed. 

One of the conclusions of the RI was that the spread of contamination due to 
contaminants in the soil was through windblown dust. There was no evidence that 
migration of con taminan ts in soil was responsible, or would in the future be responsible, 
for ground watCT contamination beneath the ADA. This conclusion is supported by the 
general absence of any specific correlation between contaminants of concern in soil and 
ground water as well as the lack of evidence that contaminants of concern in ground 
water have any relation to activities performed at the ADA. 

For the most part, ground water characterizations at the ADA indicated the presence of 
various levels of inorganic elements or compounds that were identified in background 
ground water chacterizations. In addition, these inorganics were consistently identified 
across the entire installation and were not restricted to the ADA. 

Exceptions to the background inorganic contamination were three detected organics 
(1,3-dinitrobenzene at Site 19, RDX at Site 31, and benzene at Site 31). Each of these 
organics was detected in a single sample with a resulting upper 95 percent confidence 
limit concentration below detection limits in each case (refer to Section 3.0 of the RA). 
None of these organic contaminants were drivers of the risks and hazards of their 
respective sites. 

The most notable of contaminants of concern in ground water is arsenic, which was 
detected in levels above background at all sites at which ground water was characterized 
(with the exception of Site 59). The presence of arsenic in ground water proved to be a 
driving factor in the determination of risks and hazards at a majority of sites. In fact, at 
Sites 8,14, 38,41,55,571, 5711, and 60, it is the only contributor to total risks greater 
than 1x10-6 and total HCJs greater than 1. In addition, in no instance was the 
concentration of arsenic in ground water (at the 95% percent confidence limit) greater 
than the maximum concentration limit of 50 |xg/l. 

Based on the observation discussed above, the remediation of ground water will not be 
addressed in this FS. Although ground water remediation will not be addressed, its 
contribution to the total risks and hazards as imposed by exposure pathways 5,6, and 7 
will be continued throughout the FS. To illustrate the impact of these pathways on the 
total risks and hazards associated with future residential use. Table 1-8 has been prepared 
to reflect a breakdown of risks and hazards associated with specific ground water-related 
and non-ground water-related exposure pathways. 


JM.67062^.OU4.FinaJ FS.11/93 1 -48 




1.0 Introduction 


From Table 1-8, it can be seen that regardless of the contribution of contaminated soil 
(represented by exposure pathways 1,2, and 3), ground water-related risks and hazards 
exceed the future residential use criteria (risk of IxlO-^ and HQ of 1) at Sites 8,13,14, 
15, 16,18, 19, 31, 38,41, 55, 571, 5711, and 57III. It should be noted, however, that 
these exceedences are due to the presence of arsenic in the ground water which, in all 
cases, is below the maximum concentration limit of 50 |i.g/l. 

The above observation implies that even if soil is cleaned to the degree that exposure 
pathways 1,2, and 3 no longer pose unacceptable risk or hazards, the total site risks and 
hazards quantified for the site will exceed the risk (1x10-6) and HQ (1) criteria at these 
sites. However, in no case will the total risk exceed 7x10^ or the total HQ exceed 4. 

1.2.5.5 Risk Based Remedial Action Criteria. For each of the land use scenarios, 
risk-based preliminary remediation goals (PRGs) were developed as part of the RA. 
Risk-based PRGs indicate acceptable residual contaminant concentrations based on the 
following target human health risk values: incremental cancer risks equal to 10-6; and 
hazard quotients equal to 1. The risk-based PRGs are back-calculated from the target risk 
levels for each contaminant in each media. Risk-based PRGs are not calculated for the 
current land use scenario because all current cancer risks and HQs fall below the target 
values of 10-6 (cancer risk) and 1.0 (HQ). 

The single exception to this method of calculation of risk-based PRGs is lead. An action 
level of 500 |i.g/g has been established for lead at the ADAis, Based on the 
uptake/biokinetic model used in the RA to evaluate potential exposure to lead, a residual 
concentration of 500 p.g/g would result in 92% of children having blood lead levels of 
less than or equal to 10 |ig/dL and greater than 99.5% of the children would have blood 
lead levels of less than or equal to 15 lig/dL. 

A summary of risk-based PRGs calculated for contaminants in soil at the ADA is 
presented in Table 1-9. Note that only risk-based PRGs for contaminants in soil are 
provided since it has been determined that ground water remediation will not be 
addressed in this FS (see Section 1.2.5.4.3, Ground Water at the ADA). 

One point of note with respect to the risk-based PRGs presented in Table 1-9 is that, in 
several instances (barium, cadmium, and chromium, for example), risk-based PRGs for 
the light industrial and military use scenarios are considerably lower than those for the 
residential use scenario. This is in contrast to the general assumption that the residential 
use scenario provides the most conservative approach. Based on these “anomalies,” this 
assumption may nofalways be the case. Examination of the calculations involved in 
determining the risks and hazards associated with ingestion and inhalation of 
contaminated dust confirms this. In these calculations, it was assumed that future light 
industrial workers or military personnel involved in training would be located and 
performing routine activities closer to the source of dust emissions and therefore would 
be exposed to higher concentrations of contamination. For the protection of such

workers and personnel, the soils where the dust originates would have to be less 
contaminated (with respect to specific contaminants) than would be required for 
residents. Modeled air concentrations supporting these observations are provided in 
Appendix E, Table E-6 of the RA.4 

1.2.6 Ecological Risk Assessment 

The following discussion provides a brief summary of the Ecological Assessment (EA) 
performed for UMDA as presented in the Draft Final Ecological Assessment Report 
For a detailed account of the EA, refer to the referenced EA report. 

The EA involved the conduct of a multi-step process to evaluate the affects and potential 
affects to site biota from contaminants in soil at UMDA. These steps includedi^: 

• Evaluation of site activities resulting in the chemical releases 

• Characterization of the installation physical features, habitats, potentially exposed 
biota and identification of indicator species 

• Observation of habitat disruptions potentially related to toxic effects 

• Identification of contaminants of concern and potential exposure pathways 

• Summarization of environmental fate for the contaminants of concern 

• Assessment of the exposure and toxicity potential of contaminants of concern to 
selected indicator species 

• Characterization of risk 

The toxicity and environmental fate of contaminants of concern were evaluated on an 
installation-wide basis for contaminants found at or near the surface. Thirty contaminants 
of concern were identified at locations at which wildlife might be exposed. These 
contaminants of concern were identified as those contaminants that were above 
background soil levels or not naturally occurring in the environment as determined in the 
RI. The 30 contaminants of concern identified in the EA include metals, nitroaromatic 
compounds (explosives and their derivatives), and pesticides. Of these, the most 
significant in terms of volume, distribution and relative toxicity, are lead; zinc; aluminum; 
2,4,6-TNT; HMX; RDX; and tetryl 19. 

The potency of the contaminants of concern to environmental receptors (indicator species) 
was calculated based on exposure point concentrations and certain assumptions 
concermng the duration of exposure. A full discussion of these calculations and 
assumptions is provided in the EA report. 

The chronic toxicity imjwsed by the contaminants of concern was developed by 
comparing calculated daily contaminant uptake rates to NOAELs for four indicator 
species. The indicator species selected for use in these calculations were the field mouse, 
the pronghorn antelope, the American badger, and the Swainson’s hawk. 


JM.67062-45.0U4.Final FS. 11/93 1 >52 




1.0 introduction 


Daily contaminant uptake rates were calculated for the oral ingestion pathway only. 

These calculations were based on a total ingestion dose as a function of contaminant 
concentration in soil and the species ingestion rate of soil. Specific ingestion pathways 
considered include; 

• Feeding on vegetation 

• Feeding on prey in intimate contact with the soil 

• Preening 

• Burrowing 

• Direct ingestion by soil licking or eating (to obtain available salts contained in the 

soil) 

Exposure potentials for the indicator species at the ADA were determined and are 
summarized as follows: 

• Field Mouse - The field mouse has a home range that is significantly smaller than 
the areal distribution of contaminated soils at the ADA. For this reason, the field 
mouse may be directly and continuously exposed to the contaminants where its 
range is coincident with contamination. However, since many of the contaminated 
sites offer neither food nor cover, they may be less desirable as a home range for 
the field mouse. 

• Pronghorn - Present exposure potential for the pronghorn is zero at the ADA due 
to their exclusion from the area by a high fence. 

• Badger - Badgers have a large home range, estimated at several times larger than 
the areal extent of contamination. They may be occasionally exposed to acutely 
toxic doses of con taminan ts if they seek prey in the most contaminated sites of the 
ADA. Because of their large home ranges, it is suggested that chronic exposures 
would be unlikely. 

• Swainson’s hawk - The contaminated areas at UMDA represent about 10 percent 
of the overall hunting range of this hawk. The hawk is a migratory species and 
therefore only a transient resident at UMDA. In addition, preferred habitat is 
found in abundance off site. For these reasons, acute exposure potential is 
expected to be low and chronic exposure potential may be minuscule. 

The only indicator species for which potential future exposures may differ from current 
exposures described above is the pronghorn. In the event fence removal occurs at the 
ADA in the future, the introduced pronghorn would be either moved to another 
reservation or harvested. Native deer might then be exposed to the contaminated sites. 
Surface salts formed by constituent degradation might occasionally encourage soil eating 
behavior that could result in acute exposure to toxicants or intermittent chronic 

exposures.

1.0 Introduction 


Hazard quotients (HQs), represented by the ratio of the contaminant intake to the 
NOAEL, were calculated. An HQ of greater than one is indicative of the possibility of 
adverse health effects resulting from exposure to a specific contaminant. 

A summary of the risk characterization performed for the principal contaminants of 
concern at the ADA (as identified in the EA) is presented in Table 1-10. As can be seen, 
contaminants at Sites 15,19, and 31 present the greatest concern in terms of magnitude 
of worst-case HQs. In order to determine the variability in individual site HQs, median 
values of HQ were determined for selected site/contaminant/species combinations as 
shown in Table 1-10. Note that these median values are significantly less than the worst- 
case values (in fact, often the median values were 0 or close to 0) indicating that the 
worst-case values are not representative of the ADA as a wholei^.

2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


2.1 introduction 

The primary objective of this phase of the FS is to develop an appropriate range of 
technology types and process options that will protect human health and the environment 
by eliminating, reducing, and/or controlling risks posed by the contaminated media. 
These technology types and process options are then assembled into remedial alternatives 
(Section 3.0, Development of Alternatives) that are then assessed in the detailed analysis 
(Section 4.0, Detailed Analysis of Alternatives). 

Prior to the development of technology types and process options, remedial action 
objectives that specify the contaminants and media of concern, exposure pathways, and 
preliminary remediation goals were developed. The preliminary remediation goals were 
selected based on the ARARs and the Human Health Baseline Risk Assessment < 

Once the remedial action objectives were developed, the volume of contaminated soil to 
be remediated was estimated based on the results of the RI2. Using the estimated 
amount of soil to be remediated and the developed remedial action objectives, potential 
technologies and process options were identified and screened to eliminate those 
technologies that were not applicable to remediate the site. Applicable process options 
were then identified and evaluated for effectiveness, implementability, and cost This 
procedure resulted in the selection of technology types and process options to be 
incorporated into the remedial alternatives. 

The detailed description of the technology identification and screening phase is presented 
in the remaining sections following the outline provided by EPA in the Guidance for 
Conducting Remedial Investigations and Feasibility Studies under CERCLA^. 


2.2 Remedial Action Objectives 

The development of remedial action objectives is a critical step in the FS process because 
they are the basis by which technologies and process options will be evaluated. The 
development of remedial action objectives involves addressing the following: 1) 
contaminants of concern; 2) Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements 
(ARARs); 3) allowable exposures based on the risk assessment; and 4) development of 
remedial action goals. 

2.2.1 Contaminants of Concern 

Contaminants of concern at the ADA are those contaminants that were identified in the 
remedial investigation(s) and met certain criteria. The selection of contaminants of 
concern is described in detail in Section 1.2.5.1, Selection of Contaminants of Concern. 
Summaries of contaminants of concern identified for each site of the ADA (in both 
ground water and soil) are provided in Tables 1-1 and 1-2. 


JM.67062.4S.OU4.RnalFS.11/93 2-1 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


It should be noted that the presence of a contaminant of concern at a site is not necessarily 
an indication that the site v^l require remediation. Site remediation requirements will 
depend on the remedial goals that are established. These remedial goals wiU be discussed 
in Section 2.2.4, Development of Remedial Action Goals. 

The remainder of this FS primarily addresses issues relating to the remediation of soil at 
the ADA. The remediation of ground water will not be addressed for the reasons 
described in Section 1.2.5.4.3, Ground Water at the ADA. Although ground water 
remediation will not be addressed, its contribution to the total risks and hazards imposed 
by contaminated media at the ADA sites will be carried throughout the FS. 

In general, the types of contaminants of concern in ADA soils include metals, explosives, 
and other organics. Contamination of soil by metals at a wide range of concentrations 
occurs virtually at every site at the ADA. Organic contamination is less widespread and 
typically, organic concentrations are very low. 

2.2.2 Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements (ARARs) 

The selection of ARARs is dependent on the hazardous substances present at the site, the 
site characteristics and location, and the actions selected for a remedy. Consequently, 
ARARs are characterized as follows: 

• Chemical-specific 

• Location-specific 

• Action-specific 

Chemical-specific ARARs are health- or risk-based concentration limits set for specific 
hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. Location-specific ARARs address 
physical environmental conditions such as the presence of wetlands on the site or the 
location of 100-year floodplains. Action-specific ARARs control or restrict particular 
types of remedial actions as alternatives for cleanup. 

2.2.2.1 Chemical-Specific ARARs. In developing chemical-specific ARARs, both 
state and federal regulations were considered. These chemical-specific ARARs are 
summarized in Table 2-1. 

Federal ARARs - Soil 

Resource Conservation And Recovery Act (RCRA) - There are no set maximum 
allowable residual levels for contaminants in soils under federal law. RCRA addressed 
land disposal of treated hazardous wastes in its land disposal restrictions found in 40 
CFR 268. Soil and debris that are contaminated with prohibited wastes are subject to the 
land disposal restrictions and must meet the treatment standard for the contaminating

waste prior to land disposal. However, EPA realizes that certain problems are associated 
with regulating hazardous wastes in soil. Because of such problems, EPA is preparing a 
separate rule making that will establish treatability groups and treatment standards for 
contaminated soil. Until contaminated soil can be better organized into treatability 
groups, however, promulgated treatment standards for the individual or types of wastes 
would be applicable ARARs. 

Since some of the remedial options could involve ffeatment of the soil and subsequent 
land disposal, the RCRA land disposal requirements would be an applicable ARAR and 
subject Ae treatment to meeting chemical-specific treatment standards. The applicability 
of RCRA is discussed in Section 2.2.2.3, Action-Specific ARARs. 

State ARARs - Soil 

Oregon Soil Cleanup Standards - The Oregon Hazardous Substance Remedial Action 
Rules (OAR 340-122)20 provide guidance for determining contaminant cleanup levels on 
a site-specific basis. These rules have been identified as applicable for the remediation of 
contaminated soil. 

These rules state that in the event of a release of a hazardous substance, the environment 
shall be restored to: 

• Specific Numerical Soil Cleanup Levels as specified in OAR 340-122-04, if 
applicable, or 

• Background levels unless is it determined that remedial actions designed to attain 
Background Level do not meet the certain “feasibility “ requirements in which event 
the environment shall be restored to the lowest concentration level in accordance with 
OAR 340-122-090, which provides guidance for remedial action selection 

Of the general types of contaminants of concern at the ADA (metals and organics), the 
organics can be considered to be not naturally occurring. Therefore, the background 
concentration would be essentially zero or, for practical purposes, below detection limits. 
If a remedial alternative proposed in this FS cannot achieve background, a risk 
assessment approach must be used to demonstrate that the action achieves the lowest 
cleanup level that protects human health and the environment. 

2.2.2.2 Location-Specific ARARs. Location-specific ARARs set restrictions on 
remedial action activities depending upon the characteristics of a site and/or its immediate 
environs. These ARARs are contained in a number of federal statutes and regulations. In 
addition, the state of Oregon has requirements that may apply in a given situation. 


JM.67062.45.OU4.Flnal FS. 11/93 2-4 




2.0 identification and Screening of Technoiogies 


Regulations that may be considered as location-specific ARARs for UMDA are 
summarized in Table 2-2. 

In addition to the ARARs discussed in each of the following sections, consideration 
should also be given to the local planning requisites in both Morrow and Umatilla 
Counties. Oregon law mandates that each county and community develop, and have 
approved by the state, a comprehensive land use plan that must take into consideration 
many of the same concerns addressed in this discussion. Consultation with the 
appropriate county officials and cognizance of their land use plans and goals would 
increase the efficacy of any actions proposed or taken at UMDA. 

Federal ARARs 

Caves, Salt-dome Formations, Salt-bed Formations, and Underground Mines. The 
bedrock under UMDA and the surrounding area consists of basalt laid down by lava 
flows during the Miocene Period. This is capped by a mixture of Pleistocene alluvial 
deposits, including clays, sands, silts, gravels, and some boulders. There are 
sedimentary interbeds between the lava flows and this type of rock also has tunnels and 
occasional “lava holes." However, there are no indications of caves, salt-dome 
formations, salt bed formations or underground mines on the site, nor would such 
features normally be expected with a structural bedrock of basaltic lava flows. Thus no 
ARARs are identified for this category. 

Faults. UMDA is surrounded by four structural features; the Service Anticline on the 
east, an anticline on the west, the Dalles-Umatilla Syncline to the north, and a monocline 
to the south. The Service anticline runs north to south and is faulted on both its east and 
west dips. There are active Holocene faults approximately 50 to 80 miles north of the 
site, near the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington State. There is also a 
suspected active Holocene fault approximately 70 miles southeast of the depot near 
LeGrand, Oregon. However, none of the faulting associated with the Service Anticline is 
documented or believed to have been displaced during the Holocene period, nor is it 
considered active. 

Because of the history of low seismicity in the surrounding area, UMDA is exempted 
from compliance with the RCRA seismic requirements of 40 CFR 264.18. 40 CFR 
264.18(a) stipulates that all facilities located within political jurisdictions other than those 
listed in Appendix VI are assumed to be in compliance for location of new treatment, 
storage, or ^sposal (TSD) facilities. Oregon is not listed in this Appendix, thus the 
location-specific standards in 40 CFR 264.18(a) for siting a hazardous waste treatment,

2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


Wilderness Areas, Wildlife Refugees, and Scenic Rivers. There are no designated 
wilderness areas within UMDA, or in its immediate vicinity. Neither the Columbia River 
nor the Umatilla River, both of which lie within 3 miles of the depot, have been 
designated as scenic rivers. 

Wetlands and Floodplains.The Columbia River is now largely dam-controlled, thus 
eliminating most concerns with flooding hazards. Available information indicates that 
UMDA is not located within 100- or 500-year floodplains and therefore no ARARs were 
identified in this category. 

There are a number of wetlands in the immediate area of UMDA, to the east, west, and 
south. Those associated with the Umatilla River on the east come within at least 1 mile of 
the site. Additionally, the wetlands located near the northwest comer of the depot extend 
to the boundary of the UMDA. Wetlands located to the west of UMDA are associated 
with Inigon State Wildlife Refuge and those to the south are 2.5 to 3.5 miles from the 
depot. 

At the federal level, the ARARs pertinent to wetlands include Section 404 of the Clean 
Water Act (CWA) and Executive Order 11990 on Wetlands Protection. Since 
remediation activities at UMDA will not include the discharge of dredged or fill material, 
as defined in 33 CFR 323.2(d), Section 404 of the CWA is not applicable. However, a 
guiding principle of 40 CFR Part 230 is that degradation or destruction of wetlands 
should be avoided to the extent possible. Executive Order 11990 requires federal 
agencies to minimize the destruction, loss, or degradation of wetlands and preserve and 
enhance natural and beneficial values of wetlands. 

Since none of the identified wetlands are actually on the site, there would be no applicable 
ARARs specifically for on-site actions unless remedial actions have the potential to affect 
wetlands adjacent to (off-site) UMDA. 

Rare, Threatened, or Endangered Species. TTie UMDA installation is part of the critical 
winter range of both the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and the golden eagle 
(Aquila chrystaetos). The former is on the federal endangered and threatened species list 
and both are protected under the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act. The peregrine 
falcon {Falcon peregrinus), another federally endangered species, has been sighted in the 
vicinity of UMDA, and the installation is considered part of its critical habitat. One of 
three small habitats along the Columbia River where the long-billed curlew {Numenius 
Americanus) still breeds is located on the installation. The species is on the federal 
“Candidate” list No federal or state threatened or endanger^ plants have been identified 
atUMDA2i. 


JM.67062.45.OU4.FlnatFS.11/93 2-7 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


The Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973,16 USC §1531 etseq. provides a means for 
conserving various species of fish, wildlife, and plants that are threatened with 
extinction. The ESA defines an endangered species as “any species which is in danger of 
extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range." In addition, the ESA 
defines a threatened species as “any species which is likely to become an endangered 
species within the foreseeable future." Further, the ESA provides for the designation of 
critical habitats, that are “specific areas within the geographical area occupied by the 
[endangered or threatened] species... on which are found those physical or geological 
features essential to the conservation of the species." 

Section 7 of the ESA requires consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to 
determine whether the project is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any 
endangered or threatened species or result in the destmction or adverse modification of a 
critical habitat on or off the site. Since federally listed endangered and threatened species 
are associated with the UMDA installation, the ESA is an applicable ARAR and any 
action that would affect any endangered or threatened species, or adversely impact a 
species’ critical habitat, would be subject to the requirements of the ESA. 

Artifacts and Historical and Archeological Sites. There are two known historic buildings 
at UMDA, the headquarters building and the firehouse building. There are also two 
potential archeological resources at UMDA that have been tentatively identified: a portion 
of the Oregon Trail and a prehistoric site. None of the activities at the ADA sites will 
affect these locations, so there are no ARARs for this category. 

State ARARs 

Wilderness Areas, Wildlife Refuges, and Scenic Rivers. There are three wildlife refuges 
in very close proximity to the depot: Cold Spring National Wildlife Refuge at 15 miles, 
Umatilla National Wildlife Refuge at 8 miles, and Irrigon State Wildlife Refuge at 12 
miles. The latter of these refuges, Irrigon, is protected under state law and is considered 
a sensitive environment It is one of the primary wetlands in this region and supports a 
major waterfowl wintering habitat. State regulations exclude or restrict certain activities in 
this area, including activities that deter, distract, or hinder the peaceful enjoyment of the 
area. 


There would be no applicable ARARs for on-site actions because the UMDA itself is not 
located within a refuge. However, the proximity of Irrigon State Wildlife Refuge and its 
potential hydrological connection to UMDA cautions careful analysis of any actions that 
might impact that system. 


JM .67062.45.0U4.Final FS.11/93 2-8 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


Wetlands and Floodplains. Activities in a wetland involving the alteration (removal, fill, 
etc.) of 50 cubic yards or more are subject to approval of the Division of State Lands. 
Since there are no wetlands on the UMDA site, state wetlands law is not an ARAR. 

2.2^.3 Action-Specific ARARs. Action-specific ARARs are usually technology- or 
activity-based requirements or limitations on actions taken with respect to hazardous 
wastes. These requirements are triggered by the particular remedial activities that are 
selected to accomplish a remedy. Qi-site CERCIA response actions must only comply 
with the substantive requirements of regulations, and not the administrative requirements 
[CERCLA 121(e)]. In the UMDA Federal Facility Agreement, UMDA itself is defined as 
the site. Therefore, in the event that the following remedial alternatives for ADA sites are 
considered to take place on UMDA, none of the permitting requirements of RCRA, the 
Qean Air Act (CAA), etc., are considered as ARARs. The remedial actions involving 
treatment of contaminated soil under consideration for the ADA are: 1) incineration; 2) 
stabilization/solidification; and 3) soil washing. A review of potential action-specific 
ARARs relevant to these actions is provided in Table 2-3. 

Federal ARARs - Waste 

CERCLA § 121 establishes a preference for remedial actions involving treatment that 
permanently and significantly reduces the volume, toxicity, or mobility of the hazardous 
substances, pollutants, and contaminants at the site. RCRA requirements for treatment of 
hazardous wastes apply at a CERCLA site only if: the waste is a RCRA listed or 
characteristic waste; and the CERCLA activity constitutes treatment of RCRA hazardous 
waste, as defined under RCRA. 

A number of remedial alternatives would result in the RCRA regulations being considered 
as action-specific ARARs. Under 40 CFR 261.3, any solid waste derived from the 
treatment, storage, or disposal of a listed hazardous waste remains that listed waste. 

Many of the wastes deposited at the UMDA site were deposited prior to November 19, 
1980 (when RCRA was enacted), and thus were not subject to RCRA at the time of 
deposition. However, EPA asserts that RCRA requirements apply to any waste materials 
disposed of prior to 1980 when those materials are managed, treated, and/or disposed of 
in the present (55 FR 8762). A number of the contaminants of concern at UMDA are 
thus considered hazardous waste, once the process of managing, treating, and/or 
disposing of them begins. 

A variety of activities or actions commonly performed during a CERCLA cleanup action 
may be sources of air emissions. These activities include incineration and handling of 
contaminated soil (e.g., digging and relocating soil). Many of the sources of gaseous

and particulate matter emissions may be subject to federal or state regulations. In 
addition, control devices and some cleanup activities that increase the amount of 
emissions, or change the type (e.g., flares, air strippers, or excavation) may be 
considered sources subject to air emission requirements contained in the Clean Air Act 
(CAA)orRCRA. 

Soil as Hazardous Waste. Under 40 CFR 261.3, any solid waste derived from the 
treatment, storage, or disposal of a listed or characteristic hazardous waste remains that 
listed or characteristic waste. Because the varied demolition and disposal activities that 
occurred throughout the ADA may have involved hazardous wastes based on the 
characteristics of reactivity or toxicity, soils contaminated with those wastes are suspect 
as RCRA hazardous wastes. 

The RCRA characteristic for reactivity may be considered an ARAR for soil containing 
explosives or UXO, once that soil is excavated. This is based on the following 
definitions of a reactive material: it is capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it is 
subjected to a strong initiating force or if heated under confinement [40 CFR 
261.23(a)(6); or it is readily capable of detonation or explosive decomposition or reaction 
at standard temperature or pressure [40 CFR 261.23(a)(7)]. The former definition may 
apply to UXO present in the excavated soil; if so, then these UXO will be subject to 
RCRA as a characteristic reactive waste. The Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992 
states that EPA and the Department of Defense will propose regulations identifying when 
military munitions become hazardous wastes. These regulations are to be promulgated in 
1994. 

Extensive testing performed by the Army to identify the reactivity characteristics of soil 
contaminated with explosives indicated that: (a) soil containing less than 15 percent 
explosives will not react positively to induced shock; and (b) soil containing less than 12 
percent explosives will not react explosively when subjected to submerged flame 
initiation22. As a conservative guideline, the Army typically uses a total explosives 
concentration of 10 percent as a control limit for initial consideration of reactivity. 
Analyses of the soils at various ADA sites indicate an average of 0.2 percent explosives at 
sites where they are present with a maximum detected of about 4 percent. Base^ on 
reactivity, therefore, RCRA requirements are not applicable to soils contaminated with 
explosives alone. 

Since it is also possible that unused pesticides (e.g., DDE, DDT, dieldrin, and endrin) 
were disposed of at UMDA, a waste analysis for RCRA P- and U-listed wastes will have 
to be conducted. Under 40 CFR 261.30, a solid waste is a RCRA hazardous waste if it 
is listed in 40 CFR 261 Subpart D (Lists of Hazardous Wastes). If any P- or U- listed 


JM.67062.45.OU4.Final FS.11/93 2-13 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


wastes are found to be present in soils, the requirements of RCRA pertinent to these 
wastes would be an ARAR. 

Further assessment of the applicability of RCRA to contaminated soils at the ADA is 
required with respect to the toxicity characteristic because of the prevalence of heavy 
metals (including lead, cadmium, arsenic, barium, selenium, chromium, mercury, and 
silver) and 2,4-DNT at the sites. If the soil exhibits the RCRA toxicity characteristic 
based on the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) (40 CFR 261.24), then 
that soil is a RCRA hazardous waste. For example, at Site 15, TNT Sludge Burial and 
Bum Area, the TCLP was performed on soil because of the apparent likelihood that 
residues from the deactivation furnace were disposed there. Results of the TCLP 
indicated that concentrations of lead and cadmium were in excess of standards. These 
results indicate that these soils exhibit the RCRA toxicity characteristic based on TCTJP 
and are thus D006 (for cadmium) and D008 (for lead) listed hazardous wastes (40 CFR 
261.24). In addition, these wastes may be subject to the RCRA land disposal restrictions 
(LDR) as described below. 

For the piupose of further identifying the toxicity characteristics of contaminated soil at 
the ADA, it will be assumed that lead concentrations of greater than 900 pg/g will cause 
soil to exhibit the toxicity characteristic for lead. This value was identified as a result of 
tests performed in the development of the FS for the UMDA Deactivation Furnace Site 
and reported in that FS report23. Concentrations of lead in excess of 900 pg/g were 
found in ADA soils at Sites 15,17,19, and 3211. 

Because toxicity characteristics of contaminated soil were not fully developed for all of 
the potential toxic contaminants, waste analyses and TCLP will be required to fully 
determine the toxicity characteristics and the applicability of LDR to these soils. 

Land Disposal Restrictions. Hazardous waste or hazardous waste residue may be subject 
to restrictions on land disposal under 40 CFR 268. There are no maximum allowable 
residual levels for contaminants in soils under federal law. RCRA addressed land 
disposal of treated hazardous wastes in its land disposal restrictions in 40 CFR 268. 

EPA has not yet established separate treatment standards for contaminated soil, thus, it 
follows that until then, contaminated soils would have to meet the treatment standard for 
the regulated contaminating waste. However, EPA has determined that the LDRs are 
generally inappropriate or unachievable for soil and debris from a CERCLA response 
action, and recommend a treatability variance for such soils (55 FR 8760). EPA has 
published guidelines for obtaining a treatability variance for soil and contaminated debris 
with RCRA hazardous waste (OSWER Directive 9347.3-06FS, July 1989). 


JM.67062.45.OU4.FlfMll FS.11/93 2-14 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


LDRs do not apply to circumstances in which the waste is treated within a unit and thus 
would not be ARARs for actions taken within the ADA. In the event that the 
contaminated soil or treatment residue is considered for removal from the ADA for 
treatment or disposal, the LDR may apply. 

If the hazardous waste is treated so that extract from the treated material does not exceed 
the TCLP toxicity characteristic threshold for any of the constituents for which it was 
characteristic, the material would no longer be designated a hazardous waste. In terms of 
ARARs, the treated, formerly hazardous waste would now be a nonhazardous waste and 
may be disposed of on site or within a permitted solid waste facility. 

Design and Operating Reqmrements. In general, various requirements of 40 CFR Part 
264 will be applicable ARARs for remedial actions at UMDA. Any RCRA hazardous 
waste treatment unit (e.g., incinerator) must be designed and operated in accordance with 
the applicable RCRA regulations. Applicable RCRA ARARs include 40 CFR 264 
Subpart I (container storage), 40 CFR 264 Subpart N (landfills), and 40 CFR 264 
Subpart O (incinerators). In addition, any hazardous waste and hazardous waste residues 
that remain after treatment must be further treated or disposed of in accordance with 
RCRA. Any RCRA hazardous wastes shipped off site for treatment, storage, and/or 
disposal are subject to the full requirements of RCRA. 

Closure Requirements. Upon completion of treatment, storage, and disposal activity, the 
hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal units must be closed and all hazardous 
waste and hazardous waste residues removed from the site according to the applicable 
regulations of 40 CFR 264 Subpart G. 

Federal ARARs - Air 

With regard to air emissions, any technology employed in the remedial action would have 
to be designed and operated so that emissions of pollutants into the air do not exceed 
limits established in the regulations. 

Under the federal Clean Air Act National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) 
program, EPA established ceilings for certain criteria pollutants, called ambient air quality 
standards. The six criteria pollutants are lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, PM-10, carbon 
monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. EPA has established a list of all geographic areas in 
compliance with the NAAQS (attainment areas) as well as those not in compliance with 
NAAQS (nonattainment areas). UMDA is located in a geographical area designated 
attaimnent for all six criteria pollutants. Attainment areas are subject to the Prevention of 
Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations. The PSD program requires an owner or 
operator of a major new source or modification of an existing major source located in an 
attainment area to obtain a permit before construction or modification and comply with 


JM.67062.45.OlM.Final FS.11/93 2-15 



2.0 identification and Screening of Technologies 


best available control technology (BACT). The purpose of this permitting is to prevent 
significant degradation of air quality. The PSD regulations are considered to be not 
applicable to any remedial action at UMDA because emissions from such actions will not 
qualify as a major source. 

The 1990 CAA Amendments required states to develop permitting programs for major 
sources and certain othw sources regulated under the CAA. The deadline for state 
permitting programs has not bee reached yet, however, CERCLA on-site actions are not 
subject to the adminis trative procedures and permit requirements. 

Regulations under RCRA address air pollutant emissions from activities that may occur at 
UMDA (e.g., incinCTation). The regulations for hazardous waste incinerators (40 CFR 
264 Subpart O) set operating requirements for the incinerator and performance standards 
for destruction and removal efficiency for principal organic hazardous constituents 
(PHOCs). This regulation would be considered an applicable ARAR for thermal 
destruction remediation technology for the treatment of contaminated soil. Proposed 
amendments to this regulation (55 FR 17862 [April 27,1990]) establish a more stringent 
performance standard for hydrogen chloride and may constitute guidance To Be 
Considered (TBC). 

Subpart AA of 40 CFR 264 contains air pollutant emission standards for process vents, 
closed-vent systems, and control devices at hazardous waste treatment, storage, and 
disposal facilities. These regulations are applicable to equipment associated with air or 
steam stripping operations that treat substances that are RCRA hazardous wastes and that 
have a total organics concentration of 10 parts per million by weight (ppmw) or greater. 

It establishes performance standards for total organic emissions from these operations. 
These regulations will be applicable for remedial action activities at UMDA where total 
organic concentrations exceed 10 ppmw. These regulations will be not be ARARs if the 
total organic concentration is less than 10 ppmw or if the organics are from nonhazaidous 
sources. 

State ARARs • Waste 

Hazardous Waste. The Oregon Hazardous Waste Management Regulations (OAR 
Chapter 340 Divisions 100-108) reference the RCRA regulations for treatment, storage, 
and disposal, and therefore, are not repeated in this discussion. However, the closme 
requirements in Oregon are more stringent than the federal program in that they require 
the removal of all wastes, etc., at closure (the federal program gives the option of closing 
with wastes left in place). 


JM.6706245.OU4.Flnal FS.11/93 2-16 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


State ARARs - Air 

Emission Limitations. Certain sections of the Oregon Air Pollution Control Regulations 
(OAR ChaptCT 340) should be considered ARARs because the state air regulations set 
emission limits for the amounts of certain pollutants emitted into the atmosphere. 
Applicable Oregon ARARs include those requirements that limit emissions of particulate 
matter (OAR 340-21) and gaseous emissions (OAR 340-22). Remedial actions such as 
incineration have the potential to emit contaminants into the air. Any remediation 
technology would have to be chosen, designed, and operated based upon its ability to 
comply with the applicable emission standard. 

2^.2.4 Clearance of Unexploded Ordnance. As a result of ordnance disposal and 
related operations, unexploded ordnance (UXO) are present in unknown quantities and at 
unknown locations at the surface and in the subsurface at the ADA. Army regulations are 
currently being prepared to address the type and degree of UXO clearance for specific 
future land uses24. Once these regulations are promulgated, they would be considered an 
Army ARAR for remediation of the ADA. In the absence of specific regulations or 
guidance, proposed standards for clearance and associated risks have been developed. 
These standards are presented in Table 2-4. 

As shown in Table 2-4, unlimited land use, including urban development, would require 
the removal of all ordnance items to the maximum depth possible. Alternative uses such 
as livestock grazing, recreation, and agriculture would be limited use activities with less 
severe requirements for clearance. In addition, continued use of the impacted area for 
military use would most likely require only surface clearance to allow for maneuvers, 
target maintenance, and associated activities25. Since these standards are proposed only, 
for the purpose of this FS, they are designated To Be Considered (TBC). 


2.2.3 Allowable Exposures Based on Risk 

In Section 1.2.5, Baseline Risk Assessment, a summary of the Human Health Baseline 
Risk Assessment was provided. This summary includ^ the various aspects involved in 
the identification of current and future exposure pathways at the ADA, as well as the 
development of risks and hazards imposed by the contaminated media at ADA on future 
use of the area. One of the products of the ^ was a comprehensive set of risk-t^sed 
preliminary remediation goals (PRGs). These risk-based PRGs were presented in Table 
1-9 for contaminants of concern in soil at the ADA based on a number of future use 
scenarios. These PRGs represent the risk-based input to the development of remedial 
action goals.

cleared. 

Remove all ordnance 

A hazard of encountering and 
ordnance item would exist during 
excavation or construction. There 
exists little chance of an explosive 
incident caused by a deeply buried 
ordnance item from surface activity.

2.2.4 Deveiopment of Remediai Action Goais 

Potentially applicable remedial goals for the cleanup of contaminated soils at the ADA are 
presented in Table 2-5. The numerical goals presented in Table 2-5 reflect risk-based 
remedial goals as well as background concentrations. For reference, certified reporting 
limits for the individual contaminants, as reported in the RI, are included in this table. 

The ultimate goal of remedial action at the ADA is to provide a mechanism for protecting 
human health and the environment from exposure to contaminated soils and unexploded 
ordnance. Based on the previous discussions and the potentially applicable remedial goals 
presented in Table 2-5, remedial action objectives include: 

• If feasible, reduce contaminant concentrations in soil to background levels or 
certified reporting limits; or 

• Reduce the total excess cancer risk to 1x10-6 and the noncarcinogenic hazard to a 
hazard quotient of 1 for soil to which human exposure is likely; or 

• If reduction of contaminant levels to background, certified reporting limits, or 
1x10-6 total excess cancer risks is not feasible, reduce excess cancer risks to the 
lowest feasible level within the range of 1x10^ to 1x10-6 vvith the final level to be 
determined based on feasibility and cost; 

• Remove all UXO as necessary to permit remedial action; and 

• Remove UXO from the ADA to the degree necessary to minimize risks associated 
with future use. 

Numerical cleanup levels corresponding to the above objectives for each of the 
contaminants of concern in soil at the ADA are presented in Table 2-6. Risk-based 
numerical levels correspond to a future use of residential and a residual risk of 1x10-6 or 
a HQ of 1. 

Although specific remedial goals were not developed as part of the Ecological 
Assessment (EA), it is felt that the numerical cleanup levels provided in Table 2-6 are 
responsive to the findings of the EA as summarized in Section 1.2.6, Ecological 
Assessment.

2.3 General Response Actions 
2.3.1 Description 

This section describes broad categories of remedial measures, called general response 
actions, that could be used to achieve the remedial action objectives described in Section 
2.2.4, Development of Remedial Action Goals. A particular general response action 
might be able to be accomplished by any of several technology types. In turn, a 
single technology type might encompass several more specific methodologies called 
process options. For example, “treatment” would be a general response action, “thermal 
treatment” would be a technology type, and incineration or thermal desorption would be 
two examples of process options. 

The following general response actions considered alone or in combination could 
potentially achieve the remedial action objectives: 

• No Action 

• Institutional Controls 

• Containment 

• Disposal 

• Clearance of UXO 

• Treatment, In Situ; and/or 

• Treatment, Ex Situ 

The NCP requires that “No Action” be included among the general response actions 
evaluated in every FS [40 CFR 300.430(e)(6)]. No Action means that no response to 
contamination is made, activities previously initiated are abandoned, and no further active 
human intervention occurs. However, some natural attenuation of the chemically 
contaminated media (in contrast to ordnance-contaminated media) may occur over time 
through dilution, biological degradation (of organic contaminants), and abiotic 
degradation (of organic contaminants). Due to the persistence of metal contaminants, little 
or no natural attenuation of metal-contaminated soil is expected over time. The No Action 
response provides a baseline for comparison to the other remedial response actions. 

Institutional controls include measures such as site access restrictions (e.g., deed 
restrictions and/or fencing) and land use restrictions (specifying future use such as 
residential, light industrial, or military). Although potential exposure can be reduced by 
these means, the contaminated media are not directly remediated. As with the No Action 
scenario, natural recovery of organic-contaminated media might occur; however, 
recovery of metal-contaminated media is expected to be minimal or non-existent.

2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


Containment actions control or reduce migration of the contaminated materials into the 
siuTOunding environment. They might also isolate the contaminated media to reduce the 
possibility of exposiue by direct contact. These actions may involve the use of physical 
barriers to block a contaminant migration pathway. 

The clearance of UXO is a site-specific action that is to be considered for the surface and 
subsurface at the ADA. Specific activities to be involved include: surface clearance and 
subsurface surveys, and excavation of buried UXO. For the purposes of this FS, it is 
assumed that recovered UXO will be turned over to government personnel for on site 
detonation (or deactivation) and disposal. 

The treatment actions may include the use of biological, physical-chemical, or thermal 
processes to significantly reduce the toxicity, solubility, mobility, or volume of wastes. 

In some cases, treatment technologies are used to change the properties of the waste so as 
to limit the solubiliQ' or mobility of the contaminants or to prepare the waste for further 
treatment Many treatment options will generate residuals or byproducts that must be 
disposed of with or without further treatment The residuals or byproducts might or 
might not be hazardous. 

2.3.2 Estimated Areas and Volumes of Contaminated Media Requiring 
Remediation 

In order to develop estimates of areas and volumes requiring remediation with any degree 
of certainty, it is necessary to examine the chemical contamination profile of each site to 
be remediated and compare the concentrations of contaminants of concern with the 
specific remedial goals presented in Table 2-6. Many of the sites at the ADA involve 
considerable areas and the sampling performed represented a small subset of these areas. 
In addition, characterization of contamination may be limited by the depth to which 
sampling occurred. Consequently, it is important to note that these estimates are based 
on a degree of uncatainty regarding the delineation of the vertical and areal extent of 
contamination. These uncertainties are factored into the area and volume estimates by 
using a 25% uncertainty factor. 

Despite these uncertainties, it appears as though contamination is limited to surface, or 
near-surface soils. In addition, contamination does not appear to be a function of depth. 
This latter feature is likely due, in part, to sporadic grading activities that have occurred 
over the years at the ADA sites. 

In addition to the development of soil volumes requiring remediation in accordance with 
the cleanup levels provided in Table 2-6, affected areas and volumes requiring 
remediation have been calculated based on selected potential remedial goals provided in 
Table 2-5. Specifically, additional areas and volumes have been calculated for: future use 


JM.67062.4S.OU4.FlnalFS.11/g3 2-23 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


of residential with a residual risk of 1x10-6; and future use of industrid with residual 
risks of 1x10-6 and 1x10-5, Because the calculated risks associated with future use of 
military are due only to dust inhalation, only surface contamination is considered. 

To support the estimation of areas and volumes requiring remediation as described above. 
Table 2-7 is provided. This table provides the identification of sample locations (by site) 
and depths (actual depths of samples) at which particular remedial goals were exceeded in 
addition to identifying the specific contaminants. 

Since the completion of the RI, additional soil sampling and analyses have been 
performed at ADA Sites 15,17,18, and 19. The results of these additional soil 
characterizations as they affect the calculation of affected areas and volumes are provided 
in Appendix B of this report. 

Based on the information presented in Table 2-7 and the results of post-RI sampling and 
analyses, area and volume estimates were prepared. These estimates are presented in 
Table 2-8. For reference, maps illustrating the contaminated locations and area and 
volume calculation worksheets are provided in Appendix B. 


2,4 Identification and Screening of Technology Types and Process Options 

In this section, the technologies and process options associated with the general response 
actions discussed in Section 2.3, General Response Actions, are identified and described. 
These technologies and process options were subjected to a two-step screening process to 
fiiminatft inappropriate remedial options. The conduct of the screening process and its 
results are presented below. 

The screening process was initiated with a preliminary screening to assess the response 
of the identified technologies and process options to technical and regulatory 
requirements. In this stage, those technologies and process options that were determined 
to be clearly inappropriate were eliminated from further consideration. 

Those technologies and process options that survived the preliminary screening were then 
subjected to a final screening consisting of a more detailed evaluation specifically based 
on the following criteria: 

• Effectiveness 

• Implementability 

• Cost

2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


At this stage, greater emphasis was placed on effectiveness and implementability to 
identify the most promising of the technologies and process options to achieve the 
remedial goals. Cost was a secondary consideration. Only relative capital and operating 
and maintenance (O&M) costs were considered, with evaluations made largely on the 
basis of engineering judgement. Technologies and process options surviving the final 
screening are used to develop remedial alternatives that will be subjected to a detailed 
evaluation and analysis as described in Section 4.0, Detailed Analysis of Alternatives. 

2.4.1 Identification and Screening of Technologies 

The identification and screening of technologies and process options were based on a 
number of factors, including: 

• Waste characteristics 

• Site characteristics 

• Technology characteristics 

• Regulatory preferences 

2.4.1.1 Waste Characteristics. Within the ADA, soils have been found to be 
contaminated with metals and, to a much lesser extent, organics (explosives and 
pesticides). The concentrations of organics in the soils are generally very low compared 
to metal concentrations. 

Specific waste characteristics that could potentially influence the screening process 
include: 

Reactivity. Military regulations and prudence dictate that technologies considered for 
remediation mitigate the possibility of a detonation. Reactivity studies performed for 
USATHAMA22 identifi^ that a concentration of explosives in soil of 12 percent by 
weight is the minimum concentration at which detonation would occur. As a 
conservative guideline, USATHAMA has adopted a 10 percent concentration as the 
minimum at which reactivity would be a concern. Concentrations of explosives in soil at 
the ADA are well below that concentration (an average of approximately 0.2 percent at 
sites where they are present with a maximum detected of about 4 percent) in^cating that 
the contaminated soil does not present a concern on the basis of reactivity. However, 
reactivity will be addressed, as necessary, for those technologies that involve processes 
that concentrate or accumulate explosives. 

Volatility. Technologies that rely solely on the volatility of the contaminants are not 
appropriate for the removal of contaminants (metals or organics) from soil at the ADA. 

In general, the contaminants are not volatile to any appreciable degree at ambient or even 
moderately elevated temperatures. The contaminants may volatilize at temperatures 


JM.67062.45.OU4.Final FS.11/93 2-28 




2.0 identification and Screening of Technologies 


required for incineration, but at such temperatures, volatility will not be the only 
mechanism involved in their removal from the soil. 

Aqueous Phase Solubility. Technologies requiring removal of contaminants from 
soil by solubilizing them in water are not appropriate for the contaminants at the ADA. 
The contaminants (metals, explosives, and pesticides) are generally insoluble in water. 

A summary of physical and chemical properties (including vapor pressures and 
solubilities) for all contaminants of concern at UMDA is provided in Appendix A of this 
report. 

Soil Volume Requiring Remediation. The total soil volume to be remediated may 
affect the selection of the best remediation technology or process option. The volumes to 
be used in the screening and evaluation of technologies or process options were presented 
in Table 2-8. 

2.4.1.2 Site Characteristics. Site characteristics that influence the screening and 
evaluation of alternatives include: 

Location and Accessibility. UMDA is located in a rural setting. The ADA is located 
in the northwest portion of the installation and entirely enclosed by a fence. Roads are 
located adjacent to or within one-half mile of each site to be remediated. There are no 
severe space limitations imposed by structures or geophysical barriers. 

Security. UMDA is fenced and guarded 24 hours a day. In addition, the ADA is itself 
enclosed by a guarded fence with heavily controlled access. It is expected that UMDA 
will retain its status as a restricted-access military installation at least through the 1990s. 

Proximity to Potential Receptors. Military and civilian personnel assigned to 
UMDA are the only reasonable nearby receptors, at this time, because of the limited 
access and distance from civilian populations. 

Resource Availability. Electrical service is available at the ADA. The site does not 
have natural gas service. Water can be supplied from the installation hydrant system. 
However, the substantial irrigation needs of the region combined with the semi-aiid 
climate limit the acceptability of remedial action alternatives that would require large 
volumes of water. Evaporation basins have been used successfully at UMDA to dispose 
of nonhazardous ground water from sampling activities. Basins could be constracted in 
the ADA for remedial actions. 


JM.67062.4S.OU4.FlnalFS.11/93 2-29 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


Surface Conditions. The ADA is covered by grasses and low brush. Some areas of 
the individual sites at the ADA may be devoid of vegetation due to past or present 
disposal activities. 

Geology. The site geology is described in Section 1.2.2 of this report. In general, 
surficial deposits consist predominantly of fine- to medium-grained sands, silty sands, 
and some gravels. The hydraulic conductivity of the soil falls within a range of 10-2 to 
10-4 cm/sec. Depth to ground water varies across the ADA. Apparent depths range from 
about 50 to 100 feet; fluctuations of 1 to 2 feet may be observed due to seasonal 
variations in precipitation. 

Unexploded Ordnance. Past activities at the ADA have resulted in the presence of 
surface and subsurface unexploded ordnance (UXO). This feature has a significant 
impact on the screening and evaluation of alternatives due to the inherent safety concerns 
associated with future land use and treatment alternatives. 

2.4.1.3 Technology Characteristics. General technology characteristics that 
contribute to technology screening and evaluation include: 

In Situ versus Ex Situ Treatment. For soil remediation, in situ treatment provides 
the advantage of implementing the technology without having to excavate the soil, 
thereby reducing potential for exposure as well as, in some instances, reducing costs. 
However, in situ technologies are limited by the need to be able to perform the treatment 
uniformly throughout the soil and, equally important, to provide evidence of 
completeness and permanence of the remediation. For most in situ technologies, 
effectiveness is very dependent on site-specific features such as geology, hydrology, soil 
characteristics, and contaminant characteristics. In situ treatment may not be appropriate 
for ADA soils that contain UXO. 

On-site versus Off-site Treatment. The NCP specifies a preference for on-site 
remedies as opposed to off-site remedies. On-site remediation should eliminate the need 
to apply for and obtain local, state, and federal permits, although it does not preclude 
meeting the substantive requirements of the permit regulations. Other advantages of on¬ 
site remediation include: 

• The waste generator retains greater control of the waste and residues. 

• Costs of transportation are minimized. 

• Potential for spread of contamination and exposure are reduced. 

Costs of on-site treatment may be less than off-site treatment, particularly if there is a 
sufficient waste volume. In cases where the volume of waste to be treated is small, 


JM.67062.45.0U4.Final FS.11/93 2-30 




2.0 identification and Screening of Technologies 


on-site treatment costs may be higher than off-site because of the costs required to 
mobilize a treatment system on site. 

Off-site treatment and disposal relieves the waste generator of the responsibility for 
meeting the substantive requirements for waste treatment and disposal facilities provided 
a properly permitted facility is chosen. However, the generator retains future liability for 
those wastes treated off site. This liability extends to treatment residuals, although the 
generator has little control over the management or disposition of the residuals. 

An additional disadvantage of off-site treatment over on-site treatment is the increase in 
short-term risks due to the increased potential for public exposure and environmental 
damage in the event of spills or mishaps during transportation of the waste off site. 

2.4.2 Evaluation of Technologies and Selection of Representative 
Technologies 

The general response actions introduced in Section 2.2, Remedial Action Objectives, and 
potentially applicable technologies and process options are presented in Figure 2-1. The 
results of the preliminary screening are shown in the figure by shading those technologies 
and process options that are clearly not applicable to remediation of the ADA soils. The 
rationale supporting the elimination of these technologies and process options is 
summarized in the column on the right. 

Technologies and process options were initially screened by assessing whether or not 
they were conceptually viable with respect to technical capabilities and the screening 
criteria presented in Section 2.4.1, Identification and Screening of Technologies. A brief 
discussion of the important parameters and rationale behind particular screening decisions 
is provided below. 

It is important to note that the technologies and process options surviving the preliminary 
screening (as well as the final screening) will be incoiporated into remedial alternatives 
that will then be subjected to a detailed analysis. These remedial alternatives may consist 
of a single technology or process option or may include a series of the retained options. 

2.4.2 .1 Preliminary Screening. 

No Action. The No Action alternative does not reduce human exposme or con taminan t 
toxicity, mobility, or volume. However, as required by the NCP, it will be carried 
through subsequent screening and analysis as a viable option where appropriate to 
provide a baseline reference point for review and comparison of various alternatives. 

This alternative is independent of the contaminant/soil matrix considered.

2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


Institutional Controls. The placement of institutional controls such as access 
restrictions and/or land use restrictions on the future use of the ADA is a means of 
minimizing or preventing human exposure to contaminants. However, such restrictions 
do not reduce the toxicity, mobility, or volume of contaminants. 

The use of access restrictions such as the imposition of deed restrictions or fencing will 
limit future use possibilities for the site. Despite this limitation, there are two issues that 
impact the decision to carry access restrictions to the next stage of evaluation. These are: 

• The absence of future use plans for UMDA in general and the ADA specifically 

• The presence of UXO at the ADA is likely to have a significant impact on future 
use considerations 

Land use restrictions constitute an additional aspect to institutional controls. The options 
under consideration include: 

• Restriction of future property use to residential only with no agricultural use 
permitted 

• Restriction of future property use to light industrial only 

• Restriction of future property use to military 

Because of the uncertainties associated with future use scenarios at this time, as well as 
the potential impact of UXO on future use, all institutional control options will be carried 
over into the next phase of the evaluation. 

The use of institutional controls is independent of the contaminant/soil matrix considered. 

UXO Clearance. Some clearance of UXO fi'om the ADA will be needed to conduct 

# 

remedial actions and also if more intensive land use than exists now is desired. UXO 
clearance is technically feasible and has been demonstrated effective25. UXO clearance 
levels considered for the ADA include surface clearance and subsurface clearance at 
depths of 1,5, and 20 feet Specific clearance requirements are tied closely to any 
institutional controls that may be applied at the ADA regarding future use and, therefore, 
all clearance options are retained for further consideration. 

Containment. Waste containment technologies are generally intended to minimize 
exposure to contaminated soil and/or to reduce the mobility of contaminants to prevent 
their migration. The toxicity or volume of the contaminants is not reduced. Containment 
options considered include the use of surface controls such as a clean soil cover and/or 
vegetation as well as capping the site with an engineered cap. 


JM.67062.45.OU4.Flnal FS.11/93 2*35 






2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


Surface controls are relatively inexpensive and low-technology approaches to 
containment Such controls include: applying a clean soil layer over the contaminated soil 
and/or planting vegetation over the contaminated area. Due to the arid and exposed 
conditions at UMDA, a clean soil layer alone would provide an expedient, but short-term 
means of containment due to wind erosion. For this reason, use of a clean soil cover 
alone is eliminated from further consideration. Covering the clean soil with vegetation 
would decrease the potential for erosion due to wind by increasing the stability of the 
surface environment. A combination of clean soil cover and revegetation is retained for 
further consideration as a potentially effective means of controlling the wind dispersion of 
contaminants. 

In many cases, vegetation alone would adequately decrease the potential for wind 
dispersion of surface contaminants. However, the native vegetation of UMDA is sparse 
and not well-suited for erosion control. For this reason, vegetation as the sole means of 
surface control is eliminated from further consideration. 

A higher-technology approach to containment is offered by the use of engineered caps 
over the contaminated soils. Engineered caps may be constructed from a variety of 
materials, including asphalt, concrete, clays, sands, and soils. These caps may consist of 
a single layer or may be composed of multiple layers. Single layer caps will generally 
require continuous and long-term monitoring to ensure that their integrity is retained. 
Multiple layer caps are more desirable for uses requiring long-term protection of human 
health and the environment. For the purposes of longevity of cover and insurance of 
long-term maximum protection, a multiple layer cap consisting of a clay layer covered by 
clean soil will be retained for further evaluation. 

On-Site Disposal. The use of on-site disposal of contaminated soil and/or treatment 
residues may be accomplished using the existing active landfill or, alternatively, by 
constmcting a new engineered landfrll on site for the specific purpose of disposal of these 
mafffriak The toxicity or volume of the contaminants is not reduced by implementation 
of these options; however, they may allow for greater control of the potential spread of 
contamination than if the contaminated soil were to be left in place. 

Consideration of the use of on site disposal for the contaminated soil is impacted by LDR 
prohibiting the disposal of soil exhibiting the characteristic of toxicity. As described in 
Section 2.2.2.3.1, Soil as Hazardous Waste, ADA soils containing the metals cadmium 
and lead potentially exhibit the toxicity characteristic and, as such, land disposal of these 
contaminated soils (without treatment) may be prohibited. A review of contamination 
data developed in the RI indicates that the toxicity characteristic may be exhibited by over 
half of the total contaminated soil volume at the ADA due to the presence of lead. The use 
of on-site disposal for contaminated soils would be limited to those soils that do not 


JM.67062.45.OU4.Final FS.11/93 2-36 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


exhibit any hazardous characteristic and would require extensive testing to ensure that the 
soils to be placed on site are not hazardous. On-site disposal in either the existing active 
landfill or in a new engineered landfill is retained for consideration for the disposal of 
proven nonhazardous soils only. 

If it can be shown that the contaminated soil that exhibits the hazardous characteristic can 
be treated so that it no longer exhibits that characteristic, then that treated material is no 
longer subject to LDR and can be landfilled. Use of on-site landfills (either the existing 
landfill or a new landfill) for the disposal of residuals resulting from the treatment of 
contaminated soil is retained for further consideration because of the technical feasibility 
of on-site disposal and its potential to reduce exposure and migration of contamination. 

In Situ Treatment. In situ options considered include treatment by biological, 
physical-chemical, and thermal methods. 

Biological In Situ Treatment. The use of aerobic or anaerobic microorganisms to 
degrade contaminants in soil is a potentially effective method for reducing the toxicity and 
mobility of organic compounds in soil. However, the use of microorganisms in situ has 
not been demonstrated to affect the mobility or toxicity of metals. Another in situ or ex 
situ method may then be needed to address the metals. Since the contaminated soils at the 
ADA contain metals, this option has been dropped from further consideration for all three 
contaminant/soil matrices. 

Physical-Chemical In Situ Treatment. Physical-chemical treatment techniques that may 
be employed in situ include: 

• Soil washing, in which contaminants are leached from the soil with a water and 
detergent solution. This technique has been proven to a greater extent with soil 
that has been excavated. Because the containination at this site is relatively 
shallow (less than 15 feet below the surface) and relatively easy to excavate, there 
is no particular advantage to the use of the processes in situ. In situ applications 
of soil washing are therefore eliminated from further consideration. 

• Solidification/stabilization, involving the mixing of specialized additives or 
reagents with contaminated soil to physically or chemically reduce the solubility or 
mobility of contaminants in the soil. Stabilization typically refers to techniques 
that chemically modify the contaminant to form a less soluble, mobile, or toxic 
form without necessarily changing the physical characteristics of the waste. 
Solidification refers to a technique for changing the physical form of the waste to 
produce a solid structure in which the contaminant is mechanically trapped. Many 
stabilization and solidification processes overlap and therefore are often described 


JM.6706245.OU4.Final FS.11/93 2-37 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


as one technology. Although these processes have reportedly been demonstrated 
with a variety of contaminants (primarily metals), their long-term effectiveness 
and pe rman ence is unknown. The technology has been proven to a greater extent 
with soil that has been excavated. Because the contamination at this site is 
relatively shallow (less than 15 feet below the surface), there is no particular 
advantage to the use of the processes in situ. In situ applications of 
solidification/stabilization are therefore eliminated from further consideration. 

• Vacuum extraction, in which the soil is placed under vacuum to enhance the 

volatilization of contaminants from the soil. Since the contaminants of concam at 
the ADA are nonvolatile, this alternative is dropped from further consideration for 
all three contaminant/soil matrices. 

Thermal In Situ Treatment. Two thermal techniques for in situ soil remediation are radio 
frequency heating and thermal stripping. Both of these techniques involve heating soil, 
thereby enhancing volatilization of contaminants for their removal from the soil. Since 
the success of these methods depends on the volatilization of the contaminants, they are 
clearly not appropriate for the nonvolatile contaminants at the ADA. Thermal in situ 
treatment relying on the volatilization of contaminants is therefore eliminated from further 
consideration for all three contaminanl/soil matrices. 

A third thermal technique that can be employed in situ is vitrification, a method whereby 
contaminants are immobilized in place tlu-ough encapsulation in glassified soil. This 
technique typically involves the addition of chemicals to contaminated soil followed by 
the application of electrical energy to produce a solidified (glassified) soil. This 
technology has not been successfully demonstrated on a large scale and has not been 
demonstrated on any scale with explosives. In addition, the success of in situ 
vitrification relies on the assurance that the vitrified mass is continuous throughout the 
contaminated site, thereby eliminating the potential for future leaching or movement of 
contaminants from the site. This ability has not yet been demonstrated. Because of 
insufficient demonstration of the effectiveness of vitrification as well as uncertainties 
about its permanence, this technology is eliminated from further consideration for all 
contaminant/soil matrices at the ADA. 

Ex Situ Treatment. In ex situ treatment, contaminated soil is excavated from the site 
and subjected to treatment on site or off site. Options for treatment include processes 
employing biological, physical-chemical, or thermal methods. 

Biological Ex Situ Treatment. Potential technologies employing biological processes to 
treat contaminated soil ex situ include slurry-phase treatment and composting. 


JM.67062,45.OU4.Final FS.11/93 2-38 



2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


• Slurry-phase treatment involves diluting the contaminated soil with water and 
feeding the resulting slurry to a system containing bacteria. Although slurry 
phase treatment was considered conceptually viable in a 1990 evaluation (for 
organic contamination), effectiveness has not yet been demonstrated26. This 
technology is therefore eliminated from further consideration for contaminated soil 
remediation at the ADA. 

• Composting is an innovative method for the treatment of soils contaminated with 
organic compounds, including explosives. Composting is commonly used for 
treating sewage sludge, muiucipal solid wastes, and yard wastes. Recently it has 
been examined for use in remedial actions involving the treatment of contaminated 
soil. In order to achieve composting conditions, contaminated soils must be 
altered to produce a compostable matrix. Usually this is accomplished by adding 
an amendment mixture to the contaminated soil. This amendment mixture 
typically consists of a bulking agent to improve the physical characteristics of the 
soil and a carbon and nitrogen source for ensuring the sustenance of active 
microbial populations. The reliance on amendments is a potential disadvantage to 
composting due to the increase in volume (as much as 200%) of the contaminated 
media. 

Composting has been demonstrated for site-specific applications involving the 
treatment of soil contaminated with explosives. Treatability studies have shown 
that it can effectively reduce contaminant concentrations and soil toxicity by 
greater than 90 percent 27.28, 

The effect of composting on metal-contaminated soil has not been determined. 
Although it is suspected that composting may result in immobilization of the 
metals, it has not been demonstrated or proven on any scale29. There is the 
potential that the levels of metals in the ADA soils may prove toxic to biological 
activity. All of the identified contaminated soil at the ADA contains metals at 
significantly higher concentrations and greater frequency than explosives or other 
organics. The use of composting as a pretreatment to remove organic 
contaminants prior to subsequent treatment to remove metals is not practical due to 
the significant increase in volume resulting from the addition of soil amendments. 
For these reasons, the feasibility of using composting to treat these soils is 
questionable and thus will not be considered further in this analysis. 

Physical-Chemical Ex Situ Treatment. Physical-chemical techniques that can be 

employed to treat excavated soil include sohdification/stabilization and soil washing. 


JM.67062.45.0U4.FinalFS.11/93 2-39 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


• Solidification/stabilization involves the mixing of specialized additives or reagents 
with con taminat ed soil to physically or chemically reduce the solubility or mobility of 
co ntaminan ts in the soil. Stabilization typically refers to techniques that chemically 
modify the contaminant to form a less soluble, mobile, or toxic form without 
necessarily changing the physical characteristics of the waste. Solidification refers to 
a technique for changing the physical form of the waste to produce a solid structure 
in which the contaminant is mechanically trapped. Many stabilization and 
solidification processes overlap and therefore are often described as one technology. 
These techniques have been demonstrated to be implementable to treat soil 
contaminated with metals and therefore have potential application as a remedial 
alternative for soils at the ADA. The effect of solidification/stabilization on organics 
has not been as well demonstrated. In some cases, organics may even negatively 
impact the quality of the treated product. Treatability studies would be required to 
determine the effect of any organics on the treated matrix as well as to demonstrate 
the feasibility of the process on ADA soils in general and develop optimum operating 
parameters. Despite the uncertainties with respect to organic contamination, it should 
be noted that the level and frequency of organic contamination at the ADA is very 
low compared to metal contamination. Because of the potential for immobilization of 
metal (and perhaps organic) contaminants at the ADA, solidification/stabilization is 
retained in this evaluation for further consideration. 

• Soil washing involves the removal of contaminants from soil by chemical and/or 
physical means. It is typically employed as one of a series of unit operations. Soil 
washing results in the transfer of contaminants from one medium (soil) to another 
Oiquid), thereby requiring additional treatment Specific processes involved in soil 
washing include; 

- Physical separation of contaminated particles by washing with water, agitation, 
and particle classification. When used on contaminated soil, this process makes 
use of the tendency of contaminants to concentrate in the finer particles (or fines) 
of soil leaving the larger particles relatively contaminant-free. Ideally, separation 
of the two ranges of particle sizes then allows for a significant reduction in soil 
volume to be treated. 

- Solvent extraction using an appropriate solvent to solubilize the contaminants, 
which are then removed from the soil with the solvent. 

- Acid extraction making use of the solubility of metals in acid to remove them 
from soil. An acidic aqueous solution is added to the excavated soil, the metals 
are dissolved into the solution, and the metal-laden solution is separated fi'om the 
soil and subjected to further treatment 


JM.67062>i5.OU4.Final FS.11/93 2-40 



2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


The soil washing processes described above may be used alone or in combination 
depending on the contaminant(s) to be removed from soil. 

Soil washing using water to physically remove contaminants from soil has been 
demonstrated effective in specific applications 30,3i, Application of the technology 
has the potential to substantially reduce the volume of contaminated soil requiring 
further treatment or disposal. The soil washing technology is reportedly moderately 
to marginally effective for the removal of pesticides from soil. In addition, bench- 
scale studies conducted by USATHAMA indicate that removal efficiencies of 
explosive compounds are generally poor 32 

Solvent extraction has been demonstrated on a laboratory scale to be an effective 
means of removing explosives and pesticides contaminants from soil33,34. Solvent 
extraction is not applicable to metals in soil. A study conducted by USATHAMA 
used acetone to remove explosives from soil, since all of the explosives of interest 
were either soluble or easily dispersed in acetone at room temperature32. Initial 
concentrations of explosives in the soil ranged from 1,200 jig/g to 420,000 Hg/g. 
Final concentrations were 6 to 17 |ig/g, for an extraction efficiency of greater than 
99.5 percent. 

The limitations of solvent extraction arise upon consideration of the fate of the 
extract. In the study referenced above, the acetone was recovered by boiling off the 
liquid, leaving a small amount of acetone with the explosives to maintain them in a 
wet state and reduce the potential for detonation. While this reduces the volume of 
contaminated media, it is not a final treatment The study concluded by indicating 
that the acetone/explosives mixture could then be incinerated. However, the 
production of a concentrated explosives moisture, particularly entrained in a 
flammable solvent is generally unacceptable because of the stringent requirements 
imposed on facilities that process detonatable concentrations. In addition, it is 
unlikely that a commercial incinerator would be willing to accept a potentially 
explosive mixture. 

Acid extraction has been used in the metallurgical industry for the extraction of 
metals from various media to allow for their recovery 35. The major problem with 
this technology is the generation of large quantities of acid waters contaminated with 
metal compounds. There is no apparent application of acid extraction for the removal 
of explosives or pesticides. 

Both solvent and acid extraction can be complex procedures employing a number of 
unit processes. They rely on the transfer of contaminants from one medium (soil) to 


JM.67062.45.0U4.Final FS.11/93 2-41 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


another (solvent or acid) thereby generating another waste stream requiring 
treatment In addition, safety considerations associated with the storage of large 
quantities of acids and solvents (such as acetone) required for the processes are 
significant. 

Soil washing using aqueous solutions to physically separate contaminants and fines 
fiom soil is retained for furthCT evaluation due to its potential to reduce the volume of 
contaminated soil requiring further treatment or disposal. Solvent and acid extraction 
are eliminated from further consid^tion for a number of reasons including their 
reliance on large volumes of acids and solvents and the generation of acid and 
solvent waste streams that require subsequent treatment. 

Thermal Ex Situ Treatment. Alternatives considered for the thermal treatment of 

excavated soil include glassification, incineration, and thermal stripping. 

• Glassification makes use of well-established technology for the melting of glass. 
Glassification involves high temperature (typically 2200°F) treatment of contaminated 
solids for the purpose of destroying organic contaminants and immobilizing metals 
(and most other inorganics) contaminants in a glass residual product form. Orgamc 
components of wastes are thermally oxidized. Offgases are vented through a 
scrabber. Ash containing inorganic components is entrapped in the glass. The 
technology has been shown to be effective with a variety of organic compounds and 
metals36. Glassification has not been demonstrated for use with explosives; 
however, extrapolation of results of incineration of explosive-contaminated soil at 
temperatures of 1500 to 1800°F indicate that explosives would most likely be 
successfully oxidized at glassification temperatures 3^. Glassification is retained for 
further consideration based on its potential to successfully treat all contaminant/soil 
matrices. 

• Incineration involves the oxidation of organic compounds at high temperatures. 
Incineration has been widely demonstrated as an effective means of remediating 
organic-contaminated soils including explosives and pesticides. Metals in the 
incinerator feed may either be contained in the incinerator offgas and subsequently 
separated from the offgas in air pollution control equipment or may be retained in the 
incinerator ash residue. Because of the demonstrated applicability of incineration for 
soil containing organic contaminants, it is retained for further evaluation. 

• Thermal stripping involves heating soil at low temperatures thereby enhancing 
volatilization of contaminants for their removal from the soil. Since the success of 
thermal stripping depends on the volatilization of the contaminants at low 




2.0 identification and Screening of Technoiogies 


tempCTatures, it is clearly not appropriate for the nonvolatile contaminants at the 
ADA. Thermal stripping is therefore eliminated from further consideration. 

Off-Site Treatment and/or Disposal. Although the NCP specifies a preference for 
on-site remedies, there are certain circumstances in which off-site treatment and/or 
disposal may be preferable; particularly for smaller waste volumes. The potential for 
some of the ADA soils to exhibit the toxicity characteristic due to the presence of lead 
(and cadmium), would require that implementation of this option involve the segregation 
of soils according to their toxicity characteristic. Soil exhibiting the toxicity characteristic 
would require treatment prior to disposal. Other soils could be disposed of as non- 
hazardous wastes. 

Because of the potential for off-site treatment and/or disposal to be easily implemented 
and cost effective, this alternative is retained for further consideration for the 
contaminated soils at the ADA. 

2.4.2.2 Final Screening of Technologies. General response actions, technologies and 
process options remaining after the final screening are presented in Figure 2-2. These 
technologies and process options have been evaluated in greater detail below according to 
the criteria of effectiveness, implementability, and cost. Brief descriptions of each of 
these criteria are presented below. 

The effectiveness of the process options was evaluated based on: 

• The potential effectiveness of the process option in handling the estimated areas or 
volumes of media and meeting the remedial action objectives 

• The potential impacts to human health and the environment during the construction 
and implementation phase 

• The degree to which the process is proven and reliable with respect to the 
contaminants and conditions at the site 

The implementability of the process option encompasses both the technical and 
administrative feasibility of implementing the option. Technical implementability was the 
major criterion used for screening the process options in the preliminary screening to 
eliminate those that were clearly not applicable to the contaminants or the contaminated 
media. This final screening places greater emphasis on the institutional aspects of 
implementability, including the ability to obtain necessary permits for off-site actions; the 
availability of treatment, storage, and disposal services; and the availability of skilled 
workers to implement the technology. 


JM.67062.45.OU4.FinaI FS.11/93 2-43 











Eliminated from furtliCT consideration 





















2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


The cost evaluation plays a limited role in the screening of process options. The costs that 
are developed are relative in nature and not detailed. These costs are usually developed 
based on engineering judgment, and each process is evaluated as to whether costs are 
high, medium, or low with respect to the other process options. 

2.422.1 No Action. The No Action response action involves no technology, requires 
no implementation, is not effective in reducing toxicity, mobility, or volume of the waste, 
and incurs no direct cost. The presence of metal contaminants in the soil is expected to be 
persistent; little or no natural recovery will occur. Some natural degradation of organics 
might occur, however the rate of recovery is expected to be slow. Since the metals are by 
far the predominant contaminants at the ADA, the natural degradation of the organic 
contaminants will have little effect on the risks and hazards associated with the site. The 
No Action alternative is included as a requirement of the NCP and provides a baseline for 
comparison with the other technologies. 

2.4.2.22 Institutional Controls. Access restrictions and land use restrictions have been 
carried forward to this stage of screening. 

• Effectiveness. Although institutional controls alone provide a certain degree of 
effectiveness with respect to protecting human health by reducing the potential for 
exposure, they do nothing to reduce the toxicity, mobility, or volume of 
contaminants; therefore, they offer little improvement in protecting the environment 
over the long term. The imposition of these alternatives may limit future use 
possibilities for the site. 

• Implementability. Institutional controls such as access restrictions and land use 
restrictions are easily implemented. The site is currently subjected to access 
restrictions and control. 

• Cost. Despite the fact that the institutional controls themselves will be of minimal 
cost to implement, there will be costs incurred with the long-term maintenance of the 
controls as well as loss of the cost benefit possibly resulting with the sale of the site 
by the Army. 

• Summary. Institutional controls alone will not satisfy the statutory preferences for 
remedies that "utilize permanent solutions." However, due to the presence of UXO 
at the ADA, the application of institutional controls will be required unless complete 
surface and subsurface clearance of UXO is conducted. However, the cost of such 
complete clearance may be prohibitive, thereby requiring the implementation of some 
degree of institutional control to provide for adequate protection of human health and 
environment. The use of institutional controls at the ADA is therefore retained for 


JM.67062.45.OU4.Flnal FS.11/93 2-46 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


further consideration, with the acknowledgement that the requirements for control 
may be dictated by the feasibility and cost of UXO clearance. 

2.4.22.3 UXO Clearance. This phase of the screening will consider surface clearance 
of UXO as well as subsurface clearance to various depths (1 foot, 5 feet, and 20 feet). It 
is recognized that for any intended future use of the ADA (residential, light industrial, or 
military) that is different from the current use, some degree of clearance will be required. 
Qearance of metallic items from the surface (including UXO) is performed by visual 
inspection of the entire surface. The first phase of subsurface clearance involves a 
subsurface survey, a survey usually conducted with hand-held magnetometers (metal 
detectors) passed over the surface to detect subsurface items. When a subsurface item is 
located, it is excavated by hand or flagged for excavation after the survey is completed. 
Cbmplete clearance (at depths greater than 10 feet, for example) must be performed by a 
combination of survey and complete excavation. 

• Effectiveness. The effectiveness of UXO clearance has been proven. Because it is 
based on visual inspection, surface clearance provides the best degree of certainty of 
complete effectiveness. Subsurface clearance is complicated by the need for 
subsurface detection and therefore the certainty of complete effectiveness is reduced. 
Clearance to depths as great as 20 feet provides an effective means of UXO removal 
due to the complete excavation of the subsurface soil and separation of metallic items 
including UXO from the soil. 

• Implementability. Clearance of UXO firom the surface and to depths of 5 feet is 
relatively easily implemented. Clearance is labor-intensive and special precautions 
and training are necessary to ensure that it can be performed safely. For this reason, 
there are a number of firms that specialize in ordnance detection, removal, and 
destruction. Deep subsurface clearance (to 20 feet) involves excavation, which itself 
is easily implemented; however, excavation of the entire 1,750 acres of the ADA to a 
depth of 20 feet for the removal of UXO can not be considered easily implemented. 

• Cost. Costs for UXO clearance are extremely variable depending on site conditions 
and the surface and subsurface density of metallic items (including UXO). Reported 
costs cover a wide range from vendor to vendor. Based on figures and factors 
provided by UXO clearance vendors, estimated costs have been calculated. Surface 
clearance costs are estimated at approximately $5(X) per acre. Costs for subsiuface 
clearance to 1 foot and 5 feet are estimated at $3,(XX) per acre and $6,3(X) p)er acre, 
respectively. The costs of clearance to 20 feet across the entire ADA would be 
prohibitive at approximately $500,000 per acre^s. 


JM.67062.45.OU4.FinaIFS.11/03 2-47 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


• S ummar y. Some degree of clearance of UXO from the ADA will be required by 
Army regulation fcff any intended future use (including any soil excavation necessary 
for remediation) that differs from current use. The degree to which UXO are cleared 
will dictate requirements for land use or access restrictions. Clearance of UXO to a 
depth of 5 feet is feasible although costly. UXO clearance achieves part of the 
remedial objectives for the ADA. Complete clearance of UXO to a depth of 20 feet 
across the entire ADA is prohibitively expensive. For this reason, clearance to that 
depth should be considered only for selected sites if there is the potential for 
construction at those sites and appropriate land use and access restrictions should be 
applied elsewhere. Clearance of UXO from the surface and to depths of 5 feet for 
the entire ADA area is retained for further analysis. In addition, UXO clearance will 
be considered when necessary to allow for remedial actions involving excavation ot 
handling of soil. Because of the costs associated with clearance to 20 feet, this 
option is retained for reference only. 

2.42.2.4 Containment - Engineered Cap. Covaing areas of contamination using an 
engineered cap is a technically feasible remedial option under the containment general 
response action. An engineered cap employed at the ADA would consist of a layer of clay 
covered by a layer of soil which would allow for revegetation to provide an additional 
level of surface stability and protection. 

• Effectiveness. Capping is effective at limiting infiltration due to rainfall, providing a 
barrier that minimiz es the potential for contact and exposure, and providing stability 
to the contaminated surface to limit the potential for wind dispersion of contaminants. 
Use of a multiple layer cap such as a clay/soil cap provides long-term assurance that 
the co ntaminat ed surface is stable and contained. Capping does not decrease the 
toxicity or volume of the contaminants. 

• Implementability. From a technical standpoint, capping could be easily implemented 
at Ae areas of contamination. Equipment required for capping is readily available. 
The use of a cap would require maintenance and monitoring to ensure long-term 
integrity of the cap. Land use restrictions would be required. 

• Cost. The cost to install an engineered cap using layers of clay and soil and planting 
vegetation would cost approximately $0.60 per square foot of area to be covered. 

• Summary. The use of an engineered cap with vegetation would provide adequate 
protection of human health and the environment provided that the cap is maintained 
and monitored over the long term and some degree of future land use restrictions are 
applied. The cost of installing such a cap would not be prohibitive. A cap, 
however, does not provide for the reduction of volume of contaminated materials or 


JM.67062.45.OU4.Final FS.11/93 2-48 



2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


does not reduce the toxicity of the contaminants. Given the possibility that future 
land use restrictions will be applied at the ADA, the use of an engineered cap with 
vegetation is retained for furdier analysis. 

2.4225 Containment - Soil Cover/Vegetation. Covering areas of contamination with 
a layer of clean soil and vegetation is a second feasible containment option. It is assumed 
that suitable soil cover material would be obtained from uncontaminated areas at UMDA. 

• Effectiveness. A soil cover is less effective than an engineered cap at limiting 
infiltration. However, since potential evapotranspiration rates in the region (32 
inches per year) exceed precipitation rates (8 to 9 inches per year), a cover of clean 
soil would possibly reduce the amount of precipitation reaching underlying 
contaminated soil. A clean soil cover would also reduce the potential for direct 
contact with contaminated soil, both by humans and by the root systems of plants. 
The effectiveness of the soil cover in stabilizing the contaminated surface and 
preventing wind dispersion of contaminants would be enhanced by the use of 
vegetation. The use of a soil cover with vegetation would not reduce the toxicity or 
volume of contaminants. 

• Implementability. Placing a soil cover over areas of contamination would be 
relatively simple. There are several areas of undisturbed, uncontaminated soil on the 
UMDA installation from which materials could be obtained. Equipment used to 
install the soil cover is standard and readily available. As with an engineered cap, 
the use of a soil cover would require maintenance and monitoring to ensure long¬ 
term integrity of the cover. Land use restrictions would be required. 

• Cost Installation of a soil cover and vegetation would cost approximately $ 0.20 per 
square foot of area to be covered. 

• Summary. The use of a soil cover with vegetation would provide a catain degree of 
protection of human health and the environment provided that the cover is maintained 
and monitored over the long term and future land use restrictions are applied. The 
cost of installing such a cover would be low. A soil cover, however, does not 
provide for the reduction of volume of contaminated materials or does not reduce the 
toxicity of the contaminants. Given the possibility that future land use restrictions 
will be applied at the ADA, the use of a soil cover with vegetation is retained for 
further analysis. 

2.422.6 On-Site Disposal. On-site disposal options to be considered in this phase of 
the screening include the disposal of nonhazardous contaminated soil and/or 


JM.67062.45.OU4.Final FS.11/93 2-49 





2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


nonhaTaidous solid treatment residuals. Disposal would be in either the existing UMDA 
active landfill or in a new engineered landfill to be constmcted on site. 

• Effectiveness. The primary benefit of relocation of the nonhazardous contaminated 
soils to an on-site landfill would be the increased control over the soils to minimize 
the potential for exposure and release to the environment Landfilhng of the 
contaminated soils that exhibit hazardous characteristics would not be possible 
without treatment to eliminate the hazardous characteristic. Once it is proven that the 
hazardous soils are rendered nonhazardous, then landfilling the treatment residuals 
provides an effective means of controlling exposure to and release of the residuals. 

• In^lementability. Disposal of nonhazardous materials in the on-site active landfill is 
easily implemented. Disposal of soil that is hazardous is complicated by the need to 
treat the soil prior to disposal. 

• Cost. On-site disposal by utilizing the active landfill is a relatively low cost 
alternative with costs reflecting the excavation, hauling, dumping, and covering of 
the nonhazardous material is estimated at approximately $7 per cubic yard. This cost 
includes only the disposal costs; it does not include soil treatment costs which are 
considered in treatment-specific options or final closure costs, in accordance with the 
requirements of its permit and ODEQ solid waste regulations and guidance, which 
are included in the active landfill closure. 

• Summary. The on-site disposal of contaminated soils and/or treatment residues will 
be subject to regulatory and Army approval. In general, however, on-site disposal is 
a feasible and potentially low cost option for disposition of the contaminated soils 
and/or treatment residues at the ADA. Because of the feasibility and potential low 
cost of on-site disposal, this option will be retained for further analysis. 

2.422.7 Ex Situ Treatment-SolidificationlStabilization. Technologies and process 
options falling under solidification/stabUization response action are those that lirmt the 
solubility or mobility of contaminants within the soil matrix, with or without changing the 
physical characteristics of the matrix. They include stabilization, 
solidification/stabilization, and sorbent solidification. Solidification alone generally 
implies that the matrix is transformed into a solid monolith for the primary purpose of 
structural integrity. Stabilization generally implies that contaminants within the matrix 
become physically or chemically bound. 

• Effectiveness. Solidification/stabilization would be accomplished by mixing the soil 
with various materials such as portland cement, certain pozzolans, silicates, 
thermoplastics, and/or bitumens to form a solid matrix that incorporates the 


JM.67062.45.OU4.FlnalFS.11/83 2-50 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


combinations of contaminants. The contaminants might or might not be chemically 
bound to constituents within the matrix. Site-specific treatability studies have not 
been perfonned, so the chemistry and the effective reduction in contaminant mobility 
cannot be evaluated. Solidification/stabilization would not reduce the toxicity or 
volume of the waste. 

• Implementability. Solidification/stabilization may be relatively easily implemented. 
There are a number of vendors of turnkey systems for on-site 
solidification/stabilization. Equipment used is typically mobile and easily mobilized. 

• Cost. The cost of solidification/stabilization varies greatly with the type of process 
used. Estimated costs for treatment of contaminated solids by 
solidification/stabilization using pordand cement, pozzolans, and/or silicates are 
typically in the range of $50 to $75 per cubic yard. 

• Summary. As a potentially effective (in reducing the mobility of contaminants), 
easily implemented, and typically low-cost technology, solidification/stabilization is 
retained for further evaluation. Treatability studies would be required to determine 
the effectiveness of solidification/stabilization with the contaminant/soil matrices at 
the ADA. 

2.422.8 Ex Situ Treatment - Soil Washing. The physical separation of contaminated 
particles by washing with water, agitation, and particle classification is a potentially 
effective means to treat contaminated soil. When used on contaminated soil, this process 
makes use of the tendency of contaminants to concentrate in the finer particles (or fines) 
of soil leaving the larger particles relatively contaminant-free. Ideally, separation of the 
two ranges of particle sizes then allows for a significant reduction in soil volume to be 
treated. 

• Effectiveness. The effectiveness of soil washing to physically concentrate 
contaminants by particle size classification is very dependent on specific soil and 
contaminant characteristics. Proof of its effectiveness for any given application 
would require feasibility/treatability testing. Soil washing using water to physically 
remove metals from soil has been demonstrated effective in specific applications 
3031. Application of the technology has the potential to substantially reduce the 
volume of contaminated soil requiring further treatment or disposal. The soil 
washing technology is reportedly moderately to marginally effective for the removal 
of pesticides from soil. However, bench-scale studies conducted by USATHAMA 
indicate that removal efficiencies of explosive compounds are generally poor 3234.

2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


• Implementability. Equipment for on-site soil washing is readily available, mobile, 
and capable of processing contaminated soil at a wide range of throughputs The 
technology relies on the use of recycled water so there are no concerns regarding the 
storage and use of other extraction agents such as solvents or acids. Since the water 
is recycled, there are no concerns with the use of excessive amounts of water since it 
is a valuable resource at UMDA. 

• Cost The cost of soil washing to reduce the volume of contaminated soil is 
dependent on the total volume to be treated. A cost analysis performed for 
USATHAMA indicates that representative unit costs to treat soil at volumes required 
for remediation of ADA soils are roughly $60 per cubic yard of soil3i. This malysis 
also included the comparison of costs associated with the solidification/stabilization 
and soil washing to identify the volume of soil at which soil washing as a 
pretreatment was economical. The results indicate that the cost effectiveness of soil 
washing is in doubt at volumes of approximately 5,000 cubic yards and less^o. 

Since soil volumes at the ADA are greater than this, soil washing, if determined 
effective, may be attractive from a cost standpoint 

• Summary. Soil washing to reduce the volume of contaminated soil by concentrating 
the contaminants may be technically feasible and cost effective. Its effectiveness 
would require demonstration by feasibility/treatability testing. The process is 
relatively easily implemented. Because of the potential for effectiveness and cost 
reduction as well as implementability, soil washing as a pretreatment to reduce the 
contaminated volume is retained for detailed analysis. 

2.422.9 Ex SituTreatment-Incineration. A variety of thermal technologies exists for 
the treatment of solids containing organic contaminants. These techniques thermally 
oxidize or pyrolyze combustible pollutants at elevated terrqreratures, to produce the 
combustion products carbon dioxide and water. Other elemental constituents such as 
nitrogen, halogens, phosphorus, and sulfur are typically converted to acidic vapors. If 
the incinerated material contains metals, they may be retained in the ash, retained as 
particulates in the air pollution control system, or may be volatilized and released to the 
atmosphere. 

Advantages of thermal treatment of wastes are: 

• Toxic organic components are permanently converted to harmless or less harmful 
compounds. 

• TheiWl desmiction of organic-contaminated material may be an ultimate treatment in 
itself, requiring no further treatment of residuals. 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


The most commonly used incineration process for the on-site treatment of contaminated 
soil is the rotary kiln incinerator. With this incinerator, waste is combusted in a 
refractory-Uned kiln that is heated by burning fossil fuels. Exhaust gases pass through a 
secondary combustion chamber (afterburner) and air pollution control (APC) equipment 
Minimal feed preparation is required. The primary residues generated are solid from the 
combustor (ash) and particulate from the APC. Scrubber water from the APC is 
generally recycled. Rotary kiln incinerators are the most versatile and the most proven of 
all devices for waste soil incineration. 

Qn-site rotary kiln incinerators are available as either mobile or transportable units. 
Mobile units are small-capacity systems permanently installed on two or three trucks that 
are typically used at sites where Ae waste quantity ranges up to 20,000 tons. The 
incineration of larger volumes can be conducted more effectively using transportable 
system Aat occupy 5 to 30 trucks and Aat require on-site assembly. 

• Effectiveness. Based on Ae general effectiveness of Aermal destruction meAods for 
organics, treatment by rotary kiln mcmeration has Ae potential to destroy orgaiuc 
contaminants to Ae maximum extent feasible. Full-scale field demonstrations of 
rotary kiln mcineration have demonstrated a Destraction Removal Efficiency (DRE) 
of greater Aan 99.99 percent for soils containing explosive compounds^^. Full-scale 
mcineration of explosive-contaminated soils, usmg transportable rotary kiln 
mcinerators, has been implemented at two Army installations 39 , 40 . AlAough 
potentially reducing Ae volume of contaminated soil, mcineration does not result m 
Ae destmction of metals and is not an appropriate technology for Ae treatment of soil 
contaminated wiA only metals. It is, however, a feasible technology for Ae 
pretreatment of soil contaminated wiA boA organics and metals for Ae removal of 
orgaiucs prior to subsequent treatment to remove or stabilize Ae metals. 

• Implementability. The implementability of on-site rotary kiln mcmeration has been 
demonstrated on Ae full-scale to treat e}q)losive-contammated soil at two Army 
mstallations. Explosives concentrations m ADA soils do not appear to be a 
constraint StuAes conducted by USATHAMA inAcate Aat sediments wiA 
explosive concentration levels higher Aan Aose in ADA soils can be fed directly to 
Ae primary combustion chamber of an mcinerator wiAout exceeding acceptable 
safety limitations^!. 

• Cost The unit cost of mobile and transportable rotary kiln mcmeration is highly 
dependent on Ae total mass of soil. Because of Ae fixed costs of site preparation, 
mobilization, and trial bums, Ae cost per ton mcreases as Ae total mass decreases. 
Unit operating costs have been estimated by two vendors of mobile rotary kiln 
mcmerators and range from $250 to $750 per ton^z. In Ae same survey, vendor 


JM.67062.4S.OU4.FlnalFS.11/93 2-53 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


operating costs for transportable rotary kiln incinerators ranged from $200 to $450 
per ton. These costs did not include excavation, site preparation, or solids handling. 
The results of another estimate indicated that total incineration costs for Superfund 
sites, including excavation, permitting, and ancillary equipment, were in the $200 to 
$650 per ton range. Total project costs for the incineration of explosives- 
contaminated soil at Comhusker Army Ammunition Plant were $260 per ton 
(40,000 tons total)39 and at Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant were $330 per ton 
(102,0(X) tons total)40. 

• Summary. On-site rotary kiln incineration is selected for further detailed evaluation 
because it is the single technology whose effectiveness and implementability have 
been demonstrated in similar applications involving organic (including explosives) 
contaminated soil. 

2.422.10 Ex Situ Glassification. A variety of thermal technologies exists for the 
treatment of solids containing organic contaminants. These techniques thermally oxidize 
or pyrolyze combustible pollutants at elevated temperatures to produce the combustion 
products carbon dioxide and water. Other elemental constituents such as nitrogen, 
halogens, phosphorus, and sulfur are typically converted to acidic vapors. Thermal 
treatment for wastes containing significant concentrations of metals is a difficult process 
to operate and avoid volatilizing metals to the environment. 

Advantages of thermal glassification of wastes include: 

• Metals and inorganics will be fixed (and thus immobile). 

• The technology is based on well-understood and developed technology. 

• The glass product will be highly leach resistant. 

Glass-making furnaces may be heated electrically (Joule heating) or by firing fossil fuels 
such as gas, oil, or coal. Preparation of the furnace feed, to minimize the amount of 
glass forming chemicals that would be required to produce a melt with the required 
viscosity at the operating temperature, would likely require judicious selection among the 
various clays, and sandy-soils. The glass forming chemicals to be added would probably 
be sodium alkalies, and we expect that perhaps as much as 25 weight percent of the 
furnace feed will be glass formers required to achieve satisfactory operation. For fossil 
fuel fired furnaces, sandy fine clays and sands may require agglomeration in ordCT to 
reduce the entrainment of particulates into the offgas. 

Because g lassifi cation must be carried out at high temperatures [typically 12(X)°C 
(22(X)°F)], the glass-making operation can generate fumes that are extremely difficult to 
remove from the offgases. For this reason, the air pollution control system may require 


JM.67062.45.OU4.Final FS.11/93 2-54 




2.0 Identification and Screening of Technologies 


sophisticated equipment such as sonic scrubbers for removal of fumes and small size 
particulates. Depending upon the relative volatility of chemical species, it might be 
possible to return the scrubber liquid to the glassification furnace for incoiporation of the 
captured particulates into the glass. 

Chlorides and sulfates may create problems in glassification because these are not readily 
incoiporated into the glass and are the source of fumes (e.g., sodium chloride will be a 
liquid with an appreciable vapor pressure at the operating temperature) which tend to 
exacerbate corrosion in the offgas handling equipment 

Because of the addition of glass formers and despite the density of the glass products, it 
is likely that the volume of the glassified product will be somewhat greater than the 
volume of materials processed. 

• Effectiveness. The glassification technology has been shown to be effective with a 
variety of organic compounds and metals36. Glassification has not been 
demonstrated for use with explosives; however, extrapolation of results of 
incineration of explosive-contaminated soil at temperatures of 1500-18(X)°F 37 
indicate that explosives would most likely be successfully oxidized at glassification 
temperatures. 

• Implementability. Glassification makes use of well-established technology for the 
melting of glass. Glassification involves high temperature (typically 2200®F) 
treatment of contaminated solids for the purpose of destroying organic co ntamin ants 
and immobilizing metals (and most other inorganics) contaminants in a glass residual 
product form. Organic components of wastes are thermally oxidized. Offgases are 
vented through a scrubber. Ash containing inorganic components is entrapped in the 
glass. 

• Cost The capital cost of a glass-making furnace is very high which makes it 
uneconomical for all but very large volumes of soil. Estimated capital costs of 
available glass-making furnaces are in the area of $38,(XX),()00. Considering the 
volume of soils to be treated at the ADA, it is obvious that the per unit treatment cost 
is extremely high (nearly $15(X) per cubic yard of soil treated for capital expenditure 
alone). 

• Summary. Although glassification is a technically feasible option, due to the 
combination of relatively low volumes of soil to be treated and the high capital 
equipment cost, this alternative is eliminated from further consideration. 


JM.67062.4S.OU4.Final FS.11/93 2-55 





2.0 Identification and Screening of Technoiogies 


2.422.11 Off-Site Treatment and/or Disposal. Although the NCP specifies a preference 
for on-site remedies, there are certain circumstances in which off-site treatment and/or 
disposal may be preferable; particularly for smaller waste volumes. The potential for 
some of the ADA soils to exhibit the RCRA hazardous toxicity characteristic due to the 
presence of lead (and cadmium), would require that implementation of this option involve 
extensive analyses and segregation of soils according to their toxicity characteristic. Soil 
exhibiting the toxicity characteristic would require treatment prior to disposal. Other soils 
could be disposed of as nonhazardous wastes. 

• Effectiveness. Removing the contaminated soil from the ADA would be effective in 
achieving the remedial action objectives. 

• Implementability. The excavation of contaminated soil followed by transporting the 
soil to an off-site facility for treatment and/or disposal is one of the oldest and most 
established forms of soil remediation, particularly for small volumes of soil. It can be 
an expedient means of achieving the remedial action objectives. Implementability is 
negatively affected by requirements for manifesting and decontamination associated 
with transportation of the RCRA hazardous contaminated material. In addition, 
implementability may be affected by negative public opinion regarding movement of 
contaminated soil from the installation to a treatment/disposal facility. 

• Cost Costs for off-site treatment and/or disposal are dependent on the volume of 
soil involved, specific requirements for treatment, and availability and location of a 
suitable treatment/disposal facility. Estimated costs for excavation, transportation 
off-site, soil treatment, and residue disposal are $1,(X)0 per cubic yard of RCRA 
hazardous soil requiring treatment prior to disposal. Costs for excavation, 
transportation off-site, and disposal of nonhazardous soil are estimated at $80 per 
cubic yard of soil. 

• Summary. Off-site treatment and/or disposal would achieve the remedial action 
objectives and tiiere is potential that it could be cost effective considering the 
relatively CTriall volumes of soil involved. Implementation of the option may be 
negatively impacted by regulatory requirements and public opinion; however, off-site 
treatment and/or disposal has been a frequently used remedial alternative. Because of 
the potential for off-site treatment and/or disposal to be expediently implemented and 
cost effective, this alternative is retained for further consideration for the 
contaminated soils at the ADA.

3.0 Development of Alternatives 


The two stages of screening potential technologies and process options for actions 
addressing soil contamination at the ADA, as described in Section 2,0, Identification and 
Screening of Technologies resulted in the selection of those technologies and process 
options that had potential applicability based on a determination of effectiveness, 
implementability, and cost Those technologies and process options that survived the 
final screening were assembled and remedial alternatives were developed that consist of 
one or more of the options. These alternatives will be subjected to a detailed analysis that 
will be presented in Section 4.0, Detailed Analysis of Alternatives. 

The developed alternatives with a summary of the primary actions involved in each of the 
alternatives are presented in Table 3-1 and are described in more detail below. Table 3-1 
provides a reference to the identification of specific alternatives to be addressed in Section 
4.0, Detailed Analysis of Alternatives. 


3.1 Alternative 1: No Action 

The No Action alternative serves as a common reference point for the analysis of 
alternatives that result in the remediation of the ADA. It provides a basis for comparison 
between the various alternatives. Implementation of the No Action alternative does not 
imply abandonment of the ADA. Existing security provisions to limit access to the ADA 
would be continued. 


3.2 Alternative 2: Institutional Control and UXO Clearance 

This alternative provides for the reduction of risks associated with future use of the ADA 
by conducting clearance of UXO to various levels. Institutional controls would be 
applied as appropriate to restrict access to and future use of the ADA consistent with the 
level of UXO clearance performed. No action would be taken to address chemical 
contamination of soil at Ae ADA. 

This alternative consists of three options to address surface UXO clearance and 
subsurface clearance to depAs of 1 and 5 feet Because Ae locations and density of 
UXO at Ae ADA are unknown, it will be conservatively assumed, for Ae purposes of 
this evaluation, Aat clearance will be conducted across Ae entire ADA. Specific options 
are described below. 

3.2.1 Alternative 2A 

Specific actions required for the implementation of Ais alternative include: 

• Clear UXO from Ae surface of Ae entire ADA. 

• Limit future use to current restricted military use wiA vehicle access to roads only.

options for this alternative are developed to address pretreatment of the soil to reduce its

4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


The alternatives developed in Section 2.0, Identification and Screening of Technologies 
and Section 3.0, Development of Alternatives, are summarized in Table 3-1. For the 
ADA, seven basic alternatives are to be considered. Some of these alternatives include a 
number of options to provide adequate input to remedial alternative selection. 

TTie purpose of this section of the FS is to present information relevant to selecting an 
tq)propriate remedy for the ADA. The analyses were performed in accordance with the 
requirements of the NCP, CERCLA, SARA, the Interim Guidance on Superfund 
Selection of Remedy, and the Oregon Hazardous Substance Remedial Action Rules. The 
analyses are also based on the institutional and technical criteria presented in Section 2.0, 
Identification and Screening of Technologies. 


4.1 CERCLA Evaluation Criteria 

The detailed analysis of alternatives consists of the evaluation and presentation of the 
relevant information needed to allow decision makers to select a site remedy. In 
developing this analysis there are five specific statutory requirements for remedial actions 
that must be addressed, including: 

• P*rotection of human health and the environment 

• Attairunent of ARARs 

• Cost-effectiveness 

• Use of permanent solutions and alternative treatment technologies or resource 
recovery technologies to the maximum extent practicable 

• Preference for treatment that reduces toxicity, mobility, and/or volume as the 
principal element 

In addition, CERCLA places an emphasis on evaluating long-term effectiveness and 
related considerations for each of the alternatives, including: 

• The long-term uncertainties associated with land disposal 

• The goals, objectives, and requirements of the Solid Waste Disposal Act 

• The persistence, toxicity, and mobility of hazardous substances and their 
constituents, and their propensity to bioaccumulate 

• Short- and long-term potential for adverse health effects from human exposure 

• Long-term maintenance costs 

• The potential for future remedial action costs if the alternative remedial action in 
question were to fail 

• The potential threat to human health and the environment associated with excavation, 
transportation, and redisposal, or containment 

Each of these requirements and considerations were then combined in the NCP, and nine 
evaluation criteria were developed to address the intent of the requirements and 


JM.67062.4S.OU4.Final FS.11/93 4-1 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


considerations and other technical and policy considerations that have proven to be 
important for selecting remedial alternatives. These nine evaluation criteria have served 
as the basis for conducting the detailed analysis of the nine remedial alternatives for the 
ADA. In order to ensure that the appropriate weight was applied to each of the criteria, 
the NCP divides the nine criteria into three groups (as shown in Figure 4-1): 1) 
Threshold Criteria; 2) Primary Balancing Criteria; and 3) Modifying Criteria. 

4.1.1 Threshold Criteria 

Two of the criteria relate directly to statutory requirements that must ultimately be 
satisfied in the ROD. They are categorized as threshold criteria because any alternative 
selected to remediate the ADA must meet them. They can be described as follows: 

• Overall Protection of Human Health and the Environment - Describes how each 
alternative, as a whole, achieves and maintains protection of human health and the 
environment This assessment draws on the assessments conducted under other 
evaluation criteria, especially long-term and short-term effectiveness and compliance 
with ARARs. It focuses on whether a specific alternative achieves adequate 
protection and describes how site risks are eliminated, reduced or controlled through 
treatment, engineering, or institutional controls. 

• Compliance with ARARs - Describes how each alternative complies with ARARs, or 
if a waiver is required and how it is justified. The assessment also addresses other 
information from advisories, criteria, and guidance that the agencies agree is "to be 
considered." The detailed analysis summarizes which federal and State of Oregon 
requirements are applicable or relevant and appropriate for the specific alternative and 
how the alternative meets these requirements. 

4.1.2 Primary Balancing Criteria 

Five of the criteria are grouped together because they represent the primary factors upon 
which the analysis is based, taking into account technical, cost, institutional, and risk 
concerns. 

• Long-Term Effectiveness and Permanence - Evaluates the effectiveness of each 
alternative in maintainin g protection of human health and the environment after 
re^onse objectives have been met. This assessment considers the magnitude of the 
residual risk (in this case, risk from contaminated soil that is not treated and risk 
from treatment residuals, if any), measured by numerical standards where possible. 

It also considers the adequacy and reliability of controls. 

• Reduction of Toxicity, Mobility, and Volume through Treatment - Evaluates the 
anticipated performance of the specific treatment technologies each alternative might 
employ. Where possible, numerical comparisons before and after remediation are

presented. This assessment also considers the degree to which treatment is 
irreversible, the type and quantity of residuals that will remain following treatment, 
and the degree to which the treatment reduces the inherent hazards posed by the site. 

• Short-Term Effectiveness - Examines the effectiveness of each alternative in 
protecting public health, worker health, and the environment during the construction 
and implementation of a remedy until response objectives have been met. The time 
until protection is achieved is also considered here. 

• Implementability - Evaluates the technical and administrative feasibility of each 
alternative and the availability of required goods and services. Technical feasibility 
includes the ability to constmct the system used, the ability to operate and mainl^ 
the equipment, and the ability to monitor and review the effectiveness of operations. 
Administrative feasibility refers to the ability to obtain normal legal approvals (e.g., 
site access), public relations and community response, and coordination with 
government regulatory agencies. 

• Cost - Evaluates the capital and operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of each 
alternative. Capital cost refers to the expenditures required to develop and constmct 
the facilities necessary to implement the alternative. O&M cost refers to Ae 
expenditures of time and materials throughout the course of the remediation, 
including costs to lease equipment The costs presented in the detailed analysis are 
intended to provide an accuracy of +50 percent to -30 percent 

The level of detail required to analyze each alternative against these evaluation criteria 
depends on the type and complexity of the site, the type of technologies and alternatives 
being considered, and other project-specific considerations. This FS addresses soils at 
the ADA contaminated by metals, explosives, and/or pesticides. The detail presented in 
the following analysis has been focused accordingly. 

4.1.3 Modifying Criteria 

In accordance with Rl/FS guidance, the final two criteria involving state and community 
acceptance will be evaluated foUowing the receipt of state agency and pubUc comments on 
the FS and the Proposed Plan. The criteria are as follows: 

• State (Support Agency) Acceptance - Reflects the state of Oregon's apparent 
preferences among or concerns regarding the alternatives. State input and acceptance 
are obtained during preparation of the final FS and Proposed Plan through the state s 
role as an equal partner to the Army and EPA in the Federal Facility Agreement 

• Community Acceptance - Reflects the local communities’ apparent preferences 
amo ng or concems about alternatives.

4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


4.2 Analysis of Alternatives 
4.2.1 Common Elements 

The processes and procedures that are common to more than one of the remedial 
alternatives are presented here to minimize redundancy. Reference wiU be made to these 
common elements as appropriate in subsequent analyses of alternatives. 

4^.1.1 Institutional Controls. The implementation of institutional controls would 
involve taking legal and physical measures to restrict access and use of the ADA. Legal 
restrictions would have two purposes: 

• Restricting access to the ADA to prevent direct human exposure to contaminants 
through legal limitations on who may conduct activities at the ADA (and where these 
activities may be conducted) 

• Restricting future land use at the ADA to prevent, or limit, residential or light 
industrial development 

If imposed, these legal restrictions would be retained permanently at the ADA. 

One of the primary drivers for the need for institutional controls to be implemented at the 
ADA is the presence of UXO on the surface and in the subsurface. In consideration of 
the presence of UXO and the degree of UXO clearance to be performed, a likely option 
for institutional control at the ADA includes restricting future land use for limit^ and 
specific military training purposes only (implying that the ADA would remain fenced, in 
government control, and not released to the public). This assumes that surface clearance 
and, if required, shallow (1 to 5 feet) subsurface clearance of UXO would be performed. 

Ck)st elements associated with the implementation of institutional controls include the 
costs of fencing (or maintenance of fencing), security, and monitoring. Since these costs 
will be incurred by the Army regardless of the remedial alternative selected, they are not 
provided in this FS. 

4.2.1.2 Clearance of Unexploded Ordnance (UXO). Various scenarios that ma y be 
required to effect different degrees of UXO clearance are considered in this evaluation. 
These include: 

• Total clearance of the entire l,75()-acre ADA (to include surface clearance and 
clearance to 1 and 5 feet 

• Clearance of selected areas to allow for excavation of soil for remediation 

• Total clearance (to 20 feet) of selected sites 

• Subsurface clearance (to a maximum depth of 5 feet) of small areas (e.g., less than 
20 acres) to allow for limited construction associated with site remediation 


JM.67062.45.OU4.FinaJ FS.11/03 4-5 



4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


Cost estimates for each of these scenarios are presented below. 

It should be noted that an analysis of UXO clearance in terms of time required and total 
cost is very site-specific. The time required to conduct a clearance is dependent on a 
number of factors. The most significant of these factors include: terrain, vegetation 
(particularly undergrowth), and density of metallic items (including ordnance items) on 
the surface and in the subsurface. As a first step in estimating the costs associated with 
UXO clearance, part of an economic model developed by the U.S. Navy was used to 
calculate the time required to clear UXO from the surface and subsurface38. This m^el 
provides for the calculation of time required as a function of terrain, vegetation, and item 
density. Clearance times were then combined with cost information provided by firms 
that specialize in UXO clearance to develop cost estimates for surface and subsurface 
clearance. Economy of scale is also a factor in the cost of clearance. The estimates 
provided immediately below for surface and subsurface clearance to 5 feet assume the 
clearance of 1,750 acres. An area of this magnitude may be considered to benefit from 
economy of scale. 

At any level of UXO clearance operations, clearance of visible UXO from the ground 
surface is required. In typical surface clearance operations, a "sweep team" made up of 
several personnel walk abreast along established grids. The team members count and 
remove all metallic items. Explosive items encountered may be marked for later removal 
by explosive ordnance disposal-trained personnel's. Under optimum circumstances 
(i.e., flat terrain, little vegetation, and few metallic items), a typical sweep team 
composed of 10 personnel is capable of clearing a total of 40 acres/day^s. A more 
conservative estimate of approximately 16 acres/day for a 10-member team was calculated 
based on the Navy model. At this rate, surface clearance of the entire ADA (assuming 
1,750 acres) would require approximately 110 days. Corresponding clearance costs are 
estimated at approximately $500 per acre (including all reporting, emergency on-site 
personnel, and turnover of UXO). This estimate appears to be consistent with a recent 
estimate of $380 per acre provided to the Army for a recent surface clearance only 
(excludes emergency services, turnover and disposal of UXO, or any necessary site 
preparation) at an Army site43. To summarize: 

Surface Oearance: Total time required (days): 110 
Cost ($/acre): 500 

As would be expected, the need for subsurface clearance has a significant impact on the 
time and cost of UXO clearance. According to vendors surveyed, the same basic effort is 
required whether detection and clearance is to 1 foot or to 5 feet 38.44. The primary 
diffaence in time and cost is that the time to investigate, dig, and remove a deeper item is 
greater. 

After a surface clearance has been completed, subsurface clearance is initiated by a 
subsurface survey usually conducted with hand-held magnetometers (metal detectors) 


JM.67062.45.CXJ4.Fir»alFS.11/93 4-6 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


passed over the surface to detect subsurface items. There are a number of approaches to 
conducting the survey and clearance. An approach described by one experienced vendor 
includes the following steps: 

• 1,000-foot long lanes are marked on the ground surface at 10-foot intervals. 

• Each member of the team makes a pass with a magnetometer down each side of the 
lane providing an overlap of coverage of approximately percent. 

• Metric items identified to a depth of 12 inches are identified by probing and may be 
removed by hand during the survey. 

• Metallic items identified at a depths of greater than 12 inches are flagged. 

• After the survey, the flagged locations are revisited to remove the item by excavation 
with shovels or, if necessary, a backhoe. 

Based on the sequence of events described above, assumptions were made to allow for 
the estimation of time required for subsurface clearance to a depth of 1 foot through the 
use of the Navy model. Specific assumptions include: 

• A subsurface metallic density (to 1 foot) of 23 items per acre. 

• Approximately 0.75 of an hour is required to investigate (and remove) each item. 

• A 20-man team is used to conduct the clearance. 

• An average of 6 hours per day for actual clearance. 

Given these assumptions, the calculated rate of clearance is approximately 5 acres per day 
for a 20-member team. Qearance of the entire ADA to a depth of 1 foot would therefore 
require approximately 360 days. The cost of such a clearance is estimated at $3,000 per 
acre. In summary: 

Subsurface Clearance (to 1 foot): Total time required (days): 360 

Cost ($/acre): 3,000 

An estimation of time required for the conduct of a subsurface clearance to a depth of 5 
feet is based on the same basic assumptions above with the exceptions that approximately 
1.5 hours is required to investigate and remove each metallic item with an assumed 
density of 30 items per acre. The related calculated rate of clearance is approximately 2.3 
acres per day for a 20-member team. Clearance of the entire ADA to a depth of 5 feet 
would therefore require approximately 760 days. The cost of such a clearance is 
estimated at $6,300 per acre. In summary: 

Subsurface Clearance (to 5 feet): Total time required (days): 760 

Cost ($/acre): 6,300 

The second UXO clearance scenario considered is that which would permit the 
excavation of soil at the ADA. Soil excavation will be required for the remediation of 
chemically contaminated soil. Based on estimates provided by vendors, the cost of 


JM.67062.45.0U4.Flnal FS.11/93 4-7 





4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


conducting UXO clearance associated with soil excavation increases the cost of 
excavating con tamin ated soil ($8 per cubic yard) by a factor of 2.5 (or $12 per cubic yard 

additional cost for UXO clearance). 

In addition to the estimates provided above, the cost of general UXO clearance to a depth 
of 20 feet has been estimated per acre cleared (for reference). It is assumed that removal 
to 20 feet would essentially result in a complete removal of UXO from that acre. The 
cost of clearance to a depth of 20 feet has been estimated at $516,000 per acre38. This is 
a rough estimate based on the cost to excavate to 20 feet under normal circumstances with 
a factor of four to account for the need to detect and clear UXO. Since such a clearance 
has not been conducted on a large scale, there are no real data to support this estimate. 
However, the estimate is consistent with an earlier reported estimate of about $12 per 
cubic yard to excavate soil to a depth of 10 feet, remove the ordnance and debris, and 
return the land to a near natural conditions 25. 

Finally, the estimates for surface and subsurface (to 5 feet) clearance assume clearance of 
the entire 1,750 acres of the ADA. If clearance of small areas only (e.g., less to 20 
acres) is required, there will be a minimum cost required to clear based on a minimum 
team of UXO personnel, and a minimum time on site. A minimum clearance cost has 
been estimated at $130,000. This cost represents a 5-member team on site for 20 days. 

The costs presented above for subsurface clearance to depths of 1 and 5 feet are based on 
a man ual survey with personnel carrying magnetometers over the site. There is the 
potential to reduce survey time and costs by employing a Surface Towed Ordnance 
Locator System (STOLS). The STOLS, developed under contract for the Navy, is an 
automated ordnance locator system using an all-terrain tow vehicle to pull a platform 
outfitted with an array of seven magnetometers. The tow vehicle is equipped with a 
computerized data acquisition system, a control panel, and a positioning system. Output 
from the magnetometers is input to the data acquisition system and locations of 
subsurface item detections are recorded by the positioning system. Once the survey is 
complete the data are analyzed by technicians to provide for the location of the subsurface 
item and an estimate of the size and depth of the item. The item can then be excavated, 
identified, and rendered safe or disposed. 

One of the advantages of the STOLS is that it provides for a less personnel-intensive 
survey. It is estimated that in some cases, a survey using the STOLS can reduce costs 
associated with survey/subsurface clearance operations by as much as $300 per acre24. 

Efficient operation of the STOLS is dependent on site terrain and vegetation, the system 
cannot move efficiently through wooded areas or over rocky terrain. This limitation is 
not expected to be significant given the terrain and vegetation characteristics of the ADA. 

Although the STOLS might possibly provide for less costly clearance operations, there is 
currently only a functional prototype available for testing and demonstration purposes. 


JM.67062.45.OU4.FlnaJ FS.11/93 4^ 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


Reliability and maintainability (RAM) testing has not been conducted on the system and 
repair parts and maintenance support systems have not been established 24. Reportedly, 
the system is undergoing commercial development; however, the time firame for this 
development is unknown. 

An additional consideration to the use of the STOLS is that the instrumented detection 
system is pulled behind a manned vehicle. Depending on specific site conditions, there 
may be a reluctance on the part of UXO clearance personnel to place a manned vehicle in 
advance of the UXO detection equipment 

Because of the current unavailability of the STOLS and the concerns imposed by the 
positioning of the manned tow vehicle before the detector array, consideration of the 
STOLS will not be included in the total analyses associated with UXO clearance. 

4.2.1.3 Excavation of Soli. The implementation of Alternatives 4,5,6, and 7 involve 
the excavation of contaminated soils. At the ADA, excavation of soil will be complicated 
by requirements to identify and remove UXO. In addition to UXO clearance (described 
above), excavation of soil would be conducted as follows: 

• Excavation and hauling would be done using conventional equipment and technology 
(e.g., backhoes, front-end loaders, dump trucks, scrapers). 

• Excavation to a depth of 20 feet would require that sides of the excavation be sloped 
as appropriate for sideslope stability and shoring would not be required. 

• The soil would be loaded on dump trucks and hauled to the treatment or disposal 
area. 

Costs for excavation and loading associated with an unshored, uncontaminated 
excavation in similar circumstances have been estimated at approximately $4 per cubic 
yard of soil. Similar excavations involving contaminated soil are estimated at $8 per cubic 
yard. 

Excavated sites will be restored by backfill with clean soil and revegetation with native 
plants. 

4.2.1.4 Soil Washing to Reduce Contaminated Soil Volume. The physical 
separation of contaminated fine soil particles (e.g., silt and clay) from larger soil particles 
(e.g., sand) by washing with water, agitation and particle classification may be an 
effective method to reduce the volume of contaminated soil that requires subsequent 
treatment or disposal. 

When used with contaminated soils, the soil washing process makes use of the fact that 
finer particles have a much larger surface area per unit volume than do larger soil 
particles. When the contaminants are uniformly distributed over the surface of the soil 
particles, a greater proportion of the contamination is concentrated on the fine soil 


JM.67062.45.CXJ4.RnalFS.11/93 4-9 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


particles with their large surface area per unit volume, leaving the larger particles 
relatively free of contamination. Ideally, separation of the contaminated soil into fines 
that are highly contaminated and a relatively uncontaminated large particle fraction allows 
for a sigiuficant reduction in soil volume requiring further treatment or disposal. Soil 
(i.e., sand) that meets the cleanup levels can be returned to the site or otherwise disposed 
of as a nonhazardous solid waste. 

Process Description. A representative soil washing process is presented in 
Figure 4-2. As shown, the excavated and stockpiled contaminated soil is screened to 
renoove oversized (greater than 0.25 inch) particles and debris. The finer soil is conveyed 
t^ a spiral classifier where water is introduced and the separation of the fines from the 
sand occurs. The sand is dewatered and returned to the site or handled as a nonhazardous 
material. The resulting fines slurry is pumped to a settling tank where the fines settle as a 
sludge, leaving clear water to be recycled. A flocculating polymer may be added at this 
step to enhance settling, if necessary. After settling, the fines are pumped to a filter press 
for further dewatering. At this point, the concentrated and dewatered contaminated fines 
can be subjected to further treatment for toxicity reduction and/or 
solidification/stabilization. 

A review of the technology was performed for the EPA in support of a remedial 
alternative evaluation at the Deactivation Furnace site at UMDA. In this review, it was 
determined that, based on the particle size and contaminant distribution in these soils, the 
contaminated media could be concentrated to a volume that is 20 percent of the original 
soil volume Although similar particle size and contaminant distribution 

characterizations were not performed for ADA soils, it is assumed for the purpose of this 
evaluation that ADA soils are adequately similar to permit the same volume reduction 
assumption. 

The low solubility of the contaminants of concern in water will most likely allow for the 
washwater to be recycled without treatment. It is assumed that once the soil washing 
process is complete, the water will be treated by lime precipitation in the existing settling 
tank to remove any soluble metals. If organic compounds are present in the water, 
further treatment by activated carbon adsorption may be necessary prior to discharge of 
the water. Based on the solubility of the contaminants in water, it may not be necessary to 
treat the water prior to discharge once the soil washing has been completed3i. 

Soil washing is considered an innovative technology. As such, a treatability study would 
be required to confirm the effectiveness of the process; and identify operating parameters 
and develop cost estimates for full-scale implementation. 

The primary cost elements of soil washing include capital costs associated with the 
purchase and installation of the various pieces of equipment used, and operating costs 
such as labor, maintenance, and utilities (electricity and water).

4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


Assumptions regarding the implementation of soil washing include^i: 

• A nominal feed soil rate of approximately 9 tons per hour 

• An operating schedule of 260 days per year, 8 hours per day, and 70 percent 
operational time on line. 

4.2.1.5 Solldlflcatlon/Stabllizatlon. Solidification/stabilization has been proven most 
useful for the treatment of inorganic contaminants (including heavy metals). Its utility for 
the treatment of many organic-containing wastes may be limited due to the potential for 
detrimental chemical interactions, the volatility of the organic compounds, and limited 
success in reducing organic mobility. Because of the relatively low concentrations of 
nonvolatile organic contaminants in ADA soils, the likelihood for detrimental chemical 
interactions and volatility are lessened. However, the ability of the process to reduce the 
mobility of the organic contaminants is unknown and would require confirmation through 
treatability studies. 

Process Description. Stabilization and solidification waste treatment processes 
involve the mixing of specialized additives or reagents with waste materials to reduce 
(physically or chemically) the solubility or mobility of contaminants in the matrix. The 
term "stabilization" is used to describe techniques Aat chemically modify the contaminant 
to form a less soluble, mobile, or toxic form without necessarily changing the physical 
charactCTistics of the waste. Solidification refers to a technique for changing the physical 
form of the waste to produce a solid structure in which the contaminant is mechanically 
trapped. Many stabilization and solidification processes overlap, and the common 
terminology to describe either or both processes is solidification/stabilization. 

The types of processes and reagents used in solidification/stabilization processes will be 
selected based on the characteristics (chemical and physical) of the waste to be treated and 
on the desired characteristics (chemical and structural) of the treated product. Two 
common processes are: 

• Lime/Fly Ash Pozzolan Reactions - involving a reaction between nonciystalline silica 
in fly ash and lime to produce a low-strength solid in which contaminants are 
physically trapped 

• Pozzolan/Oment Reactions - which employ a pozzolan such as fly ash and cement to 
produce a relatively high-sttength wast^concrcte matrix in which contaminants are 
trapped 

For the purposes of this FS, it will be assumed that the soil and ash to be treated will be 
subject^ to a pozzolan/cement-based process to provide a treated product with maximum 
physical and chemical stability. 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


There are a number of configurations of the solidification/stabilization process including: 
in-drum mixing, in situ mixing, plant mixing, and area mixing^s. Of these, plant mixing 
is the most practical for treating soils at the ADA because it provides for greater 
throughput, increased control of contaminated materials, increased assurance of treatment 
effectiveness, and can be performed with transportable equipment A schematic of the 
plant mixing process is provided in Figure 4-3. 

Transportable solidification/stabilization processes will typically come complete with 
chemical storage units, chemical feed equipment, mixing equipment, and waste and 
product handling equipment 

Primary concerns with the application of solidification/stabilization include: 

• The potential chemical incompatibility between the material being treated and the 
solidification/stabilization reagents. For example, salts have been shown to cause 
swelling and cracking in solidified matrices^fi. 

• The long-term ability of the stabilized/solidified matrix to retain the contaminants. 
Since solidification/stabilization processes normally do not destroy the contaminant 
but, rather, place it in a nonleachable form, the long-term integrity of the product must 
be assured. 

These concerns can best be addressed through the conduct of treatability testing. The 
treatability test will also allow for the development of proper design and operation 
criteria. 

Implementation of solidification/stabilization would require sufficient land area around the 
operation to maintain a buffer zone, access roads capable of supporting heavy equipment 
(in this case, 80,()(X) lb trailers), and direct and unencumbered accessibility to the waste 
feed material. 

The actual equipment set-up for solidification/stabilization requires area for reagent 
storage tanks, mixer (or pugmill), and loading equipment. Approximately 0.25 acres will 
be required for the equipment alone. Additional area is required for loading and 
unloa^ng soil and treated material, untreated and treated material stockpiles, and track 
access. 

As stated above, there are a number of options available for management of the treated 
product For the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that the treated product will be 
discharged to a dump track, roll-off boxes, or other transportable containers for transport 
to the final disposal area. 

Utility requirements for solidification/stabilization will include:

• A continuous water supply at 60 psi to be used in the treatment reaction. For the 
purposes of analysis, it is assumed that this water will be available from installation 
sources. However, if supplies at the treatment site are insufficient, an alternate 
supply (from on or off the installation) will be required. 

• Electrical service of 480V, 3-phase for major equipment operation. In addition, the 
operation of ancillary operation and support systems will require 15 amp, 120-V, 
1-phase service. For the puiposes of this analysis, it is assumed that these electrical 
requirements can be met on the installation. 

Approximately 12 to 15 personnel are required to operate the system in a single 10 to 12 
hour shift, 6 days per week47. These personnel include operators, supervisor, shift 
foreman, and maintenance personnel. Individual shifts are long to ensure that once the 
chemical reagents are mixed, they continue to flow without hardening. Typically, 
maintenance is performed on the seventh day when the system is shut down. 

The following testing phases are performed to develop operational parameters and assure 
quality control of the treated product: 

• Waste characterization includes a determination of physical properties of the 
contaminated soil to include: bulk density, grain size distribution, atterberg limits 
(liquid and plastic), cone index, unconfined compressive strength, and percent 
moisture. In addition, analyses are performed to identify chemical characteristics that 
may affect the solidification/stabilization process including acids, solvents, halides, 
sulfates, pH, metals, solid organic contaminants, oil, and grease. 

• Treatability tests will be required to select the appropriate reagent systems and 
optimize prcxtess parameters. 

• To assess the quality of the final product, a series of tests are typically performed to 
determine product characteristics such as leachability, free liquid content, strength, 
permeability, and durability. 

Complete mobilization of the solidification/stabilization system will typically require 
approximately six weeks from the completion of treatability testing. Once operational, the 
time required to complete the solidification/stabilization of the contaminated media will 
depend on the total mass to be treated, the throughput, and the operating efficiency. The 
former factor is alternative-dependent and will be addressed in the discussion of the 
^ecific remedial alternatives below. The latter two factors are alternative-independent 
and assumptions specific to these factors are: 

• Operating schedule of 12 hours, 6 days per week with an operating on line time of 70 
percent

• Throughput of process is nominally 350 tons/day (including material to be treated and

4.2.1.6 On-Site Landfill Disposal of Nonhazardous Soil and/or Treatment 
Residues. As part of the remediation of soil at the ADA, soil may be excavated that, 
although contaminated to the degree that it does not meet remedial action goals, is not a 
RCRA hazardous waste. In addition, residuals resulting from the excavation and 
treatment of contaminated soil (including rocks and debris separated from the soil prior to 
treatment, solid treatment byproducts, and the final solid treatment product) may be 
nonhazardous. A potential disposal option considered for these nonhazardous solids is 
disposition in the active on-site landfill or in a new, engineered landfill that would be 
constructed on site. 

The existing active landfill, shown in Figure 4-4, is located in the eastern portion of 
UMDA between munitions storage blocks D and E. Under an agreement entered into by 
the Army, this landfill ceases receipt of municipal waste on October 9,1993, but may 
receive treated soil from the Deactivation Furnace Area (or other nonhazardous clean-up 
wastes or soils meeting similar standards) until late March 1998.48 The Army is 
currently in the process of preparing a closure plan for the landfill in accordance with its 
permit and ODEQ solid waste regulations and guidance. As part of landfill closure 
requirements, the following actions will be performed: 

• The landfill will be capped with a low permeability cap consisting of 18 inches of 
compacted soil with a permeability no greater than 1x10-5 cm/second. 

• Ground water monitoring will be performed for a period of five years aftCT closure to 
ensure that the landfill does not constitute a source of contamination. 

If it is determined that disposal of these nonhazardous solids in the active landfill is not 
desired, a new engineered landfill might be designed and constructed on site to receive 
them. This landfill would be designed and constructed to meet ODEQ solid waste 
regulations and be located at an appropriate (currently undetermined) location within 
UMDA. After all nonhazardous solids resulting fiom the remedial actions at UMDA are 
deposited in the landfill, it would be closed in accordance with requirements of its pemoit 
and ODEQ solid waste regulations and guidance. It is assumed that closure of this 
landfill will include a cap of compacted soil similar to that proposed for the active landfill 
as well as ground water monitoring for a period of five years after closure. Regardless of 
the option pursued (existing landfill or new landfill), all solid material considered for 
disposal would require sampling and analysis to confirm that it is nonhazardous. 

Costs for transporting the nonhazardous solids fiom the ADA to either the active landfill 
OT a new landfill are estimated at approximately $4 per cubic yard of nonhazardous solids 
to be disposed of. Costs associated with the design and construction of a new landfill 
will total approximately $1.3 million.

4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


The cost of closure of the existing active landfill (a separate OU) is included in the overall 
closure plan for that landfill and is not included here. The cost of closure of a new on¬ 
site landfill is estimated at approximately $24 per cubic yard of material disposed. 

4.2.1.7 Preparation of Remedial Design and Planning Documentation. A number 
of Remedial Design/Remedial Action planning documents may be required for 
implementation of a given alternative. These plans may include: Work Plan; Materials 
Handling Plan; Chemical Data Acquisition Plan; Trial Bum Plan; Erosion and 
Sedimentation Control Plan; Security Plan; Safety Plan; Traffic Control Plan; and 
Environmental Protection Plan. The extent and detail to which planning documentation 
will be required will depend on the specific processes to be enqiloyed in the remedial 
action and the complexity of the on-site remedial action activities. Based on previous 
remedial activities conducted by the Amiy, these costs are estimated at 10 percent of the 
total capital and O&M costs. 

4.2.1.8 Additional Costs for Sampling and Analysis. Additional sampling and 
analysis may be required for site characterization or confirmation during and/or after 
remediation. Some of these costs will be incurred by the Army regardless of the 
alternative selected (with the exception of No Action). These costs are included in the 
contingency costs allowances as part of the indirect capital cost. 

4.2.2 Alternative 1: No Action 

4.2.2.1 Description of Alternative. According to the NCP, remedy selection must 
include an analysis of the level of treatment with respect to the expenditures of time and 
materials required to achieve that level. The No Action alternative serves as a common 
reference point for this analysis and allows for comparisons between the various 
alternatives. 

No Action does not imply immediate abandonment of the ADA. Existing security 
provisions to limit access to the ADA would be continued. 

Natural recovery of the contaminated soil is unlikely at the ADA due to the characteristics 
of the dominant contaminants. The contaminants are nonvolatile and therefore their 
volatilization from soil at ambient temperatures is unlikely. In addition, due to the low 
organic content of the ADA soils as well as the relative resistance of the contaminants to 
biodegradation, degradation of the contaminants is unlikely. The primary mechanism that 
may serve to reduce contaminant concentrations is their dispersion (and resulting dilution) 
by wind. This mechanism is applicable to surface soils only. 

The primary route of migration of contaminants in soil at the ADA is through windblown 
dust A course of No Action would do nothing to limit the potential for contaminant 
migration. 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


AJZ.2.2 NCP Criteria Analysis. The degree to which the No Action alternative 
satisfies the seven threshold and primary balancing criteria of the NCP is discussed 
below. 

Overall Protection of Human Health and the Environment. This alternative 
does nothing to enhance protection of adjacent communities, the environment, or future 
land users. The risks posed by the soil would remain at the current level. 

The No Action alternative would present only a mirutnal risk of exposure to UMDA 
personnel during routine site activities. The site is removed from areas of active use, so 
direct contact with soils would not be expected. However, exposure via the air pathway 
would be of concern due to the potential for windblown dust at the ADA. This alternative 
would not require any further construction or operation activities. 

UXO would remain on the surface and in the subsurface and would continue to present 
safety hazards to anyone using the ADA other than on the established, cleared roads. 

Compliance with ARARs. This alternative would not comply with either state or. 
federal ARARs regarding soil remediation. The excess cancer risk values for potential 
future exposure at some sites would exceed the acceptable range of 1 x 1(H to 1 x 10-^ as 
stated in the NCP (40 CFR 3(X).430[e][2}[i][A][2]). Likewise, the state of Oregon 
requires a cleanup to background or, when background is not feasible, to that lowest 
level that is protective of human health and the environment while cost effective. The No 
Action alternative does not demonstrate a remedial effort that results in protection of 
human health or the environment. 

Long-Term Effectiveness. This alternative provides no long-term protection of 
human health and the environment, and the potential for direct exposure to future site 
users remains. 

Reduction in Toxicity, Mobility, and Volume. The No Action alternative 
achieves little, if any, reduction in die toxicity, mobility, or volume of the contaminants 
present. 

The primary route of migration of contaminants in soil at the ADA is through windblown 
dust A course of No Action would do nothing to limit the potential for contaminant 
mobility or migration. 

Short-Term Effectiveness. Since no remedial activities are conducted, there would 
be no short-term impacts to workers, the public, or the environment. 

Implementability. There are no practical impediments to implementation of this 
alternative. However, there are administrative considerations that may impact its overall 
implementability. Among these considerations are: regulatory preference for cleanup; the 


JM.67062.45.OU4.Fjnat FS.11/93 4-19 



4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


potential for future use restrictions to be imposed as a result of the continued existence of 
contamination at the ADA; and potential liabilities associated with the continued presence 
of UXO on the surface or in the subsurface. 

Cost. The immediate costs for implementing the No Action alternative would be 
minimal. However, because the site could pose unacceptable risks to future industrial or 
residential users, the Army might be required to retain ownership of the ADA and provide 
long-term monitoring and management. These costs, while potentially substantial, have 
not been estimated in this FS because of their indefinite nature. 

4.2.3 Alternative 2: Institutional Control and UXO Clearance 

4.2.3.1 Description of Alternative. This alternative provides for various degrees of 
clearance of UXO from the ADA. Three options are evaluated: 

• Option A-Smface clearance 

• Cation B-Clearance to a depth of 1 foot 

• Cation C-Clearance to a depth of 5 feet 

Each of these options is described in Section 4.2.1.2, Clearance of Unexploded 
Ordnance (UXO). 

It is assumed for this analysis that each of these options would be applied across the 
entire 1,750-acre ADA site. It is unlikely that UXO are present either on the surface or in 
the subsurface across this entire area. However, since the locations and frequency of 
occurrence of UXO at the ADA are unknown, requirements for clearance are 
conservatively assumed to encompass the entire 1,750 acres. 

This alternative provides for reductions in the safety risks associated with potential 
exposure to UXO - it does not provide for any action to be taken with respect to chemical 
contamination of the ADA soils. Natural recovery of the contaminated soil is unlikely at 
the ADA due to the characteristics of the dominant contaminants. The contaminants are 
nonvolatile and therefore their volatilizadon from soil at ambient temperatures is unlikely. 
In addition, due to the low organic content of the ADA soils as well as the relative 
resistance of the contaminants to biodegradation, degradation of the contaminants is 
unlikely. The primary mechanism that may serve to reduce contaminant concentrations is 
their dispersion (and resulting dilution) by wind. This mechanism is applicable to surface 
soils only. 

The p rimar y route of migration of contaminants in soil at the ADA is through windblown 
dust This dtemative would do nothing to limit the potential for contaminant migration.

4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


4.2.3.2 NCP Criteria Analysis. The degree to which this alternative satisfies the 
seven threshold and primary balancing criteria of the NCP is discussed below. 

Overall Protection of Human Health and the Environment. This alternative 
provides for a degree of reduction of safety risks associated with potential exposure to 
UXO. However, in^lementation of the alternative does nothing to enhance protection of 
adjacent communities, the environment, or future land users with respect to Ae risks and 
hazards associated with chemically contaminated soil. 

This alternative would present only a minimal risk of exposure to chemically 
contaminated soils by UMDA personnel during routine site activities. The site is 
removed from areas of active use, so direct contact with soils would not be expected. 
However, exposure via the air pathway would be of concern due to the potential for 
windblown dust at the ADA. 

Compliance with ARARs. This alternative would not comply with either state or 
federal ARARs regarding soil remediation. The excess cancer risk values at some sites 
would exceed the acceptable range of 1 x 1(H to 1 x 10-6 as stated in the NCP (40 CFR 
300.430[e][2} [i][A][2]). Likewise, the state of Oregon requires a cleanup to background 
or, when background is not feasible, to that lowest level that is protective of human 
health and the environment while cost effective. This alternative does not demonstrate a 
remedial effort that results in protection of human health or the environment beyond that 
achieved by reducing the levels of surface and subsurface UXO. 

The clearance of UXO to the degrees specified in this alternative would comply with the 
proposed standards presented in Figure 2-4. 

Long-Term Effectiveness. This alternative provides no long-term protection of 
human health and the environment from the risks and hazards associated with chemically 
contaminated soil, and the potential for direct exposure to future site users remains. The 
clearance of UXO will permanently reduce the risks associated with their presence at the 
ADA. 

Reduction in Toxicity, Mobility, and Volume. This alternative achieves little, if 
any, reduction in the toxicity, mobility, or volume of the chemical contaminants present 
in ADA soils. The volume of contaminants as represented by UXO would be reduced. 

The primary route of migration of contaminants in soil at the ADA is through windblown 
dust. This alternative would do nothing to limit the potential for chemical contaminant 
mobility or migration. 

Short-Term Effectiveness. Risks associated with the clearance of UXO will be 
minimized by control of the area and the use of experienced personnel thoroughly trained 
in explosive safety. 


JM.67062.45.0U4.Final FS.11/93 4-21 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


The objectives of each of the options could be reached in a relatively short time period 
ranging from 4 to 20 months. 

Implementability. There are no practical impediments to implementation of this 
alternative. However, there are administrative considerations that may impact its overall 
implementability. Among these considerations are: regulatory preference for cleanup; the 
potential for future use restrictions to be imposed as a result of the continued existence of 
contamination at the ADA; and potential liabilities associated with the continued presence 
of UXO in the subsurface. 

Surface and subsurface clearance of UXO has been demonstrated. There is a competitive 
field of firms that specialize in UXO clearance. 

Cost. Cost estimates developed for this alternative were made based on engineering 
calculations, vendor estimates, and other documented sources. A summary of capital and 
O&M costs for the implementation of the options of Alternative 2 is presented in 
Table 4-1. 

4.2.4 Alternative 3: Institutional Control, UXO Clearance, and Containment 

4.2.4.1 Description of Alternative. This alternative involves the imposition of 
institutional controls on the ADA to limit access to (and future use of) the area. The 
issues and implications of institutional controls are described in Section 4.2.1.1, 
Institutional (Controls. In addition to the imposition of institutional controls, this 
alternative involves the clearance of UXO to the degree necessary to allow installation of 
the cap or cover (assumes clearance to 5 feet at chemically contaminated areas). The final 
part of this alternative involves the contairunent of contaminated soil at the ADA by the 
use of a soil cover with vegetation or a clay/soil cap with vegetation. 

The p rimar y purposes of containment of contaminated soil at the ADA by the use of a soil 
cover or an engineered (i.e., clay/soil) cap are to minimize direct contact with 
contaminated soil and r^uce the mobility of the contaminants by preventing their 
dispersion as windbome dust. A secondary benefit to a soil cover or cap would be the 
limitation of infiltration from precipitation. 

The soil cover undo* consideration consists of an 18-inch layer of clean soil obtained 
fix)m uncontaminated areas at UMDA. The clay/soil cap consists of a 24-inch layer of 
clay covered by 18 inches of soil and gravel. 

Activities involved in placing either the soil cover or clay/soil cap include clearing, 
grubbing, and grading. Once the soil or clay has been placed, it is compacted to the 
maYimiim extent possible and vegetation is placed over the cover or cap.

4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


4^.4.2 NCP Criteria Analysis. 

Overall Protection of Human Health and the Environment. The potential for 
presence of the UXO in the subsurface of the ADA will require that institutional controls 
be applied to prevent any subsurface disturbance that could uncover buried UXO. This 
essentially eliminates the potential for any future use of the area other than limited use for 
military purposes (e.g., as a firing range). The containment of contaminated soils by the 
placement of a soil cover or clay cap would minimize the exposure of military personnel 
to the contaminants as well as prevent the spread of contaminants as windbcwne dust 
Because of the limite d activity imposed by the institutional controls, it would be expected 
that the lifetime of a soil cover or clay cap would be increased with minimal long-term 
maintenance or monitoring required. 

It is expected that containment by a soil cover or clay cap would allow for protection of 
human health and the environment by reducing the potential for direct contact as well as 
dispersion of the contaminants as windbome dust. 

Compliance with ARARs. The use of containment techniques comply with chemical- 
specific ARARs with respect to prevention of exposure to unacceptable levels of 
contamination. HowevCT, the techniques do not satisfy the statutory preference for 
treatment Since little or no natural attenuation is expected to occur with time, the levels 
of contamination would essentially remain unchanged. 

The activities involved in the implementation of Alternative 3 would not be expected to 
affect protected species present at the UMDA facility, nor affect any off-site designated 
wetlands. 

All actions associated with this alternative can be adequately controlled so that action- 
specific ARARs can be met Dust emission sources will be monitored during the 
handling of the soils and clays to be used for covers or caps. Since the contaminated soil 
is not excavated and removed, RCRA LDR requirements do not apply. 

The continued presence of UXO at the surface and in the subsurface would require that 
institutional controls to restrict access and limit use be maintained. 

Long-term Effectiveness and Permanence. Under normal circumstances, soil 
covers or caps are not considered to be either long-term or permanent solutions to the 
spread of contamination. However, through the imposition of institutional controls (i.e., 
fencing and future use restrictions) to limit future activities at the ADA, it is expected that 
the long-term effectiveness and permanence of these methods of containment will be 
significantly increased. 

Since only a limited level of UXO clearance would be performed to allow installation of 
the cap or cover, clearance would not provide along-term, permanent solution to the 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


presence of UXO. The long-tenn and permanent application of institutional controls, 
however, would provide for protection of human health and safety. 

Reduction of Toxicity, Mobility, and Volume. The use of soil covers or caps 
does not affect the toxicity or volume of contaminants. Containment by covers or caps 
does decrease the mobility of the contaminants by providing barriers to their 
dissenoination as windbome dust as well as providing a barrier to water infiltration. 

There is no aspect of this alternative that provides for treatment of the contaminated soil; 
therefore, this alternative does not satisfy statutory preference for treatment as a principal 
element of a remedial activity. 

Short-term Effectiveness. The protection of the environment, the surrounding 
community, and workers during implementation of this alternative can be maintained by 
q)plying adequate controls during the handling of soil and clay materials. Additional 
protection of the environment from adverse impact will be ensured by the restoration of 
the contained areas to near-natural conditions by planting vegetation over the covers or 
caps. 

Risks associated with the clearance of UXO will be minimized by control of the area and 
the use of experienced personnel thoroughly trained in explosive safety. 

The time required to implement this alternative is estimated at eight months. 

Implementability. The technical feasibility of the actions involved in the 
implementation of this alternative has been demonstrated. 

Materials and services for the installation of soil covers and engineered caps are readily 
available. Their installation is performed with conventional e^th moving, loading and 
compaction equipment and little or no specialized expertise is required. 

There is a competitive field of firms that specialize in the clearance of UXO. 

Cost. Cost estimates developed for this alternative were made based on engineering 
calculations, vendor estimates, other documented sources, and experience. A summary 
of capital and O&M costs for the implementation of the various options of Alternative 3 is 
presented in Table 4-2. A detailed breakdown of these costs is provided in Appendix C. 

4.2.5 Alternative 4: On-Site Treatment by Solidification/Stabilization

to be subjected to solidification/stabilization. Other options reflect the ultimate disposal of 
the treat^ solids including: (1) on-site disposal in the existing active landfill; (2) on-site 
disposal in a new landfill; and (3) off-site disposal in a solid waste landfill. 

A discussion of the soil washing process is provided in Section 4.2.1.4, Soil Washing to 
Reduce Contaminated Soil Volume. The solidification/stabilization process is described 
in Section 4.2.1.5, Solidification/Stabilization. A description of on-site disposal of 
treatment residues is provided in Section 4.2.1.6, On-Site Landfill Disposal of 
Nonhazardous Soil and/or Treatment Residues. Aspects of the implementation of those 
processes that are specific to this alternative arc discussed below. 

Qearance of UXO will be performed as necessary to permit excavation of contaminated 
soil. 

Integration of Processes. Schematics of the integration of the various processes and 
options involved in this alternative are presented in Figures 4-5 and 4-6. For the 
purposes of this analysis, it is assumed-that prctreatment by soil washing (for those 
options involving pretreatment) will be completed prior to the startup of the 
solidification/stabilization process. By staging the operations in this manner, operation of 
the solidification/stabilization process can be conducted independently of soil washing 
allowing for a continuity of feed to the process. 

Procurement, site preparation, and treatability testing required for the 
solidification/stabilization process can occur during the time of pretrcatment by soil 
washing. 


4^.5.2 NCP Criteria Analysis. The results of an evaluation of Alternative 4 with 
respect to the screening criteria described in Section 4.1, CERCLA Evaluation Criteria arc 
provided below. 

Overall Protection of Human Health and Environment. This alternative would 
provide for overall protection of human health and the environment and meet the 
Remedial Action Objectives by immobilizing the contaminants of concern. 
Solidification/stabilization of contaminated soil would result in immobilization of metals. 
The degree to which organic contaminants would be immobilized would require 
determination in treatability testing. The treated product wiU be removed to a solid waste 
landfill which will provide for continued protection of human health and environment. 

Protection of human health and the environment during remediation would be achieved 
by: 


Adherence to design and operating controls for each of the remedial processes to 

optimize performance and minimize emissions

4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


• Assurance that occupational risks to workers are minimized through proper training 

and adherence to the site Health and Safety Plan 

The permanent application of institutional controls to limit access to, and future use of, 
the ADA would provide long-term and permanent protection of human health and safety 
with respect to the presence of UXO. 

Compliance with ARARs. Alternative 4 would be expected to meet all ARARs, 
specifically: 

The removal of contaminated soils from the ADA would meet chemical-specific ARARs 
at that area. Subsequent treatment by solidification/stabilization would further increase 
adherence to ARARs by immobilizing metal contaminants. The degree to which the metal 
contaminants are immobilized would require confirmation through conducting analyses 
and TCLP of the treated product. The ability of solidification/stabilization to immobilize 
organic contaminants is less certain but could be confirmed during the conduct of 
treatability testing. 

The processes involved in Alternative 4 would not be expected to affect protected species 
present at the UMDA facility, nor affect any off-site designated wetlands. 

All actions associated with this alternative can be adequately controlled so that action- 
specific ARARs can be met. Dust emission sources will be monitored during soil 
excavation and handling. Disposal of the treated material will be subject to testing to 
ensure that adequate contaminant immobilization has occurred to conform to requirements 
under RCRA. 

The continued presence of UXO at the surface and in the subsurface would require that 
institutional controls to restrict access and limit use be maintained. 

Long-Term Effectiveness and Permanence. Solidification/stabilization will result 
in immobilization or containment of the metal contaminants. This will reduce the risks 
and hazards associated with handling and transporting the material. The treated product 
will be removed from the site and disposed of in a solid waste landfill, which will 
provide additional protection over the long-term. The mobility of organic contatmnants 
aftCT solidification is unknown and would require determination during treatability 
testing. 

The permanent application of institutional controls to limit access to, and future use of, 
the ADA would provide long-term and permanent protection of human health and safety 
with respect to the presence of UXO. 

Reduction of Toxicity, Mobility, or Volume. The solidification/stabilization 
process considered for use in this alternative will reduce the mobility of metal 


JM.67062.45.OU4.Pinal FS.11/93 4-30 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


contaminants. It is assumed that the mobility of organic contaminants will be reduced; 
however, the degree to which this is true will require determination by treatability testing. 
The disposal of the treated material in a suitable solid waste landfill will further reduce the 
potential for contaminant mobility. 

The process will not reduce contaminant toxicity and the total volume of waste requiring 
disposal will be increased due to the solidification/stabilization process. 

Short-Term Effectiveness. Remedial operations will involve activities that present 
potential risks and hazards to workers. These activities include soil excavation and 
handling, heavy equipment use, and solidification/stabilization process operation. 
Despite these risks and hazards, adequate worker protection can be maintained through 
the adherence to: site safety plans; standard health and safety protective measures; and 
monitoring guidelines. Worker protection has been demonstrated for 
solidification/stabilization processes in previous remedial activities. Appropriate dust 
controls will be used to ensure that effects to the environment are not significant. 

The isolation of the remedial operations will ensure that the community will be protected 
fiom remedial activities including excavation, on-site movement of contaminated 
materials, and the solidification/stabilization process. 

Off-site transport of treated material will present the most significant source of potential 
exposure to the community. However, the material at this stage is expected to be non- 
hazardous. In addition, proper equipment for off-site transportation will be used and the 
material will be covered to prevent release of any of the treated product 

The total time to implement this alternative ranges fiom 12 months (for Alternatives 4C 
and 4D) to 15 months (for Alternatives 4A and 4B). 

Implementability. The use of soil washing as a pretreatment is an innovative 
technology and, as such, its demonstrated effectiveness is not as well established as 
other, less innovative technologies. Although solidification/stabilization has proven 
capable of immobilizing metal contaminants, treatabiliQr studies will be required to 
provide for a final determination of the feasibility of the process on ADA soils that 
contain metals and/or organics. The final treated product will require testing to assure 
that the maximum potential for contaminant immobility is achieved and can be 
maintained. 

With the exception of soil washing, services and materials for all remedial activities 
involved in this alternative arc readily available. As an innovative technology, there arc a 
limited number of firms that have demonstrated soil washing capabilities. There are 
several firms that supply transportable, turnkey, systems for complete treatment by 
solidification/stabilization. 


JM.67062^.OU4.Rnat FS.11/93 4-31 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


Cost. Cost estimates developed for this alternative were based on engineering 
calculations, vendor estimates, other documented sources, and experience. The cost of 
implementation of the solidification/stabilization process will be dependent on the results 
of treatability studies. 

A summary of capital and O&M costs for the implementation of the various options of 
Alternative 4 is presented in Table 4-3. A detailed breakdown of these costs is provided 
in Appendix C. 

4.2.6 Alternative 5: On-SIte Treatment by Incineration and 
Solldificatlon/Stablllzatlon 

4.2.6.1 Description of Alternative. The core of this alternative includes the use of 
two primary technologies to treat contaminated soils at the ADA: incineration and 
solidification/stabilization. In addition, options are presented that make use of soil 
washing to reduce the volume of soil to be subjected to the primary treatment 
technologies. Clearance of UXO will be performed as necessary to permit excavation of 
contaminated soil. 

Rotary kiln incineration is used to treat soils (and/or fines) contaminated with both metals 
and organic conta minan ts (pesticides and explosives). A solidification/stabilization 
process will be used to treat incinerator residues (ash and particulate removed in the air 
pollution control system) and soils (and/or fines) contaminated with metals only. Once 
analysis of the treated material has verified the effectiveness of the treatment in meeting 
established standards, the treated material would be disposed of: (1) off site in a solid 
waste landfill; (2) on site in the existing active landfill; or (3) on site in a new landfill. 
Schematics of the integration of the processes and various options associated with this 
alternative are presented in Figures 4-7 and 4-8. 

A discussion of the soil washing process is provided in Section 4.2.1.4, Soil Washing to 
Reduce Contaminated Soil Volume. The solidification/stabilization process is described 
in Section 4.2.1.5, Solidification/Stabilization. The incineration process is described 
below. 

Incineration. Based on an economic analysis performed for the Army, the use of a 
transportable incinCTator as opposed to a field erected incinerator is generally more cost 
effective at sites with less than 130,0(X) yd^ of soil to be treated49. Since transportable 
rotary kiln incinerators have been used successfully in full-scale remediations of 
explosive-contaminated soil at two Army installations, such a system will form the basis 
of the incineration portion of this alternative. 

Transportable incineration systems are available in a range of sizes with varying feed 
rates. This analysis will assume that a transportable unit with a nominal feed rate of 4 
tons/hr will be used.

4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


The transportable incineration system consists of the following elements: 

• Feed system 

• Incineration system including a primary chamber (kiln) and a secondary 
chamber(afteAumer) 

• Air pollution control system 

• Ash collection and handling system 

Feed System. Once excavated, the contaminated soil would be placed on a temporary 
storage pad in the feed staging area. The stockpiled soil would be covered to protect it 
fiom precipitation and to prevent its dispersion by wind. 

Large rocks and debris would be screened as necessary to preclude damage to the 
incinerator equipment. Removed rocks or debris would be washed with watCT to remove 
any contaminated soil. The volume of washwater generated in this manner is expected to 
be very low compared to the total volume of incinerator feed, and may therefore be 
incorporated into the feed with little or no impact on the incineration process. 

From the storage pad, the soil would be staged by bulk loading equipment to the 
incinerator feed area. Since explosives will be present in the feed material, care will be 
required to eliminate any potential for accumulation or confinement of explosives. This 
analysis assumes a representative feed system consisting of a metered live bottom 
hopper, a screw or belt conveyor to transfer the soil from the hopper to the kiln feed 
system; and a screw or belt conveyor to feed the soil into the kiln. 

Incineration System. The primary chamber of the incineration system is the rotary kiln, a 
rotating, refractory-lined, cylindrical vessel mounted at a slight incline to the horizontal. 

The kilns are designed to provide a sufficient residence time to effectively treat the soil. 
Design factors that specify the residence time include the soil feed rate, kiln rotation rate, 
and the physical dimensions of the kiln. 

The kiln is typically designed for steady-state operation at 1,200®F to 1,8(X)®F. A control 
system is typically used to automatically maintain primary combustion chamber 
temperatures within the design range for the particular waste to be treated. A minimum of 
100 percent excess air is typical. 

The secondary chamber, or afterburner, is a stationary, refractory-lined cylinder. The 
afterburner design temperatures are higher than those for the kiln, in a range of 1,700 to 
2,400 ®F. As with the kiln, temperatures in the secondary chamber are controlled 
automatically. A minimum of 100 percent excess air is usually input to the secondary 
chamber. Hot gases fiom the secondary chamber are typically quenched to reduce their 
temperature prior to further treatment. 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


Air Pollution Control (APC) System. The incinerator APC system is composed of wet 
and/or dry scrubbing processes designed to remove products of incomplete combustion, 
particulates, and acid gases from the flue gas exiting the secondary combustion chamber. 

An example of a wet scrubbing system is a venturi scrubber charged with lime or caustic 
and water solutions. When the contaminants to be removed are nonhalogenated, these 
systems are typically designed so that the aqueous wastes from the scrubber can be 
neutralized, ^tered, and recycled, thereby minimizing or eliminating wastewater 
discharges A dry scrubbing system often uses a fabric filter to catch solids and 
particulate. 

It is assumed that any incinerator selected to remediate the soils at the ADA would be 
equipped with an APC system that would meet local, state, and federal air emissions 
standards. 

Ash Handling and Collection System. The solids that exit the primary and secondary 
combustion chambers are referred to as ash. The ash is typically collected using a wet 
ash system in which the hot ash exiting the chambers is quenched with water. Excess 
water may be recycled to minimize wastewater discharges. 

Since all of the contaminated soil contains metals, the ash (including solids from the kiln 
and particulates from the APC system) will be subjected to solidification/stabilization 
prior to final disposition. 

Site Suitability. The selection of the incineration site would be based on the following: 

• The site needs to contain sufficient land area to provide a concentric ring of 
unoccupied space as a buffer zone between the excavation and incineration areas, 
and the nearest area of human activity, 

• Access roads must be available and capable of supporting the 60,000 lb incinerator 
trailers and heavy earthmoving equipment. 

• Accessibility to the waste feed material must be direct and unencumbered. 

Temporary covers would be provided for the contaminated soil and the treated soil 
stoclq)iled in the holding area. 

Based on the above, the total area requirements for the 4 ton per hour incineration system 
would be approximately 87,000 ft2 (2 acres). 

In addition to the area actually required for the incineration system, access roads would 
be required to connect the treatment area with existing roads. 


JM.67062.4S.OU4.RnaI FS. 11/93 4-37 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


Utilities. Utility requirements for operation of the incineration system described above 
include: 

• A continuous water supply to furnish charge and makeup water to the scrubber 
system. Evaporative losses are assumed to be approximately 70 gpm. For the 
purposes of analysis, it is assumed that this water will be available from installation 
sources. However, if supplies at the treatment site are insufficient, an alternate 
supply (from on ot off the installation) will be required. 

• Electrical service of2,000 kVA, 480 V, and 3 phases is required as the power 
source for the primary combustion chamber, fans and pumps. In addition, the 
operation of ancillary operation and support systems will require 15 amp, 120-V, 
1-phase service. For the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that these electrical 
requirements can be met on the installation. 

• Propane equivalent to about 4 million BTU/hr. This will have to be brought onto 
the site as it is unavailable at the installation. 

• Water treatment chemicals, as required. 

• Fuel oil for feed heating value improvement, as necessary. 

Personnel. The total number of operating personnel required for such a transportable 
incineration system is 30 to 35. These numbers include process operators, supervisors 
including a shift foreman, a maintenance supervisor, construction operators (as r^uired), 
administrative staff and a project manager. Operations are conducted in 2 or 3 shifts, 

24 hours per day, 7 days per week. 

Performance Testing. Waste characterization and treatability testing are necessary to 
establish the suitability of the contaminated soil feed and the range of recommended 
operating parameters for the incineration system. This will ensure optimum incinerator 
performance to maintflin regulatory compliance. Test phases required include: 

• Laboratory analysis of waste feed. Required to evaluate physical and chemical 
properties critical to the operation of the incineration system (including feed 
preparation, feed to incinerator, incineration, air pollution control, and residue 
management). Such properties include density, moisture content, heating value, 
ash content, particle size, organic and inorganic species identification and 
quantification. 

• Trial bum in accordance with regulatory requirements to ensure that required 
operating and emission standards are attainable and maintained. 


JM.67062.45.0U4.Final FS.11/93 4-38 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


Implementation and Treatment Time. For the purpose of this analysis, it is assumed that 
one year is required to complete all preparations (including procurement) prior to 
mobilizing the incinerator system on-site. A transportable system will require 3 to 8 
weeks to mobilize42. 

The time required to conduct and analyze trial bums will be dependent on the specific 
regulatory requirements and, in some cases, initial results. A typical RCRA trial bum 
would include three 4-hour bums. For the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that 
the entire trial bum period will require approximately four weeks; this includes planning, 
preparing, conducting the trial bums and analyzing the results. 

Integration of Processes. For the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that 
incineration of the explosive and pesticide contaminated soil will be completed prior to the 
startup of the solidification/stabilization process. By staging the operations in this 
manner, operation of the solidification/stabilization process can be conducted 
independently of incineration, allowing for a continuity of feed to the process. 

Procurement, site preparation, and treatability testing required for the 
soUdification/stabilization process can occur during the time of operation of the 
incinerator. 


4.2.6.2 NCP Criteria Analysis. The results of an evaluation of Alternative 5 with 
respect to the screening criteria described in Section 4.1, CERCLA Evaluation Criteria, 
are provided below. 

Overall Protection of Human Health and Environment. This alternative would 
provide for overall protection of human health and the environment and meet the 
Remedial Action Objectives by destroying or immobilizing the contaminants of concern. 
Incineration of the organic-contaminated soil would result in at least a 99.99 percent 
reduction in contaminants with final concentrations below detection limits. 
Solidification/stabilization of metals-contaminated soil and incinerator residues would 
result in immobilization of metals. The treated product will be removed to a solid waste 
landfill, which will provide for continued protection of human health and environment. 

Protection of human health and the environment during remediation would be achieved 
by: 

* Adherence to design and operating controls for each of the remedial processes to 
optimize performance and minimize emissions 

• Isolation of the various remedial activities from populated areas 

♦ Assurance that occupational risks to workers are minimized through proper training 
and adherence to the site Health and Safety Plan 


JM.67062.45.OU4.Final FS. 11/93 4-39 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


The permanent application of institutional controls to limit access to, and future use of, 
the ADA would provide long-term and permanent protection of human health and safety 

with respect to the presence of UXO. 

Compliance with ARARs. Alternative 5 would be expected to meet all ARARs. 
Removal of contaminated soils fiom the ADA will allow chemical-specific ARARs to be 
met at that area. Furthermore, incineration and solidification/stabilization would be 
expected to meet the requirements for reduction of contaminants to background levels, 
whether it be by co ntaminan t destruction (incineration) or immobilization 
(so1idific?^ti on /gta hili7jtti nn). This would require confirmation through conducting 
analyses and TCLP with the resulting product fiom the solidification/stabilization 
process. 

The processes involved in Alternative 5 would not be expected to affect protected species 
present at the UMDA facility, nor affect any off-site designated wetlands. 

Incineration has been proven for the destruction of explosives and pesticides. Given the 
relatively low concentrations of these contaminants in ADA soils, it is expected that the 
treatment standards can be met. Air emissions firom all operations involved in the 
remediation are expected to meet their respective ARARs providing that operating Md 
control procedures are maintained in accordance with established guidelines. Monitoring 
of emissions from the incinerator stack will be conducted to ensure compliance. 

The continued presence of UXO at the surface and in the subsurface would require that 
institutional controls to restrict access and limit use be maintained. 

Long-Term Effectiveness and Permanence. Incineration of organic-contaminated 
soil has proven successful in meeting required process efficiencies and performance 
specifications. TTie OTgaitic contaminants are destroyed in incineration and therefore, 
represent no short or long-term hazards. Residues from the incineration process are 
further treated to immobilize metal contaminants, increasing the assurance that the 
incinerated material poses no risks or hazards from any residual organic contamnants. 
All treated materials and residues are removed from the site so no associated risks will 

remain at the site. 

Solidification/stabilization will result in immobilization or containment of the metal 
contaminants in soil and incinerator residues. This will reduce the risks and hazards 
associated with handling and transporting the material. The treated product will be 
removed from the site and disposed of in a suitable solid waste landfill, which will 
provide additional protection over the long-term. 

The permanent application of institutional controls to limit access to, and future use of, 
the ADA would provide long-term and permanent protection of human health and safety 
with respect to the presence of UXO. 



JM.67062.45.OU4.Final PS.11/93 4-40 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


Reduction of Toxicity, Mobility, or Volume. Because incineration of the 
OTganic-contaminated soil will result in a destruction of the organic contaminants, a 
reduction in contaminant toxicity is expected. In addition, incineration will moderately 
reduce the total volume of organic-contaminated waste. 

Solidification/stabilization will reduce the mobility of the metal contaminants. The 
disposal of the treated material in a suitable solid waste landfill will further reduce the 
potential for c ontaminan t mobility. The process will not reduce contaminant toxicity and 
the total volume of waste will be increased due to the solidification/stabilization process. 

Short-Term Effectiveness. Remedial operations will involve activities that present 
potential risks and hazards to workers. These activities include soil excavation and 
handling, heavy equipment use, incinerator operation, and solidification/stabilization 
process operation. Despite these risks and hazards, adequate worker protection can be 
maintain^ through the adherence to site safety plans, standard health and safety 
protective measures, and monitoring guidelines. Worker protection has been 
demonstrated for all of the operations in previous remedial activities. 

The isolation of the remedial operations will ensure that the community will be protected 
from remedial activities including excavation, on-site movement of contaminated 
materials, and the solidification/stabilization process. This isolation, when combined 
with adherence to proper operating conditions of the incineration and ancillary air 
pollution control processes, further assures community protection. 

Off-site transport of treated material will present the most significant source of potential 
exposure to the community. However, the material at this stage is expected to be non- 
hazardous. In addition, proper equipment for off-site transportation will be used and the 
material will be covered to prevent release of any of the treated product 

It is estimated that a total implementation time for contaminated soil without pretreatment 
(Options C and D) will be approximately 20 months. For Options A and B involving 
pretreatment by soil washing, treatment time is estimated at approximately 24 months. 

Implementability. The use of soil washing as a pretreatment is an innovative 
technology and, as such, its demonstrated effectiveness is not as well established as 
other, less innovative, technologies. The technical feasibility of the incineration of 
organic-contaminated soil has been demonstrated and documented. Although 
solidifrcation/stabilization has proven capable of immobilizing metal contaminants, 
treatability studies will be required to provide for a final determination of the feasibility of 
the process on soils and incinerator residues. The final treated product will require 
extensive testing to assure that the maximum potential for contaminant immobility is 
achieved and can be maintained. 


JM.67062.45.OU4.Flnal FS.11/93 4-41 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


With the exception of soil washing, services and materials for all remedial activities 
involved in this alternative are readily available. As an innovative technology, there are a 
limited number of firms who have demonstrated soil washing capabilities. A number of 
fir ms provide capabilities for mobilizing, operating, and demobilizing transportable 
incinerator systems. An increasing number of firms supply transportable, turnkey, 
systems for complete treatment by solidification/stabilization. 

Cost. Cost estimates developed for this alternative were made based on engineering 
calculations, vendor estimates, other documented sources, and experience. The cost of 
implementation of the solidification/stabilization process will be dependent on the results 
of treatability studies. As a result, associated costs should be considered as preliminary 
estimates. 

A summary of capital and O&M costs for the implementation of the various options of 
Alternative 5 is presented in Table 4-4. A detailed breakdown of these costs is provided 
in Appendix C. 

4.2.7 Alternative 6: Off-SIte Treatment and Disposal 

4.2.7. 1 Description of Alternative. The implementation of this alternative 
involves the excavation of soil (as described in Section 4.2.1.3, Soil Excavation), 
segregation of RCRA hazardous and nonhazardous soils, transportation of these soils off 
site for the treatment of the hazardous soil and landfill disposal of the nonhazardous soil. 
Qearance of UXO will conducted as necessary to permit excavation of contaminated soil. 
A general schematic of this alternative is presented in Figure 4-9. 

In this alternative, existing data and additional confirmation sampling and analysis will be 
used to determine the hazardous characteristics of the soil (with respect to the presence of 
toxic concentrations of metals, pesticides, or explosives) and allow for segregation of 
RCRA hazaitious and nonhazardous soil. To the maximum extent possible, segregation 
will occur during excavation with necessary confirmation analyses performed after 
excavation. If the soils are determined to be nonhazardous, they will be transported off 
site for disposal at a solid waste landfill facility. If the soils are hazardous, they will be 
transported off site for treatment at a permitted Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facility 
(TSDF). The latter action will require the preparation of manifests for the transport of 
hazardous material before the soils can be transported off site. 

Personnel requirements for the implementation of this alternative are minimal. Personnel 
will be required to excavate the soil; conduct sampling and analysis of the soil samples; 
prepare manifests as necessary; and load the excavated soil for transport off site. It is 
estimated that eight personnel would be required for these activities and each would 
operate on a one-shift, ten hour per day, five days per week, schedule.

4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


Personnel exposed to contaminated soil are subject to Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) requirements for hazardous waste site operations (29 CFR 
1910.120), including: requirements for personal protective equipment as dictated by the 
specific site conditions and contaminants; physical examinations; and hazardous waste 
site training. 


4^.7.2 NCP Criteria Analysis. The degree to which this alternative satisfies the 

seven threshold and primary balancing criteria of the NCP is discussed in the following 
sections. 

Overall Protection of Human Health and the Environment. The 

implementation of Alternative 6 would provide for overall protection of human health and 
the environment at and meet the remedial action objectives by removing contaminated soil 
that is the source of unacceptable risks and hazards from UMDA. 

Treatment of some of the contaminated soil off site will enhance the protection of human 
health and the environment; however, the lack of treatment of the balance of the 
contaminated soil will not As a result of lack of treatment, no reduction in toxicity or 
volume of contaminants will occur. Furthermore, this lack of treatment does not satisfy 
statutory preference for treatment as a principal element of a remedial activity. 

A reduction in mobility of contaminants will be realized by the disposal of nonhazardous 
soil and treatment products in a properly designed and constructed landfill. 

Near-term protection of the public health and the environment during remediation would 
be achieved directly by using specific design and operating controls to minimize fugitive 
dust emissions. Indirect protection would also be afforded by the distance from the ADA 
to populated areas. 

Occupational risks to on-site workers are expected to be minimized through the use of 
specific operating controls and procedures and appropriate training. Occupational risks 
would be addressed in the project Health and Safety Plan. 

The permanent application of institutional controls to limit access to, and future use of, 
the ADA would provide long-term and permanent protection of human health and safety 
with respect to the presence of UXO. 

Compliance with ARARs. This alternative will comply with the health- and risk- 
based chemical-specific ARARs because all contaminated soil not in compliance with 
these ARARs will be removed from the ADA. Soil exhibiting the toxicity characteristic 
will be treated in accordance with RCRA requirements. 


JM.67062.4S.OU4.FinaJ FS. 11/93 4-45 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


This alternative would comply with location-specific ARARs as it is not expected that 
protected species present at UMDA would be affected nor would any off-site designated 

wetlands be impacted. 

This alternative will involve the removal of contaminated soil from the ADA in 
accordance with all regulatory and other institutional guidelines. Excavation and handling 
of soils will be conducted in accordance with guidelines for dust suppression, thus 
eliminatin g the threat of atmospheric dispersion of fugitive emissions to downwind 
receptors. Manifests will be prepared for the off-site treatment of hazardous soils. 

The continued presence of UXO at the surface and in the subsurface would require that 
institutional controls to restrict access and limit use be maintained. 

Long-Term Effectiveness and Permanence. Because contaminated soil would be 
removed from the ADA, there will be no residual risks at the area. The areas where soil 
is removed will be refilled and restored to surrounding conditions following remediation. 
A five-year review will not be required following contaminated soil removal at the ADA 
as long as unrestricted cleanup levels are achieved. 

Once the contaminated soil has been removed from the ADA and UMDA, the soil 
characterized as nonhazardous will be disposed of in a solid waste landfill. It is expected 
that short- and long-term uncertainties associated with such a disposal will be minimal. 
Soil characterized as hazardous will be treated accordingly at a TSDF that is permitted to 
ensure the maximum protection of human health and the environment 

Reduction of Toxicity, Mobility, and Volume. This alternative results in the 
reduction of the volume of contaminated soils present at the ADA; however, the removal 
of these soils does not itself constitute a reduction in volume of contaminated media. 

Only those soils that exhibit characteristics of a hazardous waste will be treated. It is 
expected that treatment of these soils would result in a reduction of mobility of 
contaminants. Such treatment is unlikely to significantly reduce the toxicity of metal 
contaminants. 

A certain volume of the contaminated soil will not be treated. No reduction in toxicity or 
volume will occur. Furthermore, this lack of treatment does not satisfy statutory 
preference for treatment as a principal element of a remedial activity. 

A reduction in mobility of contaminants will be realized by disposal of nonhazardous soil 
and treatment products in a properly designed and constructed landfill. 

Short-Term Effectiveness. The protection of the environment, the surrounding 
community, and workers during implementation of this alternative can be maintained by 
applying adequate controls during excavation and by adhering to manifesting 
requirements and common sense during off-site transport of the contaminated materials. 


JM.67062.45.CXJ4.Final FS.11/93 4-46 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


Additional protection of the environment from adverse impact will be ensured by 
restoration of the ADA to natural conditions after removal of the contaminated soil. 

The implementation of this alternative is expected to be accomplished within a short time. 
The time to achieve the remedial action objectives is estimated to be approximately 12 
months after contracts are in place for the receipt of soil at the solid waste landfill facility 
and the TSDF. 

Implementability. This alternative for site remediation is a demonstrated technique. 
The alternative has a high level of technical feasibility with no technical difficulties or 
unknowns expected. Equipment and services required for its implementation are readily 
available from a number of sources. 

The level of administrative-related activities from a permitting standpoint is moderate. 
However, obtaining the necessary coordinations and approvals for off-site transportation, 
treatment, and disposal may be a banrier to implementation of the alternative. 

Cost. The cost of inq)lementing this alternative will be dependent on a number of factors 
including the location of the TSDF and the solid waste landfill selected to receive the 
contaminated soil. A summary of estimated capital and O&M costs associated with this 
alternative is presented in Table 4-5. A detailed breakdown of costs is provided in 
Appendix C. 

4.2.8 Alternative 7: On-SIte Treatment and Disposal 

4.2.8.1 Description of Alternative. This alternative involves the on-site 
treatment of hazardous soil by solidification/stabilization (as discussed in Section 
4.2.1.5, Solidification/Stabilization) and the on-site disposal of nonhazardous soils and 
treatment residues in the existing active landfill or in a new engineered landfill (as 
discussed in Section 4.2.1.6, On-Site Landfill Disposal of Soil and/or Treatment 
Residues). Clearance of UXO will be performed as necessary to permit the excavation of 
contaminated soil. A schematic illustrating the activities of this alternative is presented in 
Figure 4-10. 

In this alternative, existing data and additional confirmation sampling and analysis will be 
used to determine the hazardous characteristics of the soil (with respect to the presence of 
toxic concentrations of metals, pesticides, or explosives) and allow for segregation of 
hazardous and nonhazardous soil. To the maximum extent possible, segregation will 
occur during excavation with necessary confirmation analyses performed after 
excavation. If the soils are determined to be nonhazardous, they will be transported on 
site to the existing active landfill (Option 7A(1)) or to a new engineered landfill to be 
constructed on site (Option 7A(2)). If the soils are hazardous, they will be treated by

solidification/stabilization to render them nonhazardous. Treatment residuals will be 
disposed of on site in the active landfill (Option 7A(1)) or in a new on-site landfill 
(Option 7A(2)). 

4.2.8.2 NCP Criteria Analysis. The degree to which this alternative satisfies the seven 
threshold and pnimary balancing criteria of the NCP is discussed in the following 
sections. 

Overall Protection of Human Health and the Environment. The 
implementation of Alternative 7 would provide for overall protection of human health and 
the environment and meet the remedial action objectives by removing contaminated soil 
that is the source of unacceptable risks and hazards from the ADA. 

Treatment of some of the contaminated soil on site will enhance the protection of human 
health and the environment; however, the lack of treatment of the balance of the 
contaminated soil will not. As a result of lack of treatment, no reduction in toxicity or 
volume of contaminants will occur. Furthermore, lack of treatment does not satisfy 
statutory preference for treatment as a principal element of a remedial activity. 

A reduction in mobility of contaminants will be realized by the disposal of nonhazardous 
soil and treatment products in a properly designed and constructed landfill. 

Near-term protection of the public health and the environment during remediation would 
be achieved directly by using specific design and operating controls to minimize fugitive 
dust emissions during excavation and soil handling. Indirect protection would also be 
afforded by the distance from the ADA to populated areas. 

Occupational risks to on-site workers are expected to be minimized through the use of 
specific operating controls and procedures and appropriate training. Occupational risks 
would be addressed in the project Health and Safety Plan. 

The permanent application of institutional controls to limit access to, and future use of, 
the ADA would provide long-term and permanent protection of human health and safety 
with respect to the presence of UXO. 

Compliance with ARARs. This alternative will comply with the health- and risk- 
based chemical-q)ecific ARARs because all contaminate soil not in compliance with 
these ARARs will be removed from the ADA. Soil that exhibits the toxicity characteristic 
will be treated in accordance with RCRA requirements. 

This alternative would comply with location-specific ARARs as it is not expected that 
protected species present at UMDA would be affected nor would any off-site designated 
wetlands be impacted. 


JM.67062.45.OU4.Rnai FS. 11/93 4-50 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


This alternative will involve the removal the contaminated soil from the ADA in 
accordance with all regulatory and other institutional guidelines. Excavation and handling 
of soils will be conducted in accordance with guidelines for dust suppression thus 
eliminating the threat of atmospheric dispersion of fugitive emissions to downwind 
receptors. 

The continued presence of UXO at the surface and in the subsurface would require that 
institutional controls to restrict access and limit use be maintained. 

Long-Term Effectiveness and Permanence. Because contaminated soil would be 
removed from the ADA, there will be no residual risks at the area. The areas where soil 
is removed will be refilled and restored to surrounding conditions following remediation. 
A five-year review will not be required following contaminated soil removal at the ADA 
provided that cleanup is to unrestricted levels. 

Once the contaminated soil has been removed from the ADA it will be treated if it is 
determined to be hazardous. The treatment products will be disposed of on site. It is 
expected that short- and long-term uncertainties associated with such a disposal will be 
minimal; particularly when compared to leaving the hazardous soils in place. Untreated, 
nonhazardous contaminated soil will be disposed of without treatment. The short- and 
long-term uncertainties with the disposal of these untreated materials are expected to be of 
greater concern and will require monitoring and review. 

Reduction of Toxicity, Mobility, and Volume. This alternative results in the 
reduction of the volume of contaminated soils present at the ADA; however, the removal 
of these soils does not itself constitute a reduction in volume of contaminated media. 

Only those soils that exhibit characteristics of a hazardous waste will be treated. It is 
expected that treatment of these soils would result in a reduction of mobility of 
contaminants. Since the soil to be treated will contain metal contaminants, such treatment 
is unlikely to significantly reduce the toxicity of the contaminants. 

A certain volume of the contaminated soil will not be treated. No reduction in toxicity or 
volume will occur. Furthermore, this lack of treatment does not satisfy statutory 
preference for treatment as a principal element of a remedial activity. 

A reduction in mobility of contaminants will be realized by the disposal of nonhazardous 
soil and treatment products in a properly designed and constructed landfill. 

Short-Term Effectiveness. The protection of the environment, the surrounding 
community, and workers during implementation of this alternative can be maintained by 
applying adequate controls during excavation and by adhering to manifesting 
requirements and common sense during off-site transport of the contaminated materials. 
Additional protection of the environment from adverse impact will be ensured by 
restoration of the ADA to natural conditions after removal of the contaminated soil. 


JM.67062.45.OU4.Flnal FS.11/93 4-51 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


The implementation of this alternative is expected to be accomplished within a time period 
of approximately 12 months. 

Implementability. Treatment of soil by solidification/stabilization has been 
demonstrated. Equipment and services required for its implementation are readily 
available from a number of sources. Disposal of treatment residues in the active landfill 
or in a new on-site landfill is expected to be implementable. However, the administrative 
feasibility of disposal of additional quantities of contaminated soil in the active landfill 
and the construction of a new landfill will require a significant level of on-site and off-site 
coordination (including permitting). 

Cost. A summary of capital and O&M costs associated with this alternative is presented 
in Table 4-6. A detailed breakdown of costs is provided in Appendix C. 


4.3 Comparative Analysis of Alternatives 

The comparative analysis of the seven alternatives and options is presented below for 
each of the NCP evaluation criteria. 

4.3.1 Protection of Human Health and the Environment 

Alternatives 4 and 5 provide the best potential for effectively protecting human health and 
the environment. These alternatives provide for the removal of the contaminated soil 
followed by treatment to destroy and/or immobilize the contaminants. Following 
treatment, the treated residuals are placed in a landfill that is, or will be, properly 
maintained, closed, and monitored. Of the various options associated with Alternatives 4 
and 5, those that involve the placement of treatment residuals in an on-site landfill 
(existing active landfill or a new landfill) provide additional protection to human health 
and the environment by eliminating the off-site transport and disposal of these materials. 

Alternatives 6 and 7 provide for a moderate level of protection of human health and the 
environment as they do provide for the treatment of contaminated soils that exhibit the 
toxicity characteristic. However, soils that do not exhibit the toxicity characteristic and 
are thus classified as nonhazardous are disposed of, without treatment, in an off-site 
landfill. Neither of the alternatives provide for an ultimate reduction in contaminant 
toxicity or volume. Treatment of hazardous soils and disposal of treatment products and 
nonhazardous soil in a properly designed and constructed landfill will provide for a 
reduction in contaminant mobility. Alternative 6 provides increased potential for 
protection of human health and the environment through on-site treatment and disposal of 
the contaminated soils thereby eliminating the need for off-site transport, treatment, and 
disposal.

4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


Alternative 3 will achieve protection of human health and the environment by the use of 
soil covers or caps placed over the contaminated soils to prevent the dispersion of 
contaminants in windbome dust and to reduce infiltration. The use of institutional 
measures to control access and future use activities will further provide a level of 
protection. However, this alternative does not remove the source of chemical 
contamination and does not provide for the reduction of toxicity or volume of 
contaminants. This alternative requires the long-term and permanent application of 
monitoring, security, and institutional controls. 

Alternative 2 will provide for a reduction of risks and hazards associated with the 
presence of UXO at the ADA. However, the lack of action taken for the chemical 
contamination of soil would not provide for increased protection human health or the 
environment with respect to preventing exposure to contaminants or the further spread of 
these contaminants as windbome dust. 

Alternative 1 would not provide any protection of human health and the environment over 
the current state of the ADA. Risks and hazards associated with the presence of UXO 
would remain and nothing would be done to prevent exposure to contaminants or the 
further spread of these contaminants as windbome dust. 

4.3.2 Compliance with ARARs 

Alternatives 4,5,6, and 7 would meet chemical- and action-specific ARARs through a 
course of: 

• Removal of UXO to the degree necessary to perform the remedial activities 

• Removal of contaminated soil from the ADA, thereby reducing residual risks to 
required levels 

• Treatment to destroy organic contaminants (Alternative 5) or reduce the mobility of 
metal contaminants (Alternatives 4,5,6, and 7) resulting in residuals that conform to 
regulatory standards 

Alternative 2 will provide for the clearance of UXO to the degree that will allow for 
limited use of the ADA as specified in the TBC proposed standards for clearance. 

Alternatives 1 and 2 will not meet chemical-specific ARARs that require a reduction in the 
levels of contaminants in the soil. Alternative 3 will result in the prevention of exposure 
to unacceptable levels of contamination, but will not reduce the level of contaminants in 
soil. 

4.3.3 Long-Term Effectiveness 

Alternatives 4,5, 6, and 7 provide for the varying degrees of treatment of contaminated 
soil. Uncertainties associated with long-term effectiveness arise due to the ultimate 


JM.67062.45.OU4.Final FS.11/93 4-54 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


disposal of treatment residues and/or nonhazardous contaminated soil. Alternatives 4 and 
5 provide for the lesser degree of uncertainty with respect to ultimate disposal as all 
contaminated soil is treated and only treatment residues are disposed of. Alternatives 6 
and 7 only provide for the treatment of hazardous soil resulting in the need for landfill 
disposal of nontreated, nonhazardous soil in addition to treatment residues. 

Alternative 3 provides only limited assurance that the actions taken will be effective over 
the long term. Soil covers and caps used to contain contamination are typically not 
considered to be either long-term or permanent solutions to contamination or exposure. 
The long-term effectiveness of their use at the ADA, however, is enhanced through the 
application of access and future use controls. 

Alternative 2 would provide for long-term effectiveness with respect to the removal of 
UXO; however, this alternative does not provide for any actions to be taken with respect 
to contaminated soil. 

Alternative 1 does not provide for any actions to be taken and, as such, there is no 
application of Alternative 1 to this criterion. 

4.3.4 Reduction of Toxicity, Mobility, or Volume through Treatment 

Alternatives 3,4,5, 6, and 7 provide for various degrees of reducing the toxicity, 
mobility, and/or volume of contaminants through treatment Alternative 3 will provide a 
reduction in contaminant mobility, but will not reduce contaminant toxicity or volume. 
Alternative 4 will result in the immobilization of contaminants (to be demonstrated in 
treatability testing), however it will not result in a reduction of contaminant toxicity. By 
employing the option of soil washing to initially reduce the volume of contaminated soil, 
this alternative will ultimately result in the reduction of contaminant volume. If the soil 
washing option is not pursued, the total volume will increase as a result of the 
solidification/stabilization process. The implementation of Alternative 5 will result in the 
destruction of organic contaminants and the immobilization of metal contaminants (to be 
demonstrated in treatability testing). As with Alternative 4, the use of soil washing as a 
pretreatment will result in a decrease in the volume of contaminants. Further decreases in 
contaminant volume will be achieved in Altanative 5 through the incineration of material 
containing organic contaminants. 

Alternatives 6 and 7 do not provide for a reduction in toxicity or volume of contaminants 
but do provide a reduction in the mobility of contaminants. These alternatives provide 
only for the treatment of contaminated soil that is classified as hazardous. Other 
contaminated nonhazardous soils are untreated. An additional reduction in contaminant 
mobility may be achieved through the disposal of treatment residues and untreated soil in 
controlled landfills. 

The only means of reducing contaminant toxicity or volume through the application of 
Alternatives 1,2, and 3 is through natural attenuation of the contaminants over time. Due 


JM.67062.45.OU4.FinaI FS. 11/93 4-55 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


to the persistent nature of the contaminants, there is little possibility that natural 
attenuation would ever be complete. 

4.3.5 Short-Term Effectiveness 

Operations associated with Alternatives 2 and 3 are not expected to increase the risks to 
the community since no contaminants will be released to the environment. Risks to 
workers involved in implementing the alternative would be minimized through the use of 
engineering controls and personal protective equipment. Risks and hazards associated 
with UXO clearance will be minimized through the use of trained explosive safety 
personnel and maintaining adequate distances between clearance operations and other 
activities. The maximum effectiveness of Alternative 2 would be achieved in a short 
period of time ranging from 4 to 20 months depending on the degree of UXO clearance 
selected. Alternative 3 would require approximately 15 months. 

Alternatives 4,5,6, and 7 provide the potential for risks to workers and the community 
as they involve the removal, handling, treatment, and transport of contaminated soil and 
treatment residues. Options of Alternatives 4,5, and 6 that involve the removal of 
treatment residues and contaminated soil off site for treatment or disposal provide the 
greatest risk to the community; however, these risks can be minimized through the 
application of appropriate controls. Risks to workers involved in the various activities of 
Alternatives 4,5,6, and 7 will be minimized through the application of proper 
engineering controls and the use of personal protective equipment. The maximum 
effectiveness of Alternatives 4,5,6, and 7 can be achieved within approximately two 
years of their initiation. 

4.3.6 Implementablllty 

The technical feasibility of Alternatives 2 and 3 have been demonstrated. Soil covers and 
caps have been used for years to provide for containment of a variety of material. UXO 
clearance has been practiced for many years at current and former military sites. 

Materials and services required to implement these alternatives are readily available from a 
number of sources. 

Most of the activities involved in Alternatives 4,5,6, and 7 (e.g., soil excavation, soil 
ha ndlin g, transport, treatment by solidification/stabilization and/or incineration, and 
landfill disposal of treatment residues and/or soil) have been demonstrated in remedial 
applications. Services and materials are readily available for their performance. The use 
of solidification/stabilization will require that treatability testing be conducted to ensure 
that it can meet treatment requirements. Options of Alternatives 4 and 5 that involve the 
use of soil washing as a pretreatment to reduce the volume of contaminated soil introduce 
a greater degree of uncertainty with respect to technical feasibility and the availability of 
services and materials. The soil washing process to be used is considered an innovative 
technology and, as such, there have been fewer demonstrations of its use and the 
matftriaig and setvices required for its implementation may be less readily available. 


JM.67062.45.OU4.Flnal FS.11/93 4-56 




4.0 Detailed Analysis of Alternatives 


Uncertainties associated with the administrative feasibility of Alternatives 4,5,6, and 7 
center on those options that involve the transport of treated and untreated materials off 
site. Adequate coordination between on-site and off-site personnel will be required to 
ensure that transportation is performed under compliance and with minimum risk of 
potential on-site and off-site exposure to contamination. Additional administrative 
compliance will be required with respect to the operation of the on-site incinerator 
included as part of Alternative 5. 

4.3.7 Cost 

The capital and operating costs for each of the alternatives and options are presented in 
Table 4-7. In addition, a unit volume cost is provided for those alternatives and options 
that involve treatment of the contaminated soil. 

An additional cost presentation has been prepared to reflect the potential for reduction in 
costs associated with the remedial alternatives and options as a result of cleanup to levels 
that will permit light industrial use with residual risks imposed by soil of 1x10-6 and 
1x10-5 and military use with residual risks imposed by soil of 1x10-6. These costs are 
provided in Table 4-8. For reference, the volumes of affected soil for each of these 
cleanup levels are provided (refer to Section 2.3.2, Estimated Areas and Volumes of 
Contaminated Media Requiring Remediation). 

4.3.8 Remediation of Selected Sites 

Following a discussion between the Army and regulatory agencies, there appear to be six 
sites that require remediation based on risk and hazard levelsSO, These sites were 
identified as having risks greater than 1x10-4 (residential) or hazard quotients in excess of 
1 (residential). An analysis of the remediation of these sites was conducted. 

The sites addressed in this analysis include Sites 15,16,17,19, 31, and 32-11. 
Residential risks and hazards of these sites are presented in Table 4-9. This table also 
presents the affeaed areas and volumes requiring remediation to residential, light 
industrial, and military future use levels. 

Costs developed for each of the remedial alternatives applied to these sites are presented 
in Table 4-10.

Appendix A: 


Environmental Fate and Transport Properties 





Appendix A 


Environmental Fate and Transport Properties 

Potential human and environmental exposure to each of the contaminants of concern is 
influenced by physical/chemical properties and the environmental fate and transport 
properties of each contaminant. Summaries of the important physical/chemical and 
environmental fate parameters for the organic and inorganic contaminants of concern at 
at UMDA are presented in Tables A-1 and A-2 respectively. Fate and transport profiles 
for each of the contaminants of concern are presented in Appendix C of the RA. 

Several of the parameters listed in Tables A-1 and A-2 are used to calculate estimated 
values for other parameters used in the exposure assessment of the RA. For example, 
molecular weight and the octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) were used to 
calculate the chemical-specific dermal permeability constant (Kp); KowS were used to 
calculate plant and animal uptake factors; and Henry’s Law constants were used to 
estimate transfer efficiencies. Other parameters listed in Tables A-1 and A-2 (e.g., 
solubility, vapor pressure, diffusion coefficient, organic carbon partition coefficient, 
and physical state) were not used for risk and hazard calculations, but were useful in 
predicting potential relevant future exposure pathways and helping to link sources with 
currently contaminated media. 

The source of this summary is Section 4.0 of the RA as supplemented by Appendix C 
of the RA.

Site 16 - Contaminated soil volume estimates 

Contaminated soli volume estimates based on the presence of 40 pits and the results of sampling of 10 of the 
40 pits. Each pit Is approximately 15 ft in diameter (surface area of approximately 177 ft2) 

Of 10 samples, R-6 level contamination In 2. 

Therefore, assume that 20% of the 40 pits (total) are contaminated = 8 pits. 

Using contamination profile of existing samples - 
4 pits are contaminated to a depth of 2.5 ft. 

4 pits are contaminated to a depth of 10 ft. 

Of 10 samples, iJ-6 level contamination in 4. 

Therefore, assume that 40% of the 40 pits (total) are contaminated = 16 pits. 

Using contamination profile of existing samples • 

8 pits are contaminated to a depth of 2.5 ft. 

4 pits are contaminated to a depth of 10 ft. 

4 pits are contaminated to a depth of 0.5 ft 

Of 10 samples, U-5 level contamination In 2. 

Therefore, assume that 20% of the 40 pits (total) are contaminated = 8 pits. 

Using contamination profile of existing samples - 
8 pits are contaminated to a depth of 2.5 ft 

Of 10 samples, M level contamination In 1. 

Therefore, assume that 10% of the 40 pits (total) are contaminated = 4 pits. 

Using contamination profile of existing samples -

Areas/depths of contamination: 

Areas A, B, and C reflect contamination In an 
area In which burn pits had been Identified In 
historical photographs. Assume that these pits were 
roughly the same dimension as the other, better defined 
pits (10 X 100) - because of evidence of significant amount 
of grading in the area, assume that each contaminated 
area Is approximately 200 x 20 ft = 4000 sf. Because of 
the presence of additional historical pits, it is assumed 
that the frequency of contamination in this area is greater 
than Indicated by available analyses. For the purposes of 
this estimation, assume that similar contamination to 
areas A, B, and C is triplicated in the northern burn field 
area. A', B', and C have been located In areas adjacent to 
known contaminated areas but within the site boundaries 
and within the area bounded by known uncontaminated

For RI-6, LI-6. and U-5: For M 


31-1 to 5 feet 31-6 at surface 

31-6 at surface 

Assume contamination is iimited to apparent disposai pits (diameter of 15 ft); however, due to grading over 
the years, It is likely that contamination may have spread. Contaminated areas estimated as circular with a 
diameter approximately equal to 2 times apparent pit size. Diameter = 30 feet. Area = 710 sf. 1 circular 
area contaminated to a depth of 5 feet; the other to a depth of 0.5 ft. Since not all pits were sampled, 
assume that contamination similar to A occurs at A* and A*' (located In areas between uncontaminated 
samples.

Responses to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Technical Review 
Comments on Draft Finai Feasibility Study for the Ammunition Demolition 
Area (OU-4) at Umatilla Depot Activity 


Comment 1 

Section 1.2.2.2.12, page 1-24. This section states that the UMDA has RCRA interim 
status for the Open Burning Tray units. Please clarify whether these units will be 
closing. Specify whether the units will follow the RCRA 40 CFR Part 265 closure 
regulations or whether they will be addressed under the CERCLA authority. 

Response 

Based on information provided by the Army, the cited text has been revised to include a 
discussion regarding the operation and closure of these units. These trays currently 
operate under an Air Contaminant Discharge Permit from the ODEQ. The trays will cease 
operation in September 1994 at which time they will be closed under the conditions of the 
permit. However, soil contamination at these sites will be addressed as part of the ADA 
operable unit in this Feasibility Study. Note that operations at Site 16 are currently 
conducted under the same permit and will be subject to the same closure conditions. 

Comment 2 

Section 1.2.3, page 1-29, first paragraph. The text states that additional sampling and 
Malyses are being conducted; however, it is not expected that the results will significantly 
impact the feasibility study. A summary of the data gaps and additional investigations 
currently being conducted should be included in the feasibility study. If the additional 
data change the extent of contamination at the various sites, the contaminated soil volume 
estimates should be revised and included as an appendix to the feasibility study. Also, 
the cost estimates should be revised if the contaminated soil volumes change 
significantly. 

Response 

The cited text has been revised to reflect that additional soil sampling and analyses was 
conducted at Sites 15,17,18, and 19 in order to fill in data gaps. The results of the 
additional analyses are presented in Table B-2 (of Appendix B) and the revised volume 
and area calculations are presented in Table B-1. The resulting revised areas and volumes 
are presented in Table 2-8. The cost of alternative estimates have been revised to reflect 
the volumes and areas presented in Table 2-8. 

Comment 3 

Section 1.2.3, page 1-29, second paragraph. The text states that there was a suspicion 
that contamxnation had migrated through the soil to groundwater at only one site, based 
on a single detection in one sample. Ilie site, well location, contaminant detected and 
concentration should be specified. Also, this statement is inconsistent with the site- 
specific information provided later in sections 1.2.3.1 through 1.2.3.17 which state that 
contaminants were detected in groundwater at sites 8,13,14,15,16,18,19, 31, 38,41, 
55, and 57. The text states that contaminants detected in groundwater included metals. 


JM.UMDAOU4/67O62Respons0 to EPA11/93. 1 




Responses to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Technical Review 
Comments on Draft Final Feasibility Study for the Ammunition Demolition 
Area (OU-4) at Umatilla Depot Activity 


explosives, nitrite and nitrate, and volatile organic compounds. The text should list the 
specific contaminants of concern detected in groundwater rather than just identifying the 
classes of contaminants. These discrepancies and omissions should be corrected. 

Response 

The possible presence of contaminants in ground water is discussed more fully in Section 
I.2.5.4.3. To avoid seeming inconsistency and possible confusion, the reference to the 
“suspicious” sample has been deleted from Section 1.2.3. Further clarification of the 
summary presented in Section 1.2.3.1 through 1.2.3.17 has been included in the 
introductory paragraph to Section 1.2.3. Specifically, reference is made to subsequent 
tables (Tables 1-1 and 1-2) that contain the specific contaminants of concern and related 
analytical results. Section 1.2.3 is provided as a brief summary of the general types of 
contaminants of concern that are present in soil and ground water as determined in the RI 
while acknowledging that more specific information and data are provided in subsequent 
Sections of the FS. 

Comment 4 

Section 1.2.3.1 through 1.2.3.20, page 1-29 through 1-31. The description of the nature 
and extent of contamination at each site should include the areal extent, maximum depth, 
and estimated volume of contaminated media. 

Response 

As stated in the response to Comment 3, Section 1.2.3 is provided as a general summary 
of the results of the RI. To clarify, the development and presentation of the extent, 
depth, and estimated volume of contaminated media as presented in subsequent sections 
of the FS are referenced in the introductory paragraph of Section 1.2.3 to tdlow the reader 
to easily access this information. 

Comment 5 

Table 1-2, page 1-35. It would be helpful if a column with risk-based concentrations (at 
an excess cancer risk level of 1 x 10-6) could be added to the table for screening 
purposes. 

Response 

These data have been added to Table 1-2 for reference.

Responses to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Technical Review 
Comments on Draft Final Feasibility Study for the Ammunition Demolition 
Area (OU-4) at Umatilla Depot Activity 


Comment 6 

Section L2.5.4.2, page 1-46, bulleted list. The risk and hazard sui^ary provided 
herein, lists sites with contaminant concentrations below specified risk and hazard levels. 
A list of sites with contaminant concentrations above the specified action levels should 
also be provided, since the current presentation of site risks and hazards leaves the reader 
guessing about which sites are contaminated and require cleanup. 

Response 

The cited bulleted list has been revised to include those sites at which the specified action 
levels are exceeded. 

Comment 7 

Table 1-7, page 1-48. A column should be added to this table to show the percent of risk 
or hazard quotient contributed by each contaminant. In addition, the table lists the risk at 
several sites as being zero. It is highly unlikely that the risk is zero at these sites. The 
zero risks should be changed to either “NC” (not calculated) because there were no 
toxicity values, or they should be changed to indicate that they are less than a specified 
risk vdue, for example 1 x 10-6. 

Response 

A column has been added to Table 1-7 to present the percent of risk or hazard quotient 
contributed by the specified contaminants. In addition, the risk and hazard values 
presented as 0 have been revised to reflect one of the following: (1) values were not 
calculated due to the absence of toxicity values, (2) calculated rislb were less than 1x10- 
6, or (3) the hazard quotient was calculated as less than 1x10-3. 

Comment 8 

Table 1-9, page 1-52. Several of the risk-based preliminary remedial goals listed in the 
table are not consistent with those provided in the human health baseline risk assessment 
(HHBRA). For example, the residential risk-based concentration listed for aluminum in 
Ae table is 794,(XX) pg/g, but the HHBRA lists a value of 274,(XX) pg/g. These values 
should be verified so they correspond to those presented in the HHBRA, or the text 
should explain the deviation. 

Response 

The PRG provided in Table 1-9 are based on values presented in the Draft Final 
HHBRA. The Final HHBRA was not received from the U.S. Army Environmental 
Center (AEC) in order to allow any revisions to be made. The Final HHBRA is currently

that the only differences are apparently for aluminum (residential - 1x10-6 scenario) and 
2,4,6-TNT (light industrial - 1x10-5 and military -lx 10-6,1 x 10-5 scen^os). Note 
that since aluminum did not contribute to any of the risks or hazards associated with the 
residential use scenario, the remedial quantities and costs for cleanup to the residential 
level will not change from the values presented in the Final FS. Corrections, if any, due 
to the difference in 2,4,6-TNT values will be provided to the regulatory agencies as soon 
as possible. 

Comment 9 

Section 1.2.6, page 1-54. The first paragraph, which discusses the exposure potential 
for indicator species, focuses exclusively on current risks and does not mention potential 
future risks. The feasibility study should at a minimum discuss whether potential future 
exposures and risks are likely to be different from current exposures. If they are 
expected to be different, future exposures should be address^. 

Response 

The only indicator species for which potential future exposures may differ from current 
exposures is the pronghorn. A discussion of this has b^n added to Section 1.2.6.

present FS. 

Comment 13 

Section 2.2.2.3.1, page 2-10 through 2-13. This section addresses the applicability of 
RCRA 40 CFR Part 261, Subpart D listed hazardous waste codes. The first paragraph 
states that listed wastes may have been managed at the sites, but bec. 4 use the RCRA listed 
wastes are only listed for reactivity and the soils no longer meet the definition of 
reactivity, these listed waste codes are not applicable. This section should also be 
amended to determine the applicability of the RCRA P and U-listed waste codes for any 
unused pesticides that may have been disposed of at the sites... 

In addition to the requirements for listed wastes, the RCRA characteristic for reactivity 
would be considered an ARAR for soil with explosives concentrations above 12% or 
unexploded ordnance, once excavated.... 

Response 

As part of the revision of Section 2.2.2, a discussion of the applicability of RC^ P and 
U-listed waste codes is presented. In addition, the applicability of the characteristic for 
reactivity to soil and UXO is discussed. 

Comment 14 

Section 2.2.2.3.1, pages 2-10 through 2-13. This section addresses the applicability of 
RCRA 40 CFR Section 261.24 toxicity characteristic hazardous waste codes to the 
contaminated soils. Two toxicity characteristic wastes are identified: D006 (cadmium) 
and D008 Oead). A number of other toxicity characteristic constituents... are also found 
at the sites at very high concentrations in some instaiices... An explanation of the 
screening and elimination process applied to all toxicity characteristic constituents should 
be included. 

Response 

The discussion of applicability of RCRA to contaminated soils as presented in Section 
2.2.2 has been expanded to include the potential applicability due to the presence of a 
number of heavy metals at the ADA. Only limited analyses were performed in the RI to 
determine the applicability of RCRA to heavy metal-contaminated soil. 
Acknowledgement of the need for further determination to assess applicability is 
presented in Section 2.2.2.

Comment 15 

Section 2.2.2.3.I., page 2-10, last paragraph. Concentrations of lead are reported in 
pg/g and mg/g. This paragraph states that soil with lead concentrations of greats than 
900 m^g will be assumed to exhibit the toxicity characteristic for lead. It appears that the 
value should be 900 pg/g. This inconsistency should be corrected.

The correct value is 900 pg/g. This typographical error has been coifrected.

Qtations for the relevant ARARs have been included in this discussion. 

Comment 17 

Section 2.2.4, page 2-18, second paragraph. The remedial action objectives for the ADA 
are presented in this section. The second bullet states that if background or 1 x lO*® total 
excess cancer risks are not feasible, excess cancer risks will be reduced to the lowest 
feasible level, within the range of 1 x 10-5 to 1 x 10-6. It is proposed that the final level 
be determined based on a cost-benefit analysis, which is not described. Since the cost- 
benefit analysis would affect the remedial action and overall cleanup at ADA, the criteria 
and evaluation method to be used for this analysis should be presented. 

Response 

The wording referred to in this comment has been revised to reflect that the final level will 
be determined based on feasibility and cost. This does not necessarily imply the 
performance of a formal cost-benefit analysis; however, it does allow for the decision¬ 
makers to select a proposed remedy based on the feasibility and cost as developed in the 
detailed analysis of alternatives. 

Comment 18 

Section 2.2.4, page 2-18, second paragraph. The third bullet states that the rem^al

limit access to contaminated soils at depth, it is more appropriate to associate this objective 
with residual risks or future land uses than cost feasibility. The future land use of the 
ADA should be determined, and a remedial objective should be added to remediate the 
ADA and to address the ne^s of this future land use. The feasibility study could be 
focused on one of the four future land uses presented:... 

Response 

The wording of this bullet has been revised to reflect that the clearance of UXO is to be 
performed to the degree to minimize risks associated with future use. 

Comment 19 

Section 2.3.2, page 2-21, first paragraph. The text states that the estimated areas and 
volumes of contaminated media requiring remediation are preliminary in nature because of 
the absence of sufficient data to fully delineate the vertical and area extent of 
contamination. Although depth is estimated for the vertical extent of contamination at each 
site, the text does not identify the deepest sample at each site. The vertical extent of 
contamination could be potentially greater if the deepest sample were contaminated and the 
depth of this sample wwe used as the vertical extent of contamination. The method for 
determining the vertical extent of contamination should be more clearly explained. 

Table 2-7 lists the depths of contaminated soil from sample results at each site. The 
depths range from 0 to 10 feet below ground surface G>gs). A 25 percent contingency 
was applied to the soil volumes estimated in Appendix B. However, assuming the same 
horizontal extent, applying the contingency would only account for an increase of the 
vertical extent of less than 1 foot at sites with contamination less than 4 feet bgs, or 2.5 
feet at the site with contamination at 10 feet bgs. Therefore, the contingency factor would 
only account for a small increase in the estimated vertical extent of contamination, and the 
estimated volumes may be significantly ^eater because of uncertainties associated with 
defining the vertical extent of contamination. 

Since increasing the vertical extent of contamination would greatly increase the volume of 
contaminated media and associated treatment costs, and may impact the alternative 
selection, site specific uncertainties should be provided. Then the contingencies included 
to account for the site-uncertainties could be evaluated. 

Response 

To clarify, the maximum depth to which samples were taken (samples that indicated the 
presence of contamination) has been added to Table 2-7. In a majority of the instances, 
the degree of contamination can be identified as being within the depths to which samples 
were analyzed. In addition, the sample depths selected during the W were not random but 
selected based on visible inspection as well as the historical background of the site. It is

acknowledged that there are a few instances in which contamination was detected at the 
deepest sample analyzed; however, a majority of the contamination appears to be located 
in relatively shallow soils. It is felt that die application of an ovCTall uncertainty factor to 
each site adequately accounts for variability (both areal and vertical) that might be present 
in this initial estimation of soil volumes to be remediated and provides for an initial 
estimation of volumes to allow for the conduct of the detailed analysis of alternatives and 
the development of comparative cost estimates. 

Comment 19 

Table 2-7, page 2-22. This table includes site 16 as a site with contaminated soil 
locations; however, the results of the human health baseline risk assessment shown in 
table 1-8 on page 1-50 did not indicate any risk from soil at this site. The reason for 
including site 16 is unclear. Either it should be removed from the table, or a rationale for 
including it should be provided. 

Response 

Site 16 is included as a contaminated soil location due to the fact that the calculated hazard 
quotient for non-groundwater-related pathways is seven which is in excess of one. 

Comment 20 

Section 2.4.2.2.7, page 2-48, second paragraph. The last sentence summarizes EPA’s 
position on solidification and stabilization. Solidification and stabilization processes are 
applicable to soils contaminated with metals and other inorganics, in addition to 
nonvolatile and semivolatile organic compounds. EPA does not currently view the 
process as applicable for remediation of soils contaminated solely with volatile organic 
compounds, because the volatile organic compounds would be released during the mixing 
and curing process... This text should be supported by a published reference or revised.

Response to Comments 21 and 22 

Comments 21 and 22 relate to the clearance of UXO from the ADA to a depth of 20 feet. 
As a result of discussions between the Army, DEQ, and EPA, this alternative has been 
eliminated from consideration. Clearance of UXO to depths suitable for future use 
assuming the application of institutional control has been retained for consideration in the 
FS. 

Comment 23 

Section 4.2.1.4, page 4-11, fourth paragraph. Based on a technology review, the 
feasibility study assumes that soil washing will concentrate the volume of contaminated 
soil to 20 percent of the original soil volume. The text should state whether site-specific 
soil data were considwed during the analysis of soil washing to reach the assumed 80 
percent volume reduction in contaminated soil... 

Response 

The text has been revised to reflect that the 80 percent reduction in soil volume achievable 
by soil washing was based on a review of the technolo^ for use on Deactivation Furnace 
Site soils at UMDA. Although particle size and contantinant distribution analyses were not 
p^ormed on ADA soils, it is assumed for the purpose of this evaluation that ADA soils 
would be similar in nature to the soils at the Deactivation Furnace Site.

segregation of hazardous and nonhazardous soils before treatment or disposal. The 
feasibility study should consider whether existing data could be used or ^ditional data 
collected to characterize soils as hazardous or nonhazardous before excavation, and 
therefore eliminating the need to stockpile large volumes of excavated soils.

Responses to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Technical Review

Response 

The text has been revised to reflect that the segregation of hazardous and nonhazardous 
soils will be based on existing data as well as additional confirmation sampling and 
analyses. Descriptions of alternatives that employ segregation of soils have been revised 
to reflect this. Cost estimates for these alternatives have been revised to include additional 
costs due to sampling. In addition, it is assumed that to the maximum extent possible, 
segregation will occur during excavation with confirmation analyses^performeii after 
excavation. 

Comment 27 

Section 4.3.2, page 4-55 and 4-56, first and second bullets. The comparative analysis for 
compliance with ARARs should note that if UXO clearance is conducted to a depth less 
than the vertical extent of contamination, some of the contaminated soils will be 
inaccessible and remain untreated on site. Therefore, satisfying the compliance with 
ARARs criteria is initially dependent on the degree of UXO clearance that is implemented. 

Response 

The text (and related cost estimates) has been revised as appropriate to reflect that UXO 
clearance will be performed as necessary to permit excavation of contaminated soils. 

Comment 28 

Section 4.3.3., page 4-56, first paragraph. The text states that when combined with 
alternative 3, alternatives 4,5,6, and 7 would provide for permment removal of UXO 
and contaminants from the ADA. Since alternatives 4,5, and 7 include on-site 
solidification and stabilization or landfill disposal, contaminants would remain on site. 
Therefore, only alternative 6 permanently removes UXO and contaminants from the ADA. 

Response 

The cited text has been revised accordingly.

Comment 37 

Appendix C, Tables C-7 through C-21. Contaminated soil volumes estimated in 
Appendix B and summarized in Table C-8 included a 25 percent contingency factor. Cost 
estimates for alternatives 4,5,6, and 7 are based on the estimated volume plus 
contingency; it is estimated that a total of 26,800 cubic yards requires treatnwnt. 

However, additional contingencies for loading and hauling contaminated soils are 
included in the cost estimates and ranged from 20 to 25 percent It should be clarified 
whether these contingencies involve adjusting a clean soil cost estimate with a factor to 
compensate for contaminated soil or involve using an additional contingency factor. 
Finally, overall contingency of 25 percent is applied to the total capital costs and the toM 
operation and maintenance costs. Although this percentage is reasonable for a feasibility 
study estimate, the fact that other contingencies are included makes the overall 
contingency allowance misleading. 

Response 

Appropriate revisions have been made to the text to clarify the difference between factors 
applied as “uncertainties” and factors applied as “contingencies.” The factors applied to 
soil volumes reflect an allowance made for uncertainties involved in the estimation of 
contaminated soil volumes. Contingencies applied to the capital and operation and 
maintenance costs include funds to cover costs resulting from unforeseen circumstances 
(e.g., weather conditions, contaminant not detected during site characterization, labor 
stiikes or delays, etc.).

Review Comments on Draft Final Feasibility Study for the Ammunition 
Demolition Area (OU-4) at Umatilla Depot Activity 


Comment 1 

DEQ is uncomfortable with the basic “all or nothing” approach used in this FS. This 
operable unit is composed of twenty individual sites with differing contaminant profiles 
and different levels of risk. Yet the approach taken here is to treat the entire OU as 
essentially one site. Remedial alternatives are presented which only address the unit as a 
whole and ignore the risks of individual sites and the cost-effectiveness of cleanup at 
individual sites... 

Response 

This issue was discussed at a meeting held between EPA, DEQ, the'Army, and Arthur D. 
Little, Inc. at Umatilla Depot Activity (UMDA) on July 20,1993. The FS addresses a 
range of remedial alternatives for all sites. This provides a basis by which proposed 
rei^dies for any or all of the sites may be selected. Thus, DEQ may still propose 
different remedial alternatives be used for each of the sites if desired and the Army will 
consider DEQ’s rationale. 

As a result of discussions between EPA, DEQ, and the Army, sites were prioritized for 
clean-up at the ADA based on risk and hazard level. Highest priority sites (those with 
risk levels exceeding 1 x 1(H or hazard quotients exceeding 1 have been selected for 
remediation and will be presented in the proposed plan. To support the proposed plan. 
Section 4.3.8 of the FS addresses the soil volumes, risk levels, and costs to remediate the 
priority sites. 

Comment 2 

At an estimated cost of $516,(X)0 per acre, UXO clearance to a depth of 20 ft. does not 
appear to be cost effective...Accordingly, DEQ believes this option should be eliminated 
fi'om consideration... 

Response 

The clearance of UXO to a depth of 20 ft. has been eliminated as a final alternative. The 
development of costs and impacts of clearance to that depth has been retained in the FS 
for reference. 

Comment 3 

Currently, this FS includes 22 Alternatives, considering all the variations of Alternatives 
2,4,5, and 7 (Alternative 3 is not counted, since it is not a stand alone alternative). This 
is far too many. A more thorough screening out of options that are more costly than ones 
which provide similar results should be performed. Options which could be eliminated 
include off-site disposal, which in every case is more costly than on-site disposal in the 
active landfill; construction of a new landfQl, which in evoy case is more costly than use

of the existing active landfill; treatment of all excavated soil, which in every case is more 
costly than equivalent soil washing or soil segregation options; and soil washing, which 
is more costly than soil segregation. 

Response 

This issue was discussed at a meeting held between EPA, DEQ, the Army, and Arthur D. 
Little, Inc. at Umatilla Depot Activity (UMDA) on July 20,1993. The FS presents an 
analysis of a broad range of alternatives in order to provide a solid basis for decision¬ 
making. The detailed analysis of a number of the alternatives was required in order to 
determine their feasibility based on cost. In view of the extensive F$ work performed, it 
is preferable to the Army to retain the documentation of all the alternatives in the FS. The 
various cost effects were not known in the early stages of the FS so certain alternatives 
(e.g., off site disposal) could not have been accurately screened.

Appropriate corrections have been made to the text as noted. 

Comment 20 

Section 3.2, pages 3-1 through 3-4. What is the basis for the assumption that the entire 
1,750 acre ADA may contain UXOs? Based on the available historical records, it appears 
that open detonation and firing range activities, which could generate UXOs, were 
restricted to a relatively few, distinct areas within the ADA. Given the significant costs of

UXO clearance, some rationale should be presented to justify the need for clearing the 
entire ADA area. 

Response 

Despite the possibility that the presence of UXO may be limited to certain areas of the 
ADA, the exact locations and frequency of UXO are unknown. Metallic items appear to 
have been fairly widely dispersed throughout the area. Because of the unknowns 
associated with the presence of UXO and in order to insure that adequate levels of 
protection are provided by UXO clearance, r^uirements for clearanice are conservatively 
assumed to encompass the entire 1750-acre site. This discussion is presented in Section 
4.2.3.1 of the FS. [Note that if the Army must certify the entire ADA as cleared of UXO 
to a certain depth, it may not be pradent (or possible) to try to show that certain areas 
have never been used.] 

Comment 21 

Table 3-1, page 3-2, and Section 3.3, page 3-4. Based on the end-use descriptions in 
Table 2-4, page 2-16, wouldn’t Alternative 3 (i.e., clearance to 5 ft.) also provide for 
future agricultural use of the property? 

Response 

The FS has been revised in such a manner that Alternative 3, as presented in this draft 
(i.e.. Institutional Control, UXO Clearance, and Soil Removal) is no longer an alternative 
under consideration. The cost for a range of UXO clearance levels and supporting 
information is still included in the FS. 

Comment 22 

Section 4.2.1.6, page 4-19, first paragraph. The final closure plan for the active landfill 
now provides for it to remain open for receipt of non-hazardous cleanup wastes until 
March 1998. 

Response 

This correction has been made to the text with reference. 

Comment 23 

Section 4.2.4.2, page 4-26, Implementability. The text on page 4-9, first full paragraph, 
indicates that clearance to 20 ft. has not been demonstrated.

Response 

The general comments for Appendix C address various inconsistencies and need for 
clarification of some line items in Appendix C. This appendix has been revised to correct 
the inconsistencies and errors. The cost of treatability studies for soil washing have been 
reduced to $100,000 to reflect DEQ and EPA comments. 

Comment 30 

Table C-7. The text (page 4-16) describes the use of a plastic-lined trench as a stoclqpile 
area for stabilized soils. The capital costs for preparation and materMs for the stockpile 
area are not included on this table. This comment also applies to other alternatives whae 
soil solidification/stabilization is proposed. 

Response 

As shown in Section 4.2.1.5, the text addressing the method of managing the 
stabUization/solidification treatment products prior to their disposal has been 
revised/corrected. The revision reflects that the treatment products are discharged to a 
dump truck or transportable container for transport to the final disposal area. 

Comments 31 through 37 

These comments address inconsistencies and need for clarification of cost items presented 
in Appendix C. The tables in Appendix C have been revised accordingly to address all 
inconsistencies and needed clarifications. 

Comment 38 

Tables C-19, C-20, and C-21. What are the estimated analytical costs to determine if soil 
is RCRA Hazardous Waste or not? 

Response 

The cost for these analytical determinations are presented in the revised Appendix C 
tables.
