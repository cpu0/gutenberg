Dear Friend: 


This catalog describes Kyan Software's complete line of programming tools 
and utilities for the ATARI 8-bit family of computers. These Kyan 
products run under Atari DOS and provide you with the tools necessary to 
develop the latest state-of-the-art software. These products are now 
available from Kyan Software. 

There are many good reasons for you to buy Kyan Software products. 
Following are just a few: 

Kyan software is not copy-protected. You can make backup copies 
and copy the software into RAMdisk or onto hard drives without 
limitation. 

Kyan software is royalty free. You can use the Pascal Runtime. 
Library and routines in the programming Toolkits without paying royalties. 
(Note: Copyright notices must be observed). r 

Source code compatibility and portability. Since Kyan Pascal is 
ISO standard Pascal, the software you write on your Atari is portable to 
most mainframe computers. Also, since Kyan has similar compilers for the 
Apple // and Commodore family of 8-bit computers, the source code for 
your Atari programs can be recompiled to run on these other popular 
computers. 

Finally, Kyan Software guarantees your satisfaction.

Kyan Pascal 

(Version 2.0) 


Kyan Pascal is the perfect package for learning Pascal and developing 
Pascal programs. It is a full implementation of ISO Pascal and will run on 
any Atari 800/XL/XE with at least 48K RAM and a single disk drive . It is 
widely used by both students and advanced programmers because of its 
economical price, user-friendly environment, and extensive list of features. 

Kyan Pascal is an extremely powerful programming tool, yet it keeps the 
beginner in mind. It features command menus, help screens and several 
libraries of error messages. It comes with a comprehensive, 300 page manual 
which includes a complete Pascal tutorial. It is perfect for students who are 
taking a Pascal programming course and want do their assignments at home. 

But, Kyan Pascal is more than just a learning tool. It's also a powerful 
software development system. It provides experienced programmers with 
features and capabilities not found in other Pascal products. And, when 
teamed with Kyan’s new programming toolkits, Kyan Pascal gives you the 
tools needed to develop the most sophisticated, professional-quality 
software. 

Other Kyan Pascal features include: 

• DOS 2.5 (with RAMdisk support) included on the disk. 

• 6502 machine code compiler and assembler, which generate 

code that runs more than 30 times faster than BASIC. 

• Full-screen text editor with cut & paste, search & replace, etc. 

• Pascal extensions such as include, chain, string handling, random 
access files, random numbers, sound, and graphics. 

• Built-in macro assembler which allows you to add in-line or 
included assembly source code. 

• Non-copy protected disk that allows you to make backup copies 

and/or load files into a RAMdisk. 

• Royalty-free license to use the Pascal Runtime Library with 
software you develop. 

Try Kyan Pascal. Find out why it has become the 
standard for Pascal programming in the Atari.

Toolkit I 

System Utilities 


The System Utilities Toolkit contains Pascal and Assembly language 
routines which are designed to be used in your Pascal application programs. 

he Toolkit contains 94 routines plus sample programs and complete 
instructions for using each routine in your own programs. The Toolkit 
routines are organized into four libraries. 

L-Input/ Output Utilities IJhrarv 

This library contains routines which let you access the functionality of 
various DOS functions and procedures from within your Pascal program. 
The library contains 23 routines including procedures for: copying, 
renaming, deleting, locking/unlocking, and appending files; loading character . 
sets, loading/saving binary files, and more. 

■ ) 

1L_ System Functions library ° 


his library contains 34 functions and procedures which allow you to access 
hardware functions from within your application program. Included are 
commands which allow you to: enable or disable the keyboard, break key 
screen, key click, and more; set the speed of key repeat and debounce; set 
border colors, background colors, and character luminance; and more (Some - 
routines require an XL or XE.) 

HL—Screen Management Library 

This library contains 25 routines which you can use in your Pascal programs 
to control screen functions. The library includes routines for: GotoXY and 
other cursor control functions; insertion/deletion of characters and lines- 
clear screen; tab controls; and more. 

I3L- Other System Utilifips 

™s library includes several random number routines, conversion routines^' 
which allow you to convert strings to integers or real numbers and vicfe 
ver ;’ a ’ sort and mer g e routines which allow you to sort records and files 
alphabetically or numerically, and a line parsing routine which enables you 
to interpret command line inputs to your Pascal programs.

Toolkit II 

Advanced Graphics 


The Advanced Graphics Toolkit is a family of routines which provide 
the experienced programmer with an easy means of adding sophisticated 
graphics to Atari programs. With Kyan Pascal and the Advanced 
Graphics Toolkit, you can create programs with hi-res displays, 3- 
Dimensional graphics, perspective drawings, player/missile graphics, and 
much more. 

The Advanced Graphics Toolkit consists of three modules -- 
player/missile graphics, advanced (3-Dimensional) graphics, and Atari 1020 
plotter routines. 

The player/missile graphics module provides the programmer with a set of 
basic procedures for creating graphics displays using smooth, fast-moving 
objects. The player/missile graphics routines are grouped into the following 
categories: 


• Initialization: Commands which set-up the operating environment; 

• Movement: Commands to set up, activate, or modify sprite locations; 

• Clearing: Commands to erase sprites from the screen. 

The advanced graphics module provides the Pascal programmer with tools 
for creating and manipulating 3-Dimensional images. The procedures 
support: 


• Geometry and Line Generation: Location and display of simple points 

and line segments; 

• Transformations: Uniform alteration of images through scaling 

(changing the image size), translation (moving the image), and 
rotation (rotating the image about a fixed point); 

« Windowing and Clipping: Selection and enlargement of portions of a 
drawing, and clipping (deletion) of undesired portions; 

• 3 Dimensional Images: Extension of graphics to 3 dimensions; and, 

• Curves: Generation of curves using interpolation and B-spline methods. 

The Atari 1020 plotter routines provide the programmer with the tools 
needed to print color graphics output to Atari's low-cost plotter.

Computer Graphics 


COMPUTER GRAPHICS: A Programming Approach 

by Steven Harrington (McGraw-Hill Publishing, 1983). 

This 445 page textbook is quickly becoming the standard introduction to 
interactive computer graphics. It is the perfect accompaniment to Kvan's 
Advanced Graphics Toolkit. It provides the hands-on experience and basic 
information needed to implement, modify, and use a computer graphics system. 
The book is built around detailed language independent algorithms for a graphics 
system and follows the standards proposed in the Graphics Standards Planning 
Committee's CORE system. By using this standard of basic graphics 
capabilities, the book provides a solid foundation for more advanced techniques. 
It includes coverage of raster graphics and discusses interactive techniques, 
enabling the reader to learn methods of graphical input as well as output. In 
addition, general 3D viewing is treated to familiarize the reader with the CORE 
system approach to viewing three-dimensional objects. Numerous problems and 
experiential exercises are included to enhance comprehension of the material.
