System Utilities Toolkit 

The Atari System Utilities Toolkit contains Pascal and Assembly 
language routines which are designed to be used in your Pascal 
application programs. The Toolkit contains 94 routines plus sample 
programs and complete instructions for using each routine in your own 
programs. The Toolkit routines are organized into four libraries. 

I. Input/Output Utilities Library 

This library contains routines which let you access the functionality of 
various DOS functions and procedures from within your Pascal program. 
The library contains 23 routines including procedures for: copying, 
renaming, deleting, locking/unlocking, and appending files; loading 
character sets; loading and saving binary files; and much more. 

II. System Functions Library 

This library contains 34 functions and procedures which allow you to 
access hardware functions from within your application programs. 
Commands are included which allow you to: enable or disable the 
keyboard, break key, screen, key click, and more; set the speed of key 
repeat and debounce; set border colors, background colors and character 
luminance; and more. 

III. Screen Management Library 

This library contains 25 routines which you can use in your Pascal programs 
to control screen functions. The library includes routines for: GOTOXY 
and other cursor control functions; insertion/deletion of characters and 
lines; clear screen; tab controls; and more. 

IV. Other System Utilities 

This library includes several random number routines; conversion routines 
which allow you to convert strings to integers or real numbers and vice 
versa; sort and merge routines which allow you to sort records and files 
alphabetically or numerically; and a line parsing routine which enables you 
to interpret command line inputs to your Pascal programs.
