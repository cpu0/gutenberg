Abstract 


TDA documents determine the personnel strengths 
for each Army installation. They reflect the number of people 
required to accomplish a certain mission by various charac- 
teristics. US Army Training and Doctrine Command 
(TRADOC) analysts continuously scrutinize these docu- 
ments to ensure that they comply with provided guidance. 
Part of this guidance has been used to develop a set of manual 
rules. Analysts apply these rules to the TDA to: (l)eliminate 
positions; (2) downgrade positions; or (3) reduce position 
strength. However, this process is very time consuming. In 
addition, human involvement introduces inconsistencies and 
errors that are difficult to detect later. 

This paper explains how I represented these rules 
using the 4 C Language Production System (CLIPS) to de- 
velop an expert system that is applied consistently and 
comprehensively for all TRADOC installations. The TDA 
System Analyzer reduces the review process from about five 
days to just twenty minutes; giving the user more time to 
analyze the results and thereby make better decisions. Fur- 
thermore, the user is assured that the rules are applied 
uniformly to every TDA document 

This paper also explains the integration of the TDA 
System Analyzer into TRADOC’ s On-Line TDA System. 
Providing the analyst an extra utility module that can be 
accessed from a familiar environment 

1. Introduction 

Installations rarely receive the exact number of 
soldiers that they request Therefore, distributing scarce per- 
sonnel resources is a problem. It will become more acute as 
the Army reduces its current 764,000 active-duty force by 
184,000 soldiers in the next four years. TRADOC. being the 
Army’s major headquarters for training, is responsible for 
distributing its share of personnel resources to its subordinate 
installations. 

This process is dynamic and complex. It involves 
manually reviewing large TDA documents (some having 
more than 10,000 records) for conflicts with policy, inaccu- 
rate grading structures, and incorrect number of soldiers 


filling a position. The manpower analyst must be familiar 
with a variety of current and new force structures, unit 
modernization options, and manpowerrelationships between 
units and activities. At a high level, the analyst must be able 
to formulate plans to distribute new personnel resources and 
redistribute existing personnel. At a low level, the analyst 
must track very detailed information to determine the impli- 
cations on individual units while abiding with current policy. 

The sheer size of the TDA documents often forces 
the analyst to spend an inordinate amount of time reviewing 
the documents for inconsistencies rather than analyzing them 
for policy compliance and distribution requirements. In 
addition, the review process is mundane and subject to error . 
These errors can adversely affect later analysis. 

The purpose of the TDA System Analyzer is to 
conduct the initial review of the TDA document for the 
analyst. It scrubs each document using a dynamic rule set 
written in CLIPS and highlights potential inconsistencies. 
The analyst concentrates only on these discrepancies; devot- 
ing more time to high level analysis. 

The TDA System Analyzer executes on a Zenith 
248 Personal Computer (PC) with 640 kilobytes of internal 
memory and 20 megabytes of external hard disk space. The 
system is an external utility module within TRADOCs On- 
Line TDA System. The On-Line TDA System is a dBase 
III™ program that brings TDA databases residing on main- 
frames to manpower analysts using PCs. 

2. The Rules 

In 1988, the Commanding General of TRADOC, 
General Maxwell Thurman, initiated development of a rule 
set to quantify the discrepancies an analyst should detect 
while reviewing a TDA document. He intended that an 
expert system use these rules to relieve the analyst of the 
initial review process. 

The set contains two types of rules: (1) those 
defining exact discrepancies in the document; and (2) those

showing grading structures by position. The first type de- 
scribes the conditions within the TDA document the system 
searches. For example, an officer cannot work for another 
officer of the same grade. If the situation exists where a 
Captain works for another Captain, the system detects this 
and reports a problem to the analyst. 

The second type specifies the grade or rank for a 
position at a certain level. For instance, a rule might state that 
a Company Commander be a Captain. In this example, the 
position is Commander, the level is Company and the grade 
is Captain. If the system detects a Major as a Company 
Commander, a discrepancy is sent to the analyst. Appendix 
A provides a complete listing of the rules. 

3- System Components and Design 
Methodology 

I used a phased control methodology as the basic 
design for the TDA System Analyzer. Phase control facts arc 
asserted and retracted depending on the current state of 
processing. Figure 1 shows the sequence of phases. 



Figure 1. Sequence of Phases 


3.1 Initialize 

My recompiled version of CLIPS receives three 
parameters - the file name of the CLIPS rule set, the file name 
of a dBase III™ database containing position grading data 
(this will be discussed later), and the name of a TDA docu- 
ment The system uses the first parameter to load the rule seL 
It uses the next two parameters to assert two relations. These 
are (database “dBase III™ file name”) and (process “file 
name of TDA document”). The first indicates the database 
that queries will be made to. The second fact tells the system 
which TDA document to open for processing. 


3.2 Load Unit to Process 

This phase determines the type of installation that 
will be analyzed. Different TRADOC installations require 
different types of analysis as reflected in the corresponding 
type 2 rules. For instance, the system processes a Service 
School differently than a Brigade. 

A dBase III™ database captures information about 
the processing requirements for the different installations. 
The information stored in this database is the triplet (level, 
position, grade). Type 2 rules use this triplet to detect 
discrepancies. This data can be thought of as system parame- 
ters that can be deleted, modified, or added by the user. 

When thesystem determines the installation type, it 
queries the database for just the data it needs to review that 
particular installation. An external function, ssql (Small 
Structured Query Language), executes this. This function 
provides direct access to dBase III™ data files using a subset 
of the Structured Query Language (SQL). For instance, the 
following rule uses ssql to query the Grading-Info database 
for Service School data. 


(defrule get-level-service-school 
(phase load-UIC-to-process) 

(service-schools $?service-schools) 

;;; Service School IDs 

(UIC ?uic&:(> (member ?uic $?service-schools))) 
;;; is this a service school 

=> 

(ssql "grading-data 99 

"select * from Grading-Info where 
level = service-school" )) 


Figure 2. Rule Calling ssql 


399 




ssql asserts relations of the following type into the 
knowledge base: (grading-data “level” ‘position” 

“grade”). These facts represent the permissible grading 
structures for this installation type. 


3.3 Load TDA Data 

TDA documents can contain more than 10,000 rec- 
ords. It is impractical to reason about all 10,000 records 
concurrently. Therefore, the system loads records in small 
segments based on sub-unit designation and asserts any 
necessary relations to do reasoning between the different 
sub-units. 


3.4 Massage TDA Data 

Several rules require cumulative figures (total 
number of officers, total number of personnel in this sub-unit, 
total number of officers by speciality) to determine possible 
discrepancies. The TDA document does not store this infor- 
mation explicitly. This phase gathers this information and 
asserts it in the knowledge base for use by the rules in the next 
phase. 

3.5 Apply Rules 

During this phase, the system applies the two rule 
types to detect discrepancies. Initially, I coded a separate rule 
for each listed at Appendix A. However, the commonality 
between type 2 rules permitted me to replace these rules with 
just one. This single rule detects discrepancies by first 
matching on the grading-data relation and then matching on 
any TDA records that have the same level and position but 
different grade. (See Figure 3) 


(defrule grading-rule 
(phase actions) 

(grading-data ?level ?position ?grade) 

(TDA 

(LINE ?!ine) 

(PARA ?para) 

(SUB-PARA ?sub-para) 

(GRADE ?TDAgrade&-?grade) 

(DESCRIPTION ?desc&:(&& 

(>= (str-index ?level ?desc) 1) 

(>= (str-index ?position ?uesc) 1)))) 

=> 

(assert 

(discrepancy ?para ?sub-para ?line 

?TDAgrade ?desc ? position ?level))) 

Figure 3. Example of a Type 2 Rule 


3.6 Resolve Exceptions 

It is possible with type 2 rules to have different 
grades for the same position and level. For example, a Major 
or Captain (grade) may be an Action Officer (position) at the 
Service School level. If one of these cases occurs in the TDA 
document, the system reports a discrepancy. Yet, either 
grade is satisfactory for this position. This phase eliminates 
these discrepancies before reporting them to the analyst. The 
TDA System Analyzer accomplishes this by first matching 
on the discrepancy and then searching the knowledge base for 
a grading-data fact that matches the level, position, and 
grade of the discrepancy. If such a fact exists, the discrepancy 
is removed. Other exceptions are handled during this phase , 
but most are the type mentioned above. 

3.7 Print Discrepancies 

The knowledge base contains only valid discrepan- 
cies at this point The system writes these to an output file 
that can be later reviewed and manipulated by the analyst. 


3.8 Clean Up 

During the data massage phase, the system asserted 
a number of relations containing cumulative figures. This 
information is only valid while processing the current sub- 
unit This data must be removed before the TDA System 
Analyzer can review the next sub-unit. This phase retracts 
these facts. 

The program loops through phases three to eight 
until all sub-units of the TDA document arc processed. The 
system then closes the TDA document file and discrepancy 
output file. 

4. Performing a TDA Document Review 

We integrated the TDA System Analyzer in the On- 
Line TDA System as a utility module. The analyst uses the 
On-Line TDA System daily and is comfortable with its 
structure and user interface. These characteristics make 
using the TDA System Analyzer easier. 

The analyst first calls the On-Line TDA System’s 
utility module. He then chooses the TDA System Analyzer. 
At this point, the user can elect to process the document with 
the current parameters or he can access the dBase III™ 
database to change them. The ability to change system 
parameters so readily permits him to alter dynamically the 
way the system will review a document In addition, the 
analyst can do "what-if* exercises. For example, he may 


400 




wonder what discrepancies will be found if he changes 
Battalion Commanders at the Service School level from 
Lieutenant Colonels to Majors. The analyst does this easily 
using the appropriate dBase III™ commands. 

When the analyst is satisfied with the system para- 
meters, he chooses the specific TD A document to process and 
tells the system to execute. A review of 10,000 records 
requires approximately 25 minutes. This performance 
compares with a typical 40 man-hour analysis - an improve- 
ment of almost 1 00; 1 . In addition, the review is complete 
and consistent After execution, the analyst can browse the 
discrepancy output on-line or print it to hard-copy for future 
reference. 

The On-Line TDA System also supports batch 
processing of the TDA System Analyzer. Analyses can be 


run during non-duty hours on many TDA documents and/or 
on the same document with different parameter settings. 

5. Summary 

The TDA System Analyzer represents an innova- 
tive way of analyzing TDA documents. It gives the man- 
power analyst the power to change dynamically the way a 
document will be processed, but isolates him from the mun- 
dane task of actually doing the review . He can focus more on 
issues, policy, and personnel distribution problems. 

The power and flexibility of the CLIPS’ environ- 
ment supported the rapid development of a system that could 
be iteratively refined. 1 was able to implement quickly 
improvements and changes. The power of this environment 
permitted me to develop a complete system with extensions 
to the basic functionality of CLIPS in less than three months.
