A Structured Data Transfer Protocol

The transfer of data between different computers and programs can be a 
major obstacle during data analysis. We present a new data transfer 
protocol which is based on a simple structure containing a value, an 
error and a unit. Each of these members can be arrays or another 
structure. The ability to nest structures allows for the concept of 
objects. When using an object-oriented language such as C++, reference 
can be made to the object name instead of each element explicitly. 

Prototype code has been written which implements the basic design with 
enhancements planned for the future.
