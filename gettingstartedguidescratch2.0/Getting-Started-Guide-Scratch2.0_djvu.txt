Scratch is a programming language that makes it easy 
to create your own interactive stories, games, and animations 
and share your creations with others on the web. 

Scratch is developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten research 
group at the MIT Media Lab (http://llk.media.mit.edu). Our 
group develops new technologies that, in the spirit of the 
blocks and fingerpaint of kindergarten, expand the range of 
what people can design, create, and learn. 

The Scratch project has been supported with funding from 
the National Science Foundation, Intel Foundation, Microsoft, 
MacArthur Foundation, LEGO Foundation, Google, Dell, 
Inversoft, and the MIT Media Lab research consortia. 


Supported by NSF Grants 0325828 and 1002713. Any opinions, findings, and 
conclusions or recommendations expressed on this site are those of the
