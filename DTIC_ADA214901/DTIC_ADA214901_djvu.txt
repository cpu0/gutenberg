CHAPTER 1 


INTRODUCTION 



This Validation Summary Report '(-VSR7 describes the extent to which a 
specific Ada compiler conforms to the Ada Standard, ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A. 
This report explains all technical terms used within it and thoroughly 
reports the results of_..testing this compiler using the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability, (ACVC).o An Ada compiler must be implemented 
according to the Ada Standard, and any implementation-dependent features 
must conform to the requirements of the Ada Standard. The Ada Standard 
must be implemented in its entirety, and nothing can be implemented that is 
not in the Standard. 


Even though all validated Ada compilers conform to the Ada Standard, it 
must be understood that some differences do exist between implementations. 
The Ada Standard permits some implementation dependencies—for example, the 
maximum length of identifiers or the maximum values of integer types. 
Other differences between compilers result from the characteristics of 
particular operating systems, hardware, or implementation strategies. All 
the dependencies observed during the process of testing this compiler are 
given in this report. 

The information in this report is derived from the test results produced 
during validation testing. The validation process includes submitting a 
suite of standardized tests, the ACVC, as inputs to an Ada compiler and 
evaluating the results. The purpose of validating is to ensure conformity 
of the compiler to the Ada Standard by testing that the compiler properly 
implements legal language constructs and that it identifies and rejects 
illegal language constructs. The testing also identifies behavior that is 
implementation-dependent but is permitted by the Ada Standard. Six classes 
of tests are used. These tests are designed to perform checks at compile 
time, at link time, and during execution.

INTRODUCTION 


1.1 PURPOSE OF THIS VALIDATION SUMMARY REPORT 


This VSR documents the results of the validation testing performed on an 
Ada compiler. Testing was carried out for the following purposes: 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs supported by the 
compiler that do not conform to the Ada Standard 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs not supported by 
the compiler but required by the Ada Standard 

. To determine that the implementation-dependent behavior is allowed 
by the Ada Standard 

Testing of this compiler was conducted by SofTech, Inc. under the 
direction of the AVF according to procedures established by the Ada Joint 
Program Office and administered by the Ada Validation Organization (AVO). 
On-site testing was completed 12 July 1989 at Santa Clara CA.

An ACVC test for which the compiler generates a result that 
demonstrates nonconformity to the Ada Standard. 

The computer on which the compiler resides. 

An ACVC test that uses features of the language that a 
compiler is not required to support or may legitimately 
support in a way other than the one expected by the test. 

An ACVC test for which a compiler generates the expected 
result. 

The computer for which a compiler generates code. 

A program that checks a compiler's conformity regarding a 
particular feature or a combination of features to the Ada 
Standard. In the context of this report, the term is used to 
designate a single test, which may comprise one or more 
files. 

An ACVC test found to be incorrect and not used to check 
conformity to the Ada Standard. A test may be incorrect 
because it has an invalid test objective, fails to meet its 
test objective, or contains illegal or erroneous use of the 
language. 


1.5 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conformity to the Ada Standard is measured using the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains both legal and illegal Ada programs structured into six test 
classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies 
the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable, 
and special program units are used to report their results during 
execution. Class B tests are expected to produce compilation errors. 
Class L tests are expected to produce compilation or link errors because of 
the way in which a program library is used at link time. 

Class A tests ensure the successful compilation of legal Ada programs with 
certain language constructs which cannot be verified at compile time. 
There are no explicit program components in a Class A test to check 
semantics. For example, a Class A test checks that reserved words of 
another language (other than those already reserved in the Ada language) 
are not treated as reserved words by an Ada compiler. A Class A test is 
passed if no errors are detected at compile time and the program executes 
to produce a PASSED message. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that every syntax or 
semantic error in the test is detected. A Class B test is passed if every

INTRODUCTION 


illegal construct that it contains is detected by the compiler. 

Class C tests check the run time system to ensure that legal Ada programs 
can be correctly compiled and executed. Each Class C test is self-checking 
and produces a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result when it is executed. 

Class D tests check the compilation and execution capacities of a compiler. 
Since rhere are no capacity requirements placed on a compiler by the Ada 
Standard for some parameters—for example, the number of identifiers 
permitted in a compilation or the number of units in a librai>—a compiler 
may refuse to compile a Class D test and still be a conforming compiler. 
Therefore, if a Class D test fails to compile because the capacity of the 
compiler is exceeded, the test is classified as inapplicable. If a Class D 
test compiles successfully, it is self-checking and produces a PASSED or 
FAILED message during execution. 

Class E tests are expected to execute successfully and check 
implementation-dependent options and resolutions of ambiguities in the Ada 
Standard. Each Class E test is self-checking and produces a NOT 
APPLICABLE, PASSED, or FAILED message when it is compiled and executed. 
However, the Ada Standard permits an implementation to reject programs 
containing some features addressed by Class E tests during compilation. 
Therefore, a Class E test is passed by a compiler if it is compiled 
successfully and executes to produce a PASSED message, or if it is rejected 
by the compiler for an allowable reason. 

Class L tests check that incomplete or illegal Ada programs involving 
multiple, separately compiled units are detected and not allowed to 
execute. Class L tests are compiled separately and execution is attempted. 
A Class L test passes if it is rejected at link time—that is, an attempt 
to execute the main program must generate an error message before any 
declarations in the main program or any units referenced by the main 
program are elaborated. In some cases, an implementation may legitimately 
detect errors during compilation of the test. 

Two library units, the package REPORT and the procedure CHECK_FILE, support 
the self-checking features of the executable tests. The package REPORT 
provides the mechanism by which executable tests report PASSED, FAILED, or 
NOT APPLICABLE results. It also provides a set of identity functions used 
to defeat some compiler optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that 
would circumvent a test objective. The procedure CHECK FILE is used to 
check the contents of text files written by some of the Class C tests for 
chapter 14 of the Ada Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. These tests produce messages that 
are examined to verify that the units are operating correctly. If these 
units are not operating correctly, then the validation is not attempted. 

The text of each test in the ACVC follows conventions that are intended to 
ensure that the tests are reasonably portable without modification. For 
example, the tests make use of only the basic set of 55 characters, contain 
lines with a maximum length of 72 characters, use small numeric values, and 
place features that may not be supported by all implementations in separate

INTRODUCTION 


tests. However, some tests contain values that require the test to be 
customized according to implementation-specific values — for example, an 
illegal file name. A list of the values used for this validation is 
provided in Appendix C. 

A compiler must correctly process each of the tests in the suite and 
demonstrate conformity to the Ada Standard by either meeting the pass 
criteria given for the test or by showing that the test is inapplicable to 
the implementation. The applicability of a test to an implementation is 
considered each time the implementation is validated. A test that is 
inapplicable for one validation is not necessarily inapplicable for a 
subsequent validation. Any test that was determined to contain an illegal 
language construct or an erroneous language construct is withdrawn from the 
ACVC and, therefore, is not used in testing a compiler. The tests 
withdrawn at the time of this validation are given in Appendix D.

CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


Communications Network: ETHERNET 


2.2 IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS 

One of the purposes of validating compilers is to determine the behavior of 
a compiler in those areas of the Ada Standard that ^ermit implementations 
to differ. Class D and E tests specifically check for such implementation 
differences. However, tests in other classes also characterize an 
implementation. The tests demonstrate the following characteristics: 


j 

a. Capacities. | 


(1) The compiler correctly processes a compilation containing 723 
variables in the same declarative part. (See test D29002K.) 

(2) The compiler correctly processes tests containing loop 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See tests D55A03A .H (8 
tests).) 

(3) The compiler correctly processes tests containing block 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See test D56001B.) 

(4) The compiler correctly processes tests containing recursive 
procedures separately compiled as subunits nested to 10 
levels. (See tests D64005E..G (3 tests).) 


b. Predefined types. 

(1) This implementation supports the additional predefined types 
SH0RT_INTEGtR, fJNG_FL0AT, and SH0RT_SH0RT_INTEGER in package 
STANDARD. (See tests B86001T..Z (7 tests).) 


c. Expression evaluation. 

The order in which expressions are evaluated and the time at which 
constraints are checked are not defined by the language. While 
the ACVC tests do noc specifically attempt to determine the order 
of evaluation of expressions, test results indicate the following: 

(1) None of the default initialization expressions for record 
components are evaluated before any value is checked for 
membership in a component's subtype. (See test C32117A.) 

(2) Assignments for subtypes are performed with the same precision 
as the base type. (See test C35712B.) 


2-2 







CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(3) This implementation uses no extra bits for extra precision and 
uses all extra bits for extra range. (See test C35903A.) 

(4) Sometimes NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when an integer literal 
operand in a comparison or membership test is outside the 
range of the base type. (See test C45232A.) 

(5) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when a literal operand in a 
fixed-point comparison or membership test is outside the range 
of the base type. (See test C45252A.) 

(6) Underflow is not gradual. (See tests C45524A..Z.) 


d. Rounding. 

The method by which values are rounded in type conversions is not 
defined by the language. While the ACVC tests do not specifically 
attempt to determine the method of rounding, the test results 
indicate the following: 

(1) The method used for rounding to integer is round to even. 
(See tests C46012A..Z.) 

(2) The method used for rounding to longest integer is round to 
even. (See tests C46012A..Z.) 

(3) The method used for rounding to integer in static universal 
real expressions is round away from zero. (See test C4A014A.) 


e. Array types. 

An implementation is allowed to raise NUMERIC_ERROR or 

CONSTRAINTERROR for an array having a 'LENGTH that exceeds 

STANDARD.INTEGER'LAST and/or SYSTEM.MAX_INT. 

For this implementation: 

(1) Declaration of an array type or subtype declaration with more 
than SYSTEM.MAX INT components raises NUMERIC_ERROR. (See 
test C36003A.) 

(2) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when a null array type with 

INTEGER'LAST + 2 components is declared. (See test C36202A.) 

(3) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when a null array type with 

SYSTEM.RAX_INT + 2 components is declared. (See test 

C36202B.) 


2-3 






CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(4) A packed BOOLEAN array having a 'LENGTH exceeding INTEGER'LAST 
raises NUMERIC_ERROR when the array type is declared. (See 
test C52103X.) 

(5) A packed tvo-diraensional BOOLEAN array with more than 
INTEGER'LAST components raises NUMERIC_ERROR when the array 
type is declared. (See test C52104Y.) 

(6) A null array with one dimension of length greater than 

INTEGER'LAST may raise NUMERIC_ERROR or CONSTRAINT_ERROR 
either when declared or assigned. Alternatively, an 

implementation may accept the declaration. However, lengths 
must match in array slice assignments. This implementation 
raises NUMERIC_ERROR when the array type is declared. (See 
test E52103Y.) 

(7) In assigning one-dimensional array types, the expression is 
evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

(8) In assigning two-dimensional array types, tne expression is 
not evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is 
raised when checking whether the expression's subtype is 
compatible with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


f. Discriminated types. 

(1) In assigning record types with discriminants, the expression 
is evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


g. Aggregates. 

(1) In the evaluation of a multi-dimensional aggregate, all 
choices are evaluated before checking against the index type. 
(See tests C43207A and C43207B.) 

(2) In the evaluation of an aggregate containing subaggregates, 
not all choices are evaluated before being checked for 
identical bounds. (See test E43212B.) 

(3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised befor? all choices are evaluated 
when a bound in a non-null range of a non-null aggregate does 
not belong to an index subtype. (See test E43211B.) 


2-4 







CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


h. Pragmas. 

(1) The pragma INLINE is supported for functions and procedures. 
(See tests LA3004A..B, EA3004C..D, and CA3004E..F.) 


i. Generics 

(1) Generic specifications and bodies can be compiled in separate 
compilations. (See tests CA1012A, CA2009C, CA2009F, BC3204C, 
and BC3205D.) 

(2) Generic unit bodies and their subunits can be compiled in 
separate compilations. (See test CA3011A.) 


j. Input and output 

(1) The package SEQUENTIALIO can be instantiated with 
unconstrained array types and record types with discriminants 
without defaults. (See tests AE2101C, EE2201D, and EE2201E.) 

(2) The package DIRECT_IO cannot be instantiated with 
unconstrained array types or record types with discriminants 
without defaults. (See tests AE2101H, EE2401D, and EE2401G.) 

(3) Modes INFILE and OUT_FILE are supported for SEQUENTIALIO. 
(See tests CE2102D..E, CE2102N, and CE2102P.) 

(4) Modes INFILE, OUTFILE, and INOUT FILE are supported for 
DIRECT 10. (See tests CE2102F, CE210?I..J, CE2102R, CE2102T, 
and CEI102V.) 

(5) Modes IN FILE and OUT FILE are supported for text files. (See 
tests CE3102E and CE3I02I..K.) 

(6) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for SEQUENTIALIO. 
(See tests CE2102G and CE2102X.) 

(7) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for DIRECT_I0. (See 
tests CF.9102K and CE2102Y.) 

(8) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for text files. 
(See tests CE3102F..G, CE3104C, CE3110A, and CE3114A.) 

(9) Overwriting to a sequential file does not truncate the file. 
(See test CE2208B.) 

(10) Temporary sequential files are given names and deleted when 
closed. (See test CE2108A.)

CHAPTER 3 
TEST INFORMATION 


3.1 TEST RESULTS 

Version 1.10 of the ACVC comprises 3717 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, 44 tests had been withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF 
determined that 372 tests were inapplicable to this implementation. All 
inapplicable tests were processed during validation testing except for 201 
executable tests that use floating-point precision exceeding that supported 
by the implementation. Modifications to the code, processing, or grading 
for 77 tests were required to successfully demonstrate the test objective. 
(See section 3.6.) 

The AVF concludes that the testing results demonstrate acceptable 
conformity to the Ada Standard.

3.5 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

Some tests do not apply to all compilers because they make use of features 
that a compiler is not required by the Ada Standard to support. Others may 
depend on the result of another test that is either inapplicable or 
withdrawn. The applicability of a test to an implementation is considered 
each time a validation is attempted. A test that is inapplicable for one 
validation attempt is not necessarily inapplicable for a subsequent 
attempt. For this validation attempt, 372 tests were inapplicable for the 
reasons indicated: 


a. The following 201 tests are not applicable because they have 
floating-point type declarations requiring more digits than 
SYSTEM.MAX DIGITS: 


C24113L..Y 
C35708L..Y

because the value of SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA is less than 47. 

e. C4A013B is not applicable because the evaluation of an expression 
involving 'MACHINE_RADIX applied to the most precise 
floating-point type would raise an exception; since the expression 
must be static, it is rejected at compile time. 

f. D4A004B is not applicable because this implementation does not 

support a static universal expression with a value that lies 
outside of the range SYSTEM.MIN_INT ... SYSTEM.MAX_INT. 

g. D64005G is not applicable because this implementation does not 

support nesting 17 levels of recursive procedure calls. 

h. B86001Y is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined fixed-point type other than DURATION. 

i. B86001Z is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined floating-point type with a name other than FLOAT, 
L0NG_FL0AT, or SHORT_FLOAT. 

j. C96005B is not applicable because there are no values of type 

DURATION'BASE that are outside the range of DURATION. 

k. CD1009C, CD2A41A..B (2 tests), CD2A41E, and CD2A42A..J (10 tests) 
are not applicable because this implementation does not support 
size clauses for floating point types unless the size given is the 
same as would have been chosen by the compiler. 

l. CD2A61I and CD2A61J are not applicable because this implementation 
does not support size clauses for array types, which imply 
compression, with component types of composite or floating point 
types. This implementation requires an explicit size clause on 
the component type. 

m. CD2A84B..I (8 tests) and CD2A84K..L (2 tests) are not applicable 
because this implementation does not support size clauses for 
access types unless the size given is 32.

TEST INFORMATION 


3.6 TEST, PROCESSING, AND EVALUATION MODIFICATIONS 

It is expected that some tests will require modifications of code, 
processing, or evaluation in order to compensate for legitimate 
implementation behavior. Modifications are made by the AVF in cases where 
legitimate implementation behavior prevents the successful completion of an 
(otherwise) applicable test. Examples of such modifications include: 
adding a length clause to alter the default size of a collection; splitting 
a Class B test into subtests so that all errors are detected; and 
confirming that messages produced by an executable test demonstrate 
conforming behavior that wasn't anticipated by the test (such as raising 
one exception instead of another). 

Modifications were required for 77 tests. 


The following tests were split because syntax errors at one point resulted 
in the compiler not detecting other errors in the test:

C45651A required evaluation modification because the test contains an if 
statement with a range that excludes some allowable values and FAILED may 
be called. The AVO has ruled that the failure message "ABS 928.0 NOT IN 
CORRECT RANGE” may be ignored and the test graded as passed. 

D4A004B was rejected at compile time because it contains a static universal 
expression with a value that lies outside of the range 
SYSTEM.MIN_INT ... SYSTEM.MAX_INT. The AVO has ruled this test as not 
applicable to this implementation. 

CE3202A required evaluation modification because this test does not allow 
the implementation to raise USE_ERR0R for the NAME function. In this 
implementation, there is no name associated with STANDARD_INPUT or 
STANDARD_OUTPUT; the NAME function raises USE ERROR when its argument is 
STANDARD_INPUT or STANDARD_OUTPUT. Therefore, execution of this test 
terminates with an unhandled exception. The AVO has ruled this test as not 
applicable to this implementation.

3.7 ADDITIONAL TESTING INFORMATION 


3.7.1 Prevalidation 

Prior to validation, a set of test results for ACVC Version 1.10 produced 
by the MC68020/0S-2000 Cross Development Facility was submitted to the AVF 
by the applicant for review. Analysis of these results demonstrated that 
the compiler successfully passed all applicable tests, and the compiler 
exhibited the expected behavior on all inapplicable tests. 


3.7.2 Test Method 

Testing of the MC68020/0S-2000 Cross Development Facility using ACVC 
Version 1.10 was conducted on-site by a validation team from the AVF. The 
configuration in which the testing was performed is described by the 
following designations of hardware and software components: 

Host computer: R1000 Series 200 Model 20 

Host operating system: Rational Environment, Version D 11_0_8 

Target computer: Motorola 68020 in Philips PG2105 

Target operating system: 0S-2000, Version 2.2 

Compiler: MC68020/0S-2000 Cross Development 

Facility, Version 5 

The host and target computers were linked via ETHERNET. 

A magnetic tape containing all tests except for withdrawn tests and tests 
requiring unsupported floating-point precisions was taken on-site by the 
validation team for processing. Tests that make use of 
implementation-specific values were customized before being written to the 
magnetic tape. Tests requiring modifications during the prevalidation 
testing were included in their modified form on the magnetic tape. 

The contents of the magnetic tape were loaded directly onto the host 
computer. 

After the test files were loaded to disk, the full set of tests was 
compiled and linked on the R1000 Series 200 Model 20, then all executable 
images were transferred to the Motorola 68020 in Philips PG2100 via 
ETHERNET and run. Results were printed from the host computer. 

The compiler was tested using command scripts provided by Rational and 
reviewed by the validation team. The compiler was tested using all default 
option settings except for the following: 

OPTION EFFECT 


Create_Suprogram_Specs False Missing subprogram specs are not 

automatically created when the 


3-7 









TEST INFORMATION 


subprogram body is added to the 
program library. 


Tests were compiled, linked, and executed (as appropriate) using a single 
host and target computer. Test output, compilation listings, and job logs 
were captured on magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings 
examined on-site by the validation team were also archived. 


3.7.3 Test Site 

Testing was conducted at Santa Clara CA and was completed on 12 July 1989.

Appendix F to the LRM for the Mc68020_0s2000 Target 


The Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language (LRM) specifies that certain features of 
the language are implementation-dependent. It requires that these implementation dependen¬ 
cies be defined in an appendix called Appendix F. This is Appendix F for the Mc68020_0s2000 
target, compiler Version 5. It contains materials on the following topics listed for inclusion by 
the LRM on page F-l: 

• Implementation-dependent pragmas 

• Implementationdependent attributes 

• Package System 

• Representation clauses 

• Implementationdependent components 

• Interpretation of expressions that appear in address clauses 

• Unchecked conversion 

• Implementation-dependent characteristics of I/O Packages 

These topics appear in section and subsection titles of this appendix. The appendix contains 
other topics mentioned in the LRM as being implementation dependent. For these, a reference 
to the LRM is given in the section or subsection title. 


IMPLEMENTATION-DEPENDENT PRAGMAS 

The MC68020/OS-2000 cross-compiler supports pragmas for application software development 
in addition to those listed in Annex B of the LRM. They are described below, along with 
additional clarifications and restrictions for pragmas defined in Annex B of the LRM. 

Pragma Main 

A parameterless library-unit procedure without subunits can be designated as a main program 
by including a pragma Main at the end of the unit specification or body. This pragma causes 
the linker to run and create an executable program when the body of this subprogram is coded. 
Before a unit having a pragma Main can be coded, all units in the with closure of the unit must 
be coded. 

The pragma Main has three arguments: 


RATIONAL 


B-2 






MC68020/OS-2000 CDF Appendix F 


• Target: A string specifying the target key. If this argument appears and it does not match 
the current target key, the pragma Main is ignored. If the Target parameter matches the 
current target key or does not appear, pragma Main is honored. A single source copy of a 
main program may be used for different targets by putting in multiple Main pragmas with 
different target parameters and different stack_sizes and/or different heap__sizes. 

• Stack_Size: A static integer expression specifying the size in bytes of the main task stack. If 
not specified, the default value is 4096 (4K) bytes. 

• Haap_size: A static integer expression specifying the size in bytes of the heap. If not 
specified, the default value is 64K bytes. 

The complete syntax for this pragma is: 

pragma_main : : = PRAGMA MAIN 

[ ( main_option { , main_option } ) } ; 

main_option ::= TARGET => simple_name | 

STACK_SIZE => static_integer_expression | 

HEAP_SIZE => static_intager_axpres3ion 

The pragma Main must appear immediately after the declaration or body of a parameterless 
library-unit procedure without subunits. 

Pragma Nickname 

The pragma Nickname can be used to give a unique string name to a procedure or function in 
addition to its normal Ada name. This unique name can be used to distinguish among over¬ 
loaded procedures or functions in the importing and exporting pragmas defined in subsequent 
sections. 

The pragma Nickname must appear immediately following the declaration for which it is to 
provide a nickname. It has a single argument, the nickname, which must be a string constant. 

For example: 

function Cat (L: Integer; R; String) return String; 
pragma Nickname ("Int-Str-Cat"); 

function Cat (L: String; R: Integer) return String; 
pragma Nickname ("Str-Int-Cat"); 

pragma Interface (Assembly, Cat) ; 

pragma Import_Function (Internal => Cat, 

Nickname => "Int-Str-Cat", 

External => "CAT$INT_STR_CONCAT", 

Mechanism => (Value, Reference)); 

pragma Import_Function (Internal => Cat, 

Nickname => "Str-Int-Cat", 

External => "CAT$STR INT CONCAT", 


B-3

Appendix IV: Appendix F for the Mc68020_0s2000 Target 


Mechanism => (Reference, Value)); 

Pragmas Import_Procedure and Import_Fimction 

A subprogram written in another language (typically, assembly language) can be called from an 
Ada program if it is declared with a pragma Interface. The rules for placement of pragma 
Interface are given in Section 13.9 of the LRM. Every interfaced subprogram must have an 
importing pragma recognized by the MC68020/OS-2000 cross-compiler, either 
Import_Procedure or Import_Function. These pragmas are used to declare the external name of 
the subprogram and the parameter-passing mechanism for the subprogram call. If an interfaced 
subprogram does not have an importing pragma, or if the importing pragma is incorrect, 
pragma interface is ignored. 

Importing pragmas can be applied only to nongeneric procedures and functions. 

The pragmas Import_Procedure and Import_Function are used for importing subprograms. 
Import_Procedure is used to call a non-Ada procedure; Import_Functicn, a non-Ada function. 

Each import pragma must be preceded by a pragma Interrace; otherwise, the placement rules 
for these pragmas are identical to those of the pragma Interface. 

The importing pragmas have the form: 

importing_pragma ::= PRAGMA importing_typa 

( [ INTERNAL => 1 int«mal_name 

[ , [ EXTERNAL => ] exteml_nane ] 

[ [ , [ PARAMETER_TYPES => ] 

paraxneter__type3 ] 

[ , [ RESULTJOTE => ] type_marlc ] ] 

[ , NICKNAME =>• string_literal ] 

[ , [ MECHANISM => ] mechanisms ] ) ; 

importing_type : : = IMPORT_PROCEDURE 1 IMPORT_FUNCTION | 

IMPORT_VALUED__PROCEDURS 
internal_name ::= identifier | 

string_literal — An operator designator 

extemal_nama = identifier j string_literal 

parameter_types ::* ( NULL ) | ( type_mark ( , type_mark ) ) 

mechanisms ::= mechanism_name | 

( mechanism_name { , mechanism_nazne ) ) 

mechanism_name ::= VALUE | REFERENCE 

The internal name is the Ada name of the subprogram being interfaced. If more than one 
subprogram is in the declarative region preceding the importing pragma, the correct 
subprogram must be identified by either using the argument types (and result type, if a 
function) or specifying the nickname. 


RATIONAL 


B-4 





MC68020/OS-2000 CDF Appendix F 


If it is used to identify a subprogram with an overloaded internal name, the value of the 
Parameter_Types argument consists of a list of type or subtype names, not names of 
parameters. Each one corresponds positionally to a formal parameter in the subprogram's 
declaration. If the subprogram has no parameters, the list consists of the single word null. For a 
function, the value of the Result_Type argument is the name of the type returned by the 
function. 

The external designator, specified with the External parameter, is a character string that is an 
identifier suitable for the MC68020 assembler. If the external designator is not specified, the 
internal name is used. 

The Mechanism argumpnt is required if the subprogram has any parameters. The argument 
specifies, in a parenthesized list, the passing mechanism for each parameter to be passed. There 
must be a mechanism specified for each parameter listed in parameter_types and they must 
correspond positionally. The types of mechanism are as follows. 

• Value: Specifies that the parameter is passed on the stack by immediate value. 

• Reference: Specifies that the parameter is passed on the stack by address. Used for 
structures having many values. 

For functions, it is not possible to specify the passing mechanism of the function result; the 
standard Ada mechanism for the given type of the function result must be used by the 
interfaced subprogram. If there are parameters, and they all use the same passing mechanism, 
then an alternate form for the Mechanism argument can be used: instead of a parenthesized list 
with an element for each parameter, the single mechanism name (not parenthesized) can be 
used instead. 

Examples: 

procedure Locate (Source: in String;

Pragmas Export_Procedure and Export_Function 

A subprogram written in Ada can be made accessible to code written in another language by 
using an exporting pragma defined by the MC68020/OS-2000 cross-compiler. Thp effect of such 
a pragma is to give the subprogram a defined symbolic name that the linker can use when 
resolving references between object modules. 

Exporting pragmas can be applied only to nongeneric procedures and functions. 

An exporting pragma can be given only for subprograms that are library units or that are 
declared in the specification of a library package. An exporting pragma can be placed after a 
subprogram body only if the subprogram does not have a separate specification. Thus, an 
exporting pragma cannot be applied to the body of a library subprogram that has a separate 
specification. 

These pragmas have similar arguments to the importing pragmas, except that it is not possible 
to specify the parameter-passing mechanism. The standard Ada parameter-passing 
mechanisms are chosen. For descriptions of the pragma's arguments (Internal, External, 
Parameter_Types, Result_Type, and Nickname), see the preceding section on the importing 
pragmas. 

The full syntax of the pragmas for exporting subprograms is: 

exporting_j?ragma ::= PRAGMA exporting_type 

( [ INTERNAL => ] internal_name 

[ , [ EXTERNAL => ] external_nama ] 

[ [ , [ PARAMETER_TYPES => ] parameter_types ]

Examples:

(A, B: in Matrix; C: out Matrix); 

pragma Export_Procedure (Matrix_Multiply); 

— External name is the string "Matrix_Multiply"

function Sin (R: Radians) return Float; 
pragma Export_Function 

(Internal => Sin, 

External => "SIN_RADIANS"); 

— External name is the string "SIN_RADIANS" 

Pragma Export_Elaboration_Procedure 

The pragma Export_Elaboration_Procedure makes the elaboration procedure for a given 
compilation unit available to external code by defining a global symbolic name. This procedure 
is otherwise unnamable by the user. Its use is confined to the exceptional circumstances where 
an Ada module is not elaborated because it is not in the closure of the main program or if the 
main program is not an Ada program. This pragma is not recommended for use in application 
programs unless the user has a thorough understanding of elaboration, runtime and storage 
model considerations. 

The pragma Export_Elaboration_Procedure must appear immediately following the 
compilation unit. 

The complete syntax for this pragma is: 

pragma_export_elaboration_procedura ::= 

PRAGMA EXPORT_ELABORATION_PROCEDURE ( EXTERNAL_NAME => extemal_name ) ; 

extemal_name : :» identifier | 3tring_literal 


Pragmas Import_Object and Export_Object 

Objects can be imported or exported from an Ada unit with the pragmas Import_Object and 
Export_Object. The pragma Import_Ob]ect causes an Ada name to reference storage declared 
and allocated in some external (non-Ada) object module. The pragma Export_Object provides 
an object declared within an Ada unit with an external symbolic name that the linker can use to 
allow another program to access the object. It is the responsibility of the programmer to ensure 
that the internal structure of the object and the assumptions made by the importing code and 
data structures correspond. The cross-compiler cannot check for such correspondence. 

The object to be imported or exported must be a variable declared at the outermost level of a 
library package specification or body. 

The size of the object must be static. Thus, the type of the object must be one of: 

• A scalar type (or subtype) 

• An array subtype with static index constraints whose component size is static 

• A simple record type or subtype 

Objects of a private or limited private type can be imported or exported only into the package 
that declares the type. 

Imported objects cannot have an initial value and thus cannot be: 


B-7 


RATIONAL 






Appendix IV: Appendix F for the Mc68020_0s2000 Target 


• A constant 

• An access type 

• A task type 

• A record type with discriminants, with components having default initial expressions, or 
with components that are access types or task types 

In addition, the object must not be in a generic unit. The external name sp .cified must be 
suitable as an identifier in the assembler. 

The full syntax for the pragmas Import_Object and ExportjDbject is: 

object_jpragma : : = PRAGMA object_pragma_type 

{ [ INTERNAL => ] identifier 

[ , [ EXTERNAL => ] string_literal ] ) ; 

object_pragma_type : : = IMPORT_OBJECT | EXPORT_OBJECT 

Pragma Suppress_All 

This pragma is equivalent to the following sequence of pragmas: 

pragma Suppress (Accesa_Check); 
pragma Suppress (Discriminant_Check); 
pragma Suppress (Division_Check) ; 
pragma Suppress (Elaboration__Check) ; 
pragma Suppress (Indeae_Check) ; 
pragma Suppress (LengthjCheck); 
pragma Suppress (Over£low_Check); 
pragma Suppress (Range_Check); 
pragma Suppress (StoragejCheck); 

Note that, like pragma Suppress, pragma Suppress_All does not prevent the raising of certain 
exceptions. For example, numeric overflow or dividing by zero is detected by the hardware, 
which results in the predefined exception Numeric_Error. Refer to Chapter 5, "Runtime 
Organization " for more information. 

Pragma Suppress_All must appear immediately within a declarative part. 

Pragma Must_Be_An_Entry 

This pragma applies to an IPC generic formal subprogram. It is used to provide compile-time 
checks that: (1) the subprogram appears in a generic formal part; (2) the associated identifier is a 
formal subprogram; (3) for each instantiation of the generic the actual is a task entry. A 
warning is issued if any of these checks fail.

IMPLEMENTATION-DEPENDENT ATTRIBUTES 

The implementation-dependent attributes are as follows: 

'Compiler_Version For a name N, N'Compiler_Version is a compile-time value, a 16- 

character uninterpreted string that designates the compiler version used 
to code this Ada entity. The entity may be a program unit (package, 
subprogram, task, or generic), an object (variable, constant, named 
number, or parameter), a type or subtype (but not an incomplete type), or 
an exception. This attribute can be used for runtime detection of 
incompatibilities in data representation. See also 'TargetJKey. 

'Dope_Address For an unconstrained array object A, A'Dope_Address is the address of 

the dope vector. The value is of type System.Address. This can be used 
for retrieving information about the object, as when reconstructing the 
array. See also 'Dope_Size. 

'Dope_Size For an unconstrained array object A, A'Dope_Size is the size in bits of the 

dope vector. The value is of type Universal_Integer. This can be used for 
retrieving information about the object, as when reconstructing the array. 
See also 'Dope_Address. 

'Entry_Number For a task entry or generic formal subprogram E, E'EntryJVumber iden¬ 
tifies the entity with a universal-integer value. This may be used by the 
runtime system to indicate that the entity corresponds to a process in the 
target and therefore requires an IPC queue. 

'Mechanism For a subprogram S with formal parameter P or the result of a function F, 

S'Mechanism(P) or F'Mechanism is a universal-integer value that desig¬ 
nates the parameter-passing or function-return mechanism. This may be 
used by the EPC message-handling facilities to manipulate the data 
passed. 

Currently, parameter-passing values and their meanings include: 

1 parameter value is on the stack 

2 parameter address is on the stack 

3 parameter and dope vector address are on the stack 

4 parameter address and 'Constrained datum are on the stack 

Currently, function-return values and their meanings include: 

11 result is returned in registers 

15 address for the array result is on the stack 

16 address for the result is in RO, result is on the stack 

17 address for the record result is on the stack

Some details of parameter passing are subject to change with new re¬ 
leases of the cross-compiler. See the software release note for additional 
information. 

For a name N, NTarget_Key is a compile-time value, a 32-character 
uninterpreted string that designates the cross-compiler (that is, the target 
key) in effect when this entity was coded. This can be used for runtime 
detection of incompatibilities in data representation. See also 
'Compiler_Version. 

For a type mark T declared in a subsytem, T'Type_Key is a unique 32-

REPRESENTATION CLAUSES AND CHANGES OF REPRESENTATON 

The MC68020 CDF support for representation clauses is described in this section with reference 
to the relevant section of the LRM. Usage of a clause that is unsupported as specified in this 
section or usage contrary to LRM specification will cause a semantic error unless specifically 
noted. 

Length Clauses (LRM 13.2) 

Length clauses are supported for the MC68020/OS-2000 CDF as follows: 

• The value in a 'Size clause must be a positive static integer expression. 'Size clauses are 
supported for all scalar and composite types, including derived types, with the following 
restrictions: 

— For all types the value of the size attribute must be greater than equal to the minimum size 
necessary to store the largest possible value of the type. 


RATIONAL 


B- 12 








MC68020/OS-2000 CDF Appendix F 


— For discrete types, the value of the size attribute must be less than or equal to 32. 

— For fixed types, the value of the size attribute must be less than or equal to 32. 

— For float tvpes, the size clause can only specify the size the type would have if there were 
no clause. 

— For access and task types, the value of the size attribute must be 32. 

— For composite types, a size specification must not imply compression of composite 
components. Such compression must have been explicitly requested using a length clause 
or pragma Pack on the component type. 

• 'Storage_Size clauses are supported for access and task types. The value given in a 
Storage_Sfze clause may be any integer expression, and it is not required to be static. 

• 'Small clauses are supported for fixed point types. The value given in a 'Small clause must 
be a non-zero static real number. 

Enumeration Representation Clauses ( LRM 13.3) 

Enumeration representation clauses are supported with the following restrictions. 

• The values given in the clause must be in ascending order. 

• Every enumeration literal must have a unique integer value assigned to it. 

• The allowable values for an enumeration clause range from (Integer 7 First + 1) to IntegeriLast. 

• Negative numbers are allowed. 

Record Representation Clauses (LRM 23.4) 

Both full and partial representation clauses are supported for both discriminated and 
undiscriminated records. The static_3impla_expresaion in the alignment clause part of a 
record representation clause (see LRM 13.4 (4) ) must be a power of two with the following 
limits: 1 <= static_3impla_expres3ion <= 16 . 

The size specified for a discrete field in a component clause must not exceed 32 . 

Implementation-Dependent Components 

The LRM allows for the generation of names denoting implementation-dependent components 
in records. For the MC68020/OS-2000 CDF, there are no such names visible to the user. 

Address Clauses (LRM 13.5) 

Address clauses are not supported and will generate a semantic error if used.. 

Change of Representation ( LRM 13.6) 

Change of representation is supported wherever it is implied by support for representation 
specifications. In particular, type conversions between array types or record types may cause 


B-13 


RATIONAL 







Appendix IV: Appendix F tor the Mcb8O2O_0s2OOO Target 


packing or unpacking to occur; conversions between related enumeration types with different 
representations may result in table lookup operations. 


OTHER IMPLEMENTATION-DEPENDENT FEATURES 
Machine Code (LRM 13.8) 

Machine-code insertions are not supported at this time. 

Unchecked Storage Deallocation (LRM 13.10.1) 

Unchecked storage deallocation is implemented by the generic function 
Unchecked_Deallocation defined by the LRM. This procedure can be instantiated with an 
object type and its access type resulting in a procdure that deallocates the object's storage. 
Objects of any type may be deallocated. 

The storage reserved for the entire collection is reclaimed when the program exits the scope in 
which the access type is declared. Placing an access type declaration within a block can be a 
useful implementation strategy when conservation of memory is necessary. 

Erroneous use of dangling references may be detected in certain cases. When detected, the 
exception Storage_Erro- is raised. Deallocation of objects that were not created through 
allocation (ie through Unchecked_Conversion) may also be detected in certain cases and raises 
Storage_Error. 

Unchecked Type Conversion (LRM 13.10.2) 

Unchecked conversion is implemented by the generic function unchecked_Conversion defined 
by the LRM. This function can be instantiated with Source and Target types resulting in a 
function that converts source data values into target data values. 

Unchecked conversion moves storage units from the source object to the target object 
sequentially, starting with the lowest address. Transfer continues until the source object is 
exhausted or the target object runs out of room. If the target is larger than the source then the 
remaining bits are undefined. Depending on the target computer architecture, the result of 
conversions may be right or left aligned. 

Restrictions on Unchecked Type Conversion 

• The target type or an unchecked conversion cannot be an unconstrained array type or an 
unconstrained discriminated type without default discriminants. 

• Internal consistency among components of the target type is not guaranteed. Discriminant 
components may contain illegal values or be inconsistent with the use of those discriminants 
elsewhere in the type representation.

CHARACTERISTICS OF I/O PACKAGES 

This section specifies the implementation-dependent characteristics of the I/O packages 
Sequentialjo, Directjo, Textjo, and Io_Exceptions. These packages are located in the library 
'.Targets.Mc68020_0s2000.1o. Non-dependent characteristics are as given in Chapter 14 of the 
LRM. Each section below sites the relevant section in Chapter 14. 

The package 0s2000_lo is provided as an interface to many of the 0s2000 I/O system calls. 
0s2000_lo is in the library 'Targets.Mc68020_0s2000. Target_Interface. 

Package Low_Level_Io is not provided for the Mc68020_0s2000 target. 

External Files and File Objects (LRM 14.1) 

An external file is identified by a Name and further charaterized by a Form parameter. The 
allowable strings for the Name are the legal file names and full or relative pathlists accepted by 
0s2000. See the OS-9/68000 Operating System User's Manual for details. 

The recognized values for the Form parameter string are those containing the identifiers 
Non Jsharable or Sharable. All other elements of the Form string are ignored. These values of 
the Form parameter determine the setting of the Os2000 SingleJJser bit when opening or 
creating the external file. If the Form is Sharable, then the SingleJJser bit is true, if the Form is 
NonJSharable, then the SingIe_User bit is false. The default values for the Form are Sharable for 
In mode files and Non_Sharable for Inout and Out mode files. If a Form parameter contains 
both identifiers Non_Sharable and Sharable, then Form will be Non_Sharable. 

If a main program completes without closing some Text_Io file, then any data output to the file 
after the last line or page terminator will not be included in the associated external file. 

Input and output are erroneous for access types. 

Sequential and Direct Files 

This section deals with implementation-dependent features associated with the packages 
Sequentialjo and Directjo and the file types sequential access and direct access. 

File Management (LRM 14.2.1) 

The exception Use_Error is raised in the following situations: 

• By the procedure Create if an external file with the specified Name already exists. 

• By the procedure Open if the executing process does not have correct access rights for the 
external file. 

• By the procedure Open if another process has already opened the external file for 
non-sharable use. 

• By either procedure Create or Open if accessing the external file would exceed the Os2000 
limit on the number of open files for the executing process. 


B — 15 


RATIONAL 






Appendix IV: Appendix F for the Mc68020_Os2CC0 Tuiget 


• By the procedure Open if the external file is currently opened by another process with mode 
Out or Inout. 

Sequential Input-Output (LRM 14.2.2) 

For the Read procedure of SequentiaMo, the exception Data_Error is only raised when the size 
of the data read from the file is greater than the size of the out parameter Item. 

Direct Input-Output (LRM 14.2.4) 

Package Direct_Io may not be instantiated with any type which is either an unconstrained array 
type or a discriminated record type without default discriminants. A semantic error is reported 
when attempting to install any unit which contains an instantiation where the actual type is 
such a forbidden type. 

For the Read procedure of Direct_Io, there is no check performed to ensure that the data read 
from the file can be interpreted as a value of the Element_Type. 

Specification of the Package Direct_Io (LRM 14.25) 

The declaration of the type Count in the package Direct_Io is 

type Count is new Integer range 0 .. Integer'Last / Element_Type'Size; 

where Element_Type is the generic formal type parameter. 

Text Input-Output (LRM 14.3) 

The Text_Io default input and output files are associated with the 0s2000 standard input and 
standard output paths respectively. Lf a program is initiated without any of the standard input, 
standard output, or standard error output, then those paths are opened for device /nil. The 
terminators used by Text_Io are Ascii.Cr for the line terminator, and the sequence Ascii.Ff, 
Ascii.Cr for the page terminator, except for terminators at the end of file which are implicit and 
not represented by any characters. 

File Management (LRM 145.1) 

The Text_Io function Name raises Use_Error when called with either Text_Io.Standard_Input or 
Text_Io.Standard_Output as the actual parameter. This implementation for Name was chosen 
because 0s2000 does not provide a uniform mechanism for obtaining a string name for the 
external file associated with a path. 

Specification of the Package Text_Io (LRM 14.3.10) 

The declaration of the type Count in Text_Io is 

type Count is range 0 .. 1_000_000_000; 

The declaration of the subtype Field in Text_Io is 

subtype Field is Integer range 0 .. Integer'Last;

APPENDIX D 


WITHDRAWN TESTS 


Some tests are withdrawn from the ACVC because they do not conform to the 
Ada Standard. The following 44 tests had been withdrawn at the time of 
validation testing for the reasons indicated. A reference of the form 
Al-ddddd is to an Ada Commentary. 


a. E28005C: This test expects that the string "— TOP OF PAGE. —63” of 
line 204 will appear at the top of the listing page due to a pragma 
PAGE in line 203; but line 203 contains text that follows the pragma, 
and it is this text that must appear at the top of the page. 

b. A39005G: This test unreasonably expects a component clause to pack an 
array component into a minimum size (line 30). 

c. B97102E: This test contains an unintended illegality: a select 
statement contains a null statement at the place of a selective wait 
alternative (line 31). 

d. C97116A: This test contains race conditions, and it assumes that 

guards are evaluated indivisibly. A conforming implementation may use 
interleaved execution in such a way that the evaluation of the guards 
at lines 50 & 54 and the execution of task CHANGING 0F_THE_GUARD 

results in a call to REPORT.FAILED at one of lines 52 or 56. 

e. BC3009B: This test wrongly expects that circular instantiations will 
be detected in several compilation units even though none of the units 
is illegal with respect to the units it depends on; by AI-00256, the 
illegality need not be detected until execution is attempted (line 
95). 

f. CD2A62D: This test wrongly requires that an array object's size be no 
greater than 10 although its subtype's size was specified to be 40 
(line 137). 

g. CD2A63A..D, CD2A66A..D, CD2A73A..D, and CD2A76A..D (16 tests): These 


D-l 









WITHDRAWN TESTS 


tests wrongly attempt to check the size of objects of a derived type 
(for which a 'SIZE length clause is given) by passing them to a 
derived subprogram (which implicitly converts them to the parent type 
(Ada standard 3.4:14)). Additionally, they use the 'SIZE length 
clause and attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic 
by the WG9 ARG. 

h. CD2A81G, CD2A83G, CD2A84M..N, and CD50110 (5 tests): These tests 

assume that dependent tasks will terminate while the main program 
executes a loop that simply tests for task termination; this is not 
the case, and the main program may loop indefinitely (lines 74, 85, 
86, 96, and 58, respectively). 

i. CD2B15C and CD7205C: These tests expect that a 'STORAGE_SIZE length 
clause provides precise control over the number of designated objects 
in a collection; the Ada standard 13.2:15 allows that such control 
must not be expected. 

j. CD2D11B: This test gives a SMALL representation clause for a derived 
fixed-point type (at line 30) that defines a set of model numbers that 
are not necessarily represented in the parent type; by Commentary 
AI-00099, all model numbers of a derived fixed-point type must be 
representable values of the parent type. 

k. CD5007B: This test wrongly expects an implicitly declared subprogram 
to be at the address that is specified for an unrelated subprogram 
(line 303). 

l. ED7004B, ED7005C..D, and ED7006C..D (5 tests): These tests check 
various aspects of the use of the three SYSTEM pragmas; the AVO 
withdraws these tests as being inappropriate for validation. 

m. CD7105A: This test requires that successive calls to CALENDAR.CLOCK 
change by at least SYSTEM.TICK; however, by Commentary AI-00201, it is 
only the expected frequency of change that must be at least 
SYSTEM.TICK—particular instances of change may be less (line 29). 

n. CD7203B and CD7204B: These tests use the 'SIZE length clause and 
attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic by the WG9 
ARG. 

o. CD7205D: This test checks an invalid test objective: it treats the 
specification of storage to be reserved for a task's activation as 
though it were like the specification of storage for a collection. 

p. CE2107I: This test requires that objects of two similar scalar types 
be distinguished when read from a file—DATA_ERR0R is expected to be 
raised by an attempt to read one object as of the other type. 
However, it is not clear exactly how the Ada standard 14.2.4:4 is to 
be interpreted; thus, this test objective is not considered valid 
(line 90).

WITHDRAWN TESTS 


q. CE3111C: This test requires certain behavior, when two files are 
associated with the same external file, that is not required by the 
Ada standard. 

r. CE3301A: This test contains several calls to END_OF_LINE and 

END_OF_PAGE that have no parameter: these calls were intended to 
specify a file, not to refer to STANDARD_INPUT (lines 103, 107, 118, 
132, and 136). 

s. CE3411B: This test requires that a text file's column number be set to 
COUNT'LAST in order to check that LAYOUT ERROR is raised by a 
subsequent PUT operation. But the former operation will generally 
raise an exception due to a lack of available disk space, and the test 
would thus encumber validation testing.
