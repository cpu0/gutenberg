@ Secure Display of Space-Exploration Images 

NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California 


Java EDR Display Interface (JEDI) is 
software for either local display or se- 
cure Internet distribution, to author- 
ized clients, of image data acquired 
from cameras aboard spacecraft en- 
gaged in exploration of remote planets. 
(“EDR” signifies “experimental data 
record,” which, in effect, signifies image 
data.) Processed at NASA’s Multimission 
Image Processing Laboratory (MIPL), 
the data can be from either near-real- 
time processing streams or stored files. 
JEDI uses the Java Advanced Imaging 
application program interface, plus 
input/ output packages that are parts of 


the Video Image Communication and 
Retrieval software of the MIPL, to dis- 
play images. JEDI can be run as either a 
standalone application program or 
within a Web browser as a servlet with an 
applet front end. In either operating 
mode, JEDI communicates using the 
HTTP(s) protocol (s). In the Web- 
browser case, the user must provide a 
password to gain access. For each user 
and/ or image data type, there is a con- 
figuration file, called a “personality 
file,” containing parameters that con- 
trol the layout of the displays and the in- 
formation to be included in them. Once 


JEDI has accepted the user’s password, 
it processes the requested EDR (pro- 
vided that user is authorized to receive 
the specific EDR) to create a display ac- 
cording to the user’s personality file. 

This program was written by Cecilia 
Cheng, Gillian Thornhill, and Michael 
McAuley of Caltech for NASA’s Jet Propul- 
sion Laboratory. Further information is 
contained in a TSP (see page 1).
