A structured-geometry model for dispersed and graded deposits was developed 
for chemical vapor infiltration of multiply-woven substrates of carbon filters. An 
earlier model was modified to allow for two reactants in the feed. The model predicts 
gas-phase concentration profiles in the voids of substrates and deposition amounts 
of two reactants as a function of time and location. Results are shown for feeding 
reactant gases simultaneously for dispersed deposition and periodically for the study 
of the graded deposition for a typical substrate. The variation in relative contents 
of reactants in the feed with time shows how the composition of the deposit varies. 
Porosities and changes of dimensions with time everywhere in the substrate are also 
predicted. This is an advantage of the structured-geometry model vs. a simplified 
homogeneous geometry for the substrate. Such a simplification may preclude pre- 
dicting failure, such as delamlnation, which would require a local description of the 
composite structure. 

Sensitivity to input parameters such as temperature, pressure, and reactant feed 
concentration is discussed, and two substrate geometries are compared. 

The behavior of the system is predicted to be dominated by the times to fill gaps 
between filaments at the ply surfaces and the outermost space between plies. Fur- 
thermore, faster kinetics and slower reactant diffusion favor deposition of one 
material near the surface of a ply or the matrix and the other near the center of the 
ply or matrix. By manipulating feed rates of reactants, uniformity of material and 
overall porosity of the composites are predicted to be enhanced. 



Introduction 

Ceramic materials have good mechanical properties at high 
temperatures, low density, and resistance to corrosion and 
erosion. Fiber reinforcement adds strength and toughness. Such 
fiber-reinforced composites can be prepared, for example, by 
sintering and hotpressing of mixtures of powders and chopped 
fibers and by chemical vapor infiltration (CVI). One advantage 
of CVI is that the fibers are not stressed during preparation. 
■ During deposition, reactant gases diffuse from the outside 
surface of the sample, introducing an internal concentration 
gradient. This gradient can result in a deposition profile in the

depressurization or applying a temperature gradient at

decreasing concentration of reactant gases.

poulos model is based on a Bethe lattice and on porous solids 
by Jensen and Melkote (1989) and Sotirchos and Tomadakis 
(1989). Also models have been proposed for a fiber bundle 
based on cylindrical pores (Rossignol et al., 1984; Tai and 
Chou, 1989) and based on a random overlap model (Currier, 
1990). These prior models all refer to homogeneous geometry 
within the sample. In contrast, the models of Chung et al. 
(1991, 1992) for layered plies of woven tows (rectangular bun- 
dles of filaments) consider the detailed distribution of void 
spaces and surfaces within the sample. 

The Chung et al. models were for aligned holes (Chung et 
al., 1991) and maximum staggering (Chung et al., 1992) of the 
holes through the plies. These models considered diffusion in 
the voids and deposition on the surfaces in the holes between 
tows, spaces between plies, and gaps around filaments. The 
aligned-hole and maximum staggered-hole arrangements rep- 
resent bounds of weave configuration. The staggered-hole 
model (maximum staggering) is applied in this research to 
predict intraparticle deposition and porosities for dispersed 
and graded deposits, that is, where two components are de- 
posited in the weave. The two components used here are TiBj 
I and SiC. Silicon carbide is produced by the chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD) from dichloro-dimethylsilane (DDS) and hy- 
drogen. The model assumes that the overall deposition kinetics 
are first-order in DDS. Titanium diboride is also a refractory 
material and relatively inert to oxidation and chemical attack. 
Kinetic data on the CVD of TiB 2 were reported by Peshev and 
Niemyski (1965). Deposition rates and efficiencies for CVD 
of TiB 2 from TiCl 4 , BC1 3 , and H 2 were experimentally deter- 
mined as a function of various variables by Besman and Spear 
t (1977). They fitted experimental data with the assumption that 
1 the chemical kinetic step is first-order with respect to the partial 
1 pressure of the limiting species. The same assumption that the 
I overall deposition kinetics are first-order in TiCU, the limiting 
reactant, is used in this research. 

The model predicts how the gaseous concentration profiles, 
the overall rate of deposition, the final porosity, and the di- 
mensions in the sample change with time due to depositions 
of two components. The first objective was to show how the 



contents of each component in the deposit can be controlled 
by changing the relative contents of reactants in the feed. For 
this we tested three cases for a typical substrate: I. mixtures 
of constant composition of DDS and TiCl 4 (along with BC1 3 
and H2) enter the sample simultaneously and at constant com- 
position throughout the whole reaction time; II. DDS and TiCU 
enter simultaneously, but the compositions are programmed 
to change with time (see Table 1); and III. pure DDS and TiCU 
enter sequentially at two-hour time intervals. Cases I and III 
may be described as dispersed deposition, and case II as graded 
deposition. As a second objective, sensitivity computations 
were made to show the effects of pressure, temperature, and 
reactant feed concentrations for two substrates of different 
geometry. 

Model Development 

The model for infiltration of SiC and TiB 2 is based on the 
same geometry as used for the staggered-hole model (Chung 
et al., 1992). Mass transfer of the reactant gases is considered 
to occur only by diffusion. The substrate geometry consists of 
13 layers (plies) of woven fabric, as shown in Figure 1. In the 
plies each tow is rectangular in cross-section and consists of a 
bundle of nonporous filaments woven to form approximately 
square holes. The plies are spaced so that the holes in one ply 
are positioned at the center of the adjacent four holes in the 
upper and lower plies (maximum staggering of holes). The 
filaments within a tow are arranged on triangular centers. 
Diffusion of gaseous DDS and TiCU occurs from both ends 
toward the center of the sample by going through the holes, 
through the spaces between plies, and through the gaps around 
the filaments. Because of symmetry, the model needs to con- 
sider only half of the sample. Numbering of holes, spaces and 
plies begins from the outside hole, space, and ply, as indicated 
in Figure 2. 

While deposition occurs in the gaps around filaments in the 
inner plies, there is also deposition on the outside flat surfaces 
of the outer plies. Since the distance (b) between plies is small, 
the first space in Figure 2 is plugged before gaps around the

outer filaments of the inner plies are plugged. For this situation, 
deposition in the middle of the sample ceases before the gaps 
are filled around the outer filaments of the inner plies. 

As in the staggered-hole model, the following assumptions 
are involved. The sample is isothermal. Diffusion is one-di- 
mensional in the holes and the gaps around filaments, and 
two-dimensional in the spaces between plies. Hence, there is 
no concentration gradient in the x and y directions in the holes, 
and no concentration gradient in the z direction in the spaces 
between plies. The assumption that the diffusion velocity in 
the void regions is large with respect to the rate of change of 
the thickness of the deposit (Bischoff , 1963) is also used. With 
this assumption, gaseous diffusion in the voids can be treated 
as a (pseudo) steady-state process. As deposition occurs, the 
concentration profiles in the void regions change as the porosity 
and surface area change. In addition, it is assumed that there 
is negligible diffusion from the holes into the gaps around the 
filaments along the edge of the ply. After filling the gaps 
around the filaments along the edge of the ply, this region of 
the hole wall is considered to be a flat surface on which dep- 
osition occurs, reducing the dimension of the hole. The surfaces 
of each ply are assumed to be flat. The error in surface area 
due to neglecting overlapping of tows should be negligible, 
because the thickness of a tow is very small. The effect on the 
diffusion coefficient due to the uneven surface is accounted 
for by a tortuosity factor of \ll. 

The hole is divided into two parts: one part is the hole wall 
along the edge of the ply (distance, c„ ) where deposition occurs, 
and the other part is the open space between plies of distance, 



b„, where diffusion takes place into the x and> regions between 
plies (Figure 2). Deposition starts on the hole wall, along dis- 
tance c„, after the gaps are filled around the outer filaments. 
Before the gaps around the filaments at the boundary between 
the hole and the next ply are plugged, the depth of a hole, h„ 
is h . After those gaps are filled, h„ decreases due to the dep- 
osition at the bottom of the hole. Deposition on the flat surface 
of one ply starts after the gaps around the outer filaments are 
filled with deposit. Before these gaps are filled, the mass bal- 
ance in the spaces between plies includes diffusion on both 
sides of a ply. After filling the gaps around the outer filaments, 
deposition occurs on the flat surfaces of the upper and surfaces 
of the lower plies. In the gaps, deposition occurs on the outside 
surface of the cylindrical filaments. Deposition in the gaps in 
each ply stops when the radius of outer filaments is equal to 
r„, the plugging radius. The procedure for evaluating r, is 
explained previously (Chung et al., 1992). 

The model is developed by solving mass-balance equations 
for gas-phase concentrations of reactants DDS and TiCl 4 for 
the three parts of the system (holes, spaces, and gaps) combined ' 
with equations for the change with time of the dimensions of 
the system. Mass-balance equations for each component arc 
the same as shown in the previous article (Chung et al., 1992), 
except that one more suffix is needed to identify the reacta* 
species. Two sets of mass-balance equations, one set for DDS 
and the other for TiCU, are solved. 

For case III, the precursors enter sequentially in the f#f 
with compositions given in Table 1 . When one component *

switched to the other, it is assumed that effects of the leftover 
amount of the previously changed component are small com- 
pared to the deposition of that component during the time 
interval. Hence, the concentrations inside the sample of the 
previously fed reactant are assumed to be zero when the other 
reactant enters the sample. 

Change of dimensions with time 

The concentration profiles in the voids change with dimen- 
sions of the system: the side length of the hole, distance between 
plies, thickness of the ply, and radius of the filament. These 
dimensions change with time due to depositions of TiB 2 and 
SiC, and are expressed by the mass-balance equations that 
follow.

The method of solution of these equations is first to calculate 
the concentration profiles at a given time in the holes, spaces 
between plies, and gaps around the filaments, employing the 
pseudo-steady-state equations (Chung et al., 1992). Then, the 
change in dimensions for a chosen time increment is calculated 
using Eqs. 1- 10 with the calculated concentration profiles. This 
procedure is repeated for successive time increments to yield 
concentration profiles and dimensions of the system as a func- 
tion of time. From these results, deposition amounts and po- 
rosities are evaluated. Changes in dimensions due to depositions 
of SiC and TiB 2 can be obtained separately for each time 
increment. With these changes in dimensions due to each com- 
ponent, the amount of deposition of each component in the 
deposit also can be calculated. 

The equations were first made dimensionless and then solved 
numerically in finite-difference form with 50 nodal points in 
the z direction in the hole, 10 x 10 nodal points in x and y 
directions in the space, and five nodal points in the z " direction 
in the gaps. The smaller number of nodal points in the space 
between plies and gaps around filaments was chosen to obtain 
a reasonable computing time without sacrificing accuracy and 
a time comparable to that for the single-component deposition 
calculation in the staggered-hole model. A time increment of 
2 min was chosen for processing times. All the calculations 
were done with either FPS264 or Cray Y-MP supercomputers, 
requiring about 2.5 h FPS cpu time and about 25 min Cray 
cpu time for a typical run. The complex substrate geometry 
and multiple operating parameters lead to extensive numerical 
data. For brevity, illustrative results are displayed only for gas- 
phase concentrations, deposit compositions, and overall po- 
rosities, primarily as a function of time. 

Results and Discussion 

Dimensions and deposition conditions for dispersed and 
graded deposition 

Table 1 lists initial substrate dimensions and deposition con- 
ditions used to compare results for the three operating pro- 
cedures (cases 1, 2, and 3). The dimensions are measurable 
quantities in a particular system. At the reaction conditions in 
Table 1, the first-order reaction rate constant for SiC depo- 
sition, k s of 10 cm/min (Chung et al., 1992), was used. Besman 
and Spear (1977) measured the deposition rate of TiB 2 from 
TiCl 4 , BC1 3 , and H 2 as 0.5 mg/cm 2 min at 925°C. Using this 
value and the concentration of BC1, employed in their exper- 
iment, the equivalent first-order reaction rate constant (based 
on TiCl 4 ) for TiB 2 deposition, k T , was estimated as 35 cm/ 
min. 

Effective diffusion coefficients in the space between plies 
and in the gaps around filaments were obtained in the same 
way as mentioned in the staggered-hole model (Chung et al., 
1992). The effective diffusion coefficient in the uneven space 
between plies was estimated using a tortuosity factor V2. The 
effective diffusion coefficient in the gaps around the filaments 
was estimated from the porosity and the initial tortuosity fac- 
tor, k , according to the equation D eg = D mk «/k„. Since the

in obtaining effective diffusion coefficients in the gaps around 
the filaments. The parameter values in Table 1 are based on 
the geometries for a typical substrate fabricated at the NASA 
Ames Research Center and used to compare results for the 
three operating procedures. 

Gas-phase concentration profiles 

The general trend of concentration change with time is sim- 
ilar to that for single-component deposition. Hence, only a 
few illustrations are shown. The concentration of TiCl 4 for 
case 1 (simultaneous deposition) in the middle of each hole is 
shown in Figure 3. All the curves decrease at low times because 
of increasing reactant depletion caused by increasing surface 
area around filaments. Also, there is a drop in concentration 
(point A in Figure 3) when the gaps around the outer filaments 
of the sample are plugged, because the diffusion flux into the 
gaps around filaments from the outside of the sample ceases 
after this time. The first hole becomes the only passage for 
diffusion into the sample from outside. After this concentra- 
tion drop, the concentration in the second hole increases as 
the gaps around the outer filaments at the ply surfaces in the 
first space are progressively plugged. During this time the con- 
centrations in the deeper inside of the sample drop a little, due 
to less diffusion through the gaps around filaments in the 
second ply. The point C in Figure 3 is the time that gaps around 
the outer filaments at the ply surfaces in the first space (space 
between plies one and two) are plugged completely. At this

( ime. ttie inner concentrations increase. After plugging the gaps 
ar ound the outer filaments at both sides of first ply and the 
u pper side of second ply, the concentration in the third hole 
starts increasing as the gaps around the outer filaments at the 
ply surfaces in the second space are progressively plugged. 
During this time, concentrations in the inner side of the sample 
jrop a little due to the decreasing diffusion flux through gaps 
around filaments in the third ply. The point D in Figure 3 is 
[he time that gaps around the outer filaments at the ply surfaces 
j n the second space are plugged completely. At this time, the 
jnner-side concentrations increase again. The concentration 
curves in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th spaces also behave in the 
same way. Similarly, the points E, F, G and H are the times 
that gaps around the outer filaments at both ply surfaces in 
the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th spaces are plugged completely. After 
points C, D, E, F, G and H, the concentrations in the holes 
decrease as the distances between plies become smaller due to 
deposition. Finally, all the inside concentrations, except the 
concentration in the first hole, become zero when the first 
space is plugged (point B in Figure 3). 

Figure 4 shows the concentration profiles of TiCl 4 and DDS 
along the z axis at one- and two-hour reaction times for case 
1. Since it is assumed that there is no concentration gradient 
in the very small distance in the z direction in the space between 
plies, the concentration profile shows a steplike curve. The 
distance between plies is one tenth the thickness of a ply . Hence, 
the flat portions of the curve are very narrow. Distribution 
curves of DDS are flatter than those for TiCl 4 because of the 
larger diffusion coefficient (2.7 times) for DDS, as shown in 
Table 1. The significant gradients in Figure 4 show that, for 
the geometry chosen, diffusion within the sample affects the 
reactant concentrations. 

For case II (deposition with changing feed concentrations 
as given in Table 1), the concentration of TiCl 4 in each space 
is shown in Figure 5. Points A, B, C, D, E, and F have the 
same meaning as in Figure 3. Point H in Figure 3 does not 
exist in Figure 5. This means that until the first space is plugged, 
the gaps around the outer filaments of the 7th ply are not 
plugged. Hence, deposition in the gaps around filaments in 
the 7th ply is continued until the first space is plugged. Here, 
points I (5 h) and II (10 h) are the times when concentrations 
to the sample are changed. 

For case III, deposition with a sequential feed of reactants, 
the results are similar to those for case II (Figure 5) except 
that for the time intervals when only BC1 3 , not TiCl 4) is supplied 
to the sample. The concentrations increase after the drop at 
low times because, as before, the gaps around the outer fila^ 
ments become plugged. Case III represents severe changes in 
feed composition and, therefore, could be considered as an 
extreme illustration of the more general case II. 



Deposit properties 

Figures 6 and 7 give the amount of deposition of TiB 2 and 
SiC in the gaps around the filaments in each ply as a function 
of time. Figures 8 and 9 show the amount of deposition in the 
middle of each space between plies. Letters A to H correspond 
to the same times, as described for Figure 3. Thus, A is the 
time when the gaps around the outer filaments of the sample 
are plugged, and C is the time when the outer filaments in the 
first space between the plies are plugged. When the outer fil-

tration and deposition rate constant. As shown in Table 1, the 
feed concentration of DDS is 2.4 times that of TiCl 4 . The rate 
constant for SiC deposition, however, is less than one third 
that of TiB 2 so that the final amount of deposition of SiC in 
the gaps around the filaments in the first ply (Figure 7) is only 
0.57 times that of TiBj (Figure 6). Going into the sample, the 
final amount of deposition of SiC in the gaps around filaments 
in each ply increases and that of TiB 2 decreases. The difference 
is mainly because the diffusion coefficient of DDS is 2.7 times 
that of TiCl 4 . As a result, the concentration profiles of DDS 
along the z axis in the sample become higher (3 times in the 
middle of the sample) than those of TiCl 4 , as shown in Figure 
4. After the outer gaps in the first ply are plugged, the con- 
centration profile of DDS becomes much higher (4 times in 
the middle of the sample) than that of TiCU at the inner side 
of the sample. Therefore, even though the deposition rate of 
SiC is low, the higher concentration of DDS in the gaps in the 
inner plies makes the final amounts of deposition there more 
than those in the outer plies, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, 
the lower concentrations of TiCl 4 in the gaps in the inner plies 
result in smaller amounts of deposition of Til^, as shown in 
Figure 6. Hence, going into the sample (increasing ply number), 
the deposition of SiC in the gaps around the filaments increase! 
while the opposite occurs in TiB 2 . The ratio of SiC to TiB, 
deposit in the gaps around filaments in each ply changes from 
0.57 for the first ply to 2.32 for the 7th ply. Deposition amounts 
in the gaps and in the spaces between plies are summarized in 
Table 2. 

Figures 8 and 9 show the amount of deposition in the middk 
of each space between plies. The spaces between the first ply 
become plugged after a longer time, as noted in Figures 8 and 
9. This time is nearly the same for all plies because no dep- 
osition in subsequent plies can occur after the first space (be- 
tween plies one and two) becomes plugged. The low values » 
the amount deposited for the interior plies, as shown in Figurs 
8 and 9, mean that there will always be some residual porosfr 
in the center section of the sample. This result has serio*

The composition of the deposit is indicated in Figure 10 for

TiB 2 than SiC for case II, since the feed gas contains more 
TiCl 4 during the 0-5 h time period when most of the deposit 
is produced (Figure 6). Case II shows the results for a graded 
deposit, and comparison with case I displays the flexibility in 
deposit composition that can be achieved by varying the gas 
mixture fed to the sample. Such predictions are useful for 
designing operating procedures for optimum properties of the 
resultant composites. 

Porosity 

Figure 11 shows the overall porosity (sum of void volume 
in the gaps, spaces, and holes divided by total volume of the 
sample) for the three cases. Porosities are nearly the same for 
simultaneous (case I) feed gas of 2.4">/o DDS and 1 .0% TiCl 4 
and sequential feeds (Case III) of 2.4% DDS followed by 1 .0°7o 
TiCl 4 . However, graded composites (case II) where the feed 
gas initially contains more TiCl 4 have larger porosities up to 
about 40-h reaction time. This is because the density of TiB 2 
is greater than that of SiC. While only average porosities are 
given in Figure 11, an advantage of our discrete model is that 
porosities in all parts of the sample, in the gaps around fila- 
ments, spaces between plies, and holes through the plies, are 
available at any reaction time. The prior article (Chung et al., 
1992) gives porosities for the deposition of only SiC for the 
same sample dimensions and deposition conditions, except that 
the feed contained 3.15% DDS rather than 2.4°7o. The porosity 
curve for SiC alone is somewhat lower than that for case I in 
Figure 11 and ends with an asymptotic value of about 0.17.

The higher porosity for simultaneous deposition of both SiC 
and TiB 2 is due to the more rapid plugging of the outer gaps 
around the filaments, thus enclosing more void spaces through 
the sample. Similar results where the holes in successive plies 
are aligned (Chung et al., 1991) show even lower porosities, 
because plugging spaces between outer plies do not hinder 
access to interior plies. Denser composites are possible if the 
fabric is woven to allow unconstrained access to interior plies. 



Effects of input parameters (sensitivity analysis) 

For the effects of temperature, pressure and reactant gas 
composition, results were obtained for two substrates, A and 
B, of different geometry as described in Table 3. This table 
also lists molecular diffusivities, kinetic constants, and solid 
densities (of TiB 2 and SiC) used in these sensitivity calculations, 
which were for simultaneous feed compositions (case I) of the 
reactants. 

Figure 12 shows cross sections for infiltrated 13-ply sub- 
strates of fabrics A and B. The two substrates exhibit quite 
different geometries. In fabric B, the filaments in the tows 
appear crenelated and more closely and regularly packed. More 
detailed examination shows that the diameter of the filaments, 
the size of the holes, the width of the tows, the thickness of 
the plies, the number of filaments in a tow, and the space 
between adjoining tows (ply spacing) are smaller than those 
in fabric A. These differences in substrate configuration may 
prove important and influence the progress of mass transfer, 
chemical reaction, and deposition, especially with respect to 
being able to infiltrate the substrate with a uniform and/or 
controlled porosity and composition. 

Figure 13a displays the overall porosity predicted as a func- 
tion of time. Fabric B is more fully infiltrated and has a final 
porosity about 5% lower than fabric A at 925°C and 10 torr. 
Decreasing the tow width, ply thickness, and height of the 13- 
ply sample provides better access to the interior plies resulting 
in more complete infiltration (fabric B). In Figure 13b, the 
porosity is shown as a function of the number of plies in a 
layup for fabric B. Porosity increases as the number of plies 
increases due to the increase in thickness and diffusion path. 

The effect of temperature on final porosity is shown in Table 
4 for 925 °C and 1 ,000"C and three reactant gas compositions. 
The significant increase in final porosity with temperature is 
due to the increase in deposition rates with respect to diffusion 
rates. This causes more rapid plugging between the outer plies 
and results in less infiltration into the inner plies. 

The plots in Figure 14 show the amount of SiC deposited 
in the spaces between plies and within the plies for fabric A. 
The first space between plies plugs at about 32 h. This is a

fabric B being smaller, each outer ply also has fewer filaments 
(1,000 vs. 3,000) to act as a "sink" for deposition. 

In Figure 14, it is apparent that some inner spaces between 
plies in fabric A have no deposit at all (there can be little 
bonding between these plies). For fabric B (Figure 15), there 
is some deposit and potential bonding between all of the plies. 
This result has obvious and major consequences on the me-

Plies which have poor bonding are prone to delaminate. Area 
in which a protective coating does not exist are subject t< 
oxidation. 

Table 5 shows final porosity as a function of pressure fo 
925 *C. Reducing the pressure has a marked effect on diffusion 
allowing material to diffuse faster and deposit in depth befon 
the first space and tow are plugged and create a barrier. There 
fore, decreasing the pressure decreases the final porosity. Th ( 
data in the table also suggest that, if all factors are the same 
little is gained by decreasing the pressure from 1.32 x 10 3 tc 
1.32 x 10 2 Pa (10 to 1 torr). The efficiency of the process de 
creases with respect to time at the lower pressure. The time 
necessary to reach almost equivalent final porosities for a pres 
sure of 1 torr is a factor of 10 greater than at 10 torr. This h 
due to the decrease in the deposition rate which accompanies 
the decrease in pressure. Decreasing the pressure increases the 
diffusion rate but decreases the reaction rate since the concen- 
tration of reactants is proportional to pressure. 

Conclusions 

The structured geometry model (Chung et al., 1992) pre- 
dicting chemical vapor infiltration in various sections of plies 
of woven tows of carbon carbon filaments has been applied 
to combined deposition of two components. Results for a 
typical fabric are given for deposits of SiC plus TiB 2 when the 
concentration of the gaseous precursors changes with time 
(graded deposits) and when dispersed deposits are produced 
by simultaneous feed gases of constant composition or se- 
quential feeds yielding SiC and then TiB 2 . The model predicts 
gas-phase concentrations, deposit amount and porosities in the 
three sections of the samples (gaps, spaces, and holes), all as 
a function of time. For the same conditions, densification 
(overall porosity) is about the same for all three cases at long 
reaction times. During the earlier stage of deposition, however, 
lower densification is predicted for the simultaneous feed of 
both precursors. These results are for a staggered arrangement 
of the holes between successive plies of the sample. This leads 
to lower final densification than when the holes are aligned, 
due to plugging of the spaces between plies. 

The model was also applied for two fabrics of different 
geometry. Due to plugging of voids around the filaments and 
in the spaces between plies, initial geometry (such as number 
of filaments per tow, diameter of filament, and space between 
plies) can greatly affect not only overall porosity but porosity 
distribution. For one fabric of typical geometry, it is shown 
that inner plies can be devoid of deposition while spaces be- 
tween outer plies are completely plugged. This condition can

have adverse consequences on the mechanical properties and 
oxidation resistance of the composite. 

Results of sensitivity analysis show that the time required 
to obtain the same final porosity increases sharply with de- 
crease in pressure even though diffusivities increase. The effect 
of increasing the temperature is to increase final porosity.
