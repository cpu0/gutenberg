Abstract 

Dynamic characterization of a thin film inflatable 
elliptical structure is described in detail. A two-step finite 
element modeling approach in MSC/NASTRAN is 
utilized, consisting of (1) a nonlinear static pressurization 
procedure used to obtain the updated stiffness matrix, and 
(2) a modal "restart" eigen solution that uses the modified 
stiffness matrix. 

Unique problems encountered in modeling of this large 
4x6-meter lightweight inflatable art identified, including 
considerable difficulty in obtaining convergence in the 
nonlinear finite element pressurization solution. It was 
found that the extremely thin poiyimide film material 
(.001 in or 1 mil) presents tremendous problems in 
obtaining a converged solution when internal pressure 
loading is applied. Approaches utilized to overcome these 
difficulties are described. 

Comparison of finite element predictions for frequency 
and mode shapes of the inflated structure with closed-form 
solutions for a flat pre-tensionec membrane indicate 
reasonable agreement.

Introduction and Background 

Inflatable structures have been the subject of renewed 
interest in recent years for space applications such as 
communications antennas, solar thermal propulsion, and 
space solar power (Figs. 1-2). A major advantage of 
using inflatable structures in space is their extremely light 
weight. An obvious second advantage is on-orbit 
deployability and subsequent space savings in the launch 
configuration. A recent technology demonstrator flight 
for inflatable structures was the Inflatable Antenna 
Experiment (IAE) that was deployed on orbit from the 
Shuttle Orbiter. Although difficulty was encountered in 
the inflation/deployment phase, the flight was successful 
overall and provided valuable experience in the use of such 
structures (Ref. 1). 

The Solar Orbital Transfer Vehicle (SOTV), discussed 
in Ref. 2, and Solar Thermal Upper Stage (STUS), 
described in Refs. 3-5, are possible technology 
demonstrator flights for solar thermal propulsion. The 
basic concept behind solar thermal propulsion is to utilize 
sunlight or solar energy as a means of heating a working 
fluid (propellant) to provide thrust at increased specific 
impulse. As described in Ref. 6, thrust is produced by 
expanding the heated propellant through a nozzle. No 
combustion occurs, and the thrust level is low. For this 
reason, solar thermal propulsive systems are mainly 
applicable for orbital transfer vehicles. The engine system 
envisioned for the STUS is designed to utilize hydrogen 
propellant to produce a thrust level of about 2 Ibf. Two 
inflatable parabolic collectors could be used that would be 
rotated and gimbaled for focusing sunlight into an 
absorber cavity (Fig. 1, from Ref. 5). The collectors 
would be inflated after separation of the upper stage from 
the launch vehicle. 

Many investigators have considered the use of 
inflatable structures for space applications. Perhaps the 
earliest was Frei Otto (Ref. 7), who in 1962 published 
ideas for inflated tubular frames for use in structures such 
as orbiting platforms. A more recent proposed application 
involves the use of inflatable beam segments to replace

American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 



solid segments of the Space Shuttle remote manipulator 
system and thus reduce storage space and inertia of the arm 
(Ref. 8). 

Several papers on static structural analysis of inflated 
cylinders have been written, describing different techniques 
such as linear shell theory, and nonlinear and variational 
methods (Refs. 9-17), but very little work had been done 
in dynamics of inflatable structures until recent years. In 
1988 Leonard (Ref. 18) indicated that elastic beam bending 
modes could be utilized in approximating lower-order 
frequencies of inflatable beams. Main, et al. wrote a very 
significant 1995 paper describing results of modal tests of 
inflated cantilever beams and the determination of effective 
material properties (Ref. 19). Changes in material 
properties for different pressures were also discussed, and 
the beam model was used in a more complex structure. 
The paper demonstrated that conventional finite element 
analysis packages could be very useful in the analysis of 
complex inflatable structures. Reference 20 describes an 
investigation of the dynamics of polyimide thin-film 
inflated cylinders, and Refs. 21-29 discuss recent dynamic 
tests/analyses and potential applications of inflatable solar 
concentrators. 



Description of Inflatable 

Concentrator Investigated in the 

Current Study 

In Fig. 3, a prototype elliptical, off-axis paraboloid 
4x6-meter inflatable concentrator manufactured by SRS 
Technologies, Inc. is shown that consists of a pressurized 
lenticular supported by an aluminum fixture. The 
aluminum fixture will be supported by four I-beam stands 
for testing in a horizontal configuration. The inflatable is 
attached to the fixture by 204 silicon catenaries. The 
lenticular has a 226-in. major axis and a 164.08-in minor 
axis. This collector can function as a space-based antenna 
for communications, surveillance, and radiometry, or as a 
solar concentrator assembly for solar thermal propulsion 
systems. The inflatable lenticular element is constructed 
of NASA Langley Research Center's CP-1 which is .001 
in (1 mil) thick. Silicon-backed Kapton is the adhesive 
used for joints in the inflatable structures. A reflective 
coating on the inner lenticular CP-1 film provides the 
means of collecting radio waves or solar energy. It is 
noted that the particular application for the 
antenna/concentrator depends on the surface accuracy of the 
reflective lenticular surface. Use as an optical system 
would require greater surface accuracy than a solar 
concentrator for propulsion systems, for example. 

In the case of solar thermal propulsion applications 
(Fig. 1), the collector assembly would focus sunlight into 
an absorber or secondary concentrator near the fixed ends 
of the struts. Solar energy stored in the absorber could be 
utilized to heat a propellant and generate thrust as 
described previously. 

Inflatable structures in general are extremely 
lightweight and the collector described in this paper is no 
exception. The thin-film inflatable part of the 
concentrator weighs approximately 3 lb. 



Modeling Approach and Results 

The finite element modeling technique involved two 
main steps: 1. Nonlinear static analysis, in which the 
internal pressure loading was applied to the lenticular 
element and a pretension applied to the catenaries, and 2. 
modal analysis utilizing the results of step 1. Such a 
procedure is needed due to the impossibility of active 
forces in an eigensolution. In step 1, the stiffness matrix 
of the model is updated to capture the tensioning of the 
thin film material caused by internal pressure. This two- 
step modeling and analysis methodology is described in 
detail in Ref. 29, where results are given for inflatable 
cylindrical beams. 

The lenticular film was modeled using NASTRAN 
quadrilateral plate elements, each of which were .001 in. 
(1-mil) thick. Modulus, density, and Poisson's ratio as 
used were provided by the film manufacturers. The CP-1 

film has E=300 ksi, v=0.34, and p=0.0518 lbm/in \ An 
internal pressure of 0.03 in. H 2 (.00108 psig) was 
applied to the lenticular clement. 

Modeling of the catenaries was done using silicon rod 
elements under a temperature load. The suggested 
temperature-loading pretension method was verified by 
comparing stress results to a rod with an applied force. 

The Aluminum-5052 test fixture was also modeled 
using quadrilateral plate elements. The section of the 
aluminum plate with 3600 holes was modeled by altering 
the thickness accordingly to account for the adjusted 
density. 

The steel I-beam stands were modeled using beam 
elements and multipoint constraints. A modal test was 
performed on a stand that was supported on three feet. 
The stands in the finite element model were cantileavered 
but were created with modes and mode shapes equivalent 
to that of the tested stand. Multipoint constraints were 
used to define a plate-sectioned rigid body in the place 
where the stand would be secured to the aluminum fixture. 
Fig. 4. shows the integrated finite element model. 

Several parameter studies were performed to help 
diagnose problems and to aid in understanding of the 
solutions. Mode shapes and frequencies were compared 
while varying thickness, geometry, and material. Studies 
were also made on the effect of an induced strain or applied 
pressure. Drastic effects on mode shapes and frequencies 
would appear by changing only the geometry from 
elliptical-shaped to paraboloid-shaped. The introduction of 
curvature into the problem would not only affect system 
dynamics but also drastically increase computation time of 
the nonlinear static solution. It is interesting to point out 
that the strain of the paraboloid geometry (while averaging 
about 0.03%) did have a varying value across the 
membrane due to the applied pressure. The flat elliptical 
model had an induced uniform strain of 0.03%. But when 
a pressure was applied to the flat elliptical membrane 
giving a much greater and varying strain, the mode shapes 
were identical indicating that the mode shapes seem to be 
a function of geometry. The frequencies were not the 
same in this case. Ref. 30 shows that sag has played an 



American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 



interesting role in cables and cable trusses as shown. 
Fundamental natural frequencies of cables with a small 
amount of sag can be as much as 300% more than those 
of a straight cable. Similar behavior may occur in 
membranes. 

The greatest difficulty encountered in modeling and 
analysis was obtaining convergence of the nonlinear static 
pressurization solution in MSC/NASTRAN. This 
difficulty is due to the extremely thin polyimide material 
of which the inflatable components are constructed (1 mil 
or 1/1000 of one inch). The ratios of film thickness to 
overall geometric dimensions such as lenticular axes 
appear to be the critical parameters in the nonlinear 
pressurization analysis. For example, it was found that 
increasing the film thickness to 10 mils or 1/100 in. 
resulted in solutions that converged easily. The reason for 
this phenomenon appears to be that extremely thin films 
tend to have large displacements and large stiffness 
changes when pressure loading is applied. Obviously, 
increased thickness reduces the magnitude of these 
changes. Another issue in model convergence was fine- 
tuning the NASTRAN parameter 'kdiag'. A value of 
'kdiag' helps convergence by initially adding a small value 
to the stiffness matrix diagonal terms and then is later 
removed. With this assistance, there was convergence of 
iterations early on that normally would have trouble 
converging. The value of 'kdiag' was continually 
decreased until successive results would have similar 
solutions indicating no necessary further change in the 
parameter. 

After all the difficulties encounteed in this modeling 
and analysis effort, it was satisfying to obtain reasonable 
results. The first natural frequency of the integrated model 
was 7.87 Hz, and the mode shape was characterized by an 
up-and-down bobbing of the inflatable through the ring 
fixture as shown in Fig. 5. With the exception of the 4 th 
mode, the first seven modes exhibit rigid-body type modes 
due to the 204 catenaries that connect the inflatable to the 
fixture. Another example of these rigid-body type modes 
is shown in Fig. 6. These types of modes have 
frequencies not equal to zero but display motion in the 
directions of rigid body modes. A breathing mode of the 
entire inflatable occurs at 9.82 Hz, which is the 4 th mode. 
The next system mode excluding the igid-body type mode 
(mode 8) occurs at 13.44 Hz characterized as a 2 nd -order 
breathing mode with node line along major axis of the 
inflatable. Table 1 shows some modes of the entire 
system. Some interesting curvature effects on the mode 
shape are apparent in mode 9 (1 3.98 Hz), Fig. 7. Coupled 
support structure and inflatable structure modes were seen 
for the first time at 26.15 Hz (mode W) shown in Fig. 8. 



Comparison of Finite Element Results to 
Closed-Form Solutions 



and then modeled in NASTRAN using this technique. 
Results of another finite element analysis for this test 
were replicated. A strain of 0.2% due to dry shrinkage and 
other effects was found by comparing the test data with 
the model results. 

A finite element model of the 4x6-meter inflatable 
membrane was modified (converted to a flat 2-D ellipse) 
and re-analyzed in MSC/NASTRAN. In this analysis, the 
support stand and ring fixture were not included in the 
model to allow a focus on the critical aspects of the 
modeling process and to allow comparison to closed form 
solutions. The pressure load was replaced by a uniform 
temperature-induced strain. The catenaries were also 
removed and the perimeter of the ellipse was fixed in all 
directions. Hamidzadeh's closed-form solution had the 
following conditions: flat elliptical membrane, zero 
displacement on the boundary, uniform strain, and CP-1 
properties. A nonlinear static analysis followed by a 
modal 'restart* was performed for this model as well. 

The results are summarized in Table 2. The closed 
form solution compared well with the NASTRAN 
solution. The mode shapes were identical and the 
frequencies were on target. Slight differences in the 
frequencies can be attributed to approximate values for the 
Mathieu functions in the closed form solutions and slight 
geometric discrepancies in the NASTRAN model. A 
polynomial expansion for the Mathieu functions and 
modified Mathieu functions were used in calculating 
natural frequencies. The geometric dimensions in the 
NASTRAN model were slightly different then the design 
dimensions because the geometry followed that of the 
fabricated prototype. 



Summary 

Modeling of a large 4x6-m thin-film inflatable 
concentrator structure has been accomplished. 
Comparisons with modal tests will be made at a later 
lime. This work is significant because of (1) general 
difficulty in accurately representing the nonlinear material 
and geometric characteristics of these structures, (2) the 
large size of this thin-film structure, and most 
importantly, (3) the accomplishment of a modeling 
methodology that realistically represents the internal 
pressure loading and the stiffness properties of the thin 
films in a modal solution. 

It was shown that many workarounds were required to 
obtain convergence of the nonlinear static pressurization 
procedure in MSC/NASTRAN. In this regard, 

MSC/NASTRAN was found to have limitations in its 
nonlinear analysis capability, particularly for large thin- 
film structures of the type investigated in this paper. The 
use of ABAQUS or other finite element packages should 
also be considered for inflatable structures. 



The suggested method of applying a uniform strain to 
the membrane or a pretension to the catenaries is by using 
a change in temperature. This method was verified by 
comparing a catenary in strain to a catenary with an 
applied force. A 17.5-inch diameter membrane was tested
