x-archive-meta-description: Dynamic characterization of a thin film inflatable elliptical structure is described in detail. A two-step finite element modeling approach in MSC/NASTRAN is utilized, consisting of (1) a nonlinear static pressurization procedure used to obtain the updated stiffness matrix, and (2) a modal ''restart'' eigen solution that uses the modified stiffness matrix. Unique problems encountered in modeling of this large Hexameter lightweight inflatable arc identified, including considerable difficulty in obtaining convergence in the nonlinear finite element pressurization solution. It was found that the extremely thin polyimide film material (.001 in or 1 mil) presents tremendous problems in obtaining a converged solution when internal pressure loading is applied. Approaches utilized to overcome these difficulties are described. Comparison of finite element predictions for frequency and mode shapes of the inflated structure with closed-form solutions for a flat pre-tensioned membrane indicate reasonable agreement.
