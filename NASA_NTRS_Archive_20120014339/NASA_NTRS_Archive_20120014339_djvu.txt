Abstract: The current gamma-ray/neutron instrumentation development effort at NASA Goddard 
Space Flight Center aims to extend the use of active pulsed neutron interrogation techniques to probe 
the subsurface geochemistry of planetary bodies in situ. All previous NASA planetary science missions, 
that used neutron and/or gamma-ray spectroscopy instruments, have relied on a constant neutron 
source produced from galactic cosmic rays. One of the distinguishing features of this effort is the 
inclusion of a high intensity 14.1 MeV pulsed neutron generator synchronized with a custom data 
acquisition system to time each event relative to the pulse. With usually only one opportunity to 
collect data, it is difficult to set a priori time-gating windows to obtain the best possible results. 
Acquiring time-tagged, event-by-event data from nuclear induced reactions provides raw data sets 
containing channel/energy, and event time for each gamma ray or neutron detected. The resulting 
data set can be plotted as a function of time or energy using optimized analysis windows after the data 
are acquired. Time windows can now be chosen to produce energy spectra that yield the most 
statistically significant and accurate elemental composition results that can be derived from the 
complete data set. The advantages of post-processing gamma-ray time-tagged event-by-event data in 
experimental tests using our prototype instrument will be demonstrated.

48 1 . Introduction 

49 The objective of the current gamma-ray/neutron instrumentation development 

50 at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) 1 is to use active pulsed neutron 

51 interrogation techniques to determine in situ the subsurface bulk elemental 

52 concentrations of planetary bodies. To date, all the planetary science missions 

53 that have included both neutron and gamma-ray instruments have made remote 

54 sensing measurements from orbit or during close fly-by encounters with a 

55 planetary body (e.g. Lunar Prospector [1], Mars Odyssey [2,3], Dawn [4], 

56 MESSENGER [5], NEAR [6], and LRO [7,8]). The excitation sources for these 

57 remote sensing measurements have necessarily been limited to the high energy

58 (fast) neutrons that are produced when Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) interact 

59 with planetary materials. Although GCR-generated fast neutron rates change 

60 with the 1 1-year solar cycle, they occur at a constant rate for these 

61 measurements time. Measured gamma-ray spectra contain all of the gamma ray 

62 lines from each of the gamma ray-producing interactions of neutrons with the 

63 planetary material. Gamma-ray spectra thus include peaks resulting from 

64 inelastic scattering, thermal neutron capture, delayed activation and natural 

65 radioactivity. However, the large number of peaks and the high spectral 

66 background result in peak interferences, misidentifications and reduced precision 

67 in the reported gamma-ray results. These difficulties are avoided for in situ 

68 measurements of a landed instrument package that includes a Pulsed Neutron 

69 Generator (PNG) as the excitation source. A PNG can produce fast neutrons at 

70 -100 times greater rate than GCR interactions resulting in significantly reduced 

71 measurement times for equivalent sensitivity. A PNG can also produce 14.1 

72 MeV neutrons in relatively short bursts with an adjustable neutron pulse period 

73 and width. With the production of the high-energy neutrons restricted to the 

74 duration of the burst, the gamma rays that result from the inelastic scattering of 

75 these fast neutrons will also occur only during the time of the burst. Between 

76 each burst, the planetary material moderates the fast neutrons so that the 

77 gamma rays are largely produced by thermal neutron capture. After most of the 

78 thermal neutrons have been absorbed, the gamma rays resulting from delayed 

79 activation and natural radioactivity become visible. Separating the gamma rays 

80 by their detection time relative to a PNG pulse results in lower background and a 



81 substantial reduction in peak interferences, while capturing essentially all of the 

82 gamma rays due to a particular type of reaction. Separating gamma ray spectra 

83 by physical process minimizes the systematic effects from interfering peaks and 

84 provides improved precision and accuracy in the peak analysis that directly 

85 results in more precise elemental concentration measurements. We have 

86 previously shown [9] that significant improvements in precision can be obtained 

87 using properly chosen time windows for time-gated coincidence data acquisition 

88 methods. Here we report the increased benefits of using time tagged event-by- 

89 event data. 

90 On Earth, it is possible to adjust the PNG pulse period and width as well as the 

91 coincident data acquisition window timing parameters for an optimum analysis of 

92 a sample because one usually has a general idea of the sample’s bulk 

93 composition and its properties with regard to neutron and gamma ray transport. 

94 Even without this knowledge, multiple measurements using adjusted parameters 

95 are usually possible. So it is often simple and sufficient to use coincidence data 

96 acquisition methods with a limited number of fixed time gates for these ground- 

97 based experiments on Earth. However, one rarely has the luxury of repeating 

98 measurements on another planet. When making in situ measurements on a 

99 planetary body, there is often a great ignorance of its composition especially with 

100 regard to elements that affect the neutron and gamma ray time dependence. For 

101 planetary science applications it would be very difficult to make multiple 

102 measurements at a variety of different timing conditions with sufficient statistics 

103 to determine the optimum timing parameters. The optimal timing parameters 



104 largely depend on neutron transport properties that are governed by effects that 

105 vary by location such as elemental composition, hydrogen content, density and 

106 subsurface layering geometries. By the time one has determined what the 

107 proper time gating should be, the mission may be over, or, in the case of a rover 

108 mission, the rover may have already left the region where the earlier data were 

109 obtained. 

110 This type of problem has been addressed in early NASA Apollo gamma ray 

111 experiments [10] as well as in other scientific fields such as radioanalytical 

112 chemistry applications [1 1] by accumulating data on an event-by-event basis 

113 where the energy and measurement time is recorded for every event detected 

114 during the data acquisition time. When data are accumulated in an event-by- 

115 event mode that includes event times, one can analyze the data after the 

116 measurement has been made (post-processing) to determine the optimum time 

117 windows for spectral data analysis. Although event-by-event data acquisition 

118 leads to large raw data files, it makes it possible to perform the optimal spectral 

119 analysis without requiring repeated measurements. 

120 1. 1 The Probing In situ with Neutrons and Gamma rays (PING) Instrument 

121 Our group at NASA/GSFC is currently developing the Probing In situ with 

122 Neutrons and Gamma rays (PING) instrument for planetary in situ bulk elemental 

123 composition measurements [9] by leveraging both well-established oil well and 

124 scientific logging techniques [12] and remote sensing planetary gamma-ray 

125 spectroscopy techniques. PING employs a 14.1 MeV pulsed neutron generator 

126 to excite materials at and below a planetary surface and utilizes the penetrating 



127 nature of these fast neutrons and gamma rays to probe the subsurface soil 

128 composition over a 1 m 2 area and down to depths of 10-100 cm. PING’s gamma- 

129 ray spectrometer and neutron detectors measure the resulting gamma rays and 

130 neutrons that emerge from the planetary surface. To illustrate an example 

131 application, PING is shown in Figure 1 attached to the underside of a planetary 

132 rover. 

133 < Insert Figure 1> 

134 A gamma-ray spectrometer measures the resulting inelastic scattering, capture, 

135 and delayed activation gamma rays emitted by the excited elements as well as 

136 gamma rays emitted from natural radioactive decay; neutron detectors measure 

137 the number of the epithermal and thermal neutrons that reach the surface as a 

138 function of time relative to the initiation of each high-energy neutron pulse. PING 

139 gamma-ray and neutron data are acquired using custom software to control 

140 digital signal analyzer electronics. These data, coupled with MCNPX [13] 

141 computer simulations, let us quantitatively determine the bulk elemental 

142 composition of the subsurface material for any solid body in the Solar System, 

143 even bodies with a dense atmosphere. PING can measure a wide range of 

144 elements (e.g. C, H, O, P, S, Si, Na, Ca, Ti, Fe, Al, Cl, Mg, Mn, K, Th, and U) 

145 depending on their abundance in the planetary material. 

146 1.2 Outdoor Neutron-Gamma Ray Instrument Test Site 

147 We are testing the capabilities of our PING instrument prototypes at a unique 

148 outdoor gamma ray and neutron instrumentation testing facility located at 

149 Goddard’s Geophysical and Astronomical Observatory (GGAO) near Goddard’s 



150 main campus. A schematic view of the test site is shown in Figure 2. This test 

151 facility allows us to operate PING on top of either of two large, well-characterized 

152 granite and basalt monuments, each 1 .8 m x 1 .8 m x 0.9 m in size. Activation 

153 Laboratories Ltd. in Ancaster, Ontario, Canada, has independently measured the 

154 full elemental compositions of these Concord Gray Granite and Columbia River 

155 Basalt materials to the ppm level. PING is remotely operated from a building 

156 more than 75 m from the monuments due to the radiation hazard from the PNG’s 

157 14 MeV neutrons. Underground power and communications lines connect the 

158 operations building to the test monuments. Details of the specific PING 

159 measurements are given in Section 3.1 and further information about the test 

160 facility can be found in [14,15], 

161 < Insert Figure 2> 

162 1.3 Using TLIST Data to Improve PING Elemental Composition Measurements 

163 A Canberra Lynx Digital Signal Analyzer (DSA) is used to acquire data from 

164 each gamma ray and neutron detector used for a PING measurement. While the 

165 Lynx DSA hardware [16], features multiple data acquisition modes, including 

166 coincidence-gated Pulse Height Analysis (PHA) and event-by-event Time- 

167 stamped LIST (TLIST) mode, operation of the Lynx DSAs in TLIST mode 

168 required the development of custom software. In this paper, we describe both the 

169 acquisition of TLIST data using our custom MultiScan software [17] and the post- 

170 processing of our data that allows us to: 

171 1 ) Use optimized timing windows to separate the data into distinct gamma- 

172 ray spectra resulting from either a) inelastic scattering, during the neutron 



173 


pulse, b) thermal neutron capture, between neutron pulses, or c) delayed 

174 activation and natural activity events visible just before the next fast neutron 

175 pulse. This separation allows us to more accurately identify gamma ray lines 

176 and more precisely measure gamma ray net peak areas; 

177 2) Isolate a particular energy line from a gamma ray spectrum and observe 

178 its intensity time profile with respect to the PNG pulse to more accurately 

179 identify and measure the gamma-ray line and its net peak area; and 

180 3) Extract gamma ray data to optimize the timing windows needed to look 

181 for specific elements in different environments and to obtain the optimum 

182 precision for the analyzed peak intensities. 

183 

184 2. The TLIST Data Acquisition Technique 

185 Analyzing individual gamma-ray peaks in a traditional PHA energy spectrum 

186 can be challenging due to both interfering lines and the background continuum 

187 resulting from multiple processes. We reduce these effects and obtain higher 

188 gamma-ray line sensitivity with increased signal-to-noise by recording gamma- 

189 ray time and energy in an event-by-event mode. We use our custom MultiScan 

190 software and the Canberra Lynx DSA in TLIST mode to record the energy and 

191 time (temporal resolution 0.1 ps) of each event detected during a PNG pulse 

192 cycle. As discussed in Section 1 , we obtain a master data set that is not limited 

193 to predetermined coincidence timing gates set for specific nuclear processes. 

194 This master data set can be sliced in many ways without loss of information or 

195 requiring additional measurements with different data acquisition window settings. 



196 Figures 3a and b illustrate the results of our post-processing of TLIST gamma- 

197 ray data for various timing windows. 

198 < Insert Figures 3a and 3b> 

199 Figure 3a is an illustration of the PNG fast neutron pulse train and the intra- 

200 pulse location of the different timing windows needed to separate the gamma 

201 rays that result from the inelastic scattering, thermal neutron capture, delayed 

202 activation and natural radioactivity processes. Figure 3b is an illustration of the 

203 differences in the resulting energy and intensity of the gamma ray lines and 

204 background for each of these separated spectra. 

205 2.1 Custom Multi Scan Data Acquisition Software 

206 Lynx DSA data acquisition can be performed using either the Lynx web-based 

207 interface or the Genie 2000 software package [16] both available from Canberra 

208 Industries. Although the Lynx DSA hardware offers the required TLIST mode, 

209 neither of these software options provides the flexibility and all of the capabilities 

210 we need for our specific instrument application. The MultiScan software, 

211 designed specifically for our project, allows us to 1 ) acquire data in TLIST mode 

212 while synchronized to the PNG pulse, 2) save data in ASCII format, 3) analyze 

213 TLIST data for an unlimited number of time windows, and 4) perform multiple 

214 consecutive data acquisitions while maintaining the Lynx graphical analysis and 

215 configuration features. Example images of the MultiScan software interface are 

216 shown in Figure 4. 

217 < Insert Figure 4> 



218 The MultiScan software was written in Java, since we needed to make the 

219 code cross-platform and easy to understand so that others can make changes to 

220 the code when necessary. When starting a new data acquisition or scan, the user 

221 can specify which of the multiple Lynx DSAs to perform the scan, the acquisition 

222 mode (PHA or TLIST), the file format to save the data (Canberra CNF file, ASCII 

223 text, or both), how many consecutive scans to perform, and the duration of each 

224 scan (in either live time or true time). Settings can be modified quickly and easily 

225 within the software. The data are both written to a file and presented in a large 

226 display window with multiple data visualization features. The program also 

227 provides basic data analysis tools for both PHA and TLIST scans, and off-line 

228 TLIST data post-processing time-slicing tools, as well as a diagnostic feature for 

229 monitoring the operating parameters within the Lynx DSA [18]. 

230 2.2 TLIST Data Analysis Techniques 

231 We use the MultiScan software with Lynx DSAs to acquire TLIST data for 

232 gamma-ray and neutron detectors with the start of a data acquisition 

233 synchronized with the start of a PNG pulse. Synchronization of the PNG and 

234 DSA clocks insures the accuracy of these event times over multi-hour data 

235 acquisition runs. Our basic post-processing procedure for the individual event-by- 

236 event data files is to take the modulus of the absolute times for the detected 

237 events with respect to the known PNG pulse period to derive the time of each 

238 event relative to the neutron pulse. The next step is to put all of the files for a 

239 given experiment on the same time base. The result is a master data set of 

240 energies and relative event times that can be “sliced” in any number of ways. 



241 Slicing the data in time means establishing the boundary between times where 

242 different nuclear processes dominate. The result is separate gamma-ray spectra 

243 for the specific processes that have the event statistics characteristic of the total 

244 acquisition time. Slicing the data in energy means establishing energy 

245 boundaries around spectral features whose time profile one wishes to study. 

246 After generating this master data set with energy and relative time values, we 

247 can analyze our gamma ray and neutron data to infer the bulk elemental 

248 composition, density, and subsurface layering of planetary bodies. 

249 3. Experiments and Results with TLIST Data 

250 Gamma-ray and neutron spectroscopy is used to infer the bulk elemental 

251 concentrations of the surface and subsurface of planetary bodies. The time 

252 dependence relative to the neutron burst of gamma ray peaks in an energy 

253 calibrated spectrum can be analyzed to determine the neutron-nuclei 

254 interaction(s) associated with a particular gamma ray energy. We performed 

255 PING experiments using a pulsed neutron generator, gamma ray and neutron 

256 detectors on a meter-sized basalt monument. The TLIST data acquired and 

257 analyzed in this section only represents 6.33 hours of data acquisition with a 

258 fixed neutron pulse with a width of 100 ps and a pulse period of 1000 ps. The 

259 results of TLIST data acquisition and post-processing presented will demonstrate 

260 the improved precision and reduced systematic errors that can be achieved as 

261 compared with pre-assigned acquisition windows from a presumed knowledge of 

262 elemental composition. 

263 3.1 Experiment Description 



264 During these experiments, we acquired 6.33-hrs of TLIST data using a Lynx 

265 DSA connected to an n-type Ortec GMX Series HPGe portable coaxial detector 

266 system and a 14 MeV Deuterium - Tritium Thermo Fisher MP320 portable PNG 

267 [19] positioned on top of our Columbia River basalt monument, as shown in 

268 Figure 5. 

269 < Insert Figure 5> 

270 The Lynx DSA reading out the HPGe detector was connected directly to the 

271 PNG to synchronize the start of each data acquisition run with the start of a 

272 neutron pulse. The PNG beam current, high voltage, frequency, and duty factor 

273 were set to 60 pA, 50 kV, 1 kHz, and 10% respectively. At these settings, the 

274 PNG produced a neutron pulse width, pulse period, energy, and rate of 100 ps, 

275 1000 ps, 14 MeV, and 3 x 10 7 n/s respectively. 

276 3.2 Gamma-Ray Peak Separation Using TLIST Data Analysis 

277 Gamma-ray line identification can be difficult for many reasons including: 1 ) 

278 interfering gamma-ray lines resulting from the use of low energy resolution 

279 gamma-ray spectrometers (i.e. Nal gamma ray scintillation detectors); and 2) 

280 multi-element neutron-nuclei interactions that produce gamma rays at the same 

281 energy that are indistinguishable even when using high energy resolution 

282 gamma-ray spectrometers (e.g. HPGe semi-conductor detectors). Unfortunately, 

283 it is difficult to deal with these gamma-ray line identification problems when 

284 analyzing gamma-ray remote sensing data, because remote sensing gamma-ray 

285 spectroscopy is limited by the collection of PHA energy spectra and the use of 

286 the constant neutron source resulting from GCR interactions with the planet. 



287 However, these gamma-ray line identification problems can be easily addressed 

288 with the PING instrument by taking advantage of the pulsed nature of the in situ 

289 neutron source synchronized with the data acquisition system. 

290 Figure 6 shows an example of interfering lines common in gamma-ray PHA 

291 energy spectra collected by low energy resolution detectors. Here we see two 

292 interfering lines in a gamma-ray spectrum taken using the PING instrument with 

293 a LaBr 3 scintillation detector on top of a granite and polyethylene configuration. 

294 <lnsert Figure 6> 

295 The counts in the unresolved peak area are primarily from 28 Si and 56 Fe gamma 

296 rays. The natural solution would be to use a gamma-ray spectrometer with better 

297 energy resolution, but one does not always have that option due to mass, power, 

298 volume and cost constraints associated with planetary space flight missions. One 

299 way to remedy this problem is to separate the gamma-ray energy spectra by 

300 nuclear process using the gamma-ray event times as shown in Figure 7. 

301 <lnsert Figure 7> 

302 Figure 7 is a plot of four different gamma-ray PHA spectra, with the lines from 

303 Table 1 indicated, for a 6.33-hr live time acquisition with the PING instrument 

304 using a HPGe detector on the basalt monument, consisting of: 1 ) a total gamma- 

305 ray spectrum (in black) including all neutron-nuclei gamma-ray processes; 2) an 

306 inelastic gamma-ray spectrum (in red) created by only selecting gamma-ray 

307 events during the PNG pulse for t=20-100 ps; 3) a neutron capture gamma-ray 

308 spectrum (in green) created by only selecting gamma-ray events after the PNG 

309 pulse for t=1 50-650 ps; and 4) a delayed activation and natural activity gamma- 



310 ray spectrum (in purple) created by only selecting gamma ray events for t=650- 

311 999 ps. Separating the gamma-ray acquisition into different time slices allows us 

312 to isolate gamma-ray events for specific interactions from a single element 

313 without accumulating excessive background when the peaks are not actually 

314 present. 

315 <lnsert Table 1> 

316 Even if a better energy resolution detector like HPGe is used, gamma-ray line 

317 identification can still be challenging, due to multi-element neutron-nuclei 

318 interactions that produce gamma rays at the same energy but from different 

319 elements. For example, Table 2 lists a selected set of gamma-ray line energies 

320 and their possible sources from neutron-nuclei interactions with different 

321 elements, demonstrating how multiple elements can contribute to the same line 

322 energy. 

323 <lnsert Table 2> 

324 Problems with interfering lines can be dealt with by examining the time profile 

325 of the individual gamma ray lines. Figure 8a is an example of a 6.33-hr summed 

326 FIPGe gamma ray spectrum taken with PING instrument on top of the basalt 

327 monument. In this spectrum, the Doppler broadened 27 AI(n,n’y) gamma ray line 

328 from neutron inelastic scattering, the ^(n.y) gamma ray line from neutron 

329 capture, and the 24 Na(n,Py) SE from delayed activation are clearly interfering with 

330 one another. One way to distinguish 27 AI(n,n’y) and the ^(n.y) gamma ray lines 

331 is by plotting the net peak area of the unresolved spectral feature in Figure 8a as 

332 a function of time, as shown in Figure 8b, to distinguish which line is present. 



333 Figure 8b shows the time histograms of the net peak areas for the 221 1 keV 

334 27 AI(n,n’y) and the 2223 keV ^(n.y) gamma ray lines. The time histograms are 

335 the gamma-ray count rates per 10 ps time interval and demonstrate that one can 

336 distinguish between and separate interfering lines by nuclear process to improve 

337 both the peak identification and the measurement precision.

339 3.3 Improved Gamma-Ray Measurement Precision 

340 Separating a gamma-ray spectrum by nuclear process improves the overall 

341 gamma-ray line measurement precision. As seen in Table 1 in Section 3.2 many 

342 of the time-gated inelastic scattering and capture lines show improved precision 

343 as compared with the same lines in the summed spectrum. The 3539 and 4934 

344 keV 28 Si(n,y) capture lines show improved precision resulting from time-gated 

345 analysis. The precision of these Si lines in the summed spectrum, representing 

346 results without time slicing, is 8.3% and 16.92%. These same Si lines show 

347 improved precision (7.3% and 9.21%) in the capture-delayed activation spectrum 

348 obtained with optimized time gating from the removal of the gamma-ray 

349 background due to inelastic scattering. A similar but somewhat smaller 

350 improvement is seen for the 221 1 keV 27 AI(n,n’y) inelastic line. 

351 An interesting situation is observed for the 1779 keV 28 Si(n,n’y) and 6129 keV 

352 16 0(n,n’y) inelastic lines shown in Table 1 . These gamma rays are also produced 

353 in the other two spectra by delayed activation reactions (see Table 2). Therefore, 

354 the 1779 and 6129 keV gamma ray lines in the summed spectrum have a better 

355 statistical precision of 0.48% and 1.10% as compared to 1 .00% and 1 .67% 



356 (inelastic spectrum) and 0.52% and 1.42% (capture-delayed activation spectrum), 

357 because there are more counts in the summed spectrum. 

358 The 1 779 and 6129 keV lines are not as useful for determining elemental 

359 weight percent, because they have a large contribution due to delayed activation. 

360 However, the data in the capture-delayed activation spectrum can be used to 

361 correct the data in the inelastic spectrum for the portion of the counts that are 

362 due to inelastic scattering. While this correction leads to a deterioration of the 

363 statistical precision of the weight percent determination from the inelastic data, it 

364 provides elemental concentrations that have dramatically improved accuracy. 

365 3.4 Identifying and Removing Sources of Systematic Error Using TLIST data 

366 Space-based planetary science missions are unique, because there is usually 

367 only one opportunity to collect data. Gamma ray and neutron spectroscopy 

368 remote sensing measurements are further restricted to only gamma rays or 

369 neutrons produced by a constant neutron flux source created by GCR 

370 interactions with the planetary surface and atmosphere. With a weak constant 

371 neutron source there is no need to record event-by-event time and energy data if 

372 the data are transferred periodically with reasonable frequency, since each chunk 

373 of transferred data can be separately analyzed to identify a problem with the 

374 instrument, e.g. deteriorated resolution, and removed without compromising the 

375 entire concatenated data set. However, it is still difficult to determine if the 

376 collected data have been compromised due to other errors. These difficulties 

377 can be mitigated for the case of in situ gamma-ray and neutron spectroscopy 

378 measurements with the PING instrument, since it takes advantage of a pulsed 



379 neutron generator synchronized with gamma ray and neutron detector data 

380 acquisition combined with the ability to post-process acquired time-tagged event- 

381 by-event data. 

382 A unique benefit of incorporating a pulsed neutron generator with a time-tagged 

383 event-by-event data acquisition system is that regions in time containing 

384 suspicious data can be isolated and removed from the data set for further 

385 inspection without affecting the usefulness of the remaining data. Systematic 

386 errors in data are nearly impossible to anticipate but often can be identified when 

387 examining the post-processed data. Examples include systematic errors caused 

388 by equipment operating parameter changes, such as temperature effects on a 

389 detector response or, as illustrated in the data shown in Table 3 below, changes 

390 in the time-dependence of the turn on of neutron-induced gamma-ray flux that 

391 occurs during the PNG burst period. 

392 < Insert Table 3> 

393 We demonstrate the merit of saving event-by-event time and energy data with 

394 our analysis of the gamma-ray count rate of the 6129 keV peak from neutron 

395 inelastic scattering on O for a 2-hr live time gamma-ray acquisition by the PING 

396 instrument set-up on the basalt monument. Since the neutron inelastic scattering 

397 gamma-ray production rate is proportional to the fast neutron flux, we assume 

398 that a stable gamma-ray count rate can be obtained from the time the “pulse start” 

399 signal is given to the PNG ion source (t = 0 psec). We can examine the time 

400 dependence of the fast neutron-induced gamma-ray flux from the time of the 



401 “pulse start” signal to the end of the PNG pulse (t = 0 to 100 psec) to look for 

402 anomalies. 

403 In this example, we generated gamma-ray energy spectra for each of ten time 

404 slices (time slice width = 1 0 psec) of the gamma-ray data during the PNG pulse 

405 and determined the 6129 keV net gamma-ray peak count rate and its associated 

406 uncertainty for each time slice. Table 3 lists the time range for each time slice, 

407 the 6129 keV peak count rates and the uncertainty in the count rates for each of 

408 the ten time slices. Note that the count rates in the first and second time slices 

409 are inconsistent with the count rates in the 8 other time slices and that the count 

410 rate for these later 8 time slices is constant as expected. 

411 The low 6129 keV gamma-ray count rate during the first time slice (t = 0-10 

412 microseconds) indicates that the PNG has not begun producing fast neutrons yet, 

413 since there is a delay between the time that the PNG is sent the “burst on” 

414 command signal and the time when fast neutrons are actually being generated 

415 by the PNG. The higher 6129 keV gamma-ray count rate in the second time 

416 slice (t = 10-20 microseconds) is also inconsistent with the average value for the 

417 other slices and may be due to a systematic error induced by the gamma-ray 

418 detector electronics. In both cases, we can choose to exclude these data points 

419 from further analysis, since they are not representative of the constant inelastic 

420 gamma-ray flux during the PNG pulse. 

421 To be sure, we would investigate the origin of the systematic errors that 

422 prompt us to remove the data from the main analysis. Without this event-by- 

423 event time and energy data, however, these points would have been unexamined 



424 and included in the data, skewing the results. Excluding the data from the first 20 

425 jlis will increase the statistical error on the mean value of the 6129 keV gamma- 

426 ray production rate, but will result in more accurate data that we can use to infer 

427 the bulk elemental composition of planetary material. This is clearly seen by 

428 comparing the 6129 keV weighted mean count rate and uncertainty for time 

429 slices 3 through 10 (t = 20 -100 ps) which is 42.2 cts/ps ±1.10 cts/ps versus the 

430 6129 keV weighted mean count rate and uncertainty for time slices 1 through 10 

431 (t = 0 -100 ps) which is 30.1 cts/ps ± 0.82 cts/ps. The difference between these 

432 two averages is almost ten times the statistical uncertainty, resulting in a very 

433 significant systematic error that would compromise the accuracy of derived 

434 elemental concentrations. 

435 

436 4. Conclusions 

437 Many of the problems typically encountered by planetary gamma-ray 

438 elemental composition measurements are addressed by using PING in event-by- 

439 event data acquisition mode. For example, it is generally impossible to know a 

440 priori how to set optimum time windows for gamma-ray detection when using a 

441 pulsed neutron generator as the source of neutrons, because of compositional 

442 variations from location to location on a planetary body. This is a real problem 

443 because there is usually only one opportunity to acquire a specific set of data 

444 during planetary missions. This problem is solved when taking data in an event- 

445 by-event mode, because data can be analyzed after it is collected and therefore 

446 set optimum time windows based on the data. 



447 Our goal is to obtain the best estimate of elemental concentrations from the 

448 gamma-ray data. However, the same energy gamma ray can often be created 

449 from different isotopes via two different reaction mechanisms. In such instances 

450 we can separate out different time regions where a particular gamma ray is due 

451 to a specific reaction mechanism. 

452 Post-processing event-by-event data allows PING to obtain the best precision 

453 and most accurate results. For example, in the analysis of a peak that only 

454 occurs in one time region, one can reduce its uncertainty by -40% by eliminating 

455 background in that energy region that occurs at times when the peak is not 

456 present. Perhaps even more important is the improvement in accuracy that can 

457 be achieved when the same gamma ray peak can be obtained at different times 

458 from different reaction mechanisms. The inelastic window in Table 1 for the 1779 

459 gamma-ray peak is largely from the 28 Si(n,n’y) reaction. However this area must 

460 be corrected for the delayed activity present. The result is a factor of 3 smaller 

461 than the 1779 keV area for the entire time spectrum, but the reduced area can 

462 now be converted to weight percent Si. 

463 Another improvement in the accuracy of the results can be obtained by 

464 eliminating data when it appears the instrument is not performing properly as 

465 shown in Table 3 and discussed in Section 3.4. For example, the 6129 keV 

466 weighted mean average for 0-100 ps is 30.1 cts/ps ± 0.82 cts/ps and for 20-100 

467 ps is 42.2 cts/ps ±1.10 cts/ps. Although the statistical error of the weighted 

468 mean average increases when you exclude the first 20 ps, the difference 

469 between these two averages is almost ten times the statistical uncertainty and 



470 would significantly impact the accuracy of the derived bulk elemental 

471 concentrations of planetary material. 

472 We can also minimize instrumental problems by subdividing the total data set 

473 at certain times to investigate such things as gain shifts. Thus by independently 

474 analyzing subsets of the data, you can preserve data quality that would be 

475 compromised if you where limited to only analyzing PHA data. 

476 When using a pulsed neutron source, the potential exists for obtaining higher 

477 precision data. By using event-by-event data acquisition, the risk of improper 

478 timing settings is eliminated and systematic errors can be reduced or eliminated. 

479 Taken together, event-by-event data acquisition of pulsed neutron-induced 

480 gamma ray spectra for determining elemental concentrations, provides significant 

481 enhancements to measurements obtained on a planetary surface resulting in the 

482 best scientific information on a particular mission.
