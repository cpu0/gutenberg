INTRODUCTION 


CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 


This Validation Summary Report (VSR) describes the extent to which a 
specific Ada compiler conforms to the Ada Standard, ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A. 
This report explains all technical terms used within it and tnoroughly 
reports the results of testing this compiler using the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability (ACVC). An Ada compiler must be implemented 
according to the Ada Standard, and any implementation-*dependent features 
must conform to the requirements of the Ada Standard. The Ada Standard 
must be implemented in its entirety, and nothing can be implemented that is 
not in the Standard. 


Even though all validated Ada compilers conform to the Ada Standard, it 
must be understood that some differences do exist between implementations. 

The Ada Standard permits some implementation dependencies—for example, the , ^ 

maximum length of identifiers or the maximum values of integer types. 

Other differences between compilers result from the characteristics of 
particular operating systems, hardware, or implementation strategies. All 
the dependencies observed during the process of testing this compiler are 
given in this report. 


The information in this report is derived from the test results produced 
during validation testing. The validation process includes submitting a 
suite of standardized tests, the ACVC, as inputs to an Ada compiler and 
evaluating the results. The purpose of validating is to ensure conformity 
of the compiler to the Ada Standard by testing that the compiler properly 
implements legal language constructs and that it identifies and rejects 
illegal language constructs. The testing also identifies behavior that is 
implementation dependent, but is permitted by the Ada Standard. Six 
classes of tests are used. These tests are designed to perform checks at 
compile time, at link time, and during execution. 


1.1 PURPOSE OF THIS VALIDATION SUMMARY REPORT 

This VSR documents the results of the validation testing performed on an 
Ada compiler. Testing was carried out for the following purposes: 


2 



INTRODUCTION 


. To attempt to identify any language constructs supported by the 
compiler that do not conform to the Ada Standard 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs not supported by 
the compiler but required by the Ada Standard 

. To determine that the implementation-dependent behavior is allowed 
by the Ada Standard 


Testing of this compiler was conducted by the AVT according to 
procedures established by the Ada Joint Program Office and administered by 
the Ada Validation Organization (AVO).

INTRODUCTION 


Inapplicable An ACVC test that uses features of the language that a 

test compiler is not required to support or may legitimately 

support in a way other than the one expected by the test. 

Passed test An ACVC test for which a compiler generates the expected 

result. 

Target The computer which executes the code generated by the 

compiler. 

Test A program that checks a compiler's conformity regarding a 

particular feature or a combination of features to the Ada 
Standard. In the context of this report, the term is used to 
designate a single test, which may comprise one or more 
files. 

An ACVC test found to be incorrect and not used to check 
conformity to the Ada Standard. A test may be incorrect 
because it has an invalid test objective, fails to meet its 
test objective, or contains illegal or erroneous use of the 
language. 


1.5 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conformity to the Ada Standard is measured using the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains both legal and illegal Ada programs structured into six test 
classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies 
the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable, 
and special program units are used to report their results during 
execution. Class B tests are expected to produce compilation errors. 
Class L tests are expected to produce errors because of the way in which a 
program library is used at link time. 

Class A tests ensure the successful compilation and execution of legal Ada 
programs with certain language constructs which cannot be verified at run 
time. There are no explicit program components in a Class A test to check 
semantics. For example, a Class A test checks that reserved words of 
another language (other than those already reserved in the Ada language) 
are not treated as reserved words by an Ada compiler. A Class A test is 
passed if no errors are detected at compile time and the program executes 
to produce a PASSED message. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. 
Class B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and 
the resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that every syntax 
or semantic error in the test is detected. A Class B test is passed if 
every illegal construct that it contains is detected by the compiler.

INTRODUCTION 


Class C tests check the run time system to ensure that legal Ada programs 
can be correctly compiled and executed. Each Class C test is self-checking 
and produces a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result when it is executed. 

Class D tests check the compilation and execution capacities of a compiler. 
Since there are no capacity requirements placed on a compiler by the Ada 
Standard for some parameters—for example, the number of identifiers 
permitted in a compilation or the number of units in a library—a compiler 
may refuse to compile a Class D test and still be a conforming compiler. 
Therefore, if a Class D test fails to compile because the capacity of the 
compiler is exceeded, the test is classified as inapplicable. If a Class D 
test compiles successfully, it is self-checking and produces a PASSED or 
FAILED message during execution. 

Class E tests are expected to execute successfully and check 
implementation-dependent options and resolutions of ambiguities in the Ada 
Standard. Each Class E test is self-checking and produces a NOT 
APPLICABLE, PASSED, or FAILED message when it is compiled and executed. 
However, the Ada Standard permits an implementation to reject programs 
containing some features addressed by Class E tests during compilation. 
Therefore, a Class E test is passed by a compiler if it is compiled 
successfully and executes to produce a PASSED message, or if it is rejected 
by the compiler for an allowable reason. 

Class L tests check that incomplete or illegal Ada programs involving 
multiple, separately compiled units are detected and not allowed to 
execute. Class L tests are compiled separately and execution is attempted. 
A Class L test passes if it is rejected at link time—that is, an attempt 
to execute the main program must generate an error message before any 
declarations in the main program or any units referenced by the main 
program are elaborated. In some cases, an implementation may legitimately 
detect errors during compilation of the test. 

Two library units, the package REPORT and the procedure CHECK_FILE, support 
the self-checking features of the executable tests. The package REPORT 
provides the mechanism by which executable tests report PASSED, FAILED, or 
NOT APPLICABLE results. It also provides a set of identity functions used 
to defeat some compiler optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that 
would circumvent a test objective. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to 
check the contents of text files written by some of the Class C tests for 
Chapter 14 of the Ada Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. These tests produce messages that 
are examined to verify that the units are operating correctly. If these 
units are not operating correctly, then the validation is not attempted. 

The text of each test in the ACVC follows conventions that are intended to 
ensure that the tests are reasonably portable without modification. For 
example, the tests make use of only the basic set of 55 characters, contain 
lines with a maximum length of 72 characters, use small numeric values, and 
tests. However, some tests contain values that require the test to be 


6 






INTRODUCTION 


customized according to implementation-specific values—for example, an 
illegal file name. A list of the values used for this validation is 
provided in Appendix C. 

A compiler must correctly process each of the tests in the suite and 
demonstrate conformity to the Ada Standard by either meeting the pass 
criteria given for the test or by showing that the test is inapplicable to 
the implementation. The applicability of a test to an implementation is 
considered each time the implementation is validated. A test that is 
inapplicable for one validation is not necessarily inapplicable for a 
subsequent validation. Any test that was determined to contain an illegal 
language construct or an erroneous language construct is withdrawn from the 
ACVC and, therefore, is not used in testing a compiler. The tests 
withdrawn at the time of this validation are given in Appendix D.

CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


2.2 IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS 

One of the purposes of validating compilers is to determine the behavior of 
a compiler in those areas of the Ada Standard that permit implementations 
to differ. Class D and E tests specifically check for such implementation 
differences. However, tests in other classes also characterize an 
implementation. The tests demonstrate the following characteristics: 

a. Capacities. 

1) The compiler correctly processes a compilation 
containing 723 variables in the same declarative part. (See 
test D29002K.) 

2) The compiler correctly processes tests containing 

loop statements nested to 65 levels. (See tests D55A03A..H 
(8 tests).) 

3) The compiler correctly processes tests containing 

block statements nested to 65 levels. (See test D560013.) 

4) The compiler correctly processes tests containing 

recursive procedures separately compiled as subunits nested to 
17 levels. (See tests D64005E..G (3 tests).) 

b. Predefined types. 

1) This implementation supports the additional predefined types 
SHORT_INTEGER, SHORT_SHORT_INTEGER and LONG_FLOAT in the 
package STANDARD. (See tests B86001T..Z (7 tests).) 

c. Expression evaluation. 

The order in which expressions are evaluated and the time at which 

constraints are checked are not defined by the language. While 

the ACVC tests do not specifically attempt to determine the order 

of evaluation of expressions, test results indicate the following: 

1) Some of the default initialization expressions 
for record components are evaluated before any value is 
checked for membership in a component's subtype. (See test 
C32117A.) 

2) Assignments for subtypes are performed with the same 
precision as the base type. (See test C35712B.) 

3) This implementation uses no extra bits for extra precision 
and uses no extra bits for extra range. (See test C35903A.) 


9 





CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


4) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised for predefined and largest integer 
comparison tests, and NUMERIC_ERROR is raised for predefined 
and largest integer membership tests, and no exception is 
raised for smallest integer membership tests when an integer 
literal operand in a comparison or membership test is outside 
the range of the base type. (See test C45232A.) 

5) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when a literal operand in a 
fi.xed-point comparison or membership test is outside the range 
of the base type. (See test C45252A.) 

6) Underflow is gradual. (See tests C45524A..Z (26 tests).) 


d. Rounding. 

The method by which values are rounded in type conversions is not 
defined by the language. While the ACVC tests do not specifically 
attempt to determine the method of rounding, the test results 
indicate the following: 

1) The method.used for rounding to integer is round to even, 
(See tests C46I312A..Z (26 tests).) 

2) The method used for rounding to longest integer is round 
to even. (See tests C46012A..Z (26 tests).) 

3) The method used for rounding to integer in static universal 
real expressions is round away from zero. (See test C4A014A.) 


e. Array types. 

An implementation is allowed to raise NUMERIC_ERROR or 
CONSTRAINT_ERROR for an array having a 'LENGTH that exceeds 
STANDARD.INTEGER'LAST and/or SYSTEM.MAX_INT. For this 

implementation: 

1) Declaration of an array type or subtype declaration with more 
than SYSTEM.MAX_INT components raises no exception under the 
specific circumstances test C36003A, 

2) MUMERIC_ERROR is raised when 'LENGTH is applied to an array 
type with INTEGER'LAST +2 components. (See test C36202A.) 

3) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when an array type with 

SYSTEM.MAX_INT + 2 components is declared. (See test 

C36202B.) 


10 






CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


4) A packed BOOLEAN array having a ’LENGTH exceeding INTEGER'LAST 
raises NUMERIC_ERROR. (See test C52103X,) 

5) A packed two-dimensional BOOLEAN array with more than 
INTEGER'LAST components raises NUMERIC_ERROR when the length 
of a dimension is calculated and exceeds INTEGER'LAST. (See 
test C52104Y.) 

6) In assigning one-dimensional array types, the expression is 

evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is 

raised when checking whether the expression's subtype is 

compatible with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

7) In assigning two-dimensional array types, the expression 

is not evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is 
raised when checking whether the expression's subtype is 

compatible with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


8) A null array with one dimension of length greater than 
INTEGER'LAST may raise NUMERIC_ERROR or CONSTRAINT_ERROR 
either when declared or assigned. Alternatively, an 
implementation may accept the declaration. However, lengths 
must match in array slice assignments. This implementation 
raises NUMERIC ERROR. (See test E52103Y.) 


f. Discriminated types. 

1) In assigning record types with discriminants, the expression 
is evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT^ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


g. Aggregates. 

1) In the evaluation of a multi-dimensional aggregate, the test 
results indicate that index subtype checks are 
made as choices are evaluated. (See tests C43207A and 
C43207B.) 

2) In the evaluation of an aggregate containing subaggregates, 
not all choices are evaluated before being checked for 
identical bounds. (See test E43212B.) 


11 











CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised after all choices are 
evaluated when a bound in a non-null range of a non-null 
aggregate does not belong to an index subtype. (See test 
E43211B.) 


h. Pragmas. 

1) The pragma INLINE is not supported for procedures or func¬ 
tions. (See tests LA3O04A..B (2 tests), EA3004C..O (2 tests), 
and CA3004B..F (2 tests).) 


i. Generics. 

This implementation creates a dependence between a generic body 

and those units which instatiate it. As allowed by AI-408/11, if 

the body is compiled after a unit that instantiates it, then that 

unit becomes obsolete. 

1) Generic specifications and bodies can be compiled 

in separate compilations. (See tests CA1012A, CA2O09C, 
CA2009F, BC3204C, and BC3205D.) 

2) Generic subprogram declarations and bodies can be 

compiled in separate compilations. (See tests CA1012A and 
CA2009F.) 

3) Generic library subprogram specifications and ■ bodies can 
be compiled in separate compilations. (See test 
CA1012A.) 

4) Generic non-library package bodies as subunits can 

be compiled in separate compilations. (See test CA2009C.) 

5) Generic non-library subprogram bodies can be 
compiled in separate compilations from their stubs. (See test 
CA2009F.) 

6) Generic unit bodies and their subunits can be 

compiled in separate compilations. (See test CA3011A.) 

7) Generic package declarations and bodies can be 
compiled in separate compilations. (See tests CA2009C, 
BC3204C, and BC3205D.) 

8) Generic library package specifications and bodies can 

be compiled in separate compilations. (See tests 
BC3204C and BC3205D.)

(See test CE2208B.) 

Temporary sequential files are given names and not 
deleted when closed. (See test CE2108A.) 

Temporary direct files are not given names and not 
deleted when closed. (See test CE2108C.)

when closed. (See test CE3112A.) 

More than one internal file can be associated with 
each external file for sequential files when reading 
only. (See tests CE2107A..E (5 tests), CE2102L, CE2110B, and 
CE2111D.)

TEST INFORMATION 


CHAPTER 3 
TEST INFORMATION 


3.1 TEST RESULTS 

Version 1.10 of the ACVC comprises 3717 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, 44 tests had been withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF 
determined that 312 tests were inapplicable to this implementation. 
All inapplicable tests were processed during validation testing except for 
201 executable tests that use floating-point precision exceeding 
that supported by the implementation. Modifications to the code, 
processing, or grading for 12 tests were required to successfully 
demonstrate the test objective. (See section 3.6.) 

The AVF concludes that the testing results demonstrate acceptable 
conformity to the Ada Standard.

3.5 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 


Some tests do not apply to all compilers because they make use of features 
that a compiler is not required by the Ada Standard to support. Others may 
depend on the result of another test that is either inapplicable or 
withdrawn. The applicability of a test to an implementation is considered 
each time a validation is attempted. A test that is inapplicable for one 
validation attempt is not necessarily inapplicable for a subsequent 
attempt. For this validation attempt, 312 tests were inapplicable for 


a. The following 201 tests are not applicable because they have 
floating-point type declarations requiring more digits than 
SYSTEM.MAX DIGITS: 


C24113L..Y (14 tests) 
C35706L..Y (14 tests) 
C35708L..Y (14 tests) 
C45241L..Y (14 tests) 


C35705L..Y (14 tests) 
C35707L..Y (14 tests) 
C35802L..Z (15 tests) 
C45321L..Y (14 tests)

b. C35508I, C35508J, C35508M, and C35508N are not applicable because 

they include enumeration representation clauses for BOOLEAN types 
in which the representation values are other than (FALSE => 0, 

TRUE *> 1). Under the terms of AI-00325, this implementation is 

not required to support such representation clauses. 

c. C35702A and B86001T are not applicable because this implementation 
supports no predefined type SHORT_FLOAT. 

d. C45531M..P (4 tests) and C45532M..P (4 tests) are not applicable 

because they acquire a value of SYSTEM.MAX MANTISSA greater than 
32. 

e. C52008B is not applicable because this implementation generates 
code to calculate the maximum object size for type REC2 at run 
time which yields a number exceeding INTEGER'LAST and raises 
NUMERIC_ERROR. 

f. C86001F is not applicable because, for this implementation, the 
package TEXT_IO is dependent upon package SYSTEM. These tests 
recompile package SYSTEM, making package TEXT.IO, and 
hence package REPORT, obsolete. 

g. B86001Y is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined fixed-point type other than DURATION. 

h. B86001Z is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined floating-point type with a name other than FLOAT, 
LONG_FLOAT, or SHORT_FLOAT. 

i. The following 16 tests are not applicable because this 
implementation does not support a predefined type LONG.INTEGER: 

C45231C C45304C C45502C C45503C C45504C

CD7101F 

j. CA2009C, CA2009F, BC3204C and BC3205D are not applicable because 

this implementation creates a dependence between a generic body 
and those units which instantiate it (See Section 2.2.i and 
Appendix F of the Ada Standard). 

k. LA3004A, EA3004C, and CA3004E are not applicable because this 
implementation does not support pragma INLINE for procedures. 


17 





l. LA3004B, EA3O04D, and CA3004? are not applicable because this 
implementation does not support pragma INLINE for functions. 

m. CD1009C, CD2A41A..B (2 tests), CD2A41E and CD2A42A..J (10 tests) 
are not applicable because of restrictions on 'SIZE length clauses 
for floating point types. 

n. CD1C04E is not applicable because this implementation does not 
support component clauses specifying more than 3 bits for boolean 
components of a record. 

0 . CD2A61I..J (2 tests) are not applicable because of restrictions on 
'SIZE length clauses for array types. 

p. CD2A84B..I (8 tests) and C02A84R..L (2 tests) are not applicable 
because of restrictions on 'SIZE length clauses for access types. 

q. AE2101H, EE2401O, and EE24016 use instantiations of package 

DIRECT_IO with unconstrained array types and record types with 
discriminants without defaults. These instantiations are rejected 
by this compiler.

ag. CE2107B..E (4 tests), CE2107L, CE2110B, and CE2111D are not 

applicable because multiple internal files cannot be associated 
with the same external file when one or more files is writing 

for sequential files. The proper exception is raised when 

multiple access is attempted. 

ah. CE2107G..H (2 tests), CE2110O, and CE2111H are not applicable 
because multiple internal files cannot be associated with the same 
external file when one or more files is writing for direct files.

with the same external file when one or more files is writing for 
text files. The proper exception is raised when multiple access 
is attempted.

3.6 TEST, PROCESSING, AND EVALUATION MODIFICATIONS 

It is expected that some tests will require modifications of code, 
processing, or evaluation in order to compensate for legitimate 
implementation behavior. Modifications are made by the AVF in cases where 
legitimate implementation behavior prevents the successful completion of an 
(otherwise) applicable test. Examples of such modifications include: 
adding a length clause to alter the default size of a collection; splitting 
a Class B test into subtests so that all errors are detected; and 
confirming that messages produced by an executable test demonstrate 
conforming behavior that was not anticipated by the test (such as raising 
one exception instead of another). 

Modifications were required for 12 tests. 

The following tests were split because syntax errors at one point resulted 
in the compiler not detecting other errors in the test: 

B71001E B71001K B71001Q B71001W BA2001C 

BA2001E BA3006A BA3006B 6A3007B BA3008A 

BA3008B BA3013A (6 and 7M) 


3.7 ADDITIONAL TESTING INFORMATION 
3.7.1 Provalidation 

Prior to validation, no test results for ACVC Version 1.10 produced with 
the TC2000 pSOS Ada System was submitted to the AVF by the applicant for 
review because the applicant certified that they would be identical to the 
results of the TC2000 Ada System (Certificate Number #89112311.10218). 


3.7.2 Test Method 

Testing of the TC2000 pSOS Ada Compiler using ACVC Version 1.10 was 
conducted on-site by a validation team from the AVF. The 

configuration in which the testing was performed is described by the 
following designations of hardware and software components: 

Host Computer: BBN TC2000 

Host Operating System: nX 1.0 

Target Computer: BBN TC2000 

Target Operating System: TC2000 pSOS 0.8.2 


20 





Host and target computers were part of a multiprocessor machine. Different 
operating systems were used for the processors selected for this 
validation. Communication between the host and target processors was 
achieved by shared memory. 

A cartridge containing the customized test suite was loaded onto a SUN-3 
and transferred via Ethernet to the host computer. 

The compiler was tested using command scripts provided by TeleSoft 
and reviewed by the validation team. The tests were compiled using the 
command 

ada -V 20C0 -S -W +enable -W ■♦•driver (test file) 

and linked with the command 

aid -V 2000 -S -W ■♦■link_target=bbn (main unit) 

The -L qualifier was added to the compiler call for class B and E tests. 
See Appendix E for explanation of compiler and linker switches. 

Tests were compiled, linked, and executed (as appropriate) using two com¬ 
puters. Test output, compilation listings, and job logs were 
captured on magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined 
on-site by the validation team were also archived. 


3.7.3 Test Site 

Testing was conducted at TeleSoft, San Diego, USA, and was completed on 
31 January 1990.

Appendix F 


1. Implementation Dependent Pragmas 

pragma COM\IENT(<string_literal>); 

It may only appear within a compilation unit. 

The pragma comment has the effect of embedding the given 
sequence of characters in the object code of the compilation unit. 

pragma LINKNAME(<3ubprogram_a<une>, otring literaJ>); 

It may appear in any declaration section of a unit. 

This pragma must also appear directly after an interface pragma 
for the same <3ubprogram_name>. The pragma linkname has the 
effect of making string litercil apparent to the linker. 

pragma INTERRUPT(Function Mapping); 

It may only appear immediately before a simple accept statement, 
a while loop directly enclosing only a single accept statement, 
or a select statement that includes an interrupt accept alternative. 
The pragma interrupt has the effect that entry calls to the 
associated entry, on behalf of an interrupt, are made with a 
reduced call overhead. 

pragma IMAGES(<enumeration_type>,Deferred) or 
pragma IMAGES( <enumeration_type>,Immediate); 

It may only appear within a compilation unit. 

The pragma images controls the creation and allocation of 
the image table for a specified enumeration type. The 
default is Deferred, which saves space in the literal pool 
by not creating an image table for an enumeration type 
unless the ’Image, ’Value, or ’Width attribute for the type 
is used. If one of these attributes is used, an image table 
is generated in the literal pool of the compilation unit in 
which the attribute appears. If the attributes etre used in 
more than one compilation unit, more than one image table is 
generated, eliminating the benefits of deferring the table. 

pragma SUPPRESS_ALL; 

It may appear anywhere that a Suppress pragma may appear as 
defined by the Language Reference Manual. The pragma 
Suppress_.\ll has the effect of turning off all checks 
defined in section 11.7 of the Language Reference Manual. 

The scope of applicablility of this pragma is the same as 
that of the pre-defined pragma Suppress.

2. Implementation Dependent Attributes 


’Offset Attribute 

’Offset along with the attribute ’Address, facilitates machine code 
insertions. For a prefix P that denotes a declared parameter 
object, P’OfiseC yields the statically known portion of the 
address of the first of the storage units allocated to P. The 
value is the object’s offset relative to a base register and is 
of type Long_Integer. 


INTEGER ATTRIBUTES 


’Extended_Image Attribute 


Usage: X’Excended__Image(Item,Width,Base,Based,Spacc IF Positive) 

Returns the image associated with Item as per the Text lo definition. 
The Text_Io definition states that the value of Item is an integer 
literal with no underlines, no exponent, no leading zeros 
(but a single zero for the zero value) and a minus sign if negative. 

If the resulting sequence of characters to be output has fewer than 
Width characters then leading spaces are first output to make up 
the difference. (LRM 14.3.7:10,14.3.7:11) 

For a prefix X that is a discrete type or subtype; this attribute 
is a function that may have more than one parameter. The parameter 
Item must be an integer value. The resulting string is 
without underlines, leading zeros, or trailing spaces.

Parameter Descriptions: 

Item — The user specifies the item that he wants the 

image of iuid passes it into the function. This 
parameter is required. 

Width — The user may specify the minimum number.of 

characters to be in the string that is returned. 

If no width is specified then the default (0) is 
assumed. 

Base — The user may specify the base that the image is 

to be displayed in. If no base is specified then 
the default (10) is assumed. 

Based — The user may specify whether he wants the string 

returned to be in base notation or not. If no 
preference is specified then the default (false) 
is assumed. 

Space_If_Positive — The user may specify whether or not the sign bit 
of a positive integer is included in the string 
returned. If no preference is specified then 
the default (false) is assumed.

Appendix F, Cont. 


’Extended Value Attribute 


Usage: X’Extended Value(Iteni) 

Returns the value associated with Item as per the Text_Io definition. 
The Text_lo definition states that given a string, it reads an 
integer value from the beginning of the string. The value returned 
corresponds to the sequence input. (LRM 14.3.7:14) 

For a prefix X that is a discrete type or subtype; this attribute 
is a function with a single parameter. The actual parameter Item 
must be of predefined type string. Any leading or trailing 
spaces in the string X are ignored. In the case where an illegal 
string is passed, a CONSTRAINT ERROR is raised. 

Parameter Descriptions: 

Item — The user passes to the function a parameter of the 
predefined type string. The type of the returned 
value is the base type X. 

Examples: 

Suppose the following subtype was declared: 

Subtype X is Integer Range •10..16; 

Then the following would be true: 


X’Extended_Value("5”) * 5 

X’Extended_Vaiue(” 5”) ” 5 

X’Extended_Value('’2#101#”) - 3 

X’Extended_Value("-l") - -1 

X’Extended_Vaiue(”-1”) —-I

Appendix F, Cont. 


’Extended_Width Attribute 

Usage: X’Extended_Width(Base,B^«d,Space_If_Poaitive) 

Returns the width for subtype of X. 

For a prefix X that is a discrete subtype; this attribute 
is a function that may have multiple parameters. This attribute 
yields the maximum image length over all values of the type 
or subtype X. 


Parameter Descriptions: 

Base — The user specifies the base for which the width 

will be calculated. If no base is specified 
then the default (10) is assumed. 

Based — The user specifies whether the subtype is stated 

in based notation. If no value for based is 
specified then the default (false) is assumed. 

Space^If_Positive — The user may specify whether or not the sign bit 
of a positive integer is included in the string 
returned. If no preference is specified then the 
default (false) is assumed. 

Examples: 

Suppose the following subtype was declared: 

Subtype X is Integer Range •10..16; 

Then the following would be true: 


X'Extended Width 


X'Extended Width(lO)

ENUMERATION ATTRIBUTES 


’Extended Image Attribute 

Usage: X’Extended_Image(Item,Widtb,Uppercase) 

Returns the image associated with Item as per the Text lo definition. 
The Text_Io definition states that given an enumeration literal, 
it will output the value of the enumeration literal (either an 
identifier or a character literal). The character case parameter 
is ignored for character literals. (LRM 14.3.9:9) 

For a prefix X that is a discrete type or subtype; this attribute 
is a function that may have more that one parameter. The parameter 
Item must be an enumeration value. The image of an enumeration 
value is the corresponding identifier which may have character case 
and return string width specified. 


Parameter Descriptions: 

Item — The user specifies the item that he wants the image of and 
passes it into the function. This parameter is required. 

Width — The user may specify the minimum number of charturters to 
be in the string that is returned. If no width is 
specified then the default (0) is assumed. If the Width 
specified is larger than the image of Item, then the 
return string is padded with trailing spaces; if the 
Width specified is smaller than the image of Item then 
the default is assumed and the image of the enumeration 
value is output completely. 

Uppercase ^ The user may specify whether the returned string is in 
uppercase characters. In the case of an enumeration 
type where the enumeration literals are character 
literals, the Uppercase is ignored and the case 
specified by the type definition is taken. If no 
preference is specified then the default (true) is 
assumed.

FLOATING POINT ATTRIBUTES 
'Extende(l_Iinage Attribute 

Usage: X'Extended _Image( Item,Fore,Aft,Exp,Base,B^ed) 

Returns the image associated with Item as per the Text lo definition. 
The Text_Io definition states that it outputs the value of the 
parameter Item as a decimal literal with the format defined by the 
other parameters. If the value is negative then a minus sign 
is included in the integer part of the value of Item. If Exp 
is 0 then the integer part of the output has as many digits as 
are needed to represent the integer part of the value of Item or 
is zero if the value of Item has no integer part. (LRM 14.3.3:13, 
14.3.8:15] 

For a prefix X that is a discrete type or subtype; this attribute 
is a function that may have more than one parameter. The parameter 
Item must be a Real value. The resulting string is 
without underlines or trailing spaces. 


Parameter Description:;: 

Item — Th‘' user specifies the item that he wants the image of and 
passes it into the function. This parameter is requin i. 

Fore — The user may specify the minimum number of characters for 
the integer part of the decimal representation in the 
return string. This includes a minus sign if the 
value is negative and the base with the if based 
notation is specified. If the integer part to be output 
has fewer characters than specified by Fore, then leading 
spaces are output first to make up the difference. If no 
Fore is specified then the default (2) value is assumed. 

Aft — The user may specify the minimum number of decimal digits 
after the decimal point to accommodate the precision desired. 
If the delta of the type or subtype is greater than 
0.1 then .4ft is one. If no Aft is specified then the 
default (X'Digits-1) is assumed. If based notation is 
specified the trailing is included in aft. 

Exp — The user may specify the minimum number of digits in the 
exponent: the exponent consists of a sign and the exponent, 
possibly with leading zeros. If no Exp is specified then 
the default (3 ) is assumed. If Exp is 0 then no exponent 
is used.

’Extended_Value Attribute 
Usage: X’Extended_Value{Item) 

Returns the value associated with Item as per the Text lo definition. 
The Text_Io definition states that it skips any leading zeros, 
then reads a plus or minus sign if present then reads the string 
according to the syntax of a real literal. The return value is 
that which corresponds to the sequence input. (LRM 14.3.8:9, 
14.3.8:10) 

For a prefix X that is a discrete type or subtype; this attribute 
is a function with a single parameter. The actual parameter Item 
must be of predefined type string. Any leading or trailing 
spaces in the string X are ignored. In the case where an illegal

4. Restrictions on Representation Clauses 

The hardware needs a minimum of 32 bits to represent floating point 
and access types. Therefore, specifying a size of less than 32 bits cannot 
be handled simply by the underlying hardware (LRM 13.1 (10)). 

The Compiler supports the following representation clauses: 

Length Clauses: for enumeration and derived integer types ’SIZE 
attribute (LRM 13.2(a)) 

Length Clauses: for composite types ’SIZE attribute (LRM 13.2(a) 

Size clauses for composite types are rejected when the 
specified size implies compression of composite components. 

Length Clauses: for access types ’ST0RAGE_SIZE attribute (LRM 13.2(b)) 

Length Clauses: for tasks types ’ST0RAGE_SIZE attribute (LRM 13.2(c)) 

Length Clauses: for fixed point types ’SMALL attribute (LRM 13.2(d)) 

Enumeration Clauses: for character and enumeration types other than 
boolean (LRM 13.3) 

Record representation Clauses (LRM 13.4) with following constraints: 

• Each component of the record must be specified with 
a component clause. 

• The alignment of the record is restricted to mod 2. 
word (16 bit)aligned. 

• Bits are ordered right to left within a byte. 

Address Clauses; for objects, entries and external subprograms 
(pragma INTERFACE used) (LRM 13.5(a)(c)) 

This compiler does NOT support the following representation clauses: 

Enumeration Clauses: for boolean (LRM 13.3) 

.\ddress Clauses: for packages, task units, and non-external Ada 
subprograms (LRM 13.3(b))

Appendix F, Cent. 

5. Implementation dependent naming conventions 

There are no implementation-generated names denoting implementation 
dependent components. 

6. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clause 

Expressions that appear in address specifications are interpreted as the 
first storage unit of the object. 

7. Restrictions on Unchecked Conversions 

Unchecked conversions are allowed between any types or subtypes unless 
the target type is an unconstrained record or array type. 


8. I/O Package Characteristics 

Sequential lO can be instantiated for unconstrained array 

types or unconstrained types with discriminants without default values, 

but not Direct^IO. 

In TEXT_IO the type COUNT is defined as follows: 

type COUNT is range 0 .. 2_147_483_646; 

In TEXT_IO the subtype FIELD is defined as follows: 

subtype FIELD is INTEGER range 0..1000; 

In TEXT 10, the Form parameter of procedures Create and Open is not 
supported. (If you supply a Form parameter with either procedure, it 
is ignored.)

WITHDRAWN TESTS 


APPENDIX D 
WITHDRAWN TESTS 


Some tests are withdrawn from the ACVC because they do not conform to the 
Ada Standard. The following 44 tests had been withdrawn at the time of 
validation testing for the reasons indicated. A reference of the form 
Al-ddddd is to an Ada Commentary. 


a. E280O5C This test expects that the string "— TOP OF PAGE. 

63" of line 204 will appear at the top of the listing page due 
to a pragma PAGE in line 203; but line 203 contains text that 
follows the pragma, and it is this that must appear at the top 
of the page. 

b. A39005G This test unreasonably expects a component clause to 

pack an array component into a minimum size (line 30). 

c. B97102E This test contains an unitended illegality: a select 

statement contains a null statement at the place of a selective 
wait alternative (line 31). 

d. C97116A This test contains race conditions, and it assumes that 
guards are evaluated indivisibly. A conforming implementation 
may use interleaved execution in such a way that the evaluation 
of the guards at lines 50 & 54 and the execution of task CHANGING- 
_OF_THE_GUARD results in a call to REPORT.FAILED at one of 
lines 52 or 56. 

e. BC3009B This test wrongly expects that circular instantiations 
will be detected in several compilation units even though none of 
the units is illegal with respect to the units it depends on; by 
AI-00256, the illegality need not be detected until execution is 
attempted (line 95). 

f. CD2A62D This test wrongly requires that an array object's size 
be no greater than 10 although its subtype's size was specified 
to be 40 (line 137). 






VITHDRAVN TESTS 


g. CD2A63A..D, CD2A66A..D, CD2A73A..D, CD2A76A..D [16 tests] These 
tests wrongly attempt to check the size of objects of a derived 
type (for which a 'SIZE length clause is given) by passing them 
to a derived subprogram (which implicitly converts them to the 
parent type (Ada standard 3.4:14)). Additionally, they use the 
'SIZE length clause and attribute, whose interpretation is 
considered problematic by the WG9 ARG. 

h. CD2A31G, CD2A83G, CD2A84N & M, & CDSOllO [5 tests] These tests 

assume that dependent tasks will terminate while the main pro¬ 
gram executes a loop that simply tests for task termination; this 
is not the case, and the main program may loop indefinitely 
(lines 74, 85, 86 & 96, 36 & 96, and 58, resp.). 

i. CD2B15C & CD7205C These tests expect that a 'STORAGE_SIZE 
length clause provides precise control over the number of 
designated objects in a collection; the Ada standard 13.2:15 
allows that such control must not be expected. 

j. CD2D11B This test gives a SMALL representation clause for a 

derived fixed-point type (at line 30) that defines a set of 
model numbers that are not necessarily represented in the 
parent type; by Commentary AI-00099, all model numbers of a 
derived fixed-point type must be representable values of the 
parent type. 

k. CD5007B This test wrongly expects an implicitly declared sub¬ 

program to be at the the address that is specified for an un¬ 
related subprogram (line 303). 

l. ED7O04B, BD7005C & D, ED7O06C & D [5 tests] These tests check 
various aspects of the use of the three SYSTEM pragmas; the AVO 
withdraws these tests as being inappropriate for validation. 

m. CD7105A This test requires that successive calls to CALENDAR.- 

CLOCK change by at least SYSTEM.TICK; however, by Commentary 

AI-00201, it is only the expected frequency of change that must 
be at least SYSTEM.TICK—particular instances of change may be 
less (line 29). 

n. CD7203B, & CD7204B These tests use the 'SIZE length clause and 
attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic by 
the WG9 ARG. 

0 . CD7205D This test checks an invalid test objective: it treats 

the specification of storage to be reserved for a task's 
activation as though it were like the specification of storage 
for a collection. 

p. CE2107I This test requires that objects of two similar scalar 
types be distinguished when read from a file—DATA_ERROR is 






WITHDRAWN TESTS 


expected to be raised by an attempt to read one object as of 
the other type. However, it is not clear exactly how the Ada 
standard 14.2.4:4 is to be interpreted; thus, this test objective 
is not considered valid, (line 90) 

q. CE3111C This test requires certain behavior, when two files are 

associated with the same external file, that is not required by 
the Ada standard. 

r. CE3301A This test contains several calls to END_OF_LINE & 
END_OF_PAGE that have no parameter: these calls were intended 
to specify a file, not to refer to STANDARD_INPUT (lines 103, 
107, 118, 132, & 136) . 

s. CE3411B This test requires that a text file's column number be 

set to COUNT'LAST in order to checlc that LAYOUT_ERROR is raised 
by a subsequent PUT operation. But the former operation will 

generally raise an exception due to a laclc of available dislc 

space, and the test would thus encumber validation testing.

COMPILER AND LINKER OPTIONS 


References and page numbers in this appendix are consistent 
with compiler documentation and not with this report. 

In addition to the switches described in the sequel the 
following switches are available: 

-W +enable_traceback 

allow internal compiler errors to propagate all the way 
out. The default is to inhibit internal exceptions call 
chains from being displayed. 

-W -debug_info 

inhibits insertion of Ada symbolic debugger information 
into the working sublibrary. This will speed up 
compilation. The default is to insert all information 
into the working sublibrary. 

-W +link_target=bbn 

generates a Berkeley Unix style link script. The default 
is to generate a System V style link script. 






COMPILATION TOOLS 


2.1. The Ada Compiler (“ada”) 

The TeleGea2 Ada Compiler is invoked by the ada command. Unless you specify otherwise, 
the front end. middle pass, and code generator are e.\ecuted each time the compiler is invoked. 

Before you can compile, you must (1) make sure you have access to TeieGen2, (2) create a 
library die, and (3) create a sublibrary. These steps were explained in the Getting Started section 
of the Overview. We suggest you review that section, and then compile, link, and execute the 
sample program as indicated before you attempt to compile other programs. 

This section focuses specifically on command*level information relating to compilation, that 
is, on invoking the compiler and using the various options to control the compilation process. 
Details on the TeleGen2 compilation process and guidelines for using the compiler most 
eH'ectiveiy are in the Compiler chapter of the User Guide volume. (You might want to look at 
Figure 3-1 in that volume right now, to give you insight into the TeieGen2 compilation process 
and to see how the options mentioned in this Command Summary volume relate to the actual 
compilation process.) 

The syntax of the command to invoke the Ada compiler is: 


ada {<**eoxmnon^pcion’*>} {<option>} <mput_spec> 


where: 


<“common_option”> 

None or more of the following set of options that are com¬ 
mon to many TeleGen2 commands: 

-l(ibfiie or -t(empiib 
-V (space-size 
-v(erbose 

These options were discussed in Chapter 1. 

<option> 

None or more of the compiler-specific options discussed 
below. 

<inpuc^pec> 

The Ada source file(s) to be compiled. It may be: 

« One or more .-Vda source files, for example: 

/user/john/example 

Prog_A.text 
ciosrc/ caic_mem .ada 
caicio.ada myprog.ada 
".ada 

« .A. file containing names of files to be compiled. Such a 
file must have the extension •‘.ilf’. You can find de¬ 
tails for using input-list files in the User Guide portion 
of your TeleGen2 documentation set. 

> A combination of the above. 


Please note that the compiler defaults are set for your convenience. In most cases you will 
not need to use additional options: a simple '*ada <input_spec>’’ is sufficient. However, options

are included to provide added flexibility. You can. for example, have the compiler quickly check 
the source for syntax and semantic errors but not produce object code {-e(rrors_onjy) or you can 
compile, bind, and link an main program with a single compiler invocation (-m(ain). Other 
options are provided for other purposes. 

The options available with the ada command, and the relationships among them, are 
illustrated in the following figure. Remember that each of the options listed is identified by a 
dash followed by a single letter (e.g., “-e”). The parenthesis and the characters following the 
option are for descriptive purposes only; they are not part of the option.

sets the -k(eep option. This to make sure that the High Form, Low Form, and debugger 
information for secondary units are not deleted. 

To see if a unit has been compiled with the -d(ebug option, use the aU command with the 
-X(tended option. Debugger information exists for the unit if the “dbg_info’' attribute appears 
in the listing for that unit. The default situation is that no debugger information is produced. 

Performance note. While the compilation time overhead generated by the use of -d(ebug is 
minimal, retaining this optional information in the Ada library increases the space overhead. 

2.1.2. —E(rror-abort — Set an Error Count for Aborting Compilation. The compiler 
maintains separate counts of all syntactic errors, semantic errors, and warning messages detected 
by the &ont end during a compilation. 

A large number of errors generally indicates that errors in statements appearing earlier in 
the unit have ^^cascaded” through the rest of the code. A classic example is an error occurring in 
a statement that declares a type. This causes subsequent declarations that use the type to be in 
error, which further causes all statements using the declared objects to be in error. In such a 
situation, only the first error message is useful. Aborting the compilation at an early stage is 
therefore often to your advantage; the -E option allows you to do it. 

The format of the option is: 

-E <valne> 

where <vaJue> is the number of errors or warnings allowed. The default value is 999. The 
minimum value is 1. Caution: If you do not use the option, it is possible to have 999 
warning messages plus 999 syntax errors plus 999 semantic errors without aborting compilation, 
since each type of error is counted separately. 

2.1.3. -e(iTors_only - Check Source But Don’t Generate Code. This option instructs 
the compiler to perform syntactic and semantic analysis of the source program without 
generating Low Form and object code. That is. it calls the front end only, not the middle pass 
and code generator. (This means, of course, that only front end errors are detected and that only 
the High Form intermediates are generated.) This option is typically used during early code 
development where execution is not required and speed of compilation is important. 

Note: Although High Form intermediates are generated with the -e option, these intermediates 
are deleted at the end of compilation. This means that the library is not updated. 

The -« option cannot be used with -S(ource_asm, since the latter requires the generation of 
object code. If —e is not used (the default situation), the source is compiled to object code (if no 
errors are found). The —< option is also incompatible with -k(eep. -d(ebug, -0(ptimize, and 
other options that require processing beyond the front end phase of compilation. 

2.1.4. -i(iLhibit - Suppress Checks and Source Information. The —i(nhibit option 
allows you to suppress, within the generated object code, certain run-time checks, source line 
references, and subprogram name information. 

The Ada language requires a wide variety of run-time cheeks to ensure the validity of 
operations. For example, arithmetic overflow checks are required on all numeric operations, and 
range checks are required on all assignment statements that could result in an illegal value being 
assigned to a variable. While these checks are vital during development and are an important 
asset of the language, they introduce a substantial overhead. This overhead may be prohibitive 


2-6

24AUG89 




COMPILATION TOOLS 


in time-cricical applications. 

.AJthough the Ada language provides pragma Suppress to selectively suppress classes of 
checks, using the pragma requires you to modify the Ada source. The -i(nhibit option provides 
an alternative mechanism. 

The compiler by default stores source line and subprogram name information in the object 
code. This information is used to display a source level traceback when an unhandled exception 
propagates to the outer level of a program: it is particularly valuable during development, since it 
provides a direct indication of the source line at which the exception occurs and the subprogram 
calling chain that led to the line generating the exception. 

The inclusion of source line information in the object code, however, introduces an overhead 
of 6 bytes for each line of source that causes code to be generated. Thus, a 1000-line package 
may have up to 6000 bytes of source line information. For one compilation unit, the extra 
overhead (in bytes) for subprogram name information is the total length of all subprogram names 
m the unit (including middle pass-generated subprograms), plus the length of the compilation 
unit name. For space-critical applications, this extra space may be unacceptable; but it can be 
suppressed with the —i(nhibit option. When source line information is suppressed, the traceback 
indicates the offset of the object code at which the exception occurs instead of the source line 
number. When subprogram name information is suppressed, the traceback indicates the offsets of 
the subprogram calls in the calling chain instead of the subprogram names. (For more 
information on the traceback function, refer to the Programming Guide chapter in your 
Reference Information volume.) 

The format of the -t(nhibit option is: 

-i <siiboption>{<siiboption>} 

where <suboption> is one or more of the single-letter suboptions listed below. Combinations of 
suboptions are possible. When more than one suboption is used, the suboptions appear together 
with no separators. For example, “-1 Inc”. 


Ifline_info( | Suppress source line information in object code. 

aiame^foi 

Suppress subprogram name information in object 
code. 

eihecksj 

Suppress run-time checks — elaboration, overflow, 
storage access, discriminant, division, index, length, 
and range checks. 

aiilj 

Suppress source line information, subprogram name 
information, and run-time checks. In other words, a 
(^inhibit all) is equivalent to Inc.

2.1.3. -k(e«p - Retain Intermediate Forms. As a default, the compiler deletes the High 
Form and Low Form intermediate representations of ail compiled secondary units from the 
working subiibrary. Deletion of these intermediate forms can significantly decrease the size of 
subiibraries ~ typically 50% to 80% for multi-unit programs. On the other hand, some of the 
information within the intermediate forms may be required later. For example. High Form is 
required if the unit is to be referenced by the Ada Cross-Referencer (oir). In addition, 
information required by the debugger and the Global Optimizer must be saved if these utilities 
are used. For these reasons, the -If option is provided with the ada command. The —1: option: 

•• Must be used if the compiled unit is to be optimized later with aopt; otherwise, aopl 
issues an error message and the optimizer aborts. 

* Should be used if the unit is to be cross-referenced later; otherwise, an error message is 
issued when the .Ada Cross-Referencer attempts to cross-reference that unit. 

> Need not be used with —d(ebug, since —ib is set automatically whenever -d is used. 

To verify that a unit has been compiled with the -k(eep option (has not been “squeezed*’), 
use the aU command with the -X(tended option. A listing will be generated that shows whether 
the intermediate forms for the unit exist. A unit has been compiled with -lc(eep if the attributes 
high^orm and low^orm appear in the listing for that unit. 

2.1.6. -m(ain — Compile a Main Program. This option tells the compiler that the unit 
specified with the option is to be used as a main program. .After all files named in the input 
specification have been compiled, the compiler invokes the prelinker (binder) and the native 
linker by calling aid to bind and link the program with its extended family. An executable file 
named <unit> is left in the current directory. The linker may also be invoked directly by the 
user with the aid command. 

The format of the option is: 

—m <imit> 

where <unit> is the name of the main unit for the program. If the main unit has already been 
compiled, it does not have to be in the input file. However , the body of the main unit, if 
previously compiled, must be present in the current working sublibrary. 

Note: Options specific to the linker (invoked via aid) may be specified on the ada command line 
when the -m option Is used. With —m. the compiler will call aid when compilation is complete, 
passing to it aid-specific options specified with the ada command. For example... 

ada -m welcome —T 2 -o new sampie.ada 

...instructs the compiler to compile the .Ada source file, sampie.ada. which contains the main 
program unit Welcome. .After the file has been compiled, the compiler calls the linker, passing to 
it the -T and -o options with their respective arguments. The linker produces an executable 
version of the unit, placing it in file new as requested by the -o option. 

2.1.T. -0(ptizaize - Optimize Object Code. This option causes the compiler to invoke 
the global optimizer to optimize the Low Form generated by the middle pass for the unit being 
compiled. The code generator takes the optimized Low Form as input and produces more 
efficient object code. The format of this option is: 

-O <key>

COMPILATION TOOLS 


where <key> is at least one of the optimizer suboption keys discussed in the Global Optimizer 
chapter. Please refer to that chapter for all information regarding the use of the optimizer. The 
chapter discusses using the optimizer as a standalone tool for collections of compiled but 
unoptimized units and using the -0(ptimize option with the a.da command. The latter topic 
includes a definition of the - 0 (ptimize suboption key values plus a presentation of two ocher ada 
options (-G(raph and -I(nline_iist. not shown on the ada chart) that may be used in 
conjunction with the -0(ptiraize option. Note: We strongly recommend that you do not 
attempt to use the optimizer until the code being compiled has been fully debugged and tested. 

2.1.3. -s(oftware_float — Usa Software Floating-Poinc Support. This option may not 
be available with yoar TeleGen2 system; please consult the Overview portion to see if it is 
provided. The .A.da linker selects hardware floating-point support by default. If you do not have 
hardware floating point support or if you wish to generate code compatible with such machines, 
use the -s option. In addition : If you use the —s option, the library file you use for compilation 
must contain Che the name of the software floating point run-time sublibrary, 5 _rt.s« 6 . Refer to 
the Library Manager chapter in your User Guide volume for more information on the run-time 
sublibrary. 

2.1.9. —a(pdate_lib — Update the Working Sublibrary. The -u(pdate_lib option tells 
the compiler when to update the library. It is most useful for compiling multiple source flies. 
The format of the option is: 

-u <key> 

where <key> is either “s” (source) or “i” (invocation). 

1 tells the compiler to update the working sublibrary after all flies submitted in that 

invocation of ada have compiled successfully. If an error is encountered, the library is 
not updated, even for source flies that compile successfully. In addition, all remaining 
source flies will be compiled for syntactic and semantic errors only. Implications: ( 1 ) 
If an error exists in any source file you submit, the library will not be updated, even if 
all ocher flies are error free. (2) Compilation is faster, since the library is updated 
only once, at the end of compilation. 

s (This is the default; it is equivalent to not using the -u(pdate_Iib option at all.) “s’' 
tells the compiler to update the library after all units within a single source file 
compile successfully. If the compiler encounters an error in any unit within a source 
file, all changes to the working sublibrary for the erroneous unit and for all ocher units 
in the file are discarded. However, library updates for units in previous or remaining 
source files are unaffected. Implications: ( 1 ) You can submit flies containing possible 
errors and still have units in ocher flies compile successfully into the library. ( 2 ) 
Compilation is slightly slower, since the library is updated once for each file.

Tei«G«ii2 Conunand Summary for UNCC-Based Host Compilers 


Therefore: 

Use “u s” (or no -u(pdate option) when: 

You’re not sure all units will compile successfully. 

Compilation speed is not especially important. 

Use “u i” when: 

You are reasonably certain your files will compile successfully. 

Fast compilation is important. 

2.1.10. -x(eciition^rofile - Generate Profile Information. The -x(ecution_ 4 )rofile 
option uses the code generation phase of compilation to place special information in the generated 
code that can be used to obtain a “profile” of a program’s execution. This information is 
generated by a facility known as “the profiler.” Refer to your User Guide volume for information 
on bow to use the profiler to obtain execution timing and subprogram call information for a 
program. 

Important: If any code in a program has been compiled with the -x(ecution_profile option, 

that option must also be used with aid when the program is bound and linked. Otherwise, 
linking aborts with an error such as “Undefined RECOROSSCURRENT”. 

2.1.11. Listing Optioos. The listing options specify the content and format of listings 
generated by the compiler. Assembly code listings of the generated code can also be generated. 

2.1.11.1. —C(ontext — Include Source Lines Around the Error. When an error 
message is sent to stderr, it is helpful to include the lines of the source program that surround the 
line containing the error. These lines provide a context for the error in the source program and 
help to clarify the nature of the error. The — <7 option controls the number of source lines that 
surround the the error. 

The format of the option is: 

—C <vaiue> 

where < valuer is the number of source context lines output for each error. The default for 
<value> is 1. This parameter specifies the total number of lines output for each error (including 
the source line that contains the error). The first context line is the one immediately before the 
line in error other context lines are distributed before and after the line in error. Let’s say that

2.1.11.2. -L(ist — Generate a Source Listing. This option instructs the compiler to 
output a listing of the source being compiled, interspersed with error information (if any). The 
listing is output to <iile_ 3 pec>.l. where <iile_spec> is the name of the source hie (minus the 
e.xtension). If <iile_spec>.l already exists, it is overwritten. 

if input to the ada command is an input-list Sle (<fiie^pec>.ilf), a separate listing file is 
generated for each source file listed in the input file. Each resulting listing file has the same name 
as the parent file, except that the extension “.1’* is appended. Errors are interspersed with the 
listing. If you do not use -L (the default situation), errors are sent to stdout only; no Ibting is 
produced. - L is incompatible with -F.

2.1.11.3. -F(ile_only_err3 - Put Only Errors in Listing File. This option is used to 
produce a listing containing only the errors generated during compilation; source is not included. 
The output is sent to <file_spec>.l, -F is incompatible with -L. 

2.1.11.4. -S(ource_asm — Generate a Source/Assembly Listing. This option instructs 
the compiler to generate an assembly listing and send it to a file named <unit>.<ext>, where 
<unit> is the name of the unit in the user-supplied source hie and <ext> is the Sle extension (it 
may be or something else, depending on your configuration). The listing consists of assembly 
code intermixed with source code as comments. If input to the ada command is an input-list file 
(<file-spec>.ilf), a separate assembly listing file is generated for each unit contained in each 
source file listed in the input file. If —5 is not used (the default situation), an assembly listing is 
not generated.

2.2. The Ada Linker (“aid”) 

The TeleGen2 Ada Compiler produces object code from Ada source code. The TeleGen2 
Ada Linker takes the object (of a main program) that is produced by the compiler and produces a 
UNIX executable module. The TeleGen2 .\da Linker will be called “the linker” in the remainder 
of this manual. 

To produce executable code, the linker (1) generates elaboration code and a link script (this 
is called “binding” or “prelinking”) then (2) calls the UNIX link editor (Id) to complete the 
linking process. 

The linker is invoked with the aid command; it can also be invoked with the -m(ain option 
of the ada command. In the latter case the compiler passes appropriate options to the linker, to 
direct its operation. 

In the simplest case, the aid command takes one argument — the name of the main unit of 
the Ada program stricture that is to be linked — and produces one output file — the executable 
file produced by the linking process. The executable file is placed in the directory where aid was 
executed, under the name of the main unit used as the argument to aid. For example, the 
command 

aid ToaiTi 

links the object modules of all the units in the extended family of the unit \Iain. The name of 
the resulting executable file will simply be “main”. Important: When using the aid command, 
the body of the main unit to be prelinked must be in the working sublibrary. 

The general syntax of the aid command is: 


aid {<“commou_opeion”>} {<option>} 


where; 


<“common_option”> 

None or more of the following set of options that are 
common to many TeieGen2 commands: 

-I(ibfile or -t(emplifa 
- V(space-.size 
-v(erbose 

These options were discussed in Chapter 1. 

< option > 

None or more of the options discussed in the following 
sections. 

<unit; 

The name of the main unit of the .\da program to be 
linked. 


The options available with the aid command and the relationships among them are illustrated 
below.

2.2.1. —b(ind_ 0 i:ily — Produce Elaboration Code Only. To provide you with more 
control over the linking process, the —b option causes the linker to abort after it has created .the 
elaboration code and the linking order, but before invoking the UNIX link editor. This option 
allows you to edit the link order for special applications and then invoke the link editor directly. 
The link order is contained in an executable script that invokes the link editor with the 
appropriate options and arguments. The name of the script produced is <unit>.lnk, which is 
placed in your working directory. To complete the link process, enter '*<unit>.lnk’\ 

The name of the hie containing the elaboration code is <unit>.obm. which is placed in the 
object directory of the working sublibrary. 

For System V versions of UNIX, the file names generated as a result of linking are created 
by appending the 3-letter extension to the unit name and truncating the result to 14 characters. 

2.2.2. -o(utput - Name the Output File. This option allows you to specify the name of 
the output file produced by the linker. For example, the command... 

aid >0 yorkshire main 

...causes the linker to put the executable module in the file yorkshire.

2.2.3. - P(a!i9 ^Options - Paq* Options to the Linker. This option allows you to pass a 

string of option.s 'lir^rtly to the iJNiX link editor. For exampie. the command 

aid -P ’-t -r’’ main 

adds the string “-t -r" to the options of the link editor when it is invoked. The options must be 
quoted (double or single quotes). 

2.2.<i. -p( ass-objects - Pass Arguments to the Linker. This option allows you to pass 
a string of arguments directly to the UNIX link editor. For exampie, the command 

aid -p 'roeine.o /Ttsr/Ub/Iibm.a' main 

causes the link editor to link the object file co.sine.o (which it expects to find in the current 
working directory), and to search the library /usr Itb'libm.a for unresolved symbol references. 
(The location of the libm.a library may be different on your system.) Remember that the link 
editor searches a library exactly once at the point it is encountered in the argument list, so 
references to routines in libraries must occur b«/ora the library is searched. That is. fiJes that 
include references to library routines must appear before the corresponding libraries in the 
argument list. Objects and archives added with the —p option will appear in the linking order 
after Ada object modules and run-time support libraries, but before the standard C library 
(; lib/libc.a). This library is always the last element of the linking order. 

You can also use the -p option to specify the link editor’s -I option, which causes the link 
•ditor to search libraries whose names have the form “/bb/libname.a” or “/usr/lib/Iibname-a”. 
For example, the command 

aid -p '-beys’ 

causes the link editor to search the directories /lib and /'rur/lib (in that order) for file libxyz.a. 

2.2.3. -S(“a8ra_li8tiiig” - Produce an Assembly Listing. The -5 option is used to 
output an assembly listing from the elaboration process. The output is put in a fiie. 
':file>.obm.3, where <file> is the name of the main unit being linked. (The file extension may be 
different on your system.) 

2.2.0. -s(oftTware_aoat - Use Software Floating-Point Support. This option may not 
be available on your TeleGenS system. Please consult the Overvsevj portion of this volume to see if 
it IS provided. The Ada linker currently selects hardware fioacing-point support by default. This 
default situation is provided for users of systems with an arithmetic coprocessor. If you do not 
have hardware floating point support or if you wish to generate code compatible with such 
machines, use the -s option. In addition: if you use the -s option, the library file you use for 
compiling and linking must contain the name of the software fioating point run-time subilbrary. 
s^t.sub. Refer to the Library .Vlanager chapter in your User Guide volume for more information 
on the run-time sublibrary. 

2.2.7. -T(raceback - Set Levels for Tracing Exceptions. When a run-time exception 
occurs (and is not handled by an exception handler), the name and line number of the unit where 
the exceotion occurred is displayed along with a recursive history of the units which called that 
unit. (See the “Exception Handling” section in the Programming Guide chapter of your 
Reference Information volume for a more complete explanation of exception reports.) The —T 
oDiion allows you to set the number of levels in this recursive history. For example, the

3-lS 






TeieGen2 Conunaad Stunmary for UNCC-Baaed Boat Compders 


command 

aid —T 3 main 

specifies that traceback histories will be three levels deep. The default value for this option is 13. 

When an exception occurs, the run-time support system stores the history in a preallocated 
block of memory. Since the size of this block Is determined by the ~T option, setting this value 
to a large number can introduce objectionable overhead in deeply nested, time-critical code. You 
may wish to make this value smaller for well-tested programs. 

2.2.8. -x(eciition_profile - Bind and Link for Profiling. This option is used for units 
that have been compiled with the —z option. Use of -z with ada causes the code generator to 
include, in the object, special code that will later be used to provide a prohle of the program’s 
execution. 

If -z is used with ado, it must be used with aid as well. The -z option of old instructs the 
linker to link in the profiling run-time support routines and generate a subprogram dictionary, 
profile.die^ for the program. The dictionary is a text file containing the names and addresses of 
all subprograms in the program. The dictionary can be used to produce a listing showing how 
the program executes. 

Refer to the Ada Profiler chapter in your User Guide volume for a full discussion of the 
profiler. 


2.2.9. Tasking Options. The following aid options are binding options used for task 
execution. They are therefore useful only for linking programs that contain tasking code. 

2.2.9.1. -D(€lay_NonPre«mpt — Specify Non-Preemptive Delay. By default, the 
TeieCen2 run-time is set for preemptive delay handling. That is, an active task is preempted if 
another task is waiting that has a priority equal to or greater than that of the active task. 

The ~D option allows you to specify nor>.preemptive delay handling. With non-preemptive 
delay, a task is scheduled only when a synchronization point is reached. -0(eiay-NonPreempt is 
incompatible with the -w option (see below). 

2.2.9.2. — w(**timesllce” Limit Task Execution Time. The ~w option allows you to 
define the maximum time a task may execute before it is rescheduled. The format of the option 
is: 


—w <TaJae> 

where <vaiue> is the maximum time the task is to execute, in milliseconds, before a task switch 
occurs between it and a task having the same or higher priority. The default value is 0 (no 
timeslice). If you choose a value greater than 0. it must be at least as great as the clock interval 
time. 

Since rescheduling of tasks is incompatible with interrupt-scheduling, -tv is incompatible 
with -D(elay_J^onPreempt (see above). 

2.2.9.3. -X(ception_show — Report Unhandled Exceptions. By default, unhandled 
exceptions that occur in tasks are not reported: instead, the task terminates silently. The -X 
option allows you to specify that such exceptions are to be reported. The output is similar to 
that displayed when an unhandled exception occurs in a main program.

2.2.9.4. — Y and —y - Alter Stack Size. In the absence of a representation specification for 
task storage_3ize, the run time will allocate 3192 bytes of storage for each executing task. You 
can change the amount of space allocated for tasking by using the - Y and -y options. 

—Y specifies the size of the basic task stack. The format of the option is: 

—Y <valiie> 

where <value> is the size of the task stack in 32-bit (]ong_integer) bytes. The default is 3192. 

-y specifies the stack-guard size. The stack-guard space is the amount of additional space 
allocated per task to accommodate interrupts and exception-handling operations. The format of 
the option is: 

-y <'7aliie> 

where <value> is the size of the stack-guard size In 16-bit (natural) bytes. The value given must 
be greater than the task-stack size. The default is 1052 bytes; this is the amount allocated unless 
otherwise specified. 

A representation specification for task storage size overrides a value supplied with either 
option.
