Abstract: 

This final report describes the progress that has been made with the different tasks of this 
project. The highlights are that most of the tasks planned for this project have been carried out 
and completed successfully with some delay owing to some technical problems that could not 
be avoided. Those tasks concerned the development of OOP codes using C++ based on the 
Method of Moments for microwave interconnections analysis considering different 
geometrical configurations (i.e. multiconductor and multilayer structures) and physical 
parameters (e.g. conductor loss) using the Method of Moments and the Method of Lines. 
Furthermore, a novel approach based on the FDTD method has been developed for the global 
modeling of RF and microwave circuits and antennas which couples the EM and the active 
devices equivalent circuits’ models. Also, a GUI has been developed using C++ for the 
FDTD code together with a Web based RF and Microwave Intercommunions Simulator using 
JavaScript Language in the framework of two MSc theses. 

Seven graduate students have contributed to the development of all these tasks. Five of them 
obtained their Ph D degree and three of them already work as Assistant Professors in different 
Moroccan universities. Two MS students have also contributed to the development of those 
tasks and are now pursuing towards the Ph D degree. Some results obtained in the framework 
of this project have been published in international specialized journals, conferences and 
symposia.

1. Progress 

l.A Overview 

The format of this report is to discuss the progress related to the tasks presented in the original 
proposal. The main tasks run for the duration of the project. 

1,B Progress by Task 

The four tasks have the aim of creating a database of elements for a general purpose mixed¬ 
mode circuit simulator. 

Task 1 Two Dimensional Structure Modeling 
Task lA 

Develop a Freeda model for a microstrip line offinite uniform cross-section. The model will 
consider a ground plane, finite conductor and substrate loss, and finite thickness isotropic 
dielectric on which a microstrip line of finite thickness resides. Frequency dependent effects 
(such as due to the skin effect) will be included accurately. The input to the model will be the 
physical parameters, the material parameters, frequency and length of line. This first model 
may initially use FORTRAN routines. Validation will be undertaken by comparing with the 
results of other computer programs. The Method of Lines will be used. 

TASK COMPLETED 

Task IB 


3 



Study the types of two dimensional structures to be found in planar environments. Develop a 
class structure that facilitates the reuse of structure characterizations. Working with the 
international community develop concepts for representing two dimensional structures that 
are compatible with layout programs (generally these are point based so that a three 
dimensional object is specified as being at a point with dimensions referenced to that point 
rather than having reference planes as with early microwave CAE models of these structures. 
TASK COMPLETED 


Task 1C 

Prepare a catalogue of the types of interconnects to be modeled. Develop the hierarchy of 
models with the view of establishing C++ class structures. Consider the implications of 
handling arbitrary cross-section to accommodate, for example, the effects of etching on 
interconnects resulting in nonrectangular cross-sections. 

TASK COMPLETED 


Task ID 

Design of a C++ class (interconnectsD class) for quasi-planar interconnect structures. 
Given frequency (which can vary) and material and physical parameters, the class will 
calculate y parameters. (This task may be modified by the results of Task 1C.) 

TASK COMPLETED 

Task IE 

Design of a C++ class (interconnectlD class) for quasi-planar interconnect structures of 
uniform cross-section. Given frequency (which can vary) and material and physical 
parameters other than length the class will calculate propagation constant and characteristic 
impedance parameters or other length independent parameters deemed more appropriate. 
Update design of interconnects D class. (This task may be modified by the results of Task 1C.) 
TASK COMPLETED 

Task IF 

Implement interconnectsD class and interconnectlD class. (This task may be modified by the 
results of Task 1C.) 

TASK COMPLETED 

Task IG 

Implement mierostrip model deseribed in task lA using objeet oriented paradigm (using 
interconnectsD and interconnect!D classes). 

TASK COMPLETED 

Task IH 

Convert the mierostrip model of Task IG to use the Method of Moments. 

TASK COMPLETED 


4 



Task II 

Implement C++ asymmetric lossy stripline model. The Method of Moments will be used. 

TASK COMPLETED 

Task 1J 

Implement C++ lossy coplanar waveguide model. The Method of Moments will be used. 

TASK COMPLETED 

Task IK 

Implement C++ lossy coplanar strip model. The Method of Moments will be used. 

TASK COMPLETED 


Task IL 

Implement multilayer lossy strip model accommodating multiple lines, multiple dielectric 
layers of varying cross-section and permittivity, and one or two ground planes. The Method of 
Moments will be used. 

TASK COMPLETED 

Task IM 

Develop LaTeX documentation for the models developed in this task. 

Documentation has been developed for completed tasks 

Task 2 Three Dimensional Multilayer Static Green’s Function 

2A The Study of the program UIUC2D has been performed. Furthermore, the closed-form 
Green’s function formulation using the method of moments proposed by Prof. Andreas 
Cangellaris, from Illinois University, has been studied. Furthermore, a 3-D extension of this 
technique is being developed. 

2B Extend UIUC2D to the 3D static case. 

2C Based on task 2B, develop a report on using the 3D closed form Green's function to 
develop lumped circuit models for transmission line discontinuities. 

TASK COMPLETED 


Task 3 Three Dimensional Structure Modeling 

3A Study the types of three dimensional structures to be found in planar environments. 
Develop a class structure that facilitates the reuse of structure characterizations. Working with 
the international community develop concepts for representing three dimensional structures 
that are compatible with layout programs (generally these are point based so that a three 
dimensional object is specified as being at a point with dimensions referenced to that point 
rather than having reference planes as with early microwave CAE models of these structures). 
TASK COMPLETED 

3B Design appropriate class structures for three dimensional interconnects. Calculate a y 
parameter matrix. 

3C Implement class structures for three dimensional interconnects. 

3D Develop a via model. Use the method of moments. 


5 



3E Develop a spiral induetor model. Use the method of moments. Validate using 
eommereial tools by eonsidering extremes (e.g. zero thiekness). 

TASK COMPLETED 

3F Develop a model of erossover of two lines. 

TASK COMPLETED 

Task 4 Device Field Interaction 

Task 4A: We have performed a eomparison between the FDTD and TFM methods in terms 
of theoretieal formulation, numerieal performanees and coverage in the specialized literature. 

TASK COMPLETED 

Task 4B: We have developed a novel formulation based on the nonlinear lumped network 
FDTD method for the analysis of the electromagnetic waves interaction with active devices. 
A Fortran code has been developed from the proposed formulation and is being tested. 

We have also studied the circuit model proposed by Prof Samir El-Ghazaly, from Arizona 
State University, for the global modeling of microwave circuits involving passive and active 
elements from a theoretical point of view. A Fortran code has been developed based on this 
theory and has been successfully tested. 

TASK COMPLETED 

Task 4C: Design a C++ class structure for semiconductor device-circuit interaction. 

TASK COMPLETED 

Task 4D: Implement the class structure in Task 3C. 

TASK COMPLETED 


Task 4E: Implement the model for this structure in a general purpose circuit simulator.
