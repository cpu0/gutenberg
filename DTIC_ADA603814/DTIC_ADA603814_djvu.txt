13. SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES 

14. ABSTRACT 

This technical note provides a brief description of a Java library for Arabic natural language processing (NLP) containing code 
for training and applying the Arabic NLP system described in the paper "A Cross-Task Flexible Transition Model for Arabic 
Tokenization, Affix Detection, Affix Labeling, POS Tagging, and Dependency Parsing" by Stephen Tratz presented at the 
Statistical Parsing of Morphologically Rich Languages (SPMRL) workshop held in Seattle in conjunction with the Empirical 
Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) conference of October 2013. The system is capable of clitic separation, 
inflectional affix identification and labeling, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing for Arabic. The code, which is 
extended from previously released graduate student code, also supports English part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, 
and semantic disambiguation tasks. In general, the code library is expected to be of most value to natural language processing 
researchers.

1. Introduction 


This technical note provides a brief description of a Java library for Arabic (and also English) 
natural language processing (NLP), containing code for training and applying the Arabic NLP 
system described in Stephen Tratz’s 2013 paper “A Cross-Task Llexible Transition Model for 
Arabic Tokenization, Affix Detection, Affix Labeling, POS Tagging, and Dependency Parsing” in 
the 2013 Statistical Parsing of Morphologically Rich Languages (SPMRL) workshop (see section 
9 for all relevant publications). 

The system is capable of clitic separation, inflectional affix identification and labeling, 
part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing for Arabic. Lor more information on these 
topics and the overall system, the reader is referred to the SPMRL 2013 publication. 

Lor historical reasons (section 7), the library also includes components for English part-of-speech 
tagging, dependency parsing, preposition sense disambiguation, noun compound interpretation, 
and possessives interpretation. Much of the code is relevant to general purpose NLP applications 
(e.g., the WordNet interface) and is not specific to either Arabic or English. 


2. File Overview 


The following is a short description of the top level files and directories. 

build/ - directory with Ant build scripts for running dependency converters, training the various 
subsystems, and running some experiments 

conf/ - directory with files related to Arabic constituent-to-dependency conversion as well as 
the English semantic annotation modules 
data/ - directory with a variety of data used by different submodules 
docs/ - directory with additional documentation 
examples/ - a directory with some example input and output files 
jar/ - a directory with a precompiled copy of this code 
lib/ - a directory for any required .jar files 

scripts/ - a directory with some scripts for applying trained models to new data 
src/ - the source code

3. Code Compilation 


The code is typically compiled using Apache Ant, freely available software typically used for 
building software projects. To download, or for more information, see http://ant.apache.org/. 

A variety of ant build XME files are contained in the build subdirectory. To create a jar file 
containing the compiled code, switch to INSTAEEATION_DIR/build and type “ant -f 
build_common.xml makeJar”. 


4. Training Instructions 


Eor the Arabic system, see doc/AR_TRAINING_INSTRUCTIONS. 
Eor the English system, see doc/EN_TRAINING_INSTRUCTIONS . 


5. Applying the System to New Examples 


Example scripts for applying a trained model to new data are provided under the scripts 
subdirectory. Short example texts are provided in the examples subdirectory.

A copy of WordNet 3.0 (http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/), a freely available lexical

A modified version of the pennconverter, freely available constituent-to-dependency conversion 
software described by Richard Johansson and Pierre Nugues in their paper “Extended 
Constituent-to-dependency Conversion for English,” in the proceedings of the 2007 Nordic 
Conference on Computational Einguistics, is included with this project. Its license is provided in 
the ‘doc/PENNCONVERTER_EICENSE’ file. 


7. History 


This project is derived from a collection of code written as part of my graduate student/thesis 
work at USC/ISI that was publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license in late 2011 at 
http://www.isi.edu/publications/licensed-sw/fanseparser/index.html. 

In mid-2012, a project derived from the original University of Southern California/Information 
Sciences Institute version of the software was released at http://sourceforge.net/project s/miacp/. 
This newer version used a slightly different English dependency scheme and contained a variety 
of improvements. However, the PropBank-style SRE module was not maintained. 

This current project was derived from the http://sourceforge.net/projects/miacp/release by NEP 
researchers at the U.S. Army Research Eaboratory. A significant portion of the code has been 
replaced with newer code, deleted, or otherwise revised. The focus of this effort was to create the 
system described in the SPMRE 2013 paper mentioned in section 9. However, the English POS 


3 






tagger, parser, preposition sense disambiguator, noun eompound relation disambiguator, and 
possessive relation disambiguator are still funetional. (The English eomponents may be slightly 
slower and slightly less aeeurate than those in the http://soureeforge.net/projeets/miaep/release.) 


8. Important Note 


This release eontains a variety of bug fixes and other generally small ehanges that have been made 
sinee the SPMRL 2013 paper publieation and, as sueh, results will not be identieal—in general, 
the results will be insignifieantly better, but there may be some eases where performanee is worse.
