HP 3000 Manuals 



When the HP 3000 System is released in June, you will be receiving a 
great many manuals in a short space of time. I thought it would be a 
good idea to warn you of the deluge that is approaching and to give 
you some information about the manuals so that you can answer questions 
from customers and field personnel. 

I have attached a list of 3000 manuals with a short explanation of each 
one. This list, together with a chart of 3000 manuals, appears in 
Appendix C of the General Information Manual. 

The manuals marked "NEW" have been rewritten specifically for the 
Series II. One rather radical change is that the MPE operating system 
documentation has been broken down into several manuals. You will find 
that most customers will only need the Commands Reference Manual, which 
gives all operating system commands. The other MPE manuals go into 
more depth on the operating system giving information on segmenting, 
procedures, etc. 

I am also attaching a list of hardware manuals — these manuals are for 
the use of customer engineers. Only those manuals describing how to 
operate the line printer, etc. , will be useful to a customer. 

As you know manuals can be ordered on an IOS form. Please tell customers 
who wish to order by direct mail that they must give a part no. and 
enclose a check. 



One new feature with the Series II is that you can order complete sets 
of manuals by quoting the product number and any options. The set of 
manuals which is available as a product is attached. 

I hope this information will be helpful to you. If you need any more 
help just give me a call at General Systems Division, extension 2736.
