Abstract 


Medical simulation models such as NHRC’s Tactical Medical Logistics (TML+) planning tool stochastically represent 
the mortality of casualties with life-threatening injuries at various time points in the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) 
network flow. This paper describes how NHRC is seeking to determine a mathematical (probabilistic) representation 
of a conditional survival function that is reasonable in the context of other, rather simple, stochastic models being 
used in TML+. The paper describes NHRC’s overall research approach to determine an acceptable TML+ model for 
the mortality function, describes subject matter expert (SME) opinion results being used as the basis for an interim 
descriptive model using a biomedical sciences probability model (Weibull), and gives the future plans to capture more 
quantitative mortality and treatment data from the Navy-Marine Corps Combat Trauma Registry and other sources to 
use in investigating the applicability of a full range of biomedical sciences probability models via inferential methods.

Introduction 


TML+ is a C++ open-architecture software program designed for Navy and Marine Corp medical planners as a 
simulation tool that models the flow of patients from the point of injury (POI) through more definitive care; more 
generally, it is an operations research tool that supports systems analysis, risk assessment, and field medical 
services planning [8]. Figure 1 is the network view of an illustrative medical treatment facility (MTF) consisting of a 1 st 
Responder, a Battalion Aid Station (BAS) and a Casualty Receiving and Treatment Ship (CRTS) connected by 
transportation assets. The figure also shows our assumption about how improving medical capability in the MTF 
stream mitigates the death rate across time. 



Notional Path for Improving 
Capability in the MTF Network 



NS(t) plots provide the basis for determining 
the conditional probability of survival for each 
new MTF the casualty enters 


Figure 1 - Illustrative MTF network and its associated improving medical interventions. 


The patient flow process can be viewed as a network of stochastic queuing processes, as Figure 2 shows. These 
processes generally involve random outcomes associated with patient arrivals, injury conditions, mortality events, 
treatment times and transportation loading/timing events. 

As mortality modeling is the subject of this paper, a brief introduction to how TML+ simulates these events is given 
next; the TML+ methodology manual describes the entire process [8].

Figure 2 - TML+ as a network of stochastic queues. 


TML+ models mortality as killed in action, died of wounds due to complications (DOC), and died of wounds (DOW) 
due to a delay in treatment (the latter two events are depicted in Figure 2). Generally, the Bernoulli random variable 
[9] as shown on the left side of Figure 3 is used to simulate a mortality event for all three categories. For the KIA and 
DOC events, the probabilities used in the Bernoulli simulation are static and do not vary over time. The KIA events 
are simulated from a constant probability that is used for each newly generated casualty. 


The DOC events are simulated from a set of probabilities that depend on the patient condition (PC) and the level of 
care (LOC) functional area, but are not time dependent. The DOC event is simulated after each functional area, 
given disposition probabilities contained in the Estimating Supplies Program (ESP) [8] task sequence profile for the 
associated patient condition.

In simulating the DOW events, the right side of Figure 3 shows how TML+ models the degradation in survival 
probability (1-probability (DOW)) for a delay in treatment, and the improvement in survival chances for successive 
and more capable medical interventions in the treatment stream. It is emphasized that these hypothetical curves, 
when evaluated at any time T, give the probability of survival past that time, and are conditional on the casualty 
surviving to have entered the associated LOC. 


For example, if the time simulated to receive treatment at the 1 st Responder LOC is time tl, the model uses a 
probability of approximately 0.60 (from the figure) in a Bernoulli draw to determine if the casualty survives past this 
time or not. On the graph for “No Treatment”, tl is labeled a “DOW Check Point”. For DOW testing, no treatment is 
assumed to occur before the 1 st Responder LOC and all casualties with a life-threatening condition degrade from the 
time-of-injury on the “No Trtmt” curve applicable to their PC. If the casualty does not survive, the casualty is labeled a 
DOW and is dropped from the simulation; if the patient survives, he enters treatment at the 1 st Responder (i.e., is 
alive with probability 1.0 at tl) and is now assumed to receive continuous treatment there with a different set of 
conditional probabilities, determined by the curve labeled “1 st R Trtmt” in the graph. As the patient progresses 
through the MTF network, simulation of the DOW (probability of survival) event is repeated until the patient no longer 
survives, is returned-to-duty or is evacuated out of theater. 


The subject of this paper is to describe how NHRC is seeking to determine a mathematical (probabilistic) 
representation of that conditional survival function in Figure 3 which is reasonable in the context of the other, rather 
simple, stochastic models being used in TML+. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: section two 
describes NHRC’s overall research approach to determine an acceptable TML+ model for the mortality function, 
section three describes subject matter expert (SME) opinion results being used as the basis for an interim model, 
section four describes how a biomedical sciences probability model (Weibull) is being used with the SME results in an 
initial implementation, and section five gives the future plans to capture more quantitative mortality and treatment 
data from the Navy-Marine Corps Combat Trauma Registry [3] and other sources to use in investigating the 
applicability of a full range of biomedical sciences probability models. 


Research Approach 


NHRC’s research approach to determining a time-based mortality function for delays in treatment is shown in Figure 
4. For a sense of perspective, the far left of the figure shows how early modeling of the mortality function was simply 
a constant value applied to individual PCs and functional areas, as in the DOC simulation previously described. 
Bellamy’s work [1] illuminated the need for a time-based representation (his “golden-hour”) and a study by Hassell, et. 
al., [6] shows an intuitive, so-called saw-tooth model that was first implemented in an earlier version of TML+. The 
remaining blocks show NHRC initiatives to derive a stochastic model to embed in TML+ based on expert opinion and 
actual treatment/mortality data.

Figure 4 - Evolution of NHRC’s research approach to determining treatment delay mortality function. 
Timeline — early work through present implementation. 


Several efforts to collect applicable expert opinion results on mortality have been conducted by NHRC. In 2002 and 
2003, a group of 1 st responders at Camp Lejeune and a group of civilian paramedics in Northern Virginia were polled 
on a select group of urban patient injury codes in order to help perfect a questionnaire approach and gain insight into 
the nature of the probability of survival function for delays in providing first treatment to a casualty. In November 
2003, a group of military medical providers who were experienced in MTF network care for combat casualties (many 
had been deployed with Operation Iraqi Freedom) participated in an effort to collect opinions on treatment effects 
versus delays that might be experienced for the entire theater casualty stream. This effort will be presented in the 
next section, as these results are the descriptive basis for our initial stochastic algorithm for the DOW function in 
TML+. 


The last block in Figure 4 shows the overall research goal, that of forming a stochastic model that is statistically 
reasonable in the context of actual treatment and mortality data. NHRC is developing the Navy-Marine Corps 
Combat Trauma Registry that will allow data to be analyzed on all combat casualties at any point in the casualty flow. 
Mortality data from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology are also expected to be available for analysis. It is hoped 
that future efforts to collect real-time mortality and treatment data on the battlefield will take advantage of source data 
automation (SDA) techniques such as “pervasive computing”. 


Complementing the SME opinion results which are being used to identify reasonable mortality models, the use of 
actual treatment/mortality data from the Navy-Marine Corps Combat Trauma Registry and other sources will permit 
NHRC to conduct a more rigorous inferential analysis. The overall objective of the latter two blocks in the figure is to

leverage the analysis of lifetime data via stochastic modeling that has been conducted over many years in the 
biomedical sciences discipline [2, 4, 5, 9]. An introduction to a few of the applicable functions and to one of the 
stochastic models is provided next. 


Various functions describing mortality/survivabil ity Example Analy tics 


•Unconditional failure rate at time t 

- Called probability density function f(t;a,b,...) with 
parameters “a,b,...” (sometimes called death density 
function) 

- Probability of failure during (t, t+At)« f(t)*At 

•Probability of survival beyond time t 

- Called reliability or survival function (R(t) or S(t)) 

- Pr(T > t) =J"f(x) dx = S(t) 

•Conditional failure rate at time t 

- Called hazard rate, intensity rate, force of 
mortality, or instantaneous failure rate 

- Defined by l(t) = f(t)/S(t) 

- Can be an increasing or 
decreasing function (or, in case of the 
exponential model, can be constant) 

- Probability of failure during (t, t+At) given alive at t 
« h(t)*At 

•Various distributions have characteristics that can be 
exploited with nonparametric methods 

- eg, Actuarial life tables 


Weibull model: 

•f(t) = (b/a)*[(t/a) A (b-1)]* 
exp[-(t/a) A b], a>0, b>0, t>0 

•S(t) = exp[-(t/a) A b] 

•h(t) = (b/a)*(t/a) A (b-1)

Figure 5 - Tentative probability models and functions from the Biomedical Sciences. 


Figure 5 shows the functions that have proven to be effective in describing human lifetimes in the biomedical 
sciences field. These results have been shown to apply to the effects of treating cancer patients and other life- 
threatening illnesses where a medical treatment intervened (or stages of treatment); we acknowledge that these 
types of medical conditions are not like combat injuries, but it is expected that the stochastic lifetime properties might 
be similar enough to consider the biomedical sciences models as tentative descriptive candidates. On the left of the 
figure we show the probability density function of lifetimes with parameters {a, b,...}, the survival function for the 
probability of survival past time “t”, and the conditional failure rate or force of mortality function at time T. Various 
probability density functions that have been shown to apply in biomedical sciences are the gamma, Weibull and 
Gompertz models. The three functions for the Weibull distribution are shown on the right of the figure, along with the 
graph of its survival function. The 1 st Responder results and the SME MD panel results, to be presented later, have 
this same general shape. 


In an initial attempt to describe the SME MD panel opinion results, we will use the Weibull model until more 
quantitative data are available for consideration via the Navy-Marine Corps Combat Trauma Registry and other 
sources. The next section describes the SME medical provider panel results.

Military Medical Provider SME Panel as an Interim Source of Mortality 
Estimates 


In this section, we will give an overview of the methods used to collect opinion results from a group of military medical 
providers who convened at NHRC in November 2003. We will also summarize these results. 


Figure 6 shows that 12 medical providers (the SME panel, the composition of which appears in Appendix A) were 
asked to collect mortality estimates, given selected life-threatening PCs with initial signs and symptoms, at given 
LOCs, and with specified delays in treatment. The panel was given an evacuation scenario involving a hypothetical 
group of 100 casualties at an initial Point of Injury (with given PCs, signs, and symptoms) for which they were to 
estimate the number of survivors as time elapsed. The SMEs completed data arrays, such as the ones shown, using 
wireless personal data assistants (PDAs) and instant polling software. (An interesting article about “human behavior 
and how we decide what’s risky” \ coupled with our intuition that this metric would be less ambiguous than a 
probability of surviving quantity, was our rationale for polling the panel on “number surviving”). Example data results 
will be given next.

For the effects of no treatment for a particular PC, each provider estimated how many of the 100 casualties would still 
be alive at 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hr, ..., 12 hrs prior to receiving any attention by a 1 st Responder (sample inputs 
are shown in blue in the bottom left array). Similarly, the right most array shows how their responses were collected

for various delays in starting 1 st Responder treatment (inputs in blue; the diagonal entries were transferred from the 
first array). 


To illustrate the data, the responses for a 1 hour delay indicate that an SME estimated that if continuous treatment 
did not start until 1 hour after wounding, 50 casualties would have survived to that time, and 40 would be surviving at 
3 hours, versus 16, if there had been no intervening treatment for 3 hours. The graph shows a typical plot that 
resulted when all 12 SME responses were combined (in a manner to be explained later). In TML+ we need to 
describe the totality of points that might result, given various combinations of simulated treatment delays at the 1 st 
Responder and subsequent arrival times at the next LOC (here, a BAS). We call this area the 1 st Responder 
treatment effect feasible region; it includes treatment time at the 1 st Responder and the time associated with care 
given by the en-route-care system (ERCS) before the patient enters treatment at the BAS. An ensemble of delays 
and treatment times were presented to the SMEs for each PC, allowing for an estimate of the Number Surviving 
response for any point in the feasible region. 


As given in Figure 6, eight PCs were used to solicit responses from the SME panel, and for each of the indicated 
scenarios. The matrix shows a brief description of each PC; initial vital signs and symptoms were also given to the 
panel. The three highlighted PCs are ones that will be used to illustrate the overall nature of the responses in the 
material to follow. 



Figure 7 - Sample results. 


As an introductory plot displaying the nature of the responses, Figure 7 shows the estimated results for PC087 
(severe thorax wound, open chest injury with rib fractures) for the 1 st Responder’s treatment effect, coupled with the 
effects of STP and BAS alternatives after the 1 st Responder. The treatment delay for the 1 st Responder is taken to be 
10 minutes; for the alternatives, we assumed the casualty entered treatment at either the STP or BAS 30 minutes 


11 





























after injury. This plot illustrates the nature of increasing medical care at successive levels in the MTF network, and 
also shows that, of the two destinations to which to evacuate from the 1 st Responder, the STP is more effective than 
the BAS for this PC. 

The next section shows some of the individual responses and how we aggregate the results to more easily describe 
some initial notions about the stochastic nature of the mortality function being sought for TML+. (Again, our long term 
goal is to be able to statistically analyze actual mortality data from the Navy-Marine Corps Combat Trauma Registry 
and other sources). 


Individual Results, Smoothing Approach and Mortality Risk Categories 


This section will show some of the individual panel member plots and how we combined (smoothed) these results 
into a single descriptive response. We will also display the smoothed results for the effects of no treatment across all 
eight PCs and show how we chose to collapse the set into three so-called mortality risk categories for an initial 
implementation. 



Figure 8 - Individual results for PC147 and smoothing approach. 


Figure 8 shows the panel members’ individual responses for PC147 (complete above knee amputation) for the “no 
treatment” case and for the “1 st Responder treatment effect after a 10 minute delay” case. Except for a very few high 
and low values, the individual plots appear to be fairly consistent in their overall trends. Since our objective with 
these results is to get an idea of the general descriptive nature of the mortality function suitable for a first 


12 





















































































implementation in TML+, we choose to thin the results by trimming the highest and lowest value at each time point 
polled, then average the remaining estimates. The “Ave” curve in each plot shows this trimmed mean; the two curves 
are plotted together on the right side of the figure, and the nature of the trends in both cases is readily visible. 


It is clear that quick treatment by a 1 st Responder is expected to almost totally mitigate the life-threatening conditions 
represented by this PC. For example, of an average 82 survivors at 10 minutes, about 95% survive past three hours, 
versus only about 50% if there is no treatment. Next we show the (average) number surviving plots for all eight PCs. 


The left side of Figure 9 shows, for estimates of the effect of no treatment, the trimmed-mean values for all eight PCs. 
We see that they range from a gradual decay in mortality for PCI68 (MIW chest and abdomen wound, perforated 
bladder) to a rapid degradation for PC087. It is these curves we seek to describe with an initial probability model 
(and like curves for the other MTFs in various evacuation scenarios). Indeed, for the present, we would be pleased to 
be able to represent the boundaries of the region shown as well as a mid-range case. To this end, we next define so- 
called high, medium and low mortality risk categories.

Bins for H-M-L Risk Assignments 



Figure 9 - No Treatment results for all Patient Conditions and mortality categories. 


It seems reasonable to divide the life-threatening PCs into risk sets characterized by the probability of surviving past 
one hour with no treatment as occurring in intervals {0, 0.33}, {0.34, 0.66} and {0.67, 1.0}. This would correspond to 
the “number surviving” at 1 hour to be between 0 and 33, 34 and 66, etc. in the present context. The right side of 
Figure 9 shows this characterization superimposed on the number surviving graph of the left figure. We choose to 
take PC087 to represent the highest mortality category (low probability of surviving past one hour), PCI47 to 


13 
















































represent the mid-range, and PCI 68 to represent the lowest mortality risk. For the present we will concentrate on 
describing the SME responses for these three PCs and apply results to be developed later to the total group of life- 
threatening PCs (see Appendix B for table of PCs and mortality risk categories as considered and mapped by SMEs 
at NHRC). 


No Treatment, 1st Responder and Next LOC after 1st Responder Results for 
H/M/L Mortality Categories 

In this section, we show the SME responses for the three mortality risk categories just defined for the cases of “no 
treatment” and for “1 st Responder treatment” effects. We also show effects for the three evacuation alternatives after 
the 1 st Responder. 



Figure 10 - No treatment and 1 st Responder summary SME results by mortality category. 


Figure 10 shows the “no treatment” smoothed responses (converted to survival probabilities) for the low, medium and 
high mortality categories as extracted from Figure 9. They range from a rapid and non-linear degradation for PC087 
to a less severe and near linear degradation for PCI 68. The 1 st Responder treatment effects for delays of 10 minutes 
and one hour are also shown. 


14 



























































It is easy to see that the medium risk PC category is estimated to respond nicely to quick 1 st Responder treatment 
and indeed, delays up to one hour have a visible effect in mitigating the effects of no treatment. The responses for 
PC087 (high risk mortality) indicate only a slight improvement in the survival function for a short delay while the delay 
for one hour appears to have no effect. The low mortality case shown suggests that this category of PC has little 
degradation and would probably not be a candidate for priority treatment by the 1 st Responder. 

Figure 11 shows responses for the next three evacuation options considered after the 1 st Responder. In these plots 
we show the probability that the casualty survives past one hour, and three hours, if alive when entering the facility 
three hours after the time of injury. (This “conditional” measure is used in a large sense to decouple the entering 
LOC response estimates from the specific details of previous LOC interventions.) 


The three hours after injury timing is rather arbitrary, as there would be an infinite number of possible times, given the 
simulation nature of TML+. It is clear from the figure that the BAS is not as effective as the STP or STP/FRSS as the 
next LOC after the 1 st Responder for the high risk PC category. 

It is also evident that the STP/FRSS treatment effects are estimated as highly effective in saving survivors from the 
1 st Responder location. It may also be noted that the STP and STP/FRSS are more effective than the BAS in 
stabilizing the casualty for the medium and low risk categories (comparing probability of survival > 3 hours to 
probability of survival > 1 hour). We expect these observations would be the same even if time intervals other than 
the three hours from POI we used here were chosen.

Representative Results across all Evacuation Scenarios and Mortality Risk 
Categories 

Referring back to Figure 6, it is easy to see that there is a tremendous amount of response data to help describe the 
time-based survival function we seek. Our challenge is to depict representative results in a longitudinal manner 
corresponding to the various evacuation scenarios in an effort to describe a tentative form of the survival function for 
each of the mortality risk categories.

Figure 12 - Number Surviving for evacuation Scenario 2 (for PCI47). 


Figure 12 shows, for evacuation scenario 2 and PCI47, the estimated number of survivors across the several MTFs. 
In this case, the 1 st Responder begins treatment at 1 hour after injury, the STP at 3 hours and the CRTS at 9 hours. 
Given the grid of treatment delays we chose (see Figure 6), a myriad of graphs would result and our goal is to 
describe the general nature of the ensemble of responses for our initial implementation in TML+. We expect the 
functional form to be consistent across the grid where applicable parameters for a particular simulation realization in 
TML+ can be estimated via an interpolation approach that we expect to implement later. 


In Figure 12 we can easily see that the surviving number is expected to be almost constant with time after the first 
few treatment interventions. That is, the conditional probability of survival with time would be very high--and almost 
horizontal-given the casualty survives to enter the facility.

Figure 13 - Summary of representative results for all evacuation scenarios and mortality categories. 


In Figure 13 we attempt to summarize representative SME responses across the various evacuation scenarios and 
the three mortality risk categories. In the far left column of graphs, we repeat the plots of number surviving with no 
treatment for the three mortality categories (an extension of Figure 10 out to 24 hours). 


The next column shows the unconditional probability of surviving past three hours given 10 minute and one hour 
delays in starting 1 st Responder treatment (from Figure 10); it also shows, for comparison purposes, the probability of 
surviving past three hours without treatment. The next column begins to show the effects of evacuation alternatives 
after the 1 st Responder--here we show the conditional probability of surviving past one and three hours, given the 
simulation casualty survives to enter the facility (from Figure 11). 

The last two columns show similar results for the remaining LOCs in the various evacuation scenarios. For the last 
three columns illustrated, the assumed timing from injury to entry at the respective LOCs is indicated. These are 
nominally the lower end of the time grid that was presented to the SME panel for these scenarios; estimates for

longer times were also polled but are not shown here. Estimates from the entire grid are used in describing the 
survival function where the upper and lower time values will be used to interpolate the results, if deemed necessary. 


In the results for the last three columns, we see that the estimates are fairly constant (comparing the entries for “x=1” 
to “x=3”) particularly for the medium and low mortality risk categories. These results suggest that describing the form 
of the survival function is perhaps more important for the first few treatment interventions shortly after the injury. In all 
of the SME results we have examined, the survival function appears to be almost linear for the latter medical 
interventions. 


Figure 13 also shows the conditional probability estimates for the survival function depicted in Figure 12 using 
“number surviving”. In the next section, we present how the Weibull survival function from the biomedical sciences 
discipline is used to describe the SME results given here. 


Using a Biomedical Sciences Model to Describe the SME Mortality Estimates 

Folding SME results into a model such as TML+ can be handled in a variety of ways. Our original effort to describe a 
mortality function was to use least-squares regression analysis to curve-fit 1 st Responder results at Camp Lejeune 

m 

Another, more versatile, approach is to consider that the underlying stochastic process can be described by a 
probability density function for time to death, and then use the corresponding survival function (probability of survival 
past time “t”) to simulate the mortality event. 


It is this latter approach that we adopted from biomedical sciences literature. In this section, we describe how the 
Weibull survival function S(t) = exp[-(t/a) A b], with parameters “a” and “b”, is used as our interim dynamic model in 
TML+ to simulate mortality of life-threatening injuries (see Figure 5). 


In the context of simulating the died of wounds event across a set of MTFs representing an evacuation scenario, the 
variable “t” in S(t) will correspond to the time period as measured when the casualty enters an LOC alive. With 
reference to Figure 3, we seek to describe each curve with its own parameters “a” and “b” in the Weibull survival 
function S(t) where T is tl for the 1 st DOW check point shown, t2-t1 is the value of T in S(t) for the 2nd DOW check 
point and so forth. 


For the initial implementation in TML+, which is primarily a placeholder until quantitative Navy-Marine Corps Combat 
Trauma Registry data are available for a statistical analysis, the parameters of the Weibull survival function S(t) are 
chosen such that the function matches the SME responses at two observations. Estimation of the parameters using 
all data points will be attempted by the method of least-squares or maximum likelihood on CTR results; other 
biomedical sciences death distribution models will also be examined.

Figure 14 - Weibull Survival Function applied to No Treatment results (by mortality category). 


In Figure 14 we show the observed results for the three mortality risk categories and the fitted S(t) survival function 
values, as forced to match the SME responses at 0.5 and 3.0 hours after the time of injury. It is clear that the Weibull 
model describes the observed SME results very nicely; parameter estimates are also shown. 


Figure 15 shows the 1 st Responder SME results for the effects of no treatment for PC147 (the medium risk case) for 
treatment delays of 10 minutes, one hour, and three hours. We show this set of graphs to aid in helping decide if the 
Weibull parameters for a risk category and LOC might be dependent on the delay time in starting treatment at the 
particular LOC. 



19 






































































It is clear from the previous figure that the parameters of the Weibull survival function can be expected to vary by risk 
category but is there also an effect for the Weibull survival function for PCI 47, say, if the delay time in entering the 1 st 
Responder is variable, as it undoubtedly will be in the queuing environment of TML+? To help answer this question 
for the initial implementation, Figure 15 allows us to examine the results for a set of timing delays and determine if 
they appear to have different shapes. 


If they are judged to have different characteristics dependent upon time delay, then an interpolation scheme would 
have to be used to determine the applicable “a” and “b” values vs. time. The response grid that we solicited from the 
SME panel was designed with that possibility in mind. 


Using the results in Figure 15 for PCI47, we form the conditional survival function for each delay and plot them 
together on the left side of Figure 16, where the x-axis is now taken to be the time from entering the LOC (from 10 
minutes, from one hour, etc). A quick visual inspection of these plots makes us doubt that there would be a serious 
need to consider that the parameters are dependent on treatment delay time. For the initial implementation we are 
willing to make this assumption; we do plan to revisit this idea when data become available from the Navy-Marine 
Corps Combat Trauma Registry. 



The right side of Figure 16 shows the fit of the Weibull survival function to the observed SME results for the delay of 
one hour, and again, we see a very nice agreement that is sufficient for an initial implementation. The estimates for 
the Weibull parameters for the 10 minute, 1 hour and 3 hour delay cases are (191,0.6), (193, 0.6) and (145, 0.7), 
respectively, where each ordered pair gives a set (a, b). 


20 














































Appendix C gives the Weibull parameters for the various evacuation routes. It is noted that we have appended the 
Weibull survival function by adding a multiplicative constant “c”, such that the actual survival function used in TML+ is 
c*exp(-t/a) A b. For LOCs where the conditional survival function is approximately a constant (reference the latter 
LOCs in Figure 13), we set “c” to the constant value and make “a” and “b” large numbers so that S(t) is approximately 
equal to “c” for all time values. If the response is not constant, the above method of estimating the Weibull 
coefficients is used and “c” is set to 1.0. 


Conclusions and Plans 


In this paper we presented NHRC’s research approach for using SME responses and empirical Navy-Marine Corps 
Combat Trauma Registry data to model the stochastic survival function for life-threatening injuries sustained on the 
battlefield when subjected to delays in the treatment stream across several interventions of medical care. We 
demonstrated the application of the widely accepted Weibull probability model from the biomedical sciences discipline 
to a set of medical provider SME opinions on the survival of a hypothetical set of 100 casualties with selected PCs as 
they progressed through several networks of MTFs. Three mortality risk categories were defined and it was shown 
how the Weibull survival model described the SME opinions for selected PCs in these categories. The fit was judged 
(qualitatively) to be reasonable for the initial implementation of a time-based mortality function in the TML+ planning 
tool. 


It was noted that NHRC is collecting actual mortality and treatment data from all echelons of medical care in the 
Navy-Marine Corps Combat Trauma Registry and the descriptive results presented here will be re-examined with 
more inferential methods when a suitable sample of CTR data is available. The emerging technology called 
“pervasive computing” to obtain “anywhere, anytime, any data” is being investigated as a vehicle to automate medical 
source data collected in real time.

14. ABSTRACT (maximum 200 words) 

Medical simulation models such as NHRC’s Tactical Medical Logistics (TML+) planning tool stochastically represent the mortality of 
casualties with life-threatening injuries at various points in the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) network flow. NHRC is seeking to 
determine a mathematical (probabilistic) representation of a conditional survival function that is reasonable in the context of other 
stochastic models being used in TML+. The paper describes NHRC’s research approach to determine an acceptable TML+ model for 
the mortality function, describes SME opinion results being used as the basis for an interim descriptive model using a biomedical 
sciences probability model (Weibull), and gives the future plans to capture more quantitative mortality and treatment data from the Navy- 
Marine Corps Combat Trauma Registry and other sources to use in investigating the applicability of a full range of biomedical sciences 
probability models via inferential methods.
