Abstract 


ORA is software for the analysis of network structure. The ORA components are a collection of 
programs that implement the features available in ORA as of the vl.9.5.4.5 (August 2009) 
software release.

ORA Components 


The ORA components are a collection of java executable programs for use in 
Social Network Analysis applications. These components are used by 
interface programs such as ORA GUI and SORASCS. 

The components described in this manual are based on the ORA vl.9.5.4.5 
(August 2009) software release. 

How To Use 

The components require Java 1.6 or higher and are callable via a command 
line interface. The following example shows how to call the Lowercase 
routine. 

C:\> java -cp ORA_CP edu.emu.casos.Oralll.controller.OraMain 

ORA_CP is the class path for ORA and is contained in Appendix I, from 
which it can be copied. 

edu.emu.casos.Oralll.controller.OraMain is the name of the routine to 
run. 

The ORA components are not directly callable from a Java program except to 
the extent to which any main() may be called. No guarantee is given to 
components being called in this manner. 

File Types 

The file types used are industry standard. This permits maximum flexibility 
in using the AutoMap components with other components. All components 
assume that files are in a standard UTF-8 file encoding. 

• Text Files. The text file is for human-readable text. AutoMap 
components assume these files have a .txt extension. 

• CSV Files. The comma separated values file is for information 
organized in a table. AutoMap components assume these files have a 
.csv extension. 

• XML Files. The XML file is used for structured data, such as DyNetML 
used for expressing dynamic networks. AutoMap components assume 
these files have a .xml extension. 


1 


Classifications 


The components are classified based on their usage. 

• File Utility. These routines are provided as an aid in manipulation of 
files to prepare them for processing. 

• Internal Command. An internal command is a routine that has no 
obvious interface to the end user. 

• External Tool. An external tool is a stand-alone routine with its own 
user interface. The external tool is available to aid in the manipulation 
of supplemental files. 


Component Reference 

This section gives an alphabetical list of all ORA components. This list may 
not include routines that are used by the ORA components indirectly or 
routines that may be called by 3 rd party libraries that ORA may make use of. 

Mandatory arguments are listed in <angle brackets> with the pipe | symbol 
being used to identify accepted options. Optional arguments are in [square 
brackets]. Ellipses signify that an option may be repeated many times.

OraMain 


This routine will launch the ORA GUI with no dataset. There are no 
parameters. 

Classification: External Tool 

Input File Type: N/A 

Output File Type: N/A 

Usage: 

java -cp ORA_CP edu.emu.casos.OraUI.controller.OraMain 

Parameters: 

None 


3 



OraMainLoadAndSelectedReports 


This routine will launch the ORA GUI with selected datasets and with only 
the specified reports enabled. If no datasets are specified, then none are 
loaded. If no reports are specified, then all are available. Thus, if no 
command line arguments are provided, then this routine is the same as the 
OraMain routine. 

Classification: External Tool 

Input File Type: N/A 

Output File Type: N/A 

Usage: 

java -cp ORA_CP 

edu.cmu.casos.OraUI. controller. OraMainLoadAndSelectedReports 
<dataset_filename>... <report_ID> ... 

Parameters: 

<dataset_filename> Zero or more filenames of datasets to automatically 

load at startup. 

<report_ID > Zero or more reports to be available to the user at 

startup. If none are specified, then all reports will be 
available. The report IDs that can be used are listed 
in Appendix II.

parameters to various routines. 


Report ID 

Report Title (used in 
GUI) 

Description 

riskCategories

Entities 

Analyzes the changes over time of the 
agents that score highest in measure 
values. 

communicationAssessment 

Communications 
Network Assessment 

This report assesses a communications 
network. As information on speed of 
information transmittal becomes 
available it will be updated. This report 
takes a resource by resource network 
(preferably one where the nodes are 
communications devices and the links 
are the speed or reliability of the link). 

communicativePower 

Communicative 

Power 

Analyzes one or more semantic 
networks to classify concepts by 
measure values. 

communicators 

Communicators 

Analyzes the communication network 
(agent by agent) and gives high level 
statistics on its structure. 

context 

Context 

Compares measured values against 
various stylized forms of networks in an 
effort to characterize network topology. 

coreNetwork 

Core Network 

Computes the core network and reports 
general statistics. 

criticalSets 

Critical Sets 

Finds critical sets of nodes in a network 
that best reach all other nodes, or whose 
removal maximally disrupts a network. 

custom 

Custom 

Computes a custom report with user 
selected measures and output tables, 


7 






pictures, and figures. 

drillDown 

Drill Down 

Computes the drill down from a 
selected organization and then to a 
selected agent. 

geospatialAssessment 

Geospatial 

Assessment 

Linds nodes that are co-located based, 
and counts the number of nodes that 
appear at location pairs. 

groupTalk 

Group Talk 

Analyzes the relationship between 
agents and knowledge. 

content Analysis 

Hot Topics (Content 
Analysis) 

Analyzes semantic network output from 
AutoMap. 

immediatelmpact 

Immediate Impact 

Computes the key actors of the network, 
and then isolates them individually to 
determine the effect on measure values. 

influenceNetwork 

Influence Net 

Displays the influence network and 
gives high level statistics on its 
structure. 

intelligence 

Key Entity 

Identifies key entities and groups who 
by virtue of their position in the network 
are critical to its operation. 

list 

Large Scale 

Computes all network analysis 
measures. 

localPattems 

Local Patterns 

Lind link patterns in a network, such as 
Star, Checkerboard, and Clique. 

subGroup 

Locate SubGroups 

Identifies the subgroups present in the 
network using various grouping 
algorithms. 

management 

Management 

Identifies over- and under-performing 
individuals and assesses the state of the 
network as a functioning organization. 

merchantMarine V e s sel 

Merchant Marine 

Analyzes the relationships between 
crew members, owners, vessels and 
locations of the Merchant Marine 

Vessel data. 

missingLinks 

Missing Links 

Compute possible missing links in a 
network. 

optimizer 

Optimizer 

Adapt the link structure of a meta¬ 
network to maximize or minimize 
selected measure values. 

partOfSpeech 

Part Of Speech 

Describe the distribution of concepts by 
part of speech in one or more networks. 

potentialErrors 

Potential Errors 

Detects potential errors in agent to agent 
interactions based on the expected 
interactions from cognitive similarity 
and expertise. 

health 

Public Health 

Analyzes health department data to find 


8 






potential problems. 

qap 

QAP/MRQAP 

Analysis 

Computes QAP and MRQAP 

Correlation and Regression (Dekker and 
Y-Permutation methods) on input 
networks. 

semanticNetwork 

Semantic Network 

Analyzes one or more semantic 
networks, computing the central 
networks and key concepts and links. 

shortestPath 

Shortest Path 

Computes the shortest path between two 
entities and general statistics on the 
paths. The sphere of influence of each 
entity is also computed. 

simmelianTies 

Simmelian Ties 
Analysis 

Calculates the number of Asymmetric, 
Sole-Symmetric, and Simmelian ties in 
unimodal networks computes standard 
measures on them.

actors, groups, knowledge, resources, 
etc. that influence and are influenced by 
that actor. 

sna

analysis measures (degree centrality, 
betweenness centrality, etc). 

statisticalNetworkMonitorin 

g 

Statistical Change 
Detection

Fits statistical distributions to a network 
based on measure values. 

tavi 

TAVI 

This report analyzes the Rendezvous 
and Threat event data from the TAVI
