INTRODUCTION 


Hie Ada impleinentation described above was tested according to the Ada 
Validation Procedures (Pro92] against the Ada Standard {AdaSS] using the 
current Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC). This Validation Sunnary 
Report (VSR) gives an account of the testing of this Ada implementation. For 
any technical terms used in this report, the reader is referred to [Pro92]. 
A detailed description of the ACVC may be found in the current ACVC User's 
Guide [UG89].

1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Coo^liance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: A, 
B, c, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class to 
which it belongs. Class A, C, 0, and E tests are executable. Class B and 
class L tests are expected to pro^ce errors at coeipile time and link time, 
respectively. 

Ihe executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result v^en they are 
executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, and the 
procedure CHECK_FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT also 
provides a set of identity functions used to defeat some compiler 
optimizations allowed the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of text 
files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK^^FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class B 
tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that Ml violations of 
the Ada Stan^rd are detected. Soate of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code vhich must not be flagged illegal the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects violation of 
the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately compiled units. Errors are 
expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values — for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this inplementation is provid^ in Appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and 
implementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this implementation are described in section 2.3.

INTRODUCTION 


For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by the AVF. 
This customization consists of mzdcing the modifications '?‘*scribed in the 
preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see section 2.1), and possibly 
removing sore inapplicable tests (see section 2.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada inplementation must process each test of the 
customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 


A test is inaiiplicable if it contains test objectives which are irrelevant 
for a given Ada implementation. Reascms for a test's inapplicability may be 
support^ by documents issued by the ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and commonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Comnentaries are included as 
appropriate.

C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with a 
name other than FLOAT, L0NG_FLQAT, or SHORT_FLOAT; for this 
implementation, there is no such type. 


C45531N..P 2 uid C45532M..P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations for 
types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANT1SSA of 47 or greater; for this 
inplementation, MAXJNANTISSA is less than 47. 

C45624A..B (2 tests) check that the proper exception is raised if 
MACMINEjOVERFLCWS is FALSE for floating point types and the results of 
various floating-point operations lie outside the range of the base 
type; for this implementation, MACHINE OVERFLOWS is TRUE. 


B86001Y uses the name of a predefined fixed-point type other than type 
DURATION; for this implementation, there is no such ty^. 

C96005B uses values of type DURATION'S base type that are outside the 
range of type DURATION; for this iiqplementation, the ranges are the 
same. 


CD1009C checks whether a length clause can specify a non-default size 
for a floating-point type; this inqplementation (Joes not support such 
sizes. 

CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), euld CD2A640 use length clauses 
to specify non-default sizes for access types; this implementation does 
not support such sizes.

2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 22 tests. 

■Ae following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
inplementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the way 
expected by the original tests.

CD1009A, CD1009I, CD1C03A, CD2A22J, CD2A24A, and CD2A31A. .C were graded 
passed by Evaluation Modification as directed by the AVO. These tests use 
instantiations of the support procedure LENG'IH_CHECK, which uses 
Unchecked Conversion according to the interpretation given in AI-00590. The 
AVC rulecT that this interpretation is not binding under ACVC 1.11; the tests 
are ruled to be passed if they produce Failed messages only from the 
instances of LENGTH_CHECK—i.e, the allowed Report.Failed messages have the 
general form: 

" * CHECK ON REPRESENTATION FOR <TyPE_ID> FAILED." 

AD9001B was graded passed by Test Modification as directed by the AVO. This 
test checks that no bodies are required for interfaced subprograms; among the 
procedures that it uses is one with a parameter of mode OUT (line 36). This 
inplemenation does not support pragma INTERFACE for procedures with 
parameters of mode OUT. The test was modified by commenting out line 36 and 
40; the modified test was passed.

PROCESSING INFORMATION 


3.1 TESTING ENVIRaJMENT 


The Ada implementation tested in this validation effort is described 
adequately by the information given in the initial pages of this report. 

For technical sind sales information about this Ada implementation, contact;

Aloha, OR 97006-1992 
(503) 690-1116 


Testing of this Ada in^jlementation was conducted at the customer's site by a 
validation team from the AVF. 


3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming Language 
Standard, vdiether the test is applicable or inapplicable; otherwise, the Ada 
Implementation fails the ACVC [Pro92]. •. 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was obtained 
that conforms to the Ada Programming Leuiguage Standard. 

The list of items below gives the number of ACVC tests in various categories. 
All tests were processed, except those that were withdrawn because of test 
errors (item b; see section 2.1), those that require a floating-point 
precision that exceeds the implementation's maximum precision (item e; see 
section 2.2), and those that depend on the support of a file system — if 
none is supported (item d). All tests passed, except those that are listed 
in sections 2.1 and 2.2 (counted in items b and f, below).

3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

A magnetic tape containing the custcmdzed test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were loaded onto a Srun SPARCcenter 2000 and then copied to the 
host computer system. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host cooputer, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 

The tests were ccmpiled, linked and executed on the host computer system. 
The results were captured on the host canputer system. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the customer and

Arguments 

object__£ile.o non-rAda object file names. These files %dll be passed 
~ on to the linker and vrill be linked with the specified 

Ada object files. 

options options to the ccnpiler. These are: 

-A (disassemble) Disassemble the units in the source file after 
ccnpiling them. -A can be followed by arguments that further 
define the disassembly display (e.g., -Aa, -Ab, -Ad» -Af, 

-Al, -As). 

a Add hexadecimal display of instruction bytes to 
disassembly listing, 
b Disassemble the unit body [default], 
d Print the data section (if present) as well, 
f Use the alternative format for output. 

1 Put the disassembly output in file "filejiame.das” 
s Disassemble the unit spec. 

-a file name 

(arBiive) Treat file name as an dbject archive file created 
by ar. Since some ar^iive files end with .a, -a is used to 
distinguish archive files from Ada source files. 

-Bstatic/dynamic (SPARCompiler Ada only) 

(static) If static is indicated, the Ada program is compiled 
and linked statically. The default is dvnamic. 

-c suppress the control messages generated vdwn pragma PACS 
an^or pragma LIST are encountered. i 

-D identifier type value 

(define) Define an identifier of a specified type and value. 


-DAl.O 

-DAl.l 

-nA2.0 

(architecture) Specify the architecture version the compiler 
should generate code for. These options override the ARCHITECTURE 
INTO directive [Default: -DAl.l] (HP PA-RISC only) 


-d (dependencies) Analyze for dependencies only. Do not do 


B-2 





CQHPIIATXQN SYSTEM OPTIGNS 


semantic analysis or code generation. Update the library, 
marking any defined units as uncompiled. The -d option is 
used by a.make to establish dependencies amcmg new files. 
This option will attempt to do imports for any units 
referenced fron outer libraries. This should reduce 
relocation and reduce user disk space usage. 


-E directory 

(error output) Without a directory argument, ada processes 
error messages using a.error and directs a brief message to 
standard output; the raw error messages are left in 
source_file.err. If a directory name is given, the raw error 
output is placed in directory/source_file.err. The file of 
raw error messages can be used as input to a.error. Only 
one -e or -E option should be used. 

-e (error) Process ccopilation error messages using a.error and 
send it to standard output. Only the source lines containing 
errors are listed. Only one -e or -E option should be used. 

-Eferror_file source_file 

(error) Process source file and place any error messages 
in the file indicated By error_file. Note that there is 
no space Isetween the -Ef and error_file. 


-El directory 

(error listing) Same as the -E option, except that a source 
listing with errors is produced. Note that the source listing is 
directed to standard out vrtiile the raw errors are placed in 
source_f ile.err. 

-el (error listing) Intersperse error messages among source 
lines and direct to standard output. 

-Elferror_file source_file 

(error listing) Same as the -Ef option, except that a source 
listing with errors is produced arxi directed to standard output. 
The raw errors are written to error_file. 

-ev (error vi(l)) Process syntax error messages using a.error, 
emlsed them in the source file and call the environment editor 
ERROR EDITOR. If ERROR_EDITOR is defined, the environment 
variable ERROR_PATTERN should also be defined. ERROR_PATTERN 
is an editor search command that locates the first occurrence 
of '###' in the error file. If no editor is specified, vi(l) 
is invoked. 

The value of the environment variable ERROR_TABS, if set, 
is used instead of the default tab settings (8). 

-F (full DIANA) Do not trim the DIANA tree before output to 
net files. TO save disk space, the DIANA tree will Ise 

B-3 







CX3MPIIATI0N SYSTEM OPTIONS 


trinmed so that all pointers to nodes that did not involve 
a subtree that define a symbol table will be nulled 
(unless those nodes are part of the body of an inline or 
generic or certain other values needing to be retained for 
the debugging or compilation information). The trinming 
generally removes initial values of variables and all 
statements. 

-G (GVAS) Display suggested values for the MIN_GVAS_AI»R 
and NAX_GVAS_AIX>R INFO directives. 

-K (keep) Keep the intermediate language (IL) file produced 
by the comqpiler front end. The IL file will be placed in 
the .objects directory with the file name Ada_source. 

~L library_name 

(library) Operate in VADS library library_name. 

[Default: current working directory) 

-Ifile 2 ±>breviation (VADSself only) 

(library search) This is an option passed to the ld(l) 
linker, telling it to search the specified library file. 

(No space between the -1 and the file abbreviation.) 

-M unit name 

(main) Produce an executable program by linking the named 
unit as the main program, unitjiame must alrea^ be 
compiled. It must be either a parameterless procedure or 
a parameterless function returning an integer. The 
executable program will be named a.out (VADSself) or a.vox 
(VADScross) unless overridden with the -o option. 

-M source file 

(mainT Produce an executable program by compiling and 
linking source_file. The main unit of the program is 
assumed to be the root name of the file (for foo.a the 
unit is foo). Only one file may be preceded by -M. The 
executable program will be named a.out (VADSself) or a.vox 
(VADScross) unless overridden with the -o option. 

-N (no code sharing) Compile all generic instantiations 
without sharing code for their bodies. This option 
overrides the SHARE_B(X>Y INFO directive and the SHARE_CODE 
or SHARE_BCX)Y pragmas. 

-NX (NX) Link with NX startup code and with the NX archive libraries. 
This option is valid only if the -M option has also been invoked. 

(Sun SPARC ■> Paragon only) 


-OtO-9) 

(optimize) Invoke the code optimizer. An optional digit 
(there is no space before the digit) provides the level of 
optimization. The default is -04. 






CXMPIIATIQN SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-O full optimization 
-00 no optimization 

-01 copy propagation, constant folding, removing 
dead variables, subsuming moves between scalar 
variables 

-02 add coninon subexpression elimination within 
basic blocks 

-03 add global coomon suJsexpression elimination 
-04 add hoisting invariants from loops and address 
optimizations 

-05 add range optimizations, instruction scheduling 
and one pass of reducing induction expressions 
-06 no change 

-07 add one more pass of induction expression reduction 

-08 add one more pass of induction expression reduction 

-09 add one more pass of induction expression 

reduction and add hoisting expressions coonon to 
the then and the else parts of if statements 

Hoisting from branches (and cases alternatives) can be slow 
and does not always provide significant performance gains so 
it can be suppressed. 

Note that using the -OO option can alleviate sane problems when 
debugging. For exaii{>le, using a higher level of optimization, 
you may receive a message that a variable is no longer active or 
is not yet active. If you experience these problems, set the 
optimization level to 0 using the -OO option. 

-o executable file 

(output) ^is option is to be used in conjunction with 
the -N option. executable_file is the name of the executable 
rather than the default, a.out (self) or a.vox (cross). 

-P Invoke the Ada Preprocessor. 

-R VADS_library 

(reconcile instantiation) Force analysis of all generic 
instantiations, causing reinstantiation of any that are out 
of date. VADS library is the library in \diich the 
recompilation Ts to occur. If it is not specified, the 
reccxopilation occurs in the current working directory. 

-r (recreate) Recreate the library's GVASJIABLE file. This option 
reinitializes the file and exits. This allows recovery from 
"GVAS exhausted" without rec«ipiling all the files in the library. 

-S (suppress) ^>ply pragma SUPPRESS to the entire compilation 
for all su^ressible checks. 

-sh (show) Display the name of the tool executable but do not 
execute it. 

-T (timing) Print timing information for the coopilation. 






CX3HPIIATIGM SYSTEM OPTIGNS 


-trb 

(trace block) Generate code to trace entry into basic blocks and 
calls and returns (for use with a.trace c^y) 

-V (verbose) Print coopiler version number, date and tiom of 
compilation, name of file compiled, command input line, 
total compilation time and error summary line. Storage usage 
information about the object file is provided. 

-w (warnings) Si^ress warning diagnostics. 

source_file name of the source file to be compiled. 

Description 

The ada command executes the Ada compiler and compiles the named Ada 
source file. The file must reside in a VADS library directory. Ihe 
ada.lib file in this directory is modified after each Ada unit is 
compiled. 

By default, ada produces only object and net files. If the -M option 
is used, the compiler automatically invokes a.Id and builds a complete 
program with the named library unit as the main program. 

For cross systems, the compiler generates object files compatible with 
the host linker in VOX format. The VOX format is discussed in 
Appendix A of the Programmer's Guide. 

Nbn-Ada object files (.o files produced by a coopiler for another 
language) may be given as arguments to ada. These files will be passed 
on to the linker and will be linked with the specified Ada object files. 

Command line options may be specified in any order but the order of 
conpilation and the order of the files to be passed to the linker can 
be significant. 

Several VADS compilers may be simultaneously available on a single 
system. Because the ada conmand in any \ADiS_location/bin on a system 
will execute the correct coopiler components based upon visible 
library directives, the option -sh is provided to print the name of 
the conponents actually executed. ^ 

Program listings with a disassembly of machine code instructions 
are generated by a.db or a.das. 

NOTE: If two files of the same name from different directories are 
ccxtpiled in the same ada library using the -L option (even if the 
contents and unit names are different), the second coopilation will 
overwrite the first. For exasple, the compilation of 
Aisr/directory2/foo.a -L /Aisr/vads/test will overwrite the 
conpilation of /usr/directoryl/foo.a -L Aisr/vads/test in the 
VADS library /usrAads/test. 




COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


NOTE; It is possible to specify the directory for teoporary files by 
setting the environment variable TMPDIR to the desired path. If TEMPDIR 
is not set, /trap is used. If the path specified by TMTOIR does not exist 
or is not writeable, the program exits with an error message to that effect. 

Diagnostics 

The diagnostics produced by the VADS compiler are intended to be 
self-explanatory. Mos> 'efer to the RM. Each RM reference includes a 
section number and optionally, a paragraph number enclosed in 
parentheses.

-DO (objects) Use partially linked objects instead of archives 
as an intermediate file if the entire list of objects cannot

name of an Ada unit. It must name a non-generic subprogram. 

If unit_name is a function, it must return a value of the 
type STANDARD.INTEGER. This integer result will be passed back 
to the shell as the status code of the execution. 

Description 

a.Id collects the object files needed to make unitjneune a main 
program and calls the ld(l) linker to link together all Ada and 
other language objects required to produce an executable image in 
a.out (self) or a.vox (cross). The utility uses the net files produced 
by the Ada compiler to check dependency information, euld produces 
cui exception mapping t^±)le and a unit eledx}ration teible and passes 
this information to the linker. The elaboration list generated by 
a.Id will not include library level packages that do not need 
eledboration. Similarly, packages that contain no code that ceui raise 
cin exception will no longer have exception teUsles. 

a.Id reads instructions for generating executables from the ada.lib 
file in the VADS libraries on the search list. Besides information 
generated by the compiler, these directives also include WITHn 
directives that allow the automatic linking of object modules 
compiled from other languages or Ada object modules not named 
in context clauses in the Pda source. Any number of WITHn 


B-9 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


directives may be placed into a library but they oust be 
numbered contiguously beginning at WITHI. The directives are 
recorded in the library's ada.lib file and have the following form. 

WITHI;LINK:object_file: 

WITH2:LINK:archive_file; 

WITHn directives may be placed in the local Ada libraries or in 
any VADS library on the search list. 

A WITHn directive in a local VADS library or earlier on the 
library search list will hide the same numbered WITHn directive 
in a library later in the library search list. 

Use the tool a.info to change or report library directives in 
the current library. 

For VADSself on Silicon Graphics Coopjter Systems, the 
USE_LAST_LINK INFO directive speeds relinking by retaining a list 
of units, theTr types, seals and dependencies. 

VADS_location/biiv'a.ld is a wrapper program that executes the 
correct executable based upon directives visible in the ada.lib 
file. This permits multiple VADS compilers to exist on the same 
host. The -sh option prints the name of the actual executable file. 

NOTE: It is possible to specify the directory for temporary files by 
setting the environment variable TMPDIR to the desired path. If TMPDIR 
Is not set, /tjnp is used. If the path specified by TMPDIR does not exist 
or is not writeable, the program exits with an error message to that effect. 

Files

APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


APPENDIX F. Impleioentation-Dependent Characteristics 


1. Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 

1.1. INLINE_0NLY Pragma 

Itie INLINE_C»JLY pragma, v^en used in the same way as pragma 
INLINE, indicates to the conpiler that the subprogram must 
always be inlined. This pragma also siif^resses the genera¬ 
tion of a call 2 dDle version of the routine vdiich saves code 
space. If a user erroneously meUces an INLINEjONLY subpro¬ 
gram recursive a warning message will be emitted atnd an 
PROGRAM_ERROR will be raised at run time. 

1.2. BUILT_IN Pragma 

The BUILT IN pragma is used in the inplementation of some 
predefined Ada packages, but provides no user access. It is 
used only to implement code bodies for vhich no actual Ada 
body can be provided, for exanple the MACHINE_OODE package. 

1.3. SHARE_CCX)E Pragma 

The SHARE_CODE pragma takes the name of a generic instantia¬ 
tion or a generic \init as the first argument eu)d one of the 
identifiers TRUE or FALSE as the second argument. This 
pragma is only allowed immediately at the place of a 
declarative item in a declarative part or package specifica¬ 
tion, or after a library unit in a compilation, but before 
any subsequent conpilation unit. 

When the first argument is a generic unit the pragma applies' 
to all insteuitiations of that generic. When the first argu¬ 
ment is the name of a generic instantiation the pragma 
applies only to the specified instantiation, or overldaded 
instantiations. 

If the second argument is TRUE the compiler will try to 
share code generated for a generic instantiation with code 
generated for other instantiations of the same generic. 
When the second argument is FALSE each instantiation will 
get a unique copy of the generated code. The extent to 
^ich code is shared between instantiations depends on this 
pragma and the kind of generic formal parameters declared 
for the generic unit. 


C-2 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


The name pragma SHARE BODY is also recognized by the imple¬ 
mentation and has ^e same effect as SHAREJCQIS. It is 
included for coopatability with earlier versions of VADS. 

1.4. N0_IHAGE Pragma 

The pragma suppresses the generation of the image array \ised 
for the IMAGE attribute of enumeration types. This elim¬ 
inates the overhead required to store the array in the exe¬ 
cutable image. An attempt to use the IMAGE attribute on a 
type whose image array has been suppressed will result in a 
compilation warning a^ PROGBAMJERROR raised at run time. 

1.5. EXTERNAL NAME Pragma 

The EXTERNAL NAME pragma teJces the name of a subprogram or 
variable defined in Ada and allows the user to specify a 
different external name that may be used to reference the 
entity from other languages. The pragma is allowed at the 
place of a declarative item in a package specification and 
must apply to an object declared earlier in the same package 
specification. 

1.6. INTERFACE_NANE Pragma 

The INTERFACE_NAME pragma takes the name of a a variable or 
subprogram defined in another language and allows it to be 
referenced directly in Ada. The pragma will replace all 
occurrences of the variable or subprogram name with an 
external reference to the secondr link argument. The pragma 
is allowed at the place of a declarative item in a package 
specification and must apply to an object or subprogram 
declared earlier in the same package specification. The 
object must be declared as a scalar or an access type. The 
object cannot be any of the following: 
a loop variable, 
a constant, 

an initialized variable, 
an array, or 
a record. 

1.7. IMPLICIT_COOE Pragma ' 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine c^e 
procedure. It specifies that inplicit code generat^ by the 
compiler be allowed or disallowed. A warning is issued if 
OFF is used and any implicit code needs to be generated. 
The defa\d.t is ON. 


1.8. OPTIMIZE CODE Pragma 


C-3 






APPE14DIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


Takes one of the identifiers CX4 or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a marine c^e 
procedure. It specifies whether the code should be qptim- 
ized by the compiler. The default is ON. When OFF is 
specified, the compiler will generate the code as specified. 

2. Implementation of Predefined Pragmas 

2.1. CONTROLLED 

Ihis pragma is recognized by the inplementation but has no 
effect. 

2.2. ELABORATE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.3. INLINE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Af^ndix B of the 
Ada RM. 


2.4. INTERFACE 

This pragma supports calls to 'C' and FOEtlRAN functions. The 
Ada subprograms can be either fvunctions or procedures. The 
types of parameters and the result type for functions mus t 
be scalar, access or the predefined type ADDRESS in SYSTEM. 
All parameters must have m^e IN. Record and array objects 
can be passed by reference using the AIX>RESS attribute. 

2.5. LIST 

This pragma is ioplemented as described in ^jpendix B of the 
Ada RM. 


2.6. MEMORY_SIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the inplementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by meai^s of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recoopiled. 

2.7. NON_REEMTRANT 

This pragma takes one argument which can be the name of 
either a library subprogram or a subprogram declared immedi¬ 
ately within a library package spec or body. It indicates 
to the compiler that the sti^rogram will not be called 
recursively allowing the compiler to perform specific optim¬ 
izations. The pragma can be applied to a subprogram or a 
set of overloaded sxil^rograsm within a package spec or pack¬ 
age body. 


C-4 






APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STMCARD 


2.8. NOTELABOPATED 

This pragma can only appear in a library package specifica¬ 
tion. It indicates that the package will not be elaborated 
because it is either part of the RTS, a configuration pack¬ 
age or an Ada package that is referenced fron a language 
other than Ada. The presence of this pragma suppresses the 
generation of elaboration code and issues warnings if ela¬ 
boration code is required. 

2.9. OPTIMIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 

2.10. PACK 

This pragma will cause the ccnpiler to choose a non-aligned 
representation for cooposite types. It will not causes 
objects to be packed at the bit level. 

2.11. PAGE 

This pragma is inplemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 


2.12. PASSIVE 

The pragma has three forms : 

PRAGMA PASSIVE; 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(SEMAPHORE); 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(INTERRUPT, <number>); 


This pragma Pragma passive can be applied to a task or task 
type declared imn^iately within a library package spec or' 
bo^. The pragma directs the conpiler to qptimize certain' 
tasking operations. It is possible that the statements in a 
task body will prevent the intended optimization, in these 
cases a warning will be generated at coopile time and Hall 
raise TASKlNG_ERROR at runtime. 

2.13. PRIORITY 

This pragma is implemented as described in i^ppendix B of the 
Ada RM. 

2.14. SHARED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 


C-5 






APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


2.15. STORAGE_UNIT 

This pragma is recognized by the inplenentation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package nust be recompiled. 

2.16. SUPPRESS 

This pragma is implemented as described, except that 
DIVISION CHECK and in some cases OVERFLONjCHECK cannot be 
siipressed. ~ 

2.17. SYSTEMJMAME 

This pragma is recognized by the inf>leiiientation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recmpiled. 

3. Implementation-Dependent Attributes 

3.1. P'REF 

For a prefix that denotes an object, a program unit, a 
label, or an entry: 

This attribute denotes the effective address of the first of 
the storage units allocated to P. For a subprogram, pack¬ 
age, task \jnit, or label, it refers to the address of the 
machine code associated with the corresponding body or 
statement. For an entry for \Aiich an address clause has 
been given, it refers to the corresponding hardware inter¬ 
rupt. The attribute is of the type OPERAND defined in the 
package HACHINE_CXX)E. The attribute is only allowed within 
a machine code procedure. 

See section F.4.8 for more information on the use of this 
attribute. ^ 

(For a package, task unit, or entry, the 'REF attribute is 
not supported.) 


3.2. T’TASKID 

For a task object or a value T, T'TASK__ID yields the unique 
task id associated with a task. The value of this attribute 
is of the type AIX}RESS in the package SYSTEM.

5. Restrictions On Representation Clauses 

5.1. Pragma PACK 

In the absence of pragma PACK record coof)onents are padded 
so as to provide for efficient access by the target 
hardware, pragma PACK applied to a record eliminate the pad¬ 
ding where possible. Pragma PACK has no other effect on the 
storage allocated for record components a record representa¬ 
tion is required. 

5.2. Size Clauses 

For scalar types a representation clause will pack to the 
number of bits required to represent the range of the sub- 
type. A size clause a^^lied to a record type ^11 not cause 
packing of coo^nents; an explicit record representation 
clause must be given to specify the packing of the ccan-' 
ponents. A size clause applied to a record type will cause* 
packing of cooponents only v^en the cooponent type is a 
discrete type. An error will be issued if there is insuffi¬ 
cient space allocated. The SIZE attribute is not sippotted 
for task, access, or floating point types. 


5.3. Address Clauses 

Address clauses are only supported for variables. Since 
default initialization of a variable requires evaluation of 
the variable address elaboration ordering requirements 
prohibit inititalization of a variables vAiich have address 
clauses. The specified address indicates the physical 
address associated with the variable. 


C-9 




APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


5.4. Interrupts 

Intenipt entries are not supported. 

5.5. Representation Attributes 

The ADDRESS attribute is not supported for the following 
entities: 

Packages 

Tasks 

Labels 

Entries 


5.6. ffachine Code Insertions 
Machine code insertions are siq^ported. 

The general definition of the package MACHINE_CODE provides 
an assembly language interface for the target machine. It 
provides the necessary record type(s) needed in the code 
statement, an enumeration type of all the opcode mneumonics, 
a set of register definitions, and a set of addressing mode 
functions. 

The general syntax of a machine code statement is as fol¬ 
lows: 


CODEji'( opcode, operand {, operand} ); 

vhere n indicates the number of operands in the aggregate. 

A special case arises for a variable number of operands. 
The operands are listed within a subaggregate. The format 
is as follows: 

CODE_N'( opcode, (operand (, operand)) ); 

For those opcodes that require no operands, named notation 
must be used (cf. RN 4.3(4)). \ 

OODE_0'( op -> opcode ); 

The opcode must be an enumeration literal (i.e. it cannot be 
an object, attribute, or a rename). 

An operand can only be an entity defined in HACHINEJOODE or 
the 'REF attribute. 

The arguments to any of the functions defined in 
MACHINEjCODE must be static expressions, string literals, or 


C-10 






APPE34D1X F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


the functicHis defined in MACHINE_CXX%. The 'REF attribute 
may not be used as an argument in any of these functions. 

Inline expansion of machine code procedures is supported. 

6. Conventions for Implementation-generated Names 
There are no implementation-generated names. 

7. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clauses 

Address expressions in an address clause are interpreted as 
physical addresses. 

8. Restrictions on unchecked Conversions 
None. 

9. Restrictions on Unchecked Deallocations 


None. 


10. Implementation Characteristics of I/O Packages 

Instantiations of OIRECT_IO use the value MAX REC__SIZE as 
the record size (expressed in STORAtajUNITS) when^the size 
of ELEMENT_TypE exceeds that value. For example for uncon¬ 
strained arrays such as string where ELE31ENT_TTPE'SIZE is 
very large, MAXjREC_SIZE is used instead. maX_RECORD_SIZE 
is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a program before 
instantiating DIRECT_IO to provide an iqpper limit on the 
record size. In any~case the maximum size supported is 1024 
x 1024 X STORACSJUNIT bits. DIRECT_IO will raise USE_ERROR 
if MAX_REC_SIZE exceeds this absolute limit. 

Instantiations of SBQUENnAL_IO use the value MAX_REC_SIZE 
as the record size (expressed in STORAGEJUNITS) vAien the 
size of ELEMEZTTJIYPE exceeds that value. For exasple for, 
unconstrained arrays such as string where ELEHEMTJIYPE'SIZE 
is very large, MAX REC_SIZE is used instead. 
MAX_RECORD SIZE is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a 
program beTore instantiating INTBGER_IO to provide an i^p^r 
limit on the record size. SBQUENTTAL_IO imposes no limit on 
MAX_REC_SIZE. 

11. Implementation Limits 

The following limits are actually enforced by the implemen¬ 
tation. It is not intended to imply that resources up to or 
even near these limits are available to every program. 

11.1. Line Length 


C-11 







APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


The implementation supports a maximum line length of 500 
characters including the end of line character. 

11.2. Record and Array Sizes 

The maximum size of a statically sized array type is 
4,000,000 X STORAGEJUNITS. The maximum size of a statically 
sized record type is 4,000,000 x ST0RAGE_UN1TS. A record 
type or array type declaration that exceeds these limi,s 
will generate a warning message. 

11.3. Default Stack Size for Tasks 

In the 2 JDsence of an explicit ST0RAGE_SI2E length specifica¬ 
tion every task except the main program is allocated a fixed 
size stack of 10,240 STORAGE_UNITS. This is the value 
returned by T'STORAGE_SI2E for a task type T. 

11.4. Default Collection Size 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGE_SIZE length attribute 
the default collection size for an access type is 100 tiroes 
the size of the designated type. This is the value returned 
by T'ST0RAGE_SI2E for an access type T. 

11.5. Limit on Declared Objects 

There is ein absolute limit of 6,000,000 x STORAGE_UNITS for 
objects declared statically within a conpilation unit. If 
this value is exceeded the compiler will terminate the com¬ 
pilation of the unit with a FATAL error message.
