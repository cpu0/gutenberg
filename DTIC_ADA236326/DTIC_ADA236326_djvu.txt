1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: 

A, B, C, D. E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class 
to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B 
and class L tests are expected to produce errors at compile time and link 
time, respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result when they 
are exec ®d. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, 
and the p, ocedure CHECK FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT 
also provides a set of Identity functions used to defeat some compiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPOP.T and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately compiled units. Errors 
are expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC. certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values -- for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in Appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and 
implementation-dependent characteristics. Th^ modifications required for 
this implementation are described in section . 


1-2 



INTRODUCTION 


For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by the 
AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications described in 
the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see section 2.1) and, 
possibly some inapplicable tests (see Section 2.2 and (UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each test of 
the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are irrelevant 
for a given Ada implementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may 
be supported by documents issued by ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and commonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Commentaries are included as 
appropriate.

C35404D, C45231D, B86001X, C86006E, and CD7101G check for a predefined 
integer type with a name other than INTEGER, L0NG_INTEGER, or 
SH0RT_INTEGER. 

C35508I..J and C35508M..N (4 tests) include enumeration representation 
clauses for boolean types in which the specified values are other than 
(FALSE => 0, TRUE => 1); this implementation does not support a change 
in representation for boolean types. (See section 2.3.) 

C35713B, C45423B, B86001T, and C86006H check for the predefined type 
SH0RT_FL0AT. 

C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with a 
name other than FLOAT, L0NG_FL0AT, or SH0RT_FL0AT. 

C45423A, C45523A, and C45622A check that if MACHINE_0VERFL0US is TRUE 
and the results of various floating-point operations lie outside the 
range of the base type, then the proper exception is raised. For this 
implementation, MACHINE_0VERFL0US is FALSE. 

C45531M..P (4 tests) and C45532M..P (4 tests) check fixed-point 
operations for types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or 
greater; for this implementation, MAX_MANTISSA is less than 47. 

C86001F recompiles package SYSTEM, mal'.ir.j package TEXT_I0, and hence 
package REPORT, obsolete. For this implementation, the package TEXT_I0 
is dependent upon package SYSTEM. 

B86001Y checks for a predefined fixed-point type other than DURATION. 

C96005B checks for values of type DURATION'BASE that are outside the 
range of DURATION. There are no .'^uch values for this implementation. 


2-2 





IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


CA2009C, CA2009F, BC3204C, and BC3205D instantiate generic units before 
their bodies are compiled; this implementation creates a dependence on 
generic units as allowed by AI-00408 and AI-00530 such that the 
compilation of the generic unit bodies makes the instantiating units 
obsolete. 

LA3004A, LA3004B, EA3004C, EA3004D, CA3004E, and CA3004F check for 
pragma INLINE for procedures and functions. 

CD1009C uses a representation clause specifying a non-default size for a 
floating-point type. 

CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use representation 
clauses specifying non-default sizes for access types. 

BD8001A, BD8003A, BD8004A..B (2 tests), and AD8011A use machine code 
insertions. 

The tests listed in the following table are not applicable because the 
given file operations are supported for the given combination of mode

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


The following 16 tests check operations on sequential, direct, and text 
files when multiple internal files are associated with the same external 
file and one or more are open for writing; USEERROR is raised when this 
association is attempted. 

CE2107B..E CE2107G..H CE2107L CD2110B CE2110D 

CE2111D CE2111H CE3111B CE3111D..E CE3114B 

CE3115A 

CE2203A checks that URITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of the 
external file is exceeded for SEQUENTIAL_IO. This implementation does 
not restrict file capacity. 

CE2403A checks that URITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of the 
external file is exceeded for DIRECTIO. This implementation does not 
restrict file capacity. 

CE3413B checks that PAGE raises LAYOUT_ERROR when the value of the page 
number exceeds COLfNT'LAST. For this implementation, the value of 
COUNT'LAST is greater than 150000 making the checking of this objective 
impractical. 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 31 tests: 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
implementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the way 
expected by the original tests. 

BAIOOIA BA2001C BA2001E BA3006A BA3006B 

BA3007B BA3008A BA3008B BA3013A 


C35508I..J and C35508M..N (4 tests) were graded inapplicable by Evaluation 
Modification as directed by the AVO. These tests attempt to change the 
representation of a boolean type. The AVO ruled that, in consideration of 
the particular nature of boolean types and the operations that are defined 
for the type and for arrays of the type, a change of representation need 
not be supported; the ARG will address this issue in Commentary AI-00564. 


C52008B was graded passed by Test Modification'; as directed by the AVO. 
This test uses a record type with discriminants with defaults and that has 
array components whose size depends on the values of some discriminants of 
type INTEGER. On compilation of the type declaration, this implementation 
raises NUMERIC_ERR0R as it attempts to calculate the maximum possible size 
for objects of the type. Although this behavior is a violation of the Ada 
standard, the AVO ruled that the implemenra : inp he accented for validation 
in consideration of intended changes t''* :lie -fandaid to allow for 





IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


compile-time detection of run-time error conditions. The test was modified 
to constrain the subtype of the discriminants. Line 16 was modified to 
declare a constrained subtype of INTEGER, and discriminant declarations in 
lines 17 and 25 were modified to use that subtype; the lines are given 
below: 

16 SUBTYPE SUBINT IS INTEGER RANGE -128 .. 127; 

17 TYPE REC1(D1,D2 : SUBINT) IS 

25 TYPE REC2(D1,D2,D3,D4 : SUBINT := 0) IS 


CD1009A, CD1009I, CD1C03A, CD2A21C, CD2A24A, and CD2A31A..C (3 tests) were 
graded passed by Evaluation Modification as directed by the AVO. These 
tests use instantiations of the support procedure Length_Check, which uses 
UncheckedConversion according to the interpretation given in AI-00590. 

The AVO ruled that this interpretation is not binding under ACVC 1.11; the 
tests are ruled to be passed if they produce Failed messages only from the 
instances of Length_Check—i.e, the allowed Report.Failed messages have the 
general form: 


" * CHECK ON REPRESENTATION FOR <TYPE ID> FAILED." 


CE2103C..D (2 tests) were graded passed by Test Modification as directed by 
the AVO. These tests close an empty file; however, the IBM VM/SP HPO 
operating system does not allow an empty file to exist, so the file is 
deleted and USE_ERR0R is raised. The AVO ruled that this behavior is 
acceptable, given the operating system (cf. AI-00325); the AVO directed 
that the tests be modified and passed with the following write statement 
inserted into the two tests, respectively, at lines 56 and 55: 

WRITE (TEST_FILE_ONE, 'A'); 


EE3301B, EE3405B, and EE3410F were graded passed by Evaluation Modification 
as directed by the AVO. These tests check certain I/O operations on the 
current default output file, including standard output. This 
implementation outputs the ASCII form-feed character which has no effect on 
the standard IBM output devices; in general, there is no common form-feed 
mechanism for the devices. Thus, the printed output from this test did not 
contain the expected page breaks. The AVO ruled that these tests should be 
considered passed if none of the tests' internal checks was failed (i.e., 
if the tests report "TENTATIVELY PASSED").

Testing of this Ada implementation was conducted at the customer's site by 
a validation team from the AVF. 


3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming 
Language Standard, whether the test is applicable or inapplicable; 
otherwise, the Ada Implementation fails the [Pro90|. 


3-1 





PROCESSING INFORMATION 


For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard. 


a) Total Number of Applicable Tests 3772 

b) Total Number of Withdrawn Tests 83 

c) Processed Inapplicable Tests 114 

d) Non-Processed I/O Tests 0 

e) Non-Processed Floating-Point 

Precision Tests 201 

f) Total Number of Inapplicable Tests 315 


g) Total Number of Tests for ACVC 1.11 4170 

All I/O tests of the test suite were processed because this implementation 
supports a file system. The above number of floating-point tests were not 
processed because they used floating-point precision exceeding that 
supported by the implementation. When this compiler was tested, the tests 
listed in section 2.1 had been withdrawn because of test errors. 


3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

Version 1.11 of the ACVC comprises 4170 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, the tests listed in section 2.1 had been withdrawn because of test 
errors. The AVF determined that 315 tests were inapplicable to this 
implementation. All inapplicable tests were processed during validation 
testing except for 201 executable tests that use floating-point precision 
exceeding that supported by the implementation. In addition, the modified 
tests mentioned in section 2.3 were also processed. 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
tape were loaded directly onto the host computer. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host computer, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 


3-2 




PROCESSING INFORMATION 


Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the customer and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a complete listing of 
the processing options for this implementation. It also indicates the 
default options. The options invoked explicitly for validation testing 
during this test were: 


1. CLEAN 

2. ERROR(LIST) 

3. LIST(ERRl) 

4. RUN(TEXT) 


Test output, compiler and linker listings, and job logs were captured 
on magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined 
on-site by the validation team were also archived.

MACRO PARAMETERS 


This appendix contains the macro parameters used for customizing the ACVC. 
The meaning and purpose of these parameters are explained in [UG89). The 
parameter values are presented in two tables. The first table lists the 
values that are defined in terms of the maximum input-line length, which is 
the value for $MAX_IN_LEN—also listed here. These values are expressed 
here as Ada string aggregates, where "V" represents the maximum input-line 
length.

COMPILER OPTION INFORMATION 


"PKG370" is the command to invoke the compiler. The general format is; 
PGK370 dsname {options} 

options: 

CLEA.N 

ERROR(LIST) 

LIST(ERRI) 

RUN(TEXT) 


PKG370 COMMANT) 

The PKG370 command is used to compile more than one Ada source file in a single compilation 
session. The PKG370 command accepts either an Ada program file or a file which contains a 
filelist of files containing compilation units. 

Dsname specifies the file to be compiled. If ftype is not FILELIST, fname, ftype, and fmode is 
considered to be an Ada source file. 

The CLEAN option is used to erase all files derived from a compilation after a main program 
has completed compilation and execution. These files include object files, listing files, error files, 
and execution produced files. 

The ERROR(LIST) option creates a listing file only when errors are encountered. The file 
contains compile-time error messages interspersed with the source code. 

The LIST(ERRI) option produces a compilation source listing. Semantic errors, syntax errors, 
and warnings are interspersed. 

The RUN(TEXT) option causes the program to load and execute. It is assumed that the 
program displays the results on the console. The output of the entire compilation and execution 
is copied to a dataset. This dataset is examined to determine whether the program was executed 
successfully. The possible results are: 

PASSED== Indicates the program passed 

FAILED** Indicates the program failed 

NOT-APPLICABLE-k-f Implies the program peissed 
This is compatible with the error reporting used by AC VC tests. 



APPENDIX C 

APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


The only allowed implementation dependencies correspond to 
implementation-dependent pragmas, to certain machine-dependent conventions 
as mentioned in Chapter 13 of the Ada Standard, and to certain allowed 
restrictions on representation clauses. The implementation-dependent 
characteristics of this Ada implementation, as described in this Appendix, 
are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted otherwise, 
references in this Appendix are to compiler documentation and not to this 
report. Implementation-specific portions of the package STANDARD, which 
are not a part of Appendix F, are:

ATTACHMENT A 
APPENDIX F 

OF THE LANGI’AOE REFERENCE MANUAL 


Th< A(ia laiiguagi' dofinilioii allows for certain target dependencies in a controlled manner. 
This section, called .Appendix F as prescribed in tlie LR.\1. de.scribes implementatioii-dependent 
characteristics of the 11F\1 .Ada .''>70, \ ersion 1.1.0 running under C.NIS or .\1\’S. 

1. Implementation-Defined Pragmas 

I’R.AGMA I.\TERF'ACE( .Assernblt. subroutine name • ); 

PR.AC.ALA L\TERF.ACE( -Assembler, '.subroutine name:- ); 

PR.ACM.A INTERF .ACE( F ortran, subroutine name ■ ); 

PRAGMA SEPPRESS_ALL-, 

to cause F^ragma SUPF’RESS to be invoked simultaneously for all tfie following 
condition names: access check, discriminant check. index check. length check, 

division check. elaboration_check, and storage_check. 

PRAGMA .NO_SUPPRESS ( <identifier> ); 

to prevent the suppression of checks within a particular scofte. Particularly useful when a 
section of code that relies upon predefined checks executes correctly, but, for performance 
reasons, the suppression of checks in the rest of the code is needed. 

PRAGMA CONLMENT (string literal); 

embeds string literal into object code. 

PR.AGMA IMAGES (enumeration type, <immediate>l <deferred>); 

generates a table of iniages for the enumeration type, deferred causes the table to be 
generated only if the enumeration type is used in a compilation unit. 

PRAG.ALA INTERFACE INFORNUTION 

(<;name>, 

<link name>, 

< mechanism >, 

''parameters.'-, 

^clobbered regs>); 

when used in association with pragma I.NTERFACE, vvill provide access to any routine 
whose name can be specified by an -Ada string literal. 

PR.Afi.M.A PRESERN'E LAYOUT ( ON => <Record_Type_Name> ); 

forces the compiler to maintain the Ada source order of components of a given record type, 
thereby preventing the compiler from performing this record layout optimization. 

•PRAGMA OS TASK (priority); 

to specify the relative urgency of each MVS task created. 

•PRAGMA ALLOCATION DATA 





25C)C’T90 


Page -S- 


(< access type.-, 

< residence mode ■. 

-allocation duration.', 

• subpool number>. 

• discrete user data'); 

to associate M\'S virtual storage attributes with an Ada access type. 

Note that l’R.\GMA OS TASK and PR,\GMA ALLOCATIO.N DATA are effective only when 
compiling for an M\ S target. Both pragmas require that an MVS runtime be present. 


2. Implementation-Defined Attributes 

2.1. Integer Type Attributes 

Extended Image ( Item, <\Vidth>, <.Base>, <B£ised>, <Space IF Positive> ); 

to return the image associated with Item as defined '• . . integer lO. The Text lO 

definition stales that the value of Item is an in*e-( ln.cru.i with no underlines, no exponent, 
no leading zeroes (but a single zero for t’., .tero value), and a minus sign if negative. 

Extended \alue (Item); 

to return the value associated with Item as ibText IO.Integer lO. The Text_IO 
definition states that given a string, it reads an integer value from the beginning of the 
string. The value returned corresponds to the sequence input. 

Extended Width ( <Base>, <Based>, <Space IF_Positive> ); 
to return the width for a subtype specified. 

2.2. Enumeration Type Attributes 

Extended Image ( Item , < Width>, <Uppercase>); 

to return the image associated with Item as defined in Text IO.Enumeration lO. The 
Text 10 definition states that given an enumeration literal, it will output the value of the 
enumeration literal (either an identifier or a character literal). The character case 
parameter is ignored for character literals. 

Extended Value ( Item ); 

to return the image associated with Item as defined in Text lO.Enumeration lO. The 
Text lO definition states that it reads an enumeration value from the beginning of the given 
string and returns the value of the enumeration literal that corresponds to the sequence 
input. 

Extended Width; 

to return the width for a specified subtype. 

2.3. Floating Point Attributes 

Extended Image ( Item, <Fore>, <Aft>, <Exp>, <Base>, <Based> ); 

to return the image associated with Item as defined in Text IO.Float lO. The Text IO 
definition states that it outputs the value of the parameter Item as a decimal literal with 
the format defined by the other parameters. If the value is negative, a minus sign is 
included in the integer part of the value of Item. If Exp is 0, the integer part of the output 






25OCT90 


Page -4 


has as many digits as are needed to represent the integer part of the value of Item or is zero 
if the value of Item has no integer part. 

Extended \'alue ( Item ); 

to return the .aiue associated with Item as defined in Text lO.Float lO. The Text lO 
definition states that it skips any leading zeroes, then reads a plus or minus sign if present, 
then reads the string according to the syntax of a real literal. The return value is that 
which corresponds to the sequence input. 

Extended Digits ( ;.Base> ): 

to return the number of digits using base in the mantissa of model numbers of the specified 
subty {>e. 

2.4. Fixed Point Attributes 

Extended lmage ( Item, <Fore>. <Afl>, <Exp>, <Base>, <Based> ); 

to return the image associated with hem as defined in Text lO.Fixed lO. The Text lO 
definition slates that it outputs the value of the parameter Item as a decimal literal with 
the format defined by the other parameters. If the value is negative, a minus sign is 
included in the integer part of the value of Item. If Exp is 0, the integer part of the output 
has as many digits as are needed to represent the integer part of the value of Item or is zero 
if the value of Item has no integer part. 

Exlended_Value ( Image ); 

to return the value associated with Item as defined in Text_I0.Fixed_10. The Text_IO 
definition states that it skips any leading zeroes, reads a plus or minus sign if present, then 
reads the string according to the syntax of a real literal. The return value is that which 
corresponds to the sequence input. 

Extended_Fore ( <Base>, <Based> ); 

to return the minimum number of characters required for the integer part of the based 
representation specified. 

Extended Aft ( <Base>, <Based> ); 

to return the minimum number of characters required for the fractional part of the based 
representation specified.

4. Representation Clauses 

This implementation supports address, length, enumeration, and record representation 
clauses with the following exceptions: 

Address clauses are not supported for package, for entry, for tasktype, for 
subprograms. 

Enumeration clauses are not supported for boolean representation clauses. 

The size in bits of representation specified records is rounded up to the next highest multiple 
of 8. meaning that the object of a representation specified record with 25 bits will actually occupy 
32 bits. 

Non-supported clauses are rejected at compile time. 

5. Implementation-Generated Names 

There are no implementation-generated names denoting implementation-dependent 
components. Names generated by the compiler shall not interfere with programmer-defined 
names. 

6. Address Clause Expression Interpretation 

Expressions that appear in Address clauses are interpreted as virtual memory addresses. 

7. Unchecked Conversion Restrictions 

Unchecked Conversion is allowed except when the target data subtype is an unconstrained 
array or record type. If the size of the source and target are static and equal, the compiler will 
perform a bitwise copy of data from the source object to the target object. 

Where the sizes of source and target differ, the following rules will apply: 

• If the size of the source is greater than the size of the target, the high address bits will 
be truncated in the conversion. 




25OCT90 


Page -7- 


• If the size of the source is less than the size of the target, the source will be moved into 
the low address bits of the target. 

The compiler will issue a warning when Unchecked Conversion is instantiated with unequal 
sizes for source and target subtype. Unchecked Conversion between objects of different or non¬ 
static sizes will usually produce less efficient code and should be avoided, if possible. 

8. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics of the I/O Packages 

• Sequential lO, Direct lO, and Text lO are supported. 

• Low Level lO is not supported. 

• Unconstrained array types and unconstrained types with discriminants may not be 
instantiated for I/O. 

• File names follow the conventions and restrictions of the target operating system. 

• In Text lO, the type Field is defined as follows: subtype Field is integer range 

0 .. 1000 ; ^ 

• In Text lO, the type Count is defined as follows: type Count is range 
0..2 147 483 646;
