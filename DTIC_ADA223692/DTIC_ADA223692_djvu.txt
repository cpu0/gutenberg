CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 



This Validation Summary Report (VSR) describes the extent to which a specific Ada compiler 
conforms to the Ada Standard, ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A. This report explains all technical terms 
used within it and thoroughly reports the results of testing this compiler using the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability^(ACVCJ> An Ada compiler must be implemented according to the Ada 
Standard, and any implementation-dependent features must conform to the requirements of the 
Ada Standard. The Ada Standard must be implemented in its entirety, and nothing can be 
implemented that is not in the Standard. ) 


Even though all validated Ada compilers conform to the Ada Standard, it must be understood that 
some differences do exist between implementations. The Ada Standard permits some 
implementation dependencies -- for example, the maximum length of identifiers or the maximum 
values of integer types. Other differences between compilers result from the characteristics of 
particular operating systems, hardware, or implementation strategies. All the dependencies 
observ e d during th e - pr ocess-of testing this compiler are given in this report. 


The information in this report is derived from the test results produced during validation testing. 
The validation process includes submitting a suite of standardized tests, the ACVC, as inputs to an 
Ada compiler and evaluating the results." The purpose of validating is to ensure conformity of the 
compiler to the Ada Standard by testing \that the compiler properly implements legal language 
constructs and that it identifies and rejects! illegal language constructs. The testing also identifies 
behavior that is implementation dependent but is permitted by the Ada Standard. Six classes of 
tests are used. These tests are designed to perform checks at compile time, at link time, and 
during execution. '-w _ ___ ___ .

1.1 PURPOSE OF THIS VALIDATION SUMMARY REPORT 


This VSR documents the results of the validation testing performed on an Ada compiler. Testing 
was carried out for :he following purposes: 

o To attempt to identify any language constructs supported by the compiler that do 
not conform to the Ada Standard 

o To attempt to identify any language constructs not supported by the compiler but 
required by the Ada Standard 

o To determine that the implementation-dependent behavior is allowed by the Ada 
Standard 


Testing of this compiler was conducted by The National Computer Centre Limited according to 
procedures established by the Ada Joint Program Office and administered by the Ada Validation

INTRODUCTION 


Target The computer which executes the code generated by the compiler. 

Test A program that checks a compiler’s conformity regarding a 

particular feature or a combination of features to the Ada Standard. 
In the context of this report, the term is used to designate a single 
test, which may comprise one or more files. 

Withdrawn test An ACVC test found to be incorrect and not used to check 

conformity to the Ada Standard. A test may be incorrect because 
it has an invalid test objective, fails to meet its test objective, or 
contains illegal or erroneous use of the language. 


L5 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conformity to the Ada Standard is measured using the ACVC. The ACVC contains both legal and 
illegal Ada programs structured into six test classes: A B, C, D, E and L. The first letter of a 
test name identifies the class to which it belongs. Class A,C,D and E tests are executable, and 
special program units are used to report their results during execution. Class B tests are expected 
to produce compilation errors. Class L tests are expected to produce errors because of the way 
in which a program library is used at link time. 

Class A tests ensure the successful compilation and execution of legal Ada programs with certain 
language constructs which cannot be verified at run time. There are no explicit program 
components in a Class A test to check semantics. For example, a Class A test checks that reserved 
words of another language (other than those already reserved in *he Ada language) are not treated 
as reserved words by an Ada compiler. A Class A test is passed if no errors are detected at 
compile time and the program executes to produce a PASSED message. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class B tests are not executable. 
Each test in this class is compiled and the resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that 
every syntax or semantic error in the test is detected. A Class B test is passed if every illegal 
construct that it contains is detected by the compiler. 

Class C tests check the run time system to ensure that legal Ada programs can be correctly 
compiled and executed. Each Class C test is self-checking and produces a PASSED, FAILED, or 
NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result when it is executed. 

Class D tests check the compilation and execution capacities of a compiler. Since there are no 
capacity requirements placed on a compiler by the Ada Standard for some parameters - for 
example, the number of identifiers permitted in a compilation or the number of units in a library - 
- a compiler may refuse to compile a Class D test and still be a conforming compiler. Therefore, 
if a Class D test fails to compile because the capacity of the compiler is exceeded, the test is 
classified as inapplicable. If a Class D test compiles successfully, it is self-checking and produces 
a PASSED or FAILED message during execution.

INTRODUCTION 


Class E tests are expected to execute successfully and check implementation-dependent options and 
resolutions of ambiguities in the Ada Standard. Each Class E test is self-checking and produces 
a NOT APPLICABLE, PASSED, or FAILED message when it is compiled and executed. 
However, the Ada Standard permits an implementation to reject programs containing some features 
addressed by Class h tests during compilation. Therefore, a Class E test is passed by a compiler 
if it is compiled successfully and executes to produce a PASSED message, or if it is rejected by the 
compiler for an allowable reason. 

Class L tests check that incomplete or illegal Ada programs involving multiple, separately compiled 
units are detected and not allowed to execute. Class L tests are compiled separately and execution 
is attempted. A Class L test passes if it is rejected at link time -- that is, an attempt to execute 
the main program must generate an error message before any declarations in the main program 
or any units referenced by the main program are elaborated. In some cases, an implementation 
may legitimately detect errors during compilation of the test. 

Two library units, the package REPORT and the procedure CHECK_FILE, support the self- 
checking features of the executable tests. The package REPORT provides the mechanism by which 
executable tests report PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE results. It also provides a set 
of identity functions used to defeat some compiler optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that 
would circumvent a test objective. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada Standard. The operation 
of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of executable tests. These tests produce 
messages that are examined to verify that the units are operating correctly. If these units are not 
operating correctly, then the validation is not attempted. 

The text of each test in the ACVC follows conventions that are intended to ensure that the tests 
are reasonably portable without modification. For example, the tests make use of only the basic 
set of 55 characters, contain lines with a maximum length of 72 characters, use small numeric 
values, and place features that may not be supported by all implementations in separate tests. 
However, some tests contain values that require the test to be customized according to 
implementation-specific values -- for example, an illegal file name. A list of the values used for 
this validation is provided in Appendix C. 

A compiler must correctly process each of the tests in the suite and demonstrate conformity to the 
Ada Standard by either meeting the pass criteria given for the test or by showing that the test is 
inapplicable to the implementation. The applicability of a test to an implementation is considered 
each time the implementation is validated. A test that is inapplicable for one validation is not 
necessarily inapplicable for a subsequent validation. Any test that was determined to contain an 
illegal language construct or an erroneous language construct is withdrawn from the ACVC and, 
therefore, is not used in testing a compiler. The tests withdrawn at the time of this validation 
are given in Appendix D.

CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


22 IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS 

One of the purposes of validating compilers is to determine the behavior of a compiler in those 
areas of the Ada Standard that permit implementations to differ. Class D and E tests specifically 
check for such implementation differences. However, tests in other classes also characterize an 
implementation. The tests demonstrate the following characteristics: 

a. Capacities. 

(1) The compiler correctly processes a compilation containing 723 variables in the 
same declarative part. (See test D29002K.) 

(2) The compiler correctly processes tests containing loop statements nested to 65 
levels. (See tests D55A03A..H (8 tests).) 

(3) The compiler correctly processes tests containing block statements nested to 65 
levels. (See test D56001B.) 

(4) The compiler correctly processes tests containing recursive procedures separately 
compiled as subunits nested to 17 levels. (See tests D64005E..G (3 tests).) 

b. Predefined types. 

(1) This implementation supports the additional predefined types SHORT_INTEGER 
and LONG_FLOAT in the package STANDARD. (See tests B86001T..Z (7 tests).) 

c. Based literals. 

(1) An implementation is allowed raise NUMERIC ERROR or 
CONSTRAINT ERROR when a value exceeds SYSTEM.MAXJNT. This 
implementation raises NUMERIC_ERROR during execution. (See test E24201A.) 

d. Expression evaluation. 

The order in which expressions are evaluated and the time at which constraints are checked 

are not defined by the language. While the ACVC tests do not specifically attempt to 

determine the order of evaluation of expressions, test results indicate the following: 

(1) None of the default initialization expressions for record components are evaluated 
before any value is checked for membership in a component’s subtype. (See test 
C32117A.) 

(2) Assignments for subtypes are performed with the same precision as the base type. 
(See test C35712B.) 


Validation Summary Report AVF-VSR-90502/50 

Alsys Limited Al*yCOMP_017 V4.0 Chapter 2 • Page 2 of 6 









CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(3) This implementation uses no extra bits for extra precision and uses all extra bits 
for extra range. (See test C35903A.) 

(4) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when an integer literal operand in a comparison or 
membership test is outside the range of the base type. (See test C45232A.) 

(5) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when a literal operand in a fixed-point comparison 
or membership test is outside the range of the base type. (See test C45252A.) 

(6) Underflow is gradual. (See tests C45524A..Z (26 tests).) 

e. Rounding. 

The method by which values are rounded in type conversions is not defined by the 
language. While the ACVC tests do not specifically attempt to determine the method of 
rounding, the test results indicate the following. 

(1) The method used for rounding to integer is round to even. (See tests C46012A..Z 
(26 tests).) 

(2) The method used for rounding to longest integer is round to even. (See tests 
C46012A..Z (26 tests).) 

(3) The method used for rounding to integer in static universal real expressions is 
round to even. (See test C4A014A.) 

f. Array types. 

An implementation is allowed to raise NUMERIC_ERROR or CONSTRAINT_ERROR 
for an array having a ’LENGTH that exceeds STANDARD.INTEGER’LAST and/or 
SYSTEM.MAX_INT. For this implementation: 

(1) Declaration of an array type or subtype declaration with more than 
SYSTEM.MAX_INT components raises NUMERICJERROR. (See test C36003A.) 

(2) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised when an array type with INTEGER’LAST + 2 
components is declared. (See test C36202A.) 

(3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised when an array type with SYSTEM.MAX_INT 
+ 2 components is declared. (See test C36202B.) 

(4) A packed BOOLEAN array having a ’LENGTH exceeding INTEGER’LAST raises 
CONSTRAINTJERROR when the array type is declared. (See test C52103X.) 

(5) A packed two-dimensional BOOLEAN array with more than INTEGER’LAST 
components raises CONSTRAINT ERROR when the array type is declared. (See 
test C52104Y.)

Alsys Limited AbyCOMP_017 V4.0 


Chapter 2 • Page 3 of 6 








CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(6) In assigning one-dimensional array types, the expression is evaluated in its entirety 
before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised when checking whether the expression’s 
subtype is compatible with the target’s subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

(7) In assigning two-dimensional array types, the expression is not evaluated in its 
entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised when checking whether the 
expression’s subtype is compatible with the target’s subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

g. A null array with one dimension of length greater than INTEGER’LAST may raise 

NUMERIC_ERROR or CONSTRAINT_ERROR either when declared or assigned. 

Alternatively, an implementation may accept the declaration. However, lengths must match 

in array slice assignments. This implementation raises CONSTRAINT ERROR when the 

array type is declared. (See test E52103Y.) 

h. Discriminated types. 

(1) In assigning record types with discriminants, the expression is evaluated in its 
entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised when checking whether the 
expression’s subtype is compatible with the target’s subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

i. Aggregates. 

(1) In the evaluation of a multi-dimensional aggregate, the test results indicate that all 
choices are evaluated before checking against the index type. (See tests C43207A 
and C43207B.) 

(2) In the evaluation of an aggregate containing subaggregates, not all choices are 
evaluated before being checked for identical bounds. (See test E43212B.) 

(3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised after all choices are evaluated when a bound in 
a non-null range of a non-null aggregate does not belong to an index subtype. (See 
test E43211B.) 

j. Pragmas. 

(1) The pragma INLINE is supported for functions or procedures calls within a body. 
The program INLINE for function calls with a declarative part is not supported. 
(See tests LA3004A..B (2 tests), EA3004C..D (2 tests), and CA3004E..F (2 tests).) 

k. Generics. 

(1) Generic specifications and bodies can be compiled in separate compilations. (See 
tests CA1012A, CA2009C, CA2009F, BC3204C. and BC3205D.) 

(2) Generic subprogram declarations and bodies can be compiled in separate 
compilations. (See tests CA1012A and CA2009F.)

Version 1.10 of the ACVC comprises 3717 tests. When this compiler was tested, 44 tests had been 
withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF determined that 390 tests were inapplicable to this 
implementation. All inapplicable tests were processed during validation testing except for 201 
executable tests that use floating-point precision exceeding that supported by the implementation. 
Modifications to the code, processing, or grading for 42 tests were required to successfully 
demonstrate the test objective. (See section 3.6.) 

The AVF concludes that the testing results demonstrate acceptable conformity to the Ada Standard.

See Appendix D for the reason that each of these tests was withdrawn. 


3.5 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 


Some tests do not apply to all compilers because they make use of features that a compiler is not 
required by the Ada Standard to support. Others may depend on the result of another test that 
is either inapplicable or withdrawn. The applicability of a test to an implementation is considered 
each time a validation is attempted. A test that is inapplicable for one validation attempt is not 
necessarily inapplicable for a subsequent attempt. For this validation attempt, 390 tests were 
inapplicable for the reasons indicated: 


a. 


The following 201 tests are not applicable because they have floating-point type declarations 
requiring more digits than SYSTEM.MAX_DIGITS: 


C24113L..Y (14 tests) 
C35707L..Y (14 tests) 
C45241L..Y (14 tests) 
C45521L..Z (15 tests) 
C45641L..Y (14 tests) 


C35705L..Y (14 tests) 
C35708L..Y (14 tests) 
C45321L..Y (14 tests) 
C45524L..Z (15 tests) 
C46012L..Z (15 tests) 


C35706L..Y (14 tests) 
C35802L..Z (15 tests) 
C45421L..Y (14 tests) 
C45621L..Z (15 tests) 


b. C35702A and B86001T are not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined type SHORT_FLOAT. 

c. The following 16 tests are not applicable because this implementation does not support a 
predefined type LONG_INTEGER: 


C45231C 

C45304C 

C45502C 

C45503C 

C45504C 

C45504F 

C45611C 

C45613C 

C45614C 

C45631C 

C45632C 

B52004D 

C55B07A 

B55B09C 

B86001W 


CD7101F 

d. C45531M..P (4 tests) and C45532M..P (4 tests) are inapplicable because the size of a 
mantissa of a fixed point type is limited to 31 bits.

TEST INFORMATION 


e. C86001F is not applicable because, for this implementation, the package TEXT_IO is 
dependent upon package SYSTEM. These tests recompile package SYSTEM, making 
package TEXT_IO, and hence package REPORT, obsolete. 

f. B86001X, C45231D, and CD7101G are not applicable because this implementation does 
not support any predefined integer type with a name other than INTEGER, 
LONG_INTEGER, or SHORTJNTEGER. 

g. B86001Y is not applicable because this implementation supports no predefined fixed-point 
type other than DURATION. 

h. B86001Z is not applicable because this implementation supports no predefined floating¬ 
point type with a name other than FLOAT, LONG_FLOAT, or SHORT_FLOAT. 

i. CD1009C, CD2A41A..E (5 tests) and CD2A42A..J (10 tests) are not applicable because the 
SIZE clause on type FLOAT is not supported by this implementation. 

j. The following 26 tests are inapplicable because for this implementation a length clause on 
a type derived from a private type is not supported outside the defined package. 

CD1C04A CD2A21C..D (2 tests) CD2A22C..D (2 tests) 

CD2A22G..H (2 tests) CD2A31C..D (2 tests) CD2A32C..D (2 tests) 

CD2A32G..H (2 tests) CD2A51C..D (2 tests) CD2A52C..D (2 tests) 

CD2A52G..H (2 tests) CD2A53D CD2A54D 

CD2A54H CD2A72A..B (2 tests) CD2A75A..B (2 tests) 

k. CD1C04B, CD1C04E, CD4051A..B (2 tests) and CD4051C..D (2 tests) are not applicable 
because this implementation does not support representation clauses in derived records or 
derived tasks. 

l. The following 25 tests are inapplicable because a LENGTH clause on an array or record 
would require a change to the representation of the components or elements. 

CD2A61A..D (4 tests) CD2A61F CD2A61H..L (5 tests) 

CD2A62A..C (3 tests) CD2A71A.D (4 tests) CD2A72C..D (2 tests) 

CD2A74A..D (4 tests) CD2A75C..D (2 tests) 

m. CD2A84B..I (8 tests) and CD2A84K..L (2 tests) are not applicable because the ’SIZE clause 
applied to the access type is less than the minimum (32 bits) required. 

n. The following 30 tests are inapplicable because an ADDRESS clause for a constant is not 


supported.

TEST INFORMATION 


ao. CE3202A requires association of a name with the standard input/output files, but this is not 
supported by this implementation which raises USE_ERROR. This behaviour is accepted 
by the AVO pending a ruling by the language maintenance body. 

ap. CE3605A is inapplicable because this test attempts to output a string of 517 characters 
which exceeds the maximum allowed for this implementation. 

M TEST. PROCESSING. AND EVALUATION MODIFICATIONS 

It is expected that some tests will require modifications of code, processing, or evaluation in order 
to compensate for legitimate implementation behavior. Modifications are made by the AVF in 
cases where legitimate implementation behavior prevents the successful completion of an 
(otherwise) applicable test. Examples of such modifications include: adding a length clause to alter 
the default size of a collection; splitting a Class B test into subtests so that all errors are detected; 
and confirming that messages produced by an executable test demonstrate conforming behavior that 
was not anticipated by the test (such as raising one exception instead of another). 

Modifications were required for 42 tests. 


The following tests were split because syntax errors 
detecting other errors in the test: 

at one point 

resulted in i 

B23004A

The following tests 

were split to prove the not-applicability criteria: 


CD2A62A

CD2A72A 

CD2A72B 

CD2A75A 

CD2A75B 

CD2A84B

CD2A84D 

CD2A84E 

CD2A84F 

CD2A84G 

CD2A84H 

CD2A84I 



EA3004D, when processed, produces only two of the expected three errors: the implementation 
fails to detect an error on line 27 of file EA3004D6M. This is because the pragma INLINE has 
no effect when its object is within a package specification. The task was reordered to compile 
files D2 and D3 after file D5 (the re-compilation of the "with"ed package that makes the various 
earlier units obsolete), the re-ordered test executed and produced the expected 
NOT_APPLICABLE result (as though INLINE were not supported at all). The re-ordering of 
EA3004D test files was: 0-1-4-5-2-3-6. The AVO ruled that the test should be counted as passed.

TEST INFORMATION 


3.7.1 Prevalidation 

Prior to validation, a set of test results for ACVC Version 1.10 produced by the AlsyCOMP_017 
V4.0 compiler was submitted to the AVF by the applicant for review. Analysis f these results 
demonstrated that the compiler successfully passed all applicable tests, and the compiler exhibited 
the expected behavior on all inapplicable tests. 


j 

3.7.2 Test Method 


Testing of the AIsyCOMP_017 V4.0 compiler using ACVC Version 1.10 was conducted on-site by 
a validation team from the AVF. The configuration in which the testing was performed is 
described by the following designations of hardware and software components: 


Host computer 
Host operating system 
Target computer 


Compiler 

Pre-linker 

Linker 

Loader/Downloader 
Runtime System 


: MicroVAX II 
: MicroVMS V4.7 

: INMOS T800 implemented on a B403 TRAM 
(bare), using the Host running INMOS Iserver V1.30 
for file-server support 
: AIsyCOMP 017 V4.0 
: AIsyCOMP~017 V4.0 
: IMS D605A ILINK V2.0.2 
: IMS D605A IBOOT Vl.0.3 
: AlsyCOMP_017 V4.0 


The host and target computers were linked via CAPLIN QTO Board. 

A magnetic tape containing all tests except for withdrawn tests and tests requiring unsupported 
floating-point precisions was taken on-site by the validation team for processing. Tests that make 
use of implementation-specific values were customized before being written to the magnetic tape. 
Tests requiring modifications during the prevalidation testing were not included in their modified 
form on the magnetic tape. 

The contents of the magnetic tape were not loaded directly onto the host computer, but loaded on 
to a hard disc via a VAX 11/780. The disc was then manually swiched to allow the MicroVAX to 
access the test files. 

After the test files were loaded to disk, the full set of tests was compiled and linked on the 
MicroVAX, then all executable images were transferred to the INMOS T800 via the CAPLINK and 
run. Results were transfered from the host computer to the VAX 11/750 via FTP software from 
where they were printed. 

The compiler was tested using command scripts provided by Alsys Limited and reviewed by the 
validation team. The compiler was tested using all the following default option settings:

Tests were compiled, linked, and executed (as appropriate) using a single host and target computer. 
Test output, compilation listings, and job logs were captured on magnetic media and archived at 
the AVF. The listings examined on-site by the validation team were also archived. 


3.7.3 Test Site 

Testing was conducted at Alsys Limited, Partridge House, Newtown Road, Henley-on-Thames, 
Oxfordshire, RG9 IEN, UNITED KINGDOM and was completed on 31 May 1989.

Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


This appendix summarizes the implementation-dependent characteristics of the Alsys 
Ada Compilers for the 1NMOS transputer. This document should be considered as the 
Appendix F to the Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language ANSI/MIL- 
STD 1815A, January 1983, as appropriate to the Alsys Ada implementation for the 
transputer. 

Sections 1 to 8 of this appendix correspond to the various items of information required 
in Appendix F [Fj*; section 9 provides other information relevant to the Alsys 
implementation. The contents of all these sections is described below: 

1. The form, allowed places, and effect of every implementation-dependent 
pragma. 

2. The name and type of every implementation-dependent attribute. 

3. The specification of the package SYSTEM [13.7], 

4. The list of all restrictions on representation clauses [13.1]. 

5. The conventions used for any implementation-generated names denoting 
implementation-dependent components [13.4], 

6. The interpretation of expressions that appear in address clauses, including 
those for interrupts [13.5]. 

7. Any restrictions on unchecked conversions [13.10.2]. 

8. Any implementation-dependent characteristics of the input-output packages 

I14J. 

9. Characteristics of numeric types. 

Throughout this appendix, the name Ada Run-Time Executive refers to the run-time 
library routines provided for all Ada programs. These routines implement the Ada heap, 
exceptions, tasking control, I/O, and other utility functions.

Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 


1.1 INLINE 

Pragma INLINE [6.3.2] is fully supported, except for the fact that it is not possible to 
inline a function call in a declarative part. 


1.2 INTERFACE 

Ada programs can interface to subprograms written in OCCAM through the use of the 
predefined pragma INTERFACE [13.9] and the implementation-defined pragma 
INTERFACE_NAME. 

Pragma INTERFACE specifies the name of an interfaced subprogram and the name of 
the programming language for which calling and parameter passing conventions will be 
generated. Pragma INTERFACE takes the form specified in the Reference Manual: 

pragma INTERFACE (language _name, subprogram_name); 

where: 

a language_name is the name of the other language whose calling and 
parameter passing conventions are to be used. 

a subprogram_name is the name used within the Ada program to refer to the 
interfaced subprogram. 

Th>.-; only language name currently accepted by pragma INTERFACE is OCCAM. 

The language name used in the pragma INTERFACE does not necessarily correspond to 
the language used to write the interfaced subprogram. It is used only to tell the 
Compiler how to generate subprogram calls, that is, which calling conventions and 
parameter passing techniques to use. 

The language name OCCAM is used to refer to the standard OCCAM calling and 
parameter passing conventions for the transputer. The programmer can use the language 
name OCCAM to interface Ada subprograms with subroutines written in any language 
that follows the standard OCCAM calling conventions. 


1.2.1 Calling Conventions 

The following calling conventions are required for code to be interfaced to Ada by use 
of the pragma interface to OCCAM. 

On entry to the subprogram, the registers A, B and C are undefined. For the T8 only, 
the floating point registers FA, FB and FC are similarly undefined. The return address 
and any parameters are accessed relative to the workspace pointer, W. 


2 


Alsys transputer Ada Compiler, Appendix F, v4.0 



There are no assumptions concerning the register contents upon return from the 
interfaced subprogram, other than for interfaced subprograms which are functions (see 
below). 


1.2.2 Parameter-Passing Conventions 

On entry to the subprogram, the first word above the transputer workspace pointer 
contains the return address of the called subprogram. Subsequent workspace locations 
(from W+l to W+n, where n is the number of parameters) contain the subprograms 
parameters, which are all one word in length. 

There is always an implicit vector space parameter passed as the last parameter to all 
interfaced subprograms. This points to an area of free memory for use by the OCCAM 
compiler in allocating arrays declared in the interfaced subprogram. 

Formal parameters of mode in which are access types or scalars of one machine word or 
less in size are passed by copy. If such a parameter is less that one machine word in 
length it is sign extended to a full word. For ail other parameters the value passed is the 
address of the actual parameter itself. 

When passing arrays to OCCAM, it may be the case that some of its strides (dimensions) 
are undefined in the source of the interfaced subprogram. If this is true, the missing 
strides should be passed as extra integer value parameters to the subprogram. These 
parameters should be placed immediately following the array parameter itself and in the 
same order as the missing strides appear in the OCCAM source. 

Since all large scalar, non-scalar and non-access parameters to interfaced subprograms 
are passed by address, they cannot be protected from modification by the called 
subprogram even though they may be formally declared to be of mode in. It is the 
programmer’s responsibility to ensure that the semantics of the Ada parameter modes are 
honoured in these cases. 

If the subprogram is a function whose result is at most one machine word in length, 
register A is used to return the result. All other results are returned by address in an 
implicit parameter allocated before the list of normal parameters (i.e. in the first word 
after the return address, at W+I). 

No consistency checking is performed between the subprogram parameters declared in 
Ada and the corresponding parameters of the interfaced subprogram. It is the 
programmer’s responsibility to ensure correct access to the parameters. 


1.2.3 Parameter Representations 


This section describes the representation of values of the types that can be passed as 
parameters to an interfaced subprogram. The discussion assumes no representation 
clauses have been used to alter the default representations of the types involved. 
Chapter 4 describes the effect of representation clauses on the representation of values. 


Appendix F. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 



Integer Types [3.5.4] 


Ada integer types are represented in two's complement form and occupy a byte 
(SHORT_INTEGER), a word (INTEGER) or a double word (LONG_INTEGER). 
Parameters to interfaced subprograms of type SHORT_INTEGER are passed by copy in 
a full machine word. The value occupies the low order byte of the word; the other 
bytes in the word are always zero. Values of type INTEGER are always passed by copy. 
The predefined type LONG_INTEGER is available for T2 transputer targets only; 
values of this type are stored least significant word first and are always passed by 
address. 


Enumeration Tvnes [3.5.1] 

Values of an Ada enumeration type are represented internally as unsigned values 
representing their position in the list of enumeration literals defining the type. The first 
literal in the list corresponds to a value of zero. 

Enumeration types with 256 elements or fewer are represented in 8 bits. For T2 
transputer targets, those with between 257 and 65536 (2**16) elements are represented in 
16 bits (i.e. a word). All others enumeration types are represented in 32 bits. The 
maximum number of values an enumeration type can include is 2**31. 

Consequently, the Ada predefined type CHARACTER [3.5.2] is represented in 8 bits, 
using the standard ASCII codes [C] and the Ada predefined type BOOLEAN [3.5.3] is 
represented in 8 bits, w ; th FALSE represented by the value 0, and TRUE represented 
by the value 1. 

As the representation of enumeration types is basically the same that of integers, the 
same parameter passing conventions apply. 


Floating Point Types (3.5.7, 3.5.8] 

Ada fioating-point values occupy 32 (FLOAT) or 64 (LONG_FLOAT) bits, and are held 
in ANSI/IEEE 754 floating point format. 


Fixed Point Types [3.5.9. 3.5.10] 

Ada fixed-point types are managed by the Compiler as the product of a signed mantissa 
and a constant small. The mantissa is implemented as an 8, 16 or 32 bit integer value 
for T2 transputer targets and as an 8 or 32 bit integer value for T4 and T8 transputer 
targets. Small is a compile-time quantity which is the power of two equal or 
immediately inferior to the delta specified in the declaration of the type. 

The attribute MANTISSA is defined as the smallest number such that 

2 ** MANTISSA >■ max (abs (upper_bound), abs ()ower_bound)) / small 

The size of a fixed point type is: 

MANTISSA Size

1 .. 15 
16 .. 31 


8 bits 
16 bits 
32 bits 


(T2 transputer targets only). 


Fixed point types requiring a MANTISSA greater than 31 are not supported. 


Access Types [3.8] 

Values of access types are represented internally by the address of the designated object 
held in single word. The value MIN_1NT (the smallest integer that can be represented 
in a machine word) is used to represent null. 


Array Types [3.6] 

Ada arrays are passed by address; the value passed is the address of the first element of 
the first dimension of the array. The elements of the array are allocated by row. When 
an array is passed as a parameter to an interfaced subprogram, the usual consistency 
checking between the array bounds declared in the calling program and the subprogram 
is not enforced. It is the programmer’s responsibility to ensure that the subprogram does 
not violate the bounds of the array. 

Values of the predefined type STRING [3.6.3] are arrays, and are passed in the same 
way: the address of the first character in the string is passed. Elements of a string are 
represented in 8 bits, using the standard ASCII codes. 


R ec ord T y pe s [3-7] 

Ada records are passed by address; the value passed is the address of the first component 
of the record. Components of a record are aligned on their natural boundaries (e.g. 
INTEGER on a word boundary) and the components may be re-ordered by the Compiler 
so as to minimize the total size of objects of the record type. If a record contains 
discriminants or components having a dynamic size, implicit components may be added 
to the record. Thus the default layout of the internal structure of the record may not 
be inferred directly from its Ada declaration. The use of a representation clause to 
control the layout of any record type whose values are to be passed to interfaced 
subprograms is recommended. 


1.2.4 Restrictions on Interfaced Subprograms 

Interfaced OCCAM subprograms must be compiled using the UNIVERSAL error mode 
(X). In this mode, there is no error checking and any run-time errors in the OCCAM 
code are ignored. This ensures that processes do not execute a STOPP instruction and 
avoids the unpredictable results which may occur if this is allowed to happen. 

It is not possible to interface to OCCAM functions which return floating point types, 
nor to those which have more that one return value. 


Appendix F. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 



1.3 INTERFACE NAME 


Pragma 1NTERFACE_NAME associates the name of an interfaced subprogram, as 
declared in Ada, with its name in the language of origin. If pragma 
INTERFACE_NAME is not used, then the two names are assumed to be identical. 

This pragma takes the form: 

pragma INTERFACE_NAME ( subprogram_name, string_literal)\ 
where: 


■ subprogram_name is the name used within the Ada program to refer to the 
interfaced subprogram. 

■ siring ^literal is the name by which the interfaced subprogram is referred to 
at link-time. 

The use of INTERFACE__NAME is optional, and is not needed if a subprogram has the 
same name in Ada as in the language of origin. It is necessary, for example, if the 
name of the subprogram in its original language contains characters that are not 
permitted in Ada identifiers. Ada identifiers can contain only letters, digits and 
underscores, whereas the INMOS linker allows external names to contain other 
characters, e.g. full stops. These characters can be specified in the string_literal 
argument of the pragma INTERFACE_NAME. 

The pragma INTERFACE__NAME is allowed at the same places of an Ada program as 
the pragma INTERFACE [13.9]. However, the pragma INTERFACE__NAME must 
always occur after the pragma INTERFACE declaration for the interfaced subprogram. 


1.4 Other Pragmas 

Pragmas IMPROVE and PACK are discussed in detail in the section on representation 
clauses (Chapter 4). 

Pragma PRIORITY is accepted with the range of priorities running from 1 to 10 (see the 
definition of the predefined package SYSTEM in Chapter 3). The undefined priority 
(no pragma PRIORITY) is treated as though it were less than any defined priority value. 

In addition to pragma SUPPRESS, it is possible to suppress all checks in a given 
compilation by the use of the Compiler option CHECKS. 

The following language defined pragmas have no effect. 

CONTROLLED 

MEMORY_SIZE 

OPTIMIZE 

STORAGE_UNIT 

SYSTEM_NAME 

Note that all access types are implemented by default as controlled collections as 
described in [4.8].

Alsys transputer Ada Compiler, Appendix F. v4.0 



2 Implementation-Dependent Attributes 


In addition to the Representation Attributes of [13.7.2] and [13.7.3], the four attributes 
listed in section 5 (Conventions for Implementation-Generated Names), for use in record 
representation clauses, and the attributes described below are provided: 

T’DESCRI?TOR_SIZE For a prefix T that denotes a type or subtype, this 

attribute yields the size (in bits) required to hold a 
descriptor for an object of the type T, allocated on the 
heap or written to a file. If T is constrained, 
TDESCRIPTOR_SIZE will yield the value 0. 

T*IS_ARRAY For a prefix T that denotes a type or subtype, this 

attribute yields the value TRUE if T denotes an array 
type or an array subtype; otherwise, it yields the value 
FALSE. 

Limitations on the use of the attribute ADDRESS 

The attribute ADDRESS is implemented for ail prefixes that have meaningful addresses. 
The following entities do not have meaningful addresses and will therefore cause a 
compilation error if used as a prefix ADDRESS: 

■ A constant or named number that is implemented as an immediate value (i.e. 
does not have any space allocated for it). 

■ A package specification that is not a library unit. 

■ A package body that is not a library unit or subunit.

4 Restrictions on Representation Clauses 


This section explains how objects are represented and allocated by the Alsys transputer 
Ada Compiler and how it is possible to control this using representation clauses. 

The representation of an object is closely connected with its type. For this reason this 
section addresses successively the representation of enumeration, integer, floating point, 
fixed point, access, task, array and record types. For each class of type the 
representation of the corresponding objects is described. 

The transputer supports operations on the data types byte, word and double-word, so 
these data types are used to form the basis of the representation of Ada types. The 
word length for T4 and T8 transputer targets is 32 bits whereas T2 transputers have a 
word length of only 16 bits. Currently, the compiler does not support operations on 
double 32 bit word quantities. This affects the representation of integer, fixed point 
and enumeration types. 

Except in the case of array and record types, the description of each class of type is 
independent of the others. To understand the representation of an array type it is 
necessary to understand first the representation of its components. The same rule 
applies to a record type. 

Apart from implementation defined pragmas, Ada provides three means to control the 
size of objects: 

■ a (predefined) pragma PACK, when the object is an array, an array 
component, a record or a record component 

■ a record representation clause, when the object is a record or a record 
component 

■ a size specification, in any case. 

For each class of types the effect of a size specification is described. Interaction 
between size specifications, packing and record representation clauses is described under 
array and record types. 

Representation clauses on derived record types or derived task types are not supported. 

Size representation clauses on types derived from private types are not supported when 
the derived type is declared outside the private part of the defining package. 


4.1 Enumeration Types 


Internal codes of enumeration literals 

When no enumeration representation clause applies to an enumeration type, the internal 
code associated with an enumeration literal is the position number of the enumeration 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


9 



literal. Then, for an enumeration type with n elements, the internal codes are the 
integers 0, 1,2.n-1. 


An enumeration representation clause can be provided to specify the value of each 
internal code as described in [13.3]. The Alsys Compiler fully implements enumeration 
representation clauses. 

As internal codes must be machine integers the internal codes provided by an 
enumeration representation clause must be in the range -2 S1 .. 2 31 -I. 


Encoding of enumeration values 

An enumeration value is always represented by its internal code in the program 
generated by the Compiler. 


Minimum size of an enumeration subtype 

The minimum size of an enumeration subtype is the minimum number of bits that is 
necessary for representing the internal codes of the subtype values in normal binary 
form. 

For a static subtype, if it has a null range its minimum size is 1. Otherwise, if m and M 
are the values of the internal codes associated with the first and last enumeration values 
of the subtype, then its minimum size L is determined as follows. For m >= 0, L is the 
smallest positive integer such that M <* 2 L -1. For m < 0, L is the smallest positive 
integer such that -2 L '* <* m and M <« 2 L ' l -l. For example: 

type COLOR is (GREEN, BLACK, WHITE, RED, BLUE, YELLOW); 

-- The minimum size of COLOR is 3 bits. 

subtype BLACK_AND_WHITE is COLOI^nge BLACK .. WHITE; 

— The minimum size of BLACK_AND_WhiTE is 2 bits. 

subtype BLACK_OR_WHITE is BLACK_AND_WHITE range X .. X; 

-- Assuming that X is not static, the minimum size of BLACK_OR_WHITE is 
-- 2 bits (the same as the minimum size of the static type mark 
— BLACK AND_WHITE). 


Size of an enumeration subtype 

When no size specification is applied to an enumeration type or first named subtype, the 
objects of that type or first named subtype are represented as either unsigned bytes or 
signed words. The Compiler selects automatically the smallest such object which can 
hold each of the internal codes of the enumeration type (or subtype). The size of the 
enumeration type and of any of its subtypes is thus 8 bits in the case of an unsigned 
byte, or the machine word size (16 or 32 bits) in the case of a signed word. 


10 


Alsys transputer Ada Compiler, Appendix F, v4.0 



When a size specification is applied to an enumeration type, this enumeration type a.id 
each of its subtypes has the size specified by the length clause. The same rule applies to 
a first named subtype. The size specification must of course specify a value greater than 
or equal to the minimum size of the type or subtype to which it applies. For example: 

type EXTENDED is

The Alsys Compiler fully implements size specifications. Nevertheless, as enumeration 
values are coded using integers, the specified length cannot be greater than 32 bits. 


Size of the objects of an enumeration subtype 

Provided its size is not constrained by a record component clause or a pragma PACK, an 
object of an enumeration subtype has the same size as its subtype. 


Alignment of an enumeration subtype 

An enumeration subtype is byte aligned if the size of the subtype is less than or equal to 
8 bits, word aligned otherwise. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


11 



Address of an object of an enumeration subtype 

Provided its alignment is not constrained by a record representation clause or a pragma 
PACK, the address of an object of an enumeration subtype is a multiple of the 
alignment of the corresponding subtype. 


4.2 Integer Types 


Predefined integer types 

In the Alsys Ada implementation for the transputer the number of predefined integer 
types available differs depending upon the transputer target. For T4 and T8 transputer 
targets there are two predefined integer types: 

type SHORTJNTEGER is range -2**07 .. 2**07-1; 

type INTEGER Is range -2**31 .. 2**31-1; 

For T2 transputer targets there are three predefined integer types: 

type SHORTJNTEGER is range -2**07 .. 2**07-1; 

type INTEGER is range -2**15 .. 2**15-1; 

type LONG_INTEGER is range -2**31 .. 2**31-I; 


Selection of the parent of an integer type 
An integer type declared by a declaration of the form: 
type T is range L .. R; 

is implicitly derived from one of the predefined integer types. The Compiler 
automatically selects the predefined integer type whose range is the shortest that contains 
the values L to R inclusive. 


Encoding of integer values 

Binary code is used to represent integer values. Negative numbers are represented using 
two’s complement. 


Minimum size of an integer subtype 

The minimum size of an integer subtype is the minimum number of bits that is 
necessary for representing the internal codes of the subtype values in normal binary 
form (that is to say, in an unbiased form which includes a sign bit only if the range of 
the subtype includes negative values). 


12 


Alsys transputer Ada Compiler, Appendix F. v4.0 



For a static subtype, if it has a null range its minimum size is 1. Otherwise, if m and M 
are the lower and upper bounds of the subtype, then its minimum size L is determined 
as follows. For m >= 0, L is the smallest positive integer such that M <= 2 L -1. For m 
< 0, L is the smallest positive integer such that -2 L ' r <= m and M <= 2 L ' 1 -1. For 
example: 

subtype S is INTEGER range 0 .. 7; 

-- The minimum size of S is 3 bits. 

subtype D is S range X Y; 

-- Assuming that X and Y are not static, the minimum size of 

-- D is 3 bits (the same as the minimum size of the static type nark S). 


Size of an integer subtype 

For T4 and T8 transputer targets, the sizes of the predefined integer types 
SHORT INTEGER and INTEGER are 8 and 32 bits respectively. For T2 transputer 
targets, the sizes of the predefined integer types SHORT_INTEGER, INTEGER and 
LONG_INTEGER are 8, 16 and 32 bits respectively. 

When no size specification is applied to an integer type or to its first named subtype (if 
any), its size and the size of any of its subtypes is the size of the predefined type from 
which it derives, directly or indirectly. For example: 

type S is range 80 .. 100; 

-- S is derived from SHORT_INTEGER; its size is 8 bits, 
type J is range 0 .. 65535; 

-- J is derived from INTEGER for T4 and T8 targets and LONG_INTEGER 
-- for T2 targets; its size is 32 bits. 

type N is new J range 80 .. 100; 

— N is indirectly derived from INTEGER or LONG_INTEGER as above; 

-- its size is 32 bits. 

When a size specification is applied to an integer type, this integer type and each of its 
subtypes has the size specified by the length clause. The same rule applies to a first 
named subtype. The size specification must of course specify a value greater than or 
equal to the minimum size of the type or subtype to which it applies, for example: 

type S is range 80 .. 100; 
for S'SIZE use 32; 

-- S is derived from SHORT_INTEGER, but its size is 32 bits because 
— of the size specification. 

type J is range 0 .. 255; 
for J’SIZE use 8; 

-- J is derived from INTEGER, but its size is 8 bits because of the 
-- size specification. 

type N is new J range 80 .. 100; 

— N is indirectly derived from INTEGER, but its size is 8 bits 


Appendix F. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


13 



-- because N inherits the size specification of J. 

The Aisys Compiler implements size specifications. Nevertheless, as integers are 
implemented using machine integers, the specified length cannot be greater than 32 bits. 


Size of the objects of an integer subtype 

Provided its size is not constrained by a record component clause or a pragma PACK, an 
object of an integer subtype has the same size as its subtype. 


Alignment of an integer subtype 

An integer subtype is byte aligned if the size of the subtype is less than or equal to 8 
bits, word aligned otherwise. 


Address of an object of an integer subtype 

Provided its alignment is not constrained by a record representation clause or a pragma 
PACK, the address of an object of an integer subtype is a multiple of the alignment of 
the corresponding subtype. 


4.3 Floating Point Types 


Predefined floating point types 

In the Aisys Ada implementation for the transputer there are two predefined floating 
point types. 

type FLOAT is 

digits 6 range -(2.0 - 2.0**(-23))*2.0**127 .. (2.0 - 2.0**(-23))*2.0**127; 
type LONG__FLOAT is 

digits 15 range -(2.0 - 2.0**(-51))*2.0**1023 .. (2.0 - 2.0**(-51))*2.0**1023; 


Selection of the parent of a floating point type 
A floating point type declared by a declaration of the form: 
type T is digits D {range L .. R); 

is implicitly derived from a predefined floating point type. The Compiler automatically 
selects the smallest predefined floating point type whose number of digits is greater than 
or equal to O and which contains the values L and R. 


14 


Aisys transputer Ada Compiler, Appendix F, v4.0 



Encoding of floating point values 

In the program generated by the Compiler, floating point values are represented using 
the ANSI/IEEE 754 standard 32-bit and 64-bit floating point formats as appropriate. 

Values of the predefined type FLOAT are represented using the 32-bit floating point 
format and values of the predefined type LONG_FLOAT are represented using the 64- 
bit floating point format as defined by the standard. The values of any other floating 
point type are represented in the same way as the values of the predefined type from 
which it derives, directly or indirectly. 


Minimum size of a floating point subtype 

The minimum size of a floating point subtype is 32 bits if its base type is FLOAT or a 
type derived from FLOAT and 64 bits if its base type is LONG_FLOAT or a type 
derived from LONG FLOAT. 


Size of a floating point subtype 

The sizes of the predefined floating point types FLOAT and LONG_FLOAT are 32 and 
64 bits respectively. 

The size of a floating point type and the size of any of its subtypes is the size of the 
predefined type from which it derives directly or indirectly. 

The only size that can be specified for a floating point type or first named subtype 
using a size specification is its usual size (32 or 64 bits). 


Size of the objects of a floating point subtype 

An object of a floating point subtype has the same size as its subtype. 


Alignment of a floating point subtype 
A floating point subtype is always word aligned. 


Address of an object of a floating point subtype 

Provided its alignment is not constrained by a record representation clause or a pragma 
PACK, the address of an object of a floating point subtype is a multiple of the 
alignment of the corresponding subtype.

4.4 Fixed Point Types 


Small of a fixed point type 

If no specification of small applies to a fixed point type, then the value of small is 
determined by the value of delta as defined by (3.5.9). 

A specification of small can be used to impose a value of small. The value of small is 
required to be a power of two. 


Predefined fixed point types 

To implement fixed point types, the Alsys Compiler for the transputer uses a set of 
anonymous predefined types dependent upon the target transputer type. 

For T4 and T8 transputer targets these anonymous types are: 

type SHORT_FIXED is delta D range (-2**7-l)*S .. 2**7*S; 
for SHORTFIXED’SMALL use S; 

type FIXED is delta D range (-2**31-1)*S .. 2**31*S; 
for FIXED’SMALL use S; 

For T2 transputer targets these anonymous types are: 

type SHORT_FIXED is delta D range (-2**7-1)*S .. 2**7*S; 
for SHORT_FIXED’SMALL use S; 

type FIXED is delta D range (-2**l5-l)*S .. 2**15*S; 
for FIXED’SMALL use S; 

type LONG_FIXED is delta D range (-2**31- 1)*S .. 2**31*S; 
for LONG_FIXED’SMALL use S; 

where D is any real value and S any power of two less than or equal to D. 


Selection of the parent of a fixed point type 
A fixed point type declared by a declaration of the form: 

type T is delta D range L .. R; 
possibly with a small specification: 
for TSMALL use S; 

is implicitly derived from a predefined fixed point type. The Compiler automatically 
selects the predefined fixed point type whose small and delta are the same as the small 
and delta of T and whose range is the shortest that includes the values L and R. 


16 


Alsys transputer Ada Compiler, Appendix F, v4.0 



Encoding of fixed point values 

In the program generated by the Compiler, a safe value V of a fixed point subtype F is 
represented as the integer: 

V / FBASE’SMALL 


Minimum size of a fixed point subtype 

The minimum size of a fixed point subtype is the minimum number of binary digits that 
is necessary for representing the values of the range of the subtype using the small of 
the base type (that is to say, in an unbiased form which includes a sign bit only if the 
range of the subtype includes negative values). 

For a static subtype, if it has a null range its minimum size is 1. Otherwise, s and S 
being the bounds of the subtype, if i and I are the integer representations of m and M, 
the smallest and the greatest model numbers of the base type such that s < m and M < S, 
then the minimum size L is determined as follows. For i >= 0, L is the smallest positive 
integer such that I <= 2 L -1. For i < 0, L is the smallest positive integer such that -2 Ll 
<= i and I <= 2 L ‘ X -1. For example: 

type F is delta 2.0 range 0.0 .. 500.0; 

— The minimum size of F is 8 bits. 

subtype S is F delta 16.0 range 0.0 .. 250.0; 

-- The minimum size of S is 7 bits. 

subtype D is S range X .. Y; 

-- Assuming that X and Y are not static, the minimum size of D is 7 bits 
-- (the same as the minimum size of its type mark S). 


Size of a fixed point subtype 

For T4 and T8 transputer targets, the sizes of the predefined fixed point types 
SHORT_FIXED and FIXED are 8 and 32 bits respectively. For T2 transputer targets, 
the sizes of the predefined fixed point types SHORT_FIXED, FIXED and 
LONG_FIXED are 8, 16 and 32 bits respectively. 


Appendix F, lmplementation-Dependent Characteristics 


17 



When no size specification is applied to a fixed point type or to its first named subtype, 
its size and the size of any of its subtypes is the size of the predefined type from which 
it derives directly or indirectly. For example: 

type F is delta 0.01 range 0.0 .. 1.0; 

— F is derived from a 8 bit predefined fixed type, its size is 8 bits, 
type L is delta 0.01 range 0.0 .. 300.0; 

— L is derived from a 32 bit predefined fixed type, its size is 32 bits, 
type N is new L range 0.0 .. 2.0; 

-- N is indirectly derived from a 32 bit predefined fixed type, its size is 32 bits. 

When a size specification is applied to a fixed point type, this fixed point type and each 
of its subtypes has the size specified by the length clause. The same rule applies to a 
first named subtype. The size specification must of course specify a value greater than 
or equal to the minimum size of the type or subtype to which it applies, for example: 

type F is delta 0.01 range 0.0 .. 2.0; 
for FSIZE use 32; 

— F is derived from an 8 bit predefined fixed type, but its size is 32 bits 

— because of the size specification. 

type L is delta 0.01 range 0.0 .. 300.0; 
for FSIZE use 16; 

— F is derived from a 32 bit predefined fixed type, but its size is 16 bits 

— because of the size specification. 

— The size specification is legal since the range contains no negative values 
-- and therefore no sign bit is required. 

type N is new F range 0.8 .. 1.0; 

— N is indirectly derived from a 16 bit predefined fixed type, but its size is 

— 32 bits because N inherits the size specification of F. 

The Alsys Compiler implements size specifications. Nevertheless, as fixed point objects 
are represented using machine integers, the specified length cannot be greater than 32 
bits. 


Size of the objects of a fixed point subtype 

Provided its size is not constrained by a record component clause or a pragma PACK, an 
object of a fixed point type has the same size as its subtype. 


Alignment of a fixed point subtype 

A fixed point subtype is byte aligned if its size is less than or equal to 8 bits, word 
aligned otherwise. 


18 


Alsys transputer Ada Compiler, Appendix F. v4.0 



Address of an object oj a fixed point subtype 

Provided its alignment is not constrained by a record representation clause or a pragma 
PACK, the address of an object of a fixed point subtype is a multiple of the alignment 
of the corresponding subtype. 

4.5 Access Types 

Collection Size 

When no specification of collection size applies to an access type, no storage space is 
reserved for its collection, and the value of the attribute STORAGE_SIZE is then 0. 

As described in [13.2], a specification of collection size can be provided in order to 
reserve storage space for the collection of an access type. The Alsys Compiler fully 
implements this kind of specification. 


Encoding of access values 

Access values are machine addresses represented as machine word-sized values (i.e. 16 
bits for T2 targets ar.d 32 bits for T4 and T8 . gets). 


Minimum size of an access subtype 

The minimum size of an access subtype is that of the word size of the target transputer. 


Size of an access subtype 

The size of an access subtype is the same as its minimum size. 

The only size that can be specified for an access type using a size specification is its 
usual size. 


Size of an object of an access subtype 

An object of an access subtype has the same size as its subtype, thus an object of an 
access subtype is always one machine word long. 

Alignment of an access subtype 
An access subtype is always word aligned. 


Appendix F, implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


19 



Address of an object of an access subtype 

Provided its alignment is not constrained by a record representation clause or a pragma 
PACK, the address of an object of an access subtype is always on a word boundary, 
since its subtype is word aligned. 


4.6 Task Types 


Storage for a task activation 

When no length clause is used to specify the storage space to be reserved for a task 
activation, the storage space indicated at bind time is used for this activation. 

As described in [13.2], a length clause can be used to specify the storage space for the 
activation of each of the tasks of a given type. In this case the value indicated at bind 
time is ignored for this task type, and the length clause is obeyed. 

It is not allowed to apply such a length clause to a derived type. The same storage space 
is reserved for the activation of a task of a derived type as for the activation of a task 
of the parent type. 


Encoding of task values 

Task values are represented as machine word sized values. 


Minimum size of a task subtype 

The minimum size of a task subtype is that of the word length of the target transputer. 
Size of a task subtype 

The size of a task subtype is the same as its minimum size. 

The only size that can be specified for a task type using a size specification is its usual 
size. 


Size of the objects of a task subtype 

An object of a task subtype has the same size as its subtype. Thus an object of a task 
subtype is always one machine word long. 

Alignment of a task subtype 
A task subtype is always word aligned. 


20 


Alsys transputer Ada Compiler. Appendix F. v4.0 



Address of an object of a task subtype 


Provided its alignment is not constrained by a record representation clause, the address 
of an object of a task subtype is always on a word boundary, since its subtype is word 
aligned. 


4.7 Array Types 


Layout of an array 

Each array is allocated in a contiguous area of storage units. All the components have 
the same size. A gap may exist between two consecutive components (and after the last 
one). All the gaps have the same size. 



Component Gap Component Gap Component Gap 


Components 

If the array is not packed, the size of the components is the size of the subtype of the 
components, for example: 

type A is array (1 .. 8) of BOOLEAN; 

-- The size of the components of A is the size of the type BOOLEAN: 8 bits. 

type DECIMAL_DIGIT is range 0 .. 9; 
for DECIMAL_DIGrrSIZE use 4; 
type BINARY_CODED_DECIMAL is 

array (INTEGER range <>) of DECIMAL DIGIT; 

-- The size of the type DECIMAL_DIGIT is 4 bits. Thus in an array of 
-- type BINARY_CODED_DECIMAL each component will be represented in 
-- 4 bits as in the usual BCD representation. 

If the array is packed and its components are neither records nor arrays, the size of the 
components is the minimum size of the subtype of the components, for example: 

type A is array (1 ..8) of BOOLEAN; 
pragma PACK(A); 

— The size of the components of A is the minimum size of the type BOOLEAN: 

-- 1 bit. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


21 











type DECIMAL_DIGIT is range 0 .. 9; 
type BINARY_CODED_DECIMAL is 

array (INTEGER range <>) of DECIMaL_DIGIT; 
pragma PACK(BINARY_CODED_DECIMAL); 

— The size of the type DECIMAL_DIGIT is 8 bits, but, as 
-- BlNARY_CODED_DECIMAL is packed, each component of an array of this 
— type will be represented in 4 bits as in the usual BCD representation. 

Packing the array has no effect on the size of the components when the components are 
records or arrays. 


Gaps 

If the components are records or arrays, no size specification applies to the subtype of 
the components and the array is not packed, then the Compiler may choose a 
representation with a gap after each component; the aim of the insertion of such gaps is 
to optimize access to the array components and to their subcomponents. The size of the 
gap is chosen so that the relative displacement of consecutive components is a multiple 
of the alignment of the subtype of the components. This strategy allows each 
component and subcomponent to have an address consistent with the alignment of its 
subtype, for example: 

type INT is range -2**31 .. 2**31 - 1; 
type R is 

record 

K : INT; -- INT is word aligned. 

B : BOOLEAN; — BOOLEAN is byte aligned. 

end record; 

-- Record type R is word aligned; its size is 40 bits, 
type A is array (1 .. 10) of R; 

— A gap is inserted after each component in order to respect the 
-- alignment of type R.

If a size specification applies to the subtype of the components or if the array is packed, 
no gaps are inserted, for example: 

type INT is range -2**31 .. 2**31 - 1; 
type R is 
record 

K : INT; 

B : BOOLEAN; 
end record; 

type A is array (1 .. 10) of R;

-- There is no gap in an array of type A because A is packed. 

-- The size of an object of type A will be 400 bits. 

type NR is new R; 
for NR’SIZE use 40; 

type B is array (1 .. 10) of NR; 

-- There is no gap in an array of type B because NR has a size specification. 

-- The size of an object of type B will be 400 bits.

Component Component Component 


Array of type A or B: a subcomponent K can have any byte offset. 


Size of an array subtype 

The size of an array subtype is obtained by multiplying the number of its components 
by the sum of the size of the components and the size of the gaps (if any). If the 
subtype is unconstrained, the maximum number of components is considered. 

The size of an array subtype cannot be computed at compile time 

■ if it has non-static constraints or is an unconstrained array type with non¬ 
static index subtypes (because the number of components can then only be 
determined at run time). 

■ if the components are records or arrays and their constraints or the 
constraints of their subcomponents (if any) are not static (because the size of 
the components and the size of the gaps can then only be determined at run 
time). 

As has been indicated above, the effect of a pragma PACK on an array type is to 
suppress the gaps and to reduce the size of the components. The consequence of 
packing an array type is thus to reduce its size. 


Appendix F. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


23 







If the components of an array are records or arrays and their constraints or the 
constraints of their subcomponents (if any) are not static, the Compiler ignores any 
pragma PACK applied to the array type but issues a warning message. Apart from this 
limitation, array packing is fully implemented by the Alsys Compiler. 

The only size that can be specified for an array type or first named subtype using a size 
specification is its usual size. Nevertheless, such a length clause can be useful to verify 
that the layout of an array is as expected by the application. 


Size of the objects of an array subtype 

The size of an object of an array subtype is always equal to the size of the subtype of 
the object. 


Alignment of an array subtype 

If no pragma PACK applies to an array subtype and no size specification applies to its 
components, the array subtype has the same alignment as the subtype of its components. 

If a pragma PACK applies to an array subtype or if a size specification applies to its 
components (so that there are no gaps), the alignment of the array subtype is the lesser 
of the alignment of the subtype of its components and the relative displacement of the 
components. 


Address of an object of an array subtype 

Provided its alignment is not constrained by a record representation clause, the address 
of an object of an array subtype is a multiple of the alignment of the corresponding 
subtype. 

4.8 Record Types 


Layout of a record 

Each record is allocated in a contiguous area of storage units. The size of a record 
component depends on its type. Gaps may exist between some components. 

The positions and the sizes of the components of a record type object can be controlled 
using a record representation clause as described in [13.4], In the Alsys implementation 
for transputer targets there is no restriction on the position that can be specified for a 
component of a record. If a component is not a record or an array, its size can be any 
size from the minimum size to the size of its subtype. If a component is a record or an 
array, its size must be the size of its subtype. 

A record representation clause need not specify the position and the size for every 
component. 


24 


Alsys transputer Ada Compiler, Appendix F, v4.0 



If no component clause applies to a component of a record, its size is the size of its 
subtype. Its position is chosen by the Compiler so as to optimize access to the 
components of the record: the offset of the component is chosen as a multiple of the 
alignment of the component subtype. Moreover, the Compiler chooses the position of 
the component so as to reduce the number of gaps and thus the size of the record 
objects. 

Because of these optimisations, there is no connection between the order of the 
components in a record type declaration and the positions chosen by the Compiler for 
the components in a record object. 

Pragma PACK has no further effect on records. The Alsys Compiler always optimizes 
the layout of records as described above. 

In the current version, it is not possible to apply a record representation clause to a 
derived type. The same storage representation is used for an object of a derived type as 
for an object of the parent type. 


Indirect components 

If the offset of a component cannot be computed at compile time, this offset is stored in 
the record objects at run time and used to access the component. Such a component is 
said to be indirect while other components are said to be direct

Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


25 



If a record component is a record or an array, the size of its subtype may be evaluated 
at run '. ne and may even depend on the discriminants of the record. We will call these 
components dynamic components. For example: 

type DEVICE is (SCREEN, PRINTER); 

type COLOUR is (GREEN, RED, BLUE); 

type SERIES is array (POSITIVE range <>) of INTEGER; 

type GRAPH (L : NATURAL) is 
record 

X : SERIES(1 .. L); — The size of X depends on L 
Y : SERIES(1 .. L); — The size of Y depends on L 
end record; 

Q : POSITIVE; 

type PICTURE (N : NATURAL; D : DEVICE) is 
record 

F : GRAPH(N); -- The size of F depends on N 
S : GRAPH(Q); -- The size of S depends on Q 
case D is 

when SCREEN => 

C : COLOUR; 
when PRINTER => 
null; 

end case; 
end record; 

Any component placed after a dynamic component has an offset which cannot be 
evaluated at compile time and is thus indirect. In order to minimize the number of 
indirect components, the Compiler groups the dynamic components together and places 
them at the end of the record: 


26 


Alsys transputer Ada Compiler. Appendix F. v4.0 



D = SCREEN 
N = 2 


D = PRINTER 
N = 1 


S OFFSET 


F OFFSET 


Beginning of the record 
- Compile time offsets — 


Run time offsets 


S OFFSET 


F OFFSET 


The record type PICTURE: F and S are placed at the end of the record 


Thanks to this strategy, the only indirect components are dynamic components. But not 
all dynamic components are necessarily indirect if there are dynamic components in a 
component list which is not followed by a variant part, then exactly one dynamic 
component of this list is a direct component because its offset can be computed at 
compilation time, for example : 



- Y OfFSET

Size dependent on discriminent t 


The record type GRAPH: the dynamic component X is a direct component. 


The offset of an indirect component is always expressed in storage units. 

The space reserved for the offset of an indirect component must be large enough to 
store the size of any value of the record type (the maximum potential offset). The 


Appendix F. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


27 




Compiler evaluates an upper bound MS of this size and treats an offset as a component 
having an anonymous integer type whose range is 0 .. MS. 

If C is the name of an indirect component, then the offset of this component can be 
denoted in a component clause by the implementation generated name C’OFFSET. 


Implicit components 

In some circumstances, access to an object of a record type or to its components involves 
computing information which only depends on the discriminant values. To avoid useless 
recomputation, the Compiler stores this information in the record objects, updates it 
when the values of the discriminants are modified and uses it when the objects or their 
components are accessed. This information is stored in special components called 
implicit components. 

An implicit component may contain information which is used when the record object 
or several of its components are accessed. In this case the component will be included in 
any record object (the implicit component is considered to be declared before any 
variant part in the record type declaration). There can be two components of this kind; 
one is called RECORDSIZE and the other VARIANT_INDEX. 

On the other hand an implicit component may be used to access a given record 
component. In this case the implicit component exists whenever the record component 
exists (the implicit component is considered to be declared at the same place as the 
record component). Components of this kind are called ARRAY_DESCRIPTORs or 
RECORDDESCRIPTORs. 

• RECORD^S IZE 

This implicit component is created by the Compiler when the record type has a variant 
part and its discriminants are defaulted. It contains the size of the storage space 
necessary to store the current value of the record object (note that the storage effectively 
allocated for the record object may be more than this). 

The value of a RECORD_SIZE component may denote a number of bits or a number of 
storage units. In general it denotes a number of storage units, but if any component 
clause specifies that a component of the record type has an offset or a size which cannot 
be expressed using storage units, then the value designates a number of bits. 

The implicit component RECORD_SIZE must be large enough to store the maximum 
size of any value of the record type. The Compiler evaluates an upper bound MS of this 
size and then considers the implicit component as having an anonymous integer type 
whose range is 0 .. MS. 

If R is the name of the record type, this implicit component can be denoted in a 
component clause by the implementation generated name R’RECORD_SIZE. 

. VARIANT_INDEX 

This implicit component is created by the Compiler when the record type has a variant 
part. It indicates the set of components that are present in a record value. It is used 
when a discriminant check is to be done. 


28 


Alsys transputer Ada Compiler, Appendix F, v4.0 



Component lists that do not contain a variant part are numbered. These numbers are the 
possible values of the implicit component VAR1ANT_INDEX. For example: 


type VEHICLE is (AIRCRAFT, ROCKET, BOAT, CAR); 

type DESCRIPTION (KIND : VEHICLE > CAR) is 
record 

SPEED : INTEGER; 
case KIND is 

when AIRCRAFT | CAR => 

WHEELS : INTEGER; 
case KIND is 


when AIRCRAFT => — 1 

WINGSPAN : INTEGER; 


when others *> 

— 2 

null; 


end case; 


when BOAT => 

— 3 

STEAM : BOOLEAN; 


when ROCKET ®> 

— 4 


STAGES : INTEGER; 

end case; 
end record; 

The value of the variant index indicates the set of components that are present in a 
record value: 


Variant Index 

Set 

1 

{KIND, SPEED, WHEELS, WINGSPAN} 

2 

{KINO, SPEED, WHEELS} 

3 

{KINO, SPEED, STEAM} 

4 

{KINO, SPEED, STAGES} 


A comparison between the variant index of a record value and the bounds of an interval 
is enough to check that a given component is present in the value: 


Component 

Interval 

KINO 


SPEED 


WHEELS 

1 .. 2 

WINGSPAN 

1 .. 1 

STEAM 

3 3 

STAGES 

4 .. 4 


The implicit component VARIANT_INDEX must be large enough to store the number 
V of component lists that don’t contain variant parts. The Compiler treats this implicit 
component as having an anonymous integer type whose range is 1 .. V. 

If R is the name of the record type, this implicit component can be denoted in a 
component clause by the implementation generated name R’VARIANT__INDEX. 


Appendix F. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


29 




ARRAY DESCRIPTOR 


An implicit component of this kind is associated by the Compiler with each record 
component whose subtype is an anonymous array subtype that depends on a discriminant 
of the record. It contains information about the component subtype. 

The structure of an implicit component of kind ARRAY_DESCRIPTOR is not 
described in this documentation. Nevertheless, if a programmer is interested in 
specifying the location of a component of this kind using a component clause, he can 
obtain the size of the component using the ASSEMBLY parameter in the COMPILE 
command. 

The Compiler treats an implicit component of the kind ARRAY_DESCRIPTOR as 
having an anonymous record type. If C is the name of the record component whose 
subtype is described by the array descriptor, then this implicit component can be 
denoted in a component clause by the implementation generated name 
C’ARRAY_DESCRIPTOR. 

■ RECORD DESCRIPTOR 

An implicit component of this kind is associated by the Compiler with_each record 
component whose subtype is an anonymous record subtype that depends on a 
discriminant of the record. It contains information about the component subtype. 

The structure of an implicit component of kind RECORD_DESCRIPTOR is not 
described in this documentation. Nevertheless, if a programmer is interested in 
specifying the location of a component of this kind using a component clause, he can 
obtain the size of the component using the ASSEMBLY parameter in the COMPILE 
command. 

The Compiler treats an implicit component of the kind RECORD_DESCRIPTOR as 
having an anonymous record type. If C is the name of the record component whose 
subtype is described by the record descriptor, then this implicit component can be 
denoted in a component clause by the implementation generated name 
C’RECORD DESCRIPTOR. 


Suppression of implicit components 

The Alsys implementation provides the capability of suppressing the implicit components 
RECORD_SIZE and/or VARIANT_INDEX from a record type. This can be done 
using an implementation defined pragma called IMPROVE. The syntax of this pragma 
is as follows: 

pragma IMPROVE ( TIME | SPACE , (ON «>] simple_name ); 

The first argument specifies whether TIME or SPACE is the primary criterion for the 
choice of the representation of the record type that is denoted by the second argument. 

If TIME is specified, the Compiler inserts implicit components as described above. If 
on the other hand SPACE is specified, the Compiler only inserts a VARIANT_INDEX 
or a RECORD_SIZE component if this component appears in a record representation 


JO 


Alsys transputer Ada Compiler, Appendix F. v4.0 



clause that applies to the record type. A record representation clause can thus be used 
to keep one implicit component while suppressing the other. 

A pragma IMPROVE that applies to a given record type can occur anywhere that a 
representation clause is allowed for this type. 


Size of a record subtype 

Unless a component clause specifies that a component of a record type has an offset or a 
size which cannot be expressed using storage units, the size of a record subtype is 
rounded up to a whole number of storage units. 

The size of a constrained record subtype is obtained by adding the sizes of its 
components and the sizes of its gaps (if any). This size is not computed at compile time 

■ when the record subtype has non-static constraints, 

■ when a component is an array or a record and its size is not computed at 
compile time. 

The size of an unconstrained record subtype is obtained by adding the sizes of the 
components and the sizes of the gaps (if any) of its largest variant. If the size of a 
component or of a gap cannot be evaluated ;tly at compile time, an upper bound of 
this size is used by the Compiler to compute the subtype size. 

The only size that can be specified for a record type or first named subtype using a size 
specification is its usual size. Nevertheless, such a length clause can be useful to verify 
that the layout of a record is as expected by the application. 


Size of an object of a record subtype 

An object of a constrained record subtype has the same size as its subtype. 

An object of an unconstrained record subtype has the same size as its subtype if this size 
is less than or equal to 8 Kbyte. If the size of the subtype is greater than this, the 
object has the size necessary to store its current value; storage space is allocated and 
released as the discriminants of the record change. 


Alignment of a record subtype 

When no record representation clause applies to its base type, a record subtype has the 
same alignment as the component with the highest alignment requirement. 

When a record representation clause that does not contain an alignment clause applies to 
its base type, a record subtype has the same alignment as the component with the highest 
alignment requirement which has not been overridden by its component clause. 

When a record representation clause that contains an alignment clause applies to its base 
type, a record subtype has an alignment that obeys the alignment clause.

5 Conventions for Implementation-Generated Names 


Special record components are introduced by the Compiler for certain record type 
definitions. Such record components are implementation-dependent; they are used by 
the Compiler to improve the quality of the generated code for certain operations on the 
record types. The existence of these components is established by the Compiler 
depending on implementation-dependent criteria. Attributes are defined for referring to 
them in record representation clauses. An error message is issued by the Compiler if the 
user refers to an implementation-dependent component that does not exist. If the 
implementation-dependent component exists, the Compiler checks that the storage 
location specified in the component clause is compatible with the treatment of this 
component and the storage locations of other components. An error message is issued if 
this check fails. 

There are four such attributes: 

TRECORD_SIZE For a prefix T that denotes a record type. This attribute 

refers to the record component introduced by the Compiler 
in a record to store the size of the record object. This 
component exists for objects of a record type with 
defaulted discriminants when the sizes of the record 
objects depend on the values of the discriminants. 

TVARIANT_INDEX For a prefix T that denotes a record type. This attribute 

refers to the record component introduced by the Compiler 
in a record to assist in the efficient implementation of 
discriminant checks. This component exists for objects of 
a record type with variant type. 

C’ARRAYDESCRIPTOR 

For a prefix C that denotes a record component of an 
array type whose component subtype definition depends on 
discriminants. This attribute refers to the record 
component introduced by the Compiler in a record to store 
information on subtypes of components that depend on 
discriminants. 

CRECORD__DESCRIPTOR 

For a prefix C that denotes a record component of a 
record type whose component subtype definition depends 
on discriminants. This attribute refers to the record 
component introduced by the Compiler in a record to store 
information on subtypes of components that depend on 
discriminants.

6 Address Clauses 


6.1 Address Clauses for Objects 

An address clause can be used to specify an address for an object as described in [13.5]. 
When such a clause applies to an object no storage is allocated for it in the program 
generated by the Compiler. The program accesses the object using the address specified 
in the clause. 

An address clause is not allowed for task objects, nor for unconstrained records whose 
size is greater than 8 Kbyte. 


6.2 Address Clauses for Program Units 

Address clauses for program units are not implemented in the current version of the 
Compiler. 


6.3 Address Clauses for Entries 

Address clauses for entries are not implemented in the current version of the Compiler.

7 Restrictions on Unchecked Conversions 


Unconstrained arrays are not allowed as target types. 

Unconstrained record types without defaulted discriminants are not allowed as target 
types. 

If the source and the target types are each scalar or access types, the sizes of the objects 
of the source and target types must be equal. If a composite type is used either as the 
source type or as the target type this restriction on the size does not apply. 

If the source and the target types are each of scalar or access type or if they are both of 
composite type, the effect of the function is to return the operand. 

In other cases the effect of unchecked conversion can be considered as a copy: 

■ if an unchecked conversion is achieved of a scalar or access source type to a 
composite target type, the result of the function is a copy of the source 
operand: the result has the size of the source. 

■ if an unchecked conversion is achieved of a composite source type to a scalar 
or access target type, the result of the function is a copy of the source 
operand: the result has the size of the target.

8 Input-Output Packages 


The predefined input-output packages SEQUENTlAL_IO [14.2.3], DlRECT_lO [14.2.5], 
and TEXT_IO [14.3.10] are implemented as described in the Language Reference 
Manual, as is the package IO_EXCEPTIONS [14.5], which specifies the exceptions that 
can be raised by the predefined input-output packages. 

The package LOW__LEVEL_IO [14.6], which is concerned with low-level machine- 
dependent input-output, has not been implemented. 

All accesses to the services of the host system are provided through the INMOS supplied 
iserver tool, so much of Ada input-output is host independent. 


8.1 NAME Parameter 

No special treatment is applied to the NAME parameter supplied to the Ada procedures 
CREATE or OPEN [14.2.1]. This parameter is passed immediately on to the INMOS 
server and from there to the host operating system. The file name can thus be in any 
format acceptable to the host system. 


8.2 FORM Parameter 

The FORM parameter comprises a set of attributes formulated according to the lexical 
rules of [2], separated by commas. The FORM parameter may be given as a null string 
except when DIRECT__IO is instantiated with an unconstrained type; in this case the 
RECORD_SlZE attribute must be provided. Attributes are comma-separated; blanks 
may be inserted between lexical elements as desired. In the descriptions below the 
meanings of natural , positive , etc., are as in Ada; attribute keywords (represented in 
upper case) are identifiers [2.3] and as such may be specified without regard to case. 

USE_ERROR is raised if the FORM parameter does not conform to these rules. 

The attributes are as follows: 


File sharing attribute 

This attribute allows control over the sharing of one external file between several 
internal files within a single program. In effect it establishes rules for subsequent OPEN 
and CREATE calls which specify the same external file. If such rules are violated or if 
a different file sharing attribute is specified in a later OPEN or CREATE call, 
USE__ERROR will be raised. The syntax is as follows: 

NOT_SHARED | 

SHARED *> access mode 


where 

access_mode ::= READERS | SINGLE_WRITER ) ANY 


36 


Alsys transputer Ada Compiler, Appendix F, v4.0 



A file sharing attribute of: 

NOT__SHARED 

implies only one internal file may access the external file. 

SHARED => READERS 

imposes no restrictions on internal files of mode IN_FILE, but prevents any 
internal files of mode OUT_FILE or IN0UT_F1LE being associated with 
the external file. 

SHARED => SINGLE_WRITER 

is as SHARED => READERS, but in addition allows a single internal file of 
mode OUT_FILE or INOUT_FILE. 

SHARED => ANY 

places no restrictions on external file sharing. 

If a file of the same name has previously been opened or created, the default is taken 
from that file’s sharing attribute, otherwise the default depends on the mode of the file: 
for mode IN_FILE the default is SHARED => READERS, for modes INOUT__FILE 
and OUT FILE the default is NOT SHARED. 


Record size and record unit attributes 

These attributes control the structure of external binary files. 

A binary file can be viewed as a sequence (sequential access) or a set (direct access) of 
consecutive records, each of the following structure: 

( HEADER j OBJECT [ UNUSED_PART ] 

where: 


■ OBJECT is the exact binary representation of the Ada object in the 
executable program (possibly including an implicit object descriptor). 

■ HEADER contains two word sized values, the length of the object and the 
length of the descriptor. 

■ UNUSED_PART is a gap of variable size to permit full control of the 
record’s size. 

The HEADER is only implemented if the actual parameter of the instantiation of the 10 
package is unconstrained. 

The formats of the file structure attributes are as follows: 

RECORD_SIZE => size_in_bytes 


Appendix F. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


37 



RECORD_UNIT => size_in_bytes 

In the case of DIRECT_IO for unconstrained types the user is required to specify the 
RECORD_SIZ£ attribute. However, for SEQUENTIAL_IO for unconstrained types the 
attribute is illegal. USE_ERROR will be raised by the OPEN or CREATE procedures 
if either of these checks fail. 

In all cases the value given must not be smaller than a mininum size. For constrained 
types, this minimum size is ELEMENT_TYPE'SIZE / SYSTEM.STORAGE_UNIT; 
LJSE_ERROR will be raised if this rule is violated. For unconstrained types, the 
minimum size is ELEMENT_TYPE’DESCRIPTOR_SIZE / SYSTEM.STORAGEJUNIT 
plus the size of the largest record which is to be read or written. If a larger record is 
processed DATA_ERROR will be raised by the READ or WRITE. 

If no RECORD_SlZE attribute is specified for constrained types, the default value of 
the object’s size is assumed. In this case no UNUSED_PART will be implemented. 

The RECORDUNIT attribute is only applicable to SEQUENTIAL_IO for 
unconstrained types; it has a default value of I. If specified, the record size will be the 
smallest multiple of this value that holds the object and its length. This is the only case 
where a file may contain variable length records. 


Buffer size attribute 

This attribute controls the size of the buffer used as a cache for input-output operations: 
BUFFER_SIZE => size_in__bytes 

The default value for BUFFER_SIZE is 0, which means no buffering. 


Append 

This attribute may only be used in the FORM parameter of the OPEN command. If 
used in the FORM parameter of the CREATE command, USE_ERROR will be raised. 

The affect of this attribute is to cause writing to commence at the end of the existing 
file. 

The syntax of the APPEND attribute is simply: 

APPEND 

The default is APPEND =>• FALSE, but this is over-ridden if this attribute is specified. 


8.3 USEERROR 

The following conditions will cause USE_ERROR to be raised: 

■ Specifying a FORM parameter whose syntax does not conform to the rules 
given above.

WITHDRAWN TESTS 


APPENDIX D 
WITHDRAWN TESTS 


Some tests are withdrawn from the ACVC because they do not conform to the Ada Standard. 

The following 44 tests had been withdrawn at the time of validation testing for the reasons 

indicated. A reference of the form Al-ddddd is to an Ada Commentary. 

E28005C This test expects that the string TOP OF PAGE. --63" of line 204 will appear 
at the top of the listing page due to a pragma PAGE in line 203; but line 203 
contains text that follows the pragma, and it is this that must appear at the top of 
the page. 

A39005G This test unreasonably expects a component clause to pack an array component into 
a minimum size (line 30). 

B97102E This test contains an unintended illegality: a select statement contains a null 
statement at the place of a selective wait alternative (line 31). 

C97116A This test contains race conditions, and it assumes that guards are evaluated 
indivisibly. A conforming implementation may use interleaved execution in such 
a way that the evaluation of the guards at lines 50 & 54 and the execution of task 
CHANGING_OF_THE_GUARD results in a call to REPORT.FAILED at one of 
lines 52 or 56. 

BC3009B This test wrongly expects that circular instantiations will be detected in several 
compilation units even though none of the units is illegal with respect to the units 
it depends on; by AI-00256, the illegality need not be detected until execution is 
attempted (line 95). 

CD2A62D This test wrongly requires that an array object’s size be no greater than 10 although 
its subtype’s size was specified to be 40 (line 137). 

CD2A63A..D, CD2A66A..D, CD2A73A..D, CD2A76A..D [16 tests] 

These tests wrongly attempt to check the size of objects of a derived type (for 
which a ’SIZE length clause is given) by passing them to a derived subprogram 
(which implicitly converts them to the parent type (Ada standard 3.4:14)). 
Additionally, they use the ’SIZE length clause and attribute, whose interpretation 
is considered problematic by the WG9 ARG. 

CD2A81G, CD2A83G, CD2A84N & M, & CD5011O [5 tests] 

These tests assume that dependent tasks will terminate while the main program 
executes a loop that simply tests for task termination; this is not the case, and the 
main program may loop indefinitely (lines 74, 85, 86 & 96, 86 & 96, and 58, resp.).

WITHDRAWN TESTS 


CD2B15C & CD7205C 

These tests expect that a ’STORAGE_SIZE length clause provides precise control 
over the number of designated objects in a collection; the Ada standard 13.2:15 
allows that such control must not be expected. 

CD2D11B This test gives a SMALL representation clause for a derived fixed-point type (at 
line 30) that defines a set of model numbers that are not necessarily represented 
in the parent type; by Commentary AI-00099, all model numbers of a derived 
fixed-point type must be representable values of the parent type. 

CD5007B This test wrongly expects an implicitly declared subprogram to be at the the address 
that is specified for an unrelated subprogram (line 303). 

ED7004B, ED7005C & D, ED7006C & D (5 tests] 

These tests check various aspects of the use of the three SYSTEM pragmas; the 
AVO withdraws these tests as being inappropriate for validation. 

CD7105A This test requires that successive calls to CALENDAR.CLOCK change by at least 
SYSTEM.TICK; however, by Commentary AI-00201, it is only the expected 
frequency of change that must be at least SYSTEM.TICK-particular instances of 
change may be less (line 29). 

CD7203B, & CD7204B 

These tests use the ’SIZE length clause and attribute, whose interpretation is 
considered problematic by the WG9 ARG. 

This test checks an invalid test objective: it treats the specification of storage to 
be reserved for a task’s activation as though it were like the specification of storage 
for a collection. 

This test requires that objects of two similar scalar types be distinguished when read 
from a file-DATA_ERROR is expected to be raised by an attempt to read one 
object as of the other type. However, it is not clear exactly how the Ada standard 
14.2.4:4 is to be interpreted; thus, this test objective is not considered valid, (line 
90) 

This test requires certain behavior, when two files are associated with the same 
external file, that is not required by the Ada standard. 

This test contains several calls to END_OF_LINE & END_OF_PAGE that have 
no parameter: these calls were intended to specify a file, not to refer to 
STANDARDJNPUT (lines 103, 107, 118, 132, & 136). 

This test requires that a text file’s column number be set to COUNT’LAST in order 
to check that LAYOUT_ERROR is raised by a subsequent PUT operation. But 
the former operation will generally raise an exception due to a lack of available disk 
space, and the test would thus encumber validation testing.
