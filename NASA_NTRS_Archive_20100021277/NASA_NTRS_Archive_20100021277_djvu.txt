Framework for Flexible 
Security in Group 
Communications 

The Antigone software system defines 
a framework for the flexible definition 
and implementation of security policies 
in group communication systems. 
Antigone does not dictate the available 
security policies, but provides high-level 
mechanisms for implementing them. A 
central element of the Antigone archi- 
tecture is a suite of such mechanisms 
comprising micro-protocols that provide 
the basic services needed by secure 
groups. Policies are implemented 
through the composition and configura- 
tion of these mechanisms. Mechanisms 
are composed in different ways to ad- 
dress new requirements and environ- 
mental constraints. The Antigone frame- 
work provides an easy-to-use application 
programming interface (API), from 
which secure group application pro- 
grams can be built. Written entirely in 
the C++ programming language, the sys- 
tem consists of over 18,000 lines of 
source code and has been ported to sev- 
eral versions of Linux, FreeBSD, and 


SunOS. Information for accessing re- 
cent versions of the source code and re- 
lated documentation is available at 
http://antigone.eecs.umich.edu.

fh Software for Collaborative 
Use of Large Interactive 
Displays 

The MERBoard Collaborative Work- 
space, which is currently being deployed 
to support the Mars Exploration Rover 
(MER) Missions, is the first instantiation 
of a new computing architecture de- 
signed to support collaborative and 
group computing using computing de- 
vices situated in NASA mission opera- 
tions rooms. It is a software system for 
generation of large-screen interactive 
displays by multiple users. The architec- 
ture provides a platform and applica- 
tions programming interface (API) for 
the development of collaborative appli- 
cations for NASA mission operations. 
The standard deployment configuration 
provides an integrated whiteboard, Web 


browser, remote viewing and control for 
collaboration over distance, and per- 
sonal and group storage spaces that pro- 
vide ubiquitous access and sharing of 
data. Customization for specific domains 
is provided through plug-ins. For the 
MER mission, plug-ins include a flow- 
charting tool for strategic rover opera- 
tions and mission planning, 3D visualiza- 
tion of the Martian terrain, a data 
navigator to navigate the mission data- 
base, and situational awareness tools. 
The MERBoard software is designed to 
run on large plasma displays with touch- 
screen overlays, thus providing an im- 
mersive and interactive environment for 
teams to view, annotate, and share data. 
The MERBoard overcomes the obstacles 
to communication, retention, and col- 
laborative modification of information 
in diverse forms that can include text, 
data (including images) from scientific 
instruments, handwritten notes, hand 
drawings, and computer graphics. The 
MERBoard provides a unifying interface 
for the integration of heterogeneous ap- 
plications, and provides those applica- 
tions with a consistent model for saving 
and retrieving data. All applications may 
be viewed and controlled from any loca- 
tion that has a MERBoard. A personal 
client provides integration of a userâ€™s 
personal computing environment with 
the MERBoard environment.
