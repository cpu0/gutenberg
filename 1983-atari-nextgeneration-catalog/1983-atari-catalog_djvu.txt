THE ATARI 600XL 

HOME COMPUTER 



eature for feature, your best value 




"ow can do 
almost anything ] 
with an ATARI,' 
—David Btiehler, 
Student 

Though just a high school 
junior, 17 year old David Buehler 
has a $25,000 bank account after 
winning this year's AtariStar 
Award for his educational pro- 
gram, "Typo Attack." 

David's interest in programming 
began in the 8th grade when he 
acquired his first computer. A 
couple of years later, he bought 
an ATARI Home Computer 
because among its many virtues, 
"The graphics are so much better 
than anyone else's." The idea for 
a typing game came when David 
was learning touch typing in 
school. He programmed Typo 
Attack in a few weeks specifically 
for the Atari Program Exchange 
competition. Since winning his 
award, he's become a celebrity 
in his hometown of St. Paul, 
Minnesota. David is currently 
hard at work on his latest game, 
"Wvzle." 



Compare the features. Compare the price. You'll 
find the ATARI 600XL offers more of what you're 
looking for in a home computer, for less than you'd 
expect to pay. 

With 16K Random Access Memory (RAM), the 
ATARI 600XL Home Computer is ready to use with 
hundreds of popular programs — from entertain- 
ment to education to home management. 

For professional ease and accuracy, the ATARI 
600XL gives you a full-stroke keyboard. And there's 
more to this keyboard than meets the eye. 

Select international characters to work in French, 
German, Spanish or other European languages. 
Select graphics characters and put together charts, 
tables, and other eye-catching designs. Press the 
HELP key on selected programs and get the back- 
ground information you need to keep going. 

For simple hookup, the ATARI 600XL connects 
easily to your TV. That means you'll be able to start 
enjoying next generation computing capabilities 
almost as soon as you get your ATARI 600XL home. 

Want to learn computer programming? The built- 
in ATARI BASIC Programming Language lets you 
use all the capabilities of your ATARI 600XL — 
including 256-color graphics and 4- voice sound. 

But you don't need to know programming to use 
your ATARI 600XL, thanks to the variety of pre- 
written programs now available. 

Your ATARI 600XL becomes a full-featured word 
processing system when you add our new Atari- 
Writer program, a printer, and program recorder. 
Select educational programs for young or old and 
your ATARI 600XL becomes a delightful way to 
learn at your own pace. Naturally, Atari's popular 
game titles are available for your ATARI 600XL — 
from fast-action arcade hits to strategy adventures. 



And when you're ready for more from your 
ATARI 600XL, it grows to meet your needs with an 
expansion connection that allows the ATARI 600XL 
Home Computer to access a Memory Module for 
64K of RAM power. 

Feature for feature, dollar for dollar, you'll have a 
hard time matching the ATARI 600XL Home 
Computer.

u 



I A /hat used to take 4 hours, 
If lr now takes 30 minutes." 
— Tay Vaughan, Marine Surveyor 

Tay Vaughan is often found 
aboard leaky boats. As an 
independent marine surveyor, he 
evaluates construction methods, 
seaworthiness, and operating safe- 
ty for various clients. 

At college, Tay realized com- 
puter literacy was necessary, so he 
taught himself programming. To- 
day his ATARI Home Computer 
saves time and provides greater 
accuracy. "I use my computer to 
analyze shipwrecks, collisions, 
and repair costs," he remarks. 
"Being able to generate thorough 
and consistently reliable reports 
makes a tremendous difference, 
particularly in legal cases where I 
am called as an expert witness. 
It's become a vital tool." And 
there's more time to devote to 
really important things... like 
sailing! 



In addition to all the essential features of the ATARI 
600XL, the ATARI 800XL Home Computer has 
three times the memory with 64K Random Access 
Memory (RAM) — and more memory means more 
power! 

With more memory you have the power to run 
any of over 2000 programs available for ATARI 
Home Computers. 

More memory makes organizing files with your 
ATARI 800XL Home Computer as easy as adding a 
disk drive and The Home Filing Manager program. 
Anything from addresses to zoology notes can be 
immediately accessible right from the keyboard. 

Additional memory means you can turn your 
ATARI Home Computer into a powerful business 
machine when you use it with the ATARI 
Bookkeeper for professional quality accounting 
— or with ATARI Visicalc* for expansive financial 
modeling. 

For word processing, extra memory gives you 
expanded storage capacity when used with our new 
AtariWriter program, a disk drive and a printer. 

With 64K of memory you can create more 
elaborate sound and graphics programs with the 
ATARI 800XL and its built-in ATARI BASIC. Or try 
advanced programming languages like Microsoft 
BASIC II to really stretch your range of creative 
options. 

But even it you don't write your own programs, 
you can take full advantage of the unsurpassed Atari 
sound and graphics capabilities with programs that 
already exist. Our intriguing personal development 
programs, like PAINT, let you create your own 
colorful works of art. And our Conversational 
Languages programs use actual recorded voices. 

Games? You can't choose an ATARI Computer 
without choosing the best in home entertainment 
and real arcade action. 



In the future, if you want to add more powerful 
peripherals, you'll be able to, because the ATARI 
800XL includes an expansion connection for future 
generations of computer components. 

Like every new ATARI Home Computer, the 
800XL has a full stroke keyboard, HELP key, an 
international character set, a self-testing Program 
and more. So if you're looking for the most 
memory for the money, the ATARI 800XL is the 
computer you should look into.

HOME COMPUTER 



jhe computer that talks to you — and to the world/ 




: l/|/ith the ATARI ATP System, 

V V the current rankings are 
instantaneously available around 
the world." 

— Ron Bookman, Director of 
Communications, Association of 
Tennis Professionals 

Ron Bookman represents the 
ATP at tournaments all over the 
globe. 

Part of his job is supervising the 
ATARI Home Computer system 
used to rank the top 1 ,000 profes- 
sional players each week. In addi- 
tion to calculating player rankings, 
the ATARI Computer also pro- 
vides biographical information, 
match histories by opponent, sur- 
face or tournament, and more. 
This information is available to 
ATARI Computer users 
everywhere via CompuServe. 

"We get a lot of letters asking 
about this capability," says Ron. 
Just don't ask the ATP if their 
computer can improve your 
backhand. 



The ATARI 1400XL Home Computer talks to other 
computers through its built-in modem — and talks 
to you with its built-in speech capability. 

With the built-in direct connect modem, you can 
read the stock market quotes or the latest business 
news from your own living room. Bank, shop, or 
communicate by electronic mail. Access the rapidly 
expanding network of subscription services like 
THE SOURCE, AMERICA'S INFORMATION 
UTILITY, DOW JONES NEWS/RETRIEVAL Service 
and COMPUSERVE. Tap into special interest 
bulletin boards or gather research from a wide 
range of library data bases. 

With the built-in speech output, the ATARI 
1400XL really speaks your language. You can pro- 
gram it to say anything by using the built-in ATARI 
BASIC Programming Language. And many new Atari 
programs are being planned to include speech 
synthesis. 

Like every home computer in the XL line, the 
ATARI 1400XL includes a full-stroke keyboard, a 
HELP key, programmable control keys, and an 
international character set — in addition to 64K 
RAM (Random Access Memory) and a Self- Test 
program to update you on your computer's 
performance each time you turn it on. 

To insure years of continued enjoyment and 
upgradable expandability, the ATARI 1400XL Home 
Computer includes an expansion connection for 
future peripherals and accessories. 

Discover the excitement of learning, the effi- 
ciency of home management, the challenge of 
programming, and the creativity of graphics and 
sounds. With the ATARI 1400XL Home Computer, 
the world is your domain. The only limit is your 
imagination.

• "Thete are so many things 
I you can do it's really freed 
up my time to be more creative." 
— Karin Fidrych, Proprietor, 
Charles Dickens Restaurant 

Karin Fidrych worked in other 
people's restaurants to put herself 
through college. Three years ago, 
she realized a dream by purchas- 
ing The Charles Dickens in Aptos, 
near Santa Cruz on the California 
coast. 

Last year, a friend introduced 
Karin to his new ATARI Home 
Computer which she used to keep 
track of constantly changing 
supplies and prices. It cut the time 
required for this task in half, and 
she began to think up new ap- 
plications. Now Karin uses the 
computer to generate financial 
reports, update a mailing list, and 
analyze where her customers live 
to help plan advertising. "If I had 
known about ATARI Computers 
earlier, I would have used them 
then." Practically the only thing 
still done by hand at The Charles 
Dickens is the cooking. 



Now you don't need separate components to store 
and retrieve information or programs, because the 
ATARI 1450XLD has its own built-in, double-sided, 
dual-density disk drive. So with this one compact 
unit, you can instantly access, work with, and save 
up to 200 pages (254K bytes of information) on a 
single 5 'A -inch diskette. 

With an ATARI 1450XLD Home Computer, you 
have the power to use complex financial programs, 
involved word processing, or any other applica- 
tions where fast retrieval and storage of information 
is vital. You have faster access to anything on 
diskette, because the disk drive built into the ATARI 
1450XLD is connected directly to the computer's 
processor bus. 

To let you talk to the world, the 1450XLD has a 
built-in modem that connects directly to your 
phone lines. And to let your computer talk to you, 
the ATARI 1450XLD also includes a speech syn- 
thesizer. 

The ATARI 1450XLD also gives you functional 
features, like a magnetically isolated compartment 
for diskette storage or an additional disk drive, and 
a case that's strong enough to support a TV or 
video monitor. And with an expansion connection 
for adding future peripherals and accessories, you'll 
always be able to update or broaden your com- 
puter's applications. 

Like every home computer in the XL line, the 
ATARI 1450XLD includes a full stroke keyboard, a 
HELP key, programmable function keys, and an in- 
ternational character set — in addition to 64K RAM 
(Random Access Memory) and a Self-Test program 
to update you on your computer's performance 
each time you turn it on. 

For the ultimate in integrated technology and 
sophisticated ease-of-operation, only the ATARI 
1450XLD gives you the all-in-one convenience of 
computing, communicating, and information 
storage in one elegantly simple design.

GETTING ORGANIZED. 
Here are three programs to 
organize both your time and files. 
You supply the information. Your

TIMEWISE. Now there's a way 
to organize something you never 
seem to find enough of: time. 

With Timewise you can keep 
track of important business 
meetings as well as special per- 
sonal events. For ongoing dates 
like appointments and classes, 
one entry takes care of them all. 

Used with your ATARI printer, 
Timewise lets you select from a 
variety of ways to put your 
schedule on paper. Print your 
day's activities or create an 
itinerary for the week. It's a lot 
easier than carrying around a 
calendar for the whole year. You 
can even print a monthly calendar 
in which special events are 
highlighted. 

The best part of Timewise is 
that it not only keeps track of 
dates, it helps you organize your 
time.

22 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 



D 



iscover the languages of the next generation 



PROGRAMMING IS ONE 
OF THE MOST EXCITING 
and rewarding activities you 
can embark upon with your 
ATARI Home Computer. For 
whatever your experience 
level, or for whatever you'd 
like to create — there s a 
programming language 
that's right for you. 



ATARI BASIC. Because of its 
English-like commands, easy-to- 
understand order and versatility, 
BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose 
Symbolic Instruction Code) has 
grown to be the world's most 
popular computer programming 
language. 

ATARI BASIC utilizes the full 
scope of your 256-color ATARI 
graphics and 4- voice, 3 1/2 
octave, ATARI sound. So you can 
program your own personalized 
games! 

ATARI BASIC is a floating-point 
BASIC with 9-digit precision. It is 
capable of manipulating a variety 
of strings, including words and 
graphics characters. So you can 
write your own programs to deal 
with organizing and calculating all 
kinds of information. 

Advanced commands, such as 
PEEK and POKE and the ability 
to execute assembly language 
subroutines means you can talk 
directly to the heart of your 
computer's Central Processing 
Unit — for faster, more effective 
programming. 




ATARI BASIC is easy enough 
for the novice to make immediate 
headway with, yet powerful 
enough for the advanced 
programmer to continue with 
indefinitely. To get you started in 
BASIC programming, we've put 
together a 3-part learning series, 
"Invitation to Programming", 
complete with tutorial cassettes 
and graphic demonstrations. 

Many of the ATARI programs 
featured in this catalog are written 
in BASIC, so they require the 
ATARI BASIC cartridge or an 
ATARI Home Computer with 
built-in BASIC to run. 



ATARI MICROSOFT BASIC. 

Once you've mastered BASIC, 
you'll appreciate the enhance- 
ments you'll encounter in ATARI 
Microsoft BASIC. 

ATARI Microsoft BASIC 
provides floating point precision 
to 16 digits (transcendental func- 
tions to 6 digits). Its powerful 
graphics and sound capabilities 
make it an ideal language for the 
creative programmer. 

To spare you the tedium of 
renumbering lengthy programs 
there's a convenient renumber 
command. And for easy format- 
ting and justifying of custom 
print-outs and screens, there are 
handy Print Using commands. 

Errors are described in plain 
English and only after you RUN 
your program. So simple typos 
won't disturb your train of 
thought. And you can set up 
strings at any point in your 
program, without dimensioning 
them up front. You'll be able to 
create multidimensional arrays of 
variables and strings within the 
same program. 



Accompanying documentation 
explains unique Atari features such 
as player/missile graphics, char- 
acter set definition, color and 
sound parameters. ATARI Micro- 
soft BASIC offers many additional 
powerful commands, is faster than 
ATARI BASIC, and is particularly 
suitable for use in more advanced 
software development.

ATARI MICROSOFT BASIC II. 

The new cartridge version of 
the original program — designed 
to run on all ATARI Home 
Computers. The cartridge itself 
contains the most useful features 
of the original ATARI Microsoft 
BASIC, and an extension diskette 
is included to give you all the 
power of the original. ATARI 
Microsoft BASIC II includes both 
a Reference Manual and a handy 
User's Guide to help you make 
use of the variety of programs 
already available in this popular 
programming language.

ASSEMBLER EDITOR. For 

fast, more efficient programs, it's 
hard to beat the programming 
power of the ATARI Assembler 
Editor. Utilizing its English-based 
abbreviations and acronyms, you 
can put together programs in 
machine language without having 
to deal directly in bits and bytes. 

BASIC programmers will 
appreciate the power to create 
subroutines with Assembler Editor 
and insert them into BASIC 
programs — routines that can 
help save time and valuable 
memory when creating complex 
graphics and sound displays.

ATARI MACRO ASSEMBLER 
AND PROGRAM TEXT 
EDITOR. Advanced program- 
mers and software developers 
know that the creation of any 
complex program requires a great 
amount of fine-tuning and revis- 
ing. That's when the ATARI Macro 
Assembler and Program Text 
Editor can become your best 
friend. 

Instead of forcing you to 
change a variable or value line by 
line, this valuable programming 
utility allows global revisions in 
just a few simple steps. 

With the Macro Assembler you 
can also change colors, revise 
graphics and alter sound routines 
throughout your program without 
retyping all the statements. Listing 
control, cross reference, and con- 
ditional assembly tables gives you 
valuable overviews of program 
operations. 

Any serious programmer should 
seriously consider ATARI Macro 
Assembler and Program Text 
Editor.

ATARI LOGO. Plug in an 
ATARI Logo Programming 
Language cartridge, and enter a 
stimulating environment where 
mathematical and logical thinking 
become second nature. ATARI 
Logo is elegantly simple, so pre- 
schoolers can explore profound 
ideas in words they can under- 
stand. Yet it's easily expandable 
so that experienced programmers 
can satisfy their creative desires. 

Learners of all ages gain insights 
into geometry, math, or physics 
using ATARI Logo's Turtle 
Graphics, enhanced by the 
renowned sound and color capa- 
bilities of ATARI Home Compu- 
ters. Create imaginative animation 
or video games by controlling 
ATARI Logo's four dynamic 
"turtles." 

ATARI Logo is built on state-of- 
the-art artificial intelligence 
concepts such as list processing. 
Ordinary words, even sentences, 
can be moved, changed, and 
transformed to simulate the rich- 
ness and complexity of human 
speech. 

At last, there's a computer 
language that lets you start at your 
own level — and explore to the 
limits of your imagination.

this is the only decision you'll 
ever need to make when you

HE SOFTWARE WRITTEN 
BY PEOPLE LIKE YOU! 



There are thousands of ATARI 
Home Computer owners. Many 
of them write their own software 
programs. And when they think 
they have something that other 
ATARI owners might like, they 
send it to the ATARI Program 
Exchange (APX). If the APX 
reviewers agree, it's published as 
an APX title. So it's made available 
at a very fair price to ATARI users 
everywhere. If your program 
becomes popular enough, we may 
make it a part of the regular 
ATARI program lineup — just as 
we did with My First Alphabet 
and Caverns of Mars. APX authors 
are even eligible for a share of 
$100,000 in prizes awarded 
annually! 

There are currently over 180 
APX software programs in enter- 
tainment, education, business 
applications and systems software. 
And it's all written by and for 
people just like you!
