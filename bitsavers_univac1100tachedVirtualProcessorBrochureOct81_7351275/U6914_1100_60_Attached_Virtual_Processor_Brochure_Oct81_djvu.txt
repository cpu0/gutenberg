i "-(vestment Protection with a Future. 



You have a great deal invested in your 
system: time, money, experience and 
applications. 

That's an investment you want to 
protect, because the alternative is both 
costly and disruptive. Even bargain- 
price hardware is no bargain if you 
have to suffer through the confusion 
and waste that is all too often involved 
in complete conversion. 

Now you can protect your investment 
and avoid the waste of conversion. The 
answer is the new SPERRY UNIVAC 
1100/60 Series Attached Virtual 
Processor (AVP). 

The 1100/60 Series AVP offers you a 
number of significant advantages: 

l^, It meets your needs for increased 
functionality at the lowest possible 
cost. 

□ It's new, easy-to-use software can 
greatly improve your data-access 
capabilities and productivity 

□ It protects the investment you have in 
your current hardware. You can 
continue to use all your existing 
peripherals on the AVP, or you can

elect to utilize the latest technology 
peripherals available with the 
1100/60 Series. 

□ It protects the investment you have in 
your current applications. As you 
know, all application programs have 
a finite life cycle after which they 
must be extensively updated, or 
re-written. The 1100/60 Series AVP 
will allow your application programs 
to run their normal life cycle and when 
the time comes to re-systematize, it 
can be done under 1100 OS instead 
of VS/9. 

□ Compatibility with your present 
virtual system means no disruption 
to your current data processing. 
Therefore you will not have to 
"freeze" all current application 
development because you are faced 
with an immediate conversion effort. 
Additionally, the resources that 
would normally be required to 
address the conversion are now 
available for other projects. 

The 1100/60 Series AVP has been 
designed specifically to execute the 
VS/9 Operating System, running under 




the control of the time-tested and 
versatile 1100 Operating System. The 
system consists of a newly designed, 
Series 90 compatible processing unit 
operating in a multi-processor 
environment with any 1100/60 Series 
processor. Application programs can 
be executed on the AVP without the 
need for modification. 

With the AVP, you have the opportunity 
to enjoy the benefits of the latest 
advances in architectural and circuit 
technology at the level of power and 
performance that will meet your 
present and projected needs. It gives 
you processing resources and 
functionality far beyond those available 
in VS/9 — resources and functionality 
that you can take advantage of 
according to your own timetable. 

All in all, the AVP is powerful proof that 
Sperry Univac respects your present 
system investment, and is fully 
committed'to providing you with new- 
technology hardware and software — 
products you will need to protect your 
information-processing investment in 
the future. 



Full Service Capability. 



Business Applications . 



For increased functionality and power, 
the AVP system blends both Series 90 
and Series 1100 hardware and 
software. As mentioned, VS/9 and 
1100 OS operate separately, yet 
simultaneously, except for input/output 
functions. APCS (Attached Processor 
Control Software), the Series 1100 
control program, provides the interface 
for input/output functions. 

The AVP can be configured with any 
processor offered in the 1100/60 
Series, giving you a choice of 
processing levels to meet your specific 
requirements. For added growth, each 
processor can be field-upgraded to 
the next model. 

The 1100/60 systems support a wide 
variety of subsystems that will increase 
the versatility and range of your 
computer system including advanced 
disk storage devices, magnetic tape 
storage, communications equipment, 
paper peripherals — a full complement 
of input-output equipment for every 
purpose. 

Not only does the AVP provide 
improved data processing performance, 
it also offers new or improved services 
not possible on your current system.

Communications Orientation. 



Interactive Application Development.., 



The AVP maintains your total 
communications environment. Remote 
access to the AVP is provided with 
either the Multichannel 
Communications Controller (MCC) or 
the Distributed Communications 
Processor (DCP/40). If you need more 
processing and storage capacity, 
merely attach your MCC and the 
complete terminal environment directly 
to the AVP and continue processing as 
before. 

If you wish to expand your 
communications facilities, consider the 
DCP/40. It provides remote users with 
all the VS/9 facilities currently available 
and with the entire range of services 
and facilities available with 1100 OS. 

Thus, operating from a single remote 
terminal, you can utilize existing VS/9 
procedures as before or begin to use 
the new and expanded features 
provided by 1100 OS. Now 
applications, delayed due to restrictive 
hardware capacity or software 
capabilities of the VS/9 system, can 
be implemented with the combined 
VS/9-1100 facilities made available by 
the AVP. 




As you know, the interactive program 
development facilities available with 
VS/9 are powerful tools which aid 
rapid development of application 
programs. They increase productivity, 
reduce application development costs 
and improve customer service. 

The Interactive Processing Facility 
(IPF), available under 1100 OS, 
extends and enhances the already 
versatile interactive capabilities of 
VS/9. IPF, which incorporates 
advances in software and hardware, 
provides the VS/9 user with a system 
view that is familiar, yet new and 
stimulating. 

IPF provides a wide choice of program 
products that are easily accessed \ 
through a command and response ^ 
language. Following are some 
advantages of IPF 1100: 

□ Access to end-user facilities such 
as:
