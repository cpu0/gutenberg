ABSTRACT 

We present Chandra X-ray observations of the radio-quiet QSO PG 2302-1-029. This quasar has a 
rare system of ultra-high velocity (—56,000 km s~^) UV absorption lines that form in an outflow from 
the active nucleus (Jannuzi et al. 2003). The Chandra data indicate that soft X-ray absorption is also 
present. We perform a joint UV and X-ray analysis, using photoionization calculations, to detemine the 
nature of the absorbing gas. The UV and X-ray datasets were not obtained simultaneously. Nonetheless, 
our analysis suggests that the X-ray absorption occurs at high velocities in the same general region as the 
UV absorber. There are not enough constraints to rule out multi-zone models. In fact, the distinct broad 
and narrow UV line profiles clearly indicate that multiple zones are present. Our preferred estimates 
of the ionization and total column density in the X-ray absorber (logf/ = 1.6, Nn = 10^^'^ cm"^) over 
predict the VI AA1032, 1038 absorption unless the X-ray absorber is also outflowing at ~ 56,000 km 
s~^, but they over predict the Ne VIII AA770, 780 absorption at all velocities. If we assume that the 
X-ray absorbing gas is outflowing at the same velocity of the UV-absorbing wind and that the wind is 
radiatively accelerated, then the outflow must be launched at a radius of < 10^^ cm from the central 
continuum source. The smallness of this radius casts doubts on the assumption of radiative acceleration.

to radiatively accelerate an outflow with a large column 



aensity, unless it is launcnea trom tne inner most regions 
of the accretion disk. 

In this paper we will discuss Chandra X-ray observations 
of the QSO PG 2302+029. This object shows a system of 
intrinsic UV absorption lines that have a velocity shift of 
—56,000 km s"^ (Jannuzi et al. 1996) with respect to the 
systemic velocity of the QSO {zems - 1.044). The system 
consists of NALs [FWHM « 330 km s'^) at z = 0.7016 
and a "mini-BAL" system {FWHM « 3300 km s"^) at 
z = 0.695 (Jannuzi et al. 1996; 1998). It is also character- 
ized by being an X-ray faint source with an HE A 0-1 A-2 
flux upper limit at 2 keV of 4 x 10"^^ erg s~' cm~^ (Delia 
Ceca et al. 1990). Our aim is to determine the proper- 
ties of the X-ray spectrum, search for signs of absorption, 
and define the relationship between the UV and X-ray ab- 
sorbing gas. We also discuss the location of the absorber, 
and the potential implications of high-velocity X-ray ab- 
sorption for the wind dynamics. If the X-ray and UV 
absorbers are the same, then the —56, 000 km s~^ velocity 
shift of the UV absorption Hues in PG 2302-1-029 is poten- 
tially resolvable with the Advanced Imaging Spectrometer 
(ACIS), given sharp features and adequate signal-to-noise 
ratio. 

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION 

We observed PG 2302-1-029 with Chandra using ACIS 
on 7 January 2000. We used the most recent (2 Novem- 
ber 2000) re-processed data released by the Chandra X-ray 
Center for our analysis. No filtering for high background 
or bad aspect times was required because the light curves 
did not show any flare-ups in the count rate and the aspect 
solution, the pattern by which the telescope was dithered 
to distribute the incoming photons over diflFerent pixels to 
minimize pixel-to-pixel variation, did not have any out- 
lying points. We performed data extraction and calibra- 
tion using version 1.4 of the Chandra Interactive Analysis 
of Observations (CIAO). We created the response matrix 
and ancillary response files using calibration data provided 
when the chip temperature during observations was —120° 
C. 

We extracted the source counts from a circular region 
of radius of 5" while the background region was an annu- 
lus with radii between 10" and 20", both centered on the 
position of PG 2302-f029. The position of PG 2302-^029 
(a(J2000) = 23''04'"44^ <5(J2000) = -f-03°ll'46"), as de- 
termined from the ACIS image, coincides to within ~ 1" 
with the optical position of the source reported in Schnei- 
der et al. (1992). We obtained a total of 391 ± 21 counts 
in an exposure time of 48 ksec across the observed energy 
range ~ 0.4 — 4.0 keV. 

3. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS 

We bin the spectrum to have at least 30 counts/bin and 
use XSPEC (Arnaud 1996) to perform the analysis. The 
low count rate indicates that X-ray absorption may be 
present. We, therefore, consider fits to the data that in- 
clude an X-ray continuum attentuated through an ionized 
X-ray absorber. Neutral X-ray absorption can be ruled out 
because the UV spectra do not contain any low-ionization 
metal fines that can be identified with the NAL and/or 
mini-BAL systems discussed in this paper (Jannuzi et al. 
1996; Jannuzi et al. 2003). We model the ionized ab- 



sorbers using the photoiomzation coae uluuuy (i-eria. 
et al. 1998) assuming solar abundances. 

We use this code to generate grids of absorbed 'continua 
in the following way: The incident continuum is a piece- 
wise powerlaw, /^ oc u^", (Zheng et al. 1997; Laor et 
al. 1997; Telfer et al. 2002) and is displayed in Figure 1. 
The far-UV part of the spectrum is characterized by the 2- 
point spectral index aox , which relates the flux densities at 
2500 A and 2 keV: aox = 0.3841og(/^(2500A)/A(2keV)). 
We use the B magnitude of 16.3 for PG 2302-h029 to 
anchor the spectral energy distribution (SED) at 2500A, 
taking into account the appropriate fc— correction (Green 
1996). Consequently, the X-ray flux density is specified 
through aox- We step Oox from 1.6 to 2.2 in increments 
of 0.2. This effectively gives us 4 different unabsorbed 
spectra representing 4 possible intrinsic SEDs from the 
quasar's central engine, leading to 4 different intrinsic X- 
ray luminosities (cf. Figure 1). Each SED is then attenu- 
ated through an ionized absorber. The amount of absorp- 
tion largely depends on the intrinsic total hydrogen col- 
umn density, A^h (cm~^), and the ionization parameter, 
U, defined as the ratio of the density of hydrogen ioniz- 
ing photons to that of hydrogen particles (H° -I- H"*"). For 
each of our 4 SEDs, we create a grid of attenuated continua 
by calculating ionized absorbers on a grid of U and N^. 
Therefore, for every SED, there will be a grid of absorbed 
X-ray spectra identified by the (U, Nn) combinations of 
the absorber through which they were transmitted. 

XSPEC incorporates a x^ minimization scheme that al- 
lows us to find the best fitting attenuated continuum to 
the X-ray spectrum of PG 2302-t-029. We note that all 
our X-ray fits include attenuation by a Galactic column 
density of A^^"'- = 5 x 10^° cm^^ (Lockman & Savage 
1995) and the presence of an emission line with a Gaus- 
sian profile at ~ 3 keV (probably Fe Ka at the redshift 
of the QSO). The significance of the Fe Ka detection is 
clearly very low, given just 391 counts (see Figure 2), but 
we include it in our fits because the fine is plausibly present 
and it improves the x^ results. We adjust the properties of 
the best Fe Ka fit — normaHzation (1.7 x 10"^ photon s~^ 
cm-2 keV-i), width (0.3 keV), and energy (2.9 keV)— by 
hand after finding the best fit for the continuum in other 
parts of the spectrum. Our scheme also allows us to place 
the intrinsic absorber at any redshift we want. Naturally, 
we choose to place it either at the systemic redshift of the 
QSO, zxAbs = zqso ~ 1, or at the redshift of the UV 
absorption lines, zxabs = ^uvabs ~ 0.7. 

For a specific absorber redshift and for each of our 4 
grids corresponding to the 4 intrinsic SEDs, we fit the 
data, with U and A^h as free parameters, and note the 
value of the lowest reduced x^, x^> possible for that par- 
ticular SED, and hence aox, and z. Upon comparison be- 
tween the 8 xl values, we find that the lowest xl ~ 1, was 
that for the SED with intrinsic aox = 2.0, corresponding 
to a far-UV/X-ray slope of aEuv = 2.4, for both z = 0.7 
and 1.0. The rest of the SEDs are rejected at the 95% 
confidence level, regardless of the amount of intrinsic ab- 
sorption. 

The need for intrinsic absorption is illustrated in Figure 
2, where we show the X-ray spectrum of PG 2302-1-029 
together with best possible fits, for the continuum with 
aox = 2.0, with no intrinsic absorption (upper panel), and 
with an ionized absorber at z = 0.7 (lower panel). Clearly, 



^;he nt tnat includes intrinsicTlbnizeci aosorption is mucn 
better than the one that does not. In particular, the un- 
absorbed spectrum fits the data well at high energies, but 
it substantially over predicts the counts in soft X-rays. An 
X-ray absorber naturally lowers the soft X-ray flux to the 
measured values. 

Figure 3 shows overplots of the 67%, 90%, and 99% 
confidence contours from fitting the data for the case 
where the X-ray absorber is at the emission redshift, 
zxAbs = zqso (solid contours), and where the X-ray ab- 
sorber matches the UV absorber redshift, zxAbs — zuvabs 
(dotted contours). For the zxAbs = zqso case we find 
that Nn = 1022-8±o-2 cm-2 and logU = 2.2l°;^ while 
for the zxAbs = ^uvabs, Nr = lO^^-^io.i (.jn-2 and 
logU - 1.6 ± 0.3, where all errors are at the 90% con- 
fidence level. The xl in both cases is ~ 1, and therefore 
the fits do not constrain the redshift of thte X-ray ab- 
sorber. Note that these results were derived assuming a 
fixed X-ray powerlaw index of ax = 0.9. We did not ex- 
plore other X-ray spectral slopes because the data quality 
is not sufficient to constrain additional free parameters. 

4. DISCUSSION 

4.1. Intrinsic X-ray Brightness 

Our finding in Section 3 that the intrinsic aox is 2.0 for 
PG 2302-f 029 deserves more attention. It has been known 
that there is a correlation between the optical luminosity 
at 2500A of a quasar and its intrinsic Qqx (e.g., Yuan et al. 
1998 and references therein). The relation shows a wide 
scatter in the distribution. The average aox for radio quiet 
QSOs, such as PG 2302+029 (Kellerman et al. 1989), is 
1.7 (Yuan et al. 1998; VignaH, Brandt, & Schneider 2003). 
PG 2302-1-029, with ctox = 2.0 and i:^(2500A) « 10^^'^ erg 
s~^ Hz""\ is still consistent with the scatter in the L„ — aox 
distribution discussed in Yuan et al. (1998), although it is 
~ 10 o.iii ~ 6 times fainter at 2 keV, in the rest frame, 
than a quasar with comparable UV luminosity. This faint- 
ness is probably due to X-ray absorption. 

4.2. The UV /X-ray Relationship 

We perform a joint analysis of the our X-ray spectra 
and previous HST UV data (Jannuzi et al. 1996; Jannuzi 
et al. 1998; Jannuzi et al. 2003) to explore the relation- 
ship between the UV and X-ray absorbers. The HST data 
taken over two epochs (UT dates 19 May 1994 and 21, 24 
December 1998 ) reveal variability in the strength of the 
UV absorption lines (Jannuzi 2002). These results confirm 
the intrinsic nature of the UV absorption, but it is impor- 
tant to keep in mind that the X-ray observations are not 
simulateneous with the HST dataset. 

The 1994 Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) spectra 
show marginally resolved narrow absorption lines (NALs, 
FWHM « 330 km 8"^ compared to a resolution of « 270 
km s-^) of VI AA1032, 1038, Lya, N V AA1239, 1243, and 
C IV AA1548, 1551 at z^'"'''"" = 0.7016; broad absorption 
features (mini-BALs, FWHM « 3300 km s-^) from VI, 
N V, C IV are seen at z*^f* = 0.695 (Jannuzi et al. 1996). 
Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) data from 
1998 reveal that the absorption, mini-BALs and NALs, in 
O VI and N V dramatically weakened to become unmea- 
surable, while the mini-BALs of C IV also diminished in 
strength (Jannuzi 2002; Jannuzi et al. 2003). The STIS 



spectra were ootainea usmg T.ne kjI^ul, ana uzjuliXs grat- 
ings, providing coverage from 1200 to 3000 A at a spectral 
resolution of roughly R=500, or approximately a factor of 
two lower than the earlier FOS spectra. For further com- 
parison of the STIS and FOS spectra, Jannuzi et al. (2003) 
convolved the FOS spectra to match the lower resolution 
of the STIS data. The observed absorption systems were 
then fit with Gaussians to determine the equivalent widths 
and line widths for each feature. These measurements were 
used, as detailed below, to constrain the column densities 
listed in Table 1. 

From the standpoint of our analysis we are dealing ef- 
fectively with 4 UV absorbers and 1 X-ray absorber: the 
broad and narrow-line UV absorbers of the 1994 epoch, 
the broad and narrow-line UV absorbers of 1998, and the 
X-ray absorber of 2000. We compare the properties of all 
these absorbers to investigate the UV/X-ray relationship. 

We present in Figure 4 contours (solid lines) of ionic 
column densities of C IV, N V, VI, and H I gener- 
ated by photoionization calculations, using the aox = 2.0 
SED from section 3, on a grid of the ionization parame- 
ter and the total hydrogen column density, assuming solar 
abundances. The closed contours in Figure 4 are the 90% 
confidence contours calculated from the X-ray data (cf. 
Figure 3). The solid-line, closed contour is for the X-ray 
absorber at the redshift of the PG 2302+029, while the 
dotted-line one is for the X-ray absorber at the redshift 
of the UV absorber. The long-dashed and short-dashed 
contours denote the values of the ionic column densities 
from the broad lines and narrow lines, respectively, in the 
FOS spectra (see Jannuzi et al. 1996; 2003 for a detailed 
discussion of the UV data themselves). We do not show 
contours for the N V NALs since the 1239 A line appears 
to be weaker than the 1243 A line, probably due to the 
low signal-to-noise ratio, contrary to atomic physics. 

We calculated UV the ionic column densities through a 
curve-of-growth analysis (Spitzer 1978) using the equiva- 
lent widths and FWHMs (to estimate the Doppler b pa- 
rameters) reported in Jannuzi et al. (2003), under the 
assumption of homogenous complete coverage by the ab- 
sorber of the continuum source. The results are listed in 
Table 1. The Doppler b parameter is a convenient way of 
characterizing the line-of-sight velocity field; we do not im- 
ply that thermal broadening is the cause of the line width. 
We include only the lines measured directly by Jannuzi et 
al. (2003). We do not list upper limits. The only mini- 
BALs and NALs in the STIS data that are discernable are 
those of C IV (see Table 1). We do not show their contours 
in Figure 4 to avoid cluttering the plots. We assume that 
the unresolved STIS NALs have the same line widths as 
their marginally resolved FOS counterparts. 

We wish to make three comments here about the UV 
measurements. First, the C IV NAL doublets have equiv- 
alent width ratios somewhere between the optically thin, 
2:1, and the optically thick, 1:1, limits. We therefore ex- 
pect that these lines are not dominated by unresolved op- 
tically thick components, and our simple curve-of-growth 
analysis should yield reasonably accurate column densities 
that are, in any case, firm lower limits. Second, the mini- 
BALs are in fact blended doublets, implying that we have 
no contraints on partial coverage and our derived column 
densities for these fines are merely lower limits. Finally, 



given an equivalent width, we calculated the resulting ionic 
column density, the one shown in Figure 4. We assumed 
that the mini-BAL is due to a single transition. The os- 
cillator strength of this transition is the sum of the two 
oscillator strengths of the doublet. The rest wavelength of 
the single transition is the oscillator-strength-weighted av- 
erage of the rest wavelengths of the doublet lines. A more 
appropriate method would be to use the prescription pre- 
sented in Junkkarinen, Burbidge, &c Smith (1983) where an 
effective optical depth is calculated at every point across 
the line profile taking into account the combined contri- 
butions of the lines in the doublet. Upon experimentation 
with the STIS C IV mini-BALs, we found that the differ- 
ence between the two methods is ~ 30%, within the mea- 
surements errors involved and making minimal difference 
in Figure 4. 

While weak low-ionization UV absorption lines are seen 
at the redshift of the quasar and may be of a different na- 
ture than the NALs and mini-BALs we are discussing here 
(Jannuzi et al. 1998), high-ionization UV absorption lines 
are absent at this redshift. Moreover, there is no Lyman 
break, at any redshift, in the UV spectrum, and hence the 
total hydrogen column density in a low-ionization/neutral 
absorbing component is not high enough to lead to any 
observable effects on the X-ray spectrum. Our best fit 
to the X-ray absorber at zxabs = zqso over predicts the 
OVI line absorption at this redshift. In particular, the pre- 
dicted OVI column density at this redshift, 10^^'^ cm""^, 
would lead to an equivalent width of ~ 9 A and ~ 3 A 
in the observed frame if the lines have a Doppler param- 
eter of 6 w 2000 km s"! and b Pa 200 km s'^ like the 
high-velocity mini-BALs and NALs, respectively. These 
features should be detectable at ^7cr in the FOS and STIS 
spectra. Their absence suggests that the X-ray absorber is 
not at the quasar systemic velocity. Note that these results 
do not depend on our assumption of solar metallicity, as 
long as the relative metal abundances are roughly in their 
solar ratios. The X-ray absorption is dominated by metal 
ions, and we use our fits to that to predict the strength 
of the metal lines in the UV. The relative abundance of 
hydrogen, therefore, is not a significant factor. 

Another important constraint on the UV - X-ray rela- 
tionship comes from the Ne VIII column densities (Figure 
5). The Ne VIII Unes are at 770 and 780 A, within the 
spectral coverage of the STIS observations but not the 
FOS. The fact that they are high-ionization lines implies 
that they are good tracers of the X-ray gas. Our best 
fits to the X-ray data predict Ne VIII column densities 
of ~10i«-^ cm-2 if zxabs = ZQso and ~W^'^ cm-^ if 
zxabs = zuvabs- For Doppler parameters appropriate for 
the mini-BALs or NALs, b rj 2000 km s"^ or 6 w 200 km 
s~^, respectively, we find that the Ne VIII column densities 
predicted by the X-rays should produce easily measurable 
UV lines {'^ 40cr), corresponding to observed frame equiv- 
alent widths of ~ 40 A or ~ 3 A respectively. However, 
there is no Ne VIII absorption detected at either redshift. 
There are several possible explanations for the appar- 
ent discrepancies. First, the absorber overall is complex 
and time variable. The complexity is evident from the 
distinct UV kinematic components, e.g., the NALs and 
mini-BALs. Also, the column densities derived from the 
UV lines do not define an isolated location in the logf/ 



versus logVV// plane (Fig.4), suggesting that the l\AL ard 
mini-BAL regions both have multiple zones (with differ- 
ent values of U and Nh)- Third, as we have noted above,' 
the NALs and mini-BALs both varied between the 1994 
and 1998 HST observations (Jannuzi 2002), and neither 
of those measurements was simultaneous with the X-ray 
data obtained in 2000. Finally, the true uncertainties in U 
and TVh of the X-ray absorber are likely to be larger than 
shown in Figure 3. Those results are based on fits that 
fixed the underlying continuum shape. Letting both the 
continuum shape and absorber properties vary in the fit 
would clearly lead to more uncertain results — although, 
without pursuing that option, it is not clear if the the pre- 
dicted Ne VIII absorption could be as low as the upper 
limit from the UV spectrum. 

Another complication is that the UV lines may be af- 
fected by partial coverage. If the absorbing gas does not 
fully cover the background light source, as we have as- 
sumed above, then there can be unabsorbed light filling 
in the bottoms of the UV line troughs and the column 
densities inferred from the lines will be only lower limits. 
Studies of other sources show that the coverage fraction 
can differ between ions and vary with velocity (across the 
line profiles) in the same ion (Hamann et al. 1997, Bar- 
low & Sargent 1997, Barlow, Sargent &: Hamann 1997). 
Our column density estimates all assume 100% coverage. 
We can determine from the doublet ratios of the NALs 
that those lines are not optically thick absorption masked 
by partial coverage, i.e., their derived column densities 
should be reasonable (section 4.2). Moreover, we have no 
diagnostic of partial coverage for the mini-BALs. We must 
therefore keep in mind that their derived column densities 
are, strictly speaking, only lower limits. Similarily, the line 
strengths predicted from the X-ray column densities, e.g. 
for VI and Ne VIII above, are lower limits because of 
the assumption of 100% coverage in the X-ray fits. 

In summary, the strengths of most of the UV lines are 
consistent with the X-ray measurements, if the X-ray and 
UV absorbers are outflowing at the same speed. The ab- 
sence of high-ionization absorption lines at the quasar's 
redshift argues for the UV and X-ray absorbers occuring in 
the same general region at high velocity. However, the X- 
ray observations overpredict the high-ionization UV lines 
of Ne VIII at all velocities. Simultaneous UV and X-ray 
observations are needed to probe the UV - X-ray relation- 
ship further. 

4.3. Wind Dynamics 

If we assume the X-ray absorbing gas is outflowing with 
the UV absorber, then we can use the outflow velocity de- 
termined from the UV lines together with the X-ray mea- 
sured total hydrogen column density to test the viability of 
radiative acceleration of the wind. Hamann (1998) found 
that the terminal velocity (^terminal) of a radiatively accel- 
erated wind is related (cf. equation 3 of Hamann 1998) to 
the total luminosity of the quasar, the mass of its central 
blackhole, the total column density of the wind (A'^h), the 
radius at which it is launched (Riaunch), and the fraction 
(/l) of incident continuum energy absorbed or scattered 
by the wind along an average line of sight. 

For BALs, Hamann (1998) estimated that /z, could be 
on the order of a few tenths. However, the narrower and 
shallower lines in PG 2302-1-029 will intercept less con- 



miuum [lux. iviureuver, luwer uuiuiiiii awribiiies compareu 
to BAL flows imply that reprocessing overall is less ef- 
ficient. We, therefore, assume that fi < 0.1 for our 
present analysis. We also adopt representative values of 
the blackhole mass, 10^ M©, and luminosity, 10^® erg s~^, 
which is the Eddington luminosity associated with that 
mass. We assume that vterminai = 56,000 km s~^ and 
A^H = 2.34 X 10^^ cm~^. These values are the outflow 
velocity of the UV lines (Jannuzi et al. 1996) and the 
column density we determined from the X-rays if the ab- 
sorber is at 2 = 0.7 (see end of section 3). Substituting all 
these numbers into equation (3) of Hamann (1998), we find 
that the launch radius is < 10^^ cm « 100 Rschwarzchiid- 
Therefore, if the wind is radiatively accelerated, it must 
be launched very near to the black hole. 

The mass loss rate implied by this radius is < 0.1 Q M© 
yr"^, where Q is the global covering factor n/47r (Hamann 
& Brandt 2002, in preparation). The density of the flow 
at this launch radius should be n^ ^ 10'^ cm~^, if it is 
photoionized with logU — 1.6 appropriate for the X-ray 
absorber (see Hamann & Brandt 2002 for explicit equa- 
tions). 

4.4. Geometry and Physical Models 

The small launch radius required for a high-velocity X- 
ray absorber may be problematic for models of the out- 
flow in PG 2302+029. For comparison, this maximum 
launch radius is much smaller than the nominal radius of 
the broad emission line region for a quasar of the same 
luminosity (Rblr ~ 2 x 10^* cm, based on reverberation 
studies, e.g., Kaspi et al. 2000). On the other hand, the 
size of the X-ray continuum source is ~ 10^^ cm (e.g., 
Peterson 1993), an order of magnitude smaller than the 
launch radius derived above. Given the small launch ra- 
dius, it seems likely that the X-ray absorber is either not 
radiatively accelerated, or not outflowing at the same high 
speed as the UV lines. 

In either case, the absence of high-ionization UV absorp- 
tion near the systemic velocity places another important 
constraint on wind models. If it is a steady- state flow, 
then the acceleration must occur in a region that does not 
intersect our sightline to the continuum source. Models of 
outflows that lead to such UV lines have been discussed by 
Murray et al. (1995), Murray &c Chiang (1995), and Elvis 
(2000). In these scenarios, the wind is initially perpen- 
dicular to the accretion disk. As it flows farther from the 
disk, the radiation pressure accelerating it bends and flares 
in the radial direction. Oblique lines of sight then could 
pass through the bent part of the wind, thus explaining 
the absence of zero- velocity absorption. 



J. lie moueis meniionea m tne previous paragrapii uii- 
fer in subtle ways. Murray et al. (1995) described a case 
in which the X-ray absorber is at rest. Its function is to 
shield the UV gas from soft X-rays and prevent it from be- 
coming highly ionized, in which case resonant line driving 
would not be eff'ective. Another variant of this scheme is 
the possibility of a self-shielding wind (Murray & Chiang 
1995; Elvis 2000). The X-ray and UV absorption arise in 
the same outflowing gas. The high column density of the 
wind requires a small launch radius, although probably 
larger than the radius we derive in section 4.3. 

5. CONCLUSIONS 

We presented Chandra X-ray observations of the radio- 
quiet QSO PG 2302-t-029 and demonstrated the presence 
of soft X-ray absorption in its spectrum. Older UV spec- 
tra of this quasar have been used to identify the presence 
of rarely observed ultra-high velocity (—56,000 km s~l) 
absorption lines consistent with this quasar containing a 
remarkable outflow from its active nucleus (Jannuzi et al. 
1996, Jannuzi et al. 2003). Using photoionization models 
and the combined X-ray and UV data sets we have investi- 
gated the possible physical properties of the gas producing 
the X-ray and UV absorption. We suggest that the X-ray 
absorption also occurs at high velocities in the same gen- 
eral region as the UV absorber. There are not enough con- 
straints to rule out multi-zone models. Multi-zone mod- 
els are required if the distinct broad and narrow UV line 
profiles are both intrinsic to the QSO. The properties of 
the X-ray and UV absorption, as inferred from the data, 
are consistent with each other, if the X-ray absorbing gas 
is outflowing with the UV absorber. However, the X-ray 
data over predict the strength of the high-ionization UV 
lines of Ne VIII at all velocities. If we assume the X-ray 
absorbing gas is in an outflow with the same velocity as 
the gas producing the UV-absorbing wind and that such 
winds are radiatively accelerated, then the outflow must 
be started at a radius of < 10^^ cm from the central source 
of the radiation.
