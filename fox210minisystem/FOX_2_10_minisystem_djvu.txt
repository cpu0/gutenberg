FOX 2/10 

shirt-sleeve 
minisystem ... 

you don’t 
have 
to know 
beans 
about 
computers 
to make it 
work for you. 




Now, without having to become a 
computer expert, you can enjoy 
the benefits of a process computer 
system . . . the “off-the-shelf” 
FOX 2/10 Minisystem. 

You can put it to work without 
having to learn all about compilers, 
editors, linkers, assemblers, 
loaders, and such unfamiliar 
numbering systems as 
hexadecimal, binary, and octal. 

The low-cost FOX 2/10 can be 
used for unit-level control and in 
pilot plants, labs, and other 
small-scale computing 
environments ... to handle data 
acquisition, data reduction, 
logging, reporting, monitoring and 
alarming, regulatory (DDC and set 
point) control, sequential control, 
and automatic testing.

FPL can make plant status information more 
understandable with the aid of graphics. 


FPL makes it ready-to-run 

The FOX 2/10 is ready to run when you get 
it — now — not after months of program¬ 
ming. All you have to do is connect the sig¬ 
nals from your field transmitters and specify 
process-related parameters, such as signal 
ranges, alarm limits, etc. 

What makes the FOX 2/10 Minisystem so 
easy to implement and operate? FPL, the 
Foxboro Process Language, does. This unique 
language provides five ready-to-run functions: 

• Scanning measurement inputs and con¬ 
version to engineering units 

• Automatic alarm message reporting 

• Scheduling tasks 

• Generating reports, logs, and summaries 

• Adding, deleting, or modifying all func¬ 
tions on-line 

FPL talks your language, just to make the 
FOX 2/10 easier to understand. For example, 
the term “tasks” is used to describe the jobs 
you want to get done, instead of “programs.” 

FPL has powerful and comprehensive capa¬ 
bilities, built into a highly flexible task- 
orented language for supervisory and control 
functions. 


The malleable minisystem 

Because your requirements change, the 
FOX 2/10 is designed to smoothly change 
with them. You don’t have to reinvent the 
wheel every time a temperature range is 
changed ... a flow meter is relocated ... a 
new measurement is used in the control 
strategies ... or product mixes get new in¬ 
gredients. 

You can even switch control strategies 
(DDC to SPC, etc.) — on line — through 
INTERSPEC, without wiring or equipment 
changes. (INTERSPEC takes the place of con¬ 
ventional computer input/output equipment. 
It is the versatile and powerful link between 
the FOX 2/10 System and the unique Foxboro 
SPEC 200 Analog Control System.) 

Nor do you have to stop the process or take 
the system off-line to do it. The FOX 2/10 
can be changed on line . . . without inter¬ 
ruptions. 

Memory usage is adjusted automatically 
when you add or delete process I/O equip¬ 
ment blocks or task statements. So, the sys¬ 
tem may grow to the* limits of available 
memory. 


3 











No growing pains 

What about your future needs? The FOX 
2/10 Minisystem can grow — without awk¬ 
ward or costly growing pains — as your 
needs grow. It can even evolve into a FOX 
2/30, the Foxboro medium-size process com¬ 
puter system. 

Modest requirements? Start with as little as 
8000 words of memory. Larger? Up to 28,000 
words. 

Does a lot 

The FOX 2/10 System handles big assign¬ 
ments in small industrial applications; little 
plants, pilot plants, laboratories, and units of 
large plants. 

Multple tasks run concurrently, and a vari¬ 
ety of changes can be made without interfer¬ 
ing with other system functions. Tasks can 
be added, deleted, modified, started, and 
stopped while the FOX 2/10 is still monitor¬ 
ing or controlling the process. For example, 
typical tasks — from tank filling to model- 
based control functions involving material and 
energy balance — can be added or modified 
on-line while the FOX 2/10 is still monitoring 
and controlling other important processes. 

Hardware and software modularity 

From an array of input/output equipment 
blocks, the FOX 2/10 can assume just the 
configuration you’re looking for. Analog inputs 
for process measurements; contact inputs for 
pushbuttons, switches (level, flow, etc.); con¬ 
tact outputs for lights, motor starters, sole¬ 
noid valves, outputs to analog control stations, 
and many others. All desired functions for 
one to 256 control loops are handled through 
INTERSPEC. 

Easy communications 

FOX 2/10 can easily communicate with the 
FOX 2/30 and FOX 1 computer systems and 
with large corporate computers in hierarchi¬ 
cal management information systems. A sin¬ 
gle INTERSPEC serial link provides any type 
of computer control and satisfies any analog 
backup requirements. 

Simple reporting 

Generating a report on the FOX 2/10 sys¬ 
tem is simple. All you have to do is type the 
format and enter it into the system. When 
you want the report, you type a RUN com¬ 
mand and get it. Or, schedule the report to 
run at a particular time of day. 

If you can type the format you want to see 
displayed in a report, you can enter it into 


the system, provided you have had a very 
small amount of training and know a few 
basic instructions. And there is nothing you 
can do to hurt the system. 

Suppose you wanted the following report 
to be generated periodically —

Off the shelf . . . and ready to run when you get it. 



FPL automatically logs alarm conditions as 
they occur and as they return to normal. 




The heart of the FOX 2/10 is its easy-to- 
learn Foxboro Process Language — FPL. Al¬ 
though powerful enough for a variety of 
process applications involving both computa¬ 
tion and control, FPL is highly efficient in 
memory usage. 

Through FPL, these functions are ready to 
go to work for you as soon as you plug in 
your FOX 2/10 system and specify some basic 
information: 

• Implementation — through on-line con¬ 
versational techniques. 

• Data Acquisition and Reduction — mon¬ 
itoring, alarming, and logging of process 
conditions. 

• Automatic Measurement Processing — 

scanning, linearizing, filtering, and con¬ 
version to engineering units of analog 
input data. 

• Man/Machine Communication — At any 

time, you can examine measurements 
and alarm limits, control set points, aver¬ 
aging and scan periods, block constants 
and interconnections. 

• Supervisory and Regulatory Control — 

Implementation of set-point control or 
DDC is quickly accomplished. Provided 
are Proportional, Integral, and Derivative 
(P.I.D.), Lead/Lag, and Deadtime Control 
Blocks. A Calculation Block provides 
ratio control, multiply/divide, or other 


equations. The Control and Calculation 
Blocks can be linked for a wide variety 
of control strategies — from simple loop 
control to multivariable control, feed¬ 
forward control, model-based control, 
and other advanced methods. 

Implementation is done using values 
expressed in engineering units. There is 
no need to deal with unfamiliar number¬ 
ing systems. 

There’s a lot to like about FPL With FPL you 
can: 

• Define new analog or digital inputs or 
outputs on-line from the system’s Tele¬ 
type terminal using process-related 
names. 

• Write and enter tasks on-line . . . tasks 
which reference analog and digital inputs 
and outputs by names you give them. 

• Write your own control algorithm with 
the calculation-block feature. 

• Format and print reports without format 
restrictions. 

• Select from a number of general purpose 
control blocks (algorithms). 

• Input and output data and messages via 
multiple Teletypewriters and CRT ter¬ 
minals. 

• Print from a Task to any CRT or Tele¬ 
typewriter on the system. 

• Read data from any Teletypewriter or 
CRT to a Task, on command from the 
Task.

Internal FPL features 

• High efficiency 

• Minimum use of computer memory 

• Automatic handling of all real-time 
services 

• Compact and efficient multiple-task 
scheduling 

Blanketed with security 

The entire system is checked continuously 
for errors. If they occur, you know about 
them fast. Input, output, and conversion 
errors are monitored at run time. Latest input 
values are not changed if an error is indi¬ 
cated. Alarm messages are generated for op¬ 
erator and system errors. A power fail/ 
restart feature lets the system ride out power 
failures. 

Extensive legality tests are made on FPL 
statements as they are entered. Statements in 
error are not accepted. When the following 
errors are detected, appropriate messages are 
generated: 

• Undefined symbol 

• Symbol defined more than once 

• Incorrect syntax 

• Illegal parameter or statement type 

• Value out of range 

• Invalid sequence of statements 

• Memory exceeded 

So you just can’t go wrong — FPL won’t let 
you. 

A high-performance compact 

Because the FOX 2/10 is designed to sup¬ 
port modest industrial applications at minimal 
cost, it operates in a compact environment.. . 
as small as 8000 words of memory. The resi¬ 
dency requirements of the entire FPL System 
are only 6500 words. How’s that for compact¬ 
ness? The remaining portions of memory are 


available for storing your tasks and your de¬ 
fined procedures. 

Task development is easy 
You can develop tasks and debug them 
while other tasks are operating. You can add 
or delete entire input and output procedures, 
logs, or tasks; type out statements and speci¬ 
fications already entered; enter previously 
written tasks. With this level of versatility 
you can continue to create new monitoring, 
reporting, and control schemes. 

Direct task entry 

All Task entry is done directly. 

If you want to enter a task, you type on the 
system Teletypewriter: 



The new task is accepted on a statement- 
by-statement basis, while FPL is concurrently 
performing Automatic Measurement Process¬ 
ing and executing previously entered back¬ 
ground tasks. As you enter a statement, the 
system analyzes it for errors, indicates any 
you may have made, gives you an opportunity 
to correct them, and then accepts the state¬ 
ment and lets you enter the next one. And 
you can always go back and make changes. 

Implementation of automatic measurement 
processing is essentially done the same way. 
For example, you type a statement that 
means, “I want to define a measurement (ana¬ 
log) input named LEVEL.” It should look like 
this . ..

If you type it correctly, the FOX 2/10 ac¬ 
cepts it and it’s done. Everything happens 
automatically. You save most of the time nor¬ 
mally spent in computer programming. And 
you eliminate a lot of opportunity for errors 
and for interference with the system. (Of 
course, you can always punch a paper tape of 
your tasks and input/output procedures for 
later use.) 

Analog inputs processed automatically 

All you have to do is tell the FOX 2/10 sys¬ 
tem what the relevant parameters are. The 
system does the rest: 

• Operates the analog input module auto¬ 
matically, scanning all active points and 
bringing raw data into memory 

• Converts raw data to engineering units 

• Performs: 

• Signal conditioning (e.g., square root, 
thermocouple linearization, digital fil¬ 
tering) 

• Reasonableness checks 

• Limit checking 

• Alarm messages 

To put a measurement point on automatic 
scan, you type the definition of an analog in¬ 
put and a name, and specify other process- 
related information. 

Without automatic measurement process¬ 
ing, you’d have to worry about the way you 
schedule the scanning of all the points, and 
the way you provide for changing such 
parameters as alarm limits, scan periods, en¬ 


gineering units conversion, etc. Doing these 
kinds of things yourself is tedious, time-con¬ 
suming, and expensive . . . typically, requiring 
man-months of programming. But we’ve done 
it for you. And you can implement the scan¬ 
ning of new analog points, change the scan 
frequency, change limits — all on-line while 
other points you have already implemented 
are running. 

When you have defined an analog input and 
want scanning and alarming to begin, you 
type: 


_ _ Name of desired input 

O RUWsLEVEL; 

o 


An input or output (I/O) point can be put 
on automatic scan from the Teletypewriter in 
this manner or under Task control; for ex¬ 
ample, as an action resulting from a process 
event, or an elapsed time interval. 

You can implement a task this easily 

The illustration below shows a simple 
process. The operation called “WARMUP” 
involves filling the tank to a level of 80 
inches, heating the contents to 165 degrees 
Fahrenheit, holding it at that temperature for 
30 minutes, and then pumping it out (to an¬ 
other vessel). 

In this example we will employ Set-Point 
Control (SPC) on the steam heater. Although 
Direct Digital Control (DDC) could just as 
easily be used. 



11 




































Assuming we had defined the other associated 
analog inputs and outputs and digital outputs 
in a similar manner as we did “Level,” the 
Task statements you could enter to accom¬ 
plish the warmup operation are: 


Once the input and output procedures and 
the Task “WARMUP” have been accepted by 
FPL, you merely instruct FPL to “RUN” them 
and things begin to happen. That’s all there 
is to it! Isn’t it easy?

FOX 2/10 HARDWARE 


Modular approach eases custom 
configuring, expanding, and servicing 

The FOX 2/10, like its larger colleague, the 
FOX 2/30, brings you hardware ruggedness, 
compactness, modularity, reliability, and econ¬ 
omy. From its integrated circuits to its field 
interface racks, the FOX 2/10 is the kind of 
computer system that helps give plant man¬ 
agers, operators, and engineers peaceful days 
. . . and nights. 

Systems are composed of basic building 
blocks — completely independent I/O sub¬ 
systems. Additional units can be mounted 
easily and connected to the system in the 
field. It replacement is required, spares can be 
inserted and operation resumed in a few 
minutes. 

We locate the electronic modules in racks 
for easy access and minimal space require¬ 
ments to reduce your ultimate rack-space cost. 

CRT and Teletypewriter terminals help you 
communicate effectively with the system 

You can get a total, up-to-date look at any¬ 
thing from a single measurement point to a 
plant unit . . . anytime you want to . . . with 
no more than the push of a couple of buttons 
on a CRT or Teletypewriter terminal. They 
can be used for practically all supervisory and 
control functions. They are powerful tools 
you can call upon for instantly current data, 
displayed the way you want it displayed. 

They help you — The system Teletypewriter 
terminal provides a fast and simple means of 
entering tasks, implementing new approaches 
to control, or modifying existing schemes 
through conversational techniques . . . tech¬ 
niques that eliminate the need for extensive 
and time-consuming card or tape manipula¬ 
tion. 

They help operators — From additional CRT 
or Teletypewriter terminals, operators can re¬ 
ceive process data or selected groups of pro¬ 
cess variables, or enter set points or other 
process variables.

They help engineers — The engineer has the 
opportunity to exercise more effective process 
supervision. From the system terminal, he can 
quickly obtain a comprehensive view of plant 
conditions and control status. He can request 
summarized data, observe trends, or get in 
close on any particular variable. 

He can open and close cascades; modify 
other block interconnections; and place points 
on or off scan. Also, he can change all types 
of operating parameters; set points, data, and 
output values; alarm limits; and control con¬ 
straints. 


Control loop tuning is safe and easy, too. 
The process engineer can quickly display, 
modify, verify, and enter new data such as 
measurement limits, deadbands, signal-filter¬ 
ing parameters, and set points. 

The FOX 2/10 system can handle a com¬ 
bination of up to 12 CRT terminals or Tele¬ 
typewriters. Also, there is an auxiliary push¬ 
button panel for those applications where 
ON/OFF commands are required. This panel 
has 16 backlighted pushbuttons. They may be 
used to start tasks, initiate the printing of 
logs and reports, and perform any of a num¬ 
ber of functions you define. Multiple panels 
may be used. 


16 














INTERSPEC and SPEC 200 




An optional display CRT provides display- 
only of such process information as alarms 
and logs on a CRT monitor. This is useful 
where information is dynamic or must be 
viewed from a distance. 

Two Teletypewriters are offered: Models 
33 and 35. Paper tape I/O is also available. 
A high-speed paper tape reader may be used 
in an off-line mode. 


The FOX 2/10 Central Processor is a high¬ 
speed state-of-the-art computer with: 

• 16-bit word structure 

• 750-nanosecond operation increments 

• 950-nanosecond memory cycle time 

• Up to 28,672 addressable memory loca¬ 
tions 

• Many other features which make it 
ideally suitable for industrial applica¬ 
tions. 

Other FOX 2/10 features include: 

Real-time Clock — FOX 2/10 provides a 
line frequency clock — so necessary in tim¬ 
ing and logging operations in any real-time 
operation. It generates an interrupt every 
16.67 milliseconds (60 Hz). 


17 




























TYPE:TEMP: 63 .7 



The system terminal will respond with the 
value of any variable when you type “TYPE” 
followed by the variable’s name. 


Power-Fail Restart — This standard fea¬ 
ture prevents power dips or outages from 
damaging the ability of the FOX 2/10 Sys¬ 
tem to accomplish its task. Upon return of 
power, the FOX 2/10 waits for an operator 
or a task to indicate whether or not to 
proceed with control. 

Large complement of process interface 
equipment — FOX 2/10 has a large com¬ 
plement of compact and reliable process 
interface building blocks: 


INTERSPEC Communications Module — 
Plugs into the FOX 2/10 like any other 
peripheral device and accepts, converts, di¬ 
rects, and transmits the myriad of signals 
that flow between an INTERSPEC/SPEC 
200 System and the FOX 2/10, allowing the 
FOX 2/10 to perform process monitoring, 
supervisory set-point control or direct dig¬ 
ital control of even the most complex pro¬ 
cess loops. When INTERSPEC/SPEC 200 
is used, certain modules described below 
are not needed, since their function is in¬ 
corporated in INTERSPEC. The positional 
algorithm is available with INTERSPEC. 


Distances of up to 5,000 feet beween the 
FOX 2/10 System and INTERSPEC/SPEC 
200 are allowed, and require only three 
pairs of wire. 

Analog Input Module — The eyes and ears 
of any data acquisition application, this 
option is constructed modularly to reduce 
initial investment and facilitate future ex¬ 
pansion. It provides the capability to mon¬ 
itor temperatures, flows, levels, pressures, 
or any of a myriad of process conditions. 

Digital Input Module — This option mini¬ 
mizes your field cabling costs by allowing 
the field termination panel to be remotely 
located in the plant area. It provides the 
capability for the FOX 2/10 System to de¬ 
termine the status of limit switches, flow 
switches, pushbuttons, and other on/off 
conditions. 

Digital Output Module — This option lets 
you open and close valves, light alarm 
lights, start and stop motors, and operate 
any required contacts. And it reduces ca¬ 
bling costs by permitting the mounting of 
field termination panels, including relays, 
remotely in the plant area. 


18 



Separate termination racks can be used to 
speed up system installation. 




§ 


Valve Control Module — Since direct dig¬ 
ital control is common, we have a module 
that provides outputs to valves via DDC or 
Auto/Manual stations for closed loop con¬ 
trol. Self-checking, it tells you when abnor¬ 
malities occur. 

Set-Point Control Module — Used where 
analog control of the basic loops is desired, 
but where computer supervision of the set 
points is wanted to coordinate multiple 
control loops and to optimize set points. 

Field Terminations — There are many op¬ 
tions for interfacing the I/O gear to the 
process. They are connected to it via a 
variety of termination facilities, including 
local, remote, multiplexed, cabled, and di¬ 
rect-wired. The right facility at the right 
price for the job.

Laboratories 

FOX 2/10 is ideally suited for laboratory automation. 
It can interface with analog and digital interfaces asso¬ 
ciated with laboratory instruments. The FPL language 
is suitable for performing many analytical calculations; 
and the formatting capability provides an excellent 
framework for laboratory reports. 

The interactive language and operator interface al¬ 
lows easy preparation and modification of experiments 
on line. Multi-tasking makes FOX 2/10 capable of con¬ 
trolling and analyzing the results of several experiments 
at once. 

Hydrocarbon Processing 

Unit operations such as distillation, gasoline-blending, 
and furnace control can be easily accomplished on the 
FOX 2/10 System. FPL offers the capability to easily 
structure feedforward control strategies to provide op¬ 
timum control in these areas. Examples: constraint rid¬ 
ing of an ethylene furnace or material and energy 
balance calculations on a distillation column. 

Some of the many reports that can be generated by the 
system are: periodic yield and conversion, utilities con¬ 
sumption, and process-unit constraint identification. 

Chemical 

With the FOX 2/10 System, material and energy bal¬ 
ance calculations can easily be incorporated into the 
control scheme of a process unit. So can event-oriented 
and time-dependent sequence logic ... of particular 
benefit in optimizing the performance of an array of 
batch reactors. Dual mode control of an exothermic 
batch reactor, for instance, is duck soup for the FOX 
2/10 System. Heat transfer rate and the heat of reaction 
can be dynamically calculated, based on the rate of rise 
of the vessel temperature and the temperature differ¬ 
ence between the vessel and the jacket. By adjusting 
the termination of heating, the full cooling period, and 
the steady-state cooling rate, the batch cycle time can 
be minimized without causing overshoot. No operator 
adjustment is needed even when the recipe is changed. 
A batch cycle report can be prepared either periodically 
or at the end of each batch. It could even include the 
reactor’s heat transfer coefficient, forecasting a cleaning 
schedule. 

Food 

In the food industry, the FOX 2/10 System can be used 
for both pilot-plant operations and in-plant production. 
It can control process variables and provide the moni¬ 
toring, alarming, and logging functions often required. 
Because the FOX 2/10 System can easily handle se¬ 
quential procedures, it is ideal for both batch and con¬ 
tinuous processes. Control of evaporators, dryers, and 
associated processes can be implemented. Computation 
algorithms for applying feedforward control are part of 
the basic system, which can be used with DDC or with 
conventional analog controllers. 










The small size and low price of the FOX 2/10 System 
make it economically attractive for application on con¬ 
tinuous digesters, bleach plants, batch digester systems, 
and recovery systems. Using standard field-proven 
Foxboro application control packages, FPL, and function¬ 
ally modular FOX 2/10 hardware and software, future 
unit process changes are easily accommodated. The FOX 
2/10 System can communicate with the larger FOX 2/30 
and FOX 1 Systems for sophisticated inter-unit process 
optimization. 

Paper 

The FOX 2/10 System gives the papermaker complete 
control of basis weight, moisture, headbox, grade 
changes, and machines with dryer, stock valve, or 
speed-limiting conditions. 

Unlike many packaged paper-machine control systems, 
which only work with their own basis weight and mois¬ 
ture sensors, the FOX 2/10 System will work with any 
reliable primary sensor. For the mill that already has 
basis weight and moisture gauges, this represents a 
substantial increase in return-on-investment. 

Cement 

The FOX 2/10 System can easily be used for various 
control applications in a cement plant. A major area is 
the raw material mix. Interfaced to an X-ray analyzer, 
the system can optimize the raw material mix, providing 
early payout.

Steel 

The FOX 2/10 System is ideally suited to the needs of 
plant combustion engineers and operating personnel. 
Anyone who understands analog systems can easily 
learn and use FPL. The benefits of computer control and 
monitoring of sintering plants, furnaces, continuous 
casters and associated steel processes can now be a 
reality. 

Mineral Processing 

The FOX 2/10 can easily handle control of rod and ball 
mills. Not only can overall control strategy be imple¬ 
mented and easily modified, but accurate total and 
average rates of production and efficiency can be 
calculated. 

Supervisory or DDC control, logging, sequencing and 
alarming functions for flotation units, dryers, smelters, 
and associated processes are all easy to implement with 
the FOX 2/10 System. 

Textiles 

The FOX 2/10 is a practical, low-cost tool for fast im¬ 
plementation of small textile-plant projects requiring a 
high degree of flexibility and easy implementation by 
process engineers and technicians. It is ideal for textile 
pilot-plant operations and control of continuous ranges 
where control enforcement, alarming, regulatory con¬ 
trol, and ramping of process variables in a specific time 
are important. 

Power 

The FOX 2/10 System may be applied to monitoring 
and control applications in the power industry where a 
low-cost, fast installation is a prime objective for achiev¬ 
ing specific results. The system can be used for scanning 
and alarm monitoring of process variables and contact 
inputs. Highly reliable, the system can fill the real needs 
of limited-scope power applications.

There must be a better way than a do-it-yourself 
minicomputer! 

There is a better way: 



! 



WE-DO-IT-FOR-YOU 

FOX 2/10 SHIRT-SLEEVE MINISYSTEMS 


Foxboro minisystems vs minicomputers 
Why go with a barebones, do-it-yourself 
minicomputer when there are FOX 2/10 
minisystems around? A minicomputer might 
look attractive to begin with, but consider 
these points: 

Overall cost — Consider the work you want 
to do later as well as now. You’ll pay a lot 
more to expand a minicomputer than a FOX 
2/10 minisystem. It starts with enough 
designed-in flexibility and capability to be 
expanded easily and economically. 

Software development — Comprehensive 
software is complex, and expensive to 
develop. With a minicomputer, you can’t 
afford to develop a package that supports 


applications today and allows the flexibility 
to expand to satisfy changing requirements. 
Foxboro supplies the kind of software you 
need — debugged and proven. 

We talk your language — Foxboro provides a 
fully documented and operating system for 
process-oriented people like you to use. 

The one constant: change — Your plant is 
constantly undergoing changes, right? A 
temperature range is changed . . . flow meters 
are resized . . . product mixes get new 
ingredients. Does this mean you have to 
rewrite your program every time one of these 
changes occurs? Do you have to take your 
computer off line to make a change? With a 
minicomputer you probably have to. With a 
FOX 2/10 Minisystem you don’t, thanks to 
our on-line programming capability.
