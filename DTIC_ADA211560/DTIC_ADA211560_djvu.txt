INTRODUCTION 


This Validation Summary Report ‘■(VSR) describes the extent to which a 
specific Ada compiler conforms to the Ada Standard, ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A. 
This report explains all technical terms used within it and thoroughly 
reports the results of .testing this compiler using the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability; (ACVC)."' An Ada compiler must be implemented 
according to the Ada Standard, and any implementation-dependent features 
must conform to the requirements of the Ada Standard. The Ada Standard 
must be implemented in its entirety, and nothing can be implemented that is 
not in the Standard. 

Even though all validated Ada compilers conform to the Ada Standard, it 
must be understood that some differences do exist between implementations. 
The Ada Standard permits some implementation dependencies—for example, the 
maximum length of identifiers or the maximum values of integer types. 
Other differences between compilers result from the characteristics of 
particular operating systems, hardware, or implementation strategies. All 
the dependencies observed during the process of testing this compiler are 
given in this report. 

The information in this report is derived from the test results produced 
during validation testing. The validation process includes submitting a 
suite of standardized tests, the ACVC, as inputs to an Ada compiler and 
evaluating the results. The purpose of validating is to ensure conformity 
of the compiler to the Ada Standard by testing that the compiler properly 
implements legal language constructs and that it identifies and rejects 
illegal language constructs. The testing also identifies behavior that is 
implementation-dependent but is permitted by the Ada Standard. Six classes 
of tests are used. These tests are designed to perform checks at compile 
time, at link time, and during execution. 





INTRODUCTION 


1.1 PURPOSE OF THIS VALIDATION SUMMARY REPORT 


This VSR documents the results of the validation testing performed on an 
Ada compiler. Testing was carried out for the following purposes: 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs supported by tne 
compiler that do not conform to the Ada Standard 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs not supported by 
the compiler but required by the Ada Standard 

. To determine that the implementation-dependent behavior is allowed 
by the Ada Standard 

Testing of this compiler was conducted by SofTech, Inc. under the 
direction of the AVF according to procedures established by the Ada Joint 
Program Office and administered by the Ada Validation Organization (AVO). 
On-site testing was completed 10 July 1989 at San Diego CA.

An ACVC test for which the compiler generates a result that 
demonstrates nonconformity to tne Ada Standard. 

The computer on which the compiler resides. 

An ACVC test that uses features of the language that a 
compiler is not required to support or may legitimately 
support in a way other than the one expectec by the test. 

An ACVC test for which a compiler generates the expected 
result. 

The computer for which a compiler generates code. 

A program that checks a compiler's conformity regarding a 
particular feature or a combination of features to the Ada 
Standard. In the context of this report, the term is used to 
designate a single test, which may comprise one or more 
files. 

An ACVC test found to be incorrect and not used to check 
conformity to the Ada Standard. A test may be incorrect 
because it has an invalid test objective, fails to meet its 
test objective, or contains illegal or erroneous use of the 
language. 


1.5 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conformity to the Ada Standard is measured using the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains both legal and illegal Ada programs structured into six test 
classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies 
the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable, 
and special program units are used to report their results during 
execution. Class B tests are expected to produce compilation errors. 
Class L tests are expected to produce compilation or link errors because of 
the way in which a program library is used at link time. 

Class A tests ensure the successful compilation of legal Ada programs with 
certain language constructs which cannot be verified at compile time. 
There are no explicit program components in a Class A test to check 
semantics. For example, a Class A test checks that reserved words of 
another language (other than those already reserved in the Ada language) 
are not treated as reserved words by an Ada compiler. A Class A test is 
passed if no errors are detected at compile time and the program executes 
to produce a PASSED message. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that every syntax or 
semantic error in the test is detected. A Class B test is passed if every

INTRODUCTION 


illegal construct that it contains is detected by the compiler. 

Class C tests check the run time system to ensure that legal Ada programs 
can be correctly compiled and executed. Each Class C test is self-checking 
and produces a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result when it is executed. 

Class D tests check the compilation and execution capacities of a compiler. 
Since there are no capacity requirements placed on a compiler by the Ada 
Standard for some parameters—for example, the number of identifiers 
permitted in a compilation or the number of units in a library—a compiler 
may refuse to compile a Class D test and still be a conforming compiler. 
Therefore, if a Class D test fails to compile because the capacity of the 
compiler is exceeded, the test is classified as inapplicable. If a Class D 
test compiles successfully, it is self-checking and produces a PASSED or 
FAILED message during execution. 

Class E tests are expected to execute successfully and check 
implementation-dependent options and resolutions of ambiguities in the Ada 
Standard. Each Class E test is self-checking and produces a NOT 
APPLICABLE, PASSED, or FAILED message when it is compiled and executed. 
However, the Ada Standard permits an implementation to reject programs 
containing some features addressed by Class E tests during compilation. 
Therefore, a Class £ test is passed by a compiler if it is compiled 
successfully and executes to produce a PASSED message, or if it is rejected 
by the compiler for an allowable reason. 

Class L tests check that incomplete or illegal Ada programs involving 
multiple, separately compiled units are detected and not allowed to 
execute. Class L tests are compiled separately and execution is attempted. 
A Class L test passes if it is rejected at link time—that is, an attempt 
to execute the main program must generate an error message before any 
declarations in the main program or any units referenced by the main 
program are elaborated. In some cases, an implementation may legitimately 
detect errors during compilation of the test. 

Two library units, the package REPORT and the procedure CHECK_FILE, support 
the self-checking features of the executable tests. The package REPORT 
provides the mechanism by which executable tests report PASSED, FAILED, or 
NOT APPLICABLE results. It also provides a set of identity functions used 
to defeat some compiler optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that 
would circumvent a test objective. The procedure CHECK FILE is used to 
check the contents of text files written by some of the Class C tests for 
chapter 14 of the Ada Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. These tests produce messages that 
are examined to verify that the units are operating correctly. If these 
units are not operating correctly, then the validation is not attempted. 

The text of each test in the ACVC follows conventions that are intended to 
ensure that the tests are reasonably portable without modification. For 
example, the tests make use of only the basic set of 55 characters, contain 
lines with a maximum length of 72 characters, use small numeric values, and 
place features that may not be supported by all implementations in separate

INTRODUCTION 


tests. However, some tests contain values that require the test to be 
customized according to implementation-specific values—for example, an 
illegal file name. A list of the values used for this validation is 
provided in Appendix C. 

A compiler must correctly process each of the tests in the suite and 
demonstrate conformity to the Ada Standard by either meeting the pass 
criteria given for the test or by shoving that the test is inapplicable to 
the implementation. The applicability of a test to an implementation is 
considered each time the implementation is validated. A test that is 
inapplicable for one validation is not necessarily inapplicable for a 
subsequent validation. Any test that was determined to contain an illegal 
language construct or an erroneous language construct is withdrawn from the 
ACVC and, therefore, is not used in testing a compiler. The tests 
withdrawn at the time of this validation are given in Appendix D.

2-1 





CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


2.2 IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS 

One of the purposes of validating compilers is to determine the behavior of 
a compiler in those areas of the Ada Standard that permit implementations 
to differ. Class D and E tests specifically check, for such implementation 
differences. However, tests in other classes also characterize an 
implementation. The tests demonstrate the following characteristics: 


a. Capacities. 


(1) The compiler correctly processes a compilation containing 723 
variables in the same declarative part. (See test D29002K.) 

(2) The compiler correctly processes tests containing loop 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See tests D55A03A..H (8 
tests).) 

(3) The compiler correctly processes tests containing block 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See test D56001B.) 

(4) The compiler correctly processes tests containing recursive 
procedures separately compiled as subunits nested to 17 
levels. (See tests D64005E..G (3 tests).) 


b. Predefined types. 

(1) This implementation supports the additional predefined types 
LONG_INTEGER and LONG_FLOAT in package STANDARD. (See tests 
B86001T..Z (7 tests).) 


c. Expression evaluation. 

The order in which expressions are evaluated and the time at which 
constraints are checked ar.e not defined by the language. While 
the ACVC tests do not specifically attempt to determine the order 
of evaluation of expressions, test results indicate the following: 

(1) Some of the default initialization expressions for record 
components are evaluated before any value is checked for 
membership in a component's subtype. (See test C32117A.) 

(2) Assignments for subtypes are performed with the same precision 
as the base type. (See test C35712B.) 

(3) This implementation uses no extra bits for extra precision and 
uses no extra bits for extra range. (See test C35903A.) 


2-2 










CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(4) Sometimes NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when an integer literal 
operand in a comparison or membership test is outside the 
range of the base type. (See test C45232A.) 

(5) NUMERIC ERROR is raised vhen a literal operand in a 
fixed-point comparison or membership test is outside the range 
of the base type. (See test C45252A.) 

(6) Unoerflov is not gradual. (See tests C45524A..Z.) 


d. Rounding. 

The method by which values are rounded in type conversions is not 
defined by the language. Vhile the ACVC tests do not specifically 
attempt to determine the method of rounding, the test results 
indicate the following: 

(1) The method used for rounding to integer is round away from 
zero. (See tests C46012A..Z.) 

(2) The method used for rounding to longest integer is round away 
from zero. (See tests C46012A..Z.) 

(3) The method used for rounding to integer in static universal 
real expressions is round away from zero. (See test C4A014A.) 


e. Array types. 

An implementation is allowed to raise NUMERIC_ERROR or 
CONSTRAINT_ERROR for an array having a 'LENGTH that exceeds 
STANDARD.INTEGER'LAST and/or SYSTEM.MAX_INT. 

For this implementation: 

(1) Declaration of an array type or subtype declaration with more 
than SYSTEM.MAXINT comDonents raises no exception. (See test 
C36003A.) 


(2) 

NUMERIC_ERROR is 

raised when 

'LENGTH is applied 

to a 

null 


array type with 
C36202A ) 

INTEGER'LAST 

+ 2 components. 

(See 

test 

(3) 

NUMERIC RROR is 

raised when 

'LENGTH is applied 

to a 

null 


array tyne with 
C36202B.) 

SYSTEM.MAX_INT 

+ 2 components. 

(See 

test 


(4) A parked BOOLEAN array having a 'LENGTH exceeding INTEGER'LAST 
raises NUMERIC_ERROR when the array objects are sliced. (See 
test C52103X.) 


2-3 








CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(5) A packed tvo-dimensional BOOLEAN array vith more than 

INTEGER'LAST components raises CONSTRAINT_ERROR when the 

length of a dimension is calculated and exceeds INTEGER'LAST. 
(See test C52104Y.) 

(6) A null array with one dimension of length greater than 

INTEGER'LAST may raise NUMERIC_ERROR or C0K3TRAINT_ERR0R 

either when declared or assigned. Alternatively, an 

implementation may accept the declaration. However, lengths 
must match in array slice assignments. This implementation 
raises no exception. (See test E52103Y.) 

(7) In assigning one-dimensional array types, the expression is 
evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

(8) In assigning two-dimensional array types, the expression is 
not evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is 
raised when checking whether the expression's subtype is 
compatible with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


f. Discriminated types. 

(1) In assigning record types with discriminants, the expression 
is evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


g. Aggregates. 

(1) In the evaluation of a multi-dimensional aggregate, index 

subtype checks are made as choices are evaluated. (See tests 

C43207A and C43207B.) 

(2) In the evaluation of an aggregate containing subaggregates, 

not all choices are evaluated before being checked for 
identical bounds. (See test E43212B.) 

(3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised after all choices are evaluated 
when a bound in a non-null range of a non-null aggregate does 
not belong to an index subtype. (See test E43211B.) 

h. Pragmas. 

(1) The pragma INLINE is supported for procedures. (See tests 

LA3004A..B, EA3004C..D, and CA3004E..F.) 


2-4 









CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


i. Generics 

(1) Generic unit declarations, bodies and subunits can be compiled 
in separate compilations. (See tests CA1012A and CA3011A .) 

(2) If a generic unit body or one of its subunits is compiled or 
recompiled after the generic unit is instantiated, the unit 
instantiating the generic is made obsolete. The obsolescence 
is recognized at binding time, and the binding is stopped. 
(See tests CA2009C, CA2009F, BC3204C, and BC3205D.) 


j. Input and output 

(1) The package SEQUENTIAL_IO cannot be instantiated with 
unconstrained array types or record types with discriminants 
without defaults. (See tests AE2101C, EE2201D, and EE2201E.) 

(2) The package DIRECT_IO cannot be instantiated with 
unconstrained array types or record types with discriminants 
without defaults. (See tests AE2101H, EE2401D, and EE2401G.) 

(3) Sequential, Direct, and Text files are not supported by this 
implementation.

CHAPTER 3 


TEST INFORMATION 


3.1 TEST RESULTS 

Version 1.10 of the ACVC comprises 3717 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, 44 tests had been withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF 
determined that 617 tests were inapplicable to this implementation. All 
inapplicable tests were processed during validation testing except for 285 
executable tests that use floating-point precision exceeding that supported 
by the implementation and 238 executable tests that use file operations not 
supported by the implementation . Modifications to the code, processing, 
or grading for 8 tests were required to successfully demonstrate the test 
objective. (See section 3.6.) 

The AVF concludes that the testing results demonstrate acceptable 
conformity to the Ada Standard.

3.5 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

Some tests do not apply to all compilers because they make use of features 
that a compiler is not required by the Ada Standard to support. Others may 
depend on the result of another test that is either inapplicable or 
withdrawn. The applicability of a test to an implementation is considered 
each time a validation is attempted. A test that is inapplicable for one 
validation attempt is not necessarily inapplicable for a subsequent 
attempt. For this validation attempt, 617 tests were inapplicable for the 
reasons indicated: 


a. The following 285 tests are not applicable because they have 
floating-point type declarations requiring more digits than 
SYSTEM.MAX DIGITS: 


C24113F..Y 
C35708F..Y 
C45421F..Y 


C35705F..Y 
C35802F..Z 
C45521F..Z

TEST INFORMATION 


C45641F..Y C46012F..Z 

b. C35508I, C35508J, C35508M, and C35508N are not applicable because 

they include enumeration representation clauses for BOOLEAN types 
in which the representation values are other than (FALSE => 0, 
TRUE => 1). Under the terms of AI-00325, this implementation is 

not required to support such representation clauses. 

c. C35702A and B86001T are not applicable because this implementation 
supports no predefined type SH0RT_FL0AT. 

d. The following 16 tests are not applicable because this 
implementation does not support a predefined type SH0RT_INTEGER: 

C45231B C45304B C45502B C45503B C45504B 

C45504E C45611B C45613B C45614B C45631B

CD7101E 

e. C45231D, B86001X, and CD7101G are not applicable because this 

implementation does not support any predefined integer type with a 
name other than INTEGER, L0NG_INTEGER, or SH0RT_INTEGER. 

f. C45531M..P (4 tests) and C45532M..P (4 tests) are not applicable 

because the value of SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA is less than 47. 

g. C86001F is not applicable because, for this implementation, the 
package TEXTIO is dependent upon package SYSTEM. These tests 
recompile package SYSTEM, making package TEXT_I0, and hence 
package REPORT, obsolete. 

h. B86001Y is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined fixed-point type other than DURATION. 

i. B86001Z is not applicable because this implementation supports no 
predefined floating-point type with a name other than FLOAT, 
L0NG_FL0AT, or SHORT_FLOAT. 

j. CA2009C, CA2009F, BC3204C, and BC3205D are not applicable because 

this implementation does not support separate compilation of 
generic specifications, bodies, and subunits, if an instantiation 
is given before compilation of its bodies or subunits. The 
created dependency is detected at bind time. 

k. LA3004B, EA3004D, and CA3004F are not applicable because this 

implementation does not support pragma INLINE for functions. 

l. CD1009C, CD2A41A..B (2 tests), CD2A41E, and CD2A42A..J (10 tests) 
are not applicable because this implementation does not support 
size clauses of less than 32 bits for floating point types. 

m. CD2A61I and CD2A61J are not applicable because this implementation 
does not support size clauses for array types, which imply

types. This implementation requires an explicit size clause on 
the component type. 

n. CD2A71A..D (4 tests), CD2A72A..D (4 tests), CD2A74A..D (4 tests), 
and CD2A75A..D (4 tests) are not applicable because this 
implementation requires that a size specification for a record 
type be a multiple t 16 bits. 

o. CD2A6 hB..I (8 tests) and CD2A84K..L (2 tests) are not applicable 
because this implementation does not support size clauses of less 
than 16 bits for access types. 


p. AE2101C, EE2201D, and EE2201E use instantiations of package 

SEQUENTIALIO vith unconstrained array types and record types vith 
discriminants vithout defaults. These instantiations are rejected 
by this compiler. 

q. CE2103A, CE2103B, and CE3107A are not applicable because this 

implementation does not support external file CREATE and OPEN 
operation. These tests raise the exception USE_ERROR.

3.6 TEST, PROCESSING, AND EVALUATION MODIFICATIONS 

It is expected that some tests will require modifications of code, 
processing, or evaluation in order to compensate for legitimate 
implementation behavior. Modifications are made by the AVF ir. cases where 
legitimate implementation behavior prevents the successful completion of an 
(otherwise) applicable test. Examples of such modifications include: 
adding a length clause to alter the default size of a collection; splitting 
a Class B test into subtests so that all errors are detected; and 
confirming that messages produced by an executable test demonstrate 
conforming behavior that wasn't anticipated by the test (such as raising 
one exception instead of another). 

Modifications were required for 8 tests. 


The following tests were split because syntax errors at one point resulted 
in the compiler not detecting other errors in the test: 

BA3006A BA3006B BA3007B BA3008A BA3008B BA3013A 


C34005G and C34006D required evaluation modifications because the tests 
include some comparisons that use the 'SIZE attribute under assumptions 
that are not fully supported by the Ada Standard and are subject to ARG 
review. Thus, the AVO ruled that an implementation is considered to have 
passed these tests if the only REPORT.FAILED output is because of various 
'SIZE checks. This implementation produced the messages "INCORRECT 
TYPE'SIZE", "INCORRECT OBJECT'SIZE, and "INCORRECT'BASE'SIZE" for C34005G 
and the message "INCORRECT TYPE'SIZE" for C34006D. 


3.7 ADDITIONAL TESTING INFORMATION 


3.7.1 Prevalidation 

Prior to validation, a set of test results for ACVC Version 1.10 produced 
by the TeleGen2 VAX/1750a Cross Compilation System was submitted to the AVF 
by the applicant for review. Analysis of these results demonstrated that 
the compiler successfully passed all applicable tests, and the compiler 
exhibited the expected behavior on all inapplicable tests.

'EST INFORMATION 


3.7.2 Test Method 


Testing of the TeIeGen2 VAX/I750a Cross Compilation System using ACVC 
Version 1.10 vas conducted on-site by a validation team from the AVF. The 
configuration in which the testing vas performed is described by the 
following designations of hardware and software components: 


Host computer: 

Host operating system: 
Target computer: 

Target operating system: 
Compiler: 


MicroVAX II 
VAX/VMS, Version V5.1 
MIL-STD-1750a ECSPO ITS Simulator, 
Version 4.0, executing on the host 
Bare machine 

TeleGen2 VAX/1750a Cross Compilation 
Version 3.23 


A magnetic tape containing all tests except for withdrawn tests and tests 
requiring unsupported floating-point precisions was taken on-site by the 
validation team for processing. Tests that make use of 
implementation-specific values were customized before being written to the 
magnetic tape. Tests requiring modifications during the prevalidation 
testing were included in their modified form on the magnetic tape. 

The contents of the magnetic tape were loaded directly onto the host 
computer. 

After the test files were loaded to disk, the full set of tests was 
compiled and linked on a MicroVAX II, then all executable images were run 
on a MicroVAX II using MIL-STD-1750a ECSPO ITS Simulator, Version 4.0. 
Results were printed from the from the host computer. 

The compiler was tested using command scripts provided by TeleSoft and 
reviewed by the validation team. The compiler was tested using all default 
option settings except for the following:

TEST INFORMATION 


Tests were compiled, linked, and executed (as appropriate) using 2 or more 
computers. Test output, compilation listings, and job logs were captured 
on magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site by 
the validation team were also archived.

end STANDARD; 


B-l 




APPENDIX F 


1. Implementation Dependent Pragmas 

pragma COMMENT(<string Jiteral >): 

It may only appear within a compilation unit. 

The pragma comment has the effect of embedding the given 
sequence of characters in the object code of the compilation unit. 

pragma LINKN AME(<subprogram_name>, <string literal>); 

It may appear in any declaration section of a unit. 

This pragma must also appear directly after an interface pragma 
for the same <subprogram_name>. The pragma linkname has the 
effect of making string_literal apparent to the linker. 

pragma I.\'TERRl'PT(Function_.Mapping); 

It may only appear immediately before a simple accept statement, 
a while loop directly enclosing only a single accept statement, 
or a select statement that includes an interrupt accept alternative. 
The pragma interrupt has the effect that entry calls to the 
associated entry, on behalf of an interrupt, are made with a 
reduced call overhead. 

pragma IMAGES(<enumeration_tvpe>,Deferred) or 
pragma IMAGES(<enumeration_type>,Immediate): 

It may only appear within a compilation unit. 

The pragma images controls the creation and allocation of 
the image table for a specified enumeration type. The 
default is Deferred, which saves space in the literal pool 
by not creating an image table for an enumeration type 
unless the 'Image. 'Value, or ’Width attribute for the type 
is used. If one of these attributes is used, an image table 
is generated in the literal pool of the compilation unit in 
which the attribute appears. If the attributes are used in 
more than one compilation unit, more than one image table is 
generated, eliminating the benefits of deferring the table. 

pragma STATE PARTITION SET; 

It may appear in library level package specifications only. 

This pragma identifies the root package of a package family 
that is placed into a 1750a address state by the linker.

. Implementation Dependent Attributes 


'Offse: Attribute 

‘Offset along with the attribute ‘Address, facilitates machine code 
insertions. For a prefix P that denotes a declared parameter 
object. P’Offset yields the statically known portion of the 
address of the first of the storage units allocated to P. The 
value is the objects offset relative to a base register and is 
of type Long_Integer. 


INTEGER ATTRIBUTES 


’Extended Image Attribute 


Usage: X‘Extended_Image(Item.Width.Base.Based,Space_IF_Positive) 

Returns the image associated with Item as per the Textlo definition. 
The Text lo definition states that the value of Item is an integer 
literal with no underlines, no exponent, no leading zeros 
(but a single zero for the zero value) and a minus sign if negative. 

If the resulting sequence of characters to be output has fewer than 
Width characters then leading spaces are first output to make up 
the difference. (LR\1 14.3.7:10.14.3.7:11) 

For a prefix .X that is a discrete type or subtype: this attribute 
is a function that may nave more than one parameter. The parameter 
Item must be an integer value. The resulting string is 
without underlines, leading zeros, or trailing spaces. 


B-3 






APPENDIX F, Com. 


Parameter Descriptions: 

Item — The us- r specifies the item that he wants the 

image of and passes it into the funriion. This 
parameter is required. 

Width — The user may specify the minimum number of 

characters to be in the string that is returned. 

If no width is specified then the default (0) is 
assumed. 

Base -- The user may specify the base that the image is 

to be displayed in. If no base is specified then 
the default (10) is assumed. 

Based -- The user may specify whether he wants the string 

returned to be in base notation or not. If no 
preference is specified then the default (false) 
is assumed. 

Space lf Positive — The user may specify whether or not the sign bit 
of a positive integer is included in the string 
returned. If no preference is specified then 
the default (false) is assumed. 

Examples: 

Suppose the following subtype was declared: 

Subtype X is Integer Range -10.. 16: 

Then the following would be true: 

X‘Extended_Image(5) = "5" 

X'Extended_Image(5.0) = "5” 

X’Extended^magefi^) = " 5" 

X'Extended_Image(5.0.2) = "101" 

X‘Extended_lmage(5.4.2) = " 101" 

X'Ext.enaed_Image(5.0.2.True) = "2-101 = " 

X'Extended_Image(5.0.10. False) = "5” 

X ! Extended_Image(5.0.10.False.True) = " 5" 
X'Extended_lmage(-1.0,10.Faise,False) = "-1" 
X’Extended_Image(-1.0.10.False,True) = "-1" 
X'Extended_Image(-1.1.10.False.True) = 
X’Extended_lmage(-1.0.2.True.True) = "-2=1 = " 
X'Extended_Image(-1.10.2.True.True) =" -2#! = " 


B-4 








APPENDIX F, Cont. 


’Extended V aiue Attribute 


Usage: X'Extended Value(ltem) 

Returns the value associated with Item as per the Text_lo definition. 
The Text Io definition states that given a string, it reads an 
integer value from the beginning of the string. The value returned 
corresponds to the sequence input. (LRM 14.3.7:14) 

For a prefix X that is a discrete type or subtype: this attribute 
is a function with a single parameter. The actual parameter Item 
must be of predefined type string. Any leading or trailing 
spaces in the string X are ignored. In the case where an illegal 
string is passed, a CONSTRAINT ERROR is raised. 

Parameter Descriptions: 

Item -- The user passes to the function a parameter of the 
predefined type string. The type of the returned 
value is the base type X. 

Examples: 

Suppose the following subtype was declared: 


Subtype X is Integer Range -10..16; 
Then the following would be true: 


X'Extended Value("5") 

= 5 

X’Extended Value(" 5") 

= 5 

X’Extended Value("2*101=St") 

= 5 

X'Extended Value("-1") 

= -1 

X'Extended Yalue(" -1") 

= -1 



APPENDIX F, Corn. 


"Extended Width Attribute 

Usage: X'Extended V\"idth( Base.Based.Space_If_Positi ve) 

R.eturns the width fur subtype of X. 

For a prefix X that is a discrete subtype; this attribute 
is a function that may have multiple parameters. This attribute 
yields the maximum image length over all values of the type 
or subtype X. 

Parameter Descriptions: 

Base — The user specifies the base for which the width 

will be calculated. If no base is specified 
then the default (10) is assumed. 

Based -- The user specifies whether the subtype is stated 

in based notation. If no value for based is 
specified then the default (false) is assumed. 

Space lf Positive — The user may specify whether or not the sign bit 
of a positive integer is included in the string 
returned. If no preference is specified then the 
default (false) is assumed. 


Examples: 


Suppose the following subtype was declared: 

Subtype X is Integer Range -10.. 16: 

Then the following would be true: 


X'Extended Width 

= 3 - "-10" 

X'Extended Width(lO) 

= 3 - "-10" 

X'Extended Width(2) 

= 5 - "10000" 

X'Extended Width( 10.True) 

= 7 - "-10^10*" 

X’Extended Width(2,True) 

= 8 - "2*10000*" 

X'Extended Width( 10.False,True) 

= 3 - " 16" 

X’Extended Width(10.True,False) 

= 7 - "-10*10*" 

X'Extended Width( 10.True,True) 

= 7 - " 10# 16* ”

APPENDIX F, Com. 


ENUMERATION ATTRIBUTES 


'Extended_lmage Attribute 

Usage: X’Extended It, age(lt.em,Width.Uppercase) 

Returns the image associated with Item as per the Text_lo definition. 
The Text Io definition states that given an enumeration literal, 
it will output the value of tiie enumeration literal (either an 
identifier or a character literal). The character case parameter 
is ignored for character literals. (LRM 14.3.9:9) 

For a prefix X that is a discrete type or subtype; this attribute 
is a function that may have more that one parameter. The parameter 
Item must be an enumeration value. The image of an enumeration 
value is the corresponding identifier which may have character case 
and return string width specified. 


Parameter Descriptions: 

Item — The user specifies the item that he wants the image of and 
passes it into the function. This parameter is required. 

Width — The user may specify the minimum number of characters to 
be in the string that is returned. If no width is 
specified then the default (0) is assumed. If the Width 
specified is larger than the image of Item, then the 
return string is padded with trailing spaces: if the 
Width specified is smaller than the image of Item then 
the default is assumed and the image of the enumeration 
value is output completely. 

Uppercase -- The user may specify whether the returned string is in 
uppercase characters. In the case of an enumeration 
type where the enumeration literals are character 
literals, the Uppercase is ignored anG the case 
specified by the type definition is taken. If no 
preference is specified then the default (true) is 
assumed.

WITHDRAWN TESTS 


Some tests are withdrawn from the ACVC because they do not conform to the 
Ada Standard. The following 44 tests had been withdrawn at the time of 
validation testing for the reasons indicated. A reference of the form 
Al-ddddd is to an Ada Commentary. 


a. E28005C: This test expects that the string "— TOP OF PAGE. —63" of 
line 204 will appear at the top of the listing page due to a pragma 
PAGE in line 203; but line 203 contains text that follows the pragma, 
and it is this text that must appear at the top of the page. 

b. A39005G: This test unreasonably expects a component clause to pack an 
array component into a minimum size (line 30). 

c. B97102E: This test contains an unintended illegality: a select 
statement contains a null statement at the place of a selective wait 
alternative (line 31). 

d. C97116A: This test contains race conditions, and it assumes that 

guards are evaluated indivisibly. A conforming implementation may use 
interleaved execution in such a way that the evaluation of the guards 
at lines 50 & 54 and the execution of task CHANGING 0F_THE_GUARD 

results in a call to REPORT.FAILED at one of lines 52 or 56. 

e. BC3009B: This test wrongly expects that circular instantiations will 
be detected in several compilation units even though none of the units 
is illegal with respect to the units it depends on; by AI-0C256, the 
illegality need not be detected until execution is attempted (line 
95). 

f. CD2A62D: This test wrongly requires that an array object's size be no 
greater than 10 although its subtype's size was specified to be 40 
(line 137). 

g. CD2A63A..D, CD2A66A..D, CD2A73A..D, and CD2A76A..D (16 tests): These

WITHDRAWN TESTS 


tests wrongly attempt to check the size of objects of a derived type 
(for which a 'SIZE length clause is given) by passing them to a 
derived subprogram (which implicitly converts them to the parent type 
(Ada standard 3.4:14)). Additionally, they use the 'SIZE length 
clause and attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic 
by the WG9 ARG. 

h. CD2A81G, CD2A83G, CD2A84M..N, and CD50110 (5 tests): These tests 

assume that dependent tasks will terminate while the main program 
executes a loop that simply tests for task termination; this is not 
the case, and the main program may loop indefinitely (lines 74, 85, 
86, 96, and 58, respectively). 

i. CD2B15C and CD7205C: These tests expect that a 'STORAGESIZE length 
clause provides precise control over the number of designated objects 
in a collection; the Ada standard 13.2:15 allows that such control 
must not be expected. 

j. CD2D11B: This test gives a SMALL representation clause for a derived 
fixed-point type (at line 30) that defines a set of model numbers that 
are not necessarily represented in the parent type; by Commentary 
AI-00099, all model numbers of a derived fixed-point type must be 
representable values of the parent type. 

k. CD5007B: This test wrongly expects an implicitly declared subprogram 
to be at the address that is specified for an unrelated subprogram 
(line 303). 

l. ED7004B, ED7005C..D, and ED7006C..D (5 tests): These tests check 
various aspects of the use of the three SYSTEM pragmas; the AVO 
withdraws these tests as being inappropriate for validation. 

m. CD7105A: This test requires that successive calls to CALENDAR.CLOCK 
change by at least SYSTEM.TICK; however, by Commentary AI-00201, it is 
only the expected frequency of change that must be at least 
SYSTEM.TICK—particular instances of change may be less (line 29). 

n. CD7203B and CD7204B: These tests use the 'SIZE length clause and 
attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic by the WG9 
ARG. 

o. CD7205D: This test checks an invalid test objective: it treats the 
specification of storage to be reserved for a task's activation as 
though it were like the specification of storage for a collection. 

p. CE2107I: This test requires that objects of two similar scalar types 
be distinguished when read from a file—DATA_ERR0R is expected to be 
raised by an attempt to read one object as of the other type. 
However, it is not clear exactly how the Ada standard 14.2.4:4 is to 
be interpreted; thus, this test objective is not considered valid 
(line 90).

WITHDRAWN TESTS 


q. CE3111C: This test requires certain behavior, when two files are 
associated with the same external file, that is not required by the 
Ada standard. 

r. CE3301A: This test contains several calls to END_OF LINE and 

END_OF_PAGE that have no parameter: these calls were intended to 
specify a file, not to refer to STANDARD_INPUT (lines 103, 107, 118, 
132. and 136). 

s. CE3*.11B: This test requires that a text file's column number be set to 
COUNT'LAST in order to check that LAYOUT ERROR is raised by a 
subsequent PUT operation. But the former operation will generally 
raise an exception due to a lack of available disk space, and the test 
would thus encumber validation testing.
