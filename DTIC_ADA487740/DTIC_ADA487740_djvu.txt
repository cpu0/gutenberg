Abstract 


ORA is a network analysis tool that detects risks or vulnerabilities of an organization’s design 
structure. The design structure of an organization is the relationship among its personnel, 
knowledge, resources, and tasks entities. These entities and relationships are represented by the 
Meta-Matrix. Measures that take as input a Meta-Matrix are used to analyze the structural 
properties of an organization for potential risk. ORA contains over 100 measures which are 
categorized by which type of risk they detect. Measures are also organized by input requirements 
and by output. ORA generates formatted reports viewable on screen or in log files, and reads and 
writes networks in multiple data formats to be interoperable with existing network analysis 
packages. In addition, it has tools for graphically visualizing Meta-Matrix data and for 
optimizing a network’s design structure. ORA uses a Java interface for ease of use, and a C++ 
computational backend. The current version ORA1.2 software is available on the CASOS 
website: http://www.casos.ece.cmu.edu/projects/ORA/index.html.

3 Dynamic Network Analysis 

Dynamic Network Analysis (DNA)* is an emergent scientific field that brings 
together traditional social network analysis (SNA), link analysis (LA) and multi-agent 
systems (MAS)*. There are two aspects of this field. The first is the statistical analysis of 
DNA data. The second is the utilization of simulation to address issues of network 
dynamics. DNA networks vary from traditional social networks in that are larger 
dynamic multi-mode, multi-plex networks, and may contain varying levels of 
uncertainty. 

DNA statistical tools are generally optimized for large-scale networks and admit the 
analysis of multiple networks simultaneously in which, there are multiple types of nodes 
(multi-nodes)* and multiple types of links (multi-plex)*. In contrast, SNA statistical tools 
focus on single or at most two mode data and facilitate the analysis of only one type of 
link at a time. 

DNA statistical tools tend to provide more measures to the user, because they have 
measures that use data drawn from multiple networks simultaneously. From a computer 
simulation perspective, nodes in DNA are like atoms in quantum theory, nodes can be, 
though need not be, treated as probabilistic. 




Whereas nodes in a traditional SNA model are static, nodes in a DNA model have 
the ability to learn. Properties change over time; entities can adapt: A company's 
employees can learn new skills and increase their value to the network; Or, kill one 
terrorist and three more are forced to improvise. Change propagates from one entity to 
the next and so on. DNA adds the critical element of a network's evolution and considers 
the circumstances under which change is likely to occur.

4 File Formats 

ORA can read in a multitute of file formats. 

Below is a list, with examples of the code, of those formats. 

DyNetML - .dl - UCINET - comma delimited (.csv) - text files (.txt) - Pajek (.net) - 
GraphML - GMU model (.stl) - Pathfinder (.lo). 

Dynetml (the native ORA xml format): DynetML is an xml based interchange language 
for relational data including nodes, ties, and the attributes of nodes and ties. DyNetML is 
a universal data interchange format to enable exchange of rich social network data and 
improve compatibility of analysis and visualization tools, 
cnode id="colJack_o'neill"> 

<properties> 

<property name="ally" type="string" value="yes"/> 

<property name="gender" type="string" value="male"/> 

</properties> 

</node> 

<graph sourceType="Agent" source="Agent" targetType="Agent" target="Agent" 
id="agent x agent" isDirected="true"> 

<edge source="A01" target="All" type="double" value="l"/> 

<edge source="A02" target="A01" type="double" value="l"/> 

</graph> 


2 



.dl: DL (for "data language") is a very powerful and (fairly) simple language that allows 
the creation of quite complex and large UCINET data sets with minimal data entry. DL 
language files are plain ASCII text files that can be created with any editor (be sure to 
store the results as plain text). 

dl n=9, format=edgelistl 

labels: 

A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I 

data: 

1 1 1 

1 2 1 

1 6 1 


8 7 1 

9 9 1 


.##h and ##d (UCINet): UCINET datasets are stored in a special (Pascal) format, but can 
be created and manipulated using both UCINET's and other software tools (text editors 
and spreadsheets). Each UCINET dataset consists of two separate files that contain 
header information (e.g. myfile.##h) and the data lines (e.g. myfile.##d). Because of this 
somewhat unusual way of storing data, it is best to create data sets with the internal 
spreadsheet editor or DL language tools, or to import text or spreadsheet files and save 
the results as UCINET files. 


.CSV (comma separated values): The CSV ("Comma Separated Value") file format is 
often used to exchange data between disparate applications. The file format, as it is used 
in Microsoft Excel, has become a pseudo standard throughout the industry, even among 
non-Microsoft platforms. File most commonly created from an Excel spreadsheet using 
the Save As... option 

• Each record is one line... but — A record separator may consist of a line feed 
(ASCII/LF=OxOA), or a carriage return and line feed pair (ASCII/CRLF=OxOD 
0x0A)... but — fields may contain embedded line-breaks (see below) so a record 
may span more than one line. 

• Fields are separated with commas. 

• Leading and trailing space-characters adjacent to comma field separators are 
ignored. 

• Fields with embedded commas must be delimited with double-quote characters. 


3 





• Fields that contain double quote characters must be surounded by double-quotes, 
and the embedded double-quotes must each be represented by a pair of 
consecutive double quotes. 

• A field that contains embedded line-breaks must be surounded by double-quotes 

• Fields with leading or trailing spaces must be delimited with double-quote 
characters. 

• Fields may always be delimited with double quotes. 

• The first record in a CSV file may be a header record containing column (field) 
names 

, AO 1, A02, A03, A04 
AO 1,0,0,0,0 
A02,l,0,0,0 
A03,l,0,0,0 
A04,l,0,0,0 


.txt (text files): Otherwise refered to ASCII files which contain no extemporaneous 
formating. 


.raw: net (Pajek): The file format accepted by Pajek provides information on the vertices, 
arcs (directed edges), and undirected edges. A short example showing the file format is 
given below: 

* Vertices 3 

1 "Docl" 0.0 0.0 0.0 ic Green be Brown 

2 "Doc2" 0.0 0.0 0.0 ic Green be Brown 

3 "Doc3" 0.0 0.0 0.0 ic Green be Brown 
*Arcs 

12 3c Green 
2 3 5 c Black 
*Edges 

13 4c Green 


.graphml: GraphML is a comprehensive and easy-to-use file format for graphs. It consists 
of a language core to describe the structural properties of a graph and a flexible extension 
mechanism to add application-specific data. Unlike many other file formats for graphs, 
GraphML does not use a custom syntax. Instead, it is based on XML and hence ideally 
suited as a common denominator for all kinds of services generating, archiving, or 
processing graphs.

.stl (GMU model): This file format is native to the stereolithography CAD software 
created by 3D Systems. STL files describe only the surface geometry of a three 
dimensional object without any representation of color, texture or other common CAD 
model attributes and can us both ASCII and binary representations 
An ASCII STL file begins with the line: 
solid {name} 

where name is an optional string. The file continues with any number of triangles, each 
represented as follows: 
facet normal nl n2 n3 
outer loop 
vertex vll vl2 vl3 
vertex v21 v22 v23 
vertex v31 v32 v33 
endloop 
endfacet 

where nl-n3 and vll-v33 are floating point numbers in sign-mantissa'e'-sign-exponent 
format and concludes with: 
endsolid {name} 


.lo (pathfinder):

5 Getting Started 


Welcome to ORA's Help File system! 

The ORA help set is organized into the following top-level folders: 

To begin with, if you're not familiar with Social Network Analysis, then you should read 
through this manual. It's broken up into six parts. 

1. Getting Started: provides an overview of Social Networks and how they pertain to 
ORA. 

2. The Main Interface: The Main Interface is the area for working with the data 
within the Networks. This includes loading, saving & merging, performing 
various math functions on the Networks, generating a variety of networks, and 
running reports. 

3. The Visualizer: This is the graphical tool for visualizing the Networks. It contains 
tools for displaying (or hiding) nodes and links, creating different groupings, and 
displaying information about the Network. 

4. ORA Measures: This section contains explanations of the various measures used 
in ORA. They contain a short explanation and (for the most part) the math used in 
the measure. It also describes the type, input, and output. 

5. Lessons: Lessons designed to teach specific materials. 

6 Network Drives 

If you are running on a network drive then the help system needs a drive letter in order to 
work correctly. There are 2 possible solutions to this: 

1. Copy the ORA folder to each local machine. 

2. If at all possible Map a Network Drive. Right click on the shared folder and select 
Map Network drive. 

6.1 Mapping a Network Drive 

In an Explorer window select My Network Places. Find the name of the network which 
contains ORA.

7 ORA and DNA 


In general, you may want to use ORA in conjunction with other computational tools 
to advance DNA theory. The CMU CASOS tools that work with ORA to form tool 
chains are AutoMap (extracts networks from texts) and various DNA simulators 
including both Construct and DyNet. These tools are often used in a number of real world 
applications, including the following areas: 

• Designing adaptive teams for Command and Control Networks 

• Estimating the impact of organizational downsizing 

• Estimating the effectiveness of new structures 

• Evaluating risk in organizational designs 

• Examine impact of IT effectiveness 

• Impact analysis of actions in asymmetric warfare simulation 

• Impact analysis of weaponized biological attacks on cities 

ORA is interoperable with a number of other SNA and link-analysis tools: UCINET, 
KeyPlayer, and Analyst Notebook. Additional information is listed under data import and 
export.

9 Overview: The Organizational Risk Analyzer 

ORA is an analysis tool designed to help the user evaluate one or more networks. It 
can be used to assess the nature of, features of, change in, and determinants of complex 
networks. A large variety of networks can be assessed including, but not limited to, social 
networks, activity networks, task networks, knowledge networks, supply chains, and 
communication networks. Using ORA questions such as the following can be addressed: 
what is critical, are there groups of interest, are there patterns of interest, how might 
interventions impact the network, who is critical, are there emerging groups, how is the 
network changing. 

What is a network? In any data there are relations among things such as two people 
are cousins, or a set of people are all members of the same club. These networks might be 
psychological or cultural as when two people share the same belief. They might be 
physical as in two resources being in the same location or two computers being connected 
by a line, or they might be social as in people being related. There are many reasons why 
networks exist. Networks are ubiquitous. Everyone and everything is constrained and 
enabled by the networks in which they are embedded. Everyone and everything is 
embedded in multiple networks; e.g. you are connected to some people due to work, 
others due to school, others due to your kids, and so on. ORA lets you visualize, assess, 
and reason about these networks. 

9.1 What kinds of networks? 

ORA can assess any type of network. Anything that can be represented as a set of 
nodes and relations can be assessed. Typical networks are: social networks (who interacts 
with whom), financial networks (who lends money to whom); gant charts (what task 
needs to be done before what), supply chains (what resources are needed to build what 
other resources)., semantic networks (what ideas are linked to what ideas), proximity 
networks (what states border on what states), and so on. ORA can assess any data that 
can be represented as nodes and relations regardless of what the nodes are or what the 
relations are. 

9.2 What if there are many networks? 

ORA can be used to assess the interlocks among networks. For examples, imagine 
that the following networks exist: who works with whom; who has what skills, what 
skills are needed for what tasks, who is doing what tasks then ORA can assess whether in 
fact the right people have been assigned to those tasks or where there are problems 
because there is insufficient skills available for the task. ORA can assess "multi-mode 
multi-link" data. 


10 



9.3 What if the networks change? 

ORA can be used to assess change in networks over time. Over time, the shape or 
topology of a network might change; e.g., start up companies move from a collaborative 
to a hierarchical structure, terrorists change what weapons they use to attack sites, 
scholars cite different papers, and so on. Consequently, over time, who or what is critical 
in a network might change. ORA can assess change in networks, and forecast possible 
ways in which the network might change in the future. 

9.4 What if information is incomplete? 

ORA can assess networks even when information is incomplete. ORA has been 
built to gracefully degrade so that it calculates all and only those metrics for which there 
is information. 

9.5 Illustrative applications 

ORA has been applied in numerous settings. Examples include the following. 
Assessment of team-x leadership structure at NASA. Comparison of terror networks. 
Identification of vulnerabilities in insurgency and terror networks. Assessing change in 
political elite structures in Korea and early identification of emergent leaders. Designing 
teams for wargames. Assessing the impact of turnover and retirement on public health 
organizations in Duchess County, NY. Identifying waports with AIS data. Organizations 
where ORA has been used include: AFIT, SOCOM, USMA, CIA, many universities. 

9.6 Tool Evolution 

There are still many challenges in the area of dynamic network analysis. Key 
challenges include handling streaming data, locating confidence intervals for metrics, 
uncertainty assessment, and so on. As these challenges are met, new algorithms are 
implemented, tested and added to ORA thus further meeting the user's needs.

Social Network Analysis (SNA) 

Social Network Analysis* is a scientific area focused on the study of relations, 
often defined as social networks. 

In its basic form, a social network is a network where the people entities and the relations 
links are a form of connection such as friendship. Social Network Analysis takes graph 
theoretic ideas and applies them to the social world. 

The term social network was first coined in 1954 by J. A. Barnes (see: Class and 
Committees in a Norwegian Island Parish). Social network analysis is also called network 
analysis, structural analysis, and the study of human relations. SNA is often referred to as 
the science of connecting the dots. 

Today, the term Social Network Analysis (or SNA) is used to refer to the analysis 
of any network such that all the entities are of one type (e.g., all people, or all roles, or all 
organizations), or at most two types (e.g., people and the groups they belong to). The 
metrics and tools in this area, since they are based on the mathematics of graph theory, 
are applicable regardless of the type of nodes in the network or the reason for the 
connections. 

For most researchers, the entities are actors. As such, a network can be a cell of 
terrorists, employees of global company or simply a group of friends. However, entities 
are not limited to actors. A series of computers that interact with each other or a group of 
interconnected libraries can comprise a network also.

10 Stargate - Summit - Synopsis 



10.1 Story Background 

The data for this scenario is based on the Sci-Fi tv show, Stargate SG-1 and 
specifically the episodes Summit / Last Stand. Following is a synopsis of the episodes if 
you have an questions regarding the dataset. 

10.2 The DataSets 

The Agents - Colonel Jack O'Neill, Major Samantha Carter, Doctor Daniel Jackson, 
Teal'c, Jacob Carter/Selmak, Lt Elliot, Ren'al, Aldwin, Janet Frazier, Major 
Mansfield, General Hammond, Lantash, Narim, Travell, Osiris, Yu 

10.3 The Short of it 

The Tok'ra are planning an attack which would kill all of the head Gou'ald in one 
fell swoop by inflitrating a summit and poisoning them all simultanously. With the help 
of Stargate Command and the U.S. Military they are able to infiltrate the summit. The 
plan is going fine until new information is disclosed which changes everything. 

10.4 The Story 

The Tok'ra have information regarding a secret Gou'ald summit of all the System 
Lords. They devise a plan to destroy the organization once and for all by poisoning theie 
symbiotes, but they have need of one thing. A human (tauri) who speaks fluent Gou'ald. 
Ren'al (the head of the Tok'ra council) travels to Earth to meet with Stargate Command in 
order to recruit Dr. Daniel Jackson. Dr. Jackson is a human who is fluent in Gou'ald. The 
System Lords have declared a truce for the summit and each System Lord can bring one 
human servant. 

SG-1 journeys to the Tok'ra homeworld, Revanna. Jacob Carter, previously of the 
U.S. military but now a Tok'ra, presents the plan to Colonel O'Neill and SG-1. He's 
established himself as a minor Goa'uld in the service of Yu. He can help get Daniel inside 
Yu's home base by using the Reole memory-altering chemical to convince Yu that he is 
his closest human slave, Jarren. 

Elsewhere, the Goa'uld Zipacna, a servant of the new and very powerful Goa'uld, 
welcomes a guest, Osiris. Zipacna offers her a position in service of the Goa'uld, Anubis. 


13 


Osiris prepares to depart Zipacna's ship for the summit, as Anubis' official representative. 
Zipacna, meanwhile, has learned the location of the new Tok'ra homeworld, Revenna, 
from a captured spy and plans to launch a full-scale invasion. 

Jacob and Daniel successfully dispose of Jerran, and, using the reole drug, trick Yu into 
believing Daniel is his faithful servant. Yu and Daniel depart to the summit. 

Six of the galaxy's most powerful System Lords are waiting: Ba'al, Olokun, Morrigan, 
Bastet, Kali the Destroyer, and Svarog. They are waiting, though, for another guest, the 
powerful Goa'uld who has been dealing them all heavy defeats in battle, but who refuses 
to make his identity known. 

As the attack begins on Revanna SG-1 and SG-17 try to help the Tok'ra, but little 
can be done. The Goa'uld have dialed into Revanna's Stargate, thusly preventing their 
escape. Zipacna continues bombing the surface of Revanna, in an attempt to flush out the 
resistance. As the tunnels collapse many Tok'ra are killed along with Major Mansfield. 
Ren'al encrypts the symbiote poison formula onto a data crystal but is killed by falling 
debris shortly after. Major Samantha Carter takes the data crystal for safe keeping. A 
large holding tank, where the symbiote Lantash is being kept alive, is destroyed and 
Lantash takes refuge in the dying Lieutenant Elliot as a host. 

Colonel O'Neill, Teal'c and the Aldwin do a scouting run on the surface of the 
planet only to find Zipacna has amassed an army of Jaffa troops on the surface. Aldwin is 
killed on their way back to the tunnels. SG-1 regroups but more tunnel collapses prevent 
their escape to the ring room. Their path to the surface is blocked. 

Back at the summit Osiris, the final guest, arrives. Daniel is caught by surprise. Osiris 
had taken possession of his friend Sarah Gardner a year ago. Osiris recognizes Daniel, 
but does not reveal this to the System Lords. 

In private Daniel communicates her arrival to Jacob. Her arrival presents a large problem. 
Osiris confronts Daniel Jackson and demands to know what he's is planning. Daniel 
manages to prick her with his ring containing the reole memory drug and convinces her 
that he is but Yu's human servant. The drug takes affect and she leaves, somewhat 
confused. Col. O'Neill and Teal'c find a set of Tok'ra tunneling crystals which they use to 
grow new tunnels. Major Carter tries to help Lt. Elliot stay alive. 

Oiris tells the System Lords she represents the Anubis, who had been believed to 
be dead for 1,000 years. Anubis has dealt blows to each and every System Lord. Anubis 
wants entrance back into the System Lords. The Goa'uld vote to allow Anubis to rejoin 
them, and for Osiris to represent him. 

Daniel reports this to Jacob Carter. They both agree that the plan to poison the System 
Lords must be aborted. If they wipe out the seven most powerful System Lords now, 
Anubis will be free to conquer the galaxy. 

SG-1 and Lt. Elliot make it to the surface but must still must avoid the Jaffa army. They 
begin the 25-mile walk to the Tok'ra beacon to send a signal to Daniel and Jacob. At the 
beacon Maj. Carter sends a signal to Jacob and Daniel. 


14 



Jacob tells Daniel to get off the space station. But Daniel decides to attempt to kidnap 
Osiris (still hoping to free her from the Gou'ald). When she arrives, he locks her in the 
hold and readies to steal the ship. But Yu intervenes saying that his servant Jarren has 
betrayed him. He releases Osiris. But believing that Yu plotted to kidnap her she stabs 
Yu. As she prepares to kill Daniel he reveals who he really is. This cause her to hesitate. 
That, and the attack by Yu gives him the opportunity to escape. 

On their return to Revenna Jacob and Daniel are shot down by the Jaffa army and crash. 
SG-1 finds them shaken but unhurt. Lt Elliot/Lantash, knowing he's dieing anyway, 
volunteers to sacrifice himself by taking the symbiote posion and wait to be captured. 
He'll then release the poison clearing the way for SG-1 to escape through the Stargate. 
Colonel O'Neill hates to leave his man behind, but sees that there is no other choice. The 
team goes into hiding. Elliot places the poison in his pocket, and listens as the footfalls of 
the approaching Jaffa army loom ever closer.

12 RELEASE NOTES: ORA 1.9.0 

TERMINOLOGY CLARIFICATION 

So that the help file mirrors the actual tool in use, some terms have been 
deliberately left in the help documentation that have since been refined in use as they 
specifically apply to the ORA interface. To avoid confusion, the ORA Help will refer to 
terms as they are still used in the ORA interface, though the term may need to be 
updated. However, what follows is a clarification of all key terms one will encounter in 
the both the interface and the help. For other terms, please see Basic Terms in the ORA 
help documentation. 

ENTITY 

Can be who, what, where, how, why, a thing that is being studied. For example, 
entities can be people, agents, organizations, beliefs, expertise areas, resources, tasks, 
events, locations. 

NODE 

The representation of a single entity (a who, what, where, how why item). This 
pertains to actually looking at a network model. In the visual model, entities are called 
nodes. 

META-NODE 

The representation of a group of nodes as one node. For example, if Bob, Carol, 
Ted, and Alice are all accountants, they could all belong to the Meta-Node Accountants 
which would contain all their individual nodes. 

LINK 

The representation of the tie, connection, relation, edge between two nodes. 

META-LINK 

The representation of a Group of links. 

NETWORK 


16 



The representation of a set of nodes, including meta-nodes, of one type and the links, 
including meta-links, of one type between them. 

META-NETWORK 

The representation of a Group of networks. 

LABEL 

Each entity, node, link or network has a type — what kind it is, is called a label. 
This can be the common name, an id — unique identifying number or some other kidn of 
label. 

ENTITY CLASS 

A set of entities of one type. 

NODE CLASS 

A set of nodes of one type. Note: a set of nodes of one type can be represented as 
a meta-node. 

LINK CLASS 

A set of links of one type. Note: a set of links of one type can be represented as a 
meta-link. 

NETWORK CLASS 

A set of networks of one type. Note: a set of networks of one type can be 
represented as a meta-network. 

GROUP 

A collection of things, such as entities, nodes, ties, and networks. A group might at 
times be represented as a meta-node. 

Nodes may be classified in groups based on a shared attribute, type, id-range, label, 
user selection, etc. For example: if you have a set of people and know their gender, 
then there might be two groups - men and women. 

In addition, the nodes representing those people could be displayed as a meta-node 
for men and a meta-node for women. 

Nodes may be classified into groups based on a grouping algorithm. For example, if 
you have a network showing connections among members of an organization and you 
run a grouping algorithm it will return clusters of nodes that fit together on some 
mathematical criteria. This cluster is a group and can be represented as a meta-node. 

TRAIL 

A set of nodes and links that form a single unbroken chain, such that no node or link is 
repeated. 

PATH 

A set of nodes and links that form a single unbroken chain, such that no nodes and links 
can be repeated.

13 What Is ORA? 

13.1 An Overview 

The Organizational Risk Analyzer (ORA) is a statistical analysis package for 
analyzing complex systems as Dynamic Social Networks. 

Many complex systems such as organizations, intra-state alliances, food webs, etc. can be 
represented as an ecology of interlinked networks. Within ORA any complex system is 
represented as a Network. What follows is a general description of ORA's primary 
capabilities. Specific instruction is provided under the correlating folders in this help 
system. 

See Basic Terms for additional definitions relating to Social Networks. 

13.2 The ORA Visualizer 

The ORA Visualizer renders conceptual images of social networks. Nodes such as 
Agents, Task, Knowledge and Organizations represent real-world Entities like the 
president of a company, driving to the airport, or how to wash your clothes. Nodes which 
share the same attributes can be further grouped together creating Meta-Node. Links 
connect nodes that share a direct relationship. Such relationships are derived from the 
Network. ORA's single unit of data input, and are referred to as graphs. The ORA 
visualizer is interactive. You can zoom, rotate, isolate, add and remove Meta-Nodes, and 
much more. 

13.3 Reports 

ORA can run many reports: Risk, Intelligence, and Sphere of Influence to name a 
few. Multiple organizations can be compared against each other, network structure can be 
optimized, subgroups within a network can be identified, and scenarios involving the 
removal of nodes or links can be examined. Reporting capabilities are constantly being 
refined and updated. 

13.4 Charts 

Four chart types are available: Bar Chart, Scatter Plot, Histogram, and Heat Map. 
Each one in turn presents a different statistical profile of a selected nodeset. Examples of 
these reports and how to access them can be found under Basic Usages. 


18 



14 Where To Begin 


To begin you need data to run in ORA. And not data in just any format. ORA uses 
particular data formats: DyNetML*, .csv*, GraphML*, and a couple others. 

The examples in the ORA help file use a dataset based on the popular Sci-Fi TV show, 
Stargate. You can download a copy of this dataset to practice using ORA at the following 
URL: 

http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/computational_tools/datasets/internal/stargate/index2.html 
Another method is to create a MetaNetwork from an Excel spreadsheet and save it as a 
.csv* file. 

Let's now assume you've created a MetaNetwork after reading through the 
documentation. 

From the Main Menu select: File => Open MetaNetwork. Then navigate to the directory 
which contains the MetaNetwork you want. 

If this is the first MetaNetwork you're opening it will appear in panel 1. If there are 
already Matrices open you'll get the following dialog box. 


Load Organizations from embassy.xml 



Do you want the Organizations in "embassy.xml" 
to replace only the currently selected Organization,, 
to be appended as additional Organization(s),. 
or to replace all currently loaded Organization(s)? 


Replace Selected Org 


Append as Additional Org 


Replace All Orgs 


Choose Replace Selected Org to remove the previous MetaNetwork and replace it with 
the current one; 

Choose Append As Additional Org to add it to any MetaNetworks already loaded in the 
ORA session; 

Choose Replace all Orgs to remove any MetaNetworks loaded into ORA and start over 
with the current MetaNetwork only.

and spatial link matrix (binary or general). It uses neighbouring weights so Moran's I and 
Geary's c randomization tests are equivalent. 


20 







16 Attribute Partition Tool 


To create new Meta-Networks which are a subset of nodes use the Attribute 
Partition. Select an Node-Class(es), select the Attribute set, then select the individual 
attribute(s) to form a new Meta-Network. 



There are four sections to the dialog box: 

Select a Meta-Network: The dropdown menu lists all the currently open Meta-Networks 
Here 1 selected ",stargate_summit". 

Select Node Class(es): Place a checkmark in the box(es) of the NodeSets you want 
included. 

I selected all the NodeSets 

Select an attribute: This dropdown menu shows all the attribute(s) contained within the 
selected NodeSet(s). If you change the NodeSet(s) the choice of attribute(s) will be 
reflected in this dropdown. 

For an attribute set I selected ally. 


21 































Attribute Value: Place a checkmark in the box(es) of the attributes you want included in 
the new Meta-Networks. 

Finally I chose two values "yes" and "no". 

Next select the [Compute] button. The following dialog box will appear showing the 
number of new Meta-Networks created. 



Close the dialog box. In the main interface you'll see your new Meta-Networks listed in 
Panel 1. The two new Meta-Networks contain, in their names, the source such as ally=yes 
and ally=no. 


- stargate_summit ally=no

the new network. 


23 










17 Measures Manager 

Before you run any measures on a Meta-Network you can use the Measures Manager to 
set exactly which measures you wish to run. 

Form the main interface menu select Analysis => Measures Manager. 



The dialog box has multiple sections: 

17.1 Filter Commands : 

This section comprises two radio buttons (Match at least one filter I Match all filters) 
which allow for complex filterings, a [Reset Filters] button, and a Search textbox used for 
inputing your search. Whatever searches you input in this section are reflected in the 
Tabbed Window below. It will display only the nodes which match the search(es). 

17.2 item(s) Selected I Visible I Total 

When first called up the All Measures tab defaults to showing every measures available. 
When started there were 137 item(s) selected, 137 visible, 137 total. 

Selecting the Slow Measures tab this changes to 16 item(s) selected, 16 visible, 16 total. 


24 





















































Typing Cognitive into the seach textbox reduces this to 16 item(s) selected, 8 visible, 16 
total showing that only 8 out of the 16 Slow Measures contain the word Cognitive. 
Furthermore you can deselect measures by removing the checkmark next to the measure's 
name. With each measure deselected the number of selected items will reduce by one. 
With these tools you can select only the measures you want to run reports on. 

17.3 Buttons 

• Reorder 

• Select All: Selects (puts a checkmark in the box) all visible measures 

• Clear All: De-Selects (removes checkmarks) from all visible measures. 

17.4 Tabbed Window 

This section contains tabs which sort the measures into various categories. 

Each of the nine tabs sorts out the measures in different categories. This is very useful for 
large MetaNetworks when you'd prefer not run, say the Slow Measures* cause it would 
put too much a drain on your machine. By removing the checkboxes for the Slow 
Measures they are taken out of the mix and the reports will effectively ignore them. You 
can turn them back on when you're finished by placing a checkmark back in the box. 

In the Tabbed Window there are four columns: 

1. Last Name : Deals the general type of measure (Congruence, Exclusivity, 
Cognitive...). Most entries in this column will display one row as they are singular 
in what they need to show. Others will display two rows as it's nearly the same 
measure run on both knowledge and resources. Then a few (like Centrality) will 
display quite a few rows the types of measures written for that type of measures 
are somewhat varied. 

2. First Name : Deals with the category of the measure (Betweenness, Closeness, 
Centrality...). This is a secondary factoring. 

3. Graph Level: Graph Level* produces a single number as output. 

4. Entity Level: Entity Level* produces one number per entity. 

17.5 Drop-Down Menu 

Gives the user the ability to select which currently active Meta-Network to run the 
measures on, as well as, which individual networks.

19 Near Term Impact Analysis 


The Near Term Analysis (NTA) is a tool that allows for the removal of nodes from a 
given organizational structure to evaluate how the organization will likely perform as a 
result. The Near Term Analysis tool uses a multi-agent model as input, Dynet ML*. 

The goal is to provide an answer to the question on how an organization will behave and 
change after considering a sequence of strategic interventions or personnel loss by way of 
agent removal. In other words, we want to know what happens when we remove nodes 
from an organization, be they people, places, resources, knowledge sets or other common 
Node Classes*. 

This example will use the Stargate dataset (SG-1). This dataset is included with the 
version of ORA downloaded and can be found online at the following url: 
http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/ora/sample.php. 

From the menu bar select File => Open Meta-Network then select SGI.xml. 

In this example, we will remove two agents: daniel Jackson and maj_samantha_carter 

1. Open the SGI MetaNetwork into ORA. 

2. Highlight the SGI Meta-Network before starting NTA in the ORA Meta-Network 
Manager panel. 

3. From the main menu select Analysis => Near-Term Analysis. 

NOTE : If your dataset contains an Organization nodeset ORA will display the NTA main 
window. If not, it will ask for you to chose a substitute Organization nodeset. 



28 



















When a Meta-Network is first loaded into ORA's the Near Term Analysis, a pop-up may 
appear asking for a location node. Select Cancel and proceed with the Near Term 
Analysis. 



The NTA main window consisted of four sub panels: Input Data, Settings, Simulation 
time line and Cases to simulate. Below is a brief description of each panel: 



19.1 1. Input Data 

In this section is the file name of the Meta-Network loaded. 

19.2 2. Settings (Global Parameters) 

In the Setting area are two text boxes. The first, The Number of replications informs 
ORA how many times to run the simulation. The second, The number of simulated time- 
points defines the range in the section Simulation time line. 

In the settings area, there are two critical factors: 1) the number of replications and 2) the 
number of simulated time points. 

Why is this important? 


29 






















The number of replications if set at a higher versus lower value, will result in more 
experiments being conducted on the scenario the tool is presented. Therefore, the more 
replications the more likely the results will mirror those in a real world example. 

The number of time points determines the length of the Near Term Analysis iterations. If 
this number is also set to a relatively high value, the simulation will take longer. 

NOTE : Be mindful of any memory considerations when running high value replications 
or time points. 

19.3 3. Simulation time line 

This are of the Near Term Analysis tool shows a visual representation of the time points 
selected in Settings area above. 

19.4 4. Cases to simulate 

After the settings (global parameters) are set, the virtual experiment cells need set. 
Initially, there is a pre-defined simulation cell, the Baseline. The Baseline is the cell 
without any entities removed as is the control situation when the organization does not 
experience any interventions. Besides Baseline, any other cells need set up. Start by 
selected Add new simulation instances, the leftmost of the four buttons. 

19.5 Add new simulation cases 

To run a Near Term Analysis, we will begin by selected the Add new simulations cases 
button from the main Near Term Analysis Tool (see area highlighted in red ellipse 
below). 


30 




After selecting Add new simulation instances button, a dialog box titled Near Term 
Analysis- Simulation scenario create wizard will appear. This wizard supports the 
creation of virtual experiment cells in three different ways. The First allows for the most 
freedom of choice. The second and the third options will ask for a set of criteria for 
selecting important agents in the network and make experiment cells according to the 
selection. Therefore, the first option gives full flexibility to users, and the second and the 
third option provides a systematic analysis setup method. To proceed this demonstration, 
select the first option and select [Next]. 


31 




















Near Term Analysis - Simulation scenario create wizard 


Simulation case create wizard 
Description 

Simulation case generator provides ways to setup the isolation cases by specifying who and when 
to isolate. There are three modes to setup the simulation cases. 

1) Create one simulation case by applying events to user-specified agents at user-specified time 

2) Create a set of cases by isolating agents one by one by generating the simulation cases 
corresponding to agents 

3) Create a set of cases by isolating a set of agents detected by a measure in ORA intel report by 
creating the simulation cases corresponding to measures in the intel report 

The first and the second methods will generate a set of simulation cases based on ORA intel report, and 
the third method will give users the full control of simulation case setup.

19.6 There are four options: 


The next section explores all four of the Near Term Analysis Options: 

Run the Step-by-Step Wizard - This process will help walk through setting up a near 
term analysis experiment on the Meta-Network loaded into the Near Term Analysis tool. 


Create one simulation case - In this simulation experiment, events and user-specified 
time can be applied to agents. 


Create a set of cases by isolating agents - This scenario isolates one agent and performs 
an experiment. Then the experiment can be performed again with the agent removed. 
Create a set of cases by isolating a set of agents relating to a specific measure. - Based on 
measures contained in the ORA intel report, a set of agents can be isolated and a 
simulation case can be created.

21 Near Term Impact Option 2 

21.1 Apply events to specified agents 

The second option for creating simulation files is to create one simulation case and apply 
events to specified agents, knowledge, or resource nodes. 

Select the [Add new simulation cases] button to bring up the wizard. 



35 






















































1. Type in search criteria to highlight only the agents to work with (i.e. typing in dan 
brought up only danieljackson. 

2. Place a checkmark on the line. Notice that when you placed a checkmark in the 
box the Event automatically changed to Isolation. 

3. Double-click in the Timing cell to select it and type in a number from 0 to the 
highest number you selected for your simulation. In this case we'll repeat with the 
timing of "5". 

4. Select the [Add events] button. This places the event in the Simulation event edit 
list section. 

5. If there were more events to add you could continue with the same procedure. 
When you are done, select the [Add a simulaton] button at the bottom. 

The two buttons beneath the Simulation event edit list section to remove events from the 
list. The [Remove all the events] button obviously removes everything in the Simulation 
event edit list but the Remove the selected events from the event list only removes the 
events with a checkmark beside them. 

The [Reset selection] button removes all checkmarks placed in the bottom table and sets 
the Event to No Event. 

The [Previous] button returns to the main Wizard screen. 

When you have finished you will have created the same two simulations as in Option 1.

ORA Reports provide a computational tool to analyze data that comprise a network as 
representated by a MetaMatrix or MetaNetworks. They are driven by a variety of key 
measures proven useful to researchers in the analysis of networks. 

27.2 Reports Explained 

All Measures - Runs a collection of measures and categorizes the output according to risk 
categories. Each category analyzes a particular aspect of the Meta-Matrix structure. 

Belief - The Belief report contains the most common beliefs shared by most people, the 
beliefs with the highest GINI coefficient, the most strongly held beliefs, the most likely to 
change beliefs, the most neutral individuals, and the most opinionated individuals. 
Capability - This report is used to assess an individuals' and organizations' capability to 
perform tasks. 

CPOF - Analyzes the creation and modification of events and tasks and agent 
collaboration over time. 

Change in Key entities - Analyzes the changes over time of the agents that score the 
highest in measure values. 

Communicative Power - Analyzes one or more mental map models, classifying concepts 
according to their values for selected measures. 

Communicators - Analyzes the communication network (agent by agent) and gives high 
level statistics on its structure. 

Complete - Computes all network analysis measures. 

Context - Compares measured values against various stylized forms of networks in an 
effort to characterize the networks topology. 

Core Network - Computes the core network and reports general statistics. 

Drill Down - Computes the drill down from a selected organization and then to a selected 
agent 

Event Analysis - Computes the central events with respect to other network entities. 

Group Talk - Analyzes the relationships between agent and knowledge. 

Immediate Impact - Computes the key actors of a network, and then isolates them 
individually to determine the effect on measure values. 

Influence Net - Displays the influence network and gives high level statistics on its 
structure. 

Intelligence - Identifies key entities and groups who by virtue of their position in the 
network are critical to its operation. 

Located Subgroups - Identifies the subgroups present in the network using various 
grouping algorithms. 

Location Analysis - Computes the central locations with respect to other network entities 
Management - Identifies over and underperforming individuals and assesses the state of 
the network as a functioning organization. 

Merchant Marine - Analyzes the relationships between crew members, owners, vessels 
and locations of the Merchant Marine Vessel data. 


45 



MRQAP - For multivariate cases, if your dependent variable is continous or count data 
(like in a negative binomial case), you should use MRQAP. If your dependent variable is 
binary, you should use ERGM (P*) which is forthcoming in ORA. One can perform 
MRQAP on data that have a dichotomous dependent variable (basically, this is equivalent 
to using a linear probability model). You do need to interpret your results accordingly. 
Potential Errors - Detects potential errors in agent to agent interactions based on the 
expected interactions from cognitive similarity and expertise. 

QAP Analysis - Computes QAP Correlation and Regression (Dekker and Y-Permutation 
methods) on input matrices. QAP is designed as a bivariate test (only two variables). 
Generally, QAP is perfectly fine for almost any bivariate network problem. 

Semantic Network - Analyzes one or more mental map models, computing the central 
graphs and key concepts and statements. 

Shortest Path - Computes the shortest path between two entities and general statistics on 
the paths. The Sphere of Influence on each entity is also computed. 

Simmelian Ties Analysis - Calculates the number of Asymmetric, Sole-Symmetric, and 
Simmelian ties in all Agent by Agent and Organization by Organization graphs and 
computes the standard measures on them. 

Sphere of Influence - For each individual, identifies the set of actors, groups, knowledge, 
resources, etc. that influence and are influenced by that actor. 

Standard Network Analysis - Calculates the standard network analysis measures (degree 
centrality, betweenness, centrality, etc.) 

Trails - Analyzes the trails that an entity class makes through another entity class; for 
example, how vessels pass through ports. 

Version Test - Recomputes the measures contained within the DyNetML file and 
compares them with the existing measures. This is a diagnostic tool. 

28 Report Overview 

All Measures - Runs a collection of measures and categorizes the output according to risk 
categories. Each category analyzes a particular aspect of the Network structure. 

Belief Propagation - The Belief Propagation Report contains the most common beliefs 
shared by most people, the beliefs with the highest GINI coefficient*, the most strongly 
held beliefs, the most likely to change beliefs, the most neutral individuals, and the most 
opinionated individuals. 

Capabilities - The Capability Report is used to assess an individuals' and organizations' 
capability to perform tasks.

Simmelian ties* in all Agent by Agent and Organization by Organization graphs and 
computes the standard measures on them. 

Sphere of Influence - For each individual, identifies the set of actors, groups, knowledge, 
resources, etc. that influence and are influenced by that actor. 

Standard Network Analysis - Calculates the standard network analysis measures (degree 
centrality, betweenness, centrality, etc.) 

Trails - Analyzes the trails that an entity class makes through another entity class; for 
example, how vessels pass through ports.

if you want to analyze the whole process of optimization. 



Select the [Finish] button 

The data log file will be displayed in the bottom panel of the main ORA Main Interface 
window. 

31 Meta-Network Anonymizer 

The Meta-Network Anonymize tool removes IDs (and optionally Titles) from any chosen 
NodeSet. 

This is particularly helpful if you are discussing sensitive network information about real 
people and wish to remove their names from the network model. 

From the main menu select Data Management => Meta-Network Anonymize.... 


54 

































1. Select a Meta-Network : All active Meta-Networks appear in the dropdown menu. 
Select the Meta-Network to anonymize. 

2. Select the node class to anonymize : Placing a checkmark in the box next to the 
NodeSet selects the NodeSet to be anonymized. Both the ID and Title will be 
replaced by an identical value. 

3. Anonymize node titles : A checkmark in this checkbox tells ORA to also 
anonymize the title attribute. 

4. Create decoder files : Creates a .CSV* file for future reference with the Encoded 
ID/Title and Original ID/Title 

31.1 Example 

On the left is the Agent NodeSet was selected without the Anonymize node titles 
checked. If the Anonymize node titles had been checked the NodeSet would have been 
changed as appears on the right. 

NOTE : ORA places the same value in both the Node ID and Node Title when Anonymize 
node title is checked.

32 Network Algebra 


The Network Algebra allows you to perform mathematical operations on two Meta- 
Networks. The options in ORA are addition, subtraction, and multiplication. 

Note: The term Network Algebra is synonymous with Matrix Algebra in computational 
parlance. Also, the following images display "Matrix Algebra" in the title bar. This may 
or may not be the case for the most recent version of ORA. 

These functions help spot strong and weak connections within a Meta-Network. 

I start with one Network loaded. 



From the menu select Data Management => Network Algebra... 

The Network Algebra dialog appears. There are six areas which you can manipulate. 
These are each described below the dialog box. 

Note : Both Networks should be the same dimensions. 

1. Select a MetaNetwork 


sgl v 
stargate

57 































This dropdown menu will show all the Networks you currently have active. To 
perform a math function on a Meta-Network, highlight it in the dropdown menu. 

2. Select an Operation 


Add Networks 

Add Networks 

A 

Subtract Networks 
Multiply Networks 

Dot Product Networks 
Set the Diagonal 

Add by a Scalar 
Subtract by a Scalar 
Multiply by a Scalar 

V 


This option allows you to choose which operation, Add, Subtract, or Multiply, 
you want to perform on the Networks. 

o Add: Adds together corresponding cells of two different Networks, 
o Subtract: Subtracts corresponding cells of two different Networks, 
o Multiply: Multiplication is slightly different than the add or subtract. The 
number of rows in the first Meta-Network must equal the number of 
columns in the second. A Meta-Network can be multipied by itself to help 
reveal specific strong and weak areas.

making it easier to read. 

Meta-Network Anonymize... - Used for resetting the NodelD (and optionally the Node 
Title) to anonymous values. 

Meta-Network Union - Creates a single Meta-Network from two (or more) existing 
Meta-Networks. 

Meta-Network - Used for adding or removing Meta-Networks from use. 

Node Class - Enables you to add, remove Node sets, as well as, change the size of the 
Node set. You can also add an Attribute to an existing Node Set. Depending on what you 
have selected different options may be greyed out. 

Network - Similar to Node Class in that you can add or remove Networks. This function 
also enables you to Set the Diagonal of a graph to either -1, 0 or +1. Useful for setting 
consistent values on an agent-by-agent Network.

34 Meta-Network Union 


The Meta-Network Union is used to combine two or more Meta-Networks together. 
There are tools to select which Meta-Networks to use or exclude and how to combine the 
link weights. ORA can save out the result as an entirely new MetaNetwork file. 



The Select a collection of meta-networks has two options. 

• Currently loaded in ORA will create a new Meta-Network from all the Meta- 
Networks loaded into ORA (except the ones that are sxcluded). 

• All files in the directory allows you to navigate to a directory in which are stored 
multiple Meta-Networks. 

Next is Select filters which narrows the Meta-Networks to use. 

• Use only meta-networks in the date range: filters meta-networks which fall 
outside the selected dates. This information is maintained in a separate document 
file. 

• Use only meta-networks with source: filters meta-networks which contain the 
source information contained in a separate document file.

On some occasions the display in the Visualizer is too cluttered to make much sense of 
your network model. ORA offers a variety of ways to clean up the display in order to 
make it easier to view your data.

Select one or more transformations to apply. The transformations 
are applied in the order they are Isted. 

□ Symmetrce by method: 

□ Remove Inks lessThon v value: 0.0 

□ Binarize (set link weights to one) 

□ Transpose the given matrix 


The Meta-Network Transform dialog box will appear. It consists of three sections. The 
top section display a dropdown menu with all the currently active Meta-Networks. Use 
this menu to select the Meta-Network. The bottom section has two tabs. The Entire Meta- 
Network contains choices on how to transform the Meta-Networks. The Individual 
Networks tab allows you to select to work on onlyindividual networks. 

35.1 The "Entire Meta-Network" tab 

Remove Isolates 

Removes any isolates* from the selected meta-network. 

Remove Pendants 

Removes any pendants* from the selected meta-network. 


66 































Symmetrize by Method 

Symmetrize turns directed or asymmetric network data into undirected or symmetric data. 
All three methods use a pair of values from the upper and lower portions of the table (e.g. 
cell 1, 3 is compared to cell 3, 1). If a network had a link from A to B but not from B to A 
then symmetrizing the network would create a reciprocal link from B to A. 

• Maximum Compares the values and uses the larger of the values. This is called 
using the strongest value. 

• Minimum Similar to Maximum only it uses the lower, or weaker, value. 

• Average takes the two values and averages them. 

Symmetrize bipartite graphs: 

Symmetrize bipartite graphs* combines networks in the Meta-Network that are 
transposes of each other; for example, if there is an Agent x Location Network and a 
Location x Agent Network, then a single Agent x Location Network is created by 
combining the edges from both Networks. 

This is used to reduce the number of Networks in a Meta-Network when Link 
direction does not matter. 

Remove Links: 

When using weighted links this functions allows for links to be removed from view. You 
can choose form six options for the removal of links.

|lessThan 

■H

greaterThanEquals 

greaterThan 


Binarize (set link weights to one): 

Binarize* takes all links weighted greater than 0 and make them all equal to "1". All links 
will be either 1 or 0. 

Create partition Networks by attribute: 

This partitions the Node Set according to the values of the specified entity attribute and 
then creates a group of new graphs based on the partitioned Meta-Node. This kind of 
grouping is often done in network analysis to understand how some Meta-Nodes are 
embedded in various social roles or how they interact within larger Meta-Nodes. The 
dropdown menu will contain all the attributes in the meta-network. 

Example, if you have an Agent Meta-Node that has a gender attribute for each node that 
takes on values male and female, then using this feature four new Agent x Agent 
Networks would be created that contained links from males to males, males to females, 
females to males, and females to females. No new Meta-Node is created and no data is 
changed. 

Create union matrices 


67 







This creates new graphs that are the union of all graphs of the same type. If the Meta- 
Network had two Agent x Agent Networks, then using this feature would create a new 
Agent x Agent Network which would contain all the links that were present in the 
original two Networks. 

Create a meta-matrix (one matrix with one node class) 

Creates a new Meta-Network with a single NodeClass and a single Network. The nodes 
are prefixed with the name of the nodeCLass they were taken from. 

35.2 The "Individual Networks" tab 

Choose one or more networks to transform by placing a checkmark in the box. If you 
want to exclude a network, remove the checkmark. 

Then select one or more transformations to apply :

directed or symmetric data. All three methods use a pair of values from the upper and 
lower portions of the table (e.g. cell 1, 3 is compared to cell 3, 1) 

Remove links : 

When using weighted links this functions allows for links to be removed from view. You

36 Copy /Paste 

ORA offers multiple options for copying Meta-Networks, NodeSets, and Newtworks. 
Copy/Paste Editor Values: 

The easiest way is to use the Ctrl-C keystroke to copy and the Ctrl-V keystroke to paste. 
A duplicate of the Meta-Network, NodeSet, or Network will appear underneath the 
original. 

Copy / Paste Meta-Network duplicates the selected Meta-Network. 

Copy / Paste NodeSet duplicates the selected NodeSet. 

Copy / Paste Network duplicates the selected Network.

76 

















































42.1 Setting up your environment 

The ORA preferences tool allows you to group Reports and a set of files to open 
automatically thus saving the analyst time when revisiting data reports. 

42.2 Reports 

From this window you can rename and restore report names, export settings for automatic 
loading, and import previously created data sets. Below is the default preference window. 



To rename a report Right-click on the name. A small box will popup, Rename this 
Report. If you wish to rename this report Left-click the box. 


77 

























A dialog box will appear. Enter the name you want to rename the choosen report. 



In this case I chose the name fizzbin. 



To rename the report select OK. The report formerly known as Change in Key Modes is 
now know as fizzbin. 


78 























































Now say you wish you hadn't renamed all those reports cause a name like fizzbin really 
doesn't make much sense. Select the button marker Reset report names. A dialog box will 
appear asking if you want to reset your report names. 

Note: Resetting report names resets ALL report names! 



Now all your reports names are back to their defaults. 


79 







































Now let's say that you know that you don't need ever single report to show up in the 
program. You can set which reports are visible and hidden. By unchecking the box to the 
left of the name the report will be invisible to the program. 



80 































































42.3 Export Settings 


After you've finally decided which reports you want visible (and invisible) and what you 
want all your reports to be called you can save this setting for future reference. So even if 
someone else changes report names or visibility settings you can call your personnel 
setting up and quickly resume your work. 

First select the Export Settings button at the bottom of the dialog box. This will bring up 
a second dialog box. Select OK to confirm this is the action you wish. If not, select the X 
in the top-right corner. 



This will bring up a Save dialog box. Type in the name you want to save your settings at 
and select Save 



So the next time you start up the program and names and settings have been changed you 
can select Import Settings, navigagte to the directory you saved you Settings file and 
have ORA reset the nanmes and visibility settings. 


81 



























Save this file in a place you remember so you can call up your settings quickly. 



82 





































42.4 Data Sets 


This dialog box controls what Networks will load up during startup. There are three 
options. 



42.5 1. Do not load any files at startup 

ORA will start up with no files loaded in panel 1. 

42.6 2. Restore presviously loaded workspace 

Whatever files were loaded (and saved) when you quit the program last will be reloaded 
the next time the program is started. 


83 





















42.7 3. Load specified files below is a little more involved. 

First select the Load specified files below radio button. Then select the Add Files button. 



The Open dialog box will appear. Navigate to the directory of the files you want to 
automatically open. Select one or more files. In order to select more than one file press 
and hold the Ctrl key while selecting multiple files. You will see them appear in the File 
name text field. When you have selected all your files select the Open button. 



84 



















































In the Ora preference dialog box the files you selected will appear under the Add Files 
button. 



If at some time in the future you wish to delete one or more of the files you selected from 
automatically opening up on startup you can clear multiple files form the list. Select one 
or more files (pressing and holding the Ctrl key for multiple files. Then select the OK 
button. 


85 
























You will be prompted to confirm your choice. 



If you selected Yes then the selected files will be removed from the list of files to load at 
startup.

43 CASOS Email Parser (CEMAP) 


CEMAP is an ORA tool that primarily allows you to pull network data in the form of 
emails into ORA. However, the CEMAP tool could be used to convert any sources of 
data in the world into DyNetML, ORA's native file format, for analysis. 

Setting up CEMAP is similar to setting up a new ISP mail client. What follows are 
procedures to configure this tool and how to use it. 

Each email has an identifying number in a long number showing the date, for example: 
[2006030804275 Isl500bii66e]. The 20060308 is in the year/month/day format and says 
this email was sent on March 8, 2006. 

The CASOS Email Parser (CEMAP) that is launched through AutoMap/ORA 
(http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/automap/software.html) enables the extraction of 
different types of network information from emails (e.g. who exchanges information, 
who provides what information, etc.). The following image shows what types of 
information can be extracted with CEMAP. 



Network typel Social network (SN) represents social network data that can be extracted 
from email headers (e.g. agent-agent networks). In Social Nnetworks, entities represent 
people, and edges represent exchanged emails (frequency count). This network type does 
not require any text coding in AutoMap. 

Networks types 2 and 3 are extracted by performing text coding in AutoMap. More 
specifically, Knowledge Networks (KK) represent semantic network or mental models 
that are contained in the bodies of individual emails. In KK, entities represent knowledge 
items, and edges represent the co-occurrence of terms in text. For Meta-Matrix (MM), 
texts are coded in AutoMap according to a taxonomy or ontology (e.g. meta-matrix, 
while are ontologies can be specified by the user). In MM, entities represent instances of 
categories (e.g. agent, knowledge, resources) of the ontology, and edges represent co¬ 
occurrences of terms in texts. 


88 




























Networks types 4 and 5 result from the combination of SN with KK and MM, 
respectively. In type 4, entities represent people and knowledge, and edges represent 
emails and mental models. In type 5, nodes represent the categories of the taxonomy as 
specified by the user, and the edges represent the co-occurrence of the terms that 
represent instances of the taxonomy in the corpus. For the creation of type 4 and 5, the 
extraction of type 2 and 3, respectively, is mandatory. 

CEMAP stores all network data as DyNetML files (a derivate of XML). This data can be 
analyzed with any package that reads DyNetML. We recommend using the ORA 
software for this purpose (http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/ora/index.html). 


89 



43.1 The Top textfields 


• Input File -or- HTTP URL 

Input File -or- HTTP URL - Input Data Set. You specify the email client, inbox type, 

username, and password as semicolon separated values. The location can be either 

file or server (e.g. pop.gmail.com;INBOX;JohnDoe;JohnDoesPassword). 

43.1.1 NOTE : The following information is what is needed to access an 
email account. 

• Server - The IP address or URL of the server. 

• Port - The port on the server to connect to. 

• UserlD - ID of the User. 

• Password - The User's Password for accessing the Mailbox. 

• Mailbox/Folder - The ID of the mailbox to use. 

lip>File Directories 

43.2 The Directory Buttons 

• This section allows the user to dictate where the end files will be written to. 

• Select Output Directory for full document bodies - Directory to save the body of 
the email text. 

• Select Output Directory for document bodies (new content Only) - Directory to 
save body of the email. Discards all the repeat material that is quoted from 
previous emails. 

• Select Output Directory for document bodies (forward content Only) - Directory 
to save Forwarding content. 

• Select Output Directory for SubjectLine Bodies - Directory to save the Subject 
Lines of the email. 

• Select Output Filename for Header Network file - Directory to write a single 
containing the Header. 

43.3 Checkboxes at the bottom 

• Anonymize Agents - Anonymize Agents changes the agents name (only agents) 
to A# (# is a number) in DyNetML. 

• SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) (For IMAP and POP3 only) - Creates a secure 
connection between a client and a server, over which any amount of data can be 
sent securely. 

• De-Dupe Messages - Ignores identical emails. 

The file prefix makes it possible to put all the files in the same directory

The Start Extraction button begins the process. 

43.5 Extraction of network type 1 data: 

1. This network type is needed to perform social network analysis (SNA) based on 
header information only. 

2. In CEMAP, Analysis Type, select the type of your mail box. 

3. In CEMAP, Input Data Set, specify your email client, inbox type, username, and 

password as semicolon separated values, e.g. 

pop.gmail.com;INBOX;JohnDoe;JohnDoesPassword 

4. In CEMAP, Enter Destination Directory for Texts, put in a directory of your 
choice, e.g. C:\textlnput. The email bodies will be stored in AutoMap format (.txt) 
under this directory. Make sure that this directory does exits on your machine. 

5. In CEMAP, Enter Destination File for Network, put in a directory AND filename 
of your choice. The filename extension needs to be .xml. e.g. C:\output\AA.xml. 

6. You are now ready to extract network type 1. In order to do so, press the Start 
Extraction button. As a result, CEMAP will extract network data from the email 
headers (e.g. agent by agent) and store it as one XML file under the directory that 
is specified in the Destination File for Network. 

7. You can pick up the output file and load it into the SNA package of your choice. 

We recommend using the ORA package 

(http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/ora/download.php). 

To extract networks of type 2, perform Semantic Network Analysis in AutoMap. 

To extract networks of type 3, perform Meta-Matrix Text Analysis in AutoMap. 

To extract networks of type 4, merge networks of type one and 2. 

To extract networks of type 5, merge networks of type one and 3. 

CEMAP is a feature in AutoMap that will import email files into AutoMap to analyze the 

text in the emails, such as who exchanges information, who provides what information, 

etc. 

43.6 To use the feature: 

• In the AutoMap menu bar, select Tools => Open CASOS Email Parser (CEMAP). 

• In the ORA menu bar, select File => CEMAP Email-Importer.... 

Once that is selected the CASOS — Email Analyzer window will appear. The 
Email Analyzer window is where you will type in your information of what type 
of network you would like to create while importing your emails. 

43.7 The different types of imports are 

o Full email 

o Header information only 


91 



Forwarded/New emails 
Subject lines only 



43.8 Type Selection 


Select the type of Format your email is in, from the drop down menu. 

o MBOX - A generic term for a family of related file formats used for 
holding collections of electronic mail messages. All messages in an mbox 
mailbox are concatenated and stored as plain text in a single file. The 
beginning of each message is indicated by a line whose first five 
characters are "From" (the so-called "From_ line" or "'From' line") and a 
blank line is appended to the end of each message. For a while, the mbox 
format was popular because text processing tools can be readily used on 
the plain text files used to store the e-mail messages. This is want you see 
when you View Source in a browser. 

o POP3 - (Post Office Protocol) version 3 (POP3) is an application-layer 
Internet standard protocol to retrieve e-mail from a remote server over a 
TCP/IP connection. 

o IMAP - (Internet Message Access Protocol) Is an application layer 
Internet protocol operating on port 143 that allows a local client to access 
e-mail on a remote server. 

o TXT - Exported email files from outlook - will require a Data (file) set 
identifier 

o CasosDB - for internal use only 

o DyNetml - Proprietary format for ORA. 

Once you have selected what type of format you would like to use, click on the 
Start Extraction button. This will begin the process of importing your emails. 


93 



43.9 Examples of POP3 and IMAP setups 


Below are examples of setting up CEMAP with POP or MAP servers. Refer to the 
documentation with a particular server regarding the exact Server, Port, or other 
pertinient information necessary.

44 Data Import Wizard 

ORA's Data Import Wizard allows the importing of files in a variety of File Formats. 

The idea behind the data import wizard is that users come to ORA with a variety of file 
formats from various different network analytical tools. Very rare is it that an analyst has 
a MetaNetwork ready to load. Moreover, network data may exist in a separate file or in a 
variety of file formats, which then need to be merged together. 

The ORA Data Import Wizard makes it easy for the user to take their data in its native 
format and separate files and convert it to a MetaNetwork, which in turn creates a 
DyNetML file. 

The files can be in any of the following formats: CSV, UCINET, GraphML, or Pajek. 
ORA uses the file extension to determine the native file format to assign to your network. 
Therefore, if you change a file extension from its native extension (e.g., GraphML file 
such as "example.gml" to "example.dot" ORA will not recogonize the data format). 

This section will review the basics of the Data Import Wizard. See Creating a Meta¬ 
Network in the Lessons section for more comprehensive information on importing. 

From the Main Menu select File => Data Import Wizard.... This brings up the Import 
Data in ORA dialog box. 



95 













44.1 Primary Uses of the Data Import Wizard 

• Create a meta-network from separate network files: Use this option to select 
multiple networks in one of the several native file formats indicated above and 
pull them into ORA. The file formats don't have to match. ORA will then 
combine all the network files into one MetaNetwork, which will then be saved as 
a DyNetML* file (ORA's native file format). See Lesson 202 — Import into ORA 

• Create a meta-network from table data: Text files in the form of rows of Nodes 
and columns of Attributes will be used to populate existing NodeSets. See Lesson 
202 — Import into ORA 

• Import node attributes from table data: Text files used to import Attributes to a 
Node. See Lesson 202 — Attributes 

44.2 Importing other data formats 

If your file format is in any of the following native specifications, you can simply 
select which one using the appropriate radio button and select Next. 

ORA will pull the network data will create a MetaNetwork based on its 
knowledge of the native file format. The primary benefit here is that it saves you 
time from describing to ORA how your network is formatted (e.g., what is Who, 
what is a connection). The following formats are recognzied by ORA and can be 
imported directly using the Data Import Wizard: 

o AutoMap Thesaurus 
o DyNetML 

o Analyst Notebook - See Lesson 301 — Analyst Notebook 
o GMU Pythia 
o Caesar III 
o Path Finder 
o Trails 
o Thing Finder 
o PenLink

50 Caesar III 

Caesar III is an software application for the design of decision making organizations at 
the operational and tactical levels; it takes into consideration cultural differences in 
coalitions and of adversaries. What follows in overview of how Caesar III and ORA cna 
work together. 

ORA can import data from Caesar III. See the Data Import Wizard for detailed 
instructions. 

The Design View and Analysis View can be generated from a series of matrixes 
describing the communications among decision makers (agents). The goal should be 
producing the matrixes out of a social network. The analysis view has cognition aspects. 
The nature of a link is determined by the timing of communication during the decision 
making process. 


107 































Meta-Networks are generated by ORA. Then through Caesar Ill's Design and Analysis 
Views their structure is analyzed.

Caesar III data. 

51 Command and Control 

51.1 C2 Structure and Meta-Network 

A Meta-network is a representation of a complex adaptive system. 

As such a system it has agents, expertise, resources and tasks. Inherent in this data, Meta¬ 
networks contain the C2 structure of an organization, which are the links of a social 
network among commanders represented in the following ways: 

• Command chains 

• Information sharing relations 

• Result/response sharing relations 

However, meta-networks may only have one commander-to-commander network without 
classifying the nature of links. 

An analyst oftentimes needs a method to infer the nature of relations among commanders 
based on a given meta-network. That is where this tool can help. 

ORA uses the task assignment and communication directions to infer the nature of a link. 


108 



























51.2 C2 structure in CAESAR III 


Design View and Analysis View can be generated from a series of matrixes describing 
the communications among decision makers (agents). The goal should be producing the 
matrixes out of a social network. The analysis view has cognition aspects The nature of a 
link is determined by the timing of communication during the decision making process. 

51.3 Meta-Nework 

Network among people (, knowledge, resources, tasks, etc). Data for statistical analysis, 
not exactly an analysis tool. Reveal the organizational structure, influence propagation, 
command and control structure, etc. Widely used in organizational science, counter¬ 
terrorism, structure reformation, etc. 

51.4 C2 structure extraction in ORA 

ORA provides a function, Command and Control Structure Generator. Automatic 
generation of C2 structure based on a target task and a social network among decision 
makers. Generated influence network is directly loadable in CAESAR III. It is not a 
complete C2 structure but a reasonable inference (or approximation). 

From the main menu select File => Command and Control Structure Generator. This 
brings up the Command and Control Structure Generator Wizard. 



51.5 C2 Structure Generation Procedure 

Determine a target task to analyze. Extract the task network of the target task. Extract the 
related (assigned) agents of the task network. The other agents are aggregated and 
represented as the outside world (IN and OUT). Regard the agent-to-agent network as a 
information sharing network. Determine the network level based on the link directions 
and network topology. Then, extract a command chain from links bridging different 
network level. Determine the result sharing requirement based on the task network (i.e. 
the link direction between the two tasks indicate the result sharing requirement) Then, 
create a result sharing network based on the requirements. 


109 











52 Extracting a Task Network for the Command and Control 


What follows are procedures and an overview of extracting a task network for command 
and control analysis using ORA with Caesar III. 

In a Meta-network, there are event-to-event networks and task-to-task networks 
contained in most data sets. We select one task to analyze and use this ORA tool to 
discover the steps needed for the task in question. 

In the images below, we are extracting a task network needed for the bomb_preparation 
task node. 

The idea is to find tasks should be completed to accomplish the objective, 
bomb_preparation (e.g., find the trace to a purchase_oxygen task. Provide_money —> 
getjnoney —> purchase_oxygen). 



110 




52.1 Assigned Agents 

Identify the task network. Find all the assigned agents. Agents directly linked to a task in 
the task network. 



52.2 Approximated Information Sharing Network 

Just the agent-to-agent network in a meta-network. 



Ill 









52.3 Inferred Command Chain 


Determine the network level. Find the inferred hierarchy of the organization. Find the 
command chain from the hierarchy. 



Upper Network Level 
(Higher Rank) 


Lower Network Level 
(Lower Rank) 


Red arrows are command chains. Purple arrows are social network link s . 



112 









52.4 Inferred Result Sharing Network 

The task network defines the task prerequisites. Then, the result of a task should be 
informed to the agents doing the next task. Create a result sharing network by using the 
above inference rule. 



Ahmed_ghallani should inform the result of purchase_oxygen to the agents doing 
bomb_preparation. Purchase_oxygen is a prerequisite of bomb_preparation.

54.1 Create Erdos-Renyi Network 

A model for generating random graphs by setting an Link between each pair of nodes 
with equal probability, independently of other Links. 


115 





































54.2 Create Core-Periphery Network 

The core-periphery structure of the network has a dense central core of key agents and a 
large periphery of marginal agents. 

The core-periphery structure is an ideal typical pattern that divides both the rows and the 
columns into two classes. One of the blocks on the main diagonal (the core) is a high- 
density block; the other block on the main diagonal (the periphery) is a low-density 
block. The core-periphery model is indifferent to the density of ties in the off-diagonal 
blocks. 

When we apply the core-periphery model to actor-by-actor data (Core/Periphery), the 
model seeks to identify a set of actors who have high density of links among themselves 
(the core) by sharing many events in common, and another set of actors who have very 
low density of ties among themselves (the periphery) by having few events in common. 
Actors in the core are able to coordinate their actions, those in the periphery are not. As a 
consequence, actors in the core are at a structural advantage in exchange relations with 
actors in the periphery. 

54.3 Create Scale-Free Network 

Some nodes act as highly connected hubs (high-degree), although most nodes are of low 
degree. Scale-free networks' structure and dynamics are independent of the system's size 
N, the number of nodes the system has. In other words, a network that is scale-free will 
have the same properties no matter what the number of its entities is. 

Their most distinguishing characteristic is that their degree distribution follows a power 
law relationship, \mathbf{P(k) \sim k A {- \gamma}}, 

P(k) - k -7 , 

Where the probability P(k) that a node in the network connects with k other nodes was 
roughly proportional to k v , and this function gave a roughly good fit to their observed 
data. The coefficient 7may vary approximately from 2 to 3 for most real networks. 

54.4 Create Cellular Network 

54.5 Create Lattice Network 

A Lattice Network is a large-world network 

A graph in where nodes are placed at the integer coordinate points of the n-dimensional 
Euclidean space and each node connects to nodes which are exactly one unit away from 
it. (i.e. if the lattice is two dimensional and the length of the lattice is 2 along the first and 
2 along the second dimension, then it has 4 nodes and they're placed at coordinates (1,1), 
(1,2), (2,1), (2,2)) The two nodes are connected if the difference of one of their 
coordinates is one or minus one and all their other coordinates are exactly the same. 


116 



54.6 Create Small-World Network 


A type of graph in which most nodes are NOT neighbors of one another, but most nodes 
can be reached from every other node by a small number of hops or steps. A small world 
network, where nodes represent people and links connect people that know each other, 
captures the small world phenomenon of strangers being linked by a mutual 
acquaintance. 

The small-world behavior is characterized by the fact that the distance between any two 
inks is of the order of that for a random network and, at the same time, the concept of 
neighborhood is preserved. 

A Small-World Network is a regular network with a degree of random long range 
connections. It is rarely disrupted by the elimination of one node. 

54.7 Fixed Degree-Distribution Network 

A random graph is constructed by specifying as input: (a) the number of nodes in the 
network, and (b) the number of link for each node. The graph is random according to the 
input, however it should be noted that not all degree sequences are illogical so this 
algorithm may produce an empty graph as a result. 

55 Fixed Degree-Distribution Network 

Below are procedures for using ORA's Create Fixed Degree Distribution Network tool. 
This tool creates a random graph constructed by specifying as input: (a) the number of 
nodes in the network, and; (b) the number of links for each node. 

The graph is random according to the input, however it should be noted that not all 
degree sequences are illogical so this algorithm may produce an empty graph as a result. 



The input for the degree sequence is a comma delimited list of the number of edges. 
Correspondingly, the number of nodes is determined by the number of parameters 
entered. 


117 













To facilitate simplified entry, a shortcut can be made by specifying the number of nodes 
at a specific number of edges. Further, the node id in the generated graph will correspond 
with the position in the input string. 

Degree sequences that are illogical will be impossible to generate, e.g., 2@20 (two nodes 
with 20 ties each; impossible because the maximum ties a node can have in this network 
of size two is 1 tie.) Further, some networks can be difficult to produce due to the specific 
degree distribution and the random process used to construct the network, so the 
algorithm is designed to make up to 10 separate attempts at constructing the exact 
distribution. After 10 attempts, the algorithm will return the error meta-network. The user 
may chose to resubmit the same request for another up-to-10 attempts at making the 
network. 

For example, the following are valid input strings (with self-loops off and undirected): 

• 1,5,3,0,1 - produces a 5 node network with one isolate and 2 pendants, etc. 

• 3 @2, 0, 0 - produces a 5 node network with 2 isolates and 3 nodes with 2 edges. 

• 10@5,10@3- will produce a 20 node network 

The following are valid input strings but illogical: 

• 100,0,1 - is illogical and will produce a null meta-network named with an error 
message 

• 3 @2,1 - is illogical and will produce a null meta-network named with an error 
message 

• 10@5,10@3,l-is illogical will produce a null meta-network named with an error 
message 

55.1 Input Fields: 

Allow self-loops: 

Checked : allows the generation of a node tied to itself 
Unchecked : disallows the generation of a node tied to itself 
Construct directed-tie network 

Checked : generates directed network 
Unchecked : generates an undirected network 
If directed is inbound specified, else outbound is specified 
Checked : the degree list is incoming ties 
Unchecked : the degree list is outgoing ties 
Degree list: 

Enter the degree listing - in the desired node order.

56 Generate Networks 


Below is an image of the Generate networks menu, accessible from ORA's main title bar 
menu. Further below are descriptons of the various tools avaiable to Generage Networks. 
This tool is used to generate networks, often stylized networks, according to prefined 
algorithms.

Influence Network Generator 

Used to create an Influence Network file for use in the external program Pythia. 
Command and Control Structure Generator 

Used to create Network files for use in the external program Caesar III. 

Generate Inferred Links 

Uses existing links to infer connections where data is incomplete or missing. For 
instance, if Node A is two paths removed from Node C and Node C is only connected 
to Node B, it could be inferred that Node A has a path to Node B. 

Randomize Existing Networks 

Scrambles the links of a graph. Randomize Networks is run on the same Network 
multiple times in order to help determine is existing Network is random or not. 

Create Stylized Network 

Generates new Networks using various Mathematical formulas including Erdos- 
Reny, Core-Periphery, Scale-Free, Cellular, Lattice, and Small-World Networks. 
Create Expected Interaction Network 

Predicts the expected interaction of a network given known tasks and other available 
network data. 

Construct Trailset 

Used to create a data set to be used within the View Trail Set function. A Trail is a set 
of nodes and links that form a single unbroken chain, such that no node or link is 
repeated. 

57 Influence Network Generator 


119 









This tool takes a meta-network and generates an influence network that is readable by 
Pythia. Pythia (GMU) takes an influence net and reasons about it. ORA can generate 
influence nets for Pythia from meta-networks. ORA can read in a pythia influence net 
and assess its structure. When ORA generates an influence network, the user then has to 
work with Pythia and a SME to get the probability distributions to make sense. Basically 
by inferring the influence network from the meta-network via ORA you save a lot of the 
start up time in building an influence network. 

ORA provides a function, the Influence Network Generation. This function is used in 
conjunction with the external program Pythia. More information about the Pythia 
program can be found at: 

An Influence Network is a hypotheses regarding tasks, performance, event happening, 
and related events. This functions covers how to generate an influence network from a 
social network using ORA and examines the probability of event happenings based on 
the state and influence of supporting nodes. 

The file generated by this function is directly loadable in Pythia. It is not a complete 
influence network and the user will need to make adjustments to the generated networks. 
It uses basic ontological* interpretations and inferred baseline probabilities where the 
user specifies positivie/negative probability. 

We create an influence network based on: Extracting a task network whichdirects the 
target task to analyze. Then examine the complexity, importance, 
personnel/resource/expertise assignment of the tasks. 

The examinations become influence network nodes containing ontological 
interpretation when: The task is done — the task is complex — the task is important 
— there are sufficient actors associated with the task — resouces are available — 
expertise is available. 

Then links are created as in the task network and background hypotheses nodes link 
to a task node. 

57.1 Running the Routine 

From the main menu select File => Influence Network Generator.... This brings up the 
Influence network step by step creation dialog box. There are three options: Task Based, 
Event Based, and Belief Based. This example will follow the Task Based function. Each 
function contains similar step dialog boxes.

58 Extracting a Task Network for the Influence Network Generator 

What follows are procedures to extract a Task Network for the Influence Network 
Generator. 


125 










































In a Meta-Network there is an event-to-event network and a task-to-task network. Choose 
one task to analyze. 



Here we look at bomb preparation. Find the tasks that need completed to accomplish the 
objective. Then trace from provide_money, get_money, purchase_oxygen. 



The complexity of the task depends on three items. Resources / Expertise required and 
number of person required. 

• Very Low (default baseline=1.0): 0 resource/expertise required / 1 person 
required. 


126 






• Low (default baseline=0.9): 1 resource/expertise required / Less than 3 persons 
required. 

• Medium (default baseline=0.8): Less than 4 resource/expertise required / Less 
than 4 persons required. 

• High (default baseline=0.7): Less than 8 resource/expertise required / Less than 7 
persons required. 

• Very High (default baseline=0.6): More than 7 resource/expertise required / More 
than 6 persons required. 



127 



The importance of the task is determined as using standardized degree centrality and 
betweenness (ranging (0—1): 

• Very Low (default baseline=0.4): Not connected to other tasks 

• Low (0.5): Low out-degree density and low betweenness in task network 

• Medium (0.6): Medium out-degree density and low betweenness in task network 

• High (0.7): High out-degree density or medium betweenness in task network 

• Very High (0.8): High out-degree density in task network 



The actor assignment of the task is determines is sufficient actors are associated with the 
task. 

• No personnel (default baseline=0): No assigned actors 

• Insufficient (0.25): Only 75% of resources/expertise are covered by assigned 
actors. 

• Almost sufficient (0.5): More than 75% of resources/expertise are covered by the 
assigned actors. 

• Sufficient (0.7): At most one person associated with each resource and each 
expertise connected to the task. 

• More than sufficient (0.8): More than one person associated with some resources 
and expertise connected to the task. 


128 





Resource / Expertise availability 

Finds if Expertise and Resource are directly accessible. The availability is determined as 
follows: 

• Redundantly available/accessible baseline probability=0.75): More than one 
person with the expertise associated with the task. 

• Available/accessible (0.6): One person with the expertise/resource is associated 
with the task. 

• Unavailable/unaccessible (0.25): No person with the expertise/resource is 
associated with the task. 

59 Pythia 

Pythia is a timed influence net application. Conversely, data from Pythia can be loaded 
into ORA using the Data Import Wizard. 

In conjunction with the Pythia application from George Mason University, data frm ORA 
can be loaded into Pythia to create organizational displays. 

What follows is a brief example of creating an organizational display using ORA with 
Pythia. 

Start from an ORA Task Network (shown below)

60 Randomize Existing Network 

What follows are procedures for randomizing an existing network. 

Note : This is commonly done to test a hypothesis about a given network. If after 
conducting experiments, there is no significant difference between a hypothesis and a 
random graph, the evidence supporting the hypothesis could be weak. 

A random graph* is obtained by starting with a set of n nodes and adding Links between 
them at random. Different random network models produce different probability 
distributions on networks. 

The theory of random networks studies typical properties of random networks, those that 
hold with high probability for networks drawn from a particular distribution. For 
example, we might ask for a given value of n and p what the probability is that G(n,p) is 
connected. In studying such questions, researchers often concentrate on the limit behavior 
of random networks—the values that various probabilities converge to as n grows very 
large. Percolation theory* characterizes the connectedness of random networks, 
especially infinitely large ones. 


131 












































Random networks are widely used in the probabilistic method, where one tries to prove 
the existence of networks with certain properties. The existence of a property on a 
random network implies, via the famous Szemeredi regularity lemma, the existence of 
that property on almost all networks.

Intersect Meta-Network works similar to the Union function and has the same five 
options. But in creating the new Meta-Network only nodes that appear in all Meta- 
Networks are carried over to the new Meta-Network. 

For example: All four agents appear in both Meta-Networks and are brought over into the 
new Meta-Network. But though there were six tasks in the cookingln and three tasks in 
eatingOut there is only one task (driver) in the new Meta-Network created from the 
intersect function. Only nodes found in all Meta-Networks are brought over.

And even though bob has a value for driver in cookingln only carol has a value for driver 
in both Meta-Networks.

Conform Meta-Network alters the selected Meta-Networks and makes them equal, union 
adds nodes that are found in one Meta-Network but not the other, inersect removes nodes 
that are not common to both. 

66 Creating A Network From An Excel Spreadsheet 

If you don't have a Network, you can create one from scratch. Below is step-by-step 
instruction on how to do this in ORA. 

We will create an square, agent-by-agent Network. We say it is square because all row 
headings correspond directly to column headings. This is important as it relates to 
specific measures ORA can run on a graph. If the graph is not square, some measures will 
not work. 

Open a blank Microsoft Excel work book. In column A we will enter the name of all the 
nodes that make up our social network or organization. 

66.1.1 NOTE : When creating your spreadsheet, do not add any additional 
titles, notes, or other headings, which will interfere with the 
"square" properties of the Network. 


n 


C 

D 

E

bob 





3 

carol

ted

alice 






Next, create column headings using the correlating names as they appear in row 
headings. Again, this will ensure that our Network will be square.

ted

a lice 






Next we will create links between each agent. We do this by entering a 1 if a direct 
connection or relationship exists and a 0 if it does not. Please note that headings that 
cross-reference themselves are considered redundant and thus are left blank or 0. 


In the example below, Redundant cells are filled in with red strips to illustrate the self¬ 
loops. This redundancy should continue as a smooth diagonal line from the top left corner 
of your Network to the bottom right. 



66.1.2 NOE : If you don’t end up with a diagonal line then your graph is 
not square. 

Using Is and Os to establish link, complete your spreadsheet. 

In the Network example, we have assigned links randomly. Within your organization or 
network, however, you can describe any direct connections or relationships you are 
interested in analyzing. For instance, you may determine that a direct connection exists if 
agents within your network consult with each other at least once a month; literally, it can 
be anything you decide. 

Below is our completed Network (The red fill illustrates cells that do not require input 
due to their redundancy*). 



Now that we have essentially built a Network from scratch using Excel, the next step is to 
save it in a compatible file format ORA can interpret. For Excel spreadsheets this will be 
the CSV* file format. 

From the main menu select File => Save As 

Make sure you save this file as a CSV (comma delimited) 


147 













































You have now created a Network from scratch which can be loaded into ORA. 


148 



Now return to ORA and load up your new Network. Below is a our new Network 
rendered in the ORA Visualizer. Notice the arrows only point from one node to another if 
there is a 1 in the column for a particular node. i.e. There is a "1" in the bob column for 
ted but a "0" in the ted column for bob. So an arrow points from ted to bob but NOT from 
bob to ted. 



For a more in-depth explanation for creating Meta-Networks see the lessons section 
under Meta-Network. 

67 Find 

67.1 Find a Sub-set within a NodeSet 

What follows are procedures for using the Find feature in ORA. 

By using the Find: textbox and the AND/OR selector you can display only the nodes you 
want to work with. This works by searching for Sub-Strings within the values. 

67.1.1 NOTE : A search for "male" will find all values of "male" as well 
as "female" because "male" is a sub-string of "female". 



149 
















Here is the whole NodeSet with only the gender and race attributes displayed. The 
AND/OR toggle is in it's default AND setting. 



First female is typed into the textbox and ORA will display all nodes where 
gender=female. 


Find: 


female| 


AND v

Next tauri is typed into the textbox (make sure there's a leading "space") and ORA will 
now only display nodes with gender=female and race=tauri. 


Find: Female tauri|

69 Info Tab - Network 


When a Network is selected there are also two tabs, Info and Editor. 

The Info tab contains a textbox, Network ID in which you can change the name of any 
metwork, The Source and Target Nodesets, and whether this network is directed or not, 
the Link Count, and the Density. 

The two buttons underneath allow the choice of Visualize this Network which will send 
the entire Meta-Network to the visualizer or Visualize Only this Network which display 
only the currently selected Network. 

Below is an image of InfoTabs and Editor Tabs in ORA.

The Editor tab has two views: Binary and Numeric. 

Binary view is used when you only need to extablish a connection between two nodes 
with no weights. It’s a simple Yes or No arrangement.

The Numeric view allows you to treat links between various nodes with more or less 
importance. Notice that all the row nodes have a checkmarked connection to the column 
containing [yu] in the binary mode. This denotes they know one another. But in the 
numeric mode this value is a 0.5 which is used to denote previous acknowledgement but 
is an advesary. 



70 Info Tab - NodeSet 

Panel 2 contains two tabs, Info and Editor. The Info tab is mainly designed to display 
information regarding the Meta-Networks, NodeSets, and Networks. But this is the area 
where you can rename the Node Class ID and the Node Class Type. Place the cursor in 
the box, make sure the entire name is highlighted, and type in your new name. 

This area also gives you the Node Count of the selected Node Set as well as the Attribute 
Names contained within the NodeSet.

71 ORA's Main Interface 


The ORA interface is organized into three resizable window panes. 

Panel 1 contains a tree directory of the current Meta-Network(s) loaded into ORA. This 
contains the Meta-Networks currently active plus all their Meta-Nodes and Networks. 
Panel 2 contains the basic information about the highlighted Meta-Network such as how 
many nodes are represented. This panel also allows quick access to ORA's Visualizer, 
Reports and Chart tools. By selecting the Visualize button, the currently loaded Network 
will render in the ORA Visualizer, which will load in a separate window. Panel 3 is 
empty when ORA is first started up. It will contain any reports that you run. 

All three Panels can be resized to your preference. 



156 


































71.1 Panel 1 


Panel 1 contains all the Meta-Networks you currently have active. Clicking on the plus 
icon will expand the Meta-Network showing all the Meta-Nodes and Networks and 
clicking on the minus icon condenses the Meta-Network.

71.6 Panel 3 

Panel 3, which at the start is blank, will contain any reports that are run on the Meta- 
Network. See Generate Reports for more information. 

72 Main Interface Tasks 

There are a number of tasks that are performed from within the Main Interface to assist in 
controlling your Meta-Networks, NodeSets, and Networks. 

These functions are not associated with any of the Menu Items. 

For example, renaming Meta-Network, tool tips displayed while hovering, and creating 
and deleting Nodes & Attributes. 

73 Create a New Meta-Network 

What follows are procedures for creating a new Meta-Network. 

There are times you need to run measures on or visualize only part of an existing Meta- 
Network. This section will show you the easy way to create sub-sets of an existing Meta- 
Network. 

First duplicate the Meta-Network. Highlight the Meta-Network then from the main menu 
select Edit => Copy Meta-Network. Then from the main menu select Edit => Paste Meta- 
Networks. It would be a good idea to rename this new Meta-Network immediately so as 
to not get it comfused with the original. You can do this in the Editor tab, see Renaming. 


159 










































Next, expand the Meta-Network you want by clicking the [+] if it isn't expanded already. 
Highlight the nodeset with the nodes you want to remove.

74 Node Buttons 



What follows are images and descriptions of some common button items and other 
interface elements in the ORA gui. 

74.1 Creating Node 

Highlight a NodeSet where the node is to be added. Click [Create], 



You will be prompted to input the number of new nodes you want to create in the 
NodeSet. Input the number of nodes to add and select [OK] and the new node(s) will 
appear at the bottom of the nodeset. The new node can then be renamed by clicking 
inside the cell. 

74.2 Delete Node 

To delete a node from a NodeSet place a checkmark in the box(es) to the left of the 
node(s) and select [Delete], Select [OK] and all nodes with checkmarks will be deleted 
from the NodeSet. 

74.3 Merge Nodes 

The Merge button combines the links and attributes of the selected nodes and creates a 
merged or combined node. The nodes that were merged are removed, and replaced with 
the combined node. Used primarily when data needs to be consolidated. 

Example: You have two nodes, jack and col_o'neill. These are actually the same 
person. Merge will combine their information into one node which could be named 
colJack_o'neill.

75 Renaming 

75.1 Renaming Meta-Networks, Meta-Nodes, and Networks 

Below are procedures for rename a Meta-Network, Meta-Node, and/or Networks. This 
helps makes the information clearer for you. Below I renamed one of the Meta-Nodes to 
those guys and also renamed the type to who?. You can see how it's reflected throughout 
the entirely of panel 1. So you can rename any Meta-Node in a Meta-Network for better 
readability.

76 Visualize Buttons 

There are two Visualize buttons and they work slightly different. 




Visualize this Network 

*** Visualize Only this Network 





The Visualize this Network visualizes the choosen Network. In the Legend dialog box all 
NodeSets and LinkSets are available.

The Visualize Only this Network visualizes the choosen Network. But in the Legend only 
the NodeSet and LinkSet choosen are displayed. This is a much quicker means to display 
a Network. ORA only makes computations for the choosen Network.

Used to transfer information between Meta-Nodes. The Meta-Nodes created can be 
identically sized (allowing you to paste an entire column in) or a smaller, subset 
allowing you to choose only a portion of the original set. 

Copy Meta-Network / Paste Meta-Network 

Used for quickly creating duplicate Meta-Networks. When you first start the program 
the Paste Meta-Networks is greyed out. It will only become active once you've used 
the Copy Meta-Network menu item.

82 The Charts 


Below are examples of each type of ORA charts: Bar Chart, Scatter Plot, and Histogram. 

82.1 Bar Chart 

A bar chart contains horizontal bars representing the individual nodes in the set. These 
rectangular bars are usually proportional to the magnitudes or frequencies of what they 
represent. 

Bar charts are used for comparing two or more values. The bars can be horizontally or 
vertically oriented. Sometimes a stretched graphic is used instead of a solid bar. 



172 









































82.2 Scatter Plot 


A scatterplot uses Cartesian coordinates to display values for two variables. The data is 
displayed as a collection of points, each having one coordinate on the horizontal axis and 
one on the vertical axis. 

A scatterplot does not specify dependent or independent variables. Either type of variable 
can be plotted on either axis. Scatterplots represent the association (not causation) 
between two variables. 

A scatterplot can show various kinds of relationships, including positive (rising), negative 
(falling), and no relationship. If the pattern of dots slopes from lower left to upper right, it 
suggests a positive correlation between the variables being studied. If the pattern of dots 
slopes from upper left to lower right, it suggests a negative correlation. A line of best fit 
can be drawn in order to study the correlation between the variables. An equation for the 
line of best fit can be computed using the method of linear regression. 


173 




82.3 Histogram 

In statistics, a histogram is a graphical display of tabulated frequencies. A histogram is 
the graphical version of a table which shows what proportion of cases fall into each of 
several or many specified categories. The histogram differs from a bar chart in that it is 
the area of the bar that denotes the value, not the height, a crucial distinction when the 
categories are not of uniform width (Lancaster, 1974). The categories are usually 
specified as non-overlapping intervals of some variable. The categories (bars) must be 
adjacent. 

The word histogram is derived from histos and gramma in Greek, the first meaning web 
or mast and the second meaning drawing, record or writing. A histogram of something is 
thus, etymologically speaking, a drawing of the web of this something.

83 Drill Down 


Below are procedures to trace a path through various nodes in different nodesets using 
ORA's drill down tool. 

DrillDown allows for any path to be followed. 

From the main menu select Data Visualization => Drill-Down Window. 

From the drop down textbox select the node you wish to start with. Here we'll begin with 
daniel Jackson.

contains the proper data. It requires two attributes*: Longitude & Latitude. Also be sure 
your GeoSpatial Network is in the DynetML* format. 

Highlight the MetaNetwork in the main interface then from the main menu select 
Visualization => GeoSpatial Networks.

90 GeoSpatial Network 


The Geospatial Network tool in ORA allows for the plotting of a Meta-Network on a map 
of the globe using longitude and latitude for placing the nodes. 

90.1 Important items to know before using the Geospatial Networks 

1. The Meta-Network MUST contain a location NodeSet AND that NodeSet MUST 
contain longitude and latitude data. 

2. The longitude and latitude use only numbers, not the n, e, s, & w normally 
associated with this terms. To put in a western or souther location, use a negative 
number. 

91 View TrailSet 

View TrailSet is a stand-alone program called up from ORA. Key points to View TrailSet 
are: 

• It always involves both subjects and locations. 

• Unlike a network, subject may revisit location. 

• The time stream is an integral part of the data. 

• Subjects exist at one location at a time (but longer relationship may be implicit in 
repeated visits). 

The Foci of Activity are figuring out where people tend to go and guessing what they do 
there? 

91.1.1 NOTE : Before you can use the View TrailSet function you must 
create a TrailSet 

From the main menu select Data Visualization => View TrailSet 

The Loom Input Chooser will appear which allows you to start Loom with any currently 
active TrailSet listed in the drop down menu. 



185 









After selecting your TrailSet you are presented with the Main Loom window. There are 
three panels to this window. 

1. agent - Clicking in the checkboxes will activate/deavtivate the agents from panel 
3. You can select multiple agents to be displayed simultaneously. 

2. location - List all the locations in the MetaMatrix. 

3. display - This panel holds the currently selected agents and locations. 



186 





































First we'll select two of the agents for display. With both agent's color being a shade of 
blue it could be difficult to distinguish their lines if they were close together. Can you 
really tell which one is Ren'al and which direction she took after the convergence? 



187 

















































You can change the color of any of the active trails. Click on the colored circle to the 
right of the name. This brings up the Choose Trail Color box. For our example we'll 
choose a bright, light color to contrast the dark blue. 



188 









































































































































The trails are then much easier to read. 



Additionally if you Right-click on any of the colored bands in panel 3 an information 
menu will appear with details about that location.

92 View Measures Over Time 


Using the View Measures Over Time on a Network allows an analyst to see how a 
network measures change over multiple time periods. 

In this example three Networks are loaded into ORA.

From the main menu select Data Visualization => View Measures Over Time 
A dialog box will appear stating it will run on the currently loaded Networks. If you have 
any Networks you do not want in the calculation hit [Cancel] and remove them from 
Panel 1 before proceeding. 

Once you have the Networks you wish to work with active, select [OK], 



190 















The View Measures Over Time box will appear. It consists of three sections: 

1. Set Aggregation Level - A slider allowing you to choose between plotting all 
Networks or just the beginning and end points. 

2. The Measures selection tabs - Choosing a particular tab will reveal the measures 
that are capable of being run on that particular node. 

3. The Time / Value charting area - The area in which the plots will be plotted.

Add Node(s): Function for adding Nodes directly into the Visualizer. 
Add Link : Function for adding links directly into the Visualizer. 


Isolates 

Periphery : Moves Isolates back to their original position. 

Hide Isolated Nodes : Remove any node which has zero links connecting it to other 
nodes. 

Combine into MetaNode : Collects all the Isolate nodes into a Meta-Node. 

Move into Column : Moves all isolates to the right side of the screen in a column. The 
isolated nodes can be moved back using the Periphery option. 

Hide Pendant Nodes : Remove any node which has only one edge connecting it to 
another node. 


197 


















Recursively Hide Pendants : This function will run the both the Hide Pendant routine 
until there are no more Pendants. 

Recursively Hide Pendants and Isolates : This function will run both the Hide Pendant 
and Hide Isolate routines until there are no more Pendants or Isolates. 

Show All Nodes: Any nodes that were previously hidden will be revealed. 

Show All Nodes Except Isolates : Reveal any nodes that were previously hidden with the 
exception of nodes that have no links connecting them to another node. 

Set Title : Allows the user to specify a title for the visualizer picture. Useful for creating 
slides that need a labeled picture. The title will appear centered at the top. If you wish to 
remove the title call the function up a second time, leave the textbox blank, and press 
[OK], This will delete the title from the screen. 


Reset Node Colors and Size : If colors and sizes have been changed this option will reset 
them to the defaults. 

Color Nodes by Attribute or Measure : This allows the user to select a node attribute and 
color code the nodes according to its value for the attribute. 

For Attribute: Each node will be colored depending on the value of it's attribute. 

For Measure: The user selects a measure to compute on the visible network and then 
the nodes are colored according to its value for the measure. 

Color Nodes by Component: This computes the components of the visible network and 
then color codes the nodes according to which component it is in. A component is a 
single piece of a network whereby any two nodes in a component are connected by a 
sequence of links. 

Color Nodes by Concor Grouping* : This computes the CONCOR algorithm on the 
visible network and then color codes the nodes according to which CONCOR group it 
belongs. 

CONCOR then divides the data into two sets on the basis of these correlations. Then, 
within each set (if it has more than two actors) the process is repeated. The process 
continues until all actors are separated. The result is a binary branching tree that gives 
rise to a final partition. 

Color Nodes by Newman Grouping* : This computes the Newman algorithm on the 
visible network and then color codes the nodes according to which Newman group it 
belongs. 

Each pair of actors is correlated then each row extracted and correlated with each 
other row. Shows how similar is the vector of similarities of actor X to the vector of 
similarities of actor Y? Repeat this process over and over. The elements are iterated 
correlation matrix converge on a value of either +1 or -1. 

Size Nodes by Attribute or Measure : Allows the user to scale node sizes based on a 
measure or node attribute. Measures are run on the visible network. 

NOTE : All of the operations are on the visible network, that is, whatever nodes and 
edges are currently displayed in the visualizer. 


198 




Compute Standard Measures for Visible Network : Compute Standard measures 
computes the following collection of measures on the visible network: Total Degree 
Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, Eigenvector Centrality, Cognitive Demand, Resource 
Exclusivity, Task Exclusivity, Knowledge Exclusivity. The measure values can then be 
viewed within the Entity Status Window.

96 Add Edge 


IMPORANT NOTE : Changes done using Add Node(s) and Add Link(s) are transient. Be 
sure to use either the File => Save Meta-Network As... (to save the entire Meta-Network 
with additions) or File => Add Meta-Network to Ora (to create a new Meta-Network 
using only the currently visible nodes). Changes can not be saved back to the currently 
open Meta-Network. 



1. Start node : The start of a directed edge. 

2. End node : The end of a directed edge. 

3. Insert Nodes as they're clicked : Fills in the textboxes for Node. The first click 
adds the node in the Start node section. The second click adds the node to the End 
node section. Any further clicks will make the previous End node the start node 
and the newly clicked node becomes the new End node. 

4. Use an Existing network will place the links within the choosen network form the 
dropdown menu and Use a new network creates a new network from the name in 
option 5. 


200 






































5. New Network ID: is the name for the new network from option 4. 

6. Link Weight: The weight to assign the edge between the nodes. 

96.1.1 Since this function creates directed links a second edge would need 
created for reciprocal action. 

Example: If a connexion was made starting with A to B, a second connexion would 
need to be made starting with B to A. 

96.2 Adding a Missed Link 

If after the Meta-Network was constructed and it's noticed an link is missing (e.g. 
janet_frazier should have been connected to gen_hammond), the missing link can be 
added immediately without returning to the editor. 



201 



From the Visualizer menu select Actions => Add Edge(s). 



Be sure that the Insert Nodes as they're clicked has been checkmarked and that Use an 
existing network is selected with the correct network is visible in the dropdown. Then 
select the [Create Edge] button. 



The two nodes are now connected with a directed link. 

96.2.1 NOTE : this created a directional link from janet_frazier to 
gen_hammond but not the other way. To make it go both ways, a 
second link from gen_hammond to janet_frazier would need to be 
created. 


202 

























97 Add Node 


IMPORANT NOTE : Changes done using Add Node(s) and Add Link(s) are transient. Be 
sure to use either the File => Save Meta-Network As... (to save the entire Meta-Network 
with additions) or File => Add Meta-Network to Ora (to create a new Meta-Network 
using only the currently visible nodes). Changes can not be saved back to the currently 
open Meta-Network. 

The Add Node(s) function allows addition of nodes to the current Visualizer. These 
added Nodes are not added to the currently open Meta-Network. If there is a need to save 
the Meta-Network with the added nodes then use the menu item File => Save Meta- 
Network to File... and create a new Meta-Network. 

Below is the NodeSet for Stargate with the original 16 node NodeSet.

From the main menu select. Actions => Add Node(s) which brings up the Add Node(s) 
dialog box. 



1. Use an Existing nodeset: 

allows for for a NodeSet selectable in option 2 or Use a new nodeset creates a 
new empty NodeSet. 

2. This dropdown gives the option for selecing a pre-existing NodeSet to place the 
new node. 

3. The Node ID: textbox is used for giving the new node an ID. 

4. The Number to Create: specifies the number of new nodes. 

NOTE : If the Number to Create is larger than 1 then the text placed in section 3 for 
Node ID will be used as a prefix for all new nodes crated. 

After inputting the information to add node A17, the Visualizer will now display the new 
node as A17 with no connexionx. In order to display this node with a title will require 
saving the Meta-Network and changing the information within the ORA Editor. 


204 














The procedure for adding multiple nodes is similar to adding a single node. The 
exception is the text in the Node ID: textbox. When adding multiple nodes only use a 
prefix. ORA will attach numbers, starting at 1, for each node. 

Here's the addition of three new nodes and the prefix A will be used. Three nodes, A_l, 
A_2, and A_3 are created on screen. 

NOTE : You can only use a prefix ONCE. ORA will not accept any previously used 
prefixes a second time. 



205 


















To add additional nodes use a different prefix. 



NOTE : Now either save the altered Meta-Network using the File => Save Meta-Network 
As... to a new filename or continue with Add Link(s). 

98 Add Nodes and Links in Visualizer 

ORA allows the addition of Nodes and Links directly into the Visualizer to create 
customized Networks on the fly. 

Add Node(s) : allows for the addition of one or more nodes directly into the Visualizer. 
These nodes will initially contain Node IDs only. 

Any titles or attribute settings will be made after the Meta-Network is saved into a new 
file. These nodes can be added to existing NodeSets or completely new NodeSets. 

Add Edge(s): allows for the addition of edges connecting nodes (either previous nodes or 
newly constructed nodes) to enhance, or create, Networks. 


NOTE : Changes done using Add Node(s) and Add Link(s) are transient. Be sure to use 
either the File => Save Meta-Network As... (to save the entire Meta-Network with 
additions) or File => Add Meta-Network to Ora (to create a new Meta-Network using 
only the currently visible nodes). Changes can not be saved back to the currently open 
Meta-Network. 

98.1 The difference between the Save options. 


206 


















Save Meta-Network As... writes a complete set of NodeSets and Networks to the 
DynetML file. If only saves the visible nodes. If none of the nodes of a NodeSet are 
visible, then an empty NodeSet will be saved to the file. 

Add Meta-Network to Ora saves directly into ORA and creates only NodeSets and 
Networks that are currently visible in the Visualizer. 

99 Brand New Network 

This function also allows the creation of Networks from Scratch. First, remove the 
checkmarks from all the NodeSets in the Legend to remove them from the screen.

A03 danielJackson 
A04 teal'c 
A05 gen_hammond 

From the main menu select Actions => Add Node(s). 


207 




In the dialog box activate the Use a new nodeset radio button. Underneath, in the Type: 
dropdown menu, select the type of NodeSet. Then in the New NodeSet ID: textbox give 
it a name. Then select the [Create Node(s)] button. 



The five nodes will appear in the Visualizer with the prefix and attached numbers. Now 
it's time to connect the nodes. 



208 

























From the Visualizer menu select Actions => Add Link(s). 



After selecting [Create Link] a new link will be drawn in the Visualizer. 



209 






































Now switch the NodeSet to use to Use an existing network, select the newly created 
NodeSet in the dropdown, and create the rest of the links. 


® Use an existing network 
(_) Use a new network 


All of the links are now complete. 



Save the Meta-Network with either Save Meta-Network As... or Add Meta-Network to 
Ora and use the ORA editor to add in titles and attributes. 


210 






100 Color Nodes by Attribute 


When the agent-by-agent network is opened all the nodes deafult to the color red. ORA 
has default colors for all the arious NodeSets. But ORA can also color the nodes based on 
their individual attributes. Here's the default agent-by-agent NodeSet in red. 



From the Visualizer main menu select Actions ... Color Nodes by Attribute or Measure. 
This brings up the Node Color Selector dialog box. 



211 














Selecting the down arrow for Select an Attribute:. Highlight an attribute from the list. 
ORA gives default colors to the nodes. 



In some instances the color distinction isn't highly visible. And for presentation purposes 
a good contrast is necessary. 

To bring up the Color Selector click on the color you want to change. 



212 














Select a new color from the swatches. Then select [OK]

101 Compute Standard Measures 


This functions runs four standard measures: 

Cognitive Demand: Cognitive Demand measures the total amount of effort expended by 
each agent to do its tasks. Individuals who are high in cognitive demand value are 
emergent leaders. Removal of these individuals tends to be quite disruptive to networks. 

Centrality, Betweenness: Betweenness tells us which node is the most connected to other 
parts of a network. For example, Betweenness can tell us which person in a network is 
the most central to the network as a whole. Betweenness measures the number of times 
that connections must pass through a single individual to be connected. 

Centrality, Eigenvector : Eigenvector Centrality reflects one's connections to other well- 
connected people. A person connected to many isolated people in an organization will 
have a much lower score in this measure then those that are connected to people that have 
many connections themselves. This would be true even if such a WHO might have a high 
amount of actual connections (i.e. high degree centrality). 

Centrality, Total Degree: Degree Centrality tells us the relative number of direct 
connections a WHO might have in a network; the higher the score the more likely a 
WHO might be likely to receive and potentially pass on critical information that flows 
through the organization. 

These values can be viewed either by hovering over a node and revealing the tooltip or 
double clicking a node and bringing up the Node status dialog and selecting the Measures 
tab.

102Isolates 

102.1 Periphery 

Places isolates that were moved into column back to their original positions. 

102.2 Hide Isolate Nodes 

To further simply a visualization, it may prove useful to remove isolated nodes from the 
visualization. 

Isolated nodes are not directly linked or connected to other nodes, which share direct 
links with each other. In the screen shot below, the red ellipses highlights an isolated 
nodes which need removed. 



Select from the Main Menu: Actions => Hide Isolated Nodes. 

In the screen shot below, after removing isolated nodes, the visualization is further 
simplified. 



102.3 Combine into MetaNode 

This option will combine all the Isolates into one MetaNode. This can be expanded right- 
clicking to bring up the contextual menu. 


215 






102.4 Move into Column 


This function is used to move isolate nodes from the main viewing area to move easily 
view the connected nodes. These will be lined up on the left side of the screen. 

NOTE : The original dataset was changed in order to create the isolates. 

NOTE : If the names are unviewable and off the screen, change the position of the labels 
The isolates can be returned to the original position using the Periphery options. 



103Removing Pendants 

Pendants share links with only one other node. Their linkage is tangential and therefore 
isolated from the core linkages you may be interested in examining. Pendant Nodes, like 
Isolated Nodes, can be removed. 

From the drop down menu in the Visualizer select Tools => Hide Pendant Entities. 

Below is a Before/After screen shot of the visualization before showing the removal of 
the pendant entities.

KMResize Nodes by Attribute 


216 







Resize by Attribute uses the numerical value of an attribute to size the nodes. Sizes will 
be scaled accordingly. Below is an attribute created for this example. 

The numbers range from 0 to 10 and denote approximate rank. 10 denoting general/leader 
down through the ranks to 5 for civilians and finally 0 for persons not involved.

From the main menu select Actions => Size Nodes by Attribute or Measure. Then select 
the attribute to use for the sizing. When finished, select [Close], 

NOTE : Sizing nodes by attributes only works with attributes of numerical content. Alpha 
content will have no affect on the size of the nodes. 



Each node will now be displayed according to the value in the chosen attribute. 

NOTE : The numerals are not displayed in ORA and are shown only for display 
purposes. 



105Resize Nodes by Measure 


218 

















ORA has the capability to visualize nodes by scaling them relative to each other in 
relation to common SNA Measures or Attributes as selected within the ORA Visualizer. 

The key benefit to sizing nodes by Measure or Attribute is the ability to conceptually 
capture which nodes in your network figure more prominently in terms of measures by 
simply gauging their size visually and intuitively. 

First, visualize one of your networks. Below is the Stargate agent x event network to find 
the agent with expertise regarding events in the scenario. 



219 








From the main menu select Actions => Size Nodes by Attribute or Measure. 

From the bottom textbox I selected Cognitive Expertise. Each of the nodes in turn grows 
to reflect it's value from that measure. 



The display now changes to reflect each node's value by size.

108 Comments 


While in the Visualizer Comments can be added to the display. Right-click a node and 
from the contextual menu select Add Comment. The comment is placed in a colored box 
with a dashed arrow connecting them to the original node. 

NOTE : These comments are not saved when exiting the Visualizer. 

NOTE : The main use of these comments would be in creating screenshots for display in 
order to add commentary for a report.

228 










108.2 Adding Multiple Comments 

It is also possible to add multiple comments to the same node. 



108.2.1 REMEMBER: These comments are not saved when exiting 
the Visualizer. 

108.3 Deleting a Comment 


229 











A comment can be deleted by first selecting that comment. A right-click brings up the 
contextual menu. From this menu select Delete Selected Node(s). 

109Node Images 

Nodes can be replaced with various symbols or pictures. There are a few items to note. 

1. All images should be reduced to a maximum of 40 x 40 pixels before using in 
ORA. Bigger images will be reduced to this size and the image quality may be 
degraded. 

2. If a picture is placed on a background with the color R=255, B=0, G-192 the 
background will be changed to the color of the node. 

109.1 Setting a Image Folder 

The Set Picture option is designed with modularity in mind, with adding new images as 
easy as putting a folder with images in the include\OraFiles\images\visualizer\node 
folder. The dialog will automatically read that folder for subfolders, use the subfolder 
names as categories, and the images inside the subfolders as the images for each 
category. 

109.2 Set Picture 

Right-click on any node and select Set Picture from the contextual menu. The Node 
Selector dialog box will appear. The drop down menu contains various types of node 
images. With a node selected a custom image can be applied.

230 















The Custom option allows for the inclusion of a user's own icons. 

The custom category is used for images that have been previously loaded in the current 
meta-network. Clicking OK applies the currently selected node's image to all nodes 
selected in the visualizer. 

Additional information can be found in the Node Shaper section. 

The [New Image] button brings up a navigation box from which to navigate any directory 
and select an image file. The picture types can be jpg/jpeg, gif, or png. These will all be 
collected into the Custom section. 

NOTE : Remember to reduce the picture size BEFORE importing it into ORA. 

To set a new image right-click the node and select Set Picture. This brings up the picture 
dialog box. Locate the appropriate picture and select it. A black border will appear 
around the image. Select [OK] will set the picture to the node.

Ill Creating A Meta-Node 


A Meta-Node contains multiple nodes collapsed into one. You can create Meta-nodes 
based on the nodesets in your organization, or you can create MetaN-nodes based on the 
attributes of the nodes. 

To create Meta-nodes, you must access the Meta-node Manager. There are two ways to 
do this: 

From the drop down menu select Tools => Meta-Nodes of select the Meta-Node Manager 
button on the toolbar. 


* Meta i 

v 

K 




Meta-Node Manager 


And it brings up the Meta-Node dialog box. 



236 












































1. Expand all meta-nodes expands all meta-nodes to their respective single nodes. 

2. Select how to create links between Meta-Nodes: 

o Absolute count of the links : Counts each link from any node in the Meta- 
Node to any other node as 1.0. 
o Proportion of the maximum possible links : 
o Block model links and weights : 

3. Meta-Node Creation is controlled by three buttons: 

o By Node Class : Creates Meta-Nodes based on current NodeSets. 
o By Most Recent Grouping : Creates Meta-Nodes based on the most recent 
use of the Group Viewer . 

o By Attribute... : Creates Meta-Nodes on one individual attribute. 

4. Select an Attribute : ALlows for the selection of the attribute to group on. 

5. Funnel nodes without this attribute : Collects all noes without the above attribute 
and places them into one collective Meta-Node. 

112Meta-Node - Attribute 

This button creates Meta-Nodes using a single attribute. It's used in conjunction with the 
Funnel Nodes checkbox. Below is an image of the Select an attribute box: 


Select an attribute: 

group v 


□ 


Funnel nodes without this attribute 
into a new Metanode 


Choosing group without the Funnel Nodes checked creates a confusing display. 



237 










Next place a checkmark in the Funnel nodes box and select groups for a cleaner display. 


Select an attribute: 

group v 


0 


Funnel nodes without this attribute 
into a new Metanode 



Sgc 


Leaving the Funnel nodes option unchecked works best with fewer NodeSets. Below 
only the agent and tasks NodeSets were used. Without funneling the individual tasks can 
be viewed as to which agent Meta-Node they connect to. It also reveals that groups in 
area 1 are not connected to any tasks and that groups in area 2 are all the agent nodes that 
had no groups affiliation.

USDrill Down Wizard 


With the ORA Drill-Down Wizard you can quickly visualize ego networks by overall 
node class (knowledge, tasks, resources, agents) or by choosing individual nodes from a 
checklist. The ORA Drill-Down Wizard is only accessible through the Visualizer: 

From the ORA Visualizer Main Menu select Tools => Drill Down. 

The following window box will appear. 



The top sections allows you to chose the ndoes for use. The bottom tabs allow for 
choosing specific nodes within a set. 


241 



































116Drill Down Wizard Example 

Using the Embassy Meta-Network, we will render the various node classes using the 
Drill-Down Wizard Tool. The screen shot below displays the Embassy Meta-Network as 
it should first appear in the Visualizer.

Next use the search bar feature of the Drill-Down Wizard to narrow the search. 


Enter the word Bombing in the Visualizer search field below. Then select the check box 
on the bombing row. The screen should now reflect your new search parameters. 
Everything not associated with bombing has been turned off. 


245 



























246 






















117Drill Down Wizard Explained 

The ORA Drill Down Wizard can be broken down into three primary sections of input: 

1. Section 1: enables you choose individual node sets or combination of node sets to 
display in the Visualizer. 

2. Section 2: of the Drill Down Wizard enables you to search for a particular node 
within your Meta-Network. This can be handy when you dealing with large 
nodesets and the one you are interested in finding is not easily located. 

3. Section 3: enables you check mark an individual node within your Meta-Network 
by node class if so desired. 



247 


































118Node Status 


The Node Status Window is used to reveal pertinent information about one selected node. 
The window can be brought up by either selecting it from the main menu, Tools => Node 
status or by double-clicking the node in the visualizer. The dialog box below will appear. 
There are four tabs available which will display the node's information.

119Group Viewer 

The Group Viewer helps separate nodes into distinct groups. 

We'll use one of the networks for each of the groups to further examine the breakdown. 
There are six groupings which can be called up: 

• Clique 

• CONCOR 

• FOG 

• Johnson 

• K-FOG 

• Newman 



250 




























































120Group Viewer-CONCOR 

Below is an image of the Group Viewer window and procedures for using this tool. 



120.1 Parameters 

Use out-links (matrix rows)? The links leading out of the choosen node into another 
node. 

Use in-links (matrix columns)? The links leading into the choosen node from another 
node. 

120.2 Example 

The example uses the network agent x task. Foe each of the three possibilities in, out, 
both the display is shown with the number of groups set to 4. The resulting displays show 
how the in and out links affect the groupings. 


251 





























120.3 Use both in-links and out-links 



120.4 Use in-links

121 Group Viewer-FOG 

Below is an image of the Group Viewer FOG window and procedures for using this tool. 



FOG stands for Fuzzy Overlapping Groups. Individual nodes can have Inks to multiple 
groups at varying strengths. This function shows those multiple links. 

121.1 Parameters 

Select the number of trees per node: 


253 





























Select the tree size: 


121.2 Example 

I used the agent x task network and ran the FOG group viewer on is. Following is the 
progression of groups from 1 to 3 using the parameters in the dialog above. 




254 









• The group at the bottom right consists primarily of the SGC members. 

• The group at the bottom left consists primarily of the Tok-ra and the Tollan. 

• The top group has one singular member and links to three members of the other 
groups. 

Osiris is the only person not belonging to any of the above mentioned groups and the 
function placed her in the group it deemed most fitting.

124Group Viewer-Newman 

Below is an image of the Group Viewer window and procedures for applying the 
Newman grouping algorithm: 



258 





































The Newman grouping is used to find clusters in a network. I began increasing the 
number of groups to view until the larger cluster began to break up. 



In this case the nodes remained clustered (with only one or two nodes breaking off) until 
I reached 4 as the number of groups. Then the network broke up into two large and two 
small clusters. The nodes in each of the two large clusters have a commonality as to the 
organizations they belong to and the tasks they were assigned.

126 Keyset Selector Examples 


Following is a short example of the KeySet Selector. It covers the main aspects of the 
tool only. 



In the Filter Commands textbox the word poison is typed which causes all nodes with 
poison in any attribute to be revealed. Pressing the [Select All] button places a checkmark 
in all the nodes. 


261 



























































Lastly in the Visualizer Commands pressing the [Show Only Checked Items] button 
hides all but the checked items.

poison_summit 

create_poison 


symbiote_poison 

poisonJaffa_at_g 



lantash 
It elliotU 


data_crystal 


symbiote_poison_formula 


The [Clear All] button is pressed to clear all the checkmarks, poison is replaced in the 
Filter Commands with the word sg-1. Be aware that even though only nodes with sg-1 are 
to be added the two nodes with sg-17 also appear as sg-1 is a sub-string of sg-17. SO 
instead of using the [Select All] button checkmarks are manually placed inthe checkboxes 
desired. 


262 




263 


























































The [Add Checked Items] button is pressed and the four new nodes are added to the 
visualizer.

With the four nodes of sg-1 still checkmarked press the [Highlight Checked Items]. The 
four nodes are now displayed in a larger format. 



The last button, [Create Meta-Node] will cull nodes into a Meta-Node. 


264 




127Legend 


The Legend dialog box allows you to quickly hide and reveal nodes and links in the 
visualizer. 

Use the checkboxes to change a NodeSets visibility. When you first call up the Visualizer 
all the boxes will contain checkboxes... 



...and in the Visualizer all nodes and links are revealed. A little hard to make heads or 
tails of something like that.

By using the Legend checkboxes you can selectively show/hide nodes and links. Deselect 
the checkbox to the left of Agent. Instantly all of the Agent nodes are hidden along with 
any connections they had with the rest of the nodes. The node structure is a little easier to 
see now.

Next think about a particular set of connexions you'd like to see, say a task x task 
network and how the agents relate to the tasks.

From the Legend box menu select Control => Hide All nodes Then again from the menu 
Control => Refresh Legend. Now place checkmarks in the checkboxes for agent, task, 
and task x task. All the tasks will be linked together as per your network and all the 
agents will have connexions to the tasks they are associated with. 



Another example is how knowledge relates to specific tasks. From the Legend menu 
select Control => Hide All Nodes. Now place checkmarks next to knowledge, task, and

131Node Shaper 


The Node Shaper allows you to change the size of individual node(s) or assigning 
pictures. Below is an image of the Node Shaper widow and a description of how to 
change the shape of the nodes in your model. 



271 






















































1. Select a Style : Select from three Node Style Sizes or use an image in it place of 
the node. 

2. Select a Shape : An optional shape can be used instead of the NodeSet's default 
shape. The node will retain it's default NodeSet color. 

3. Select Node to Re-Shape : The bottom section contains the controls for selecting 
which nodes to work with. Typing anything in the Find textbox will automatically 
filter out non-matching nodes. 

4. NodeSet tabs : Select which NodeSets to view. ALL shows every node or the tabs 
will show only their individual NodeSets. 

5. Checkboxes : Place a checkmark in the box next to the nodes you want to change. 

6. Filters : Use for filtering based on individual attributes. You can filter on more 
than one attribute at at time. An example can be found in Create a new Meta- 
Network 

7. Select/Clear All buttons : Will either Select or Clear all VISIBILE nodes. If a 
checkmarked node has been filtered out and is currently NOT visible when the 
Clear All button is pressed, then that node will retain it's checkmark and be 
affected by future changes. 

8. Apply/Load Changes : After any changes have been made to the top portions 
selecting the [Apply Changes] buttons will cause them to be dsplayed int he 
Visualizer. 

9. Close: 

132Node Shaper Examples (using images) 

132.1 Original agent x agent Network 

Below is the agent x agent network in the normal medium sized nodes. 

We will proceed to change the shape of the nodes to varrying sizes as well as add image 
and picture icons to the nodes. 


272 




By using the Find textbox and the Filters I placed checkmarks in all members of the 
SGC. Then the Large Node Style was selected the the the [Apply Changes] button was 
pressed. 



273 




















132.3 Picture Replacement 


Here three different symbols were used to denote 1) the SG-1 team (the blue circles), 2) 
the SG-17 team (the green circles), and 3) the SGC who are not members of either team. 
This was accomplished by filtering which group was to be displayed. Then chekcmarks 
were palced and Image Node Style was selected. Then for each group an individual 
picture was applied to all the selected nodes ogether.

Lastly is the ability to assign a picture of the actual person the node represents (or 
location, object, etc.). 

132.3.1 NOTE : It’s suggested that any picture to be used should be 
reduced to a maximum of 40 x 40 pixels before importing as this is 
the size ORA will reduce it automatically. 


274 




133How the Node Shaper Changes the NodeSet 


What follows are examples of how the Node Shaper changes the NodeSet. 

Whenever the Node Shaper is called and a node is assigned something other than it's 
default shape new attributes will be added to Every NodeSet, not just the NodeSet you're 
working with. 


• Drawing Type : This will define what type of node is to be drawn, shape of 
image. There are three options for size (small, medium, and large) and one option 
for image. 

• Nodes Shape : There are four large shapes (circle, rectangle, ellipse, and 
hexagon), eight medium shapes (circle, hexagon, downtriangle, pentagon, 
diamond, square, uptriangle, and octagon), and one small shape. 

• Image : Contains the name of the file associated with that node. 


Changing one node will create these three attributes and place the default value in every 
node in every NodeSet. Any of these attributes can be manually changed from within the 
Main Interface Editor. 


275 










This is useful if you have changed many nodes and want to restore them all to their 
defaults quickly and easily. The quickest way is using the Copy and Paste method.

Column "1" contains the modified values. In column "2" three values of medium are 
highlighted and copied using Ctrl-C. In column "3" the cursor is moved to the top cell 
and Ctrl-V is used to paste those three values in. In column "4" this is repeated until all 
values are back to their defaults. 

If the Image attribute contained a filename then changing Drawing Type to image will 
relink that file to the picture. Any of the four Drawing Type values can be placed in this 
column.

134View Networks OverTime 


The Networks Over Time loads multiple Meta-Networks into the Visualizer and displays 
them as Time Slices. What follows are procedures to do this: 

First, highlight the Meta-Networks to load into the Visualizer. For this example I divided 
the whole Stargate Summit network into four disinct phases. 1) The meetings; 2) What 
was supposed to happen; 3) What did happen; 4) The attack on the Tok'ra homeworld. 
These are Summit 1-4.

The diklog box appears for you to verify you've choosen the correct Meta-Networks. 
Place a checkbox in the ones you want or Check All. Then select [View], 



277 


























To control the Over Time function from the main menu, select Tools => Networks Over 
Time. 



The Phase Duration has two controls. Transition Phase duration sets the amount of time 
in milliseconds for the fading out of the previous set and the fading in of the new set. The 
Display Phase duration sets the amount of time in milliseconds that a set will be 
displayed before moving to the next set. 

Constant maintains a node's position throughout all Timeslices. Determined by Timeslice 
allows you to move a node independently in each Timeslice. 

Record Node Locations upon Exiting a Meta-Network maintains a node's position when 
changing Timeslices. NOTE: It does not maintain the node's positions after you exit the 
Visualizer. Upon returning to the Visualizer all nodes will be in default positions. 

The Slider bar controls which Timeslice is displayed. The buttons at the botton, [Play] 
and [Stop] control the motion display.

136 Sphere of Influence 


Each node within a network has a unique Sphere of Influence or Ego Network. 
Essentially it's a direct relationship with it's neighbors as a function of specified path 
length. The ORA Visualizer allows you to focus on this relationship by creating an Ego 
Map centered on any particular node you choose. 

From the Visualizer's Main Menu select Tools => Sphere of Influence. 

The following dialog box will then appear. From here you can select the Size of your 
sphere's influence, the nodeSets, and Key Sets to use. 



285 










































136.1 Select a sphere of influence radius 

The drop down box allows you to choose the path length for a particular node(s). The 
value starts out at 0. Below is an example of a radius of 0, 1, 2, and 3. In many other 
cases the links will branch out as you increase the radius. 



Auto-Zoom : Maximizes your ego network within the Visualizer. 

Auto-Center : Keeps the visualized Ego Network centered within the visualizer display. 
Hide connections between levels : Removes any connections between nodes that do not 
have a connection to any node in the filter.

Filter Commands : Used for selecting the filters to use on the current visualization. 

Node selection table : Allows the selection of individual nodes for visualization. First 
selected is symbiote_poison in the botom table. Then the NodeSets events and locations 
were added. Only the nodes that are linked to the original symbiote_poison are displayed 
in the visualizer. 


286 







136.2 A Sphere of Influence Example 

This example will show how to take one node and expand upon it to show how it is 
related to nodes in other nodesets. First, from the table at the bottom, select a node. Here 
we select the symbiote_poison. From the Expands only these nodes: place a checkmark in 
location. It reveals that symbiote_poison is connected to two locations, revenna and 
hasaraSystem_spaceStation.

Expands only these entities:

Next we'll place a checkmark next to tasks:. This reveals that there are two tasks that 
relate directly to symbiote_poison, poison Jaffa_at_gate and poison_summit. 



257 














































Now that we've got a couple of nodes on the screen let's increase the radius of the sphere 
to 2. The tree will now display all nodes within 2 links of symbiote_poison.

Lastly you can eliminate any nodesets by removing them from the list. Remove the 
checkmark from tasks: to reveal only the locations up to two links away. 



The Sphere of Influence allows you to hone your search and show only the nodesyou 
need to see.

137Visualizer Tools 


The ORA Visualizer provides a suite of tools to visually analyze your Meta-Network: 


Tools 


Layouts 


Options 


Drill Down 
Node Status 
Group Viewer 
Key Set Selector 
Legend 
Meta-Nodes 
Path Finder 
Sphere of Influence 
Block Maps 
Networks Over Time 
Node Shaper 
Vector Maps 


Drill Down 

With the ORA Drill-Down Wizard you can quickly visualize ego networks by overall 
node class knowledge, tasks, resources, agents) or by choosing individual nodes from 
a checklist. The ORA Drill-Down Wizard is only accessible through the Visualizer: 
Node Status 

The Node Status Window is selected by default. It first pops-up when you select any 
node in the Visualizer. This window provides you with a snapshot of the currently 
selected node by displaying that nodes unique Attributes, Measures, and Neighbors. 
Group Viewer 

Allows viewing of current display to be viewed in various grouping: CONCOR, 
Newman, Johnson, FOG, and K-FOG 
Key Set Selector 

Helps put a set of arbitrary items on the screen. 

Legend 

Allows for toggling visibility of nodex and links on the fly. 

Meta-Nodes 

A Meta-Node contains multiple nodes collapsed into one. You can create Meta-Nodes 
based on the NodeSets in your organization, or you can create Meta-Nodes based on 
the attributes of the nodes. To create Meta-Nodes, you must access the Meta-Node 
Manager. 

Path Finder 

The Path Finder allows you to focus or drill down on a particular node, or multiple 
nodes, that you may be interested in analyzing in greater detail. 

Sphere of Influence 


289 







Each node within a network has a unique Sphere of Influence or Ego Network, 
essentially it's direct relationship with it's neighbors as a function of specified path 
length. 


290 



Block Maps 

Block Maps display varrying intensities of data by displaying "blocks" correlating to 
the value of data. For instance, a block map displaying node centrality values would 
reserve the largest block for the node highest in that value. Color is used to as well to 
visualize different values with the the darkest color reserved for the highest value. 
Block Maps can also be referred to as heat maps. 

Networks Over Time 

Allows you to view a version of your network across multiple time periods. 

Node Shaper 

Allows the altering of nodes on an individual basis including shape, size, and image 
changes. 

Vector Maps 


138Hide Links With Weight 


ORA can visualize your network with only the more weighted links displayed. Below are 
procedures to accomplish this task. 

You can select to hide links either Less Than or Greater Than a certain value. Below is an 
agent x location network. And there are three tooltips displayed for jacob_carter for the 
values of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. We'll keep the hiding style as Less Than. 


,gen_hammond 


hasaraSystem_spaceStation 
cargoShip_spaceStation 



From jacob_carter_selmak 
To hasara5ystem_space5tation 

Weight (double) = 1,0 


From jacob_carter_selmak 
To yu_homeworld 

Weight (double) = 3.0 


cargoShipJokYa 


l aldwin 


: rom jacob_carter_selmak 
To revanna 

Weight (double) = 2.0 


291 



















First we'll increase the value to 1.1 hiding all lower values. The link to the 
hasaraSystem_spaceStation is removed from view. The others, however are still on the 
screen. 


janet_frazier< 

eal'c* earth

Now let's increase the value to 2.1. This removes the link from jacob_carter to revenna.

Weight (double) =1.0 

From jacob_carter_selmak 
To yu_homeworld 

Weight (double) = 3.0 


If we increases to value to 3.1 then all of the links would be removed. 

In this way you can remove links which are of lesser important to concentrate on a 
smaller set of data. 


292 


































139Hyperbolic View 

The Hyperbolic function creates a bulge within your visualization adding a sense of 
depth. By moving the slider from right to left, you can increase or decrease this bulge 
effect and create different depth-added views. By moving the network around the 
window you can create the view you need. The Hyperbolic radio button and slider can be 
found at the bottom of the window. 

This tool is useful when nodes may be very tight on screen such as the ones in the 
following images. Using the Hyperbolic tool you can help space them out for easier 
viewing. Here is how to do so: 


I 1 ' ’ Zoom: -6 ( (•' iHypartdfe JO j3a entities, 1258 edges 


139.1.1.1 Note : The Hyperbolic function, when selected, converts 
the slider to this feature. This is also true of using the zoom 
and rotate functions. Use all three in conjunction to get your 
visualization just the way you want it. Scroll down below this 
screen shot for another when viewed with the Hyperbolic 
feature.

Select the Hyperbolic tool and move the slider to the right. Then click-and-hold on some 
part of the white background and move the entire network to the left. You will notice the 
space between the nodes begins to increase the closer them come to the center of the 
screen.

Now the nodes are able to be read much easier. 

139.1.1.2 Note : It is useful to use this tool in conjunction with the 
Rotate and Magnify tools to obtain just the view you desire. 


294 



140 Show / Hide Labels 


Node labels, which often prove helpful in describing Networks, can sometimes clutter a 
visualization. Thus, it may be necessary to eliminate labels from your visualization. 

The following procedure will help clarify the screen when it is clouded by the many 
labels: 

140.1.1 To remove labels go to Visualizer tool bar and find the Show 
Labels button.

10 C Node Sc* 

11 C Edge Width 3 5 C +& £ 



Hide Edges wthWestftf: Less Than v 0.0 2 


This initial screen shot shows the visualizer with all the labels. 



When you click the Label button on the Visualizer tool bar ORA toggles the labels on 
and off. Note that now a much more clearer conceptual picture of the network is 
produced. You can flip between the two views. 


295 







141 Removing nodes In The Visualizer 

You can remove nodes directly from the ORA Visualizer by right clicking on a node and 
selecting Hide Node. Below is an example of removing an node using the Hide Node 
tool. 

Find the node you want to hide. Here we will hide ren'al. 



Place the cursor over the node and right-click on the node to bring up the contextual 
menu. Highlight Hide node. gen_hammond and the four task nodes are now separated 
from the rest of the network. 



296 







142Rotating A Visualization 

You can rotate a visualization with the slider bar at the bottom of the interface or from 
the tool bar at the top. To do this from the slide bar, click the rotate option toward the 
bottom of the interface. This activates the rotate feature. 

As you move the slider from the left to right, your visualization will rotate 
correspondingly. From the tool bar, you can click inside the rotate icon, which will turn 
the visualization depending on exactly where you clicked. 

In the screen shot below, the yellow ellipses highlight where to access ORA's rotate tool 
both at the bottom and top of the visualizer interface. 

Note : Use the rotate feature in tandem with the magnifying glass to find a visualization's 
maximum screen size. 



297 











143 The Tool Bar Explained 


This section explains the function of each of the toolbar's buttons. 

When you first load a Meta-Network you will see the pause button depressed in the 
Visualizer tool bar. You can layout the Meta-Network by clicking the play button. 

The visualization will space apart across the screen. This is called laying out a Network. 
The Visualizer is separating nodes and links that, at first, appear on top of each other. 

You can pause this process again when you think the Meta-Network is satisfactorily 
spaced apart or you can let ORA lay out the entire Meta-Network. Your computer speed, 
as well as the complexity of Meta-Network, will determine how long this takes. 

143.1 Copy Paste 



The Copy Paste feature allows you quickly capture a visualization and save it to be 
pasted into another document later. 

143.2 Play / Pause 


► II 


The Play Pause function works very similar to the play pause feature on any device. The 
pause button (two vertical bars) is depressed, the Visualizer stops laying out a Meta- 
Network. When the play button is depressed (right pointed triangle) ORA Visualizer 
begins laying out the Meta-Network as described above. The red ellipse highlights on the 
tool bar where this feature is located and accessible. 

143.3 Magnifying / Maximizin g 



The Magnifying Glass icon with the plus sign inside it, allows you to instantly fill the 
Visualizer window pane with the currently rendered Meta-Network. The red circle in the 
screen shot above highlights where to access this feature on the Visualizer tool bar. 

If there are any nodes off screen, clicking the button once will bring all the nodes into 
view on the screen. 

NOTE : This function works well when selecting a small part of your overall Meta- 
Network and magnifying it to fill the visualizer screen.

143.4 Rotating The Visualization 

See also Rotating a Visualization 


Rotate 



To Rotate your visualization look for the word next to the Noon-pointing sundial icon in 
the tool bar. This feature is another way to manipulate your visualization to fill the entire 
visualizer window pane. 

NOTE : Use this feature in conjunction with the magnifying glass function to work your 
visualization into largest size possible.

This allows you to change the size of the font to suit you needs for each individual 
visualizer set. It ranges from 4, which is almost unreadable, to extremely large numbers, 
which can also be unreadable by virtual of overcrowding. So pick the size of font that 
best suits your screen.

The Node Size allows for changing the node size, larger or smaller by increments of one. 
Four is the smallest size possible and creates a very small, almost indisguishable dot. As 
the number increases is becomes easier to see the indivdual nodes until the number gets 
to a point where is can simply overpower the screen. But this gives you the ability to 
customize the entity size to suit your needs.

Use the Hide Links with Weight to select which links to display. As long as there are 
links with different values you can hide links of smaller values leaving only the more 
important links visible. This can assist in seeing links that might normally be too 
cluttered to view. Below left is a Meta-Network with all links in view. Below right is the 
same Meta-Network with links less than 2.0 hidden.

144 Zooming 

At the bottom of the Visualizer interface is a sliding zoom bar (image below). 
You can drag the scrollbar left (to zoom out) or right (to zoom in). 



In the screenshot below the zoombar has been set to the far left, the absolute zoom out 
possible. At this point very little is distinguishable. 



303 






In the next shot the zoombar has been placed almost to the far right, absolute zoom in. It 
allows for extreme closeups of various parts of the Meta-Network. 



Note : Clicking on the Magnifying glass in the Visualizer tool bar will set the view to 
include all visible nodes. 


304 



145FOG — Fuzzy Overlapping Groups 


The ORA Visualizer can locate FOG Groups (Fuzzy Overlapping Groups) within your 
MetaMatrix. To access the ORA Compute Fog Groups you must first be working in the 
Visualizer. 

FOG indicates that nodes can belong to more than one groups in varying strengths and 
that there is a likelihood that those nodes will participate in events associated with the 
groups it is connected to. 

You will be presented with the normal visualizer display. 

Before you start it is a good idea to Show link Weights. This will assist you in seeing 
more clearly the strength of the connections from each node to each group. 

From the Visualizer menu select Option => Show link Weights 
From the Visualizer menu select Tools => Group Viewer

After the Group Viewer appears select FOG form the drop-down menu. Then select the 
[Compute] button. 



305 




















The display starts out with all agents connected to one single group. You'll notice that 
some links are weighted heavier than others. 



Under Select a number of groups to see: increase the number to 2 groups. For this 
example let's concentrate on ali_mohamed. At 2 groups he is connected to both of them. 
Thusly he still has contact with the entire network. His connection with the group on the 
left is stronger than his connection to the group on the right. 



Select a number of groups to see:

ibalfan mohjm«d 


1j2ut_mohjmm«d

Now let’s increase the display to 3 groups. ali_mohamed is still connected to 2 groups but 
there is a third group he is not connected to.

After an increase to 4 groups you can see that ali_mohamed is still connected to bascially 
the same people as before but the grouping is again changed and ali_mohamed is 
connected to 3 of the 4 groups. You'll notice that the strength of the link to the group in 
the lower left is the strongest connection and he has no connection to the group in the 
lower right.

IMPORTANT! 


After you run the the FOG Group viewer there are Node Sets and Graphs that are created 
in the Matrix. These will be displayed in any future work in the Visuzlizer. If you do not 
need them after you are done with the Group Viewer then don't forget to delete them. 
Deleting the Node Set for the FOG group will delete any associated Graph.

148The ORA Visualizer 


The ORA Visualizer renders a Meta-Network graphically. It allows you to interact with 
your data in a variety of ways: remove key actors, isolate certain links, or focus on any 
particular relationship by using tools such as the Path Finder and grouping algorithms. 
Below is a visualized Meta-Network of the Stargate Summit/Last Stand dataset. In this 
view all nodes and links are visualized.

With the tools in the Visualizer you can pick the exact nodes and links you wish to 
visualize. 

149Visualizer Contextual Menus 

Most of the functions you'll need in the Visualizer are accessible from ORA's in ORA's 
contextual menu by right-clicking on any of the entities inside a visualization. 

Below is an image of the contextual menu that appears when you right-click a node in the 
Visualizer: 


Select Node 
Hide Node(s) 

Center Node 
Pin Node

313 










Select Node 

Select Node highlights the selected node. Selecting a node a second time un¬ 
highlights it. 

Hide Node 

Hide Node removes the selected node (along with all links) from view in the 
Visualizer. 

Center Node 

Brings the node to the center of the visualizer. 

Pin Node 

Works as a toggle in pinning and unpinning a node. While a node is pinned it is 
unaffected when the [Play] button is pressed or the user moves other nodes around the 
screen. Allows for the creation of a more understandable screen display. 

Expand Node 

Shows all nodes and links connected to the selected node. 

Set Picture 

Combine into Meta-Node 

Multiple nodes can be selected and combined into a Meta-Node which will contain 
links to all the nodes that the individual nodes had. The four large circles of SG-1 are 
selected. The and green circles show which tasks are associated with these agents. 
Press, and hold, the Control key while selecting each node for the Meta-Node. Then 
without releasing the Control key, right-click one of the nodes to bring up the 
contextual menu. Select Combine into Meta-Node. 



314 




After combining the task nodes that were linked to the individual nodes are now linked to 
the sg-1 Meta-Node. 



149.1.1 NOTE : If additions or deletions of NodeSets needs done 
expand the Meta-Node before proceeding. 

Add Comment 



Attaches a comment to the currently selected node. Good for making notes for display 
purposes. 


315 





















Delete Selected Node(s) 

Allows for the deletion of nodes form a Meta-Network from within the Visualizer.

After choosing Reports, the following pop-up window will appear. Select the network 
you are interested in Charting and select the [Next] button. For this example, we will 
simply select the currently loaded network Agents. ORA produces the following Bar 
Chart, displayed in the screen shot below. 



By now, you should be able to access ORA Charts by loading a MetaNetwork by either 
using the [Charts] button in the MetaNetwork Composer window pane or from the Main 
Menu of the main interface. See Chart Types Explained for more detailed information 
about the four chart types. 


319 
















151.2 Chart Types Explained 


Below are examples of each type of ORA charts: Bar Chart, Scatter Plot, and Histogram. 

151.3 ORA Bar Chart 

A bar chart, also known as a bar graph, is a chart with rectangular bars of lengths usually 
proportional to the magnitudes or frequencies of what they represent. Bar charts are used 
for comparing two or more values. The bars can be horizontally or vertically oriented. 
Sometimes a stretched graphic is used instead of a solid bar. 


320 



























151.4 Scatter Plot 

A scatterplot, scatter diagram or scatter graph is a chart that uses Cartesian coordinates to 
display values for two variables. The data is displayed as a collection of points, each 
having one coordinate on the horizontal axis and one on the vertical axis. 

A scatterplot does not specify dependent or independent variables. Either type of variable 
can be plotted on either axis. Scatterplots represent the association (not causation) 
between two variables. 

A scatterplot can show various kinds of relationships, including positive (rising), negative 
(falling), and no relationship. If the pattern of dots slopes from lower left to upper right, it 
suggests a positive correlation between the variables being studied. If the pattern of dots 
slopes from upper left to lower right, it suggests a negative correlation. A line of best fit 
can be drawn in order to study the correlation between the variables. An equation for the 
line of best fit can be computed using the method of linear regression. 


321 



























151.5 Histogram 

The word histogram is derived from histos and gramma in Greek, the first meaning web 
or mast and the second meaning a drawing, record or writing. A histogram of something 
is thus, etymologically speaking, a drawing of the web of this something. 

In statistics, a histogram is a graphical display of tabulated frequencies. Moreover, a 
histogram is the graphical version of a table which shows what proportion of cases fall 
into each of several or many specified categories. 

The histogram differs from a bar chart in that it is the area of the bar that denotes the 
value, not the height, a crucial distinction when the categories are not of uniform width 
(Lancaster, 1974). The categories are usually specified as non-overlapping intervals of 
some variable. The categories (bars) must be adjacent. 


322 


























323 

















1520ver-Time Viewer 


The Over-Time Viewer enables you to study changes within your organization or 
network over a time period. For instance, the overall centrality value of your network can 
be analyzed as it relates to network data compiled over the years, say, 2000, 2001, 2002. 
Please note that the time interval is dependent only on your data collection samples. Such 
an analysis can then be compared to external or internal events. 

As an example, let us say you are interested in learning how the events of September 11, 
2001 affected a terrorist organization or how the passing of anti-terrorism legislation 
impacted the same network. In either case, you can run measures in the Over Time 
Viewer on your network samples (loaded as multiple MetaNetworks) then compare the 
results against such external events. 

152.1.1.1 There are three lessons showing the functions of the 
Overtime Viewer. 

1. Lesson 5: Overtime Viewer 

2. Lesson 6: Immediate Impact 

3. Lesson 7: Near Term Impact Analysis

155Measures 

1560RA Measures 

ORA contains well over 100 measures. A measure is a function that takes as input a 
Meta-Network and outputs a single value or a vector of values. Consider the measure 
Density. The output for this measure is a single number used to analyze an organization. 
By default, all measures are run on a Meta-Network. To view which measures are 
available, go to the Tools menu and select the Measures Manager.

The Measures Manager dialog box will appear. A drop down box displays the measures 
in ORA. 



325 
































































The Measures Manager categorizes measures in the following ways: Entity Level, Graph 
Level, and Risk Category. 

An Entity Level Measure is one that is defined for, and gives a value for, each entity in a 
network. If there are x nodes in a network, then the metric is calculated x times, once 
each for each node. Examples are Degree Centrality, Betweenness, and Cognitive 
Demand. 

A Graph Level Measure is one that is defined for, and gives a value for, the network as a 
whole. The metric is calculated once for the network. Examples are Centralization, Graph 
Hierarchy, and the maximum or average Betweenness. 

Some reports use a predefined set of measures, and these are not affected by the Measure 
Manager selections (for example, the Intel, Context, Located SubGroups, Sphere of 
Influence, and Immediate Impact reports). The Risk Report, however, uses only the 
measures selected in the Measure Manager. 

The following sets of entities (with their abbreviated symbol) are used throughout the 
document: Agent (A), Knowledge (K), Resource (R), and Task (T). The following 
networks defined on these entity sets are used throughout the documentation.

156.1 Input: 





This lists each of the Networks that are required as input to the measure. If a measure 
takes as input a specific network from the Meta-Network, such as the Agent x 
Knowledge (AK) matrix, then it is listed. If the measure runs on any square (unimodal) 
network then N is given. A measure can require more than one input matrix. 

a. Each input matrix can have one or more of the following requirements: 
i. square: the matrix must have the same number of rows as columns

ii. binary: it must be binary data (i.e. any Inks in the network are assumed to 
have a weight of one) 

iii. symmetric: the network must be undirected 

b. ORA does the following when a network does not meet one or more of the above 
requirements: 

i. square: measure is not computed 

ii. binary: measure is computed, and edge weights are ignored (all edges are 
given value one) 

iii. symmetric: measure is computed, and the matrix is first symmetrized 
using the union method 

A complete list of all measures available in ORA, along with references, input and output 
specifications, can be found in the following Ora Measures sections. 

157Access Index: Knowledge and Resource 

The average shortest path length between entities, excluding infinite distances. 

The Boolean value is true if a particular agent is the only agent who knows a piece of 
knowledge and who is known by exactly one other agent. The one agent known also has 
its KAI set to one.

OUTPUT: £ [0,1] 

Let d = the Column degree vector of the network N 
Then, the Column Breadth of N is:

NOTE: Row breadth is identical, except that d is defined using the row degree, rather 
than the column degree. 

163 Capability 

This computes the number of connections for each entity. Then scales the value based on 
the variation from the average degree 
TYPE: Entity Level 
INPUT: N: square, binary 

OUTPUT: ^ e [0i] 

Let RD = the vector of row degrees for each entity in the network. Scale RD by dividing 
each element by the largest value in RD. 

Then the Capability of node i is:

Note that for the most connected entity, this value tends to 1.0, for the least connected 
node it tends to 0, and for the average connected entity it tends to 0.5. 


330 



164 Centrality, Betweenness 

Betweenness tells us which node is the most connected to other parts of a network. For 
example, Betweenness can tell us which person in a network is the most central to the 
network as a whole. Betweenness measures the number of times that connections must 
pass through a single individual to be connected. 

This measure indicates the extent that an individual is a “broker of indirect connections” 
among all others in network. One might say someone with high Betweenness is a 
gatekeeper of information flow. People that occur on many shortest paths among other 
People have highest Betweenness value. Betweenness is one of the key measures used by 
those interested in networks. 

Freeman, 1979

331 



165 Centrality, Bonacich Power 


The Bonacich Power Centrality computes the centrality of each entity based on the 
centrality of its neighbors. Beta should be chosen such that its absolute value is less than 
the reciprocal of the larges eigenvalue of N. 

Bonacich P, 1987 — Factoring and weighing approaches to clique identification . Journal 
of Mathematical Sociology, 2 (January, 1972), 113-120. 

TYPE: Entity Level 
INPUT: N: square 

beta e iH 

OUTPUT: ^ e [0.1] 

Let A = adjacency representation of the network N. Then Bonacich Power Centrality for 
the network is the solution c to the following system of linear equations: 

(I-pA)- 1 c = Ae 

, where I is the identity matrix, and e a vector of ones. 


Note that if beta is 0, then c is simply equal to the row degree of each entity. 
The values of c are not normalized. 


332 



166 Centrality, Closeness 


Closeness reveals so-called people in the know. Closeness measures the path length from 
one person to another in a network. For example, it tells us which person is central to an 
organization. Moreover, Closeness reveals how long it takes information to spread from 
one individual to others in the network. High scoring individuals in Closeness have the 
shortest paths to all others in the network. It would follow such individuals could monitor 
the information flow in an organization better than most others that have a lesser 
Closeness value. The ones with the highest value in this measure will often times have 
the best picture of what is happening in the network as a whole. 

Freeman, 1979

v = (|V|-l)/dist 

If some entity is not reachable from v then the Closeness Centrality of v is IVI. 


333 



167 Centrality, Eigenvector 


Eigenvector Centrality reflects one's connections to other well-connected people. A 
person connected to many isolated people in an organization will have a much lower 
score in this measure then those that are connected to people that have many connections 
themselves. This would be true even if such a WHO might have a high amount of actual 
connections (i.e. high degree centrality). 

It follows that a person well-connected to well-connected people can spread information 
much more quickly than one who only has connections to lesser important people in a 
network. People with higher scores of Eigenvector Centrality could be critical when rapid 
communication is needed. 

Bonacich P, 1972 

TYPE: Entity Level 

INPUT: N: square, symmetric 


OUTPUT: ^ e [oa] 


Calculates the eigenvector of the largest positive eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix 
representation of a square network. A Jacobi method is used to compute the eigenvalues 
and vectors. 


334 



168 Centrality, In Degree 


Degree Centrality measures how many other people are connected to a particular WHO 
we are interested in studying. For example, it can tell us how many people someone in an 
organization talks to based on their degree centrality value? Degree Centrality is one of 
the key measures used by those interested in networks. 

How you measure degree centrality depends on whether the network is symmetric (i.e. if 
A is connected to B is B connected to A?) and whether you want an answer that is 
normalized (i.e. to lie between 0 and 1 so that you can compare the degree centrality 
across networks of different size). 

Wasserman and Faust, 1994 

TYPE: Entity Level 

INPUT: N 

OUTPUT: ^ e [0,1]

This measure is also called Column Degree Centrality. 


335 



169 Centrality, Information 

Calculates the Stephenson and Zelen information centrality measure for each entity. 

Information centrality is a network metric that accounts for indirec as well as shortest 
(geodesic) paths among entities. Information centrality is similar to betweenness, except 
that betweenness considers only shortest paths geodesics, whereas information centrality 
also considers more circuitous paths weighted by the inverse of the path length (the 
number of links along the path). Entities high in information centrality are more likely to 
get more information and to get information faster.

TYPE: Entity Level 

INPUT: N: square 

OUTPUT: Entity Level: 

W e [Oi] 

Calculates the measure described on pg 195-6 of Wasserman and Faust. Isolates (entities 
with no edges) are first removed from the network, and the measure computed on the 
resulting sub-graph. The isolates are given centrality value 0. 


336 



170 Centrality, Inverse Closeness 

The average closeness of a entity to the other entities in a network. Inverse Closeness is 
the sum of the inverse distances between an entity and all other entities. This is defined 
for directed networks. 

Wasserman and Faust, 1994 (pg 195) 

TYPE: Node Level 

INPUT: N: square, binary

iev d 0 (v,i) d 0 (i,i) d G (v,i) 

if i is not reachable from v. 

Then, Inverse Closeness Centrality of entity v = dist/(IVI-l). 


337 



171 Centrality, Out Degree 


Degree Centrality measures how many other people are connected to a particular WHO 
we are interested in studying. For example, it can tell us how many people someone in an 
organization talks to based on their degree centrality value? Degree Centrality is one of 
the key measures used by those interested in networks. 

How you measure degree centrality depends on whether the network is symmetric (i.e. if 
A is connected to B is B connected to A) and whether you want an answer that is 
normalized (i.e. to lie between 0 and 1 so that you can compare the degree centrality 
across networks of different size). 

Wasserman and Faust, 1994 

TYPE: Entity Level 

INPUT: N: square 

OUTPUT: ^ e [°J] (If N is binary) 

Consider the matrix representation X of a network with m rows and n columns. Each row 
i is assigned an out-degree centrality based on the sum of entries in its row. 

The Out-Degree Centrality 

10 w i = — V x(i, f) 
n H 

This measure is also called Row Degree Centrality. 


338 



172 Centrality, Total Degree 


Degree Centrality tells us the relative number of direct connections a WHO might have in 
a network; the higher the score the more likely a WHO might be likely to receive and 
potentially pass on critical information that flows through the organization. 

Total Degree Centrality is one of the key measures of social network analysis and 
Dynamic Network Analysis. 

Wasserman and Faust, 1994 (pg 199) 

TYPE: Entity Level 
INPUT: N:square 

OUTPUT: ^ e [oa]

Note that the diagonal values are ignored. 

Clique Count 

Computes the number of distinct cliques to which each entity in a square, undirected 
network belongs. 

Counts the number of sub-groups where the members are completely connected to each 
other. It is reflects sub-structures in the network that contribute to a cohesive whole. 
Wasserman and Faust, 1994 (pg 254) 

TYPE: Node Level 
INPUT: N:square, symmetric 

OUTPUT' ^ (not i!C(llcd) 

A clique of an undirected, square network is defined in Wasserman and Faust as a 
maximal complete subgraph of three or more nodes. The clique detection algorithm 
employed is the Bron-Kerbosch maximal clique algorithm, which is Algorithm 457 of the 
Collected Algorithms from CACM.

173 Clustering Coefficient, Watts-Strogatz 


Measures the degree of clustering in a network by averaging the clustering coefficient of 
each entity. The clustering coefficient of a entity is the density of its ego network which 
is the sub graph induced by its immediate neighbors. 

Clustering Coefficient (graph level) 

Definition 


The average of the proportion of links between each employee and his or her direct 
neighbors divided by the number of links that could possibly exist between them. 

Interpretation 

The clustering coefficient gives a sense of the local characteristics of the network- 
how information spreads by means of employee groups. A higher clustering 
coefficient supports local information diffusion as well as a decentralized 
infrastructure because employees are likely to share information and know what is 
happening in their work group.

174 Cognitive Demand 


Cognitive Demand measures the total amount of effort expended by each agent to do its 
tasks. Individuals who are high in cognitive demand value are emergent leaders. Removal 
of these individuals tends to be quite disruptive to networks. 

Note: The minimum input requirement is the AA network. All other networks are 
optional. 

Carley, 2002 
TYPE: Agent Level 

INPUT: AA:binary; [AT:binary]; [AR:binary]; [RT:binary]; [AK:binary]; [KT:binary]; 
[TT:binary] 

OUTPUT: Agent Level: 

W 6 [0i] 

The Cognitive Demand for an agent i is an average of terms, each of which measures an 
aspect of its cognitive demand. Each term is normalized to be in [0,1]. The number of 
terms depends on the input networks. The computation of each term for agent i is detailed 
below: 

let xl = # of agents with which i interacts 
= sum(AA(i,:)) / (IAI-1) 
let x2 = # of tasks to which i is assigned 
= sum(AT(i,:)) / ITI 

let x3 = sum of the # of agents assigned to the same tasks as i 

= sum(ATA(i,:)-ATA(i,i)) / (ITI(IAI-l)), where ATA = AT*AT' 

let x4 = # of resources i manages 

= sum(AR(i,:)) / IRI 

let x5 = # of knowledge i manages 

= sum(AK(i,:)) / IKI 

let x6 = sum of # resources i needs for all its tasks 
= sum(ATR(i,:)) / (ITI*IRI), where ATR = AT*RT' 
let x7 = sum of # knowledge i needs for all its tasks 


341 



= sum(ATK(i,:)) / (ITI*IKI), where ATK = AT*KT' 


let x8 = sum of resource negotiation needs i has for its tasks 

= HammingDistance(AR(i,:), [AT*RT'](i,:)) / IRI 

let x9 = sum of knowledge negotiation needs i has for its tasks 

= HammingDistance(AK(i,:), [AT*KT'](i,:)) / IKI 

let xlO = sum of agents that i depends on or that depend on i 

let w = # number of agents assigned to each task 

= colsum(AT) 

let s = # agents that dependent on each task 
= (T+T')*w 

let v = # tasks that agents are dependent on 
= AT*s 

Then, xlO = v(i) / (IAI*ITI*(ITI-1)). 

Then Cognitive Demand for agent i is the average of the above terms.

175 Cognitive Distinctiveness 

175.1 AKA: Cognitive Distinctiveness, Relative or Distinctiveness Correlation

Measures the degree of resemblance between agents based on the number of knowledge 
bits they both have or both do not have.

let H, C, and N be defined as in Communication Congruence. 

let M(i,j) = [AA + (H+H') + C + (N+N')](i,j) > 0, and M(i,i) = 0 

Note that the transpose of H and N is used to make the communication reciprocal. 

let d = sum(M(i,:)) 

let d = d / (IAI-1), normalizing d to be in [0,1] 

Then Communication for agent i is d.

187 Congruence, Communication 

Measures to what extent the agents communicate when and only when it is needful to 
complete tasks. Hence, higher congrunce occurs when agents don't communicate if the 
tasks don't require it, and do when the tasks require it. 

Communication needs to be reciprocal. 

Carley, 2002 
TYPE: Graph Level 

INPUT: AA: binary, AT: binary, [AR/RT]: binary, [AK/KT]: binary, TT: binary 
OUTPUT: ^ e [0,1] 

One of the following pairs of matrices must exist: AK/KT, AR/RT. If both exist, then the 
measure first concatenates them into [AK AR], [KT RT] and uses them. 

Communication Congruence = 1 iif agents communicate when and only when it is 
needful to complete their tasks. There are three task related reasons when agents i and j 
need to communicate: 

(a) Handoff: if i is assigned to a task s and j is assigned to a task t and s directly precedes 
task t. 

(b) Co-Assignment: if i is assigned to a task s and j is also assigned to s. 

(c) Negotiation: if i is assigned to a task s and j is not, and there is a resource r to which 
agents assigned to s have no access but j does. 

The three cases are computed as follows: 

(a) let H = AT*TT*AT' 

(b) let C = AT*AT' 

(c) let N = AT*Z*AR', where Z(t,r) = [AT'*AR - RT'](t,r)<0 
Note that C is always symmetric, but not necessarily H and N. 
let Q(i,j) = [ (H+H') + C + (N+N')](i,j) > 0. 

Communication Congruence requires reciprocal communication, explaining the 
transposes of H and N to make them symmetric. 

let d = hamming distance between Q and AA, which measures the degree to which 
communication differs from that which is needed to do tasks. 

The maximum value for d is d_max = IAI*(IAI-1) 

Then Communication Congruence = 1 - (d /d_max), which is in [0,1].

192 Congruence, Social Technical 

Social technical congruence represents the proportion of coordination requirements that 
were satisfied through some type of actual coordination activity carried out through some 
means of communication^ 

Cataldo et al, 2006 

TYPE: Task Level 

INPUT: AT, TT, AA 

OUTPUT: Real Number in [0,1] 

* e [0i] 

A representation of the coordination requirements among the different workers is 
obtained by multiplying AT, TT and transpose of AT matrices. This product results in a 
people by people matrix where a cell ij indicates the extent to which person i works on 
tasks that share dependencies with the tasks worked on by person j. In other words, the 
resulting matrix represents the Coordination Requirements or the extent to which each 
pair of people needs to coordinate their work. Formally, the Coordination Requirements 
(CR) matrix is determined by the following product: 

Let, CR = AT * TT * transpose(AT) 

Given a particular CR matrix constructed from relating product dependencies to work 
dependencies, we can compare it to an Actual Coordination (CA) matrix that represents 
the interactions workers engaged in through different means of coordination. 

Diff (CR, CA) = card { diffij I crij > 0 & caij > 0 } 

ICRI = card { crij > 0 } 

We have, 

Congruence(CR, CA) = Diff (CR, CA) / ICRI

193 Congruence, 

Strict Knowledge/Strict Resource 

Measures the similarity between what knowledge is assigned to tasks via agents, and

Knowledge Congruence = 1 iff agents have knowledge when and only when it is needful 
to complete their tasks. Thus, we compute the knowledge assigned to tasks via agents, 
and compare it with the knowledge needed for tasks.

A skip edge in a network G=(V,E) is an edge (i,j)£E such that j is reachable from i in the 
graph G'=(V,E\(i,j)), that is, the graph G with edge (i,j) removed. Skip Count is simply 
the number of such edges in G normalized to be in [0,1] by dividing by IEI.

211 Exclusivity Complete 

Detects entities that have unique connections to other entities. 
Ashworth, 2003

OUTPUT: e [oa] 


This is a variation of the Exclusivity measure that weights the edges of an entity as 
follows: if no other entity has a connection to the entity, then its weight is one, otherwise 
it is zero. 

Thus, the Complete Exclusivity value for node i is: 

V £ AKllJ) *[siun(AK(:J) = 0] 

The value is then normalized by dividing by IKI.

212Exclusivity — 

Knowledge, Resource, Task 

Resource Exclusivity measures the extent that a WHO has connections that are unique in 
a network especially to network resources. It can reveal to the network analyst critical 
vulnerabilities (or strengths) depending on what the analyst is looking for. An example of 
this measure would be if a key resource that supports an entire organization is only 
accessible through one person. That person would have a high resource exclusivity 
value./p>

An entity level metric is one that is defined for, and gives a value for, each entity in a 
network. If there are x entities in a network, then the metric is calculated x times, once 
each for each entity. Examples are Degree Centrality, Betweeness, and Cognitive 
Demand. 

A network level metric is one that is defined for, and gives a value for, the network as a 
whole. The metric is calculated once for the network. Examples are Centralization, Graph 
Hierarchy, and the maximum or average Betweeness. 

Given an entity level metric, e.g., degree centrality, then the minimum, maximum, 
average, and standard deviation of that metric for that network level metrics. Examples 
are average degree centrality, maximum betweeness, and the standard deviation in

a task t. 

let

l<k<|K| l<k<|K| 


This is agent i's classification of b with respect to t. 


387 



The group of agents classify b using majority voting. 

That is, 

groupanswer = (— ^ answer(i) > .5 ). 

I I I ?ef 

Then, if group_answer = answer, then the group was accurate, otherwise not. 

This is repeated multiple times for each task, and across all tasks. The percentage correct 
is Performance as Accuracy. 

(2) Resource based: let N=RT' and S=AR in the analysis of case (1).

228Personnel Cost 


Total number of people reporting to an agent, plus its total knowledge, resources, and 
tasks. 

Carley, 2003 
TYPE: Agent Level 

INPUT: AA:binary; AK:binary; AR:binary; AT:binary 
OUTPUT: e [oa] 


Personnel Cost is the sum of the in-degree centrality of all AA matrices in the graph (this 
computes the number of agents reporting to each agent), plus the out-degree centrality of 
any AK, AR, and AT graphs. 

This sum is scaled so that each entity gets a score in [0,1]. 

229Potential Workload — Knowledge or Resource

. Agent Level: ^ , not scaled 
. Dyad Level: , not scaled 

SSA consists of weighted terms of interaction between actions. 

Let 

a,p, y, 6, JLI be Real number (these are weights). 


Let A = Agent x Agent interaction/communication matrix 

Let P = Agent x Agent physical proximity matrix 

Let S = Agent x Agent social demographic similarity matrix 

Let e = eigenvector centrality measure computed on A 

Let G = dyadic geodesics computed on A 

Then the SSA measure between agents i and j is:

Krackhardt, 1998 

TYPE: Entity Level 

INPUT: N: square, binary, symmetric 

OUTPUT: ^ 6 [0,1] 

Let N be a square network with n entities. The Simmelian Tie value for entity i is 
computed as follows: 

let NS = network N symmetrized using the Intersect (Minimum) method. 

r 

All cliques of size >= 3 are computed on NS and clique membership is recorded. Let 'i 
be the number of entities that are in a clique with entity i. 

r 

Then the Simmelian Ties value for emtity i is 'i. 

237Socio Economic Power

organization. 

TYPE: Agent Level 
INPUT: 

AK: binary 

AR: binary 

AT: binary 

OUTPUT: ^ e [0,1]

OUTPUT: e [oa] 


Minimum Speed = 1 / (Levels for the Network) 

241 Task Completion — 

Knowledge / Resource / Overall 

The percentage of tasks that can be completed by the agents assigned to them, based 
solely on whether the agents have the requisite knowledge or resources to do the tasks. 

Task Completion Overall is a combination of the Task Completion Knowledge and the 
Task Completion Resource. 

Carley, 2002 

TYPE: Graph Level 

INPUT: AK:binary; AT:binary; KT:binary 


OUTPUT: e [0.1]

necessary knowledge. 

let 


Need = [(AT'*AK) - KT] 


let 


S = {i | Isis T , 3 j : Need(i j) < 0 


396 



Knowledge Based Task Completion is the percentage of tasks that could be completed 
(ITI-ISI) / ITI 

Resource Based Task Completion is analogous, replacing AK with AR and KT with RT. 


397 



242Transitivity 

The percentage of edge pairs {(i,j), (j,k)} in the network such that (i,k) is also an edge in 
the network. 

The percentage of pairs in the employee communication network where employee A is 

linked to B and B is linked to C and C is also linked to A

let 

Potential = { (i,j,k) G I | (i,j) G E, and (j,k) G E } 
let 

Complete = { (i j,k) G Potential | (kk) G E }

Let G=(V,E) represent a square network with n entities. 

And let Triad be a matrix of dimension n x n. 

Triad(i,i) = 0 

Triad(ij) = card{ k | k != i, k !=j; AA(ij) A AA(kk) A AA(kj) i A j 


Then 

the Triad count for agent i = sum(Triad(i,:)) 

244Under Supply — 

Knowledge / Resource 

The extent to which the knowledge/Resource needed to do tasks are unavailable in the 
entire organization. 

Carley, 2002 

TYPE: Graph Level 

INPUT: AK:binary; AT:binary; KT:binary 
OUTPUT: ^ 6 [OJL] 

This is the number of required knowledge not available to tasks based on the current 
agent task assignments normalized by the number of tasks. 

Knowledge Under Supply = sum(dich( KT - AK'*KT)) / ITI 

Under Resource Supply is analogous, replacing AK with AR, and KT with RT.

247Belief Report 


246Reports 


Below are procedures to run a Belief Report in ORA. 

We set up an Excel spreadsheet with agents and the levels for each of the beliefs. Beliefs 
are strange as they can be either positive or negative. Two people share a belief only is 
both have a positive response or both have a negative response. 

From Excel, or other program you're using, save your data in the .csv format.

248Capacity Report 


The purpose of this report is to assess individuals' and organizations' capability to 
perform tasks. Below are procedures for running this report. 

248.1 Overall Capability and Needs 
List all congruence measures 

1. For agents - list min, max, avg and std dev in capability for each capability index. 

2. For organizations - list min, max, avg and std dev in capability for each capability 
index 

3. For tasks - list min, max, avg and std dec in requirements for each requirement 
index 

Most Capable 

List the top n most capable agents and next to their name list their capabilities 
(knowledge, resources, tasks). 

NOTE : list overall capability first (don't show capabilities for the overall). 

List the top n most capable organizations and next to their name list their 
capabilities (knowledge, resources, tasks). 

NOTE : List overall capability first, the overall explicit - then the three explicit. Then list 
the overall implicit and then the three implicit. 

NOTE : don't show capabilities for the overall measures. 

248.2 Highest Requirements 

List the top n tasks with the most requirements and next to each name list the 
requirements. 

NOTE: list the overall first (don't show requirements for the overall). 

Capability 

Capabilities are defined in terms of expertise (knowledge) and resources. 

NOTE : this formula discounts for the fact that most agents have some capabilities and 
assumes that there is a general discount to having large numbers of capabilities. 

An agent's general capability index in resources is: ACR =l/(l+EXP(-((x- 
0.5)* 10))) 

Where x = number of resources the agent has divided by the maximum number of 
resources any agent has (so for AR this is the row sum divided by the max row sum) 

An agent's general capability index in expertise is: ACK =l/(l+EXP(-((x- 
0.5)* 10))) 


410 



Where x = number of knowledge the agent has divided by the maximum number of 
knowledge any agent has (so for AK this is the row sum divided by the max row sum) 

An agent's capability can be inferred by the agent's experience. This is captured 
by the agent to task links. This is ACT=l/(l+EXP(-((x-0.5)*10))). 

Where x = number of tasks the agent has divided by the maximum number of tasks 
any agent has (so for AT this is the row sum divided by the max row sum) 

An agent's capability overall in both R, K and T is (ACR + ACK + ACT)/3 
An organization's explicit capability is: 

An organization's general capability index in resources is: OCR =l/(l+EXP(-((x- 
0.5)*10))) 

Where x = number of resources the organization has divided by the maximum 
number of resources any organization has (so for OR this is the row sum divided by 
the max row sum) 

An organization's explicit capability index in expertise is: OCK =l/(l+EXP(-((x- 
0.5)*10))) 

Where x = number of knowledge the organization has divided by the maximum 
number of knowledge any organization has (so for OK this is the row sum divided by 
the max row sum) 

An organization's explicit inferred capability index using tasks is: OCK 
=l/(l+EXP(-((x-0.5)*10))) 

Where x = number of tasks the organization has divided by the maximum number of 
tasks any organization has (so for OT this is the row sum divided by the max row 
sum) 

An organization's overall explicit capability is (OCR + OCK + OCT)/3 
An organization's implicit capability considers the expertise and resources of the 
agent's associated with the organization 

So this is for resources the average ACR across the agents associated with the 
organization. 

So this is for knowledge the average ACK across the agents associated with the 
organization. 

So this is for tasks (implicit inferred) the average ACT across the agents 
associated with the organization. 

From a network perspective, an agent is associated with an organization if AOij 

!= 0 . 

An organization's overall implicit capability is the sum of the 3 divided by 3. 

An organization's overall capability is the average of the explicit and implicit.

248.3 Requirements 

Each task has requirements in terms of the knowledge and resources needed for 
that task. 

Note : in practice it may not be possible to measure the requirements for all tasks, 
particularly for covert operations, prior to the task being done. So, a subject matter 
expert's view of the "complexity" of the task might be substituted. Such complexity would 
play the same role, and have the same properties as the requirements index defined here. 
A task's general requirement index in resources is: RR =the number of resources 
needed for that task/maximum number of resources needed for any task (so for 
RT this is the col sum divided by the max col sum) 

A task's general requirement index in knowledge is: RK =the number of 
knowledge needed for that task / maximum number of knowledge needed for any 
task (so for KT this is the col sum divided by the max col sum) 

A task's overall requirement index is the average of RR and RK. 

Match 

In general agents with more capabilities when assigned to tasks with more 
requirements will better meet those needs. In general, agents with more 
capabilities will be able to perform more tasks. In general, tasks with higher 
requirements need either more agents or agents with more capabilities. 

When the exact requirements are done it is possible to do a match function. Here 
the idea is that the task is done best when the there is congruence between what 
resources/knowledge are needed for a task and what resources/knowledge those 
agents assigned to the task have. 

Several of the congruence measures in ORA apply here. For these definitions see 
the on-line ORA help.

250Capacity Report 


The purpose of this report is to assess individuals' and organizations' capability to 
perform tasks. Below are procedures to run a capacity report in ORA. 

250.1 Overall Capability and Needs 

List all congruence measures 

1. For agents - list min, max, avg and std dev in capability for each capability index. 

2. For organizations - list min, max, avg and std dev in capability for each capability 
index 

3. For tasks - list min, max, avg and std dec in requirements for each requirement 
index 

Most Capable 

List the top n most capable agents and next to name list their capabilities 
(knowledge, resources, tasks). Note; list overall capability first (don't show 
capabilities for the overall). 

List the top n most capable organizations and next to name list their capabilities 
(knowledge, resources, tasks). Note; list overall capability first, the overall 
explicit - then the 3 explicit, then the overall implicit and then the 3 implicit. 
Note, don't show capabilities for the overall measures. 

Highest Requirements 

List the top n tasks with the most requirements and next to each list the 
requirements. Note list the overall first (don't show requirements for the overall). 

Capability 

Capabilities are defined in terms of expertise (knowledge) and resources. 

Note this formula discounts for the fact that most agents have some capabilities and 
assumes that there is a general discount to having large numbers of capabilities. 

An agent's general capability index in resources is: ACR =l/(l+EXP(-((x- 
0.5)* 10))) 

Where x = number of resources the agent has divided by the maximum number of 
resources any agent has (so for AR this is the row sum divided by the max row sum) 

An agent's general capability index in expertise is: ACK =l/(l+EXP(-((x- 
0.5)*10))) 

Where x = number of knowledge the agent has divided by the maximum number of 
knowledge any agent has (so for AK this is the row sum divided by the max row sum) 

An agent's capability can be inferred by the agent's experience. This is captured 
by the agent to task links. This is ACT=l/(l+EXP(-((x-0.5)*10))). 


413 



Where x = number of tasks the agent has divided by the maximum number of tasks 
any agent has (so for AT this is the row sum divided by the max row sum) 


An agent's capability overall in both R, K and T is (ACR + ACK + ACT)/3 
An organization's explicit capability is: 

An organization's general capability index in resources is: OCR =l/(l+EXP(-((x- 
0.5)*10») 

Where x = number of resources the organization has divided by the maximum 
number of resources any organization has (so for OR this is the row sum divided by 
the max row sum) 

An organization's explicit capability index in expertise is: OCK =l/(l+EXP(-((x- 
0.5)* 10))) 

Where x = number of knowledge the organization has divided by the maximum 
number of knowledge any organization has (so for OK this is the row sum divided by 
the max row sum) 

An organization's explicit inferred capability index using tasks is: OCK 
=l/(l+EXP(-((x-0.5)*10))) 

Where x = number of tasks the organization has divided by the maximum number of 
tasks any organization has (so for OT this is the row sum divided by the max row 
sum) 

An organization's overall explicit capability is (OCR + OCK + OCT)/3 
An organization's implicit capability considers the expertise and resources of the 
agent's associated with the organization 

So this is for resources the average ACR across the agents associated with the 
organization. 

So this is for knowledge the average ACK across the agents associated with the 
organization. 

So this is for tasks (implicit inferred) the average ACT across the agents 
associated with the organization. 

From a network perspective, an agent is associated with an organization if AOij 

!= 0 . 

An organization's overall implicit capability is the sum of the 3 divided by 3. 

An organization's overall capability is the average of the explicit and implicit. 

250.2 Requirements 

Each task has requirements in terms of the knowledge and resources needed for 
that task. 


414 



Note, in practice it may not be possible to measure the requirements for all tasks, 
particularly for covert operations, prior to the task being done. So, a subject matter 
expert's view of the "complexity" of the task might be substituted. Such complexity would 
play the same role, and have the same properties as the requirements index defined here. 
A task's general requirement index in resources is: RR =the number of resources 
needed for that task/maximum number of resources needed for any task (so for 
RT this is the col sum divided by the max col sum) 

A task's general requirement index in knowledge is: RK =the number of 
knowledge needed for that task / maximum number of knowledge needed for any 
task (so for KT this is the col sum divided by the max col sum) 

A task's overall requirement index is the average of RR and RK. 

Match 

In general agents with more capabilities when assigned to tasks with more 
requirements will better meet those needs. In general, agents with more 
capabilities will be able to perform more tasks. In general, tasks with higher 
requirements need either more agents or agents with more capabilities. 

When the exact requirements are done it is possible to do a match function. Here 
the idea is that the task is done best when the there is congruence between what 
resources/knowledge are needed for a task and what resources/knowledge those 
agents assigned to the task have.

the on-line ORA help.

251.2 The Reports 


KEY-ENTITY REPORT 

[Xi Key Entities: Hov* 

X Key Erttbes: Whet 

X 

Key Enwties: where 

X | Key Entities: Who 

X Performance Indicators 

X 


The Entity Report creates up to six separate reports. 

1. KEY-ENTITY REPORT shows general information about the report 

2. Who shows information about agents, such as Emmergent Leader, In the Know, 
and Potential Influential. Gives information about knowledge that agents know, 
the resources they have access to, and what events the agents were at. 

3. What shows information for tasks and the tasks related to agents, knowledge, etc. 
such as High Concentration of Actors, Knowledge, and Resources. 

4. Where shows information about locations related to agents, resources, and tasks 
such as Central Locations, Most Active Locations, and Highest Concentration of 
Actors. 

5. How shows information about the knowledge related to agents, knowledge, and 
loactions such as Dominant Knowledge, Most Available, Dominant Resources. 

6. Performance Indicators shows information about Social Density, Communication, 
and Performance. 

251.3 Output Options 



You have a choice of four formats of report. Text places the reports in individual tabs in 
Panel 3 of the main interface. HTML creates reports that are opened up in a browser 
window. CSV are files that can be opened in Excel. And DyNetML creates .xml files, the 
default for ORA. 


417 


















When you are finished, select [Finish]. 


418 



252Key Entity Report — Other Options 


The Key Entities Report allows you to further tweak your report by defining parameters 
such as isolates, pendants, and binarizing your data. Following are three dialog boxes 
explaing those further refinements. 

252.1 General Transformation 

Occasionally your data needs work before creating the report. The General 
Transformation allows for refining it. See the dialog box below 



• Remove Isolates: Remove any isolates* before running the report. 

• Remove Pendants: Remove any pendants* before running the report. 

• Symmetrize by method: Even out the matrix by using one of the methods i nthe 
dropdown menu. 


Maximum 


Minimum 

Average 


o Maximum : Acts like the binary OR function. If either one of a pair of 
nodes has a link then this function creates an equal link in the opposite 
direction. 

o Minimum : Acts like the binary AND function. Both nodes need to have a 
link one another in order for a link to be valid. Else there is no link 
between the two nodes, 
o Average: 


419 





















• Remove links: Allows you to remove links from the report based on one of the 
options in the dropdown menu. 


lessThan 


lessThanEquals 

equals 

notEquals 

greaterThanEquals 

greaterthan 


• Binarize: Binarizing* your numeric data will change all link weights to a value of 
either [1] or [0], 

• Conform meta-matrice by method: 

• Create union matrices: 

When you are finished, select [Next >]. 


420 






252.2 Remove Entities Options 



You can remove any of the nodes and stop them from affecting a report. By either using 
the tabs to find the entity in it's set or using the search box to single it out. Then place a 
checkmark in the box to remove it from view. The options are fairly self explanatory. 
You can create multiple filters with this method. 

The Filter Commands give you the choice of matching all or some of the filters you've 
created. And the [Reset Filters] button clears all the filters you've made. The filters can be 
refined by using the Search box to cal up particular nodes and marking them with a 
checkmark to remove them from the use. This can be done as many times as necessary 
before proceeding. You can also go through the tabs individually and choose to 
Select/Deselect whichever nodes you want. 

The [Select All] and [Clear All] buttons work on only the currently visible items. 

Any node that you place a checkmark in will be excluded from the filter. 

When you are finished, select [Next >]. 


421 















































252.3 Partition Options 



From this screen choose an Entity from the top box. Place a checkmark in the appropriate 
checkbox. Next in the Select an attribute dropdown menu chose the attribute to base the 
report on. Finally chose and attribute value to use for the partition. 

If you want to create a new MetaMatrix place a checkmark in the bottom box add created 
partition meta matrices to the main interface. 

When you are finished, select [Next >]. 

252.4 Summary 

With the Key Entities Report you can refine your report to focus on only the segment 
of your Network you prefer.

There's also a separate contextual menu when you've got two or more Meta-Networks 
selected. 

Open up multiple Meta-Networks in the Main Interface. Load two or more files into 
Panel 1. We'll demonstrate this on two Meta-Networks containing Bob, Carol Ted, & 
Alice. 

The agents are identical but the tasks in each are different, except for driving which 
appears in both and has slightly different values. Inbetween the time of cookingln and 
eatingOut Alice's feelings for Ted have grown.

Intersect Meta-Network works similar to the Union function and has the same five 
options. But in creating the new Meta-Network only nodes that appear in all Meta- 
Networks are carried over to the new Meta-Network. 

For example: All four agents appear in both Meta-Networks and are brought over into the 
new Meta-Network. But though there were six tasks in the cookingln and three tasks in 
eatingOut there is only one task (driver) in the new Meta-Network created from the 
intersect function. Only nodes found in all Meta-Networks are brought over.

258Creating a Network from an Excel Spreadsheet 

If you don't have a Network, you can create one from scratch. Below is step-by-step 
instruction on how to do this. 

We will create an square, agent-by-agent Network. We say it is square because all row 
headings correspond directly to column headings. This is important as it relates to 
specific measures ORA can run on a graph. If the graph is not square, some measures will 
not work. 

Open a blank Microsoft Excel work book. In column A we will enter the name of all the 
nodes that make up our social network or organization. 

258.1.1 NOTE : When creating your spreadsheet, do not add any 
additional titles, notes, or other headings, which will interfere with 
the "square" properties of the Network.

Next, create column headings using the correlating names as they appear in row 
headings. Again, this will ensure that our Network will be square.

Next we will create links between each agent. We do this by entering a 1 if a direct 
connection or relationship exists and a 0 if it does not. Please note that headings that 
cross-reference themselves are considered redundant and thus are left blank or 0. 

In the example below, Redundant cells are filled in with red strips to illustrate the self¬ 
loops. This redundancy should continue as a smooth diagonal line from the top left comer 
of your Network to the bottom right. 



430 












































258.1.2 NOTE : If you don’t end up with a diagonal line then your 
graph is not square. 

Using Is and Os to establish link, complete your spreadsheet. 

In the Network example, we have assigned links randomly. Within your organization or 
network, however, you can describe any direct connections or relationships you are 
interested in analyzing. For instance, you may determine that a direct connection exists if 
agents within your network consult with each other at least once a month; literally, it can 
be anything you decide. 

Below is our completed Network (The red fill illustrates cells that do not require input 
due to their redundancy*). 



Now that we have essentially built a Network from scratch using Excel, the next step is to 
save it in a compatible file format ORA can interpret. For Excel spreadsheets this will be 
the CSV* file format. 

258.1.3 From the drop down menu: File => Save As 

Make sure you save this file as a CSV (comma delimited) 

You have now created a Network from scratch which can be loaded into ORA. 

Now return to ORA and load up your new Network. Below is a our new Network 
rendered in the ORA Visualizer. Notice the arrows only point from one node to another if 
there is a 1 in the column for a particular node. i.e. There is a "1" in the bob column for 
ted but a "0" in the ted column for bob. So an arrow points from ted to bob but NOT from 
bob to ted.

260Info Tab - Network 


When a Network is selected there are also two tabs, Info and Editor. 

The Info tab contains a textbox, Network ID in which you can change the name of any 
metwork, The Source and Target Nodesets, and whether this network is directed or not, 
the Link Count, and the Density. 

The two buttons underneath allow the choice of Visualize this Network which will send 
the entire Meta-Network to the visualizer or Visualize Only this Network which display 
only the currently selected Network.

The Editor tab has two views: Binary and Numeric. 

Binary view is used when you only need to extablish a connection between two nodes 
with no weights. It’s a simple Yes or No arrangement.

The Numeric view allows you to treat links between various nodes with more or less 
importance. Notice that all the row nodes have a checkmarked connection to the column 
containing [yu] in the binary mode. This denotes they know one another. But in the 
numeric mode this value is a 0.5 which is used to denote previous acknowledgement but 
is an advesary.

261 Info Tab - NodeSet 


Panel 2 contains two tabs, Info and Editor. The Info tab is mainly designed to display 
information regarding the Meta-Networks, NodeSets, and Networks. But this is the area 
where you can rename the Node Class ID and the Node Class Type. Place the cursor in 
the box, make sure the entire name is highlighted, and type in your new name. 

This area also gives you the Node Count of the selected Node Set as well as the Attribute 
Names contained within the NodeSet.

Produced by ORA developed at CASOS - Carnegie Mellon University 


From this Intelligence Report, it appears that Fazul Mohammed, Khalfan Mohamed, 
Mohamed Owhali, Mohammed Odeh, Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, and Wadih El-Hage 
are among the most important people in the terrorist network. This means they may have 
a great deal of knowledge, influence over many other agents in the network, special 
expertise or capability, or access to important resources and locations. 

For example, Wadih El-Hage is important because he is the most in-the-know, commands 
important cliques within the network, and has the most potential influence in the network. 


446 



262.19 III. What do we know about an actor of interest? 


There are three ways to get additional information about an actor of interest: 

262.20 1. Visualize information about a selected actor 
For example, we can view information about Wadih El-Hage. 

• Return to the meta matrix visualization pop-up window. 

• Single-click on the red circle for the actor of interest. A window will pop up 
displaying information on the actor. 

Below is a screen capture of the information resulting from clicking on the red circle for 
Wadih El-Hage:

262.21 2. Visualize an actor's sphere of influence 

A sphere of influence is the set of actors, groups, knowledge, resources, events, and 

locations that influence and are influenced by a particular actor of interest. 

For example, we can examine the sphere of influence of Ahmed Ghailani. 

To visualize an actor's sphere of influence: 

• Return to the meta matrix visualization pop-up window. 

• Make sure the whole meta matrix is visualized. If it isn't, go to Actions in the 
menu bar and select Show All Entities. 

• Go to Tools in the menu bar and select Sphere of Influence. A window titled 
Sphere of Influence (Ego Network) will pop up. 

• In the Search field halfway down the popup window, type the beginning of the 
actor's name. From the options that appear in the chart below, click the box next 
to the name of your actor of interest. That actor's sphere of influence will be 
displayed in the visualization window. 

Below is a visualization of the sphere of influence of Ahmed Ghailani: 



To return to the original full meta matrix visualization, go to Actions in the menu bar and 
select Show All Entities. 


448 















262.22 3. Run a Sphere of Influence Report 

A Sphere of Influence Report for an individual identifies the set of actors, groups, 
knowledge, resources, events, and locations that influence and are influenced by that 
actor. 

For example, we can examine the sphere of influence of Ahmed Ghailani. 

To run a Sphere of Influence Report: 

• Return to the ORA interface. 

• Go to Analysis in the menu bar and click Generate Reports. A window titled 
Generate Reports pops up. 

• At the top of the window is a pull-down menu titled Select Report. Pull down the 
menu by clicking the small inverted arrow icon to its right, and select Sphere of 
Influence. 

• In the box titled Select one or more meta matrices: click the box for the Tanzania 
Embassy bombing meta matrix. 

• At the bottom of the popup window is a file chooser titled Enter a file name (any 
extension will be ignored) for the results file: Click the Browse button to the right 
and navigate to the location you want. Type in a filename (for example, 
SOIOutput) and click Open. 

• Click the Next button at the very bottom of the popup window. 

• From the pull-down menu titled Select an Entity: choose Ahmed Ghailani. 

• Click the Finish button. 

It may take a few minutes for ORA to run the Sphere of Influence Report. When ORA is 
finished, a small window will pop up tell you the analysis was successfully completed. 
Click OK. 

An HTML file displaying the Sphere of Influence Report will pop up in your browser 
window. 

Below is the HTML file for Ahmed Ghailani's sphere of influence:

262.33 IV. What are the connections between two actors of interest? 

Sometimes, rather than influencing an actor directly, you may want to examine whether 
that actor has a connection with someone who is more interesting to you. For this, the 
Path Finder feature is most useful. 

For example, we can look at how Ahmed Ghailani and Wadih El-Hage are connected. 

To use the Path Finder feature: 

• Return to the meta matrix visualization pop-up window. 

• Make sure the whole meta matrix is visualized. If it is not, go to Actions in the 
menu bar and select Show All Entities. 

• Go to Tools in the menu bar and select Path Finder. A window titled Path Finder 
will pop up. 

• In the bottom half of this pop-up window, there are two tabs titled Entity 1 and 
Entity 2. Entity 1 is the from entity, and Entity 2 is the to entity. In other words. 
Path Finder searches for communication and information that is passed from 
Entity 1 to Entity 2. 

• In the Entity 1 tab, type the name of your first actor of interest into the Search 
field. From the chart of agents below the Search field, check the box for the name 
of that agent. (For example, Ahmed Ghailani). 

• Click on the Entity 2 tab and type in the name of your second actor of interest into 
the Search field. From the chart of agents below the Search field, check the box 
for the name of that agent. (For example, Wadih El-Hage). 

• The visualization of the connections between Entity 1 and Entity 2 will appear in 
the visualization window.

El-Hage: 




262.34 V. What is the immediate impact of a particular agent on the network? 


455 















262.35 VI. What happens to the network when certain entities are removed? 

We can examine the impact of removing a particular entity from the network by using 
Near Term Analysis (NTA). NTA removes a given entity and estimates the changes in 
the remaining network. 

This provides a what if?... analysis of the network. We can simulate strategic 
interventions or eliminations of certain agents, and examine how the network should 
react and change. For example, we can look at how the Tanzania Embassy bombing 
network changes if Ahmed Ghailani and/or Wadih El-Hage are eliminated. 

To run a Near Term Analysis: 

1. Start the Near Term Analysis window 

• Return to the ORA interface. 

• Make sure the meta matrix is highlighted in Panel 1. If it is not highlighted, 
single-click on it. 

• Go to Analysis in the menu bar and select Near-Term Analysis. A window titled 
Near Term Analysis will pop up. 

NTA has two modes, Novice and Advanced, displayed as tabs in the Near Term Analysis 
pop-up window. Novice mode provides an automatic analysis set-up, but does not allow 
users to set up their own hypotheses. 

• Click on the Advanced mode tab to switch to Advanced mode. 

Below is a screen capture showing the Advanced mode tab in the Near Term Analysis 
pop-up window: 



456 





















• In the field titled Settings, find the number boxes on the far right. Change the 
number of replications (the top number box) to 2, and the number of simulated 
time-points (the bottom number box) to 52. The timeline in the Simulated time 
line field will expand to include 52 time-steps. 

2. Open the simulation scenario wizard 

• In the middle of the pop-up window, find and click the Add new simulation 
instances button. A small window titled Near Term Analysis - Simulation 
scenario create wizard will pop up. 

Below is a screen capture showing this wizard window: 



• In this wizard window, make sure the first option in the Options field is selected. 
Click the Next button. The wizard window will display options for creating a 
custom scenario. 


457 






Below is a screen capture showing this custom scenario field in the wizard window: 



3. Remove Wadih El-Hage 

• Click the box for Wadih El-Hage in the table of agents in the wizard window. 
Change the Timing box to 10 in the same row. 

• To add this event set-up to the Near Term Analysis, click the Add events button 
located next to the Search field (above the list of agents). 

The timeline at the top of the wizard window will mark the isolation of Wadih El-Hage at 
time 10. 


458 



























Below is a screen capture of this timeline: 



• Click the Add a simulation button at the bottom of the wizard window. The 
wizard window will close automatically. In the NTA window, the new simulation 
case will appear in the Cases to simulate field. 

4. Remove Ahmed Ghailani 

• Follow Step 3, but replace Wadih El-Hage with Ahmed Ghailani. 

Your two simulation cases appear in the Near Term Analysis window in the Cases to 
simulate field, along with the Baseline case. The Baseline case is simply the network with 
no entities removed. 

You can view your different simulation cases by clicking on them in the Cases to 
simulate field, and the simulation time-line will change accordingly. 

5. Run the Near Term Analysis 

• Click the Execution button at the bottom of the Near Term Analysis window. 

• A small window will pop up to warn you that the execution may take a long time. 
Click OK. Another small window will pop up to show you how the simulations 
are progressing in the Near Term Analysis. 

6. View the results of the Near Term Analysis 

• When the analysis is complete, a new window titled Near Term Analysis Results 
will pop up. 


459 
























Below is a screen capture of the results pop-up window: 



These two performance lines correspond to deviations from the baseline of knowledge 
diffusion over time. Examining this performance change over time reveals how much an 
agent's elimination impacts the performance of the organization. 

• To draw a bar chart, click the Draw bar chart button in the results window. The 
resulting bar chart displays a performance comparison for each time-point.

263Create a New Meta-Network 


There are times you need to run measures on or visualize only part of an existing Meta- 
Network. 

This section will show you the easy way to create sub-sets of an existing Meta-Network. 
First duplicate the Meta-Network. Highlight the Meta-Network then from the main menu 
select Edit => Copy Meta-Network. Then form the main menu select Edit => Paste Meta- 
Networks. It would be a good idea to rename this new Meta-Network immediately so as 
to not get it comfused with the original. 

Next, expand the Meta-Network you want by clicking the [+] if it isn't expanded already. 
Highlight the nodeset with the nodes you want to remove.

The new node can then be renamed by clicking inside the cell. 

263.1 Delete an existing node 

To delete a node from a NodeSet place a checkmark in the box(es) to the left of the 
node(s) and select [Delete]. 



Select [OK] and all nodes with checkmarks will be deleted from the NodeSet. 


465 





























































263.2 Merge two nodes 

The Merge button combines the links and attributes of the selected nodes and creates a 
merged or combined node. The nodes that were merged are removed, and replaced with 
the combined node. Used primarily when data needs to be consolidated. 

Example: You have two nodes, Bob and Robert. They are actually the same node and 
you want to combine their information into one node. 

264Performing a View Network Over-Time Analysis 

The purpose of this lesson is to perform both a View Network Over Time and View 
Measures Over Time Analysis. 

To do so requires multiple network datasets representative of your network over different 
times. 

The goal is to analyze how a network changes across multiple times. The period is 
determined by the intervals of collected network data and presented as multiple Meta- 
Matrices, which are loaded into ORA in sequential order. The steps below provide 
detailed instruction on how type of analysis. 

To perform a View Network Over-Time Analysis, you must load Meta-Matrices that 
relate to different time captures of your network data, which need to be in the form of 
multiple Meta-Matrices. 

In the following example, we will use network time captures of the 1998 Embassy 
Bombing in Tanzania Meta-Matrix data set and compare the same data set as we knew it 
in 1997 and 1996 and 1998. We will then compare all the Meta-Matrices in the Network 
Over-Time Viewer to gain a visual representation of how this network changed between 
1996 and 1998. 

NOTE : For our purposes, we have changed data in this example and have renamed the 
Meta-matrix for three different years. This will denote different network variables that 
have changed over time. 

You will see in the left windowpane under input dataset three Meta-Matrices, 1998, 1997, 
and 1996, have been loaded. 


466 



From the main menu, select File => Open Meta Matrix 


x: 


Use this wizard to import any type of data into Ora. 

The supported file types are: dynetml (native Ora xml format^ 
,d\ } .##h (UCINet); .csv (Excel format), .txtj .raw, .net (Pajek), 
.graphml, and .stl (GMU Model).

Highlight all files you analyze in Over-Time Viewer. Press [Enter], 



The import data window will appear (below). This will confirm the files you wish to 
analyze.

All three Meta-Matrices should display in Panel 1. 



264.1 Performing the Over-Time Analysis 

Now that we have time captures of our network data represented and loaded into ORA in 
the form of three Meta-Matrices relating to 1996, 1997 and 1998, we can perform the 
Over-Time Analysis. 

264.1.1.1 From the Menu Bar => Data Visualization => View

The ORA Visualizer will render all of the loaded Meta-Matrices. 

Please take special note of the Time Viewer pop-up Window. This window displays a 
slider, which will allow you to quickly change from the first Meta-Matrix time capture of 
1996, to 1997 and 1998 respectively. 


469 





























By moving the slider from one Meta-Matrix to the next, you will gain a visual 
perspective on how the network has changed over Time. 

The series of screen shots below display how the visualized data changes from one slider 
to position to the next. These renders then allow you a picture of how the network 
changes Over-Time. 

NOTE : Depending on the complexity of the network and the extent to which 
relationships (ties) have changed, the visualization of those changes may be subtle. 

The screen shots below, however, will emphasize the extent to which the role of the 
WTC Event node has changed from 1996 to 1998 in relation to the network of which it is 
part of namely the Tanzania data set. Below these screen captures, are a series of detail 
screen captures focusing on the WTC Event node.

472 















264.6 WTC Event Node: Detail 2 -1997 

264.6.1.1 Notice who how the relationships of this node to the rest 
of the network has changed from 1996 to 1997. 



264.6.1.2 Notice that the connections (links) have changed from 
1996 to 1997. 



473 

































As you can see, as we progress through the data sets pertaining to 1996, 1997 and 1998, 
the event node WTC lost direct ties to other parts of the network. In the 1996 data set, 
WTC had 3 ties to other nodes in the Tanzania Embassy network; In 1997, only 2; 
Finally, in 1998, the WTC event node had only 1 link to Tanzania Network. This may 
indicate that the WTC node may have lost importance from one year to the next. 

264.7 Summary of Lesson 

At this point, you should be able to complete the following tasks to perform an Over- 
Time Network Analysis. 

• Load multiple Time Data Captures in the form of Meta-Matrices, which are 
representative of your network (Meta-Matrix) over time. 

• Use the Over-Time slider window tool to move from one time capture to the next. 

• Gain a visual perspective of how your overall network has changed from one time 
capture to the next.

265Performing the View Measures Over-Time Analysis 

ORA provides an alternative method to analyzing your network data (in the form of 
MetaNetworks captured over time) than the only in the Visualizer. By running a View 
Measures Over Time analysis you can visualize how your network changes in relation to 
any given measure in the form of charts, which take you from one time point to the next. 
Below is a series of screen captures and instruction on how to access the View Measures 
Over Time feature: 

From the main menu bar select Data Visualization => View Measures Over Time

The View Measure Over Time Window will appear. You will see that this window is 
primarily organized into three sections. 

Area 1: is a slider where you can control various inputs that affect the aggregation level 
of your Meta Matrices. 

Area 2: is a tabbed index allowing you to select the graph level you desire and the 
individual node sets you are interested in analyzing. 

Area 3: displays the actual chart based on the measures you selected in the tabbed index 
and the position of the aggregation slider. 



265.2 Interpreting The Results After Performing View Measures Over-Time 
Analysis 

In the example above, we have loaded all three of our network time captures into the 
View Measures Over Time Analysis tool. The result of our analysis, as we have indicated 
before, will be displayed as a chart in the bottom section of the ORA interface in Panel 3. 
But, what does this tell us? To find out, we will examine the Graph Level measure 
Knowledge Waste. From the tabbed measures window: 

265.2.1.1 Graph tab > Congruence, Organization Measure, 
Knowledge Waste. 


476 






















The result is displayed below. 



We can see the chart displays an axis scale correlating to our networks over time. The 
graph level measure of Knowledge Waste was selected using the View Measures Over 
Time tool and the result is displayed in the chart area of the window. 

We can see that the graph level measure of Knowledge Waste held a value slightly above 
40 in the first Meta Matrix, 1996, displayed with 1 on the Time axis. We can deduce from 
the chart that in 1997 something affected our measure of Knowledge Waste to increase 
the value to nearly 60. This corresponds to the time scale axis of 2, which represents 
1997, our second year of network data. In the final year, 1998, our measure of 
Knowledge Waste declined to the value in 1996. This should be visually evident with its 
relative line graph position. 

It is clear that the value for the Knowledge Waste Measure increased from the first Meta 
Matrix (1996) to the second (1997) and then retreated back to its original (1996) level. It 
would be up to you to determine what may have affected that measure for it to undergo 
this progression and regression. 

Summary of Lesson 

At this point, you should be able to complete the following tasks to perform a View 
Measures Over-Time Analysis: 

• Load multiple data files into ORA (in the form of Meta-Matrices) representative 
of your network across certain periods. 

• Select an aggregation level and choose a graph level or node level set to analyze. 

• Analyze the data output in the charting tool located in the bottom section of the 
View Measures Over Time window. 


477 

















• See how your network may have changed from one time capture to the next for 
any given graph level or entity node measure. 

• Use this visual comprehension to draw conclusions about how your network 
changed across multiple times. 

266Renaming 

266.1 Renaming Meta-Networks, Meta-Nodes, and Networks 

ORA allows you to rename the Meta-Network, Meta-Node, and Networks. This helps 
makes the information clearer for you. Below I renamed one of the Meta-Nodes to those 
guys and also renamed the type to who?. You can see how it's reflected throughout the 
entirely of panel 1. So you can rename any Meta-Node in a Meta-Network for better 
readability.

267Running An Over-Time Analysis 

267.1 Overview: Over-Time Viewer 

To run the Over-Time Viewer, you must first load MetaNetworks that relate to different 
time captures of network data. In the example below, you will see in the left window 
pane under input dataset three MetaNetworks, 2000, 2001, and 2002, have been loaded. 
Once you have loaded your MetaNetworks, select the Over-Time Viewer from the main 
interface tool bar under Data Visualization. 

The black ellipse in the screen shot below illustrates how to access the Over-Time 
Viewer from ORA's main interface.

The Over-Time viewer will compute Ora measures on the

Note: the nodesets in the meta matrices will be merged 
into the union of all the nodes in all the meta matrices. 

Therefore the computed values may differ from those computed on 
each meta matrix individually. 


OK

The Over-Time Viewer will merge your loaded MetaNetworks. In this case 2000, 20001, 
and 2002 will merge. The Progress... pop-up window (below) details the status as ORA 
runs measures on the merged MetaNetworks: 



When it is finished running, the View Measures Over Time window appears next (screen 
shot below). 

Here you can run specific measures against the nodesets within your merged 
MetaNetworks. In the example below, we see that we have opted to run the measure 
Chart_Measures against the node set Centrality-Total Degree. Multiple sets of nodes can 
be selected against a measure by using "ctrl-click." 


480 


















The results are displayed in the chart at the bottom of the View Measures Over Time 
window (shown above). 

Based on this analysis, we can conclude the overall Centrality-Total Degree measure of 
our network sample had increased slightly from 2000 to 2001, then decreased noticeably

269Lesson 1: ORA Overview 

269.1 Overview of ORA Interface 

An overview of the ORA interface 
Below is an image of the ORA interface: 



The menu bar runs across the top of the window, and the rest of the screen is divided into 
three panels. 

Panel 1 displays a list of the Meta-Networks that has been loaded into ORA, its 
components and sub-networks. To view information about a particular meta-network or 
sub-network, single-click on it. 

Panel 2 displays information about the meta-network or sub-network highlighted in Panel 

1 . 

Panel 3 displays information about the results of analyses run on your meta-network. 

269.2 Loading a meta-network into ORA 

You have three options for opening your meta-network in ORA: 

• From the main menu select File => Open Meta-Network. A small window titled 
Help: Opening meta-network pops up. Your data should already be in the correct 
format, so click [OK], 

• Next, a file chooser titled Open pops up. Browse to the location of your dataset, 
single-click on it, and click the Open button in the bottom right corner. 


482 






















• Click the first icon in the row directly below the menu bar. It looks like a half¬ 
open file folder. A window titled Import Data into ORA will pop up. Click the 
Select Files button. A file chooser titled Open pops up. Browse to the location of 
your dataset, single-click on it, and click the Open button in the bottom right 
corner. You will be returned to the Import Data into ORA window. Click the 
Finish button in the bottom right corner. 

• In panel 2, click the Load button on the far right. A window titled Import Data 
into ORA pops up. Click the Select Files button. A file chooser titled Open pops 
up. Browse to the location of your dataset, single-click on it, and click the Open 
button in the bottom right corner. You will be returned to the Import Data into 
ORA window. Click the Finish button in the bottom right corner. 

A list of your meta-network and sub-categories in Panel 1, as well as the location and 
basic statistics of your meta-network in Panel 2 will appear. ORA is ready to begin 
analyzing the meta-network. 

269.3 The Visualizer 

To visualize a meta-network, first make sure the meta-network you wish to visualize is 
highlighted in Panel 1. If it is not highlighted, single-click on it. 

In Panel 2, click the Visualize this Meta-Network button. A new window will pop up 
displaying your meta-network graphically. A small legend also appears.

Below is a screen capture showing the visualization of the agent x event graph from the 
Stargate Summit Meta-Network.

The visualization displays the connections between all items in the Sargate Summit Meta- 
Network. The red circles represent the agents, the green circles represent individual 
events in the scenario, and the lines represent the connections between the agents and the 
events. 

You'll notice there are agents with no connections to any events. They represent nodes 
that were connected to the scenario but not to the particular events of the Summit 
timeline.

270Lesson 2: Creating A New Meta-Network 

These lessons will give you the information in order to create a Meta-Network from data 
you have on-hand. 

270.1 Lesson -101 

This section describes the process of looking over your data and deciding what is relavent 
for inclusion into a Meta-Network. It takes the examples I used for the Stargate dataset. 

270.2 lessons - 201-207 

A step by step run through of creating the Meta-Network from working with Excel, 
exporting data to csv files and finally building a complete Meta-Network. 

270.3 lessons - 301+ 

Lessons dealing with importing data from other programs.

271101 - Examine Your Data 

271.1 General Thoughts 

When you first open up ORA you need to construct a MetaNetwork. But the question is, 
how do you go about this task? 

First, you need to understand what constitutes a MetaNetwork. The basic building blocks 
of all MetaNetworks is a Node*. Similar nodes are combined to build NodeSets*. 
NodeSets are combined to make Networks*. Multiple networks are combined to create a 
MetaNetwork*. 

It is up to you on HOW to construct the individual NodeSets and Networks and how to 
combine the Networks into a MetaNetwork. This means you need to gather as much 
information regarding the scenario as possible (who, what, when, where, and how) 
Knowing as much about the scenario as possible is important. Information about the 
people involved, where these people were seen, what items they had available and used, 
what they knew, what tasks they performed, what resources are needed to perform those 
tasks, etc. The more relevant information you collect the better your final MetaNetwork 
will be. 

271.1.1.1 For the purpose of creating the Stargate MetaNetwork 
the two-episode story arc (Summit / Last Stand) was choosen 
as the basis for all the nodes, nodesets, and networks. But even 
though the information was clearly on the tv screen, many 
intuitive decisions had to be made. 

271.1.1.2 For the Julius Caesar MetaNetwork both the play and 
spark notes were used as reference. As with the Stargate 
MetaNetwork many decisions were made about how to create 
datasets and what connexions would be required. 

I found that for the help file using a set of data where you know all the answers helps. But 
that won't always be the case. If you already know what the results are supposed to be 
then it's easy to build a correct Meta-Network. 

But the most important part of this is it helps you to learn what to look for. You'll initially 
make mistakes but if you instantly jump into creation mode then, well, since you're not 
sure how to build this in the first place then how can you be sure your Meta-Networks are 
built correctly in the first place? 

271.1.1.3 Initially the Stargate MetaNetwork was built with both 
the allies and the badGuys. This appeared to be the best way 
and it looked good displayed in the visualizer. But it was 
discovered that having the badGuys interfered with getting 
proper information from the reports. It wasn't until after the 
badGuys were removed that reports began to make more 
sense. What looks good in the beginning ISN'T necessarily 
your best option. 


486 



271.2 What’s in a Node Class 


There are six major classes: Agents, Location, Events, Tasks, Knowledge, and 
Resources.. Nearly everything will fall into one of these six class. ORA contains the 
ability to create new Node Classes but in most cases that's entirely unnecessary because 
most of ORA measures are designed to work with most common six classes metioned 
above. 

271.2.1.1 With Stargate the agents were easy. The Stargate 
personnel, the Tok'ra, and some assorted others. The locations 
also were easy using scenes form the show. It was the events, 
knowledge, resources, and tasks which became slightly more 
difficult to discern. There were multiple false starts (missing 
some events, unnecessary locations, misplaced 
knowledge/resources) before I came to a proper conclusion. 
Initially I created extra Nodesets (like faction & groups). This 
did nothing but clutter up the MetaNetwork and make finding 
information much harder. 

271.2.1.1.1 The Julius Caesar Agent Node Set was also easy using the cast 
of characters but it too had it's construction problems. Julius 
Caesar had limited resources so knowledge and resources were 
essentially combined into one NodeSet called knowledge. 

NodeSets can be either binary (0 or 1) or numbered (negative #, 0 or positive #). A 
MetaNetwork can contain a combination of the two. 

When building Node Classes and Networks (and then onward to MetaNetworks) you'll 
discover that many networks are are very apparent while others were almost invisible. 
You'll have some large networks while others may be extremely small. But all networks 
are necessary to produce the complete MetaNetwork. 

And the depth of the Node Classes can be extended by affixing attributes* to them. 

271.2.1.2 Stargate uses attributes to give extra information such as 
an agent's gender or time of death or the order in which 
events happened. 

271.2.1.2.1 Use the Julius Caesar attributes alligence and persuasion as a 
control mechanism to show the strength which various agents use 
these attributes. 

271.3 Agents (Who) 

It's usually best to start out by constructing the Agent NodeSet. This helps reveal many 
facets of the rest of the MetaNetwork. Gather all possible information about the Whos 
involved. Agents are the persons involved Stargates' daniel Jackson & 
jacob_carter_selmac and over at Julius Caesar Brutus and 1st Commoner. 


487 



271.3.1.1 The Stargate NodeSet contains a mere 16 agents. 
Originally I plotted both the allies and badGuys but found 
there was too much clutter and unnecessary nodes. Removing 
the badGuys helped streamline the NodeSet. 

271.3.1.1.1 The Julius Caesar NodeSet came in with more than twice as 
many. Unlike the Stargate NodeSet all of the characters were 
necessary. Everybody was plotting against everybody else. 

After you've collected all the agents involved you can proceed to creating your first 
network. Figure out which agents had any contact the situation and place a "1" in the 
corresponding cell. Depending on the particular circumstances you will have to establish 
criteria for an association. An Agent x Agent network creates a Square Network meaning 
the names in the rows are identical to the columns. 

271.3.1.2 The Stargate (and Julius Caesar) MetaNetworks were 
fairly easy to construct agent NodeSets and agent by agent 
Networks. Real life data doesn't always come with such an 
easy to see diagram. After a MetaNetwork is constructed it 
very likely that new information will surface which will 
change the face of the current MetaNetwork and, thusly, the 
results of any reports. 

There are three modes of thought in creating connections. 1) The most common would be 
to say if one agent knows another agent then place a 1 in the cell. 2) Next would be to use 
the preceding criteria but to weight the ties where one person could have a higher regard 
for a person more than there are reciprocal feelings. 3) The third would be to use a 
hierarchical style showing who reports to who in a organizational tree situation. It's 
important that the person creating the MetaNetwork makes a call whether there is and and 
how strong a tie will be. 

271.3.1.3 All three of these steps (unfortunately) were gone through 
in the creation of the Stargate MetaNetwork. Initially, using 
only binary data, the logic of the dataset was very fuzzy as to 
the exact nature of many of the connexions. Many of the allies 
knew many of the badGuys on a first name basis. Next 
weighted ties were tried with higher numbers for stronger 
connexions but the results that should have been - just 
weren't. It wasn't until a hierarchical style showing who 
reported to who was used did the results begin to ring true. 

271.3.1.3.1 The Julius Caesar MetaNetwork didn't have the same problems. 

It was apparent from the start that a weighted person-by-person 
network was the key. 

As you learn more about MetaNetworks it becomes easier to see which mode you need to 
use. 


488 



You might not create a MetaNetwork correctly the first time (or the second or the third 
time) if you rush into it. Best to take a little time and review the information before 
heading straight into the creation process. Sometimes too much information will find it's 
way into your MetaNetwork. 

271.3.1.4 On the first run for the Stargate MetaNetwork both the 
allies and the badGuys were placed in the network figuring 
both were needed for proper interaction. And it worked find 
until the reports had some badGuys popping up where they 
actually interfered with the results. So those nodes were 
removed and run the reports a second (or third time). This 
become a waste of time and effort. This solution was to create 
the dataset with only the allies. This then gave more reliable 
information in the reports. 

A little time spent on reviewing the data and any reports will great improve you chances 
of getting it somewhat right in the first place. It will also help in your deciding the best 
way to build your Networks. 

271.3.1.5 Originally, when both allies and badGuys were used, 
weighted ties were used to describe the connexions between 
various nodes. Each connexion between the nodes on the same 
side were individually weighted depending on how they felt 
toward that other node and weights between opposing sides 
were always less than "1". 

271.3.1.5.1 Originally the Network was done with binary ties but was 
changed to weighted ties. 

Remember, you'll always find something that you think needs tweaked as more and more 
information is uncovered. 

271.4 Locations (Where) 

Next create a NodeSet of all the locations involved in the scenario. Locations are places 
like Stargate's earth or revenna or Julius Caesar's battlefield or senate. 

271.4.1.1 For the Stargate MetaNetwork it was a simple matter of 
following the episode and marking down who was in what 
scene. Not quite a simple when you've got less than perfect 
data. 

271.4.1.1.1 Ditto for Julius Caesar If a character was in a scene location 
then a "1" was placed in that character's matrix cell showing he 
was there. 

Create a list of all possible locations and use your best guess as to whether that location is 
important. Remember, just because people are seen in a location doesn't mean it's 
important to the MetaNetwork. You may have a location you think is important initially 
but come to find that nothing happened of interest there (or visa versa). 


489 



271.4.1.2 For the Stargate MetaNetwork it was difficult to focus in 
on the exact locations necessary. The first time only the major 
locations were used, but it was difficult defining specific tasks. 
Then all locations were added but it ended up have many 
isolates and pendants that became unnecessary. 

271.4.1.2.1 For the Julius Caesar MetaNetwork there was the scene on the 
battlefield and various sub-scenes in individual battle-tents. It was 
decided to combine all the battle-tent scenes together. Individual 
tasks would be used to sort out the MetaNetwork. 

271.5 Events (When) 

Creating an Events NodeSets is a little more difficult than for either agents or locations. 
Agents and locations are tangible items whereas events are intangible. They also depend 
on the interpretation of the individual creating the NodeSet. Events can include items like 
Stargate's summit_meeting and gate_attack or Julius Caesar's Brutus speaks to citizens 
and Funeral of Julius Caesar. 

271.5.1.1 Many of the events in Summit scenario were easy (the 
meetings, the summit, the attack). But others were a little 
harder to discern. Initially there were a mere eight events. But 
shortly after it was found to be inadequate. After a quick re¬ 
adjustment he number of events doubled. 

When plotting events it is sometimes necessary to show what order they occurred. What 
happened first, second, third, and so on. This helps discern which agents are needed in 
which parts of the scenario. 

271.5.1.2 In the Stargate MetaNetwork the event sequence shows 
the beginning event was the tollana_attack. This led to the 
sgc_meeting and onto the revenna_meeting. There the 
sequence split into two branches eventually both converging in 
on gate_attack. 

To create an ordered event x event network start with the row of earliest event. Place a 
checkmark in the column for the next event. Find the row for the column you just 
checkmarked. Follow that to the column with the next event. Proceed in this manner till 
you have all your events. You may, as happened in the Stargate Network, that two events 
sprout from a single event. They may, or may not. converge back to an ending. 

271.6 Tasks (How) 

Tasks are things that are done by the agents such as Stargate's replaceJarren and 
poison_summit and Julius Caesar's Kill Caesar and Attend Senate. 


490 



A task network can be set up to show the order that tasks need to be done in order for the 
scenario to be played out. For example, procuring materials to build something is always 
necessary before building something but not necessarily before planning. This is usually 
done with a directed graph (i.e. a link from procuring to building but not the other way 
around). 

271.6.1.1 As in the example of Events above certain tasks need to 

be completed before others can be started. Stargate uses a 
binary, directed network showing a pathway of which tasks 
are required to be completed before the next task can be 
started. create_poison, inflitrate_yu World, and 

create_memory_drug all needed done before 
present_plan_to_sgc. But none of this could have taken place 
without get_reole_chemical leading to the 
create_memory_drug. 

Tasks are exclusively attached to agents. You can't have a location, event, etc. performing 
a task. But this is not to say that you can't have a task attahced to a location as it might 
necessarily need to be done at a certain location. 

271.6.1.2 daniel_jackson could only perform the task 
poison_summit at the location hasaraSystem_spaceStation as 
that's where the event summit_meeting took place. He could 
not have done poison_summit on revenna or yu_homeworld. 

271.7 Knowledge (What) 

Many times more than one person knows the same thing. And other times there is a 
single person who has some vital knowledge. This is a way to help find out if one person 
is completely indispensable or whether there are other pathways to accomplishing the 
goal. 

271.7.1.1 In the Stargate MetaNetwork there are some knowledge 
which many agents have. But there are also some knowledge 
that only one person has. And if that person is taken out of the 
picture then the plan fails to materialize. 

271.7.1.2 Another situation is two people both having knowledge 
but it's much more important to one than the other. Both 
danieljackson and jacob_carter_selmak use spying but it's 
clear that jacob_carter_selmak is better at it than 
daniel Jackson. 

271.8 Resources (What) 

Resources can be very similar to knowledge and many times these two overlap. It's not 
necessary to always have both. 


491 



271.8.1.1 The Stargate MetaNetwork is was very necessary to 
separate the two as sometimes it was necessary to have 
knowledge regarding a resource before you could actually use 
that resource. Before Daniel could use the symbiote poison or 
the memory-altering drug he was required to have the 
knowledge of how the devices operated. 

271.8.1.1.1 In the Julius Caesar MetaNetwork there was no real reason to 
separate knowledge and resources. The resource NodeSet was 
simply not used for this dataset as it would have been redundant. 
There is no such constraint on learning how a dagger worked in 
Julius Caesar. 

Most of the Measures that can be run on knowledge have a corresponding measure that 
runs on resources. So some Meta-Network can eliminate one or the other. 

271.9 Networks 

After creating all your NodeSets you then move on to creating Networks. Every 
MetaNetwork will require a slightly different set of NodeSets and Networks. Below are 
the Stargate and the Julius Caesar NodeSets. The NodeSets in bold/italic are not 
contained in the other MetaNetwork. 

271.9.1.1 The Stargate NodeSet consisted of: agent x agent, agent x 
event, agent x knowledge, agent x location, agent x resource, 
agent, x tasks, event x event, event x resource, knowledge x 
tasks, tasks x event, tasks x tasks 

271.9.1.1.1 The Julius Caesar NodeSet consisted of: agent x agent, agent x 
event, agent x knowledge, agent x location, agent x tasks, event x 
event, knowledge x tasks, location x location, task x event, task x 
task. 

Notice that the two are almost identical but Stargate contains Networks for the Resource 
NodeSets. The Julius Caeasar used a location x location network. 

271.10 Difference between the two MetaNetworks 

The big difference was the construction of the agent x agent network. Julius Caesar was a 
weighted matrix with connexions to everyone an agent knew. The Stargate agent x agent 
network used a hierarchical method showing who reported to who. 

Another difference was the lack of a resource nodeset in Julius Caesar. There was no 
need as all that was placed under knowledge. Stargate, on the other-hand required 
separate knowledge and resources as it was sometimes necessary to have a certain 
knowledge before using a certain resource. 

The two datasets are very similar, most of the major NodeSets are contained in both. But 
the circumstances for each are unique which requires a slightly different set of NodeSets. 


492 



272201 - Excel and CSV 


You learned from Meta-Network 101 about how to survey your data, the different forms 
it can take, and how to make it a fit for ORA. In this lesson we'll go through the 
procedure of creating a Meta-Network using the Stargate dataset in some practical 
examples. 

272.1 Your first NodeSet 

Your first NodeSet will more than likely be an Agent NodeSet since all other nodesets 
are either referred to/or by the agent nodeset. Review you data and make a list of the 
people involved. 

272.1.1.1 After watching the Summit/Last Stand episodes (a couple 
times) and reading various reviews on the storyline I came up 
with 16 agent nodes. My first thought was to only use the 
people involved in the assassination plot (The SGC and the 
Tok'ra) but found that two of the Gou'ald had vital 
interactions with the the team members. 

What program should be used to create the information? 

You need a program that can create .csv files that your system can read. Microsoft Excel 
is an excellent choice as it has good copy/paste features, multiple spreadsheets in one 
files, and known compatibility with ORA. 

The examples in the rest of this lesson will be using Excel in OSX. 

272.1.1.1.1 NOTE to MAC users: If you use Excel for OSX beware that 
there are two options for saving as a .csv. The first one you see on 
the list is the Mac-compatible version. You need to go lower on the 
list to find CSV (WINDOWS) option to save in a format compatible 
with ORA on Windows. 

The agent NodeSet was created with IDs A01, A02, A03,... A16 and the names of the 
agents were put in a column called agent. The order of the agents does not matter as long 
as you keep the relationship between IDs and agents consistent throughout your work. 
The IDs are what allows ORA to match various files. 

272.1.1.2 Column A contains my IDs A01, A02,... A16 and column 
B contains the names of all the agents in my Agent NodeSet. 

272.1.1.2.1 NOTE: I use A01 instead of A1 preferring to prefix the zero to 
the numbers less than ten. This assists when doing a sort within the 
editor. If you think that you will have a NodeSet with more than 100 
nodes then use A001, A002,...

272.2 Your first Network 


A 

▼ 

//. 


Now that the agent NodeSet is done the next item is to create an agent x agent Network. 
As described in Meta-Network 101 just how your agents interact with one another is 
subjective to the type of Network you have. 

Insert a new spreadsheet in Excel and place the agent IDs running down in column A 
starting with row 2 and the same set of agent IDS in row 1 starting with column B. Then 
place your link values for the agent by agent connexions in this matrix. 

272.2.1.1 The Stargate example was done with a hierarchical 
method showing the chain of command. Nodes A02, A03, & 
A04 represent maj_samantha_carter, danieljackson, & teal'c 
who all report to colJack_o'neill (node A01), leader of SG-1. 
jack_o'neill reports directly to gen_hammond (node All), 
danielJackson, & teal'c, both being civilians, also report to 
gen_hammond and thusly have two links in the chain of 
command. maj_samantha_carter, being military, directly 
reports to her team leader, coljack o'neill.

272.3 The rest of the NodeSets and Networks 


Next you have to decide what other NodeSets you need... 

272.3.1.1 I created Stargate NodeSets for events: important events 
during the course of the scenario, knowledge: important 
information necessary for the completion of the mission, 
resource: material objects important to the mission, location: 
where particular events took place, and tasks: specific jobs for 
the completion of the mission. 

...and how these NodeSets need to interact with each other. 

272.3.1.2 For Stargate_summit I decided I needed: agent x agent, 
agent x event, agent x knowledge, agent x resource, agent x 
task, event x event, event x resource, knowledge x task, 
resource x taks, task x event, and task x task. 

Each Meta-Network will require different handling and may require more or less 
networks. 

Then, as done in the agent x agent network, decide how the various nodes interact 
with each other for each Network. When finished you will have one spreadsheet 
from which you can create all your .csv files. 

272.3.1.2.1 NOTE: I keep all my spreadsheets in one file for easy access. 

One set for the NodeSets and the other set for the Networks. 


knowledgeNodeSet _ resource Node Set _ locationNodeSEt _ taskHod£5et _ AxA _ AxE _ AxK _ AxL _ A;:

272.4 Saving as .CSV files 


The next step is to convert these Excel file to a format that ORA can import, namely the 
.csv format. This is easily done with Excel's Save As... function. Select the Excel 
spreadsheet you want to convert to CSV. From the Excel main menu select File => Save 
As.... Navigate to the directory to save your fde, from the drop down menu select the csv 
format, and hit OK. Opening up this file in a text editor will reveal it's new format. 

272.4.1.1.1 NOTE to OSX Users: Remember to use the CSV (WINDOWS) 
option or else ORA will not properly recognize these csv files. 



You can now convert all your Excel spreadsheets to CSV files in preparation for 
importing into ORA. 


496 









273202 - Import into ORA 


NOTE: If you are visiting this page from the help section on the Data Import Wizard, 
what follows is a series of lessons using the Data Import tool with the Star gate sample 
data set. You can start from the very beginning of this lesson by going to the preceding 
Meta-Networks 101 lesson) 

Now that we've got the Excel spreadsheets created and converted to .csv 
files it's time to learn abougt importing a CSV file into ORA. 

273.1 Starting a new Meta-Network 

From the main menu of ORA, select File => Data Import Wizard or hit Ctrl-O. For thse 
lessons we will be using only the first three options in this dialog box. With these you can 
open up both the table data and network data you created in Excel and work with 
attributes. 


Select the type of data import: 

(~) Create a meta-network from separate network files 
Q Create a meta-network from table data 
O Import node attributes from table data 


We’ll start with Create a meta-network from separate network files:. This will import a 
.csv file in the form of a matrix with labels on the X and Y axis (i.e. an agent by agent 
graph or resource by event and link data in the body). 

273.1.1.1 Below are the first four nodes of the 
stargate_agent_x_agent.csv file. 

A01 A02 A03 A04 

A01 0 0 0 0 

A02 1 0 0 0 

A03 1 0 0 0 

A04 1 0 0 0 


497 




The second option, Create a neta-network from table data: is used to import a .csv file in 
the form of a table (i.e. attribute data into a NodeSet). 

273.1.1.2 Below are the first four nodes of the 
stargate_agentNodeSet.csv file. 

id title gender 

A01 col jack_o'neill male 

A02 maj_samantha_carter female 
A03 danielJackson male 

A04 teal'c male 

Select the Create a meta-network from separate network files radio button to create a 
Network and NodeSet. Then select the [Next] button. On the next screen select Create a 
new meta-network with ID: radio button (see below) and tab over to the textbox. Type in 
the name for the new Meta-Network then select the [Next] button at the bottom of the 
box. 


Select a destination: a new Meta-Network, or adding to an existing Meta-Network. 
® Create a new meta-network with ID: 

Add to the existing meta-network: 


stargate 


Select the [Browse] button and navigate to the directory with the saved .csv files. Select 
the agent x agent .csv file created earlier. In the two drop down menus select the types of 
nodes you are using. In this case both the Source type: and Target type: will be agent. In 
the Network ID: field, name the network (typically for this it would be agent x agent). 
The [ + ] button is used for adding more than one network (which will be explained in the 
next section). When all parts are completed, select the [Finish] button. 



Highlighting either the Agent: size 16 or the agent x agent line in Panel 1 and selecting 
the Editor tab will reveal the imported data.

You could, if you wanted, do each Network one at a time. But to save time you can 
import all your .csv files simultanously with the Data Import Wizard. For each new 
Network file to import, browse for the .csv file, define the Source Type: and the Target 
type:, and use the [ + ] button to add another row as needed. This can continue until you 
have listed all the Networks you want to import. 

NOTE: If at any time you want to remove a Network from the list select the [ - ] 
underneath its Network ID:. 


499 





































When you have selected all your .csv node x node files select the [Finish] button. The 
result in Panel 1 is shown when I imported the 11 remaining Networks which in turn 
created six new NodeSets.

You could import all of your CSV Network files at one time and ORA will create all your 
NodeSets and Networks. Currently these NodeSets have no titles or attribute names. 
That's the next step in the process. 


501 





















274203 - Attributes 


NOTE : If you are visiting this page from the Data Import Wizard, what follows is a 
lesson on adding attributes to the Stargate sample data set provided with ORA. To begin 
the lesson from the very beginning go to Meta-Networks 101. 

All the NodeSets have been created when the Networks were imported. But without 
naming the individual nodes and without any attributes for those nodes it's very limited in 
it's information. Attributes help define nodes as individuals by designating what is special 
about each node. 

274.1 The Special Attribute, "Title" 

All attributes give information about the node they're attached to. But the title attribute is 
special. After importing the title attribute to a NodeSet it will lend this title to all 
Networks that use this NodeSet. 

NOTE: In the Stargate Nodeset the title attribute consists of the character's names. This 
is the standard operating procedure but exactly what you use as the title is entirely up to 
you. 

Currently the NodeSet and Networks created only contain IDs which are not very easy 
for discerning who is who. 

Below is an example using the first four nodes from the Stargate agent NodeSet (left) and 
the agent x agent Network (right). Truly this needs more definition

Once again data needs to be imported to give it some meaning. But in this example the 
second option, Create a meta-network from table data will be used as we want to import 
attribute data for the NodeSet, not Network linking data. 

First let's add one attribute, the special title attribute. From the main menu select. File => 
Import Data Wizard. From the dialog box select the radio button labeled Create a meta¬ 
network from table data. In the previous section the option to import a Network was used 
to import network data but here we only want to import specific columnar data. Select the 
[Next] button. 


502 























Select the type of data import: 

0 Create a meta-network from separate network files 
0 Create a.meta-netwo^ 

Since the Stargate Meta-Network is already created we want to use Add to the existing 
meta-network:. Actitivate the corresponding radio button and from the drop down menu 
select the correct Meta-Network to add the new attributes to. When done, select the 
[Next] button. 


Select a destination: a new Meta-Network, or adding to an existing Meta-Network. 
0 Create a new meta-network with ID: 

0 Add to the existing meta-network:

Istargate-summit-org 


stargate 


Below is the main dialog box to inform ORA what and how to import the new attributes. 
After the image is a description of each of the numbered steps. 


503 

















1. The [Browse] button allows you to navigate to the directory where the table data 
is held. Once a file is selected, hit the [OK] button and the file will be displayed in 
the textbox to the left. 

2. This sections gives the options for how ORA will search the new dataset. Placing 
a checkmark in the box alerts ORA to use this column to match up the data in a 
NodeSet. The Type: drop down menu selects the type of NodeSet it is. The Make 
unique checkbox will sequentially number any duplicate names in the column 
checked, (i.e. three nodes named tom become tom-1, tom-2, & tom-3) 

3. There are four ways to define and import attribute data. In this example select the 
Attribute tab. 

4. There are three dropdowns (for selecting Node IDs, Attribute Values, amd 
Attribute Type) and a textbox (for specifiying the Atribute name). 

o The Node IDs reflects the choices made in step 2 and its dropdown will 
contain all the checkmarks you placed in the boxes. With only one 
checkbox marked in Step 1 there is only one choice in this drop down. If 
more Node IDs were choosen in Step 2, then this drop down would 
contain them all. 

o Attribute Values contains all the names in the header row of the selected 
open file. 


504 

































































o Value Type gives you two choices: Categorical: which uses a finite set of 
values (i.e. gender: male/female) - and Continuous: which can contain an 
infinite number of choices (continuous implies numerical). The most 
common selection with Categorical. 

5. The [New] button creates a new row to import another atribute. The [Clear] clears 
the data... ALL THE DATA! 

6. The checkbox Create new nodes for unrecognized IDs allow for creating new 
nodes that aren't currently in the NodeSet. If a node appears in the data being 
imported that does not appear in the NodeSet choosen then ORA will only insert a 
new node if this checkbox is marked. For now we'll make sure it's unchecked. 

NOTE: The [Clear] button clears ALL data in that particular tab. 


505 



When finished entering information on this screen, select [Finish]. The NodeSet now 
contains names that match up to the IDs from the imported file.

274.2 Adding other Attributes and Values 


Now that the title attribute is in place the rest of the attributes can now be imported. This 
will be done in the same manner but all the attributes from a table file can be imported 
simultanously. 



In this case all the available attributes were imported by first selecting the [New] button 
then selecting from the drop down menus the Node IDs, Attribute Values and the Value 
Type. The entry was finished off by giving it a name in the Attribute Name column. 
When all the entries were finished the [Finish] button was pressed. 


507 


































































And the NodeSet is complete with Entity IDs, Entity Names, and the Attributes imorted 
from the dataset.

This procedure can be followed for each NodeSet in the Meta-Network in order to Name 
the nodes and attach any attributes. 


508 






















275204 - Modifying a Meta-Network 


At this point the Meta-Network has been created and it contains the NodeSets and 
Networks. And each of the NodeSets contains titles and attributes in which to better 
define the NodeSets and Networks. But as with any dataset there will always be changes. 
Most certainly, as time goes on, NodeSets will require extra attributes or even new nodes. 
Possibly even new NodeSets will need to be created and worked into the Meta-Network. 
Or maybe a current set of attributes needs to be changed. What follows are the procedures 
to accomplish those tasks. 

275.1 Step 1: Adding a New Node 

In this section we'll add a new node to the agent NodeSet using the Create new nodes 
from unrecognized IDs checkbox. It's for the situation that the data being imported 
contains nodes that are not in the current NodeSet. 

The new .csv file we're using contains one new set of information, the 17th agent to add 
to the agent NodeSet. Upon importing the new node we will have a 17th node with the 
title attribute. 

id,title,position,symbiote,host,dies_when,dies,ally,group,servitude,gender,race,race-2 

A17,zipacna„zipacna,unknown,„no,anubis,anubis,male,gou'ald,human 

It was created in Excel file (the same way the other NodeSets and Networks were) and 
exported out to a new .csv file called stargate_zipacna.csv. 


509 



Call up the Data Import Wizard. Again, use the Create meta-network from table data 
option, then Add to the existing meta-network:. Chose your network from the drop down 
menu. The Import Data into ORA box will appear. 



1. Navigate to the directory where you placed the new .csv file. It will show up in 
the textbox to the left. 

2. Check the proper column to use for the node ID and from the drop down menu 
select the type of node. 

3. Select the Attribute tab. Then select the Node ID to use as reference, the Attribute 
Value to import, the Value Type (Categorical or Continuous). Finally, give it a 
name in Attribute Name. (For this example we'll be bringing in the "title" 
attribute). 

4. And most importantly, make sure the box Create new nodes for unrecognized IDs 
contains a checkmark in order to allow ORA to create new nodes. Without this 
checkmark ORA will ignore any nodelDs that aren't already in the NodeSet. 


510 












































When you review your agent NodeSet in the editor you will see a new entry at the 
bottom, the 17th node with zipacna in the Entity Title attribute.

Now we move on to importing the other attributes for this new nodes. 


511 


























275.2 Step 2: Importing the Attributes 


The new .csv file created previously to create the new node will now be used to import 
the rest of the attributes. 

Call up File => Data Import Wizard. This time we need to use the function Import node 
attributes from table data. This allows ORA to fill in the attribute values for the selected 
node(s) in the file. Then select the [Next] button. 


O Create a meta-network from separate network files 
o Create a meta-network from table data 
® ^rnp;C!rt ncide a11ributes; f;rc;rn table dat ; =d 


Next, make sure there is a checkmark only next to the Meta-Network you want to import 
into. When done, select the [Next] button. 



512 


































1. Using the [Browse] button navigate to the directory with the csv file containing 
the information for the new node. 

2. In Step 1: choose how ORA will detect the new information. Use this column for 
node IDs: allows the user to pick which column to use and The rows are in the 
same order as the node class assumes that your data is in the same order as it is in 
ORA. For importing a single new node, or Nodesets that aren't in the same order, 
leave it on the first choice. 

3. In Step 2: you choose which attributes to import and denote its value type. For 
any attributes not to be imported, remove the checkmark next to it's name. 

4. Below this are buttons for [Select All>] and [Clear All] which do exactly as they 
say, select or remove all checkmarks. 

5. The checkbox, Create new nodes for unrecognized IDs:, which allows ORA to 
create new nodes for IDs not present in the selected NodeSet. 

6. Finally in Step 3: select the NodeSet to import the new nodes into. 

Below shows the before and after for the new node for Zipacna. All the data from the .csv 
file has been imported into the ORA NodeSet.

276205 - Working with SubSets 


There will be times when you have a SubSet of a larger Meta-Network and you'll want to 
import data from a larger, main dataset. And you want to do this without creating new 
nodes. What follows are the procedures for accomplishing those goals. 

276.1.1.1 We start off with the SubSet of SG-1 team and the SGC 
commanding officer, a Meta-Network of five agents.

Now, as before, navigate to the directory with your dataset, select the column with your 
node ID, select the Attribute tab and create new Attributes using the [New] button, and 
finally, the most important part, remove the checkmark from the box next to Create new 
nodes for unrecognized IDs. Its the removing of this checkmark that will prevent ORA 
from creating extra nodes and only import data for the nodes in the selected NodeSet. 



The result is maintaining a NodeSet with five nodes but attribute data imported only for 
the five nodes in the NodeSet. No new nodes will be created in this process.

277206 - Attribute Columns 


There are three functions that can done with Attributes: 1) Edit and Attribute name; 2) 
edit Attribute type, and; 3) Delete an Attribute. 

All three are accomplished by Right-clicking on the Attribute Name to bring up the 
contextual menu. 


Edit Attribute Name 
Edit Attribute Type 
Delete Attribute 


Edit Attribute Name 

Used for renaming an existing Attribute column. 

Edit Attribute Type 

Attributes can be tagged with two types: Categorical or Continuous. 

Delete Attribute 

Removes an Attribute column from a NodeSet. 

277.1 Replacing an Attribute Column 

NOTE: This method is suggested as ORA has the capability of retaining multiple values. 
If you want to completely replace the values then deletion and replacement of the column 
is suggested. 

For most small changes you can type in a new attribute value or two directly into the 
Editor. But say your NodeSet contained quite a few nodes, and the majority of the values 
needed changed. If might be easier to create a new .csv file and import the values in just 
as in the previous lesson. In the example below it was decided to completely replace all 
the skill needed with a new set of values. 


516 



Go to the ORA main interface and select the NodeSet. Then select with the attribute 
column you want to change. Right-click on the attribute name which brings up the 
contextual menu. Select Delete Attribute to remove it from the NodeSet.

After deleting a column then use the procedure for importing Attributes from Lesson-203 
to import a new attribute information. Remember, you'll want to import into an Existing 
Meta-Network as in the example above.

278207 - Updating Your Data Files 


After importing data from the .csv files into ORA and then altering the data in ORA this 
somewhat makes your original data files out-of-date. 

What follows are the procedures to update your original .csv and Excel files with any 
changes that have been made recently. 

278.1 Saving Your Network Data 


From the main interface highlight the Network you want to save and Right-Click. This 
will bring up a contextual menu. Select Save Network. 




agent x ex- 
agent x kn 
agent x loc 
agent x re 
agent x ta 
event x ex-

■s^r* Add Blank Network... 

— Remove Selected Network 
Set Diagonal... 

Fold Network... 


Save Network... 


Binarize Network ^ 
Remove Edges... 
Symmetrize... 


This will bring up a Save dialog box. First, navigate to the directory you want to save 
your new Network file. Next, select the format (DyNetML, UCINET, DL, or CSV) to 
save the file. Give it a filename and select [Save]. 



UCINET 

DL 


CSV 


518 










































Saving to each of the four formats creates five files. 

278.1.1 REMEMBER: The UCINET uses both ,##d and .##h 
extensions and both are needed to build a Meta-Network. 


• 1 starqate agent x agent. 

-■ 1 star gat e_agent_x_agent.##h 
stargate_agent_x_agent, cs v 

^ stargate_agent_x_agent.xml 


NOTE: Since this Save box does not display the files present in the directory it is Highly 
Suggested that you save to a new directory and verify which previous file you want to 
replace. More information on these file formats can be found HERE 

278.2 Saving Your Attribute Data 

The above mentioned procedure works well for saving Networks but there are also the 
attributes in the NodeSets to think about. All the data is can be saved from File => Save 
Meta-Network and the File => Save Meta-Network.... But this saves the data into one 
xml file. What if you what to save the data into individual files, the same as when you 
imported it. 

The quickest way is using the Copy / Paste method. Values copied directly from the Main 
Interface Editor can be pasted into a Excel spreadsheet. 

In the ORA editor, highlight the cells you need to copy. Use either Ctrl-C or Edit => 
Copy Editor Values.

Then switch to your Excel spreadsheet. Highlight the cell that corresponds to the top/left 
cell you started with in ORA and use either Ctrl-V or Edit => Paste. Entire NodeSets can 
be done in this fashion.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Before you Copy/Paste in this manner make sure your columns are 
in the same order. This operation will NOT match up data as it's a blind copy/paste 
operation. 


You can then backup all of your NodeSets in the procedure and then re¬ 
save it to your .cvs files. 


520 













279301 - Import Analyst Notebook 


What follows are procedures to import data from 12 (Analyst Notebook): 

The data needs to be exported from 12 into comma-separated or tab-separated files. There 
is one file for nodes and another for links. 

Both of these files need to be custom imported because 12 allows the user to have custom 
fields - they are not fixed, and so the importer needs to provide ORA with information in 
order to import. 


521 



280Lesson 3: Key Entity Report 

280.1 The Reports 

A Key Entity Report creates the following reports: central actors, organizations, central 
knowledge, resources, central events, tasks, central locations, and performance indicators. 
The Key Entity Report can either run its measures over the entire network or be refined 
or filtered to run them over only a select portion of the network. 

More detailed information regarding the basic workings of the Key Entity Report screens 
can be found Reports Section. 

280.2 Running a Key Entity Report: 

We'll be using the network Stargate: Summit contains all the agents involved in the 
scenario, friend and foe. The first report run will contain all the agents, friend and foe. 

• From the main mennu select Analysis => Generate Reports which brings up the 
Generate Reports dialog box. 

• At the top of the window is a dropdown menu titled Select a Report. Pull down 
the menu by clicking the small inverted arrow icon to its right, and select Key 
Entity. 

• In the box titled Select one or more meta matrices: select the network to run the 
report on. 

• At the bottom of the box is the Transform options. 

o General Mathematical Transformation : Contains various formulas for 
manipulating a network. 

o Remove Entities : Remove node(s) from a network before running the 
measures. 

o Partition entities into separate meta matrices by attribute value : Create 
new networks based on your choice of nodes and attributes. 


522 




Select the [Next >] button at the bottom of the dialog box. 



The next dialog box is for selecting the number of ranked nodes, critical attribute and 
values and also for selecting which reports you want to view. I am only interested in the 
top five nodes in the network and place a 5 in the top box. I don't want to point out any 
particular nodes, only the friends, so I'll leave the textbox blank. I want all the reports run 
so I place a checkmark in all four boxes. 

Click the [Next >] button. 


523 




































































The last dialog box is for selecting what type of format for the final reports and the 
directory to place them. Text will create reports that will appear in Panel 3 of the 
interface, HTML* creates reports that will open up your browser, and CSV* creates files 
that are usable in ORA. The bottom section allows you to navigate to a directory where 
you want to save your files. 

280.3 Remove Nodes from a Key Entity Report: 

Next we'll look at removing nodes from the report. The network Stargate: Summit 
contains both the friends and foes in the scenario. But say you only want to see only how 
the friendly agents interacted. Being that there's an ally attribute this will make it simple 
to eliminate the foe agents. 

Follow the same procedure as above except click in the Remove entities radio button. 


524 
















In this example we're going to eliminate a portion of the network before we run the 
measures. Select the Remove entities button. Then select the [Next >] button at the 
bottom of the dialog box. 


525 


































In this dialog box you can select exactly which nodes to remove. 



The top section, Filter Commands, allows you to create a single filter or compound them 
and force it to Match all filters. 

The bottom sections contains tabs which further allow you to refine your filter. There is a 
tab for each nodeset in your network. 

I only want to run the measures on the Allies so I select the agent tab, scroll over to the 
ally tab, and in the dropdown menu I select no. This will call up all the non-ally agents. I 
then click the [Select All] button which places a checkmark in each box effectively 
removing them from the network. 

Click the [Next >] button. 


526 





































































The next dialog box is for selecting the number of ranked nodes, critical attribute and 
values and also for selecting which reports you want to view. I am only interested in the 
top five nodes in the network and place a 5 in the top box. I don't want to point out any 
particular attributes so I'll leave the textbox blank. 

Click the [Next >] button. 



527 



















































The last dialog box is for selecting what type of format for the final reports and the 
directory to place them. Text will create reports that will appear in Panel 3 of the 
interface, HTML* creates reports that will open up your browser, and CSV* creates files 
that are usable in ORA. The bottom section allows you to navigate to a directory where 
you want to save all your files. 

280.4 Comparison of the two reports 

As the reports are rather large, let's compare a small portion of cognitive effort from the 
reports. 


All agents 

Rank Value Agent 


Allies-only 
Rank Value Agent 


1 0.340911 jacob_carter_selmak 1 

2 0.257479 ren’al 2 

3 0.248333 danieljackson 3 

4 0.205698 olokun 4 

5 0.205698 morrigan 5 


0.354626 jacob_carter_selmak 
0.284762 danieljackson 
0.284218 ren’al 
0.166667 maj_samantha_carter 
0.164218 teal'c 


The left-hand column shows all nodes, including the non-allies olokun and morrigan. But 
after eliminating the non-allies two friendly agents take their place. You'll also notice that 
danieljackson and ren'al swapped places. With various links removed, after eliminating 
the non-allies, the order of the remaining nodes can shift. It should also be noticed that 
the rating for jacob_carter_selmak has increased elevating his position as Emergent 
Leader.

281 Lesson 5: Over-Time Analysis 

281.1 Performing a View Network Over-Time Analysis 

What follows are procedures to perform a View Network Over Time and View Measures 
Over Time Analysis. 

To either requires multiple network datasets representative of your network over different 
time periods. The goal is to analyze how a network changes across multiple time periods. 
The time period is determined by the intervals of collected network data and presented as 
multiple Meta-Networks, which are loaded into ORA in sequential order. The steps 
below provide detailed instruction on how type of analysis. 

To perform a View Network Over-Time Analysis, you must load Meta-Networks that 
relate to different time captures of your network data, which need to be in the form of 
multiple Meta-Networks. 

In the following example, we will use network time captures of the 1998 Embassy 
Bombing in Tanzania Meta-Network data set and compare the same data set as we knew 
it in 1997 and 1996 and 1998. We will then compare all the Meta-Networks in the 
Network Over-Time Viewer to gain a visual representation of how this network changed 
between 1996 and 1998. 

Note: For our purposes, we have changed data in this example and have renamed the 
Meta-Network for three different years. This will denote different network variables that 
have changed over time. 

You will see in the left window pane under input dataset three Meta-Networks, 1998, 
1997, and 1996, have been loaded. 


529 



From the menu bar: File => Open Meta Network 


x: 


Use this wizard to import any type of data into Ora. 

The supported file types are: dynetml (native Ora xml format^ 
,d\ } .##h (UCINet); .csv (Excel format), .txtj .raw, .net (Pajek), 
.graphml, and .stl (GMU Model). 

Select one or more files below to begin.

You will see all of our example data sets, which will load simultaneously into ORA, buy 
highlighting and selected all the files. 

281.1.1.2 Highlight all files you analyze in Over-Time Viewer. 
Press [Enter]. 



The import data window will appear (below). This will confirm the files you wish to 
analyze.

281.1.1.3 Select [Finish]. 


531 



































All three Meta-Networks should display in Panel 1. 



281.2 Performing the Over-Time Analysis 

Now that we have time captures of our network data represented and loaded into ORA in 
the form of three Meta-Networks relating to 1996, 1997 and 1998, we can perform the 
Over-Time Analysis. 

281.2.1.1 From the Menu Bar => Data Visualization => View 
Network Over-Time 


Data Visualization 


Charts 

Visualizer 

View Measures Over Time 


View Network Over Time 


Drill-Down Window 


GI5 


Loom 


The ORA Visualizer will render all of the loaded Meta-Networks. 

Please take special note of the Time Viewer pop-up Window. This window displays a 
slider, which will allow you to quickly change from the first Meta-Network time capture 
of 1996, to 1997 and 1998 respectively. 


532 





























By moving the slider from one Meta-Network to the next, you will gain a visual 
perspective on how the network has changed over Time. 

The series of screen shots below display how the visualized data changes from one slider 
to position to the next. This allows you a picture of how the network changes Over-Time. 

Please note: Depending on the complexity of the network and the extent to which 
relationships (ties) have changed, the visualization of those changes may be subtle. 

The screen shots below, however, will emphasize the extent to which the role of the 
WTC Event entity has changed from 1996 to 1998 in relation to the network of which it 
is part of namely the Tanzania data set. Below these screen captures, are a series of detail 
screen captures focusing on the WTC Event node.

281.4 Example Slider Position 2 



281.5 Example Slider Position 3

1996, 1997 and 1998 Tanzania Data Sets. 

281.6 WTC Event Node: Detail 1 -1996 



281.7 WTC Event Node: Detail 2 -1997 

281.7.1 Notice who how the relationships of this node to the rest of 
the network has changed from 1996 to 1997. 



535 


























Notice that the connections (links) have changed from 1996 to 


281.7.2 

1997. 



As you can see, as we progress through the data sets pertaining to 1996, 1997 and 1998, 
the event node WTC lost direct ties to other parts of the network. In the 1996 data set, 
WTC had 3 ties to other entities in the Tanzania Embassy network; In 1997, only 2; 
Finally, in 1998, the WTC event node had only 1 link to Tanzania Network. This may 
indicate that the WTC node may have lost importance from one year to the next. 

281.8 Summary of Lesson 

At this point, you should be able to complete the following tasks to perform an Over- 
Time Network Analysis. 

• Load multiple Time Data Captures in the form of Meta-Networks, which are 
representative of your network (Meta-Network) over time. 

• Use the Over-Time slider window tool to move from one time capture to the next. 

• Gain a visual perspective of how your overall network has changed from one time 
capture to the next. 

281.9 Performing the View Measures Over-Time Analysis 

ORA provides an alternative method to analyzing your network data (in the form of 
Meta-Networks captured over time) than the only in the Visualizer. 

By running a View Measures Over Time analysis you can visualize how your network 
changes in relation to any given measure in the form of charts, which take you from one 
time point to the next. 


536 

















Below is a series of screen captures and instruction on how to access the View Measures 
Over Time feature:

CIS 


Loom 


281.9.1.2 Select View Measures Over Time. 



281.9.1.3 Select [OK] 

The View Measure Over Time Window will appear. You will see that this window is 
primarily organized into three sections. 

Area 1: is a slider where you can control various inputs that affect the aggregation level 
of your Meta-Networks. 

Area 2: is a tabbed index allowing you to select the graph level you desire and the 
individual entity sets you are interested in analyzing. 

Area 3: displays the actual chart based on the measures you selected in the tabbed index 
and the position of the aggregation slider. 


537 



















281.10 Interpreting The Results After Performing View Measures Over-Time 
Analysis 

In the example above, we have loaded all three of our network time captures into the 
View Measures Over Time Analysis tool. The result of our analysis, as we have indicated 
before, will be displayed as a chart in the bottom section of the ORA interface in Panel 3. 
But, what does this tell us? To find out, we will examine the Graph Level measure 
Knowledge Waste. From the tabbed measures window: 


538 























281.10.1.1 Graph tab > Congruence, Organization Measure, 
Knowledge Waste. 

The result is displayed below. 



We can see the chart displays an axis scale correlating to our networks over time. The 
graph level measure of Knowledge Waste was selected using the View Measures Over 
Time tool and the result is displayed in the chart area of the window. 

We can see that the graph level measure of Knowledge Waste held a value slightly above 
40 in the first Meta-Network, 1996, displayed with 1 on the Time axis. We can deduce 
from the chart that in 1997 something affected our measure of Knowledge Waste to 
increase the value to nearly 60. This corresponds to the time scale axis of 2, which 
represents 1997, our second year of network data. In the final year, 1998, our measure of 
Knowledge Waste declined to the value in 1996. This should be visually evident with its 
relative line graph position. 

It is clear that the value for the Knowledge Waste Measure increased from the first Meta- 
Network (1996) to the second (1997) and then retreated back to its original (1996) level. 
It would be up to you to determine what may have affected that measure for it to undergo 
this progression and regression. 

281.11 Summary of Lesson 

At this point, you should be able to complete the following tasks to perform a View 
Measures Over-Time Analysis: 


539 






















• Load multiple data files into ORA (in the form of Meta-Networks) representative 
of your network across certain periods of time. 

• Select an aggregation level and choose a graph level or entity set to analyze. 

• Analyze the data output in the charting tool located in the bottom section of the 
View Measures Over Time window. 

• See how your network may have changed from one time capture to the next for 
any given graph level or entity node measure. 

• Use this visual comprehension to draw conclusions about how your network 
changed across multiple time period. 


540 



282Lesson 8: Network Converter 

282.1 Load Network 

The Network Converter is used for changing dataset file formats. 



If you have Analyst Notebook data then select the [Analyst Notebook »>] button to 
reveal the section. Select the [«< Analyst Notebook] button to hide it. 



282.2 Transform Network 


541 











































Create bipartite: Creates a set of nodes decomposed into two disjoint sets such that no 
two nodes within the same set are adjacent. 

Remove isolate nodes: If the Meta-Network you are transforming contains any Isolate 
nodes they will be removed in the transformed Meta-Network. 

Remove pendant nodes: If the Meta-Network you are transforming contains any 
Pendants nodes they will be removed in the transformed Meta-Network. 

Symmetrize by method: The two options are Minimum or Maximum. Symmetrizing 
turns a directed or asymmetric network data into un-directed or symmetric data. Both 
methods use a pair of values from the upper and lower portions of the table 

[Transform] button: Performs any of the checkmarked functions above. 


542 















[Make IDs Canonical] button: Removes leading and trailing spaces, replaces internal 
spaces with underscores, replaces apostrophes with dashes, and converts everything 
to lowercase. (NOTE: works on IDs only, does not touch the Title Attribute) 

[Load and Apply Thesaurus] button: 

Make thesaurus canonical: 

[Move Node IDs to Node Titles] button: Moves the values in the Entity ID column 
into the Entity Title Column and renumbers the Entity ID. 

[Move Titles IDs to Node IDs] button: Moves the values in the Entity Title column 
into the Entity ID column and deletes the Entity Title column.

282.3 Node Sets 


The Node Sets tab allows you to alter what, and how, a Meta-Network will be converted. 
It starts with a list of the NodeSets and empty checkboxes 



282.4 Nodes Add 

You can add a node to any set by placing a checkmark in the NodeSets' box and selecting 
the [Add] button. For this example a checkmark was placed in the Agent box and the 
[Add] button is selected. The dialog box will ask how many nodes you want to add. 



Type in the number of nodes to add, in this case we’ll only add 1, and select [OK], The 
AGENT section accordians to show a new agent node, 17. 


544 

































282.5 Nodes Delete 


Now say you want to delete an agent, say 17. Place a checkmark in the checkbox and 
select the [Delete] button and it will be removed. 



545 



























282.6 Nodes Merge 


The third button in the Nodes section is [Merge], With this function you can combine two 
or more nodes into a single node. Here I place checkmarks next to the members of SG-1 
to combine them into a single node. 



546 


























After selected the [Merge] button the Merge AGENT Nodes dialog asks me to give it 
both an ID and Title. I give it an ID unique from the original dataset, A17, and an unique 
Title, sg-1. 



colJack_o'neill, danielJackson, maj-samantha_carter, & teal'c have been removed and 
the new node, sg-1 has been added. 


547 














282.7 Node Properties 

This section allows you to Add/Edit/Delete attributes to individual Nodes in a NodeSet. 
One important plot point was finding a human who spoke Gou'ald, and that was 
danielJackson. Place a checkmark in his box. 


548 






























549 


























Select the [Add] button to bring up the Add AGENT Attribute window, in ID: type in the 
name of the new attribute. In Title: type in the value. Then select [OK], 



danieljackson now has the attribute speak-gou'ald=yes. 



550 



































But other agents also spoke the language. But instead of adding them one at time place a 
checkmark in the box next to each agent that will receive that attribute. Then select [Add] 
and specify the attribute and value as done previously. 

NOTE: Be sure to spell the attribute the same or ORA will add it as a different attribute. 



Save this new MetaNetwork under a new name. Select the Save Network tab, select the 
[Save...] button, and save it under a new name in the directory of your choice. Close the 
Network Converter window. 


551 


























Open up the new MetaNetwork form the main menu, File => Open Meta-Network.... 
Viewing the agent NodeSet, select the Editor tab. A new attribute column, speak_gou'ald, 
shows the values inserted by the Network Converter.

286Glossary 


A 

Adjacency Matrix - A Matrix that is a square actor-by-actor (i=j) matrix where the 
presence of pair wise edges are recorded as elements. The main diagonal, or self-tie of an 
adjacency matrix is often ignored in network analysis. 

Aggregation - Combining statistics from different entities to higher entities. 

Algorithm - A finite list of well-defined instructions for accomplishing some task that, 
given an initial state, will terminate in a defined end-state. 

Attribute - Indicates the presence, absence, or strength of a particular connection 
between entities in a Matrix. 

B 

Betweenness - Degree an individual lies between other individuals in the network; the 
extent to which an entity is directly connected only to those other entities that are not 
directly connected to each other; an intermediary; liaisons; bridges. Therefore, it's the 
number of entities who an entity is connected to indirectly through their direct links. 
Betweenness Centrality - High in betweenness but not degree centrality. This entity 
connects disconnected groups, like a Go-between. 

Bimodal Network - A network most commonly arising as a mixture of two different 
unimodal networks*. 

Binarize - Divides your data into two sets; zero or one. 

Bipartite Graph - Also called a bigraph. It's a set of entities decomposed into two 
disjoint sets such that no two entities within the same set are adjacent. 

C 

Caesar III - An application for the design of information processing and decision 
making organizations. An application for the design of decision making organizations at 
the operational and tactical levels; it takes into consideration cultural differences in 
coalitions and of adversaries. This tool is under development by George Mason 
Univeristy. 

Categorical - An Attribute Type used primarily used for grouping nodes. 

Centrality - The nearness of an entity to all other entities in a network. It displays the 
ability to access information through edges connecting other entities. The closeness is the 
inverse of the sum of the shortest distances between each entity and every other entity in 
the network. 

Centralization - Indicates the distribution of connections in the employee 
communication network as the degree to which communication and/or information flow 
is centralized around a single agent or small group. 

Characteristic Path Length - The median of the average shortest distances (number of 
links) connecting each employee to all other employees. 

Interpretation 


560 



Characteristic path length gives a insight into how information spreads. It reflects the 
communication performance of the entire network and is important for diffusing 
information and routing information to the right people. A small average path length 
results in fewer "hops" where individuals or groups don't get information. 

Classic SNA density - The number of edges divided by the number of possible edges not 
including self-reference. For a square matrix, this algorithm* first converts the diagonal 
to 0, thereby ignoring self-reference (an entity connecting to itself) and then calculates 
the density. When there are N entities, the denominator is (N*(N-1)). To consider the 
self-referential information use general density. 

Clique - A sub-structure that is defined as a set of entities where every entity is 
connected to every other entity. 

Clique Count - The number of distinct cliques to which each entity belongs. 

Closeness - Entity that is closest to all other Entities and has rapid access to all 
information. 

Clustering coefficient - Used to determine whether or not a graph is a small-world 
network. 

Cognitive Demand - Measures the total amount of effort expended by each agent to do 
its tasks. 

Column Degree - see Out Degree*. 

Complexity - Complexity reflects cohesiveness in the organization by comparing 
existing links to all possible links in all four networks (employee, task, knowledge and 
resource). 

Complementarity - The idea that people seek others with characteristics that are 
different from and complement their own, aka the idea that opposites attract. 

Concor Grouping - Concor recursively splits partitions and the user selects n splits, (n 
splits -> 2 n groups). At each split it divides the entities based on maximum correlation in 
outgoing connections. Helps find groups with similar roles in networks, even if dispersed. 
Congruence - The match between a particular organizational design and the 
organization's ability to carry out a task. 

Construct - A reduced form of Construct is found in ORA in the Near Term Impact 
Report. 

Continuous - A Attribute Type primarily used for values that are numerical so that 
statistical analysis can be be performed (Average, Minimum, Maximum, and Standard 
Deviation). 

Count - The total of any part of a MetaNetwork row, column, entity, edge, isolate, etc. 
CSV - File structure meaning Comma Separated Value. Common output structure used 
in database programs for formatting data. 

D 

Degree - The total number of edges to other entities in the network. 

Degree Centrality - Entity with the most connections, (i.e. In the know). Identifying the 
sources for intel helps in reducing information flow. 

Density - 


561 



• Binary Network: The proportion of all possible edges actually present in the 
Matrix. 

• Value Network: The sum of the edges divided by the number of possible edges, 
(i.e. the ratio of the total edge strength that is actually present to the total number 
of possible edges). 

Dyad - Two entities and the connection between them. 

Dyadic Analysis - Statistical analysis where the data is in the form of ordered pairs or 
dyads. The dyads in such an analysis may or may not be for a network. 

Dynamic Network Analysis - Dynamic Network Analysis (DNA) is an emergent 
scientific field that brings together traditional Social Network Analysis* (SNA), Link 
Analysis* (LA) and multi-agent systems (MAS). 

DyNetML - DynetML is an xml based interchange language for relational data including 
nodes, ties, and the attributes of nodes and ties. DyNetML is a universal data interchange 
format to enable exchange of rich social network data and improve compatibility of 
analysis and visualization tools. 

E 

Edge - See Link. 

Entity - A who, what, where, how, why, or thing that is being studied such as people, 
agents, organizations, beliefs, expertise, resourse, tasks, events, or locations. Node the 
representation of a single entity (a who, what, where, how why item). 

Entity Class - A set of entities of one type. 

Entity Level Metric - is one that is defined for, and gives a value for, each entity in a 
network. If there are x entities in a network, then the metric is calculated x times, once 
each for each entity. Examples are Degree Centrality*, Betweenness*, and Cognitive 
Demand*. 

Entity Set - See Meta-Node. 

Eigenvector Centrality - Entity most connected to other highly connected entities. 
Assists in identifying those who can mobilize others 

F 

FOG - (F)uzzy (O)verlapping (G)roups. Gives a better understanding of individuals 
spanning groups. Fuzzy groups are a more natural and compelling way of thinking of 
human social groups. 

G 

General density - The number of edges divided by the number of possible edges 
including self-reference. For a square matrix, this algorithm* includes self-reference (an 
entity connecting to itself) when it calculates the density. When there are N entities, the 
denominator is (N*N). To ignore self-referential information use classic SNA* density. 
Geodesic Distance - A generalization of the notion of a straight line to curved spaces. In 
presence of a metric, geodesics are defined to be (locally) the shortest path between 
points on the space. 


562 



Gini coefficient - The measure of inequality of a distribution of income. Uses a ratio 
with values between 0 and 1: the numerator is the area between the Lorenz curve of the 
distribution and the uniform (perfect) distribution line; the denominator is the area under 
the uniform distribution line. 

Graph Level Metric - A metric defined for, and gives a value for, the network as a 
whole. The metric is calculated once for the network. Examples are Centralization, Graph 
Hierarchy, and the maximum or average Betweenness. 

GraphML - GraphML is a comprehensive and easy-to-use file format for graphs. It 
consists of a language core to describe the structural properties of a graph and a flexible 
extension mechanism to add application-specific data. 

Group - a collection of things (entities, nodes, ties, networks). A group might at times 
be represented as a meta-node. Nodes may be classified in to groups on the basis of a 
shared attribute, type, id-range, label, user selection, etc. For example, if you have a set 
of people and know their gender, then their might be two groups - men and women. In 
addition the nodes representing those people could be displayed as a meta-node for men 
and a meta-node for women. Nodes may be classified in to groups on the basis of a 
grouping algorithm. For example, if you have a network showing connections among 
members of an organization and you run a grouping algorithm it will return clusters of 
nodes that fit together on some mathematical criteria. This cluster is a group and can be 
represented as a meta-node. 

H 

Hamming Distance - Number minimum number of substitutions required to change one 
string into another string of equal length, (i.e. "toned" and "roses" is 3.) 

Heuristics - Problem-solving by trial and error: a method of solving a problem for which 
no formula exists, based on informal methods or experience, and employing a form of 
trial and error iteration. 

Homophily - (i.e., love of the same) is the tendency of individuals to associate and bond 
with similar others. 

• Status homophily means that individuals with similar social status characteristics 
are more likely to associate with each other than by chance. 

• Value homophily refers to a tendency to associate with others who think in 
similar ways, regardless of differences in status. 

HTML - HyperText Makup Language. 

I 

In-Degree - The sum of the connections leading to an entity from other entities. 
Sometimes refered to row degree. 

Influence network - A network of hypotheses regarding task performance, event 
happening and related efforts.

L 


563 



Latent Semantic Analysis - Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is a technique in natural 
language processing, in particular in vectorial semantics, of analyzing relationships 
between a set of documents and the terms they contain by producing a set of concepts 
related to the documents and terms. 

Lattice Network - A graph in which the edges are placed at the integer coordinate points 
of the n-dimensional Euclidean space and each entity connects to entities which are 
exactly one unit away from it. 

Link - The representation of the tie, connection, relation, edge between two nodes. 

Link Analysis - A scientific area focused on the study of patterns emerging from dyadic 
observations. The relationships are typically a form of co-presence between two entities. 
Also multiple dyads that may or may not form a network. 

Link Class - A set of Links of one type. A set of links of one type can be represented as 
a meta-link. 

M 

Main Diagonal - in a sqaure matrix this is the conjunction of the rows and cells for the 
same entity. 

Math Terms 

These mathematical terms and symbols are used: Let S be any set: 

• card(S) = ISI = the cardinality of S (the cardinality of the entity-sets is represented 
as IAI, IKI, IRI, ITI) 

• 91 denotes a real number 

• Z denotes an integer 

Matrix Algebra - The part of algebra that deals with the theory of matrices. 

Measure - A measure is a function that maps one or more networks to R n . Measures are 
often scalar (n=l) or vector valued with n=IVI or n=IUI. 

Meta-Link - The representation of a Group of Links. 

MetaNetwork - See Meta-Network 

Meta-Network - The representation of a Group of Networks. 

Meta-Node - A representation of a Group of nodes. 

Monte Carlo - A random optimization of your organization 

MRQAP - This describes a report in ORA. See Reports for more information. For 
multivariate cases, if your dependent variable is continous or count data (like in a 
negative binomial case), you should use MRQAP. If your dependent variable is binary, 
you should use ERGM (P*) which is forthcoming in ORA. One can perform MRQAP on 
data that have a dichotomous dependent variable (basically, this is equivalent to using a 
linear probability model). You do need to interpret your results accordingly. 

Multi-Agent System - A loosely coupled network of problem-solver entities that work 
together to find answers to problems that are beyond the individual capabilities or 
knowledge of each entity 

Multi-entity - More than one type of entity (people, events, locations, etc.). 

Multi-plex - Network where the links are from two or more relation classes. 

Multimode Network - Where the entities are in two or more entity classes. 


564 



N 

Neighbors - Entities that share an immediate edge to the entity selected. 

Network - The representation of a set of nodes (including meta-nodes) of one type and 
the links (including meta-links) of one type between them. 

A network N is a triple consisting of two sets of entities, called U and V, and a set of 
edges EcUxV. Thus, we write N=(U,V,E). An element e = (i,j) in E indicates a 
relationship or tie between entities i£U and j£V. A network where U=V and therefore 
EcVxV is called unimodal*; otherwise the network is bimodal*. We write G=(V,E) 
for unimodal* networks. For our purposes, unimodal networks will not contain self 
loops, which means that (i,i)£E for i£V. 

Network Class - A set of Networks on one type. This can also be represented as a Meta- 
Network. 

Network data format - usually comes in the form of NodeSet 1 listed vertically in 
column A starting in row 2 and NodeSet 2 listed horizontally in row 1 starting with 
column B. All the intersecting cells are the links between each of the nodes. 

Newman Grouping - Finds unusually dense clusters, even in large networks. 

Node - A representation of a real-world entity (a who, what, where, how, why item. 

Node Class - A set of nodes of one type. Note a set of nodes of one type can be 
represented as a meta-node. 

Normalized Sum - Otherwise known as the Average. 

Notation: 

The following matrix notation is used throughout the document for an arbitrary matrix X: 

• X(i,j) = the entry in the i th row and j th column of X 

• X(i,:) = i th row vector of X 

• X(: ,j) = j th column vector of X 

• sum(X) = sum of the elements in X (also, X can be a row or column vector of a 
matrix) 

• dich(X) = dichotomize (make binary) X, so that dich(X)(i,j) = 1 iff X(i,j) > 0 

• X' = the transpose of X 

• ~X = for binary X, ~X(i,j) = 1 iff X(i,j) = 0 

• X@X = element-wise multiplication of two matrices (e.g. Z=X@Y => Z(i,j) = 
X(i,j)*Y(i,j)) 


O 

ODBC - (O)pen (D)ata (B)ase (C)onnectivity is an access method developed by the SQL 
Access group in 1992 whose goal was to make it possible to access any data from any 
application, regardless of which database management system (DBMS) is handling the 
data. 

Ontology - "The Specifics of a Concept". The group of entities, resources, knowledge, 
and tasks that exist in the same domain and are connected to one another. It's a simplified 
way of viewing the information.

vertices). 

Path - A set of nodes and links that form a single unbroken chain, such that no node or 
link is repeated, i.e. A>B>C>D>E 

Pendant - Any entity which is only connected by one edge. They appear to dangle off 
the main group. 

Percolation Theory - The behavior of connected clusters in a random network. 

Pythia - Program used to create Influence Nets. Pythia is a timed influence net 
application. This tool can downloaded at the following URL: 
http://sysarch.gmu.edu/main/software/. 

Q 

QAP Correlation - Calculates measures of nominal, ordinal, and interval association 
between the relations in two matrices, and uses quadratic assignment procedures to 
develop standard errors to test for the significance of association. 

QAP is designed as a bivariate test (only two variables). Generally, QAP is perfectly fine 
for almost any bivariate network problem. 

R 

Random Graph - One tries to prove the existence of graphs with certain properties by 
assigning random edges to various entities. The existence of a property on a random 
graph can be translated to the existence of the property on almost all graphs using the 
famous Szemeredi regularity lemma*. 

Reciprocity - The percentage of entities in a graph that arebi-directional. 

Redundancy - Number of entities that access to the same resources, are assigned the 
same task, or know the same knowledge. Redundancy occurs only when more than one 
agent fits the condition. 

Relation - The way in which entities in one class relate to entities in another class. 
Robustness - Two different definitions: 

• Networks - Concerned with the reliability (Kim & MA©dard, 2004) and 
continued functioning of a network following an intervention. The robustness of a 
network is particularly relevant in communication-type and flow-oriented 
networks. The purpose for understanding robustness of a network has more of a 
management of the network connotation. 

• Measures - This meaning has more of a statistical connotation. Studying the 
robustness of a measure of a network can also be referred to as conducting a 
sensitivity analysis on the measure. In keeping with the terminology of the most- 
recently published research in this area, in lieu of using the term sensitivity, we 
too will use the robustness term, although the terms can be used interchangeably. 
A measure is robust if a slight perturbation in its input produces a slight change in 
its output.

Row Degree - see In Degree*. 

S 

Scale-Free Network - Some entities act as highly connected hubs (high degree), 
although most entities are of low degree. Scale-free networks' structure and dynamics are 
independent of the system's size N, the number of entities the system has. A network that 
is scale-free will have the same properties no matter what the number of its entities is. 
Self-Loop - An entity with a connection to itself. 

Simmelian Ties - Two entities are Simmelian Tied to one another if they are reciprocally 
and strongly tied to each other and strongly tied to at least one third party in common. 
Simulated Annealing - A method of finding optimal values numerically. It's a search 
method as opposed to a gradient based algorithm. It chooses a new point, and (for 
optimization) all uphill points are accepted while some downhill points are accepted 
depending on a probabilistic criteria. 

The term Simulated Annealing draws its inspiration from metallurgy, where atoms 
within a metal are heated thereby dislodging them from a metal's internal structure 
transforming the metal into another atomic state. In this way, your organization is 
heated changing its components in the attempt to arrive at an optimized state. 

Slow Measures - As the name implies these measures generally take longer to run. 
Small-World Network - Small-World Networks will have sub-networks that are 
characterized by the presence of connections between almost any two entities within 
them. 

Social Network Analysis - The term Social Network Analysis (or SNA) is used to refer 
to the analysis of any network such that all the entities are of one type (e.g., all people, or 
all roles, or all organizations), or at most two types (e.g., people and the groups they 
belong to). 

Sphere of Influence - One entity's direct relationship with one of it's neighbors as a 
function of specified path length. 

Standard Deviation - The square root of the variance where variance is the average of 
the squared differences between data points. 

.stl file format - This file format is native to the stereolithography CAD software created 
by 3D Systems. STL files describe only the surface geometry of a three dimensional 
object without any representation of color, texture or other common CAD model 
attributes and can us both ASCII and binary representations 

Szemeredi's Regularity Lemma - A fundamental structural result in extremal graph 
theory due to Szemeredi (1978). The regularity lemma essentially says that every graph 
can be well-approximated by the union of a constant number of random-like bipartite 
graphs, called regular pairs. 

T 

Table data format - Table data usually contains a column with referencing IDs and 
headers denoting column names. 

Tie - see Link 

Topology - The study of the arrangement or mapping of the elements (links, nodes, etc.) 
of a network, especially the physical (real) and logical (virtual) interconnections between 
nodes.

Total Degree Centrality - The normalized sum of an entity's row and column degrees. 
Trail - A set of nodes and links that form a single unbroken chain that can revisit nodes 
but not links, i.e. A>B>C>A>D 

Transpose - In linear algebra, the transpose of a matrix A is another matrix A T (also 
written A tr , l A, or A') created by any one of the following equivalent actions: 

• write the rows of A as the columns of A T 

T 

• write the columns of A as the rows of A 

• reflect A by its main diagonal (which starts from the top left) to obtain AT 

See The Transpose Wikipedia Entry for forumlas, examples and more information. 

U 

Unimodal networks - These are also called square networks because their adjacency 
matrix* is square; the diagonal is zero diagonal because there are no self-loops*. 

W 

Walk - A set of nodes and links that form a single unbroken chain that can revisit both 
nodes and links, i.e. A>B>C>B>D.
