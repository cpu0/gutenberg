Abstract 

Kravchuk orthogonal functions — Kravchuk polynomials multiplied by the square root 
of the weight function — simplify the inversion algorithm for the analysis of discrete, finite 
signals in harmonic oscillator components. They can be regarded as the best approximation 
set. As the number of sampling points increases, the Kravchuk expansion becomes the 
standard oscillator expansion. 

1 Introduction 

In a harmonic oscillator environment, such as Fourier optics in a multimodal parabolic index-profile 
fiber, sampling on a finite set of discrete observation points reconstructs the wavefunction 
through partial wave synthesis. For the harmonic oscillator eigenf unctions, one must invert a 
nondiagonal matrix with the dimension of the number of data. 

We show that Kravchuk orthogonal functions optimize the algorithm for the expansion coef- 
fients, because the matrix is already diagonal. 

Kravchuk functions [1, 2] are solutions of the difference analogue of the Schrodinger equation 
describing a discrete harmonic oscillator system. 

Kravchuk functions have a well-defined analytical structure inside the measurement interval. 

Kravchuk functions become the standard oscillator wavefunctions, as the number of sampling 
points increases. 

This contribution is a resume of Ref. [3].

where H n tf) are the Hermite polynomials, £ = yjrmo/kx, m is oscillator mass, u is oscillation

inner product:

0, when m ^ n.

3 Kravchuk functions are difference analogs of the osci- 
llator eigenf unctions 

Kravchuk polynomials k^\x,N) are: 

• polynomials of degree < n < N, 

• in the variable x E [0, TV], 

• of the parameter < p < 1. 

These polynomials are related to the binomial distribution of probability theory [4, 5]. They form 
an orthogonal set 

T,e(j)k£ ) (j,N)kM(j,N) = <P n 6 m>n 
with respect to a discrete binomial weight function 

Q{x) = C* N p*{\-p) N -\ 
Kravchuk functions are defined as 

$\x, N) = d- 1 k^(Np + x, N) e " 2 (x + Np), 

0<n<N, -Np< x < (1 -p)N 
(cf. definition of the Hermite functions in Ref. [6]). They obey the three-term recurrence relation 

[x-n-p(N-2n)]k^\x,N) = (n + l)k^(x,N) + p(i-p)(N-n + l)ki P \(x,N), 

and satisfy the equation 

HW(x)^'(x,yV) = (n + i)^)(x, J V), 
with the difference Hamiltonian 

H^(ar) = (1 - 2p)x + 2p(l -p)N + \- yjp(l - p)[a{x) e~ 9 * + a(x + 1) e 8 *], 
namely 



[(1 - 2p)x -n + 2p(l- p)N]<f>^(x, N) = y/p(l - p) [a{x)^\x -l,N) + a(x + l)<f>W(x +l,N)]. 

The oscillator equation of motion in the Schrodinger representation [7] is [H,[H,x]] = (hu>) 2 x. 
The difference analogue of this relation satisfied by this Hamiltonian is [1] 

[HW(x),[HW(x),x]] = x. 
Finally, the limit N -y oo of Kravchuk functions is 

lim h-^4?\h-^,N) = y n (0-

The set of Kravchuk functions $»>(x, JV), n = 0, 1, . . . , N forms a basis for irreducible represen- 
tations of the rotation group 50(3) [8], corresponding to the eigenvalues I = f°*_^e invariant 
Casimir operator; the eigenvalues of generator J z are the integer m = n - ^N - n - I. Ihe 
representations corresponding to different values of the parameter p turn out to be unitanly equi- 
valent [1], so it is sufficient to consider a set of functions <f>W(x, N) with some fixed value of this 
parameter. It is convenient to choose the value p = |, since these Kravchuk functions have definite 
parity with respect to reflections of x, 

<j>W\-x,N) = (-l) n W 2) (x,N). 
We thus use henceforth the symmetric Kravchuk functions

4 Finite approximation by Kravchuk functions 

A function /(£) that iives in a harmonic oscillator environment', of which the values on N + 1 
equidistant points fc are known, is meaningfully expanded in symmetric Kravchuk functions as 

/(fc) = 4r£4 W) *n(fc/A,JV), j=0,l,...N. 
1 vft„=o I 



To find the expansion coefficients {4 W) )n=o, we multiply the above equation by <M&M, N ) and 
sum over the sample points £,• : 



N 

I 



«i w > = v^ !>(&/*, *)/&■). 



We thus have only to multiply the sampled values /&) by the (numerically calculated) values 
of the Kravchuk functions at the points *,- = fc/fe, for n = 0, 1, . . . ,iV, to find the expansion 
coefficients. No matrix inversion is necessary. 
The sum N 

/(^) = 4f£4 N) <M^A0, j = o,i,...,JV, 

yh n=0 
interpolates the original function defined on discrete points to the interval [£ ,t N ] and is a finite 
approximation to the square-integrable function /(£)• This approximates finite because for 
any fixed N it has a finite support {-h - h'\h + h~*) with h = y/2/N. When N grows, 
the approximation to /(0 becomes better. The time evolution of the approximating function 
multiplies each ^(fc./V) by the usual time dependence exp(-zE n t/h), with the equally spaced 
energy eigenvalues E n = hu>{n + jj)-

These basis functions can be expanded in terms of Kravchuk functions as

A fc (fc, N) = -j= £ A&> <i> n ^/h, N), j = 0, 1, ... N, 
where the coefficients are 

for k = 0, 1, . . . [N/2] and continuous £. These functions are the localized states of the discrete 

oscillator. 

Momentum basis functions are defined in the same way, because Kravchuk functions are 
self-reproducing under the discrete Fourier transformation [2], i.e. 

A*(£, N) = J2 * n Mtk/h, N) 4> n (t/h, N).
