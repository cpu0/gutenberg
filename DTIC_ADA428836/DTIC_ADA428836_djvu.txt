Matlab, from The Mathworks Inc., is a technical computing environment that is widely used in 
the scientific and engineering communities for research and development. The basic product can be 
augmented by a variety of toolboxes that extend it’s capabilities in specialized areas such as Signal and 
Image processing, Control System Design, Financial Analysis, etc. There are many situations in which 
it is desirable to access MATLAB and toolbox functionality over the World Wide Web. For example, a 
research group may want to allow other researchers to test and benchmark their MATLAB code using 
data available over the web. The Matlab Web Server, also available from MathWorks Inc., makes it 
possible to deploy Matlab applications over the internet. However, the Matlab Web Server does not 
preserve the user workspace, making it difficult to create applications that make the online Matlab 
experience as rich as a locally run Matlab session. 

This paper discusses the development of an alternative method for deploying Matlab applications 
over the Web. The system developed here aims at overcoming many of the limitations of the Matlab Web 
Server, resulting in a more interactive online Matlab experience. Using the MATLAB-Java interface 
available in the recent releases of MATLAB, our system provides the web interface through the use of 
Java Servlets and custom Java classes. As shown in Fig. 1, a multithreaded socket is used to start a 
new Matlab process for every user that logs into the system. Once the Matlab process for a user has 
been started, all communication between the user and Matlab process is facilitated by the servlet and 
the Java socket opened by Matlab. This allows each user to have a workspace that is preserved until 
his/her Matlab process exits. This also has the advantage that no additional server-side programming 
is needed specifically to save user data and have a unique identifier to associate it with the user. 

We will show an example of a web-accesed MATLAB application that allows a user to access acoustic 
signals stored in a mySQL database, search for signals that meet a user-selected criterion, analyse the 
selected signal using a variety of signal processing algorithms and create 2-d and 3-d plots of the signal 
and analysis results. The user also has the ability to playback and listen to selected portions of the 
signal. The preservation of the user workspace means that the user can zoom in and examine portions of 
the signals in more detail without having to rerun the analysis each time. The zooming and playback of 
the signals is accomplished using Java applets that are downloaded to the user’s browser. This example

Figure 1: System overview 

system also shows how to use Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) to access and manipulate the signal 
database. 

An important application of such a system is a research oriented web portal where a community of 
scientists and researchers can share data and code with each other. The portal can allow authenticated 
users to download MATLAB code which is then immediately available to other users to test and examine 
results. Any specialized toolboxes required need be hosted only on the server system running MATLAB 
and need not be replicated at each user site. 

This work was supported in part by the DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program’s 
PET program.

Limitations of Matlab Web Server 


Matlab workspace is not retained 

- All variables and data generated by an application is 
lost upon completion of the program 

- Results need to be recomputed for subsequent 
analysis by other applications 

Does not provide interactivity with Matlab 
graphical output 

Difficult to track users 

- The system does not have a concept of sessions 

Does not provide network security 

- No data encryption provided 

- User authentication not provided 


IPS LAB.

Java Servlets 


Java servlets perform the following functions 

- Authenticate users 

- Start a new Matlab process for each new 
user 

- Communicate with user’s browser using the 
https protocol 

- Communicate with user’s Matlab process 
using kerberized sockets 

-Track users through sessions 


IPS LAB. 


THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY 





Kerberos, Java Sockets and Servlet 

• The Kerberos mechanism is used for secure 
message exchanges using sockets 

• The OSU Matlab portal uses Kerberos V5 
mechanism for secure communication 

• Kerberos ticket required for establishing 
credentials and secure communication 

• Kerberos tickets expire when user logs out of 
the portal 


IPS LAB. 


THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY 





Kerberos based communication 


• Once a user is authenticated and logged in, a 
unique Kerberos ticket is generated 

• Communication process: 

- Connection is established between Java socket and 
Servlet 

- Socket and Servlet instantiate a new security 
context for communication 

- Using the Kerberos ticket the Socket and Servlet 
mutually authenticate and exchange tokens for 
encryption 

- All communication between them is now encrypted 
using previously exchanged tokens

Limitations 


Matlab memory requirements 

- Each Matlab process uses 50 Mb RAM on startup 

- Memory used increases as more variables are 
created 

JavaScript and Applets needed for interacting 
with graphics 

- Disabling JavaScript removes all graphics 
interactivity 

Currently limited to Unix/Linux platforms 


IPS LAB. 


THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY 





Future Work 


Provide ability to upload and download data as 
well as Matlab code 

Provide bulletin board for exchange of ideas, 
problem discussion, etc. 

Develop administrator tools for portal 

- Make provisions for adding/removing users 

- Tools for portal administration

Matlab Display Issues 

When run as a background process, Matlab 
runs in the terminal emulation mode 

Problems: 

- No X-Display available for Matlab 

- Cannot produce JPEG images directly 

- Representation of result data severely limited 

Solution: 

- Use Virtual Network Computing (VNC) 

- Matlab uses this X display for generating graphics

THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY 





Virtual Network Computing (VNC) 

Remote display system 

Used to create a virtual desktops 

This virtual desktop can be access from a 
variety of platforms (Unix/Linux, Windows, 
MacOS) 

Has very small memory requirements

THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY 





Input to Matlab from the Web 

All Matlab applications deployed through the 
portal get input parameters from the user over 
the web 

Names of parameters are specified in 
deploy.xml 

The parameters are returned in the form of a 
structure paramStruct 

All applications have access to this variable in 
the workspace 

Applications must convert parameters from a 
string to appropriate format 

IPS LAB. 


THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY 





Example: Accessing input parameters 

• Consider an application with the following 
input parameters: 

- channel: string 

- start_time: integer 

- stop_time: integer 

• User input over the web: 

- channel=‘engine_speed’ 

- start_time=10 

- stop_time=40 


IPS LAB. 


THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY 





Example (continued) 

• In Matlab, the parameters can be accessed as: 

channel_name = paramStruct.channel; 
start = str2num ( paramStruct.start_time ); 
end = str2num (paramStruct.stop_time ); 

• All parameters obtained over the web are 
available are accessed as strings in Matlab 


IPS LAB. 


THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY 





Java Socket used by Matlab 

Matlab uses Java sockets for communicating 
with the Servlet 

Data obtained over the web and results to be 
sent back to the browser are obtained by 
Matlab using this socket 

This socket uses Kerberos for secure 
communication with the Servlet 


IPS LAB. 


THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY 





Sending Results to Browser 

Applications are responsible for generating 
HTML required to display results in the user’s 
browser 

Applications need only create the HTML in the 
form of a variable named html 

This string will be sent back to the user’s 
browser by the Java socket 


IPS LAB. 


THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY 





Generating Images from Matlab plots 

Images to be displayed in the browser should 
be in the JPEG format 

The Matlab ‘print’ function is used to print 
figures to JPEG images 

Helper functions are provided for creating 
filenames, generating JPEG images and 
creating necessary HTML tags for displaying 
images
