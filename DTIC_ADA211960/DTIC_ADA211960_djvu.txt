CHAPTER 1 


INTRODUCTION 


This Validation Summary Report (-VSRP^ describes the extent to which a 
specific Ada conpiler conforms to the Ada Standard, ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A. 
This report explains all technical terms used within it and thoroughly 
reports the results of .testing this compiler using the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability ^ fACVC)» An Ada compiler must be implemented 
according to the Ada Standard, and any implementation-dependent features 
must conform Lo the requirements of the Ada Standard. The Ada Standard 
must be implemented in its entirety, and nothing caui be implemented that is 
not in the Standard. 

Even though all validated Ada compilers conform to the Ada Standard, it 
must be understood that some differences do exist between implementations. 
The Ada Stemdard permits some implementation dependencies—for example, the 
maximum length of identifiers or the maximum values of integer types. 
Other differences between compilers result from the characteristics of 
particular operating systems, hardware, or implementation strategies. All 
the dependencies observed during the process of testing this compiler are 
given in this report. 


The information in this report is derived from the test results produced 
during validation testing. The validation process includes submitting a 
suite of standardized tests, the ACVC, as inputs to an Ada compiler and 
evaluating the results. The purpose of validating is to ensure conformity 
of the compiler to the Ada Standard by testing that the compiler properly 
implements legal language constructs and that it identifies and rejects 
illegal leuiguage constructs. The testing also identifies behavior that is 
implementation-dependent but is permitted by the Ada Standard. Six classes 
of tests are used. These tests are designed to perform checks at compile 
time, at link time, and during execution. 












INTRODUCTION 


.1 PURPOSE OF THIS VALIDATION SUMMARY REPORT 


This VSR docuaents the results of the validation testing performed on an 
Ada compiler. Testing was carried out for the following purposes: 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs supported by the 
compiler that do not conform to the Ada Standard 

. To attempt to identify any language constructs not supported by 
the compiler but required by the Ada Standard 

. To determine that the implementation-dependent behavior is allowed 
by the Ada Standard 

Testing of this compiler was conducted by SofTech, Inc. under the 
direction of the AVF according to procedures established by the Ada Joint 
Program Office and administered by the Ada Validation Organization (AVO). 
On-site testing was completed 9 April 1989 at San Diego CA.

Failed test An ACVC test for which the compiler generates a result that 
demonstrates nonconformity to the Ada Standard. 

Host The computer on which the compiler resides. 

Inapplicable An ACVC test that uses features of the language that a 

test compiler is not required to support or may legitimately 

support in a way other than the one expected by the test. 

Passed test An ACVC test for which a compiler generates the expected 
result. 

Target The computer for which a compiler generates code. 

Test A program that checks a compiler’s conformity regarding a 

particular feature or a combination of features to the Ada 
Standard. In the context of this report, the term is used to 
designate a single test, which may comprise one or more 
files. 

An ACVC test found to be incorrect and not used to check 
conformity to the Ada Standard. A test may be incorrect 
because it has an invalid test objective, fails to meet its 
test objective, or contains illegal or erroneous use of the 
language. 


1.5 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conformity to the Ada Standard is measured using the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains both legal and illegal Ada programs structured into six test 
classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies 
the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable, 
and special program units are used to report their results during 
execution. Class B tests are expected to produce compilation errors. 
Class L tests are expected to produce compilation or link errors because of 
the way in which a program library is used at link time. 

Class A tests ensure the successful compilation of legal Ada programs with 
certain language constructs which cannot be verified at compile time. 
There are no explicit program components in a Class A test to check 
semantics. For example, a Class A test checks that reserved words of 
another lauiguage (other than those already reserved in the Ada language) 
are not treated as reserved words by an Ada compiler. A Class A test is 
passed if no errors are detected at compile time and the program executes 
to produce a PASSED message. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is exzunined to verify that every syntax or 
semantic error ir the test is detected. A Class B test is passed if every

INTRODUCTION 


illegal construct that it contains is detected by the compiler. 

Class C tests check the run time system to ensure that legal Ada programs 
can be correctly compiled and executed. Each Class C test is self-checking 
and produces a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result when it is executed. 

Class D tests check the compilation and execution capacities of a compiler. 
Since there are no capacity requirements placed on a compiler by the Ada 
Standard for some parameters—for example, the number of identifiers 
permitted in a eompilatlon or the number of units in a library—a compiler 
may refuse to compile a Class D test and still be a conforming compiler. 
Therefore, if a Class D test falls to compile because the capacity of the 
compiler is exceeded, the test is classified as inapplicable. If a Class D 
test compiles successfully, it is self-checking and produces a PASSED or 
FAILED message during execution. 

Class E tests are expected to execute successfully and check 
implonentation-dependent options and resolutions of ambiguities in the Ada 
Standard. Each Class E test is self-checking and produces a NOT 
APPLICABLE, PASSED, or FAILED message \friien it is compiled and executed. 
However, the Ada Standard permits an implementation to reject programs 
containing some features addressed by Class E tests during compilation. 
Therefore, a Class E test is passed by a compiler if it is compiled 
successfully and executes to produce a PASSED message, or if it is rejected 
by the compiler for an allowable reason. 

Class L tests check that incomplete or illegal Ada programs involving 
multiple, separately compiled units are detected and not allowed to 
execute. Class L tests are compiled separately and execution is attempted. 
A CIms L test passes if it is rejected at link time—that is, an attempt 
to execute the main program must generate an error message before any 
declarations in the main program or any units referenced by the main 
program are elaborated. In some cases, an Implementation may legitimately 
detect errors during compilation of the test. 

Two library units, the package REPORT and the procedure CHECK_FILE, support 
the self-checking features of the executable tests. The package REPORT 
provides the mechanism by which executable tests report PASSEH), FAILED, or 
NOT APPLICABLE results. It also provides a set of identity functions used 
to defeat some compiler optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that 
would circumvent a test objective. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to 
check the contents of text files written by some of the Class C tests for 
chapter 14 of the Ada Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. These tests produce messages that 
are examined to verify that the units are operating correctly. If these 
units are not operating correctly, then the validation is not attempted. 

The text of each test in the ACVC follows conventions that are intended to 
ensure that the tests are reasonably portable without modification. For 
example, the tests make use of only the basic set of 55 characters, contain 
lines with a maximum length of 72 characters, use small numeric values, and 
place features th; may not be supported by all implementations in separate 


'-5 


INTRODUCTION 


tests. However, some tests contain values that require the test to be 
customized according to implementation-specific values—for exa.tple, an 
illegal file name. A list of the values used for this valiaation is 
provided in Appendix C. 

A compilar must correctly process each of the tests in the suite and 
demon' ;rate conformity to the Ada Standard by either meeting the pass 
criteria given for the test or by showing that the test is inapplicable to 
the implementation. The applicability of a test to an implementation is 
considered each time the implementation is validated. A test that is 
inapplicable for one validation is not necessarily inapplicable for a 
subsequent validation. Any test that was determined to contain an illegal 
language construct or an erroneous language construct is withdrawn from tne 
ACVC and, therefore, is not used in testing a compiler. The tests 
withdrawn at the time of this validation are given in Append-x D.

2-1 








CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


2.2 IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS 

One of the purposes of validating compilers is to determine the behavior of 
a compiler in those areas of the Aaa Standard that permit implementations 
to differ. Class D and E tests specifically check for such implementation 
differences. However, tests in other classes also characterize an 
implementation. The tests demonstrate the following characteristics: 


a. Capacities. 


(1) The compiler correctly processes a compilation containing 723 
variables in the same declarative part. (See test D29002K.) 

(2) The compiler correctly processes tests containing loop 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See tests D55A03A..H (8 
tests).) 

(3) The compiler correctly processes tests containing block 
statements nested to 65 levels. (See test D56001B.) 

(4) The compiler correctly processes tests containing recursive ’ 
procedures separately compiled as subunits nested to 17 
levels. (See tests D64005E..G (3 tests).) 


b. Predefined types. 


(1) This implementation supports the additional predefined types 
LONG_INTEGER and LONG_FLOAT in package STANDARD. (See tests 
B86001T..2 (7 tests).) 


c. Expression evaluation. 

The order in which expressions are evaluated and the time at which 
constraints are checked are not defined by the language. While 
the ACVC tests do not specifically attempt to determine the order 
of evaluation of expressions» test results indicate the following: 

(1) Some of the default initialization expressions for record 
components are evaluated before any value is cheeked for 
membership in a component's subtype. (See test C32117A.) 

(2) Assignments for subtypes are performed with the same precision 
as the base type. (See test C35712B.) 

(3) This implementation uses no extra bits for extra precision and 
uses no extra bits for extra range. (See test C35903A.) 


2-2 







CONFIGUR"TION INFORMATION 


(M) Sometimes NUMERIC^ERROR is raised when an integer literal 
operand in a comparison or membership test is outside the 
range of the base type. (See test CM5232A.) 

(5) NDMERIC_ERROR is raised when a literal operand in a 
fixed-point comparison or membership test is outsiae the range 
of the base type. (See test CM5252A.) 

(6) Underflow is gradual. (See tests C45524A..Z.) 


d. Rounding. 

The method by which values are rounded in type conversions is not 
defined by the language. Vfhlle the ACVC tests do not specifically 
attempt to determine the method of rounding, the test results 
indicate the following: 

(1) The method used for rounding to integer is round to even. 
(See tests C46012A..Z.) 

(2) The method used for rounding to longest integer is round to 
even. (See tests C46012A..Z.) 

(3) The method used for rounding to integer in static universal 
real expressions is round away from zero. (See test C4AC14/..) 


e. Array types. 

An implementation is allowed to raise NUMERIC_ERROR or 

CONSTRAINT_ERROR for an array having a 'LENGTH that excee 's 

STANDARD.INTEGER'LAST and/or SYSTEM.MA7_INT. 

For this implementation: 

(1) Declaration of an array type or subtype declaration with more 
than SySTDl.MAX_INT components raises NUMERIC_ERROF, for a 
two-dimensional array subtype when the big dimension is the 
second one. (See test C36003A.) 

(2) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised when 'LENGTH is applied to a null 

array type with INTEGER'LAST ♦ 2 components. (See test 

C36202A.) 

(3) NDMERIC_ERROR is raised when a null array type with 

SYSTEM.MAX_INT 2 components is declared. (See test 

C36202B.) 

(4) A packed BOOLEAN array having a 'LENGTH exceeding INTEGER'LAST 
raises no exception. (See test C52103X.) 


2-3 








CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(5) A packed two-dimensional BOOLEAN array with more than 
INTEGER'LAST components raises CONSTRAINT_ERROP when the 
length of a dimension is calculated and exceeds INTEGER'LAST. 
(See test C5210ilY.) 

(6) A null array with one dimension of length greater than 

INTEGER'LAST may raise NUMERIC_ERROR or CONSTRAINT_ERROR 
either when declared or assigned. Alternatively, an 

implementation may accept the declaration. However, lengths 
must match in array slice assignments. This implementation 
raises no exception. (See test E52103Y*) 

(7) In assigning one-dimensional array types, the expression is 
evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

(8) In assigning two-dimensional array types, the expression is 
not evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is 
raised when checking whether the expression's subtype is 
compatible with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


f. Discriminated types. 

(1) In assigning record types with discriminants, the expression 
is evaluated in its entirety before CONSTRAINT^ERROR is raised 
when checking whether the expression's subtype is compatible 
with the target's subtype. (See test C52013A.) 


g. Aggregates. 

(1) In the evaluation of a multi-dimensional aggregate, index 
subtype checks are made as choices are evaluated. (See tests 
CU3207A and C43207B.) 

(2) In the evaluation of an aggregate containing subaggregates, 
not all choices are evaluated before being checked for 
identical bounds. (See test E43212B.) 

(3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised after all choices are evaluated 
when a bound in a non-null range of a non-null aggregate does 
not belong to an index subtype. (See test E43211B.) 


h. Pragmsis. 

(1) The pragma INLINE is supported for procedures and non-library 
functions. (See tests LA3004A..B, EA3004C..D, and 

CA3004E..F.) 


2-4 








CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


i. Generics 

(1) Generic unit declarations, bodies, and subunits can be 

compiled in separate compilations. (See tests CAIO'ZA and 

CA3011A.) 

(2) If a generic unit body or one of its subunits is compiled or 
recompiled after the generic unit is InstEuitiated, the unit 
instantiating the generic is made obsolete. The obsolescence 
is recognized at binding time, and the binding is stopped. 
(See tests CA2009C, CA2009F, BC320l»C, and BC3205D.) 


J. Input and output 

(1) The package SEQUENTIAL_IO cannot be instantiated with 
unconstrained array types or record types with discriminsmts 
without defaults. (See tests AE2101C, EE2201D, Emd EE2201E.) 

(2) The package DIRECT_IO cannot be instauntiated with 
unconstrained array types or record types with discriminants 
without defaults. (See tests AE2101K, EE2401D, and EE2401G.) 

(3) Modes IN FILE and OUT FILE are supported for SEQUENTIAL 10. 
(See tests CE2102D..E, CE2102N, and CE2102P.) 

(4) Modes IN FILE, OUT FILE, and INOUT_FILE are supported for 
DIRECT_Ic 7 (See tests CE2102F, CE2102I..J, CE2102R, CE2102T, 
and CE2102V.) 

(5) Modes IN_FILE and 0UT_FILE are supported for text files. (See 
tests CE3102E and CE3102I..K.) 

(6) RESET and DELETE operations are supixjrted for SEQUENTIAL_IO. 
(See tests CE2102G and CE2102X.) 

(7) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for DIRECT_I0. (See 
tests CE2102K and CE2102Y.) 

(8) RESET and DELETE operations are supported for text files. 
(See tests CE3102F..G, CE3104C, CE3110A, and CE311‘*A.) 

(9) - Overwriting to a sequential file does not truncate the file. 

(See test CE2208B.) 

(10) Temporary sequential files are given names and not deleted 
when closed. (See test CE2108A.) 

(11) Temporary direct files are given names and not deleted when 
closed. (See test CE2108C.) 


2-5 







CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(12) Temporary text files are given names and not deleted when 
closed. (See test CE3112A.) 

( 13 ) More tham one internal file can be associated with each 

external file for sequential files when reading only. (See 
teats CE2107A..E, CE2102L, CE2110B, and CE2111D.) 

(14) More than one internal file can be associated with each 

external file for direct files when reading only. (See tests 
CE2107F..H (3 tests), CE2110D, and CE2111H.) 

(15) More than one internal file can be associated with each 

external file for text files when reading only. (See teats 
CE3111A..E, CE3114B, and CE3115A.) 


2-6 








CHAPTER 3 


TEST INFORMATION 


3.1 TEST RESULTS 

Version 1.10 of the ACVC comprises 3717 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, 43 tests had been withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF 
determined that 314 teats were inapplicable to this implementation. All 
inapplicable teats were processed during validation testing except for 201 
executable tests that use floating-point precision exceeding that supported 
by the implementation. Modifications to the code, processing, or grading 
for nine tests were required to successfully demonstrate the test 
objective. (See section 3.6.) 

The AVF concludes that the testing results demonstrate acceptable 

conformity to the Ada Standard.

3.5 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

Some tests do not apply to all compilers because they make use of features that 
a compiler is not required by the Ada Standard to support. Others may depend on 
the result of another test that is either inapplicable or withdrawn. The 
applicability of a test to an implementation is considered each time a 
validation is attempted. A test that is inapplicable for one validation attempt 
is not necessarily inapplicable for a subsequent attempt. For this validation 
attempt, 314 tests were inapplicable for the reasons indicated: 


a. The following 201 tests are not applicable because they have 
floating-point type declarations requiring more digits than 
SYSTEM.MAX DIGITS: 


C24113L..Y

because multiple internal files carjiot be associated with the same 
external file when one or more files is writing for text files. The 
proper exception is raised when multiple access is attempted. 


3.6 TEST, PROCESSING, AND EVALUATION MODIFICATIONS 

It is expected that some tests will require modifications of code, processing, 
or evaluation in order to conpensate for legitimate implementation behavior. 
Modifications are made by the AVF in cases where legitimate implementation 
behavior prevents the successful completion of an (otherwise) applicable test. 
Examples of such modifications include: adding a length clause to alter the 
default size of a collection; splitting a Class B test into subtests so that all 
errors are detected; and confirming that messages produced by an executable test 
demonstrate conforming behavior that wasn't anticipated by the test (such as 
raising one exception instead of another). 


3-5 




TEST INFORMATION 


Modifications were required for nine tests. 


The following tests were split because syntax errors at one point resulted in 
the cMipiler not detecting other errors in the test: 

BA3006A BA3006B BA3007B BA3008A BA3008B BA3013A 

03^0050, C34005J, and C34006D required evaluation modifications because the 

tests wrongly expect that an element of an array will not be represented more 
compactly within an array than a single object of that type. These tests output 
failed messages for the attribute *SIZE. 


3.7 ADDITIONAL TESTING INFORMATION 


3.7.1 Prevalidation 

Prior to validation, a set of test results for ACVC Version 1.10 produced by the 
Unisys 0 Series Ada Development System was submitted to the AVF by the applicant 
for review. Analysis of these results demonstrated that the compiler 
successfully passed all applicable tests, and the compiler exhibited the 
expected behavior on all inapplicable tests. 


3.7.2 Test Method 


Testing of the Unisys U Series Ada Development System using ACVC Version 1.10 
was conducted on-site by a validation teaun from the AVF. The configuration in 
which the testing was performed is described by the following designations of 
hardware and software components: 


Host computer; 

Host operating system; 
Target computer; 

Target operating system; 
Compiler; 


Unisys 5000/95 (MC68020)

Unisys 5000/95 (MC68020) 

UNISYS System V, Release 5.0 
Unisys U Series Ada Development 
System, Version 3.23 


A magnetic tape containing all tests except for withdrawn tests and tests 
requiring unsupported floating-point precisions was taken on-site by the 
validation team for processing. Tests that make use of implementation-specific 
values were customized before being written to the magnetic tape. Tests 
requiring modifications during the prevalidation testing were included in their 
modified form on the magnetic tape. 

The contents of the magnetic tape were loaded directly onto the host computer. 


3-6 








TEST INFORMATION 


After the test files were loaded to disk, the full set of tests was coopiled, 
linked, and all executable tests were run on the Unisys 5000/95 (MC68020). 
Results were printed from the host computer. 


The compiler was tested using command scripts provided by TeleSoft and reviewed 
by the validation team. The compiler was tested using all default option 
settings except for the following;

APPENDIX B 

APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


The only allowed implementation dependencies correspond to 
implementation-dependent pragmas, to certain machine-dependent conventions 
as mentioned in chapter 13 of the Ada Standard, and to certain allowed 
restrictions on representation clauses. The implementation-dependent 
characteristics of the Unisys D Series Ada Development System, Version 
3.23, as described in this Appendix, are provided by TeleSoft, Unless 
specifically noted otherwise, references in this Appendix are to compiler 
documentation and not to this report. Implementation-specific portions of 
the package STANDARD, which are not a part of Appendix F, are; 


package STANDARD is 


type INTEGER is range -32768 .. 32767; 

type LONG_INTEGER is range -21U74836U8 .. 2147483647; 

type FLOAT is digits 6 range -1.70141E+38 .. 1.70141E+38;

type DURATION is delta 2#1.0#E-14 range -86400. . '400.0; 


end STANDARD; 








APPENDIX I 


1. Implementation Dependent Pragmas 

pragma COMiVlENT(<string_liieral>). 

It may only appear within a compilation unit. 

The pragma comment has the effect of embedding the given 
sequence of characters in the object code of the compilation unit. 

pragma LINKNAME(<subprogram_name>. <string_literal> ji¬ 
lt may appear in any declaration section of a unit. 

This pragma must also appear directly after an interface pragma 
for the same <subprogram_name>. The pragma linkname has the 
effect of making string literal apparent to the linker. 

pragma INTERRUPT(Function_Mapping); 

It may only appear immediately before a simple accept statement, 
a while loop directly enclosing only a single accept statement, 
or a select statement that includes an interrupt accept alternative. 
The pragma interrupt has the effect that entry calls to the 
associated entry, on behalf of ar interrupt, are made with a 
reduced cal] overhead. 

pragma IMAGES(<enumeration_type>,Deferred) or 
pragma IMAGES(<enumeration_type>.Immediate): 

It may only appear within a compilation unit. 

The pragma images controls the creation and allocation of 
the image table for a specified enumeration type. The 
default is Deferred, which saves space in the literal pool 
by not creating an image table for an enumeration type 
unless the ’Image. ’Value, or ’Width attribute for the type 
is used. If one of these attributes is used, an image table 
is generated in the literal pool of the compilation unit in 
which the attribute appears. If the attributes are used in 
more than one compilation unit, more than one image table is 
generated, eliminating the benefits of deferring the table. 

pragma SUPPRESS_ALL; 

It may appear anywhere that a Suppress pragma may appear as 
defined by the Language Reference Manual. The pragma 
Suppress All has the effect of turning off all checks 
defined in section 11.7 of the Language Reference Manual. 

The scope of applicablility of this pragma is the same as 
that of the pre-defined pragma Suppress. 


B-2 






2. Implementation Dependent Attributes 


’Offset Attribute 

’Offset along with the attribute ’Address, facilitates machine code 
insertions. For a preffx P that denotes a declared parameter 
object, P’Offset yields the statically known portion of the 
address of the first of the storage units allocated to P. The 
value is the object’s offset relative to a base register and is 
of type Long_lnteger. 


INTEGER ATTRIBUTES 


’Extended_Image Attribute 


Usage: X’Extended_ln)age(ltem,Width,Base,Based.Spa«:e_IF_Positive) 

Returns the image associated with Item as per the Text_Io definition. 

The Text_Io definition states that the value of Item is an integer 

literal with no underlines, no exponent, no leading zeros 

(but a single zero for the zero value) and a minus sign if negative. 

If the resulting sequence of characters to be output has fewer than 
Width characters then leading spaces are first output to make up 
the difference. (LRM 14.3.7:10.14.3.7:11) 

For a prefix X that is a discrete type or subtype: this attribute 
is a function that may have more than one parameter. The parameter 
Item must be an integer value. The resulting string is 
without underlines, leading zeros, or trailing spaces. 


B-3 








Parameter Descriptions: 


Item — Tlie user specifies the item that iie wants the 

image of and passes it into the function. This 
parameter is required. 

Width — The user may specify the minimum number of 

characters to be in the string that is returned. 

If no w idth is specified then the default (0) is 
assumed. 

Base — The user may specify the base that the image is 

to be displayed in. If no base is specified then 
the default (10) is assumed. 

Based — The user may specify whether he wants the string 

returned to be in base notation or not. If no 
preference is specified then the default (false) 
is assumed. 

Space lf Positive -- The user may specify whether or not the sign bit 
of a positive integer is included in the string 
returned. If no preference is specified then 
the default (false) is assumed. 

Examples: 

Suppose the following subtype was declared: 

Subtype X is Integer Range -10..16: 

Then the following would be true: 

X’Extended_lmage(5) == "5" 

X’Extended_Image(5,0) = ”5” 

X’Extended_Image(5.2) = '' 5” 

X’Extended_Image(5,0.2) = "101” 

X’Extended_lmage(5.4.2) = " 101" 

X’Extended_Image(5,0.2.True) = "2#10liii" 

X’Extended_Image(5,0,10,False) = "5" 

X’Extended_Image(5,0.10,False,True) = " 5" 
X’Extended_Image(-l,0,10,False.False) = "-1" 
X’Extended_Image(-l,0,10.False.True) = "-1" 
X’Extended_lmage(-l.l,10.False.True) = "-1" 
X’Extended_Image(-l,0,2,True.True) = "-2#1#" 
X’Extended_lmage(-1.10.2,True.True) = " -2#1#" 


B-4 








'Extended Value Attribute 


Usage: X’Extended_Value(ltem) 

Returns the value associated with Item as per the Text lo definition. 
The Text lo definition states that given a string, it reads an 
integer value from the beginning of the string. The value returned 
corresponds to the sequence input. (LRM 14.3.7:14) 

For a prefix X that is a discrete type or subtype; this attribute 
is a function with a single parameter. The actual parameter Item 
must be of predefined type string. Any leading or trailing 
spaces in the string X are ignored. In the case where an illegal 
string is passed, a CONSTRAlNT_ERROR is raised. 

Parameter Descriptions: 

Item — The user passes to the function a parameter of the 
predefined type string. The type of the returned 
value is the base type X. 

Examples: 

Suppose the following subtype was declared: 

Subtype X is Integer Range -10.. 16: 

Then the following would be true: 

X ’Extended _V alue (" 5") 

X’Extended_Value{" 5”) 

X’Extended_Value("2i!tl01#") 

X’Extended _V alue("-1 ”) 

X’Extended_Value(" -1") 



B-5 




’Extended Width Attribute 

lisage; X'Extended Width (Base.Based .SpacelfPositive) 

Returns the width for subtype of X. 

For a prefix X that is a discrete subtype: this attribute 
is a function that may have multiple parameters. This attribute 
yields the maximum image length over all values of the type 
or subtype X. 


Parameter Descriptions: 

Base -- The user specifies the base for which the width 

will be calculated. If no base is s]>ecified 
then the default (10) is assumed. 

Based ~ The user specifies whether the subtype is stated 

in based notation. If no value for based is 
specified then the default (false) is assumed. 

Space_If_Positive — The user may specify whether or not the sign bit 
of a positive integer is included in the string 
returned. If no preference is specified then the 
default (false) is assumed. 

Examples: 

Suppose the following subtype was declared: 

Subtype X is Integer Range -10..16; 


Then the following would be true: 


X’ExtendedWidth 

X’Extended _W idth (10) 

X’Extended_Width(2) 

X’Extended_W’idth(lO,True) 

X’Extended_Width(2,True) 

X’Extended_Width(10,False,True) 

X’Extended_Width(10,True,False)

B-6 




ENUMERATION ATTRIBUTES 


’Extended Image Attribute 

Usage: X’Extended_Image(Item.Width,Uppercase) 

Returns the image associated with Item as per the Text io definition. 
The Text_lo definition states that given an enumeration literal, 
it will output the value of the enumeration literal (either an 
identifier or a character literal). The character case parameter 
is ignored for character literals. (LRM 14.3.9:9) 

For a prefix X that is a discrete type or subtype; this attribute 
is a function that may have more that one parameter. The parameter 
Item must be an enumeration value. The image of an enumeration 
value is the corresponding identifier which may have character case 
and return string width specified. 


Parameter Descriptions: 

Item -- The user specifies the item that he wants the image of and 
passes it into the function. This parameter is required. 

Width — The user may specify the minimum number of characters to 
be in the string that is returned. If no width is 
sjjecified then the default (0) is assumed. If the Width 
specified is larger than the image of Item, then the 
return string is paddeo with trailing spaces: if the 
Width specified is smaller than the image of Item then 
the default is assumed and tne image of the enumeration 
value is output completely. 

Uppercase — The user may specify whether the returned string is in 
uppercase characters. In the case of an enumeration 
type where the enumeration literals are character 
literals, the Uppercase is ignored and the case

Item — The user specifies the item that he wants the image of and 
passes it into the function. This parameter is required. 

Fore — The user may specify the minimum number of characters for 
the integer part of the decimal representation in the 
return string. This includes a minus sign if the 
value is negative and the base with the if based 
notation is specified. If the integer part to be output 
has fewer characters than specified by Fore, then leading 
spaces are output first to make up the difference. If no 
Fore is specified then the defaul: (2) value is assumed. 

Aft — The user may specify the minimum number of decimal digits 
after the decimal point to accommodate the precision desired. 
If the delta of the type or subtype is greater than 
0.1 then Aft is one. If no Aft is specified then the 
default (X'Digits-l) is assumed. If based notation is 
specified the trailing is included in aft. 

Exp — The user may specify the minimum number of digits in the 
exponent; the exponent consists of a sign and the exponent, 
possibly with leading zeros. If no Exp is specified then 
the default (3 ) is assumed. If Exp is 0 then no exponent

4. Restrictions on Representation Clauses 


The Compiler supports the following representation clauses; 

Length Clauses: for enumeration and derived integer types ’SIZE 
attribute (LRM 13.2(a)) 

Length Clauses: for access types ’STORAGE SIZE attritube (LRMl3.2(b)) 
Length Clauses; for tasks types ’STOR.4GE_SIZE attribute (LRM 13.2(c)) 
Length Clauses: for fixed point types ’SMALL attribute (LRMl3.2(d)) 
Enumeration Clauses: for character and enumeration types other than 
^ boolean (LRM 13.3) 

Record representation Clauses (LRM 13.4) with following constraints; 

- Each component of the record must be 
specified with a component clause. 

- The alignment of the record is restricted to 
mod 2. word (16 bit)aiigned. 

- Bits are ordered right to left within a byte. 

Address Clauses: for objects, entries, and external subprograms 

(LRM 13.5(a)(c)) 

This compiler docs NOT support the following representation clauses: 

Enumeration Clauses: for boolean (LRM 13.3) 

Address Clauses for packages, task units, or non-external .\da 
subprograms (LRM 13.5(b)) 

5. Implementation dependent naming conventions 

There are no implementation-generated names denoting 
implementation depended t components. 

6. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clause 

Expressions that appear in address specifications are interpreted 
as the first storage unit of the object.

7. Resiriclions on Unchecked Conversions 


Unchecked conversions are allowed between any types or subtypes unless 
the target type is an unconstrained record or array type. 


8. I/O Package Characteristics 

Sequential lO and Direct_IO cannot be instantiated for 
unconstrained array types or unconstrained types with discriminants 
without default values. 

Multiple files opened to the same external file may be opened 
only for reading. 

In TEXT JO. DIRECT IO, or SEQUENTUL IO, calling procedure Create 
with a name of an existing external file does not raise an 
exception. Instead, it creates a new version of the file. 

In DIRECT_10 the type COUNT is defined as follows: 

type COUNT is range 0..2_147_483_647; 

In TEXT lO the type COUNT is defined as follows: 

type COUNT is range 0 .. 2_147_483_646; 

In TEXT IO the subtype FIELD is defined as follows: 

subtype FIELD is INTEGER range 0..1000; 

According to the latest interpretation of the LRM. during a 
TEXT IO.Get Line call, if the buffer passed in has been filled, 
the call is completed and any succeeding characters and/or 
terminators (e.g., line, page, or end-of-file) will not be read. 

The first Get_Line call will read the line up to but not 
including the end-of-line mark, and the second Get_Line will read 
and skip the end-of-line mark left by the first read.

APPENDIX D 
WITHDRAWN TESTS 


Some tests are withdrawn from the ACVC because they do not conform to the 
Ada St3mdard. The following 43 tests had been withdrawn at the time of 
validation testing for the reasons indicated. A reference of the form 
Al-ddddd is to an Ada Commentary. 


a. E28005C; This test expects that the string TOP OF PAGE. —63" of 
line 204 will appear at the top of the listing page due to a pragma 
PAGE in line 203; but line 203 contains text that follows the pragma, 
and it is this text that must appear at the top of the page. 

b. A39005G; This test unreasonably expects a component clause to pack an 
array component into a minimum size (line 30). 

c. B97102E; This test contains an unintended illegality: a select 
statement contains a null statement at the place of a selective wait 
alternative (line 31)* 

d. BC3009B: This test wrongly expects that circular instantiations will 
be detected in several compilation units even though none of the units 
is illegal with respect to the units it depends on; by AI-00256, the 
illegality need not be detected until execution is attempted (line 
95). 

e. CD2A62D: This test wrongly requires that an array object's size be no 
greater than 10 although its subtype's size was specified to be 40 
(line 137). 

f. CD2A63A..D, CD2A66A..D, CD2A73A..D, and CD2A76A..D (16 tests); These 

tests wrongly attempt to check the size of objects of a derived type 
(for which a 'SIZE length clause is given) by passing them to a 
derived subprogram (which implicitly converts them to the parent type 
(Ada standard 3*4:14)). Additionally, they use the 'SIZE length 
clause and attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic 
by the WG9 ARG. 






WITHDRAWN TESTS 


g. CD2A81G, CD2A83G, CD2A84M..N, and CD50110 (5 tests): These tests 

assume that dependent tasks will terminate whi. e the main program 
executes a loop that simply tests for task termination; this is not 
the case, and the main program may loop indefinitely (lines 7 ^, 85, 
86, 96, and 58, respectively). 

h. CD2B15C and CD7205C: These tests expect that a 'STORAGE_SIZE length 
clause provides precise control over the number of designated objects 
in a collection; the Ada standard 13.2:15 allows tnat such control 
must not be expected. 

i. CD2D11B; This test gives a SMALL representation clause for a derived 
fixed-point type (at line 30) that defines a set of model numbers that 
are not necessarily represented in the parent type; by Commentary 
AI-00099, all model numbers of a derived fixed-point type must be 
representable values of the parent type. 

j. CD5007B: This test wrongly expects an implicitly declared subprogram 
to be at the address that is specified for an unrelated subprogram 
(line 303). 

k. ED700MB, ED7005C..D, and ED7006C..D (5 tests): These tests check 
various aspects of the use of the three SYSTEM pragmas; the AVO 
withdraws these tests as being inappropriate for validation. 

l. CD7105A: This test requires that successive calls to CALENDAR.CLOCK 
change by at least SYSTEM.TICK; however, by Commentary AI-00201, it is 
only the expected frequency of change that must be at least 
SYSTEM.TICK—particular instances of change may be less (line 29). 

m. CD7203B and CD720ilB: These tests use the *SIZE length clause and 
attribute, whose interpretation is considered problematic by the WG9 
ARG. 

n. CD7205D; This test checks an invalid test objective: it treats the 
specification of storage to be reserved for a taisk's activation as 
though it were like the specification of storage for a collection. 

o. CE2107I; This test requires that objects of two similar scalar types 
be distinguished when read from a file—DATA_ERR0K is expected to be 
raised by an attempt to read one object m of the other type. 
However, it is not clear exactly how the Ada stauidard 1U.2.M:4 is to 
be interpreted; thus, this test objective is not considered valid 
(line 90). 

p. CE3111C; This test requires certain behavior, when two files are 
associated with the same external file, that is not required by the 
Ada standard. 

q. CE3301A: This test contains several calls to END_0F_LINE and 
END_0F_PAGE that have no parameter: these calls were intended to 
specify a file, not to refer to STANDARD_INPUT (lines 103, 107, 118,

132 , and 136 ). 

CE3^11B: This test requires that a text file's column number be set to 
COUNT'LAST in order to check that LAYOUT_ERROR is raised by a 
subsequent PUT operation. But the former operation will generally 
raise aui exception due to a lack of available disk space, and the test 
would thus encumber validation testing.
