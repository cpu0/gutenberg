INTRODUCTION 


The Ada implementation described above was tested according to the Ada 
Validation Procedures [Pro90] against the Ada Standard [Ada83] using the 
current Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC). This Validation Summary 
Report (VSR) gives an account of the testing of this Ada implementation. 

For any technical terms used in this report, the reader is referred to 
[Pro90]. A detailed description of the ACVC may be found in the current 
ACVC User's Guide (UG89].

1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: 

A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class 
to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B 
and class L tests are expected to produce errors at compile time and link 
time, respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result when they 
are executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, 
and the procedure CHECK_FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT 
also provides, a set of identity functions used to defeat some compiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately compiled units. Errors 
are expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In seme tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values — for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in Appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and implementation- 
dependent characteristics. The modifications required for this 

implementation are described in Section 2.3. 


1-2 



INTRODUCTION 


For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by the AVF, 
This customization consists of making the modifications described in the 
preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see Section 2.1) ana, 
possibly some inapplicable tests (see Section 2.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each test of 
the customized test ?uite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are irrelevant 
for a given Ada implementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may 
be supported by documents issued by ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and commonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Commentaries are included as 
appropriate.

CD7101F 

C35404D, C45231D, B86001X, C86006E, and CD7101G check for a predefined 
integer type with a name other than INTEGER, LONG_INTEGER, or SHORT_INTEGER. 

C35713B, C45423B, B86001T, and C86006H check for the predefined type 
SHORT_FLOAT. 

C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with a name 
other than FLOAT, LONG_FLOAT, or SHORT_FLOAT. 

A35801E checks that FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST may be used as a range constraint 
in a floating-point type declaration; for this implementation, that range 
exceeds the range of safe numbers of the largest predefined floating-point 
type and must be rejected, (see 2.3.) 

C45531M..P (4 tests) and C45532M..p (4 tests) check fixed-point operations 
for types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or greater; for this 
implementation, there is no such type. 

C45536A, C46013B, C46031B, C46033B, and C46034B contain 'SMALL 

representation clauses which are not powers of two or ten. 

C45624A and C45624B are not applicable as MACHINE_OVERFLOWS is TRUE for 
floating-point types. 


2-2 



IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


B86001Y checks for a predefined fixed-point type other than DURATION. 

CA2009A, CA2009C..D (2 tests), CA2009F and BC3009C instantiate generic units 
before their bodies are compiled; this implementation creates a dependence on 
generic units as allowed by AI-00408 & AI-00506 such that the compilation of 
the generic unit bodies makes the instantiating units obsolete, (see 2.3.) 

CD1009C uses a representation clause specifying a non-default size for a 
floating-point type. 

CD2A53A checks operations of a fixed-point type for whicli a length clause 
specifies a power-of-ten type'small; this implementation does not support 
decimal smalls, (see 2.3.) 

CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use -epresentation 
clauses specifying non-default sizes for access types. 

CD2B15B checks that STORAGE_ERROR is raised when the storage size specified 
for a collection is too small to hold a single value of the designated type; 
this implementation allocates more space than what- the length clause 
specified, as allowed by AI-00558.

E28002B was graded inapplicable by Evaluation and Test Modification as 
directed by the AVO. This test chec)cs that pragmas may have unresolvable 
arguments, and it includes a chec)c that pragma LIST has the required effect; 
but for this implementation, pragma LIST has no effect if the compilation 
results in errors or warnings, which is the case when the test is processed 
without modification. This test was also processed with the pragmas at lines 
46, 58, 70 and 71 commented out so that pragma LIST had effect. 

A35801E was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by the 
AVO; the compiler rejects the use of the range FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LASTas the 
range constraint of a floating-point type declaration because the bounds lie 
outside of the range of safe numbers (cf. LRM 3.5.7(12)). 

Tests C45524A..E (5 tests) were graded passed by Test Modification as 
directed by the AVO. These tests expect that a repeated division will result 
in zero; but the standard only requires that the result lie in the smallest 
safe interval. Thus, the tests were modified to chec)« that the result was 


2-4 



IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


within the smallest safe interval by adding the following code after line 
141; the modified tests were passed: 

ELSIF VAL <= F'SAFE SMALL THEN COMMENT ("UNDERFLOW SEEMS GRADUAL"); 


C83030C and C86007A were graded passed by Test Modification as directed by 
the AVO. These tests were modified by inserting "PRAGMA ELABORATE (REPORT);" 
before the package declarations at lines 13 and 11, respectively. Without the 
pragma, the packages may be elaborated prior to package report's body, and 
thus the packages' calls to function Report.Ident_Int at lines 14 and 13, 
respectively, will raise PROGRAM_ERROR. 

B83E01B was graded passed by Evaluation Modification as directed by the AVO. 
This test checks that a generic subprogram's formal parameter names (i.e. 
both generic and subprogram formal parameter names) must be distinct; the 
duplicated names within the generic declarations are marked as errors, 
whereas their recurrences in the subprogram bodies are marked as "optional" 
errors—except for the case at line 122, which is marked as an error. This 
implementation does not additionally flag the errors in the bodies and thus 
the expected error at line 122 is not flagged. The AVO ruled that the 
implementation's behavior was acceptable and that the test need not be split 
(such a split would simply duplicate the case in B83E01A at line 15). 


CA2009A, CA2009C..D (2 tests), CA2009F and BC3009C were graded inapplicable 
by Evaluation Modification as directed by the AVO. These tests instantiate 
generic units before those units' bodies are compiled; this implementation 
creates dependences as allowed by AI-00408 & AI-00506 such that the 
compilation of the generic unit bodies makes the instantiating units 
obsolete, and the objectives of these tests cannot be met. 


BC3204C and BC3205D were graded passed by Processing Modification as directed 
by the AVO. These tests check that instantiations of generic units with 
unconstrained types as generic actual parameters are illegal if the generic 
bodies contain uses of the types that require a constraint. However, the 
generic bodies are compiled after the units that contain the instantiations, 
and this implementation creates a dependence of the instantiating units on 
the generic units as allowed by AI-00408 & AI-00506 such that the compilation 
of the generic bodies makes the instantiating units obsolete—no errors are 
detected. The processing of these tests was modified by compiling the 
separate files in the following order (to allow re-compilation of obsolete 
units), and all intended errors were then detected by the compiler: 


BC3204C: 

o 

o 

Cl, 

C2, C3M, C4, C5, C6, C3M 

BC3205D: 

o 

O 

D2, 

DIM

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 

BC3204D and BC3205C were graded passed by Test Modification as directed by 
the AVO. These tests are similar to BC3204C and BC3205D above, except that 
all compilation units are contained in a single compilation. For these two 
tests, a copy of the main procedure (which later units make obsolete) was 
appended to the tests; all expected errors were then detected. 

CD2A53A was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by the 
AVO. The test contains a specification of a power-of-ten value as small for 
a fixed-point type. The AVO ruled that, under ACVC 1.11, support of decimal 
smalls may be omitted. 


AD9001B and AD9004A were graded passed by Processing Modification as directed 
by the AVO. These tests check that various subprograms may be interfaced to 
external routines (and hence have no Ada bodies). This implementation 
requires that a file specification exists for the foreign subprogram bodies. 
The following command was issued to the Librarian to inform it that the 
foreign bodies will be supplied at link time (as the bodies are not actually 
needed by the program, this command alone is sufficient: 

ALC30 interface/system AD9004A 

CE2103A, CE2103B and CE3107A were graded inapplicable by Evaluation 
Modification as directed by the AVO. The tests abort with an unhandled 
exception when USE_ERROR is raised on the attempt to create an external file. 
This is acceptable behavior because this implementation does not support 
external files (cf. AI-00332).

Testing of this Ada implementation was conducted at the customer's site by a 
validation team from the AVF. 


3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming

Language Standard, whether the test is applicable or inapplicable; 
otherwise, the Ada Implementation fails the ACVC [Pro90]. 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard.

The above number of I/O tests were not processed because this implementation 
does not support a file system. The above number of floating-point tests were 
not processed because they used floating-point precision exceeding that 
supported by the implementation. When this compiler was tested, the tests 
21isted in Section 2.1 had been withdrawn because of test errors. 


3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

Version 1.11 of the ACVC comprises 4170 tests. When this compiler was 
tested, the tests listed in Section 2.1 had been withdrawn because of test 
errors. The AVF determined that 635 tests were inapplicable to this 
implementation. All inapplicable tests were processed during validation 
testing except for 285 executable tests that use floating-point precision 
exceeding that supported by the implementation and 264 executable tests that 
use file operations not supported by the implementation. In addition, the 
modified tests mentioned in Section 2.3 were also processed. 

A Magnetic Tape Reel containing the customized test suite (see Section 1.3) 
was taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
tape were loaded directly onto the host computer. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host computer, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 

The tests were compiled and linked on the host computer system, as 
appropriate. The executable images were transferred to the target computer 
system by the communications link, an RS232 Interface, and run. The results 
were captured on the host computer system. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the customer and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a complete listing of 
the processing options for this implementation. It also indicates the

default options. The options invoked explicitly for validation testing 

during this test were: 

options used for compiling: 

/replace forces the compiler to accept an attempt to compile a unit 

imported from another library which is normally prohibited. 

/nosave_source suppresses the creation of a registered copy of the source 
code in the library directory for use by the REMAKE and MAKE 
subcommands. 

/list=always forces a listing to be produced, default is to only produce 
a listing when an error occurs. 


No explicit Linker options were used. 

Test output, compiler and linker listings, and job logs were captured on a 
Magnetic Tape Reel and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site by 
the validation team were also archived.

APPENDIX B- 


COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


The compiler options of this Ada implementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted otherwise, 
references in this appendix are to compiler dociimentation and not to this 
report. 


B-1 







Compilation switches for Tartan Ada VMS C30. 

/MOCROSS_REFER£MCE [defaillt] 

Controls whether the compiler generates a 
cross-reference table of linlcnaaies for the 
coB^ilation unit. The table will be placed in 
the file unit-name.XRF (See Section 3.6). 


/CALLSHORTRANGE Generates 16-bit PC-relative conditional call 

instructions. By using this option, the user 
asserts that the prograa space for the final 
program will be small enough for all calls to 
use the 16-bit PC-relative conditional call 
instruction. If the assertion is in fact 
incorrect, erroneous code could result. 


/ERROR_LIMITsn Stop compilation and produce a listing after 

n errors are encountered, where n is in the 
range 0..255. The default value for n is 
255. The /ERROR_LIMIT qualifier cannot be 
negated. 


/FIXUP[=option] When package MACHINE_CODE is used, controls 

whether the compiler attempts to alter 
operand address modes ,when those address 
modes are used incorrectly. The available 
options are: 

QUIET The compiler attempts to generate 
extra instructions to fix incorrect 
address modes in the array ag¬ 
gregates operand field. 

WARN The compiler attempts to generate 

extra instructions to fix incorrect 
address modes. A warning message 
is issued if such a ''fixup'' is 
required. 

NONE The compiler does not attempt to 

fix any miachine code insertion that 
has incorrect address modes. An 
error miessage is issued for any 
miachine code insertion that is 
incorrect. 

When no form of this qualifier is supplied in 
the coamnand line, the default condition is 
/FIXUP«QUIET. For more information on 

machine code insertions, refer to section 
5.10 of this manual. 


/LIBRARYsiibrary-name Specifies the library into which the file is 

to be compiled. The compiler reads any 



2 


/LIST[=option] 
/NOLIST 


/MACHINE_CODE 
/NOMACHINE CODE 


/NOENUMIMAGE 


AOALIB.INI files in the default directory. 


Controls whether a listing file is produced. 
If produced, the file has the source file 
name and a .LIS extension. The available 
options are: 


AIMAYS Always produce a listing 

file 

NEVER Never produce a listing 

file, equivalent to /NOLIST 
ERROR Produce a listing file only 

if a cozopilation error or 

warning occurs 


When no form of this qualifier is supplied in 
the command line, the default condition is 
/LIST=ERROR. When the LIST qualifier is 
supplied without an option, the default 
option is AIWAYS. 


[default] 

Controls whether the assembly code files 
produced by the compiler are retained in the 
user's directory after compilation is 
con^lete. This qualifier is useful if the 
user wishes to inspect the conpiler output 
for code correctness and quality. The 
default is /NOMACHINE which deletes these 
machine language files. 


Causes the conpiler to omit data segments 
with the text of enumeration literals. This 
text is normally produced for exported 
entsaeration types in order to support the 
text attributes ('IMAGE, 'VALUE and 'WIDTH). 
You should use /NOENDMIMAGE only when you can 
guarantee that no unit that will import the 
enumeration type will use any of its text 
attributes. However, if you are conpiling a 
unit with an enumeration type that is not 
visible to other compilation units, this 
qualifier is not needed. The conpiler can 
recognize when the text attributes are not 
used and will not generate the supporting 
strings.The /NOENDMIMAGE qualifier cannot be 
negated. 

Inform the cospiler that no loops will iter¬ 
ate more than 2**23 times. This includes non¬ 
user specified lor ■as, such as those generated 
by the cospiler to operate on large objects. 
If the assertion is in fact, incorrect, 


/NOHUGELOOPS 








3 


/NODEIAYEDBRANCHES 

/OPT=n 


erxon«ous coda could rasult. 

Do not generate delayed branch instructions. 


Controls the level of optimization performed 
by the compiler, requested by n. The /OPT 
qualifier cannot be negated. The optimiza¬ 
tion levels available are: 

n s 0 Minimum - Performs context 
determination, constant 

folding, algebraic manipula¬ 
tion, and short circuit 
analysis. Inlines are not 
expanded. 

n = 1 Low - Performs level 0 

optimizations plus common 
subexpression elimination 
and equivalence propagation 
within basic blochs. It 
also optimizes evaluation 
order. Znlines are not 
expanded. 

n s 2 Best tradeoff for space/time 
- the default level. * Per¬ 

forms level 1 optimizations 
plus flow analysis which is 
used for conmon subexpres¬ 
sion elimination and equiv¬ 
alence propagation across 
basic blocks. It also 

performs invariant expres¬ 
sion hoisting, dead code 

elimination, and assignment 
killing. Level 2 also 

performs lifetime analysis 
to improve register alloca¬ 
tion. It also performs 

inline expansion of sub¬ 

program calls indicated by 
Pragma INLINE, if possible. 

n s 3 Time - Performs level 2 

optimizations plus inline 
expansion of subprogram 
calls which the optimizer 

decides are profitable to 

expand (from an execution 
time perspective). Other 
optimizations which improve 
execution time at a cost to 
image size are performed 

only at this level. 


n s= 4 


Space 


Performs those 








4 


optimixatxons which usually 
produce the smallest code, 
often at the expense of 
speed. This optimization 
level may not always produce 
the smallest code, however, 
another level may produce 
smaller code under certain 
conditions. 


/PHASES 

/NOPHASES [default] Controls whether the compiler announces each 

phase of processing as it occurs. These 
phases indicate progress of the compilation. 
If there is an error in compilation, the 
error message will direct users to a specific 
location as opposed to the more general 
/PHASES. 


/SUPPRESS[=(option, ...)] 

Suppresses the specific checks identified by 
the options supplied. The parentheses may be 
omitted if only one option is supplied. The 
/SUPPRESS qualifier has the same effect as a 
global pragma SUPPRESS applied to the source 
file. If the source program also contains a 
pragma SUPPRESS, then a given check is 
suppressed if either the pragma or the 
qualifier specifies it; that is, the effect 
of a pragma SUPPRESS cannot be negated with 
the command line qualifier. The /SUPPRESS 
qualifier cannot be negated. 

The available options are: 

ALL Suppress all 

checks. This 
is the default 
if the 

qualifier is 
supplied with 
no option. 

ACCESS_CHECK As specified in 

the Ada LRM, 
Section 11.7. 

CONSTRAINTJCHECK Equivalent of

result of a new 
operation. 

Specify the nunber of wait states for the 
memory in which the branch code will be gen¬ 
erated. It affects the code generated for 
the delayed branches and for loops. The 
default value is 2 wait states. 


Controls whether the warning messages 
generated by the compiler are displayed to 
the user at the terminal and in a listing 
file, if produced. While supressing warning 
messages also halts display of informational 
messages, it does not suppress Error, 
Fatal Error.

COMMAND QUALIFIERS 

This section describes the cossnand qualifiers available to a user who directly 
invokes the linker. The qualifier names can be abbreviated to unique 
prefixes; the first letter is sufficent for all current qualifier names. The 
qualifier names are not case sensitive. 


/COMTROLsfile

The specified file contains linker control commands. 
Only one such file may be specified, but it can 
include other files using the CONTROL command. Every 
invocation of the linker must specify a control file. 

The specified file is the name of the first output 
object file. The module name for this file will be 
ntill. Only one output file siay be specified in this 
manner. Additional output files aiay be specified in 
the linker control file. 

Produce a link map showing the section allocations. 

Produce a link map showing the unused sections. 

Produce a link map showing global and external 
symbols. 

This causes the linker to not perform unused section 
elimination. Specifying this option will generally 
make your program larger, since unreferenced data 
within object files will not be eliminated. Refer to 
Sections RESOLVE_CMD and USE_PROCESSING for infor¬ 
mation on the way that unused section elimination 
works. 

Produce a link map containing all information except 
the unused section listings. 


Note that several listing options are permitted. This is because link maps 
for real systems can become rather large, and writing them consumes a 
significant fraction of the total link time. Options specifying the contents 
of the link map can be combined, in which case the resulting map will contain 
all the information specified by any of the switches. The name of the file 
containing the link map is specified by the LIST command in the linker control 
file. If your control file does not specify a name and you request a listing, 
the listing will be written to the default output stream.

Chapter 4 

Appendix F to MIL-STD~1815A 


This chapter contains the required Appendix F to the LRM which is Military Standard, Ada Programming 

Language, ANSI/MIL-STD-181SA (American National Standards Institute, Inc., February 17,1983). 

4.1. PRAGMAS 

4.1.1. Predefined Pragmas 

This section summarizes the effects of and restrictions on predefined pragmas. 

• Access collections are not subject to automatic storage reclamation so pragma controlled has no effect 
Space deallocated by means of unchecked_deallocation will be reused by the allocation of new 
objects. 

• Pragma elaborate is supported. 

• Pragma INLINE is supported. 

• Pragma INTERFACE is supported. The Language_Naine TI_C is used to make calls to subprograms 
(written in the Texas Instruments C language) from Tartan Ada. Any other Language_Name will be 
accepted, but ignored, and the default will be used. 

• Pragma list is supported but has the intended effea only if the command qualifier list>alhays was 
supplied for compilioion, and the listing generated was not due to the presence of enors and/or warnings. 

• Pragma memory_size is accepted but no value other than that specified in Package SYSTEM (Section 

4.3) is allowed. 

• Pragma optimize is supported except when at the outer level (that is, in a package specification or 
body). 

• Pragma PACK is supported. 

• Pragma PAGE is supported but has the intended effect only if the command qualifier list-always was 
supplied for compil^on, and the listing generated was not due to the presence of errors and/or warnings. 

• Pragma priority is supported. 

• Pragma storage_unit is accepted but no value other than that specified in Package system (Section 

4.3) is allowed. 

• Pragma shared is not supported. No warning is issued if it is supplied. 

• Pragma SUPPRESS is supported. 

• Pragma SYSTEM_name is accepted but no value other than that specified in Package SYSTEM (Section 

4.3) is allowed.

USER MANUAL FOR TARTAN ADA VMS OO 


4.12.1. Pragma LINKAGE_NAME 

The pragma linicage_name associates an Ada entity with a string that is meaningful externally; e.g., to a 
linkage editor. It takes the form 

pragma linkage_NAME {Ada-simple-name, string-constant) 

The Ada-simple-name must be the name of an Ada entity declared in a package specification. This entity must be 
one that has a runtime representation: e.g., a subprogram, exception or object It may not be a named number or 
string constant The pragma must appear after the declaration of the entity in the same package specification. 

The effect of the pragma is to cause the string-constant to be used in the generated assembly code as an 
external name for the associated Ada entity. It is the responsibility of the user to guarantee that this string 
constant is meaningful to the linkage editor and that no illegal linkname clashes arise. 

This pragma has no effect when applied to a library subprogram or to a renames declaration; in the latter case, 
no warning message is given. 

When determining the maximum allowable length for the extental linkage name, keep in mind that the 
compiler will generate names for elaboration flags simply by appending the suffix #GOTO. Therefore, the 
external linkage name has S fewer significant characters thw the lower limit of other tools that need to process 
the name (e.g., 40 in the case of the Tartan Linker). 

4.122. Pragma FORElGN_BODY 

In addition to Pragma interface. Tartan Ada supplies Pragma foreign_body as a way to access 
subprograms in other languages. 

Unlike Pragma interface. Pragma FOR£lGN_BODY allows access to objects and exceptions (in addition 
to subprograms) to and from other languages. 

Some restrictions on Pragma FORElGN_BODY that are not applicable to Pragma INTERFACE are: 

• Pragma FOREIGN_body must appear in a non-generic library package. 

• All objects, exceptions and subprograms in such a package must be supplied by a foreign object module. 

• Types may not be declared in such a package. 

Use of the pragma foreign_body dictates that all subprograms, exceptions and objects in the package are 
provided by means of a foreign object module. In order to successfully link a program including a foreign body, 
the object module for that body must be provided to the library using the ALBC30 FOREIGN_body command 
described in Section LIB-FOREIGN. The pragma is of the form: 

pragma F0REIGN_B00Y {Languagejuime [, elaborationjoudnejume ]) 

The parameter Language jume is a string intended to allow the compiler to identify the calling convention used 
by the foreign module (but this functionality is not yet in operation). Currently, the programmer must ensure that 
the calling convention and data representation of the foreign body procedures are compatible with those used by 
the Tartan Ada compiler. Subprograms called by tasks should be reentranL 

The optional elaboration_roMine_nam string argument is a linkage name identifying a routine to initialize 
the package. The routine specified as the elaborationj-outinejiame, which will be called for the elaboration of 
this package body, must be a global routine in the object module provided by the user. 

A specification that uses this pragma may contain only subprogram declarations, object decarations that use 
an unconstrained type mark, and number declarations. Pragmas may also appear in the package. The type marie 
for an object cannot be a task type, and the object declaration must not have an initial value expression. The 
pragma must be given prior to any declarations within the package specification^ If the pragma is not located 
before the fust declaration, or any restriction on the declarations is violated, the pragma is ignored and a warning 
is generated. 

The foreign body is entirely responsible for initializing objects declared in a package utilizing pragma 
FOREiGN_BODY. In particular, the user should be aware that the implicit initializations described in LRM 3.2.1 
are not done by the compiler. (These implicit initializations are associated with objects of access types, certain 
record types and composite types containing components of the preceding kinds of types.) 


4-2 




APPEKDK F TO MIL-STD-1815A 


Pragma linkage_NAME should be used for all declarations in the package, including any declarations in a 
nested package specification to be sure that there are no conflicting link names. If pragma linkage_name is 
not used, the cross-reference qualifier, /CROSS_R£FERENCE, (see Section 3.2) sh^d be used when invoking 
the compiler and the resulting cross-reference table of linknames inspected to identify the linknames assigned by 
the compiler and determine that there are no conflicting linknames (see also Section 3.5). In the following 
example, we want to call a function plmn which computes polynomials and is written in C. 

package math_functions is 
pragma foreign_body ("C"); 

function POLYNOMIAL (X: INTEGER) return INTEGER; 

—Ada spec matching the C routine 
pragma LINKAGE_NAME (polynomial, "plmn"); 

—Force compiler to use name "plmn" when referring to this 
— function 

end MATH_FUNCTIONS; 

with MATH_FUNCTIONS; USe MATH_FUNCTIONS; 

procedure main is 

X:INTEGER POLYNOMIAL (10) ; 

— Will generate a call to "plmn" 

begin .. . 

end MAIN; 

To compile, link and run the above fMogram, you do the following steps: 

1. Compile MATH_FUNCTIONS 

2. Compile main 

3. Obtain an object module (e.g. math. TOF) containing the compiled code for plmn. 

4. Issue the command 

ALBC30 FOREIGN_BODY math_functions MATH.TOF 

5. Issue the command 

ALBC30 LINK MAIN 

Without Stq) 4, an attempt to link will produce an error message informing you of a missing package body for 
MATH_FUNCTIONS. 

Using an Ada body from another Ada program library. The user may compile a body written in Ada for a 
speciflcation into the library, regardless of the language specified in the pragma contained in the specification, 
lliis capability is useful for rapid prototyping, where an Ada package may serve to provide a simulated response 
for the functionality that a foreign body may eventually produce. It also allows the user to rqilace a foreign body 
with an Ada body without recompiling the specification. 

The user can either compile an Ada body into the library, or use the command ALBC30 foreign_body 
(see Section LIB-FOREIGN) to use an Ada body from another library. The Ada body from another library must 
have been compiled under an identical specification. The pragma linkage_name must have been applied to 
all entities declared in the specification. The only way to specify the linkname for the elaboration routine of an 
Ada body is with the pragma FORElGN__BODY. 

4.2. IMPLEMENTATION-DEPENDENT ATTRIBUTES 

No implementation-dependent attributes are currently supported.

4.4. RESTRICTIONS ON REPRESENTATION CLAUSES 

The following sections explain the basic restrictions for representation specifications followed by additional 
restrictions applying to specific kinds of clauses. 

4.4.1. Basic Restriction 

The basic restriction on representation specifications [LRM 13.1] is that they may be given only f(»' types 
declared in terms of a type definition, excluding a generic_type_de£inition (LRM 12.1) and a 
private_type_de£inition (LRM 7.4). Any {presentation clause in violation of these rules is not obeyed 
by the compiler, an error message is issued. 

Further restrictions are explained in the following sections. Any representation clauses violating those restric* 
tions cause compilation to stop and a diagnostic message to be issued. 

4.4 J. Length Clauses 

Length clauses [LRM 13.2] are, in general, supported. For details, refer to the ftdlowing sections. 

4j42.I. Siae Specifications for Types 

The rules and restrictions for size specifications applied to types of various classes are described below. 

The following principle rules apply: 

1. The size is specified in bits and must be given by a static expression. 

2. The specified size is taken as a mandate to store objects of the type in the given size wherever feasible. 
No attempt is made to store values of the type in a smaller size, even if possible. The following rules 
apply with regard to feasibility; 

• An object that is not a component of a composite object is allocated with a size and alignment that 
is referable on the target machine; that is, no attempt is made to create objects of non-referable size 
on the stack. If such stack compression is desired, it can be achieved by the user by combining 
multiple stack variables in a composite object; for example 


4-4 










APPENDIX FTO MIL-STD-1815A 


type My_Enuin is (A, B); 
for My_enuin'size use 1; 

V,W: My_enum; — will occupy two storage 

— units on the stack 

— (if allocated at all) 
type rec is record 

V,W: My_enum; 
end record; 
pragma Pack(rec); 

O: rec; — will occupy one storage unit 

• A formal parameter of the type is sized according to calling conventions rather than size 
specifications of the type. Appropriate size conversions upon parameter passing take place 
automatically and are transparent to the user. 

• Adjacent bits to an object that is a component of a composite object, but whose size is 
non-referable, may be affected by assignments to the object, unless these bits are occupied by other 
components of the composite object; that is, whenever possible, a component of non-referable size 
is made referable. 

In all cases, the compiler generates correct code for all operations on objects of the type, even if they are 
stored with differing representational sizes in diffeent contexts. 

Note: A size specification cannot be used to force a certain size in value operations of the type; for 
example 

type my_int is range 0..65535; 

for my_int'si 2 e use 16; — o.k. » 

A,B: my_int; 

...A + B... — this operation will generally be 
— executed on 32-bit values 

3. A size specification for a type specifies the size for objects of this type and of all its subtypes. For 
components of composite types, whose subtype would allow a shorter representation of the component, 
no attempt is made to take advantage of such shorter representations. In contrast, for types without a 
length clause, such components may be represented in a lesser number of bits than the number of bits 
required to represent all values of the type. Thus, in the example 

type MY_INT is range 0..2**15-1; 
for MY_INT'SIZE use 16; — (1) 
subtype SMALL_My_INT is My_INT range 0..255; 
type R is record 

X; SMALL_MY_INT; 

end record; 

the component R.x will occupy 16 bits. In the absence of the length clause at (1), R.x may be 
represented in 8 bits. 

Size specifications for access types must coincide with the default size chosen by the complier for the type. 
Size specifications are not support?;* for floating-point types or task types. 

No useful effect can be achieved by using size specifications for these types. 

4.422. Siu Specification for Scalar Typts 

The specified size must accommodate all possible values of the type including the value 0 (even if 0 is not in 
the range of the values of the type). For numeric types with negative values the number of bits must account for 
the sign bit. No skewing of the representation is attempted. Thus 
type my_int is range 100..101; 
requires at least 7 bits, although it has only two values, while 


4-5 





USER MANUAL FOR TARTAN ADA VMS OO 


type iny_int is range -101..-100; 
requires 8 bits to account for the sign bit. 

A size specification for a real type does not affect the accuracy of operations on the type. Such influence 
should be exerted via the accuracy_def inition of the type (LRM 3.5.7,3.5.9). 

A size specification for a scalar type may not specify a size largn^ than the largest operation size supported by 
the target architecture for the respective cla^ of values of the type. 

4.42.3. Size Specification for Array Types 

A size specification for an array type must be large enough to accommodate all components of the array under 
the densest packing strategy. Any alignment constraints on the component type (see Section 4.4.7) must be met 

The size of the component type cannot be influenced by a length clause for an array. Within the limits of 
representing all possible values of the component subtype (but not necessarily of its type), the rqiresentation of 
components may, however, be reduced to the minimum number of bits, unless the component type carries a size 
specification. 

If there is a size specification for the component type, but not for the array type, the component size is 
rounded up to a referable size, unless pragma PACK is given. This applies even to boolean types or other types 
that require only a single bit for the representation of all values. 

4.42.4. Size Specification for Record Types 

A size specification for a record type does not influence the default type mapping of a record type. The size 
must be at least as large as the number of bits detomined by type mapping. Ii^uence over packing of com¬ 
ponents can be exerted by means of (partial) recwd representation clauses or by Pragma PACK. 

Neither the size of component types, na the representation of component subtypes can be influenced by a 
length clause for a record. 

The only implementation-dependent components allocated by Tartan Ada in records contain dope information 
for arrays whose bounds depend on discriminants of the record or contain relative offsets of components within a 
record layout for record components of dynamic size. These implementation-dependent components cannot be 
named or sized by the user. 

A size specification cannot be applied to a record type with components of dynamically detennined size. 

Note; Size specifications for records can be used only to widen the representation accomplished by padding at 
the beginning or end of the record. Any narrowing of the representation over default type mapping must be 
accomplished by representation clauses or pragma PACK. 

4.42.5. Specification of Collection Sizes 

The specification of a collection size causes the collection to be allocated with the specified size. It is 
expressed in storage units and need not be static; refer to package SYSTEM for the meaning of storage units. 

Any attempt to allocate more objects than the collection can hold causes a STORAGE_error exception to be 
raised. Dynamically sized records or arrays may carry hidden administrative storage requiremoits that must be 
accounted for as part of the collection size. Moreover, alignment constraints on the type of the allocated objects 
may make it impossible to use all memory locations of the allocated collection. No matter what the requested 
object size, the allocator must allocate a minimum of 2 words per object This lower limit is necessary for 
administrative overhead in the allocator. For example, a request of 5 words results in an allocation of 5 wo^; a 
request of 1 word results in an allocation of 2 words. 

In the absence of a specification of a collection size, the collection is extended automat'cally if more objects 
are allocated than possible in the collection originally allocated with the compiler-established default size. In this 
case, STORAGE_ERROR is raised only when the available target memory is exhausted. If a collection size of 
zero is specified, no access collection is allocated. 


4-6 







APPENDIX F TO MIL-STD-1815A 


4.4J.6. Specifkation of Task Aetivation Size 

The specification of a task activation size causes the task activation to be allocated with the specified size. It 
is expressed in storage units; refer to package SYSTEM for the meaning of storage units. 

Any attempt to exceed the activation size during execution causes a ST0RAGE_ERR0R exception to be 
raised. Unlike collections, there is no extension of task activations. 

4.42.7. Specification of ' SMALL 

Only powers of 2 are allowed for ' SMALL. 

The length of the representation may be affected by this specification. If a size specification is also given for 
the type, the size specification takes precedence; the specification of ' SMALL must then be accommodatable 
within the specified size. 

4.4.3. Enumeration Representation Clauses 

For enumeration representation clauses [LRM 13.3], the following restrictions triply: 

• The internal codes specified for the literals of the enumeration type may be any integer value between 
INTEGER' FIRST and INTEGER' LAST. It is Strongly advised to not provide a representation clause that 
merely duplicates the default mt^ping of enumeration types, which assigns consecutive numbers in as¬ 
cending order starting with 0, since unnecessary runtime cost is incurred by such duplication. It should be 
noted that the use of attributes on enumeration types with user-specified encodings is costly at run time. 

• Array types, whose index type is an enumeration type with non-condguous value encodings, consist of a 
contiguous sequence of components. Indexing into the array involves a runtime translation of the index 
value into the corresponding position value of the enumeration type. 

4.4.4. Record Representation Clauses 

The alignment clause of record representation clauses [LRM 13.4] is observed. 

Static objects may be aligned at powers of 2. The specified alignment becomes the minimum alignment of 
the record type, unless the minimum alignment of the record forced by the component allocation and the 
minimum alignment requirements of the components is already more stringent than the specified alignment 

The component clauses of record representation clauses are allowed only for components and discriminants 
of statically determinable size. Not all components need to be present Component clauses for components of 
variant parts ate allowed only if the size of the record type is stati^ly determinable fcx- every variant 

The size specified for each component must be sufficient to allocate all possible values of the component 
subtype (but not necessarily the component type). The location specified must be compatible with any alignment 
constraints of the component type; an alignment constraint on a component type may cause an implicit aligrunent 
constraint on the record type itself. 

If some, but not all, discriminants and components of a record type are described by a component clause, then 
the discriminants and components without component clauses are allocated after those with component clauses; 
no attempt is made to utilize gaps left by the user-provided allocation. 

4.4.5. Address clauses 

Address clauses [LRM 13.5] are supported with the following restrictions: 

• When applied to an object, an address clause becomes a linker directive to allocate the object at the given 
address. For any object not declared immediately within a top-level library package, the address clause is 
meaningless. Address clauses applied to local packages are not supported by Tartan Ada. Address clauses 
applied to library packages are prohibited by the syntax; therefore, an add^ clause can be applied to a 
package only if it is a body stub. 


4-7 








USER MANUAL FOR TARTAN ADA VMS OO 


• Address clauses applied to subprograms and tasks are implemented according to the LRM rules. When 
applied to an entry, the specified value identifies an interrupt in a manner customary for the target 
Immediately after a task is created, a runtime call is made for each of its entries having an address clause, 
establishing the proper binding between the entry and the intemipL 

• A specified address must be an Ada static expression. 

4.4.6. Pragma PACK 

Pragma PACK [LRM 13.1] is supported. For details, refer to the following sections. 

4.4.6.I. Pragma PACK for Arrays 

If pragma PACK is applied to an array, the densest possible representation is chosen. For details of packing, 
refer to the explanation of size specifications for arrays (Section 4.4.2.3). 

If, in addition, a length clause is applied to 

1. The array type, the pragma has no effect, since such a length clause already uniquely determines the array 
packing method. 

2. The component type, the array is packed densely, observing the component’s length clause. Note that the 
component length clause may have the effect of preventing the compiler from packing as densely as 
would be the default if pragma PACK is applied where there was no length clause given for the com¬ 
ponent type. 

4.4.6J. The Predefined Type String 

Package standard ^lies Pragma PACK to the type string. However, because type character is deter¬ 
mined to be 32 bits on the C30, this results in one character per word. 

4.4.63. Pragma PACK for Records 

If pragma PACK is applied to a record, the densest possible representation is chosen that is compatible with 
the sizes and alignment constraints of the individual component types. Pragma PACK has an effect only if the 
sizes of some component types are specified explicitly by size specifications and are of non-referable nature. In 
the absence of pragma PACK, such components generally consume a referable amount of space. 

It should be noted that the default type mapping for records maps components of boolean or other types that 
require only a single bit to a single bit in the record layout, if there are multiple such components in a reccmL 
Otherwise, it allocates a referable amount of storage to the component 

If pragma pack is applied to a record for which a record representation clause has been given detailing the 
allocation of some but not all components, the pragma PACK affects only the components whose allocation has 
not been detailed. Moreover, the strategy of not utilizing gaps between explicitly allocated components still 
applies. 

4.4.7. Minimal Alignment for Types 

Certain alignment properties of values of certain types arc enforced by the type mapping rules. Any represen¬ 
tation specification that cannot be satisfied within these constraints is not obeyed by the compiler and is ap¬ 
propriately diagnosed. 

Alignment constrauits are caused by properties of the target architecture, most notably by the capability to 
extract non-aligned component values from composite values in a reasonably efficient manno'. Typically, restric¬ 
tions exist that make extraction of values that cross certain address boundaries very expensive, especially in 
contexts involving array indexing. Permitting data layouts that require such complicated extractions may impact 
code quality on a broader scale than merely in the local context of such extractions. 


4-8 





APPENDIX F TO MIL-STD-1815 A 


Instead of describing the precise algorithm of establishing the minimal alignment of types, we provide the 
general rule that is being enforced by the alignmmt rules: 

• No object of scalar type including components or subcomponents of a composite type, may span a target- 
dq)endent address boundary that would mandate an extraction of the object’s value to be poformed by two 
or more extractions. 

4 ^. IMPLEMENTATION-GENERATED COMPONENTS IN RECORDS 

The only implementation-dependent components allocated by Tartan Ada in records contain dope information 
for arrays whose bounds depend on discriminants of the record. These components carmot be named by the user. 

4 . 6 . INTERPRETATION OF EXPRESSIONS APPEARING IN ADDRESS CLAUSES 

Section 13.S.1 of the Ada Language Reference Manual describes a syntax for associating interrupts with task 
entries. Tartan Ada implements the address clause 
for TOENTRY use at intlD; 

by associating the interrupt specified by intID with the toentry entry of the task containing this address 
clause. The interpretation of intiD is toth machine and compiler dependent. 

4 . 7 . RESTRICTIONS ON UNCHECKED CONVERSIONS 

Tartan supports UNCHECKED_C0NVERSI0N with a restriction that requires the sizes of both source and 
target types to be known at compile time. The sizes need not be the same. If the value in the source is wider than 
that in the target, the source value will be truncated. If narrower, it will be zero-extended. Calls on' instantiations 
of UNCHECK£0_C0NVERSI0N atc made inline automatically. 

4 . 8 . IMPLEMENTATION-DEPENDENT ASPECTS OF INPUT-OUTPUT PACKAGES 

Tartan Ada supplies the predefined input/output packages DlRECT_ZO, seqUENTIAL_io, TEXT_I0, and 
LOW_LEVEL_lO as required by LRM Chafer 14. However, since the 320C30 chip is used in embedded 
applications lacking b^ standard I/O devices and file systems, the function^ity of direct_io, 
sequential_io, and text_io is limited. 

direct_io and sequential_io raise use_error if a file open or file access is attempted. TEXT_iO 
is suppcmed to CURR£NT_output and frmn curr£NT_input. A routine that takes explicit file names raises 
USE_ERROR. ” 

4 . 9 . OTHER IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS 

The following information is supplied in addition to that required by Appendix F to MIL-STD-18ISA. 

4.9.1. Definition of a Main Program 

Any Ada library subprogram unit may be designated the main program for purposes of linking (using the 
ALBC30 LINK command) provided that the subprogram has no parameters. 

Tasks initiated in imported library units follow the same rules for termination as other tasks [described in 
LRM 9.4 (6-10)]. Specifically, these tasks are not terminated simply because the main program has terminated. 
Terminate alternatives in selective wait statements in library tasks are therefore strongly recommended. 


4-9 




USER MANUAL FOR TARTAN ADA VMS OO 


4.92. Implementation of Generic Units 

All instantiations of generic units, except the predefined generic unchecked_conversion and 
UNCHECKED_DEALLOCATiON subprograms, are implemented by code duplications. No attempt at sharing 
code by multiple instantiations is made in this release of Tartan Ada. 

Tartan Ada enforces the restriction that the body of a generic unit must be compiled before the unit can be 
instantiated. It does not impose the restriction that the specification and body of a generic unit must be provided

4.10. SUPPORT FOR PACKAGE MACHINE_CODE 

Package machine_CODE provides the programmer with an interface through which to request the genera¬ 
tion of any instruction that is available on the C30. The implementation of package machine_CODE is similar 
to that described in Section 13.8 of the Ada LRM, with several added features. Please refer to appendix A for the 
Package MACHINE_C0DE specification. 

4.10.1. Basic Information 

As required by LRM, Section 13.8, a routine which contains machine code inserts may not have any other 
kind of statement, and may not contain an exception handier. The only allowed declarative item is a use clause. 
Comments and pragmas are allowed as usual. 

4.10.2. Instructions 

A machine code insert has the form type_mark' record_aggregate, where the type must be one of the 
records defmed in package machine_COOE. Package machine_code defuies seven types of rectvds. Each 
has an opcode and zero to 6 operands. These records are adequate for the expression of all instructions provided 
by the C30. 

4.10.3. Operands and Address Modes 

An operand consists of a record aggregate which holds all the infoTfiation to specify it to the compiler. All 
operands have an address mode and one or more other pieces of information. The operaiids correspond exactly to 
the operands of the instruction being generated. 

Each operand in a machine code insert must have an Address_Mode_Name. The address modes provided in 
package machine_COOE provide access to all address modes supported by the C30. 


4.12 











































APPENDIX F TO MIL-STD-1815A 


In addition, package machike_code supplies the address inodes Syiiibolic_Address and 
Synibolic_Value which allow the user to refer to Ada objects by specifying Object' ADDRESS as the value 
for the operand. Any Ada object which has the ' address attribute may be used in a symbolic operand. 
Syiiibolic_Address should be used when the operand is a true address (that is. a branch target for example). 
Syinbolic_value should be used when the opei^ is actuaUy a value (that is. one of the source operands of 
an ADDI instruction). 

When an Ada object is used as a source operand in an instruction (that is. one from which a value is read), the 
compiler will generate code which fetches the value of the Ada object When an Ada object is used as the 
destination operand of an instruction, the compiler will generate code which uses the address of the Ada object as 
the destination of the insmiction. 

4.10.4. Examples 

The implementation of package mackine_code makes it possible to specify both simple machine code 
insots such as 

Two_Opnds' (LDI, (Imm, 5), (Reg, RO)) 
and more complex inserts such as 

Three_Opnds'(ADDIS, 

(Itnm, 10), 

(Syinbolic_Value, Array_Var(X, Y, 27)'ADDRESS), 

(Syinbolic_Address, Paraineter_l'ADDRESS)) 

In the first example, the compiler will emit the instruction LDI 5, RO. In the second example, the compiler 
will first emit an instruction to load the immediate value 10 into a register, next emit whatever instructions are 
needed to form the address of Array_Var(X, Y, 27) and then emit the ADDIS instruction. If 
ParaRieter_l is not found in a register, the compiler will put the result of the addition in a temporary register 
and then store it to Paranteter_l' ADDRESS. Note that the destination operand of the ADDIS instruction is 
given as a Symbolic_Address. This holds true for all destination tqierands. The various extot checks 
specified in the LRM will be performed on all compiler-generated code unless they are suppressed by the 
programmer (either through pragma SUPPRESS, or through command qualifiers). 

4.10.5. Incorrect Operands 

Under some circumstances, the compiler attempts to correa incorrect operands. Three modes of operation 
are supplied for package machine_CODE: /fixup-none, /fixup-warn, and /fixup-quiet. These 
modes of operation determine whether corrections are attempted and how much infixmation about the necessary 
corrections is provided to the user. /fixup-QUIET is the default 

In /FIXUP-NONE mode, the specification of incorrect operands for an instruction is considered to be a fatal 
error. In this mode, the compiler will not generate any extra instructions to help you to make a machine code 
insertion. Note that it is still legal to use ' ADDRESS constructs as long as the object which is used meets the 
requirements of the instruction. 

In /FIXUP-QUIET mode, if you specify incorrect operands for an instruction, the compiler will do its best 
to correct the machine code to provide the desired effect For example, although it is ille^ to use a memory 
address as the destination of an ADDi instruction, the compiler will accept it and try to generate correct code. In 
this case, the compiler will load the value found at the memory address indicated into a register, use this register 
in the ADDI instruction, and then store from that register back to the desired memtay location. 

Two_Opnds'(ADDI, (Imm, 10), (ARI, ARl)) 

will produce a code sequence li)ce 

LDI *AR1, RO 

ADDI 10, RO 

STI RO, *AR1 


4-13 





USER MANUAL FOR TARTAN ADA VMS OO 


The next example illustrates the collection required when the displacement is out of range fw the Hrst 
operand of an ADDI3 instruction. The displacement is first loaded into one of the index registers. 

Three_Opnds' (ADDI3, (IPDA, AR3, 2), (Reg, RO), (Reg, Rl)) 

will produce a code sequence like 

LDI 2, IRO 

AODI3 AR3(1R0), RO, Rl 

In /FIXUP-HARN mode, the compiler will also do its best to ctHiect any inconect operands for an instruc¬ 
tion. However, a warning message is issued stating that the machine code insert required additional machine 
instructions to make its operands legal. 

4.10.6. Assumptions Made in Correcting Operands 

When compiling in /FIXUP-QUIET or /fixup-warn modes, the compiler attempts to emit additional 
code to move “the right bits’* from an inconect qierand to a place which is a legal operand for the requested 
insuuction. The compiler makes certain basic assumptions when perfmming these corrections. This section 
explains the assumptions the compiler makes and their implications fmr the generated code. Note that if you want 
a correction which is different from that performed by the compiler, you must make explicit machine code 
insertions to perform it 

For source operands: 

• Syinbolic_Address means that the address specified by the 'ADDRESS expression is used as the 
source bits. When the Ada object specified by the ' address instruction is bound to a register, this will 
cause a compile-time error message because it is not possible to “take the address” of a register. 

• Syinbolic_Value means that the value found at the address specified by the ' ADDRESS expression will 
be used as the source bits. An Ada object which is bound to a register is correct here, because the contents 
of a register can be expressed on the C30. 

• PcRel indicates that the address of the label will be used as the source bits. 

• Any other non-register means that the value found at the address specified by the operand will be used as 
the source bits. 

For destination operands: 

• Syinbolic_Address means that the desired destination for the operation is the address specified by the 
' ADDRESS expression. An Ada object which is bound to a register is correct here; a register is a legal 
destination on the C30. 

• Syinbolic_value means that the desired destination for the operations is found by fetching 32 bits from 
the address specified by the ' ADDRESS expression, and storing the result to the address represented by the 
fetched bits. This is equivalent to applying one extra indirection to the addre^ used in the 
Syinbolic_Address case. 

• All other operands are interpreted as directly specifying tlw destination (or the operation. 

4.10.7. Register Usage 

Since the compiler may need to allocate registers as temporary straage in machine code routines, there are 
some restrictions placed on your register usage. The compiler will automatically free all the registers which 
would be volatile across a call for your use (that is, R0..R3, AR0..AR2, IRO, IRl, RS, RC RE. BK, and DP). If 
you reference any other register, the compiler will reserve it for your use until the end of the machine code 
routine. The compiler will not save the register automatically if this routine is inline expanded. This means that 
the first reference to a register which is not volatile across calls should be an instruction which saves its value in a 
safe place. The value of the register should be restored at the end of the machine code routine. This rule will 
help ensure correct operation of your machine code insert even if it is inline explaned in another routine. 


4-14 






APPENDIX F TO MIL-STD-1815A 


However, the compiler will save the register automatically in the prolog code for the routine and restore it in the 
q>ilog code for the routine if the routine is not inline expanded. 

As a result of freeing all volatile registers for the user, any parameters which wme passed in registers will be 
moved to eitha a non volatile register or to memory. References to parameter' address in a machine code 
insert will then produce code that uses this register memory location. This means that there is a possiblity of 
invalidating the value of some ' ADDRESS expression if the non volatile register which it is bound to is used as a 
destination in some later machine code insert In this case, any subsequent references to the 'ADDRESS 
expression will cause the compiler to issue a warning message. 

The compiler may need several registers to generate code for operand fixups in machine code inserts. If you 
use all the registers, corrections will not be possible. In generk, when more registers are available to the 
compiler it is able to generate better code. 

4.10.8. Data Directives 

Two special instructions are included in package Machine_Code to allow the user to place into the 
code stream. These two instructions are DATA32 and DATA64. Each of these instructions can have 1 to 6 
operands. 

DATA32 is used to place 32-bit data into the code stream. The value of an integer or 32-bit float, and the 
address of a label are the legal operands (i.e. operands whose address mode is either Iran, Floatlmm, or 
Syinbolic_Address of an Ada Label). 

« LI » 

Three_Opnds'(DATA32, {Syinbolic_Address, L2'Address), 

(Symbolic_Address, L3'Address), 
(Syrobolic_Address, L4'Address)); 

« L2 » 

« L3 » 

« L4 » 

will produce a code sequence like 

LI: .word L2 

.word L3 
.word L4 

DATA64 is used to place a 64-bit data into the code stream. The only legal operand is a floating literal (i.e 
operand whose address mode is Floatiran). 

4.10.9. Inline Expansion 

Routines which contain machine code inserts may be inline expanded into the bodies of other routines. This 
may happen under programmer control through the use of pragma INLINE, or at optimization levels 2 and 3 
when die compiler selects that optimization as an appropriate action for the given situation. The compiler will 
treat the machine code insert as a call; volatile registers will be saved and restored around it, etc. 

4.10.10. Unsafe Assumptions 

There are a variety of assumptions which should not be made when writing machine code inserts. Violation 
of these assumptions may result in the generation of code which does not assemble or which may not function 
correcdy. 

• The compiler will not generate call site code for you if you emit a call instruction. You must save and 
resttxe any volatile registers which currenUy have values in them, etc. If the routine you call has out 
parameters, a large function return result, or an unconstrained result, it is your responsibility to emit the 
necessary instructions to deal with these constructs as the compiler expects. In other words, when you emit 
a call, you must follow the linkage convottions of the routine you are calling. For further details on call 
site code, see Sections 6.4,6.S and 6.6. 


4.15 




USER MANUAL FOR TARTAN ADA VMS C30 


• Do not assume that the ' ADDRESS on Syinbolic_Address or Syinbolic_Value operands means 
that you are getting an address to operate on. The Address- or Value-ness of an operand is detnmined 
by your choice of Syinbolic_Address or Synibolic_Value. This means that to add the contents of 
X to ARO, you should write 

Two_Opnds'(ADDI, (Syinbolic_Value, X'ADDRESS), 

(Reg, ARO)) 

but to add the address of x to ARO. you should write 

Two_Opnds'(ADDI, (Symbolic_Addre8s, X'ADDRESS), 

(Reg, ARO)); 


4.10.11. Limitations 

The current implementation of the compiler is unable to fully support automatic correction of certain kinds of 
operands. In particular, the compiler assumes that the size of a data object is the same as the number of bits 
which is operated on by the instruction chosen in the machine code insert. This means that the insert: 

Two_Opnds'(ADDF, (Syinbolic_Value, Long_Float_Variable'ADDRESS), 

(Reg, RO)) 

will not generate correct code when Long_Float_Variable is bound to memory. The compiler wiU assume 
that Long_Float_variable is 32 bits, when in fact it is stored in 64 bits of memory. If, on the other hand, 
Long_Float_Variable was bound to an extended-precision register, the insertion function properly, as 
no correction is needed. 

Note that the use of X' ADDRESS in a machine code insm does not guarantee that X will be bound to 
memory. This is a result of the use of ' ADDRESS to pnovide a “typeless" method for naming Ada objects in 
machine code inserts. For example, it is legal to say {Symbolc_value, X'ADDRESS) in an insert even 
when X is found in a register.

4.11. DELAYED BRANCHES 

A feature of the C30 architecture is the inclusion of delayed branching. Because of the processor pipelining, 
normal branch instructions require four cycles to execute. During that time the pipeline is emptied and no other 
useful instructions may be executed. However, a second set of branch instructions is provid^ that allow three 
more instructions to be executed after initiation of the branch and before acuial transfer of control. It is very 
important to use delayed branches whenever possible in order to achieve maximum processor throughput 

4.11.1. Generating Delayed Branches 

A special machine-dependent optimization phase attempts to generate delayed l»anches by seeking to identify 
insuuctions that can be scheduled within the three-instruction branch delay. An instruction may be scheduled 
during the.braach delay if it is; 

1. An instruction that currently precedes the branch in the basic block and inoduces no result or side effect 
that could be used by any instruction preceding its potential location within the branch delay. 

2. An instruction that currently follows a conditional branch, providing it has no side effects if the branch is 
taken and produces no result or side effect that could be mis-used by any instruction between its potential 
branch delay location and its current location. 


4-18 





AK»ENDIX F to MIL-STD-1815A 


3. A replication of an instruction that is currently at the address of the branch destination. If the branch is 
conditional, this instruction must have no side effects if the Inanch is not taken. The branch target address 
must be changed to point to the next address if such an instruction is discovered. 

Instructions which are themselves branches may not be scheduled within the branch delay. 

As an example, in the following code fragment, as presented to the delay branch optimization, can the beq be 
usefully transformed into the delayed version, beqd?

Searching for instructions in the first class above, the delayed branch optimizer discovers that instruction 10 
can be moved down to the branch delay because its results are not used by instructions 11 or 12. Instruction 12 is 
not moveable since its result is used by the conditional branch. Likewise, instruction ll’s result is used by 
instruction 12 and so it caiuiot be moved. 

Applying the rules for the second type of ddayed branch candidate, the delayed branch optimizer discovers 
that instruction 14 (a two operation pai^el instruction) cannot be moved up into the branch delay since it loads 
R4 and the contents of R4 are read by instruction 22 if the branch is taken. Instruction IS can be moved up into 
the branch delay because it produces no result that can aHect instruction 14 and its results are void^ by 
instruction 22 if the Inanch is t^en. 

While searching for the members of the third class, it is detected that instruction 21 can be replicated in the 
branch delay and the branch retargeted, because its result is voided by instruction 14 if the branch is not taken. 
Instruction 22 cannot be moved since it will leaveRS in the incorrect state for instruction IS. 

After the transformations are made, the code is:

and here we see a true advantage to the automated ^proach offered by the Ada compiler.

USER MANUAL FOR TARTAN ADA VMS C30 


Many modon processor architectures contain delayed branch instructions. However, because the C30 allows 
for three instructions during the branch delay instead of the usual one, this feature is no longer transparent to the 
casual user of any C30 compiler. For example, the compiler may discover that only a single usefiil instruction 
can be executed during the branch delay and must “fill’* the other two slots with no-op’s. While this strategy 
may speed up the algorithm by one cycle, it also increases code size by two words. The tradeoff with two usefid 
instructions and one no-op is a possible speed-up of two cycles for a code increase of one word. The Ada 
compiler allows the user to specify a global speed vs. space tradeoff strategy. This assertion combined with loop 
depth and other static program measurements will cause the compiler to bias against marginal delayed branch 
opportunities that expand the code. The compiler’s stategy is discussed in detail below. 

4.1 U. Delayed Branch Strategy 

Certain conditions determine whether the delayed branch optimizer will actually transform a standard branch 
into its delayed branch equivalent These conditions include whether or not the code is in fast memory, the 
optimization level used to compile the source code, how many useful instructions have been found to fill the 
delay slots, and wh«e these instructions came from (i.e., above the branch, below the branch, or from the label). 
The compiler will transform a branch instruction only if the resulting code is guaranteed to be at least as fast as 
the original code. 

The delayed branch optimizer makes decisions based on instruction fetch time. A program compiled with the 
switch /WAiTSTATES-0 tells the compiler that the code will be in fast memory. The compiler can also detect 
that an insrucdon will reside in the cache by checking if it is in a loop that completely Hts in the cache. If the 
three delay slots that follow a delayed branch will not reside in fast memory or the cache, then three useful 
instructions must be found to fill the delay slots. No no^ instruction will be inserted to fill a delay slot because 
the resulting code could end up being slower than the code with the standard branch. 

The compiler will not transform any standard branches into delayed branches at optimization levels 0 or 1. At 
optimization level 4 (Space), a standi branch is transformed into a delayed branch only if three instructions 
have been found to fill the delay slots. Optimization level 2 (Custom Mix) requires at le^ two useful instruc¬ 
tions to fill the delay slots. Optimization level 3 (Speed) requires only one useful instruction. At these two 
levels, no-op instructions will be added to fill the remaining delay slots only if the code is in fast memory or the 
cache. If the code is not in fast memory or the cache, and three instructions have not been found, then the branch 
will not be transformed. 

As stated above, the position of an instruction that can be moved to a delay slot with respect to the Ixanch 
instruction itself has an effect on whether the branch will be transfonned. It is always best to fmd useful 
instructions that would be executed regvdless of the condition on the branch. Instructions that precede the 
branch fall into this category. Likewise, if the branch is an unconditional branch, instructions at the branch target 
address will also always be executed, so they also fall into this categmy. However, instructions that follow a 
conditional branch will only be executed if the l»anch is not taken, and instructions at the teanch target address 
of a conditional branch will only be executed if the branch is taken. Therefore, it is not always beneficial to fill 
the delay slots with these kind of instructions. These instructions will fill a delay slot only when the resulting 
code is at least as fast as the orignal code regardless of whether the branch is taken or not The exception to this 
is that instucdons below a conditional branch will be considered as always being executed when the delay branch 
optimizer can determine that the condition on the branch will not be satisfied a large percentage of the time. 

4.12./MCA>1C£ INTRINSICS 

The Intrinsics package is provided as a means for the fHOgrammer to access certain hardware 
capabilities of the 320C30 in an efficient manner. 

The package declares generic functions which may be instantiated to create functions that have particularly 
efficient implementations. A call to such a function usually does not include a hardware subroutine call at all, but 
is implemented inline as a few 320C30 instructions. (Often a single instruction!)

APPENDIX FTO MIL-STD-1815A 


4.12.1. Native Instructions 

The following group of generic functions allows specific 320C30 instructions to be tqiplied to Ada entities. 
The user must instantiate the generic fiincticm for the types that will be used as the opeiand(s) and result of the 
operation. These generic functions have been given the same name as the assembler’s name for the correspond¬ 
ing instruction. In some cases this convention leads to a conflict with an Ada reserved word. This conflict is 
resolved by using the instruction name with an “i” appended to it 

F'^r details of the operation applied by calling an instance of one of these generic functions see the 
TMS320C30 User's Guide. Examples of their use are given in figures 4-1 and 4-2. Refer to appendix B for the 
signatures of all intrinsics. The available operations are shown in the following table.

4.12 Circular Addressing 

The 320C30 circular addressing inodes are made available through a set of generic functions that model the 
entire process with aii iterator object and a set of subprograms to 

• initialize the iterator, ' 

• read an object specified by the current value of the iterator, 

• advance the iterator to a new objecL and 

• release the iterator for later use. 

These generics are documented using the same names and terms as in sectitHi 6.3 of the TMS320C30 User’s 
Guide. 

A fixed number of iterators are available for use in circular addressing. Iterators are named by the enumera¬ 
tion literals of the type Circ_Iterator_Name_Type. More than one iterator may be active at any given 
time. 

There are certain very important rules to keep in mind when using circular iterators. 

1. Initialization of an iterator must occur prior to usage both in execution order and textual order in the 
source code. 

2. Similarly, release of an iterator must occur after last usage both in execution order and textual order in the 
source code. 

3. The iterator is known only within the procedure in which it is defmed. 

4. Finally, because these functions are considered to be free of side effects, optimization may unfortunately 
remove a call to one if the result of the call does not seem necessary for the execution of the program. In 
particular, for each of the functions that returns a Boolean value, the call should be used as the 
condition in an if statement whose then part is an assignment to a non-local variable. The call will not 
be removed and the useless assigiunent will be correctly optimized away. See figure 4-3 for an example 
of how this is done. 

The 320C30 hardware places certain requirements on the addresses used in circular addressing cqierations. 
The values passed to an instantiation of lnit_Circ_iter, the iterator initialization function, must (A)ey these 
rules. This normally means that it is necessary to use an address clause to position the entity whose address is 
passed as the first parameter of lnit_Circ_lter.

4-24 



APPENDIX F TO MIL-STD-1815A 


• If all BK's of all active iterators are not proveably the same at compile-time, generated code will degrade 
considerably. 

• Always release iterattxs when they are no longer needed. 

4.12.3. Bit-Reversed Addressing 

The 320C30 bit-reversed addressing modes are made available through a set of generic functions that model 
the entire process with an iterator object and a set of subprograms to 

• initialize the it^tor, 

• read an object specified by the current value of the iterator. 

• advance die itoator to a new object, and 

• release the iterator for later use. 

These generics are documented using the same names and terms as in section 6.4 of the TMS320C30 User’s 
Guide. 

A fixed number of iterators are available for use in bit-reversed addressing. Iterators are named by the 
enumeration literals of the type Brev_iterator_Naine_Type. More than one iterator may be active at any 
given time. 

The same rules regarding the use of circular addressing iterators apply to bit-reversed addressing iterators. 

The functions that operate on bit-ieversed iterators are: 

lnit_Brev_lter Allocate and initialize an iterator. From left to right, the parameters are: 

Base_Acidr_Plus_Start_Index 

Usually Array (Start^Index, 0)' address, as¬ 
suming that the second dimension of the array holds the 
data points to be addressed between each change in the

Array is placed in memory using an Ada address 
clause.

Brev_lter_BA_Plus_Index Extracts and returns the “Base_Addres.'' + Index” part of the 

iterator. 

Brev_iter_Two_To_N Extracts and returns the ‘‘Two_To_N” pan of the iterator. 

The example given for circular iterators (figure 4-3) is a good guide for the use of bit-reversed iterators as 
well.

APPENDIX F TO MIL-STD-181SA 


Figure 4-4 shows an example of the use of power_ 32 instantiated as the “**” operaUM- for floats. A call to 
an instance of any of these results in a call to an extremely fast-executing function to perform the computation. 
These are “shared-code” generics in the sense that there will be only one object-code version of each function 
created no matter how many instantiations are made. 

The code generator contains built-in knowledge that these function calls are firee Cnmi side effects and thus do 
not cause optimizations to be blocked. The code generator also knows exactly which of the volatile registers are 
used by each routine and will not save active values from registers that are not used by the routine being called. 

Algorithms for the routines were adapted from Software Manual for the Elementary Functions', Cody and 
Waite, Prentice Hall 1980; and Handbook of Mcalxmabcal Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical 
Tables', Milton Abramowitz and Irene A. Stegun, National Bureau of Standards (Applied Mathematics Series SS), 
Washington D.C., 1964 (reprinted 1970); and the TMS320C30 User’s Guide. Some algorithms woe developed 
internally. 

All routines are accurate to single (32-bit) floating precision. An augmented set of Cody-Waite accuracy tests 
has been used to test them. Loss of precision was found to be limited to about 2 bits of the 24-bit mantissa for 
almost all of the functions. Test results are available from Tartan on request 

Every attempt has been made to avoid raising an exception for any input value. Reasonable values are 
returned under all conditions. It is assumed that most signal processing applications work in a “press on” mode. 

In the table that follows, cycles were counted by hand and are based on 0-wait state memory for both program 
and data spaces. The min count is for ncxi-trivial case(s). The range over which each count holds is usuaUy 
document^. The “typical” count assumes uniform distribution of input values across stated range. When range 
is not declared, the typical count holds for range of all 32-bit floating numbers.
