ABSTRACT 

The available studies on the synthesis of high-T^^ 
superconductors (HTS) via the glass precursor approach have been 
reviewed. Melts of the Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 system as well as 
those doped with oxides of some other elements (Pb, Al, V, Te, 
Nb, etc.) could be quenched into glasses which, on further heat 
treatments under appropriate conditions, crystallized into the 
superconducting phase(s). The nature of the HTS phase(s) formed 
depends on the annealing temperature, time, atmosphere and the 
cooling rate and also on the glass composition. Long term 
annealing was needed to obtain a large fraction of the 110 K 
phase. The high-T^ phase did not crystallize out directly from 
the glass matrix, but was preceded by the precipitation of other 
phases. The 110 K HTS was produced at high temperatures by 
reaction between the phases formed at lower temperatures 
resulting in multiphase material. The presence of a glass former 
such as B2O3 was necessary for the Y-Ba-Cu-0 melt to form a 
glass on fast cooling. A discontinuous YBa2CU307_^ HTS phase 
crystallized out on heat treatment of this glass. Attempts to 
prepare Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-0 system in the glassy state were not 
successful. 

1- INTRODUCTION 

Interest in oxide ceramic superconductors was created with a 
breakthrough discovery of superconductivity at '"35 K in the 
La2-x^^x^^^4 system [1] which was soon followed by a 
superconducting transition temperature, T^, of *93 K in the 
y-Ba-Cu-0 system [2] . Superconductivity in the rare earth-- free 
Bi"Sr-CU"0 system with a T^. of "20 K was first reported by 
Michel et al [3]. The addition of calcium led to the discovery 
of bulk superconductivity at 85 K by Maeda et al [4]. Evidence 
for a superconducting phase with T^ of "110 K in the 



Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 system was presented soon after by Chu et al [5]. 
T^^ in the Bi2Sr2Caj^_3^Cu^02n4-4 family increases with the number 
of Cu-0 layers when n changes from 1 to 3 • Phase pure 
superconducting materials for n = 1 and 2 have been synthesized 
by solid state reaction and other methods. However, preparation 
of a homogeneous single phase 110 K T^ material corresponding to 
n = 3 has been found to be much more tedious • So far, the 
highest confirmed T^^ of 125 K has been reported [6] for the 
Tl2Ba2Ca;jCU30j^ phase in the Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-0 system. Hereafter, 
phases will be denoted by their cation stoichiometry, e.g., 2212 
for Bi2Sr2CajLCU203. 

The glass precursor technique as a preparative route for HTS 
is one of the most promising methods and offers several 
advantages. Mixing of the components occurs at molecular level 
in the melt. Almost fully dense, uniform, pore free materials 
can be fabricated and highly oriented grains can be achieved by 
crystallization under controlled conditions which could lead to 
high critical current densities (J«) . Heat treatments of the 
rapidly quenched glass can result m metastable crystalline 
phases having unusual properties which cannot be synthesized by 
normal means. True chemical homogeneity is possible as 
crystallization takes place from a homogeneous glass composition 
without the need for any long range diffusion. Microstructure of 
the product can be controlled by controlling the time and 
temperature of heat treatment. This method is also of practical 
significance for the manufacture of ceramic superconductors into 
desired shapes such as fibers, wires, tapes, etc. by borrowing 
the well-established techniques of glass technology. 

There are also certain limitations of the melt quenching 
approach. The components should not be volatile at about one to 
two hundred degrees above the melting temperature. The melt must 
not phase separate and should not chemically react with the 
container. The last problem may, however, be alleviated through 
container less melting [7]. 

The glass precursor method has been mostly applied for the 
synthesis of HTS in the Bi- system. However, some attempts have 
also been made in the Y-Ba-Cu-0 and the Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-0 systems. A 
review of the glass precursor approach for fabrication of HTS is 
presented here. 

2. GLASS SYNTHESIS 

A flowchart of the process used for glass synthesis is 
shown in Fig. 1. The starting materials, usually metal oxides 
and carbonates, are mixed in appropriate amounts and loaded into 
a crucible (Pt, Ir, or AI2O3) . The mixture is calcined at 
"800-850 ^C for carbonate decomposition and solid state 
reaction. The temperature is further raised to "1000-13 50 ^C for 
melting and held for "0.5 h for homogeneization. The melt is 
rapidly cooled by twin roller [8-14] quenching or by pressing 
between two metal plates resulting in black opaque glass. A 
typical x-ray diffraction pattern [15] of glass of 
Bi]^ 5Pbo^5Sr2Ca2CU30y composition formed by quenching the melt 
between two copper plates is shown in Fig. 2. An amorphous halo 
alongwith some low intensity diffraction peaks, which can be 
assigned to CaO, are present indicating part of the CaO did not 
dissolve in the melt.

A containerless [10-13] melting technique has also been used 
to avoid any contamination of the glass melt by corrosion of the 
crucible. In this method the constituent oxides are mixed in 
stoichiometric amounts, pressed into a bar, and sintered. The 
tip of the bar is melted using a flame or a thermal image 
furnace and the melt droplets are rapidly quenched by a metal 
twin-roller rotating at high speed. The details of this method 
are beyond the scope of this chapter but can be found elsewhere 
[10,16]. 

3. Bi-HTS SYSTEM 

The glass precursor technique has been most widely used for 
the fabrication of HTS in the Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 [7-12, 17-48] and the 
Pb-doped [13,15,49-62] systems as described below. 

3.1. GLASS-FORMING REGIONS 
3.1.1. Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 System 

The glass forming region in the BiO^^ 5-(CaO. SrO) q 5-CuO 
system has been investigated [7] using a* containerless glass 
melting technique. A relatively wide glass-forming region, as 
shown by the broken line in Fig. 3, exists in this 
pseudo-ternary system. This is quite interesting because no 
"network former" oxides are present in this system. The glass 
transition temperature, Tg (Fig. 4), was found to depend mainly 
on the Bio-L 5 content of the glass, with a maximum of 390^C at 
around 20 mol% BiO^ 5. The glasses of stoichiometric 
compositions such as BiSrCaCU20y and Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu30y were also 
located in the region of the highest T„. ^

and Bi2Sr2Ca2CU30y, respectively. [7] 

A typical DSC scan [18] of the Bi3_^5SrCaCu20y glass showing 
Tg and the crystallization temperature) T^^, is given in Fig. 5. 
Values of both Tg and T^^ vary in a complex manner with, 
increasing 61203 content in the Bij^SrCaCu20y glass as shown [26] 
in Fig. 6. Both Tg and T^ increase with the CaO content in the 
Bij^ 2S3^P^z^^2^y glasses as shown [26] in Fig. 7. For 
Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 glasses, Zheng et al. [20] reported that values of 
Tg and Tj^ decrease with increase in CuO or Bi203 contents, and 
increase with increasing alkaline earth (CaO and SrO) content. 
The thermal stability factor [14] (T^^ - Tg) is large for glasses 
rich in Bi203 and alkaline earth oxides whereas the CuO-rich 
glasses show smaller values. These results clearly indicate that 
Bi203 plays an important role in glass formation and also for 
thermal stability (T^ - Tg) of glasses in the Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 
system. Results of KomatsQ et al . [26] and Tohge et al . [7] also 
clearly indicate that Bi203 acts as a glass former and a 
decrease in 81203 content degrades the glass-forming ability of 
the Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O system. This is reflected in Fig. 6 at Bi 
levels less than 1.5. 

The effects of glass melting temperature and copper oxide 
content on the Cu(I) /Cu^otal ^^^io in the Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O glasses 
along with their Tg and T^^ values are given [63] in Table I. 
Because of the reduction of copper oxide at high temperatures, 
most copper ions in these glasses quenched from high 
temperatures exist mainly in Cu(I) state. The Cu(I) /Cu^q^^j 
ratio increased with the glass melting temperature, but changed 
only negligibly with copper oxide content. However, the amount 
of Cu(I) in the glass, as indicated in the glass composition

Values of Tg and T^ decreased and the glass became thermally 
unstable, as indicated by a decrease in the value of (T^ - T„) , 
with increase in glass melting temperature and also with total 
copper oxide content. This is due to a decrease in the number of 
glass network units, [8103] pyramids, with increase in 
Cu(I)/Cutotal J^atio and CuO content. 

Values of Tg, T^, and glass thermal stability expressed in 
terms of the parameter (Tjj - Tg) for Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 glasses of 
various compositions melted under different conditions are 
listed in Table II.

decreasing trend in values of T^. and T^ in BiyPbn 4SroCa,CUoO„ 
glasses containing high 81303 cSntent is similar t5 that showK 
by Bi-based glasses [7,26]. The value of T^ and T^ for glasses 
xn the Bi2.9.2Pb2Sr2Ca2Cu30y, Bi3 4_zPb2Sr|Ca2CU30„, and 

•2a9T2P°zSr2Ca2Cu30y systeihs [72] decreased almost linearly 
with increase m Pb 6ontent implying that substitution of Pb for 
Bi does not improve the glass formation. This is expected 
because. BiaOg acts as a glass former and a decrease in BioOo 
content would degrade [73] the glass forming ability. 

3.2. GLASS VISCOSITY 

Glass fibers are generally pulled from a glass preform at a 
temperature around its softening point. A knowledge of the 
temperature dependence of the glass viscosity would be useful 
for successful drawing of continuous glass fibers. 

Viscosities in the glass transition range for glasses of 
Bijj.SrCaCu20y (x = 1.5, 2.7) compositions, prepared [12] by 
metal-plate and twin-roller quenching methods, have been 
measured [12] using the beam-bending technique. Temperature 
dependence of viscosity in the 10^0 to 10^4 pa.g range for the 
two glass compositions (Fig. 10 and 11), followed an Arrhenius 
behavior with an activation energy, Ep,, of 800 to 980 kJ/mol. 
The glass having lower bismuth content showed larger En. Such a 
large value of E^ indicates that the Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 system forms 
a fragile liquid from which glass fibers may be drawn at around 
the glass softening point rather than from the melt because of 
high fluidity. The working range, Tj, - T^, for these glasses is 
also very narrow implying that crystallisation would be a 
serious problem during fiber drawing at around the glass 
softening point. The glass working range needs to be extended in 
order to draw Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 fibers without devitrification. 
Although an increase in Bi content of the glass results in lower 
Ep, which IS favorable for fiber drawing, this is unfortunately 
also accompanied) [26] by a lowering of T^ of the glass ceramic! 
It IS, therefore, necessary to find ways of lowering the 
activation energies of viscous flow and crystal growth without 
increasing t,he bismuth cbntent in the glass. 

The viscosity of a glass of Bi^ gSrCaCUoOv composition, 
prepared by melt quenching between 'metal plates, was determined 
[67] using a penetration method. Temperature dependence of 
viscosity in a very narrow temperature range is shown in Fig. 
12. The shaded region shows the allowable fiber drawing range 
which IS extremely narrow (704 to 707 K) . The En is calculated 
to be 6300 kJ/mol which is very large compared to the value of 
958 kJ/mol obtained using the beam bending method [12] for the 
same glass composition. This large difference in En values may 
be due to the different temperature ranges for viscosity 
measurements in the two studies and a non-Arrhenian temperature 
dependence of the glass viscosity. 

Temperature dependence [64] of viscosity of Bi>iSroCaoCu^0„ 
glass is shown in Fig. 13. A beam-bending method and a ^ 
rotational method were used for viscosity measurements in the 
range of 10° - 10-^^ poise and 0.1 - lOO poise, respectively. 
Temperature dependence of melt viscosity of the BipSr.CaTCUoO,, 
composition (Fig. 14) has been determined [74]. The melt ^ 
viscosity varied from ~45 to 1 Poise in the temperature range 



885 to 985 °C.

3.3. CRYSTALLIZATION KINETICS 

Devitrification of the Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 glasses is a serious 
problem during fiber drawing by heating a glass preform to 
around its softening point. Knowledge of the crystallization 
kinetics of these glasses is, therefore, a prerequisite for 
successful drawing of the glass fibers. Kinetics of 
crystallization of the melt quenched Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 [11,17,68] 
and (Bi,Pb) -Sr-Ca-Cu-0 [50] glasses have been investigated by 
isothermal [68] and non^-isothermal [11,17,50] differential 
scanning calorimetry (DSC) . 

The isothermal crystallization of a glass can be expressed 
by the Avrami equation [75]: 



X 



= 1 



exp["(kt)^] 



(1) 



where x is the volume fraction crystallized after time t, n the 
Avrami parameter which depends on the crystal growth morphology, 
and k the crystallization rate constant whose temperature 
dependence (at least within narrow temperature ranges) can be 
given by the Arrhenius equation: 



k =6 exp["E^/RT] 



(2) 



where 6 is the frequency factor, E^ the activation energy, R the 
gas constant and T the isothermal absolute temperature. Taking 
the logarithm of eq. (1) and rearranging gives

Multiple crystallization peaks observed in DSC, 



Isothermal DSC curves for crystallization of the glass are 
recorded at various temperatures. Values of n and k at a given 
temperature can be evaluated from an isothermal DSC scan via eq. 
(3) from the slope and intercept of a plot of ln[-ln(l-x) ] vs. 
In t. Values of E^ and B can then be determined via eq. (2) from 
a plot of In k vs. l/T. 

In the nonisothermal method, DSC scans are recorded at 
various heating rates for the crystallization of a glass. Values 
of the kinetic parameters are calculated using the kinetic model 
of Bansal et al [76,77] which is expressed as: 

ln[Tp2/a] = ln(Ea/R) - In B + E^/ (RTp) (4) 

where Tp is the peak maximum temperature in the DSC, and a the 
heating rate. The position of the DSC crystallization peak 
shifts to higher temperature with increase in heating rate. 
Values of the crystallization kinetics parameters E- and J3 are 
determined via eq. (4) from a plot of ln[Tp2/a] vs. l/T^. 

The values of E^ for crystallization bf glasses of ^various 
compositions are listed in Table IV and range from 292 to 489 
kJ/mol. Values of E^ obtained by isothermal arid nonisothermal 
DSC are in reasonably good agreement. Somewhat smaller values of 
Ea for the glasses made by metal-plate quenching than for the 
twin-roller quenched glasses may be due to a small difference in 
their compositions caused by the corrosion of an alumina 
crucible used in melting of the metal-plate quenched glasses. 
This could also result from the different Cu(I) contents of the 
two glasses as the amount of Cu(I) depends [13] on the cooling 
rate. The value of the Avrami exponent for crystallization of 
the Bi4Sr3Ca3Cu40y glass was found [68] to be close to 3 
suggesting a threfe dimensional crystal growth at a constant 
number of nucleation sites. Similar values of E^ for bulk and 
powder samples probably also suggest volume crystal growth in 
these glasses. 

3'4« CRYSTAL PHASE (s) FORMATION ON HEAT TREATMENT OF GLASS 
The development of crystalline phases on heat treatment of 
glasses of different compositions under various conditions of 
temperature, time, and atmosphere has been investigated by 
various researchers. Description of the results of all of these 
studies is beyond the scope of this chapter. Only typical 
results from a few selected studies are included here. 

3.4.1. Bi-sr-Ca-Cu-0 System 

Typical results [35] in the form of a temperature-time- 
-transformation (T-T-T) diagram for the BiSrCaCu20y glass are 
given in Fig. 15. Each symbol denotes a mixture of crystalline 
phases as described in the figure caption. For example, the 
solid circle represents a mixture of the 80 K phase, CaO, and 
CuO. This. figure consists of three different areas (I-III) 
containing various phases. Area I consists mainly of glassy 
phase along with a trace of CaO, area II mainly of the 80 K 
(2212) phase and CaO, and area III of the single 80 K phase. 
Area II is further divided into three sub-areas according to the 
nature of the minor phases present. Area ll^ also contains CuoO, 
area IIj the CuO phase, and area II3 neither CuO nor CU2O. The

curves shown are drawn tentatively only as guides to the eyes* 
In this glass, CuO easily precipitates out and is present even 
after 800 *^C annealing probably because of the high copper 
content in the glass. Also, the 10 K phase is not formed for any 
annealing conditions. Only the 80 K phase is formed on direct 
heat treatment at "860 ^C. 

The T-T-T diagram [35] for Bi2Sr2CaCU20^ glass (Fig. 16) is 
quite simple but different from those for the other two 
compositions. No crystalline phase is formed even after four 
hours of heat treatment at 500 ^C. The 10 K (2201) phase 
crystallizes out when the glass is annealed at 600 ^C and only 
the 80 K (2212) phase is formed when heat treated at or above 
700 ^C. The nature of the crystalline phases formed depends only 
on temperature, but is independent of the time of annealing. 

Fig. 17 shows the T-T-T diagram [54] for the Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu30v 
glass composition. Various symbols and the phases they denote 
are given in the figure caption. For example, closed triangles

denote glassy phase with a trace of CU2O and residual CaO. For 
all the symbols other than the closed triangles, the 80 K (2212) 
HTS is the predominant crystalline phase. The solid line around 
500 °C represents the boundary between glass and crystal regions 
and above this line the 2212 is the main crystalline phase in 

20 



all cases. The 10 K phase is formed only on short heat 
treatments at around 600 °C as represented by the cross-hatched 
region. The boundary where the Cu(I) to Cu(II) transformation 
occurs is represented by the broken line and the 
dashed-and-dotted line indicates the boundary where CuO 
disappears. The temperature corresponding to each boundary 
decreases with increase in heat treatment time, implying that 
each solid state reaction depends on the heat treatment 
temperature and time. At temperatures over 700 °C and for heat 
treatment times longer than "4 h, only the 110 K (2223) phase is 
formed in a wide region. 

Transformation behavior [78] of the melt cast material of 
BigSrgCaCu^Ojj composition into the 2212 superconducting phase is 
different in air and nitrogen atmospheres. Due to a large 
fraction of copper ions present as Cu(I) in these materials, 
the crystallization mechanism is affected by the oxygen partial 
p?-essure. The DTA curves in air and nitrogen for the 
Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu30y glass prepared by twin roller rapid quenching are 
different [13-] from those made by the conventional metal plate 
quenching method. These results imply that the amount of Cu(I) 
ions in these glasses depends on the cooling rate and thus their 
crystallization behavior is affected by the conditions of glass 
synthesis. The glass preparation conditions have an effect [63] 
on the [Cu(I)]/[Cutotal] i^atio in the glass which in turn 
affects the glass structure and its crystallization mechanism. 
The glasses melted at lower temperature have [63] lower values 
of [Cu(I) ]/[Cutotal] ^^^ yield larger crystallites. 

The initial crystalline phase precipitating out of the 
Bi-Sr-Ga-Cu-G glasses was 2201. The TGA scan for Bi^SroCaoCUyiO^ 
glass melted at 1050 ^C showed [63] no weight gain in air in the 
temperature range corresponding to the first DTA exothermic peak 
which is ascribed to the crystallization of only the 2201 phase. 
Nassau et al [9] observed the formation of 2201 phase from Bi- 
glasses on heat treatment in nitrogen atmosphere implying that 
It is unnecessary to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere to form 
this phase. The mean valence of copper ions in this crystal 
phase is higher than in the parent glass indicating that 
crystallization is an oxidation process. Since no weight gain 
occurs during the first crystallization peak, the oxygen 
required for the crystal growth must come from the glassy 
matrix. It is, therefore, anticipated that glasses with low 
Cu(I)/Cutotal ratio produce larger 2201 crystals and vice versa. 
It should, therefore, be possible to retard the crystallization 
by controlling the atmosphere and the Cu(I)/Cu4.otal ratio since 
the crystal growth needs oxygen and the crystal size depends on 
the Cu(I)/Cutotal ratio. Continuous glass fibers have been 
successfully drawn [64] at a temperature above Tj, from a 
Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O glass preform having a high value of 

Cu(I)/Cutotal- 

On reheating glass of Bi^ 5SrCaCu20y composition in air, the 
following crystallization events are proposed [17] to occur: 

Bii5SrCaCU20y (glass) > 2201 + R + ? (+ glass) (5) 

(450 to 470 °C, Fast) 

2201 + R + ? (+ glass) > 2212 + CuO (6) 

(715 to 800 °C, slow) 

21 



2212 — > 2223 + R ('845 *^C, slow) (7) 

Where R is Bi2+xSr2«xCuOy ^^d ? represents an unidentified 
phase. 

Several mechanisms have been proposed [79] for formation of 
the 2223 phase but the exact mechanism is not known at the 
present time* One possibility is the disproportionation [80] of 
2212 at just below the melting point into 2223 and 2201: 

2Bi2Sr2CaCU208 > Bi2Sr2Ca2CU302Q + Bi2Sr2Cu06 (8) 

In the opinion of the present reviewer, the possibility of the 
disproportionation mechanism is unlikely. If excess CuO and CaO 
or some compounds containing both copper and calcium oxides such 
as Ca^Cu03 are present adjacent to the 2212 phase, the following 
reaction may occur 

Bi2Sr2CaCu208 + CuO + CaO > Bi2Sr2Ca2CU3O3^0 (9) 

provided that the 2223 phase is thermodynamically stable under 
the experimental conditions. The 2223 phase can also be produced 
by the following reaction: 

Bi2Sr2CuOg + 2CuO + 2CaO > Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu30;l^Q (10) 

The 2223 phase may also form [81] by precipitation from a 
partially melted liquid. Development of the 2223 phase on heat 
treatment of a melt-quenched Bi2Sr2Ca4Cu50y material at 865 ^C 
has been followed [21] by electron microscSpy, XRD, and ED^. The 
high T^ phase developed from the 80 K phase which in turn formed 
from the 2201 phase. Lattice imaging was employed to follow the 
conversion of 2212 phase into 2223. Presence of a liquid phase 
rich in Cu and Ca near the solid-liquid interface was essential 
for the evolution of the 110 K phase at 865 *^C. According to Luo 
et al [82], 2223 is formed through a peritectic or 
peritectic-like melting of 4334 phase at *863 ^C in air: 

4334 (solid) > liquid -f 2223 (solid) -f O2 ("*865-870*^C) (11) 

The 2223 has a plate-like morphology and is bounded by an 
amorphous phase. A thin layer of 4334 is also systematically 
observed between 2223 and the amorphous phase. The conditions 
for preparation of the 2223 phase are very critical because of 
the long range diffusion involved, the locally nonequilibrated 
oxygen partial pressure, and especially the narrow temperature 
stability domain of 2223. Starting from the peritectic 
decomposition of 4334, it would be very difficult to prepare 
2223 with good properties due to the coexistence of a 4334, 
2234, and 2223 intergrowth composite microstructure on a very 
fine scale. This microstructure may result in low J^^ and a broad 
superconducting transition. 

A single superconducting 110 K phase material has been 
prepared [30,32] by crystallization of Bi2Sr2Ca3Cu40y and 
Bi2Sr;jCa4CU50y glasses at 870 *^C for 10 days in air. The 
starting composition as well as the annealing parameters are 
important in forming the 110 K phase. The 80 K and Ca2Cu03

3. 4 •2. Bi-Pb-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 System 

Formation of crystalline phases on thermal treatment of 
Pb-doped glasses of different compositions has been investigated 
by a number of researchers. The development [50] of various 
crystalline phases on heat treatment of a glass of 
^fl.5P^0.5^^2^^2^^3^y composition under different conditions is 
given in Table V. Typical results in the form of T-T-T diagrams 
are [54] presented in Fig. 18 for Bi^ gPbo 2Sr2Ca2Cu30^ and in 
Fxg. 19 for Bii^gPbQ^4Sr2Ca2Cu30y glass compositions. In the 
figures, each symbol represents the crystalline phases formed on 
heat treatment of the glass at a given temperature and time. For

with a trace of CU2O and residual CaO. The double squares

In Figs. 17, 18, and 19 the formation, transformation, and 
disappearance of copper oxides are quite similar, yet the 
regions of the 10 K phase formation are different. The regions 
of 10 K phase formation (the cross-hatched area) and CaoPbOy, 
formation (surrounded by double lines) tend to extend with an 
increase in Pb content. The major difference between Fig. 18 and 
19 IS that both the 10 K phase and Ca2Pb04 are easily formed 
even at short annealing times in the Pb-rich glass. However, at 
long annealing times the formation patterns of both phases are 
similar. The large region for formation of Ca2Pb04 in the lead 
rich glass may be explained [54] by the fact that this compound 
consists of only Pb and Ca oxides. The production of this 
Ca-rich Ca2Pb04 would enhance the formation of a Ca-deficient 
phase such as Bi2Sr2CuOg. 

,«x Ca2Pb04 is formed [54] in Bii gPbo 4Sr2Ca2Cu30„ glass (Fig. 
19) on short term annealing at 855 °C. However, after long term 
annealing Ca2Pb04 disappears and the lio K phase is formed 
implying that Ca2Pb04 plays an important role in the production 
of the high-Tj. phase. Probably the CaoPbO. melt formed at "850 
"C reacts with 2212 and CuO to produce 2223. 

The following crystallization sequence on heat treatment of 
the Bii 5Pbo.5Sr2Ca2CU30y. glass in air has been proposed [15, 
50]. The 2201 phase first precipitates out followed by formation 

25 



of the 2212 phase at higher temperature • The 110 K T^^ phase is 
formed at still higher temperature just below the melting point 
probably by reaction between the low-T^^ 2201 and 2212 phases and 
the residual calcium and copper oxides. The high-T^^ phase 
formation rate is sluggish and takes a long time (days) due to 
the relatively long-range diffusive ordering involved. Even 
after prolonged heating of the glass at 840 *^C for more than ten 
days, the product contained an appreciable amount of the 80 K 
phase in addition to the 110 K phase. TGA curves [15,50] in 
oxygen (Fig. 20) showed that formation of the 2212 phase is 
accompanied by a rapid absorption of O2 and no uptake of O2 
occurs during the formation of the 2201 phase at low temperature 
or when the high-T^^ 2223 phase is produced at 840 ^C.

^C for >48 h in Ar+02 atmosphere, mainly contains [83] the 110 K 
phas^. The formation of the 110 K phase appears not to be the 
result of disproportionation. It is suggested [83] that a liquid 
phase is formed which causes dissolution of the low-T^-, phase in 
the melt and precipitation of the 110 K phase.

EFFECTS OF PROCESSING CONDITIONS ON T g AND J ^ 



The superconducting properties of the glass-ceramics are 
sensitive to the composition and are also dependent on the glass 
melting temperature and quenching rate, annealing temperature, 
time, atmosphere, and cooling conditions • Description of the 
results for all of the glass compositions which have been 



26 



studied is beyond the scope of this chapter. Only typical 
results from a few selected studies are included here.

Specimens annealed for 50 - 200 h had T^. of 80 K. The sample 
annealed for 200 h showed the highest J^. of 200 A/cm^. The 840 
^C annealed specimens also exhibited similar [28] behavior. Weak 
links at the grain boundaries are responsible for low values of 
J^ in these glass ceramics. The density of weak links at the 
grain boundaries needs to be reduced in order to improve the J^. 

The effect of annealing atmosphere (O2, air, or vacuum) on 
T^ of glasses of BiSrCaCu^Oy, Bi2Sr2Ca2CU30y, Bi3Sr3Ca3CU40y, 
and Bi3Sr3Ca4CU50y compositions annealed for 24 or 48 h at 870 
to 880 ^C has been investigated [14]. Annealing in O^ greatly 
enhanced the 110 K transition. The samples annealed xn air 
showed transitions at 110 and 85 K whereas only the 85 K 
transition along with a long tail extending below 77 K was 
observed in the vacuum-annealed specimens. 

The rate at which the sample is cooled after annealing also 
affects its superconducting behavior. A glass of Bi-^ 5SrCaCU20y 
composition heat treated at 845 ^C for 88 h in air followed by 
fast cooling showed [17,18] semiconducting behavior in the 
normal state, a 50% drop in resistance at 88 K, and a broad 
resistive tail with Tq(R=0) of 11 K. In contrast, another sample 
similarly annealed, but slow cooled, was metallic in the normal 
state, exhibited a small resistivity drop at 108 K, a major drop 
at 87 K, and T^.(R=0) of 55 K. The sample annealed for 168 h at 
845 *^C in air and furnace cooled exhibited a T^(R=0) at 77 K. 
However, a BiSrCaCu20y glass sample annealed at 850 ^C for 24 h 
in oxygen and cooled rapidly showed [23] a sharp superconducting 
transition and higher T^ whereas the furnace cooled sample 
exhibited a broad transition with a tail and low T^. The effect 
of cooling conditions on the superconducting properties of 
Bi], ^2^^CaCU20y and Bi2Sr2CaCU20y glass-ceramics has also been 
investigated 127]. Two glass specimens of Bi^^ oSrCaCu20y 
compositions were annealed at 880 *^C for 20 h*in air ana one was 
rapidly quenched in air and the other was furnace cooled. The 
temperature dependence of electrical resistivity of these 
samples is shown in Fig. 26. The quenched sample has a high 
normal state resistivity with a sharp drop at "90 K followed by 
a long tail which persists to very low temperatures. On the 
other hand, the furnace cooled sample shows a much smaller value 
of normal state resistivity. Also, it exhibits a drop in 
resistivity at ""lOS K indicating the formation of the high-T^^ 
phase followed by a sharp drop at "85 K with a T(^(R=0) of "68 K. 
The effect of cooling conditions on the value of T^^ of the glass 
ceramics obtained by annealing a glass of Bi2Sr2CaCu20y 
composition at 820 '^C for 48 h in air differs from that for the 
^^1.2^^^^*^^2^y '^^^ normal state resistivity of the furnace 
cooled sample was smaller than for the air quenched sample, but 
the former showed a T^(R=0) value of 85 K compared with 88 K for 
the latter. The reason for this difference in behavior is not 
clear. The influence of various cooling rates on T^^ of 
BiSrCaCu20y, Bi2Sr2Ca2CU30y, Bi3Sr3Ca3Cu40y, and Bi3SroCa4CU50y 
glasses annealed for 24 or 48 h at 870 to 880 ^C in air, O2/ or 
vacuum has also been studied [14]. The T(.(onset) increased with 
decrease in cooling rate. 

The Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 glasses are deficient in oxygen as 
indicated by appreciable weight gains [7,9,14,17,18] starting at 
"500 ^C in the TGA scans in oxygen-containing atmospheres and 
also from the results of Table I. The weight increase is caused

by the oxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II). The amount of oxygen 
absorption increased with the CuO content in the glasses which 
may be due to an increase in their Cu(I) concentration. Also, 
these glasses lose Og at high temperatures as indicated by 
weight loss in the TGA scans [7,9,14], An increase in the 
cooling rate and/or the annealing temperature would result in 
higher deficiency of oxygen in these glass-ceramics. Therefore, 
a lower T^ of the materials annealed in oxygen-deficient 
atmosphere or those fast cooled after annealing may be ascribed 
to the deficiency of oxygen. 

3.5.2. Bi-Pb-Sr-Ca-cu-o System 

The annealing temperature greatly effects the nature of the 
phase formation in the glass-ceramic samples and their T,,. 
Temperature dependence of electrical resistance of the 
^il.5P^0.5Sr2'^^2C^30y glass specimens annealed at different 
temperatures for 24 h in air and furnace cooled is shown in Fig. 
27 and the results are summarized in Table V. The as-quenched 
glass was an insulator and the sample annealed at 500 °C was 
semiconducting. The specimen heat treated at 720 °C showed 
Tc(R=9) of 75 K. The sample annealed at 750 °C showed a sharp 
drop in resistance, but had a long tail and the resistance did 
not become zero even at 63 K. The 802 °C annealed sample had a 
sharp resistivity drop starting at "80 K with Tr.(R=0) of 69 K. 
The specimen heat treated at 840 °c for 24 h showed a small drop 
in resistance at "110 K, and a sharp transition at "78 K with 
Tc(R=0) at 68 K. Annealing at 850 °c resulted in partial melting 
and a long tail in the resistance vs. temperature curve with 
Tc(R=0) < 77K. An annealing temperature of 840 °C appears to be 
optimum for formation of the 110 K phase for this glass 
composition. In Bi-^ 6Pbo.4Sr2Ca2Cu30„ glass, the highest T^(R=0) 
of 106 K was observed [58] in the saftple annealed at 845 °C for 
24 h in air. The T^ decreased when the annealing temperature was 
raised further. 

The influence of annealing time at 840 °C in air on 110 K 
phase formation in Bi-L^ 5Pbo.5Sr2Ca2CU30y glass is shown [50] in 
Fig. 28 and Table V. The zero resistance temperature increased 
with the time of annealing at 840 °C. The specimen annealed for 
243 h and furnace cooled exhibited a very sharp transition with 
Tc(R=0) of 107.2 K. The Bii, 6Pbo.4Sr2Ca2CU30v glass samples 
annealed at 845 "c in air showed [58] a fixed value of Tc(R=0) 
of 106 K for annealing times longer than 24 h. However, the J^ 
value increased with the annealing time probably due to an 
increase in the volume fraction of the 110 K phase. These 
results indicate slow kinetics of the 110 K phase formation 
reaction resulting in the need for very long annealing times for 
formation of glass-ceramic samples having an appreciable amount 
of the high-T^ phase and showing high T^ and J^. 

The effects of annealing in air or nitrogen atmospheres on 
the formation of HTS phases in Bij_ gRbp 4Sr2Ca2CU30„ have been 
studied [84]. The fraction of the high-T^ phase increased with 
sintering time in air, and there was virtually no effect even 
after annealing for 264 h in N2. The absence of oxygen favored 
the formation of the low-Tj, phase and inhibited the formation of 
the high-Tc phase. These results are further substantiated 
from the TGA scans [15,50] shown in Fig. 20. At high 
temperature, a gain in sample weight is observbed in O2 while

the sample lost weight in N2. The weight gain in On is probably 
due to oxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) which is necessary for the 
formation of the 2212 phase. 

The influence of cooling rate, after annealing of the 
5^1.5^*^0. 5S^2C^2C"30y glass in air, on the temperature 
dependence of electrical resistivity is shown [50] in Fig. 29. 
Two glass samples were annealed for 94 h at 840 ^C in air; one 
was furnace cooled and the other was rapidly quenched to ambient 
temperature in air. The former sample showed a sharp transition 
at no K with Tc(R=0) of 98 K Whereas the latter exhibited a 
large resistance drop at 110 K with another transition at "90 K 
and Tp(R=0) of 68 K. In contrast, for specimens prepared from 
m ?T,^if^^ precursor of Bi^ 6Pbp.4Sr2Ca2Cu30„ composition, higher 
T (R=0) was observed [42] in alr-quincfied samples than those 
which were furnace cooled after prolonged annealing in air at 
840 c. The reason for these conflicting observations is not 
clear at this time.

However, the excess CuO present as an impurity could reiult [53, 
83,69] m degradation of the superconducting properties such as 
lower J^. The use of an excess of CuO or CaO is, therefore, not 
advisable. High temperature annealing under a proper controlled 
atmosphere would be more promising. The effect of copper oxide 
content on the superconducting properties of Bio.8Pbo.2SrCaCUxOy

(x = 1.5, 1.8 and 2.0) glass-ceramics has been investigated 
[69]. Values of both T^ and, J,. (Fig. 30) of samples annealed at 
840 C for 250 h in air decreased with increasing CuO content. 
The composition with x = 1.5 exhibited the highest T^(R=0) of 
106 k and a J^ of 250 A/cm^. ex / 

The influence of Pb content on the superconductivity of the 
nominal compositions BiPbxSr2CaoCu30y, Bii_jjPbxSr2Ca2Cu30v, and 
Bii_xPbxSr2Ca2Gu5 gOy has been investigated [85]. Addition of Pb 
lowered the melting temperature and had a catalytic effect on 
the formation of the high-T^ phase. The optimum value of x for 
the highest T^ and the maximum fraction of the high-T^ phase was 
0.3. At higher PbO concentration Ca2Pb04 formed which assisted 
in the formation of the low-T^ phase. The optimum value of the 
Pb content is determined by the competition between the two 
reactions which result in the formation of the high-T^ phase and 
Ca2Pb04, respectively. ^ 

The nearly pure 2223 phase has only been obtained [86-88] by 
the substitution of lead. The effect of this substitution is not 
well understood. Lead is known to partially substitute [89] into 
the bismuth oxide planes of the crystal structure of the 110 K 
phase. The effect [90] of this substitution is to stabilize the 
structure and facilitate its formation as a nearly pure phase. 
Incorporation [91] of PbO lowers the melting point and viscosity 
of the glass probably by acting as a fluxing agent. However, it 
has been suggested [91] that a mechanism other than a lowered 
melting temperature or fluxing action is probably responsible 
for the beneficial effect of PbO addition. According to Shi et 
al, [33] the 2212 phase is always formed first because of the 
higher free energy of the 2223 phase due to the longer c-axis of 
its unit cell. The kinetics of 2223 phase formation are 
controlled by calcium and copper diffusion. The presence of lead 
accelerates growth of the 2223 phase by enhancing diffusion of 
calcium and copper during insertion of an extra layer of Ca-0 
and Cu-0 into the unit cell of 2212. The Pb atoms are easily 
incorporated into the structure probably because Bi in the +3 
oxidation state and Pb in the +2 state have the same outer 
electronic shell configuration of es^ep^. On the other hand, 
substitution of the bigger JPb^^ cation (ionic radius = 1.20A) 
for Bi-' (ionic radius = 0.96A) probably results in the 
distortion of the crystal lattice. 

Nobumasa et al . [92] observed the high-T^ phase directly by 
high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and 
found that the Pb atoms were located in the Bi-O layers with an 
atomic ratio of Pb/Bi "0.1. More recently the structures and 
superconducting properties of Bi-L.^Pb^SrCaCu-. gO^ (0 ^ x < 1) 
ceramics prepared by the powder sintering method-^have been 
examined [93]. For low Pb/Bi ratios, Pb atoms incorporated into 
the structure of both the low-T^. and high-Tc phases, whereas for 
high Pb content (x > 0.25) the Pb-rich phase appeared. In light 
of these results, the value (around x ~ 0.2) of the optimum 
substitution of Pb for Bi for the formation of the high-Tc phase 
in Bi^.^Pb^SrCaCuj^ cjOy system might be closely related to the 
maximum Pb content incorporating in the high-T^. phase. This is 
in agreement with the results of many other researchers [13,52, 
53,69,73] who also found ^20% to be the optimum substitution of 
Pb for Bi for the formation of a large amount of the high-T 
phase. Ibara et al [61] investigated the effect of doping the 



35 



glasses of Bio.sSrp gCaCui 40y and BiSrCaCu20y compositions with 
various concentrations of PbO. The highest T(,tR=0) of 102 K was 
observed in BiPbn iSrCaCuoOv annealed in ArrO, = 12:1 atmosphere 
at 840-850 °C for* 100 h. ^ 

In the Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 glass system, the optimum annealing 
temperature to form the high-T^ phase is "870 <^C. In the 
presence of PbO this temperature is lowered to '840 °C. 
Prolonged firing at 840 °C is very effective [15,50] in 
enhancing the fraction of the 110 K phase and also in 
circumventing the intergrain connectivity problem of this phase. 
However, a Bii^sPbQ 5Sr2Ca2Cu30y sample obtained [15,50] by 
annealing the glass* at 840 °C f6r more than ten days in air 
showed Tc(R=0) of 107.2 K, but the sample was still multiphase 
(Fig. 31) and contained an appreciable fraction of 2212 along 
with other minor phases. The optimum [13,52,53,69,73,92,93] 
starting glass composition appears to be Bii gPbg 4Sr2Ca2CU30v. 
When annealed at "840-845 °C in air for a long time, a large 
volume fraction of the 110 K phase is formed in this glass which 
shows a T<2(R=0) of "107 K along with a high J^,. 

3.6. Bi-HTS DOPED WITH OTHER ELEMENTS 

The values of Tg, T^, and the glass stability factor (T,, - 
Tg) for the Bi-Sr-cI-Cu-0 glasses doped with AI2O3 or V2O5 are 
given in Table III. Classification of the Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O system 
was . increased [71,94] by the addition of alumina. Crystalliza- 
tion of a BiSrCaCu2Alo.50x glass rod under a thermal gradient 
enhanced [95] the growth of the anisotropic plate-like 
superconducting crystals and improved their intergrain coupling 
which could result in higher J^,. Also, on crystallization under 
a thermal gradient the impurity aluminum was excluded [94] from 
the HTS phases to form alumina fibers. Glass forming ability of 
Bi4Sr3Ca3Cu40y composition [64] was also enhanced by doping with 
0.75 mol % of V2O5. The V205-doped glass also showed higher 
values of Tg, Tj^, and thermal stability than the undoped 
Bi4Sr3Ca3Cu40y glass. The (Bi.Pb) 2Sr2Ca2Cu30„ glasses doped with 
various concentrations of Sb [96], Mo [97], Te [98], or Nb [99], 
oxides have been prepared by the melt quenching method. The 
glass-forming ability was retarded by the addition of Nb205 and 
Te02. In the glass-ceramics obtained by annealing the glasses at 
different temperatures, formation of the high-T^ superconducting 
phase was remarkably enhanced by the presence of these oxides. 
This was due to lowering of the partial melting temperature 
caused by the coexistence of PbO and the dopant metal oxide. 

3.7. FABRICATION OF HTS FIBERS 

The glass precursor approach has been used for the 
fabrication of fibers [64,67,70,72,74,100-103], fine rods [94, 
95,104], tapes [83], and thick films [91,105-107] of the 
Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O and Bi-Pb-Sr-Ca-Cu-O systems. Fiber drawing from a 
glass preform of Bi2Sr2CaCu20y composition was not successful 
[64] due to rapid crystallization. However, continuous glass 
fibers with diameter of "100 jum have been successfully drawn 
[64] of the undoped Bi4Sr3Ca3Cu^Oy and the one doped with 0.75 
mole % V2O5 composition by heating the glass preform to 525-550 
°C, After 12 h heat treatment at 820 °c, the fibers exhibited a 
Tc (onset) at 85 K and were still very flexible. Continuous and 
flexible 120 cm long glass fibers of Bi;^ 5SrCaCU20y composition

have been drawn [67] from a glass preform at 434 °c. Glass 
fibers. of BijSrgCaCujOy composition have been drawn [101] from a 
glass preform and surface coated with a silver paste. After 
annealing at 840 °C for 5 h in air. the fibers showed a Tf,(R=0) 
Of 70 K and a Jc(60 K) of >40 A/cm^. Glass fibers of various 
compositions in the Bi-Pb-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 system have been 
prepared [70,103] from melt-quenched glass preforms which became 
superconducting after appropriate heat treatments. The glass 
ceramic fiber of Bi^ 2Pt>o 9Sr2Ca2Cu30y composition showed a 
Tc(R=0) of "109 K and J^ of 1480 A/cfti^ (at 77 K) after 100 h 
heat treatment in air at 840 °C. Glasses with high Bi content in 
the BijjPbySr^Ca2Cu302 system were easily drawn [72] into fibers. 
After annealing at 840 °C for 100 h, glass fibers of 
^/'•2.3P'^0,6^^2^^2^^3Oz composition showed [72] T^ of 84 K. 

Preliminary attempts have been made for fabrication [74] of 
long slender fibers from melts of Bi2Sr2CaCU20„ and BiSrCaCupO„ 
compositions using a gas jet fiberization technique. On ^ 
subsequent heat treatment at 855 °C for 16 h in air, the 
amorphous fibers were converted into the 2 212 HTS. Glass fibers 
of short lengths have also been prepared [100] by spinning a 
melt of Bi4Sr3Ca3Cu40y composition. On heat treatment at 830 °C 
for 24 h, the glass fibers crystallized into the 2212 phase 
along with small amounts of BigSroCuOo and CuO phases and showed 
a Tj,(onset) of "80 K. 

The glass precursor technique has also been employed [108] 
to apply a superconducting coating on a Pt wire by passing it 
through a melt of 2212 composition at 1075 °C followed by 
quenching. On subsequent heat treatment at 800 °C, the 
superconducting 2212 phase is formed by devitrification of the 
glassy coating. The composite wire showed a Tj,(R=0) of "60 K and 
could be flexed and wound without effecting its superconducting 
behavior. 

4. Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O SYSTEM 

Nassau et al [9] tried to prepare glasses of the 
compositions Tl2Ba2CaCu20x, Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu30x, and the latter 
containing lead by melting 5 g batches of the powder in an 
iridium crucible in air for less than 3 minutes. Considerable 
loss of TljO occurred during melting as indicated by black 
smoke.. The melt was rapidly quenched between twin metal rollers 
attaining a quenching rate of "10^ K/s. Some glass was obtained 
only for the Tl2Ba2CaCu20x composition. On heating, this showed 
a Tg of 280 °C and a number of exotherms starting at 300 °C. In 
the XRD patterns of the heat treated glass, strongest 
diffraction peaks of CuO, CU2O, and possibly CaCu203 were 
present alongwith a number of other peaks which could not be 
indexed. The study was not pursued any further. 

5. Y-Ba-Cu-O SYSTEM 

Rapid quenching of small droplets of YBa2CU30„ melt on steel 
plates resulted [109] in an amorphous material which showed T„ 
of 330 °C and 1^ of 780 ^C in the DTA along with a large number 
of endothermic peaks which were not explained. In the view of 
the present reviewer, the reported values of T„ and Ty are 
doubtful. The orthorhombic YBa2Cu307_5 HTS phase was formed on 
heat treatment for 12 h in flowing 03 at 850 °c, but some other 
phases were also present. On annealing in flowing O2 for 12 h at 

38 



950 °C, almost phase pure HTS material was produced with a 
Tp(R=0) of "92 K, Attempts by many other researchers [110-121] 
did not result in the formation of a glassy material on rapid 
cooling of the R-Ba-Cu-0 (R = Y, Gd, Yb) melts. Even rapid 
quenching of Y-Ba-Cu-0 melt using a metal twin-roller did not 
form glass. The presence of a glass former [122-124] such as 
B2O3 was helpful in obtaining this composition in the glassy 
state. However, the HTS phase formed on heat treatment of this 
glass was discontinuous. 

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

It is very difficult to form the Y-Ba-Cu-0 and the 
Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-0 HTS systems in the glassy state by rapid quenching 
of the melts. The Bi-HTS systems can, however, be obtained as 
glasses from fast melt quenching. 61203 acts as the glass former 
and plays an important role. The thermal stability factor, 
'^x," ^g' is large for glasses rich in 61203 and alkaline earth 
oxides whereas the CuO-rich glasses show smaller values. 

Superconducting material having high T^^, and J^ and 
containing a large volume fraction of the 110 K phase can be 
formed from a BIq QPbQ/2SrCaCu3^ 50y glass by annealing at "840 - 
845 C in air for an extended period of time followed by slow 
cooling. However, synthesis of a single phase 2223 HTS material 
by the glass precursor approach appears to be difficult. The 
advantage of the starting components being intimately mixed in 
the melt is lost as the 2223 phase does not precipitate out 
directly from the glass matrix but is preceded by the 
crystallization of other phases. The high-T^. phase is produced 
at high temperatures by a slow diffusion controlled reaction 
between the phases formed at lower temperatures. 

Continuous Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 or lead-doped glass fibers can be 
drawn by heating a glass preform around its softening point. 
However, the sluggish kinetics of high-Tc phase formation 
presently offers a severe limitation on the practical utility of 
the glass precursor approach to Bi- HTS fabrication, 
particularly for continuous fiber or wire.

1 3. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words) 

The available studies on the synthesis of high-T^ superconductors (HTS) via the glass precursor approach have been 
reviewed. Melts of the Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 system as well as those doped with oxides of some other elements (Pb, Al, V, 
Te, Nb, etc.) could be quenched into glasses which, on further heat treatments under appropriate conditions, crystal- 
lized into the superconducting phase (s). The nature of the HTS phase (s) formed depends on the annealing tempera- 
ture, time, atmosphere and the cooling rate and also on the glass composition. Long term annealing was needed to 
obtain a large fraction of the 110 K phase. The high-T^ phase did not crystallize out directly from the glass matrix, but 
was preceded by the precipitation of other phases. The 110 K HTS was produced at high temperatures by reaction 
between the phases formed at lower temperatures resulting in multiphase material The presence of a glass former 
such as B2O3 was necessary for the Y-Ba-Cu-0 melt to form a glass on fast cooling. A discontinuous YBa2Cu30'7_5 
HTS phase crystallized out on heat treatment of this glass. Attempts to prepare Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-0 system in the glassy 
state were not successful.
