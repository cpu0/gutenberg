CHAPTER 1 


INTRODUCTION 


The Ada implementation described above was tested according to the 
Ada Validation Procedures [Pro90] against the Ada Standard [Ada83] 
using the current Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC). This 
Validation Summary Report (VSR) gives an account of the testing of 
this Ada implementation. For any technical terms used in this 
report, the reader is referred to [Pro90]. A detailed description 
of the ACVC may be found in the current ACVC User's Guide [UG89].

1.3 aCVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. 
The ACVC contains a collection of test programs structured into six 
test classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test 
name identifies the class to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and 
E tests are executable. Class B and class L tests are expected to 
produce errors at compile time and link time, respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and 
produce a PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the 
result when they are executed. Three Ada library units, the 
packages REPORT and SPPRT13, and the procedure CHECK_FILE are used 
for this purpose. The package REPORT also provides a set of 
identity functions used to defeat some compiler optimizations 
allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test objective. 
The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the Ada 
Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents 
of text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 
of the Ada Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is 
checked by a set of executable tests. If these units are not 
operating correctly, validation testing is discontinued. Class B 
tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled 
and the resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that 
all violations of the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class 
B tests contain legal Ada code which must not be flagged illegal by 
the compiler. This behavior is also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects 
violation of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately 
compiled units. Errors are expected at link time, and execution is 
attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be 
replaced by implementation-specific values — for example, the 
largest integer. A list of the values used for this implementation 
is provided in Appendix A. In addition to these anticipated test 
modifications, additional changes may be required to remove 
unforeseen conflicts between the tests and implementation-dependent 
characteristics. The modifications required for this 
implementation are described in section 2.3. 

For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by 


1-2 




the AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications 
described in the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see 
section 2.1) and, possibly some inapplicable tests (see Section 3.2 
and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each 
test of the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


2.1 WITHDRAWN TESTS 

Some tests are withdrawn by the AVO from the ACVC because they do 
not conform to the Ada Standard. The following 94 tests had been 
withdrawn by the Ada Validation Organization (AVO) at the time of 
validation testing. The rationale for withdrawing each test is 
available from either the AVO or the AVF. The publication date for 
this list of withdrawn tests is 91-05-03.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are 
irrelevant for a given Ada implementation. The inapplicability 
criteria for some tests are explained in documents issued by ISO 
and the AJPO known as Ada Issues and commonly referenced in the 
format Al-dddd. For this implementation, the following tests were 
inapplicable for the reasons indicated; references to Ada Issues 
are included as appropriate. 

The following 201 tests have floating-point type declarations 
requiring more digits than SYSTEM.MAX_DIGITS: 

C24113L..Y (14 tests) C35705L..Y (14 tests) 
C35706L..Y (14 tests) C35707L..Y (14 tests) 
C35708L..Y (14 tests) C35802L..Z (15 tests) 




C45241L..Y (14 tests) C45321L.,Y (14 tests) 

C45421L..Y (14 tests) C45521L..Z (15 tests) 

C45524L..Z (15 tests) C45621L..Z (15 tests) 

C45641L..Y (14 tests) C46012L..Z (15 tests) 

C24113H..K (4 tests) use a line length greater than m;.X_IN_LEN. 

C35713B, C45423B, B86001T, and C86006H check for the predefined 
type SHORT_FLOAT; for this implementation, there is no such type. 

The following 21 tests check for the predefined type SHORT_IKTEGER; 
for this implementation, there is no such type: 

C35404B B36105C C45231B C45304B C45411B 
C45412B C45502E C45503B C455U4B C45504E 
C45611B C45613B C45614B C45631B C45632B 
B52004E C55B07B B55B09D B86001V C86006D 
CD7101E 

C35404D, C45231D, B86001X, C86006E, and CD7101G cneck for =* 
predefined integer type with a name other than INTEGER, 
LONG_INTEGER, or SHORT_INTEGER; for this implementation, there is 
no such type. 

C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with 
a name other than FLOAT, LONG_FLOAT, or SHORT_FLOAT; for this 
implementation, there is no such type. 

C45531M..P and C45532M..P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations 
for types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or greater; for 
this implementation, there is no such type. 

C45624A..B (2 tests) check that the proper exception is raised if 
MACHINE_OVERFLOWS is FALSE for floating point types; for this 
implementation, MACHINE_OVERFLOWS is TRUE. 

B86001Y uses the name of a predefined fixed-point type other than 
DURATION; for this implementation, there is no such type. 

CD1009C checks whether a length clause can specify a non-default 
size for a floating-point type; this implementation does not 
support such sizes. 

CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use length 
clauses to specify non-default sizes for access types; this 
implementation does not support such sizes. 

AE2101C and EE2201D..E (2 tests) use instantiations of package 
SEQUENTIAL_IO with unconstrained array types and record types with 
discriminants without defaults; these instantiations are rejected 
by this compiler. 






AE21C1H, EE2401D, and EE2401G use instantiations of package 
DIRECT_IO with unconstrained array types and record types with 
discriminants without defaults; these instantiations are rejected 
by this compiler. 

The tests listed in the following table are not applicable because

CE2403A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of an 
external direct file is exceeded; this implementation cannot 
restrict file capacity. 

CE3304A checks that SET_LINE_LENGTH and SET_PAGE_LENGTH raise 
USE_ERROR if they specify an inappropriate value for the external 
file; there are no inappropriate values for this implementation. 

CE3413B checks that PAGE raises LAYOUT_ERROR when the value of the 
page number exceeds COUNT'LAST. For this implementation, the value 
of COUNT'LAST is greater than 150000 making the checking of this 
objective impractical. 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 44 tests. 

The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
implementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in 


the way expected by the 

original 

tests.

C83030C and C86007A were graded passed by Test Modification as 
directed by the AVO. These tests were modified by inserting 
"PRAGMA ELABORATE (REPORT);" before the package declarations at 
lines 13 and 11, respectively. Without the pragma, the packages 
may be elaborated prior to package Report's body, and thus the 
packages' calls to function REPORT.IDENT_INT at lines 14 and 13, 
respectively, will raise PROGRAM_ERROR. 

C34005P and C34005S were graded passed by Test Modification as 
directed by the AVO. These tests contain expressions of the form 
"I - X'FIRST -t- Y'FIRST", where X and Y are of an array type with a 
lower bound of INTEGER'FIRST; this implementation recognizes that 
"X' FIRST -t- Y'FIRST" is a loop invariant and so evaluates this part 
of the expression separately, which raises NUMERIC_ERROR. These 
tests were modified by inserting parens to force a different order 
of evaluation (i.p., to force the subtraction to be evaluated 
first) at lines 187 and 262/263, respectively; those modified lines 
are:

For a point of contact for sales information about this Ada 
implementation system, see: 

NOT APPLICABLE FOR THIS IMPLEMENTATION 

Testing of this Ada implementation was conducted at the 
customer's site by a validation team from the AVF. 

3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes 
each test of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada 
Programming Language Standard, whether the test is applicable or 
inapplicable; otherwise, the Ada Implementation fails the ACVC 
[Pro90]. 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard. 


a) Total Number of Applicable Tests 3772 

b) Total Number of Withdrawn Tests 94 

c) Processed Inapplicable Tests 304 

d) Non-Processed I/O Tests 0 

e) Non-Processed Floating-Point 

Precision Tests 0 


3-1 




f) Total Number of Inapplicable Tests 304 (c+d-^e) 

g) Total Number of Tests for ACVC 1.11 4170 (a+b-i-f) 


When this implementation was tested, the tests listed in section 
2.1 had been withdrawn because of test errors. 


3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

Version 1.11 of the ACVC comprises 4170 tests. When this 
compiler was tested, the tests listed in section 2.1 had been 
withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF determined that 304 
tests were inapplicable to this implementation. All 
inapplicable tests were processed during validation testing. 
In addition, the modified tests mentioned in section 2.3 were 
also processed. 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see 
section 1.3) was taken on-site by the validation team for 
processing. The contents of the magnetic tape were loaded 
directly onto the host computer. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host computer, the 
full set of tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 

The tests were compiled and linked on the host computer system 
and executed on the target computer system. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the 
customer and reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B 
for a complete listing of the processing options for this 
implementation. It also indicates the default options. The 
options invoked explicitly for validation testing during this 
test were: 


FOR /OPTIMIZE the options were: 

/SUMMARY /OPTIMIZE /SOURCE /EMR /OUT=<filename> 

The options invoked by default for validation testing during 
this test were: 


FOR /OPTIMIZE the options were: 

NO_MACHINE_CODE NO_ATTRIBUTE NO_CROSS_REFERENCE 

NO DIAGNOSTICS NO NOTES PRIVATE LIST CONTAINER_GENERATION 


3-2 



CODE_ON_WARNING NO_MEASURE DEBUG CHECKS NO_EXECUTIVE 
NO_RTE_ONLY TRACE_BACK 

Test output, compiler and linker listings, and job logs were 
captured on magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. Selected 
listings examined on-site by the validation tea were also 
archived.

MACRO PARAMETERS 


This appendix contains the macro parameters used for 
customizing the ACVC. The meaning and purpose of these 
parameters are explained in [UG89]. The parameter values are 
presented in two tables. The first table lists the values 
that are defined in terms of the maximum input-line length, 
which is I the value for $MAX_IN_LEN—also listed here. 
These values are expressed here as Ada string aggregates, 
where "V" represents the maximum input-line length.

Appendix F 

The Ada Language for the AN/UYK-43 Target 


The source language accepted by the compiler is Ada, as 
described in the Military Standard, .'^da Programming Language, 
ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A-i983, 17 February 1983 ("Ada Language 
Reference Manual"). 

The Ada definition permits certain implementation 
dependencies. Each Ada implementation is required to supply a 
complete description of its dependencies, to be thought of as 
Appendix F to the Ada Language Reference Manual. This section is 
that description for the AN/UYK-43 target. 


F.l Options 

There are several compiler options provided by all ALS/N 
Compilers that directly affect the pragmas defined in the Ada 
Language Reference Manual. These compiler options currently 
include the CHECKS and OPTIMIZE options which affect the SUPPRESS 
and OPTIMIZE pragmas, respectively. A complete list of ALS/N 
Compiler options can be found in Section 9. 

The CHECKS option enables all run-time error checking for the 
source file being compiled, which can contain one or more 
compilation units. This allows the SUPPRESS pragma to be used in 
suppressing the run-time checks discussed in the Ada Language 
Reference Manual, but note that the SUPPRESS pragma(s) must be 
applied to each compilation unit. The NO_CHECKS option disables 
all run-time error checking for all compilation units within the 
source file and is equivalent to SUPPRESSing all run-time checks 
within every compilation unit. 

The OPTIMIZE option enables all compile-time optimizations 
for the source file being compiled, which can contain one or more 
compilation units. This allows the OPTIMIZE pragma to request 
either TIME-oriented or SPACE-oriented optimizations be 
performed, but note that the OPTIMIZE pragma must be applied to 
each compilation unit. If the OPTIMIZE pragma is not present, 
the ALS/N Compiler's Global Optimizer tends to optimize for TIME 
over SPACE. The NO OPTIMIZE option disables all compile-time 
optimizations for aTl compilation units within the source file 
regardless of whether or not the OPTIMIZE pragma is present. 

In addition to those compiler options normally provided by 
the ALS/N Common Ada Baseline cc;npilers, the Ada/L compiler also 
implements the EXECUTIVE, DEBUG, and MEASURE options. 


F.l Options 


F-01 




Version 3.5 
29 March 1991 


Ada/L PSE HandbooK 


The EXECUTIVE compiler option enables processing of PRAGMA 
EXECUTIVE and allows WITH of units compiled with the RTE_ONLY 
option. If NO_EXECUTIVE is specified on the command line, the 
pragma will be ignored and will have no effect on the generated 
code. 

The DEBUG compiler option enables processing of PRAGMA DEBUG 
to provide debugging support. If NO_DEBUG is specified, the 
DEBUG pragmas shall have no effect. Program units containing 
DEBUG pragmas and compiled with the DEBUG compiler option may be 
linked with program units containing DEBUG pragmas and compiled 
with the NO_bEBUG option; only those program units compiled with 
the /DEBUG option shall have additional DEBUG support. 

The /MEASURE compiler option enables run-time calls to 
Run-Time Performance Measurement Aids (RTAids) to record the 
entrance into all subprograms whose bodies are in the 
compilation. Program units compiled with the /MEASURE option may 
be linked with program units not compiled with the /MEASURE 
option; at run-time, only those subprograms in program units 
compiled with the /MEASURE option shall have this additional 
MEASURE support.

F.2 Pragmas 

Both implementation-defined and Ada language-defined pragmas 
are provided by all ALS/N compilers. These paragraphs describe 
the pragmas recognized and processed by the Ada/L compiler. The 
syntax defined in Section 2.8 of the Ada Language Reference 
Manual allows a pragma as the only element in a compilation unit, 
before a compilation unit, at defined places within a compilation 
unit, or following a compilation unit. Ada/L associates pragmas 
with compilation units as follows: 

a. If a pragma appears before any compilation unit in a 
compilation, it will affect all following compilation units, 
as specified below and in section 10.1 of the Ada Language 
Reference Manual. 

b. If a pragma appears inside a compilation unit, it will be 
associated with that compilation unit, and with the listings 
associated with that compilation unit, as described in the 
Ada Language Reference Manual, or below. 

c. If a pragma follows a compilation unit, it will be associated 
with the preceding compilation unit, and effects of the 
pragma will be found in the container of that compilation 
unit and in the listings associated with that container. 

The pragmas MEMORY_SIZE, STORAGEJJHIT, and SYSTEM_NAME are 
described in Section 13.7 of the Ada”Language Reference Manual. 
They may appear only at the start of the first compilation when 
creating a program library. In the ALS/N, however, since program 
libraries are created by the Program Library Manager and not by 
the compiler, the use of these pragmas is obviated. If they 
appear anywhere, a diagnostic of severity level WARNING is 
generated.

F.2.1 Language-IDefined Pragmas 

The following notes specify implementation-specific changes 
to those pragmas described in Appendix B of the Ada Language 
Reference Manual. CJnmentioned pragmas are implemented as defined 
in the Ada Language Reference Manual. 

pragma INLINE (arg {,arg}); 

The arguments designate subprograms. There are three 
instances in which the INLINE pragma is ignored. Each 
of these cases produces a warning message which states 
that the INLINE did not occur. 

a. If the compilation unit containing the INLINEd 
subprogram depends on the compilation unit of its 
caller, a routine call is made instead. 

b. If the INLINEd subprogram's compilation unit 
depends on the compilation unit of its caller (a 
routine call is made instead). 

c. If an immediately recursive subprogram call is made 
within the body of the INLINEd subprogram (the 
pragma INLINE is ignored entirely). 

pragma INTERFACE {language_name, subprogram_name)? 

The language_name specifies the language and type of 
interface to be used in calls used to the externally 
supplied subprogram specified by subprogram_name. The 
allowed values for language name are MACRO^NORMAL and 
MACRO_QUICK. MACRO_NORMAL Indicates that parameters 
will be passed on the stack and the calling conventions 
used for normal Ada subprogram calls will apply. 

MACRO_QUICK is used in RTLIB routines to indicate that 
parameters are passed in registers. See Section 7 
"Parameter Passing" for details on the space required 
to pass various types of parameters. 

You must ensure that an assembly-language body 
container will exist in the program library before 
linking.

pragma OPTIMIZE (arg); 

The argument is either TIME or SPACE. If TIME is 
specified, the optimizer concentrates on optimizing 
code execution time. If SPACE is specified, the 
optimizer concentrates on optimizing code size. The 
default is If the OPTIMIZE option is enabled and pragma 
OPTI.MIZE is not present, global optimization is still 
performed with the default argument, SPACE. Program 
units containing OPTIMIZE pragmas and compiled wioh the 
OPTIMIZE option may be linked with program units 
containing OPTIMIZE pragmas and compiled with the 
NO_OPTIMIZE option; but only those program units 
compiled with the OPTIMIZE option will have global 
optimization support. 

pragma PRIORITY 

The argument is an integer static expression in the 
range 0..15, where 0 is the lowest use-specifiable task 
priority and 15 is the highest. If the value of the 
argument is out of range, the pragma will have no 
effect other than to generate a WARNING diagnostic. A 
value of zero will be used if priority is not defined. 
The pragma will have no effect when not specified in a 
task (type) specification or the outermost declarative 
part of a subprogram. If the pragma appears in the 
declarative part of a subprogram, it will have no 
effect unless that subprogram is designated as the main 
subprogram at link time. 

pragma SUPPRESS (arg {,arg}); 

This pragma ’S unchanged with the following exceptions: 

Sk^ppression of OVERFLOW_^CHECK applies only to integer 
-'perations; and PRAGMA SUPPRESS has effect only within 
the compilation unit in which it appears, except that 
suppression of ELABORATION_CHECK applied at the 
declaration of a subprogram or task unit applies to all 
calls or activations.

F.2.2 Implementation-Defined Pragmas 

This paragraph describes the use and meaning of those pragmas 

recognized by Ada/L which are not specified in Appendix B of rhe 

Ada Language Reference Manual. 

pragma DEBUG; 

This pragma enables the inclusion of full symbolic 
information and support for the Embedded Target 
Debugger. The DEBUG PRAGMA is enabled by the /DEBUG 
command line option and has no effect if this option is 
not provided. This pragma must appear within a 
compilation unit, before the first declaration or 
statement. 

pragma EXECUTIVE [(arg)]; 

This pragma allows you to specify that a compilation 
un t is to run in the executive state of the machine 
and/or utilize privileged instructions. The pragma has 
no effect if the Compiler option NO_EXECUTIVE is 
enabled, either explicitly or by default. 

If PRAGMA EXECUTIVE is specified without an argument, 
executive state 's in effect for the compilation unit 
and the code generator does not generate privileged 
instructions for the compilation unit. If PRAGMA 
EXECUTIVE (INHERIT) is specified, a subprogram in the 
compilation unit inherits the state of its caller and 
the code generator does not generate privileged 
instructions for the compilation unit. If PRAGMA 
EXECUTIVE (PRIVILEGED) is specified, the executive 
state is in effect and the code generator may generate 
privileged instructions for the compilation unit. 

Currently, the Ada/L compiler does not generate such 
instructions. In the absence of PRAGMA EXECUTIVE, the 
compilation unit executes in task state and the code 
generator does not generate privileged instructions. 

If rRAGMA EXECUTIVE (INTERRUPT_CMR) is specified, the 
Ada/L compiler generates code which uses executive 
state registers i .stead of task state "egisters (i.e. 

SCI instead of SCT). 

PRAGMA EXECUTIVE is applied once per compilation unit, 
so its scope is the entire compilation unit. PRAGMA 
EXECUTIVE may appear between the context clause and the 
outermost unit. If there is no context clause, PRAGMA 
EXECUTIVE must appear within that unit before the first 
declaration or statement. The placement of the pragma 
before the context clause has no effect on a.iy or all 
following compilation units. If PRAGMA EXECuTIVE 
appears in the specification of a compilation unit, it 


F-06 


F.2.2 Implementation-Defined Pragmas 



Ada/L PSE Handbook 


Vers;.on 2.5 
29 March 1991 


must also appear in the body of that unit, and vice 
versa. If the pragma appears in a specification but is 
absent from the body, you are warned and the pragma is 
effective. If the pragma appears in the body of a 
compilation unit, but is absent from the corresponding 
specification, you are warned and the pragma has no 
effect. PRAGMA EXECUTIVE does not propagate to 
subunits. If a subunit is compiled without PRAGMA 
EXECUTIVE and the parent of the subunit is compiled 
with PRAGMA EXECUTIVE, you are warned and PRAGMA 
EXECUTIVE has no effect on the subunit. 

pragma FAST_INTERRUPT_ENTRY (entry_name, IMMEDIATE); 

This pragma provides for situations of high interrupt 
rates with simple processing per interrupt, (such as 
adding data to a buffer), and where complex processing 
occurs only after large numbers of these interrupts 
(such as when the buffer is full). This allows for 
lower overhead and faster response capability by 
restricting you to disciplines that are commensurate 
with limitations normally found in machine level 
interrupt service routine processing. 

pragma MEASURE (extraction_set, [arg {,arg}]); 

This pragma enables one or more performance measurement 
features. Pragma MEASURE specifies a user-defined 
extraction set for the Run-Time Performance Measurement 
Aids and Embedded Target Profiler. The user-defined 
extraction set consists of all occurences pragma 
MEASURE throughout the program. Extraction_set is a 
numeric literal, which is an index into a user-supplied 
table. Arg is a v«;.riable or a list of variables whose 
values are reported at this point in the execution. 
These values describe the nature (TYPE) of the values 
collected to an independent data reduction program. 
Pragma MEASURE is enabled by the /MEASURE command line 
option and has no effect if this option is not 
provided. This pragma should be applied to a package 
body rather than a package specification. 

pragma STATIC (INTERRUPT__HANDLER_TASK) ; 

The pragma STATIC is only allowed immediately after the 
declaration of a task body containing an immediate 
interrupt entry. The argument is 

INTERRUPT_HANDLER_TASK. The effect of this pragma will 
be to allow generation of nonreentrant and nonrecursive 
code in a compilation unit, and to allow static 
allocation of all data in a compilation unit. This 
pragma shall be used to allow for procedures within 
immediate (fast) interrupt entries. The effect will be 


F.2.2 Implementation-Defined Pragmas 


F-07 






Version 3.5 
29 March 1991 


Ada/L PSE HandbooK 


for the compiler to generate nonreentrant code for the 
affected procedure bodies. If a STATIC procedure is 
called recursively, the program is erroneous. 

pragma TITLE (arg); 

This is a listing control pragma. It takes a single 
argument of type string. The string specified will 
appear on the second line of each page of the source 
listing produced for the compilation unit within which 
It appears. The pragma should be the first lexical 
unit to appear within a compilation unit (excluding 
comments). If it is not, a warning message is issued. 

pragma TRIVIAL_ENTRy (NAME: entry_simple_name); 

This pragma is only allowed within a task specification 
after an entry declaration and identifies a 
Trivial_Entry to the system. A trivial entry 
represents a synchronization point, contained in a 
normal Ada task, for rendezvous with a fast interrupt 
entry body. The body of a trivial entry must be null. 

pragma UNMAPPED (arg {,arg}); 

The effect of this pragma is for unmapped (i.e., not 
consistently mapped within the virtual space) 
allocation of data in a compilation unit. The 
arguments of this pragma are access types to be 
unmapped. If a program tries to allocate more UNMAPPED 
space than is available in the physical configuration, 
STORAGE_ERROR will be raised at run-time. PRAGMA 
UNMAPPED must appear in the same declarative region as 
the type and after the type declaration.

P.2.3 Scope of Pragmas 

The scope for each pragma previously described as differing 

from rhe Ada Language Reference Manual is given below: 

DEBUG Applies to the compilation unit in which the pragma 

appears. 

EXECUTIVE Applies to the compilation unit in which the pragm.a 
appears, i.e., to all subprograms and tasks within 
the unit. Elaboration code is not affected. 

The pragma is not propagated from specifications 
to bodies, or from bodies to subunits. The pragma 
must appear consistently in the specification, 
body, and subunits associated with a library unit. 

fast_:nterrupt_entry 

Applies to the compilation unit in which the pragma 
appears. 

INLINE Applies only to subprogram names in its 

arguments. If the argument is an overloaded 
subprogram name, the INLINE pragma applies to 
all definitions of that subprogram name which 
appear in the same declarative part as the 
INLINE pragma. 

INTERFACE Applies to all invocations of the named 
imported subprogram. 

MEASURE No scope, but a WARNING diagnostic is 

generated. 

MEMORY_SIZE No scope, but a WARNING diagnostic is 
generated. 

OPTIMIZE Applies to the entire compilation unit in 

which the pragma appears. 

PRIORITY Applies to the task specification in which it 

appears, or to the environment task if it 
appears in the main subprogram. 

STATIC Applies to the compilation unit in which the pragma 

appears. 

STORAGE_UNIT No scope, but a WARNING diagnostic is 
generated. 

SUPPRESS Applies to the block or body that contains 

the declarative part in which the pragma 
appears.

P.6 Declaration and Representation Restrictions 

Declarations are described in Section 3 of the Ada Language 
Reference Manual, and representation specifications are described 
in Section 13 of the Ada Language Reference Manual and discussed 
here. 


In the following specifications, the capitalized word SIZE 
indicates the number of bits used to represent an object of the 
type under discussion. The upper case symbols D, L, R, 
correspond to those discussed in Section 3.5.9 of the Ada 
Language Reference Manual. 


F.6.1 Integer Types 

Integer types are specified with constraints of the form: 
RANGE L..R 


where: 


R <= SYSTEM.MAX_INT & L >= SYSTEM.MIN_INT 

For a prefix "t" denoting an integer type, length specifications 
of the form: 

FOR t’SIZE USE n ; 

may specify integer values n such that n in 2..64, 

R <= 2**(n-l)-l & L >= >(2**(n-l)-l) 
or else such that 

R <= (2**n)-l & L >= 0 
and 1 < n <= 31. 

For a stand-alone object of integer type, a default SIZE of 32 is 
used when; 

R <» 2**31 - 1 4 L >= -(2**31 - 1) 

Otherwise, a SIZE of 64 is used. 

For components of integer types within packed composite 
objects, the smaller of the default stand-alone SIZE and the SIZE 
from a length specification is used. 


F-18

P.6.2 Floating Types 

Floating types are specified with constraints of the form: 
DIGITS D 

where D is an integer in the range 1 through 15. 

For a prefix "t" denoting a floating point type, length 
specifications of the form: 

FOR t’SIZE USE n; 

are permitted only when the integer value n = 32 for D <= 6 or N 
= 64 for 7 <= D <= 15. 


F.6.3 Fixed Types 

Fixed types are specified with constraints of the form: 
DELTA D RANGE L..R 


where: 


MAX (ABS(R), ABS{L)) 

- <= 2**31 - 1. 

actual delta 

The actual delta defaults to the largest integral power of 2 less 
than or equal to the specified delta D. (This implies that fixed 
values are stored right-aligned.) 

For fixed point types, length specifications of the form: 
for T'SIZE use N; 

are permitted o.^ly when N in 1 .. 32, if: 

R - actual delta <= 2**(N-1)-1 * actual delta, and 
L + actual~delta >= -2**(n-l) * actual)3elta 


or 


R - actual_delta <= 2**{N)-1 * actual_deltc, and 
L >= 0 


F.6.3 Fixed Types 


F-19 




Version 3.5 
29 March i991 


Ada/L PSE Handbook 


For stand-alone objects of fixed point type, a default size of 32 
is used. For components of fixed point types within packed 
composite objects, the size from the length specification will be 
used. 

For specifications of the form: 

FOR t'SMALL USE n; 

are permitted for any value or X, such that X <= D. X must be 
specified eioher as a base 2 value or as a base 10 value. Note 
that when X is specified as ocher chan a power of 2, actual_delta 
will still be the largest ir.tegreal power of two less chan X. 


F.6.4 Enumeration Types 

In the absence of a representation specification for an 
enumeration type "t," the internal representat-on of t'FIRST is 
0. The cafault size for a stand-alone object of enumeration type 
"t" is 32, so the internal representations of c’FIRST and t'LAST 
both fall within the range: 

-( 2**31 - 1) .. 2**31 - 1. 

For enumeratio.i types, length specifications of the form: 

FOR t'SIZE USE n; 

and/or enumeration representations of the form: 

FOR t USE <aggregate>; 

a-e permitted for n in 2.-32, provided the representations 
and the SIZE conform to the relationship specified above. 

Or else for n in 1..32, is supported for enumeration 
types and provides an internal representation of; 

t'FIRST >= 0 .. t'LAST <= 2**(t'SIZE) - 1. 

For components of enumeration types within packed composite 
objects, the smaller of the default stand-alone SIZE or the SIZE 
from a length specification is used. 

Enumeration representations for types derived from the 
predefined type STANDARD.BOOLEAN will not be accepted, but length 
specifications will be accepted.

P.6.5 Access Types 

For access type, "t," length specifications of the form: 

FOR t’SIZE USE n; 

will not affect the runtime implementation of "t," therefore n = 
32 is the only value permitted for SIZE, which is the value 
returned by the attribute. 

For collection size specifications of the form: 

FOR t'STORAGE_SIZE USE n; 

for any value of "n" is permitted for STORAGE_SIZE (and that 
value will be returned by the attribute call). The collection 
size specification will affect the implementation of "t" and its 
collection at runtime by limiting the number of objects for type 
"t" that can be allocated. 

The value of t'STORAGE_SIZE for an access type "t" specifies 
the maximum number of storage_units used for all objects in the 
collection for type "t." This includes all space used by the 
allocated objects, plus any additional storage required to 
maintain the collection. 


F.6.6 Arrays and Records 

For arrays and records, a length specification of the form: 

FOR t'size USE n; 

m.ay cause arrays and records to be packed, if required, to 
accommodate the length specification. If the size specified is 
not large enough to contain any value of the type, a diagnostic 
message of severity ERROR is generated. 

The PACK pragma may be used to minimize wasted space between 
components of arrays and records. The pragma causes the type 
representation to be chosen such that the storage space 
requirements are minimized at the possible expense of data access 
time and code space. 

A record type representation specification may be used to 
describe the allocation of components in a record. Bits are 
numbered 0..31 from the right. Bit 32 starts at the right of the 
next higher numbered word. Each location specification must 
allow at least n bits of range, where n is large enough to hold 
any value of the subtype of the component being allocated. 
Otherwise, a diagnostic message of severity ERROR is generated. 
Components that are arrays, records, tasks, or access variables 
may not be allocated to specified locations. If a specification 


F.6.6 Arrays and Records 


F-21 



Version 3.5

Ada/L ?SE HandbooK 


of this form is entered, a diagnostic message of severity ERROR 
is generated. 

For records, an alignment clause of the form: 

AT MOD n 

specify alignments of 1 word (word alignment) or 2 words 
(doubleword alignment). 

If it is determinable at compile time that the SIZE of a 
record or array type or subtype is outside the range of 
STANDARD.INTEGER, a diagnostic of severity WARNING is generated. 
Declaration of such a type or subtype would raise NUMERIC_ERROR 
when elaborated. 


F.6.7 Other Length Specifications 

Length Specifications are described in Section 13.2 of the 
Ada Language Reference Manual. 

A length specification for a task type "t," of the form; 

FOR t’STORAGE_SIZE USE n; 

specifies the number of SYSTEM.STCRAGE_UNITS that are allocated 
for the execution of each task object of type "t." This includes 
the runtime stack for the task object but does not include 
objects allocated at runtime by the task object. If a 
t'STORAGE_SIZE is not specified for a task type "t," the default 
value is 2K (words). 

A length specification for a task type "t" of the form; 

FOR t'SIZE USE n; 
is allowable only for n = 32.

F.7 Systea Generated Names 

Refer to Section 13.7 of the Ada Language Reference Manual 
and the section above on the Predefined Language Environment for 
a discussion of package SYSTEM. 

The system name is chosen based on the target(s) supported, 
but it cannot be changed. In the case of Ada/L, che system name 
is ANUYK43. 


F.8 Address Clauses 

Refer to Section 13.5 of the Ada Language Reference Manual 
for a description of address clauses. All rules and restrictions 
described there apply. In addition, the following restrictions 
apply. 

An address clause may designate a single task entry. Such an 
address clause is allowed only within a task specification 
compiled with the EXECUTIVE compiler option. The meaningful 
values of the simple_expression are the allowable interrupt entry 
addresses as defined in Table F-1. The use of other values will 
result in the raising of a PROGRAM_ERROR exception upon creation 
of the task. 

If more than one task entry is equated to the same interrupt 
entry address, the most recently executed interrupt entry 
registration permanently overrides any previous registrations. 

At most one address clause is allowed for a single task 
entry. Specification of more than one interrupt address for a 
task entry is erroneous. 

Address clauses for objects and code other than task entries 
are allowed by the Ada/L target, but they have no effect beyond 
changing the value returned by the 'ADDRESS attribute call.

F.ll Input/Output 

Refer to Section 14 of the Ada Language Reference Manual for 
a discussion of Ada Input/Output and to Section 12 of the Ada/L 
Run Time Environment Handbook for more specifics on the Ada/L 
Input/Output subsystem. 

The Ada/L Input/Output subsystem orovides the following 
packages: TEXT_IO, SEQUENTIAL_IO, DIRECT_IO, and LOW_LEVEL_IO. 
These packages execute in the context of the user-written Ada 
program task making the I/O request. Consequently, all of the 
code that processes an I/O request on behalf of the user-written 
Ada program executes sequentially. The package IO_EXCEPTIONS 
defines all of the exceptions needed by the packages 
SEQUENTIAL_IO, DIRECT_IO, and TEXT_IO. The specification of this 
package is given in Section 14.5 of the Ada Language Reference 
Manual. This package is visible to all of the constituent 
packages of the Ada/L I/O subsystem so that appropriate exception 
handlers can be inserted. 

I/O in Ada/L is performed solely on external files. No 
allowance is provided in the I/O subsystem for memory resident 
files (i.e., files which do not reside on a peripheral device). 
This is true even in the case of temporary files. With the 
external files residing on the peripheral devices, Ada/L makes 
the further restriction on the number of files that may be open 
on an individual peripheral device. 

Section 14.1 of the Ada Language Reference Manual states that 
all I/O operations are expressed as operations on objects of some 
file type, rather than in terms of an external file. File 
objects are implemented in Ada/L as access objects which point to 
a data structure called the Pile Control Block. This File 
Control Block is defined internally to each of the high-level I/O 
packages; its purpose is to represent an external file. The File 
Control Block contains all of the I/O-specific information about 
an external file needed by the high-level I/O packages to 
accomplish requested I/O operations. 


F.11.1 Maaing External Files 

The naming conventions for external files in Ada/L are of 
particular importance to you. All of the system-dependent 
information needed by the I/O subsystem about an external file is 
contained in the file name. External files may be named using 
one of three file naming conventions; standard, temporary, and 
user-derived. 


F.11.1 Naming External Files 


F-27 




Version 3.5 
29 March 1991 


Ada/L PSE Handbook 


F.11.1.1 Standard Pile Names 

The standard external file naming convention used in Ada/L 
identifies the specific location of the external file in terms of 
the physical device on which it is stored. For this reason, you 
should"be aware of the configuration of the peripheral devices on 
the AN/UYK-43 at your particular site. 

Standard file names consist of a six character prefix and a 
file name of up to twenty characters. The six character prefix 
has a oredefined format. The first and second characters must be 
either'"DK," "MT," or "tt," designating an AN/0YH-3(V) 

Recorder/Reproducer Set Magnetic Disk, the RD-358 Magnetic Tape 
Subsystem, or the AN/USQ-69 Data Terminal Set, respectively. 

The third and fourth characters specify the channel on which 
the peripheral device is connected. Since there are sixty-four 
channels on the AN/UYK-43, the values for the third and fourth 
positions must lie in the range "00" to "63." 

The range of values for the fifth position in the prefix (the 
unit number) depends upon the device specified by the characters 
in the first and second positions of the external file name. If 
the specified peripheral device is the AN/UYH-3 magnetic disk 
drive, the character in the fifth position must be one of the 
characters "0," "1," "2," or "3." This value determines which of 
the four disk units available on the AN/UYH-3 is to be accessed. 

If the specified peripheral device is the RD-358 magnetic tape 
drive, the character in the fifth position must be one of the 
characters "0," "1," "2," or "3." This value determines which of 
the four tape units available on the RD-358 is to be accessed. 

If the specified peripheral device is the AN/USQ-69 militarized 
display terminal, the character in the fifth position depends on 
the channel type. If the channel type is parallel then this 
character mu®.*" he a "O." This is the only allowable value for 
the unit number when the AN/USQ-6i» is connected to a parallel I/O 
channel. This is because the AN/USQ-69 may have only one unit on 
a parallel channel. If the channel type is serial then the 
character in the fifth position must be one of the characters 
"0," "1," "2,” "3,” "4," "5," ”6,” "7," or "8" (the character "8" 
will be used to specify a broadcast mode transmission). The 
AN/USQ-69 allows up to eight terminals to be daisy chained 
together when running on a serial channel. 

The colon (":") is the only character allowed in the sixth 
position. If any character other than the colon is in this 
position, the file name will be considered non-standard and the 
file will reside on the default device defined during the 
elaboration of CONFIGURE_IO. 

Positions seven through twenty—six are optional to your Ada 
program and may be used as desired. These positions may contain 
any printable character you choose in order to make the file name 


F-28 


F.11.1.1 Standard File Names 



Ada/L PSE Handboolc 


Version 3.5 
29 March 1991 


more intelligible. Embedded blanks, however, are not allowed. 

The location of an external file on a peripheral device is 
thus a function of the first six characters of the file name 
regardless of the characters that might follow. For example, if 
the external file "MTOOO :01d_Data'* has been created and not 
subsequently closed, an attempt to create the external file 
’’MTOOO :New_Data" will cause the exception DEVICE_ERROR (rather 
than NAME_ERROR or USE_ERROR) to be raised because the peripheral 
device on channel "00" and cartridge "0" is already in use. 

Y’ou are advised that any file name beginning with "xxxxx:" 
(where x denotes any printable character) is assumed to be a 
standard external file name. If this external file name does not 
conform to the Ada/L standard file naming conventions, the 
exception NAME_ERROR will be raised. 


F.11.1.2 Temporary File Names 

Section 14.2.1 of the Ada Language Reference Manual defines a 
temporary file to be an external file that is not accessible 
after completion of the main subprogram. If the null string is 
supplied for the external file name, the external file is 
considered temporary. In this case, the high level I/O packages 
internally create an external file name to be used by the lower 
level I/O packages. The internal naming scheme used by the I/O 
subsystem is a function of the type of file to be created (text, 
direct or sequential) and the current date and time. This scheme 
is consistent with the requirement specified in the Ada Language 
Reference Manual that all external file names be unique. 

The first two characters of the file name are "TX," "D_," or 
"S__." The next eight characters are the date (four characters 
for the year, two characters for the month, and two characters 
for the day). The remaining ten characters are the time (five 
for seconds and five for the fraction part of a second). For 
instance, the temporary external file name "D_198803311234598765" 
would be a DIR£CT_IO file created March 31, 1988 at 12,345.98765 
seconds. 


F.11.1.3 User-Derived File Names 

A random string containing a sequence of characters of length 
one to twenty may also be used to name an external file. 

External files with names of this nature are considered to be 
permanent external files. You are cautioned from using names 
which conform to the scheme used by the I/O subsystem to name 
temporary external files (see list item "b"). 

It is not possible to associate two or more internal files 
with the same external file. The exception USE_ERROR will be 


F.11.1.3 User-Derived File Names

Ada/L PSE Handbook 


raised if this restriction is violated. 


P.11.2 The FORM Specification for External Files 

Section 14.2.1 of the Ada Language Reference Manual defines a 
string argument called the FORM, which supplies system-dependent 
information that is sometimes required to correctly process a 
request to create or open a file. In Ada/L, the string argument 
supplied to the FORM parameter on calls to CREATE and OPEN is 
retained while the file is open, so that calls to the function 
FORM can return the string to your Ada program. FORM options 
specified on calls to CREATE have the effects stated below. FORM 
options specified on calls to OPEN have no effect. 

Ada/L only allows a FORM parameter when a file is open or 
created on the RD-35S tape drive. A LISE_ERROR will be raised 
when a FORM parameter is associated with any other Ada/L system 
device. The FORM parameter specifically controls the positioning 
and formatting of the tape prior to tape I/O operations. This 
section identifies the arguments of the FORM parameter. Refer to 
Section 14.2.1 of the Ada Language Reference Manual and to 
Section 12 of the Ada/L Run-Time Environment Handbook for more 
detail on the use of the FORM parameter. 

The FOEIM parameter is a string literal of which a maximum of 
twenty characters is processed. If the supplied FORM string is 
longer than the maximum allowed (20 characters), the exception 
USE_ERROR will be raised. The string literal is interpreted as a 
sequence of arguments. If you wish to utilize the default 
arguments, a FORM parameter need not be supplied. 

Only the first two arguments within the string are processed. 
All tollowing characters or arguments will cause the USE_ERROR to 
be raised. The arguments are not case sensitive. The arguments 
must be separated by at least one delimiter. A legal delimiter 
consists of a comma or blank. Extra delimiters are ignored. Of 
the recognized arguments, at most one formatting and one 
positioning argument are allowed. If conflicting arguments are 
used, the exception USE_ERROR will be raised. 

Positioning arguments allow control of tape before its use. 
The following positioning arguments are available: 

a. REWIND - specifies that a rewind will be performed prior to 
the requested operation. 

b. NOREWIND - specifies that the tape remains positioned as is. 

c. APPEND - specifies that the tape be positioned at the logical 
end of tape (LEOT) prior to the requested operation. The 
LEOT is denoted by two consecutive tape_marks. 


F-30 


F.11.2 The FORM Specification for External Files 




Ada/L PSE Handbook 


Version 3.5 
29 March 1991 


The formatting argument specifies information about tape 
format. If a formatting argument is not supplied, the file is 
assumed to contain a format header record determined by the ALS/N 
I/O system. The following formatting arguments are available: 

a. NOHEAD - specifies that the designated file has no header 
record. This argument allows the reading and writing of 
tapes used on computer systems using different header 
formats. 

b. DENSITY_800 - specifies that the tape is written/read with a 
density of 800 BPI. This is the default density. Attempting 
to write/read files of different density on the same tape 
will cause unpredictable results. 

c. DENSITY_1600 - specifies that the tape is written/read with a 
density of 1600 BPI. Attempting to write/read files of 
different density on the same tape will cause unpredictable 
results. 


F.11.3 File Processing 

Processing allowed on Ada/L files is influenced by the 
characteristics of the underlying device. The following 
restrictions apply: 

a. Only one file may be open on an individual RD-358 tape drive 
at a time. 

b. The attempt to CREATE a file with the mode IN FILE is not 
supported since there will be no data in the Tile to read.

F.11.4 Text Input/Output 

TEXT^IO is invoked by your Ada program to perform sequential 
access ijo operations on text files (i.e., files whose content is 
in human-readable form). TEXT_IO is not a generic package and, 
thus, its subprograms may be invoked directly from your program, 
using objects wirh base type or parent type in the 
language-defined type character. TEXT_IO also provides the 
generic packages INTEGER_IO, FLOAT_IO, FIXED_IO, and 
SNUMERATION_IO for the reading and writing of numeric values and 
enumeration values. The generic packages within TEXT_IO require 
an instantiation for a given element type before any of their 
subprograms are invoked. The specification of this package is 
given in Section 14.3.10 of the Ada Language Reference Manual. 

The implementation-defined type COUNT that appears in Section 
14.3.10 of the Ada Language Reference Manual is defined as 
follows; 


type COUNT is range 0 ... INTEGER‘LAST; 

The implementation-defined subtype FIELD that appears in Section 
14.3.10 of the Ada Language Reference Manual is defined as 
follows: 


subtype FIELD is INTEGER range 0... INTEGER'LAST; 

At the beginning of program execution, the STANDARD_INPUT 
file and the STANDARD_OUTPUT file are open, and associated with 
the files specified by you at export time. Additionally, if a 
program terminates before an open file is closed (except for 
STANDARD_INPUT and STANDARD_OUTPUT), the last line you added to 
the file may be lost; if the file is on magnetic tape, the file 
structure on the tape may be inconsistent. 

A program is erroneous if concurrently executing tasks 
attempt to perform overlapping GET and/or PUT operations on the 
same terminal. The semantics of text layout as specified in the 
Ada Language Reference Manual, Section 14.3.2, (especially the 
concepts of current column number and current line) cannot be 
guaranteed when GET operations are interweaved with PUT 
operations. A program which relies on the semantics of text 
layout under those circumstances is erroneous. 

For TEXT_IO processing, the line length can be no longer than 
1022 characters. An attempt to set the line length through 
SET_LINE_LENGTH to a length greater than 1022 will result in 
USE ERROR.

Ada/L PSE Handbook 


Version 3.5 
29 March 1991 


F.11.5 Sequential Input/Output 

SEQUENTIAL_IO is invoked by your Ada program to perform I/O 
on the records of a file in sequential order. The SEQUENTIAL_I0 
package also requires a generic instantiation for a given element 
type before any of its subprograms may be invoked. Once the 
pacKage SEQUENTIAL_IO is made visible, it will perform any 
service defined by the subprograms declared in its specification. 
The specification of this package is given in Section ...4.2.3 of 
the Ada Language Reference Manual. 

The following restrictions are imposed on the use of the 
package SEQUENTIAL_IO: 

a. SEQUENTIAL_IO cannot be instantic^ted with an unconstrained 
array type. 

b. SEQUENTIAL_IO cannot be instantiated with a record type with 
discriminants wiuh no default values. 

c. Ada/L does not raise DATA_ERROR on a read operation if the 
data input from the external file is not of the instantiating 
type (see the Ada Language Reference Manual, Section 14.2.2). 


F.11.6 Direct Input/Output 

DIRECT^IO is invoked by you Ada program to perr'-*m I/O of 
the records of a file in an arbitrary order. The package 
DIRECT_IO requires a generic instantiation for a given element 
type before any of its subprograms may be invoked. Once the 
package DIRECT_IO is made visible, it will perform any service 
defined by the subprograms declared in its specification. The 
specification of this package is given in Section 34.2.5 of the 
Ada Language Reference Manual. 

The following restrictions are imposed on the use of the 
package DIRECT_IO; 

a. DIRECT 10 cannot be instantiated with an unconstrained array 

type. 

b. DIRECT_IO cannot be instantiated with a record type with 
discriminants with no default values. 

c. Ada/L does not raise DATA_ERROR on a read operation if the 
data input from the external file is not of the instantiating 
type (see the Ada Language Reference Manual, Section l‘'.2.4).

P.11.7 Low Level Input/Outp*it 

LOW_LEVEL_IO is invoked by your Ada program to initiate 
physical operations on peripheral devices, and thus executes as 
part of a program task. Requests made to LOW_LEVEL_IO from your 
program are passed through the RTEXEC_GATEWAy to the channel 
programs in CHANNEL_IO. Any status check or result information 
IS tne responsioility of the invoking subprogram and can be 
ODtained f"om the subprogram RECEIVE_CONTROL within LOW_LEVEL_IO. 

The package LOW_LEVEL_IO allows your Ada program to send I/O 
commands to the I/O devices (using SEND_CONTROL) and to receive 
status information from the I/O devices (using RECEIVE_CONTROL). 

A program is erroneous if it uses LOW LEVEL_IO to access a device 
ihat is also accessed by high-level l7o packages such as 
SEQUENTIAL_IO and TEXT_IO. The following is excerpted from the 
package LOW_LEVEL_IO. 

SUBTYPE channel_range IS INTEGER RANGE 0..63; 

— Range of values allowed for channel number. 

SUBTYPE device_i,tr IS STRING; 

— To be passed to Cl-iANNEL_XO for future implementations 

— of logical path name. The string will be ignored until 

— loqicai path name support is added. 

SUBTYPE btc_int IS INTEGER RANGE 0..16383; 

— Passes transfer counts to/from IO_MANAGEMENT/RTEXEC. 

SUBTYPE io^functions IS INTEGER RANGE 0..20; 

— Specifies the I/O function to be performed by LOW LE’/EL_IO. 

— The following table shows the values associated with device 

— and device functions available.

F.13 Machine Code Insertions 

The Ada language permits machine code insertions as defined 
in Section 13.8 of the Ada Language Reference Manual. This 
section describes the specific details for writing machine code 
insertions as provided by the predefined package MACHINE_CODE. 

You may, if desired, include AN/UYK-43 instructions wichin an 
Ada program. This is done by including a procedure in the 
program which contains only record aggregates defining machine 
instructions. The package MACHINE_CODE, included in the system 
program library, contains type, record, and constant declarations 
which are used to form the instructions. Each field of the 
aggregate contains a field of the resulting machine instruction. 
These fields are specified in the order in which they appear in 
the actual instruction. Since the AN/UYK-43 has several 
different formats for instructions, package MACHINE_CODE defines 
different types for each of these formats. For each of the 
fields which must have a certain value for a given instruction 
(i.e,., part of the opcode), package MACHINE_CODE defines a 
constant to use for that field. 

The following procedure implements a floating point 
exponential. Note that this actual procedure would not be used, 
because package MATH^PACK implements the same operation in a more 
efficient manner. ”* 

with machine_code; use machine_code,* 
procedure floating_point_exponential 
(X : FLOAT; *” 

ex : OUT FLOAT) is 


BEGIN 

forraatl'(f_LA,1,3,6,0,0,0); 
— LA Al,B6+0 


formatV(f_FEX,l,f2 FEX,2,0,0,0,f6 FEX); 

“ FEX A1,A2“ 

formatl'(f=>f_SA,a=>2,k=>3,b»>6,i»>0,s=>0,y=>l); 
— SA A2,B6+1 

END; 


Note that either positional or names aggregates may be used. 
Whenever a field does not appear in the MACRO/L instruction, it 
must be filled in with 0, since no missing fields are allowed. 

For formatl instructions, when k=0, the s and y field are 
collapsed and used together. For your convenience, an additional 
record type, formatli, for immediate, can be used to define the s 
and y fields as a single 16-bit quantity. This quantity is 
defined as an unsigned integer, so if a negative number x is 
desired, one should instead put the number x + 65535.
