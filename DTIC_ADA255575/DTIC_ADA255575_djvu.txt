1.0 INTRODUCTION 

The Navy's traditional 'standard 
embedded computer' approach is no 
longer competitive or viable in the 
present and emerging computing 
resources environment. Rapidly 
changing commercially based standards 
and technologies permit more efficient 
and effective solutions to the full range 
of Navy computing resource 
requirements. Computing resources 
include the totality of computer 
equipment, computer data, computer 
programs, associated documentation, 
personnel, services, and support. 

The objective of the Next Generation 
Computer Resources (NGCR) program 
is to provide a new basis for the Navy's 
acquisition of computing resources to 
take better advantage of open system 
commercial advances and investments. 
We expect that this approach will result 
in reduced production costs; reduced 
operational and maintenance costs; 
minimized development, test and 
evaluation costs; and more effective 
system integration and upgrade. 

This report presents the status of the 
NGCR Program's Database Management 
System Standards Working Group 
(DBWG). It includes a brief background 
of the NGCR program, the organization 
of the DBWG, the issues currently 
under consideration by the DBWG, as 
well as the status and future plans of the 
Working Group. 


2.0 NGCR BACKGROUND 

The intent of the NGCR Program is to 
incorporate commercially based, widely 
accepted, nonproprietary interface 
standards into the acquisition and 
development processes of computing 
resources for new systems and the 
modernization of existing systems. The 
NGCR standardization efforts are in the 
areas of operating system, backplane, 
database, graphics, project support 
environments and networking. These 
commercially based standards will be 
adopted as formal military standards. 
Specific standards currently being 
adopted by the NGCR Program include 
the following: IEEE PI003 POSIX, ANSI 
X3T9.5 FDDI, and IEEE 896 Futurebus+. 
The NGCR Program will not establish 
strictly Navy standards, but will adopt 
standards that leverage the 
international and national standards 
bodies' work. 

The charter of the NGCR Program's 
DBWG is to establish an open, 
commercially based, nonproprietary set 
of standard database interfaces and 
services. These standards will be the 
result of the cooperative efforts of 
government, industry, and academia, 
and will be available for use in NGCR- 
based systems in the mid 1990s and 
beyond. The DBWG will adopt (or 
develop) reference model(s); identify 
military systems' database interface 
requirements; identify capabilities of 
existing and evolving database interface 
standards, implementations, and 


t 




technology; determine the applicability 
of identified and projected capabilities to 
the requirements; and recommend a set 
of database interface standards to the 
Program Office (SPAWAR 231) for 
military standardization. 

3.0 DBWG ORGANIZATION 

Essentially, the DBWG will determine 
the requirements, evaluate the available 
standards in terms of the requirements 
and select a standard for adoption. The 
DBWG is comprised of three subgroups 
that perform the various tasks required 
to fulfill the working group's charter. 
These are the Requirements Subgroup, 
Current Standards and Available 
Technologies Subgroup, and the 
Approach Subgroup. 

3.1 Requirements Subgroup 

The DBWG Requirements Subgroup 
will identify the requirements for the 
NGCR database management systems 
and support the selection and 
adaptation of database interface 
standards. The Subgroup will examine 
current Navy and commercial database 
system functions, performance 
requirements, security requirements, as 
well as the hardware, software, and 
language interface issues. 

3.2 Current Standards and Available 
Technology Subgroup 

The DBWG Current Standards and 
Available Technology Subgroup will 
examine the incorporation of the 
current and evolving database interfaces 
and services into the NGCR database 


interface standards. In addition to 
identifying issues associated with 
existing and evolving database 
management systems functions and 
interfaces, this Subgroup will also 
evaluate existing and evolving 
technologies relative to the criteria for 
NGCR. Additionally, the group will 
consider the existing and potential 
testing and benchmark technologies. 

3.3 Approach Subgroup 

The DBWG Approach Subgroup will 
define the process for establishing a 
family of NGCR database interface 
standards. This activity includes 
identifying the process for industry and 
Navy cooperation in defining standard 
database interfaces and services. The 
group will adopt or adapt a 
representative model of existing 
database management systems 
architectures. This Subgroup will also 
define the procedures for comparing 
identified database management 
systems' elements against identified 
NGCR database requirements. 

4.0 DBWG ISSUES 

Currently, the DBWG has a number of 
issues under considerate jn. Resolution 
of these issues will facilitate the 
eventual selection of the database 
management system interface standard. 

4.1 Areas for Standardization 

Below are some potential areas for 
standardization, along with existing 






standards or standards efforts in those Other types of standards include the 
areas. following: 


Database Language: SQL 
Data Interchange formats: 

Data Representations: EDI, EDIF, ODA, 
PDES/STEP, ODIF 
Data Access Protocol: RDA 
Transaction Processing languages: 

POSIX, X3T5 Transaction Processing 
Data Repositories: IRDS, CIS, EIA CDIF 


4.2 Standards Hierarchy 

The primary goal of the NGCR Program 
is to select nonproprietary, 
commercially based standards. The 
objective, then, is to select standards at 
as high a level in the international 
standards hierarchy as possible, while 
still satisfying the program's goals. 

The following order of precedence exists 
when selecting interface, service, and 
protocol standards for the NGCR 
Program and the NGCR database 
interface standards. Table 1 describes 
the hierarchy of standardization, along 
with an example of a standards body for 
a given level. 


Table 1: Hierarchy of standards. 

Level Standards Bodies 


International 
U.S. National 
Industry 
Consortia 


ISO/IEC 
ANSI 
IEEE, EIA 

X/Open, SQL Access 


NIST Standards 
de facto Standards 
DoD Standards 
Navy Standards 

Consider the following example. SQL is 
an ISO International Standard (it is also 
an ANSI National Standard). An 
implementation of the SQL standard 
would be a relational database 
management system such as SYBASE or 
ORACLE. 


4.3 Products versus NGCR Standards 

Proprietary products are considered only 
as potential sources for development of 
interface standards. This is the case 
either in an area for which an existing 
standard effort cannot be identified (i.e., 
a gap), or for which an interface basis 
can be distilled from interfaces 
(implicitly) defined by the product. 


4.4 Interoperability 

Interoperability is the ability of multiple 
systems to exchange information (data) 
and to mutually use the exchanged 
information. (IEEE P1003.0 Draft 15, 
Guide to the POSIX Open Systems 
Environment.) 

The DBWG is concerned with the 
interoperability of a variety of different 
database platforms and systems. Many 
of the current standards bodies do not 
address the issue of interoperability 
between the various standards. The 


3 





DBWG recognizes the need to select 
standards that will ultimately lead to 
interoperability. 


4.5 Portability 

Portability refers to the ability to transfer 
software from one information system 
to another. (IEEE P1003.0 Draft 15, Guide 
to the POSIX Open Systems 
Environment.) 

From the Database Management System 
(DBMS) perspective, application 
portability refers to the ability to move 
application software from one DBMS to 
another DBMS with little or no change 
to the application code. 

The application program interface (API) 
is the interface between the application 
software and the application platform, 
across which all services are provided. 
The API is primarily in support of 
application portability, but system and 
application interoperability are also 
supported via the communications API. 
(IEEE PI 003.0 Draft 15, Guide to the 
POSIX Open Systems Environment.) 

When the DBMS is considered to be an 
application (to the operating system, 
network, etc.), then portability refers to 
the situation in which the DBMS can be 
move from system to system with little 
or no change to the DBMS software. 

If the NGCR DBWG concerns itself with 
the interface between the DBMS and the 
operating system, the DBWG needs to 
accommodate the DBMS related 
operating system requirements in 
POSIX, via the NGCR Operating System 


Standards Working Group. We need to 
determine whether the NGCR DBWG 
will focus on the operating system 
interface level. 

Figure 1. illustrates a possible 
implementation of the DBMS related 
APIs.

5.0 DBWG CURRENT STATUS AND 
FUTURE PLANS 

The DBWG membership currently 
consists of Navy laboratory and 


4 









operational personnel. The working 
group is evaluating the need for Navy 
standardization in the database interface 
area and will make recommendations to 
the Program Office by the end of fiscal 
year 1992. The current plan is to open 
the group to industry and academia in 
the early part of fiscal year 1993. 


5.1 Proposed Meeting Schedule 

The DBWG meets on a quarterly basis 
with the following proposed meeting 
schedule: 

October 27-28 (Navy only), Orlando, FL 
December 8-9, Silver Springs, MD 
February 9-11,1993, TBD
