CHAPTER 1 


INTRODUCTION 




This Validation Summary Report V'TSR) describes the extent to which a specific Ada compiler 
conforms to the Ada Standard, ANSI/MILrSTD-lSlSA. This report explains all technical terms 
used within it and thr wnnghly r eports the results of testing this compiler using the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability,'(ACVC).^ An Ada compiler must be implemented according to the Ada 
Standard, and any implementation-dependent features must conform to the requirements of the 
Ada Standard. The Ada Standard must be implemented in its entirety, and nothing can be 
implemented that is not in the Standard, 'j 


Even though all validated Ada compilers conform to the Ada Standard, it must be understood that 
some differences do exist between implementations. The Ada Standard permits some 
implementation dependencies - for example, the maximum length of identifiers or the maximum 
values of integer types. Other differences between compilers result from the characteristics of 
particular operating systems, hardware, or implementation strategies. All the dependencies 
observed during the process of testing this compiler are given in^this report. ) 

The information in this report is derived from the test results produced during validation testing. 
The validation process includes submitting a suite of standardized tests, the ACVC, as inputs to an 
Ada compiler and evaluating the results. ''The purpose of validating is to ensure conformity of the 
compiler to the Ada Standard by testing that the compiler properly implements legal language 
constructs and that it identifies and rejects illegal language constructs. The testing also identifies 
behavior that is implementation dependent, but is permitted by the Ada Standard. Six classes of 
tests are used. These tests are designed to perform checks at compile time, at link time, and 
during execution.

IT PURPOSE OF THIS VALIDATION SUMMARY REPORT 

This VSR documents the results of the validation testing performed on an Ada compiler. Testing 
was carried out for the following purposes: 

o To attempt to identify any language constructs supported by the compiler that do 
not conform to the Ada Standard 

o To attempt to identify any language constructs not supported by thr compiler but 
required by the Ada Standard 

o To determine that the implementation-dependent behavior is allowed by the Ada 
Standard 


Testing of this compiler was conducted by The National Computer Centre Limited according to 
procedures established by the Ada Joint Program Office and administered by the Ada Validation

INTRODUCTION 


The computer which executes the code generated by the compiler. 

A program that checks a compiler’s conformity regarding a 
particular feature or a combination of features to the Ada Standard. 
In the context of this report, the term is used to designate a single 
test, which may comprise one or more files. 

Withdrawn test An ACVC test found to be incorrect and not used to check 

conformity to the Ada Standard. A test may be incorrect because 
it has an invalid test objective, fails to meet its test objective, or 
contains illegal or erroneous use of the language. 


Target 

Test 


L5 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Conformity to the Ada Standard is measured using the ACVC. The ACVC contains both legal and 
illegal Ada programs structured into six test classes: A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a 
test name identifies the class to which it belong. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable, and 
special program units are used to report their results during execution. Class B tests are expected 
to produce compilation errors. Class L tests are expected to produce errors because of the way 
in which a program library is used at link time. 

Class A tests ensure the successful compilation and execution of legal Ada programs with certain 
language constructs which cannot be verified at run time. There are no explicit program 
components in a Class A test to check semantics. For example, a Class A test checks that reserved 
wor^ of another language (other than those already reserv^ in the Ada language) are not treated 
as reserved words by an Ada compiler. A Class A test is passed if no errors are detected at 
compile time and the program executes to produce a PASSED message. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class B tests are not executable. 
Each test in this class is compiled and the resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that 
every syntax or semantic error in the test is detected. A Class B test is passed if every illegal 
construct that it contains is detected by the compiler. 

Class C tests check the run time system to ensure that legal Ada programs can be correctly 
compiled and executed. Each Class C test is self-checking and produces a PASSED, FAILED, or 
NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result when it is executed. 

Class D tests check the compilation and execution capacities of a compiler. Since there are no 
capacity requirements placed on a compiler by the Ada Standard for some parameters - for 
example, the number of identifiers permitted in a compilation or the number of units in a library - 
- a compiler may refuse to compile a Class D test and still be a conforming compiler. Therefore, 
if a Class D test fails to compile because the capacity of the compiler is exceeded, the test is 
classified as inapplicable. If a Class D test compiles successfully, it is self-checking and produces 
a PASSED or FAILED message during execution.

INTRODUCTION 


Class E tests are expected to execute successfully and check implementation-dependent options and 
resolutions of ambiguities in the Ada Standard. Each Class E test is self-checking and produces 
a NOT APPLICABLE, PASSED, or FAILED message when it is compiled and executed. 
However, the Ada Standard permits an implementation to reject programs containing some features 
addressed by Class E tests during compilation. Therefore, a Class E test is passed by a compiler 
if it is compiled successfully and executes to produce a PASSED message, or if it is rejected by the 
compiler for an allowable reason. 

Class L tests check that incomplete or illegal Ada programs involving multiple, separately compiled 
units are detected and not allowed to execute. Class L tests are compiled separately and execution 
is attempted. A Class L test passes if it is rejected at link time - that is, an attempt to execute 
the main program must generate an error message before any declarations in the main program 
or any units referenced by the main program are elaborated. In some cases, an implementation 
may legitimately detect errors during compilation of the test. 

Two library units, the package REPORT and the procedure CHECK_FILE, support the self¬ 
checking features of the executable tests. The package REPORT provides the mechanism by which 
executable tests report PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE results. It also provides a set 
of identity functions used to defeat some compiler optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that 
would circumvent a ^est objective. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada Standard. The operation 
of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of executable tests. These tests produce 
messages that are examined to verify that the units are operating correctly. If these units are not 
operating correctly, then the validation is not attempted. 

The text of each test in the ACVC follows conventions that are intended to ensure that the tests 
are reasonably portable without modification. For example, the tests make use of only the basic 
set of 55 characters, contain lines with a maximum length of 72 characters, use small numeric 
values, and place features that may not be supported by all implementations in separate tests. 
However, some tests contain values that require the test to be customized according to 
implementation-specific values -• for example, an illegal file name. A list of the values used for 
this validation is provided in Appendix C. 

A compiler must correctly process each of the tests in the suite and demonstrate conformity to the 
Ada Standard by either meeting the pass criteria given for the test or by showing that the test is 
inapplicable to the implementation. The applicability of a test to an implementation is considered 
each time the implementation is validated. A test that is inapplicable for one validation is not 
necessarily inapplicable for a subsequent validation. Any test that was determined to contain an 
illegal language construct or an erroneous language construct is withdrawn fi'om the ACVC and, 
therefore, is not used in testing a compiler. The tests withdrawn at the time of this validation 
are given in Appendix D.

22 lMPI.Rf.4RNTATION CHARACTERISTICS 

One of the purposes of validating compilers is to determine the behavior of a compiler in those 
areas of the Ada Standard that permit implementations to differ. Class D and E tests specifically 
check for such implementation differences. However, tests in other classes also characterize an 
implementation. The tests demonstrate the following characteristics: 


a. Capacities. 

(1) The compiler correctly processes a compilation containing 723 variables in the 
same declarative part. (See test D29002K.) 


Vslidjitioii Somoisiy Report AVF-VSR-90502/68 

R R Software Ina Jmm/AdM Z13 386 to DOS Chapter 2 - Page 1 of S 





CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 



(2) 

The compiler correctly processes tests containing loop statements nested to 17 
levels. (See tests D55A03A..H (8 tests).) 


(3) 

The compiler rejects tests containing block statements nested to 65 levels. (See test 

D56001B.) 


(4) 

The compiler correctly processes tests containing recursive procedures separately 
compiled as subunits nested to six levels. (See tests D64005E..G (3 tests).) 

b. 

Predefined types. 


(1) 

This implementation supports the additional predefined types LONG_INTEGER, 
and LONG_FLOAT, in the package STANDARD. (See tests B86001T..Z (7 tests).) 

c. 

Expression evaluation. 


The order in which expressions are evaluated and the time at which constraints are checked 
are not defined by the language. While the ACVC tests do not specifically attempt to 
determine the order of evaluation of expressions, test results indicate the following; 


(1) 

None of the default initialization expressions for record components are evaluated 
before any value is checked for membership in a component’s subtype. (See test 

C32117A) 


(2) 

Assignments for subtypes are performed with the same precision as the base type. 

(See test C35712B.) 


(3) 

This implementation uses no extra bits for extra precision and uses no extra bits 
for extra range. (See test C35903A) 


(4) 

No exception is raised when an integer literal operand in a comparison or 
membership test is outside the range of the base type. (See test C45232A.) 


(5) 

No exception is raised when a literal operand in a fixed-point comparison or 
membership test is outside the range of the base type. (See test C45252A.) 


(6) 

Underflow is gradual. (See tests C45S24A.Z (26 tests).) 

d. 

Rounding. 


The method by which values are rounded in type conversions is not defined by the 
language. While the ACVC tests do not specifically attempt to determine the method of 
rounding, the test results indicate the following; 


(1) 

The method used for rounding to integer is round away from zero. (See tests 

C46012A.Z (26 tests).)

Chapter 2 - Page 2 of 5 






CONHCURATION INFORMATION 


(2) The method used for rounding to longest integer is round away from zero. (See 
tests C46012A..Z (26 tests).) 

(3) The method used for rounding to integer in static universal real expressions is 
round away from zero. (See test C4A014A) 


e. Array types. 

An implementation is allowed to raise NUMERIC_ERROR or CONSTRAINT_ERROR 

for an array having a ’LENGTH that exceeds STANDARD. INTEGER’LAST and/or 

SYSTEM.MAX_INT. For this implementation: 

(1) Declaration of an array type or subtype declaration with more than 
SYSTEM.MAX_INT components raises no exception. (See test C36003A.) 

(2) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised when ’LENGTH is applied to an array type with 
TNTEGER’LAST + 2 components. (See test C36202A.) 

(3) NUMERIC_ERROR is raised when ’LENGTH is applied to an array type with 
SYSTEM.MAX_INT + 2 components. (See test C36202B.) 

(4) A packed BOOLEAN array having a ’LENGTH exceeding INTEGER’LAST raises 
STORAGE_ERROR when the array objects are declared. (See test C52103X.) 

(5) A packed two-dimensional BOOLEAN array with more than INTEGER’LAST 
components raises CONSTRAINT_ERROR when the length of a dimension is 
calculated and exceeds INTEGER’LAST. (See test C52104Y.) 

(6) In assigning one-dimensional array types, the expression is evaluated in its entirety 
before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised when checking whether the expression’s 
subtype is compatible with the target’s subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

(7) In assigning two-dimensional array types, the expression is evaluated in its entirety 
before CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised when checking whether the expression’s 
subtype is compatible with the target’s subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

f. A null array with one dimension of length greater than INTEGER’LAST may raise 

NUMERIC_ERROR or CONSTRAINT_ERROR either when declared or assigned. 

Alternatively, an implementation may accept the declaration. However, lengths must match 

in array slice assignments. This implementation raises no reception. (See test ES2103Y.) 

g. Discriminated types.

CONFIGURATION INFORMATION 


(1) In assigning record types with discriminants, the expression is evaluated in its 
entirety before CONSTRAlNT_ERROR is raised when checking whether the 
expression’s subtype is compatible with the target’s subtype. (See test C52013A.) 

h. Aggregates. 

(1) In the evaluation of a multi-dimensional aggregate, the test results indicate that 
the order in which choices are evaluated and index subtype checks are made 
depends upon the aggregate itself. (See tests C43207A and C43207B.) 

(2) In the evaluation of an aggregate containing subaggregates, not all choices are 
evaluated before being checked for identical bounds. (See test E43212B.) 

(3) CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised after all choices are evaluated when a bound 
in a non-null range of a non-null aggregate does not belong to an index subtype. 
(See test E43211B.) 

i. Pragmas. 

(1) The pragma INLINE is not supported for functions or procedures. (See tests 
LA3CK)4A..B (2 tests), EA3004C..D (2 tests), and CA3004E..F (2 tests).) 

j. Generics. 

(1) Generic specifications and bodies can be compiled in separate compilations. (See 
tests CA1012A, CA2009C, CA2009F, BC3204C, and BC3205D.) 

(2) Generic subprogram declarations and bodies can be compiled in separate 
compilations. (See tests CA1012A and CA2009F.) 

(3) Generic library subprogram specifications and bodies can be compiled in separate 
compilations. (See test CA1012A.) 

(4) Generic non-library package bodies as subunits can be compiled in separate 
compilations. (See test CA2009C.) 

(5) Generic non-library subprogram bodies can be compiled in separate compilations 
from their stubs. (See test CA2009F.) 

(6) Generic unit bodies and their subunits can be compiled in separate compilations. 
(See test CA3011A.) 

(7) Generic package declarations and bodies can be compiled in separate compilations. 
(See tests CA2009C, BC3204C, and BC3205D.) 

(8) Generic library package specifications and bodies can be compiled in separate 
compilations. (See tests BC3204C and BC3205D.)

TEST INFORMATION 


CHAPTER 3 


TEST INFORMATION 


3T TEST RESULTS 

Version 1.10 of the ACVC comprises 3717 tests. When this compiler was tested, 44 tests had 
been withdrawn because of test errors. The AVF determined that 405 tests were inapplicable to 
this implementation. All inapplicable tests were processed during validation testing except for 201 
executable tests that use floating-point precision exceeding that supported by the implementation. 
Modifications to the code, processing, or grading for 39 tests were required to successfully 
demonstrate the test objective. (See section 3.6.) 

The AVF concludes that the testing results demonstrate acceptable conformity to the Ada Standard.

3.5 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 


Some tests do not apply to all compilers because they make use of features that a compiler is not 
required by the Ada Standard to support. Others may depend on the result of another test that 
is either inapplicable or withdrawn. TTie applicability of a test to an implementation is considered 
each time a validation is attempted. A test that is inapplicable for one validation attempt is not 
necessarily inapplicable for a subsequent attempt. For this validation attempt, 405 tests were 
inapplicable for the reasons indicated:

TEST INFORMATION 


3^ TEST. PROCESSING. AND EVALUATION MODIFICATIONS 

It is expected that some tests will require modiRcations of code, processing, or evaluation in order 
to compensate for legitimate implementation behaviour. Modifications are made by the AVF in 
cases where legitimate implementation behaviour prevents the successful completion of an 
(otherwise) applicable test. Examples of such modifications include: adding a length clause to alter 
the default size of a collection; splitting a Class B test into subtests so that all errors are detected; 
and confirming that messages produced by an executable test demonstrate conforming behaviour 
that was not anticipated by the test (such as raising one exception instead of another). 

Modifications were required for 39 tests. 

The following tests were split because syntax errors at one point resulted in the compiler not 
detecting other errors in the test:

The following tests were passed as a result of modification of code and/or evaluation criteria as 

follows: 

C34006D This test checks that a derived type inherits various properties from the parent; the 
’SIZE attribute is used in this test under assumptions that are not fully supported 
by the Ada standard, and are subject to ARG review. The test outputs 
"INCORRECT OBJECT ’SIZE" on execution. 

C39005A "PRAGMA ELABORATE (REPORT);" is needed between lines 17 and 18 to 
prevent "TEST" from raising PROGRAM_ERROR. 

CE2108A.B (2 tests) CE2108C..D (2 tests) CE3112A..B (2 tests) 

These tests have been modified by commenting out the lines in the second test of 
each of these three pairs that create a temporary file. The lines commented out 
were 45..64 in CE2108B, 45..64 in CE2108D and 40..48 in CE3112B. This ensures 
that a NEW temporary file is not generated with the same name as that generated 
in the 1st test. 

CC1223A The expression "2**TMANTISSA-1" on line 262 was changed to an equivalent form 
"(2**(T’MANTISSA-1)-1+2**(T’MANTISSA-1))" in order to avoid generating the

These tests have been modified to include initialisation of W (in its declaration,

ADDITIONAL TESTING INFORMATION 
3.7.1 Prevalidation 

Prior to validation, a set of test results for ACVC Version 1.10 produced by the Janus/Ada 2.13 
386 to DOS compiler was submitted to the AVF by the applicant for review. Analysis of these 
results demonstrated that the compiler successfully passed all applicable tests, and the compiler 
exhibited the expected behaviour on all inapplicable tests. 


3.7.2 Test Method 


Testing of the Janm/Ada 2.13 386 to DOS using ACVC Version 1.10 was conducted on-site by a 
validation team from the AVF. The configuration in which the testing was performed is described 
by the following designations of hardware and software components:

A set of floppy diskettes containing all tests except for withdrawn tests and tests requiring 
unsupported floating-point precisions was taken on-site by the validation team for processing. Tests 
that make use of implementation-specific values were customized before being written to the 
floppy diskettes. Tests requiring modifications during the prevalidation testing were not included 
in their modified form on the floppy diskettes. 


The contents of the floppy diskettes were loaded directly onto the host computer. 


After the test files were loaded to disk, the full set of tests was compiled and all executable tests 
were run on the BeU 386. Results were printed from the host computer.

TEST INFORMATION 


The compiler was tested using command scripts provided by R R Software Inc and reviewed by the 

validation team. The compiler was tested using all default option settings except for (he following; 

OPTION EFFECT 

/Q Quiet error messages - suppresses user prompting on errors. Necessary for running 

B-Tests; otherwise every error would have to be responded to. 

/W Warnings off - warnings were suppressed mainly because of the many confusing 

warnings the validation tests produce. Many validation tests have intentional errors 
(such as an expression which always raises an exception, use of null ranges, 
unreachable code, etc. The large volume of warnings produced made it difficult to 
grade the B-Tests in particular, so they were suppressed. 

/T Trimming code on - this directs the compiler to generate code which allows the 

linker to trim unused subprograms. This is necessary in order to have a few large 
tests be small enough to run. 


ID Debugging code off - this directs the compiler to not generate any debugging code 

(generally line numbers and waikbacks). This was also used to cut the space used 
by the tests. 

/BS Brief Statistics. This was also used to cut the amount of output produced by the 

compiler during compile time. 

/S? We used this option to re-direct the compiler scratch files into a RAM disk where 

possible (?is replaced by a drive letter), thus speeding up the compiles. 

Then, all of the non-B-Tests were linked with the options: 

/Q Quiet error messages - suppresses user prompting on errors. Necessaiy for running 

L-Tesis; otherwise every error would have to be responded to. 

yT Trim unused code - this option directs the linker to remove unused subroutines 

from the result file. This can make as much as a 30K space saving in the result 
file. 

/B Brief Statistics. This was also used to cut the amount of output produced by the 

Linker during compile time. 

/E Produce an .EXE file - this option directs the linker to produce an .EXE file rather 

than a .COM file; the .EXE file can contain more code. 

Tests were compiled, linked, and executed (as appropriate) using a single compuer. Test output, 

compilation listings, and job logs were captured on floppy diskettes and archived at the AVF. The 

listings examined on-site by the validation team were also archived.

Appendix F: Implemenlalion Dependencies 


F Implementation Dependencies 

This appendix specifies certain system-dependant characteristics of the Janus/Ada version 2.1.3 386 
to DOS compiler. 

F.l Implementation Dependent Pragmas 

In addition to the required Ada pragmas, Janus/Ada also provides several others. Some of these 
pragmas have a textual range. Such pragmas set some value of importance to the compiler, usually 
a flag that may be On or Off. The value to be used by the compiler at a given point in a program 
depends on the parameter of the most recent relevant pragma in the text of the program. For 
flags, if the parameter is the identifier On, then the flag is on; if the parameter is the identifier 
Off, then the flag is off; if no such pragma has occurred, then a default value is used. 

The range of a pragma - even a pragma that usually has a textual range - may vary if the pragma 
is not inside a compilation unit. This matters only if you put multiple compilation units in a file. 
The following rules apply: 

1) If a pragma is inside a compilation unit, it affects only that unit. 

2) If a pragma is outside a compilation unit, it affects all following compilation units 
in the compilation. 

Certain required Ada pragmas, such as INLINE, would follow different rules; however, as it turns 
out, Janus/Ada ignores all pragmas that would follow different rules. 

The following system-dependent pragmas are defined by Janus/Ada. Unless otherwise stated, they 
may occur anywhere that a pragma may occur. 

ALL_CHECKS Takes one of two identifiers On or Off as its argument, and has a textual 
range. If the argument is Off, then this pragma causes suppression of 
arithmetic checking (like pragma ARITHCHECK - see below), range 
checking (like pragma RANGECHECK - see below), storage error checking, 
and elaboration checking. If the argument is On, then these checks are all 
performed as usual. Note that pragma ALL_CHECKS does not affect the 
status of the DEBUG pragma; for the fastest run time code (and the worst 
run time checking), both ALL_CHECKS and DEBUG should be turned Off 
and the pragma OPTIMIZE (Time) should be used. Note also that 
ALL_CHECKS does not affect the status of the ENUMTAB pragma. 
Combining check suppression using the pragma ALL_CHECKS and using 
the pragma SUPPRESS may cause unexpected results; it should not be 
done. However, ALL_CHECKS may be combined with the Janus/Ada 
pragmas ARITHCHECK and RANGECHECK; whichever relevant pragma 
has occurred most recently will determine whether a given check is 
performed. ALL_CHECKS is on by default. Turning any checks off may 
cause unpredictable results if execution would have caused the corresponding 
assumption to be violated. Checks should be off only in fully debugged and 
tested programs. After checks are turned off, full testing should again be

Takes one of the two identifiers On or Off as its argument, and has a 
textual range. Where ARITHCHECK is on, the compiler is permitted to 
(and generally does) not generate checks for situations where it is permitted 
to raise NUMERIC_ERROR; these checks include overflow checking and 
checking for division by zero. Combining check suppression using the 
pragma ARITHCHECK and using the pragma SUPPRESS may cause 
unexpected results; it should not be done. However, ARITHCHECK may 
be combined with the Janus/Ada pragma ALL_CHECKS; whichever pragma 
has occurred most recently will be effective. ARITHCHECK is on by 
default. Turning any checks off may cause unpredictable results if execution 
would have caused the corresponding assumption to be violated. Checks 
should be off only in fully debugged and tested programs. After checks are 
turned off, full testing should again be done, since any program that handles 
an exception may expect results that will not occur if no checking is done. 

Takes an integer literal in the range 0 .. 3 as its argument, and has a textual 
range. Using this pragma allows the Janus/Ada run-time system to be less 
than meticulous atx)ut recovering temporary memory space it uses. This 
pragma can allow for smaller and faster code, but can be dangerous; certain 
constructs can cause memory to be used up very quickly. The smaller the 
parameter, the more danger is permitted. A value of 3 • the default value - 
causes the run-time system to be its usual immaculate self. A value of 0 
causes no reclamation of temporary space. Values of 1 and 2 allow 
compromising between "cleanliness" and speed. Using values other than 3 
adds some risk of your program running out of memory, especially in loops 
which contain certain constructs. 

Takes one of the two identifiers On or Off as its argument, and has a 
textual range. This pragma controls the generation of line number code and 
procedure name code. When DEBUG is on, such code is generated. When 
DEBUG is off, no line number code or procedure names are generated. 
This information is used by the walkback which is generated after a run¬ 
time error (e.g., an unhandled ^ception). The walkback is still generated 
when DEBUG is off, but the line numbers will be incorrect, and no 
subprogram names will be printed. DEBUG’s initial state can be set by 
the command line; if no explicit option is given, then DEBUG is initially 
on. Turning DEBUG off saves space, but causes the loss of much of 
Janus/Ada’s power in describing run time errors. 

Notes: 

DEBUG should only be turned off when the program has no errors. The 
information provided on an error when DEBUG is off is not very useful. 

If DEBUG is on at the beginning of a subprogram or package specification, 
then it must be on at the end of the specification. Conversely, if DEBUG 
is off at the beginning of such a specification, it must be off at the end. 
If you want DEBUG to be off for an entire compilation, then you can either

Appendix F; Implementation Dependencies 


put a DEBUG pragma in the context clause of the compilation or you can 
use the appropriate compiler option. 

ENUMTAB Takes one of the two identifiers On or Off as its argument, and has a 

textual range. This pragma controls the generation of enumeration tables. 
Enumeration tables are used for the attributes IMAGE, VALUE, and 
WIDTH, and hence to input and output enumeration values. The tables 
are generated when ENUMTAB is on. The state of the ENUMTAB flag 
is significant only at enumeration type definitions. If this pragma is used 
to prevent generation of a type’s enumeration tables, then using the three 
mentioned attributes causes an erroneous program, with unpredictable 
results; furthermore, the type should not be used as a generic actual discrete 
type, and in particular TEXT_IO.ENUMERATION_IO should not be 
instantiated for the type. If the enumeration type is not needed for any of 
these purposes, the tables, which use a lot of space, are unnecessary. 
ENUMTAB is on by default. 

PAGE_LENGTH This pragma takes a single integer literal as its argument. It says that a 
page break should be added to the listing after each occurrence of the given 
number of lines. The default page length is 32000, so that no page breaks 
are generated for most programs. Each page starts with a header that looks 
like the following: 

Janus/Ada Version 2.1.3 compiling file on date at time 

RANGECHECK Takes one of the two identifiers On or Off as its argument, and has a 
textual range. Where RANGECHECK is off, the compiler is permitted to 
(and generally does) not generate checks for situations where it is expected 
to raise CONSTRAINT_ERROR; these checks include null pointer 
checking, discriminant checking, index checking, array length checking, and 
range checking. Combining check suppression using the pragma 
RANGECHECK and using the pragma SUPPRESS may cause unexpected 
results; it should not be done. However, RANGECHECK may be combined 
with the Janus/Ada pragma ALL_CHECKS; whichever pragma has occurred 
most recently will be effective. RANGECHECK is on by default. Turning 
any checks off may cause unpredictable results if execution would have 
caused the corresponding assumption to be violated. Checks should be off 
only in fully debugged and tested programs. After checks are turned off, 
full testing should again be done, since any program that handles an 
exception may expiect results that will not occur if no checking is done. 

SYSLIB This pragma tells the compiler that the current unit is one of the standard 

Janus/Ada system libraries. It takes as a parameter an integer literal in the 
range 1 .. 15; only the values 1 through 4 are currently used. For example, 
system library number 2 provides floating point support. E)o not use this 
pragma unless you are writing a package to replace one of the standard 
Janus/Ada system libraries. 

VERBOSE Takes On or Off as its argument, and has a textual range. VERBOSE 

controls the amount of output on an error. If VERBOSE is on, the two

Appendix F: Implementation Dependencies 

lines preceding the error are printed, with an arrow pointing at the error. 
If VERBOSE is off, only the line number is printed. 

VERBOSE(OfO: 

Line 16 at Position 5 

♦ERROR* Identifier is not defined 

VERBOSE(On); 

15: if X = 10 then 
16: Z := 10; 


♦ERROR* Identifier is not defined 

The reason for this option is that an error message with VERBOSE on can 
take a long time to be generated, especially in a large program. 
VERBOSE’s initial condition can be set by the compiler command line. 

Several required Ada pragmas may have surprising effects in Janus/Ada. The PRIORITY pragma 
may only take the value 0, since that is the only value in the range System.Priority. Specifying any 
OPTIMIZE pragma turns on optimization; otherwise, optimization is only done if specified on the 
compiler’s command line. The SUPPRESS pragma is ignored unless it only has one parameter. 
Also, the following pragmas are always ignored: CONTROLLED, INLINE, MEMORY_SIZE, 
PACK, SHARED, STORAGE_UNIT, and SYSTEM_NAME. Pragma CONTROLLED is~always 
ignored because Janus/Ada does no automatic garbage collection; thus, the effect of pragma 
CONTROLLED already applies to all access types. Pragma SHARED is similarly ignored: 
Janus/Ada’s non-preemptive task scheduling gives the appropriate effect to all variables. The 
pragmas INLINE, PACK, and SUPPRESS (with two parameters) all provide recommendations to 
the compiler; as Ada allows, the recommendations are ignored. The pragmas MEMORY_SIZE, 
STORAGE_UNIT, and SYSTEM_NAME all attempt to make changes to constants in the System 
package; in each case, Janus/Ada allows only one >^ue, so that the pragma is ignored. 

F.2 Implementation Dependent Attributes 

Janus/Ada does not provide any attributes other than the required Ada attributes. 

F.3 Specification of the Package SYSTEM 

The package System for Janus/Ada has the following definition. 

package System Is 

— System package for Janus/Ada 

— Types to define type Address, 
type Word is range 0 .. 65536; 
for Word'Size use 16; 
type Offset_Type is new Word; 
type Address is record

-- Other System Dependent Declarations 
subtype Priority is Integer range 0 .. 0; 

type Byte is range 0 .. 255; 
for Byte'Size use 8; 

end System; 

The type Byte in the System package corresponds to the 8-bit machine byte. The type Word is 
a 16-bit Unsigned Integer type, corresponding to a machine word. 

F.4 Restrictions on Representation Qauses 

If T is a discrete type, or a fixed point type, then the size expression can give any value between 
1 and 1000 bits (subject, of course, to allowing enough bits for every possible value). For other 
types, the expression must give the default size for T. 

A length clause that specifies T’STORAGE_SIZE for an access type is not supported; Janus/Ada 
uses a single large common heap. 


F-5 


Copyright 1989, R.R. Software, Inc. 


Revision 4.6 





Appendix F: Implcmentalion Dependencies 


A length clause that specifies T’STORAGE_SIZE for a task type T is supported. Any integer 
value can be specified. Values smaller than 256 will be rounded up to 256 (the minimum 
T'Storage_Size), as the Ada standard does not allow raising an exception in this case. 

A length clause that speciHes T’SMALL for a fixed point type must give a value (subject to the 
Ada restrictions) in the range 

2.0 ** (-99) .. 2.0 ** 99, 


inclusive. 

An enumeration representation clause for a type T may give any integer values within the range 
System.Min_Int .. System.Max_Int. If a size length clause is not given for the type, the type’s size 
is determined from the literals given. (If all of the literals Ht in a byte, then Byte’Size is used; 
similarly for Integer and Long_Integer). 

I'he expression in an alignment clause in a record representation clause must equal 1. 

A component clause must give a storage place that is equivalent to the default value of the 
POSITION attribute for such a component. 

A component clause must give a range that starts at zero and extends to one less than the size of 
the component. 

Janus/Ada supports address clauses on most objects. Address clauses are not allowed on 
parameters, generic formal parameters, and renamed objects. The address given for an object 
address clause may be any legal value of type System.Address. It will be interpreted as an absolute 
machine address, using the segment part as a selector if in the protected mode. It is the user’s 
responsibility to ensure that the value given makes sense (i.e., points at memory, does not overlay 
other objects, etc.) No other address clauses are supported. 

F.5 Implementation Defined Names 

Janus/Ada uses no implementation generated names. 

F.6 Address Clause Expressions 

The address given for an object address clause may be any legal value of type System.Address. It 
will be interpreted as an absolute machine address, using the segment part as a selector if in the 
protected mode. It is the user’s responsibility to ensure that the value given makes sense (i.e., 
points at memory, does not overlay other objects, etc.) 

F.7 Unchecked_Conversion Restrictions 

We first make the following definitions; 

A type or subtype is said to be a simple type or a simple subtype (respectively) if it is a scalar 
(sub)type, an access (sub)type, a task (sub)type, or if it satisfies the following two conditions: 

F-s 


Copyright 1989, R.R. Software, Inc. 


Revision 4.6 






Appendix F: Implementation Dependencies 


1) If it is an array type or subtype, then it is constrained and its index constraint is 
static; and 

2) If it is a composite type or subtype, then all of its subcomponents have a simple 
subtype. 

A (sub)type which does not meet these conditions is called non-simple. Discriminated records can 
be simple; variant records can be simple. However, constraints which depend on discriminants are 
non-simple (because they are non-static). 

Janus/Ada imposes the following restriction on instantiations of Unchecked_Conversion; for such 
an instantiation to be legal, both the source actual subtype and the target actual subtype must be 
simple subtypes, and they must have the same size. 

F.8 Implementation Dependencies of I/O 

The syntax of an external file name depends on the operating system being used. Some external 
files do not really specify disk files; these are called devices. Devices are specified by special file 
names, and are treated specially by some of the I/O routines. 

The syntax of an MS-DOS 2ja or 3jcx filename is: 

[d: ] [path] filenanieC .ext] 

where "d:" is an optional disk name; "path" is an optional path consisting of directory 
names, each follow^ by a backslash; "filename" is the filename (maximum 8 characters); 
and ".ext" is the extension (or file type). See your MS-DOS manual for a complete 
description. In addition, the following special device names are recognized 

STI; MS-DOS standard input. The same as Standard_Input. Input is bufiiered by lines, 
and all MS-DOS line editing characters may be us^. Can only be read. 

STO: MS-DOS standard output. The same as Standard_Output. Can only be written. 
ERR: MS-DOS standard error. The output to this device cannot be redirected. Can only 
be written. 

CON: The console device. Single character input with echoing. Due to the design of MS- 
DOS, this device can be redirected. Can be read and written. 

AUX: The auxiliary device. Can be read or written. 

LST: The list (printer) device. C^n only be written. 

KBD: The console input device. No character interpretation is performed, and there is 
no character echo. Again, the input to this device can be redirected, so it does not 
always refer to the physical keyboard. 

The MS-DOS device files may also be used (CON, AUX, and PRN without colons ’:’)■ For 
compatibility reasons, we do not recommend the use of these names. 

The MS-DOS 2.xx version of the I/O system will do a search of the default search path (set 
by the DOS PATH command) if the following conditions are met: 

1) No disk name or path is present in the file name; and 


F-7 


Copyright 1969, R.R. Software, Inc 


Revision 4.6 








Appendix F: Implementation Dependencies 


2) The name is not that of a device. 

Alternatively, you may think of the search being done if the file name does not contain any 
of the characters or 

The default search path cannot be changed while the program is running, as the path is 
copied by the Janus/Ada program when it starts running. 

Note: 

Creates will never cause a path search as they must work in the current directory. 

Upon normal completion of a program, any open external files are closed. Nevertheless, to provide 
portability, we recommend explicitly closing any files that are used. 

Sharing external files between multiple file objects causes the corresponding external file to be 
opened multiple times by the operating system. The effects of this are defined by your operating 
system. This external file sharing is only allowed if all internal files associated with a single 
external file are opened only for reading (mode In_File), and no internal file is Created. 
Use_Error is raised if these requirements are violated. A Reset to a writing mode of a file already 
opened for reading also raise Use_Error if the external file also is shared by another internal file. 

Binary I/O of values of access types will give meaningless results and should not be done. Binary 
I/O of types which are not simple types (see definition in Section F.7, above) will raise Use_Error 
when the file is opened. Such types require specification of the block size in the form, a capability 
which is not yet supported. 

The form parameter for Sequential_IO and Direct_IO is always expected to be the null string. 

The typ.; Count in the generic package DirecMO is defined to have the range 0 .. 2_147_483_647. 

Ada specifies the existence of special markers called terminators in a text file. Janus/Ada defines 
the line terminator to be <LF> (line feed), with or without an additional <CR> (carriage return). 
The page terminator is the <FF> (form feed) character; if it is not preceded by a <LF>, a line 
terminator is also assumed. 

The file terminator is the end-of-file returned by the host operating system. If no line and/or page 
terminator directly precedes the file terminator, they are assumed. If the form "Z" is used, the 
<Ctrl>-Z character also represents the end-of-file. This form is not necessary to correctly read 
files produced with Janus/Ada and most other programs, but may be occasionally necessary. The 
only legal forms for text files are "" (the null string) and "Z". All other forms raise USE_ERROR. 

If the form is the <Ctrl>-Z character is ignored on input. The <CR> character is always 
ignored on input. (They will not be returned by Get, for instance). All other control characters 
are sent directly to the user. Output of control characters does not affect the layout that Text_IO 
generates. In particular, output of a <LF> before a New_Page does not suppress the New_Line 
caused by the New_Page. 

On output, the "Z" form causes the end-of-file to be marked by a <Ctrl>-Z; otherwise, no explicit 
end-of-file character is used. The character pair <CR> <LF> is written to represent the line 
terminator. Because <CR> is ignored on input, this is compatible with input.

Appendix F: Implementation Dependencies 


The type Text lO.Count has the range 0 .. 'illSl-, the type Text lO.Field also has the range 0 .. 
32767. 

IO_Exceptions.USE_ERROR is raised if something cannot be done because of the external file 
s\'stem; such situations arise when one attempts: 

to create or open an external file for writing when the external file is already open 
(via a different internal file). 

to create or open an external file when the external file is already open for writing 
(via a different internal file). 

to reset a file to a writing mode when the external file is already open (via a 

different internal file). 

to write to a full disk (Write, Close); 

to create a file in a full directory (Create); 

to have more files open than the OS allows (Open, Create); 

to open a device with an illegal mode; 

to create, reset, or delete a device; 

to create a file where a protected file (i.e., a directory or read-only file) already 
exists; 

to delete a protected file; 

to use an illegal form (Open, Create); or 

to open a file for a non-simple type without specifying the block size; 
to open a device for direct I/O. 

IO_Exceptions.DEVICE_ERROR is raised if a hardware error other than those covered by 
USE_,ERROR occurs. These situations should never occur, but may on rare occasions. For 
example, DEVICE_ERROR is raised when: 

a file is not found in a Close or a Delete; 

• a seek error occurs on a direct Read or Write; or 
a seek error occurs on a sequential End_Of_File. 

The subtypes Standard.Positive and Standard.Natural, rised by some I/O routines, have the 
maximum value 32767. 

No package Low_Ijevel_IO is provided. 

F.9 Running the compiler and linker 

The Janus/Ada compiler is invoked using the following format: 

JANUS [d:] filename [.ext] (/option) 

where filename is an MS/DOS file name with optional disk name [d:], optional extension [.ext], and 
compiler options {/option}. If no disk name is specified, the current disk is assumed. If no 
extension is specified, .PKG b assumed. 

The compiler options are: 


F-9 


Copyright 1969, R.R. Sotlwire, Inc 


Revision 4.6 







Appendix F: Implementation Dependencies 


B Brief error messages. The line in error is not printed (equivalent to turning off pragma 
VERBOSE). 

BS Brief statistics. Few compiler statistics are printed. 

D Don’t generate debugging code (equivalent to turning off pragma DEBUG) 

F Use in-line 8087 instructions for Floating point operations. By default the compiler 
generates library calls for floating point operations. The 8087 may be used to execute the 
library calls. A floating point support library is still required, even though this option is 
used. 

L Create a listing file with name fliename.PRN on the same disk as filename. The listing file 

will be a listing of only the last compilation unit in a file. 

Ld Create a listing file on specified disk’d’. Choices are ’A’ through ’W’. 

Ox Object code memory model. X is 0 or 1. Memory model 0 creates faster, smaller code, 

but limits all code in all units of a program to one MS-DOS segment (i.e., 64 kilobytes); 
Memory model 1 allows code size limited only by your machine and operating system. See 
the linker (JLINK) manual for more information. Memory model 0 is assumed if this 
option is not given. The compiler records the memory model for which each library unit 
was compiled, and it will complain if any mismatches occur. Thus, the compiler enforces 
that if it is run using the /ol option, then all of the withed units must have been compiled 
with the same option. 

Q Quiet error messages. This option causes the compiler not to wait for the user to interact 
after an error. In the usual mode, the compiler will prompt the user after each error to 
ask if the compilation should be aborted. This option is useful if the user wants to take 
a coffee break while the compiler is working, since all user prompts are suppressed. The 
errors (if any) will not stay on the screen when this option is used; therefore, the console 
traffic should be sent to the printer or to a file. Be warned that certain syntax errors can 
cause the compiler to print many error messages for each and every line in the program. 
A lot of paper could used this way! Note that the /Q option disallows disk swapping, 
even if the /S option is given. 

Rd Route the JRL file to the specified disk’d’. Choices are ’A’ through ’W’. The default is 
the same disk as filename. 

Sd Route Scratch files to specified disk. This option is useful if you have a RAM disk or if 
your disk does not have much free space. The use of vuis option also allows disk swapping 
to load package specification (.SYM) files. Normally, after both the compiler and source 
file disia are searched for .SYM files, an error is produced if they are not all found. 
However, when the /S option is used, the compiler disk may be removed and replaced by 
a disk to search. The linker has a similar option, which allows the development of large 
programs on systems with a small disk capacity. Note that disk swapping is not enabled 
by the /S option if the /Q (quiet option) is also given. The /Q option is intended for batch 
mode compiles, and its purpose conflicts with the disk swapping. The main problem is 
that when the /S option is used to put scratch files on a RAM disk, a batch file may stop 
waiting for a missing .SYM or ERROR.MSG file; such behavior would not be appropriate 
when /Q is specified. 

T Generate information which allows trimming unused subprograms from the code. This 
option tells the compiler to generate information which can be used by the remove 
subprograms fixjm the final code. This option increases the size of the JRL files produced. 
We recommend that it be used on reusable libraries of code (like trig, libraries or stack 
packages) • that is those compilations for which it is likely that some subprograms are not 
called. 

W Don’t print any warning messages. For more control of warning messages, use the 
following option form (Wx). 


F-IO 


Copyright 1989, R.R. Software, Inc. 


Revision 4.6 




Appendix F: Implementation Dependencies 


Wx Print only warnings of level less than the specified digit ’x’. The given value of x may be 
from 1 to 9. The more warnings you are willing to see, the higher the number you should 
give. 

X Handle eXtra symbol table information. This option is for the use of the JScope debugger 
and other tools. This option requires large quantities of memory and disk space, and thus 
should be avoided if possible. 

Z Turn on optimization. This has the same effect as if the pragma OPTIMIZE were set to 
SPACE throughout your compilation. 

The default values for the command line options are: 

B Error messages are verbose. 

BS Statistics are verbose. 

D Debug code is generated. 

F Library calls are generated for floating point operations. 

L No listing Hie is generated. 

O Memory model 0 is used. 

Q The compiler prompts for abort after every error. 

R The JRL file is put on the same disk as the input file. 

S Scratch files are put on the same disk as the compiler. 

T No trimming code is produced. 

W All warnings are printed. 

X Extra symbol table information is not generated. 

Z Optimization is done only where so specified by pragmas. 

Leading spaces are disregarded between the filename and the call to JANUS. Spaces are otherwise 
not recommended on the command line. The presence of blanks to separate the options or 
between the filename and the extension will be ignored. 

Examples: 

JANUS test/Q/L 
JANUS test,run/W4 
JANUS test 

JANUS test .run /B /W/L 

The compiler produces a SYM (SYMboi table information) file when a specification is compiled, 
and a SRL or JRL (Specification ReLocatable or Janus ReLocatable) file when a body is compiled. 
To make an executable program, the appropriate SRL and JRL files must be linked (combined) 
with the run-time Ubraries. This is accomplished by running the Janus/Ada linker, JLINK. 

The Janus/Ada linker is invoked using the following format: 

JLINK [d;] filename {/option) 

Here "filename" is the name of the SRL or JRL file created when the main program was compiled 
(without the .SRL or JRL extension) with optional disk name [d:], and compiler options {/option}. 
The filename usually corresponds to the first eight letters of the name of your main program. A 
disk may be specific where the files are to be found. See the linker manual for more detailed 
directions. We summarize here, however, a few of the most commonly used linking options: 


F-U 


Copyright 1969, R.R. Software, Inc 


Revision 4.6 









Appendix F: Implementation Dependencies 


E Create an EXE file. This is assumed if the /01 option is given. This allows allow a 
slightly larger total program size if memory model is used. 

FO Use software floating point (the default). 

F2 Use hardware (8087) floating point. 

L Display lots of information about the loading process. 

OO Use memory model 0 (the default); see the description of the /O option in the compiler, 
above. 

01 Use memory model 1. 

Q Use quiet error messages; i.e., don’t wait for the user to interact after an error. 

B Use brief statistics. 

T Trim unused subprograms from the code. This option tells the linker to remove 
subprograms which are never called from the final output file. This option reduces space 
usage of the final file by as much as 30K. 

Examples: 

JLINK test 
JLINK test /Q/L 
JLINK test/01/L/F2 

Note that if you do not have a hardware floating point chip, and if you are using memory model 

0, then you generally will not need to use any linker options.

TEST PARAMETERS 


APPENDIX C 
TEST PARAMETERS 


Cenain tests in the ACVC make use of implementation-dependent values, such as the maximum 
length of an input line and invalid file names. A test that makes use of such values is identified 
by the extension .TST in its file name. Actual values to be substituted are represented by names 
that begin with a dollar sign. A value must be substituted for each of these names before the test 
is run. The values used for this validation are given below: 


Name and Meaning 
$ACC_SIZE 

An integer literal whose value is the 
number of bits sufficient to hold any value 
of an access type. 

$BIG_ID1 

An identifier the size of the maximum input 
line length which is identical to $BIG_ID2 
except for the last character. 

$BIG_ID2 

An identifier the size of the maximum input 
line length which is identical to $BIG_ID1 
except for the last character. 

$BIG_ID3 

An identifier the size of the maximum input 
line length which is identical to $BIG_ID4 
except for a character near the middle. 


Value 


16 


(1..199=>’A’,200=>T’) 


(1..199=>’A’,200=>’2’) 


(1..100=>’AM01 = > ’3M02..200= >’A’) 


$BIG_ID4

WITHDRAWN TESTS 


APPENDIX D 
WITHDRAWN TESTS 


Some tests are withdrawn &om the ACVC because they do not conform to the Ada Standard. 

The following 44 tests had been withdrawn at the time of validation testing for the reasons 

indicated. A reference of the form Al-ddddd is to an Ada Commentary. 

E28005C This test expects that the string TOP OF PAGE. —63" of line 204 will appear 
at the top of the listing page due to a pragma PAGE in line 203; but line 203 
contains text that follows the pragma, and it is this that must appear at the top of 
the page. 

A39005G This test unreasonably expects a component clause to pack an array component into 
a minimum size (line 30). 

B97102E This test contains an unitended illegality: a select statement contains a null 
statement at the place of a selective wait alternative (line 31). 

C97116A This test contains race conditions, and it assumes that guards are evaluated 
indivisibly. A conforming implementation may use interleaved execution in such 
a way that the evaluation of the guards at lines SO & 54 and the execution of task 
CHANGING_OF_THE_GUARD results in a call to REPORT.FAILED at one of 
lines 52 or 56. 

BC3009B This test wrongly expects that circular instantiations will be detected in several 
compilation units even though none of the units is illegal with respect to the units 
it depends on; by A1-002S6, the illegality need not be detected untU execution is 
attempted (line 95). 

CC2A62D This test wrongly requires that an array object’s size be no greater than 10 although 
its subtype’s size was specified to be 40 (line 137). 

CD2A63A..D, CD2A66A..D, CD2A73A..D, CD2A76A..D [16 tests] 

These tests wrongly attempt to check the size of objects of a derived type (for 
which a ’SIZE length clause is given) 1^ passing them to a derived subprogram 
(which implicitly converts them to the parent type (Ada standard 3.4:14)). 
Additional^, they use the ’SIZE length clause and attribute, whose interpretation 
is considered problematic by the WG9 ARG. 

CD2A81G, CD2A83G, CD2A84N & M, & CD5011O [5 tests] 

These tests assume that dependent tasks will terminate while the main program 
executes a loop that simply tests for task termination; this is not the case, and the 
main program may loop indefinitely (lines 74, 85, 86 & 96, 86 & 96, and 58, resp.).

WITHDRAWN TESTS 


These tests expect that a ’STORAGE_SIZE length clause provides precise control 
over the number of designated objects in a collection; the Ada standard 13.2:15 
allows that such control must not be expected. 

CD2D11B This test gives a SMALL representation clause for a derived fixed-point type (at 
line 30) that deOnes a set of model numbers that are not necessarily represented 
in the parent type; by Commentary AI-00099, all model numbers of a derived 
Hxed-point type must be representable values of the parent type. 

CD5007B This test wrongly expects an implicitly declared subprogram to be at the the address 
that is specified for an unrelated subprogram (line 303). 

ED7004B, ED7005C & D, ED7006C & D (5 tests) 

These tests check various aspects of the use of the three SYSTEM pragmas; the 
AVO withdraws these tests as being inappropriate for validation. 

CD7105A This test requires that successive calls to CALENDAR.CLOCK change by at least 
SYSTEM.TICK; however, by Commentary AI-00201, it is only the expected 
frequency' of change that must be at least SYSTEM.TICK-particular instances of 
change may be less (line 29). 

CD7203B, & CD7204B 

These tests use the ’SIZE length clause and attribute, whose interpretation is 
considered problematic by the WG9 ARG. 

CD7205D This test checks an invalid test objective: it treats the specification of storage to 
be reserved for a task’s activation as though it were like the specification of storage 
for a collection. 

CE2107I This test requires that objects of two similar scalar types be distinguished when read 
from a file»DATA_ERROR is expected to be raised by an attempt to read one 
object as of the other type. However, it is not clear exactly how the Ada standard 
14.2.4:4 is to be interpreted; thus, this test objective is not considered valid, (line 
90) 

CE3111C This test requires certain behavior, when two files are associated with the same 
external file, that is not required by the Ada standard. 

CE3301A This test contains several calls to END_OF_LINE & END_OF_PAGE that have 
no parameter: these calls were intended to specify a file, not to refer to 
STANDARD_INPUT (lines 103, 107, 118, 132, & 136). 

CE3411B This test requires that a text file’s column number be set to COUNT’LAST in order 
to check that LAYOUT_ERROR is raised by a subsequent PUT operation. But 
the former operation will generally raise an exception due to a lack of available disk 
space, and the test would thus encumber validation testing.

NCC VSR ADDENDUM 


This Addendum to the ACVC 1.10 VSR ctarifies some items which are contained within the 
standard pre-forma Validation Summary Report as supplied by the Ada Maintenance Office 
(AMO). 

In line with AJPO regulations the contents of the VSR have not been altered in order to keep 
consistency between the different AVFs. 

The points raised in this addendum are being addressed by the AMO in future issues of the VSR. 


1 The last paragraph of Chapter 1 contains the following statement ’Any test that was 
determined to contain an illegal language construct or an erroneous language construct is 
withdrawn from the ACVC...’ 

This is incorrect since illegal constructs are legitimately contained within Class B tests. 


Both the terms ’inapplicable’ and ’not applicable’ are used within the VSR. These terms 
are identical. 


3 Chapter 1 of the VSR does not indicate how ’inapplicable’ tests are to be analysed. The 
analysis is undertaken as follows; 

’Each inapplicable test is checked to ensure that this behaviour is consistent with the given 
reasons for its inapplicability’.
