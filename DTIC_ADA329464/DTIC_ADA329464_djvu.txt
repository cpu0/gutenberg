Techniques for Efficient Execution of Fine-grained 
Massively-Parallel Programs 

N00014-93-1-1086 (AASERT linked with N00014-92-J-1961)

Overview 

The objective of the base project is to explore the use and implementation of object-oriented 
techniques for high performance, high-level programming. Object-oriented languages are a high 
level approach of clear programming benefit but are typically much less efficient that traditional 
approaches embodied in Fortran and C. We evaluate the complexity of programming irregular 
applications, and the efficient implementation of such programs using novel program analysis and 
runtime techniques. 

We have developed a range of language implementation techniques which can significantly im¬ 
prove the efficiency of object-oriented programs. These techniques are embodied in the Illinois 
Concert System, and have been demonstrated on entire irregular, parallel application codes. 
The insights from our research are described in numerous technical publications, and were used to 
design a new parallel object-oriented language, ICC-I-+. 

Our research results have broad implications for the efficient implementation of both concur¬ 
rent and sequential object-oriented languages. Major results include novel global type inference 
techniques [4] which produce detailed concrete type information as well as dynamic data struc¬ 
ture analyses [5]. These techniques are embodied in the Illinois Concert System which is widely 
known and disseminated [1,2]. Empirical evaluation of these techniques both on benchmark kernels 
and entire applications indicate they can allow object-oriented programs to match the sequential 
performance of C [6]. Our optimizations can produce performance equal to Fortran and message 
passing on large parallel applications, supporting a higher level programming model essential for 
programming complex pointer-based applications on scalable machines. In particular, we have 
demonstrated these techniques for protein molecular dynamics (IC-CEDAR) [7], parallel radiosity 
[3], and are working the Cosmology grand challenge team on an adaptive model of galactic for¬ 
mation. These results are documented in over thirty refereed publications in top conferences and 
journals.
