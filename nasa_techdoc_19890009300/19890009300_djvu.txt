A novel technique to analyze analog data in fiber optic sensing systems with temporal 
^ separation of channels is proposed. A theoretical explanation of the process is presented 
rZ and an experimental setup that was used to obtain the data is described.

I 
^ 1. INTRODUCTION 

Different referencing schemes for intensity modulation fiber optic sensing systems have 
been developed in recent years. ^ One of the schemes involves temporal referencing. To 
construct a system with the reference and signal channels separated in the time domain 
fiber optic loops are used. 2^3 ^n initial light pulse of a short duration sent into such 
a loop generates a series of pulses. The relative power of these pulses depends on the 
power losses in the loop. A sensor-transducer incorporated in the loop responds to the 
measured parameter and contributes to the losses. Thus, the information about the 
measured can be retrieved by measuring the relative power of the pulses. In the system 
employing the temporal referencing, the signal and reference channels share the same fiber 
optic link between the loop and signal processing electronics. This makes the system 
insensitive to changes in the transmission of the link and to light source intensity varia- 
tions. 

The major problem with this method lies in the fact that the entire fiber optic loop 
acts as a sensing element. To minimize the mentioned problem, the loop has to be short. 
However, in order to generate a pulse train, a shorter loop requires a shorter duration 
initial pulse. To process pulses of very short duration, high-speed oscilloscopes, boxcar 
averagers, or streak cameras have to be used. These measuring techniques require heavy 
and bulky equipment. However, in applications where size and weight play a considerable 
role, the use of stationary signal processing equipment is restricted. At the same time 
the conventional signal processing techniques employing small size high-speed analog compo- 
nents such as analog-to-digital converters and sample-and-hold circuits still require a 
significant fiber optic loop length and a relatively long duration initial pulse. 

The technique proposed in this paper eliminates this problem. It is based on analyzing 
the amplitude spectrum of the signal and comparing different portions of the spectrum with 
each other. 

2. THEORY 

Assume we have a series of N rectangular pulses of the same duration ti and ampli- 
tudes V]^, V2, . . ., V[^, where N is a positive integer. Assume also that a delay be- 
tween any two successive pulses is equal to A. Using Fourier analysis^ the spectrum of 
this series of pulses can be written as follows: 



'!<-' te f. 



F(jw) « F,(w) {2^ ^ exp [-j(n - l)wA]J (1) 

n«l 



where 



■irm 



is a Fourier spectrum of the first pulse in the series and w is the angular frequency. 
Equation (1) can be rewritten in the form:

The amplitude spectrum can be derived as:

where a »

V^i- 



Analyzing the last expression for N - 2 (double pulse), Eq . (4) can be written as; 



F(w) 



Fj^(w) 



[1 + a^ + 2a cos(wA)]^^^ 



(5) 



where a » ^j^^l ^^ ***^® pulse amplitude ratio. 

Denoting the component in Eq . (5) that is dependent on the pulse amplitude ratio a, 
as S(w,a) , then 



S<w,a) - [1 + a2 + 2a cos(wA)] 



1/2 



(6) 



This component will be referred to as the spectrum modulating function. The function S 
for different values of a is presented in Figure 1. This function of each value of a 
has maxima at w - 2iT(m - 1)/A and minima at w - iT(2m - 1)/A, where m is a positive 
integer. Using the relationship w - 2TTf where f is the linear frequency one can find 
that the function described by Eq. (5) has maxima if f - (m - 1)/A and minima if 
f - (2m - 1)/2A. 

If the pulse amplitude ratio a varies, then for every given frequency w one can 
write the derivative with respect to a as: 



3F 

aa 



F^(w) 



g + COS(wA) 



[1 



a^ + 2a COS(wA)]^'^^ 



(7) 



From the last equation it follows that if a > 1, then 9F/da > for all frequencies. 
However, if a < 1, some parts of the spectrum have 8F/aa > and some have 3F/Da <'o. 

The preceding equations show that different portions of the amplitude spectrum of a dou- 
ble pulse respond to a change in the pulse amplitude ratio a in different ways. At fre- 
quencies w corresponding to maxima of function F(w), 3F/3a > regardless of the 
value of a. However at frequencies corresponding to minima of the same function, 
9F/3a > only if a > 1 and 3F/3a < if a < 1. For practical reasons the analysis 
can be restricted to the first extremes of the function F(w) . The ratio of the function 
F(w) values obtained at the minimum to its value at the maximum as a function of a is:

If a change in the ratio a is caused by some external factor (perturbation), the ef* 
feet of the perturbation can be determined by analyzing the amplitude spectrum F(w) of 
the double pulse and comparing different portions of the spectrum with each other. For 
the best sensitivity these spectral windows have to be located at the first maximum and 
the first minimum of the function F(w), and the values of a have to be <1 because at 
these windows for a < 1 the derivatives 9F/3a have opposite sign.

In casQ the double pulse is repetitive with period T, the expression for the amplitude 
spectrum has to be written as:

where Wp » 2pTr/T is the angular frequency (p - 1,2,3, 



) and the other equations 



have to be modified accordingly. However, if the double pulse period T is much greater 



than the delay A, the discrete frequencies 
analysis will not be significantly changed.

An experimental fiber opti-: sensing system consists of a pulse modulated light source, 
a fiber optic loop, a photodetector, and signal processing electronics. The fiber optic 
loop generates a light pulse train and together with a sensor incorporated in the loop 
forms a sensor head. The photodector detects the light pulse train, and the signal proc- 
essing electronics processes the light pulses to obtain information about their relative 
amplitudes. Fiber optic cables link the light source, sensor head, and photodetector. 



A schematic of the system is shown in Figure 3. A pulse modulated laser 
sends an initial pulse of short duration toward a sensor head via a fiber op 
The sensor head is formed by a semitransmitting-semiref iecting mirror Ml, a 
mirror M2 , and a piece of fiber between the mirrors long enough to generate 
pulses. For this method the first two pulses are employed, with the first p 
reference and the second one being the signal. These two pulses form a doub 
sensor incorporated in the loop reacts to the measurand by changing the ampl 
second signal pulse. At the same time the first pulse does not pass through 
thus its amplitude remaines unchanged. The generated double pulse propagate

One of the branches analyzes signals in a low-frequency band, another^^one processes'high-'^'* 
frequency signals. Each of the branches consists of a bandpass filter, an amplifier, and a 
voltmeter. The bandpass filters are constructed by placing a lowpass and a highpass filter., 
in series. The filters used in the low-frequency branch are four-pole Butterworch filters 
The high frequency branch contains RF filters. An analog RF and a digital voltmeter are 
used in the high- and low-frequency branches respectively.' 

The following series of figures provides a complete picture of the transformation of the 
double pulse and its spectrum as the electronic signal propagates along each of the branches

frequency branch (Figures 6(b), 7(b), and 8(b)), and bandpass filter in the high-frequency 
branch (Figures 6(c), 7(c), and 8(c)) for a > 1, and a < 1, respectively

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION } 

Readings from voltmeters in the low- and high-frequency branches, V^f a^d Vlp respec- 
tively, are compared, and the ratio of these readings is the measure of the pulse ampli- ' 
tude ratio a. Experimentally obtained dependence of the ratio V^p/VLp on the pulse ^ 
amplitude ratio a is ploted in Figure 9. 

In order to check the system stability of performance the amplitude of the initial 
light pulse has been changed and the ratio Vj^p/'^LF ^^^ been measured. The experiment 
shows that a 20 percent change in the initial pulse amplitude results in the maximum , 

change of about 2 percent in the ratio V^p/Vr^p for the values of a < 0.55. This con- 
firms that the proposed measuring technique mi'-^es the system insensitive to the light 
source intensity variations and variable connector losses. 

The pulse amplitude ratio a is controlled by the coupling losses on the fiber-mirror ' 

interfaces, parameters of the mirrors, and losses in the fiber in the loop. Thus any of 
these factors can be used as a sensing mechanism to measure disturbances. This opens a 
potential of using the technique described with any kind of amplitude modulation sensors. 
Commerical availability of sources and detectors with bandwidth up to 10 GHz and possible 
utilization of small components for signal processing make the temporal separation of chan- 
nels together with the amplitude spectrum modulation method a valuable remote sensing tech- 
nique for aircraft applications.
