Abstract 

The Airborne Laser (ABL) is being deveioped as 
one element of our nation’s Ballistic Missile 
Defense System. The ABL Element Office is 
developing an Atmospheric Decision Aid (ADA) to 
diagnose and forecast the location and magnitude 
of optical turbulence in the upper troposphere and 
lower stratosphere. Development of the ADA reties 
on an understanding about the strengths and 
weaknesses of numerical weather prediction (NWP) 
models, plus the sensitivity of the optical turbulence 
algorithms to the NWP spatial and temporal 
resolution. This case study compared the accuracy 
and precision of the ADA optical turbulence 
algorithms to several horizontal and vertical NWP 
resolutions. Results indicate that for a given 
vertical resolution using a finer horizontal 
resolution does not significantly improve the 
accuracy of the forecast, but for a given horizontal 
resolution increasing the vertical resolution does 
improve the forecast accuracy. 

1. Introduction. 

The Airborne Laser (ABL), an element of 
our nation’s Ballastic Missile Defense 
System (BMDS), will detect and destroy 
boosting ballistic missiles. The ABL 
Element Office is managing the 
development of an Atmospheric Decision 
Aid (ADA) to diagnose and forecast the 
location and magnitude of optical turbulence 
in the upper troposphere and lower 
stratosphere. Optical turbulence is the 
fluctuation of density in the atmosphere and 


Kevin P. Roe

acts to defocus laser beams and thus reduce 
their effective range. Layers of intense 
optical turbulence, while possibly stretching 
hundreds of kilometers in the horizontal, 
tend to occur on vertical scales of a 
centimeter to 100 meters. 

An objective method of predicting optical 
turbulence has been developed at the Air 
Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). This 
method combines the forecast output of 
numerical weather prediction (NWP) models 
with a parameterization of the optical 
turbulence tailored to the model (Ruggiero 
and DeBenedictis 2000, 2002). This 
approach has also be used by others in 
support of astronomy operations (e.g. 
Businger et al. 2002). Ruggiero and 
DeBenedictis (2002) presented validation 
results that reveal the optical turbulence 
parameterization method is capable of 
representing coarse guidance on optical 
turbulence intensity. However the results 
also indicated that the predictive skill of the 
optical turbulence parameterization is 
limited by the ability of the NWP model to 
depict atmospheric features at a small spatial 
resolution. 

The ABL’s ADA is designed to use this 
objective optical turbulence prediction 
method. In practice the ADA will access 
real-time mesoscale NWP model forecast

data from the Air Force Weather Agency 
(AFWA). Given the ABL’s need for small- 
scale vertical depiction of atmospheric 
phenomena and the operational constraints 
of the AFWA it is important to determine 
the optimal configuration in terms of grid 
spacing of the mesoscale model. 

2. Problem and Methodology. 

2.1 Mesoscale Forecast Model 

The mesoscale model used in this study is 
the current operational model used at the 
AFWA—^the Fifth Generation National 
Center for Atmospheric Research - Penn 
State University Mesoscale Model (MM5, 
version 3; Grell et al. 1995). This version of 
MM5 has been optimized for distributed 
memory, multiple processor computers such 
as the IBM SP series and scales efficiently 
(Michalakes, 2000). MM5 offers a selection 
of physics parameterizations and those used 
in this study were selected in order to mimic 
the MM5 setup used at the AFWA. Initial 
conditions and horizontal boundary 
conditions were obtained from the National 
Centers for Environmental Prediction’s 
Global Forecast System (GFS). 

2.2 Optical Turbulence Parameterization 

The optical turbulence parameterization 
used in the ABL’s ADA is taken from 
Dewan et al. (1993). It was developed using 
vertical wind profiles resolved on the order 
of meters and was originally designed to 
convert standard rawinsonde data into the 
refractive index structure function (Cn^) 
profiles. The Dewan parameterization uses 
the Tatarski (1961) formulation for (Cn^), 


Ct =2.8 


(79x10'^ 




dz 


+ r 


Al) 


where P is the pressure in millibars, T is the 
temperature in degrees Kelvin, y is the dry 
adiabatic lapse rate of 9.8x10'^ degrees 


Kelvin per meter and z is the height in 
meters. All of these variables are easily 
obtained from mesoscale NWP models, 
though it is not yet understood if the NWP 
models represent these variables at sufficient 
resolution. The one variable that can not be 
explicitly retrieved from a mesoscale model, 
V 

LQ , is referred to by Tatarski (1961) as the 

outer length or the largest scale of the 
inertial subrange. Dewan et al. (1993) 
closed the Tatarski relationship for Cn^ using 

4/ 

a statistical relationships for LQ developed 

as a fimction of wind shear. The 
relationships are: 

= 0.1^ (Troposphere) 

( 2 ) 

(Stratosphere) 

where Lo has the imits of meters and S is the 
magnitude of the wind shear. 



Ruggiero and DeBenedictis (2002) found 
the success of the Dewan model to diagnose 
optical turbulence is directly related to the 
ability of the mesoscale model to resolve the 
vertical wind shear (S). 

2.3 Experiment Setup 

In order to ascertain the optimal NWP 
model spatial configuration to predict 
optical turbulence, MM5 was run in triple 
nested form centered over the Maima Kea 
Observatory on the island of Hawaii (Figure 
1). The horizontal grid spacing for the three 
domains were 27, 9, and 3 kilometers, 
respectively. The 2-way feedback nest 
between grids was turned off in favor of 
one-way nesting where the outer grid 
provides the boundary conditions for next

inner nest. This was done so that we coul 


d 


effectively judge the forecast skill of the 
coarser grids. MM5 was run in this 
horizontal configuration with 26 vertical 
levels used in one run and 52 vertical levels 


in the second run. 


Validation for the optical turbulence 
predictions was carried out using Cn^ 
observations collected by thermosondes 
during the Maima Kea Fall 2002 
measurement campaign. The principle of 
the thermosonde is described by Brown et 
al. (1982). The thermosonde makes precise 
simultaneous measurements of temperature 
using two probes separated by a horizontal 
distance of one meter. The theory of how 
Cn^ is derived from the horizontal 
temperature difference in conjunction with 
the layer mean temperature and pressure is 
explained by Jumper and Beland (2000). 
The balloons carrying the thermosondes also 
carried a rawinsonde, which provided 
horizontal winds, temperature, moisture, and 
pressure measxirements. All balloons were 
launched from Bradshaw Army Air Field, 
Hawaii located at 19° 47’ N, 155° 33’ W. 
During the experiment three balloons were 
launched approximately two hours apart on 
two different nights (Table 1). The MM5 


model forecasts were started approximately 
24 hours before the measurements 
commenced. This allowed the mesoscale 
model ample time to “spin up” small-scale 
features that would not be in the initial fields 
as well as simulate the forecast lead time 
that would be desired by ABL mission 
planners. 


Table 1. MM5 model forecast start times 
and thermosonde balloon launch times used 
in study. 

For each MM5 run the data from all three 
grids was output to a disk file every hour. 
After the model run was completed, was 
computed at each model grid point for each 
hour. A Cn^ profile was then constructed 
along the balloon trajectory by spatial and 
temporal interpolation. Using the 

hypsometric equation, the values were 

interpolated vertically to 500 meter 
increments. The high-resolution 

thermosonde observations were binned into 
500 meter layers and averaged to produce a 
layered mean Cn^ value at same 500 meter 
vertical intervals. 

3. Results. 

We used two metrics to evaluate the impacts 
of spatial resolution on C^. The accuracy of 
the forecasts was quantitatively assessed 
using root-mean-squared (rms) difference 
between the interpolated NWP forecasts and 
the thermosondes. The accuracy assessment 
was focused on the domain between 5 and 
18 kilometers to be consistent with ABL 
operations. The accuracy results in Figure 2 
show two trends. First that for a given 
vertical resolution, going to a finer 
horizontal resolution does not necessarily 
improve the accuracy; in fact the opposite 
appears to be true. However at a given 
horizontal resolution, increasing the number 
of vertical levels does ^pear to improve the 
accuracy of the predictions. In

equations 1 and 2 it is obvious that C„^ is 
strongly dependent on the vertical shear of 
the horizontal wind and temperature. The 
rms differences between the model and 
observed horizontal winds and temperature 
are also plotted in Figure 2. Those results 
show that for temperature and wind, 
increasing the number of vertical levels from 
26 to 52 at 27 and 9 kilometer horizontal 
grid spacing results in either improved or 
similar error. However at 3 kilometers, 
increasing the vertical levels appears to have 
a negative effect. 

The second metric used to evaluate the 
impact of spatial resolution on Cn^ was the 
precision of the forecasts. The precision of 
the forecasts is focused on identifying 
appropriate features in the vertical. As 
noted above, previous validation studies of 
mesoscale model-derived optical turbulence 
parameterizations have recognized that the 
mesoscale models do not produce 
atmospheric features at the resolution one 
would expect given the model grid spacing 
(Ruggiero and DeBenedictis 2002). Here 
we have computed the scaled power spectra 
for the vertical profiles corresponding to the 
thermosonde flight paths of the east-west 
component of die wind (u), and the north- 
south component (v), plus the temperature. 
The power spectra for temperature and the 
v-component wind are given in Figure 3. 
For temperature there is a substantial 
difference between the 26 and 52 level 
forecasts. The 26 level forecasts tend to 
have most power in the longer wavelengths, 
regardless of the horizontal resolution. At 
the shorter wavelengths, particularly near 
three kilometers, there is significant 
deviation from the observed spectra. The 52 
level forecasts tend to follow the observed 
spectra closer, but still shows a substantial 
deviation from it. The v-component of the 
observed profile has similar spectra to that 
of temperature, including the peak at 
approximately three kilometers. The model 


runs behave a little differently here, in that 
two closest model runs to capturing this 
secondary peak are 26 level runs. 

4. Significance to DoD. 

This work will determine what is the best 
mesoscale model spatial resolution, both in 
the vertical and horizontal, for predicting 
optical turbulence with the Dewan et al. 
model (1993). It will aid in the eventual 
operations of the Airborne Laser. Being 
able to know the potential atmospheric 
effects on the lasers’ propagation will allow 
mission planners to optimally locate the 
ABL’s orbit to protect the asset while 
maximizing the lethality capability. 

5. Systems Used 

All NWP forecasts using the MM5 model 
and optical turbulence postprocessor were 
run on the Maui High Performance 
Computing Center IBM P690. Portions of 
these computations were carried out imder 
the High Performance Modernization 
Office’s Airborne Laser II Challenge 
project. Part of the data analysis work was 
performed on the Aeronautical Systems 
Center IBM P3.
