1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: 

A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class 
to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B 
and class L tests are expected to produce errors at compile time and link 
time, respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result when they 
are executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, 
and the procedure CHECK FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT 
also provides a set of Identity functions used to defeat some compiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECKFILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT and CHECK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately compiled units. Errors 
are expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values — for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in Appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and 
implementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this implementation are described in section 2.3. 


1-2 



INTRODUCTION 


For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by the 
AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications described in 
the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see section 2.1) and, 
possibly some inapplicable tests (see Section 2.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each test of 
the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are irrelevant 
for a given Ada implementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may 
be su ported by documents issued by the ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and commonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Commentaries are included as 
appropriate.

C35713C, B86001U, and C86006G check for the predefined type LONGFLOAT; 
for this implementation, there is no such type. 

C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with a 
name other than FLOAT, LONG_FLOAT, or SH0RT_FL0AT; for this 
implementation, there is no such type. 

A35801E checks that FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST may be used as a range 
constraint in a floating-point type declaration; for this 
implementation, that range exceeds the range of safe numbers of the 
largest predefined floating-point type and must be rejected. (See 
section 2.3.) 

C45531M..P and C45532M..P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations for 
types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or greater; for this 
implementation, MAX_MANTISSA is less than 47. 

C45624A..B (2 tests) check whether the proper exception is raised if 
MACHINEOVERFLOWS is FALSE for floating point types and the results of 
various floating-point operations lie outside the range of the base 
type; for this implementation, MACHINE_0VERFL0VS is TRUE. 

B86001Y uses the name of a predefined fixed-point type other than type 
DURATION; for this implementation, there is no such type. 

C96005B uses values of type DURATION'S base type that are outside the 
range of type DURATION; for this implementation, the ranges are the 
same. 


CD1009C checks whether a length clause can specify a non-default size 
for a floating-point type; this implementation does not support such 
sizes.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


CD2A84A, CD2A84E, CD2A84I..J (2 tests), and CD2A840 use length clauses 
to specify non-default sizes for access types; this implementation does 
not support such sizes.

CE3304A checks that SET_LINE_LENGTH and SET_PAGE_LENGTH raise USEERROR 
if they specify an inappropriate value for the external file; there are 
no inappropriate values for this implementation. 


CE3413B checks that PAGE raises LAYOUT_ERROR when the value of the page 
number exceeds COUNT'LAST; for this implementation, the value of 
COUNT'LAST is greater than 150000, making the checking of this objective 
impractical.

IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATIONS 

Modifications (see section 1.3) vere required for 23 tests. 

The following tests vere split into two or more tests because this 
implementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the way 
expected by the original tests. 

B24009A B33301B B38003A B38003B B38009A B38009B

BD2D03A BD4003A 


A35801E was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by 
the AVO. The compiler rejects the use of the range FLOAT'FIRST..FLOAT'LAST 
as the range constraint of a floating-point type declaration because the 
bounds lie outside of the range of safe numbers (cf. LRM 3.5.7:12). 

CD1009A, CD1009I, CD1C03A, CD2A22J, CD2A24A, CD2A31A..C (3 tests) were 
graded passed by Evaluation Modification as directed by the AVO. These 
tests use instantiations of the support procedure Length_Check, which uses 
Unchecked_Conversion according to the interpretation given in AI-00590. 

The AVO ruled that this interpretation is not binding under ACVC 1.11; the 
tests are ruled to be passed if they produce Failed messages only from the 
instances of LengthCheck—i.e, the allowed Report.Failed messages have the 
general form: 

" * CHECK ON REPRESENTATION FOR CTYPE ID> FAILED."

CHAPTER 3 


PROCESSING INFORMATION 


3.1 TESTING ENVIRONMENT 

The Ada implementation tested in this validation effort is described 
adequately by the information given in the initial pages of this report. 

For technical information about this Ada implementation, contact: 

Ms Jean Jaiswal 
Verdix Corporation 
1600 NW Compton Drive #357 
Aloha OR 97006-6905 


For sales information about this Ada implementation, contact: 

Mr Sam Quiring 
Verdix Corporation 
1600 NW Compton Drive #357 
Aloha OR 97006-6905 


Testing of this Ada implementation was conducted at the customer's site by 
a validation team from the AVF. 


3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming 
Language Standard, whether the test is applicable or inapplicable; 
otherwise, the Ada Implementation fails the ACVC [Pro90]. 


3-1 






PROCESSING INFORMATION 


For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard. 


a) Total Number of Applicable Tests 3807 

b) Total Number of Withdrawn Tests 93 

c) Processed Inapplicable Tests 69 

d) Non-Processed I/O Tests 0 

e) Non-Processed Floating-Point 

Precision Tests 201 

f) Total Number of Inapplicable Tests 270 


g) Total Number of Tests for ACVC 1.11 4170 


All I/O tests of the test suite were processed because this implementation 
supports a file system. The above number of floating-point tests were not 
processed because they used floating-point precision exceeding that 
supported by the implementation. When this compiler was tested, the tests 
listed in section 2.1 had been withdrawn because of test errors. 


3.3 TEST EXECUTION 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were loaded onto a Sun Workstation and the tests were copied 
over Ethernet directly to the host host computer. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host computer, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada implementation. 

The tests were compiled and linked on the host computer system, as 
appropriate. The executable images were transferred to the target computer 
system by the communications link of ethemet, and run. The results were 
captured on the host computer system. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the customer and 
reviewed by the validation team. See Appendix B for a conqplete listing of 
the processing options for this implementation. It also indicates the 
default options. The options invoked explicitly for validation testing 
during this test were: 

Option/Switch Effect 


-w suppress generation of warning messages 


Test output, compiler and linker listings, and job logs were captured on 
magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site by 
the validation team were also archived.

APPENDIX A 


MACRO PARAMETERS 


This appendix contains the macro parameters used for customizing the ACVC. 
The meaning and purpose of these parameters are explained in [UG89]. The 
parameter values are presented in two tables. The first table lists the 
values that are defined in terms of the maximum input-line length, which is 
the value for $MAX_IN_LEN—also listed here. These values are expressed 
here as Ada string aggregates, where "V" represents the maximum input-line 
length.

APPENDIX B 


COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


The compiler options of this Ada implementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to compiler documentation and 
not to this report. 

Ada compiler 

Syntax 

ada [options] [source_file]... [linker_options] 

[object_file.oj... 

Options 

-# identifier type value (define) Define an identifier of a 
specified type and value. See VADS ADA PREPROCESSOR REFERENCE. 

-a file name (archive) Treat filename as an object 
archive file created by ar. Since some archive files end 
with .a, -a is used to distinguish archive files from Ada 
source files. 

-d (dependencies) Analyze for dependencies only. Do not do 
semantic analysis or code generation. Update the library, 
marking' any defined units as uncompiled. The -d option is 
used by a.make to establish dependencies among new files. 

-e (error) Process compilation error messages using a.error 
and send it to standard output. Only the source lines 
containing errors are listed. Only one -e or -E option 
should be used. 

-E 

-E file 

-E directory (error output) Without a file or directory 
argument, ada processes error messages using a.error and 


B-l 






COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


directs a brief output to standard output; the raw error 
messages are left in ada_source.err. If a file pathname is 
given, the raw error messages are placed in that file. If a 
directory argument is supplied, the rav error output is 
placed in dir/source. 

err. The file of rav error messages can be used as input to 
a.error 

-el (error listing) Intersperse error messages among source 
lines and direct to standard output. 


-El 


-El file 

-El directory (error listing) Same as the -E option, 
except that source listing with errors is produced. 

-ev (error vi(l)) Process syntax error messages using 
a.error, embed them in the source file, and call the 
environment editor ERROR_EDITOR. (If ERROR_EDITOR is 
defined, the environment variable ERROR_PATTERN should also 
be defined. ERROR_PATTERN is an editor search command that 
locates the first occurrence of '###' in the error file.) If 
no editor is specified, vi(l) is invoked. 

-K (keep) Keep the intermediate language (IL) file 

produced by the compiler front end. The IL file vill be 

placed in the .objects directory, with the file name Ada_source.i. 

-L libraryname (library) Operate in VADS library 
libraryname (the current working directory is the default). 

-Ifile_abbreviation (library search) This is an option 
passed to the UNIX linker, ld(l) telling it to search the 
specified library file. (No space between the -1 and the 
file abbreviation.) 

For a description of the file abbreviations, see also 
Operating system documentation, ld(l). 

-M unit_name (main) Produce an executable program by 
linking the named unit as the main program. unit_name must 
already be compiled. It must be either a parameterless 
procedure or a parameterless function returning an integer. 

The executable program vill be named a.out unless overridden 
with the -o option. 

-M source_file (main) Produce an executable program by 
compiling and linking source_file. The main unit of the 
program is assumed to be the root name of the .a file (for 
foo.a the unit is foo). Only one .a file may be preceded by 


B-2 




COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-M. The executable program vill be named a.out unless 
overridden with the -o option. 

-o executable file (output) This option is to be used in 
conjunction vlth the -M option. executable_file is the name 
of the executable rather than the default a.out. 

-010-9] (optimize) Invoke the code optimizer (0PTIM3). An 
optional digit (there is no space before the digit) provides 
the level of optimization. The default is -04. 

-0 full optimization 

-00 prevents optimization 

-01 no hoisting 

-02 no hoisting but more passes 

-03 no hoisting but even more passes 

-04 hoisting from loops 

-05 hoisting from loops but more passes 

-06 hoisting from loops with maximum passes 

-07 hoisting from loops and branches 

-08 hoisting from loops and branches, more passes 

-09 hoisting from loops and branches, maximum passes 

Hoisting from branches (and cases alternatives) can be slow 
and does not always provide significant performance gains so 
it can be suppressed. 

For more information about optimization, see COMPILING ADA 
PROGRAMS: Compiler Optimizations or pragma 0PTIMIZE_C0DE(0FF). 

-P Invoke the Ada Preprocessor. See VADS ADA 
PREPROCESSOR REFERENCE. 

-R VADS_library (recompile instantiation) Force analysis 
of all generic instantiations, causing reinstantiation of 
any that are out of date. 

-S (suppress) Apply pragma SUPPRESS to the entire 
compilation for all suppressible checks. (See also pragma 
SUPPRESS(ALL_CHECKS.) 

-sh (show) Display the name of the tool executable but do 
not execute it. 


B-3 










COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


-T (timing) Print timing information for the compilation. 

—v (verbose) Print compiler version number, date and time 
of compilation, name of file compiled, command input line, 
total compilation time, and error summary line. Storage 
usage information about the object file is provided. With 
0PTIM3 the output format of compression (the size of 
optimized instructions) is as a percentage of input 
(unoptimized instructions). 

-v (warnings) Suppress warning diagnostics. 

Description 

The command ada executes the Ada compiler and compiles the 
named Ada source file, ending with the .a suffix. The file 
must reside in a VADS library directory. The ada.lib file in 
this directory is modified after each Ada unit is compiled. 

By default, ada produces only object and net files. If the 
-M option is used, the compiler automatically invokes a.Id 
and builds a complete program with the named library unit as 
the main program. 

Non-Ada object files (.o files produced by a compiler for 
another language) may be given as arguments to ada. These 
files will be passed on to the linker and will be linked 
with the specified Ada object files. 

Command line options may be specified in any order, but the 
order of compilation and the order of the files to be passed 
to the linker can be significant. 

Several VADS compilers may be simultaneously available on a 
single system. Because the ada command in any 
VADS location/bin on a system will execute the correct 
compiler components based upon visible library directives, 
the option -sh is provided to print the name of the 
components actually executed. 

Program listings with a disassembly of machine code 
instructions are generated by a.db or a.das. 

See also a.das; a.db; a.error; a.Id; a.mklib; and Operating System 
reference documentation for the ld(l) utility. 

Diagnostics 

The diagnostics produced by the VADS compiler are intended 
to be self-explanatory. Most refer to the RM. Each RM 
reference includes a section number and optionally, a 
paragraph number enclosed in parentheses.

COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


LINKER OPTIONS 

The linker options of this Ada implementation, as described in this 
Appendix, are provided by the customer. Unless specifically noted 
otherwise, references in this appendix are to linker documentation and not 
to this report. 

a. Id 


prelinker 

Syntax 

a.Id [options] unit_name [ld_options] 

Options 

-DX (debug) Debug memory overflow (use in cases where 
linking a large number of units causes the error message 
local symbol overflow to occur). 

-E unit name (elaborate) Elaborate unit_name as early in 
the elaboration order as possible. 

-F (files) Print a list of dependent files in order and 
suppress linking. 

-L libraryname (library) Operate in VADS library 
library_name (the current working directory is the default). 

-o executable file (output) Use the specified file name as 
the name of the output rather than the default, a.out. 

-sh (show) Display the name of the tool executable but do 
not execute it. 

-U (units) Print a list of dependent units in order and 
suppress linking. 

-v (verbose) Print the linker command before executing it. 

-V (verify) Print the linker command but suppress 
execution. 

Description 

a.Id collects the object files needed to make unit_name a 
main program and calls the UNIX linker ld(l) to link together 
all Ada and other language objects required to produce an 
executable image in a.out. 

unit_name is the main program and must name a non-generic 
subprogram. If unit_name is a function, it must return a 


B-5 





COMPILATION SYSTEM OPTIONS 


value of the type STANDARD.INTEGER. This integer result will 
be passed back to the UNIX shell as the status code of the 
execution. The utility uses the net files produced by the 
Ada compiler to check dependency information, a.Id produces 
an exception mapping table and a unit elaboration table and 
passes this information to the linker. 

a.Id reads instructions for generating executables from the 
ada.lib file in the VADS libraries on the search list. 

Besides information generated by the compiler, these 
directives also include WITHn directives that allow the 
automatic linking of object modules compiled from other 
languages or Ada object modules not named in context clauses 
in the Ada source. Any number of WITHn directives may be 
placed into a library, but they must be numbered 
contiguously beginning at VITH1. The directives are recorded 
in the library's ada.lib file and have the following form. 

WITH1:LINK:objectfile: 

WITH2:LINK:archivefile: 

WITHn directives may be placed in the local Ada libraries or 
in any VADS library on the search list. 

A WITHn directive in a local VADS library or earlier on the 
library search list will hide the same numbered WITHn 
directive in a library later in the library search list. 

Use the tool a.info to change or report library directives 
in the current library. 

All arguments after unit_name are passed on to the linker. 

These may be options for it, archive libraries, library 
abbreviations, or object files. 

VADS_location/bin/a.Id is a wrapper program that executes 
the correct executable based upon directives visible in the 
ada.lib file. This permits multiple VADS compilers to exist 
on the same host. The -sh option prints the name of the 
actual executable file. 

a.out default output file 

VADS_location/standard/* startup and standard library routines 

See also Operating system documentation, ld(l). 

Diagnostics 

Self-explanatory diagnostics are produced for missing files, 
etc. Additional messages are produced by the UNIX linker Id.

END standard; 


C-l 






APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


APPENDIX F. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


1. Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 

1.1. INLINE_QNLY Pragma 

The INLINEjONLY pragma, when used in the same way as pragma 
INLINE, indicates to the compiler that the subprogram must 
always be inlined. This pragma also suppresses the genera¬ 
tion of a callable version of the routine which saves code 
space. If a user erroneously makes an INLINE_0NLY subpro¬ 
gram recursive a warning message will be emitted and an 
PROGRAM ERROR will be raised at run time. 


1.2. BUILT_IN Pragma 

The BUILT IN pragma is used in the implementation of some 
predefined Ada packages, but provides no user access. It is 
used only to implement code bodies for which no actual Ada 
body can be provided, for example the MACHINE_CODE package. 


1.3. SHARE_CODE Pragma 

The SHARE_CODE pragma takes the name of a generic instantia¬ 
tion or a generic unit as the first argument and one of the 
identifiers TRUE or FALSE as the second argument. This 
pragma is only allowed immediately at the place of a 
declarative item in a declarative part or package specifica¬ 
tion, or after a library unit in a compilation, but before 
any subsequent compilation unit. 

When the first argument is a generic unit the pragma applies 
to all instantiations of that generic. When the first argu¬ 
ment is the name of a generic instantiation the pragma 
applies only to the specified instantiation, or overloaded 
instantiations. 

If the second argument is TRUE the compiler will try to 
share code generated for a generic instantiation with code 
generated for other instantiations of the same generic. 
When the second argument is FALSE each instantiation will 
get a unique copy of the generated code. The extent to 
which code is shared between instantiations depends on this 
pragma and the kind of generic formal parameters declared 
for the generic unit. 

The name pragma SHARE_BODY is also recognized by the imple¬ 
mentation and has the same effect as SHARE CODE. It is 


C-2 







APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


included for compatability with earlier versions of VADS. 


1.4. NO_IMAGE Pragma 

The pragma suppresses the generation of the image array used 
for the IMAGE attribute of enumeration types. This elim¬ 
inates the overhead required to store the array in the exe¬ 
cutable image. An attempt to use the IMAGE attribute on a 
type whose image array has been suppressed will result in a 
compilation warning and PROGRAM_ERROR raised at run time. 

1.5. EXTERNAL_NAME Pragma 

The EXTERNAL NAME pragma takes the name of a subprogram or 
variable defined in Ada and allows the user to specify a 
different external name that may be used to reference the 
entity from other languages. The pragma is allowed at the 
place of a declarative item in a package specification and 
must apply to an object declared earlier in the same package 
specification. 


1.6. INTERFACEJNAME Pragma 

The INTERFACE_NAME pragma takes the name of a variable or 
subprogram defined in another language and allows it to be 
referenced directly in Ada. The pragma will replace all 
occurrences of the variable or subprogram name with an 
external reference to the second, link_argument. The pragma 
is allowed at the place of a declarative item in a package 
specification and must apply to an object or subprogram 
declared earlier in the same package specification. The 
object must be declared as a scalar or an access type. The 
object cannot be any of the following: 

a loop variable, 
a constant, 

an initialized variable, 
an array, or 
a record. 

1.7. IMPLIClT_CODE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies that implicit code generated by the 
compiler be allowed or disallowed. A warning is issued if 
OFF is used and any implicit code needs to be generated. 
The default is ON. 


C-3 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


1.8. OPTIMIZE_CODE Pragma 

Takes one of the identifiers ON or OFF as the single argu¬ 
ment. This pragma is only allowed within a machine code 
procedure. It specifies whether the code should be optim¬ 
ized by the compiler. The default is ON. When OFF is 
specified, the compiler will generate the code as specified. 

2. Implementation of Predefined Pragmas 

2.1. CONTROLLED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 

2.2. ELABORATE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 


2.3. INLINE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 


2.4. INTERFACE 

This pragma supports calls to 'C' and FORTRAN functions. The 
Ada subprograms can be either functions or procedures. The 
types of parameters and the result type for functions must 
be scalar, access or the predefined type ADDRESS in SYSTEM. 
All parameters must have mode IN. Record and array objects 
can be passed by reference using the ADDRESS attribute. 

2.5. LIST 

This pragma, is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 


2.6. MEMORY_SIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.7. NON_REENTRANT 

This pragma takes one argument which can be the name of 
either a library subprogram or a subprogram declared immedi¬ 
ately within a library package spec or body. It indicates 
to the compiler that the subprogram will not be called 
recursively allowing the compiler to perform specific optim- 


C-4 








APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


izations. The pragma can be applied to a subprogram or a 
set of overloaded subprograms within a package spec or pack¬ 
age body. 

2.8. NOTJELABORATED 

This pragma can only appear in a library package specifica¬ 
tion. It indicates that the package will not be elaborated 
because it is either part of the RTS, a configuration pack¬ 
age or an Ada package that is referenced from a language 
other than Ada. The presence of this pragma suppresses the 
generation of elaboration code and issues warnings if ela¬ 
boration code is required. 

2.9. OPTIMIZE 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 


2.10. PACK 

This pragma will cause the compiler to choose a non-aligned 
representation for composite types. It will not cause 
objects to be packed at the bit level. 

2.11. PAGE 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 


2.12. PASSIVE 

The pragma has three forms : 

PRAGMA PASSIVE; 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(SEMAPHORE); 

PRAGMA PASSIVE(INTERRUPT, <number>) ; 


This pragma Pragma passive can be applied to a task or task 
type declared immediately within a library package spec or 
body. The pragma directs the compiler to optimize certain 
tasking operations. It is possible that the statements in a 
task body will prevent the intended optimization. In these 
cases, a warning will be generated at compile time and will 
raise TASKING_ERROR at run time. 

2.13. PRIORITY 

This pragma is implemented as described in Appendix B of the 
Ada RM. 


C-5 







APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


2.14. SHARED 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation but has no 
effect. 

2.15. STORAGEJUNIT 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

2.16. SUPPRESS 

This pragma is implemented as described, except that 
DIVISION CHECK and in some cases OVERFLCW_CHECK cannot be 
supressecl. 

2.17. SYSTEM_NAME 

This pragma is recognized by the implementation. The imple¬ 
mentation does not allow SYSTEM to be modified by means of 
pragmas, the SYSTEM package must be recompiled. 

3. Implementation-Dependent Attributes 

3.1. P'REF 

For a prefix that denotes an object, a program unit, a 
label, or an entry: 

This attribute denotes the effective address of the first of 
the storage units allocated to P. For a subprogram, pack¬ 
age, task unit, or label, it refers to the address of the 
machine code associated with the corresponding body or 
statement. For an entry for which an address clause has 
been given, it refers to the corresponding hardware inter¬ 
rupt. The-attribute is of the type OPERAND defined in the 
package MACHINE_CODE. The attribute is only allowed within 
a machine code procedure. 

See section F.4.8 for more information on the use of this 
attribute. 

(For a package, task unit, or entry, the 'REF attribute is 
not supported.) 


3.2. T'TASKID 

For a task object or a value T, T'TASK_ID yields the unique 
task id associated with a task. The value of this attribute 
is of the type ADDRESS in the package SYSTEM.

5. Restrictions On Representation Clauses 


5.1. Pragma PACK 

In the absence of pragma PACK, record components are padded 
so as to provide for efficient access by the target 
hardware. Pragma PACK applied to a record eliminates the pad¬ 
ding where possible. Pragma PACK has no other effect on the 
storage allocated for record components a record representa¬ 
tion is required. 


5.2. Size Clauses 

For scalar types a representation clause will pack to the 
number of bits required to represent the range of the sub- 
type. A size clause applied to a record type will not cause 
packing of components; an explicit record representation 
clause must be given to specify the packing of the com¬ 
ponents. A size clause applied to a record type will cause 
packing of components only when the component type is a 
discrete type. An error will be issued if there is insuffi¬ 
cient space allocated. The SIZE attribute is not supported 
for task, access, or floating point types. 


C-8 






APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


5.3. Address Clauses 

Address clauses are only supported for variables. Since 
default initialization of a variable requires evaluation of 
the variable address elaboration ordering requirements 
prohibit inititalization of variables which have address 
clauses. Hie specified address indicates the physical 
address associated with the variable. 

5.4. Interrupts 

Interrupt entries are supported with the following interpretation and 
restrictions: 

An interrupt entry may not have any parameters. 

A passive task that contains one or more interrupt entries must always 
be trying to accept each interrupt entry, unless it is handling the 
interrupt. The task must be executing either an accept for the entry 
(if there is only one) or a select statement where the interrupt entry 
accept alternative is open as defined by Ada RM 9.7.1(4). This is not 
a restriction on normal tasks (i-e., signal ISRs). 

An interrupt acts as a conditional entry call in that interrupts are not 
queued (see the last sentence of Ada RM 13.5.1(2) and 13.5.1(6)). 

No additional requirements are imposed for a select statement containing 
both a terminate alternative and an accept alternative for an interrupt 
entry (see Ada RM 13.5.1(3)). 

Direct calls to an interrupt entry from another task are allowed and are 
treated as a normal task rendezvous. 

Interrupts are not queued. 

The address clause for am interrupt entry does not specify the priority 
of the interrupt. It sinply specifies the interrupt vector number. For 
passive ISRs, the nnn of the passive(interrupt,nnn) pragma specifies the 
interrupt priority of the task. 

5.5. Representation Attributes 

The ADDRESS attribute is not supported for the following 
entities: 

Packages 

Tasks 

Labels 

Entries 


5.6. Machine Code Insertions 


C-9 



APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


Machine code insertions are supported. 

The general definition of the package MACHINE_CODE provides 
an assembly language interface for the target machine. It 
provides the necessary record type(s) needed in the code 
statement, an enumeration type of all the opcode mneumonics, 
a set of register definitions, and a set of addressing mode 
functions. 

The general syntax of a machine code statement is as fol¬ 
lows: 


CODE_n'( opcode, operand {, operand} ); 

where n indicates the number of operands in the aggregate. 

A special case arises for a variable number of operands. 
The operands are listed within a subaggregate. The format 
is as follows: 

CODE_N'( opcode, (operand {, operand}) ); 

For those opcodes that require no operands, named notation 
must be used (cf. RM 4.3(4)). 

CODE_0'( op -> opcode ); 

The opcode must be an enumeration literal (i.e. it cannot be 
an object, attribute, or a rename). 

An operand can only be an entity defined in MACHINE CODE or 
the 'REF attribute. 

The arguments to any of the functions defined in 
MACHINE_CODE must be static expressions, string literals, or 
the functions defined in MACHINE_CODE. The 'REF attribute 
may not be-used as an argument in any of these functions. 

Inline expansion of machine code procedures is supported. 

6. Conventions for Implementation-generated Names 
There are no inplementation-generated names. 

7. Interpretation of Expressions in Address Clauses 

Address expressions in an address clause are interpreted as 
physical addresses. 

8. Restrictions on unchecked Conversions 
None. 


C-10 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


9. Restrictions on Unchecked Deallocations 
None. 


10. Implementation Characteristics of I/O Packages 

Instantiations of DlRECT_IO use the value MAX REC_SIZE as 
the record size (expressed in STORAGE_UNITS) when the size 
of ELEMENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For example for uncon¬ 
strained arrays such as string where ELEMENT_TYPE'SIZE is 
very large, MAX_REC_SIZE is used instead. MAX_RECORD_SIZE 
is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a program before 
instantiating DIRECT_IO to provide an upper limit on the 
record size. In any case the maximum size supported is 1024 
x 1024 x STORAGE_UNIT bits. DIRECT_IO will raise USE_ERROR 
if MAX_REC_SIZE exceeds this absolute limit. 

Instantiations of SEQUENTIAL^0 use the value MAX_REC_SIZE 
as the record size (expressed in STORAGEJUNITS) when the 
size of ELEMENT_TYPE exceeds that value. For example for 
unconstrained arrays such as string where ELEMENTJTYPE'SIZE 
is very large, MAX REC_SIZE is used instead. 
MAX_RECORD SIZE is defined in SYSTEM and can be changed by a 
program before instantiating INTEGER_IO to provide an upper 
limit on the record size. SEQUENTIAL_IO imposes no limit on 
MAX_REC_ SI ZE. 

11. Implementation Limits 

The following limits are actually enforced by the implemen¬ 
tation. It is not intended to imply that resources up to or 
even near these limits are available to every program. 

11.1. Line Length 

The implementation supports a maximum line length of 500 
characters'including the end of line character. 

11.2. Record and Array Sizes 

The maximum size of a statically sized array type is 
4,000,000 x STORAGE_UNITS. The maximum size of 3 statically- 
sized record type is 4,000,00G z 3TCRAC.Z_JNIT£. record 

type or array type declaration that exceeds these limits 
will generate a warning message. 

11.3. Default Stack Size for Tasks 

In the absence of an explicit STQRAGE_SIZE length specifica¬ 
tion every task except the main program is allocated a fixed 
size stack of 10,240 STORAGE_UNITS. This is the value 
returned by T'STQRAGE_SIZE for a task type T. 


C-ll 





APPENDIX F OF THE Ada STANDARD 


11.4. Default Collection Size 

In the absence of an explicit STORAGE_SIZE length attribute 
the default collection size for an access type is 100 times 
the size of the designated type. This is the value returned 
by T'STORAGE_SIZE for an access type T. 

11.5. Limit on Declared Objects 

There is an absolute limit of 6,000,000 x STORAGE_UNITS for 
objects declared statically within a compilation unit. If 
this value is exceeded the compiler will terminate the com¬ 
pilation of the unit with a FATAL error message.
